He knows something happened with Hannah and Cas. Was it because of Hannah the angel? Or was Cas attracted to pretty brunettes with blue eyes, ones that he could hold hands with in public and have them not balk at the idea of cuddling?
“Keep the car,” John says coolly. “Just don’t let me see you and your boyfriend near my sight again. I’ll wring both your necks, starting with his so you can watch.”
“Th-that’s far enough. Um...” Dean laughs a little nervously, licks his lips, and directs his attention away from Cas to opening his car door which he struggles with for a moment. Cas boggles at the scene.
Cas laughs. Dean scowls. “We have to talk to Sam and Eileen at some point too, you know,” he reminds Cas sullenly.
“Yeah, well, I do,” Dean replies, clipped. Cas doesn’t answer so he heaves a regretful breath. “I just mean, it’s our first proper Christmas in…in a really long time. I want us all to be a family. Even the weird and dysfunctional one that we have right now. I don’t want anyone left out—and I—I’d like to hang my stupid fucking bauble next to yours, okay? Dean and Cas—or Dean and Castiel. It’s—”
“No one would believe it. There’s no way. Sam and Benny have known us since we were kids. Charlie and Meg and Eileen since college.” Cas stands abruptly, with purpose, only to pace the room aimlessly. “They know you and me. There’s never been anything between us…and—” Cas stops, frowns, and zeroes in on Dean with a scrutiny that makes him blush. It almost feels like he’s being undressed by Cas’ eyes.
“Get the car. We’ll find an ATM, I’ll get some money out from my emergency fund. We’re going to find another motel for the night,” Cas resolves with determination.
“Awesome!” Dean claps his hands together. “Before we go, you should...um—” his gaze trickles down from Cas’ face to his chest, “—unbutton it. Why don’t you unbutton it?”
He sinks to the floor, head in hands, ignoring the barflies barrelling in and out the nearby toilets just as they ignore him.
—licks your ear. You’re just too chicken-shit to reject her outright, so you’ve looped yourself into this ouroboros fuck up of uncomfortable friendship and then eventual reluctant drunk sex.”
“Cas? You alright there?” Benny asks in a small voice, as if he doesn’t want to startle a spooked rabbit.
“Sartre chopped amphetamines,” Cas corrects with a hint of a smile, “but brownie points for knowing who he is.”
“What I’m saying, dipshit, is we should get some supplies for dinner. When you’re done with your soup,” Dean’s voice drops an octave, and he’s been ploughing on so confidently that it’s a noticeable shift when he continues, shyly, “do you want to go buy some groceries? With me?”
“Dean,” Cas repeats, voice trembling. “I need you to put your arm around me. I’m getting you into bed. By yourself.” Dean smirks as Cas blushes and glances away. “Come on.”
He had managed to dodge Sam and Eileen up until they had called into his room that they’d be going out for dinner together. Sam had looked discomfited by the idea of leaving Dean alone, but of course, for this purpose, to be able to be left alone, Dean was able to plaster on a false smile and assure everyone that he’s just going to sleep it off.
“Hello Lisa,” Cas replies, strained. His lips appears as if hooks are yanking at its corners. Whatever Dean’s forced smile looks like, he feels better in knowing it could never be as bad as Cas’.
Pettily, unable to help himself, he gives the waitress a saccharine smile as she walks pasts and asks her to throw away the other straw for him.
He’s thumbed through another page of his book. He’s lounged too casually on their couch to be even a little invested in what Dean is proposing. He’s paying such minimal attention to Dean that it makes Dean’s skin go all itchy and lips go all twitchy like a tempestuous child’s.
“You shouldn’t be anywhere but here,” Dean murmurs, “we could die tomorrow and we should hold onto as much time as we can get here, with everyone that we love.”
“You’re family. You know you are,” Dean coughs and bites his lip and picks at his nail. He’s not looking at Castiel anymore. “You’re our…brother, Cas. Like I said before.”
“Great attitude from someone that’s overstayed his welcome!” Dean calls after his brother who mutters something resembling ‘jerk’ under his breath. “You never mind that, Eileen, you’re always welcome here! Even after you come to your senses and divorce Sam!”
like they’ve forgotten we were supposed to be having dinner tonight,” Dean amends with a sliver of irritation.
It’s like Dean is falling head-first down a water-slide. An unpredictable whirlwind that’s terrifying and exhilarating all at once. Once he knows he’s wanted to kiss Cas, probably has been wanting it for awhile, everything else tumbles out so insurmountably.
“You know, I thought you were better than this, Charlie—but you’re just like every other asshole that thinks Cas and I have something fucked up going on just because our relationship runs deeper than anything. Friends can be intimate, friends can kiss—”
Dean shoulders past Cas and almost runs straight into Sam as he’s leaving the apartment, safety goggles and a water bottle and car keys in hand.
“Stop making me kiss you to shut you up for saying stupid things,” Dean says, rolling his eyes. “I’m in my forties and you’re making us both look like dumbass teenagers here.”
Dean licks his lips thoughtfully, giving Cas the longest look of adulation he can spare during a drive in the dark with no license and no direction.
Now he regrets this entire night because he’s sobering up and his ears are perked, awaiting Dean’s response despite already knowing the answer to Benny’s question.
One hand pressed against the side of his head that’s throbbing, Castiel waves another at the Chicken and Mushroom can. Dean nods approvingly and goes to open and dispense its contents into a bowl, sticking it in the microwave.
It anchors something inside Dean, tethers him to his boyfriend, to the fact that he even has a boyfriend instead of the girlfriend. The pressure of Cas’ palm against his makes it feel okay.
A kaleidoscope of fairy-tale images fans out in Dean’s mind, each cheesier and sappier and more sentimental than the last. He’s got a picture of him and Cas strolling down a riverbank, hand in hand, setting up a picnic, kissing on a dinner date, buying a house together, getting a dog, maybe one day a—
“Sam set you up?” Dean demands, outraged. His fury at his brother spikes. Why the fuck would Sam do that?
That’s about all Cas can recall because Dean was already punching Benny’s number into his phone and dialling by then, and Cas…Cas, in the meantime, had gone for another furious swig at the bottle.
It’s been a couple of days and 15x18 is still traumatising to me. So that’s the theme for today’s fix-it.
Dean huffs and turns his attention back to Ash. “You’ve known us for years! How have you been thinking all this time that we were anything more than friends?”
“No, Cas, no,” he insists, face heating up from frustration. “It’s inconsiderate,” he ticks one finger off, “it’s thoughtless,” he ticks off another, “and overall, it’s just shitty, alright?”
“Me! I’ve made you my chicken alfredo many times! You said you loved the additions of onions, mushrooms, and—”
“—and you said you’d wear protective gear the next time around. Now do you have safety goggles or not?”
“I shouldn’t have said what I said,” Castiel says mournfully, “I shouldn’t be pressing you with your…difficulties. I shouldn’t be insulting your intelligence either. I’m just…frustrated—“
Castiel pats his hand reassuringly. “I have…fucked up a lot too. We all seem to have a habit of doing so, but all we can do now is strive to stop…or lessen it, at least. For what it’s worth, I appreciate the apology and I, of course, forgive you.”
“I became best friends with you when you were a stray child and you never once said I was cool,” Dean protests, poking Cas’ chest with a socked toe in jest.
The boy responds with an astonished but appreciative grin that incrementally thaws into a more solemn smile.
As they head over, he hears Cas sigh. “I was distracted...thinking about something. I didn’t realise we were meeting other people so soon.”
April catches up to them in the living room and calls Cas’ name. He pauses momentarily to seize her eyes with his despite Dean’s physical barrier between them. He feels like he’s about to burst into tears, because he
The weightiest difference is that he’s pretty sure he’s never kissed anyone he’s been this in love with.
He watches Cas clear the table and load the dishwasher with newfound scrutiny. “I’ll pick up some groceries tonight and make you pasta. Do you want me to make your chicken alfredo?”
“I picked them up at a convenience store on a whim, like, yesterday, Dean,” Sam explains, still sporting that irritating shit-eating grin, like all of this is so goddamn farcical, “if I had special ordered one, it wouldn’t have arrived in time.”
“Um…” Castiel glimpses quickly at the ugly green thing Dean’s brought him instead of a cardigan and he frowns. “What’s wrong?”
“Are those my lucky boxers? They are! Dean! You know you’re allowed whichever one but that one!” he yells, scandalised. He also loosens one hand from around Dean’s wrist to smack him with a nearby pillow again.
Meg,” he says in a sickeningly endearing tone, because he absolutely despises Meg, and he doesn’t understand how she managed to claw her way out of hell and into their friendship group. “Wouldn’t we like her so much more if she would just take the hint and stop slithering into your pants though?”
John might have had more vitriol to expel. Cas supposes he’ll never know because Dean’s fist knocks powerfully into his father’s jaw, upending the man who then stumbles his way backwards. Off balance, he trips over his feet and ends up sprawled over the motel carpet.
seen you look at anyone the way you look at that man,” she volleys back ardently. “Sam and Cas, that’s a friendship that runs deep. Even you and Benny.”
“Perhaps I will just feed you crap,” Cas continues crossly, jutting his lip out at Dean like a stroppy kid.
“So…” he sways his shoulders back and forth expectantly, lips pursed, “that’s a yay over nay? We gonna fake bone and fake fall in love or what?”
“Dean,” Castiel says with more force, and it’s enough for Dean to shift his eyes upwards and face Castiel. “You are not a shitty person.”
The corner of his lips pull into the most impish little smile Dean’s ever seen on anyone, a favourite Cas smile of his, and his chest feels lighter by a tenfold for it.
Dean pauses to take a breath. “For what it’s worth, your quirks? It’s what makes you so special to me. Every inch of who you are is what—what makes you so special to me—and...um...” he chuckles uncomfortably, then seems to change his mind over what he was about to say next, “at least I get you back for movie nights, right?”
Dean sighs, the worry lines of his forehead vanishing. “Okay. Sorry. Just—maybe shoot them a message, let them know we’ll be out for awhile or something. In case.”
Cas nods along understandingly, but his belly fills with nervous flutters and he purses his lips to prevent himself from beaming at the idea. Boyfriend.
“Um...” Dean is vying for help from Cas again, but he’s now staring anywhere but at them as if he’s intruding on a very bizarre moment.
Cas can’t hear it—but after becoming so well-versed in this kind of interactive episode with their friends, he’s sure Benny sighs at this point.
“Actuallty, the primitive men of the Palaeolithic era were rather advanced for the age of creation they inhibited, and they began quite impressive stone tool developments for—”
“Cas, we said we weren’t gonna call each other that in public,” Dean mumbles automatically, though he doesn’t really care right now.
“You know, I’ve been watching you two dance around each other since we were all going through puberty,” Benny continues. Cas’ muscles seize up. “Isn’t twenty-eight old enough to have your bisexual awakening? Or whatever your Cas-specific orientation comes under.”
Bobby looks at him with beady eyes. “You really think I’m such an idjit that I didn’t know about you? The way your eyes always lingered on him…” Bobby scoffs. “Most of us knew before you did. I figured you wouldn’t want to be bombarded about it before you figured it out yourself. Especially not with…”
Dean turns to Cas, once again, in reach of some understanding. Dammit, Cas was always the clever one, the teacher, the homework he copied from, the sun, the stars, and today he is acting just as confounded by everything as Dean.
Dean tries to go for the beer surreptitiously, muttering a dismissive ‘hey’ in return to their far friendlier greetings. He doesn’t look at them.
“Fuck. Fuck.” Dean runs a trembling head through his hair. He turns pointedly away from Cas, stands from his chair, knocking it over in his rush to get up, and stumbles away at least a few feet, shouting again. “Fuck!”
Dean throws his head back and groans. “What are you, five? I obviously didn’t mean that!” He groans again. “Shit. I’m sorry. I’m stressed.” He shuffles his feet towards Cas and tips at his chin so Cas looked at him. “Look, I am sorry. I got us into this and I’m taking it out on you. Not cool. We’ll say it’s a prank.”
“Since when did you eat?” he blurts out, interest hitting him and slowly rising into a stream of panic. “Fuck, when did you start getting hungry? Are you—” he stops himself before he asks if Cas is okay, because he’s not a friggin’ girl and they’re not about to braid each other’s hair while they talk about feelings or some shit.
She’s smirking like she finds the whole thing pretty amusing and that makes Dean narrow his eyes at her.
At some point, their hands find each other’s again. Dean has one on the steering wheel and another tucked in Cas’.
“I don’t believe it was wise for you to drink alcohol along with your breakfast,” Cas grumbles, “or objectify women like that even if you are feeling tipsy. You’re better than that.”
“I’ll get the yes.” Dean swings his legs onto Cas’ lap just to be a jerk and Cas, certainly annoyed, instantly shoves them off more roughly than usual. “I got you to set a bag of shit on fire in Henriksen’s office senior year and you were on course to becoming valedictorian."
“We ain’t. Need me some drinks after that...whatever that was. We really didn’t think this entire thing through well enough,” Dean chuckles, feeling anything but humorous.
“We’ve been through enough shit, be a little optimistic, will you?” Dean says, poking Cas in the arm with the edge of his elbow. “They’ll have some kind of paint.”
“Dean,” he intones, “I have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about right now. What happened in there?”
He watches Dean, asleep with his mouth hanging open, and a burst of fondness follows. It strengthens as he looks at the saliva his thumb had gathered off his own cheek.
“No!” Benny turns back around so he can point an accusatory finger at Dean. “One big reveal is all the energy I have to crack out of you today. I’m not doing this one too. Let me out. I’m going home.”
“Bits and pieces,” he says, suddenly glum. He swirls his soup around with his spoon. It doesn’t look very appetising but the first warm slurp down his gullet does settle his stomach somewhat. And because he’s feeling a bit bitter, he adds to tactically annoy Dean, “I felt like we might have held hands?”
Had Cas not seemed to physically enjoy it to an indisputable degree, Dean would potentially feel guiltier than he already does for taking advantage of the situation. He’s halfway to convincing himself that Cas is not that amenable a friend—no one could be—and that he must be appreciating this at least a sliver.
“Rough hangover?” Dean jibes, though his face leans closer and he’s inspecting Castiel with concern. “You want an Advil? Some soup, maybe? Might go down you easier."
“Hey,” Dean swings to open his arms wide and flash a swaggering grin at Cas. “We gotta flesh this out now, right? The best artists come up with their best works under the influence.”
“Dean.” His name always falls so prettily off Cas’ lips. Pillowed lips he’d wanted to brush his to. His name sounds so cradled coming from them, said so carefully, with purpose and with reverence.
“Good,” Dean says, bringing the car to a halt at Bobby’s house. Cas supposes he’s staying the night at Dean’s tonight.
“On my dresser. Could you pick me up an extra layer of clothing too? It’s chilly out. I’d like a cardigan if possible.”
In all the beginnings and in-betweens and ends, his head and his heart flare with every touch and look and word because it’s
Benny glares at him so mightily that Dean shies his own eyes away. “Do you know how frustrating it’s been, watching you two dance around each other all these years? Do you? Do you know how many times we’ve wanted to just lock you two in a room until you either humped or realised you could be doing exactly that because you both have feelings for each other? There was one time in college where Rowena almost trapped you in an elevator together. It was very dangerous. I stopped her. You’re welcome.”
“I mean, I get it, she’s your first girlfriend and everything but we’ve been hanging out less and less and—Benny misses you, Sammy misses you, I—I miss you.”
“I apologise,” Cas says robotically, “I didn’t mean to make you ill at ease. Personal space. I get it.”
“Fancy running into drunk-you here,” she says, offering him her hand to help him to his feet. He takes it gingerly. “Not seen you in awhile, handsome. Especially not this wobbly on your toes. Kismet, wouldn’t you say?”
“Yeah?” Dean’s definitely starting to lose his happy drunk high. There’s an argumentative edge to his voice that is ascending quickly. “What lines are those?”
Dean grumbles his assent as Cas reaches into their medical aid drawer—they have one under Cas’ insistence—and plucks out a tube of aloe vera gel.
“Dean,” and there it is again. He could listen to Cas say his name as he drifts off into death, and he would still be happy for it. “Dean, I didn’t let you kiss me because if…if you do feel that way about me back, I would like you to accept yourself for it first.”
“Brother…” Benny says in the most empathetic timbre Cas has ever heard on the man, “if you won’t accept…if you can’t let yourself want anything more yet…you also can’t be acting like there is more. This is going to spiral into something fantastically stupid and that stupid thing is going to blow up in both your faces. It’s also just going to drag out an ache that won’t be pacifiable.”
“Um—hi,” replies a man’s voice who is decidedly not Cas. “I found your boyfriend’s phone on him after he went behind the bar and threw up everywhere. He’s pretty drunk, man. You should probably come get him.”
“I hope I don’t have to do a lot more of that,” Dean says, half-amused, half-chastened. “Though I probably should have been doing a lot more of it in the past—or just, you know, not…fucking up things with you in the first place.”
She was very patient with him, and he’s thankful for it. He’s been coming to this therapist for about 9 weeks and they’re helping, but this is the first time he’s doing what he came here to do. To talk about his dreams.
, he looked about the same age as me. But I started to crave the intimacy, the love, the conversations, I wanted to know why I was cursed with them.”
Castiel sat on top of Dean, lining Dean into him again, sitting slowly on his dick, moaning as he bottomed out. Dean was breathing deeply under him, desperate to move his hips.
“Yes, I’m yours, Cas.” His voice trembled with pleasure and fear. Castiel still felt so tight, so hot around him, he felt like he was about to explode. “You can hurt me, Cas.
After his last text to Charlie, Castiel took another drag of his cigarette, staring at the ground, pretending he hadn’t seen Dean, but he knew, of course he knew. He looked up, slowly lifting his head, leaving a neutral expression on his face. He finally looked into those deep green eyes again. There was a kind glint to it.
“Sam, I love you. You know that. But maybe, just maybe, I have a job and I teach teenagers, remember? I'm always busy. I meant to call them this weekend on FaceTime.”
, and it was perfect. Dean moaned Castiel’s name as he came, hot liquid filling Castiel up as he came, along with Dean. He felt come dripping, his hips faltering as he pulled Dean’s hair.
“Right to the point, huh? You’re right. Anyway, I like this guy.” Cas felt a stabbing pain in his chest, swallowing down the lump in his throat at those words.
“Ms. Novak, there’s a lot of... bad crowds in here. Every school is bound to have one, sure, they smoke, but they are respectful and don’t bother anyone, as far as I know. I do smell the cigarettes, but I'm also a smoker – not my best habit – but, what can you do? I swear, if I could give you a better answer, I would. I don’t like to point fingers, but I try to be supportive of my students through the good and bad. I’ve been where they are now, so I worry. If anything bad happens to her, I'd feel responsible, but the school would tell you right away.”
Waking up suddenly was getting really old. Looking at his window, the weather was still grey and dull, as he expected. Today Charlie would be here. He had to get up and be alive and aware.
Dean left feeling lighter, yet, still nervous. He didn’t hide the fight from her, nor what he had said. But he had hidden the dream he had
He looked beautiful. His eyes were glued to Castiel kneeled in front of him, his eyes in a dark shade, his cheeks reddening by the seconds, hands caressing Cas' face. He bobbed his head taking in all of Dean’s shaft in his mouth, the tip hitting hard at his throat. He grabbed Dean’s ass, motioning for him to fuck his mouth. Dean look at him in complete amazement, smiling through his moans. Dean pulled his hair, holding him as he fucked Cas' mouth. Cas had tears in his eyes from deepthroating Dean, as Dean’s thrusts became erratic, Cas realized he was about to come. He quickly shoved his hand in his own pants, jerking himself off.
Castiel woke up wishing he hadn’t. Guilt and shame were creeping up in a cold sweat, the pain settling in his stomach. Flashes of last night came as easily as shame. God, he had no right to feel like this. He felt a warm breath on his neck, it was labored. He wasn’t the only one feeling shame.
“Good. I'm sorry to disrupt your work like I did, but sometimes we have no choice. Thank you, Dean. I'm glad Anael has a good teacher around here.”
Castiel saw his brother be destroyed by anger and hatred; he couldn’t accept the humans, couldn’t understand why his Father would create something so fragile and flawed. Lucifer had said they would destroy themselves with madness. Lucifer was cast out of Heaven, because he had disobeyed their creator. He had questioned his orders, what he had learned. The angels knew they were supposed to follow.
“We can find your personality. We can find who you are. At this point, I'm sure you know that although you may have acted out of anger because of it, you shouldn’t use it as an excuse. It's hard to read between the lines, especially when you
Their first meeting was pleasant. A breath of fresh air for both of them. Secretive little smiles and knowing glances. Key words to know what they were feeling, what they would do. Nothing could ever burn brighter than their love and devotion for each other.
They heard footsteps through the fallen leaves, someone was coming to them. They knew it was Charlie, because fuck, she was giggling like a school girl. Except that Castiel felt like one. His heartbeat was so loud, his lips tingling and red, his hair pointing to every side possible and his skin burning where Dean had touched. He immediately got up and got back to the bonfire without looking back to see Dean, looking heartbroken.
Castiel looked at him, waiting. He lined himself up and slowly entered Castiel. Cas’s breathing faltered and he softly gasped, feeling the burn of the stretch.
He was smiling, his eyes shining as he held her hand and they talked. He looked happy. Happier. He hated that it was with
He wanted to dream again, he wanted to go back to Castiel, their place, the world he’d built inside his head, their eternity together. He knew that Castiel would always wait for him there, would always be there, smiling and promising sweet nothings to him.
Dean smiled at him again. They were so close, Cas could feel his breath on his mouth, looking at Dean's oh-so-perfect lips made him feel lustful. A sinner. The most spectacular sinner, and he would most definitely go to hell for the unimaginable things he wanted to do to those lips. He closed the distance between them, feeling the softness touch his lips, his hand grabbing Dean’s hair softly, the other caressing the side of Dean’s face. He tasted like beer and smoke. He smelled like leather and cigarettes. Suddenly, they were almost out of breath, and Dean was on his lap trying to take his shirt off. Everything was hot, too hot, too much was happening, and all around him was Dean. Only him. God, he felt his heart trying to jump out of his chest when Dean touched there. They were almost dry humping each other, and how they weren’t doing it already was beyond Cas’ comprehension, seeing as Dean could probably feel Castiel's erection against his ass. God, it was a fever dream and it was definitely high.
“It might have been a mistranslation, something went wrong, but we now know what we’re looking for!”
He got into the water, feeling shivers down his spine as his lips trembled with how cold the water was. The river engulfed his entire body quickly, his senses drowned along with him as he put his whole body under the water. He opened his eyes underwater, and saw the rocks surrounding him. It was so easy to get lost. So easy to just drown. To breathe in underwater, flood his lungs. Easy to imagine how much it would
He sat on his bed, staring at the ceiling, holding back the tears and trying so hard to breathe slowly, calmly, through his nose, but he couldn’t
“I thought your name was Castiel, but hey, whatever floats your parents’ boat. You remember Sammy, my brother, right?” Dean said trying to stifle his laughter, failing miserably.
Cas opened his closet, picking up a blindfold, rope and a small knife. Dean looked in anticipation, feeling his dick jump in excitement. Cas approached him, wrapping the blindfold around his eyes, then put the ropes around his wrists, bounding them together.
At some point, Charlie started to yawn. She looked at him, in the manner a little sister would look at her brother as if she
), but came back empty. No lore could explain. Charlie even looked for the name Castiel in every country possible, and none of them resembled the thing Dean described.
came, it was huge; the angels couldn’t stop talking about it. Everyone was impressed with how the thing moved, the sounds it made were
“Well, because everyone here is interested in someone and you’re just... there. And hey, Dean has just come to terms with his bisexuality!”
She got up from the chair and put it back on its place, smiling down at him. “Dean... you are even humbler than the stories make you out to be.” She said calmly as she stopped at the door before closing it after her.
Dean closed the bedroom door, and locked it, too. He turned on the lights. They were purple. Dean stopped in front of him, hungrily gazing at him. His eyes looked black.
When Charlie met Dean, they were barely out of middle school. It was a hot summer day in Lawrence, they were sweating through their summer break, feeling nothing but sweat and discomfort. They sat under the trees at Centennial Park, hoping for wind and shadows from the trees that would loom over them. They were sharing the same shadow, eyes narrowed and breathing through their mouths. They looked at each other at the same time. Dean’s hair was soaked with sweat, his freckles shining under the small sunshine that went through the leaves. Charlie’s cheeks were a tinted shade of red – she wouldn’t tan, no, she’d just stay red – and her ginger hair up in a ponytail, as her overgrown bangs fell in her eyes.
from happening. What was up with that?” Dean could hear his voice raising, but he couldn’t stop it. He felt the turmoil inside his chest, mixed with anguish.  “It could be
“Oh, uh… that. Yes. I kind of wanted a reason to… just let my anger roam freely through me. I just didn’t think it would actually happen. I didn’t even want to fight, but no one was doing anything, and it pissed me off. The kid was just about to get raped and no one moved a muscle! They’d rather look the other way than actually
to quit smoking. Dean moved his fingers slowly, patiently waiting for Castiel to tell him what he wanted to hear, as his dick throbbed with
“I've had them since I can remember, I guess. There isn’t a time in my life in which I remember not dreaming about it. About him.” His words are left hanging. She waits for him to continue. “It’s... It seems very real. Like they’re memories that my brain suppressed due some trauma. Or another life. At the start, it was hard to tell reality apart from it. I went to sleep and woke up. I went straight to my mom to tell her about this guy I met. Obviously, she freaked out, since I was a kid and never left her sight or my dad's. I can only imagine her thinking some creep was talking to her little kid. It took me a little longer to realize that I was me, but I wasn’t
graced. He’d heard rumors about it. It felt like going through the ice cold flames of hell a thousand times, like going through a black hole and feeling your entire being getting disintegrated by a higher power. It felt a lot like fighting a thousand of demons, millions, even.
He missed her like hell. He missed all his friends. He always misses them, but sometimes, he can’t do anything about it; can’t bring himself to get out of bed and be functional without getting stressed and angry and wanting to die. Can’t bring himself to text, or call. Get out of the house. God, how many times had he lost a job because of it?
Finally, Cas got to his knees and unbuttoned Dean’s pants, bringing it down along with his underwear. Dean’s dick was right on his face, wet with pre come, pink and flush.
“Uh... normal, I guess. Had another dream. Only once. I could go to work normally, without feeling anxious."
Dean smiled even more and said “Fine”. He got up and looked around their little circle, Castiel dropped his eyes to the ground, refusing to make eye contact so they could see the rejection exposed in his face. Dean walked up to him and got to his knees in front of him, his fingers making their way to Cas’ chin, as he touched him, electricity made its course through them, making Castiel look up to him.
, we just had to be thankful the dude still hadn’t lost his patience and took Samandriel someplace else. How fucked up is
Castiel took the knife into his hands, moving up and down Dean’s dick, slowly. The knife touched Dean’s nipple and he shuddered with the coldness of the blade. Castiel ran the knife through Dean’s chest, careful not to hurt Dean as he rode him.
When they got back, they sat on the couch again with their beers and burgers, catching up on Vikings. Charlie didn’t like it very much – “Dude, Lagertha is
he was almost bursting his load just from tasting it. Usually, he’d be happy to suck him until he came, but now, he wanted something else. He stopped and got on top of him, kissing Dean again, stopping to make his way down his neck, licking and kissing it, feeling Dean’s beard on the side of his face.
She took a deep breath and smiled a little. Her pink lips curled upwards made her eyes gleam in sympathy. She had nice eyes.
Silence fell upon them comfortably; a silent agreement of ‘I love you’. When they finished the third season, they got up to buy dinner. Dean put on his coat and shoes, deciding it was best to, since it was getting colder. Charlie was in her pajamas; it was fuzzy, she was warm enough. She put on her shoes and followed suit.
He sighed. Of course he could lie, but that wasn’t the point of the game. And she didn’t specify who was the crush, so he’d let it slip this time. “Yes.” For some reason, he looked at Dean after admitting it. Damn it. Dean was truly beautiful. His eyes gleamed at him, and he threw a smile his way. Castiel's heart melted. They spinned the bottle again, this time stopping on Balthazar and Sam.
When he finally calmed down, he took a deep, long breath and kept crying, he let the tears continue rolling down his face. He hated every minute of it. Now, he felt even worse. He always felt bad after these things happened, wondering how he could have every thought those kinds of things. He calls it The Other Dean; it’s the only way he can describe it. He felt so tired. Other Dean tired him out, exhausted his body, left his hands to tremble. It was still 5 PM, but he decided to sleep anyway. He laid down on his mattress, letting the warmth and comfort wash over him, as tiredness took him away.
He took a deep breath, and for the first time in forever, he didn’t feel the heaviness on his lungs from smoking so much during a long time. His lungs were clear, his throat wasn’t raspy. There was no weight on his chest. He wasn’t breathing heavily. He then started to look at his own body, looking for his imperfections and scars, and was surprised that he found none (on his hands, and his arms anyway). His hands weren’t calloused, his nails looked perfect and
Dean was laughing as he recounted a tale from a few weeks ago to Eileen when he suddenly stopped dead in his story. He looked over to the bar, taking in the slowly dying crowd of drunks around them. Cas was nowhere to be seen, and that realization felt like a buckle of cold water over Dean's skin. They had split when coming back into the bar, Cas having needed a quick stop at the restroom. But that was a good fifteen minutes ago now, and Dean's stomach was beginning to twist. He flagged Nick over to them, ignoring the questioning stare Sam was sending his way. Adrenaline threatened to pump into his veins, but he tried to keep himself calm until he confirmed his fears.
The reception was dying down now, everyone having been zapped back instantly into the bunker’s war room, which was now covered in beautiful decorations. Music still played loudly, Charlie and Sam were dancing in the middle of the room, just a tad over the line into drunk. Dean sat off to the side, chatting quietly with his mother and father. Cas smiled softly at the sight. They were the last two left around from Chuck’s gift, midnight having come just a little while ago.
room, so three minutes was a bit of an overestimation.” Dean had to laugh that the absurdity of Cas’s literalness, but he wouldn’t have him any other way.
Cas stood with a rough sigh, the ache in his body mirroring the ache in his heart. He looked at his bloodied and discarded clothes, wondering what he should wear out of the hotel. His eyes traveled to his own skin, noting that the trail of dark hairs on his stomach was dried to his skin, dried cum having been neglected in his need for sleep. The sight of it both warmed him and froze his heart at the same time. He processed that he had small flecks of dried blood across multiple parts of his body, either missed or forgotten as well. Resolutely he headed toward the shower, attempting to tackle at least one problem within his grasp.
Cas shook his head, his brow furrowing deeper. “No, Dean, I presumed to understand that you would regret it once we finished. You have made it quite clear that you have an affinity toward relationships with women.”
“Grooming?” Dean felt his voice crack as he lifted an eyebrow at the suggestion. He had no idea what Cas meant, exactly, but he couldn’t help feeling like there was something forbidden unspoken in Cas’s assertion.
Before either of them could even open their mouths to speak or attempt to button Cas back up, the back door of the bar swung open, assaulting them with blaring music. Dean stepped sideways and faced away from Cas, both in an attempt to block any view someone might have of the man’s naked hips, but also to block him from any potential harm. He watched as a busboy that he had seen earlier tossed a bag of trash into the dumpster before quickly heading back into the bar, paying them no attention.
The ideas that he had for Dean were downright sinful, house guests and party completely disregarded in his need. He was about to show Dean just how much he loved him. Show him just what it meant to love each other until it hurt.
A doctor had come not long after, bringing a light of hope into Dean’s eyes, a light that Sam had watched fade almost instantly. The doctor was kind and gentle, but he had informed them that Cas had suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a bleed on the brain caused by a ruptured aneurysm. The doctor had assured them that Cas had a high chance of survival, that Cas was a good candidate for a much less invasive surgical option to correct the issue. Sam had focused on the doctor’s words, but his eyes had not left his brother while the doctor spoke and explained the upcoming procedure. He had watched as his brother’s face had slowly grown to look like stone, his brother’s walls that had long disappeared quickly rebuilding themselves. Dean had become so open in the past years that Sam almost didn’t recognize his brother standing before him then.
Dean ignored the anxiety that was slowly building in his chest. There he was, lying beside his best friend, having thoroughly fucked him into the sheets. Dean couldn’t remember the last time he had felt so sated, so at peace in someone’s arms. Even Lisa hadn’t felt like this. Dean thought it was due to being completely free to be himself with Cas. Lisa had always been accepting of him, but Dean had always kept more from her than what he felt comfortable telling her. Cas knew about the dangers of being in his life; hell, Cas might even have it worse during this apocalypse.
“Cas?” Dean's voice bounced off the walls of the small room just a second before his face peered around the show curtain. Cas regretted his current position instantly, the look of worry on Dean’s face driving home how weak and helpless Cas felt these days. “What are you-- Are you ok?” Dean’s features held an ounce of confusion as well as he pulled the curtain further back and crouched closer to Cas’s level.
He almost didn’t register Cas’s movements. His brain was slow to process, but he realized Cas had a finger pressed against his ass just a second before he felt Cas enter him. He sucked in a breath, tension rippling through him again. He fought to override the sensation, forcing himself to relax his muscles around the sudden change. Cas paused above him, but he just nodded, realizing late that his eyes were shut from his concentration. He felt Cas begin to move again, and he blindly pulled him back in for another kiss. He nearly whimpered when Cas pulled away, until he felt Cas take him in his hand again. The angel began to slowly move both hands in unison, slowly massaging him inside and out.
Sam stepped in next, a look of confused worry playing on his brow. Jack quickly followed, his fright seeming to move him forward rapidly. Dean felt a frown cross his lips in empathy of the kid’s worries.
Dean didn’t respond, instead he grabbed Cas’s wrist in a lustful stare, pulling him away from the table. The intent was obvious enough that even Sam caught where they were going, shouting a vague chastisement about their case being able to wait, but Cas didn’t care. The raw need in Dean’s eyes had been enough to make his cock twitch in his jeans.
“Mr. Winchester,” the doctor addressed Dean, which Sam wasn’t entirely sure was the brightest idea, “your husband is in recovery.” Sam felt his heart leap, not having realized how afraid he had been that they would be hearing an apology. He also winced as he realized that this would be the first memory Dean would have of Cas being referred to as his husband. After learning last night that Dean intended to marry Cas, Sam had thought the word would bring his brother more joy when it was finally said. But they had needed to fake paperwork to get Cas seen and to explain Dean’s complete unhinged nature, so it had been unavoidable. But he worried there would be lasting damage to Dean from the choice.
“Dude,” Sam tried to not chastise his brother too severely, knowing Dean was already kicking himself, “that was harsh. I think you really hurt his feelings this time.” Sam shook his head, wondering how Cas sometimes put up with the surly hunter.
But the look of Cas in the dim light of the parking lot, his bare ass pressed against Baby’s cold metal, his eyes slightly closed, kept Dean from dragging it out further. He dipped his head back down to take Cas in deep, relaxing his throat to keep the gagging from coming again. A gasp ripped itself from Cas’s lips, his head flung back as he hit his release, and Dean swallowed around his cock. He kept his head still, gently stroking out the remnants of orgasm from Cas as the ex-angel shook from the power of it. When he finally pulled away, Dean stood with a wicked smirk, relishing the red tint that now covered his angel’s cheeks. Cas’s breaths were still coming in bursts as he eyed the hunter, though Dean could see that he was slowly coming back down from the delightful high Dean had skillfully induced.
Sam kept his brother fed, and tried to keep his spirits up any way that he could. Which he had to admit was hard to do when Dean had stopped speaking to him directly. He had to give it to the man, Dean could hold a grudge when he wanted to. Ever since he tried to address the possibility that they needed to plan for all outcomes, Dean had chosen to ignore Sam’s presence whenever possible. He would eat and drink what was offered, but only spoke to Cas.
Cas watched as Dean poured a liberal amount of clear liquid from the bottle into palm. He sighed in pleasure as Dean slid his palm against his cock, adding a much-needed slickness to the movement that the ex-angel had not realized he needed. He watched as Dean repeated the process on his own member, and Cas lifted his hips toward Dean, hoping Dean had understood. Dean spread Cas’s knees wider and positioned himself between them, his cock resting against Cas’s ass, hard and demanding.
He felt Cas snake his hand between them, and he found himself holding his breath in anticipation. “Relax, Dean.” Cas’s words were soft and gentle, coaxing him to release the tension he had not realized had begun to take over his body. He lost himself in the pressure of Cas above him, the movement of their hips as the began to move again against one another. He ran his hands down Cas’s back, feeling the muscles ripple under his fingers.
Dean sat at the end of his hotel room bed, his duffle sitting between his feet. He toweled his hair, swearing that he would be seeing green splotches all over his skin for days to come, thanks to that bitch. He smiled though, as he looked over to the table where Sam and Eileen sat, signing away at top speed, laughing at some joke that Dean wasn’t able to decipher. But he didn’t really mind, he was glad Sam seemed to be opening up with Eileen. Maybe Sam and Eileen could find what he had found in Cas. He wanted that for his brother, almost as much as he wanted to finally ask Cas to marry him. But he had to wait for an opening that didn’t seem too forced. Cas deserved better than just a casual, “Wanna get married?”, as much as Dean knew he was out of his comfort zone here. Maybe he’d call Charlie or maybe ask Jody for help.
He looked back to Cas, who seemed just as enraptured in him as he was with himself. “Cas, this is amazing.” He turned slowly, acutely aware of how large they were and how small his room now seemed. He folded his right wing in toward himself, running his fingers gently against the light feathers there. He grimaced as he took in the details, the little broken pieces and grime he saw under closer inspection. “I see what you mean. These things need a good spot wash.” He looked back to Cas, who now has his wings tucked back into his shoulders. “How do I do it?”
“I’m sorry that I was unable to give you the information directly. But I assume what my brother told you is true.” Dean could see the reservation on Cas’s face that he didn’t yet understand, but he let Cas talk. “I didn’t mean to frighten you, Dean. The spell was quick and I lost consciousness before I was able to inform you of what was happening.”
Dean was in the middle of reading the paper again when Sam, his head in a book, caught the sound of Cas’s monitors beeping. The sound was a new one, almost hidden in all the other normal sounds of the hospital around them. But Sam then saw the flash of a light that hadn’t been lit up before, and a nurse ran in, then a second, then a doctor. Sam watched as his brother was pushed aside and for the first time in those long four months, Dean came to Sam’s side of the room to stand beside him. They stood shoulder to shoulder as the staff worked, and Sam felt completely lost in the bits of the talk he overheard.
Jody looked strong behind her and Sam pulled her to him in a hug as Claire walked to stand next to the bed. “Hey, Cas.” Claire's whisper was so low and soft that Sam almost didn’t hear it at all.
Alrighty then. For those who need the spoiler ---- Cas does not die. He will live, so rest assured that I'm definitely not lying. All is happy and wonderful in the next chapter.
Jody stayed with them through the next two days, running down to the cafeteria several times to try to get food for Dean. Sam knew her efforts would be ignored, but she didn’t seem to know what else to do for them. He could empathize completely with the feeling, constantly wanting to start a conversation, anything, just to get Dean to speak. Besides quiet whispers, prayers to Cas, Dean had not spoken to anyone since the doctor had first told them Cas was comatose. He had barely even acknowledged the food and drinks that Jody had kept supplied, just taking a bite or two and a drink when they were offered.
Sam stood loudly, bringing attention to the fact that Dean was grinning like an idiot, the weight of their secret having been finally lifted. “I’m happy for you guys, really.” Sam grabbed his paper, heading back out of the kitchen to give them some privacy. “I swear though, soundproof your room. I have guns, I will use them.” Dean stood, his brother already forgotten, heading toward Cas to plant the deepest kiss he possibly could in his new freedom.
Sam pulled himself back to the present, looking back to Dean’s face, noticing for the first time that night that the hours had not been easy on his brother. The stone was gone, replaced now by an unhinged wildness in Dean’s eyes. Sam knew that look, the one that Dean wore when he wanted to know where to point his gun and shoot. But they both knew there was no monster this time, just the cruelty of human life between Dean and his angel-turned-hunter.
Sam pressed his head back against the glass, not able to watch his brother cry anymore. But he couldn’t stop the sound of his brother’s voice as he started talking again. “I don’t know how much time we have left, Cas. So,” Sam heard a quick sniffle and he could imagine Dean putting on a smile, trying to be as strong as he could, “how about one last song?”
“Yes. They were very adamant that I had information,” he chuckled darkly at the thought, then regretted it as his chest pain flared. The light sounds of the cloth wiping at Cas’s battered face lulled them back into silence for a few more minutes. Cas looked to Dean’s face, trying to keep distracted as Dean worked. He was constantly surprised by the hunter’s ability to be gentle when needed. Having lived such a hard life, he didn’t know where Dean had learned the ability, but he was immensely grateful for it now. Dean made a final pass over Cas’s face before throwing the towel away, grabbing a new one to begin his work on Cas’s chest.
Cas grinned, feeling his pulse quicken at the suggestion. “Really now, Mr. Winchester. What did you have in mind?” Cas raised an eyebrow, waiting to see just what Dean was willing to lay down on the table. Dean smirked, looking like he was about to detail out just what he wanted to do to Cas, but they both paused as they heard the sound of a throat being cleared.
They continued right up until they pulled into the bunker’s garage. They were laughing about a lyric Cas had misheard, when they both seemed to come back down to reality in the same breath. Cas lowered his gaze to his hands, wishing that the inevitable would just pass them by if he kept quiet. But that would be too easy, and he knew his life was never that.
Cas scoffed and rolled his eyes, which Dean appreciated highly, feeling a little closer to the Cas he knew. “I understood music before I fell, Dean. As a celestial being, I was unable to process the whole of a musical piece. I heard the beats per minute, the individual notes, the key changes. But the enjoyment of a piece, the emotions felt by it, has been an entirely human experience.” Cas paused, looking like he was getting lost in his own thoughts.
“You two prayed about me? Even in heaven?” Dean looked between his parents, showing just how much it meant to him that even in paradise, his parents had still been watching out for him.
Cas’s features became serious. “I have found it easiest to either have a partner help groom them, or to shower them thoroughly on one’s own.” Dean blinked rapidly.
Dean was out of his chair and running down the hall before he even processed the sound of glass shattering and a body hitting the floor. His knees hit the floor hard as he slid to a halt next to Cas, who seemed to be out cold on the kitchen floor. He felt his heart freeze, not even knowing what to do at that moment. Should he take his pulse, vitals? Do angels really even have them? And why would Cas be sick? Angels don’t typically pass out at random intervals.
At the end of the first day of Jody’s stay, the feeling in the room took a turn for the worse. While their hopes had not been high, Sam knew he and Jody had still been holding the belief that Cas could wake up. He would smile, apologize for the inconvenience, and they would all go home and forget this nightmare. But when the clock continued counting forward, passing the 48-hour mark that doctors had given them, it felt like Sam couldn’t get enough air. It reminded him of sci-fi movies where the oxygen was slowly running low and you never knew exactly how long you had left until the end overtook you.
Cas jogged enticingly away from him, throwing a lustful glance over his shoulder. Dean tried to steady himself by walking slower, but of course, that gave him a nice view of Cas’s ass, both a blessing and a curse. Especially given that Cas was now bent over in the backseat, searching for their special ‘go bag’ that they kept stowed under the seat for occasions when desperate need hit them while away from the bunker.
Sam looked up from the magazine in his lap to find nothing in the room had changed in the past hour since they had both taken a seat. Sam sat in the corner, keeping watch as a hunter’s life a taught him long ago to do in any situation. Dean had pulled his chair as flush against the bed as possible, wrapped his hands around Cas’s hand the best he could. Sam tried not to take in how many machines they had connected to Cas or the tube that was down Cas’s throat. He knew the doctor hadn’t outright lied to them, but the tube told Sam that Cas’s situation was much more dire than the doctor had let on.
Cas was frowning as he let Red wrap his hand around his thumb, he met Dean's green eyes as they slid to him in the rear view mirror.
The woman's hands were surprisingly steady as she wove each stitch through flesh in Sam's bicep, dipping in and out with practiced ease as he held the arm out on the steel operating table.
He shifted his eyes to make sure no one was looking, and tore open the box, tugging out the little carrier and fitting it to his chest, fiddling with the straps. He tried to picture Eggy, how big it was. He made a little invisble ball with his hands, trying to gage the size. Would it work?
"Dean, you are-" The angel shook his head but finally did smile, just barely. It vanished quickly, but at least it was there.
“From behind tonight, alright?” Dean muttered when his angel covered his body with his, the pressure of his warm weight pressing him further into the foam mattress as he draped over him, he could feel the pressure between his cheeks as Cas’s hard cock nudged up against his hole, as Cas peppered drawn-out, suction kisses to his freckled shoulders.
"I guess so. He's sleeping." Dean tried to dismiss it. Sam shouldn't be worrying about anything but himself right now.
Cas was silent the whole time Dean dabbed at the lacerations with the peroxide-soaked cotton ball, he could feel it bubbling and tickling under his fingernails, and he didn't even want to imagine how it felt for Cas as white foam suddenly fizzed out from the red. Cas did take a few more swigs from the flask, and Dean smirked as he saw a bit of red in a splotchy pattern beginning to spread on his cheeks and on his temples.
Jack bowed his head respectfully and the centers of their foreheads touched, their usual trueform greeting. It caused a wave of goosebumps to race down Jack's arms and legs back in the human world, bringing him back out of it. He could feel his attention slipping away back to his bedroom.
"How about hell no." Dean all but growled. "Or are you forgetting you're the one who almost killed Sam?"
This dungeon was damp and smelled horrible. Chains and cuffs with holding sigils lined the wall. And I was greatful at least that they hadn't used those torture tools and put me on the rack. Yet, at least.
Cas smiled a little. "It's over, baby." He passed his hand over his hair again. Bobby's blue eyes were bright as he kissed Cas on the cheek. "Can I go play wif brothers n' sister now?"
"A little," Jack yawned and stretched his arms over his head. "I think I read the same paragraph five or six times, though."
"I need this attached." Sam nodded to the arm. His hands were stained with garnet, and trails dripped down to his elbows. "Now."
"Hey, you're pretty shaken up right now." Sam sprung up and chased after him. "Hold on. Do you need any help?"
The collective sigh in the room was incredible. Even though everyone had been dubious at first, Dean thought they liked being reassured by having the presence of an angel in their midst. He just hoped Chuck wasn't going to be running around telling people what had happened. It would be a little weird if everyone found out that he was in love with someone he was sharing a body with.
angel, especially the majority of heaven's occupants were involved? He pulled on his coat, kissed Karen goodbye, grabbed his trusty sawed-off and slung it over his back, and made his way to Heaven's roadhouse.
“Alllright. Sounds like a break in the shower." Dean groaned. "Let’s get goin’. Our wood’s no good, so no eggs ’n bacon till we get back.”
"Maybe." He muttered back, and he felt the wad of cash press from the pocket of his borrowed jeans. "I will wait here."
"Okay, Dean." Cas's voice was hushed with tears. He brought up what the two of them had been avoiding. "I'm sorry about Sam."
"I'm sorry," Dean rasped, hiccuped, looking up into those deep blue eyes. "I'm sorry for hiding, Cas."
, Cas saw himself whisper before his eyes rolled back in his head and he passed out onto the tiled floor.
Cas noticed Dean hadn't told him about the other bottle, so Cas asked about that. Dean told him that the other bottle 'Samantha' used only, because he had girl hair and this bottle was called 'conditioner.'
He only hissed a little as Dean dabbed onto the scabs with a washcloth. They were filthy, and Cas barely made even made a noise when Dean softened the scabs with water and pulled the blackened scabs off, falling in pieces like petals to the tiles on the bathroom floor.
Chuck forced his eyes open and squinted into Cas's face. "Jeez. I must be kinda dehydrated or something. I can't do this right now, Cas, I'm sorry. I..I'll talk with you later. I'm so sorry." Chuck pushed himself to stand up and still swayed a little. "I know I must come as a large disappointment. Hopefully Sam and Dean can help me change that, maybe when I find my grace.."
"You're a Winchester. I'll be damned." Bobby spoke up before he could finish. "I can tell, it's by the way you're carrying yourself. No doubt about it."
"Hey, hon." Dean paused on the last step and halfway slung an arm around the angel, who leaned up for a peck in greeting.
!" Cas screamed, reaching for her decaying, blackened hand. "My child--" But she was being swept away much too fast. They collapsed amongst the ash, struggling to breathe through the choking ash and through the tears. Wind whistled eerily across the wasteland. Just when they thought the dream was over-- Sam's distinct voice carried over from the wastelands.
"Babies don't understand speech yet." Dean tried to hide a smile from his lips, but handed the little boy over anyway.
He turned to look at Cas, who was sitting down at the table, his eyes lowered to that egg again, he was smoothing it down tenderly with the slight shush of his palms against the shell. "Seriously, Cas, is that your kid or something?"
Dean full on laughed, throwing his head back into the pillows as his chest squeezed. "You're one weird dude, Cas." He joked, lightly squeezing his shoulder to show he didn't intend for it to be mean. Then, Dean began to laugh again.
And when Dean came back to the living room, he laughed his ass off at both Sammy and Kevin, their arms full, slow-twirling around the room like idiots.
"You git what you git and you don't throw a fit." Red mumbled, letting Dean go over his bright, wet locks with the towel. He was cute when he was pouty.
Dean looked surprised at this. "You've been feeding them?" He realized how exhausted Cas looked, and not just from his usual waking-up grogginess.
The woman who greeted him at the kitchen's face fell immediately. "What will it be this morning, sweetheart?" She asked softly. Like the people who talk in funeral parlors. Dean found it very weird. People had suffered worse injuries in the past and no one treated it like
"It's fine," Dean waved the comment away. "It's good to keep on using this arm and make it stronger, you know?"
Dean thought bitterly as Cas once again forced their shared eyes from checking out a camp member Katie's fine, round little booty.
"You better be careful, Cas. You have no idea what that thing you're holding means." Crowley muttered, working his cuffed hands somehow to take another bite.
Tobias then suddenly seemed to notice that Castiel's forearm was wrapped up. He drew his eyebrows together and gently reached out, Cas let Tobias stretch his arm out as he bowed his head in shame.
"How's that fit?" She asked meekly when she'd finally tied off the very last stitch. Sam flexed his newest arm and wiggled his fingers--Dean's silver ring flashed back at him. It was a bit shorter in length that the other, but it would have to do. He had all he needed as long as the Mark stayed on it.
Cas hurried back to the car, keeping the camera in the bag but he stuffed the pain pills deep into his pocket. He waited for a few more minutes before Dean came back to the car, and he indicated for him to get out as he waggled his eyebrows.
Chapter description: Dean was not meant to be Cas's true vessel. So what happens when the disjointed souls in one body begins to wear it down?
. It had been building up for a while now, every little thing piling up. Fatherhood, and feeling like he was royally fucking it up. Mom was back, and yet she’d abandoned him and Sam. Michael in his head, using his deepest thoughts and insecurities as weapons against him as they fought a war with his head as the battleground.
Cas hovered in the doorway as Dean tucked on the sheets and threw blankets on the bed, smoothing them down and patting the bed, trying to make it seem a little more inviting. "Alright, buddy." Dean smiled half-heartedly at him. "See you in the morning, I guess."
"Well, you do now that I told you." Jack smiled sunnily at him. "He says a lot with his wings, actually. Like another language. Just because he can't fly doesn't mean they don't have a use anymore."
Dean snorted and held the cellphone in the crook of his neck between his cheek and shoulder as he went to help Cas, who was pulling the babies from their bath in the sink, the ones not getting attention and being dried off immediately were squealing for attention, splashing water everywhere. A telekinetic wave pushed almost half the bathwater over the rim to splash noisily to the floor.
. His first tears dripped from his eyes and streaked down his cheeks, and Cas’s lips were there to capture them before pressing gently up to Dean’s lips again, lowering him all the way down with a firm hand spread over his back. Dean tasted their salt.
It basically meant they had to keep an eye on them constantly, and if they put them somewhere they most likely would not just sit and stay there. Dean found it the easiest if he held them to keep track of them.
should have been the one teaching me how to draw today, not Sam!" Jack snorted. "Can I learn art from you from now on?"
"So, can I go for a stiff drink now, or what?" Dean asked, his hand plopping down with a faint smack onto his thigh. "And maybe put on some actual clothes?"
savior, the one he loved after all. Thinking about his future made his head spin. It wasn't perfect, and there was hard work to be done. But he found a peace in knowing he'd have his dearest baby angels to take care of and watch grow, he would be hunting alongside his family and cleansing the world of evil one case at a time. He thought of his future with Dean, that his "G'night" would be the first of thousands.
Every once in a while the angel would pause just to lay his hand over Jack’s head, when at first he’d been annoyed since it was taking away from the time spent drawing, now Jack reveled in the gentle pressure and warmth of it. His eyes were falling closed as he struggled against it, soothed by the quiet, rhythmic scratching of graphite. Each time he batted his eyes open, the pencil drawing of Dean’s budding wings was more and more complete.
"Aren't demons going on the down low for now? I mean, the gates are partially shut, anyway." Dean shot back.
"Oh, um..Dean...one more thing." Chuck added as Dean made his way out the doorway of his bedroom. "I think...no, I am..I'm ready for you to tell Cas who I am. I think it's sunk in enough for me to own up to it with him."
"It was a mistake." Castiel answered. He felt water rush into his tear ducts. "Tobias-" His voice had started to waver. He still kept his head bowed, he felt so ashamed. The archangel quickly stood up.
"The angels are falling." Chuck voiced in disbelief, squinting and slamming his hand around to find his glasses on the bathroom cabinet, running from the bathroom with the towel wrapped around his legs, screaming into the empty house "BY GOD! THE ANGELS ARE FALLING!"
"The Darkness takes what it wants and-and they took it back." Cas explained in defeat, his voice scratching at the back of his throat as he kept Dean upright by holding onto his bicep. "They took the arm, and they took Sam."
"Uh- look, never mind with the alcohols. Just the pain killers, please. And..." He smiled a little as he saw the classic yellow-and-black disposable camera. He figured he should start to take some pictures now, so the new angels could see what life was like before they were born. The man shot him a death glare but took out all the items, finally practically shoving the plastic bag into his hands.
"What are you talking about? Sorry for what?" Dean closed his eyes and took in a deep breath. The pain in his head was agonizing, throbbing against his temples. He already knew something didn't feel right.
"I realized it's better to have a conversation...keeps the thoughts at bay. At least temporarily." He slipped the shirt over his head. The cloth was pungent with Dean's scent, and it was overwhelming his seemingly new sense of smell.
"We bond tonight," Cas said gruffly, turning away before he could doubt himself more. Dean was not himself, that was the one thing the angel was sure of. He needed to burn out the substance before it could grow any more.
Cas turned around, there were spots of red beginning to bleed through the two long strips of white gauze bandages rolled down the length of his back.
I want to feel sunlight on my body and finally breathe in fresh air for once. If only that fallen angel wasn't so damn protective of those kids. Not like I could do anything to them, anyway, chained like a this.
“This is rain?” Jack said softly from his burrito of a sleeping bag, but he couldn’t really move, he felt so heavy and warm. It was peaceful, like his body was sleeping on without him.
"If you were fine, then why aren't you worried about Sam?!" Cas finally accused, angrily narrowing his eyes at him and taking a step back, curling his hands into fists. "This Darkness is very dangerous. He could be dead, or-or
"It's fine. There was probably beets in something I ate, I don't know. Don't worry about it." Dean mumbled, he didn't want to get caught talking to himself in the bathroom again. Yet the angel could tell he was hiding something.
Dean pulled the last stitch out. The line was strange-looking. Cas was not used to seeing the aftermath of an injury, he usually healed things away. Cas hissed as Dean dabbed a cotton ball of hydrogen peroxide on it and it fizzled white.
It was somewhat endearing. Chuck was still wrapped up in that damn blanket, the ragged edges swaying around his hairy calves, his disheveled tuft of semi-wavy brown hair topping the blanket, the rest of his body concealed by the quilt. The fallen angels milled about.
"What's this, Dad?" Tobias asked, his voice gentle. Cas didn't mind the title so much when it came from his lips in such a loving, casual way.
Bobby clapped him on the shoulder. "Okay. Now git. I have some planning 'n prepping to do." He said lightheartedly.
It was so peaceful up here. It was hard to think about all those broken brothers and sisters of his that were here on Earth, maybe in some of the tiny houses he saw with the lights on. Maybe some of them were very hurt. Maybe some of them didn't even speak English. Maybe some were still wandering, lost, afraid, hopeless.
Dean hummed a tune as they packed it up, not saying much as they tried to get it done as quickly as possible. They shoved the haphazardly collapsed tent slick with rain into the boot of the Impala, and Jack climbed into the passenger's seat as Dean took the wheel.
Dean let out a sigh of relief. "Get him some water for when he comes to. He might have been overworking himself and just got exhausted."
"The nightmares don't go away." Dean hated to admit, but it wouldn't be fair to lie to Cas. "It doesn't matter if you're cozy and safe as can be going to sleep. They come back. They always do, when you've seen the kinds of things we've seen."
"Dean," He managed to choke out before his eyes rolled back into his head and he passed out cold, falling to the side by still snagging his ribs on the sharp craggy piece of the mirror.
"Why are you so pissed off all the sudden?" Dean demanded. "If you want them to have toys, fine. We'll get them toys. Why are you so angry about it?"
Dean nudged Cas's shoulder, which earned him a groggy moan and a turn over from the exhausted new dad. He'd accidentally fallen asleep on Dean's bed again after they'd been talking for a while last night. The strangest part was how normal it felt now.
"Well, I mean-" He took a look at Cas's face and whipped around to see the egg, rocking back and forth as little pieces of shell were pushed aside, one last fledgling making their exit, using its wings to create a large enough hole to climb out of.
"Oookay," Calcifer grinned and leaned on the door. "I downed two Red Bulls, and I'm feeling good. Let's see those little winged rugrats."
The angel observed people like an artist who would observe someone posing in the nude: highly analytical of the beauty of the human form but completely detached. He'd think to himself:
The was a beat of slightly awkward silence. "Then we will." Cas cleared his throat, still turning his back to Dean as he fiddled with an orange pill bottle and shook a few pills into his hand. Dean had no idea why Cas was making such a big deal about it, but then again he did things like that all the time. "Take these for the pain. And I will start collecting the ingredients soon."
With Sam bungling out the bar on unsteady feet, at the aid of Dean and Cas, they manage to get him lying back scrunched on the back of Dean’s impala in under ten minutes. There were a few falls. He drools on Eileen’s lap and is already snoring away when Cas slides into shotgun.
“We’re leaving!” Dean growls before slamming her front door shut behind them and kicking the door once for good measure, enraged.
“Goddammit, Dean!” he shouts, bounding up from his bed. “How many times have I told you to use the front door? My mother isn’t even home!”
“My clothes require laundering the same way my body does now. This attire is smelling…musty. I believe I still have some spare shirts of Sam’s in my room.”
“As far as I’m concerned, this seems more like a ‘you’ problem,” Cas says in a finalising manner, even injecting finger air quotes,
“I’m sorry,” he blurts, “I already forgot what I said, but I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you,” he worries.
He quickly washes today’s dirt and grime and sins off, dries off too, then grabs Cas’ favourite bumblebee boxers from his newly folded laundry out of childish spite. He dons it on and tosses his old pair into the laundry basket.
“I fell in love with Dean before any girl even caught my eye,” Cas spouts off like this is the big confession that he’s finally getting to pour from his chest. “I wasn’t that interested in other men. I tried sex with women and enjoyed it. I suppose I’m just Dean-sexual.” He chuckles. It comes out sad.
He only momentarily curves his gaze downwards when Dean wets his lips. Cas quirks his own in an encouraging smile.
Another time, he’s chatting animatedly with a classmate of Castiel’s named Benny around the high school bleachers. Castiel was only passing by because he got lost. Rebellious too, then.
“I suppose so,” Cas bites his lip, looking bashful for some goddamn reason. Dean’s going to be kissing those lips soon.
“—and let’s face it, Megleficent the Reigning Bitch of Evil isn’t going to loosen her talons from you anytime soon unless you’re out of the dating pool for her entire gender—”
He’s in love with his best friend who he’s in a pretend relationship with which is going to have to come to an end soon which will result in the collective upset of all their friends and family who apparently believe in this relationship more than the American public do in the moon landing, and Dean has no idea how he’s going to spend the rest of his life trying to find anything better than what he’s gotten from Cas in this silly little scheme that has given him the most cherished snippet of his wildest dreams.
A phone vibrates in the distance and they both exclaim, “shit!” at the same time. Dean doesn’t even have time to tease Cas for his expletive because he’s scrambling to grab his phone. Sam’s name is emblazoned in letters that seems like a rebuke to their ignorance of the world and it’s impending doom.
“That waitress though,” Dean whistles as they cross the door back into the bunker. “Did you see the way she kept looking at us? Bending over like that. We probably could have tag-teamed if we wanted.”
“Uh-uh.” Dean stops Cas by the wrist as he reaches for his wallet. “You’ve both already had your first drinks. Clearly. We’re off the hook this time.”
“Cas,” Dean calls, before Cas can exit with Sam’s clothes piled in his arms. He almost pleads with him to not do this. Instead, he says, “Sam’s shirt on you will just make you look like you’re wearing a friggin’ dress. Take something of mine.”
“All I meant to say is that he won’t have to look at us any differently because we’ve been the same as we always are, and we will continue to be what we’ve always been. Sam will see that.”
“If I am still awake when you finish, Dean Winchester, I will be back,” comes the ominous whistle of air.
“Yeah, stupid,” Dean kicks at the scuff on his shoe like he’s thirteen and not scraping mid-forties.
He ignores Sam’s calls of protest, Eileen’s calming hushes to his brother, and barrels out into the hallway—straight into Cas. Solid-bodied, fresh-smelling, wet-looking Cas, in a towel and naught else.
“You don’t have to come over,” Dean says grimly, once again wondering how the hell he survived life this long being such a monumental idiot and getting them into this situation. “It’s my mess. I’ll—I’ll go through with it myself on this front. It’s on me.”
Then Cas shakes his head. “Thank you, but I only came to gather the clothes Sam said he’d set aside for me. I think he didn’t want me going into his bedroom without supervision. I’ve been known to pick up the human things I find interesting and put them back where they don’t belong. He lost his shaving foam and still blames me for it. I swear I put it back in his laundry hamper, where all the bathroom things go,” he babbles.
“Don’t make light of this,” he warns in his commandeering tone that was very much angelic and forceful. For a second, Dean feels an emotional whiplash and his insides waver with uncertainty.
They can research later. Hey, let’s watch TV or something. Oh, I know. We could play a board game. Monopoly? Unwind for a bit, yeah?
It feels normal now. More normal. Hopefully more and more the more that Dean does it. Comfortable. Nice.
“Can you believe them?” Dean snickers. “Moseying around, skipping between your room and mine like they own the damn place.”
“I’m not going to need safety goggles to fix a damn sign. It's not even more than a one-person job. I don't know why Bobby's strung Benny and Ash and Garth into it.”
, you idiot. If you aren’t scared, it isn’t courage. There’s a lot of strength in vulnerability, you know.” She kicks him lightly on the shin with her heel for good measure. “Now will you please go out there and sort your shit out? Otherwise, I’m going to start charging you for this therapy session.”
When they reach the bunker again, Dean hands Castiel a gun and tells him to keep lookout. “I need to grab some extra cash as well. Just remembered we need to fill up Baby’s tank soon, might as well do it on this run. Where’d you leave your phone?”
Dean had picked him up at the bar. He recalls foggily that they might have held hands, but no. That’s something Dean would definitely consider gay, and he’s made it abundantly clear in the past through the parades of women and outright verbal denials that he’s markedly not.
Dean’s in bed now, shoved under the covers just had he done for Cas a couple of days back. He didn’t even notice quick enough to protest and demand the floor instead.
His sleep-addled brain clicks awake in an instant. “Is he okay?” Dean asks, already putting on his jeans. “And…er…boyfriend?”
“Because I…” Dean flushes and rubs the back of his neck. “I told them I was. Well. They assumed, and I didn’t correct them. Seems easier to go with it than waste time explaining our fucked up history, ya know? What we are to each other.”
“I don’t think therapists use forms of violence to assist their patients,” Cas mumbles, rubbing the side of his head.
Dean kind of resents his calm. “Why did you even let us come here? How could you even let me talk you into this? You’re supposed to be the smart one! The sane one! The rest of my life pretty much banks on you stopping me from doing and talking you into insane shit like this, Cas!”
Unfortunately, the morning after hadn’t been so chipper with Dean waking up head-first in a toilet bowl and Cas conked out, limbs akimbo, in a vomit-coated bathtub. They almost missed the wedding and Sam’s honeymoon consisted of him assisting Dean and Cas with their quickie stress-fuelled annulment via Skype.
“What?” Dean balks. “Come on, man, I’ve taken all my outside clothes off. It’s not like my boxers are dirty! I’m so tired and I feel gross and sad.”
“No, man. We’re never going back there. I’ll work extra hours at the garage. Hell, we’ll live out the car if we have to for a bit—but Sammy, I promise you, we’re going to be okay. You’re going to have the best damn life, Cas here’s gonna help you with your homework while I sort out a permanent place for us to live until you go off to college. I’ll—I’ll figure it out. I’m going to do everything to give you that. Alright, kid?”
That one had hit too close to home. Dean was most definitely going to find someone else to cook with, to laugh with, to share intimate knowing looks with, and so many more adventures that Cas will not have a chance to partake in with him. Dean will find someone to settle down with and it won’t be Cas. Dean will move on and then it’ll just be Cas.
“Vehement. Is that your word of the day?” Cas tries to tease, tentative and quiet. One corner of his lips quirk though and it’s enough to launch Dean into grin.
When they step out the car, Dean’s fingers drift towards Cas’ and they clutch at each other once more as they make their way down the steps of the bunker.
He once distractedly shoulders into Castiel in the cafeteria, after stealing a candy bar from the vending machine by punching a random set of numbers and shouldering hard into that too. He mutters a fumbled apology to Castiel without seeing him. Clever, resourceful, and civil despite his troublemaking streak.
Cas has edged himself back over and onto the bed. Dean shivers when he accidentally peeks at Cas’ bare chest and legs and reddened lips.
Dean laughs at him cruelly. “You know, I was working myself up to apologise to you for that stupid fucking thing I said, but maybe I was right. You always seem to have a way of making things go wrong.”
It’s quite distracting. He doesn’t hear his name being called until Eileen touches his forearm gently and tilts her head in direction of Sam.
“Doubtful.” Cas glowers at him one last time, then shuffles onto his feet and snatches his book to his chest with an air of you’ve-wasted-both-our-times-and-I’m-not-speaking-to-you-until-dinner.
“Habit,” mutters the pile of flannel and dirty jeans that’s rolling about more clumsily than a baby armadillo. Once Dean finds his footing, he stands imperiously over Cas only to give him a dirty look. “Was that April I just saw skipping out your door with her shirt inside out? Also, why are you not wearing a shirt?”
“You’re a fucking child. I’m going to smother you one day,” Cas grumbles, turning pointedly away from Dean, pulling all the covers with him.
Thank you to anyone to took the time to read this or comment (even just to vent about anything completely unrelated such as the SPN ending 😂)
He thinks about the many thoughts he’s suppressed, the many Do Not Say Out Louds, and how he’s been lying to Dean for about as long as Dean has steadfastly told him nothing but truths.
Dean also seems to be the only one that can tell when it’s done out of learnt politeness. He is, however, jealous that despite his falsified smile, Cas does seem genuinely pleased to see Sam, untethered by the webbings of hurt and tension and suppressed strife. Nothing like when he first ran into Dean again after…everything.
This is what Cas considers his ultimate comfort. He hopes it’s even a sliver of that to Dean in this time.
Maybe he could find a reason for them to stay a little longer and Dean could keep playing along for the people he already played along for. The thought gets Castiel giddy.
He doesn’t answer. It’s like he can’t hear Castiel, or like he’s not listening. Again. He’d laugh if it wouldn’t sound so jarring in this tense silence.
“Ten,” Cas says breathlessly from beneath him and Dean bounds off him so fast he knocks his head on the edge of the coffee table.
“Yeah, okay. Yeah. Then don’t tell me not to talk to her like that,” Dean responds, stilted and a bit dumb.
“Do you want me to drop you home or at Gabe’s?” Dean asks glumly, reversing effortlessly out the parking lot with one hand on the wheel.
“I can’t believe you’d think a rebel angel like me wouldn’t do that to my own boyfriend,” he eventually says, blushing. “Especially when they can be as troublesome as you are.”
After Dean settles Cas down onto a chair and hands him a cup of cocoa, then another to Jack, Sam startles him at his side by the bar where Dean is pouring whiskey into a tumbler for himself.
Dean bolts upright and when he manages to look at Cas without his heart racing like it’s at its end days, Cas is beaming at him.
Castiel feels his throat close up and the pain of his headache carried downwards into a throbbing heartache.
“Hey!” Dean cries and catapults a nearby slipper at Cas’ head. It misses by an inch, but only because Cas tilts his head to avoid it. “Stop looking at me like that! I’m not some piece of meat, you asshole.”
“Me being upset about you dirtying up my ride with your filthy shoes? Can’t say I see the connection, sorry.”
“He’s into all that healthy shit like Sammy, aside from my burgers, heh—he never refuses them…but—uh—he’s always talking about wanting to grow his own organic fruit and vegetables. A greenhouse would be a great birthday gift or…maybe just something I can do for him to make him happy.”
Dean can take two steps and he’ll be close enough to envelop him. He’s sober now so maybe Cas will even let them kiss once some time has been devoted to clinging onto each other—for all the time that’s been lost to Dean’s stubborn and uncompromising will.
“Look, son. I’m not going to pretend I know all the correct terms to use. If you’re happy, it shouldn’t bother you or anyone else what you call yourself,” he says seriously.
Sam and Eileen are awake when they get back. They watch Elf, Cas giggles throughout it like a dumbshit, and they end up putting the baubles away for next year, when Sam can special order one with Cas’ name on it.
“Aw, angel, don’t say that.” Dean reaches out to pinch his nose, receiving a slap on his hand for his efforts. “You’re absolutely perfect.”
He settles on the armchair beside them, after observing the two interestedly for only a few seconds.
“You’re welcome, Cas,” he replies, his eyes crinkling from the upturned stretch of his lips. Castiel wishes he could frame that smile and keep it close to his heart.
“So...” Dean ventures aimlessly, feeling naked and awkward and like he wishes hell would open its jaws under him. “Yeah. Um...yeah. For real. No joke.”
“No. I suppose this is classic Winchester tradition though. Snapping at each other about something stupid on Christmas Eve,” Sam says,
Dean reddens somewhat too but he’s still smiling at Castiel. “Yeah. Castiel Winchester. Nice ring to it, huh?”
She shakes her hand off of his. “Being terrified and doing it in spite of the terror is what bravery
He chucks a set of his loungewear at Dean, and Dean, for the life of him, can’t come up with one good reason as to why Cas is being a little cold to him. He sluggishly dresses himself, his high from their intimate moment already shrivelling away.
filled with so much foolish loyalty to you that I just go along with everything,” Cas rants five minutes into the drive. “Dean, I do everything that you ask. I always come when you call. How do you get me to say yes to every stupid plan? Tell me, I am genuinely curious.”
“Cool.” Cool? Dean needs to get out of here right now. Instead, he blurts, “you know how to shave? I could…I could—”
Castiel lets the butterflies turn soft in his belly. “Thank you, Dean. It has been nice cuddling you as well.”
Dean harrumphs, balls up the the pair of dirty boxers and throws it squarely at Cas’ head. He pulls them on under the sheet aggressively, holding his glaring contest with Dean the entire time.
“My mother is home tonight, Dean. She won’t—she won’t be okay with it, you remember what she’s like. I had to tell her I was visiting Gabe at college this weekend. Is there anywhere else we can go? Bobby’s?”
Cas’ face transforms from a soft worried look to one that is full-bellied chortling. “Have you given thought to how our friends would likely have a problem lying about something this disreputable, discounting the fact that Charlie especially is a terrible liar?”
He understands their budding relations are likely over now, but what’s worse is he let himself spill his vexation onto Dean, again. He doesn’t want to embrace this side of being human, the emotional destruction to one another, the flaring of tempers that burn only themselves.
They collapse into each other, and Dean plants one more kiss onto Cas before they weave into an embrace. Dean’s fingers tangle and strokes through Cas’ hair as Cas grips the back of Dean’s shoulders, burying his face under Dean’s jaw.
Cas was once a far more serious boy who discerned his childhood as a series of carefully moderated and formulaic performances.
Dean shrugs. It’s a forced gesture, but he’s obviously trying emulate the nonchalance of it in his heart. “Who cares?”
? I’m not the one huddling under blankets at 1AM with my best friend, swearing him to secrecy over watching another telenovela rerun or—or how you wore Rhonda Hurley’s panties that one—”
He has the door unlatched and one foot out when her hand settles on his shoulder. It’s comfortable there and almost tender. “Claren—
Dean goes to cradle Cas’ cheek without sitting, startling him, making his cheeks flush, the heat pouring from his skin like lava.
This is why he loves Cas, because Cas always makes things better, in any shitty or weird or uncomfortable or unhappy situation. Cas makes things click.
“Shall I—um—me too?” Dean fumbles, realising only after his mouth spewage that he didn’t manage to ask Cas with enough words.
For Dean, his rule of thumb tends to be that if he smells bacon, he drifts to it like he’s in some Disney animation where the character floats towards the mist of pie. Lately, when he smells bacon, he knows it’s Cas in the kitchen and it’s a signal to avoid drifting to the source of the smell because another thing that’s worse than Cas being gone is when he does see Cas, and Cas looks right through him as if he’s a ghost.
“You’re not against me stealing, but you draw the line at unhealthy eating habits.” The boy snorts and smacks the proffered apple away.
It takes three steps inside the yoga studio for what they’re doing to crash into Dean like a monster truck with loose breaks. He is immensely grateful for Cas’ grip tightening on him, holding them both upright.
This is why it’s particularly upsetting that his mouth doesn’t cooperate with his brain when he babbles out to the boy, “I like your freckles.”
The first time they make eye contact is when he hops up onto their field trip bus, dressed in an oversized and tattered AC/DC t-shirt during winter.
“You’re so annoying, you know that?” He shoves one hand at Cas’ chest, who bounds backwards and stumbles on his feet with mock horror.
“Dean,” he starts with, and it’s a good start. It’s familiar, it’s warm, it’s embracing. The tension leaves Dean’s shoulders.
The joy from it glows brighter in his chest than any other kiss. It’s pretty surreal, pretty wonderful, and he forgets everything else that isn’t Cas’ quiet hum of pleasure against his lips.
“Oh. I—me too, I suppose.” Cas returns to his book, though his eyes don’t dart from word to word on the pages. He seems caught in his own thoughts. He’s biting his lip. His ears have pinkened at its edges.
Cas gives Dean a private teary smile. Dean responds with his own, Jack doesn’t notice, and Sam pretends not to.
“Okay, you guys, well,” she fans a hand over her face, “thanks for doing this after my last class and not before. I think I’ll go grab a few drinks with the girls tonight, after all. Call in a sitter for Ben.” She squeezes Cas’ hand and then squeezes Dean’s.
Ash takes a huge bite of his pie and chews it thoughtfully. He appears to come to some kind of conclusion as he shakes his head. “Weird joke, man. Seems like only people with feelings for each other would do something like that.”
She lifts a brow at him curiously. “Your boyfriend called out for you and your first instinct was to hide. Okay, explainable, maybe. I can’t think of a reason as to why you’d bring me in here
“I just—I—” Dean squirms, itching the back of his neck. “I don’t know! Maybe it’s because she stabbed you that one time? Why would you want to have sex—excuse me, lose your virginity to that? Why not—why not someone else?”
Benny smirks at Cas with an air of cool boredom. Their friendship has always been lightly contemptuous and Cas always finds himself returning Benny’s friendly jabs as childishly as possible when he’s intoxicated.
After they finish, spent and still heaving for breath, she coils around him like a tightening cord. Cas brushes a strand of hair away from her face like men often do during tender moments in romantic TV.
Cas paces forward, makes sure he doesn’t run into Benny’s shoulder like the two before him had done. His eyes trail Dean’s back. He watches blankly as Dean finds himself a stool and easily catches the attention of the pretty barmaid.
“It’s just annoying,” Dean rambles, moving forwards across the table to hiss under his breath, “why would she do that? Couldn’t she see that we’re—you know…and even if we weren’t its kind of rude to just…just hit on someone like that when they’re with—shit—you know—a friend or…or whatever.”
it works because—because think about it. Wouldn’t it actually be pretty disrespectful and maybe even a little homophobic of everyone to call bullshit on it? Why is it so implausible for us to realise our feelings for each other now? Yes, okay, it’s a little late in the game but we’re at the age where we’re ready to settle down now and look, oops, it seems we already have with each other in this beautiful two-bedroom apartment, which, now that we only need one bedroom, is equipped with a spare one for our upcoming child—”
The looming doom is no longer the end of this pretend, but the end of the close quarters of their friendship. It’s dawned on Dean with a galvanising fear that Cas may be doing this with someone else in the near future. Perhaps not Meg, but definitely someone Dean cannot fit into the mould of.
Dean puffs out a scoff. “You could start by throwing out the coconut oil you slather on your skin every Sunday night. Makes you smell weird. You’re basically a damn baby in a trench-coat as it is, your skin doesn’t need to be any softer than it already—” his voice fades mid-rant when he turns to face Cas and their noses bump together.
“Is that really what is bothering you? Because, okay, valid point, and thanks for reminding me of another snowball being thrown at this avalanching disaster, but—”
Cas sits on the bed as Dean has seen him do a thousand times and nothing’s ever looked sexier or more inviting to him. He pats the space next to him and Dean has never seen anything cuter. He’s going to need therapy for this.
“Cereal at midnight? You a shifter? What happened to my hippie health junkie brother?” Dean mocks, then realises his own compromising and very mockable position.
“It’s a common expression, because it’s commonly true, and I don’t even watch Dr. Sexy anymore,” Dean says defensively, crossing his arms.
“Understandably, I’d imagine it would be quite difficult to find any ornament with the name Castiel decorated on it,” Cas tacks on, lips quirked. “It is somewhat niche.”
Chuck carried the little boy and softly lay him onto his bed. The kid barely even stirred as he tucked him under the covers. Chuck lightly pulled on a wing that had flopped in an awkward position, readjusting it to be more comfortable. He sighed, trying to not think about all his children he had lost when he was gone. "They'll learn to conceal them very soon. It's almost a shame. They're so very pretty, aren't they?" Chuck asked distantly, softness in his voice. The brothers were convinced.
Dean yawned and swung his legs over the side of the bed, and he glanced over at Cas once again. The blankets had slipped lower, they left much of his bare back exposed and the excessive amounts of iron in the bunker tended to eat up all the warmth, so Dean gently shrugged the quilt a little higher over him.
That brightly shimmering grace was still right there, so delectable. It took Jack so much strength just to hold himself back, and he pulled away from the hug. The new distance didn't do much to help the hunger.
“Our son,” Cas repeated with such conviction that Dean shivered and gasped quietly. It was a statement that refused to be countered in any way. “Is a boy with immeasurable power. And there is no better person to help him use that power for good, to make sure it doesn’t corrupt him, than you, Dean.”
"I'm thinking that's what's going to happen." Calcifer explained, running his finger down the soft brown line once more. "I'm feeling a little bit of a swelling. His second set, the third and fourth wings, must be starting to grow right now, and will come in pretty soon. Within the year. The third set, his fifth and sixth wings, might take a little longer."
"There was an accident." Tobias explained, wringing his hands as they walked. "He's getting better. It's hard time traveling like a hundred years, okay?"
Cas stroked his brown hair again. "Shhh. It's okay, Tobias. Almost over." He said soothingly. "I'm here. I'm not going to leave you."
The two brothers simultaneous whipped their heads to the source of the noise. Sam's gesturing hands were frozen in place, his mouth hung just slightly parted. Both the brothers had the same question burning in their minds, which was
"What? You don't like my singing?" Calcifer began to laugh light-heartedly, his hazel-golden eyes crinkling up at the corners. Dean decided maybe he wasn't that bad of a guy. Still, he was beyond relieved that Chuck offered to take the guy in.
The most ironic part is I'm the closest to being human as I have been in centuries and they're treating me shittier than I when I was even a demon.
"-But also to scold you." Cas followed up, staring into the distance with his hands resting on his knees. Clearly he was uncomfortable with this, since he usually left these kinds of conversations to Dean, who had already technically raised a kid.
"There's nothing wrong with you, Cas." Dean felt his own ears and the back of his neck beginning to get hot. "Just... yeah. You're all right."
Dean pulled over in the red, sprinting to get to the two of them across the busy road. "Cas! You can't just
He was in a bed and he was shirtless, he could tell, and large strips of cloth were wrapped around his pectorals and thickly padded along his shoulder. His jeans were gone, too, he was just in his cotton boxers.
"Well, I haven't heard her be called anything else." Calcifer laughed. "The curse of the nicknames getting to you, Cassie?"
Dean rolled his eyes. "First of all, most of this stuff they don't need anyway. Some designers made cute stuff so parents would spend money on it." He looked at what Cas was holding.
"I am only talking to you. And I didn't think I was preaching." Cas cocked his head to the side. "Oh. Metaphor."
We had stew for dinner. I have to admit the food the eldest Winchester prepared was actually quite good. At least, when I had a taste of the stuff he made for the rest of the bunker. I knew he still did things like burn food or put too much salt to spite me.
"Kay," Red nodded furiously and came closer. Bobby pressed his newly budded wings to the pillow and frowned at Red.
Castiel closed the door behind him as gently as possible, it clicked into the latch with barely a sound.
"Cas!" Dean screamed out, grabbing the shirt by the nape of the neck and forcing him backwards. Cas's jaw was locked as his pain-filled eyes bored into his now-bloody face.
"It's called a mobile." Dean explained, tipping something into the cart as Cas wheeled after him, Dean crossed something off the list.
Bobby didn't like the expression on his grandson's face. "I know something's been going on with the angels, but I'm not quite sure what." Bobby lifted an eyebrow. "Tobias..?"
Dean chuckled. "You won't be saying that after hearing those beans shake around nonstop for the first day."
The second punch hurt less as anger pumped through his veins. Silver sparkled back at him, finally obscuring much of his reflection. But not all of it.
"Yeah. Like how baby birds have to fight themselves out, or they'd be too weak." Kevin piped up. "At least, I think. I was kind of more of a nose-in-a-book kid anyway."
"Thanks, Sam. I hope we can find it." Chuck let the angel in the room wrap his arm around Chuck's shoulder and lead him gently into the next room. "Maybe once I remember I can start to fix all of this."
"Very," She answered uncertainly, looking up to his face and swallowing nervously. She looked to Sam's discarded right arm as it sat on the operating table.
"Still not talking." Sam echoed back, his eyes pleaded with Dean to adress the elephant in the room. "Dean-"
"I was not trying to spite you." Cas blurted, his expression extremely guilty as he dipped his head.
Dean left to get the babies dressed, and Sam gently pushed the child's damp hair from his forehead again.
Dean locked his jaw. "You don't think I'd understand?!" He shot back. "Cas, I've had to be an adult since I was five years old! And it sucks when I gave up my own childhood so Sam could have one!"
He saw Metatron when he sliced the angel Castiel's neck and his white grace curled into the vial like mist. He watched as, with the tap of a forehead, the Scribe sent Castiel to be splayed out on the earth, used and tossed away like garbage. He watched as Metatron harnessed thousands of graces from the spell, white mists flowing up as the Scribe stood in the center, the garden of heaven, graces in lines rushing towards him from all directions like a flower blooming in reverse.
He was in the pajamas Cas liked the most on him because it matched his eyes, a cerulean footsie with tiny white sailboats, and he was sitting on a soft yellow blanket. The baby stared up at Cas with wide eyes, chewing on his balled up fist absent-mindedly. He was sitting up on his own, but wasn't showing any signs of wanting to crawl, unlike his brothers and sister who had been off like rockets.
He looked over to Cas, who was happily and gently washing baby Bobby's light brown hair in gentle circular motions, white suds floating down like snowflakes into the sink-turned-bathtub. He had a tiny smile on his face as the two tiny brown wings flapped and splashed water around noisily. Dean didn't know how Cas was going to take the news.
Sam shot me a glare and stood up as well. Kevin especially held my gaze, until I actually began to feel hot under the collar.
"Everyone looks at me like I'm a frickin' national hero." He said glumly, and reached for his small first aid kit where he kept the band-aids. "I hate it."
“You know how much I love seeing your face.” The angel argued quietly, landing another noisy kiss, squeezing out lubrication to slip down his crack.
What was he supposed to do now? He was dangerous to himself, he'd be dangerous for these little angels...
"You're so gorgeous," The angel breathed as he finally stood before him, Dean seated at the edge of their bed. Dean looked up the distance and the angel slipped his cheek into his palm, skimming his bottom lip with his thumb. Dean let his plush lips open slowly, teasing the fingertip with a soft amount of wet suction. His lids fluttered shut, a sudden pang of intense shame passed through him. He felt like he was acting exactly like what his dad had always warned him against.
Dean hoped for his sake Cas would ignore the pang of subtle jealousy that felt like it came out of nowhere.
"What about Joshua? Or Inias? They seemed alright. I'm sure we could find them somehow." Sam pressed, but Dean locked his jaw and looked away. He tried to think about what Cas's reaction would be, but chose to think about something else immediately. Just thinking about the pure pain in those already haunted blue eyes...
It seemed to be perfect timing- when they arrived one day, the house was completely abandoned, collapsing tents still out in the front, flapping in the wind, the front door held ajar, and everyone was just gone. No angels, no Chuck. Sam even put out a missing person's report, but with no luck.
Hell, Dean's hygiene probably wasn't that much better than his, after living for his brother and his brother only during his painstakingly slow and rocky recovery.
." He said aloud, picturing the odd looking bloody blush on that girl's face and the wing that whiplashed her and that O of surprise on her lips from that god-awful disgusting mouth. He laughed even harder.
The doorbell? Bobby pulled away from his wife, his eyebrows knit together in confusion. They hadn't had any visitors here since...well, ever. Whenever he visited someone else, it was usually Ellen and Jo and Ash and Pamela down at the roadhouse, it was also where Ash's technology was set up, and they never came here to their boring old house.
"We had morning burgers." Jack piped up with a grin. Dean chuckled, then swiped his mug off the table to bury his face in it with a loud slurp.
"I had a nightmare." He whispered, and Chuck crouched down and cupped his hand on his cheek, gently smoothing his thumb over the soft skin. This always seemed to calm them down.
My guilt was the worst part of this prison. For example, I hadn't thought about when I'd consumed that angel egg since I'd done it. And now I couldn't take my mind off of it.
Tobias frowned. "Yeah. He's been..getting better. In fact, I gotta get back to him right now." Tobias frowned just thinking about it. He and Red were born first, an even though Red had been a few seconds before him, Tobias had always been the tallest and strongest (being an archangel) and always felt like the oldest of all his siblings, that he always need to take care of the other three.
Dean looked down and flipped one of the pancakes. "So, you're making, like, a scrapbook or something?" He tried to hide the smile from creeping up onto his lips. "So I guess you've gotten used to the fact you're gonna be a dad?"
"I'm not too good with my words, Cas, okay, you knew that." Dean cleared his throat and his hand was gone once again, leaving a sudden coldness in its absense. "Just- come talk to me. About anything, anytime... I can't...I can't lose you. Not after everything."
The two of them stared at each other for a second, Dean blinking and Cas not. "I don't want to make this..awkward for either of us, I mean, we're stuck with each other no matter what, so.." Dean began again.
"Okay, so, Sam put this together for me. At least they don't eat, so stuff is going to be cheaper. Like, no bottles or diapers or whatever." He unfolded the rumpled list, and read down it. Cas then took it and squinted at it.
Chuck's front yard was littered with tents. People milled about, cooking things in cans over fires. This place looked like it had turned into a gypsy camp overnight.
Cas frowned. "Another sister I killed. One that meant a lot to me." He indicated to his eye, the one that had dibbled blood down his cheek the time he'd been controlled.
"Hello, Earth." Metatron smirked. "I'm not sure we've met. My name is Metatron. And I am your new God."
. I knew that wasn't true. And I'll be damned if I let this darkness rot you from the inside, either." He practically snarled that last part. He wrapped his own arm up too- which was strange to see, since he usually healed himself in less than a second.
Chuck ran a hand through his hair. "Uh...I couldn't say no? I just can't turn them away, Dean, I'm sorry."
Dean settled hunched in front of his bathroom mirror, craning his neck to watch the Youtube tutorial on his phone as he tried to follow along with the steps in his own mirror, combing the spoolie delicately through the hairs.
He groaned as his shoulder was nudged. He was especially tired from the babies sucking the energy from him. He came to half-awareness, he knew that Red and Bobby were still sleeping and safe in his arms, and Dean nudged him again.
"Oh, but Rico's always has the best dumpsters!" She laughed and rested her cheek on Sol's shoulder. "I'm sure we'll find a better place."
Dean and Cas didn't say anything to each other at dinner. Neither did Kevin as he noticed that the two men were fueding, even though he'd been planning for a long conversation. Dean had his arms crossed, while Cas avoided everyone's gaze and was looking at his plate of food only, the noodles slipping off his fork time after time and flecking red spaghetti sauce everywhere.
," Dean said all in one sigh, whumping Cas in close to his chest and squishing his nose up to the top of his head. Dean brow's crumpled together, as he rocked the hug faintly side to side. "Thank fucking God."
"I'm sorry, Cas. It's just...I've never dealt with an egg like this before." He straightened up and wiped his eyes. "Sorry I laughed at you."
Little things unfolded at first; Cas strangely strengthening the veil between them when he saw Dean's body in the mirror after a shower, small droplets of water clung to the tannish skin of his shoulders, his thighs were shiny with water and the dark brown curls of hair down between his legs trailed up into a thin happy trail on his slightly soft tummy. "What'smatter, Cas?" Dean chuckled as he rubbed his hair dry with his towel. The angel didn't reply at first.
jealous, huh?" Dean smirked. "You never seemed like you understood the whole one night stand thing, anyway."
Dean spent a second thinking. He finally turned away, throwing his hands up in defeat. He couldn't believe he was doing this.
"Much better. Thank you, Dean." He kept his head bowed as Dean carefully spread the antibiotic down along his back. Dean carefully rolled the gauze down the cuts, finally covering up the angry red with clean white. His fingers dragged gently down the ex-angel's smooth, tan skin by his spine, and Cas shuddered. He must not have done that on purpose. Cas felt the stickiness as the tape was stuck into place, Dean ripping and tearing it with his teeth. Cas watched, his eyes a bit glassy. Dean held the roll up to his mouth and met Cas's eyes, ripping another piece of tape loudly.
Cas slipped his arms around Tobias's lower ribcage and flattened his palms on his back. He didn't know what to say for a second. "You're...very tall." Cas mumbled awkwardly.
"Come inside. I have a bed ready for you," She quickly ushered him inside, helping to hold him by the shoulders. Cas collapsed on the bed, and threw up more blood and bile onto the wood floor. Cas groaned and his head lolled back into the pillow. Even he was having a hard time with this failing body.
Both Kevin and Dean broke into a grin. "Oh, you're going to love Red." Dean said. "Let me go get him. He's with Sam."
"Maybe you weren't very horny after all. Just lonely." Cas restated. "Although I don't usually have sexual desires, living in a human vessel I have experienced libido before, which I believe you call 'being horny.' It did not feel much like that. Maybe you're just..emotionally horny."
Chuck had been sitting on the front steps, and when he saw the old Impala rumble up he perked up and rushed towards the car.
"Half past midnight, Sam? Really?" Dean scolded, and came up to clap his hand heartily to Jack's shoulder. "C'mon, kid. Curfew."
"Oh, isn't he a sweet little thing!" Chuck said happily, poking the tiny fat cheeks and laughing at the surprised look on the little one's face. "Please, come in." He opened the door all the way and escorted them to the living room, where four angels had been sitting and talking amongst each other, empty cups of coffee on the dining room table.
"No." Dean barked out, maybe a little harsher than he'd intended. "We can't do that to him, Sam. Have you seen how he clings to that thing? It wouldn't just be losing his children, Sam, in some way, it would be like the final blow to losing his grace for good." Just saying it out loud gave Dean a big spike of pain in his chest. He clearly clung to that egg, and not because he was
'You're really gonna wear that, Cas?' There was an unintelligible mumbling, and then a very uncertain '
"I didn't tell you because... I don't want to hurt you again." Jack blurted out. "Take too much again- I felt like a vampire. I just couldn't stop. I don't mind living like a human if it means I don't have to hurt you, father."
One sense of entertainment was trying to figure out what was going outside the dark, iron walls of this dungeon. I'd only heard tidbits of conversation to let me know that the little fledglings had hatched.
When the angel had embraced him from behind, the motion of his black-feathered wings followed his arms, wrapping Dean up securely within their damaged feathers. Most of them were missing, and they were criss-crossed with many scars, bald patches that might never grow feathers again.
Old Woman Kitty next door shook her head. "That nutjob." She muttered in a wavery old voice under her breath, continuing to crochet.
Dean was only half paying attention as he pulled food from the shelves, a can of tea for Sam, some of those sugary candies Kevin liked to munch on while he worked. Some Bisquick for breakfast pancakes for the family-(wait, did he just think
He closed the door as quietly as he could and clunked down the stairs, ready to go to the store and buy a dozen cartons of eggs and start pounding out omelettes for a couple hours. "What have I gotten myself into?" He muttered, dragging his fingers through his unruly hair.
"Yeah, Lee. A really bad guy." Dean replied. He locked his jaw, his hands twitching into fists for a second. "His name was Metatron. Remember that name."
"Dean, if you break your hand doing something as stupid as punching a wall, Cas can't heal you. Jack can't harness his power well enough either yet, so just calm down, okay?" There was a moment before Sam spoke up again. "Cas is resting, and he's perfectly fine. Maybe you should join him, see that he's okay. Let that sink in. You could use the rest too."
“Eileen! How’s it been?” Dean pulled the female hunter into a quick hug, before holding her out at arms’ length in jest. “Sammy tells me nothing; still got all the important parts?” He put on a look of mock concern, seconds away from playfully patting her down for bullet wounds.
“Dean?” Curiosity mixed with confusion filled Cas’s voice, causing Dean to look up through his lashes at him. He wasn’t surprised; this was so unlike them that he almost didn’t believe it himself. But he found his voice, not at all shocked by the sultry tone it held.
Dean sighed. “I didn’t mean... Yeah, you’re right. But come on,” Dean shot a look to Sam that begged him to agree, “he knows how I feel about using him as bait.”
Ignoring the growing ache in his knees, Dean bobbed his head slowly in time with the distant sounds of the bar’s music. One hand stayed occupied on Cas’s cock, the other came down to palm himself through his jeans. A groan in both pleasure and frustration caught in his mouth, the vibration causing Cas to echo the sound. Dean tried to stay focused and ignore the building ache in his groin. As hard as he was, he wanted to give this to Cas. There would time after the case for more, he would make sure of that.
“Dean…” His stomach dropped, the hairs on the back of his neck standing on end. The voice was so weak on the other end that Dean nearly didn’t catch it. But he would know that gravelly resonance anywhere.
Cas’s eyes flashed with defiance and Dean felt himself cower under the gaze just slightly. “Dean, you will not attempt to decide for me what I can and cannot do. Furthermore, the spell creates a new angel, not a Nephilim, so while I cannot be certain, I do not think the process will bring harm to me or our child.”
A clarity flashed in Cas’s eyes that almost had Dean spooked. “Dean, you are a fledgling!” Dean just stood there, feeling the blank look that was plastered on his face deepen, not even attempting to understand what Cas was trying to say. At least Cas knew him well enough to elaborate. “When heaven was first formed, the angels were, for a time, fledglings. We were unaware of how our corporeal bodies worked and what we would be required to do in order to feel comfortable.”
Cas stepped into his husband’s arms, feeling the urge to comfort him. Dean wrapped his arms around his waist, pulling them back into a pair of chairs, a look of exhausted happiness on his features, his forehead coming down to rest on Cas’s shoulder.
“It’s quite simple, as you can see, Dean.” Cas’s voice was soft, no judgment or harshness at Dean’s ineptitude. But Dean still felt overwhelmed and shrugged, containing his desire to touch.
“There are no options, Sam. We have one: we wait for Cas to wake up.” Dean started to turn away, obviously already done with their way too brief talk. Sam knew they had to do this though, so he spoke as he reached forward to grab Dean by the arm, trying to stop his brother from running away from him too.
He stood, taking his still-full cup back to the coffee pot, miming pouring himself another cup. He had a serious problem and he had no clue how to handle it: he hadn’t told Sam yet. He kept trying to over last three months, promising Cas “Today I’ll tell him”, but it wasn’t that easy. How was he supposed to tell his little brother that he was in love with their best friend? He didn’t have a problem with what they were doing, it was the whole chick-flick feel of telling Sammy that gave him the cold sweats.
Cas looked back at Dean, his fingers freezing as he tried to thread his belt through the loops. “What do you get, Dean?” He seemed almost as frustrated as Dean felt, but the hunter didn’t quite understand why. Cas was the one standing and putting his clothes back on, not Dean. Why did he feel like Cas was agitated with him, too?
“No, Dean.” Cas took a moment to study his husband’s face, never having been so sure of a choice in his life. “If I take that, I will be an angel again.” Dean opened his more to respond, but Cas placed his hand on Dean’s cheek and he kept going. “I know it would make this life with you easier. You would feel safer knowing that I had angel grace to protect us. I would find comfort in knowing that I could keep you safe. But one day, hopefully far into our future, you will die. And I cannot take this gift knowing that I would live on for eons without you. I choose you over eternity.”
“I mean, not really. Sam just… set me off.” Dean winced at the tugging he felt in his chest. He was starting to regret biting his brother’s head off. He saw the knowing look in Cas’s eyes and he sighed as he rolled his shoulders another damn time. “Ok, maybe I’m irritable. So, sue me.” He wanted to come off abrasive, to get Cas to leave him be, but he wasn’t feeling it.
“The word he said. ‘Euterpe’. It’s a name.” He handed Dean a sheet that depicted a Grecian statue, a woman in flowing robes. Too bad the writing was in Greek, too. Dean handed it back without a word. Sam continued, for which Dean was grateful. “She’s the muse of music. Sister to Calliope.”
Dean pulled Cas back to him, capturing his lips again in a moment of panic. He wouldn't give Cas a chance to mistake his worries for more than they were. As he pulled away, he rested his forehead against Cas’s. “I want to, Cas. Definitely.” He breathed, trying to work up the ability to acknowledge the problem that was slowing him down. “I’ve just, never, you know...” He pulled back, hoping Cas could understand his hesitation. He had thought about it all in the past, but Dean had to acknowledge that he had never been with another guy before. It seemed like it couldn't be that different, but it still scared him just a little.
“Angel Radio. I’m surprised Cas didn’t hear it and protect himself.” Gabriel looked like he was angry again, both on behalf of and because of Cas. Dean didn’t exactly begrudge Gabriel the emotion.
“Cuz you’re the nerd.” Dean couldn’t help the jab in his anxiety, but thought better of it after it left his lips. “You’re faster and I need it fast.” He almost told Sam that it had been Cas on the other end of the call just minutes before, but he selfishly decided not to. As much as he knew his brother cared for the once-angel, he also knew Sam would want come help find Cas with him, and he just couldn’t see Sam yet. He still had too many regrets that he couldn’t face while trying to stay calm for Cas. “A hunter I ran across during a hunt went missing and that’s his number. Text me the coordinates. Thanks.” He was already in Baby’s driver seat as he ended the call, giving Sam no further chance to refuse.
“You’re telling me I’m going to be a dad, Cas?” Dean was surprised at the apprehension he saw in Cas’s eyes.
Dean had finished his lamenting lyrics, head now hung back to press against Cas’s hand, shoulders shaking violently as sobs wracked him again. Sam gave him a few more moments before faking a too loud conversation with Jody, giving Dean enough time to compose himself if he chose to. But as Sam commented, “Dean, look who came by to see us,” with too much fake nonchalance, Sam felt crushed by the fact that Dean looked up without wiping his eyes. He wasn’t trying to hide his tears like the brother he had known his whole life. He was breaking, fast, and Sam was powerless to stop it.
Cas had been secretly practicing Dean’s song for a little over the last two years, knowing how much it would mean to his hunter.  While Dean had seen him tinkering with an old acoustic they had found while on a hunt, Cas had been very careful to keep his intentions a closely guarded secret. He had intended to play the song privately for him on his next birthday, but when the opportunity had arisen, Cas couldn’t pass up the chance to break out his full rockstar. From the look on Dean’s face, Cas knew he had made the right call.
“Dean, the doctors said 48 hours-” Sam broke off as a fist collided with his jaw. Dean’s fist, to be exact. He staggered back, stumbling to catch his balance against a table. They were lucky they were nearly alone in the cafeteria, a lone nurse now watching to assess the situation.
Cas’s eyes softened as he met Dean’s gaze, who knew he probably looked about a second from running and hiding. “It’s quite simple, I assure you.” Cas stood, walking towards the door of the kitchen. He looked over his shoulder, a quick raise of his eyebrow telling Dean that he needed to follow the angel.
"Sunshine, it’s almost time.” Sam could hear the tears in Dean’s voice. “I want you to know that I love you, and I’m sorry I didn’t say it more when it would actually mean something.” Dean sounded like he stopped for a second to take a breath, maybe wiping at his eyes. “I want you to know I won’t be mad if you need to go, Cas.” Sam looked over his shoulder, seeing Dean holding Cas’s hand to his lips in a kiss. “I understand if you don’t have any more fight left in you. I’m not sure I do, either. But please. Please, my angel, if you can, stay with me. I can’t… I can’t do it without you anymore.”
Dean took a breath to steady himself, “Cas, I used to hate that I was brought up in this life. I used to curse my father for the choices he made,” Dean would later regret forgetting that his father was now standing in the congregation, getting thrown under the proverbial bus, but he would also be glad that honesty was how he chose to begin his marriage, “but standing here, looking into your eyes, I can’t be angry anymore. I never would have found you if I hadn’t lived the life I have. Never would have finally realized the gift I had standing right in front of me, the love I felt and could be given. Even if it took us a hell of a long time to get here,” they both laughed at that and Dean felt Cas reach forward to hold his hand, “I wouldn’t change a second of it for the world. And while I know our future will be as uncertain as our past, I can promise you that you will always have me to fight by your side. Hand in hand, we will take whatever comes our way. I love you, more than you will ever be able to know.” Tears threatened his vision, but he clenched his jaw to fight them away. Never again would he go a day without telling Cas in words, not just actions, just how much he loved him.
Dean cut him off again. “Whatever, Sam. I ain’t giving up on him.” Unshed tears lined Dean’s eyes, and now Sam wondered if they were from anger or sadness. “So, you can stay or go. But I’ll be in his room.” He started to turn away before surprising Sam by turning back. “And if you try to talk options again, Sam, I’ll kill ya.”
“He should be out by now. They said he’d be out by now.” Sam flicked his eyes toward the clock, not wanting to admit that Dean was right. When they had arrived, Cas had immediately been taken into the emergency room, hospital staff ushering the brothers and Eileen into a waiting area, telling them to sit tight and they would be informed as soon as the staff knew anything. Sam had foolishly thought that those first minutes would be the worst.
He wanted to say he was calm and collected, not at all bothered as he felt Cas’s strong legs surround his hips. He told himself that he didn’t even notice the weight of Cas’s ass on his thighs. He definitely didn’t feel Cas’s groin press down into his bare ass, the fabric of his slacks rubbing against his skin, as Cas bent forward to reach for his wings.
His gun was drawn and he looked ready to shoot at a second’s notice, but he stood frozen as he took in the sight before him. Dean knew it was a good one. He was still naked, just barely saving face by a lucky placement on the sheets across his groin, Cas still wearing his slacks but definitely looking like he was ready to take Dean for a ride. Dean noted that thought for later, as that definitely seemed like something to add to his to-do list.
Cas refused to remove his eyes from Dean as the hunter came back to the bed, walking around to the opposite side from Cas, fearing that he would disappear if he even blinked for a moment. Dean lay down on top of the comforter, laying his head back against the pillows. Cas let instinct move him toward Dean. He stretched out next to Dean, close enough that he could lean in and kiss Dean’s shoulder if he chose. Dean pulled Cas by the shoulders, bringing him across to press their chests against each other. Their lips met again, bringing small smiles to both their lips.
Finally, thank you to the mods for the Dean Cas Reverse Bang 2019 mods. They have been so helpful, and none of this would have happened without them!
It has been a while. I'll admit, I'm not proud of it, but between working and studying, I hadn't had the most memorable times to myself. I wrote this between writing an essay and working, but seeing as I am on my day off, I've decided to indulge myself to a little treat. For those of you wondering (you're not), I did watch the last season. It was very unfortunate and very bad. I hated every minute of it. I cried. I spent a week crying every time the words "it's in just saying it" came into mind. I hope you are all well, vaccinated and healthy. I would not be writing this if not for your interest. Enjoy it!
“I think you’re trying to say that in the bad days you feel... lost? Overwhelmed? You might think like that, Dean, but it isn’t right. It's like trying to sabotage yourself. Do you feel like that on the good days?”
writer's block is a fucking BITCH. thank you so much for the kudos and comments, i love validation so much and i love you! this chapter is a little shorter, and i added another one to the fic (sorry), but this one is kinda ok, i guess, sorry about it guys :(
He got up and grabbed some tissues, along with antiseptic for Dean. He cleaned both up and laid down again.
The next night, Castiel found himself trying his hardest to pick the most presentable clothes. He should’ve been a little more prepared for a date. Well, technically, for a date he was. He just decided to wear his skinny jeans and a Taylor Swift t-shirt his sister gave him (shut up). He made sure to wait till nine o’clock to go, since all the counselors decided to be responsible now, so everyone was already “sleeping". At first, all he saw was dark. Looking closely, he could see a... Jack-o-lantern. Dean was sitting on the grass, leaning on a tree, next to a pumpkin.
Although the wind was chilly, he didn’t feel very cold. This part of town had many lakes and woods, so he got used to the constant wind. He sat on his chair and just looked at the moon, drinking his coffee. He let Blue Oyster Cult’s ‘(Don’t Fear) The Reaper’ play in the background.
they belong to this thing and it has black wings. Unnatural. an abomination between those around him. And... And he looks at me with those bright blue eyes, I mean
“It’s good. Great, actually. I think Hannah is very good with her method, so... I've been getting better. That what you wanted to hear?”
. Dean brokenly moaned his name, softly. He started to move his head rhythmically, but still slow enough to enjoy it; the taste of precum was bittersweet, and
I was, was the real me, and no one questioned it. If I were cruel, they’d just say, ‘oh, that’s just Dean. That’s how and who he is, now’. Don’t get me wrong, my family was very understanding, but if I was still angry, it was probably because I was an asshole, not because of my condition; and they didn’t believe me because I was
.  Undead. He didn’t want to close his eyes, but he didn’t want to keep them open. It was too real, too close. But then again, he switched medication, he had a mental illness, he could easily be hallucinating.
With that, Dean went to check the curtains on the living room, and Castiel knew he’d check the whole house. He made his way to the bedroom, carefully, looking down. When he entered, he didn’t dare to turn on the lights. He knew exactly where the bed was. He sat down and patiently waited. He heard footsteps approaching him.
“It helps. I’ve been taking Valium and Lithium. Lithium helps with the mania and Valium with the anxiety. They’ve been great, honestly. The Venlafaxine has also been helpful; I’ve been taking it for years. Since I’ve been diagnosed, actually.”
He thanked her, his smile beaming and his cheeks hurting from smiling so much. He was having a nice week. There were no dreams and midterms were over. His students were exhausted, so he dismissed them from his class this week, but assured them he would stay in the classroom during their break in case any of them needed guidance or help. Before he started with Dr. Milton, he looked her up on a website. He knew which type of psychotherapy she performed. He knew all of them. When he was 13 (going 14) and his parents decided to take him to therapy, they did
They took the car and stopped at the Roadhouse, Dean was the one to get out and make their orders. Charlie opened her best smile and gave him a thumbs up for ‘taking one for the team’.
He couldn’t focus on anything anymore, but at least he was still able to reply to his family messages so they wouldn’t worry. Sam was coming next week. His brother was still a wreck, he was glad his mom was able to stay a few weeks with him. He honestly didn’t know how he’d hide his insanity from his brother. Not that he’d need to; Sam knew what happened to him, he had told him when Sam was old enough to understand why he’d sometimes wake up sad.
Dean smiled at him, calming him down. When he finally settled inside of Castiel, Cas moaned and wrapped his legs around Dean’s waist.
someone mentally ill. It's ok to say ‘I’m sorry I acted this way. I'm working to get better.’ they’ll try to be understanding of you and more patient.”
“And how did you react to it? What did you think, at the time?” Her narrowed eyes examined him with a puzzled expression on her face.
The next few days were spent avoiding his friends until he couldn’t anymore. He felt trapped inside a board game in which devils and angels were playing with dice, screwing with him, and obviously, the demons were winning. When his brother came into their cabin that night making him get up and go to the bonfire to play truth or dare, he should’ve known they were going to mess with him, as usual. He wouldn’t tell anyone, but he changed into his nicer clothes before going (black skinny jeans and a blue shirt). When he got to the bonfire, he had to take a deep breath when he looked at Dean. He was wearing blue jeans and a led zeppelin shirt, his eyes shining in front of the fire, the most beautiful smile on his face.
He nodded at her, letting the words sink into his brain. Looking at the clock, he realized their session had ended. It was about time, he thought.
The next few days, he felt relaxed and even motivated. He wasn’t used to feeling like this, these days. Classes were back on track at full force, and they’ve started on a few subjects already. He was proud of his students.
Sam called a few times, so did his mom. He felt better, he said. He wasn’t lying, not this time. He was still a little numb, but he was getting better. He looked at the time on his phone and took his pills out, taking one at a time. Every time he took them, he felt bad. Like he was a fake and he had to force his brain to function properly. Negative thoughts aside, he swallowed them with water and got back to reading his students’ dissertations. They were getting a lot better on developing the subject, and he took a moment to feel proud of himself – as a treat.
His chest hurt; his breathing wouldn’t return to normal. He couldn’t pick a better time to crumble down. At least semester was over.
He was very well aware of the implications in getting close to this mortal, but how could he not fall into temptation when Dean looked so holy to him, yet so devilish. So tempting to
“That’s what I thought. It's not a bad thing to enjoy the good days, nor the hypomania when it comes. Turning the bad into ‘not so bad’ is a way to start coping. You've been dealing with it for so long, you’ve eventually came to terms with your temporary limitations, although I don’t like to call it that. You respect your own boundaries, and that is how we work them through time. But on the bad days? It's normal to think like that. You've dealt it for so long, wondering if it will ever stop is ok. You are
Silence stretched uncomfortably between them, as Anna looked at her own hands on her lap. She lifted her eyes to his face once again and smiled. “I came here because I couldn’t come on the parent/teacher conference. Sorry about that, by the way. My brother, Cas-” she stopped abruptly and coughed. “Sorry. My brother was supposed to come, but you know how it goes. How is Anael going?”
In the distance, he heard a wolf howling. The wind blew harder, the whooshing sound getting heavier in his ears, as the trees moved along to it. He felt his skin crawl as his neck bristled. His fingers pressed the mug a little too hard. He refused to get up, it was just the wind.
also, trigger warning for mentions of self harm scars, so beware. (if you have any trouble with it, let me know!)
They both knew what they were doing, and they knew it was wrong, even it being with each other was this right. They couldn’t. Dean couldn’t.
There were no words that could describe the hollowness in his chest, the churning in his stomach right now. He’d schedule an emergency appointment with Hannah tomorrow. He had to.
“I missed you so much. I missed your body, your hair, your mouth and that sinful lips and ass.” Dean said as he thrusted fast and deep, the sound of flesh echoing through his room.
Charlie snorted and smiled at him. She shook her head and turned her eyes back to the TV. “We should do this more times.” She said softly.
, he brought him back, he put it together piece by piece, atom by atom. Oh, to fall for such a gracious being. Falling to his knees, begging for forgiveness, for redemption, for love once again was his perdition. Dean Winchester was his doom; he always would be, and Castiel would gladly accept it. He’d fall, he’d rebel, he’d fight wars for this one thin, for his love to walk among men again, for once this man was his perdition and his salvation. He’d promised Dean he’d come back; so he would.
Dean was speaking naturally; he’d rehearsed the words in his mind, played the scene over and over again.
Looking directly to Dean’s lips, as Dean looked into his eyes, he lowly asked, “Is there anywhere we can go?”
. His disdain for the humankind grew, even if he knew he was not supposed to. He wasn’t supposed to interfere with their history, to judge, to laugh; after all, Heaven had its own peculiarities with power and control.
He put his hands on the waistband, stopping for a few seconds before going through with it. breathe in, breathe out. He took it off swiftly but didn’t motion to get in the water. Instead, he looked down his thighs. They were still scarred. Angry, straight lines still marked his skin. He couldn’t help but feel disappointed. His scar from the day he fell riding his bike after his mom let him go on two wheels was gone. The one he got on his left knee when he ran to his dad to hug him after a long day at work was gone, too. The one on his lip, from when he decided he had to have a lip piercing and made Ash pierce him while Charlie and Jo watched and it went horribly wrong, because he ended up with a bleeding lip and no piercing, was gone, too. Those were his favorites; they reminded him of his youth, his innocence, simpler times.
Or so they thought. Castiel’s brother wrath was bigger, brighter. Michael forbid him to ever go back. To taint himself and that
That night his friends were at his cabin playing D&D, and since he didn’t know anything about it, he went outside to read. Sitting on the stairs, he took a moment to admire the tress around him, noticing a body by his side. Dean was sitting next to him now, staring intently at him.
Then, came the animals and the insects. Animals big enough to reach the top of the beautiful trees, insects big enough to hurt those animals. Castiel watched it be destroyed.
He’s not lying. Lithium has been great. The side effects were horrible, but once it settled, it was fine. He noticed the changes, and so did Hannah. He missed the days he felt invincible. Drinking in bars, hooking up with whoever would have him. Not being fragile.
Balthazar said in a playful tone. “moreover, Sam, I dare you to take the hand of the prettiest person, in your opinion, and take them to the lake for a swim. Sam’s face reddened and his eyes looked like they could pop out of his skull anytime now. Dean was trying his hardest not to laugh, again, as Cas and Charlie watched intently. Sam got up and went to Gabriel, reaching his hand out to him. Gabriel smiled widely and got up, taking Sam’s hand into his making their way to the lake. The rest of them stared at them smiling, watching as both boys swam. When they got back, Balth spinned the bottle once more, watching as it landed on Dean and Gabriel. Oh, shit. Gabriel looked at him, grinning in such an evil way.
Monday found him sitting inside his classroom drinking coffee silently as he read a book after classes. It had been a calm day; students weren’t giving him any trouble or being loud. In fact, everyone was tired and sleepy. He talked to them about their assignments, how he enjoyed reading each one of them and they had improved in their writing; then they were dismissed. Dean still hadn’t found the courage to get up and go home, deciding to finish passing the grades on to the school faculty once and for all, so he could be free to hang out with his brother with no worries. While he wrote, he heard a knock on his classroom door.
His brother looked sadly at him and sighed, once again looking defeated. “I understand. Kali will be here soon, and so will Sam.”
1953 years after Jesus Christ. Anno Domini. He was a man, then. His green eyes could easily be compared to the green of the most beautiful of the rainforests in a sunny day. His lips, soft as pillows. His body, not even the most beautiful figures made by the best sculptures in history of mankind could compare. But his
He entered the room, scanning it as he walked through it. He hoped he wasn’t here. He prayed. His brother spotted him from afar, a soft, sad expression on his face told him what he didn’t want to know. Gabriel made his way to him, as Castiel’s posture straightened and he got a serious expression on his face. His stomach churned.
The next days passed in a blur, and he accepted his sealed faith and stopped avoiding his friends. The camp had officially started, other kids arriving earlier that week, the counselors thankfully letting themselves choose their groups. A few girls were making a few remarks about wanting to kiss the “blonde boy in plaid", and really, who else could it be if not Dean? He was close to losing his shit, the dude was bisexual after all. Hell, he was jealous.
Dean winked at him before turning his back and leaving, as Cas kept looking at his back, waiting for Dean to be joking. After a few minutes alone, he realized Dean was serious. God, his chest tightened, tears welling up in his eyes and his throat burned, the taste of Dean still lingering. He was just waiting for Dean to cut him to the bone, and he really did. He sat down on the grass, taking in what had happened. Realization settled in as he put his hands on his face, trying not to cringe at his stupidity for developing feelings. He was falling in love with Dean. Dean, who was sweet and caring, and so patient. So beautiful. God, he really was falling for him, and if that wasn’t the worst thing Dean would ever hear, he didn’t know what would be.
“I’m fine, Sammy. Just been busy with finals and grading assignments. You know I always get busy this time of year. This isn’t why you called.”
It was a black and blue figure, standing still in the distance. The glowing blue came from the eyes. Yet, it still looked like a shadow. Entirely black. It was too far away for him to make out any other details. He should get up. He should go inside and lock the doors, pray one Our Father and go to bed. He could hear his catholic guilt begging him for a Hail Mary on his knees.
knew could be real. All in all, humanity was progressing very fast in science, but not so much as a society. He knew not to interfere, for they were to be left alone. He felt disdain for those creatures.
? Wait. Apparently, it wasn’t a video game. It was a PC game, online. Dean still didn’t know what it was. He’d ask Sam later.
When he first saw Dean Winchester, he was on Earth exclusively for guarding a door to hell. He was there for what humans would describe as two
Later that day, Dean was sat on his sofa comfortably as his best friend talked throughout that episode of Buffy; he was listening (kind of) as he took in the details on the TV, and if you saw him crying over Angel and Buffy breaking up on her prom day, you’re lying. Charlie was lying down, her feet resting on his lap as they ate ice cream, her bright red hair falling down the couch’s arm rest. She talked excitedly; her mouth full of chocolate ice cream as she gestured with her free hand. Dean always thought she looked nice; warm and inviting, always so extroverted, even if she was quiet. Her smile was always encouraging and kind.
Dean hung up his phone and stared at the clock in it. 3 PM and he was still at the school, grading the assignments. Time is a social construct, but geez, it is a pain in the ass, Dean thinks as he corrects the essays.
Since I'm a nice person, I (badly) wrote some smut for you. I hope you guys have a nice week and keep taking care of yourselves.

A river flowed through the path – one he didn’t have to follow. The water was clear, transparent, and seemingly free of fishes. It wasn’t flowing violently; there almost wasn’t any current to begin with. He could feel the wind piercing through his skin, could hear the leaves moving on top of him, the crunch beneath his feet. Everything was green, so green, so alive, yet so
“At this point, I feel like it traps me. At the start, it was good to have a mental map of what to do, when and where. I felt calm and relieved, now I feel like if I don’t follow it, I’ll have a mental breakdown. Those are worse than panic attacks. But even if I didn’t have it, I’d still freak out.”
things. I don’t know how or why, but I feel my heart beat faster than ever and my stomach does this... this
He didn’t know where to go from there. He just kept staring at his shoes, avoiding his therapist’s gaze. He took a breath and said what has been haunting him for years: “I think that what hurt me the most back then is that, even with my meds, I still had anger outbursts because we hadn’t found a medication that worked specifically for that. But everyone thought that that
“After I came out of the bathroom, the kid approached me and thanked me. He looked relieved and calm. His name was Samandriel. Jo was pissed because the guy threatened to sue, but everyone threatened to call the cops on him for sexual harassment. She sure didn’t appreciate the violence, but she wasn’t mad at me.”
some students looked him up on social media, he knew it was time to give it up. Or that was his poor excuse.
Castiel took his underwear off, throwing it somewhere on the room. Dean’s dick was right in front of him, fully erect and leaking. He wrapped his hand around it, hearing Dean’s gasp and small moan. He looked at Dean’s face, his eyes staring intently into Dean’s. He slowly licked Dean’s precum, then wrapping his lips around the head, his tongue pressing against it. It pulsated inside his mouth as he put it entirely on his mouth, almost gagging when the tip hit his throat.
It was the 28th, a Friday night. He felt the cold wind breeze through his curtains. As he laid awake, agonizing over his persistent erection, the moonlight came from his window, lighting up a big part of his room. He wanted to die. He wanted to die from the sexual frustration, how pathetic was that? The house creaked beneath him, the wind howling, and the trees creating shadows on his floor. There were not many stars tonight, he noticed.
