They were silent for a minute, John returning to a safe topic. “And your parents -- they're well?”
John grudgingly accepted the roundabout apology. “Are you two always like that?”
John saw a wolvish expression cross her face, her words dripping with innuendo. Was she implying —? John suddenly felt his face and neck flush and he quickly excused himself. He walked out onto the back porch, breathing in the cool evening air. He ran a hand through his hair, pushing it back from his forehead.
cook," John pointed out, dipping out a ladle of broth and easing it into the pan. He stirred the rice.
“Have you seen Molly?”
John thrills at the mere suggestion, wanting somehow to do both. But he has to choose. “I want to fuck you,” he manages to pant, “like that, with you on top.”
I could feel Sherlock scrutinizing my profile, and I exhaled a little shakily. It was time for me to say it. I turned my head to face him.
“Where--”
Sherlock's long fingers splayed over John's cheek, gripping into his hair.
What would John's face look like when he breached him for the first time? How would it feel, taking in John's length? What sounds would they make, John pushing deeper, drawing back and sliding in again, thrusting over and over until they were both senseless?
Watson.”
“Good, thanks.” She shook his hand, her earrings sparkling as she tossed her hair over her shoulder. “Nice party, isn’t it?”
John gazes down, mesmerized by straining fabric and dark curls and gorgeous hands and soft nape. He often steals moments like these, attracted, conflicted, unsure about what he should do or about what Sherlock feels or doesn’t feel.
His expression shifted from surprised to grateful to nodding speechlessly. He fumbled open a box of condoms, his hands shaking a bit.
John envisioned drawing out the length of Sherlock’s tie with one long, lascivious pull. “Seeing you in a tie is giving me a hard on.”
There is a corresponding light pressure on his calf, and Sherlock laughs. He’s clearly losing his mind, dreaming up dead soldiers.
John wasn't sure what she meant by manage, and he frowned a little. Doubt nagged at him, but he really didn't want this opportunity to slip by. Besides, he'd lived and worked with all types of men in the army in much closer quarters. The real deciding factor would be if he could afford the rent. He rubbed his forehead, uncertain what to do. His leg was starting to throb and his head hurt.
“Who knows? A bird startled from its cover, a car backfiring on the road, someone riding by on a bicycle…"
John swallowed, waiting on tenterhooks for what Sherlock would say next.
“Oh,” John simply said, startled to find himself against the purple shirt that he’d noticed far too often, engrossed by the buttons straining over flexing muscles. And damn if Sherlock didn’t smell amazing, the fragrance of expensive cologne and hair product so close to him, heated by the visibly beating pulse in Sherlock's neck.
“Come on, John!” Molly teased, now several lengths ahead. “Keep up!”
“Hello, Sherlock.”
Silent, he traces his hand over Sherlock’s shoulder, down to the bullet scar on his chest. He’s afraid, he realizes, of breaking some spell, of bringing down the wall that separates their two worlds, unleashing a flood that might drown them all.
They sat in silence, and John looked around Sherlock's boyhood room. Bookshelves lined with novels and textbooks, a wooden model of a sailing ship, seashells, a desk with a study lamp, a microscope, an old, sepia-toned map of London.
John nuzzled the nape of Sherlock’s neck, holding him, warming him.
John waited uncertainly for Sherlock to say more, but he added nothing. John huffed out an uncomfortable laugh, rubbing his temple. “Look, this is extraordinary, don't you think? Meeting again like this?”
They settle under the covers, their heads propped up on pillows.
Sherlock wasn't drawing away, John registered, but was leaning down, their lips inches apart, the room fading away to the narrow focus of their warm skin and breath and searching eyes.
Sherlock’s hands curve possessively around John's flanks, his thumbs pressing into the sensitive skin of his inner thighs. He’s mesmerized by John's face, the dark lashes, the wrinkle in his furrowed brow, the soft space between his parted lips, a balance of tension and sensuality just before reaching climax.
He had seen John eat, drink, nap, shave, pee (the bathroom door was admittedly quite transparent), read, and type, but he had never seen John cook quite with this detail or complexity before. It made the ordinary -- here Sherlock grasped for the right word again -- intricate. Sensual.
John takes his coat, drapes it over a chair to dry while Sherlock drops an overnight bag on the dresser and goes to look out the window. John thinks he detects a slight limp to Sherlock's gait.
Sherlock gripped the sheets as John's mouth continued to explore the tender skin of his inner thighs, fingers curving under his arse, sliding up and teasing over his perineum.
John resurfaced to the present. There had been a few other fleeting encounters with men over the past years, always furtive, never lasting. It was curiosity, desire, playing with fire.
Sherlock grinned at him. “Mycroft does tend to overdo things.”
“Take a break.”
John stopped, pressing against the wall as people hurried through the lobby, worry rippling through the air. He closed his eyes. “I want to see you, too.”
John held his wine glass by the stem, massaging Sherlock's foot under the table. “I might go with you.”
He flicks his eyes up and they catch my gaze. I’m caught unprepared, unguarded, every agonizing desire etched on my face. His hands go still, his eyes lock with mine.
Sherlock didn't resist, stretching his frame along the cushions, gingerly placing his head in John's lap as he held the handkerchief against his lip to stop the bleeding. They were quiet, watching the shifting flames and embers.
He curled his hand around John’s cock, hard and thick and heavy in his hand. He shivered a little when John grasped him in return, his prick swelling within the hot circle of John's palm.
“I’m sure.”
“You were an arse,” John teased. “But you were unforgettable.”
is what he had come back with?
John stared after them, just as surprised as Molly had been.
“Hello, John.” Ian Dimmock held out his hand in greeting.
Tonight, Sherlock would welcome a deep rest. He tipped a few drops of oil into the bath, then twisted the taps shut, slow drips from the lip of the faucet punctuating the sudden silence.
Sherlock smiled wryly. “Is that what you think my suits are — bespoke armor?”
“Are you afraid?” Sherlock asks.
“John—” Sherlock’s neck was craned around awkwardly, but he let it fall back to the center when John’s hand curled around his side. “Oh.”
“I’ve had no complaints,” John laughs. He faces Sherlock, a smile playing over his face. He brushes a stray curl from Sherlock’s forehead, then kisses him again.
Sherlock closes his eyes, his breath shallow, the water raining down on them. He’s surprised again when John draws away and the taps twist off.
It’s something else -- something he’s carried with him since being shot, since seeing Sherlock fall from that roof, since Mary’s betrayal -- fear. Terror, if he’s honest, of losing control, of being swept away and devastated again by someone else’s actions. He can’t expose himself like that again, won’t let Liv be pulled under by the dangerous currents that swirl around the edges of Sherlock’s life.
Sherlock crosses his heart, then waits a few minutes until he’s sure they’ve left. He springs up from the chair and quickly gathers a few supplies from the cabinets, then takes the elevator up several floors to a vacant lab where he occasionally works. He stashes the supplies in another cabinet, then checks his watch. Just after midnight.
Mycroft lets out an irritated huff. “I said,” he speaks slowly, as if to a dimwitted child, “I have good news.”
Sherlock’s fingers are still propped under his chin. “Honey and lavender.”
He folded the letter with stiff fingers and placed it back into the envelope, telling himself that it didn't necessarily mean anything.
“But you already know me.”
Sherlock’s eyes searched his face, and John paused, taking in the heady scent of smoke and sweetness of clover, the dewy beads of perspiration on Sherlock’s upper lip, the dampness of his hair, the hum of bees thrumming in the air.
John rubbed his face and sat up in bed. There was no use ruminating about it all now. There was a full day ahead, and he had plans to visit a few surgeries to inquire about work. He needed to bring in some money to supplement his pension.
The flat was in a central London location and owned by a sweet and slyly libertine landlady, Mrs. Hudson. He had helped her with a problematic ex-husband, and in exchange she had reduced the monthly rent. She lived downstairs, sometimes popped in with tea, and said nothing about Victor’s odd visiting hours.
He could hear himself moan through the waves that pulsed through his body, was dimly aware of John kissing him on the neck, of warm come streaking his stomach.
A chocolate shop caught Sherlock’s eye, and they were soon crossing the street. Sherlock selected a bag of sweets that they shared, eating them quickly before they melted in the evening heat.
Harry worked from home transcribing legal documents of some sort, and would often take me to coffee shops or museums or a movie when she needed to get out into the real world. People sometimes assumed we were mother and daughter, which I secretly enjoyed.
He finally cools, cleans himself up, and rolls back into his pillow, half asleep. Tomorrow he’ll borrow John’s laptop, copy that photo, search the files for any other material of interest. John can’t know about this, his military fetish. It’s far too intimate.
Sherlock took a risk, seeking an anchor for hope. “Maybe you could come back here for Christmas.”
John gazes up at Sherlock, content to be trapped under his lean frame. “Some things got solved, don't you think?”
“Um, yeah. I've never had such a nice pair. I just… sort of tried them on.” John scratched the back of his head, trying not to look at Sherlock's gorgeous hands. “They’re really… luxurious.”
John pulled back slightly, surprised. He traced the tendon in Sherlock's neck. “Alright,” he finally answered, his voice soft. “I think I'd like to know, too.”
Stupid, so stupid to even let his mind wander that way. Sherlock's passion was his work, nothing else. He'd been very clear about that from the beginning. Here they were, alone, but Sherlock was focused solely on the investigation, caught up in the case.
“Here we are. Must have slipped out of your pocket when you sat down.”
“If Olivia were with you, you would have used the front door.”
Even though she's 16 and quite capable, Olivia is staying with Harry for the week. John calls her every day while he’s gone to check in and chat a bit. He hasn’t mentioned Sherlock, of course; he’d only said he was going to a lengthy conference in Barcelona. Olivia hadn't seemed particularly interested in his trip, merely nodding when he told her. Fair enough.
He takes a step back, trying to shift back to being a doctor. “You’ll feel that for a few days.” He means the fresh stitches, but his fingertips burn with the memory of warm skin.
Sherlock pulls John closer, a hand curving around one firm arse cheek, locking away the inexplicable, choosing to focus on the tangible. “I thought for a moment it was a mistake coming here,” he admits. “But I was wrong.”
“Oh, work, work, work. There’s more to life than that.” She lets out an exasperated breath and looks like she’d like to say more, but restrains herself. She smooths back her hair with one hand.
Some part of him grew aware of a presence in the dim room, the lifting of the single sheet, the dip in the mattress, someone climbing quietly into bed. John stirred, surfacing as cool knees tucked under his thighs, a warm chest molded against his back, an arm drifting over his hip.
John’s mouth curved up. “I do. It’s just that you’ve taken off your armor.”
It didn't matter, because at that moment Sherlock walked toward him and smiled warmly, beautifully, the smile that was given just for him, and John smiled back, wholly, unconditionally, certain that Christmas would be particularly memorable this year.
“Please, call me Irene.” She smiled graciously. “I like detective stories.” She flicked her eyes at Sherlock. “And detectives.”
Sherlock watches him leave, teetering somewhere uncertainly between hope and hopelessness.
“Hey,” John says softly. “How are you feeling?”
Sherlock moved to the other nipple, lapping it to a tight bud. John’s fingers wended into his hair as Sherlock moved his mouth down his torso.
Seeing it through new eyes, Sherlock had to admit it had a certain beauty. For once, he kept his sarcasm in check. “It is, in a way,” he agreed. “Where did you grow up?”
The country manor they're investigating dates back to the late 1700s. It's grand but drafty, rife with heavy doors, fireplaces, ornately carved mantles and dark woodwork. Modern amenities have been added over the decades, and it now serves as an inn for those who enjoy long rambles along the moors. Somewhere in its long history, along with proper plumbing and electricity, the house has also acquired a ghost.
Sherlock shifts a bit, moves his leg, and shifts again, exhaling impatiently.
, only on John's eyes, the sheen of sweat on their bodies, the power of his hips rhythmically lifting and dropping.
This was what he had craved -- the unpredictable -- and now it was happening. He tensed, suddenly unsure how much further he wanted things to go.
“Too hard?” the masseuse asked.
Warmth flooded Sherlock’s body. He turned in John’s arms, capturing his bottom lip between his own, his hands running over John’s back. He wanted to feel every inch of John again, relearn every muscle and dip and curve.
“We’re here!” John shouts back. “The door won’t open — the lock’s jammed.” He smooths down his disheveled hair, cursing their bad timing.
John smoothed his hair back from his forehead. It had grown long in front, the wave of silver-blond contrasting with his dark blue eyes. He stilled, letting Sherlock look at him at his leisure. John was not shy about his appearance -- he was no bodybuilder, but he was fit and tanned.
The bottle tips over with a crash, rolls toward the edge of the table, scotch glugging onto the surface. John’s free hand shoots out to stop the container before it smashes onto the floor, sets it upright. The bottle is ice cold. John lifts his hand quickly as if he's been burned.
Sherlock was about to turn away when something about the American made him linger a few moments more. It was the way he stood admiring the villa, a smile on his face. He removed his sunglasses, squinting against the light, and closed his eyes for a moment as if drinking in the sun. He looked… grateful.
John laughed, playing along. “I'm sure they won't mind me being AWOL for several years.”
Something about the man’s stance caught his eye, making John pause. Then his mouth fell open. He walked haltingly toward the bar, staring, needing to be sure.
A smile spread across John's face. “Some of us have to.”
Nothing like cutting to the chase, John thought with disappointment. “No, no. We’re just friends. I can give you her number, if you want.”
Sherlock looked down, smoothing the sheet with his hand. “No. They'd throw me to the wolves.” He kept his eyes down. “I can tell you that I used to have a nice little consulting business in London.”
John's jaw tightened as his eyes burned into Sherlock.
John senses when Sherlock’s legs begin to tire. He moves his hands higher to Sherlock’s back, bends upward, and flips Sherlock over in one swift move. John gathers him in his arms, finds his mouth, lavishing him with passionate kisses. He slips his cock back into the hot sheath of Sherlock’s body, Sherlock’s legs wrapping around his back.
Sherlock rubs his jaw, tilts his head. “Have I ever told you... I like your hair this way. It's good.”
“The driver told me that’s where it happened,” she continues.
Sherlock finishes up and slips on his jacket, then leads the way through the door to the elevator. They don’t talk as they make their way outside, although Sherlock notices John keeps pace with his long stride despite his limp.
“Your turn,” John said. “Confession time.”
“Go down on me,” Sherlock gasped. “Do it.”
“Tomorrow,” Sherlock sighed into John's neck, hands smoothing over his back, taking measure of his shoulder blades beneath his pale blue shirt, “I’ll buy you dinner.”
They look at each other for a moment, and he's sure his face is betraying something that he can't control.
“Are you keeping track?”
Perhaps best to ignore it and just go home. John is busy talking to Molly, so he could slip away without any more awkwardness. Sherlock’s eyes rove to the door, then are caught by the appealing arrangement of refreshments set on a table. He could use a little something to eat…
Many hours later, Sherlock made good on his promise to buy John breakfast. They stopped at a small cafe where Sherlock sipped at a cup of coffee and nibbled on a sandwich while John tucked into a shepherd’s pie.
Sherlock snatched it from the man's hand and tore it open, unfolding the letter with a snap. He scanned the paper quickly, his expression changing several times.
Sherlock hunched over his plate, absently pushing around bits of egg with his fork. He wasn't hungry, still preoccupied with the afternoon among the hives. The lingering kiss had unfolded several days ago, and he not yet come to a decision about John. Temptation and prudence were tangling inside of him, a clash of want and caution. It was exhausting.
“Hannah, really.” Sherlock keeps his voice calm. “There must be a logical explanation.”
“Good.” He pretends to be absorbed by the article pulled up on his laptop, but he can’t concentrate. The words swim in front of his eyes, his mind constantly returning to the night before. Hannah finally walks away, leaving him to brood.
“I used to search for shells here,” Sherlock said. “I pretended I was on a desert island.”
Holmes smiled a tiny fraction more. “I’ve been stuck in the countryside for three weeks. I could do with a distraction.”
He's pulled from his reverie when the cab eases to the kerb, the engine idling. He pays and exits the car before he can change his mind.
John relaxed his grip on his fork and remembered to breathe. "I do, too."
John leaned in again, finding Sherlock's mouth. Water lapped the shore, Sherlock's hand curling around the nape of John's neck, the tips of their tongues grazing, slipping deeper.
****************
Several heartbeats passed. Sherlock covered my dad's hand with his own and closed his eyes. He leaned down, resting his forehead against my dad's.
Sherlock's grin broke into a smile, and John was suspended for a moment, stunned by the apparent cure of his leg and the pure beauty of Sherlock's expression. It was a genuine smile that reached Sherlock's eyes, sketching dimples and creases over his cheeks.
Sherlock was silent, his lips parted, color high on his cheeks.
“I am not! My dad knows him. They're friends.”
“Listen,” John scooted closer. “I have an idea. I'm going to Rome the last three days before I fly back.” He squeezed Sherlock's leg. “Come with me.”
John drifted into a vision of a rumpled bed somewhere, Sherlock caressing his injured shoulder, lips on his neck, legs straddling his hips...
John pressed himself up onto his hands to gaze into Sherlock’s eyes. “Touch yourself,” he encouraged.
John rolls his eyes, and Sherlock hooks a lanky leg over John’s, sidling up against him. “Of course it was a highlight.
I fell willingly into an all-consuming world of trying to make friends and finding new music and keeping up with schoolwork and wearing glittery things, experimenting at being a Normal Girl. I floated from group to group, trying to find a tribe, hanging out with the theatre geeks in the autumn, then sneaking cigarettes with the rough crowd in the spring, joining the swim team the next year.
John turns toward him. “What exactly do you do?”
She tapped her chin with her finger, forming a plan. She checked her watch. Yes, she would have time. They never got home before 10 o’clock these days. Humming to herself, she bustled downstairs and headed to straight to the storage closet.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock has taken to trimming his hair shorter, taming the wildest of the curls, but it suits him. He looks elegant, distinguished. John savors the thought of disheveling this well-dressed, rather refined creature across from him in the cool privacy of their rented villa.
John glanced to his left to see who had spoken. He first saw the long brown hair, then the pretty eyes and warm smile, then recognized Sarah, a professor of internal medicine. They’d met while serving on the same curriculum development committee. He straightened up, extending his hand. “Sarah, how are you?”
John shivered, marveling at the way Sherlock’s enormous hands easily spanned his back. He worked his palms under Sherlock’s wool jumper and thin T-shirt, finding skin, curving around his waist, slender and solid and hot to the touch.
“Better,” Sherlock acquiesced half-heartedly. “Keep going. You're doing fine.”
without becoming irrationally angry. He'd heard the phrase far too often until it became meaningless and maddening. He cleared his throat. “Yeah, well, the army patched me up and invalided me back to England. A warm bed and a clean room is all I'm looking for at the moment.”
They both turned their heads to where Molly was standing by the red blanket now laden with food. Sherlock looked back at John, wondering what to say.
“John…” Sherlock moans his name, a plea for more.
The entree -- local lamb, new potatoes -- led to John's Army days, Sherlock’s past studies in chemistry.
“Ready?” I ask, the word thick in my throat.
John watches them from his vantage place in the kitchen where he has placed the empty tea cups near the sink.
John could sense Sherlock's arm next to his, their legs almost touching. He could think of nothing to say, his skin aching to make contact with Sherlock's. He held back, waiting for a cue, a sign that he should turn his face, move his hands.
Sherlock wanders back to the library, starting to tire from all the exertion. He’s about to settle back onto the couch when a gleam of light across the room catches his eye.
Sherlock looked at the envelope again, not sure what to say. “Thank you, Mummy.”
“I was so impressed with both of your latest publications,” Mike interjected quickly, trying to avert a disaster. He nodded at John. “Your analysis of exit wound tissue damage,” he then nodded at Sherlock, “and your study of rare subtropical poisons — both fascinating. Such informative perspectives you each bring from your respective expertise in medicine and chemistry.”
He raised his hand and rapped sharply on the wood with his knuckles, then waited.
He's not ending their relationship, just questioning it. Putting it into a state of suspension for a period of time while he thinks.
“Relationships aren’t that easy,” Harry continued, seeing the doubt on my face. “Sometimes the timing is all wrong. And sometimes, even when you get it right, you mess it up anyway.”
Sherlock welcomed John's change of heart, the secret fondling, the flirting. He wanted it. Tonight, John would be seated next to him for hours in the theatre, their arms and knees touching in the dark, anticipation building. He knew what he wanted to happen next.
John smiled. “This was my last obligation for the day. I’m all yours.”
have time for a break,” John murmured, fingers sinking into plush, bare buttocks.
Sherlock glides silently across the deep carpet, the smell of wood polish and tea and wool overcoats lingering in the air of the silent club.
Mrs. Holmes now stood by the window peeling off her driving gloves, prattling on about how the neighbor’s dog had been digging in her flower garden again, ruining the delphiniums.
“Oh well. Maybe it's nothing.” She took back the empty glass. “But I do have another favor to ask.”
“You're in a risky mood,” John murmured, sliding his lips to Sherlock’s neck and pulling delicately on his earlobe with his teeth. “What daring thing shall we try tonight?”
Sherlock veered his bike onto a small dirt path that split off from the main road. He didn't know where it led, but in the distance he could see an abandoned stone barn and stand of tall trees. He headed toward the trees, coming to a stop in a glade of long grass dappled in shade.
“Well, then. Get in.” Sherlock swung his legs up and slid over to the passenger seat, acting more confident than he felt.
“Yes, sir,” I mumbled. Stupid Sherlock Holmes, getting me suspended.
“Oh, I just thought you might have heard of something. It's always difficult to find an affordable flat in London. Not to mention trying to find work. I was just reading this morning that more than 2 million are unemployed, and it's expected to go higher. Terrible, isn't it?”
“Come in.” He sat up, rubbing his neck.
“You've got a letter,” John announced, “and a Christmas card, I think.”
Sherlock did as he was told, cautiously curious as Mr. Holmes carefully removed the cover of the hive.
John decided it would be best to try to ignore the exchange of looks in the changing room. “Are you having anything?” John tilted his head at his almost empty whiskey glass.
“Your phone,” Sherlock says. “In case Olivia needs something. You should have it close by.”
“Ready?” John asks.
If John was surprised at the swift change in Sherlock’s demeanor, he voiced no sign of objection. He returned the kiss eagerly, his hands sliding down Sherlock's hips to cup his arse, fingers dimpling into the lush flesh.
He raises his glass in a salute and we take a swallow, letting the whiskey burn a trail down our throats. We fall into silence, staring into our drinks, watching the flames dance in the amber liquid.
“I’m not sure I like bees,” John mused.
“Really? I thought it might look a tad familiar.” The corner of Sherlock’s mouth lifted in a slight smile.
And so he didn't speak. He stopped hesitating, and tipped.
Sherlock recalled their conversation at the beginning of the summer when Molly had said she'd wanted to be a physician but was pushed into nursing by her mother. “Good for you,” he said, impressed.
“What is it?” John tosses the log onto the fire and moves quickly to Sherlock's side.
Sherlock wrinkles his brow at John, who has been out of sorts all day. Sherlock wonders if he has done something to anger him. He thought John might enjoy this little adventure, ridiculous as it is, looking for ghosts.
The paper fluttered to Sherlock’s desk. He sat in his chair, trying to remember how to breathe.
John comes to say goodbye when Mrs. Hudson moves from her tidy flat on the ground floor to go live with her ailing sister.
Once the fire is going, Sherlock stands up and brushes off his knees. “Sit down, John. I’ll have a drink, too. The basement can wait.”
John smiled in spite of himself. “Fine. We’ll have cake, then let’s get out of here. I think we might have the lake all to ourselves tonight.”
He doesn’t know how to process these secret desires, apart from sometimes waking up with a raging boner that he swiftly dispatches with a fistful of fantasies about pale skin, stormy blue eyes, long fingers, and perfect lips wrapped around his —
“You're a good friend, Molly,” he said softly.
Sherlock tries to smile, torn between happiness and a sense of impending loss. “I know. I knew.” He takes a breath, unsure of time and tenses. “I should have said it too.”
He couldn't help but remember what else John had said:
Dad nodded. “Lestrade sent up two more cold cases after the holidays. Couldn’t have thought of a better present, really.”
“I'm not an officer,” John protested.
“Why, may I ask?”
“Of course.”
Later, he forced himself to dress for dinner and join his family at the table, not wanting to start another round of trouble by being absent. With all the attention on Mycroft, Sherlock barely ate or spoke, slipping away as soon as possible.
“Oh, I see,” John grinned. “I think we’ve discovered a fashion fetish.”
“I have a note for you, sir.” The driver held out a creamy white envelope.
“I don’t bite,” Sherlock whispers, inviting John to complete what he desperately wants but is too afraid to consummate.
“Ever see a murder investigation in action?”
“You mean he was a spy,” Sherlock says.
Sherlock peeled off the heavy gloves and rolled back the netting from his face. “I had no idea it was so intricate,” he said thoughtfully.
Sherlock met his gaze, supplying the perfect answer. “Come back to my place,” he said softly. “I owe you another favor.”
John sighed. Bloody stupid peas. He began rummaging through the cupboards. A tin of beans. A box of vegetable broth. Stale biscuits. Rice. Arborio rice, to be precise.
“It can be. Although most cases boil down to one of three motives: money, jealousy, or revenge.”
They fumble through digits and contact lists, then slide into an awkward silence, the evening suddenly drawing to an end.
Music thrummed through the floorboards and a woman’s laughter floated up from the courtyard below. Sherlock tugged gently on the chain, pulling John closer.
“It's long. Three and a half hours or so.”
John shrugged. “I was feeling a little out of place. They’re young.”
Sherlock checked his hair, pushing back one errant curl that tended to dangle over his forehead.
Sherlock looked up, intrigued. “A heavy book?”
I was so busy negotiating my own inner and outer life that my dad became a peripheral object; always there on the edges, but no longer my central focus. There was always something more important. An essay to write. A boy I liked. Swim practice. A pair of shoes I really wanted. Exams. A first kiss, dry and unmagical. More kisses, a broken heart. Sad music and bad poetry. Discovering I liked to write, but feeling conflicted because I also liked science. I was mildly panicking at having no idea what I wanted to study at university. And then I was suddenly 17.
“You never know. Could be a broken love affair. A disgruntled employee. Drugs.”
Tommy howled out in pain and stumbled backwards as boys and girls jeered and shouted excitedly at the fight. Several teachers rushed over and waded through the crowd, one seizing me roughly by the arm.
His closely guarded hope that he and John might be something more than friends has dimmed over the years, but has never been extinguished. There are tortured midnight hours when Sherlock wishes that insistent small flame would die out for good and leave him in peace. But a flicker of foolish hope burns on, kindled occasionally by inexplicable gazes or unexpected touches from John.
Victor turned to look at him, then moved to the side of the bed. He trailed his fingers over Sherlock's cheek.
“Can I go on?” John murmured behind Sherlock’s ear.
******************
“In fact, I moved in with him the same day, hardly knowing a thing about him. Just some mad scientist who likes to play the violin.” John holds his breath, wondering if he’d just given away too much.
Sherlock's voice played in John's head, and John half smiled, knowing he was exaggerating the peril of the situation. He often carried on internal conversations this way, imagining what Sherlock would say. They'd known each other long enough that his ability to predict Sherlock’s responses was uncannily accurate.
He liked books, but he loved music and science more. He had gravitated toward chemistry during the last few years of his schooling, an interest that baffled his parents, though they supported his choice.
John thought about it carefully, deciding to take the chance. “Alright. I could have a look at it over break.”
After a long pause, he scrubs the letters away, cleaning the window. He has a job to do. He needs to see the world clearly.
Sherlock stood gazing out the kitchen window with a tea cup in his hand, a dressing gown tossed over his rumpled clothes from the night before.
“No, John. Don’t be ridiculous.” Sherlock huffs out an irritated breath, fixing his eyes on a distant point over John’s shoulder. He can’t look at the carousel behind John, all garish colors and grotesque animals speared through with gilded poles.
She smiled, clearly flattered. “Thank you, sir.”
“Then stand up.”
“They’re not all murderers, I assume?”
A postcard
He reaches out, finds the bottle of lube in the bedside table drawer. He holds it, warming it in his hand. He lifts an eyebrow, his voice a velvety ribbon. “Shall I fuck you… or you fuck me?”
“I called the agent,” Hannah announces as she comes back into the room, her phone still clutched in her hand. “He said he’d have a look at the video later. He wants to check inside the house now.”
“How dull.”
John collapses untidily onto Sherlock's warm chest, and Sherlock's arms encircle him, their lungs working to regain even breaths.
Sherlock lets out a small involuntary sound and John glances up at him, his face flushing.
Sherlock had his bandaged arm outstretched on the tabletop, and my dad’s hand was extended toward it. I couldn’t see what he was doing, my view obscured by a pile of books and files. Maybe he was checking the bandage or taking his pulse.
“And they’re certain the hiker didn’t have a bad heart and collapse, hitting his head on a rock?” Sherlock suggested.
Sherlock loitered in the background as his parents greeted their new visitor, asking about the flight, the train ride from Rome, was he hungry, thirsty? Sherlock was finally introduced by his mother.
“Let’s go.” John headed down the stairs. Sherlock followed, confused but intrigued. They climbed into a black car.
“Christ,” I muttered, kicking the ottoman. I wanted nothing more than to get away from this place.
“They do, do they?” Sherlock murmured enigmatically. “You look older.”
“Why don't you go on cases with Sherlock anymore? Then you'd be in the news, too, and no one would say I was lying about knowing him.”
Sherlock pulls a face. “No… can you?”
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“Don’t change it,” Sherlock orders.
“Of course.”
John stayed silent, absorbing Sherlock’s words.
John paused, crossed his arms awkwardly, shifting his eyes to the side as if he wasn't sure what else to say. “Thanks for coming by.”
“Love you, too,” Sherlock mumbles in reply, clearly half asleep already and not really listening.
John exhaled audibly, his fingers fumbling at the buttons of his shirt, trying to undo them while maintaining contact with Sherlock's mouth.
The next to the last.
They stand awkwardly on the pavement, and Sherlock tries to salvage the situation. “I could do with a bite to eat.” He glances at John. “I'll buy.”
He stood for a long moment, then pulled out his phone. He held it, his fingers still stiff with cold, and pecked out a simple message.
The lights of a cinema marquee came to life, couples and groups beginning to fill the tables at nearby cafes.
Sherlock's hands were so big, so elegant. They were the type of giant hands that could cradle a person’s entire head during a searing kiss…
Sherlock ran a fingertip along the spine of the book he'd been leafing through. “Tropical diseases?”
It was the week before Christmas, the breakfast table a feast of fruit and eggs and pastries, fresh squeezed juice and strong coffee, friends and neighbors who dropped by to greet them persuaded to stay for a bite to eat.
An answer that is not an answer slides in beneath it.
John finally rolls to the side with a sated sigh, throwing an arm over his eyes. “Christ, your hand is big,” he says drowsily, but with admiration.
“Hold on — there’s a trick to it.” There’s a series of rattles and thumps as Molly manipulates the handle.
It's winter, a Saturday afternoon, the fire glowing in the grate. These are the moments when John is lulled into thinking of how good it could be, the three of them together, cozy and content.
“I like Molly, but not in that way.”
“The two of us,” Sherlock repeated slowly, “happened despite our best intentions not to.”
“There's a dance tonight at the social hall. Aunt Helen and I were asked by the refreshment committee to make some cakes. Would you take them there this evening?”
John splashed water in his direction. “It's not exactly warm, either.”
They discuss several theories, including the possibility that Dimmock and Nurse Cornish are involved, but Mycroft assures Sherlock that all the staff have met strict security clearances.
As he rode home, he felt warm, the taste of Sherlock’s kiss still on his lips. He marveled at how different everything was between them now, transforming from enemies to lovers in one semester. He silently thanked Mike Stamford for bringing him together with his arch enemy, serving as an accidental Cupid; Irene Adler for opening his eyes to his true desires; and Sarah for spurring Sherlock’s jealousy enough to get him to finally speak up.
“It’ll rub right off,” Sherlock murmured, leaning over to capture John’s mouth, his dressing gown sliding off one shoulder.
Sherlock tries each doorknob along the hall, some doors easily swinging open. He glances in, sniffs the air, assesses, then moves on. A few doors are locked, resisting the twist of Sherlock's wrist with a stubborn rattle. John scribbles a few notes about the locked rooms, lags behind, reluctant.
“Your father has dreamt up an idea for a proper path into the rose garden. There's a load of flagstones arriving Thursday afternoon that’ll need moving. If you and your friend could help, that'd be lovely. Help save your old dad’s back.”
John’s response was just as urgent, his fingers digging into Sherlock’s waist, his tongue plundering his mouth. John pressed him against the rough tree trunk, his palm groping between Sherlock’s legs.
John frowned at him, unable to decipher his meaning.
The corner of Sherlock's mouth tilts up, pleased. He shouldn't have doubted John. “Good man.”
“I’m fine.”
It's strange, how eagerly the public consumes the stories, yet he and John have become almost footnotes in their own history. He’s occasionally referred to as “the reclusive detective” along with his “author colleague,” the retired Dr. Watson. If the greater world has become aware of their cohabitation, it has done so with a shrug. Tales of gruesome murders, blackmail, and thievery are much more scintillating.
Anderson wiped his face, his scraggly beard dripping forlornly onto the table.
Once in the room, they reach for each other, not bothering to turn on the light. Sherlock presses John against the wall, mouth on his neck, hip bones digging into his pelvis.
John looked up, trying to place her, then took several steps forward. “Ah, yes…” he struggled for her name.
“You can.” John glanced up at him.
“This has to heal,” John said softly, running his thumb below Sherlock's lip.
Sherlock hails a cab and they climb into the back. Sherlock finally speaks. “You’ve been abroad recently.”
Sherlock nodded tiredly. I could tell from a distance how exhausted he was.
“One of the first deaths I ever witnessed was an old woman dying of pneumonia. I was working a late shift at the hospital. Her last breaths, the death rattle, were the most horrible sounds I'd ever heard.
Sherlock swallows, unable to gather his usual defenses of aloofness or disdain. He’s caught naked, vulnerable, his wits hazey, his emotions seeping through the bars of their locked cage like a mist. “A man. A good man.”
Sherlock raises an eyebrow. “Which is?”
The computer appeared unharmed, but he flipped it open to boot it up and check his files. As soon as he entered his password, the phone rang.
He comes, white hot, pulsing, streaking his stomach and fingers. He lies there panting, floating in his fantasy.
“John…” Sherlock said his name softly, ready to share his newly discovered realization, “I'm happy.”
I imagined he was saying,
Sherlock nods. He could do with some extra warmth.
She looked at him, tired. “I hope you succeed.”
Sherlock felt giddy spinning through the warm night, racing John up the final hill to the villa, winning by a narrow margin. Laughing, they propped their bikes against the shed, their legs weak, their lungs burning.
“Just preparation. Chances are I’ll be sent to India, maybe somewhere in Africa.” John picked up a pen and toyed with it, trying to push back a wave of doubt. “Sometimes I wonder…” he started, then stopped.
“Best of luck,” Sherlock replied, prompting John to shoot him a warning glance.
The lock gives way with a rusty screech and the door swings open. “Oh gosh,” Molly blurts out. “I should have warned you about this door sticking. Sorry about that.”
I’d only been home a week (much of that spent sleeping and roaming around the house at odd hours since my body didn’t know what time zone it was in) when I thought I might have to practice those sutures Dad had taught me.
John watched their reflection in the opposite mirror, the image of their greedy hands and churning hips turning him on even more.
“You were there at the beginning.” Sherlock’s voice was a soft rumble. “Remember the boomerang case?”
They straightened their jackets and ties, smoothed their hair, and cleared their throats.
The rhythm soon increases, the air punctuated by hitched breaths and small moans, squeaking springs and slapping skin. Sherlock closes his eyes, letting his body be used, pleasurably ravaged and plundered by John’s thick cock. He relinquishes control, shutting off his brain and offering his body as a vessel for John’s desires. He wants —
Mycroft hesitates but doesn’t argue. “I suppose I could do with some proper sleep.” He slowly gathers his coat, patting his pockets for his phone. “I’ll be back tomorrow morning.”
“Good enough,” Sherlock answers. John looks tired, and Sherlock feels guilty about involving him in his mistake. Oh god, and Olivia, who’s asleep upstairs. She shouldn't have been dragged into this drama.
John shakes himself, tearing his attention away from Sherlock. He adjusts the bat’s outstretched wings, then clears his throat, trying to redirect his runaway thoughts by needling Sherlock. “I really thought you’d be complaining more,” he says. “You must secretly enjoy this.”
“And afterwards?” John teased suggestively, nuzzling Sherlock's earlobe.
“Explain what?” John growled. “That you're a goddamn spy?”
Sherlock presses his lips shut, determined not to engage in this ridiculous conversation.
“I didn't open your letters.” A flash of cruelty swept across Sherlock's face. “I burned them.”
Sherlock explains his work yet again, steeling himself for a sarcastic or condescending remark.
John closes the few steps between them and reaches out to take the jacket.
*************
You’re always by the pool, sunning. And you’re exotic.
He groaned inwardly. A little voice in his head suggested that a roommate could be pressed into sharing housework and the shopping. Maybe it would be worth exploring the idea…
John rises to his full height. “We are
John stood on the porch, feeling like an idiot. “Okay... So let me know if you have any questions about my comments. I, um, I’d best be off.” He turned to go, wanting to crawl into a hole. What else had he expected?
John smiled again, pleased Sherlock wanted to continue where they'd left off. “I want.”
Looking closer, he’s startled to see a knife handle protruding from a bookshelf. He cautiously approaches, noting the way the blade is plunged between two thick books.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I do like your beard,” Sherlock admitted, trailing his fingers along John’s bristly cheek, curling his other immense hand around both of their cocks, stroking them together. “Makes you look distinguished.”
Mycroft was silent, his mouth a thin line. “Don’t talk. Go to sleep.”
It was ridiculous, the suggestion that he and Sherlock would ever have some sort of sexual relationship. He couldn’t even stand the arrogant bastard. Sure, he was incredibly good looking and his voice was like dark honey and he was brilliant, but there was no way that they’d ever hook up, not in a million years. Every time they were within 10 feet of each other they bickered. He was not interested in Sherlock. It was laughable. Hilarious, really.
Sherlock curled onto his side. “Stay with me.”
“Hm,” Sherlock answers. “Overdone.”
“Excuse me,” he says to John, then stands up and takes a few steps away to answer the call. He soon learns that Lestrade is at the scene of another murder with striking similarities to the current case sprawled across his wall. Sherlock listens, interjecting with curt questions, pacing the rug, his excitement growing.
John glances up, catching the way the light in Sherlock’s eyes dims. The mood shifts.
“Don't you just love to dance?” Molly asked, looking a bit enviously at the dancers.
John pinched him on the bum. “You're so modest.” He retrieved his trousers and pulled them on, slipping his shirt and shoes on next. He tramped off toward the boathouse while Sherlock got partially dressed, then gathered their remaining garments.
“Look,” John finally said, keeping his voice even. “We’re both stuck here, so why don’t we come to an agreement? I’ll take the office from 8 to noon, and you get it from 1 to 5.”
He reaches out to touch it, his fingers running down the dark wool. It’s dry. He’s been back for awhile, before the snow started.
John stood next to Sherlock. “What are we doing?”
“It’s not where I left it on the sofa. So clearly you touched it.”
He held the left glove, then tentatively slid his fingers into the opening at the wrist. The lining was plush, the softest cashmere. He pushed his fingers in deeper, his chest pulsing with a guilty thrill. There was something intimate, almost penetrative about the gesture. He slid the supple leather over his hand, a second skin.
Guilt seized Sherlock's chest. He was upsetting her, just like his older brother, Mycroft, always said he did.
Sherlock looks up quickly. Did he just speak? The captain holds his gaze, and slides his hand up higher, his fingers curving over Sherlock’s inner thigh.
“You’ll have to wear a tie.”
“Faulty wiring, drafty rooms, and forgetfulness can explain each of those phenomena.”
John reads the words to himself, listens as Sherlock disjointedly describes their mysterious appearance.
He went to the sitting room to retrieve his phone, pausing first to start the fireplace, welcoming the heat and glow of the flame. He picked his phone up from his desk, tapped in his passcode, and paused again.
“You're gorgeous,” John breathes, his lips on Sherlock's neck.
Hannah has retired downstairs to watch telly, just a button press away should he need her.
“What sort of good deed?” Sherlock asked suspiciously.
“Don't go…”
“You had a pair of jeans once.”
“What the hell--?” Sherlock turned to the clock. 5:11 a.m.
“Well, ‘hate’ is a strong word…”
“Sorry,” John apologized quickly.
We finally arrive at the flat and Sherlock stirs from his corner. While he pays the driver, I exit the cab and unlock the door to the flat, debating whether or not to wait for him. My nerves propel me up the stairs to the sitting room where I strip off my coat and pry off my shoes. I consider heading straight to my bedroom when Sherlock floats through the door, blocking my escape.
John kept his eyes on the horizon. “Do you ever feel like a fake?”
Sherlock lays back blissfully against the pillows, drawing circles on John’s back with one hand.
John kisses him hard, feeling like he’s falling into a void, his heart tumbling, the crudeness of his cock and hands and mouth the only means of conveying what he’s bursting to say,
There’s a rough sort of confession in Sherlock’s voice that heightens John’s senses and draws him closer. Sherlock is nearly naked in front of him, the long curve of his neck pronounced as he averts his gaze. John can smell the sharp, clean scent of soap on Sherlock’s skin, the slight almond sweetness of his shampoo. His chest is pale, his nipples beaded, his belly flat, a thin trail of dark hair leading to his groin.
Knotting the tie at his waist, he made a decision. He would text John and apologize.
His hands stilled, then he cleared his throat. “Anyway, you're trouble enough to keep me busy, aren't you?” He was teasing, and nudged my foot. “Go clean your room. I've got to call your aunt.”
“I hope to see you again soon,” he called as we tramped down the steps. From the corner of my eye I saw Dad turn and glance back up the stairs, his gait slowing to a halt.
He glanced up at me and smiled, then turned back to his keyboard.
“It was perfectly civil. His career took him down one road, and I followed another. We parted ways, just like you and I did. History does tend to repeat itself.” He stopped talking, his brain catching up with his rambling mouth. His fingers gripped the cup. “And now I just want to concentrate on
“And you've just showered. Worked a double shift.”
He was certain Sherlock felt things; they'd laughed together, supported each other, bickering and joking and working and sitting in companionable silence, exchanging thoughts with a glance or a shrug. They knew each other intimately, and yet they didn't.
“Nothing special.”
“Good. But don’t ever hit anybody again. Unless you have to.”
I was growing bored and decided to explore the house. I chose a doorway and followed a short hallway into the kitchen, then turned randomly into another passageway and up several steps. These old houses were like rabbit warrens, all twisty and turny. I hesitated at the landing, then my eye was caught by two figures at the end of the hall.
“That’s good.” She looks back at her magazine.
There were weekends when Dad would text Sherlock to let him know we were in the city and he'd wait for a reply, repeatedly checking his phone. Some days no reply ever came, and I could tell it bothered him.
He couldn’t help but glance across the steamy room again. Sherlock was standing with his back to him, his head bent down, fingers working at the drawstring of his boxing shorts, seemingly lost in his own thoughts. He shimmied out of the shorts, tossing them into his open locker. John gazed longer than he should have, soaking in Sherlock's long legs, defined calves, carved thighs, plush arse.
Sherlock let his words sink in, an unexpected balm on an old wound. He was too drained to pretend that John's apology meant nothing. He was tired of the strained distance between them, a gulf of past hurts and disappointments that required far too much energy to maintain.
“Me too.”
Sherlock steps forward, the skin beneath his shirt burning with regret and hunger.
John laughed. “Sure, why not?”
“That's exactly where you should be,” Sherlock murmured in return, his fingers wending into John’s wave of silver hair as John's fingers worked elsewhere. “You didn't finish.”
“I’m endeavoring to.”
“Why was Dad with you on a case?”
“Turn around,” John breathes, spinning Sherlock by the hips, their trousers sagging around their ankles.
It was the first time they had spoken about it openly, the impending end of summer.
In the weeks since that evening on the steps, they’ve graduated from aching kisses in the hallway to snogging on the sofa, rough groping, a hurried handjob. Time, there's never enough time. John slips away to Baker Street when he can -- after work, before a shift, once after the guest lecture at Bart's -- for 30 minutes, an hour, and then he has to go.
Sherlock peered longingly over John’s shoulder at the hall. “But what about cake?”
How was it possible that he had let go of this brilliant, luminous human being, only to be given a second chance? Time with Sherlock was a precious currency he would not waste again.
Sherlock looked at it for several long seconds. “Don’t post it on your blog. It’s too…” he trailed off.
Maybe it was foolish, allowing themselves to be tender like this; maybe they were just both imagining they were somewhere else, with someone beloved. It was a dangerous temptation to spin fantasies when you were tired and calloused and cynical. But it felt good, arms and legs wrapped around each other, too safe and soothing to let go.
When John awoke the next morning, he squinted at his watch, then snuggled back into the pillow. It was only eight o’clock. Then it struck him — he was in Sherlock’s bed, thoroughly naked. He turned over, only to find the other half of the bed was empty.
Sherlock smiles, not denying it. Maybe someday he’ll have the chance to tell John the story, to show him the diary and photographs. But for now he drinks in every detail of John’s face, watching him fade into sleep, his lashes dark against his cheek, listening to his breath even out to a slow and steady cadence.
Sherlock twisted to the left, pouring strong coffee into his mug, his hair enticingly rumpled from a late night of analyzing crime scene photos. He turned to look accusingly at John over his shoulder. “Why are you staring?”
The mattress dipped with Victor’s weight as he sat on the edge of the bed. Sherlock could barely open his eyes, but he wanted to see Victor again. He was there, smiling faintly down at him, still stroking his temple.
John’s expression turns more serious. “Do you have any regrets?”
“It's coming along very nicely,” Mr. Holmes said with satisfaction. “See how much they’ve capped off here?” He pointed to an area where the geometric cells filled with nectar were each neatly sealed with a cap of wax. “Once they’re about 80 percent capped, we can begin harvesting. We should be able to have a taste before you go back to uni.”
“You owe me a coffee for all this.”
He changed into a white button-down shirt and looped the one tie he owned around his neck. His fingers felt thick as he fumbled with the ends, and he cursed as he undid the knot for the third time. He hated ties.
He held a large peach in his hand, blushing pink and yellow, the curved dimple in its firm flesh reminding him of John’s round arse. He brushed the fuzz of its fragrant skin against his lips, remembering the botanical term for plants and animals covered with a fine down:
But when his eyes fell on Sherlock's tapered fingers, another wave of doubt flooded his system. Leaving Sherlock was going to be difficult, more so than he'd ever imagined. He tamped down the thought, forcing himself to keep things light. “You never bore me.”
He certainly can’t look down at Rosie’s expectant face, her eyes probably big and pleading, her small hand wrapped around John’s fingers, bottom lip no doubt quivering.
He types only one character and sends it to John.
Now he was here in New York, as promised. The landing was smooth, customs a blur, the cab ride into the city an overpriced impression of warehouses, tall buildings, a sea of taxis, a Starbucks on every corner.
They kissed again, softer this time, fingers gradually pulling at shirt tails, sliding off jumpers, working at buttons, easing down trousers, undressing. They lifted the bed covers, sliding under the cool sheets and the cozy weight of the duvet.
took fashion advice from
John blinks, clearly startled. He looks at Sherlock for a long moment. “Yes.”
Sherlock ends the call, then withdraws the three photographs from his pocket. He crawls under the bed covers, sifting through the pictures. His eyes soon grow heavy and he sets the photos aside, sinking down into his pillow, the gaze of J. Watson burned into his memory.
John closed his eyes, streams of water running down his arms and torso, winding down his thighs and calves, pooling over his feet. For a moment, he could indulge in the fantasy that the sensations were long fingers playing over his body, soft caresses. His hand drifted to his cock, curled around the shaft, stroking experimentally a few times.
Somehow, John Watson of 1918 still roams this house, an echo trapped between life and death, past and present. Somehow, William is a previous incarnation of his own life. He and John are bound together by some thread that transcends time, but now they are out of sync, their paths intersecting despite being born a century apart.
John could feel his own climax building and knew he wouldn't last long. He didn't care. He just wanted to chase the ecstasy of losing track of where he ended and where Sherlock began, their boundaries blurring, their breath and bodies merging into one.
Soon the cottage came into sight. It always made me feel peaceful, seeing the warm color of the stonework and neat rows of windows. The house nestled into the curving green landscape as comfortably as a cat soaking up the sun. A few outbuildings, rangy flower beds, and a freshly tilled garden plot surrounded the cottage.
Harry looked slightly guilty. “It’s a painkiller that can be very addictive. Don’t want Sherlock going down that road again.”
John’s breath quickens, and Sherlock glides the pads of his fingers over the tight buds of John's nipples, eliciting a moan as spurts of milky come lace over Sherlock's pale skin.
It’s a balmy night, the bedroom window cracked open to let in the breeze, the single lamp casting a cozy yellow glow, indigo shadows draped along the walls.
John led the way down the stairs and into the black car sent courtesy of Mycroft. They settled into the back seat, perfectly dignified.
“I don’t ever do this — have anyone here —” Sherlock cautions John, wanting him to know. “It’s been… a long time.”
“Can’t really think of a spookier place, can you?”
“Thanks.” John turned away from the desk and crossed over to a set of chairs in a quiet corner. He tore open the hefty envelope and out slid a laptop -- his laptop -- and a cheap mobile phone that looked like something a drug dealer would use. He breathed a sigh of relief, but was as mystified as ever.
John pretends he can’t see the lazy lust in Sherlock’s eyes, can’t feel Sherlock’s growing arousal against his belly. “Hmm, I’ll have to work a little harder.”
John yawned and rubbed his face, checked his watch. 11:13 p.m. He was catching up on patient files at the clinic, a task he never particularly enjoyed.
“No.” Sherlock watches the people outside as they walk by the window. “I'll enjoy the peace and quiet.”
Sherlock's voice sounded casual, but John detected a deliberate effort of nonchalance behind the words.
Sherlock remained immobile, realizing he had a choice to make. He could be unfairly resentful toward John for pursuing his ambitions, or he could be happy for him, keeping the thread of their friendship intact.
And I got to write the gay!pilot ending that I wanted!
“I could use a glass of water,” John said, his voice low. He glanced toward the house. “Want a drink?”
This was heaven, Sherlock thought. All the people he loved most dearly in the same cozy room, nowhere to rush off to, time slowed. He tried to imprint the moment in his mind, knowing that autumn was approaching and nothing would ever be the same again.
The room is quiet, the curtains gently stirring. John steps closer now, mapping the plunging outline of summer-burnished skin with his fingers. He breathes in the faint notes of cologne and the heady scent of Sherlock’s warm body. He draws closer, their breaths shallow, wanting to mark Sherlock’s skin with his own mouth, wanting to taste his salt and heat.
After they shoved several chairs out of the way, Sherlock returned the needle to the start of the record, and they took up their positions again.
He flexed his left hand, trying to calm the tremor that rippled through it. London. His new home. Like so many other lost souls, he hadn't known where else to go.
“Says the man who keeps body parts in the fridge. Remind me where those come from again?” John asks, climbing back up several rungs.
“You must make so many friends with parlor tricks like that,” John snapped sarcastically.
He could see the images in his mind, perfectly framed.
“My god… She winked!”
John immediately picked out Sherlock from across the room. He had just pulled off his vest, pausing to nod at the acquaintance who had complimented his sparring. John's hands stilled as he took in the sight of Sherlock's bare chest and arms, every vein and muscle defined, a living sculpture.
“Sherlock,” John repeated. “I like that name.”
He was better off being alone. It was much more conducive to work, and work was all that mattered now.
“Just a boy. I didn't recognize him.”
Sherlock moves back in his chair as John seethes at him. “We've been doing this a long time, you and I, and now you're doubting me?”
“Five year’s commitment.” Sherlock filled in the length of John's service, his voice flat.
“They wouldn’t care,” Sherlock finished, dismissing John’s concern. He ran his hands up John’s chest, wanting his mouth again, coaxing him back.
He went limp, sated, lying back, watching through half-lidded eyes as John jerked his fist over his cock, his breath a hiss as he climaxed in short bursts, the final pulses of milky come dribbling over his fingers and onto the grass. John collapsed beside him, panting.
“I think you know the answer to that.”
They sometimes meet for coffee when John is in the city. Now that Olivia is older, John sometimes brings her along for a visit to Baker Street. Sherlock finds her to be a bright child, strangely self-possessed, curious about microscopes and skulls and beetles, able to eat numerous biscuits, capable of entertaining herself for a fair amount of time. She has John's dark blue eyes and stubborn streak. He's grown rather fond of her. He might decide to teach her poker or chess someday if she has the aptitude.
“What’s Vicodin?”
John craved this, the lust, the need, the wanton abandon, the grit under his knees and saliva running down his chin, Sherlock’s broken groan, fist against his lips, biting back his cry as he shuddered, coming hot and hard in John’s mouth.
"The mint," Sherlock offered distractedly, still looking down, looking for something to say. "I like it."
He ran his hands over Sherlock's narrow hips, admiring his lean and muscular form, letting his fingers dent into the unexpected plumpness of his arse. Sherlock's cock jutted out, suspended between them like the stamen of an exotic lily.
Sherlock doesn’t object when John takes his hand and leads him to the bed. Sherlock sinks to the mattress, pulling John after him. They cling together, mouths roaming, palms stroking, exploring every angle.
He eventually places the items back into the box and returns it to the shelf, then rummages a crumpled pack of cigarettes and lighter from his coat pocket. He allows himself an occasional smoke, even though he knows he shouldn’t. Better than the narcotic alternatives he used to rely on in his youth, although the temptation still lingers seductively in the darkest corners of his psyche.
“Small town, no one’s ever heard of it. My dad was the local doctor.” He slid his eyes to Sherlock. “But you already knew that.”
“No. You never did. You’re an old soul.”
Sherlock searches John’s face, several seconds ticking by. In those few moments, Sherlock gleans from John's expression everything he's ever dared hope for, a beautifully frightening revelation: John wants him. His heart pounding, Sherlock leans forward a fraction more and reaches blindly for John.
John whistling up the stairs, biting through toast, tapping away on his laptop, asking the right questions to stimulate his mind, John glaring, laughing, swearing, smiling. John, who might not come back.
Jonn grins and covers Sherlock’s mouth with his own, twisting his torso for better leverage. They nuzzle and lick and caress, small sighs and moans drifting into the shadows. John shifts, then Sherlock slides his legs a few inches, their arms maneuver, until somehow they’ve rearranged themselves so they’re sat facing each other, legs bracketing each other’s hips.
The carriage ride was working its spell on them, as cliched and silly as it seemed. John wanted to prolong this moment -- this breathless rediscovery, this aching tenderness -- for as long as possible.
He first saw the white boxes stacked high, then the tall figure moving slowly among them. John slowed and stopped, watching from the shadows of the trees, fascinated. Sherlock was dressed in a white shirt and trousers, his hands and arms covered in long white gloves, his face obscured by fine netting draped over a hat.
“John, this is Sherlock Holmes,” Molly introduced them, “and Sherlock, this is John Watson. He’s visiting his great aunt this summer. Oh, and his mum is here too.”
He works his hand between their pelvises and John seems to understand, lifting his hips slightly. Sherlock grasps their cocks in his hand, stroking them both until all boundaries are blurred — John fucking into his fist, cock fucking cock, tongues fucking mouths, fingers gripping flesh, hot breaths panting, sheets bunching, the universe shrinking to their rutting, animal bodies.
Undeterred, Nurse Cornish whispers dramatically, “Your room is where he
“Shhhhh. Don't move.” Sherlock shifted closer, fitting their bodies together.
The intensity of the music, the heady wine, the tension of having John so near yet forbidden made Sherlock’s body hum with desire.
“Just the front page. Why?”
A pool of frigid air sinks over him and he shivers again, his nipples hardening. A strange pressure trails slowly down his chest, lingering near the bullet wound. The sensation is cold, painless, yet somehow unbearable.
“Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock takes a seat across from John. “She’ll share every uncensored thought and opinion that crosses her mind, insult you with brutal honesty one minute then mother you the next, and has a rather colorful past. Don’t make the mistake of underestimating her.”
The idea of coming to this isolated house was whimsy, a fantasy that he might find the courage to admit his feelings, and that John would reciprocate… Foolish.
“Have you checked your room?” Hannah finally asks, her hands on her hips.
“I'm sorry, John,” Sherlock murmured in passing. “I'll meet you back at the flat.”
“Mm hmm,” she nodded. “Death is fascinating, don't you think? We're so frail. We're here one minute, then
Without thinking, John places a fingertip on Sherlock’s skin. “His left shoulder is here.” John stops, realizing what he’s done.
“The proper name for menthol, a compound found in peppermint oil.”
Sherlock tried to gather what was left of his dignity. “I’ll walk you out, John.” He turned his back on Mycroft and strode out of the library, John close on his heels.
“I've telephoned your father.”
“The point is, she always said there are things around us that are just beyond our understanding. They're there; but we don't know how to see them. Or if we do, we catch only glimpses.”
Fingers at the small of his back, cradling in the nook and slope of muscle, clothing discarded on the floor. Sherlock shivers, his skin overly sensitive as John runs his palms reverently down his back, over the curves of his hips, sliding around his ass.
“Considering our relations, so could you.”
“You sound tired.”
The conversation had started off neutral enough, but the way Sherlock had looked at him -- John was certain he'd seen a hunger in his eyes, an aroused flush in his cheeks -- sparked an answering lust in him.
They had gone several rounds already, a sheen of sweat across their arms and faces, hair damp, thin vests clinging to their chests. Sherlock's style was wiry, quick, calculated, waiting for his chance to strike while gradually wearing out his opponent.
My dad glanced up at him, and they held each other’s gazes, some unspoken conversation going on between them as they reached across the table.
“That’s an egregious oversimplification,” Sherlock countered. “But then, that’s your blog in a nutshell, isn’t it?”
John said nothing. He'd been through all that with the army psychiatrist. Useless exercises that did nothing to dispel the dark thoughts from his mind or the nightmares that tormented him. He'd failed as a physician, a soldier, a husband. A lover. He met Sherlock's gaze, then glanced away.
every thrust and hot breath and groan a symphony of want.
“It was.”
Tommy cocked his head to the side, not believing me. “Liar.”
He frowned at the words, perplexed.
They return to the library to finish their drinks and warm themselves by the fire.
Sherlock watched him walk determinedly toward the house, not glancing back. With a crunch of gravel, he drove off, utterly confounded again. He thought they had been getting along well, finally breaking the ice a bit.
“I hold a position within the government, actually.”
Sherlock shrugged and slipped his phone back into his pocket. “You have a certain… rugged style that seems appropriate for the setting.”
They glanced away again, out of easy words.
“What, right now?”
“I’ll be right there. Don’t let Anderson touch anything. He always mucks it up.” Sherlock tucks the phone back into his jacket and quickly crosses over to the door, snagging his long coat off the hook. He suddenly remembers that John is still sitting in the chair, watching him with curiosity.
It was business, he reminded himself as he walked briskly away, as well as a good deed. John was clearly in a bad spot. And if he could offer a drowning man a branch, why wouldn’t he? In this case, the branch was the lure of danger sweetened with cheap lodging, which he had predicted would appeal to John’s complex nature.
They had been apart only a week, and he was seized with the sudden urge to lean across the table and kiss Sherlock, to draw out that vulnerability again, to run his hands up his back and sharp shoulder blades, to finger the curl at the nape of his neck while slipping his tongue between his lips. He wanted his hands all over his body, to press his hips into his pelvis, finding an urgent hardness. His cock stiffened at the thought, warmth pooling in his belly.
“I’m looking for more information about a Captain J. Watson, army doctor. Where he served, the name of his unit, death records, that sort of thing.”
Sherlock looked down at John, splaying his fingers over his chest, dragging his nails lightly through the coarse hair, watching John shiver with pleasure.
*********************
Spices. The heady scent of so many bright and earthy spices swirled down the stairs and into the foyer that Sherlock had to stop and inhale again in appreciation. His cold was gone, his throat and nose back to normal, only his voice still a little rough and low.
The words came out of his mouth before he could plan them. “I don't want to go.” His eyes met Sherlock's. “I want to stay.”
He felt himself swaying closer, certain Sherlock was turning toward him, leaning down, his lashes low, the dismal alley fading, their breath uneven, their lips mere centimeters apart.
****************
John’s eyes widened. “
Fantasy. Pure fantasy. John turns away, the image causing him pain. Best to go to bed, hide in the void of sleep.
He stared at the ceiling, picturing Molly clinging to John’s shoulders, grinding her hips against his as the music thumped around them. Maybe John was fucking Molly right now, her legs wrapped around his waist.
John held his gaze as he raised the veil, revealing Sherlock's neck, mouth, eyes. He lifted away the hat and netting, tossing them gently aside into the grass.
If only he could do things differently, rework the tangled maze of events that have brought them to this point of being together only fleetingly, their relationship relegated to the shadows. Ghost lives.
“Everything’s so far away to Europeans,” John returned with a smile. He lifted the cigarette from Sherlock’s hand again, slower this time, their fingers brushing. “Sometimes things are closer than you think, if you just take a chance.”
“You okay?”
**********************
She was smart, funny, attractive… If he was wise, he'd focus on her for the summer, woo her, see how far he could get.
Phillip Anderson, of course.
“Anthea,” John greeted the pretty brunette next to him, giving her a smile more cheerful than he really felt. “Just a beer day. I'll even buy you one.”
The sing-song proverb twined around his brain, memorized despite his hatred of it. Stupid. It was a stupid and terrible thing to hang in a child’s room, looking so sweet and flowery but laced with poisonous words.
“Huh. Not a lost cause yet.” John moved to the bonnet, sliding his hand along the shiny blue surface. “What are you studying at university?”
Sherlock stops, taken aback by John's tone. He scrutinizes John intently, then realizes his error: he’s grossly underestimated John's reaction to this case. John is truly afraid, shaken, reliving every inexplicable experience he's ever had.
Sherlock handed him a goblet. “Did you lose to Uncle Rudy again?”
I looked Matthew in the eye, feeling rebellious, his cock hard and warm in my palm.
Their gazes met again, and John was relieved to see an answering gleam in Sherlock’s eyes, a mix of apprehension and wonder and want, the want soon rising to the fore. Sherlock ran his thumb across John’s cheekbone before he leaned down, brushing his lips over John’s.
“Spare a smoke?”
Gradually, I came to terms with that day -- what I had done, what I’d witnessed -- and forgave us all. It was the only thing I could do, given what I now understood.
Sherlock settled a hand on John's thigh, opening more space, circled John's cock with his fingers, and lowered his head, relishing the fullness in his mouth, the tremble in the sigh that escaped from John's lips.
“Can you come at eight?”
He was fond of Victor but would not call it love. That was a word he vowed never to use again. Their arrangement was simple and agreeable, and it was enough.
John agreed to all of Sherlock’s suggestions, not caring what he ate or drank as long as he could stare at Sherlock’s profile, watch the movements of his hands, hear the rich timbre of his voice.
John bit his tongue, refraining from further commentary. He focused on keeping it slow and steady.
Feel free to drop me a note. I love to hear from readers. Thanks for following along!
going to the fucking basement!”
They loitered in the hallway, snogging, stroking fine fabric, losing track of time until the phone in Sherlock’s pocket vibrated loudly, breaking the spell.
John stopped his impulse to hurry forward and check Sherlock's injury, instead gripping the bag he held in his right hand. Sherlock would be fine. He clearly relished the refined brutality in the ring, the discipline and technique a far cry from the rough and tumble fist fights John had been in. Still, he would not want to be at the receiving end of Sherlock's long arms and big fists beneath the boxing gloves.
Intrigued, Sherlock leaves his work and glides up behind John, peering over his shoulder. Displayed on the screen is a photo -- a group of men, all shirtless and tanned, their legs covered in army fatigues and heavy boots. His eyes widen as he recognizes a younger John, his hair sun-bleached and cropped short, his arms looped behind the necks of fellow soldiers on either side of him.
He watched me, his eyes sliding to the cane. “Just to remember.”
John's knees fell open, allowing Sherlock’s talented fingers to cup and gently squeeze the growing bulge in his jeans.
Stamford was now curled at my feet and I rubbed his belly with my foot. “So I have a favor to ask,” I said. “It’s sort of an emergency.”
“I'm okay. My health, I mean,” Sherlock added, watching John's fingers.
“Insufferable. She’s living in the Dark Ages. It's 1923, for fuck’s sake.” Molly’s hand flew to her mouth, her cheeks turning red. “That just slipped out,” she gasped.
He paused again and I waited, watching the smoke curl up from the end of my cigarette.
Sherlock pulled himself up to a sitting position, his back against the headboard.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey.”
“Bristol. He says he still wants to transfer to London someday and join Scotland Yard.”
It was unusual for us to see each other at this time of day. He was a doctor and worked odd hours, so I spent a lot of time with Aunt Harry.
His shoulders sagged, deflated at the thought of leaving Baker Street. Everything was a mess. He and Sherlock had argued, this time more bitterly than ever. It was his own doing; he'd had enough of being insulted and ordered about like a lackey and had snapped. He couldn't remember what he’d said, exactly. Something about not being a dog to kick around, about Sherlock being an arrogant prick. That he never felt anything.
“I think it’s peaceful down here.”
Sherlock gazed into his cup, his voice soft when he finally spoke. “What do we do now?”
He looks at his daughter, her gangly legs folded in the armchair. He can't drag her any further into this world.
“Yeah. Okay.”
John slowed, caught off guard by the sight of his own name. Granted, it was a common enough surname, and he certainly hadn't hired a car...
with his mute partner, Sherlock’s cheeks blazed with humiliation. “I’m a freak, aren’t I?”
He walked blindly toward the sink to place the bottles on the counter. He reached out, setting the glass containers down when John suddenly turned, not seeing him, causing them to collide chest to chest. The bottles rattled against each other, nearly falling over.
“Who was that back there?” he asked, tilting his head toward the stately stone house they were passing.
The scenery moved past them in slow motion, the creak and sway of the carriage a soothing antidote to the city’s fast pace.
Sherlock frowned. He generally ignored anything that wasn't crime-related, but he was vaguely aware of the worldwide financial crisis.
“I do.”
Sherlock feels a hand around his wrist and obediently follows the tugging on his arm to the bedroom. They’re dripping wet, leaving a trail of water droplets on the floor. They stop by the side of the bed, John’s hands guiding Sherlock to a sitting position, then tipping him onto his back.
“Holmes’ residence.”
John glowered silently.
Sherlock’s not in the mood for it. “Never thought you'd live in the suburbs,” he snaps, then instantly regrets it when John’s mouth tightens in a frown. Sherlock passes a hand over his own mouth, wishing he could take the words back.
“Don’t you?”
“Bad luck, isn’t it?” Sherlock replied. He put out his palms, framing the scenario in the open field. “Our hiker takes the boomerang out to give it a few good throws, then he’s distracted, turns his head just at the wrong moment, and crack -- it flies off his skull, lands in the stream where it's carried away by the current, and down he goes. Instantly dead.”
“Idiot,” he chided himself with a little smile.
A double bed covered with a white duvet filled a corner of the room. A wardrobe took up another wall, and a small desk and chair were placed beneath the window. John crossed over to peer outside at a few tree tops and the windows of the building opposite. It was a pleasant view.
Having come this far, John pressed his finger lightly into Sherlock’s side, feeling the vitality and energy of Sherlock’s body surging through that one small gap. Growing bolder, John curved his hand just under Sherlock’s ribs, his index finger sliding deeper into the hole, his remaining fingers and thumb resting on the outside.
“Christ…” John grunted, pelvis bucking, neck straining. “Ah, God -- Sherlock…” John stroked one hand down his own chest, fingertips brushing over his peaked nipples.
“Easy. The spider tattoo on his shoulder.”
He glanced up at the bar. No one had moved, no one was looking. Had a minute passed yet? He shifted, his cock still firm. God, this was agony. He counted to 30 slowly, then rose as casually as possible, trying to cover the slight bulge in his trousers with a well-placed but not-too-obvious hand.
“Sherlock --”
He stepped back into his room and slumped against the door, feeling like he'd been punched in the gut. Sherlock had simply left without a word.
She puts down the knife she’s been using to chop vegetables and wipes her hands on a towel, impatient. “It’s got to be somewhere, hasn’t it?” She stomps off toward the library.
John nestled his chin just behind Sherlock’s shoulder. “I want to.” He pressed his mouth against the curve of his neck. “Besides, you’re the one who took care of me when I came back.” He paused, continuing after a moment. “You gave me a place to live. A reason to live. You saved me.”
“Americans think everything is old,” Sherlock teased.
Sherlock gasped, his hand desperately working over his shaft. John pressed into his back, playing with his nipples, still undulating his hips, strangely empowered by the knowledge that his come was trickling down the inside of Sherlock's legs.
He fumbles to pull it free and reads the message. It's from John.
“Never really learned,” he shrugged. “My family wasn't particularly good at having fun.” He meant it to come out jokingly, but he could feel both Molly and Sherlock's eyes on him.
John waits a beat, watches the tremor in Sherlock's hands.
Sherlock grunted and burrowed deeper under the sheets.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock mumbles as she checks his pulse. “I swear someone was in the room with me. Everything went cold, and my chest — there was pressure… couldn’t breathe.”
Sherlock gave him a long look. “Neither,” he finally answered. “I’m staying here.”
John raised an eyebrow, and Molly tilted her head quizzically.
I knew the lecture was done. I crammed a biscuit into my mouth and took a sip of tea. Sensing an opening, I decided to ask him something that had been bothering me.
A smile plays over John’s mouth. “You think so?”
Sherlock narrows his eyes, intrigued and encouraged by John’s particular choice of words. The moment is interrupted by his phone vibrating in his breast pocket. He draws it out and jolt of adrenaline spikes up his spine when he recognizes DI Lestrade’s number.
John took another swallow of beer, trying to hide how flustered he suddenly felt. He glanced at Anthea, who was tipping back her bottle, a flush coloring her cheeks.
“Of course,” Sherlock said amenably.
“Oh, I quite like it,” Sherlock grins, deciding that John has suffered enough. “Moving on.” He consults the phone again. His eyes widen. “Do you have any tattoos?”
They both watch as the words gradually vanish. John strings the strange messages together.
They practiced, the turns becoming less awkward as John grew accustomed to the steps.
In a short while John returns from his inspection.
“I was so worried…” Sherlock confessed. “But really, sex is ridiculous. Look at us.”
“He's a funeral director, you know,” Sherlock offered.
A warmth pooled in Sherlock's belly, desire igniting, racing through his veins. He wanted more. More skin, more mouth, the sting of teeth biting his shoulder, John's weight crushing the breath from his lungs, John's face contorting with pleasure as he writhed beneath him. He’d been too cautious for too long, too Spartan. Now he craved sensuality in every possible combination.
“I'm fine. You didn't need to come all this way,” he growled when he saw us enter.
The unmistakable hard length of John’s cock slides between his thighs, gliding along the sensitive flesh of his perineum.
John sighed contentedly and placed his hand on Sherlock's knee again. “He's not going to narrate the entire history of the city, is he?” John nodded toward the driver.
“I'll ring you, okay?” Molly fortified her glass with another splash of wine before threading through the crowd.
John swore there was something wistful in Sherlock's expression despite his teasing words, but it vanished, replaced by a carefully neutral gaze. John studied Sherlock, drinking in his dark hair that was turning lighter from the sun, the sweep of his cheekbones, the tender hollow of his throat that he now knew so well.
“Do you need anything?”
No cars passed by, the road all to himself, houses dark, a half-moon lighting the way. He felt wide awake and utterly free. When Musgrave Hall came into view, he slowed, assessing his next move. He dismounted when he reached the lane, deciding to walk his bike in the grass, first stooping down to pick up several small stones.
Sherlock lifted the spoon to his mouth, cringing at the initial sting of the salty broth. The second spoonful was easier, the warm liquid sliding down in a shallow swallow. The third was almost soothing as it went down, coating the back and sides of his throat.
“You chose the case,” John reminds him. “Wasn’t my idea to fly to the middle of U.S.-fucking-nowhere on the Fourth of July.”
Sherlock curves his hand on John's hip, drops a silent kiss on his neck, and moves away again.
The talk came later, at home over tea. I pushed a biscuit around on my plate as I half-listened to all the reasons I needed to learn to control my anger and the dire consequences if I didn’t.
Somehow, the sight of his soft cock reminded Sherlock how human John was, that he was vulnerable and full of uncertainty, not the perfect golden god he’d created in his fantasies.
Sherlock held his gaze, reading his meaning. “Strictly clients. I don't socialize.”
“How’s that working out?”
“That'll pass in time. Just, maybe no knives for awhile.”
Everything was great. The stone stairs that accessed the beach, the bicycles, the cafe and cinema, the grassy spot by the pool. To John, everything was agreeable, a trait that Sherlock found tiresome but charmed everyone else.
John followed, a bit wary. Sherlock never apologized. And he was acting so subdued. He hesitated by the fireplace, and Sherlock remained standing as well, seeming to wait for John’s cue.
“Sherlock--”
“How did you know that?” John gritted out.
He’s grown to know John’s routines, the little domestic habits that mark the passing of each day. He can barely remember living in the flat without John, his belongings now intertwined with his own — his razor and soap, his coffee mug, his brown shoes, his laptop.
"Who?"
Sherlock glanced disapprovingly at Molly’s elbows resting on the bonnet of the Vauxhall that he was diligently polishing, hoping to erase any sign of the car’s unapproved departure the evening before. So far, his parents had said nothing about it or his late return.
“But what do we tell the clients?”
“Well, unless you can think us out of here, that’s not helpful.”
Their gazes held a beat longer than necessary, and longer still as the music wound around them. Sherlock's hair was still a bit damp from the rain, curling lavishly at the crown of his head. John was seized with the urge to tangle his fingers in the dark coils, imagined drawing that lush mouth to his own...
Sherlock rolled to his side, shifting to his knees as smoothly as a cat, pushing John back down against the folds of canvas. He laid a trail of kisses over John's chest, teasing at his nipples, then down his stomach, his fingers straying to the button of John's trousers.
“Soon they're locked in an intimate embrace, and it starts so sensually, lips trailing down an exposed throat, lingering over a beating pulse…”
**************************
The sun was low in the sky as I angled my legs and we grimaced and gasped our way to another milestone. It was heated, quick, inexpert.
Sherlock looked at her again, considering something new. “Are you and John... ?”
A group of men entered the room, talking loudly, jostling and joking with each other. He tuned out the banter of the men, only lifting his head when he heard a familiar name.
Sherlock automatically calculates information about John’s cock — heft, length, girth — he can practically feel the heavy heat in his hand… It shocks him sometimes, the visceral reaction John causes to his brain and body.
************
The sky was heavy and dark by the time he left the cafe. Cold drops of rain splattered onto the pavement, soon turning into a steady drizzle. Sherlock cursed himself, knowing that he didn't have enough money for a cab. He'd been putting off going to the bank for days and had only a few coins left in his pocket.
“You can show me the best museums and book shops. We’ll go out, eat like kings, get drunk.” He caressed Sherlock's thigh. “Fuck all night.”
He steels himself and writes a short answer.
John’s fingertips crept toward Sherlock's, his own confession spilling out. “I was starting to worry that I wouldn't hear from you again. That you'd disappeared.”
“Fine, I’ll look into it.”
The first licks were soft, an experimental test, enough to send sparks of delight up John’s spine. Sherlock soon slid his mouth over the glans, sucking lightly, and John hummed with pleasure.
“He was reported missing in late 1918, and eventually presumed dead. However, he resurfaced in England several years later. The trail is murky -- records are missing. He was probably assigned to a special mission, deep infiltration, top secret and all that. Once back in England, he quit the service. Became a recluse, died alone. There’s not much more to tell.”
Sherlock flicked his eyes up at John. “You're invited.”
John stretched his back and groaned, his muscles aching from crouching in an awkward position for so long. He was weeding one of the many flower beds in Aunt Helen’s yard, pulling out stubborn roots and runners that had invaded the once tidy beds.
Sherlock doesn’t want him to leave, but doesn’t know how to postpone his departure. “I’ll walk you out.”
“Really?” John had never heard him mention it before. “What would you do with yourself so far away from London?”
Sherlock’s guard goes back up. “Why?”
“The affairs won't be a secret much longer,” Sherlock pointed out, taking a long drink, his mouth burning pleasantly. “The papers will find out soon enough.”
But Sherlock... Who knew what he felt about such things? Maybe nothing. Maybe something, somewhere, deep down in the hidden heat of his veins.
A hole burns in him. He wants to run. He wants to sleep. He walks until he reaches a busy road and hails a taxi.
The dawn brought more sobering thoughts. He took an inventory of the room -- clothes on the floor, John next to him in bed, dried semen crusted on his chest, a soreness that would remind him of what they'd done every time he sat down.
“Oh, they're lively as ever, if a bit slower. Father still keeps his bees and Mother publishes the occasional article on mathematics.”
The kiss is swift and hard and unexpected, stealing the air from John's lungs. Sherlock's large hands grip his head, thumbs on his cheekbones, fingers in his hair. John inhales sharply through his nose, his body responding before his brain can fully comprehend what is happening.
He turned and stalked to the door without waiting for Sherlock to reply. He focused on quickly descending the stairs, just wanting to get out onto the pavement again and walk away from this flat and all the memories roiling up in it.
last night?”
“God, no. I detest mingling.” Sherlock infuses the final word with disgust.
He walked around the house at a distance, carefully sticking to the shadows wherever possible. He didn’t know where Sherlock’s bedroom was, so he scanned the upper windows, looking for a clue. He was losing hope when he finally saw a faint glow from a partially open window on the south side of the manor.
“I've also set an appointment at the tailor’s to have you measured for a few new suits and shirts. Whatever you need to make yourself presentable. I dare say you've been on your knees so much this summer that your trousers are worn through.”
“We’d leave first thing Monday, returning Saturday. I imagine Mother’s booked the hotel where my family always stays. It's in a good location.”
He disappeared behind the closed door to face the headmaster, and for the first time I felt like crying. But I didn’t.
“How can you tell?”
He picked numbly at the label on the bottle, sliding into a dark mood. He was relieved to have a distraction when a pair of shapely legs eased onto the bar stool next to him.
“Thank you for coming, Olivia.”
And so the shirts and shoes and coffee crept into the flat.
John felt his cheeks warm at the sarcasm aimed at his unoriginal comment, but he covered it quickly. “It suits you.” He ran a hand over his own stubbly jaw, pondering how obvious he should be. What the hell, he'd just ask. “Where are you staying?”
“Sherlock --” John’s hands were suddenly at his waist, urgent, “let me touch you too.”
Sherlock wants to be calm and rational, wants to give John time to process everything he's just told him, but he's been waiting so many years for this chance that he can't bear it any longer. He winds a hand around John's in a sudden gesture that transmits every aching second of the decades they've spent apart. His throat tightens. He’ll beg if he has to.
John struggled to find his voice. “Yeah, sure. Thanks.”
He tried to concentrate on breathing slowly, listening to the soft New Age music, willing the tension to drain from his shoulders. But then his ears caught the suggestive sound of Sherlock's breath hitching as the masseur worked on a painful knot, followed by a low grunt, a release of breath.
Sherlock suddenly pressed closer, their pelvises making sharp contact, breath quickening, mouths hungrily seeking more, hands roving, bottles clattering, shattering into the sink --
It felt like a hopeless task. The weeds would creep back in eventually, and all his work would be for nothing. Still, it would make his great aunt happy to see her daisies and snapdragons blooming again, free of choking weeds.
The sudden pressure of two giant hands grasping his ass trips the wire on John's orgasm, and he’s moaning loudly, his hips stuttering, pressing and grinding out his hot, lusty release into Sherlock's body beneath him.
Sherlock shivers, gooseflesh prickling his arms.
Besides, this wasn't the first time he'd been drawn to another man. A memory from his first year shimmered in his mind: A bare shoulder, tousled blond hair on the pillow next to him. He recalled pushing himself up on one elbow to squint at the clock, his head throbbing and his mouth dry, hungover.
John furrowed his brow, letting Sherlock position their arms and hands until he was satisfied.
“Yeah,” John answered, finally hitting his stride. “It feels really good.”
“How do you explain that?” John asks, an edge to his voice.
Rested, they continued on past shops and into a sprawling park, strolling by children sailing paper boats on a lake, gentleman walking dogs, couples ambling arm-in-arm.
When Sherlock resurfaced, there was a wicked gleam in his eye, followed by the rather alarming suggestion that they pay a visit to where the body had been found.
John smiled smugly to himself, knowing he had just found another advantage. Could be interesting, this little kink. “Alright, they stay on. But now it's your turn. Strip.”
“Please,” Sherlock waves his hand at the overstuffed chair.
“Oh.” Sherlock knew he should say more, and struggled to find words. He suddenly felt very young -- and very aimless. John would be healing people, saving lives, establishing himself in a profession, while he would still be at university dabbling with chemicals, adding nothing of value to the world. For the first time, he regretted not having a strong calling to a cause or a career. “Sounds like what you wanted.”
John glanced at him. “Think what?”
It’s not the first time he’s studied John. Oh, he’s mapped every detail from his head to his toes, cataloging John’s fine hands and shapely ears and long lashes and strong thighs, and, yes, that intimate region that is now hovering mere inches from his face.
John hooks a leg over Sherlock’s thigh, nestling their warmest bits together. “Let me make it up to you.”
“This is a farce,” Sherlock snarls in frustration. “Well done!” He shouts toward the ceiling, into the air. “Excellent performance! Can't wait to see what's next.” He runs an agitated hand through his hair.
I knew his parents were gone, off to Paris for their anniversary or something. I invited myself over to his house.
He helps slide off Sherlock's black suit jacket, hangs it over another chair while Sherlock slips off his shoes. They lower onto the bed, nestle together, and both sigh heavily.
Sherlock had no idea what to write. He really needed nothing. On the occasions that he did want something – a new shirt, a fine bottle of wine, a luxurious soap – he bought it himself on the spur of the moment.
I pressed my eye to the tinted glass, pebbled and distorted. I saw them, pale silhouettes made wavy through the glass, bodies enmeshed on the bed, blurred angles of long limbs jutting out, hands clutching a broad back, legs wrapped around thrusting hips, faces buried in necks and shoulders.
John's palm, rough and warm, slid beneath the fabric of his shirt. Fingerpads brushed over his right nipple, bringing it to a hard nub.
John closes his eyes, his hand rising, sliding under Sherlock’s jaw, angling his head to deepen the kiss. Sherlock responds like a flower blooming in the sun, his mouth warm, one hand twining into John’s hair, the other into the fabric of his T-shirt.
“You sound like Aunt Harry,” I plotted my next move in the game. “She lives alone too, you know.”
Sherlock looks at her and she meets his gaze. In that second, they both wordlessly admit to the possibility that something otherworldly exists in the house.
“Thank you for caring about her,” John adds softly.
“Yeah, sorry, I figured I’d come down to check. My shift just ended, and I was curious about the results.”
They fall silent, knowing their time is limited. John finally pushes himself up, lifting a corner of the covers. “You must be cold.”
Not something, but someone.
“What about that spare bedroom of yours, Sherlock?”
“She’s doing it.”
This was it. This was the opening I’d been waiting for. I could spill out all my suspicions and evidence and share this burden of knowing too much. But I couldn’t do it.
Such a strange appendage, exposed and vulnerable, crude and efficient, ridiculous and practical, sometimes inconveniently obvious, capable of giving and receiving so much pleasure...
In the mirror that morning, John had noticed the silver threaded through his hair, the lines along his forehead, the bags under his eyes. He sighed, running a hand through his hair. Nothing you could do about the passing years. He elected to forego shaving, embracing the holiday spirit with a scruffy beard.
For the next 15 minutes they search high and low for the laptop, widening the scope to the entire ground floor.
The disaster that John feared would be unleashed by admitting his deepest feelings for Sherlock never happens. In fact, John discovers over time, it only strengthens their relationship.
“Have you known each other long?” she asked.
John furrowed his brow, not understanding.
At midnight, they ate the pears in bed, juice dribbling over their fingers and chins. They shared sweet kisses and soft touches, finally settling under the sheet, John spooning Sherlock.
“I’ve missed you,” John murmurs huskily, dipping his mouth to Sherlock’s bare shoulder. His robe is slipping off, hanging askew.
“Speaking of the Yard, where is DI Lestrade spending Christmas?”
John stifles a groan, responding despite his damp jeans and the freezing temperature. “Sort of adds new meaning to ‘snow balls,’” he manages to quip.
“Yes, that should work.”
“Well, I might as well explain all this,” Molly announced.
Sherlock nodded, letting go of the breath he had been holding, a huff of air that lowered his shoulders.
I pushed my chair back and stood up, then loitered for a moment, pulling at a lock of my dark blonde hair. “Dad?”
They cycled through their turns, Miss Smith lightening their moods with her steady chatter and compliments. “Lovely,” she said, finishing Sherlock’s set. “Now, let’s have you stay seated and your friend come stand by the side of the chair.” She ducked behind the camera to check the framing.
They kissed, their fingers stroking and thumbs gliding over the slick heads. It was difficult to concentrate, John’s fingers plying him to a mindless state of wanting nothing more than new pleasure after pleasure.
The case had sounded intriguing enough, a series of thefts at one of the poshest ski resorts in the French Alps, the thief not targeting jewels but the laptops of wealthy guests in order to steal valuable financial data. John had looked forward to a week of sun and snow and invigorating mountain air, packing several wool jumpers and his heaviest boots.
Sherlock had instantly recognized a sharp edge in John that other people didn't see. It resonated with his own inner darkness, which was a thrilling, novel discovery. But it was exactly what he didn't need. He had promised to do better, to
“I don’t know for sure,” Sherlock admits. “The police made an arrest, but it may have been a job for hire.”
