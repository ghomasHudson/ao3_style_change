“Cas?” He whispers. The dark haired boy stirs next to him and hums in response. Dean doesn’t know if he should curl back up to his best friend or cover him in kisses from head to toe. The last thought makes him blush and opts for the first option.
“I’ll get my things.” He says and closes the door to the car. Dean doesn’t know what else to do, so he drives off leaving Cas in the rearview mirror. He just needs to drive like he used to. Driving always cleared his mind when there was too much going on.
“Mr. Winchester. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Avla.”

His Saturday didn’t get worse so that was good, but it didn’t get better either. His mood was foul and he knew it. It didn’t matter how fast he drove on the back roads or how loud he played his music he couldn’t make himself feel better. He felt stuck in a never ending loop of bad luck. He was sure it had something to do with the fact that it would be the first year that he wouldn’t be able to put flowers on his mother’s grave. It would also be the first year he would miss his best friends birthday. He should call him and see how he’s doing. It’s been a few weeks since their last talk and he hadn’t gotten a letter in at least a month.
“No! You were gone, Cas. I was going to be okay without you. I was...I was going to move on and be okay without you. I thought you were dead! I thought you had just...I thought I couldn’t save you. I tried, Cas. I tried so hard and you just...you gave up? You let me kill him?”
“I used to work for him,” Dean says. Cas doesn’t move. It’s as if he’s waiting for more information, but Dean can’t give anymore. Charlie freezes where she's crouched over him and her hands drop. He can feel her eyes on him. They’re going to leave. They’re going to leave and he’s going to have to move on again. Maybe it’s for the best. Maybe he should go.
He drives downtown and parks at the park and ride. He’s kind of shocked at all the little stores packed into such a small area. He finds a small bookstore and goes in. Maybe he can find something to send Sam. He likes books about supernatural lore and historical fiction. He’s sure he can find something. He runs his hands across the spines different books. He picks one up about vampires and flips through it. Not really paying attention to where he’s going.
Dean nods.

“Damn it, Cas,” Dean mutters. He grabs his shoes and coat before he can even think about what he’s doing. Cas can’t go back to the camp. That much is clear. He would search the whole fucking town if it had to. He’s about to reach the front door when it opens and Cas steps inside with a white bag and two coffees.
Dean breaks the silence first, “You ready to eat now? I was looking forward to a burger and fries.”
By the time Dean has made it to the end of the dock, he doesn't care that he's still wearing his shorts, socks, and new shoes. He takes a deep breath and launches himself into the water. As he gets closer to the person, he sees it’s not his brother. It’s the quiet boy from next door.
“It’s a tracking device. Get rid of it the first chance you get. They won’t be able to find you after that. Dean?”
“You're welcome!” Dean calls out hoping that he heard him. Dean makes his way back to his own house and is greeted by an excited Sammy and a sleeping father who has twelve empty beer bottles on the table next to him. Dean stalks to the kitchen with Sammy close behind.
“Are you ready to sleep?” Andy asks.
“You serious? You want me to go to C Street?”
“Rough morning?” His uncle asked when he saw the wet spot on the back of Dean’s pants.
He lives in a small town where barely anything ever happens. That’s how he likes it. Low key and boring. Also, there's the fact that not a soul knows where he came from or knows about his past. That alone is a blessing he thanks the universe for every day.
“Where are you taking me, big boy?” Andy asks. Dean wants to throw up. He asked that once and ended up not being able to to sit down for a week. It was the worst week of his life.
“See ya in a few hours,” Dean says and walks over to his truck. He has his work issued jacket and a bagged lunch he made the night before. He can finally begin his work day.
He opens the door and runs up the stairs to his room. He quickly scans the room for any red blinking lights. He finds none. He grabs his duffel bag from under the bed and fills it with clothes. He puts his watch in the side pocket of the bag. He can probably sell it later if he needs to. He gets his stash of cash from the closet and the one from the underside of his night table. It should be more than enough to get him started. He leaves the rest in case Sammy needs it later. He runs downstairs and grabs a few things from the cabinets for food and then leaves again. He’s in and out in less than five minutes.
“Okay, Dean.” Something feels wrong. Dean takes another step but is stopped by Cas standing right in front of him. He can’t see anything but he knows this isn’t the Cas he wants. This isn’t the Cas he needs. He quickly reaches around Cas and flips the light switch up. Dean’s eyes burn at the sudden presence of light. Cas stands before him still bloody, bruised, and broken. His clothes are still ripped and stained with blood and dirt. His eyes are full of a sadness that makes Dean feel sick. He wants to reach out and ease the pain but he knows he can’t. He can’t do it. He looks the same as he did when he had found him in Purgatory and tears start to prick at his eyes.
Cas took another step forward, "Dean."
“He knows about the drugs. He knows about what you do. He knows everything and he’s going to out Alistair to the police.”
“Dean?” I ask. His eyes stay on my mouth and he comes towards me and I know what’s going to happen next. It’s not a second later and his mouth crashes into mine. It’s all lips and teeth and first. It’s fast and messy but God, it feels so good. He pulls back only to place his hot mouth on my neck right below my ear. I can’t stop myself from letting out a small gasp. I haven’t been touched like this in so long. I feel like there are fireworks under my skin and they ignite every time he touches me.
Benny nods at the man as the realization of what he is washes over him. He knows that he should be running or at least trying to get answers but he feels stuck. Like there is a weight on him that’s preventing him from speaking or moving. The man carefully walks towards him and places the small bottle on the ground about a few feet from where he’s leaning against the tree.
“Dean, I think I can do this myself.”
The line goes dead and Dean looks over at his dresser. The watch is still sitting in the box. He only wore it for a short time. Something about it made him feel uneasy. The whole situation made him feel uneasy. He shouldn't take the job, but making seven hundred bucks per delivery was too good to pass up. Besides, he didn’t have to work for this guy forever. Just a few months to get things going for Sam.
I am looking for an artist to make some fan art for this story and I am also in need of a beta. If you are interested please message me on tumblr. :)
“This isn’t about sides, Dean. I’m just reminding you that it might not be about you.”
He opens the door after a few moments and my nose is assaulted by the smell of weed and incense. He smiles at me and then runs his teeth over his bottom lip while looking me up and down as if I’m a piece of meat. I can feel my face reddening under his gaze.
“Don’t.”
“Your mom was a special woman, Dean,” Cas replies and walks towards Dean to comfort him.
Dean’s mouth drops open, “What?”
“I’m freaking fantastic, Cas. I’m okay. I really am.” Dean says and wipes at his eyes.
He finds a few people that he’d seen when he used to run around the area, but no one seems to know who Andy is. Gabe shows up with tons of pizzas and cases of water and Dean helps him hand them out while he waits for Andy to show up. He had been in the tent, he’ll be back for sure. Only those who have nothing left go in the tent. It was only a matter of time before he would pop back up again.
“You’re going to stay for a whole week?”
They get dressed enough to eat and then head to bed. They don’t talk, they just lay in eachothers arms and let sleep take them over.
“Let me help you.”
My eyes trail down his body and land on his dick. I want to taste it. I know that I shouldn’t because it’s a rule that we put in place for a reason, but it looks so inviting sitting there leaking all over the place. It twitches and my mouth starts watering. I look up and I see Cas watching me. My fingers still and I reach my other hand to touch him.
I've been gone for a long time! But I'm back and I'll be posting once a week again!
“Sammy, I’m sorry,” Dean says. Tears blurred his vision before he could even finish his apology. He can’t stop the sob that claws its way out of his throat. He cries and cries and doesn’t stop until he hears Sam sniffling on the line. He quiets himself and wipes his eyes on the backs of his hands and gathers himself the best he can. He takes in a shaky breath and listens to his brother cry on the line.
The boys are about fifty miles out from the bunker when Dean starts to get tired. It’s just about 4AM and Sam grabs the wheel from Dean’s hands, yelling at him to wake up. He had been driving in the wrong lane. Luckily, there had been no oncoming traffic.
This story is pieced oddly and strangely on purpose.
“I need to take a break. I’m going to get some wood.” Dean throws his blade on the ground in front of himself and stalks off in the other direction. His absence leaves Cas and Benny alone.
“No. I woke up and you were gone and no matter how many times I asked mom and dad what happened they never gave me an answer,” Gabe plays with the handle of his mug. He looks up and watches as Castiel’s shoulders sag.  A new wave of sadness washes over his brother. He doesn’t cry but the pain is written across his face in dark thick lines that can never be erased.
This chapter takes place in Purgatory.

“You have me. I mean...Sammy and I. Both of us. Kevin too, if you want,” more shifting in the room. He can hear Cas moving around the room and it makes him nervous.
This chapter is not edited. I just wanted to get it up for you guys.
“I love you.”
“I’m sorry, Sammy.” Dean says as his brother walks to the front door. Sam turns and gives his brother a small smile and then leaves for the bus.
There wasn’t a reply after that and Dean frowns. He misses his friend. He needed his friend and the way that he was able to make everything better. He missed the way he could calm Dean down with little effort. Usually a touch to the hand or a look was all Dean needed. The smallest gesture from Cas and all the pain and suffering was gone.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean?” Cas sets the bag and coffees down on the coffee table and looks at Dean.
“I don’t know what happened to you, Dean. I don’t know what happened in Purgatory, or what happened between you and Cas,” Sam turns around, “but I can’t help you if you don’t let me in. It’s supposed to be you and me against the world. We’re supposed to be brother’s, Dean, and right now...I feel like I don’t even know you. You changed.”
“I know, but it’s not the same,” Sam pauses for a moment. “It’s like, he could live without talking to me everyday, but with you, it’s like he’s missing a whole part of himself.”
He remembers always being tired. Maybe from all the pretending or lack of sleep because he had nightmares about what was happening to him behind closed doors. He could barely stay awake in his classes so he dropped out a few credits shy of being able to graduate and got a job. It wasn’t much but it helped when their dad would disappear for days, sometimes weeks at a time.
“Why?” He probably shouldn't question it, but sometimes he speaks before he thinks.
The drive home takes too long and it leaves Dean in a sour mood. He feels like an asshole and it makes him think about the months before he had left home. He himself had been more or less homeless. He had been practically living in the Impala for a few weeks before a friend stepped in and helped him get back on his feet.
“Dad, that’s not fair,” Dean interrupts. He knows what’s coming next and it makes him feel sick.
“I told you not to be late,” He says. He doesn’t sound mad, but he doesn’t sound happy either.
Keep in mind from here on out there will be flash backs to Purgatory.
This story is pieced oddly and strangely on purpose.
But maybe this was something different. Maybe this was more than just a love for a family member. He didn’t feel quite like this for Sam. It was the same but something was different. Maybe more intense? More personal? More romantic? No. That doesn’t feel right? Or does it?
“Dean? Are you alright?” She asks. He looks up from the foam in his beer glass and meets her eyes.
Dean doesn’t know how long he’s been asleep or dead but he knows he’s sore and his throat burns. He opens his eyes and sees his dad leaning over the neighbor boy. He scans the shore and sees Sam standing at the end of the dock, his arms wrapped around one of the posts. What if it had been Sammy? What if he had been looking at his little brother’s lifeless body instead? The ache in his chest lessens at the sight of his still alive, still breathing, brother.
“I ain’t big on faith, Dean, but I think you’ll find him,” Benny says and smiles. There is a small fire between them keeping them warm as night falls. Benny continues to sharpen the blade on his makeshift axe with a small rock. Dean watches as the rock meets the blade and creates sparks that fall at Benny’s side. It’s been three months since Dean and Benny started to look for Cas and he’s finally no longer ashamed to admit that Benny might be his friend. He had saved his ass several times and even if Benny was a vampire, he was thankful he was there.
“It’s not that simple. What you feel for me, I’m not sure…I’m not sure it’s real.”
“Cas, I want you to meet someone. This is Benny,” Dean gestures to the vampire behind him and Benny smiles but then looks quickly at the ground. Dean smiles and turns back to Cas.
This story is pieced oddly and strangely on purpose.
"For…everything," Cas says.
“No. Never.”
“It’s been too long. I’m ready. In fact, I’m pretty sure this will cure a helluva lot of my issues right now.” That’s the consent Cas is looking for. Enthusiastic, willing, and wanting.
“I swear to God himself, Alistair. If you touch one hair on his head, I will kill you. You know I can and I will,” At that Dean turns and starts walking back to his car. He has to get out of there. He can’t breathe. He feels like his lungs are on fire. His legs are shaking, but he makes it just in time to sit down in the front seat of the Impala and go into a full-blown panic attack.

Dean Winchester is having a shitty week.
“Yeah, Dean. Me too.” Sam looks at him again and smiles. Dean sits there for a few more moments and then starts the car. He feels like he just had therapy. He’s raw and unstable. Sam still needed him. And more importantly, still wanted him in his life. He felt good. He felt a little freer. Things were going well for him. He was starting to feel what happiness felt like and he didn’t feel like he was waiting for the other shoe to drop.
I don't know that I'll be able to update weekly, but I'll try!
Dean sees Ava every day for two weeks. He’s allowed to go home and stay with Cas. Cas hovers. He follows Dean around the house and checks on him often. It drives Dean crazy for the first few days until he realizes that Cas is genuinely worried that Dean might do something.
Cas stands and heads to the kitchen. He watches as Dean stirs something on the stove. He notices that there is only one knife in the knife block and that some of the other kitchen items are missing. Ava had said that Sam had been staying with Dean since he left the hospital. Cas feels guilty that it’s not him here taking care of Dean. It should be him, but he can’t. He can’t help him this time. He has to want it.
“He’s better when you’re here,” Sam says. Dean blushes. Cas doesn’t respond with words but he knows he’s looking at Sam with a questioning look in his eyes. “I wish I had that with someone.”
Dean realizes that this could be the last time he see’s Cas. This could be the last time he speaks to him ever. Dean sits on the edge of the bed and keeps his eyes on the floor, “What truth?”

“I didn’t want you to do them,” He replies, turning to face the other side of the room.
Fuck it. I press myself against him again pushing him back into the wall near where we came in. I tangle my fingers in his hair and pull his head back into the wall with a quiet thump. My mouth finds his for a moment and then moves to his neck.
“You have a right to be harsh. I broke your heart. I’m so sorry, Gabe,” Gabriel pets Castiel’s hair and calms him enough to get him to the table to talk.
“Andrew was my nephew.” The word ‘was’ makes Dean feel uncomfortable. He watches her as she sits down and hands the envelope back to him. “Go ahead.”
“How did you get this number?”
Dean is relieved to be away from Sam so can can have some time to himself but there’s a growing guilt creeping it’s way into every fiber of Dean’s being. He swore he would protect Sam and keep him safe and here he is in some dingy motel about to drink himself silly. There are no disappearing customers. He lied to Sam to get away and he feels like a coward and part of himself wishes Crowley would catch him.
“What are we going to do about Alistair?” Cas asks. Charlie has long gone home and Dean and Cas are on the couch. They are sitting so close that Dean can smell Cas’s toothpaste and face wash.
“Okay.”
Cas takes a few careful steps to the couch and sits down on the other side of Dean. He stares as if he’s trying to convey some kind of secret message. Dean feels like the whole world is moving in slow motion as Cas’s arms come up and wrap around him again. This feels different. This feels like something he hasn’t felt in a long time.
“You are. You’re sulking,” Cas places a hand on Dean’s shoulder and directs him to the curb. They both sit, their shoulders touching.
Dean wakes up again and knows that Cas is awake. He can feel him staring. He’s probably counted his freckles twenty times by now. He keeps his eyes closed and lets the feeling of calmness and familiarity wash over him.
“I’ll get you some. I’ll get you all the water in damn the world. Alright, buddy?” Dean’s not sure why Gabe is so happy or why there are tears coming from his eyes, but there are.
“I appreciate what you have done for me, but this is where I belong.”
I am so sad to be ending this story, but It's time. Thank you all so much for reading and all the comments/messages on Tumblr. I am so thankful and blessed to have been able to share this with you. I will be starting a new fic soon and I hope that you'll take the time to read it as well.
“No, I haven’t told him yet. I don’t think now is the best time,” she says. Sam takes a quiet step back around the corner out of sight. What hasn’t she told him? He hears her laugh and tell whoever she’s talking to goodbye. He waits a few moments before walking into the kitchen to say hello.
“Okay, smart ass. I’m serious. Take it slow.” He warns. They sit there for a few minutes in silence. Each one thinking about what the other had said. Each one taking in the need for each other and openness they had just shared. He can see Sam physically relaxing next to him. His shoulders are dropping. His breathing is deep and even. He looks happy.
“I’m counting,” That’s all Cas says and Dean closes his eyes again. He doesn’t get touches like this anymore. The touches he gets these days are too rough. He ignores the feeling that bubbles up in his belly and focuses on Cas’s light and gentle touches to his face. This is the first time Cas has touched him all summer. He feels like it should freak him out that someone other than his dad or Sammy is touching him, but it’s Cas, and Cas would never hurt him.
“Right.”
“Cas!” Dean calls and pulls himself up and rushes over to Cas.
He lays on the couch for the rest of the day and Sam lets him. He’s in love with Cas. It all makes sense now. He probably has been since they were kids. He can’t help but smile because Cas loves him too.
He rolls over and buries his face into his pillow because he’s smiling like a lovesick fool. His hand feels something under the pillow. He pulls it out and looks it over in the light of his bedside lamp. It’s a folded up piece of paper. He unfolds it and recognizes Cas’s handwriting right away.
Dean doesn’t say anything else. He would be lying if he said he wasn’t scared that they’ve found him.
He knows something changed in Purgatory. He knows the feeling that he has whenever he thinks of Cas is a feeling he hasn’t felt in a long time and he knows that he can’t afford to feel it. He can’t afford to let his feelings get in the way of this battle that he’s losing little by little. He needs his best friend to help him but he needs the Cas from before Purgatory.
The trail they are on leads to a small clearing with three rows of tents that make a half circle. There’s a fire pit in the middle with a number of chairs around it. The people who occupy the area are milling around. Some of them are sitting near the fire. Some are talking with others in the group. Some of them look okay and others make Dean’s skin crawl.
If you or someone you know is feeling like ending their life, please call 1-800-273-8255.
Dean is 11 years old when he sees Castiel for the first time. He is walking along the edge of the lake, trying not to get his new shoes wet like his dad had asked when he sees something out of the corner of his eye. There's movement in the water. A duck, probably. He’s going to keep walking, but he hears a small cry and realizes it’s human and not a bird. He had promised to teach Sam how to swim this summer and had been putting it off. Dread fills his chest as he takes off down the beach.
“We’ve all done things. Do you think he’s just going to let this go? You think he’s going to live his life without you?” Benny laughs to himself and looks towards Dean who’s headed back towards the two men, “He ain’t gonna let this go.”
Thanks for reading!
Why hadn’t he just been honest with Cas? Why hadn’t he just tried harder to forget Purgatory? Why hadn’t he been honest with Sam? Why had he done so many bad things in his life?
“It’s a panic attack. You’re going to be okay. Just take a deep breath.”
“Okay. I can work with that. Thank you, Dean.”
“I’ve never seen him like this,” Dean says quietly. Benny nods and takes another step forward. Benny steals a glance and Dean and his fingers touch the fabric of the angeles coat. Cas turns around, his eyes are glowing a bright and vibrant blue. Cas raises a hand and both men are sent flying back towards the tree line.
“I miss her, Cas.”
“Dean, I can hear you thinking. You’re making it impossible to sleep.” Sam turns his head towards his brother and cracks a small smile.
“You told him to leave?” Sam accuses. Dean rolls his eyes and looks down at the floor. Sam would never understand. This situation with Cas was so totally and completely fucked up he isn’t sure
“It’s alright.
“So, what is going on with Gabriel?” Dean asked as casually as he could. Sam turns and looks at him. There’s a hint of a smile playing at his lips. So, it’s getting serious then. Maybe not boyfriends, but something more than just friends.
“What?” I ask. He gets up on his knees and sighs. I can tell he wants to say something, but he’s holding back. He gets off the bed and stares down at me saying nothing. I can see the conversation he’s having with himself, but I have no idea what he’s thinking.
This story is pieced oddly and strangely on purpose.
“I didn’t know who else to call. Your number was on one of the tags on your backpack. I kept it just in case. They said it’s not safe for me to go back to the camp. They said that I should find somewhere else to go,” Cas still won’t look him in the eye.
“Dean, it wasn’t right for me to come back. The things I did...in Heaven. I needed to stay.”
Dean's starting to realize that if he had simply done this a long time ago he wouldn’t have wasted so much time. It's his biggest regret. Wasting everyone’s time and energy. He now sees that just trying to get him through a single day was like running and marathon and he never really knew it.
“I’ll tell him you stopped by,” Garth says. The guy is like a hundred pounds and visibly shaking in fear.
Benny stands there and watches as the angel walks away. He bends down and plucks the bottle from the ground, and holds it flat in the palm of his hand. The grace looks like liquid smoke. It’s bright and he feels a slight vibration in his hand from it.
“Stop it,” Cas says. Dean stops walking and looks at his friend, “I know what you’re doing and I want you to stop.”
"Okay, but what are you feeling the most?" Ava asks.
Dean, please reply.
“Okay.”
Cas is going to have to leave and Dean knows it. They’re taking a walk to the park and Dean feels like he’s walking in wet cement.
“Cas…”
“Hey, man, no one just belongs on the street. Look,” Dean’s shocked at how upset he feels and how sad he is that Castiel wants to take his chances with the cold. “I don’t know your story, and I’m not askin’, but I’ll be damned if I let you stay out here when I’ve got more than enough at home.”
“Good, huh?”
“What just happened, dude? You need me to go?” Charlie asks concerned.
Dean sits at the table and fills out the paperwork. It’s all basic stuff like his name and age and how many deliveries he’d like to make a week. It doesn’t even ask for his address or work history. It only takes him a few moments to fill it out before he’s walking back up to the front desk. There is another man standing there with the guard.
“Okay. What did you do?” He doesn’t want to think about what she might have done. The first thing that comes to mind is that she filed for divorce. He wouldn’t blame her if that’s what’s going on. He’s thought about it a few times himself just to save her from the heartache of everything.
“Handle your brother,” His dad spits and turns to the fridge. It’s clear he isn’t sober and Dean sighs.
“Dean…”
“Don’t fucking touch me!” The older man yells. His hands are moving wildly knocking things off the counter. Dean doesn’t move fast enough and the back of his father's hand slams into his face. Dean gasps and grabs his nose in pain. There is already blood dripping down his lip and into his mouth.
Where are you? Answer me.
"When I went to look for him, I had this weird feeling. Then, I saw him through the window. He was sitting there with the damn knife in his hands and he had this look. I knew something was wrong. So, I called out. He looked up and saw me and it was like he went back to normal. He was upset, but that look was gone. Like it had never happened. I feel haunted by that look." Cas explains. There are tears in his eyes, but they don't fall.
Sam doesn’t know what to say. Pregnant? She can’t even get pregnant and Dean knows that. He knows because Sam told him a year ago because they had been trying for years to have a baby and the doctors told her that it was impossible. It had broken Sam’s, heart. It had killed him and Dean had been there to pick up the pieces and carry the weight of the news.
Dean walks down the hallway to the lobby of the police station. He can see Cas sitting twenty feet from him. He’s leaning forward with his elbows on his knees. His eyes are downcast. Dean stops and stares for a moment. It takes him longer than it should to realize that Cas is praying. He’s praying hard. He’s so caught up in it he doesn’t look up until Dean touches his shoulder. There are tears in his eyes. He jumps up and wraps his arms around Dean so tightly Dean can barely breathe.
“I’m sure I love you.”
Sam’s right. He failed him, again, he let him down and broken another promise. He failed Cas too. He needed to tell someone what happened in Purgatory so that he could move on. He needed to tell someone about what happened to him and how he and Cas had changed. He wants to talk about it but the thought makes his stomach tie up in knots. He doesn’t know what to say so he just stands there staring, willing his tears not to fall, but they leave a warm wet betrayal on his face.

“I told you, I want to get outta here,” Benny throws the head down a nearby hill and wipes his blade on the leg of his pants.
I wonder if he knows the effect he has on me? Does he know he’s all I think about, even when I’m with my girlfriend? He might be ruining my life and I don’t care. I can’t think about anything except him and his stupid blue eyes and sex hair. Not to mention his mouth. His glorious, sent from heaven, mouth.
“I don’t even know where to begin, Sammy.”
“It wasn’t always my choice later.”
“Cas,” Charlie says and moves to his side. Cas steps away from her.
“Thank you, Dean.” Cas stands and reaches out the hand not occupied by a hamburger. Dean takes it and gives it a firm shake before turning to leave. He feels a little guilty for suddenly leaving, but he’s done okay without friends so far, and who makes friends with a homeless person? I mean, the guy seems normal, aside from his weird name, but who knows. He could have killed for crack or something.
Dean presses on the gas. It’s six-thirty. Even if Sam wasn’t awake he might still make it on time. The bakery he’s delivering to today is only a few minutes from Sam’s school. He parks in his parking spot and rushes into the house. He can hear the shower running. He knocks on the door and opens it.
“I heard you,” Cas’ gaze is burning into him. He feels tiny under his gaze but looking the angel in eye is not going to happen.
“I guess he’s ready.”
PURGATORY - 12 MONTHS (forced memory)
“The watch?”
“Yes, thank you for that.”
“Well, now you know. You can go if you want.” Dean says. He doesn’t want to cry but his eyes are stinging.
“Nice to meet you too,” Dean says and sets the papers down in front of Marv who takes them and sets them in a folder next to him. Marv stands and motions for Dean to follow him. Dr. Alva doesn’t say anything else.
"I'm gonna jump in here for a second. What I'm hearing is that you feel that Dean still might go through with it, even though he's telling you he won't."
“This isn’t what you think it is, dad,” Dean says. John stares at him and then takes a few steps forward. The two men are toe to toe in the kitchen and it’s the first time Dean has truly been afraid of his father.
Friday sadness creeps in and makes Dean feel like he’s going to throw up whenever he thinks about Cas leaving the following day. He doesn’t want his friend to leave. He’s just starting to feel normal. He’s starting to feel like himself again.
A moment passes before he realizes he’s staring at the man, “Sorry, I, uh, a few weeks ago you dropped your sandwich. I mean, it was my fault,” He’s rambling. “But anyway, I got these for you.”
Thank you for reading! Things are going to start moving along in the next chapter.
“Andy?” Gabe gives Dean a knowing look and points to a small tent towards the back of the area. Dean knows that tent. He’s been in there more times than he wants to admit. That’s where you go when you have nothing left. That’s where you go when you’re willing to do anything to get money to eat or even have warm socks.
“Anything.”
Cas loves him.
It takes Dean a few minutes to realize that it’s not Cas touching him but Benny. That helps soothe him a little. After a few minutes he sits up and sees Cas standing in front of him. The hoodie is covered by a light blue windbreaker and Dean feels instant relief. He remembers Benny is next to him. Benny is talking, but he’s not sure what he’s saying exactly until he sees the water bottle in his face. Dean takes it and takes a few sips.
He takes his time driving back to town. He takes in the trees and water. He looks up at the sky a few times to watch the birds fly overhead. He can’t stop himself from feeling better and better as he makes his way back to his apartment, but there’s also the feeling of dread. How is he going to get through this? The last time he had to talk about his past he could barely get it out. His panic attack was almost immediate and lasted an hour. He texts Charlie when he’s a few minutes away to give her a heads up that he’s nearly there and had gotten her messages.
“Why’s it funny, Cas?” He prods, but Cas looks down at his burger instead.
A few months later Sam calls and tells Dean that their dad isn’t doing well. Dean knows he shouldn’t go back but he does it anyway. He grows out his hair and colors it darker and hopes that no one will notice him. His dad isn’t happy to see him. They fight and it leaves Sam with so many questions that Dean can’t stay. He takes the Impala and heads back to the Pacific Northwest.
By the time he gets to the last text he’s decided to call and at least let him know he’s okay. But there is no way in hell he’s going back to that bunker.
“Yeah. Not much further. I was told he was hangin’ out down by the water. Maybe a mile or so. Think you can make it?”
Late in the afternoon, after accidentally falling asleep while watching a nature show on bees, Dean wakes up to Cas groaning in pain.
It isn’t until it’s nearly dinner time that Dean realizes how much he’d been talking. Andy hadn’t really shared much about anything except his job. He didn’t talk about C Street or how Dean had found him. He didn’t talk about Alistair or what Alistair and Crowley did with him after he dropped him off. He just talks about his work and how he’s happy that he’s found himself again. He says it in a way that makes Dean believe him. He says it so convincingly that Dean finds himself staring at the man wishing that he could kiss him.
Cas? Dean feels something clawing in the pit of his stomach. Something he can't afford to let grow in a place like this. Why had he been looking for Cas all this time? Sure, Cas was his friend, but why was he willing to nearly kill himself to find him? Why did he pray to him every night hoping he would just show up and tell him he was okay? He could admit that he loved Cas. He could admit that. He was friend, hell, he was his family.
“At first,”
Hi! So, I have been able to re-write a lot of what I deleted, but my message before stands.
Cas stops his movement, his fork is halfway to his mouth and Charlie’s eyes go wide.
(See the end of the chapter for
It had been a long time since they had done anything sexual and Cas been aware of that fact for the last few weeks but isn’t pushing the issue. He had an appointment with Ava about this very thing. She told him to let Dean come to him and it’s been bearable. They make out and sometimes dry hump, but Dean always stops before anything else can happen.
“Yes,” He breathes and takes a step back pulling my shirt up over my head. I close my eyes as his hands and lips touch every scar on my torso. Then he’s placing rubber tubing around my bicep and tightening it. My veins are visible within seconds and he has the needle pressed to the largest one. “You want it?”
“I honestly don’t know. I just...need space, but want to feel safe and not like you’re angry with me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"No, you're right. This is terrifying." Dean interjects and takes a few deep breaths. "I'm sorry. Things will calm down."
“Sammy,”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s so easy, Dean. It’s so easy to get you people to do what I want. Your other little friend didn’t have any problems until you got involved. You nearly got him killed, or do you not remember?” Dean stops moving then. The comment is sobering. He’s right. He had nearly gotten someone killed. He takes a few steps back and grabs Charlie and pulls her away roughly. He knows he’s being too rough, but he can’t lose another friend to this asshole. “Tell Castiel, I’ll see him soon.”
“What are you doing here?” Cas’ voice is wrong and Dean stops.
diner
“How could it be you-?”
Dean parks his truck a few blocks away and walks the rest of the way to C Street. Even in a beat up car, someone would find something to take. He doesn’t want to take any chances. He gets down to the opening of the alley and starts the walk down the long road. There are people everywhere. They all look at him like they remember him. Some of them even look sad to see him there again.
Cas just smiles and leans up into Dean. Their lips meet and the kisses are no longer sweet and innocent. They are passionate full of understanding and love. Cas runs his hands down Dean’s back and hooks his thumbs in the waistband of his boxes and pushes them down. Dean sits up on his knees and then leans to the side awkwardly to pull them off and toss them to the floor.
“Hello Dean.”
“I’m going to need you to elaborate on that, Cas.”
“I agree,” Cas laughs.
“Dean I know this is shocking. I know that I should have told you, I just didn’t think anything like this was going to happen.”
By the time I get to the bathroom my palms are sweating and I can feel the pressure from my arousal starting to make its presence known. I close the door and thank the universe that no one else is in there. I walk to the mirror and turn on the water, letting it run for a moment to get cold.
“C Street.” Dean was not expecting that. C Street was full of homeless drug addicts and prostitutes who were willing to do anything for money. He sits up in the chair and looks at Crowley to see if the older man is joking. Dean had nearly lived on C Street before this job to keep food on the table, pay rent, and put clothes on Sam’s back.
“Good point.”
“I feel like you think I’m invading your life and I don’t want that.”
"Dean no one here thinks you aren't okay. We just...we worry. And I think considering what did happen, it's appropriate. I don't want you to feel like you have to hurry up and get better or something. Do this at your pace." Sam says. It's something that he's brought up before in past appointments. He's not wrong. Dean does tend to rush through things just to get it over with, but this isn't that this time.
Monday comes and Sam still won’t talk to Dean. He’s tried everything including making Sam his favorite meal. His father won't look at him because the bruises under each eye is a reminder that he drinks too much. His father leaves for a business trip as soon as the boys leave for school.
Benny tips Dean’s head back and places a warm washcloth on his face and neck. It feels weird to have someone touching his face. It feels so foreign and strange. He realizes it’s been a long time since he’s even touched another person for longer than a handshake.
“I was just thinking about how sexy you are when you’re covered in grease from head to toe.” He confesses. Dean’s cheeks pink at the admission and he smiles.
“I know that I’m sorry doesn’t mean anything, but I am,” The words fill Cas’s ears and he realizes that he feels nothing. It’s not that he doesn’t love Dean because he does. More than anything. It’s that he’s heard all this before and he can’t believe it because if he does he’ll just be let down again.
“Looking for who?” Gabe asks. Dean knows if anyone named Andy were here, Gabe would know.
“You should make sure you’re more punctual next time.” The man says and takes the boxes without another word. Dean leaves, heading home. It’s not like he had left it on purpose. He shouldn’t have taken it off. Everything would have been fine if he would have just left the stupid thing on. He’s almost home when his phone rings. It’s Alastair. He doesn’t even get a chance to say hello.
“It’s a bad word, Sammy. Where did you hear it?” Dean demands in a hushed tone. He doesn’t want to wake up his father and risk him hearing this conversation.
“Is there anything else you’d like to share before we wrap up?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I missed you too, Dean.”
“Dad, please don’t.”
“I’m terrified that I’m doing the work and I’m putting in the time and at the end of the day it’s not going to work. I’m still gonna be fucked up. I’m tired, Sammy. I’m so fucking tired.”
He opens his eyes and Cas is standing there with a mug of coffee in his hand. He sets it down on Dean’s side table and then sits down next to him. He places a hand on Dean’s face and leans in close and places a kiss on his forehead.
If you or someone you know is feeling like ending their life, please call 1-800-273-8255.
“Cas-”
“Stop with the yes sir bullshit.”
"Yeah. Weird kid." Dean replies.
"We aren't labeling things right now. We're just enjoying each other."
There’s that word again “friend”. He’s just a good friend. His best friend, if he wanted to be brave. Dean had had one other best friend, besides Sam, when he was thirteen. They had lived in one place for a near and Dean started to get comfortable. He had loved this boy as much as he loved Sam. His father had found them holding hands in the back of the Impala and then they  moved.

“Cas, can we talk?” Dean finally asks. Cas nods and they walk a few yards away leaving Benny to stare after them near the small fire he had built to keep Dean warm. Dean stops walking and Cas stands with his back to him. He doesn’t like the way this feels. It feels wrong.
“Yes.”
With the thoughts of Purgatory starting to make a permanent home Dean’s mind the bunker becomes almost unbearable. The tension is so thick you can cut it with a knife.
“Cas.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hello,” Dean calls, he turns to look around the other dumpsters in the area, but he can’t find the guy anywhere. He looks again near the usual spot and sees the guy’s bag stuffed under the stairs that lead up the side of the building. He knows better than to touch the bag, but he can’t help the feeling of panic rising up in his chest. What if the guy got sick out here? Got hurt? Or worse?
He gets in the car and drives until he has to pull over because he’s blinded by tears. It’s happening all over again. This is why he doesn’t get attached to people. Sam was lucky that he got away from him. He was so lucky. He can’t risk loving anyone else because they get hurt. He can’t love anyone because they get hurt. God, he loves them. He loves Cas. He feels like his heart is being ripped out of his chest. He doesn’t know how long he’s been sitting in the car, but his phone starts ringing. It’s Charlie, but he can’t answer. He has to leave them so they can be happy.
“What’s in it for me?” Benny’s asks. He’s not stupid. He knows there is going to be some kind of risk involved with trying to find a human and he knows he’s going to have to risk his life to keep Dean from getting killed and letting the portal close and that means losing more memories.
We’ve always been clear about our relationship. Things seem too real. I know that I should get up and leave but the weight of the drugs in my veins keeps me pinned to the bed. I stare at his face and try to determine the look he’s giving me, but my eyes keep closing.
Purgatory hadn’t only changed Dean. It had changed Cas as well. He was more detached and less angel like. Dean had taken a portal from Purgatory to some random woods and was able to find Sam and get to safety. Dean was sure that Cas would never get out of there so, he mourned his friend and moved on. About two months after Dean has gotten back and the nightmares happened only a few nights a week, Cas showed up unable to remember anything about how he had gotten out. Dean was sure that Cas was going to stay and help them but he had left in the middle of the night as soon as he was healed. No note. Nothing. They haven’t heard from Cas in weeks and it’s taking it’s toll.
“You aren’t invading. You’re...you’re being a good friend, Dean. And I called you, remember?”
He didn’t dare look at himself in the mirror. His reflection would only confirm what he already knew. He feels selfish for allowing himself to drink again. He feels disgusted with himself for being too much like his father, in thinking that drinking was somehow going to help. Covering things up with drinking is not only cowardly, it’s a quickest way to get yourself killed. Especially if you are trying to keep a low profile and need to be alert.
The end of his route seems like it takes forever. He just wants to get to the guy and give him the stuff. It’s freezing today. The sun is out but there is a cold breeze and it makes Dean’s cheeks and nose feel like they are on fire. He stops the truck and gets out to walk over to where the guy usually sits.
“I don’t have a lot of time. I need you to do something for me,” The man stands and places a sharp rock to his own neck cutting his skin. The blood dripping down his neck makes Benny’s stomach turn and he feels the familiar burn his fangs cause when it’s time to feed. He slides his tongue over his fangs as they quickly pierce his gums causing his mouth to water. Benny roughly digs his fingernails into the dirt and gravel in an attempt to distract himself.
Charlie sets the folder down on the coffee table across from Cas. His eyes don’t leave it. He stares at it as if it’s going to open by itself or if it will start talking to him.

He can’t help but feel guilty that he didn’t take the time to get to know the guy at all. He’s been bringing him stuff for a month, yet he can’t take the time to learn a name?
“Dean?” Cas says. They are in the kitchen cleaning up from breakfast.
“Yeah.”
He could run. It would be so easy to get away. But he can’t do that to his family again. He can’t make them worry. He can’t make them think that he’s dead or that he’s gone and never coming back. He doesn’t think his brother could live through that again.
It's been sooooo long! Hello.
“Sam, what is it that you think your brother and I have?” Cas asks. Dean can’t help but hold his breath. He’s not sure if he wants to know what Sam thinks. What if it’s not what Dean thinks? What if it’s something he’s not quite ready to face?
Before the conversation can go any further Dean steps into his room and closes the door. He doesn’t want to think about how he failed Cas in Purgatory, how he wasn’t able to save himself and his best friend. He knows that Cas wants to apologize but it’s Dean who needs to be sorry and talking to Cas is only going to bring back those feelings of loss, guilt, and shame. He can't feel those things when he needs to focus on the task at hand. Closing the gates of Hell.
It’s a little past midday when they make it to the edge of the woods. There is a large opening that leads to the edge of the water. Dean scans the area quickly before continuing down the path to the water. He kneels down and scoops up the water by the handfuls and drinks until he feels full.
Trigger Warning: guns

“Yes, sir.”
“You seem different,” Cas says. Dean looks up at him. He’s standing in the middle of the room with his arms crossed over his chest. He still looks angry. Like, the anger he’s holding in is bubbling right below the surface and the wrong word or gesture will send him spinning into a tornado of rage. Charlie stands a few feet away holding the folder in her hands. She turns it over a few times but doesn’t open it. Cas stares at it. Dean looks between the two wanting them to say something or do something. The quiet is making him feel crazy.
“Maybe I can help,” He takes another step towards me. There are only a few feet between us. I can smell his aftershave and cologne. Okay, he’s propositioning me in the men’s room on our first real date. I didn’t think he had it in him.
“I didn’t tell him his name. Dean already knew,” Charlie confesses. Cas stands up so quickly his chair falls over. He stares at the two of them as he backs away from the table. He looks hurt and afraid.
It says.
“What?” There is a scandalized look on her face, “Dude, there is so much to do here. I mean, the bar scene is snoozeville and full of misogynistic douchebags, but there are some awesome events that some of the local places put on. You should come out with me.”

“Am I late?” He asks, bug-eyed.
Thursday Dean finds a note and money on his dresser. It’s from his dad. He won’t be home for two weeks.
“For being late one time? I hardly care about one honest mistake.” The man opens the drawer next to him and pulls out a file. Dean’s name is written on the tab. He opens it and looks over the papers. “It says here you’re willing to work every day?”
“You wish I would say something? Do you have any idea how betrayed I feel right now! I feel like I don’t even know who you are anymore. I don't know what I feel right now.” Dean pulls off onto the side of the road and turns himself towards Cas.
“God, yes,” I moan and close my eyes. I know what I’m asking for, but I still don’t like to watch it happen. It reminds me of a childhood that I have been trying to forget for too long. He presses the needle gently into my skin and the bright blue liquid feels cool as it’s emptied into my vein.
“Where are you, Cas?” Even though the angel hasn’t answered in weeks Dean keeps hoping that he will show up. Maybe this one time will be the time that he comes back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes. I have to go back to school.”
“That explains the peach fuzz, Cas,” Dean says and reaches out a hand to touch Cas’ face before he can stop himself. It’s too late. He’s already done it. He just touched Cas’s face. He thinks he can see Cas blush, but he ignores it.
“I’m sure.” Comes Cas’s reply and Dean can’t stop himself from looking at his friends mouth. He remembers what those lips feel like. His eyes find Cas’s and he feels everything that was wrong in the last few weeks melt away. It’s gone. There is nothing left but Cas and so what if he lets a few tears escape.
“What do you want Crowley? It’s my day off.”
“He just needs time, Dean,” Sam says. Dean lets some of the tension in his shoulders go. Even now, after years and years of being together Dean is still impressed when Sam knows what’s going though his mind by just body language alone. Something in Sam’s words pulls on Dean’s nerves and he finds himself to be more annoyed than anything. Why did he need to give Cas anything? He had thought he was dead for months and now he was just supposed to sit back and give him space?

“Hi, I’m D-”
Dean makes his way to Crowley’s office passing lots of ladies on his way. They all look him over like he’s a piece of meat. Awhile ago it would have excited him, not he just wants to take them all to breakfast and drop them all off at college. He’s slept with a few of them and even though it’s small, he feels like he has a connection to them.
The panic sets in before he can get to the hospital. He’s speeding and he hopes with everything in him that he doesn’t get pulled over. Cas is in trouble and for some reason, he had been used as the emergency contact. He doesn’t have time to worry about how Cas had even gotten his number in the first place.
Dean stands quickly and rushes out the door. He’s not sure, but Marv has a smug look on his face when he passes by. He goes home and makes the decision that he isn’t going to take the watch off unless he’s showering. He can’t have a repeat of today.

Wait, since when has Gabe been an expert in grief and relationships? Sams mentioned him twice now. Sam and Gabriel have been talking? About serious things?
Dean gets a reality check and Sam's the one who wrote it.
“Mr. Winchester?” The man says and reaches out a hand, setting his book down. This isn’t the man that he’s been talking to. This man's voice is cheerful and bright. Too bright.
“Dean, right? Someone left this for you.”
“Maybe not, but I know that he loves you. That counts for everything in my book. Give him time, Dean. Also, I hope that you’re ready to see me every day for the next 3 weeks,” She laughs and lets his hand go.
After an hour, Dean walks Castiel to his front steps and watches him go to the front door. Dean turns to leave but something stops him and he turns back. Castiel has now moved back to the top of the stairs.
“Oh I-I thought you were going to fire me.”
“I told you I LARP, Dean. I happen to be a big deal. I’m the queen actually,” She says and that’s all that’s said about it. She takes off the cape but leaves the flower crown on. He doesn’t know why but for some reason it makes him happy that she leaves it perched on top of her head.
“It’s simple, man. Ask her for a study date. That way if it goes to shit you can just focus on your books and whatever. If it goes good, you can take her out after for a drink or something.”
“What do you mean you aren’t going back?” Benny was gobsmacked. He has spent the last year trying to get these assholes outta here and now this?
“I’m not being weird.”
Cas smiles and walks into the larger man's arms and they embrace quickly. The man reaches out a hand to Dean and nods at him. Dean takes his hand and nods in return.
“What are you laughing at?” He asks. His face is serious, but his hair looks insane. Dean wants to respond he really does, but Cas just looks too damn stupid to be taken seriously and laughs louder while he pulls out his phone. It reminds him of all the times Sam had experimented with using a blow dryer. Cas keeps glaring even after Dean has snapped a photo.
He finishes his pie and a few cups of coffee. He looks down at his phone and he’s been there for close to thirty minutes. Only one couple has come in since he arrived and no one else looks like they are waiting for him. The waitress watches him from where she stands and then walks over carrying a small white box. She sets it down on the table and before he can say anything she starts talking.
“Yes, but how is it different?”
“I’m a cop. I can find anyone if I try hard enough.”

This story is pieced oddly and strangely on purpose.
“This is it,” Cas says and he steps through a tent flap. Dean stops outside the entryway. He feels like he should be doing more to help Cas. “Are you coming?”
“Cas?” He reaches over and places a hand on his shoulder lightly shaking him. There’s no response, “Shit.”
“You’re the one? You’re the one who sent him to the hospital? You piece of shit!” Dean spits. The fear and shock are long gone and anger has taken their place. He knew this man because this wasn’t the first time that this man had hurt a friend.
“Dean?” Charlie asks. Dean looks over at her. It isn’t until she grabs his hand that he realizes that he’d been holding his breath. She gives his hand a squeeze and smiles. It’s small and unsure, but it’s real. It’s honest. Cas clears his throat and Dean looks up at him. He’s frowning.
“Where have you been, Cas?”
“Oh?”
“What were you doing all those days that you missed school?”
Dean’s heart clenches and he hates what he’s about to do, but it’s better him than some creep, “I don’t do this. But, I have a couch if you’d like to get off the street for a bit. My apartment is small, but it’s warm and you can shower and whatever.”
Dean lets the pain in.
“Why did you leave Dean behind?” Benny’s voice carries through the open space and cuts Dean deep. Cas starts to back away from him and it feels like he’s losing him all over again. It takes all of the strength Dean can muster not to pull him closer again.
“So, does the bagel guy give you those?”
“We don’t get days off, darling.” Dean rolls his eyes and stands up in all his naked glory. Crowley doesn’t even hide that he’s looking Dean over, “Maybe put some pants on.” Crowley stands and exits the room leaving Dean to get dressed.
He stands there a little longer and then heads to the bathroom to shower. There is no way he will be able to fall back asleep and maybe a shower will help clear his mind. His thoughts turn to last night and he feels his stomach sink. What if Alistair knows where he lives? What if he had followed Dean and now he knows where Cas is? He stops his route to the bathroom and walks over to the back window and looks out to the parking lot. He can’t see the whole area, but there aren’t any new cars or people standing around. He stares for a few more minutes before his stomach is grumbling. He decides to skip the shower and start some coffee. Charlie is the first one to wake up and walks into the kitchen quietly and sits down at the table.
“Where are you going?” Sam asks closing his laptop lid half way and leaning back in his chair. He’s clearly annoyed at Dean’s lack of faith in Cas being able to fend for himself.
“The day you told him to leave...he came to me and told me that he had started the trials. He wanted to tell you, Dean.” Sam’s face is unreadable and his voice is too calm, “He wanted to be the one to tell you.”
He goes to Oregon. It’s a small town of 1,000. He spirals into depression and sleeps with anyone willing. He works in a grocery store and keeps enough money in his wallet in case he has to leave again. He calms down after awhile. He finds a girlfriend and volunteers for the fire department two summers in a row. After the second summer, he starts getting calls from a strange number. He leaves in the middle of the night. He leaves a letter saying sorry and not to look for him. He doesn’t want them to end up getting hurt. They will be hurt that he’s gone, but that’s better than what would happen if Alistair found them.
Tumblr? sawyerday.tumblr.com
“Sam! Something is wrong with Cas,“ He slaps Cas’ face lightly, again his fingers are burned by his skin, “He just passed out. He’s not waking up.”
The three men make their way into the office and sit in various places in the room. Sam sits in the chair next to Ava's desk and Cas and Dean sit on the couch across from the desk while Ava sits in the other chair next to Sam.
He’s smiling by the time he gets towards the end of his route and he sees the same man sitting between the two dumpsters. This time, he’s reading a book. He has a half eaten sandwich resting on his leg and a bottle of water. Dean places a hand on the steering wheel and presses down twice in quick succession to signal he’s going to back up. The horn blares from the truck and again, it startles the man. His book goes flying in the air and his sandwich falls to the ground. Dean laughs and waves, but the man only glares at him. Dean keeps laughing until he sees the man pick up the sandwich like it’s a dead family pet or something. He looks it over in his hands and even from where Dean is sitting sees the man sigh heavily.
It’s not so much that he’s feeling weird. He’s embarrassed. He had tried to explain what he was feeling that night in the garage and he can’t seem to translate it into words. It's weird to know you want to die and have the means to do it in your hand, but then there's that other side. The side that tells you not to do it. It's not as prominent as the side that wants you to do it. But it's there. How can he explain that he wasn't going to do it, but wanted to?
For those who might be concerned about Sam drinking and driving, he is not drunk and is okay to drive. He had a beer and one shot in the course of an hour and a half.
“Cas?” Dean’s voice falters and it makes him feel insignificant and small. He stands there staring. He blinks a few times just to make sure what’s he’s seeing his real. It sure feels real.
Dean adds this moment to the many he and Sam had shared. Moments that were only for the two of them because, at the end of the day, they were it. Their relationship was more than a little on the codependent side, but it’s what had gotten them here. Their relationship was unique and strong but also very complicated. He’s sure Ava will bring it up at some point, but for now, he’s content with how things are.
Hi guys! I'm still here! I'll be posting a few chapters in the coming week to help move things along for you. I'm sorry about all the interruptions.
“Yeah, I’m alright Sammy.” There’s shuffling on the other end and then the sound of a door closing.
“How do you know? You don’t even know me, Dean!” Cas’s tone has taken a raw edge and it makes Dean want reach out and grab Cas’s hand to calm him. He knows the other man is fighting back his emotions.
“Yes, let's go.” This shouldn’t be happening. This isn’t a thing that happens to him. Dean feels like he’s overheating. He’s gotta get outta the tent. It’s suddenly too small and too confining. He pushes past Cas and starts towards the trail. He hears Benny behind him yell something and Dean waves over his shoulder. His breathing is erratic and his vision is blurring.
Dean slowly slips back into consciousness. He rolls over and presses his face into his pillow. He had had too much to drink and was still drunk. He raises his head slightly and glances at his clock. It’s only been a few hours since he passed out. He closes his eyes and hopes that the pounding on his door will stop.
“Well, I’m going to tell you after you put down that knife and agree to get me outta here,” Dean stares at Benny. There was no way out of Purgatory that Dean had heard of and there was no way he was going to let Benny get top side. He was a vampire for crying out loud. Did this vampire think he was stupid? No way he’s helping this asshole do anything.
“I-I don’t know what you want me to say.” His voice breaks and tears fall down his face. So many questions come to mind. Who took these photos? Why were they being sent to his father? Why would someone do this?
Dean counts seventeen people in the line. A couple of the people look pretty intense, but it seems like everyone has a sense of belonging and for a moment, Dean feels envious of them. He used to belong somewhere. He had a family like this once. People from broken homes and struggling to make life worth it. Just trying to make a little money by doing anything they could. He had done some pretty shitty things back then.
“What happened with mom and dad?” He asks. Castiel looks at him and he looks confused.
This story is pieced oddly and strangely on purpose.
