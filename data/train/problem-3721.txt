"We're not just giving up! We have to fix you!" Naomi shouts back angrily, her scent tangy with sour lemon.
The rest of his afternoon consists of signing some paperwork regarding health insurance and other benefits, and then listening to a workplace harassment video which is very emphatic about things that Castiel thought would be common knowledge: for example not talking about his coworker's scents, heats, ruts, or other physical characteristics relating to their gender.
He picks up the pen and notebook and hands them to Dean. "Play a song. You write down what you hear. "
"If it makes a difference to your choice, just know that I'm not against you mating him despite this information."
"I'm not." Castiel insists. "Traditionalists are... the kind that don't let their omegas leave the house unless they're grocery shopping or something domestic."
If Dean did something similar, would he mind? Castiel decides not, and so he reaches out and takes the folder.
"Yes, well, it sounds like he'll be determined not to have a good time." Balthazar replies. "Doesn't sound like he'll feel safe with you."
The music is a little muffled through the wall, and so he starts mishearing it, especially when he's not paying attention.
"Jesus Christ, Cassie." Balth says, once Castiel lays down his thoughts. "You know I don't care about all that alpha nonsense, you're just fine the way you are."
As Castiel waits, a young alpha, likely only 13 or 14, comes down the stairs and looks him over with a glare. Sammy, Castiel realizes, Dean's little brother. He's got dark hair, grown out quite a bit, and the boy is tall and lanky in the way that suggests a recent growth spurt.
"You just watch yerself." Dean says, still speaking into the receiver despite being face-to-face. "Cause I'm... dangerous. You don't even
He texts Balth about the idea, who replies "Absolutely not, he'll think you're trying to guilt him."
Dean looks at him for a while, like he's trying to size him up. He sighs, and says "Okay, yeah. Let's just get into it, cause you're... I don't know. There's something weird about you."
Naomi pauses. She takes a deep breath, and assumes a more omega stance. Her scent grows a little milder, with a cloying sweetness, he notices. "I didn't mean it like that."
"As if he could lay a hand on you without losing it." John laughs. "You carry that knife everywhere, like I taught you." he gestures to Dean's ankle, where he knew a hunting knife was strapped. "And you know how to use it. If he somehow got it into his head to try something you said no to? You'd probably castrate that asshole. Honestly, I warned him off more for his sake than yours."
Castiel stares after her, baffled. "I didn't mean to upset her." he says to Crowley. Naomi usually took this kind of thing as an opportunity to explain boundaries to her youngest son when they came up, treating missteps as learning opportunities.
He's nervous, he realizes. He's got a shit-ton of issues and if they all come rushing in then he doesn't know how how he's gonna deal.
Dean can't help but appreciate having a professional do this, instead of himself or his brother. The nurse's hands are steady and gentle, despite their size and how they feel like he does manual labor in his free time, and
"Well, there are other tricksters in mythology. That's one avenue to explore." Sam continues. "I guess we need to collect data. You're stuck here for now, and it doesn't seem to be anything dangerous, so..."
He's wearing a green henley, and it's absolutely gorgeous on him. Castiel savors his smell on the very short drive to the Roadhouse, which is only a street away from Dean's.
"No, I love this place." Dean says with a smug smile, and gets out before Castiel has a chance to come around and open his car door for him.
John grabs a beer from the fridge instead of the water he was going to have, and storms off to his bedroom.
Dean, being an omega, is still legally John's ward, of course. Omegas can only officially be emancipated if their legal guardians die and there are no viable replacements named, or relatives.
He stares at her, his heart pounding for a different reason now. "Why are you pointing that at me?" he asks carefully, once he gains the courage to speak.
He hears Dean muttering under his breath and footsteps, and then suddenly the front door clicks and opens. Dean looks a mess, face red and swaying gently.
He's in a classroom, there's no doors, and only two desks. Crowley is sitting at the teacher's desk, his feet up, eating an apple.
He replies coldly that he'd decided that the forced dates were counterproductive, and that he should have known better, and so should John, and then hangs up.
Makes sense, really, once he considers it. That whole scenario didn't make a ton of sense. Sam's vague and blurry wife, Dean only meeting a few people in Heaven... he's surprised he didn't put it together even while in it.
"Yeah, but he's all white knight and proper, Sammy." Dean shrugs. "And don't forget what I told you, yeah? You don't ever have to worry about me. I can handle an alpha. Can handle a drink or two, too."
Dean lets out a muffled squeak when the finger enters, and is a little disturbed to find himself half-hard.
Dean isn't sure he should be excusing it, but the fighting between Sam and Dad had turned dark lately and he needed it to stop.
"Oh how sweet of you." Martha coos. Castiel realizes that without the context of Dean having no choice, it does sound sweet.
"Yeah." Dean lies. He doubts Castiel will give up completely, at best he's expecting unwanted bouquets to show up at his doorstep or something. But hopefully he can hide that from Sam. The kid had enough distractions and worries.
He follows his gut and the scent in the air, and turns down several alleys. He emerges, and looks around, catching his omega walking swiftly down the road again.
"Oh yeah," John says, "I just wanted to make sure, you meant all that shit about waiting and not forcing a mating, right?"
And there's only so many cowboy movies, episodes of Dr Sexy, and so much porn, that one man can watch.
"And once people know you can handle yourself," She finishes gleefully. "then they won't dare take issue with you if you're accidentally a bit rude."
"Ah" Naomi says, eyes amused. "Seems meeting your mate has brought out your alpha. You need to get things ready for him? A room?"
"You know, I didn't know at first that you could remember, and even after I couldn't actually understand." Sam says sadly.
As he heads back to the car park, reminiscing, he catches a scent. Apples, crisp and sweet. It's delicious and right and he knows instantly that somehow, despite all his issues with scent and alpha instincts, he's been blessed with a true mate. He's not sure how he knows, he just does. Maybe that's just how it works with these things, he thinks, how it's meant to be with scents.
Dean talks Sammy into taking him out to a nearby town, on the condition that he strains himself as little as possible.
? "But not an alpha. You're all... instinct-driven and domineering. It's bad enough with my dad, let alone a mate."
Cas wasn't supposed to be able to hear anything in the Empty, but for the first time in a while, Dean prayed.
They all laugh uproariously, and Castiel does what he always does when he doesn't understand what joke he made: grins along.
"You don't think there are any... hidden desires to be unearthed?" asked Crowley. "Your choices, when unburdened by shame or conscience, don't deserve inspection?"
After researching, Dean had a pretty uneventful night. The curse or whatever seemed to be taking a break.
John nods. "Well, fair enough, I did the same. Probably not as thorough as yours, though. Your daddy has a lot of resources and connections to work with. What I'm wondering is, is that why you don't want to see my son anymore?"
Other than that, the day goes smoothly enough. His coworkers are friendly enough, more interested in alpha posturing by closing accounts rather than trying to intimidate anyone, and that suits Castiel just fine.
"I'm not submitting!" Sam protests, though he seems calmer now, having tired himself out a bit with the struggling.
Dean nods, although he wasn't actually quite as old as this Johansson guy. "Age can do a number on you."
"Oh boy." Balth says breathlessly. "That's hilarious. Not traditional. Maybe not like, still living in the dark ages traditional, but you're traditional."
Castiel is mildly curious what on earth John could have to say for himself, so he says "Fine." and sits on a patio chair. John joins him.
Dean recaps the day's radio antics in detail, realizing now that it had started with NSYNC's Bye Bye Bye.
"Would it be suspicious if I changed my last name?" Castiel grumbled. "I don't want his name attached to me."
The whole point of this trip was to occupy him, but he's fallen into a habit of thinking too much now. Even the food isn't enough of a distraction.
Castiel wonders, as Dean orders pecan pie for dessert and he follows suit. Dean is... very different from most omegas, he suspects. Maybe that makes sense, since he's his true mate and Castiel himself is different. It also sounds like John Winchester wasn't there to guide Dean like Naomi did for him, so Dean's never adjusted to being an omega the way Castiel has to being an alpha.
Naomi makes a dismissive noise. "He doesn't know how lucky he is. And I'm not just saying that because I'm your mother."
Castiel is possibly even more hurt than before, now that the hormones aren't making him lean towards anger. "So instead you think I'm insane now?"
"True mates." he echoed, turning misty-eyed. "You know, I had a true mate. It's a real special thing."
Between his honesty about the networking upfront and his defense of Castiel when he wasn't there, Castiel decided he'd misjudged Balthazar, and that he'd need someone he could trust here. They became close friends, an odd pair, but although Castiel didn't quite 'get' Balth's friends from the more artsy schools who he claimed he'd had wild orgies with, he appreciated the less judgmental space they provided.
That proves to be a premature assumption, as he turns the page and sees a rejected license application for Dean to work as a bounty hunter, dated right after he turned 18.
Castiel catches sight of the corner of a greyed out mating bite peeking from under his collar, and rescinds his judgement. The man's a widower. Not everyone's as strong as Naomi.
people. And Castiel's gotten used to ignoring his own thoughts in favor of acting like an alpha, but Dean's alpha brother Sam and friend Benny both thought Castiel was being a terrible person too. They know Dean best of all, surely, and must know that Dean can't just submit the way most omegas want to.
Naomi and Crowley both ask about how his first day was. He's had no strong impressions so far but fills them in on what little happened, and they seem pleased enough with how it's going.
"Got me between a rock and a hard place there." Dean says with a grimace. "Umm... you know my address. Send a letter?"
But, back to Dean. Dean's grades, if you could call the disjointed reports from various schools around the country "grades", were understandably poor. He dropped out of high school at 16 and got his GED, then got a job in this town as a mechanic. Unusual for an omega. John rented the duplex they currently live in, and it's been the first real home for the Winchesters since the arson.
"Yes." Castiel confirms. "I caught his scent but I think I was downwind because he didn't seem to notice me. I tried to catch up to him but he was taking so many turns -" he frowns "- oh. He was trying to lose me. I was so caught up in catching up to my true mate I didn't even realize."
"Weird, like job-weird?" Sam asks, putting down water, a pen and a notebook, and a blanket, and taking a seat nearby.
"Definitely don't do that either." Balthazar chides him. "Just take him somewhere... I don't even know how to describe this to you, rich boy."
"You okay in there?" It's John's voice that snaps him out of it. He realizes he's just been parked outside their duplex, staring forward and wallowing in self-pity, till John had stumbled home from the bar.
Dean had no idea what he was trying to give up. If he could bring Mary back, he would. Hell, he wishes he could take back some of the times he got so mad that he bailed, wasting precious extra time with her because he had no idea how little he had left. But he can't, so he'll make sure Dean doesn't make an even worse mistake.
Castiel waits for him to tire himself out, then from behind him hears Dean rushing down the stairs, saying "What the
"No, of course, I'm not claiming he's solely to blame. But I think he would have a lot to say about our current conversation, and I think it should just be us." Castiel says. "Dean, I want to do this for real or not at all. Will you allow me to court you?"
"No." Charlie replies, the friendly smile gone immediately. "I help maintain the accounting apps. One of which I helped
Dean shrugs. "I mean, feel free to be the one that backs out, I can tell Sam you got pissy about being friendzoned."
Plus, normally Dean wouldn't let Sam talk to him about this stuff because he didn't want to have to think about it. Now, he was going to be forced to think about it anyway.
Castiel thinks about it. He's never truly felt like he has a choice, but... he supposes he does. He's pretty certain he would end up a societal reject, though. High school showed him how people feel about alphas that don't show the proper amount of dominance and instinct.
Castiel is placing the call to the agent before he even realizes what he's doing, and she tells him it's an open house this week, 2-6pm, so he can head down now if he likes.
He'd never admit it to Sam but as vain as he is, the occasional implication that he had 'feminine features' had always made him uncomfortable.
He's staring at the page, trying to think of a justification for this nonsense, when Sam snatches it.
As for the question of children... he'd always just assumed that barring fertility issues, he would be expected to sire pups for his mate. That his mate would have a strong biological need to have them and to deny them would be cruel. But if Dean doesn't feel paternal, maybe it's not right to push him into it. Castiel can wait until he's ready, and if Dean never manages to make that breakthrough, he can live with that.
He's startled when he hears a request dedicated to his name. But Dean is hardly a rare name, and it clearly has nothing to do with him. His hunter's instincts just don't like coincidences.
This talk makes Castiel wants to tell him about his condition, that he's not instinct-driven or domineering at all, just trying to be what he's supposed to be. But that's not the kind of thing you just tell people about on a first date. And not something he wants Dean
"Aw cmon." Dean's finished his sandwich, and put down his plate to edge over to Castiel. "You can tell me. Pleeeeeee-"
"I do it on my own half the time. I did it myself always before you were old enough, I can do it again. Sam's 15, he doesn't need you coddling him anymore."
"Tough shit." Balthazar retorted. "You're gonna tell him you'll leave him alone if he wants, and you pray that he forgives you and gives you a chance, now or someday in the future. You're going to give him a choice."
"I know." she smiles smugly. "But I assumed the deal was off after Castiel's coming home party, when you announced that you were -"
"Good." John nods, and gives him a warning look. "Because you really don't want to find out what happens if you do."
"Geez Sammy, first the 'research' you told me to do, then this. You keep reacting to this stuff like it ain't your idea." he jibes.
He knows it's weird to kinda miss him, but they both had a soft spot for each other, despite being totally at odds about 80% of the time. Despite the horrors of his demon phase, they'd actually had some fun too.
"You don't answer to your mate." Castiel explains. "You said you struggle with your omega instincts, and clearly you still do, maybe there's just no point -"
"Oh, so all your little jokes about us weren't really jokes? Well fuck you then." Dean said angrily. "Jesus, I'm straight, okay!?!"
A few days later, though, Castiel receives a call from John Winchester himself, asking why he hasn't been coming to see Dean. Apparently he'd only just got back into town and learned about it.
"But, yeah... I couldn't leave Sammy alone, you know? Not after all this, after he's lost so much too." Dean continues. "And you. Cas, you sacrificed yourself to keep me alive. I'd be spitting in your face.
His stepfather sighs. "I know. Your mother is just -no, she wouldn't want me talking about her to you like this. Just know that the smells were anger and hurt."
"A friend, Cassie, not your mom. Or an omega you happen to talk to a little at my parties, or telling your brother's wives how good their food is at Christmas. Someone you hang out with on purpose."
to go on dates anymore, Dean will jump at the chance to be free of him. But if Dean will never let his guard down on forced dates, then this is an exercise in futility.
"Oh, no, he's uh... he's kind of reluctant. I don't really understand it, Balth." He tells him the whole story.
actual explanation for this bullshit? Some kind of... weird Heaven rule that I don't know about, says you can't visit Earth after being in the Empty, or something like that? Cause you better lead with that."
"I don't really want to hang out just for that reason." Cas tells him, frowning, and Dean gets that it isn't exactly flattering.
One night he got properly drunk with Balth for the first time in his life, and to his horror he found himself blurting out his whole story to his friend. The scenting difficulties, the lack of strong instincts, the failed medical interventions and his coping mechanism of pretending he just didn't care.
Dean shook his head. "That's not it at all. I don't know this guy. He's just some alpha that thinks he can make me his and boss me around because I'm an omega."
"Yeah, well..." Dean hesitates. "I guess it's just good to see you again. Despite everything. I never got a chance to say thanks for taking one for the team. You surprised us."
Naomi eyes him, calculatingly. "This is... Okay, I need to think about this. And you need that hormone shot out of your system. Then we'll talk."
Castiel wakes late the next day, unmotivated. He eats his breakfast with his parents, and Naomi picks up on his mood and asks him what's wrong.
"Glad you understand when you're beat." John laughs. "I'll see you when this son of a bitch is in the ground."
He stiffens when a cold, wet, gloved finger touches his entrance, and the doctor spreads lube around in a way that reminds Dean way too much of prepping a girl for anal stuff.
"Thank you, sir." Castiel says formally. It's not that he hasn't talked to Crowley much, it's that it's never happened just for the sake of talking before. "I had some concern that you would be offended."
He's shown around, assigned a desk, and given a default password for access to the company's databases. He'll be having orientation with Health and Safety and Human Resources soon as well.
"So how do you know that it's part of the 'curse or whatever'?" Sam asks. "Unless you've watched this kind of thing before as a control sample."
Dean frowns. Sure, he did sometimes get unexplained arousal anyway. He'd been told in high school health class that random boners are just a part of life as a dude. But those two events were pretty close together, and maybe it wasn't a coincidence...
He settles into an armchair, and listens to Dean's breathing steady out. He'll keep an eye on him overnight, he decides.
He must be upwind of me, Castiel realizes. He has to hurry and catch up to his mate, before he loses him. If he lives in town then there's a chance they'll meet again, but he can't risk that the omega is just visiting or passing through.
"The house is too big for us anyway, since all the kids grew up and left the nest." chuckles the old man. "It deserves to be filled with pups again. Now, not to pry," Barry pries "I see you aren't mated... "
I will tell you what I feel when my scent changes. Your brothers and some of Crowley's staff that I trust not to tell him have agreed to do the same. This will help you practice reading scents."
"I want a house." he says, half chuckling, but while his step-father joins in, his mother doesn't seem to be amused.
Gavin has the best of everything, nannies, tutors, and he is sent to a top-tier kindergarten when he is old enough. Castiel feels a pang of regret that he'll likely never be close to his half-brother. He hopes this lifestyle doesn't leave him utterly spoiled.
"I just wanted to make sure you got home okay..." Sammy says, and Dean melts. "Oh, Sammy." He gives him a hug. Sammy's not 'too old' for them today, it seems.
John glares. "I've seen it, anyway." he retorts, then taps the papers into a neat pile and hands it back. "Fine. Later, Novak."
He closes his eyes in frustration, and he can feel the ghost of that scent. Or is it not a ghost? His mate was just here. He breathes in deep, and feels some instinct awaken.
"... that is, I hate to admit, a rather valid point." Crowley acknowledges. "But still, you acted in self-interest and self-preservation in that moment. When left to your own devices, you chased the same pleasures of the flesh that you enjoy as a human.... as well as... strange flesh."
John eyes him approvingly, and claps him on the shoulder. "Alright, let's get a booth and talk. A beer please, Ellen." He wander over to a booth.
-" Dean cuts himself off angrily. "No, Cas. If I don't have to, then I'm not going to go on another of these dates."
"Oh, and this won't be different?" Castiel asks. "Now listen, this is my house and those belong to me. Give it
Sam throws up his hands. "Fine. You think of something. I've got to make your crippled ass some dinner."
"You know, you're remarkably chatty today." Crowley sniped. "Usually when I try to convince you of something you're all snappy comebacks or silent resentment."
That was cool and all, but he couldn't let himself get distracted and go off on a tangent right now.
Dean forces himself to focus on the picture of him fishing on the dock. Blue skies, low wind... until he manages to fall asleep.
to think, he'd rather think about this curse or whatever, or even why he doesn't like being seen as feminine-looking, than think about...
Castiel thanks John and Dean, and John downs his second beer before he shakes their hands and they part ways. Ellen grabs Castiel as he goes to settle his bill and he almost fights back until she growls to him "You better be good to that boy. And if you and his father force him into a mating, I swear I'll bury you both in by backyard."
"It's really nice, though, Balth." he continues. "It's got four small bedrooms, besides the main. There was the option to buy it furnished, which I checked that I was interested in because the couple put so many years into this house, it all looks like... home."
"You slept better than I've seen you do before," Cas continued "And you prayed to tell me that Jack was looking for a way to get me out, but you didn't seem that upset. I thought you... didn't care as much as before. Because of what I said."
Castiel nodded. "I thought I wouldn't be having pups, and I didn't feel that upset. So I think I'm okay with not having any."
He hears them muttering to each other for a little while, a hand placed over the phone instead of muting it.
"Nah." Dean waves his hand. "I don't think he'll like, punch me or anything like that. He'll just be all shitty about it."
John also has a beta, Robert Singer of Sioux Falls, listed as his next-of-kin, though they are apparently unrelated - if anything should happen to him, he would become Sam and Dean's legal guardian.
discussions of rape(forced mating) and of infertility. character briefly lies about being infertile.
thing. You're meant to be together. If you were alpha or beta I'd have more trouble making you do the right thing, but I'd still be trying."
" but gets a bunch of porn, and one article about a guy who had a brain injury and claims he turned gay after it.
"I'll talk about my boys as I please." John demands, then settles a bit. "Besides, it's not an insult because he'd do it on purpose. He's stubborn enough to override any natural instinct if he puts his head to it."
"Thanks." she pants, and Castiel notices that the woman's an omega. She smells like strawberry bubblegum.
Castiel wants to say he won't, but reminds himself it's a hypothetical. "You could give me your number if you want. Or I can message your father."
Dean's eyes widen, and the sight of his green eyes fully open, fixed on Castiel without anger for the first time, almost takes his breath away. Dean is beautiful.
He feels a little bad for leading the guy on, especially since he'd apparently worked up the nerve to make a move on a guy for the first time.
"I got out a couple of months ago." Cas continued cautiously. "And checked in on you and you were... playing with your dog. And going on hunts. You seemed okay. Happy even."
." Castiel defends himself. "I thought you just meant, I don't know, people who might try to get you in trouble for it."
"It's not just that." Naomi insists. "You need this too. You can't be getting into fights all the time, you'll get hurt badly once you're grown. Can you even smell that I'm upset? I'm your mother, you should know my scent best of all, and you can't even do that."
His mother's scent spiked with antiseptic. "And that smell is guilt. I fear this is partially my fault, Castiel. I struggled with my omega instincts even before Chuck. And I've raised you with lies, which may be why you failed to learn to pick up scents."
"There ya go." Mick says, patting his shoulder in a companionable way. "That's some nasty injury you got there."
Castiel leans against the counter, watching him cook, and he tries not to think about how domestic it feels. "I take it you don't actually plan to hang out then."
He focuses on his little brother, standing in the living room looking accusingly at Cas. "Oh! Sammy! Shit. It's uh... fine. Yeah, Cas is just here because I, uh... called him."
Ironically, he soon became Castiel's only friend of the lot. Coming back to pick up a book he'd left behind, he managed to overhear them talking about how he was weird and kind of a jerk, that they only sucked up to him because he was Crowley's stepson and would be a useful friend. Balthazar was the only one who disagreed, saying "Cassie's not so bad", and became indignant when they said they were only in it for the connections, saying they were a bunch of 'cold hearted leeches'.
The doctor withdrew, handing Dean some paper towels. "All done! You're prostate's good as new. Shouldn't have any problems, but all men over 45 should get it checked at least once a year if you want to catch anything bad early."
He goes to work, where he's been assigned a few small clients, but is also helping out with a larger project. A lot of it is grunt work, meant to help him settle in and get the hang of operations. He helps out with whatever's asked of him: proofreading and double-checking, filling out paperwork for red tape.
Naomi was pushed into it, he remembers. Chuck had wanted a houseful. He'd assumed when she'd mentioned that, that it meant she hadn't wanted as many kids. But maybe she hadn't wanted any? She'd said herself that her omega instincts were troubled. Maybe she'd been like Dean.
"I guess it was." Sam admits, putting the food down while avoiding looking at the screen. "But could you, like, stop?"
"You know... it must have been my big scary alpha brother challenging him that scared him off." Dean teased.
Saturday evening, after Castiel comes home from sparring to keep up his fitness and fighting skills, he gets a call from an unknown number.
Dean goes to stand, as if he's going to fight an alpha, of all things, but John puts his hand on his shoulder.
"No, please, tell me." Sam forces his mouth into a pursed position, but the desire to laugh is all over his face.
Sam helps him walk out, and Dean throws a charming smile to the waiter on the way out to let him know the note was welcome.
He browses houses online for the rest of the time, and he stops scrolling when he sees the most picturesque bungalow. It's got a perfectly sized porch, with a swing seat on it. Castiel can already see himself and Dean cuddling on it on a cool fall evening. The garden is just big enough to not be a hassle, but be pretty. It has one main bedroom and four small additional bedrooms. It's gorgeous. It feels like the right one.
"Oh?" Castiel says, surprised. It's very rare for an omega to work in that kind of alpha-dominated field. Most omegas only work if their family needs supporting, so higher education isn't a priority.
"Don't you even say that." Dean interrupted. "Better for WHO? You thought I'd just be fine knowing you're stuck in the Empty, alone??"
Recovering from the accident, he couldn't really do most of the other stuff he distracts himself with
Castiel drives to the mall to buy some gloves and a hat for the early spring chill. He's not sure where he's misplaced his old cold weather gear, having just come back with an MBA from Stanford, California, and having gotten used to a warmer climate.
Castiel sighs. "I was afraid you'd say that. I... really wish you'd reconsider? I know we got off on the wrong foot, but I think if you got to know me you'd see that we could be happy together."
"Okay, that I can at least help you with: Don't do that." Balth tells him. "Doesn't sound like he'd want that, and he certainly won't have the clothes for it."
Castiel wonders if he should read it. He's trying not to think too much about his absent mate, but on the other hand he could gain some insight into Dean.
He missed Cas. Last he'd checked, there was no way for humans to get him from the Empty, and Jack had said he'd "work on it".
Castiel shakes his head. "That decision was made before any of this. It didn't feel right, true mate or not, making him spend time with me against his will. I wanted him to choose me."
Dean looks offended, and Castiel tries to figure out what to do. He'd never thought he'd meet his true mate, let alone be rejected by him. Weren't you supposed to instantly want to be with your true mate?
As the day goes on, Dean questions the taste of both his neighbor and the local radio station. There was also an odd amount of what he could only describe as "gay songs", and he did not mean that in any kind of derogatory way.
"Right, right, like I'm stupid. You're probably here to take 'vantage of me. Didn't come crawling back like you thought, huh?"
"Thank you." Dean says, nodding but not really making eye contact. He didn't want to embarrass himself.
Castiel shrugs. "I'm saying I never really thought about it as optional. Just thought I'd get mated and then pups would happen. But it's... okay, I think, if I don't have them."
Cas just stands there, with his cute confused expression that Dean would normally find so charming, but frustrates him even more right now.
"I've never heard that one. Are you sure? Can I see that part my background check?" John asks urgently.
Dean shakes his head. "I thought about it, but that wouldn't work. My dad would've called you to see why you'd changed your mind, and cleared things up. No, I needed to see how you'd genuinely react to the idea of not having kids."
And security was a nice change of pace. They moved from a cramped apartment his mother struggled to maintain to a manor, the food was plentiful
He picks up a pencil and writes about it: bar hopping with Crowley, drunken karaoke, meaningless sex, murder.
Dean curses under his breath, angrily scrambling the eggs. "Must be some professional... god-fucking-dammit. Well, that's no good anyway, it's not gonna make Sam feel better to hear his dad's off chasing a serial killer."
Naomi puts down the papers. "That kind of radical honesty, though... it will probably be very disruptive."
"Ugh. I know, I know, I'm a liar." Dean mutters, cracking the eggs. "I just... he's got enough to worry about. I can't have him stressing about me. I'm supposed to take care of him. And then I went and got fucking wasted last night."
"Well, I went to college." he explains with a smile. "My friend Balthazar used to throw parties somewhat often."
Dean is waiting at the car door, and seem annoyed that Castiel decides to open it for him. Still, once they're in the car all Castiel can really care about is the scent of Dean in this cramped space. He feels settled for the first time since yesterday. His mate is with him.
He even has to do a little quiz at the end, which he finds quite silly but he supposes there's reasons for it.
He considers telling a doctor about it, but... this is kind of embarassing. He keeps thinking people are saying gay and bi? They'd think he's a closet case gone crazy.
Dean doesn't even know him, he said. Well, Castiel supposes that's true. If Dean doesn't want to mate a stranger...
"Instead, I have made new arrangements." Naomi announces, pulling out some papers. "First, I think you should see a psychologist. I've arranged an appointment for Monday."
Balthazar listened quietly, then to Castiel's surprise he received a hug. "Already knew you were an odd duck, Cassie, so don't you worry. I like you just fine without any pesky instincts."
"She'll tell me if she wants." Crowley shrugs. "People don't like prying, even if what's found was barely hidden. Remember that if you ever mate.
the house, dear?" Martha asks once they're back on. "If you can't see yourself in it without your mate, that's fine, but we still think you're the best candidate."
Castiel nodded enthusiastically. "I'm just trying to clear it up, he didn't smell me and I accidentally scared him. Ellen's just protecting him."
Crowley's fingers tap the sides of his teacup. "Look, I'm not going to tell you what to do about this, and not just because Naomi would hate me. You have to make choices on your own, Castiel. " he shrugs. "You can keep trying to be a 'proper alpha', but that's still a
"Aaaand I'm outta here." Sam announces, picking up the plates and scurrying off before Dean started doing any more 'research'.
"Well first, I don't want an alpha. Second, it's obvious that we're going to be incompatible so that would be a waste."
"A month minimum. And then few months no hunting." Sam said firmly. "And I don't want to hear any complaints -"
Castiel pictures it. He could turn one of the bedrooms into his office. It would save him time on his commute, and maybe it was time he moved out. He could still see himself in it, though hopefully not on his own forever. If Dean truly never came around, surely he'd eventually meet someone else?
Castiel sighs. "I think... this should be the last of these mandatory dates. It wasn't right of me to allow this whole situation to happen the way it did."
"Besides," Crowley adds "sounds like he's not the most conventional omega himself, so I don't think he'll be complaining if he finds out."
"It is. Just an old biblical one, like mine. He jokes that that's why we're meant to me friends. I call him Balth for short."
"Yes you did. That's why you don't want to tell Crowley, isn't it?" he realizes. "Can't have him knowing you put out a defective one."
They were best friends after that. He's 22 now, but Castiel had never had a best friend before, and he hoped that Balth's promise to stay in touch and stay friends would prove true.
tasty, and Castiel no longer had to wear hand-me-downs of clothes that were already bought second hand in the first place.
Chuck had been a beta, of course, surely no Alpha could bear to leave his wife and nursing child, thought Castiel. He felt a newfound appreciation for his developing alpha instincts. They wouldn't just be fighting and... fornicating. There was protection and loyalty.
"Crowley knows about your condition." she assures him, surprising him. "He knows everything, actually. While you were away for college I ended up telling him about your father."
Dean gets up. "I'm sorry I didn't tell you I was gonna have a friend over while you were gone. Did you have fun at Kevin's house?"
Robert Singer, from this report, does not look like a good candidate, Castiel thinks. He suffered a car accident a few years ago that made him require the use of a wheelchair. Since then he hasn't been doing well, having been hospitalized for alcohol poisoning several times and six months ago was arrested and fined for disorderly conduct while intoxicated.
He starts to doze off, and finds himself wondering if Mick will bathe him again tomorrow, and feels a little bit of eagerness.
"Oh." Cas says, relaxing a little. They stand together, and Dean rubs small circles into Cas's back until he feels his anger and stress finally melt away into tiredness. Emotional tiredness, anyway, this being Heaven and all.
Fuck, this lie was going to bite him in the ass. If he didn't hang out with Castiel again it would be suspicious.
"Right." Castiel snarks. "I'm sure having to go bounty hunting during his formative omega years had nothing to do with that."
He needed that right now. He was still pretty rattled from dying, after all, despite the calming aura of Heaven.
He usually kept his mind nice and busy listening to music, but that's not really been helping since this curse thing happened.
"And thank you, for being responsible." the doctor replies. "You don't know how many men avoid this for years until something's wrong, just because they find it too embarrassing. It's a sign of maturity to put your health over pride."
Dean sighs. "You know, I'd call bullshit and say you're just saying that to get me to think we're compatible... but you were pretty chill about the infertility thing."
Castiel knows he shouldn't be letting another alpha push him around or threaten him, should probably make her submit, but he really doesn't want to start problems with someone clearly so close to Dean. So he shrugs of her hold on his shoulder and says "I'll thank you not to make threats, empty or otherwise. I'll warn you, I'm perfectly capable of looking after myself." He puts down a generous tip and marches out the door.
He rushes forward for a moment, but then the young man ducks into a seedy looking bar labelled "Harvelle's Roadhouse."
After a while he instinctively pulled up to a motel. He blinked, wondering why there were motels in Heaven, but realized that he must've conjured one up.
She closes her eyes. "Your father didn't die when you were a baby, he died when you were three." He smells sourness, and she confirms it's the anger scent.
"Lucifer agrees, but Michael will argue if you say that in front of him." She tells him. "He was closest with your father, and couldn't accept that he abandoned us. I think until my bite greyed out he truly expected him to walk back in the door someday with some tale of kidnapping or something like that. I think he's still in denial that he left voluntarily."
try to befriend an omega? What's the worst that could happen? This woman seemed in a good enough mood, anyway. "Hello. My name's Castiel." he says, smiling. "I'm a new accountant here."
The IT department seems surprised to see him, but one of the betas there points him to her desk. The box of flash drives is there, and Castiel fumbles through them. He doesn't know what "Aloha Mora" means, other than the first word being a Hawaiian greeting, but he supposes code phrases help cancel out the security risk of keeping these in an unlocked drawer.
He's still surprised with himself sometimes, remembering his childhood before Crowley and how unlikely it would have been for him to be careless with winter clothing. And if he'd somehow lost it anyway, he'd have been devastated.
is confusing for you. Well, what's done is done. Keep the rest of it under wraps, and hopefully Winchester doesn't tell where he got the information if he gets caught with it."
"I've been thinking..." Castiel says hesitantly. "He really doesn't seem to want to be a typical omega, not very strong instincts... what if I told him about -"
If Dean doesn't answer, he's not really sure what to do. Leaving seems irresponsible, but breaking and entering seems extreme.
"I wanted to talk without your dad." Castiel says, and Dean nods. "He's been very insistent on this arrangement."
"Because eventually you're going to mate me anyway." Dean surprises him again with his honesty. "So your little plan to Stockholm Syndrome me or whatever, so you can feel better about what you're gonna do, can go to hell. I'm not going to play along so you can feel better about forcing yourself on me!"
Sam's grades have gone from good to excellent since settling down, Castiel notices. Not surprising, stability is important for a child.
Balth tuts. "Cassie, Cassie, all that time tagging along to those art school parties and you never picked up that some people aren't as traditional as your family is?"
He's a cute one, Castiel has to admit, and seeing her cradle him she wonders if she still feels a lack of omega maternal instinct, or if that was a side effect of not feeling safe with Chuck.
"He says he's your true mate." John frowns. "I can tell he isn't lying, his scent's so loud and happy and excited... just like when I met your mom." he adds somberly.
He blinks. He's not used to these thoughts and impulses. Pups can wait, he's only finished college and he'll have to see how many Dean wants and when he wants to have them.
"Sorry." Sam says sheepishly, slapping a bandage over the cut, and Dean snatches the keys and eases into the seat.
Naomi glares at him, sour lemon tickling his nose. "Don't be immature. It's not only insane people who see psychologists. This one is actually an expert in scent reaction issues. All you must do is talk to him. If he can't help with the scent recognition then he will help you adjust to your condition."
"You called him??" Sam asked. He frowns. "Did you drunk dial him? Dammit, did you get absolutely wrecked all by yourself -"
"It's thicker than average, is all I'm saying. It's not a plain boring story about a boy growing up in a large American town."
Castiel slows. The man is finally stopping somewhere, he doesn't need to run after him. Castiel runs his fingers through his hair, adjusts his tie. He hopes the chase hasn't ruffled him too much. Though if his omega lives in this part of town, he probably isn't hung up on freshly pressed suits, any more than Cas was before Crowley.
"Or what?" John asks, clearly on speakerphone with the sound of the car rumbling around him. "You'll call the cops, tell them someone stole a copy of the info you got from some shady source with FBI access?"
"Then stay. Where I can keep an eye on you." Benny insists. "Now, how about I get you the house special."
Castiel sighs. Their food arrives, and Dean stuffs his face with jambalaya, while Castiel pokes at his corn maque choux and sausage.
Suddenly a large, burly looking alpha man walks up to their table in a chef's uniform. His eyes are blue, though not as light as Castiel's and he looks upset.
"Why should I be the only one suffering?" Dean retorts, but stops the video and closes the window. "But what's weird is that I find it hot!"
"Okay." Dean says angrily. "Well for a start, the forced outing with a strange alpha was fine, thanks. He didn't try to forcibly mate me at the end, so it could have been worse. But you're probably disappointed that didn't happen, so you could get me out of your hair. I guess I've had a break from all the omega bullshit long enough? Or was it just more convenient for you that I was independent enough to get on without you when you were off on hunting trips?"
Most of the alphas stay to wat at their desks and work through lunch, but two of his alpha coworkers decide to join the betas in the cafeteria so Castiel decides it's okay for him to do that too.
The guy seems flustered, and not even slightly offended, so Dean feels bold and turns the flirtation up to 'shameless', throwing in a wink as they finish up the order.
In college, he'd been perceived as a child of privilege. He was one now, he supposed. Quite a few people had taken initiative to introduce themselves and befriend him, particularly one British beta named Balthazar. He annoyed Castiel at first, partly because he called him "Cassie" and seemed pompous, and also because he outright said that Castiel was a great networking opportunity. He joked that he knew they were fated to be friends because they both had biblical names.
Dean snorts. "Yeah, Dad made me wear my date night outfit. Said I better not sabotage this on purpose."
"We've been looking for the right buyer for a while now." Barry answers. "This part of town's not what it used to be, so most folks that still want to raise kids here can't afford the place anyway. We'd consider lowering the price or renting to a family, but then we wouldn't be able to afford our new place."
Surprisingly Michael has something to say about it. "How dare you disrespect our late father's legacy?!"
"Ah, still so direct." Crowley shakes his head. "A man like me doesn't get married without a thorough background check. Just to make sure the skeletons in the closet aren't too crowded." he winks.
"I've never done this before" Sam reads, and his expression softens. "But you're so hot... give me a ring sometime if you weren't just kidding. - Joe"
He picked a recent event. Mick the nurse. He imagined the spongebath, then imagined him taking liberties, turning it into foreplay.
"Thanks for everything doc." he says. He's still feeling shy, but the man had a finger in his ass, for god's sake, so surely Dean can look him in the eye.
People hide things, his own mother was proof of that. And Crowley's background check had probably helped their relationship as it developed.
"Woah. Really? That's.... good news, man" Dean says, then his eyes narrow. "Um... why're we talking about that here though? You could've said this at my house."
Dean nodded. "Alright. I mean, it still doesn't make a difference to me, because I don't want an alpha."
Anyway, good luck at university. And stay in touch with your mother. I'm pretty sure you're her favorite, even though she'd never admit to such a thing. I don't want her moping around worrying."
Sometimes he sees things like this and wonders how defective he could possibly be, if others also need basic things explained to them.
When Sam goes to the bathroom, Dean snaps a photo of the receipt, not wanting to take the original since Sam would probably notice it was gone.
The next page confirms it. John started bringing Dean along on some of his bounty hunts when he was as young as 13. Castiel is horrified.
It sounds like Dean is starting to come down, so Castiel just nods and settles down to watch some tv with him, even though it appears that Dean has settled on infomercials.
"You little shit. I oughta sign you over to this guy right now. Although that's hardly a punishment."
The omega comes out, and even though he's angry he's so clearly lovely. Castiel is blown away by his green eyes and he's also happy to see the omega is somewhere around his age, give or take a couple of years.
The day after the first date, Sam had told their father he wished he'd go die on a hunt. Dean had barely blocked John from slapping Sam across the face, and Sam had bolted to the Roadhouse for a night.
He manages not to react outside of a groan when the doctor finds his prostate and checks it out. He knew he was kinda sensitive there, and he desperately didn't want to make the doctor uncomfortable.
He goes inside and brings out the documents that relate to the arson and murder, and the follow-ups.
about it. Dad's the one with the obsession. You're just some clueless -" Castiel feels offended "- white-collar putz who didn't realize what he was doing."
"I actually met my true mate yesterday, that's why I'm here." Castiel says with a small smile, and the couple are delighted by the announcement.
He sighs, and sits to eat his lunch while having to listen to the two other alphas argue about who was going to close the deal they were currently both assigned to. It would be smarter to work together, but they seemed to have a rivalry going.
Castiel shakes his head. "Don't be silly, you're my true mate. If you can't have kids then I guess I'm not meant to have kids."
"Then I'll take it." he announces, and the older couple chatter happily about arrangements and moving dates and whatnot, while something in Castiel settles.
When the school called her in for the third time, Naomi doesn't interrogate him this time. She frowns, apologizes to the principal, and the drive home is awkward. Her cleaning product scent, lemon with a hint of antiseptic, was heavier on the antiseptic today.
"I... is there some reason you don't want to be mated, Dean?" A thought occurs to him. "How old are you? I assumed you were at least 18."
Castiel lets him go. Dean comes over to fuss over the young alpha, who rubs his wrists and continues to glare at Castiel.
He'd been on a casual date in college, with a beta girl named April. It had gone... fine, and had ended in his first and only sexual encounter, but Castiel had only done it because he felt the need to prove something. She'd had... less noble intentions as well, he found out later, so he at least didn't feel like he'd 'used' her.
He enjoys the fantasy, something out of a cheesy Casa Erotica video where a sponge-bath turns into sex. It helps that he knows how it feels, the memory still fresh in his mind, his body smelling slightly of soap.
"Dean!" he hears Sam say with relief. "Hey man, you're gonna be okay. The doctors said that the rebar spike didn't hit your spine."
Balthazar sighs again. "Okay, Cassie, you know what? I can't do this anymore. You listen here: you need to stop this 'forced date' shit. It's unethical, it's fucking you up, AND it's fucking up your relationship with Dean."
, Dean notices, and when he checks for attraction he sees this spell or whatever is definitely still in place.
Dean whips around. "Just so we're clear, I didn't mean to be all friendly or ... anything else, last night, and it didn't mean anything. You might as well forget it ever happened."
"He's the one who got out of the Empty and didn't bother to tell me, okay?" Dean replied angrily. "So he can be the one to contact me."
He supposed wrong. The blood tests for his hormone levels were draining. The scent tests left his nose itching and overstimulated. There were alpha "roleplay" situations to try and stir his instincts, and some of them were humiliating.
The sponge brushes him firmly, his arms, his face, and Dean starts to relax a little. It's actually a nice enough feeling.
Sure, Claire had at one point come out, but if there'd been any confusion or questioning, Dean hadn't been privvy to it.
"You don't know anything about this, you're a beta." Naomi dismisses. "Besides, you don't get a say about my boys. We agreed!"
"Okay. Well. Tell you what. Why don't you do more... research... maybe come up with a theory." Sam says. "And then we'll see what can be done."
Dean's eyes are half-closed when he comes back down, and he places the pillow at the head of the couch, then kneels down.
Dean needs to get out. He's not only laid up, but he can't even enjoy music like he used to because of this stupid situation.
Castiel hadn't considered the consequences: John would be starting his wild goose chase with renewed energy.
He tries his cowboy movies, but the same thing is happening and their chaps are also all assless now.
"Hmmm." Crowley says, suddenly behind Dean and reading over his shoulder. "Oh yes, I remember the triplets. Among other things. Oh, the fun we had..."
It's a struggle, but things eventually improve. Naomi becomes pregnant, but stays involved with him. She encourages him to keep going to school, saying that isolating him will not help him learn to deal with people, and his psychologist agrees. Instead she sends him to self-defense courses to tide him over and keep him from getting hurt.
level of consent. And I'm glad you weren't worried about me then, while I was out worrying I'd have to fight off a rapist. I'm glad
He looks around, and catches sight of an incredibly good-looking young man near the exit of the carpark. Broad shoulders, gold-brown hair, great ass. That's all he can see though, because the man is facing away from him. In fact, he's walking away.
"He attacked me. I'm not hurting him." Castiel explains, and Dean slows down a bit, scenting the air which Castiel knows must reek of Sam's anger but not his own. "He just needs to submit."
The guy reminds him of Benny a bit, not just because of his accent, and blue eyes, but his build too. A real man's man.
"I'm not infertile. I know it's a shitty thing to lie about." Dean admits. He at least has the decency to look a little guilty.
"Listen... you know from experience that I always do a thorough background check on anyone who may become a part of my close friends and family."
"Dean... I may cry." Crowley says, in the half-mocking tone that Dean knows he only uses when he doesn't know how to admit something is true or surprising.
His first day, he enters the elevator, and then holds the door when he sees a small redhead running towards it.
Dean wanders back into his house, and Castiel follows. There's an empty whiskey bottle in the kitchen sink, but otherwise things seem to be in order.
"Right." Dean rolls his eyes. "Yet here we are, because I'm your true mate so I'm not allowed to say no."
"Not one bit." Sam retorts, but then his voice starts to waver. "Plus you weren't even actually dying, so you scared the shit out of me for no reason at -"
She quickly married a very rich beta named Fergus Roderick Crowley who wanted a heir. He made it clear that he had no interest in parenting her sons, but that they may live in his manor as long as they wanted and he would fund their educations. Castiel thought he was sleazy and pretentious, but Naomi assured him that the arrangement was perfect for their family. She hadn't wanted an mate that would try to take over her parenting. He just provided security.
Castiel blinks. Sam seems to be trying to provoke him, on the verge of challenging him, a ridiculous thing for a young alpha to do to with someone like Castiel. This is... awkward, really. Sam is no threat to him, other that rumpling Castiel's date outfit a little.
Esbon has a cafe (with about 8 items on the menu, but it's a cafe), and even a small restaurant/bar that is ironically called Sam's Place.
"I bet. That's not even everything my investigator dug up on John Winchester, mind you, I just asked him to include anything that was related to Dean."
Castiel is graduated and has come back to his hometown. He catches a scent that he never thought he'd be luckily enough to smell.
He'd thought about telling him, as time went on and he realized how he felt himself, that he loved him too, but he wanted to say that to the angel's face, not whisper it into the sky not knowing if it was even being heard. It would just hurt too much.
"That's not the same..." Castiel struggles to explain himself. "This is just dinner. I would never do something so... permanent or traumatic as force you to mate with me. And anyway I'd never have to force myself on you. You're my true mate. If you just get to know me and stop pushing me away, you'll realize we're perfect for each other, and you'll want to mate me."
They get into a cab outside, avoiding bring Baby to the hospital since their use of stolen identities would be discovered sooner or later. Changing license plates was a hassle.
working out, working on Baby, driving, going out to get drunk and laid, even cleaning for Jack's sake.
He's confused, thinking about Heaven, and Sam... did he seriously manage to have a car accident in Heaven? That didn't add up...
"Hey!" he calls, but the man doesn't seem to hear him. He could be calling to anyone on the street, Castiel supposes.
He sits with his group, and notices Charlie sitting with her own department, engaged in a serious debate, probably about IT.
, I have no idea how the investigator I hired obtained this information, and I assume it's all above board." Crowley clarifies with a smirk. "But better safe than sorry, understood?"
"Why does everyone keep calling me that?" Castiel mutters out loud, and Dean laughs for real this time. It's gorgeous.
"Good morning, darling. Your assignment for today -" Crowley says in his usual, smarmy way "- is to write an essay called 'What I did during my demonic vacation'."
Dean laughs bitterly. "Funny 'cause I think those pills are what got me killed, you know. They made me a little slower. Not that much, just enough to matter in a fight, it turns out."
"I tried to kill Sammy. I might not be sure about a lot of stuff, but I'm 100% sure that I don't want that on any level at all."
He hurries to the car park exit, and catches sight of gold hair and a brown leather jacket turning a corner. He follows, and find himself on a less reputable looking street, no omega in sight.
Castiel continued to be different. He'd not been great at interpreting facial expressions and body language, but now he was also expected to read people's scents to the same degree. His lack of understanding was even more noticeable, and came across as a lack of care. He stepped on toes accidentally if he didn't realize someone was angry, causing other alpha boys to fight him.
Sam shrugs. "It's not time-sensitive, you don't seem to be in danger, and we don't have any leads yet. What's the big deal?"
Dean raises his eyebrows. "Don't get cocky. I'm still not interested in mating, ever. Now, you're taking me... hmm... to the movies next week. There's a new Marvel film out. You're paying. Been ages since I went to the movies without sneaking in."
"Anytime." he says, and she gives him a very searching look. It makes him a little nervous, to be honest.
"If you do I'm sure you'll change your mind." John continues. "He's your true mate. And if you don't go on these dates, or try to scare him off on purpose, I swear to god I'll sign you over on the spot for your own good."
He wonders if he should show Dean the house, he thinks. If it stirs his instincts, maybe it would stir his true mate's, too.
Dean runs a hand through his hair. "Yeah, well I wasn't doing that well the first couple of months, Cas. Not fucking well at all. Especially when it started looking like there wasn't any way to get you back. I... wanted to die. I almost..."
"And you're the only one who wanted it furnished." Barry tells him. "I'm sure you'll change a thing or two but you can appreciate what good is there."
They talk about how the case was wrapped up, the stolen identities they're using in this hospital, and Dean mentions his strange dream.
"I don't love you." Dean says. The sudden statement takes the breath out of Castiel's lungs even though it would be far too early for Dean to feel that way, true mates or not. "And sorry, but getting to know someone who I'm being forced to spend time with isn't going to make that happen. I can't trust you like that."
Castiel sighs. "He came and confronted me a few weeks ago after we stopped seeing each other. Wanted to know why. Then we got talking about the background check my stepfather shared it with me. It turned out that my stepfather hired a real professional... and um... John may have read it and learned something new about your mother's killer."
The bar doors swing open behind him, and he looks back to see an older alpha walking into the bar. He looks strong but his skin is sallow and he smells like beer, this early in the day. An alcoholic, Castiel supposes.
A doctor comes in and Dean can't help notice he looks a striking amount like Doctor Sexy. Tan with long dark hair.
"And no one who came around liked the place like you do." his wife adds. "There was some interest from developers, but they'd knock the whole house down. Most of the private buyers were talking about renovations, knocking down walls to make it open plan, paint it white, make it look like every single house looks on those renovation shows. One wanted to be a landlord and rent out all the bedrooms individually."
"Okay. Here's what we'll do." She says calmly. "You don't have to do hormone shots anymore or any other medical intervention. We'll have to do another blood test now and in six months, -" she holds up her hand as Castiel goes to object. " -but only to make sure you level out after this one treatment."
John drives off, and Castiel exhales. He goes inside to put the papers away, flipping through them only to realize -
Some kind of elaborate prank maybe? But Gabriel's dead, and Dean can't see Sam fucking with him when he's laid up like this.
Balthazar huffs. "I don't know Cas, most alphas would either respect his wishes and give him space, or force a mating bite on him. Never heard of this weird in-between act. You want me to tell you how to make him like you? Darling, I have no idea."
The bar isn't busy since it's a Thursday night, so Jo gets a break. Okay, and maybe she wants to check in on Dean, who's been left at the Roadhouse by Castle or whatever his name was.
Sam looks at him with the most bewildered expression he's ever seen, and that's saying something. "... okay. Cool."
"Yeah. Go ahead." Dean says, trying to think about gross monsters instead of the warm, soft pressure against his body, especially when the guy cleans his more...
Dinner time rolls around, and Castiel is dreading it. He comes up to the door, knocking, and to his surprise Dean is ready and steps out right away.
"How considerate." Dean says in an amused tone. "I'll take the last option. Think I'll hang around and shoot some pool after."
He doesn't get too friendly with these alphas, but they are useful. It's easy to own this persona, to stop caring too much about how he comes across. Maybe this is how it's supposed to be, after all? His alpha instincts.
"Quit acting like such a martyr. You got a true mate and he's good looking, rich, and patient as all hell. And don't try to sell me that you don't find him attractive or don't like him, cause I know from experience all that true mate stuff is true. It's the most amazing thing that can happen to you. In a year from now you'll be thanking me from whatever mansion this dude probably lives in."
Dean blinked. The feeling was not just anger, but embarrassment. Bordering on humiliation. The kind when someone made him feel stupid.
The fight was short but intense, Michael having four years on him, but Castiel had the finesse and skills to counter him.
Dean wants to protest, but he knows he's definitely not always seemed that way. "I don't know, gotta grow up sometime."
"Okay." Castiel replies, marveling at how at ease Dean is around him when he's drunk. "He calls me Cassie."
"Differences. A ton of them. They argued like, all the time. Lots of night of Dad sleeping on the couch or just taking off for days to cool down, mom crying or going on a pissed off cleaning spree."
"If you have as much faith in true mate relationships as you say you do, you must believe he'll come around and give me a second chance." Castiel retorts.
The next day, Dean turns on Dr Sexy only to find that all the staff are male now, with nothing else changed.
Dean looks at him warily. "I just don't, alright? I don't want to mate an alpha ever. You said I didn't have to, Dad."
There was Zeus snatching up Ganymede, but it didn't say if the guy was originally straight, or if was he even into Zeus afterwards.
"That's none of your -" Dean cuts off, glaring at Sam. "I didn't tell you about that! How'd you know?"
Castiel feels a little embarrassed. "I was advised that you probably wouldn't have fun at a high scale restaurant, so I dressed to suit the place we're going."
"Oh, great. Thank you." Charlie nods to him as she plugs it in and starts typing and clicking furiously.
They get a seat at a table in the back, far enough from the jukebox that it's not too loud. Dean orders a bacon cheeseburger with fries, and Castiel decides he'll do the same.
Dean pushed the laptop aside. He was feeling kinda stir-crazy, being stuck in the bunker. He was feeling a little better.
"Hell yeah!" Dean said, even though he knows Sam is teasing. "Just like being a patient on the show."
"Especially with... potency." the doctor adds emphatically, clearly knowing where Dean's priorities lie.
Castiel sighs. His father Chuck went missing and died on a work trip out of town when Castiel was just a baby. When he was 3, his mother moved them to another town, not able to bear their home reminding her of their loss. He can only assume his three sons only further remind her of his loss. He can't blame her.
Crowley sighs. "That you'd sleep in the same bed with me." They'd shared Naomi's heats to produce Gavin, but otherwise had separate rooms.
"Thank you, John. But this situation is a bit complicated, obviously I don't want to force myself on Dean."
He frowns at the article, which starts off explaining that 'gender exists on a spectrum' and that the official definition of "bisexual" varies, apparently.
"I know you reacted well to the baby thing." Dean cuts him off. "And yeah, that was... serious surprising, don't get me wrong. But you're still the guy who brought me here against my will."
They enter and the delicious smell of Cajun cooking hits them. Castiel only regrets that it will overpower Dean's scent during the dinner. They find their reserved seating and the waiter comes over to take drink orders. Dean refuses wine, ordering a soda instead.
He brings the plate in when he's done, and gets an approving moan from Dean which makes his cheeks flush.
"You don't ever have to worry about me, okay? If he tried some shit, I've got this and you know I'm a pro with it." He lifts his jean leg to remind Sammy of his hunting knife. "Dad even said himself he expects me to use it if it comes to it."
They finally come to his floor, and Castiel steps out. "Have a nice day, Charlie." He doesn't get a response.
"Yup." the nurse answers. He tucks some thick towels under Dean. "Can't let you develop any infections cause of bacteria build-up."
"Well, that's quite the impulse, but I'm excited that your alpha instincts are so active." Naomi says. "Crowley?"
Crowley lights up, and Naomi's happy laughter drifts down to where Castiel is dressing to see the real estate agent. He really is very happy for her.
Sam shakes his head in disbelief, but doesn't get a chance to reply as a truck comes out of nowhere, horn blaring,
Granted, his lifestyle didn't exactly allow him to have long-term friendships where he got to watch people's characters change in real time. He saw people when he saw them, and he'd catch up on their lives as best he could. New jobs, new relationships, new whatever.
"... Okay, I gotta ask... is this some kinda... weird way of coming out to me?" Sam asks. "Cause you know it's totally fine -"
Dean didn't really know anyone who'd had to figure themselves out. He'd met people, and they were either straight or not.
"We think you'd appreciate it the most." his wife adds. "We just love the thought of a young couple settling in there again."
Crowley shrugs. "Not yet, but it may come in useful eventually. If you want, you can keep that folder. Just don't go flaunting it around."
Dean wasn't in the mood right now to start figuring out his dream home, and motels were what he associated with privacy, safety, somewhere to stop and think.
"If you got something to say, you better say it." John says, authority entering his tone. He'd never stood for this kind of disrespect from his boys.
He sings along to the real lyrics, "I'm bad to the bone!" and then catches Sam smirking knowingly at him.
John sighs. "And let me guess, the kid isn't interested in seeing you now that he's calling the shots. It's a stupid game he's playing."
His packaged burger comes, and Castiel finally takes his leave. He feels very hollow as he drives away, but he's still holding on to hope. Maybe Dean just needs some time.
And it's closer than Crowley's manor to a few accounting firms that had expressed interest in hiring him. He didn't want to work for his stepfather, as okay as the man seemed, because he knew accusations of favoritism would hound him. They all payed well enough, he decided right then to take the one closest to home. This house, that is.
"Come on Dean, this isn't about him, you're just mad because you're having to deal with an omega thing." John retorted. "You always hated having to deal with anything like that. So you're trying to throw away the holy grail of relationships just because it's related to your biology."
Of course, if he does something and is immediately disgusted when it's over, that'll be kinda awkward.
Dean's desk is a student's desk. He's only vaguely aware that he isn't a child or teen. Everything seems vaguely fuzzy.
Dean snorts. "Oh you know, I just wallow around the house, waiting for my prince to come and save me from my dreary unmated existence."
Why can't you cope in more healthy ways, Dean?". And then the one time I try to do it the 'right' way, you just think it's cause I don't fucking
Castiel feels like a bit of an idiot right now. He calls Crowley and tells him about John, and gets scolded for showing him the documents.
They end up lying on the bed, Dean's arms still wrapped tightly around Cas. He can't bear to let go yet.
"When you were 4 months old, he disappeared. I wish I could assume he left for good reasons, but he wasn't happy. Despite me doing my best, giving him a house full of children like he wanted." She said bitterly.
One of the main reasons Sam did most of the research was that Dean would try to read up about suspicious deaths in a town, and then get sidetracked by a really interesting death or detail and lose an hour or more going down the Wikipedia rabbithole.
That night Castiel goes back to Crowley's manor and has dinner with him and his mother. Naomi still seems a little distant since he upset her last time, but Castiel isn't sure if he should apologize if he doesn't actually understand what he did. And she doesn't seem to want to talk about it, so maybe he should leave it alone?
Dean would be so happy. Like him and Mary. God, he loved her so much. That's why no matter how goddamn much they fought, neither could ever leave. Because it was still perfect, dammit, better than anything else could ever be.
Castiel sighs. "I... know. But what was I supposed to do? Walk away from the omega fate itself marked out for me?"
"He's... not trusting of strangers, true mate or not. I'm courting him first, talking him on a date tonight."
Dean nods. "Yeah, he's just all messed up cause of mom, okay? He couldn't deal with me rejecting my true mate so he did something stupid. But he doesn't want anything... terrible.... to happen to me, okay? Never."
you were angry, you don't need to tell me." Castiel retorts. "You smelled kind of sour? And then cloyingly sweet. I guess you calmed down."
"Yep." Charlie rolls the p in a snarky sort of way. Oh, Castiel's displeased her. Great. He's not sure why she's upset at the idea of being a secretary though, surely most omegas here are?
"Not cool, Sammy!" Dean says, confused by his brother's reaction. "I'm not into that kind of thing. This... curse or whatever, is making me get turned on by gay stuff too!"
One day when he's between tasks, she starts mumbling angrily to herself and gets up. Castiel decides to just ask "Anything you need done, Miss Bradbury?"
"That you didn't take mine?" Crowley smirked. "No offense to you or your brothers, but I wouldn't want that anyway."
It was a nice motel, too. Not fancy, but clean, a comfy queen-size bed with Magic Fingers. The minibar was presumably free.
"Hey there." a southern voice drawls. "The name's Mick. I'm your nurse tonight. I'm here to help get you cleaned up."
Castiel does his research, and decides on a Cajun restaurant not far from Dean's neighborhood that has good reviews. He'll probably feel safer on his own territory. He calls and books seating, just in case.
As interesting as that is to Dean because of the curse, it mostly just pisses him off because it reminds him that he's being messed with.
"You're under 21. And drunk dialing isn't a good look for anyone." he replies. He should hang up, but first... "Are you somewhere safe?"
"No!" Dean says loudly. He looks at Cas, wide eyed, and starts lying. "No, look, I just decided I wanted to... try being friends. We hung out last night."
"So you warned him off." Dean softens just the tiniest bit, then hardens again. "Well, at least I know now that you care about
He decides not to share any more, the older couple have had their gossip and it seems to have made them happy. Maybe he also indulges in the fantasy that he's just a nice, patient alpha waiting for his true mate to come around.
"I'm good at finding people." John replies, lifting his hands in the non-threatening way. "Not here to fight. Just wanted to hash this out man-to-man, because you've done a real 180 since I left for my last hunting trip."
Castiel thinks that there's something wrong with Dean because he doesn't want a typical omega lifestyle.
"I do." Naomi smirks. "It's gratifying to finally feel... sure of you. And yes, I'll sleep next to you. I want you to see what you can do about the snoring though."
"... does this mean you want to... that you accept my proposed... amendments to our arrangement." Crowley mutters.
John orders another beer and launches into the story of meeting Mary, his late wife and Dean's mother, how wonderful she was and how perfect their relationship was, and Castiel finds it charming although Dean doesn't soften.
"None of that, now." Naomi insists. "Anyone who gets to know you will know that you're the gentlest alpha there is." She frowns at that. It had been a year now and Castiel's alpha instincts hadn't really kicked in properly. He didn't feel very territorial or feel the need to prove anything to anyone. This didn't bother him so much, but he hoped he'd be a a good alpha to an omega someday.
8pm rolls around, and Castiel shows up to a run-down duplex. John welcomes him in, and shouts up to Dean to finish up getting ready. John's leaving to meet some friends at a bar, apparently.
Dean looks at him. "Yeah, I bet." Bitterness invades his smell again. "I don't even know you, dude."
Castiel goes upstairs and finds the bedroom that smells like Dean. There are only a few personal touches, like the small display of hunting knives. He takes what he came for and comes downstairs.
Castiel follows Dean, not realizing that he's trying to get away from him. He also allows John to force Dean to go on a date with him.
He goes home, feeling restless. "Mother?" he calls, and finds her sitting having tea with Crowley, talking about what school Gavin would be attending when he turned five.
Dean has just finished his terrible hospital dinner when a man in scrubs comes into his room, wheeling a trolley.
When Mick washes his chest, though, he tenses up a bit. This feels a little too intimate, despite the nurse's touch being very professional.
Dean glares at him. "Everyone says that about omegas. Sure, people change, but there's a really solid chance I won't with this."
