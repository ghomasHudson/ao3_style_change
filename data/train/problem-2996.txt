And then Cas looked down to see the cross-stitch and let out a rumble of laughter. The rumble turned into guffaws and he was leaning on Dean to stay upright. And then they were kissing. Harder than before, but still just as sweet. Dean could feel wetness on his cheeks and frowned. “Hey, what’s wrong?” He asked, pulling back and letting their foreheads touch.
“Can I help?” Jack asked, sounding hopeful.
He had gotten a frame from Walmart and it was still in a bag in his closet. He got up and slapped a hand on Jack’s shoulder and went to his room. Of course, Cas was already there on their bed and more than a little dirty from his day out in the garden.
“I knew you had it out for my plants ever since I spilled the soil on your bed-,”
Even if too much of his extra money went to shitty whiskey. Maybe he spent too long at the bar even after closing. Sometimes he would avoid seeing Castiel or Sam for too long. Yeah, he sucked at talking about any of his feelings. Even if he snapped at them when he was tired. It would be okay.
“Dean, I wasn’t sure you’d be here,” he admitted, glancing down at his shoes.
Dean lay in the hay where Sam had left him, but his face was calm, the blood was gone, and his chest rose and fell softly. Sam let out a soft sigh, tears trailing down his face again, as he realized that Dean – and Cas – were
Oh, no. Dean closed his eyes and felt the pain of Castiel’s statement hit his heart. Naomi Shurley was a bitch. Raising Castiel and his three siblings hyper-religiously, she had already caused Cas more guilt and pain than he deserved. His older brother Michael was an asshole, always snitching on Cas to their mom, and his younger sister Anna too young to know much about their corrupt cult-like church. His last brother, Gabriel, was the only one Cas could trust not to screw him over. Three years ago at age eighteen Gabriel had brought home a massive cake decorated in the colors of the pansexual pride flag, declared that he “liked anything with an ass” and promptly was kicked out. He lived two states away with his own hybrid bakery-tattoo shop. Don’t ask how that works, Dean never found out if it was actually legal for food and ink to be in the same place.
“Really, Angel?” The nickname slipped from his lips without thought. He felt the tension he had been carrying with him for years leave his shoulders as Cas shyly nodded. Dean laid his head down on Cas’s shoulder, trying to process the events of the night. He needed comfort, and his friend – boyfriend? – was right there, as always.
And a message from an unknown number:
on Sam’s contact in his phone, and he put it on speaker so he could keep driving.
“Okay, uh, Dean, I need to talk to you in the hall,” Cas said, with an urgent look on his face. He grabbed Dean’s hand – and sweet Jesus did Dean never want him to let go – and dragged him through a few doors to a space where no one would overhear them.
Dean’s hammering heart skipped, his body reacting to the confession of the angel more strongly than he felt he could put into words. Eyes blurry from tears and hands aching from holding Castiel’s trench coat so tightly, he murmured, “I didn’t want to assume, Cas. I hoped - ”
“I love you; I love you, fuck. Fuck, god, Cas. Cas, Castiel, please, God, fuck, Cas I love you.”
When Dean woke in the morning, he regretted not washing his face and brushing his teeth before he passed out. Checking his phone, he blinked blearily at the amount of text messages he had received.
Even Charlie had to be a bitch today. He chucked his phone at pillows on his bed and let out a loud groan. Why did he have to fall in love with his best friend? Why were all his friends complete assholes? Probably because Dean was an asshole himself.
“Yeah, well, now you do. What do you want to do with that information, Cas?”
Sam’s sobs were the only sound that filled the barn. Save for the rustling of the wind outside and the occasional muffled cry of an animal, Sam Winchester’s grief consumed the air around him, filling up the universe with sorrow. After everything he had been through with Dean, losing him to a simple hunt hurt more than he could process. Dean had just closed his eyes for the last time when Sam pulled him off the pole he had gotten pushed onto. He tried to ignore the bleeding, laying him down on the floor of the barn and wiping his eyes with his jacket sleeve. Sam took in one last deep breath and stood, turning on his heel to find the kids that his brother and he had managed to save.
“Hello, Dean. How are you feeling?” Dean hesitated, not believing his ears, but finally turned to see Cas. There he was, in all his re-found angelic glory. The man was practically glowing, a slight smile on his face, blue eyes beaming with hints of tears already welling up in them. Dean let out a soft laugh, moving forward to clutch Castiel tight to his chest. He dipped his head into the nook of Cas’s neck and simply whispered his name into the fabric.
“I’m good, Red, how are you?”
“I know, I love you too.”
“It was the only way I could get in to see you, Cas! I had to!”
“I’m in love with you, and I want to be with you, and I want you to move into my room, and, and, Cas, I want what you want too.” They were so close, the words were whispered against Castiel’s lips, barely brushing. Cas hitched in his breath and tilted his head ever so slightly. He pressed his lips against Dean’s.
Almost because he immediately fell back onto the bed.
“But…but will John be mad?”
He sighed. He wishes it was a date.
“How long have you been back?” Dean asked, hands clenched in the terrible tan trench coat he had grown to love the sight of.
“You know, your father hated a lot of things he had no right to hate. He was a bundle of hatred, Dean,” Bobby cut in, “It didn’t matter that you loved Cas, ever. Before and after Mary, John had his own problems.”
Dean’s mind came to a screeching halt. Garth. Who thinks that Dean and Cas are dating. Who thought that they have been into each other since high school. Garth, who was talking to Castiel, and Castiel, who looked as if he had just been slapped across the face.
“Hey, wait, maybe Eileen and I could come visit you and Cas this weekend? It would be nice to see you two.”
“Thanks.”
“What? Cas, what does that mean?”
So, he wasn’t in the Empty. That was good. At least, Castiel thought it was good. The Empty had frozen him down to a whisp of himself; the ooze wrapped its way around his grace, sucking it out of his vessel. Scattered around the Empty were the vessels and former angelic beings, so cold, so stuck. He opened his mouth, tried to yell in the Empty. He thought he saw a familiar face. Maybe even a demon he knew. An angel. There was no air for his vessel to breath, he was human, and he fell.
“The night before he died, he told me he knew. I said he was wrong. But I know. I knew, and I have to say it. I’ve known I was bi since we were in high school, I was probably seventeen or eighteen. I told Bobby and Sam today. I can’t keep it in anymore, Cas.” Dean bit out, eyes closed and tears flowing freely. He knew that crying was for men too.
“Well, actually, I’ll have you know I’m bisexual,” Dean mumbled, picking up the spatula and examining the melted plastic from where it landed on the stovetop. “But Cas and I aren’t dating, Sam.”
“I never thought for even a moment they were joking about us because
It wasn’t Cas’s fault he was working himself to exhaustion. It wasn’t Sam’s fault either, although they both wanted to blame themselves. Cas was working as both a barista and an assistant librarian, and Sam was working part-time at a restaurant while finishing high school. Dean still had his job at Bobby’s repair shop but was bartending on the side as well as – to Cas’s anger – selling his plasma for money. They could afford rent and food just fine. Cas also payed for his online classes, having chosen to return to school for a degree in library science. But Dean wouldn’t let Sam pay a penny of the rent or help with anything. No, Sammy’s job was to enjoy being a teenager in the way that Dean never got to. Dean’s plasma and bartending money went to the college fund he had set up once claiming Sam as his dependent and cutting ties with their father legally. Sure, he was tired. But if Sammy could go to college and put his brain to good use, it was all worth it. If Cas could get his degree and be happy at the library, it was all worth it. If Dean’s family was okay, it was all worth it. Even if…
he thought. He swallowed and inhaled, turning back to Bobby. Something inside him was telling him that today was the day. Maybe he was just fucking tired.
And who is "I" now, I am still me, able to be killed, able to breathe every speck of dust as myself, to see every ray of sunshine and feel every drop of rain, and when I die, my consciousness will return to the universe and I will become one with everything again until I come again as a human being. The power of creation used to maintain eternal balance until one day I return to nothingness.
In heaven, they say the shortcut to happiness is forgetting. When you forget the unpleasant experiences, only good memories remain. But whether you forget or not, things are always there for the taking, even if they become invisible and transparent, they are still there.
Dean held up his face, " Man, it feels like yesterday."
"I'm sleeping, and I don't know what I said when I'm sleeping, no one knows what they said when they're sleeping!"
Dean was silent for half a second, "... So did you mention to them that I killed Hitler, and my love story with Cass."
"Shut up, Sammy."
On my last trip to the Void, the man set in the chair said to Cas, "See you in ten billion years, Lucky Mr. Lucky."
So that day, in the kitchen of the bunker, I quietly asked Cas what he had done on that day.
And he said to me, "Thank you, kid."
It's easy for humans, or people, to fall into a chronic state of self-involvement. This confusion and ambivalence may come from a loved one, a partner, or oneself. It includes irritability, anxiety, and frustration, and when chronic conflict is irreconcilable, that's why people need a therapist. Although this never applies to Castiel. First of all, he is not a human being, and secondly... Ah, that's basically all there is to it.
"Couple therapy?"
According to what Cass tells Dean, angels are like Alfie, they're in heaven helping people in need and taking charge of what they like. They may pass you by at the apple stand at the morning assembly and be the neighbor you wave to after watering the flowers.
"Oh! Tell the boy --"
Sam breathed a sigh of relief.
"Is it about Castiel?" Alfie grimaced.
"What? What’s point?"
"And I thought you only cared about the pleasure of getting undressed." Cass replied, repeating the same thing on Dean, now that they were both fully dressed.
Sam wanted to nod, but the good news was that he held back and worked out a reasonable next sentence in his head, " Well, if you have to say that Cas is avoiding you, which there is no reason to, why don't you ask him yourself... Dean, why are you playing your phone?"
So, for now, let's return to earth.
"You're not good at lying." Dean laughed.
I don't understand what that means, but Cas seems to. He turns his head a little incredulously, and Dean gives him a wink.
"No, no, no, Cass, this isn't some Makeover Dreamer," Dean hastily denied, "everything is fine here, it's just that, we almost never take a ride together or anything, there's always a fire chasing our asses every time, and Impala could really use some leisure time. "
That helped me awaken Cas from the nothingness, and helped the emptiness promise me the deal.
"But I feel regret, I feel likes I missed so much... I even didn't get to respond to him while I was alive," Dean's voice shook a little, "Sam, I used to have a list of all the stuff I wanted to do on that imaginary vacation, you, me, Cass... Maybe even Jack, a vacation, to Hawaii, or Vegas, but now..."
Dean replied, "No, but I just feel it that way."
Castiel didn't understand the phrase, "Uh... I don't..."
"But you're good at it," Cass said, "I enjoyed being with you, Dean, and the experiences and memories I had with you is really joyful... But they're all too good, beautiful and fragile. That's why I...concealed, as you say, or hid away, because I was afraid that if I took them all for granted, I wouldn't be able to afford to lose them, or to lose you."
“I’ve always been comforted by the presence of grace, Dean. Even at my old church. This is not religion. This is faith, belief in good, trust in the world. Love for beauty. You need grace, Dean. I’ve been watching how you act recently. You don’t think you deserve anything good. You want to just work yourself out, only relaxing when everyone else is gone. You’re going to dig yourself into a hole this way, Dean.”
“Please, Dean. I think it would help. I just know that no matter what I have this grace with me, and I wish I could share it with you.”
Castiel opened his mouth again, straining now against his vocal cords. “Cold.”
Turns out that Castiel’s idea of having faith in the world is in simply enjoying life’s simple pleasures. He took Dean to a state park and made him sit on a hill overlooking a lake. He didn’t want to admit it, but maybe Cas was right. Maybe this was the best part of life. Dean’s life was loud. The garage was loud. The radio played. His coworkers yelled and swore and laughed. Sam’s high school graduation was loud. Their apartment was loud. The TV was on, playing Dr. Sexy (Dean’s idea) or a nature documentary (Cas’s idea) constantly. But this, this was quiet. Sitting high on a rocky hill looking at the water below him, Dean breathed in the scent of the outdoors. It was nice. His flannel was tied around his waist and he had his hiking boots on. He hadn’t worn hiking boots in ages.
“Why wouldn’t you be around to spend time with?” Cas asked, head tilting slightly. Dean watched the movement with a bit of fondness. It was so
“Yeah! It’s great. Hey, Sam, right?” he nodded to Sam, awkwardly standing in the corner. “I’m glad you and Castiel finally ended up together!” Garth said. Dean opened his mouth to protest but remembered that he had told the nurse on the phone they were dating.
“We did. Thank you, Meg. Dean, I’m afraid we will need to be heading out sooner than later. Meg will cover for me for the rest of tonight, right?” Cas said, completely unphased. Dean’s heart was going way too fast for his body. What was Cas doing? Were they going to the Roadhouse, where Cas would tell Dean that he needed to move out? Was Cas going to move out? He managed to nod along and follow Cas numbly out of the library. The cool fall air hit his lungs and made Dean squint. His eyes started to tear up for several reasons now. Was this the end of his friendship with Castiel? Fuck he hoped not, he didn’t think he could even move on from Cas without his friendship. He could live without Cas loving him romantically, but he needed Cas as a friend.
“Yeah, Bobby, I know. I’ll be alright, stop being so paranoid. I’m good at what I do,” he murmured. He was already having a rough day, what with flashbacks hitting him while he tried to work and his twitch acting up first thing in the morning.
he explained, shrugging slightly. “I guess they were joking about it because everyone knew we liked each other.”
Sam had to know. The kid was seventeen, working full-time over the summer at the Roadhouse with his friend Jo, whose mom owned the place. Dean eventually fell into a routine of picking Sam up from his shift at ten, dropping him at the library, where Cas was also just getting off a shift, and then returning to bartend for four or five hours. This way he could avoid Cas telling him all about whatever smart man was at the library today begging for Cas’s attention. Dean knew he wasn’t the only one who wanted Castiel. He almost wished that Cas would settle down with one of them and move out, so that when Sam left for college, Dean would have the place to himself.
he thought. People had asked him if he was part of the campus move-in team so many times he was ready to explode. When he explained he was an older brother, they asked if his parents were with him and his brother. Sam was used to explaining to strangers that he didn’t really have a dad, just his older brother, and his roommate; Dean was not used to explaining that. Sometimes when he showed in places where kids and teens where people would assume that he was a teen father and give him dirty looks. He bit back the urge to chew them out and instead just focused on what was important – supporting Sam.
said Cas. Dean was glad no one ever said anything. Sam knew a little. He tried to talk to Dean about it, but Dean never budged. Eileen tried a few times to get through to him. Bobby noticed. Ellen and Jo would cut him off if he seemed out of it. They knew.
“I…I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas cut in, frowning and refusing to meet Dean’s harsh glare. “I didn’t realize you felt so strongly about the topic,” he said. Dean looked at his face critically. Cas’s gaze was lowered, and his brow was furrowed, but his lips were trembling slightly, and his jaw was set. Sad? Why was Cas sad? If anyone should be, it was Dean.
Dean never said anything, but it was fairly obvious he was infatuated with Cas. He got some shit for it at the garage he worked at and their group of friends would even poke fun at him, but since Cas was never uncomfortable, he never bothered to move out.
That sent a cold spike through Dean’s heart. A plus one, that meant romantic partner usually. Sure, Cas had come to Dean’s family Christmas dinners a few times and he had returned the favor by escorting Cas to his brother Gabriel’s wedding, but this wasn’t just their family. Their families all knew that Dean was in love with Cas and were able to joke about it. This was Castiel’s work environment. That meant meeting the ever-elusive coworkers Meg and Bal. Cas had been meaning to introduce him to his coworkers for a while, but this wasn’t how Dean expected that to happen.
“Who’s there?” Sam called out into the dark, whipping out his flashlight, and as it clicked on, he found himself face to face with bright blue eyes and a face of shock.
Cas pulled back and smiled, slightly sadly. “Would you like me to take you to the bunker and return to heaven?” Sam frowned.
“What?” Dean echoed his own thought. He looked at Castiel, who was biting his bottom lip and looking up at Dean hopefully.
After chugging the three beers and removing his jeans and overshirt, Dean got in his bed without even washing his face. Let the tears wash his face tonight, Dean was too hurt to bother. He didn’t want to run into Castiel in the bathroom or hallway. Shit, was Cas still expecting him at the event tomorrow? He ran a hand over his gross and tear-tracked face. He’d see tomorrow. For now, he let himself wallow in his misery. How could Cas do this to him? Castiel asked him to pretend to be boyfriends, put on a movie about roommates in love, and pretend the entire time that he had no idea that Dean was in love with him already. Cas knew. Everyone knew. Dean let his touches linger, smiled at him when he wasn’t looking, let him drive Baby. He turned over in his bed. Sleep didn’t come easily that night.
“You…Cas, you serious here? Because I’ve been through way too much today to deal with anything fake.”
“Y-yes. Yes, I am. What – what happened? Is he okay?” Dean frantically asked, standing up from his chair so fast that it almost fell over. Sam rose too, walking closer to attempt to hear the conversation.
“No, this is happening. Dean, I love you. I have for years.”
“Tomorrow night. The staff are all invited to bring a plus one.”
Groaning, Dean pulled himself out from under the car he was working on. It was an old truck that had more rust than machinery. Standing up, he kicked the wrench on the ground over to his workbench. Wiping his hands on his stained jeans, he walked into the office of Bobby’s Repair Shop.
“You’re off to college soon, buddy. I’ll be here, at Bobby’s, watching Sam. Taking care of Dad.” He said this more softly. He knew Cas wasn’t happy Dean never even applied to college with him.
“Probably since we met, but I only figured it out about four years ago,” Cas’s low voice rumbled through Dean’s body from their connection point.
picking up a few extra shifts to cover his classes. Sam is smart, Dean. He knows what college will cost him. I’ve been helping him out with studying lately, he stops by the library sometimes and I gave him some study guides. He’s well on his way to getting excellent scholarships,” Cas’s lips twitched upward, and Dean felt his heart swell with joy at knowing that Cas cared for Sam too. Maybe even almost as much as he did.
, a partner. He had watched the neighborhood ‘good Christian boy’ turn into the man he wanted to spend the rest of his life with. They were friends for all of middle school and high school, Dean being there for him when Castiel told him that he needed to escape his parent’s cult-like church. Dean was there when Cas came out as gay and was scared that his parents would somehow be able to tell. Dean was there when no one in their high school would talk to him because he was a Shurley and the Shurley kids were weird.
that was Castiel’s tongue, and then his hands were in his hair and –
“Sorry, uh, I just remembered I had to drop a lunch off for Cas,” he lied, grabbing his keys.
“Your church…it was so bad. But here you are, still being a faithful person who believes in grace or God or goodness. I don’t understand. How can you go through all of that and still want anything to do with faith?” he asked.
“Yeah, he, uh, sorta absorbed Chuck’s powers while he was beating Sammy’n I up.”
“Having a bad day, Cas,” Dean said, not knowing how else to start the conversation. He had to start with his dad and explain what he had been dealing with for his entire life.
“Hey, hey, Cas. Here,” Dean moved over to Cas and helped him maneuver back into a sitting position. Cas looked at Dean’s face for the first time since he woke up. Beautiful. But above that, Dean looked sincere, and he looked scared. Dean didn’t scare easily. Not with the life he lived. They stared. This was good. This was normal. Starting was normal for them. Slowly, Dean inched his hand to cover one of Castiel’s.
“I’m in love,” Dean managed. His jaw was clenched so tightly that he was sure he’d need a visit to the dentist after this. Bobby frowned and leaned back in his seat. Dean could practically see Bobby’s brain putting pieces together. His stomach was turning in circles.
It was three am, and Dean was only slightly pissed at whoever had called his phone. He rolled over, reaching blindly for the damn thing. The anger turned to fear as he saw the name
. Dean had been the father that John never was. He only wanted to give Sam the best teenage years he could. Because Dean never got those. His teen years were spent working, drinking shitty beer, trying to make sure no one was harassing his best friend for being gay, and avoiding abuse from his father. So, when Sam turned eighteen, he wanted to give him something that would mean something. The only gift that Dean got in his entire life from his father was the Impala.
“Never said move around, I just think you would do good with a job in something you take interest in. You’re good with cars, of course. But…Dean, I can’t keep the shop open forever. You know that.”
Castiel’s mouth was hanging slightly open and his eyes were still as wide as Dean thought they could get. He blinked a few times, and frankly, he kind of looked like a fish.
“My faith was never in the reciting of prayers or in the worship of a God who wanted to smite me for being gay,” Cas chuckled, “My faith was in us.”
“Hi! My name’s – Dean?” he cut off. Dean looked up to be face to face with a friend from high school, Garth.
for fucks sake. I take you to my parent’s house for Christmas. Did you seriously think all our friends would joke this much if there wasn’t some truth to it?” Dean cried out, pulling his hand out of Cas’s grip. “I’m sorry. I thought you knew. That’s why I didn’t want to be your fake date.”
And thirty-two-year-old Dean remembered all the words his father had yelled at him when said pin was found.
“Dean, I – I need you to pick me up. I dropped out. I…Dean…” Cas’s voice was hushed as if he was trying not to wake someone. His roommate, probably, Dean realized.
or whatever you want to call it. You’re the goodness in the world. You’re
“No!” Dean cut in, pushing Cas to face him. They were
Castiel was reminded of his humanity very suddenly, as his heart panged with an emotion he hadn’t even thought about since he returned, and his stomach lurched. He had told Dean he loved him. He had thought that this was either the Empty toying with him – it wouldn’t be the first time – or Dean just babying him back to health. But…sweetheart. Dean called him sweetheart, and his nose was buried in Castiel’s hair.
“There’s one more thing I never told you about my dad.” Castiel moved closer and forced Dean to face him. He reached for Castiel’s hands this time. He needed this. He needed to tell Cas everything.
“Dean, I
“Sir? Are you and Castiel related? We need to know to let you into the room to see him while he is unconscious.”
“I don’t need faith, Cas,” he bit out, the anger coming to the surface and leaking out through his teeth. He couldn’t keep it in. Castiel had a shitty life too, but somehow, he landed topside. Cas had a degree, a stable job that wouldn’t fire him when his back got too sore, and plenty of offers for sex or dating or whatever he wanted.
” that Dean would never understand despite having read both several times. What he was doing hanging around with a mechanic was beyond him.
“You guys act more like a couple than Jess and me,” he pointed out. Dean lowered the spatula.
“Cas, sweetheart. I love you. But first time with you I want you to be in your prime,” he grinned cheekily, still sitting on Castiel’s lap. Cas slid his hands up Dean’s thighs slowly, landing them on his hips.
“What?” he grunted out, looking back up at Dean. It was only when he caught a look at Dean’s worried face that he set down his pencil and stood, moving to where Dean had frozen by the service counter. “Dean, what is with you today?”
Dean didn’t know what to expect in the morning. He really didn’t. His bed was empty, and he half expected to find out the whole thing was a dream. Only he wasn’t wearing anything, and there was the sound of movement in the kitchen. Did Cas regret it? No, he couldn’t, not after what he had all said.
“Cas? What’s going on why are you dropping out?” Cas would
“Hey, we’re fine now, Cas. Everything…everything is good. Really good. Sammy has Eileen, Charlie and Stevie are okay, Jody, Donna, the girls…and, and you. You’re back. I have you, now,” Dean said, and he did what broke Castiel out of his tired, bleary, confused state. Dean kissed the top of his head. He froze and attempted to roll over, but Dean’s grip was tight.
“Of course, I said I would be. So, what’s the deal? Do you need to mingle or something?”
“You’re not talking about some drug now, are you Cas?” he laughed lightly.
“I might not be able to fuck you yet, Dean,” he said, watching as Dean’s eyes widened, “But you certainly could do something.” Dean nodded. He licked his lips and grinned down at Cas, moving his hand to the waistband of Castiel’s sweatpants.
“Dean,” he let out a soft sigh, smiling. “I’m in love with you.”
Cas grinned back.-
“Why is it such a big deal, Cas? So, Garth thinks we’re dating, why do you care so much? Am I that terrible that you’d rather be alone in a hospital room than have some people think we’re dating? I’m sorry, but I don’t understand why you’re so pissed.”
“Dean, I told you, we can just be roommates. I don’t need to have a boyfriend, I just wanted to make a good impression on our donators and figured being a put together man with a partner would be ideal.”
feelings for his best friend and roommate.
“Cas?” Bobby asked after what felt like hours but was probably twenty seconds, looking at Dean for confirmation. He simply bit his lip and nodded. “Does he know?”
Castiel, who was beautiful. Castiel, who was helping Dean stay sober. Castiel, who Dean would give anything to be able to love, to touch, to kiss. Castiel, who was talking to Garth. Castiel, who was –
“No one thinks that, Dean,” Cas cut in. Dean squeezed his friend’s hands and continued.
“Sure? When?” He asked. Cas seemed too nervous for this to be a casual question.
“How, Cas, how are you here?”
“Oh, um, okay. Eileen, could you grab one of the heated blankets from our room? Dean, can you get some – hey, Dean?” Sam turned, and Cas followed his eyesight. Dean was now sat at the end of Castiel’s bed, and shit, he didn’t look okay either. Eileen returned; eyes wide as she looked at the scene unfolding. She placed the blanket on Cas, plugging it in. Sam stood back up, looking at Dean, now.
“What? Faith? Really, Cas? I’m not that kind of guy,” he huffed. Leave it to Cas to suggest Dean be more faithful.
“I’m…” he couldn’t get any more words out, his throat closed. Dean blinked away unshed tears and Bobby smacked his hands before he could wipe his oil-covered hands all over his eyes.
Castiel opened his mouth, feeling his tongue figure out how to work again. “Is this real? Is this just the Empty torturing me again? Because, Dean, I can’t handle this if it’s not real.” It was the longest he had talked the entire time since he awoke. He felt the arms around him squeeze.
Cas was good with words. Too good with them, Dean often thought. He had to hold himself back from making a face at the mention of Castiel’s church. He remembered being thirteen and Cas telling him how they were made to promise themselves to God. He remembered seeing one of the pastors on a sex offender list when he was fifteen and wanting to break into their horribly beautiful building and destroy the whole thing. He remembered Castiel painfully recalling being abused. He remembered having to sit with Cas during his first Christmas away from his church and family so he wouldn’t have a panic attack. Dean remembered how much Castiel’s church fucked him up.
Sam asked, his eyebrows raised high, "So do you prefer Destiel or casdean?"
"It's fine, everyone's happy, but you know that we were heaven's warriors and now we're heaven's messengers... It seems to be okay? Cause this is kinda my hobby," he gestured to the hat on his head, "you get to choose your job based on interest, some of them prefer paperwork, community governance or something..."
The answer might be, of course, heaven is full of angels!
He should have realized from the moment he entered the room. As someone who had never believed that psychiatrist bullshit, Dean felt justified in refusing to take this ridiculous therapy. Couples counseling, him and Cas? Come on! They had nothing but ten years of... Nothing but friendship, according to his own words,  'I don't have a relationship with Cas, I mean ... No relationship of relationship, yes, he's family, but there's no relationship between him and me, not together, together!'
The human eye is powerfully mesmerizing, as when people see the family as a pair of brothers, a man in a trench coat and a teenager, but in reality, they are two men who have saved the world several times, an angel, and the son of the devil. And now the son of the devil appears at the 'inopportune time' to stop the impending conflict between the angel and the Savior (the former owner of the sword of Michael, the seal of Cain, the former demon and possibly the only person in the universe who is arguing with the angel).
His voice slurred, "Mmmm ....... Thought about it..."
"What?"
"Hi... Dean... Good to see you, again... Actually, it's Samandriel, but whatever. Here's the pizza for you."
I want a nougat.
"Can you imagine this day, you and me, in the afternoon, in bed behind the tavern?"
"When?"
Sam asked, "What if we want to see you?"
"Why?" Cass wondered as he took the bread out of the fridge and set it on the counter, "Is the current residence not good enough, I can help you remodel it if you want."
"Ok, ok," Sam flipped through his tablet, " So Cas, the origin of Dean's name."
Please don't be porn, please don't be porn, please don't be porn, Sam mumbled mentally.
"Ah," said Alfie, who just came to deliver pizzas, "just pretend you've never met me."
"You ordered pizza?" Sam looked up, puzzled, at the door, "Why did you order pizza?"
"Thanks, I will commend you in front of your boss." Dean said.
"Seriously? I still think it's just stupid."
Sam told me his brother was not good at expressing his feelings, "I've only heard him say 'I love you' twice, and one was to our mom. I know what's going on, we've lost a lot of people along the way, but he would do anything to try to get Cas back."
-------
Sam didn't know what to say, "Maybe, but do you have any evidence?" He asked.
In Cass's POV, Dean had beautiful eyes that mapped a hazel-green lake bottom outside his soul that dazzled like bright fire.
"Hey-" Dean protested, " Think on the bright side, this could have happened at your cabin in the woods."
Dean accidentally bumped into the corner of the table on his way out and he turned back around, stumbling in response, "You, you have a good night."
"Sam's working on the new Encyclopedia of Wonderful Creatures with other hunters, and Cass went to the bunker to help." Dean replied, "He said it was 'work before vacation'."
"That's true, but... Hey, I have an interesting thought," Cass stared at him as Dean continued, "what if, instead of 'I love you,' you said 'Let's get laid' to me?
I am the one who awakens it, and I will end it.
Cas nodded, "According to the emptiness, in a way, it wanted Billie dead more than anything else, cause it treated me just a little more leniently. You know, Dean's voice... It's touching, I never had the illusions of having them in the past, it shocked me, delighted me and made me ...very happy, but there are times, like all human relationships, when you display it in front of others, it's a little awkward, and then obviously, I don't want to, or not good at to discuss this with the entities of cosmic."
Cas looked at him, "Actually, I know."
"Sounds pretty good."
"Oh, then how do you explain you yelling 'Cas! No-' in the middle of the night. Dude, I  thought Cas was in danger, or you were in danger, you were like, like a bear growling. " Sam said.
One circle, two circles... Somewhat dizzy.
"Uh ...... on 'The Last Night of Earth'?" He eyed Cas.
"Good job," Dean replied cooperatively, "How's work in heaven?"
--Sam Dude, don't look at me like that-Winchester
Rowena, or perhaps Crowley must feel impressed, Dean thought so, as well as, yes, yes, yes, for the matter of that, still not letting him say "I killed Hitler"?
Dean says, "Oh look, here's my hard-working husband, having a good day honey."
"I remember every word he said, every single word, it was like they were carved in my brain," Dean continued, "I was afraid to even walk into that room, I was even afraid of that hallway, because every time I see it, it's remind me how I felt that day when I walked out of the bunker with nothing left behind, and it was terrible."
"That's your strategy, money?"Sam's eyebrows raised high.
"Yes, I am." Sounds like a reasonable answer.
Sam can finally talk about the not-so-great past without scruples, and he says aloud while drunk: "I've - been to hell, many times - I, and the king of hell’s relationship - can be good, we are, good, good friends -"
"Sam, Dean, Cass, I think I've found a case! Oh! Did I show up at the... . inopportune time?"
"Hey, don't show me that face you had ten years ago."
He wiped his hands on the apron around his waist as Cass began working on the lettuce.
Oh! Dean got me a huge LCD TV and a Netflix membership with the family package!
"Travel?"
Sam said somewhat breathlessly, "Mentioned it, and mentioned it, and we built a gallery with you, Cass, and all the people we lost along the way, family. You're all being remembered."
Cas later told me, "I heard Dean's voice, but I had no idea I'd ever regain consciousness. The Void, turning into Meg’s form, sat on that chair and said, 'You, and your boyfriend, just won't sleep peacefully, do you?'" He lowered his head as he spoke and laughed out softly, "Prayers, they're everywhere, it's probably the blast you had earlier that increased its carrying capacity a bit before it 'threw me into the deepest depths of the emptiness."
I should have expected Dean to come into the kitchen, he'd been practically inseparable from Cas lately. He took three beers, opened them, and slid them down the table to Cas. Dean sat over, next to Cas, across from me. And said to me before I opened my mouth to voice a question, "No," he pointed to the bottles, "not until you look like you're turning twenty-one, huh, maybe a few more years."
"That's your concern, seriously?" Dean looked impatient.
"Hey--" Dean was reading the label on the man's chest, "A... Alfie!"
Dean reached out, he wrapped his arms around Castiel's shoulders and drew them closer to himself. The palms of his hands are a little chilly, the signs of having sweated, or maybe they're both sweating profusely now.
"Travel."
Thus it is, the creature summoned from nothingness will one day return here falling into slumber, and I have woven beautiful dreams for them, over and over again, recalling their most glorious, proudest moments.
That answer didn't sit well with Dean, so Sam added, ''As well as dude, you do talk too sick, 'angel'?"
"You know, for people, they don't give up on a relationship very easily, especially if you've been through twelve years, and that' why you're here, right?"
--Until recently.
Sam will sometimes gather there with hunters they knew before, Dean will also join, but he also has his own tavern, a special mechanic's room for Impala, and a cabin by the lake, it is behind the tavern, less than a kilometer from the bunker. Whenever the bunker became "no longer habitable," he would come here - like now, when his brother was probably catching up with Bobby and a bunch of other hunters they knew, or maybe didn't know.
"And all three of them are in heaven now?"
"I never knew you had such scruples..." Dean replied, standing up so quickly he didn't even have time to reach for his burger, "Tell you what, I'll go pack, and we'll leave tomorrow! Just the two of us, Cass..." He paused, "You're not just my beloved, you're my family, you were, you are, and you always will be."
Hi, I'm Jack...you probably already know that.
Dean fell silent.
Dean thought so.
"Can't help it, Bobby can't stand one day without this place."
-------
Sam said afterward.
"No, it won't." Cass refused categorically, "You were a demon at that time."
I am still me, but what am I, and what is my mission?
Bobby took a sip of his beer, "Angel, a Winchester, depending on how you interpret it."
But before I do that, there's one last thing I can do.
Dean nodded out of habit, but immediately, he rounded the corner from this 'what you're saying seems to make sense' and clarified, "No, even if you say so, it's still a big deal!"
I didn't know then, and because there was so much unknown at the time. I say the answer is in everyone’s heart, my heart tells me what I really want to do, and Dean's heart is firm that the man he thinks of will come back to him again.
That's when the Savior says, "Well done, kid, time to get to work."
"Wow. That was like watching an all-new episode of Desperate Housewives."
Oh - I shouldn't have eavesdropped on their prayers!
"Mr. Bill Harrison, who drowned in 1982, refused to share heaven with his wife, but mainly because of him, his wife, and his wife's lover."
"Isn't he." Dean laughed.
Dean was in the bunker's kitchen, opening a beer for them, "We can go out together, take a ride in the baby, and you show me some about this whole new paradise."
"You do like to fish these days." Sam persuaded him, "Cass may just simply need to work, it is heaven, after all?"
When Pamela walked into his liquor store carrying a bag of lemons, Dean sent her a hug.
Dean handed him a few dollars, or tens of dollars, but everyone knew the scraps of paper would do nothing.
"Oh, is the little feathers here?" Pamela asked.
"So you're saying we have an emotional issue?" Dean asked.
The other Savior says, "What...you still have to do your assignment, Dean, we paid! Dean! Cas?"
"Well, let’s talk, how long have you two been together?"
Dean looks even more impatient, "This whole thing, counseling, marriage therapy, it's stupid! Couples Counseling? Can't believe I actually said that word!"
I had to think of a way to have it both ways.
Back to Castiel, is heaven busy?
"Despite all your, what’s the term," Cas's head lifted a little higher, "disrespects behavior, I'm still millions of years older than you."
"My name is Dean Winchester, this is Castiel, and we're doing a...couple therapy."
"Dean, Dean, I know you cannot forget what happened with E..."
Cass shrugged, "That's right."
"You have a good night." Pamela said to him from behind.
"Oh? Really, tell me about it? "
"Well, I mean I know you want to make up with Cass, for your own good, and more importantly I don't want to see you pass by the kitchen again without saying a word, and Jack has been frightened by the freezing atmosphere once." Sam continued, "and when he gets scared, the kid will fly away and disappears, and nobody wants Jack to suddenly fly away, and you know what's worse, the kid will blame himself because he thinks that you're fighting because of him."
But actually, that's not true... Partially incorrect.
-------
"Your name originated from your grandmother, Deanna Campbell." Cas turned his head toward him.
When I did that, I gave authority back to the order itself, I was no part of any story, and there is no one to write the story anymore.
“How long?” Dean asked.
“Yeah.”
“Castiel,” Dean breathed, putting a hand on the back of the man’s head. Cas blinked, a tear he didn’t know was forming dropped. Dean’s other hand tenderly wiped it off his face.
“What did I do to get you in my life, Dean?” Cas smiled down toward their hands again. He placed his other hand on Dean’s. “Hand sandwich.”
It was bright. He blinked but managed to keep his eyes open. He was correct. He was in the bunker, and staring down at him from above were Dean, Sam, Eileen, and…a dog?
“Yeah, Angel, what’s up?”
“I’m working through some stuff, okay?”
And then Dean remembered he had driven to Castiel. They had walked to the impala. He blinked hard, not even remembering getting into his car. God, he hated his trances. Dean and Cas had all their important conversations in the impala. Despite sharing an apartment, this was his comfort space, and Castiel knew it.
“Well, then even more reason to spend the night with you,” Cas said, pushing himself off the floor and leaving Dean’s bedroom. He heard the bathroom door shut, creaking as it always did. He was glad his friend left because he knew his face was flushed.
Dean shook himself out of his imagination to greet a customer making their way to the bar. It had been a quiet night, as it usually was on Mondays. Still, there were always the local drunks, a few college kids with nothing better to do, and the occasional person looking for a hookup. Dean blinked as he took in the sight of his best friend sitting across from the bar.
Dean snorted at the last one. At least that one was deserved. He sighed and checked the time. One pm. God, he needed to stop sleeping in so late. He groaned and cleaned himself up.
It does
“I forgot to remove a pride pin from my backpack. I’m cut off. I don’t have a place to be…Dean can I -”
“I’ll drive, go get your shoes.”
at him.
“Cas and I are
“Dean…?”
“You couldn’t have just said you’re my roommate? Or closest friend or the nearest thing to a family member?” Cas was quietly fuming, and Dean felt as if his heart was going to explode out of his chest. The guilt was eating him alive from the inside out, but he couldn’t help but argue back.
“That’s not it. If you were worried about Sam you would be babying him, not leaving him alone. Did you even know he has a girlfriend?” Cas argued back, waving off Ellen as she came to ask why Dean wasn’t working. She took one look at the man’s face and backed off. Dean sighed.
Dean adjusted his position, sliding up to lay next to Castiel, helping the former angel slide back down into a laying position as well. He was wearing a loose shirt and had sometime between sitting down and getting under the covers removed his jeans. Castiel looked as his own body – still reminding himself it was his body now – and saw he was dressed in at least two hoodies and sweat pants. He was still freezing.
“Oh god, Dean.” Cas’s hands squeezed his tighter as he shut his eyes. Cas always shut his eyes when listening to Dean talk about his dad.
Sam was eighteen. His baby brother, practically his
“You’re everything, Cas. You’ve been my everything for so damn long. I need you to know. I’ve spent the last eight years trying to get rid of the guilt in my chest so I could tell you,” he cut off, stopping to take a shaky breath.
“You’re my family too, now, Dean. I will if you’ll let me. I will shed my grace and live as a human. That is my wish," Cas stated, but then he hesitated, taking a few deep breaths and looking at his feet. "But Dean, you must know that I did not mean I love you as a brother.”
“You’re the reason I can’t keep this in anymore.”
“He got out. Jack helped. He’s in heaven now, but I’m sure he’ll visit.”
“Alright, that’s settled. What time? What do I need to do?”
It was if someone had thrown a bucket of water on his head. The shock of hearing those words, words he never thought he would hear, combined with the heat that was crawling out of his chest into his cheeks hit him like a punch. But this time, it didn’t hurt. Cas wouldn’t hurt him.
“He deserves that much, after the childhood he’s had. He deserves to go to college and be a stupid young adult like we were never able to,” Dean said, looking at Cas. He set his mug down and reached to hold Cas’s hand in the middle. “A hand sandwich, if you will,” he joked. Cas let out a small laugh and the corners of his eyes crinkled.
“Oh, maybe because we’re not actually dating, Dean!” Cas bit out, his glare hitting Dean like a slap across the face. A stab in the heart. It hurt more than a punch from John. Dean couldn’t help the tears falling from his eyes. Why did Cas care? Why was he crying? Why did Cas look both angry but also sad? Wait –
“Dean?” he heard from behind him. He sighed and sat down on the steps leading up to their apartment. The concrete was cold, and he was so emotionally exhausted he felt like crying again, this time from sheer tiredness. His heart had been put though so much within the past twenty-four hours. Cas slowly sat down next to him and hugged his own knees.
“I don’t think you’ll end up getting your birthday present today, Sammy,” Dean lowly chucked. Sam frowned in confusion. “I was hoping we could maybe look at getting you a shitty car. To keep on campus with you. I think the medical bills are gonna slash that. I’m sorry.”
thought Dean. Why was he so happy? And nervous earlier? Dean blinked and once again chastised himself for looking into Castiel’s emotions too much.
“The Empty didn’t exactly expect me and a few of the other angels to begin annoying it so much that it couldn’t sleep. Once it began yelling, Jack heard it. He opened a portal to heaven. I am back, Sam. Returned to full power. I am once again an angel. I have fully healed grace. Dean Winchester is saved.”

“Is this…does it have to do with me?”
“I thought we
He loved Cas. He loved that Castiel saw the world as good. He loved his terrible puns and lack of understanding of pop culture. Dean loved the way Cas wore sweaters that were slightly too big for him and steel-toed boots even though he worked in a library
“Okay…go ahead?” Sam said, annoyance dripping in his voice. Shoot. Dean had called him while he was at work. Oops.
“Dean, what’s going on?”
“You’re always busy, Dean.” He looked sad. Dean never wanted to make Cas sad. He managed to do it enough, though.
“Yes. Yes, okay. Okay, God. Yeah, yeah I’ll – I’ll be there.”
It was a normal weeknight for Dean and Cas, they chose to do their grocery shopping, and then go home to watch some Dr. Sexy reruns (Dean’s idea). Cas was nearly recovered, and Sam was doing well in school so far. He was making friends, joining clubs, and having a normal college experience. Dean was so proud of him. He and Cas were good. They spend a lot of time together these days since Dean was less busy ensuring Sam was where he needed to be. He had stopped picking up extra shifts at the bar, but still selling his plasma (“Come on, Cas! It’s easy money!”). Dean even joined Castiel on his outdoor excursions. They were when Cas felt the most connected to grace, it was where Dean felt safe. Maybe, Dean thought, maybe Cas was right. Maybe he did need faith in his life, just not the kind of faith that one would find in the pages of a dictionary or in the backrooms of an old church.
Dean was in love with Castiel. His heart had latched onto the messy-haired nerd with a gummy smile and a terrible caffeine addiction. Cas was the best thing in his life. Every time Dean had a doubt, Cas was there. Whenever he wanted to just hang out or relax, Cas was there. Dean could never want anything or anyone when Cas was around. He’d never want anything but
“Yeah, we. We can get an apartment together. I’ve been saving. I want to get out of here too,” Dean admitted quietly. John’s behavior was getting worse with time. If it weren’t for Sam, Dean would have left ages ago. “I’ve been working on trying to get legal rights to have Sam as my dependent, I can’t leave him here.”
didn’t know. I’m so sorry. You must have thought this entire time I was ignoring you. I had no clue.”
Fuck, he was in love. He was kissing the man he loved. He was with the man he loved. Castiel was kissing him. In this life, now.
Silence followed.
Dean blinked. Seriously? Cas was going to make him say it?
“Deeeeeeeean? Please?” Cas whined from where he sat in the living room. Dean rolled his eyes.

world. Fuck. Fuck, Cas, I love you too.”
“Take a break, Dean.”
“You’ve been off for months. I’ve tried to talk to you, but you always avoid me in the apartment and insist on taking Sam with us when I ask you out to dinner,” Cas explained, crossing his arms and giving Dean a knowing look.
“Don’t, I’m fine. Hey, uh, thanks. I’m gonna go talk to Cas. I’ll see you later,” Dean rushed to hang up, but Sam cut him off again.
“We’re real, sweetheart.”
“I’d like to kiss you.”
“You two finally get your shit together?” Asked Meg sweetly. Before Dean could cut in, Cas smiled brightly and squeezed Dean tighter.
thought Dean miserably.
They held each other’s gaze, and Dean tentatively moved his hand from where he had grabbed Castiel’s shoulder to his hand. Cas’s eyes widened. Dean bit his lip.
“Dean, he loves you too. I know that much. I do too, I’m proud of you. I’m sorry about Dad.”
Dean jerked awake and immediately sat up, not even noticing he wasn’t in his bed at the bunker. He reached for the gun under his mattress, and only then did he realize he was on a sofa in an unfamiliar room. Swallowing hard, he rolled himself off the sofa and slowly got to his feet. Dean blinked rapidly when he realized he wasn’t in pain. Why wasn’t he in pain? He was always in pain. What was happening?
“Cas?” Sam leant down further. From Castiel’s position on the bed (it was a bed, right? It felt like a bed) Sam loomed large over him, Castiel’s eyes still watery and full of cosmic entity made him disfigured.
“You need something more in your life, Dean.”
“Yeah,” Dean nodded, even though Sam couldn’t see it. “He found out my senior year. I moved out. I haven’t told anyone till today,” he murmured, still fidgeting.
“No, Dean, Cas saved you. Again. He always does,” Sam answered, putting down the bags he was carrying into the house. Eileen stepped in, smiling, and closed the door behind her. “You’ve been out for a few days, but you should be fully healed.”
“I’m into guys,” Dean blurted out, way too fast and loud for his liking. He couldn’t help it; his anxiety was starting to show. He pulled into a store parking lot and stopped his car so he could catch his breath.
know, and Cas wouldn’t even say anything to him. He pulled into their garage and got out, shutting his door with more force than necessary.
“I never told him,” Dean frowned.
“Well it will be doing nothing when I’m not around to spend time with,” he elbowed the other boy and grinned, only to be met with a  solemn face and eyes that were always too blue, both in color and in their emotional state.
It was Saturday, which was movie night. Dean was humming a tune to himself as he prepped the popcorn and placed an order for two large meat-lovers pizzas on his phone. Movie night, no matter how emotionally painful later, was Dean’s favorite night. Just him and Cas on the sofa together, eating pizza and drinking beer, and usually Cas fell asleep on his shoulder. For a few hours, Dean could pretend that Cas was
He ended up in the Impala, driving down the road back to their apartment, silently. He wouldn’t look at Cas the entire time. Dean really thought that he knew. Now he
Dean fumbled with his phone for a minute as he continued to drive. He didn’t know what was going on with him today, but his walls were breaking around him, and he had to let people know. He managed to press
“Bullshit. You know you don’t have to wait for me to move out to start sharing a room. I’m literally an adult, I can handle - ”
“Novak, Dean’s here.” Dean didn’t know how she knew his name. Sure, he had seen this girl here a few times, but he didn’t know her name. Clarissa? Chrissy? Claire? Didn’t matter, because Castiel emerged from the backroom with a curious smile on his face.
“Yeah. Cas, I’m sorry.”
“Kinda like us, right?” Cas murmured next to him. Dean coughed and attempted to swallow his pizza. He took a loot at Cas’s face. No joking expression to be found. He picked up his beer and chugged a few mouthfuls.
He had said to Dean one night soon after they moved in together.
The familiar jingle of bells alerted everyone inside to Dean’s presence. Great. It was mostly people he knew from town, and a few familiar faces he had seen in pictures on Cas’s phone. Speak of the devil, Castiel emerged from behind the front desk, smiling, although it was rather strained.
Thirty-two-year-old Dean knew. He knew he was fucked up. He knew how much emotional damage his father gave him. His self-worth was dangerously low, he drank too much, and he knew he was going to snap one day – probably today - and kiss Cas. He knew he would give in eventually. It was always Castiel. Cas was the only one who had listened. He listened as Dean broke over the years and told him what had occurred up until the day his dad died. But Dean never mentioned his bisexuality or his father’s hatred for that part of him.
“Alright, so I’m stressed. Sammy’s finally going to college. I’m going to miss the kid. Can’t I be stressed about this? I’m practically his dad.”
“Sam. Dean is okay. I healed him,” Castiel stopped to roll his eyes exasperatedly, “Again. He will need to rest; his soul was already on its way to heaven. Jack told me that he didn’t want to intervene, but to be fair, he never said
“Mornin, sunshine. How do you feel?” Dean asked. Cas sighed and dropped his head back toward Dean to give him better access. He felt Dean’s breath on his neck. Castiel’s heart was still running wildly.
sound good. The second Cas had gone back into his office Dean scrambled to his feet and stomped down the hall to his bedroom and shut the door. He huffed out a sigh. He grabbed his phone out of his pocket. Who to complain about Cas to today? He scrolled through his text conversations. Charlie would do for today. Even though she was constantly telling Dean that Cas liked him back, she was the most understanding of his situation. Dean had been there for her during her Gilda obsession in high school, after all. Dean sat down on the edge of his bed and typed out a quick message.
es that he got that day. It was Castiel who had thanked everyone and kept his hand wrapped around Dean’s waist the entire time for support. Dean had numbly left the funeral, Cas following him quietly. After they got in the Impala, Dean let out a sob, and Cas, thinking it was simply mourning, attempted to speak of his father lovingly, even though he had never met the man.
“Dean you don’t mean this,” he said, desperately. He could not have Dean trying to repay a favor by saying he loved Cas. He could not handle this. Cas wormed him way out of Dean’s grasp and almost off the bed. He was almost impressed with his ability to stand up so quickly.
“When – when I died?” he asked, hesitancy lacing his voice.
“Dean, I – “
“Hi, is this Dean Winchester?” a woman asked. Dean frowned. He didn’t remember giving his number to any women at the bar lately. He swallowed roughly.
The sound of a flutter of wings, one that Dean had heard dozens of times hit his ears. His heart practically flew. Sam and Eileen continued to put their groceries away, leaving Cas and Dean to be.
They barely even managed to get back to their apartment, throwing off their jackets in the car already, and then Cas had Dean against a wall and was against his body. Dean let out a sigh, a gentle sound of
Dean knew Cas was in love with him. Dean knew that he was the reason they weren’t dating. Dean knew that Cas probably knew he was in love with him too. Cas had a way of knowing things no one spoke into existence.
“My mother found out.”
Dean whined to Castiel. They were sitting in Dean’s bedroom, the silence of the small house overwhelming. Sam was still at an afterschool event, and John…Dean didn’t know where John was most afternoons. They went to Dean’s after school most days, usually to play a video game (Dean’s idea) or study (Cas’s idea). Friends and neighbors since the age of ten, it was surprising to Dean that Cas still stuck by him. He was brash, stupid, and undeniably too loud. Cas was smart, careful, and too kind for his own good.
“Castiel is okay. He is stable. He was involved in an accident this morning and is currently being monitored for any internal bleeding. Could you come down to the health cen - ”
“Right! Right, yeah. Dating. Castiel and I.” Dean’s ears were practically ringing with the emotions swirling around his head. Lying to a random nurse was one thing, but Dean felt bad lying to Garth. He managed a tight smile. “Sam, let’s let Garth here work alone, how do you feel about a coffee?”
“Great! Where’s Cas?”
“Dean! How are you?” Charlie smiled brightly at him. Dean tried to smile as brightly as he could.
for the first time.
“Alright, cool, great. Time for me to learn sign language,” huffed Dean, feeling excluded.
As Castiel spoke, Dean felt anger bubble in his chest. He didn’t need faith or grace or any of that shit. Faith was what broke Castiel in the first place. Love for others was what broke Dean. He was served a shitty slice of life, a dead mom, an abusive dad, and only himself to blame for his lack of love.
“I didn’t.” Cas’s face was stoic, frozen in his own awe.
“Hey! Uh, Garth! How are you? Last time I saw you this guy was in bed. The hospital bed, I mean. Um. Yeah. What’s up?” he plastered a fake smile on his face as he talked to Garth. Cas stayed silent the entire time. Dean said a literal prayer in his head that Garth hadn’t mentioned the whole dating thing. Maybe Cas was just being his socially awkward self. But when Garth left them, Cas stayed silent. They went to the check out in quiet, but inside Dean was a mess of noise. His heart was beating loud and quick, he felt all his nerves as if they were on fire, and his thoughts were racing. They got to the Impala and loaded the groceries into the trunk. It wasn’t until they were both in the front seat that Dean looked at Cas. His face was blank.
“You’re a good brother, Dean, your mom would be proud.”
Cas was the only one who knew Dean had lasting trauma. It was only after John died that he told him. Cas came to the funeral with him. Sam brought his girlfriend at the time, Jess. Dean was so zoned out that he couldn’t even accept the many, many
Dean dropped the spatula. “Why would you think that?” he asked, more defensive than needed, “Just because Cas is gay doesn’t mean he’s dating me. I…Sam I’m not - ”
rerun to another nature documentary. This one was about lizards. He let out a soft chuckle. Only Cas. A silence fell between them. The apartment was quiet since Sam had moved out. No coming and going of random teenagers, no flurry of movement every morning when Sam woke up late. It was odd. Dean had driven him down to the university alone, as Cas was still in the early stages of recovering and said he wouldn’t be much help.
Dean thought,
“Dean, I assumed you were just tired of everyone joking that we’re together, which is why you reacted the way you did last night,” Cas said, then his eyes turned almost frantic. “What feelings, Dean?”
“Yeah, yeah. Um, Cas – Castiel – is my…boyfriend,” he lied, hoping that would be enough to get him into the room.
“Anyone? Well, I mean Cas knew,” Sam chuckled lightly.
“But, I mean…I assumed you were telling me you’ve been dating him,” Sam said. Dean could hear the confusion in his voice. Damn, did everyone know he was in love with Cas? Was he just walking around that obvious?
“I was upset that…that it wasn’t real,” Cas whispered, breaking eye contact and looking at where Dean had a grip on his hand. “Dean, you must know. I mean, we’ve lived together for almost four years, we practically raised Sam like a kid, I…Dean you…you were what I had faith in, this entire time. You were my home. You are, I mean.”
“Helluho?” he said through the egg as Sam pretended to gag.
“What? Cas, I know you and Dean were having a tough time before this, but he wants to see you, I promise.” Castiel sighed as if he knew something Sam didn’t, but touched Dean and Sam’s hands, and they all were moved to the bunker.
“C’mere, Cas.” Dean whispered, throwing one of his arms around Cas’s freezing shoulders. Dean slid them together, pressing Castiel’s back against his chest, intertwining his bare legs with the cold man’s.
“Oh, Dean. You don’t need to pretend in front of me, darling. Castiel has already told me everything. Just the guests.”
“I happen to think they’re sweet,” Cas answered, coming up from behind Dean and selecting play on the menu.
“Great, we’ll be here whenever you can get here.” With that, Tammy hung up the phone.
Oh, shit. Had Cas found someone else to be his fake-date? Or worse, were Meg and Cas a genuine thing? Cas turned back to him, now.
thing I have any faith in. You’re the closest to family I have, I just…I panicked, I – I. Maybe it was wishful thinking.”
“Hey, Cas, buddy, you okay? Let’s get you sat up,” Sam said, he and Eileen working to move their hands under his back and propped him against some pillows. Dean was sitting back, jaw set and eyes weary.
“Uh, yeah.”
“A romcom? Seriously, dude?” Dean asked, incredulously. He squinted at the screen. It was a Christmas themed one too.
Dean let out a small laugh, more of a sigh than anything. “Cas, buddy, everyone knows. I make you dinner every night. All the movie nights. I call you
“I need to tell you something I should have long ago.”
Sam pulled Cas into a very strong hug. “We’re done. Cas, we’re not hunting anymore. I don’t care if you can heal us. We’re done.”
He tried to open his mouth. A weak cough emitted from his lungs. He needed to warm up. His vessel – or his body ¬now was in bad shape.
“Don’t mention it.”
Castiel was in his prime by the next night.
“Dean? Would you be able to do me a favor?” Cas called out from his office. Dean was laying on the living room floor, recovering from a long day under cars. He rolled onto his stomach and whipped out his phone.
“Hey, sweetie, how you doing? Better than this morning?” Meg asked, and Dean tried and failed to contain his sigh.
“Meg, this is Dean. Dean’s my - ”
“I love you, Cas,” he choked out.
It was almost four am, he clicked his phone off as he didn’t expect a response for a few hours. Sam drove back to the barn. As he walked in, however, there was a feeling in the air he could sense was…different.
“It’s fine, Cas, I was out of line, I know you just needed a fake boyfriend and I made the most sense, you didn’t mean to…you know, mock my feelings,” Dean swallowed, wishing that Cas would drop his hand.
“Cas…Cas died. Sam – what?” Dean bit out, still slightly bleary and now extremely confused. His heart beat in his chest at the mention of the angel.
“You were friends with him, though?”
“He and I had a lot in common, used to. The John that you knew wasn’t the John I knew. And Cas is good for you. You tell him,” Bobby gave him a look, and retreated behind his desk. Dean nodded, still trying to comprehend what had just happened. He had told Bobby he was in love with another man. And Bobby didn’t even flinch. It was as if he knew already. He stood up and walked to the door, turning to wave at Bobby once more.
“What, Cas? I can move out, if you want me to. Or we can just never say anything again.”
The sound of laughter filled the air. Tomorrow they would call their friends and family, go visit Jody and Donna, Claire and Kaia, Charlie and Stevie, and the rest.
“Do you want me to call out for the rest of the day? I think we could stand to go home. Here, let me get you tissues,” Cas reached for the box of tissues in the back, but Dean stopped him, putting a hand on his cheek.
“Don’t.”
teary-eyed. A thudding in Dean’s chest restarted. “Why…Cas, what aren’t you telling me?”
“What, Dean?” Cas snapped.
“Sounds good.”
“I don’t understand why you refuse to have fun, man. Come on, you’re free now. We graduate next month, and you’ve never done
“Um. It’s about Dad. He, y’know. Did some stuff. Said some stuff. To me.”
liked
“Yeah, we didn’t pretend to be a couple, though. Our family knows we’re friends,” he frowned at Cas. Did he have to be that cruel as to point the similarities.
“Faith.”
It hurt to love Cas. It hurt to listen to him talk about the man who gave him his number at work. It hurt to watch him exist in his life without being
“I’d be happy to share,” smiled Eileen, wrapping an arm around Sam’s waist. She signed something quickly, something to make Sam’s entire head go red, and Cas to let out a cough.
soft. He felt the heat coming from Cas’s face on his hands, and then
“Alright…take a seat, son, you look like you might faint,” Bobby said, pulling out two chairs from the counter and steering Dean into one, taking the other for himself. Dean was still blinking and biting his lip periodically. He wasn’t like this normally, Bobby knew that. “Dean, what’s going on?” he asked, a little softer. Dean was his son by all means, especially after John had passed.
“Dean! What do I owe the pleasure?” he stopped when he caught a look of Dean’s face. “What’s wrong? Claire, cover for me, will you?” he excused himself and smiled at Claire. Cas was in his typical work outfit, a pair of jeans, a sweater, and a truly terrible tweed jacket that Dean had bought him a few years ago for his birthday. Dean’s heart clenched painfully with a bit of longing. He was having a weird day. He didn’t need to bring Cas his lunch, he just needed to see him, and finally, tell him some things he should have years ago.
“Good morning, Dean,” he mumbled. Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel. Castiel, his boyfriend. His lover. His partner. He would never hear the end of this from Sam or any of their friends, but somehow, he was okay with that. As long as he had Castiel in his arms it would be okay.
Dean knew. He wasn’t as full of hot air as everyone seemed to think he was. Thirty-two-year-old Dean knew he had issues. Deny it outwardly he might, but he knew himself. He spent most of his day underneath cars working with only his thoughts and classic rock hits - that he kept on the radio for the specific purpose of fighting off annoying thoughts - for company. They were annoying thoughts about himself for the most part, though they often featured others. He had an annoying voice in his head constantly telling him how shit he was, and the irritating reminders of his young life were a barrier to moving forward.
“Dean…I thought those were…jokes. Oh my god. Dean, are you…do you…?” Cas was barely able to form a sentence. Dean looked back at his friend. What the hell? Did Cas
They hit Dean’s bed with a soft exhale shared between lips. Cas was tugging off his blue sweater and Dean started on getting his t-shirt over his head. The skin on skin contact was glorious, Dean had never felt anything like it. Having Cas against him, on top of him, shoving his tongue in his mouth and kissing his neck and –
“Glad you’re feeling okay,” Sam said, arms crossed and a smile on his face. Dean flushed but let go of the angel and faced his brother.
Dean blinked, looked at Cas’s face for an explanation. There was nothing but a small smile. Was this…did Cas…? His heart was starting to pick up in pace and his hands started to sweat.
“Yeah, Cas, I love you. You know that,” Dean huffed, watching Cas’s face carefully. His hand felt a squeeze, and he looked down to where Cas was gripping his hand like a lifeline. Glancing back up, he took in the shocked look on his friend’s face.
“We defeated Chuck. He’s human now. Jack’s God…”
“I’m one-hundred percent serious. You think I would leave my own fundraiser if this weren’t so important? Dean, I love you too,” Cas said, wrapping an arm around Dean again. Dean exhaled. There was no way this was happening. Absolutely no way. But Cas’s arm around his was tight, and the look Cas was giving him was full of joy. Cas was smiling like he did the first time Dean made him homemade burgers, when Dean let him pick the movie, or the way that he did only when he saw a honeybee on a flower. Castiel loved him. Why? How did he not notice?
“Sure, let me find – oh! Meg, good to see you!” Castiel suddenly burst out, leaning toward the brunette woman who had seemingly come out of nowhere. Dean tried to bite back his wave of jealousy.
he thought. Sure enough, Cas returned to Dean’s room, and Dean’s eyes couldn’t help but flicker to the marks he had left on his chest. Cas was holding two mugs, one black coffee and one chai latte. Dean felt his mouth smile on its own accord. Cas set them down on the headboard before climbing back on top of Dean, dropping his head into the nook of his neck.
“Never had a worse day,” his voice cracked slightly. “That’s when I got burned. He told me to move out the second I could. He said I had never disappointed him more. Said worse things that I can’t say. But I’ve never spoken about it. I knew I liked men. I knew, Cas. Everyone thinks I don’t know anything. Everyone thinks I’m just poor widower John Winchester’s good, stupid, straight son - ”
Dean shifted. He removed his hand from Cas’s hair (Cas did not make a disapproving sound at that.) and placed it on Cas’s bicep.
Now Sam was holding him together. Waiting in a tiny chair next to his unconscious friend was unbearable. Sam tried and failed to keep up a conversation, but eventually left the room silent save for the beeping coming from Cas’s monitor.
“Let’s go.” He marched off, not willing to look at Cas’s disgusted face. He managed to get back into the main party, where he saw Meg and Charlie whispering to each other. He swallowed. The last thing he needed were those two being friends.
“Why not? Everyone assumes we’re dating anyway. All you’d have to do is say we’re dating and put an arm around me. Unless that idea makes you uncomfortable…” Cas trailed off, looking unsure. Dean felt like slapping him with a slice of pizza. Cas had laughed at Charlie and Jo’s teasing remarks, accepted the smirks that Sam and Eileen gave them at holidays, and even tolerated Gabriel’s gross sexual jokes about the two of them, but he had never made fun of Dean himself. This was crossing a line. Dean bit back the urge to yell at Cas, or worse, cry.
“Cas, please, you need to sleep. Just – just let me hold you. I’ve got you,” the hunter said, hooking his chin onto Castiel’s shoulder. “We can talk, but…can we just sleep first? I…I haven’t been sleeping. You were gone for weeks, Cas, I…I couldn’t sleep.”
For the second time within minutes, Dean choked on his own spit.
Dean watched as Castiel’s eyes flickered across Dean’s face.
“What?” Dean shook his head, trying to make sense of what Cas was saying. His eyes were watering and his mouth was half-open. Cas’s lips were trembling and there were already tears threatening to spill from his blue eyes.
before his brother could get another word in. Taking another deep breath to steady himself – what felt like the millionth deep breath of the day – Dean started the impala and headed towards the library. A bell jingled as Dean entered the library Cas worked at. He rounded the corner and stopped at the circulation desk. A bored-looking blonde teen girl glanced up, then rolled back on her chair to the door leading back to the employee lounge. Knocking once, she opened the door.
“He’s somewhere, I don’t know,” Dean lied. He was saved by the man himself coming up behind him and wrapping an arm around his waist. Oh fuck. What the hell. What was Cas doing? What did he think he was playing at? Why did he insist on hurting him so much?
had implications that Dean constantly had to tell himself were not happening with Cas.
“Where’s Cas?” he asked. Castiel was usually back from his run by now. He shrugged, although he also wondered where the man was. “Are you two dating?”
“Why are you so good?” Dean asked gruffly, watching as Cas turned his head to make eye contact. Cas frowned slightly, tilting his head. The fondness was back. He loved Cas.
He waited. Checked the clock. It was after six, Charlie should have already left her comic shop for the day. He tapped his foot on the floor and bit his lip. Damn Cas.
“Oh,” Dean nodded, flushed. “Makes sense. Sorry, I just didn’t know for sure.” This was going terribly.
The Winchester brothers ate their eggs in silence. Dean had almost forgotten that Cas was missing when he got a call from a number he didn’t recognize. It was in their area code, so he took another bite of eggs and pulled it up to his ear.
“You don’t have to apologize, Dean. I know how you feel for me –“
He glanced back at the message from the unknown number. He sent back a middle finger emoji.
“Need to make sure Sam gets to go to college, I know,” Cas said, reaching across the table and pulling one of Dean’s hands close to him, and putting his own hand over it. Dean’s heart fluttered.
The kids were okay – traumatized – but physically okay. Sam tried his best to put on a cheerful and brave face for the kids, but he was sure they knew something was amiss. The drive to the sheriff’s office was silent. Explaining that he had seen them in the woods while driving, Sam managed to avoid the lengthy questioning he usually got after returning victims to their families. Dread filled him as he realized he now had to return to the barn to not only bury the vampire remains, but also retrieve Dean’s body and begin preparing for a funeral. Sam pulled out his phone, sending a text out to Eileen. He had managed to salvage his relationship with her in the weeks that followed Chuck’s demise. They had begun texting and even meeting up for drinks recently.
“Yeah, well that’s boring, it’s your eighteenth, and you’re going to just waste it doing nothing.”
“Uh, yeah, buddy, you did! I – you can’t expect me to do that!” Dean bit out, anger showing. Cas frowned.
“No, no don’t call out. I’m going to talk to Cas. I talked to Bobby right before calling you. Sam, Dad and I argued a lot, and he did some things, but I don’t know if you knew why I moved out at nineteen. I regret that you know. Moving out and leaving you there.”
A sudden intake of breath, a small hum, and the soft sounds of lips parting and connecting filled Castiel’s ears. He didn’t know how long they kissed. Long enough for the beautiful sounds Dean was making to increase in volume, for Castiel to feel Dean adjusting so he was practically on top of him, and long enough for the kissed to become open mouth, Cas shaking as he slipped his tongue into Dean’s mouth. It wasn’t long after they truly started kissing that Dean pulled back, however.
