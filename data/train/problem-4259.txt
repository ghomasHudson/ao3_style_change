"Says the man who created the Thoughtform because he never said to his angel that he's in love with him for what? Twelve years?"
He just can't. He needed... "Jack" he whispered to the darkness of the parking lot "I don't know if you're hearing me, but please bring him back. Please. I know you don't wanna interfere, and that's why I didn't asked before but please, just this once... bring him back, please" He wouldn't, he wasn't Chuck, to keep bringing him back. Cas was gone for good. "Cas... I don't... Cas I miss you, and I'm sorry that I didn't say it back... I..." he stops as he feels a presence behind him, he turns at the same moment hoping to find Cas there but instead there's a woman in white.
Dean was watching in silence…Castiel took upon himself to keep on smiling with the kids… A new dog basket was ready in the hall, where it was supposed to remain… Brand new toys were waiting in a plastic box …
He looked at Castiel jumping on his own horse and ride next to him. This was the moment Dean noticed the children were staring at them.
Castiel observed the kids for a while as they squabbled with each other over the Christmas decorations under the curious eyes of Apache.
« I have… » Castiel painfully raised his hand and exhibited the patient-controlled pump in his left hand.
" No, Sweetie, I’m fine... You fell from your seld once, right ? So, it was my turn today " he gently put her back on her feet.
« Wow Cass, you’re awesome» He started to laugh, winking at his daughter who was delighted to see them share a happy moment together, as if nothing had happened.
He slowly ran his hands against his lover’s thighs and grabbed his hardened dick. He caressed it and, slowly, leaned toward it.
« I don’t care if you borrow my shirts, Dean, but I’d appreciate if you could put them in the laundry basket from time to time, OK ?» he unfolded his arms.
He goes to the back of the classroom near the toy's boxe, takes off his raincoat and puts it on the back of his chair. Karen keeps her eyes on him while she greets her noisy students.
While they were drowning the pancakes under a heavy layer of maple syrup, the children talked about the last Christmas they remembered at Bobby’s and recited their wish list.
Dean watched as the dogs ran away together... He looked at the vast landscape in front of him and smiled. He was a genuine city boy, but on occasions he enjoyed spending time at Bobby’s farm... Like an echo of the teenager he once was.
« So it’ll be two pancakes with whipped cream and two coffees » she said to the waiter with a smile.
Castiel moved aside and blocked the animal. Dean freed the stag in no time. However, the animal panicked and turned around. Dean didn’t step step aside. The frightened deer rushed ahead and torn the canvas. Alerted by the noise, Apache started to bark, frightening the wild animal even more. It rushed towards Dean, knocked him down and stepped on his crotch.
As she saw him staring at his coffee, lost in his thoughts, she smiled, thinking that she wouldn’t have to wait for too long anymore.
« So you see, my Friday sessions aren’t useless after all » he went on, taking the plates and handing them to his daughter.
Dean didn’t say a word, no emotion on his face. He turned to Castiel who had a hard time remaining serious.
"Why is it different? It's because i'm an angel again ? Because Sam is safe ? Because you need me? ", Castiel answers,dryly. Non-judgmental, like an established fact.
« Listen, my little angels, the only times I went there, I wasn’t actually offered a guided tour of the place, OK ? »
« If you had asked me that a week ago, I would have laughed at you or I would have smashed your face, your choice… » he laughed but his expression was nothing but happy « ...But now... » .
Castiel looks up. Several of the students stared at him, petrified by the spectacle. When Castiel meets the chief supervisor's eyes, Benny's words take on their full meaning.
His eyes sparkled as he had been waiting for this moment forever and Dean knew it was problably the case.
« You’re my unintended choice... » he whispered in his ear. « ... and I put the broken pieces together again thanks to you...I’m here, Cass»
« He’s been walking the neighbors’ dogs for a whole week. » Castiel said, his hands squeezing the shoulders of Jewel, standing in front of him. She was lost in admiration at the car.
Jewel had asked Jo who was the lovely blonde with the little boy with a big smile. Jo had given her the answer. Which made Jewel immediately select the picture for her project. It was a picture of Dean and his mom.
It's a promise he made to his father when John decided to get his life back together a few days after the disaster of the last birthday of his eldest.
It was an ordinary attic. One window stained with years of dust, spider webs, dust, boxes and luggage filled with memories from their childhood and adult lives.
He pulls out a chair and sits in front of the angel. He takes his hands and brings them back to him. Castiel doesn't flinch and let's him doing.
“I know that but... I’d just like you to think of yourself sometimes... To go out, meet people... Fall in love...”
« Sure » the woman yielded to the pleading of the little girl who took her hand and dragged her along.
Every night or each time he was trying to get some rest, the same nightmare would sneak in over and over again...
She frowned. She didn’t feel offended ; after all she wasn’t there to find her soul mate. But Dean’s expression was way too serene. She’d never known him like this.
« No need for one. I’m still your father, as far as I know. And I said no. Now, move on, get your stuff or you’re gonna be late for school.»
« Mr Winchester, rest assured that we are doing everything we can to find them ; you need to be aware that we are dealing with dozens of cases like this every week.»
" I’m aware I’m asking you a lot, Son, and I’m sorry. It fell on me with no warning. I’d have preferred to fall in love with a woman. It would have been simpler for everyone. But it was a man " he laughed, perplexed." Besides, it had to be Cass.... "
Castiel was listening and answering their question without complaining. They didn’t even bother to eat anything ... Dean had to drag them to the bathroom while Castiel was walking Apache.
"He doesn't hate you... he doesn't talk much, which makes you two have one thing in common, but he doesn't hate you, Dean," Bobby confirms. "I don't think that fool will ever stop loving you and I wonder why, when i see how little energy you put into trying to save what can be saved," this time is not being able to hide his anger.
" I took the afternoon off… Too many hours on the clock " he explained as he wiped a dirty grease spot on Dean’s nose.
He just whispered “You” with tenderness. That’s all Dean could say, as his hand traveled down his chest, the other still holding the back of the other’s neck.
He sat on a fallen trunk and admired Peanlow Lake in front of him. It was hot, but at least he had found some shadow.
« Splendid ! Nowadays kids seem to be less stupid than yesterday’s adults. Where there’s life, there’s hope. Now, it will perhaps seem weird at first. I don’t know how I would have reacted if my father had started to polish his pal Jeffrey’s tonsils, but anyway…» she took a big bite in her sandwich, facing an alarmed Castiel.
His health prevails over all the rest, I ask you a little patience. (and for that, there'll be a bonus surprise in the end of this story )
He was about to leave the kitchen. He turned around and watched Castiel cleaning the table, a bit overwhelmed by the whole situation.
“You’re welcome... You’ll see... Once you get to know him a little better... He’s an awesome guy... And he seems to the only one who’s not aware of that.” He gave Castiel a knowing wink, and a smile full of affection.
The only moments there seemed to be a shining light on his face was when the children were around, most probably because they were behaving with him as if nothing happened: Chadwick, because he was willingly hiding his feelings, which Dean didn’t like at all; and Jewel because Castiel was back home and in her mind, everything was back to normal.
Castiel put the mold now filled next to the sink and spread the dough on the table. It remained stuck...
They remained silent when watching old indian and cowboys movies, Jewel was fascinated by the scenery and Chadwick by the cowboys ... Dean smiled, children will be children, no matter the time period.
« I’ll be fine... I can manage and besides, it’ll do me good... I need to take my mind off things and breathe some fresh air »
They share the same class this time. Dean gently dismissed the shy young boy who had the misfortune to sit on the bench to the left of Castiel. Castiel looks daggers at him before taking off his trench coat and putting it on his backpack.
Castiel lets his hands slide on his own thighs and ends up plunging his eyes into those of his hunter.
Dean looks at the boots going away. They are soon replaced by two black polished shoes and the edge of a coat that he would recognize between a thousand.
« Go ahead… all he needs now is to see a familiar face » she said as she gently guided him towards the room.
It is the sound of beers clattering together that brings him back to reality. Dean invites him to join him, lifting the pack before putting it on the table.
« The caresses guiding his hand to your hard cock and masturbating you until you lose your mind» Balty went on in a feverish voice, chasing him in the kitchen.
The entrance was a pretence of a Pantheon. So kitschy! But the kids were in awe in front of the gigantic pasteboard in front of them.
Everyone knows, but they all keep quiet. Castiel would like to shout it out, but he tells himself that if no one talks about it openly, it's because no one really wants to know.
Dean observed Castiel who seemed relaxed, at peace with himself, feeling one with his mount… There was a smile on his face. Dean saw his good old Castiel again, the one before the aggression.
« Even if I weren’t, I’d cancel everything else. I’d never miss to see the most stoned Santa of the century. »
Several games were available to be tested, among which a dance mat game ... Jewel wanted to drag Castiel who refused to go there ... Chadwick was discussing with the seller, she came and pull the pants of his father.
He fell asleep at the quiet humming of the television. Jo found him later on, curled up on the couch.
"I've made my choice... I just wanted you to know... I understand if you want me to go ", Castiel answers sadly.
Castiel stepped closer, behind his back and held Dean’s hands tight in his own, their fingers entwined. Dean dropped his knife and closed his eyes. He felt Castiel’s kiss on his neck.
Once again, I apologize for the delays in publication. There are things in life against which we can't do anything: health problems are one of them.
She touched the bruise on her hitching lip… Was he that lost that he couldn’t prevent from hitting her?
He drank up his cup... As long as he was asking himself this kind of questions, it meant he wasn’t ready yet.
« It’s performed very quickly… We could do this with nitrogen but we’d need to get the horses to sleep and Bryan refuses to take that risk, even the operation’s rather safe. Besides, it’s more expensive »
« It’s ok, buddy, don’t be scared... I’m exhausted...I’m just imagining things » he patted the dog to reassure him.
« I don’t give a damn, I don’t like her. She’s giving me nettle rash and I just can’t stand this hoity-toity attitude of hers. »
« And please take off your coats when you come back. You’ll have plenty of time to admire the decorations afterwards…» he disappeared in the kitchen.
« Like what, Dean ? You have lived a very unique love, you were granted two gorgeous kids. He’s always been there. You know what ? I’m sure she knew and she... » she smiled with tenderness but all of a sudden she felt a sharp pain on her lip and tasted the blood in her mouth. She stood there, petrified, rubbed he cheek and saw the panic in Dean’s eyes.
« I don’t wanna hear ONE word !» Dean said in a quiet voice, threatening them with the giant plastic honey pot he was holding.
He sees the man turn toward him and nods. He takes a notebook out of his pocket and scribbles down a few words, rips out the page and hands it to Dean.
That pain down deep inside his soul was burning like hell. He was scared to lose him and it was killing him.
Dean held back a sad smile. As he poured the pasta in a colander, he peeked at the snowman that seemed to taunt him.
Sam noticed how Castiel nervously readjusted his trench coat despite how warm he obviously was if the sweat gathered on his brow was anything to go by.
They stared at each other. Balty was about to tell him the whole truth but somehow he managed to keep it for himself.
An old woman in black whom no one noticed, invisible to the eyes of the common mortal rested her hand on a young man and disappeared.
When the door's closed, Dean lets out his rage. He crushes his fist on the wall before sliding slowly on the floor, unable to hold his grief.
He pulled him towards him, Castiel has made the effort to stand up at the same time and all of a sudden, he ended up against Dean’s chest.
« Happy to see you too » he patted his back and pulled away. « Dean.... Let me introduce you to Bryan » he stepped aside to let his companion enter.
« How do you want me to throw it if you don’t give it back ? » he was ranting against the dog who was biting and pulling hard, shaking Castiel from right to left.
They left their luggage in the lobby. Dean started to take his jacket off when he saw Jo walking to him.
“Nothing... Dammit, I love it when you do that,” Dean said, cupping his cheek. “I’m gonna call Ellen and ask her to look after Sam today.”
Castiel was sitting at the kitchen table. He couldn’t help but noticing similar attitudes between father and son …Same posture, same way of talking… but above all, same stubbornness.
Around 11 a.m., Jo started to worry as she hadn’t seen Dean yet. She gently knocked on the door. As she got no response, she half opened the door.
« I’m all right… Go on doing what you were up to » he said, moving a few steps away, trying to act casual.
« Nothing… We were talking about Balty and Bryan » Castiel promptly explained, looking away from Garth.
“God… Father… Jesus… I don’t know what to call you… I haven’t talked to you in a long time… Since my mother… I only called ever called for you son, Father… The angel that you placed on my path, the angel that showed me what it was like to be loved and to die from sadness… The angel turned human like those creations, yours, for whom he had so much affection, for whom he sacrificed everything… The angel I love… I ask forgiveness for profaning the sacred walls but I had to tell you… I have to believe that through your voice, he can hear mine… Tell him that I always loved him and that I will always love him… Tell him I was stupid man, too proud of his virility, too proud of his small self to admit out loud all the feeling that have always haunted him… I love your son, Father… And even if you send me to Hell for this blasphemy, I’d like to believe that you will tell him my truth… I’m begging you, Father… Tell him… Tell him Dean loves him, loved him and will love him always.”
He looks shocked, but let them in. He doesn't say anything until the moment they get to the living room and sits in an armchair, Sam and Eelin sits in front of him in a couch."Did you find something? About her death." He asks.
Dean was feeling like he was falling apart. It was like a hole had been brutally carved in his chest, and sometimes he just couldn't breathe. He stayed in the car for a while, parked in front of the house of the only friend of the dead teach that he could find. Sam was back in the motel doing his search. He should do his part too. Taking a deep breath he goes talk to the teacher's friend.
"What does... well, yes, Letitia James, she was my brother's best friend. She passed away some weeks ago, that's why I was visiting my brother, I've been visiting him often cause he hasn't been himself every since she died.
"You'd never lose me Cas." The words simple escaped his mouth "You know, I thought so much about the things you said... about me... and that somehow changed me, helped me, not just back than, but tonight"
Claire is face to face with the Thoughtform, who has its hand in her chest. "No! Claire!"Dean shouts.
"I like Eelin" Cas comments while  Dean drives to Jane's nephew's house. "She seems to make Sam happy."
"Yes, I... might or not helped him to inspire it to write" she confesses guilty "but I didn't knew he was you know God"
By the morning, when Dean woke up, he could barely belive in what have happened last night. And until that moment he still couldn't. Cas and him were sitting in an table in one side of the room searching, while Sam and Eelin were in the other side doing the same, Dean couldn't help but look at Cas every second, barely believing he was actually there, sometimes, briefly their eyes crossed and both diverts their eyes at the same time. That was stupid, it was as if he was a teenager boy all over again, staring, diverting eyes, when he thinks about it, has always been this way with Cas, have him be always in love with him? Was he in love with him? When did this happened?
Cas knows what is he talking about. He gets closer to him. "No I wasn't. You're just letting pain and guilt blur your judgment. Dean the thing you need mostly in this world is the one thing you were never able to give to yourself, but you have to. Love. You need learn to love yourself and forgive yourself is the first step to it. So those people lives is on you, how many people's lives is on me? On Sam? We all made mistakes, we all did things that can't be fix and we have to learn how to live with it, how to forgive ourselves."
"So good things do happen Cas" Dean says remembering one of the first thing Cas told him, when they met.
"What's going on with Dean and Cas? Why did Dean lied to him?" Eelin asks by his side in the car, while Sam drives to the house of Andrew.
"Yeah." Sam tries to think about it. Were they connected somehow? "So I guess it wasn't Letitia ghost. Alright, I'll search the lore and the local deaths and you go investigate her?"
"Yes. I... I just... it was too much to process, he was... dying and he... what he said... The Empty would come only when he was happy, completely happy and he thought... he was happy after he said... and I didn't said it back and now he's gone."
"Yeah, John Carter, 42 years old, single, lived alone, was found dead this morning by his sister, poor thing is traumatized, some manic ripped his heart out. The thing is, according to the sister everything was locked."
Before he have the chance to do anything, she set the Thoughtform in fire, the thing simple disappear. They run to her. "Are you okay?"
In the cemetery they dig it out Letitia's body, salt it and burn it. Sam look at Dean for one minute, wondering, what connection did Dean found with this case? Than it became obvious. John and Letitia were best friends, Letitia confess her love for him and die for him, without ever hear it back from him. Was this what happened between Dean and Cas before he died? Sam had always been suspicious of that, but... "Dean, I'm sorry about Cas" Sam says before be able to refrain himself from do so.
"No, Bob. Listen Sam, that favour you asked, I think I got something. Is called a Thoughtform, is created by a human accidentally through guilty.  Any type of guilt. They tend to be aggressive and ripped the heart out of their victims."
"Let's get inside" Dean suggests turning to them, when he feels something in his chest through his back.
Sam smiles at her. It was warm to see she worried about Dean. About her brother in law, too soon for say that? He looks at her, just thinking, feeling, how much he liked her. How much he was happy for have her in his life and how much he wanted that to last.
"Because... I've never felt this way before, never" A tear drops as he realize how true that was, he loved Lisa, he might had loved Cassie, but never got close on how he... how much he loved Cas. "And he'll be gone and I... I don't know what to do."
Everybody breaths relieved. There're some smiles and even laughs among them. Cas and Dean is still looking at each other, Cas is with those eyes that tells Dean that he's wondering about something.
"No more monsters" Cas repeats. "He'll also close the gates of Heaven and Hell. No more demons, no more angels on Earth."
guilty heart, turns back towards the kitchen, grabbing his coffee along the way before dropping on the chair before his computer.
As of this morning, Castiel is anxious; by now, he should be beaming shyly at his laptop's monitor, as he reads today's topic sent by
Dean's hands fumble across the keyboard a second, his mind just as disorientated. He tells himself to calm down, because Jesus Christ, he isn't a hormonal adolescent anymore; it's a damn email. His cursor hovers over the link from
floods the screen, allowing him to log in. The monitor whirs for a moment, and Castiel can feel his heart pounding with so much force against his chest. He is greeted by the typical:
« You know… since… since the aggression… I’ve been feeling this… fear… it’s irrational… But I’m afraid to lose you as I lost Tessa » he turned to look at the fireplace again.
At their very last Christmas together, Tessa was going through the final stage of the sickness and Dean had kept this image only, it seemed he had forgotten all those years together. It had been his wife’s favorite celebration. As well as his kids’.
I can't come to you anymore and I close my eyes, relieved to know that you are suffering in silence, No fear of having your name appear on the screen because you won't call me. I know that.
One person is missing and the place is deserted, Meg had said casually, while sipping her tea. Dean hadn’t reacted to the innuendo.
« I’m completely dehydrated» Dean opened the fridge and took a beer which he offered to Castiel, then he gave one soda to each kid and took another beer for himself.
« You’re gay, remember ? » she said, sinking back into her chair. « Besides my husband, you’re most certainly the most adorable stranger I’ve ever met during my boozehound existence... And I continue to believe your Dean is a complete moron not to see the precious one living next to him »
Dean turned his bottle in his hands, feeling uncomfortable, almost embarrassed but most of all anxious about Castiel possible refusal ... They had never tackled the subject ... Tessa 's death had occurred quite recently yet Dean had thought about it for a long time.
He sat on the trunk which had become their official bench. The sunset tainted the lake surface in shades of orange.
Garth pointed at the rusty branding iron hanging inside the shed, above the fireplace. A « M » in a triangle.
“I told you we’d meet there… What the hell are you doing here?” He shoved him away so he could open the door.
« For Christ’s sake, munchkins...You know what time it is ?... We’re on holidays and I’m dead tired ! »
That night, Castiel was getting ready to go out like almost every last Wednesday of the month. He put on his trench coat and cast a last glance at the mirror, trying in vain to arrange his tousled hair, and smiled... He liked those evenings. He needed them... They were a breath of fresh air.
He went away and reappeared several minutes later. In the meantime, the tree had been properly installed under the children’s amazed eyes.
« If you had been there last Sunday, you’d know I’m right. What hurts me most is that I probably screwed it all. I should have made Dean become aware Lisa isn’t the one for him… I should have told him everything regarding Castiel… I should have told him everything»
Dean leaned forward and rested his head on his hands, his elbows resting on his knees. He was scared. More precisely, this whole situation was scaring the shit out of him. He let out a muffled giggle and nodded as he became aware.
« You’ll have to be a bit lenient… This is a first in our cooking career » he added as he winked to the little girl who was staring at the pie.
« SHIT » Dean shouted, pointing a finger at her. « You… you… you’re pissing me off » he finally said.
Jewel yawned as he walked in the kitchen, holding the empty bowls of popcorn, followed by his son bringing the empty bottles.
« I’m starving…Who wants a hot dog ? » Dean was all smiles. « Don’t answer me all at once ! » he added, a bit dismayed.
There was a scream in the middle of the night ... Castiel rushed out of his tent, with shaggy hair and a wrinkled face. The dog was standing straight in front of the Winchesters tent, growling.
The children showed up at that precise moment. There was a huge smile on their faces and Dean refrained from complaining any further.
Dean was truly impressed by the massive stagecoach wheel hanging from the ceiling transformed into a chandelier.
« I swear » he kissed him again, and this time, Dean returned the kiss.. « Just tell me if you want me to stop » he whispered against his lips.
After a few minutes, Garth pointed at a small shed down the valley. There was a vast empty paddock on the right.
« So… are you done keeping us in the dark or what ?» Dean was getting impatient. « In about an hour, I gotta drive the kids. »
"Shit," as he takes off his shirt under Castiel's still impassive gaze, who is now staring at the hunter's AC/DC T-shirt.
Dean looked at Castiel… and saw a bit of apprehension in his eyes… Castiel let a discreet smile stretch his lips.
« Yeah, sure ! I’m sure you had another argument with Dean, right ? » she went on, looking up to him.
« If I see you again, I’ll bleed you to death... » the voice shouted in an echo. The man’s face came closer to his and spat in his mouth.
She was feeling helpless, as a witness to the heavy silence that was undermining the bond within this ordinary family.
Chadwick climbed on the fence, his face lightened up, bright eyes. Yet he had a knot in his stomach.
« By the way » he went on as he headed for the kitchen, « Jo’s shown me your painting… You do have a gift. That being said, I don’t know much about painting, but I really found this one extraordinary »
Sam turns around to face his father, standing in the kitchen doorway, before dumping him to go to his own room.
He smiles, touched by this angel who hasn't taken his eyes off this manuscript written in an ancient language which he reads as if it were God himself who was the author.
« We’ll set something up… Because it’s not the same around here without you. I… We sure don’t wanna lose you… We can’t afford to lose each other, you know what I mean ? »
But there were days, now becoming more frequent, where he didn’t think of her… Well didn’t think of the pain of her absence that is…
He found it hard to cope with the fact that he was here, with a man he’d known for more than ten years and whom he’d never found as masculine, as attractive as today. He was losing himself in the touch of his skin, the way he smelled, the depth of his eyes… dilated with pleasure.
« Why are you sad? » Jewel asked, worried, taking her brother’s arm. « Is it because of Daddy’s lover ? She isn’t nice, that’s why?» her lips quivering with apprehension.
« He loves you. Don’t ruin this because of your macho prejudice... There’s nothing wrong to love a man… There’s nothing wrong to love someone, whatever the gender. It’s the most beautiful token of trust to give one’s body to the other. It’s the greatest proof of love to give oneself to the other »
They spent the late afternoon strolling ... They even bought some sweets for Chadwick and his father and a dress for Jewel .
"I .... I'll just be a shadow, I promise but ... ask me to stay with you Dean", almost supplicating, eyes still closed. .
Dean’s body was found the next morning, laid at the foot of the alter… His heart had simply stopped beating.
« Lisa » he grabbed her hand and tried to pull her closer to kiss her. She allow that last contact. He felt her hand against his chest, but she was pushing him away. He could feel her perfume one last time.
« Shhhhh...» Castiel put a finger on his lips, forcing Dean to remain silent. « Please. Don’t say anything»
« Here you go, sweetie » Castiel gave her a can of orange juice and put the bowl of popcorn on the table.
From the day of the burial during the first months of Grieving, tension ran high in the family apartment.
Within a short while, Dean’s legs were on top of Jewel, Chadwick’s arms were above Dean’s head, and Jewel was stuck between them.
" Yeah… We are a family and I love him too " Chadwick granted his father a last smile and walked out of the kitchen.
“Ok. Something has definitely happened,” Balty confirmed, laughing. “Have you seen that hottie? Dammit! You hit the jackpot on this one,” he said, nudging Castiel.
He saw the panic in his friend’s eyes when Dean looked at him. He leaned dangerously to the side to grab Wink’s bridle.
« Zeke ! » Castiel peeked at the stairs. « That’s enough » He frowned. « You need to calm down and go home now. We’ll talk about it when your head’s clear. »
That night, he waited for Castiel, sitting in the armchair. As hours passed, he felt more and more tensed… He was beginning to worry… he was getting impatient… And most of all, he was beginning to cogitate...
The latter had told everything to Balty who of course couldn’t keep his mouth shut. Dean’s eyes were shouting « Traitor ! » to Castiel...
There was a long monologue from Dean, punctuated with little laughters and not these usual « oh shit » or « dammit »...
« No... We’re also breeding horses... That’s on the agenda for the day after tomorrow… They are confined on the Western part of the property... We had to build up a fence because of cattle theft »
The teacher walked to the little girl and displayed that superior attitude which Dean despised more than anything.
Bobby gave Jewel a genuine fake diploma of the best godmother to Tessa as well as all the material she needed to care for her so-called goddaughter.
Dean is startled when the bottle explodes. He watches the liquid spill on the table and Castiel's blood mixes with the amber.
Sam saw the single tear roll down his brother’s cheek, the first and only the man would spill for the angel.
Tension got more and more uncomfortable as Saturday was approaching. Balty had called to hear from Castiel. He sounded worried but Castiel deliberately avoided the subject.
Lying on the couch, he stared at the ceiling for a long while, his forearm resting on his eyes. He took a deep breath. Castiel’s body pushing on his had awaken a swell of desire growing somewhere further down.
« You won’t get an answer from the birds out there, but from him » Jo casually replied from the door frame. « Bobby is waiting for us. Come down now. »
« Nothing… Never mind... It’s just that this period of the year reminds me of bad memories and ... »
« Good God » he put down his cup without touching it. « What do you mean ? You… did it ?! You… » he stared at Dean who couldn’t look back at him. « Since when? »
« WHAT ? » Now he really was pissed. « NEVER... Why don’t you give me a stepladder while you’re at it ? » he tried again to get his foot in the stirrup.
John tries to pat him on the shoulder but, too drunk, he loses his balance and almost takes his son down with him.
Castiel remained silent, absent-minded. " What’s the matter ? You’re still thinking about what happened earlier? I should be the one making a fuss about it, don’t you think? "
« A teacher of mine used to say that any person has been granted intelligence and that beauty is just a matter of perspective» Dean stated in a casual tone as he observed the emaciated guy standing in front of them.
He knew Castiel would agree to step aside, for the children’s sake and his own. He had said so before, but Dean wasn’t to be taken in by this declaration, he had seen how much it had affected Castiel to say the words...
Bobby came back and saw Jo curled up on her chair, lost in her thoughts, staring at her plate. She had hardly touched her scrambled eggs.
At the first Motel, he parked, Sam still hadn’t said anything… He hadn’t even been surprised that Dean had not headed towards the outside of town to bury or burn the body.
« I know what you mean, but I’ve learned to live with it for the last ten years » he pulled him closer and kissed him tenderly.
« I do… And I’m pretty sure he knows you well enough to understand, otherwise he would have left already»
« Don’t tell me you ruin a perfect sex night just to invite me for breakfast ? » he said, pouring himself a cup of black liquid.
"I was just thinking... You know ! Where he was? What he was doing? " Sam says distractedly, staring at his cup.
« Yeah » the other one said, blushing a little. « We’ll do that… He’s eager to meet you too » Balty smiled again.
« But… but… I must be dreaming... These are not my kids! » he finally said, sinking back in the couch cushion.
« Dean, I offered my help to set up the tents, you declined, remember ? » he replied throwing an armful of wood on the ground.
He looked forward to the end of the year to resume a normal life and avoid thinking about the same things again: his mother, Tessa, all the ones he had loved and who weren’t there to share these moments with him… Those who wouldn’t see his kids grow up and see how he had managed to go on with his life despite the painful burden of their absence.
Dean and Castiel got out of the pool : the children were observing a reckless frog on the edge of the pool.
« What about watching a good “Rio Bravo”, huh? » he asked Apache, rubbing his hands in anticipated joy.
Toasts were waiting for the guest’s good will. Dean felt a twitch in his stomach. How would Balty welcome the news and more particularly, the fact that he had asked Castiel not to mention it ?
« Don’t you mess around with their lives, Balty. I’m begging you » he put a hand on his cheek and forced Balty to look at him.
Castiel would smile, once more, and tell him it was all right, although each fiber in his body was screaming otherwise.
« You… better watch out, ok ?» Dean gently pushed his son away. « We’d better get some sleep if we wanna be fresh tomorrow »
" Why not ? We owe him at least that... After all, if he has nothing left, it's still a bit our fault, don't you think! " Sam reminds, sarcastically, as he gets up to fixe another coffee.
Dean, arm resting on his forehead, stares again and again at the ceiling of his room and in the tears which suddenly escape, he perceives this ocean in which he has immersed so often and haunt his nights.
The morning after, there were timid knocks on the door and Castiel woke up. It was Sunday. He smiled and caressed Dean’s face.
" Where’s Castiel ? " Jewel asked, looking at her brother with begging eyes. " Is he mad at us ? " she went on, her lips trembling with contained emotion.
"And then I told myself that it was about our life, our choices ... You're an element of this family balance, Cass ... Words like those we heard earlier aren’t the first and won’t be the last we hear... It bothered you today because you think about the impact on the children, I can understand that, but you should to talk to them first ... you’d be surprised by their reactions ... You are a full part of their lives, Cass ..."
The waitress came to take their order ... Dean took a beer, Castiel a coffee ... They ordered two sodas for the kids.
When he woke up, he felt filled with disgust leading to nausea and the physical urge to live the moment again and again.
« There’s nothing to say. You always stand up for the kids and I’m supposed to be the bad guy, as usual. »
This gesture had destroyed the little resistance left in his heart... She had seen her brother cry on very rare occasions and she had felt much more shaken by his blow than his attitude when he had collapsed in her arms, feeling lost, out of control.
He first admired Jewel’s drawing, representing the whole family, standing in front of the Christmas tree. She had drawn him at the right of Dean, her brother and herself were standing on each side of the dog, in front of Dean.
Gabriel reconnected with his brother. They're speaking on messager. Naomi found out and read their chats.
Monday morning, he would launch the procedure. Sam had told him it would take some time. But Dean had made up his mind. They all had made up their minds.
" She loved you, Cass... She wouldn’t stop talking about you... Maybe she guided us towards each other "
Chadwick raised and howled. Jewel almost fell from the bed and screamed. As a matter of fact, it was a mixture of scream and laughter.
Dean had a hard time calming down the kids and had to raise his voice, which he rarely did. Most of the time, one look was enough to get the kids behave properly.
Hands in the pockets of his trench coat, Castiel steps forward and watches the fair. He feels an arm around his shoulders.
All of a sudden, Dean felt everyone was looking at him. He glanced at the queue in front of the cash desks… He saw the smiles… the pokes…
When she looked at the Impala driving away, followed by the Ford, Megan couldn’t help but thinking that this family was everything but ordinary.
" When I saw you kiss him the first time " the boy started with hesitation, " I found it... " he took a deep breath, knowing he would hurt his father, " I found it disgusting " he finally admitted, nervously twisting his fingers.
« Why ? » Castiel repeated already, disappointed by the answer that he was about to say. « Because he was nothing but a rich spoil brat… a handsome and smart one… because he always got what he asked for, because he always succeeded in everything he undertook, because he thought you can buy anything… He offered me a car, and then holidays at the end of the world… The moment I looked at something in a shop window, he would buy it for me... I ended up refusing all his gifts, which made him mad. I wasn’t happy. He was unable to understand that I didn’t give a shit about his money. All I wanted was him »
"I don’t mind going out with you, you know that, Dean ... But you need to spare precious moments with them, face to face."
"You live your life, I live mine ... But there’s no way that I’ll change OUR life because it doesn’t seem proper for some country bumpkins who think that two guys living under the same roof are necessarily faggots or a couple "
He joined them with empty cups in his hands, followed by Jo holding the coffee pot: he was Dean actually had tears in his eyes.
The children were observing the landscape without a word, absorbed by the beauty of the land and the rhythm of their mount.
Then, suddenly, the sound of an engine that Dean immediately recognizes echoes the childish laughter. He jumps up, his cheeks turned pink by the cold.
« Your father was working this morning. He gave your sister carte blanche to pick up his costume. So I took the ones you had reserved for yourself, I selected mine and your sister chose… this! » He pointed to Dean’s costume.
« Good morning » a little voice said. He turned around and noticed Jewel hadn’t had much sleep either.
« Pffffft » Balty joined Bryan. « That being said, how can one resist to such a gorgeous ass, huh? » he mumbled, staring at his butt in a lustful way.
« I love it. It’s better than the stuff you served last year » he replied as he cut another piece of duck.
“Of course I do! My Nina and I... That’s what happened... Bam! Without warning... and look at us... Twenty-five years later, two children and still together... I’m not saying it’s a bed of roses every day, but I would change my life for nothing in the world.” He smiled at Dean. “That feels weird, right?”
« If you say so, Bobby » Yet she refrained from mentioning what she had learned, what she couldn’t tell Bobby, hence keeping her promise to Dean.
Jewel felt lost, all of a sudden... She considered Castiel as a member of the family, she had know him since she was born, he was part of her life.
«Coffee’s waiting for you inside » Bobby replied, grabbing the largest luggage. « Jo has arrived before you, she’s so eager to see you guys »
Sam has left home. He skipped a grade, got a scholarship and a place in a prep' class at a big L.A. school. He wants to be a lawyer. Despite his younger brother's to let him alone, Dean encouraged him to pursue his dream. Sam had been waiting only for his approval, ignoring their father's since the day he threw Castiel out of the family house.
Castiel smiles, weary, at this emerald mirror that drunkenness is not enough to make disappear. He lets sorrow drown his distress drinking to his health.
Dean came back in the room and saw Jewel sitting on a chair that seemed too big for her, swinging her feet and narrating their last game of Twister to Castiel.
“Kept what? That fact that he’s always acted out of love… The fact that he had be completely human to be able to put words to what he was feeling… It was obvious to everyone how he felt about you and you knew it!” Dean said nothing, instead turning back to the house they were watching.
« He’s teaching English literature. Actually, he will be teaching soon… Right now, he’s preparing his thesis»
" We heard you fight with Castiel. We had gone out of our room and we saw you kiss him " he said, feeling a bit uncomfortable.
"No way," Benny answers, putting his hand flat on his chest to stop him from moving forward. "Not now that I've managed to shake this beautiful mask," raising his hand to caress Castiel's cheek with his fingertips. "If you want, I can show you what this fool is missing. ", he whispers, lustfully, in the hollow of Castiel's ear. "You're worth a thousand times this Lisa. ", kissing the back of his neck.
As for Dean’s Friday night TV sessions, that was a different story ... The children were making fun of the awkward special effects in horror movies that wouldn’t even scare a two-year-old and their father was disappointed at their lack of imagination, nipped in the bud .
Week-ends were never planned out… Dean sometimes worked at the garage on Saturdays if needed… Castiel would then bring Jewel to her dance class and Chadwick to his swimming lessons…
« What about presentations?! » he turned to Bryan, lost between Chadwick and Jewel who looked at each other without a clue.
When they finally came back home, they were all extremely tired... Dean painfully climbed the stairs to his bedroom to get changed, almost tripping on every step....
Nobody asked any question… Jewel was playing with her coloring book, babbling with her brother. Both kids had kept the special white box at close proximity.
« What happened? » He asked several minutes later, breaking the long silence, crossing Castiel’s eyes in the rearview mirror.
It's the Easter holidays. Unlike other years, the Winchesters don't go to the Singers. John has decided to close the garage for a week to spend some time with his boys.
As he swallowed the last bite of his fried chicken, he discretely looked at the people around the table. Jo was teasing Chadwick about his dance class girlfriend… Bobby was laughing at Balty’s nonsense.
He didn’t pay attention to Mabel either, the Mexican housewife who had served his mother for almost 20 years... Yet he was very attached to her as she had never judged him and was probably the only one in the family environment to accept who he was.
Then he put Dean’s one on with a long sigh. However, if Castiel was gifted in accomplishing so many things, he surely hadn’t any talent for cooking.
« No, the Boss just told me he’s in love with a guy and that took me by surprise » they stopped laughing.
« I’ve spent a great evening » she said, in a half-lie. « You have a wonderful family » she looked inward.
Dean was standing there… in a full Winnie the Pooh outfit, including the rubber paws (hands and feet), dressed in fake fur from head to toes.
« May be » Castiel answered as honestly as he could. « I don’t know, I never thought of our relationship that way »
« I’m the most spoiled daddy in the world » He pulled his son towards him and gave him a kiss. « Thank you… I love you, Son. »
Castiel gathered the bags scattered on the floor ... They had bought some more stuff: clothes for Chadwick and sneakers for Jewel ... Dean had bought a two-color sweater and another pair of jean.
He comes down. the angel looks up, sharp-blue-eyed. A veil of sadness crosses in this oceans and twists Dean's heart.
Dean parked the Impala in front of the house. Jack, the old Rottweiler barked a happy welcome and suddenly froze the moment it saw Apache jumping out of the car.
Dean drowns in his notebooks and his classes to forget this brother too far and erase those blue eyes that keep haunting him.
« I’ll need to have a word with Balty when we get back » Dean growled, in a tone that augured nothing good.
« So when do you intend to introduce her, now that you’ve spilled the beans? » Balty said with bitter irony.
So he used to order at the caterer’s and had never found reasons to complain about the quality until now, even though he knew his guests wouldn’t be happy with one part of the menu...
Castiel steps aside, bypasses Dean and goes to the open gates of the school. Leaving Dean whitout loocking back. the Sedan starts up again.
« I forbid you to let go, Dean Winchester… Do you hear me ?... Don’t you ever let these two assholes ruin everything, all right ? Do you remember how long you withdrew into yourself after Tessa passed away ?...7 months, Dean… 7 months !.... And you all survived this, more bonded than ever.... This is just one more trial you’ll overcome, and you’ll be stronger than before… All you need is a bit of patience because he went through a lot and right now, he has no clue as to how to express it... You, more than anyone, should know ; after all, you kept your pain down deep inside for so long»
They spoke for several minutes, sitting next to each other, exchanging looks, confidence and smiles.
"I'm going,.." Dean warns him, eyes fixed on the palm and the three shards that pierce it deeply. "Say something," Dean begs.
« SURPRISE ! » Dean grabbed Castiel by the collar and dragged him to the ground on his right. Castiel lost his balance and fell on his knees, ended on his wrists and finally fell face down too.
« A painter ? » he made a face. « Don’t tell me he paints this modern stuff with multicolor spots » he suddenly recalled the modern art exhibition they had visited. Thanks Balty!
“Don’t mess things up now,” Gaby said very seriously. “And you, stop brooding,” he reprimanded Ash who was sulking in a corner. “May I remind you poor Kevin is sitting next to you?”
Castiel stood up and glanced at the car as Jewel was fighting with her brother to hop in first ... Dean looked up at heaven, opening the driver’s door.
The children were right. He was happy again and all that mattered was they had their share of suffering, they deserved some happiness dropped on their lap.
« I could have used some help here !» he was mad, brushing through his hair covered with white spider webs.
"The kids adore you, they know who you are, what you are ... They are smart enough to make sense of things ... If adults are unable to do the same, they can go to hell ... But it’s out of the question that you feel you’re not at the right place because some narrow-minded moron assholes can’t see the great guy you actually are ... We don’t care that you're homosexual, Cass ... You understand that ... For us, you're just Castiel, a member of the family. Period. "
« He’s in the living room… Señorita, he’s gonna be so happy to see you » she said with tears in her eyes.
“Dude, you look as white as a sheet... You should come back home. I’ll tell Bobby and will replace you for the table service... There aren’t too many people, I can handle it.”
Castiel was leaning forward, his arms resting on his knees. Jewel observed him, intrigued. Chadwick stared a desperate look at Jo.
She waits calmly as the door opens on the first parents and students. Castiel gently straightens his chin and offers him a slight smile surrounded by a brown moustache.
Leaning on the sink, holding a bottle of beer, he watched them... Zeke was standing at the right of Castiel, his hand on the back seat and listening to Castiel’s recommendations of what Zeke had to do if he were to face the same problem again.
« Tessa » He had spoken about her a few times in their after sex talks. He had felt to talk about her a few times, it was better than a cigarette.
"I can understand, but he came here with you in the first place, he should at least show you some respect ! "
Madison was waiting for him, apparently absorbed in corrections for a while when Castiel entered the Café....
"You have less than an hour. Don't be here when i get home... You might miss your father," John emphasizes with a hatred he didn't know he's capable.
He had looked for more info on the net… one hundred and ten pounds… more than two feet at shoulder height.
Dean had just chased him from his life when Castiel had come to him, dying, hoping for one word that would set him free. He’d just killed him a second time.
« Dean » Castiel smiled even more, his eyes were sparkling. « ...We should take a shower, don’t you think ? » he went on, feeling he had to break the silence between them which had turned uncomfortable.
« Do you wanna know the truth, Dean Winchester? » He closed his eyes and savored the soft caress on his face. «You just don’t have the balls to do it »
. Castiel does in fact, but there are two reasons as to why the relationship is exceptional in this case. To begin with, the pairing of the individuals is, in itself, unorthodox, as both participants are male; being as though it is 1998, society has been breaking out of its shell of prejudices for some time. Although, sure enough, they still get the odd glance. Castiel, however, and his partner, Balthazar Navasky, are quite content with their aesthetically apple pie life.
Castiel stands immobile for a second, listening for any signs of a return. Placing his coffee onto the counter behind him, Castiel tiptoes away from his resting place in front of the counter, quietly stepping in the direction of the front door. The man could not see Balthazar through the fish-eye peep hole, so he stealthily walks towards the main window. There: Castiel sees between the blinds his boyfriend walking towards Broadway, no indication of turning back. With a
Kevin relaxes slightly, shrugging off his coat and hanging it next to Cas’ trench coat. Gabe sees an opportunity to carry on his jaunting. He shrugs his jacket off quickly and meanders over towards the coat hanger.
(Castiel's "acquaintance"), whilst also considering his own reply to the man. Only, today, Balthazar is still in the flat. He is at present fluttering between the rooms,
“Urm... I guess. You’re the optimist, bro.” Gabriel responds with a shrug, face slightly skewed at his younger brother’s morning cheeriness.
"I'm late." She exhales, clicking on the espresso machine once more; her thoughts turn towards the topic of today's papers, as she says: "Random House fired Dick Roman. Good riddance! Rufus Turner died. Which makes one less person I'm not speaking to.." Dean laughs at her attitude, whilst she refills her cup from earlier. Turning suddenly, she grins: "Tonight: PEN dinner."
Speaking of his brother, Gabe spins around to face him. He was curious to know what was causing Cas to act quirkier than usual. “Is there something you’re not telling me?” he smirked.
“In love? No.” At this, Gabe stands up straight with a look of concern. “Wait, yes. Of course I am. I'm in love with Balthazar. I'm practically living with Balth, head over heels..”
grasped lightly between his hands as he reads from an article; Castiel faintly acknowledges Balthazar remarking
Castiel ignores their cybersex talk and glances out the window. He spots one of their most loyal customers, Ellen Harvelle, reaching for the door with one hand, the other clasped tightly around her daughter’s hand. Castiel strolls towards the door and holds it open for their first customers of the day.
“By Monday I promise.” Kevin responds, “My brain is being fried over this paper for Friday. When that’s done, I’m all yours.”
Now Gabriel’s face twists with bewilderment. What had gotten into his brother today? He follows Castiel into the bookstore, glancing over his shoulder to check the drama has drifted down and, shutting the door when he sees the cabs disperse, flips the
Fumbling in his trench coat pockets, Cas chuckles at his brother’s displeasure for mornings. Knowing Gabriel, he most likely was out enjoying himself the night before.
"- had to have solitaire removed from their computers because they hadn't done any work in six weeks." Balthazar prolongs, halting in front of Castiel, who was grateful that his boyfriend had at least made coffee. Looking up from his mug, Castiel smiled lightly, before observing: "Aren't you late?"
, Gabe thinks. Cas attempts to act nonchalant, wiping invisible dust from the spotless countertop, but eventually the silence gets to him.
“Castiel, I’m so, so sorry I’m late. I was working late last night sorting out my paper for Friday and comple-“ Cas comes from around the counter and places a hand on his shoulder.
As it’s autumn, the theme this month is Halloween; Gabe smiles at the display he and Charlie spent hours crafting; witches dangling playfully above a black-clothed table surrounded by orange sparkling lights, pumpkin globes, and a plastic cauldron taking centre stage with neon green pipecleaners, felt, feathers, fabric (anything green Charlie could grab, she added) pouring out of the basin. Relevant books were displayed amongst the decoration, such as
“Oh, I can't even remember.” Gabe glances at him with a little smile. Cas can’t help himself and leans in, “Ok, so, the day I turned thirty I wandered into the Over Thirty Room for a joke, sort of and he was there, and we started chatting.”
Gabe almost chokes on the lollipop. “Infidelity?” He laughs loud once, in shock of Cas’ bluntness and the phrase. “What era do you think we’re in?”
Dean settles his eyes back to the screen; he must have subconsciously typed in his password at one point during Lisa's rambling, as he's currently in his inbox.
clutched in one hand and coat draped over his opposite arm, Balthazar waves the newspaper at Castiel's computer before stating: "You think that machine is your friend, but it's not." He then looks down at his watch; "I'm late."
Knowing now why she grinned, Dean falters. "Am I going?" Her only response is You promised, which Dean immaturely replies with a groan. "Can't I just give them money? That's the reason for PEN dinners, right? Free Albanian writers? I'm for that." A stern glance sent his way alters that plan, "All right; I'll go. You're late." Lisa blunders out of the kitchen towards the front door, a string of I knows following her out; she's gone.
Cas lingered in the street for a moment, face upturned to the crisp air, the autumn sun painting his face. Breathing in deeply, he stepped away from his apartment towards Broadway and, at the corner of 83rd Street, headed downtown. The West Side of Manhattan was teeming with parents, shuffling swamped children in hats and duffels, nine-to-fivers rushing to work against the flow of taxis, school buses and business vans. A blur of enthusiastic tails and panting tongues dragging their owners towards the park zipped ahead of Cas, and tall, slender buildings flourish around him as he heads further into the city’s heart.
But that were moments of closeness, laughter, sharing, and little bits of happiness from day to day life…
Dean felt his body tighten, his back arched violently as he came with his eyes closed in the hand of his lover who gently lavished some more tender strokes with the tips of his fingers while kissing his last moans away.
« Call me Dean…Cass doesn’t know you’d come… I…. I wanted it to be a surprise… Jo can’t make it, she’s attending an opening in Los Angeles… Bobby will catch up later » he said, taking their coats.
« What ? » he opened his eyes and looked around; everyone was staring at him. « Have I said something wrong ? » he asked in an innocent tone.
He ties their fingers but still refuses to look up at him because he knows what he's going to read in his eyes and he has not had the courage to tell him back. And yet God and the Devil know how much he loves his angel.
Balty had another idea, with more dramatic consequences, but this one would cost him… He wasn’t meant for Castiel, he knew that, but these two were meant for each other… He was certain of it..
They decided the visit the place from top to bottom for a change. .. From the fifth floor to the second, it seemed more logical to them... They took one of the four transparent elevators that were tirelessly carrying customers up and down between the floors.
The only thing that changed was their place at the table. Dean was now sitting at Castiel’s right, where Balty used to sit.
« You should’ve told me that you were living with a model! » she laughed, yet there was a trace of bitterness in her voice.
« Do you understand what I’m telling you right now, Cass? » he tightened his grip around Castiel’s wrist.
"How could I calm down? ... Are you kidding me? ... We’ve been living together for two years ... We've known each other for almost 10 years and now you’re coming with this??"
"Just tell me you're fine ... That you ... I'm so sorry ... I should have called you ... I should have seen that you're not fine ... is ... It's nothing that damn deal ... We all screwed up ... but I don't care ", stifling a disappointed laugh. "I ... I ... I love you Cass ... Damn if only you knew how much I love you", holding back his tears. "I'm begging you ... Come back ... Tell me you're not ..."
The tree decoration was a bit unorthodox and messy but the children were so happy and proud that they didn’t notice their father’s dubious look.
When Madame Fournier, standing stiff and leaning on the bamboo stick she was using to beat the rhythm while her husband was playing the piano, had asked the children to communicate the names of the parents who would attend the show, Jewel had spontaneously named her father and Castiel.
« Where are you, dammit? » she mumbled for herself as she left the room. « Bobby...Have you seen Dean? »
« HOLY SHIT, SAY SOMETHING, DAMMIT ! » Dean couldn’t bear Castiel’s inertia any longer. « I’m telling you that I’m attracted to you, that I’m turning gay because of you and all you do is sitting there like a stupid jerk… Say something… Anything like « shit » or « I hate you », but talk » Dean’s voice broke with emotion.
He wanted Castiel, he was dreaming of him, yet he felt incapable of admitting this first step because he knew, once they had gone beyond a certain point, nothing would ever be the same.
« NO. I said NO, Jewel… And don’t you do your puppy eyes with me, it won’t work. You won’t trick me this time »
And so went their lives… Routine somehow sidetracked by life’s whims but the routine was necessary for the children’s wellbeing… They had found themselves without a mother but surrounded by a father who loved them twice over and a man, Castiel, whom they considered to be like a second father.
Dean had gotten along with him with the impression, from the very beginning, that they had always known each other.
His throat tightened, it hurt so much he was unable to breathe. He squeezed the bottle in his hands to keep himself from collapsing there, forehead against the bar… The bar on which he wanted to bang his head against until it exploded.
Dean remained stoical : however everything in his body attitude was a clear indication he didn’t enjoy it any more than the children, keeping his hands in his jeans pockets, not knowing what to do with them.
« We’re gonna have a great time here this week, I can feel it » he said as he sat back behind the wheel.
“First of all, I’m not slaughtering that car, I’m grooming it, big difference" he pointed at the vehicle. " Then, gimme a fucking break with my old movies" he added, folding his arms on his chest. "And finally, you’re gonna wait for me right here, and that’s final!"
When her parents got divorced, Jo went to live with her father. When she turned eighteen, she went to live with Mary with whom she had kept excellent relationship. But above all, she was happy to reunite with Dean whom she’d missed more than anyone.
They reluctantly said their goodbyes. Castiel was in heaven. So were the kids. Dean had finally accepted to hold the puppy in his arms, as Jewel had insisted so much.
He wondered how Dean had managed once again to turn the situation to his advantage and have him take the blame.
«That’s why I didn’t wanna tell you about the gift » she said, giving him the most serious look in the world.
He even thought of tampering the Impala’s engine to force them to stay until everything was said and done...
Neither proved to be a good dancer ... It actually became a contest to determine who’d miss the most dancing figures ... the BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP echoed in perfect communion ... .The children was laughing their heart out, the audience was amused by these two adults trying somehow to keep up with the rhythm they had lost from the first notes ...
The song stopped and started again. Dean looked at the hi-fi with a smile and then drowned in the blue eyes again.
When he woke up the next morning, his face buried in his lover’s neck, Dean knew he had found what he had been looking for.
Dean raised his eyes. Megan and John, her husband, were standing in front of them, as well as Marissa.
Castiel was a lot more patient, was more cultured and intelligent than Dean… He didn’t mind the fact at all… Dean was better with his hands, had fiery spirit and was more pragmatic than Castiel.
« You know, love also involved exploring...Nothing forces you to act immediately… There are so many ways to show your love each other… to learn to comprehend the unknown… Kisses, first soft then more profound… Gentle caresses, exploring the other’s body… then the more intimate ones… all this is done naturally, you’ll see… you’ll be surprised. All the rest is pure instinct. Listen to your body, Dean… It will tell you when to stop way before it’s too late. I’m sure you Cass loves you enough to give you time to breathe and understand»
They looked up and down at each other for a little while. The boy had to admit: she was pretty. She had delicate features and long black hair. He took a deep breath.
She saluted him and walked away. Castiel felt heartbroken and instinctively tightened his embrace around Jewel’s shoulders.
« My little Jo is in love. Who would’ve thought ? Well well, this year is full of surprises for love hunters »
He felt the lump in his throat ; breathing air was like breathing fire. He felt the crush in his chest.
Balty had his own spare keys but he only used them when nobody was coming at the door. He actually rarely used them.
By the end of the week, Chadwick counted the money he had made. It was a nice surprise. It was way much more than what he had hoped for.
"I fucking missed you Cass," Dean takes Castiel's face in his hands and rushing to his lips to find the taste of their first kiss.
« After… after the attack… when he got home… you told me he was the man of one man… You always knew, right? »
« What about getting dressed now, kids » He stood up. « It’s almost eleven and you’re still in your pj’s »
« I loved Michael » he raised his head and looked again at Cheyenne. « It took me a long time to understand and to admit he didn’t love me »
« Castiel... » Jewel pulled his sleeve. « Will my horse be as big as this one ? » she looked a bit scared by the wooden replica in front of her.
« Excellent choice. You’ll see, in a few weeks, the spot is going to turn darker. He will be white with only that black spot »
"Hello, Dean," with that smile his friend never tires of. "Happy Birthday," handing him his present.
In a final effort, Dean managed to saddle up. He felt both a certain pride to have achieved that far and a genuine apprehension for what was to come, after all the efforts he had made already.
He finally mentioned it to Balty, but the latter didn’t get more response from his friend. Castiel would simply refuse to talk, period.
They had helped Castiel load his luggage in the car and now they were looking at him, putting on his winter coat in a deadly silence. He spoke first.
« Kids… Go and fetch your bags… We’re gonna be late for school » Castiel said in an extremely low voice.
He brushed his cheekbone with the tip of his thumb and studied all the features of this face he never wanted to forget. Each freckle, each line, wrinkle around the eyes, plump lips, small flaws which made him beautiful... Each little detail that made him love the guy more than he thought possible. He never got enough of him, and never would. He had been waiting for ten years for that moment.
« Zeke invited him in a restaurant… He’ll probably bring his « A » game» he waved his arms in the air, unable to contain his anger.
« I’ve already explained it, Pumpkin. Santa can’t be everywhere at once in just one night. Even if the elves are helping... »
« From that day on, our life as a couple – if it ever was a couple – turned to hell... His only objective in life was to show off, it quickly became unbearable... That’s when I started to sympathize with one of his cousins ; he became jealous… He couldn’t stand not being the main attraction anymore »
Castiel’s laughing out loud woke him up from his reverie. He looked at him for a long while, his lips stretched in a tender smile.
« I beg your pardon ? » he put his white wine glass on the counter and gave it a regular twist between his fingers.
“Yeah, sure... Hold on a second...” He leant to take a notebook and a pen on the work table. “I’m listening.”
« You’re now standing in the living room… The horns you see over there hanging on the wall belong to the first Longhorn that died on this property» he pointed at a brick chimney mantle piece.
Jo smiled as she saw how much he was attempting to hide it behind an indifferent expression. He smiled his kids a tensed smile and his eyes were filled with anxiety and impatience.
« Nothing at all, Cass… You haven’t done anything wrong… Don’t try to find an explanation because there is none… if it hadn’t been you, they would have picked another guy, a Jew, an Arab, an old person, a nerd, anyone… They had a thousand reasons to express their hate and no reason to be full of hatred »
Balty causally looked around in the living room, Bryan observed him getting lots in his thoughts. It wasn’t his place to judge, he knew how essential this house and family were to Balty, because of the many years he had spent around them.
« APACHE ! » Dean called at the top of his lungs. The dog jumped on his feet and ran towards the lake.
« Yes, he is Castiel’s lover. He is very funny. Right, Castiel ? » she added as she looked at him. He shuffled through her hair and smiled. He felt a bit uncomfortable as he didn’t know how she would react. Children were displaying such frankness, such innocence. He wished that grown-ups would sometimes display a similar attitude; everything would then be so much easier for him.
Several years ago, he had accepted to go camping with her on the West Coast, in one of those big national parks that so favored. She had been a den mother in her youth. Dean hated nature. But he loved Tessa.
" What happened to the bowl? " Chadwick asked, with an innocent voice, looking at the sink filled with crepe batter.
At first there was a long silence and then suddenly Chadwick’s laughter resonated, soon imitated by Jewel’s.
" Are you feeling so uncomfortable that I lead the game ? " Castiel asked while he put on his boxer briefs.
« It’s the feeling of caressing fingers on the skin, electrifying and arousing desire. The kisses softly raining down the chest and linger on the sensitive spots » he explained, pointing at Dean’s nipples. «...and travel down until they capture the object of desire, and claim its warmth »
« It crossed my mind… C’mon, we need to get some sleep or we won’t be fit for duty tomorrow » he let his empty bottle on the coffee table.
Dean leaned back against the front hood with Castiel by his side ... Children running around the car, tireless .
He smiles. He should show him how proud he is of him, but he doesn't know how to approach his son anymore. Dean slides like an eel.
On top of that, the dog rushed towards him at the precise moment Dean raised his head, his face was rewarded by a big wet lick.
Each time Dean felt his body reacting, he would sense the fear crawling inside again. He would then push Castiel away, sometimes a bit harshly. And they would do as they had done before, foreheads against each other, hand on the back of the neck, to regain control, to deny the other’s body… to apologize...
« Who, Peterson? » she hesitated between laughter and astonishment « the old Mrs. Peterson » she insisted.
He’d only just put the key in the hole when Apache rushed from the living room to greet him. He stroked him absent-mindedly and closed the door behind him.
Dean knew he had to calm down. Indeed, this week-end was meant to be relaxing and he refused to spoil the party by being a pain in the ass; after all, this was supposed to last for two days only.
His gaze wanders over the bedside table drawer. On the images of his dead drunk father and on this little hand that holds his.
“Don’t be jealous, honey... I just wanted to feast my eyes... That guy isn’t even gay, it’s obvious... You’ve got nothing to fear,” he said, winking at him.
« So, stop thinking and start acting. It’s not really that different than fucking with a woman, you know »
He woke up on the couch, half-naked, snuggled up against his lover’s torso. He ran his hand through Bryan’s short hair , held him tighter and inhaled his smell. He turned his head and looked at the mantelpiece. He thought of Castiel. He suddenly felt a twinge of sorrow as he thought of all the moments they had spent together... Confessing what he felt for Bryan put an end to this strange relationship he had had with Castiel and it hurt. He missed Castiel’s body, his smell, the taste of his skin… His voice, his ocean-blue eyes… But he had finally made a choice. It was time for him to settle down.
« Not me » Dean was now laughing, raising an eyebrow. « Holy shit, not me, for sure » he turned to his meal preparation again. « If it hadn’t been for him, I’d never… » Dean suddenly stopped talking.
« Sorry, you got me wrong… it’s just… » Dean’s voice was a bit shaking. « It looks yummy ! » the tone of his voice had changed.
Dean couldn’t get rid of the turmoil eating him from the inside… with such pervasiveness… Did he love her or was he just afraid of being alone?
All that was left was the vessel Jimmy Novak, whom they had found lost right in the middle of the battlefield…
Dean had prepared the meal and had been waiting for half an hour now. As usual, Balty was late. He stroke Apache’s head and sighed.
« He’ll never get laid with you. The mere thought of touching you must be seem repulsive to him» he shouted, angry and hurt. His budding love had been cut to the root.
«You did great, pumpkin » he helped her down the horse as Mark was bringing Light back to the second paddock.
« Oh Mr. Winchester » Mrs. Crowley, the 80-year-old woman living down the street, was in awe. She distributed the treats. « It’s the most beautiful costume I’ve seen all evening »
“Yes, I do. A Mustang. But I had to bring her to the garage, she’s got some starting problems. I hope it’s nothing too serious... I love that car, it was my father’s.”
The late afternoon was pretty quiet… The kids were watching a Xmas movie, almost glued to the TV screen.
« I knew it… the day I told you I loved you and you didn’t answer… the day you introduced me to your family and I saw him… the day I saw the two of you together… I just knew » she said, wiping the tears away.
« Don’t fuck with me, OK ? » he said pointing his finger at him. « I was just a little boy and they looked very big to me back then » He was just trying to find an excuse.
Breakfast went on as if nothing happened: they talked about the day’s projects. Jewel intended to spend the whole afternoon with Tessa... She had so much to tell her, she announced, without giving any more details...
« I’m not a member of your family, Dean. She’s right» Castiel replied in a voice broken with emotion.
Chadwick got a new helmet and brand new knee and elbow pads as his had been definitely ruined during their last visit.
Castiel violently pushes him away before punches him on the face. Tears a cry of pain out of both of them.
There was a sudden gust of wind and snow when the young man opened the door and left. Bobby looked at the window. It was snowing again.
He stopped in front of his bedroom, opened the door, peeking at the stairs leading to Castiel’s bedroom.
« What truth? » his voice was nothing more but a faint whisper. « He knows the truth. I suspect he’s known for a long time ».
« Honey, when he starts feeling a bit too tight down there… » she went on with a wink « Don’t worry, he’ll have a rethink »
It was a surprise for him, this warmth in his mouth. He lost all sense of time. Even his gestures became more natural. He listened to Castiel’s breathing, giving rhythm to the back and forth sensation.
They shot balloons and won two giant pluchies : Scrat, the squirrel for Dean and Bullwinckle, the moose for Sam.
He opened the cupboard. There were at least a dozen cups of different sizes. Should he use a mug or a plain coffee cup ?.
“So? You want me to waste a kid, is that it? … You want her dead, do the dirty work yourself… You’re used to it, it shouldn’t bother you.” Dean opened the fridge and pulled out a beer.
The silence that grew between Bobby and Jo, lost in their thoughts, was suddenly broken when the children rushed in, fighting over who would have access to the shower first.
Castiel observed the children’s attitude and their eyes, conspicuously going from their father to him. He finally stared at Chadwick and knew. He knew that look all too well.
As he made himself comfortable, Dean’s body brushed against Castiel’s and he noticed the man was completely naked under the comforter.
Castiel looks at himself in one of the mirrors. His head is hug and his body is crushed and it hurts.
They were all very quiet during supper. Nobody spoke more than a few words. Jewel was the only one to put her fork down from time to time to narrate an argument with a classmate about some drawing. No one was listening. No one really understood where she was getting at anyway.
He had put on his pants and was bare-chested and barefoot. He was staring at his feet, unable to cross eyes with Castiel, even his reflection in the mirror.
« Yeah, especially ours » Castiel corrected as he stood up from the old root he had used as a bench.
"Our life are a mess, Dean... So no one cares that you've got a crush on an angel," Sam laughs gently.
« It’s pissing me off » he whispered. « Why did I introduce him, goddammit ? » he ran his fingers through his hair.
" How does it feel to see your father with another man ? " Dean said, relieved at last to have been able to say the words, yet anxious that his son might look at him with disgust or reject him.
"Happy birthday, son... Don't be mad at them," John says, pointing to the others. "This idea is my idea... not their."
"Nothing that concerns you", noticing, surprised, that he rolled up the sleeves of his shirt. He unrolls them immediately.
« If you want, I can show you my beautiful body right now » he said as he started to undress and get rid of his shoes, launching them across the room.
"I guess these two buldges are supposed to represent the breasts and this…” pointing a wire "A man's sex"
"NO, NO," Dean replies immediately "I don't want you to go... just give me time to...", he's rubbing his face nervously. "Shit... you're in love with me?!", hesitating between laughing or giving a chance to this little voice whispering : "Why not? "
After all, Dean thought he’d better tell everyone, once and for all. His absence had already been the first clue on what he was about to announce.
What was his type, anyway ? He never saw any picture of Michael, but as far as he knew, he was rather handsome, just like Balty for that matter...
Cheyenne obeyed without orders. The children were watching him… There was a faint smile on Castiel’s face… And some sadness too, although Dean was the only one to notice it.
"You can always run... And don't you dare run out of here before you spill the beans. ", he yells, holding him by his shirt sleeve.
His son stands near the kitchen doorway, with Castiel to his right and his damn blue eyes that seem to pierce John's soul.
« You met at the old cinema theater… she told me about it several times » He said, feeling nostalgic.
Chadwick decided to talk a walk in the hills with Apache. Dean didn’t mind anymore his son needing some privacy and moments of solitude to secure his emotional balance.
He took a long shower, lost in his thoughts. The closer the moment of the gathering, the more difficult he managed to remain calm. He kept nibbling his lip, pacing between the kitchen and the living room, with a beer in his hand.
We didn't exchange  a word to the motel ... I took a room with two beds, the guy looked at us smirking. He stared at you, lustful gaze, and I almost stuck one on him.
« Nonsense. Don’t tell me he’s doesn’t feel like taking the dive, I won’t believe you » she smiled when she saw the pancake put in front of her.
« He will never love you » Zeke kept repeating. « You treasure your dreams rather than real life... You’re pathetic. Look at you !» Zeke looked at him up and down. « You keep hoping for more all the time. I’m sure that you’d still believe in him even if he kicked you out of his life. That guy sucked the marrow out of you. »
" Are you mad at him ? " Chadwick asked. Castiel didn’t answer. " He loves you very much, you know "
He wasn’t made for fatherhood and had never expressed any desires for it… But he adored Jewel and Chadwick.
Chadwick threw himself in his father’s arms. They remained in each other’s embrace for a long while. Dean was gently stroking his son’s hair, and sort of cradling him. His son… his flesh… his blood !
«Your turn » as he handed her the bowl with the egg-cream melange she had prepared a few minutes earlier.
He stood up and rubbed his hands on his jeans. Castiel looked at him, waiting, without expecting anything in return.
« Yet, if you’re here, it means you need it » Matt said with a wry smile. « Today’s your lucky day, Kate’s on duty » he added with a wink, holding the door wide open.
Castiel meets Bobby's worried and apprehensive face. He lets himself be carried away by Dean without taking his eyes off the old man.
« Why would I be mad at you, Balty? I can’t find a way to thank you for all you’ve done for our family lately… Of course, you’re a great guy with the manners of a true sex maniac most of the time, but this family wouldn’t be what it is without you » he added as Balty’s blue eyes met his.
He stared at the ceiling then closed his eyes on the memory of what had just changed his life forever.
Their intimate relationship remained what it had been up till then. Dean still felt some reluctance to do certain gestures. On that particular Wednesday, when he felt Castiel’s hair softly brush against his groin, crushing on his pillow, hit by a wave of pleasure, he told himself that he would have to take that step one day himself.
They spent the rest of the day around the campfire. The children had spent more time with their horse. They had a hard time to hold the tears so Dean promised they would come again one day.
Nevertheless, he couldn’t oblige his father to sacrifice his life for them. He was already giving so much… Everything in fact.
He had known him for a long time… He could read him like an open book even if Castiel was rather reserved when it came to speaking about himself.
The only information they knew about the assault was in the police report they’d read; the rest was lost somewhere in their friend’s empty eyes.
"That's enough! ", John says, furious. "If you don't tell me what you're doing in front of my house in the next second, I'm calling the police. ", going from Castiel, getting paler and paler, to his mother with pinched lips.
« Dean finally found his match, who’d have thought ? So, does the lucky lady have a name ?» she asked, washing her hands in turn.
« I haven’t said anything wrong.» Balty said, falsely offended. « You’re the one with a twisted mind » He said, frowning.
"Leave it to me, boys," as he lifts him into his arms. " Dean, call Dr. Mills,tell her it's an emergency. "
"Bullshit, Cass! ", rushing towards him. "AND LOOK AT ME WHEN I TALK TO YOU," forcing him to lift his head with one hand under his chin.
For Jo, Dean’s offer to make scrambled eggs sounded like a reminder of old times, when he was taking care of her although they weren’t really related.
He wouldn’t have felt so pathetic and feeling like crying. He was indeed looking for excuses to avoid the way he felt. He tried to imagine them both in the same bed, recalling all what he had talked about with Balty… He could never cross that border.
A three-meter high statue of Caesar was greeting the guests at the entrance. Dean grumbled, unable to comprehend how so much money could be invested in such horrors.
He put his trench coat back in place, smiling sadly as he searched for that damn tie which wasn’t in sight and he missed it.
Gabriel - although he would not admit out loud - was proud of this store; proud of its growth, proud of its achievements, proud of its charisma, but mostly proud of his brother for taking it on and keeping
Good morning, Charlie.” Cas beams at her. Charlie was a valuable team player, helping with the IT and sales as well as getting on marvellously with the children. Her fangirl persona thrived when she interacted with the children.
, Cas endears. He scoops the keys from his pocket, unbolts the gate which loudly cranks open simultaneously with the screech of two cabs swerving in front of the store. The cabdrivers hurl insults at one another, car horns blaring amongst the chaos. Unlocking the door, Cas sweeps the door open and announces:
Possibly Castiel has just been feeling quite forlorn of late, as Balthazar has been caught up in his current publishes for
. The whirring of the computer and tills tell Gabe that Cas is hunched over the till behind him, firing up the store’s data system.
Kevin, don’t worry, you’re just in time. Any longer and I reckon there would be one less person standing here right now.” Cas emphasises this towards Gabe, yanking the sweet Gabe kept smacking his lips on from his mouth, and tosses it in the bin.
Just as he was about to sign into the messaging service, Lisa – Dean's girlfriend of two years – saunters into the kitchen, clad head-to-toe in Armani, the morning papers clamped under her elbow; Dean perceives that she is late to work, again.
And then, an instant in reality but a lifetime for him, Castiel hears his three, beloved little words:
Waiting for his computer to load (and - praying - for that inevitable email), Dean pondered over the message he had sent the previous evening. In spite of remembering almost every single syllable of that email, which did make him want to (marginally) cringe, Dean was satisfied with the outcome, and felt that he was now comfortable enough to talk a tad more openly about himself; he smiles lightly as he recalls his email:
"How will we survive?" Castiel jokes, stretching around Balthazar and seizing his coat from the table chair's back. Balthazar mockingly looks glumly at Castiel for a second, before taking the coat.
The doorbell jingles sweetly. All three turn to see their colleague, Charlie Bradbury; ginger locks trapped beneath chunky headphones, sporting one of many of her fangirl t-shirts. Today, it was a
He turns away from the door and looks into the store, a round table central in the foyer bursting with recently published children’s books. To the left is Cas, keyboard clattering beneath his fingertips, and behind the table the store expands, a carpeted area in one corner of beanbags, small brightly coloured chairs and puppets littering the floor. Shelves encompass the room, squashing books crammed with worlds of fantasy and adventure, dragons and princesses, wizards, talking animals, monsters and aliens and robots, fact and history. For the adults, a glass case of early edition books -
“Never mind, it’s nothing. We don't talk about anything personal. We made a rule about that. I don't know his name, what he does or exactly where he lives, so it will be really easy to stop seeing him, because, well, I’m not.”
Those three words are what urge him just to wake up every day. Those three words can excite him, intrigue him, and make his chest bloom, all in one sitting. Those are the three, fundamental little words that just make Castiel Novak's morning. Make it particular, just for him.
“A profound what now?” Gabriel tries extremely hard not to laugh at this, but his creased eyes and poorly concealed grin only  adds to Cas’ grief.
. It’s charm shines through the large bay window, draped in fairy-lights twinkling over arrangement of children’s books on display and Steiff bears accompanying them. A man is dawdling beneath the overhang, and Castiel doesn’t need clarification to know who he is; the short posture, ash brown hair curling low beneath the ears and khaki jacket says enough.
Dean Winchester felt infatuated. This detail was a transparent as glass, according to his last subject to his enthralling, if not eccentric "contact"; about his dog, of all things. Of course, Dean cares for his dog greatly, but is another man really going to give a damn?
, Castiel is, in reality, not going behind Balthazar's back; why would he? He loves the man greatly. The only dubious component of the whole ordeal is that Castiel only ever replies to his pen-pal when Balthazar is out of the apartment, which is not in any way highly mistrustful. Conversely, the only reason why Castiel is even responding to this obscure person – a man, to clarify – is because he finds the fellow New Yorker captivating. The young man appreciates that he can oh-so-easily converse and remark with this acquaintance (friend, dare he say?), especially as Castiel has recently apprehended that Balthazar, despite the fact that he really does love him, has become quite.. outlying.
Secondly (and most perplexingly, given the circumstances), Balthazar is not the correspondent of said emails which are making Castiel swoon like a schoolgirl.
He carries on with his recollections, and only then considered why on Earth he had continued with his next sentence:
Pulling a disgruntled face at his brothers online sex life, Castiel stands up straight and, head held high, tells him firmly, “Well, it's not like that at all. We just email. It's really nothing, harmless really, on top of which I'm definitely thinking of stopping because this profound bond I have tow-“
, but Castiel also notices that his partner unintentionally flirts overly with anything with a pulse, which only adds irritation to his already lonely, confused state.
is inscribed delicately upon the pillow in gold lettering, contrasting his dog's name completely, but Dean merely shakes his head fondly, ever wondering why he allowed Lisa to do such a thing.
Balthazar merely continues: "You know what this is, Cassie, what is happening right in front of us? We're observing the end of Western civilisation as we know it."
A love-struck Castiel goes to work, gets teased by his brother and listens to his colleagues talk about cybersex.
« Next time you see him, don’t shillshally, kiss him for good» she made it for a table close to the counter.
« I’ll ask Jo to drive you home, ok ? Anyway, Cass needs to rest now » he said, raising the boy’s chin with a finger.
« I’m just making the best of things » he replied, pushing Jewel towards her father who slipped as he tried to catch her and ended up face down again. This time they were all alerted by the different sound they heard and stopped laughing.
"You should know I don’t give a shit ... What pisses me off is that he didn’t have the balls to say it in the open ..."
And as each year since she had learned to speak, Jewel was asking a thousand questions to her brother, apparently unable to catch the difference between the hero from the past and the one from the present. Chadwick patiently explained her that the angel Clarence wanted to show what the hero’s life would be, had he chosen a different path.
Chadwick and Jewel found it easy to follow Castiel, first of all because their fear was gone, and then because Garth had picked up the perfect horses for them.
He knew he could talk to her, tell her everything, but the words somehow stayed stuck in his throat.
Dean saw Castiel walk away, with a hand on his lower abdomen and rush in a nearby alley. He came back a few minutes later.
Dean caught him in a private conversation with Castiel more than once, and in those moments, he could see a faint smile on Castiel’s lips.
Madame Fournier nodded without a word. Standing tall, stiff neck, leaning on her cane. Castiel couldn’t help finding something fascinating about her, like she was a vivid portrait of a typical ballet dancer.
"Eat... I'll give you thirty minutes, then I'll show you how to recognize a real beauty from a crappy copy," as Frank stood up and locked himself in his office.
Dean and Jo helped Bobby to wash the dishes, hitting each other with the towels while the kids were dancing again.
Jo called to invite them to come and choose the pup… They were all extremely nervous… Chadwick and Jewel were unable to remain calm for a second.
When his mother had given him back his friend, she had offered him the most precious gift: a family. The family she couldn’t promise herself.
« We’re gonna make it » Dean said, pulling him against him again, resting his chin on his boy’s head.
"No sweetie. Step back. It could hurt you with his antlers. He's scared and might hurt you unintentionally "
Dean felt a big wave of tenderness fill his heart and he started to smile. The little girl believed Castiel had seen her dance and that he could see her right now; he couldn’t tell her she was wrong.
" You’re glowing " Madison said with a huge smile, sipping her coffee. " I think I’m gonna need sunglasses " she teased.
« I want Dean share with him what I’m sharing with you... I want Castiel be loved by Dean because he’s the only man for him and God knows I’m right»
Suddenly, Apache stood up and ran to the living room. Someone was trying to manipulate the door knob in vain.
« Yet you have gone out twice this week… That conference on Monday and now Othello» Dean couldn’t help but phrasing the obvious.
Who’d have thought that Dean Winchester, acknowledged macho man, would make friends with a confirmed homosexual, up to the point of living under the same roof ? For sure, life had given him great lessons of tolerance and challenging.
At first, he had worried, there was no denying there. He had started to show the need for solitude after his mother’s death, yet Dean soon realized it was also in his son’s nature. He had friends and a happy life. Ty had become an ideal friend and Lindsay had become his first love, the one that turns you into a complete teenage idiot.
