Hi, loves!
“I’m fine, Mycroft,” he called, eyes closed in frustration.
He and Greg stationed themselves in the window seat on the far end of the living room, Mycroft sitting straight-backed while Greg slumped against the side of the bookcase, one leg up on the cushion on which they were seated.  He passed Mycroft his tea cup after retrieving their drinks, which he had carried in from the kitchen, from the coffee table.
“Love you, too,” he whispered, and Mycroft could feel Greg smirking where his face was tucked against his ear.
The wet heat spread through Bunny’s underwear and ran off his thighs, where it collected between his legs on the bed sheets.  Bunny lay still in bed and peed his pants until his bladder was empty.
, he whispered to himself.
Greg knew the kid could walk herself downstairs, but he was could not bear to be apart from his girl at the moment.  He carried her on his hip, proud of the recovery she had made from the morning and desperate to keep her safe for as long as possible.  He was hopeful that Sherlock would be in a place to accept and love his little sister, hopeful that Mycroft’s lingering worry over Bunny triggering thoughts of Eurus would not be on display and interfere with Bunny’s ability to be herself.
Sherlock was currently about as young as Mycroft had ever seen him over the course of the day, and while he certainly did not want to force the boy older when he was so clearly finding the release he needed at the moment, he felt it was his duty to attempt a conversation.
Mycroft could see that Greg was not happy.  He was looking at Mycroft with an expression that conveyed both anger and disappointment as they sat in the kitchen in the wake of Bunny’s tears and distressed fleeing from the kitchen.
Damn.  So much for only bringing Sherlock into the conversation if necessary.
“Sherlock, love?”
Sending you all love and bunny kisses xxoo <3
John nodded, desperate to please as always.  He climbed from where he had curled himself up on the kitchen chair and scurried down the hall.  When he reached Sherlock’s room, however, he hesitated.  John had found his favorite Gryffindor pajamas--maroon cotton with gold cuffs at the wrist and ankles--and his most comfortable dressing gown, but when it came time to choose a pair of underwear he got nervous in his tummy.
By the time Greg closed the door, Mycroft had opened the door on the other side of the car and was climbing into the seat Bunny had vacated a few moments prior.  He said nothing.  Sherlock realized he was hoping Sherlock would say something first because he more than likely assumed that might minimize Sherlock’s outbursts.  But Sherlock was frustrated with Mycroft most of all.  It was Mycroft who had organized the trip, Mycroft who had woken them up far too early that morning.  He was not going to make it easy for big brother.
John blinked at Sherlock, unsure whether to be amazed or angry.  He’d been dreading discussing yesterday for the very reason Sherlock had just mentioned, not keen to process his conflicting emotions over his gender identity while little with his--at times, rather insensitive--boyfriend.  Sherlock had been young enough that John had even questioned whether he'd even been aware of John's decision to express himself as feminine.  Clearly, he hadn't given Sherlock enough credit.
Thanks so much for all your comments and kudos--they mean so much!
“No, buddy,” he said, brushing Sherlock’s hair out of his eyes.  “I think Bunny still needs you to be his brother.  What do you think?”
Mycroft again, this time attempting to display endearing qualities by using an old childhood nickname.  Sherlock did not respond.  Let his brother suffer.
“I don’t need that,” John said, a tell-tale anger to the edge of his voice as he twisted his head over a shoulder to glance at the offending object.  “Put it back.”
“He’s alright, now,” Greg nodded, glancing back into the guest bedroom through the small sliver of the opened doorway.  “Just a bit shaken up.”
Lestrade nodded and pushed back his chair to stand from the table.  He paused and turned when he was halfway out of the room.
“Doesn’t it seem a bit...abnormal?” he asked, and here were Mycroft’s own insecurities and prejudices on display.  It had been innocent enough when it was just coloring books and movies; Mycroft was less able to accept that this was just a quirk were John standing in front of him in a nightgown.
Mycroft was more than a little touched by the kid’s offer.  The fact of the matter was that he indeed felt a bit unmoored at the moment.  He’d thought that under the twinkling lights Greg had strung around the house he’d feel differently, that he’d view Christmas in a new way through the eyes of little Sherlock and little Bunny.  But it was all a bit too much.
“I couldn’t find Redbeard,” Sherlock mumbled, and, for a moment, John was unsure if he was adult or little.   “I looked and looked, but I couldn’t find him.”
“Or I could just refuse to see them and spend all future holidays alone without the hassle of it all,” Mycroft said, cynicism showing in full force.
“How about some hot chocolate while we wait?” Greg asked, hoisting himself from the depths of the couch after patting Mycroft’s thigh affectionately.
Bunny closed his eyes and forced himself to stop squirming.  It was difficult to convince himself that he was allowed to wee in his pants, that he wasn’t going to get in trouble or get teased for wetting.  But, with a gasp, he relaxed himself enough to start peeing.  He felt a pulse of wetness inside the front of his pull-up as he released, and he fought against the instinct to stop himself, letting the pulse become a stream.  Before long, it was beyond his control, and he barely breathed as he felt the warmth soak into the pull-up, spreading upwards and then spreading downwards, soaking into the dry sections of the pull-up and then trailing towards his bum.  The stream was thick and fast, saturating the pull-up in a heavy, fast heat.
“Right,” John said with a bit of a smile.
But then, without warning, he felt himself beginning to cry.  His face crumpled as he sunk down in his chair and he began to wail.  Greg was beside him in a moment, rubbing his back and telling him it would all be okay.
“And?” Greg prompted.
“He’s, ah. In the kitchen,” John said when they’d reached the landing, taking Mycroft’s proffered coat.
Bunny nodded.  But, when Greg released Bunny from the hug, the little one was a bit weepy.  It was not surprising.  After all, they’d only recently been navigating Bunny’s shifting gender identity, and Greg knew Bunny was still a bit overwhelmed by it all.
Greg lay a hand on Mycroft’s shoulder in what Mycroft knew was an attempt to steady him.
“Didn’t trust your own ability to weasel yourself out of this one?” Mycroft asked, smirking at the fully packed suitcase which sat beside the bureau in Sherlock’s bedroom.
Greg had finished his meal by the time Mycroft had ceased listing instances of John’s affected temperament.
“Let’s get you nice and comfy, yeah?” he asked, slipping into Daddy-mode.
“Punishments,” John said.
If he had been aged up, Sherlock may have been able to identify what he it was he was feeling, may have been able to process the sinking feeling in his gut and at least begin to name his emotions.  As it was, little Sherlock could only know that he wanted his brother but Bunny had him just like he had had him for bedtime, and that made him feel like he wanted to cry.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mycroft!” Sherlock yelled after succumbing to a nasty streak of coughing, voice loud and shrill.  “The baby’s crying!”
“Which would you like, little Bunny?” Greg asked when Bunny was clean, holding out a pair of training underwear and a butterfly pull-up.
Bunny glanced up at Papa’s outstretched arms for a moment before shaking his head and burying his face into his knees, shifting away from Greg when the man reached towards him in an effort to help him out.
“Put this under your bum,” Greg said.
I don't have time at the moment to respond to comments, but rest assured that I will respond tomorrow asap, and that your comments truly bring me joy and keep me encouraged to write.  I am appreciative of each and every one of them, no matter how trivial they may seem as you send them.  I'm also super excited to see a few new readers commenting on the last chapter--I'll be responding to you all soon!
Frustration was always a part of the pattern when Mycroft was working through a rough set of circumstances; Greg had learned long ago not to take it personally.
What had happened in the conversation between John and Sherlock? It was clear there had been some type of understanding reached by Sherlock and John, one that aligned the boys in a newfound type of brotherly troublemaking.  John, apparently attempting to force himself into headspace and yet clearly still adult, had just called Mycroft his Daddy, something he would not have done unless there was an ulterior motive of some kind.
Bunny shook his head, then dropped his head into his hands, hiding his face.
Sherlock took a step forward, trying to cling onto Mycroft in a show of neediness.  But Mycroft refused to give in to Sherlock’s ploys.
“Bunny,” Mycroft warned.  “You know you’re not to be sucking your thumb today.  Take it out.  Let me see your tongue.”
“I’m not wearing this ridiculous thing, anymore,” Mycroft said, but there was humor in his voice.
“It’s okay,” John said.  “Sorry we had to leave the zoo because of me.”
“She wouldn’t tell me where he was,” Sherlock said, contemplative.
“Armadillo.”
“Alright, lad, you’re turning into a prune.” Lestrade said after quite some time.  “Let’s wash your hair and get you nice and dry.  I’ll bet our food will be here any moment, yeah?”
“I’m a big kid, Daddy,” Bunny mumbled.  “Gonna get lotsa stickers on my chart.”
“Ladybugs!” He said loud enough to make his throat hurt.  He grimaced and lowered his volume.  “Thank you, thank you, thank you Daddy.”
He turned around the corner of the building as he pissed himself, close to the wall to hide himself from the wandering investigators and crime scene technicians. Sherlock’s hand was on his shoulder, and John shrugged it off.  He didn’t want pity.
John understood.
Mycroft was not proud of the fact that, rather than admit that he was hurt by John’s decision to make light of their relationship and perhaps even jealous of what Mycroft assumed was a newly formed alliance between John and Sherlock, his first instinct was to challenge John, to beat him at his own game.
As soon as Mycroft had it clicked,  Sherlock curled in on himself once more.
“I called for you fifteen times and you didn’t come,” Sherlock said, surly as he turned his back to Mycroft, arms crossed as he burrowed down beneath the blankets.
John did not mention that he’d also been attempting to process the frequent accidents he’d had at the lake house, and the ramifications of them on himself and others.  That was a separate issue, one that he needed to discuss with Mycroft, yes, but there was only so much embarrassment a man could take in one moment.
Greg may have attempted to assure him that whatever it was that had made Mycroft so concerned about a female Bunny interacting with Sherlock was not his fault, but John had been able to see even while young that it hadn’t been exactly true.
Mycroft generally had little trouble carrying John if the kid was awake enough to hold on tight and wrap their arms around Mycroft’s waist, but Greg knew that Mycroft would currently have a bit of trouble given Bunny’s sleepy, relaxed state.  Hell, Greg was even having trouble maneuvering Sherlock at the moment.
Sherlock, not surprisingly, decided after assessing the items they had from the trunk that they would play pirates.  Bunny nodded, set Ariel the lion down on the attic floor and reached for a wide-brimmed hat with feathers sprouting from one side.
Sherlock stood to stomp his foot, which only had the effect of emphasizing his littleness, as he stomped his bare foot directly onto the puddle of urine he had just peed onto the carpet while playing.
“But I’m still your big boy most of the time,” Bunny said, pulling away from Mycroft to look him in the eye and ensure he understood.
“I figured it would be an early bedtime for these two after some dinner,” Greg said to account for Sherlock’s clothing as well as the set of Bunny’s pajamas he passed through the opened door.
“I can’t remember, John,” he mumbled.  “There’s something more but I can’t remember.”
As Mycroft climbed gently out of bed, he put a finger to his lips to signal to Sherlock that they should be quiet to keep from waking Greg or John.  Sherlock looked a bit pained when Mycroft stood at the end of the bed and gestured for Sherlock to crawl towards him, and when the boy eventually did move with a quiet moan, Mycroft could see why.  There was a wet spot on the sheets below where Sherlock had been lying, and his pajama pants were wet from where his pull-up had leaked.
“Where are my boys?” he called.
His worries were indeed irrational, even his seven-year-old self could see that.  Had he been fully adult, he would have laughed at them.  But irrational as they were, he hadn’t been able to shake the thoughts from his mind, couldn’t keep them from making him feel weepy and sad and anxious.
He hung up after a moment and Bunny’s lower lip wobbled, upset that he hadn’t been allowed to talk to his Daddy, nervous that Sherlock was angry.  His nerves were only heightened when Sherlock left the bedroom without a word, and Bunny huddled further in on himself, crying into his knees.  The man returned quickly, however, carrying Bunny’s stuffed rabbit, his baby blanket, and a pacifier, all of which he passed along to Bunny before sliding down the bedroom wall to sit on the floor, leaning his head against the frame of the closet door.
“Just like Harry Potter, buddy,” Mycroft assured, which finally earned him a smile from John.  But it was a smile which quickly faded.
“I tried to hold it,” he mumbled, breaking down into sobs and keenly feeling the urge to suck his thumb or his pacifier.  “And then I spilled the juice because I didn’t wanna be in trouble and get an ‘x’ on my chart.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not enough space, unfortunately,” Greg explained, voice sympathetic towards John’s exhaustion.  “My two brothers and their kiddos have all the beds and couches spoken for.  My oldest brother lives close, though, so we’ll get you all settled in no time.”
“Okay, my little mermaid,” he said, grinning.
Sherlock gathered up his plush alligator in one arm and Dimitri the dinosaur in the other, pulling at his bottom lip as he made his way towards Mycroft’s office, peering in through the crack in the slightly opened door when he arrived outside the room.
Greg took his hands from the door frame to wrap his arms around himself, making John realize the man was not wearing anything more than his sweater.  John immediately began unzipping the coat he had nicked from Greg, but Greg shook his head.
Sherlock’s tone of voice implied not only that he had abandoned the prospect of additional attempts at sleep, but also that Mycroft was somehow implicated in the decision.
Greg dropped the pull-ups into the trolley and took off quickly, turning the corner to check the next aisle.  It was empty except for a woman scanning through different brands of shampoo.
His room was darker than the master bedroom had been, and he'd been telling John monster stories all day when the grown ups weren't paying attention and now he'd gone and scared himself.  And his bed was all wet and he didn't want to change himself and what if the people who owned the lake house found out he'd peed in their bed and got mad and then Mycroft was disappointed in him?
“Sherlock, buddy, come back, please,” Greg tried as he followed the boy out of the room after a displeased glance towards Mycroft.
“Well, now I really wish you’d woken me up sooner,” John said as he pressed himself closer against Sherlock’s back while beginning to knead the sodden material.
“John,” he said.  “We spend a good deal of time talking about your feelings toward my behavior as your caregiver.  Perhaps it's time I told you a bit about how I feel towards you as a little.”
He sighed, pushing around the scrambled eggs on his baby animals plate without eating as he watched his Daddy and Sherlock with sideways glances.  He usually didn’t mind when Sherlock was the little brother; in fact, it had been a bit fun when Sherlock had slipped down to be a baby back when they were at the lake house--Bunny had gotten to look out for Sherlock for once and didn’t have to worry about Sherlock’s big brother teasing.  He’d been able to be himself, because Sherlock was too busy being extra little to care that Bunny wanted to play unicorns or color princesses in his coloring books.
Mycroft raised his eyebrows.
Bunny blushed and glanced over at Sherlock, who had turned to stare.
“You silly goose,” Mycroft teased.  “We have to be careful not to wake your sis--”
John could not help but dissolve into a new wave of tears.  Finally, he could be exactly what he’d been needing for days, now.  Finally he didn’t have to pretend anymore.
“Don’t stop,” he breathed, then closed his eyes against more tears as Mycroft picked up the pace and intensity once more.
Mycroft steeled himself against chastising the boy for such an unfair statement.
Bunny turned to glance up at Mycroft with wide, excited eyes.  Sherlock huffed and crossed his arms over his chest, glaring at Mycroft as if it had been his idea to invite the Detective Inspector.
He could not help but grin at what he found when he pushed the door open.  Sherlock was asleep in Greg’s arms and John was asleep behind Sherlock, their Bunny’s face pressed against the nape of their little pirate’s neck.  Greg had drifted off as well.  Now that he knew the boys were alright for the moment, he was clearly more content than he had been all day.  Mycroft draped the baby blanket over Bunny, then propped Willa the rabbit on the pillow beside him.  He settled the quilt over the three men and wished them all a whispered ‘goodnight’ as he left them to rest and pulled the door shut behind him.
Sherlock led him by the hand down the hallway.  They paused in front of the master bedroom, where he peeked his head into the cracked doorway.  John leaned down to see through as well, trying to adjust his eyes from the soft light given off by the hallway nightlight to the darkness of the bedroom.
Sherlock knew it was Papa’s way of encouraging him, of cheering him up after a tough day.  But the guilt caused by the first sparkly sticker had been enough to nearly swallow him whole the entire afternoon, and he knew there was no way he could pick another sticker for his chart without breaking down in tears over all the lies he’d told.
“Can we have a moment alone?” John asked, turning to Mycroft and Greg, who had been standing over the medical proceedings like a nervous set of parents while John worked.
“I told you chocolate milk before bed was a bad idea,” Mycroft said to Uncle Greg, who John assumed would have said bad words to his Daddy if there weren’t little ears around.
Suddenly, his avatar was being forced to run away from a boulder rolling after him in the jungle, and, as another spurt of wetness escaped through his taut muscles and into his underwear, he swore and sat up on his knees, pressing his thighs together as he hitched his hips back and shifted them side to side in order to regain control, pressing the controller buttons a bit harder than a moment before.  He could hold it.  Just a bit longer.
Sherlock pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes in an effort to stop himself from crying.
stare to know that it was exactly what Mycroft was thinking.
“I believe that’s for you,” Mycroft mumbled, voice husky from sleep yet filled with smug amusement.
“I don’t doubt that he will,” Mycroft said, voice dripping with the superiority that often accompanied his greatest shows of defensiveness.  “And when that time comes, Sherlock will know the truth.  But that time is not today.  I’ve borne this for him for many years, and I’ll continue to bear it as long as possible.”
“Add it to the list,” he said light-heartedly, just as Sherlock--apparently listening to the conversation--piped in that he would only use it if it had dinosaurs.
“His clothing choices are quite dark for a reason,” Mycroft smirked.  “You must have noticed the man can never be bothered to care for himself.  He goes days without food or sleep, and he’s always been loathe to use the loo.  That’s nothing out of character for Sherlock, even outside of headspace.”
He had exhausted the patience of the men in the front seat by asking that same question far too many times in the space of fifteen minutes.  Sherlock huffed to signal his distress to the men in the front seat and then let his head fall back against the headrest.
Your comments and kudos from the last two chapters were all so amazingly sweet and of course encouraged me to keep writing as soon as I could (which ended up being while I had some time on a bus ride).  I don't have time right this moment to respond to them (I'm still traveling), but I promise I will in the next day or two!
“I know you’re not feeling well, kiddo,” Daddy said.  “But that doesn’t mean we ignore the rules and act disrespectfully.  Do you understand?”
“What I’m
Also, a quick note that I've made minor edits to two previous chapters that probably nobody would notice but I'm mentioning anyway.  The super small one was just a nit-picky detail in Chapter 16 about pajamas, and the somewhat larger one was an edit to Chapter 13, where I felt in re-reading Mycroft's response to Sherlock that he was a bit too harsh, to the point of being out of character for this storyline.  I'm hoping now his reaction to Sherlock interrupting him is  simply poor-intentioned rather than cold-hearted.
This chapter is a mix of angst and fluff/cuteness.  It does contain discussion of and some depiction of depression in the first half (the Mycroft/Sherlock section), so take care with reading if that is triggering for you.  So many of you requested Sherlock slipping a bit younger in age, and it seemed to me that one way that might occur would be for him to be dealing with some angsty feelings.  This chapter has the beginnings of him slipping younger, and I'll continue to explore that in the next chapter or two.  It also has a good deal of discussion about wetting, which I know I use often--In the next few chapters, I'll try not to focus too much on that aspect as I have been, as I know it's not everyone's favorite thing.  I just find it so cute so I sometimes can't help but include it!
It was adorable; Mycroft had given their little bunny a forest wonderland and their little pirate an ocean adventure.  Greg smirked, vowing to tease his boyfriend for the lengths he’d gone to to make their boys happy just as soon as doing so didn’t have the potential to wake up their overtired child.
John had none of the desire for humiliation and insults which turned Sherlock into such a sloppy mess whenever he was holding his piss; the doctor was quite the opposite.  Watching John’s behaviors in headspace had allowed Sherlock to understand that it was praise John craved, a salve for his insecurities and a reprieve from his constant humility.
Sherlock crossed his arms and glared at Mycroft.  He would not let them spank him.  He placed his hand over the buckle of the seatbelt and lodged his feet into either side of the passenger seat. If they were going to force him to move, Sherlock would ensure they would not have an easy time of it.
John nodded.
Mycroft contemplated the picture the two of them made on the bed.  Was it possible John was already feeling young again, that things with Sherlock had gone well enough to allow John the peace of mind he needed to slip down in headspace once more?  It wouldn’t be entirely out of the question.  After all, they had come to the lake house with the intention of keeping the boys young for the entire long weekend.  It was only Friday morning now, and it was feasible that John, after having set things right with Sherlock, was eager to return to extended little time.
Papa found a new pacifier in the top drawer--Daddy must have bought a few new ones for Bunny and Sherlock--and slipped it between Bunny’s lips.  The boy latched on immediately, desperate for the comfort.
John and Sherlock had never had been in a fight like this while they were little.  Sherlock teased and made fun and they bickered about whose turn it was to play with a toy, but it had always been Sherlock who instigated and caused trouble, Sherlock whose actions needed to be accounted for.  Bunny was the one who had practice forgiving freely.  Now, he was in the unfamiliar position of needing to be forgiven, and it felt lonely waiting for Sherlock to come around and stop being angry.
Bunny felt her cheeks pink.  She hadn’t been the best behaved child that morning, and she hoped Papa wouldn’t be disappointed.
“I can’t promise not to be jealous,” Sherlock explained, and John nodded.  He would have been shocked if little Sherlock had behaved anyway else towards Bunny after learning what he had about Daddy Mycroft.
“I’m not hungry, Mycroft,” Sherlock said, glancing up towards his brother, who was tearing lettuce for the sandwiches.
“Besides,” Sherlock said after a moment.  He smirked and looked down at John with mischievousness.  “I wouldn’t take ageplay away from you just as you’re coming to terms with your own propensity for pissing yourself.”
Sherlock was placing a piece and then glancing around himself, skirting his fingers along the carpet.  He looked distraught as he bent to peer beneath John’s armchair, then spun on his knees to turn up the edge of the rug.  John took in the man’s actions with a bit of confusion, yet registered with a bit of a smile that Sherlock’s actions were less calculated--more childlike--than an hour before.
“Oh,” the smaller man sniffled.  And then the Bunny did begin to cry, tears rolling down his cheeks which he attempted to wipe away with muddy fingers which only left streaks of dirt against his cheeks.
“It certainly doesn't appear that way from the state of your trousers,” John could not help but tease.  Mycroft knew John had been dealing with a misbehaving Sherlock all night.  The man had refused to settle down to sleep, had whined and cried when John tried to leave him, and had poked John awake, laughing and taking off running around the flat, whenever John had happened to fall asleep himself.
“This isn’t your fault,” he said at last.  “I should have spoken to Sherlock weeks ago.  He deserved that.”
Mycroft knew he and John had never discussed John’s desire to wet, but Mycroft and Greg had discussed the issue at length when Mycroft had arrived at Baker Street.  And it had become clear that both men could see the torment John was under regarding the issue.
“There’s a monster soldier under the bed,” Bunny whispered into Daddy’s ear between sniffling tears.  “Don’t let it snatch Sherlock, Daddy. Please, please!”
Sherlock sighed and passed the bowl to John, who managed to get it into the sink behind him without having to stare long at the disintegrating bits of cereal.  His stomach settled a bit when he was seated once more, and he wrapped his hands around the tea cup to ground himself.
“I’m not sure that I know at the moment,” John admitted.  “But no pull-ups, at least not right now.  I think it might happen again, that...that I might like it to, but I’m not sure.  I need some more time to process.”
“I have Willa if I need her,” he said quietly, attempting to play down the fact that he already needed the silly plush rabbit, that he’d been longing to have her in his arms all day and the dog had been a poor attempt of a substitute.  “Let’s go down and say goodnight to your parents.”
Daddy took both of Bunny’s hands in his own.
, Greg texted.
When John glanced up at last, it was with a hint of defiance Mycroft rarely saw from John, a look more little Sherlock than little Bunny, a look which had him taken aback and told Mycroft clearly that John--and, likely, Sherlock--was up to something.
Bunny couldn’t help it; he sat back on his heels and began to cry, hitching on his breath as he wailed over the destruction of his beautiful dolls and their colorful clothes.  Someone had ripped up all of his pretty paper dolls.  His Daddy and Papa came immediately into the room, asking what was wrong just as Sherlock, with flushed cheeks, fled past them and ran from the room.
“Goodnight, Mycroft,” Sherlock said, turning once more and grateful when his brother did nothing but wish him goodnight in return.
“He, ah...you...what?” John asked, computer screen forgotten.
Bunny looked up at Greg with concern, but Greg nodded with a slight smile, doing his best to reassure the boy that all was okay.
Mycroft stood, scooping up Bunny, and turned to Sherlock, who had been hovering just beyond the end of the bed.
“You don’t need to be a part of this, John,” Mycroft said.  “I can bring him to my place tomorrow morning and keep him with me until he’s well enough to function as an adult again.”
“Never, traitorous prisoner!” Sherlock cried, laughing maniacally as if it pleased him to see Bunny tied up.
He was helped out of the tub and wrapped into an oversized towel--mermaids again and John’s favorite of the colorful towels, although he would never admit it to Sherlock.  Mycroft, once again, must have told Lestrade which one to choose from the clean laundry that had been brought up by Mrs. Hudson, who, bless her heart, never seemed to question the rather telling items which often wound up in the boys’ laundry hampers.
I wanted to give you all a bit of an early Christmas present by way of a new chapter.  I'm still not feeling 100%, but it makes me feel better knowing there's a little bit of resolution currently for Bunny and Mycroft and that I can share some happiness with others!  It's unedited, so I apologize for any typos--I'll more than likely come back to tweak a few things soon but if I didn't get it up now it would probably be another day or two.
“It's okay.  Papa said we can buy lots and lots of new paper dolls,” Bunny said with a smile that wavered for a moment--more than likely when Bunny remembered why the new dolls were necessary--before settling once more.  “You can help me pick them out.  Maybe they’ll be even prettier than last time.”
Greg knew they could repeat a similar conversation now, that they’d play out a scene they’d rehearsed many times before and that John would be momentarily comforted.  But he’d been suspecting that the go-to statements were rather ineffective at altering the diatribe of hatred and disapproval that ran through John’s mind when he was feeling insecure.  He may be doing the boy a disservice by being so focused on moving away from discomfort.  Perhaps there were benefits to existing in the pain and shame; perhaps the only way out was through.
It was Sherlock, rubbing at an eye with one fist as he stood in the doorway connecting the boys’ bedrooms.  Bunny didn’t know how long Sherlock had been standing there watching, but he yelled at him to go back to bed.  What if the creature turned for Sherlock next?  Bunny was gasping and yelling as Mycroft attempted to calm him, and Sherlock, not understanding, began to cry, too.
Had they really not realized what was wrong with the Bunny?  Didn’t they see he wasn’t actually trying to be naughty?
Mycroft allowed himself to fall back against Greg’s solid strength for a welcomed moment, then pulled away and crossing back towards his desk.
The second man--bald and overweight--had a cackling, over-the-top laugh that set John’s teeth on edge, and John glared as Anderson crossed out of the bathroom to catalog a blood sample.
Bunny could not help but smile at the praise, snuggling close against Papa’s chest and reveling in the warmth of his embrace.  Papa had been supportive of Bunny from the beginning, from the very first moment he’d learned that Bunny had a penchant for paper dolls and unicorns.  Even so, this is what Bunny had been waiting for all morning: unequivocal acceptance and love from Papa, whom she had never had any cause to doubt when it came to this topic.
Sherlock whined in the back of his throat.
Papa chuckled.
He squirmed a bit in place and slipped his thumb into his mouth, shifting his eyes towards the door to watch in case anyone came in and he needed to pull it away quickly.  He didn’t want anyone to think he actually needed it.
They’d made it home without any further incident, John silent and seething with anger towards himself built not only out of the soaking wet state of his jeans but also out of the arousal he felt in spite of his displeasure.  He was disgusted with himself in more ways than one, and he’d let not only Sherlock, but Greg, see him squirm.
Mycroft placed a hand over the mouthpiece of the phone handset, his eyes widening at Sherlock’s impertinence as he pointed towards the doorway, clearly no longer willing to accommodate Sherlock’s cheekiness.
Despite the lack of pressing cases, Lestrade found himself wrapped up in minutiae which kept him busy at the station for far longer than he’d hoped.  His thoughts continuously drifted to Mycroft.  The man had texted rather than called, and Mycroft only texted when he was unable or unwilling to chat. It seemed clear Sherlock was not the only Holmes brothers using avoidance tactics to ignore his misgivings about the events of the day.  The childhood memory was not Sherlock's trauma alone.
“Sweetheart,” Uncle Greg tried, but Bunny was glancing up across the table at Mycroft, who was trying to keep Sherlock from peeling off the band-aids that had been placed on his hand after he'd gotten big and angry and had punched the window two days before.
At the moment, Papa’s voice was so calm and grounded that Sherlock found himself unable to do anything but obey.
“Twelve or eleven,” Sherlock mumbled from beneath the blankets, “maybe.”
Immediately Sherlock began to argue.
He was carried downstairs to the living room, where Bunny sat sniffling on Uncle Greg’s lap, pacifier in his mouth.  Sherlock felt a stab of guilt; Bunny must have been so upset that he was allowed his pacifier even though he had a sore tongue.  He felt shy and sad when Mycroft set him down, and tried to hide behind his brother.
John scoffed.
“You want to be potty training?” Mycroft said, putting to words exactly what John wanted.  “Is that what you want, baby?” he asked.
John nodded, turning to glance towards the living room, where Sherlock lay on the couch.  It was impossible to tell whether the man was asleep or not, but John imagined Sherlock more than likely had at least one ear open to their conversation.
John sighed, and Mycroft knew he would need to say the words that John, up to that point, hadn’t wanted to.
Sherlock nodded with such a relieved sigh that Mycroft almost felt remorse for prolonging the kid’s wait.  Then again, he had gained valuable information regarding his brother’s state of mind by questioning him, information that had been necessary to gather in order to know best how to help him move forward.
John, catching eyes once more with Sherlock, decided to give in to the man’s crooked grin.  He sighed, letting some of the tense rigidity of his shoulders slip away as he stood and crossed to his chair.  He lifted Sherlock’s coat from the cushion to free a spot for himself, and sat.
John appreciated timelines.  He could make it until dessert was served.  He just needed to smile and nod, to let the others talk.  Greg would be right by his side.  He would pull him away from it all if it got to be too much, would smooth over any mistakes John might make if he were to lose focus on the conversation at hand.
“Bunny?” he called as he walked back through the living room and then, after ensuring the boy was not hiding in any tucked-away places, into the hallway.  “Can you tell Daddy where you are so he knows you’re okay, buddy?”
With a small catch of breath in the back of his throat, he allowed himself to release a trickle of urine.  He stopped himself right away, however, the shock of the dribble soaking into his briefs jarring him into a slight gasp.
The wetness was warm as it trickled into the extra padding of his training pants, and for a moment it felt just as it did when Bunny peed into his pull-ups, fabric expanding between his legs.  But soon the terrycloth at his crotch could not contain the wetness, and he felt the pee streaming fast onto the carpet beneath him, spreading between his knees and along his bum, where he was sitting.
The boy seemed all too relieved to be lifted from the sink cabinet, peeled out of his soiled clothing, and helped into the warm bath.  Mycroft rolled up his shirtsleeves and made quick work of washing the lad, paying careful attention to his inner thighs and genitals in order to ensure he was as clean as possible after his little potty accident.
“But Sherlock’s mad,” Bunny wailed, inconsolable.  “He doesn’t like me anymore and he’ll never let me sleep in his bed or talk to me ever, ever again!”
“Sorry, kiddo,” Greg said, shrugging on the shirt and hurrying across the room to press a kiss to Sherlock’s temple as he buttoned it hurriedly.  “Not this time.”
“My!” Sherlock yelled, launching himself at his brother for a quick hug before extricating himself from Mycroft’s arms and returning to bouncing around the room.  “Uncle Greg said he’d read three books tonight!”
Wow, I definitely got myself into a bit of trouble by trying to update two stories at once.  The first 2 chapters of this story were already written when I started updating, but in the process of writing and editing chapter 3 and 4, there were some developments that came about which then changed the course of the events of "Weekend at the Lake."  I had to go edit Weekend a second time so that the narrative will work between this story and Weekend.
“Them?”
“To...to find him,” he said.
“He had a little accident just now,” Mycroft said, voice quiet to keep the boys from hearing.  “I think he's rather distressed by it because it seemed to catch him off guard.”
It was when they were nearly out of the doorway that Greg caught sight of the unicorn headband he had given Bunny before the debacle of Bunny leaving and the all-encompassing worry of potentially triggering Sherlock’s memory of Eurus and Victor Trevor.  Greg understood Mycroft’s worries regarding keeping Sherlock from the pain of the past, but, now that the danger of remembrance seemed to have dissipated for the moment, he wanted to ensure Bunny still felt comfortable expressing him or herself fully.
Hi, loves!
“American?” Mycroft prompted despite already knowing the man was not.
“The demons of our past,” Mycroft said with a sigh as he reached to loosen his tie and open his top button.
In regards to Mycroft's lies and Sherlock's lack of memory, I'm letting the series influence the writing--in TFP, Mycroft does not speak of Eurus until he is caught in the omission of truth by Sherlock and John ("someone convinced him that you wouldn't tell the truth unless you were actually wetting yourself"), and even in the telling of the backstory, he leaves out mention of Victor and perpetuates the myth that Redbeard is a dog (it is only Eurus who guides Sherlock to that remembrance).  Sherlock's forgetfulness when it comes to his sister/Victor is canon; I'm just exploring what it might look like if there was the potential for the secret to come out before it was absolutely necessary for it to be told.  I'm not setting out to change the events of the series within my writing, just to play around with the implications of them a bit.  All of that is to say: don't expect to see any sudden remembrances about Eurus--things will stay hidden for now :)
The impetus for Sherlock’s outburst suddenly became more than clear.  The boy was used to the shy, reserved little boy Bunny who worshipped Sherlock and allowed him to set all the rules of their ageplay world.  Little girl Bunny had showed up, confident and self-assured on a day Sherlock was feeling a bit younger than usual, and had gone about shifting their roles.
John gave a gruff thanks to the bartender when she placed a pint before him.
Sherlock huffed.
He didn't need anyone.
“I don’t gotta,” Sherlock mumbled, voice muffled as he pressed his face hard against his forearms.
“I’ll go get you a new pull-up, and I’ll help you change as soon as you want me to, okay?”
This chapter is a bit shorter than usual, but allowed me to explore the stubbornness of both Sherlock and John during their respective mornings.  The boys are certainly not making Mycroft or Greg's lives easy, lately, but cutesy, comforting fluff is always so much more satisfying after some angst and drama, don't you think?  I've already started the next chapter (Sherlock's portion is written, so now I'll just need to work on John's), so I'm hopeful it won't be another eon before the next chapter is posted!  Feel free to send suggestions--I'm feeling a bit out of my depth as I go about writing John and Greg at a crime scene, so they would be very much welcomed!
Sherlock nodded.
“Very happily adult as well, Mycroft,” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes.  “Despite what you may think, there are activities that John doesn’t actually need you for, brother mine.”
“Come on,” Greg said nodding his chin towards the opened door of the office.
Greg nodded, smiling as John gave in to Sherlock’s pleading and dove forward into the water with a laugh.
“Rough night?” Greg asked, lifting a searching gaze towards John as he settled a carton of eggs on the counter.
“Twenty swats,” Mycroft said.  “Five for each swear word.”
“Talk to me, My,” Greg said, taking the stool next to Mycroft.
As much as John wished he could slip down in age and play with an also young Sherlock, he knew that just wasn't how Sherlock operated after a case.  Sherlock rarely shifted down into headspace until at least a few days after a case had been finalized, wanting to process all the details and settle them into his mind palace while in his adult mind.  Even then, it was often only by encouragement or force from his brother or Lestrade that Sherlock slipped down, often fighting what they had all come to see that he needed.  Besides, John had never slipped into headspace without Sherlock, and a grumpy, post-case Sherlock was certainly not about to care for a young John.
Mycroft smiled.  He had begun reading the Harry Potter books to the boys before bedtime; neither had read them in their adult states, and the books enchanted them.
From anyone else, Greg may have read judgement into the statement.  From his brother, who dealt in honesty and bluntness as a default, however, he read only curiosity.
He held out the soiled pair of Sherlock’s trousers.  The blush on Sherlock’s cheeks was bright and immediate, but the man quickly hid it with a glare and a huff.
“What age does he regress to?” John asked at last.
When John was finished, he was overcome with a momentary relief that quickly settled into animosity.  He shouldn’t have had coffee, he shouldn’t have let Sherlock drag him around the entire day, and he shouldn’t have fucking pissed himself.  Without any forethought, he punched against the brick wall of the house with a quick, angry jab which left him grasping his hand in pain.
“And Sherlock?” Mycroft asked. He was impressed by John’s verbosity.  The man was clearly getting less self-conscious about expressing his needs and feelings as a little.  “He’ll tease.  Might be jealous of the attention.”
“I know,” Sherlock said, nodding.  He remembered the conversation he'd had with Mycroft after learning that he was Bunny's Daddy.  “That’s why Bunny’s my little brother but today he was my big brother and why you’re his Daddy but just my Mycroft.”
“Do you want your pacifier, bud?” John asked, smiling as he slipped into caretaker mode with the boy.
“Daddy misses his little boy, too.”
“Sherlock’s dog,” Mycroft said.
“Feeling small is not an excuse for brattiness,” Mycroft said.
John--yes, Mycroft was positive now that this was still a fully adult John in front of him--blushed beet red and shifted his gaze back to his feet.  Greg may have been oblivious to John’s state of mind--he was still holding the man to him as if he were his little Bunny instead of his adult friend--but Mycroft knew better than to be fooled by John’s show of littleness.
Sherlock woke up in Mycroft and Papa’s room, remembering Bunny’s nightmare in the middle of the night as the reason he wasn’t in his own bed.
“You alright?” Greg asked as they pulled into the parking lot of a motel outside London, and John blinked his eyes open and sat up straight once more.
“Seems like someone will be ready for a nap, today,” Uncle Greg said, and Sherlock could not even muster the energy to sit up and prove him wrong.
Sherlock simply shrugged, unconvinced.
“He never wins,” Sherlock said, and Bunny sighed a relieved, “good.”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock breathed at last.  “I didn’t mean to.”
The tensed muscles in John’s body began to relax a bit, and John’s countenance was a bit less downtrodden.
“Can we talk when I’m aged down?” John asked.
He felt the need to be a girl in the same way he had initially felt the need to be little, back when he was primarily a caregiver and Sherlock was little on his own.  But now there was so much more at stake, so much more to lose.  He had his Daddy and his Papa and his brother, and he was loved and cared for and a part of something.  He couldn’t stand the thought of his little family turning away from him.
Just before he fell asleep, however, John realized he had forgotten his blanket in the other room.  He turned with concern to Sherlock, tugging on the boy’s pajama top.   Sherlock groaned and tried to shoo him away, but when he realized that John was upset, he opened his eyes.  Bunny could see him attempt to piece together what might be wrong with his little brother.
In some part of his consciousness, Sherlock could sense that his bigger self wouldn't like Bunny's nightshirt or new pull-ups, that his bigger self would tease or dismiss.  And although the voice in the back of his mind--the voice he heard when he was a little bit older and didn’t need diapers or as many Mycroft cuddles--tried to make itself known, Sherlock couldn’t help but admire Bunny’s new nightshirt and the soft colors of his training pants.  He was littler than usual, and, for once, he didn't think there was anythign wrong about thinking that Bunny--mussed hair in need of cutting, dressed in a princess nightgown, and wearing a pink and purple pull-up--looked beautiful.
“It’s a good thing dinner will be here soon,” Greg said, setting about pouring a cup of tea for himself and for Mycroft.  “It’s looking like they could use an early bedtime, tonight.”
“Did Mycroft do a good job?” Greg asked.
Sherlock did not turn away from the television.
“He can safeword out if he needs to.  At this point, they need to trust that we know what’s best for them.  I won’t allow them to behave like miscreants, especially not while in public, where there are safety concerns involved.”
John had been careful to pay attention to his body throughout the evening, knowing that Mycroft had dressed him in big boy panties even though he had wet himself without realizing it earlier in the day.  He had been starting to feel less nervous about the accident because he’d made it to the loo whenever he needed it that night, and his undies were still dry.  He didn't need pull-ups.  John had worn a pull-up to bed the night Uncle Greg babysat, and it had made him feel safe then, but he was glad Mycroft had not asked him to wear one that first night at the lake house.  He needed to be a big boy.
It was a tactic he’d used all his life to press without appearing forceful, parroting Greg’s statements back to him without additional comment.
The next four arguments Mycroft had pre-planned for the conversation were immediately silenced, futile in the ghastly realities of Sherlock’s tendencies towards self-harm.  His face fell, shoulders releasing the tension they’d been holding in his earlier attempt to defend his actions with pomposity and pride.
“You need to go to timeout now, Bunny,” Mycroft said.
Mycroft sighed.  Perhaps Greg was right.  Perhaps he was letting his own hang-ups pepper his interpretation of the situation.  John had seemed genuinely pleased by the items Greg had purchased for him, proud to show them off.
“What hurts, baby?”
“Dont’ use your sleeve, lady bug,” Mycroft admonished, grateful when Greg intercepted and only mildly disgusted when the man used his own bare hand to wipe the kid’s nose.  “Are you feeling okay?”
Sherlock nodded and clambered into a chair on the other side of the table, his limbs always loose and awkward when he was fully regressed.  John whined when he was no longer being held in Mycroft’s arms, but he settled a bit when Mycroft sat next to him and patted his knee.
“Not too old for Dimitri, then,” he said, pulling the plush dinosaur from its place on the couch and placing it onto Sherlock’s lap as he brushed mussed hair out of his brother’s face.
“This is perfect, actually,” Greg said with the breath of a laugh as he reached for the Ariel cup.  “Thank you.”
Mycroft could not help but feel a swell of affection for the boy wanting him to help; Mycroft wished he had been there to help, too.
Sherlock climbed into the car and immediately folded himself up in the passenger seat, yawning as he rubbed at an eye.
“You don’t need that, bud.”  Mycroft said as he guided it away.
It was rather a relief, actually, the decision taken from his hands.
Sherlock pouted, his previous frenetic energy dissipating as he stepped from the stool and walked over to press himself against Mycroft’s chest.
Mycroft’s voice was kind but firm as he took Sherlock by the arm and began leading him out of the office.  The phone had begun ringing once more, and Mycroft sighed as he maneuvered Sherlock until he was outside of the office doorway once more.
Sherlock kicked and whined in the corner, clearly not liking Mycroft’s train of thought.
“That’s part of the chaos that is taking care of little Sherlock.  He’s not generally any set age.  He could start a day as eight and be five by dinnertime.  He needs the mental stimulation that keeps him from feeling self-conscious about regression.  If he’s not stimulated in some external way--going on a trip or solving a new puzzle--he needs a way to distract himself.  We've come across a few tactics that keep him aged down, and one of them is that he’ll shift in age to keep himself entertained.  I’ve personally seen him sink as young as a needy three year old and then shift to as old as a very petulant pre-teen, around twelve or thirteen.”
“No, Daddy,” he said, laughing, scrabbling his hands against Mycroft’s shirt as he tried to escape the man’s tickling.  “But I’m a boy ladybug.”
“I’ll, ah...yeah.  I’m going to take a shower,” John said, running a hand along the back of his neck before he began untangling himself from the sheets.
“And you’ll have an early bedtime tonight,” Greg explained.  “No arguments.  Do you understand?”
-Lestrade- it read.
“Sherlock, buddy, come say ‘goodnight’ to your little brother one more time,” Mycroft said.
“There’s nothing to apologize for, kiddo,” he said.  “Papa’s got you.  Everything’s alright.”
He could call for Daddy or Uncle Greg, but they were downstairs, and his voice might not carry over the storm.  Besides, they would coddle and worry and give him too much attention that would embarrass him.  Mycroft and Uncle Greg didn’t know the best way to help him with his nightmares because they weren’t usually the ones close-by when they happened.
He brushed the hair back from Sherlock’s face and, seeing the pirate pacifier on his nightstand, worked the boy’s thumb out from between his lips and substituted the pacifier, which Sherlock took eagerly.  The boy was clean, medicated, and back into a dry bed, and it hadn’t taken longer than 20 minutes or so.  Greg walked across the room to turn off the desk lamp, grateful that all was well and that he could get back to bed himself.
“Whales are placental marine mammals,” Sherlock began.
Daddy stepped back into the room with a relieved sigh.
And then there were tears, the kid sniffling and then breaking down, caught in some spiral of emotion that had finally caught him off-guard.  Greg quickly made his way into a parking lot, grateful they had not yet made their way onto the highway.
“Mycroft is certainly a bit of a mystery,” John said, caught in a laugh as he tracked the blush spreading across Greg’s cheeks.
There was a hole where a tree branch had long ago damaged the roof, so the snow was falling from the ceiling, leaving a white patch in a streak across the floorboards.  John watched it falling through the criss-crossed tree branches high overhead.
“Missed you, Daddy,” he mumbled, opening his mouth to accept the pacifier pressed against his lips even as he knuckled at tired eyes.
Greg was processing, waiting to see if Mycroft had more to say, when they were interrupted by crying as a teary-eyed Sherlock plodded into the kitchen on bare feet.  Greg got up and crossed to Sherlock, wanting to keep Mycroft from having to tackle any additional issues in the midst of his own emotional turmoil.
“So you don’t...mind?”
Mycroft snorted into his pillow, and Greg could not help but kick his boyfriend under the covers.  He didn’t need to be given Mycroft’s
When he had no luck in the pharmacy aisle, he made his way back towards the toy section, glancing down each aisle in turn while attempting to calm his fraying nerves.  He should never have taken his eye off him; he should never have let go of his hand.
“Come on,” Greg said, “it's Christmas.”
I hope you're all doing well--sending bunny kisses! xoxo
“Promise,” he said.
“Sherlock, I’m sorry,” John said once Mycroft and Greg had left them alone in the kitchen.  “Not telling you was…”
He followed Mycroft to the loo, waited patiently beside him as the man fiddled with tub taps until the temperature was right, then allowed himself to be led back into his bedroom while Mycroft found some of his least childish clothing: soft grey joggers and a white t-shirt.  He was relieved that Mycroft hadn’t left him alone in the loo.  Whether adult or child, flashback nightmares left him reeling, afraid of his own mind.
He was pleased when Mycroft smiled and leaned in to kiss him.  At least they were in this together for their boys.
“A deaf earwig,” John said, and Sherlock dissolved into giggles.
The timing of Sherlock’s looming regression could not have been worse.  Sherlock had made strides in headspace by letting Greg and John in on the equation, but he wasn’t about to welcome other observers, least of all the Holmes brothers’ rather conservative parents.
“Precisely,” Sherlock said, but his gaze was far off, contemplative.
“Let’s see if we can’t find something to cheer up my sick little boys,” Daddy said, flipping channels to find something kid-appropriate.
“You’re not spending Christmas alone in that flat, John.  I happen to know it hasn’t been tidied since the first case in this string of five, and I’m rather not spend my Christmas picturing you eating leftover takeaway among the dirty socks and unwashed dishes, thank you very much, Dr. Watson.”
It was part of the nighttime routine: bath, teeth brushing, last pee before pull-up, and lights out.
“Mycroft?” he asked.
Mycroft lifted the man and carried him to the bedroom he shared with Sherlock when the men were little.  Sherlock was asleep, limbs askance and sheets and blankets twisted around.  Mycroft settled John into bed next to Sherlock and tucked him in beneath his butterfly comforter.
On the night they had first played the game, John had been too tired and frustrated to do anything but include the first ridiculous thought that had come into his mind when Sherlock prompted him to fill in the gaps of the story’s narrative.  Luckily, Sherlock had been too entertained to notice the snarkiness in John’s voice, and soon found the entire ordeal was great fun.  It turned out that John’s random lists of items made for hilarious images and conflicts.  It had been a double-edged sword for John; the game had finally put Sherlock to bed on that first night after a long ordeal, but Sherlock began asking to play the story game every single time John put him to bed from that point forward.
“Don’t want that!” Sherlock yelled when he saw the cereal boxes in Mycroft’s arms.  His loud shout had startled the Bunny, who whipped his head around and blinked up at Sherlock as he sneered towards the breakfast options with disgust.
“Hi, Bunny,” he said when he had taken in John’s current state.  “Are you okay?”
“I have to potty, Uncle Greg,” John said, liking the feel of the word in his mouth, wanting to use it more.  He pressed a hand between his legs just to play the part, just to be the little boy still learning.
He didn’t need Mycroft or his fucking coddling, and he didn’t need Greg to take him to work like some damn little kid.
“So, about that praise kink…” Sherlock said before both men had even had time to catch their breath.
“That’s enough,” Greg said with a chuckle when John continued to brush vigorously far longer than was necessary.  “Good boy.  Now, spit.”
“I didn’t realize you two had become such old biddies,” Sherlock said to break the tension once he was alone with Mycroft, unable to keep from teasing about their choice of rainy day activity.
Hi, loves!  Sorry for the delay in updating--I had a few different ideas for how this chapter would go so it took a bit longer to make decisions and get it all down into writing.  Not to mention I'm in a bit of a transition time in my own life so there's been a bit of chaos.  Thanks for the support you've all already shown about this new storyline!
“No,” he said, then continued walking in the direction he had been stomping.
“Of course not,” he said.
“I’ll take care of that, Greg,” John said, bashful in his embarrassment.  It was rare that John had to deal with any aspect of wetting while adult; he found himself feeling exceedingly vulnerable as he watched another man wipe up his pee.
There was concern in his voice when he spoke to Greg on the phone while he was driven to his apartment.  Greg was still at the precinct, finalizing paperwork and dealing with media inquiries now that the case was over that would keep him busy late into the night.
“There’s been another murder,” he said, “Sorry boys.”
John continued: “But each time I decided to hold it, I fell deeper into headspace.  And there was a bit of a, a thrill, I guess, to knowing I was holding it when I should be asking for the bathroom, to just wait to see if someone adult would notice.  I felt so young and helpless.  And when I felt myself going in my pants, there was shock and the fear but there was also relief and...oh god...warmth.  I felt the furthest from my adult self I think I ever have.”
“You mean to tell me you can’t be my ladybug when you’re a boy?” he asked, teasing.
“Your Daddy and Papa have known for a while now that you may want to be a girl,” Papa continued, still rubbing Bunny’s knee.  “We’re very glad you felt comfortable enough to finally tell us that today.  But this is a big change, and now your Daddy has to find the right way to explain that big change to Sherlock.  He needs to make sure Sherlock knows what good news this is for all of us.”
Greg shifted the boy until he was sitting on his knee.
“All set?” Greg asked when John joined him back in the car, where he was waiting in the driver’s seat once more.
“Greg’s making breakfast,” Mycroft said.  “Meet us in the kitchen when you're ready?”
“Painfully desperate for your approval,” Mycroft mused as he lay down his knife to cross to the fridge.  “A trend among your subordinates.”
“I’m sorry,” he called, jaw clenched from pain.  “I won’t do it again.  Please, My.”
Mycroft sat up a bit straighter and glanced across the couch towards Uncle Greg, who was absent-mindedly running his fingers along a sleepy Bunny’s spine.
John ignored the text, contemplating calling Harry for a third time before deciding to give it another five minutes. He knew from experience that Harry had never been adept at arriving places on time.
There was a part of Mycroft that wanted to call off the entire trip in favor of taking Sherlock back to his flat to coddle him and show him that he could behave just as young as he needed to, to intercept John before he caught his flight and convince Greg to beg off of his Christmas party so he could help Mycroft bundle the boys in red and green pajamas and give them warm milk and watch them open presents and bake cookies for Santa.
“It'll be alright, Myc,” he said, eyes flicking to Sherlock’s closed door.  “He just need to know you’re there for him.”
“He knows something’s wrong,” Greg explained with a sigh as he stepped up behind Mycroft, who was washing lunch dishes at the kitchen sink.  “Asked if we could stay if he was ‘just a boy tonight.’”
“Daddy?” he asked, suddenly reminded of the last conversation he’d had when alone with Mycroft, when he had hid in his room to cry after going to the store with Uncle Greg.  “‘member when you called me ‘baby’? After I was crying before?”
, for one-shots or to share a cup of coffee :)
With a huff, Sherlock obeyed, allowing Greg to lead him towards the stairs.  But when they made it to the kitchen table, Sherlock suddenly climbed up onto his chair and held his arms out to Greg, signalling that he wanted to be carried.  And as he was lifted into the Detective Inspector’s arms, he glanced over Greg’s shoulder at Mycroft, gaze pointed and unwavering.
“I’m sure there will be days it might suit you to do so,” Sherlock rambled on, a bit thoughtfully, as if coming to additional conclusions in the process of launching into a full analysis of John’s mental state.  “But it will be for convenience or needed attention more than to quell a driving need.  I doubt it will become any sort of default, but whatever the future case may be, your actions yesterday are perfectly rooted in the psychology of childhood experiences and impulses, and there’s no need for you to feel such embarrassment or shame regarding them.”
John was torn between admitting he was confused about calling Mycroft “Daddy” and admitting he felt as if he wanted to wet himself all the time.  But, if he were honest with himself, he was more embarrassed than confused about wanting Mycroft to be a father figure to him while he was in headspace.  Their relationship had been quickly developing in such a way since John had begun slipping down in age.  He was not confused about why his younger self considered Mycroft his Daddy.   The man cared for him and made him feel safer than perhaps any human being other than his own parents ever had.  He accepted and comforted and was there for John when no one else was.
“You don’t ever have to hide who you are, baby,” Papa told her, wiping her face free of the tears she had not managed to keep from spilling down her cheeks.  “Your Daddy and I want you and Sherlock to be just as happy as you can be.”
“Sherlock, I have to go,” Bunny said when he couldn’t stand it any longer. His voice was quiet, cheeks pinking beneath the tear-stains.  He squeezed his thighs together and wiggled in place.  He knew Sherlock had noticed his problem long minutes ago, had chosen to ignore it.  Sherlock himself had to go too, Bunny could tell.  He’d squeezed between his legs a time or two while they played.  But Sherlock could hold it longer than Bunny could, he had more practice at it, which only made Bunny feel littler.
Bunny turned his head from where he had been watching as his Daddy held the baby bottle to Sherlock’s lips, letting the boy latch on as he leaned his head against Mycroft’s chest.  It didn’t make sense.
John hadn’t even known he’d had to go until that moment, and he’d already partially wet himself.  When had it happened?  He had gone to the loo only a few hours ago, at the rest stop.  The fact that he had started to wet himself sometime between then and now without realizing it made his chest clench and his head pound with a panicky fear.  This was not like the times he had known he was going to wet himself, like at the zoo, or the times he had chosen to wet himself, like the night with Greg or the morning after with Mycroft.  He had wet himself without realizing it, and that was something he had not experienced since childhood.  He wanted to hold himself, wanted to tell Mycroft he needed the loo or he was going to soak his pants as well as the pull-up, but he couldn’t speak.
“No one was exactly prepared for this,” John said, walking back towards the windows.
“Whoops, this one’s sprung a leak,” Sherlock heard Uncle Greg say, and he turned, bleary-eyed, to see that Bunny was wetting what must have been an already wet pull-up, which was now leaking onto the bathroom floor.
Bunny was naked a moment later, his Daddy having torn the sides of the pull-up.  There were baby wipes on the top of his dresser, and he was soon wiped down and patted dry with a towel, then re-dressed in a new pull-up, this one with flowers.  Bunny whined and pointed to his nightshirt, and soon he was once again dry and clean and happy.  His Daddy lifted him into his arms.
