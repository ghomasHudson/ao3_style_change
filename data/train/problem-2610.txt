Cas captured his lips again but before the kiss could get too heated the two policemen came in to start their interview with Dean and Cas left.
Castiel let out his breath in relieve. He didn’t know why it was important for him that Deans father liked him, but it was.
He had to see with his own eyes that Cas was fine. Within an inch, Dean was about to lose the most important person in his life! His heart skipped a beat when he realized that Cas really was the most important person in his life, next to Sam of course. Lisa wasn't even close! If Dean was honest with himself, he had to admit that he could easily imagine a life without her, but never without Cas.
The doctor raised an eyebrow because of Deans outburst, but he didn’t care. The thought of touching another Omega than Cas made him feel sick.
The first time on this unfortunate morning Cas saw the Alpha smiling. And a little bit of hope was shown on his face.
“You mean… you never… I am your first…?” Cas knew he was babbling but Jesus Christ! The thought that his soulmate never slept with anyone filled him with so much joy.
Dean put in a second finger and then a third. He pushed them in and out faster and deeper. Sometimes even so deep that he touched Cas's prostate. The noises Cas made every time, went directly to Deans cock.
Dean decided to visit Benny first. His best friend lived on the fourth floor. He shared the room with Gabriel Novak, a small and rather naughty beta. Gabe was a year above him but they had one class together. He was a funny guy with an addiction to sweets and a love live similar to Deans. Maybe that's why they got along so well. Gabriel was certainly someone with whom you could have a lot of fun. Only then did Dean realize that he had the same last name as his new roommate. Maybe they were related. About two minutes later Benny was flinging his arms around Dean.
During dinner, Dean was remarkably quiet, but no one dared to ask him why because everyone could imagine what was on his mind. Even if there was a reason to hope, they didn’t know if it really worked.   They all knew that there still was no certainty now. According to Sam's research, there were enough cases in which a full rejection could only be partially reversed.
"Mom told me today that Mr Novak never planned to reject his soulmate. He didn't tell me the details because she promised him not to tell anybody, but she was sure he wants to be with his soulmate. Damn it! What am I supposed to do now?"
Dean moved his hand down to Castiel's jeans and unzipped and unbuttoned them. Pulling his dick out through the slit in his boxers, the Winchester licked at the tip, and he decided then and there it had been a pretty great vacation.
"Don't be a drama queen," he responded, stretching his arms up high and yawning. "Didn't even throw it that hard." Looking around, Sam brushed past his brother and picked something off the stable floor. It was his old baseball, red stitching still intact but a light brown creeping over what was once a bright ivory color. He tossed it into the air and snatched it on its way down. "I was standing right behind you and yelled your name exactly six times, and you didn't hear me. Mom said the storm is starting soon, you gotta come in now."
His uncles' faces both turned red. "Your mom has something to tell you, she's in the living room," Dean mumbled. Cas backed up and headed into the hallway, still carrying Dean.
"Hey, there's a rest stop," Gabriel interjected. "One more mile. Stop there and I'll repeat your whole spiel to him. You need to stretch your legs. Then maybe I could drive the rest of the way."
A third finger joined the other two, and Cas slowly fucked the them in and out of Dean's hole. Another whine escaped the man's lips.
"Wait a sec, doc," his dad interrupted. "Hold that thought. Gotta drop the kids off at the pool, if you catch my drift."
Kelly sighed. "My mom keeps trying to set me up with a guy. I hate it, so Cas is pretending to be my boyfriend so she'll leave me alone."
The conversation turned toward Dean's job, and Castiel actually remembered this time, specifically his co-worker's and Castiel's boss, which shifted into Cas complaining about annoying gym rats he's had to deal with.
Benny smiled and handed the box to Jack. "A present. For your birthday next month. No way could I wait."
His cousin was on the couch, tapping away on her phone.  Some Ryan Reynolds movie was playing quietly on the TV.
He could just feel his dad roll his eyes. "Whatever. Be careful out here. There are all kinds of murderous creatures out here."
She put her hands on her hips, letting her suitcase fall to the floor. "That's a fine how do you do. I haven't seen you in six months and this is the greeting I get?"
Castiel ticked a finger for each response. "I'm moving in, I will be living here, got evicted, while you were working, I have a key, Sam told me. Any more questions?"
After everyone ate, the kids all moved to the basement while the adults gathered in the living room to do whatever it was adults at dinner parties do.
Pink blossomed on his skin, and he rubbed the back of his neck with the hand holding the knife, and Dean had to stop himself from the snatching it away. "She, uhm, asked me about our... relationship."
"How long did you teach English for?" Gabe gave his brother a subtle wink as he set a plate down on the long mahogany table.
The sheriff jumped out of the coach after pushing Alastair onto one of the benches inside and leaving him Deputy Talley. She headed oved to Dean, thumbs hooked in her belt and grinning.
Dean rubbed the back of neck. "I kind of like having you here. Even if I wasn't consulted when you first moved in."
Castiel dragged him onto his lap and started kissing him all over his face. "Is this better than getting tickled?" he asked, holding him tightly and preventing the boy from escaping.
"Yeah, man," his daddy replied, and sounded pleased so Miracle wagged his tail. "Pretty, smart, funny. She's great."
Benny slid onto the stool next to Dean and tapped his beer bottle. "Still workin' on your first one of the night, huh?"
The kids giggled as Castiel lifted Dean up, holding him in place by the back of his thighs. The Winchester wrapped his legs around Cas's waist and put his head on his shoulder. The snoring started again immediately.
Blinking open his eyes and squinting at the alarm clock, Dean was surpised to find himself actually rested. Reading the time, his eyes widened and he figured out why; it was past 12:30, which wouldn't be that big of a deal since it was the weekend, but Dean always set his alarms for 8 am on his days off so he wouldn't waste the day away. Castiel must have turned it off and let him sleep in.
Castiel leaned back in his seat, hugging Jack a little tighter. "I don't see what's so great about some thrice divorced B-list action star anyway. He isn't so special."
Eventually, he finished stretching. He picked up the bottle and opened it, putting his mouth over the top, tipping his head back and deepthroating it until the whole thing was empty. Dean walked over to the sidewalk and tossed the bottle into one of the trash cans and then put his blades on. With one last glance at Cas, he skated away.
"Dean," Cas tried out the name. He liked the way it sounded. "I think I'm in love." Grabbing the remote from the the TV stand, he plopped himself next to the seventeen-year-old.
Cas chased after him, up and down the streets, through people's front yards, and even in a stairwell of the building two blocks away.
In retrospect, Cas thought as he ran through the woods, this was probably a stupid idea. There had been plenty of opportunities for Castiel to take Dean home, but no, they had to go to the stupid party.
Jack shook his head. "Nuh-uh, Aunt Stevie! Cas and Dean were boyfriends! Coach Gabe and him would never date!"
Jack pulled at his fingers. "Oh. Okay. Sure... uhm. Hold on." He ran to his room, tiptoeing  past Dean and Cas's bedroom, and grabbed Luke and Mimikyu off his bed. He walked quickly back to the living room and turned off the TV. He hesitated at the light switch for a minute, but he saw Kevin turn on his phone's flashlight. He flipped the switch down and stumbled through the diim light to his sleeping bag. He noticed that Kevin had a Garfield plushie between his folded legs and Maggie was clutching a blue Yoshi to her chest.
"Hm. It does," Claire agreed. "Put it in the sink," she told Jack and put the syrup and ketchup on the counter. She dashed over to the door that led to the living room and pressed her ear against it.
They talked for so long that Jack was surprised when his grandparents came over to the table at 9 to take him to their house while his mom and Sam went away for their vacation.
Six empty beer bottles surrounded the empty Taco Bell bag on the floor, and the bottle in Jo's hand was half empty. The TV was on, loud as usual, playing The Open House on Netflix. Jo and Sam were laughing, making fun of the movie, leaning close to eachother on the couch. The comforter was bunched up behind them and a pillow between them was the only thing keeping the two from touching. Dean had dragged in a chair from the kitchen and sat, arm crossed, glaring at them, while Cas sat on the floor next him.
Cas chuckled and Dean closed his eyes and enjoyed the vibrations he felt. He listened to the steady thumping of the man's heart. Cas started running his hand through Dean's hair.
Miracle jumped in the air. -Great! I have an idea.-  He bent down so his front was on the grass, butt in the air. -Climb on top of me and hold on.-
Dean twisted around to glare at his cousin. She had airpods in and was staring at her phone, probably watching a cartoon.
The college student blinked. He knew that voice. Without slowing down he looked for the source and found Dean running up to him from his right.
"Hey, stranger," Dean said happily, coming in and greeting Castiel with a light kiss. "Smells delicious."
"No," Dean heard his mother answer when Jo was finished. He looked up and saw her at the window a few feet away. "Everything will be okay. That's not even a real torn- uhm... it's fine, okay? Don't panic."
"Stay away from my kitkats," Dean said from the doorway. "Get your own. Cas what the hell is going on?"
With the first floor air conditioner broken, the summer heat creeped in from the outside and battled with the wind from the small fan at the counter.
"Roller derby. You should come watch... we, uhm, have a game tomorrow." That pretty blush blossomed on his cheeks. "Y'know, if you want."
"They use to, Grandma!" He licked a strip maple syrup off his arm. "It's true! I think they should be boyfriends again. So does my mommy."
The waitress came over then, and as she introduced herself she gave Cas and his suit an odd look, but she didn't comment. Cas told her they were ready to order and Dean ordered a beer with his burger and fries, and he gave Cas a smug look when he was finished.
When he was done cleaning Dean up, he put the cloth back in the e bathroom and walked quickly to his duffelbag, where he pulled out two packs of peanut butter crackers. He sat next to Dean on the bed and handed him one of the packs and a water.
The whole time they had eaten their ice cream, Dean worried Cas would bring up that the Winchester had gone through the lazy river three times, and then he would have to quickly come up with a lie. He couldn't admit he did that just to get a glimpse of Cas at his lifeguard station.
"I was so bad you thought you had to pretend to be in a relationship with a homosexual? Not that you aren't a lovely man Castiel, but Kells, why didn't you ever tell me I was being obnoxious?"
"Y-yeah. All right." Den stood and demanded Sam take a seat while he went and got the plate with the candle on it. Cas had blown it out and it had to be relit.
The Winchester pulled away and Castiel yanked his hands out of his trunks. Standing next to the tub was the blurry shape of Dean's father.
Dean made an annoyed grunting noise. "I did no such thing. I put them in my pocket and flushed them down the toilet."
"Would you look at that," Castiel smiled at the sight, "doing the right thing despite your bad example."
When someone, sometime later, banged on the door, Castiel growled at them to fuck off. The guy banged again, making the lock rattle.
Finally, the door swung open and the bucket flipped upside down, kept in place by the tape and string.
"Alright, well. I don't believe you. Besides, she's not in the best place right now, emotionally. Stay away from her. If necessary, I will stand here all night."
At their home, after they had cleaned Claire and put her and her brother into clean pajamas, they all sat in the living room with pancakes Dean had baked. The kids were sitting on the floor watching some cartoon, and Castiel was on the couch, Dean snuggled up close to him.
Grabbing some clothes from his bag, his toiletry kit, and a towel from the hallway closet, Cas went to take a shower. The hot water pulsed against his skin, and he used his own soap and washrag to clean himself. As he rubbed the shampoo into his hair, he spotted a little gray spider crawling up the wall, fast on its' eight little legs. He grinned, remembering how many times Dean had screamed over a bug.
Miracle's eyes moved between them as they spoke. His daddy shook his head. "I thought he'd be, like, embarrassed or something. Plus, I am pretty sure I know what the problem is."
Castiel rolled his eyes and hefted his boyfriend back up. "Yes, you will. It'll be good for you. Family bonding time."
Dean sat up and spun around to find Castiel standing there, green trunks on. He smiled at him. "Hey, Cas."
Maggie ended up winning the first round, much to Jack and Kevin's chagrin.  She jumped up from her position after Cas fell from trying to get his left foot from yellow to blue.
Dean pinched the bridge of his nose. "I- y-" He sighed. "Jus- Okay. Look." Dean covered the hand Cas had on his thigh. "I love you, Cas, and I am seriously concerned about you. So, I really think that right now you should shower, change, and then get to bed."
Laughing, Cas threw his coat over the both of them and they started running in the direction of a gazebo nearby. Dean nearly tripped over a rock on the way and he stopped briefly to kick it to the side.
The man yawned again and waved at the college student. He sniffed the air. "What's all the goodness I smell?"
"No! No, please. I'm really sorry. " Castiel stood up, showing off his orange speedo. "Look I'll take mine off, 'kay?"
The body and the noose were taken down and the guards quickly set up for the next prisoner, and on it went. The noose was always changed to a new one, knotted for the height and weight of the damned person.
Still clad in his scrubs, Cas plopped himself on the armchair with the tupperware container full of the leftover treats.
He put them in the vase and put it on the windowsill next to terrace door. They looked pretty, something nice and bright in contrast to the dull beige walls that surrounded his apartment.
Cas tsked at his friend and poured a packet of dressing onto his salad. "You had one for dinner last night. Don't you ever get tired of them?"
Dean must have heard him because he wrapped an arm around Jack's shoulder, pulled him close, and planted a wet kiss on his temple. The boy gagged at the feeling of his uncle's lips suctioning his skin and the sticky maple syrup covered spit that was left behind.
"Ah," Dean moaned. Finally, Castiel pulled his hand out and shoved his into him, and the younger man bit his lip to keep quiet. Balls rested against his ass, and he shut his eyes, listening to Cas breathing. "M-move. Please."
"No," Cas replied, giving Dean a glare. He had slipped on his rainbow boxers and a black T-shirt. "Dean threw out the instructions to the waffle maker and insisted on figuring it out himself."
They were both quiet on the ride in the elevator, which arrived quickly but moved up to the eighth floor at a snail's pace. Cas took a right and Dean got a good view at the ugly yellow linoleum. He heard the jingling of a key in the lock and they were finally in his dark apartment.
"Well, I... I don't know." Him and the angel had only leveled up from friends to whatever they were now three months ago, and Dean still felt a little terrified about being with someone guy shaped that he liked so much. "I guess so? Maybe. I haven't asked him." Clearing his throat, he got up to run water on a balled up paper towel under the sink. "Clean your face, you have a Spaghetti-O in your eyebrow."
Both sets of parents "awed", while Cas kept his focus on his sister. Dean could see the pink in his cheeks.
Dean had been hesitant first, worrying about hurting his parents' feelings, but Cas was able to convince him it would be best for their hypothetical baby's development for one of them to be the person watching them for the first few years of their life.
Castiel gestured at the two of them. "Us. This. I..." From the heart, he thought. "Dean, you are my best friend. And I both hate and love that."
He tried to swallow the lump in his throat. It had been six weeks and he still felt that pang in his chest everytime he saw her. They parted as friends and Dean claimed he was over her, but he knew that wasn't completely true. This vacation certainly didn't help him forget her.
The sliding door opened again, and in walked Dean. Cas took a moment to check the high schooler out; tight red trunks and a black tank top.
"Oh, Dean. Hi," his friend greeted, dropping two heavy looking paper bags onto the counter. He unbuttoned his coat and tossed it onto the kitchen table. "I felt really bad about eating your food, so I bought you this." He pulled out a large box and presented it. "90 bagel bites! And I won't eat a single one. Unless I ask and you give the 'okay'." He started humming as he put away the other groceries he bought.
Jack pushed the head guard as hard as he could and the man stumbled and fell. He ran and snatched the rope. He grabbed the looped part and pulled it, using his dagger to quickly cut above the first knot.
Steam was coming out of a frying pan in the sink, and Dean was standing at the open window, flapping a towel in the breeze.
"Yes!" Dean cleared his throat. "I mean yes. Ju- I.... uhm. Hold on." He checked the pockets of his jeans and the one on the front of his plaid shirt. "Oh. Uh. I guess not. I might've no- I didn't drive, n-not really. I turned the heater on. But I don't know if I actually have my... my, wh-what is that thing you put your license an-and cards in?"
Cas sighed and shook his head. He was thinking about Dean; the day before, the two had spent the whole day together. They had ice cream and pizza and when Castiel told Dean his dad was a writer on Dr. Sexy, MD, and that he'd never actually seen it, Dean forced Cas to watch it and peppered him with questions.
The phone fumbled in his slightly damp hands and he nearly dropped it in his haste to answer it. "What's wrong? What happened? Are you okay?"
The prisoner shrugged. "You guys have no sense of humor." She sounded like she was from Rabbit's Foot Island.
Castiel flared his nostrils. "You do! If it's not Claire with her fake cockroaches or Jack stacking up the hymnals, it's you making fart noises everytime Reverend Myers moves."
"Oh. I get it. Very cute." He eyed the half-eaten cookie and empty yoohoo on the table. "Are you on a, uhm, date?"
It had been five days since he was left at the park. When they had first arrived at his apartment, Dean ran over and lifted him up in a crushing hug, apologizing and covering him with kisses. Sam had had to pry his arms off Jack. For dinner his mom heated up a box of French fries and Dean gave him an angel food cake he bought at the corner store. After he had eaten, he called Kevin, who tearfully apologized for leaving him behind. Jack had told him it was okay, and that he was forgiven, which got the other boy to calm down.
"Okay, okay," Kelly said, laughing. She lifted her son up from behind. "Let's leave the lovebirds alone. You guys need to lock your front door, anybody can just walk right in."
Flaring his nostrils, Dean said, "I thought we were going to some kind of drive-in breakfast movie thing. I was too tired to ask anyway. You threw us in the car pretty late last night."
"Watch the road," Cas hissed, eyes flicking between his husband and son. "And keep your voice down, you'll wake the angel."
"You'd make a cute chef," Castiel, leaning against the sink, commented as Dean hunted around for the ingredients.
It would've been his and Dean's third Christmas together. It had been nice to be around the large Winchester family the past two years, baking cookies and having snowball fights. Him and Gabe hadn't celebrated the holiday together since Castiel was a teenager, and Dean's family was borderline obssesed. The last two Decembers were the only times Cas had celebrated the holiday as an adult.
"Well that was interesting," Dean declared. "Hope they have fun." He held his hand out and Cas took it, smiling and feeling nervous. Castiel let his boyfriend lead him to their room.
They signed 'Merry Christmas' to him, and Castiel signed back 'Thank you'. The kids took off and Eileen joined Sam.
Jack turned around to face his uncles. "What are your guys's fav- ew!" His friends whipped their heads around. "Every time I look at you two, you're being gross!"
His brother gave him a look. "I was able to figure that out." Reaching his hand out toward the elderly man, he hesitated.
"I... I'll be right back," he mumbled. Castiel went to the front door and shoved his sneakers on and headed outside. Dean was leaning against the hood of his Impala, the shiny black car parked right in front of the house. He was wearing the green military jacket that Cas thought brought out his eyes. Cas made his way over, his gaze fixed on his ex's face. "What are you doing here?" Cas had to look up, because Dean was wearing his boots with the heels that gifted him a couple of inches.
Cas's lips felt soft against his own, and he pushed down a moan that threatened to escape his throat. He slid one hand against Castiel's cheek and the other he buried in the older man's thick damp hair.
"Yes. And if you need to know all my plans, I want to finish this chapter before I get in." He blew a raspberry at Dean turned back to his book.
"We can get some sandwiches and snacks for the movie," Jack suggested. "They don't care if we bring food in. My friends, Max and Eliot, work there and sometimes they just eat like, pizza or soup right at counter."
Castiel took it and nodded. He went over to the the blanket and sighed happily when he saw Dean's smile. Taking a seat right next to him, Cas opened the cooler.
"Kind of busy right now," Castiel pointed out, looking over his boyfriend's shoulder at the kids sitting on the carpet, chatting and chewing away.
"Oh," Cas whispered when he figured out what had happened. Immediately, he took of his suit jacket and handed it to Dean, who wrapped their crying and wet daughter in it.
He'd been late to work a handful of times because when he tried to get out of bed Cas had grabbed him and had him suck down his morning wood, and the few times he was close to being late was when Castiel fell back asleep before Dean finished and was able to make his escape.
Dean hugged Castiel from behind, his arms around the man's chest, pressing a light kiss to his neck.
After about another hour of tossing snow at each other and making angels on the ground, everyone went inside, shaking flakes off their bodies and hanging their coats up to dry. In the kitchen, Helen had a chocolate fudge Entenmann's cake and homemade lemon and white chocolate chip cookies ready on the table. Kelly's cousin, Asa, brought out a deck of cards and him, Gabe, Kelly, Deacon, and Lorraine played poker for awhile with pocket change, and everybody else piled into the living room to watch  The Nightmare Before Christmas at Jack's request.
Now, on Monday, while he was waiting for a fish to bite, he considered Cas's offer of joining him in his parents' hot tub. The idea made butterflies flap around in his stomach and his palms clammy. The mere thought of being naked around an incredibly hot guy he barely knew was nerve-racking.
"Damn it," he muttered. Taking care not to step in front of the others, he finally got to to the porch without further incident. He took a deep breath and walked around to the side of the chalet.
With a beer in one hand and the remote in the other, Dean stretched out on the couch and flipped on the TV. He took a sip and settled on a Law and Order marathon. Humming happily, he turned up the volume and settled more comfortably on the pillow.
On the way to his bed, Jack kicked his army men and scattered them across the carpet. He dove onto his bed and pulled the comforter over his head.
His clothes were thrown at the wall, and he yanked Castiel's briefs down so fast he thought he heard the elastic stretch. He stared briefly at the cigarette burns that dotted his thighs before looking away.Dean lied down, head on the pillow, while Cas got the lube and condom. The older man ripped the wrapper open and tossed it behind him before spreading the condom on his thick cock.
The thought of his sister being born made him feel anxious. Nerve racking thoughts would start to swirl around in his head, like  whether or not Sam would still have the time and energy to make him his special breakfast art on weekends after she was born. Or whether his mom would still sit with him and read a book on her phone while he watched Star Wars. Or if his family would still come to see him at his Taekwondo classes and soccer games. He really wanted his sister to be born as soon as possible so it would be over with and he would find how much his life would actually change.
Dean leaned back against Cas's front and rubbed his nose along the man's neck. He breathed in the scent of vanilla in the air and sighed happily.
"Do you think you can take more, Dean?" Cas whispered, low and husky into his ear. He had one hand on Dean's throat, the barest amount of pressure, and the other was pushing three fingers in and out of him.
"I guess he found another girl."  Personally, Dean didn't get why Sam always had luck with women. Yeah he was smart, but he was only cute in a little brother kind of way. "Attractive" is not a word he'd ever use to describe the giant. He kind of reminded Dean of his sister.
He shrugged. "It was a  long time ago. My step mom is pretty cool." He pointed to a another photo, one that looked like a family portait. "We took that last year, when Adam turned three. And that one is of my roller derby team."
Cas shook his head. "No. You could've really gotten hurt o-or lost for hours. I don't know what I would've done if something really b-bad happened. I am crazy-crazy about you a-"
Dean and Castiel ate the pizza leftover from lunch on the couch, which was Jack's old one. His mom had decided to get a new one and let them keep it; he could still see the tiny dark stains from his years of spilling juice and soda that decorated it.
Dean grumbled to himself and dropped next to Maggie, arms crossed. He let out a soft gasp when he saw Felix and slid a foot away from her.
"No, no," Gabriel said, waving his hand dismissively. "I agree. I wanted to cook up some real hamburgers. I tried to buy some beef at the store but Cas forced me not to."
The door to Dean's apartment was unlocked, so Castiel walked in and looked around. It was clean, for a change.
Castiel rubbed his temples. "Gabriel. You need to stop. Kelly will be here in a half hour." He snatched a dark green shirt out of his hands.
Castiel started massaging his shoulders. "This make you feel better?" And when Dean nodded, he moved behind him to get a better angle, digging deeper into his skin.
"I... that was..." he stood straighter.  "We weren't under the plant. We should probably do a repeat. And we would have to do it twice; once for before and the second because we'd be back under it."
The dog sneezed in reply and barked once. She flipped onto her back, tongue lolling out of her mouth and panting again, her dirty damp fur splayed around her. She desperately needed to be groomed. He grinned down at her. "Takin' the sun, huh?"
Dean had taken his nephew to the park and the two had played in the playground, chasing eachother, racing on the monkey bars, and swinging on the swingset. After about two hours they had started to feel hungry and went for a snack at Cafe Parfait. They planned on heading to Barnes and Noble when they were finished.
"It's fine, I guess." The rollerblader llifted the other can that had fallen. "Glad these were empty. My dad would have thrown a shit fit if anything spilled out."
Cas cut him off with a kiss, and Dean moaned. He grabbed the older man by the shoulders and pulled him closer. His cock was getting harder, pressing against his sweats. Castiel shoved his t shirt up, pinching his right nipple hard.
Jack heard Castiel speak as he flowed between the crowd, heading for the gallows. His voice was clear, not a hint of fear in it.
The dog galloped after it and had to do a short hunt in a cluster of bushes. Luckily, the other dogs didn't notice so he was able to simply grab it and trot back to his father. A man was standing behind the uncomfortable couch, his paws covering his daddy's eyes.
"I asked Cas if we could go there," Jack put in. "But he said it would be better to take a plane and he has to wait for the right time to ask Dean. He scared of flying."
Cas looked acoss the table at Kelly, worried. They probably should have discussed this type of stuff on the drive over.
"Everything. They grow a new bone when they hibernate, some can jump over twenty times their height, they drink water by absorbing it through their skin... oh, and a certain species of frog protects a tarantula's eggs, so the tarantuala protects it from predators. It's almost like the frog is its' pet."
"N-nothing," his friend, Hannah stuttered, stopping her scooter.  "Just, uh.... the helmet. I've never seen you..."
The school they played soccer in was a Catholic school, so every game had to start with a short prayer. As everyone recited the Hail Mary, Jack covered his mouth to hide his yawn from his coach, Gabriel.  Last night, he had woken up several times; Kevin and Maggie's stories of vampires and ghosts and demons had scared him. Every little noise he heard woke him up and he kept thinking he saw something in the shadows of the apartment. He had even almost fell asleep during breakfast.
Afterwards, the four took a long walk through the park nearby, Sam and Jo talking and laughing ahead of Dean and Cas, and at one point the two younger people decided to race. Dean had gotten a stitch in his side trying to catch up, and as he was doubled over breathing heavy, he felt Castiel rubbing his back soothingly.
"No one ever told me about it. And I haven't watched or read anything that talked about it." He poked at his food. "What do you do for it?"
He got a sympathetic smile in response, and Cas walked over and squeezed his shoulders, kissing his neck. "You'll do fine. I already told them all about you. They know how great you are."
Miracle was put down then and he ran up the small humans, sniffing them. The taller one put her arms around his neck and kissed him. The dog panted.
"Okay, okay. You wore me down." He put the coffee and sandwich on a nearby table and took his phone out. "What's your number?"
Claire cleared her throat. "Are you... okay?  You were quiet during dinner and you're kinda acting weird right now."
Dean nodded in response. "Probably be awkward for her to hang with him after that. I'll ask her about it later." He gave Cas a grin and his heart gave a flutter when it was returned.
"That sounds lucky to me." Dean leaned forawrd and kissed him, and when it started to get a little heated, Cas pulled away. "Uhm, Greek yogurt."
The next morning, just as Cas was about to sit down, Dean walked into the kitchen, Miracle at his heels. She planted herself right next to Jack and looked up at him with pleading eyes.
Castiel playfully slapped his shoulder and kissed him. As they got their own slices, the bell over the front door dinged and Jack came barreling in, his mom and Gabe behind him.
"It's the candles," Cas answered, smiling. He walked over to Dean and kissed him deeply before leading him by the hands to the table. "Sit, sit," he ordered gently.
It was windy enough for an extra layer of cloth to be needed, but not hot enough to go swimming, something Jack loved to do. The weather was too ripe to stay inside reading, and luckily Jack and his friends' classes were cancelled for the day because Mrs. Moseley was sick with a fever.
Jack narrowed his eyes at him. "At my soccer game before I got hurt. You said 'I'm finally an uncle', which means you don't love me anymore."
As Jake gently set the Impala down a few feet away from him, Jody flipped Al onto his stomach and wrestled his arms behind him to cuff his wrists, the man flopping and struggling and yelling in protest. She pulled him to a standing postion and pushed his legs apart with her foot.
Jack sat up and rubbed at his eyes. Yawning, he got off his bed, tiptoeing into the hallway. He stared at the dark form of Sam pacing in the living room. The baby's cries filled the air and dug into Jack's brain.
"Okay, on three," Dean whispered, hand poised on Sam's doorknob. Held tight in his free hand was a plate with three waffles and threes pancakes, blueberries placed around all around the stack, and a little candle on top. Jack had the syrup and glass of orange juice and Cas was holding onto a knife of fork and colorful balloon with "Happy Birthday" written on it. "One, two, three!" He pushed the door open and the three rushed into the room.
"But it's so fun!" Castiel snaked his arms around Dean's body and kissed his jaw. Instinctively, Dean placed his hands on the older man's arm.
The silence swirled around him. The crackling of the fire and the sounds of the night time creatures echoing in the woods filled his ears.
The older man laughed. "I'm sorry about that, Dean. I shouldn't have snuck my way in and decided I lived here. It was wildly inappropriate. I thought it would've been, I don't know, cute."
"Heya, Gabe," Charlie said as she came onto the porch, wearing a warm looking hat with cat ears and a puffy red coat. "What's up?"
Dean snorted. "That you hate. Hey, we can take the classes together! So you can open up that daycare you always dreamed of."
"Hey, Cas." Dean's dark blue jacket was splattered with snow and his cheeks bloomed pink. A white beanie that made him look absolutely adorable was pulled down to cover the tips of his ears. The man stared at Castiel silently for a second or two before looking down at the box in his gloved hands. "I, uh, brought some stuff you left at my place. Some books and an old toothbrush and junk."
Dean didn't think he'd have had to worry about the fridge. Cas had a strict vegen diet, and Dean ate mostly vegetarian dishes. There were a few occasions were he ate chicken or fish, and always a bacon double cheeseburger on his birthday. Unfortunately, Sam stocked the fridge full of meat; steaks, ribs, ham, turkey. Things that Dean tried his hardest to avoid at the supermarket. The freezer wasn't much better; his frozen yogurt was replaced with ice cream.
Speaking of which, Dean tore his eyes away from his fuck buddy's perfect body to finish undressing himself. He threw his clothes into the hamper behind his door and shoved his shoes under the bed. He maneuvered his body until he was relaxed against the pillows and spread his legs out, knees up near his chest.
Dean snorted and turned back to his kids. "Claire, no TV and no computer for three weeks. Jack, same thing except for two weeks. And you have to call and apologize to Mr. Moseley."
Their uncle grunted, a hard scratchy sound deep in his throat. "No. I don't want to. Why are you so obsessed with the weather? Are you an old man?" He flappped a hand in the direction of the windows. "Look outside if you want an update on the rain."
"Uh huh." Dean finished putting on his blades and shoved his sneakers in his bag. Slinging it back over his shoulder, he stood and smiled at Cas, making the man's heart pound fast. "Let's go!" Dean took off down the street, and it took Castiel a second to get his bearings and hop on his board.
Cas shook his head. "No. They need to learn to behave. Kaia and Patience are younger than you and they don't cause problems." An idea came to Cas then. "How about this; you guys be quiet during today's sermon and we'll have chocolate chip pancakes for lunch."
He slumped onto the grass and rested his head between his knees. The sun burned into his neck, but he didn't care. He had slipped his cloak off earlier, his constant movement had made him heat up, making the item unnecessary.
Castiel looked up from the bag of mini KitKats he was inspecting and smiled warmly at Dean, making his face blush.
Loud thumping music filled Dean's ears. But it wasn't really music, at least not to him. It was just noise. The trip to the club had been his friend Sam's idea and he'd ask Dean and Cas to come because he didn't know anybody else and didn't want to go alone. Dean wasn't really sure why Castiel even agreed to go; he hated going out.
"Sure. Why not?" He was right behind his dad as they made there way to the cardiologist's office. The doctor in question was sitting behind his desk, little knick knacks lined up in a neat row near its edge. The two Winchester men took their seats and when Dr. Garrison looked up from the form he was writing on, Dean's jaw clicked as it dropped open.
"I... I... I..." The high schooler breathed in and out heavily. "I don't know what happened!" He ran over to a chair and pulled it to the wall. He stood on it and grabbed the smoke detector, popping it open to take the batteries out. The silence was abrupt and a ringing lingered in Cas's ears. "I knocked over a c- con- contianer of apple juice an-and I wasn't watching what I was doing and I... I'm not an idiot, I kn- swear. I know how to cook, I just..." Dean jumped down and ran to the sink. He picked up the pan and stared forlornly at it.
Sam had essentially turned the living room into his bedroom; a full set of plaid sheets now had a home on the couch, and Dean's expensive coffee table was pushed up against wall, covered with stacks of Sam's books and little knick knacks he'd saved from the fire. He'd bought a dresser at a thrift store and stuffed it full of his clothes, and everytime Dean glanced at the ugly old thing, he became increasingly worried Sam would be there for a long time.
His husband swallowed and shook his head slightly. "Doesn't seem like it, with the way you've been hoggin' him and all. I've held him like twice. I think you're being way too overprotective."
"You scared the shit out of me," the Winchester exclaimed happily. He tried his best to wipe the water off his sport goggles.
Dean, looking relieved, his perfect green eyes bright, opened his mouth to respond, but Jack burst into the bathroom.
The other boy pointed past the second slide and towards the garden. Jack's uncles were sitting on one of the benches by the garden, Dean with his head on Cas's lap and the two holding hands. "They remind me of my mom and Gabriel."
Something hard hit Dean in the back of the head, and he yelped. Clutching the now throbbing part of his skull, he spun around, eyebrows low over his eyes, ready to scold whoever it was. His face relaxed slightly when he saw his younger brother, Sam, staring at him, arms folded and stance stiff.
"N-no... I... uh, it would be hypocritical of me to not like gays considering I am bisexual." He grinned and gave him double finger guns.
"I'm making blueberry pancakes," his stepdad whispered. "And I got bacon and scrambled eggs. You hungry?"
"So, what's up with the get up?" Dean asked, trying to distract himself. "You look and smell clean for once."
"Maybe we should do something else," Kevin suggested. "You could have broken your nose or something!"
"Hey, sweetie," he soothed, scratching the girl on her back. "Let's go. Come on, it's okay, I'm here." She let out a loud whine. "Heh. You jumped pretty high up. Maybe I should enter you in a dog show.
Stacks of stapled packets of paper mocked Cas with their tiny print and incessant lines. Signing his name now filled his stomach with lead and made his brain ache, no matter the reason.
Castiel sprung up from the bed and headed into the hallway. "I'm taking the Impala," he informed his boyfriend.
Castiel was grateful when Kevin offered to help him carry the boxes of pizza. They each carried two, and put them on the scratched knotty pine table. It had been cleared of its display of new arrivals, and along with the pizza had two bottle of Sprite, stacks of plastic cups, and paper plates on it. Red heart shaped balloons floated around and pink streamers hung from the ceiling.
Dean bit his lip. "God, he is a weird kid. Let's go." He held out his hand for Castiel to take and they headed out the door. Castiel grabbed his skateboard and helmet from the porch.
A child's shriek brought Dean back to the present. He clutched his wallet and climbed back out. Miracle jumped onto his leg, panting.
Dean rolled his eyes. "Stop being dramatic. I know what you're trying to do, and you need to cut it out. She's drunk."
He felt Cas slip his own hands down the back of Dean's trunks, and he  pulled away to let out a gasp. Embarrassed, he tried to recover by nipping at Castiel's neck, and he felt a swell of pride when Cas let out satisfied groan. Feeling bold, Dean ground his crotch against Castiel's, and the man groaned louder.
Dean gagged. "Gross. My body will never get used to the healthy crap you keep giv- shoveling down my mo- throat." He unwrapped the foil and balled it up. "Mmm," he moaned when he took a whiff. It was perfectly cut, nestled between two slices of white bread. "Medium rare?"
Him and Dean sat across from Cas and Kelly, Jack of course next to Cas again. The boy was vibrating in the chair, hugging the gift Dean had gotten him; a plushie of Grogu from The Mandalorian, which got Kelly's family all talking about the show. Dean had stayed quiet, even though Gabe knew he loved Star Wars almost as much as Jack did.
The nine year old struggled weakly and giggled as he was continuously tickled and kissed by his uncles. The two men finally stopped when Sam came over to the couch with breakfast.
It was Dean's turn to blush. "Obviously y-you said no." He noticed Cas's bottom lip quiver slightly. "Uhm, I never told her the exact details of when we first met. That would be way too inappropriate."
Castiel leaned against the side of his house, arms crossed and eyes trained on the door in front of him. A breakfast of oatmeal and half a banana was settling in his stomach painfully from eating too fast and he tried to ignore it.
Castiel took this answer, deciding to be as close to the truth. "Jack's sixth birthday." The boy had burst in, Kelly behind him, and dashed to the back of the store where the children's books were. Castiel's employee, Kevin, had gone to the bathroom and Cas was in one of the chairs in the back, Dean on his lap and the two furiously making out. Anyone in the front would have been unable to see them, and Jack had shaken Dean's leg until the two men looked at him. Castiel smiled when he remembered how excited his boyfriend had been at the time to show the boy some of his favorite books from when he was a kid. "They, uh, came to my bookstore so he could get some books. As presents. And Jack quickly became one of my favorite customers."
When the pair reach the table, Dean grins awkwardly. “Uh, hey Sam… Sarah” Dean says. He lets the other man slide into the booth first and then follows. “Um, this is Castiel.”
Sam nearly falls to the floor on principle. “N-nephew?” he sputters. Dean ignores him in favor of retreating back into the house, leaving his brother blithering on the porch.
They sit there like that, exploring this thing that had always been there between them, for what feels like hours. Sam doesn’t come back so Dean makes a mental note to thank him later.
Before Cas can say anything, Chaplin Lafitte continues. “Sir, your husband was injured in a firearms explosion. He was taken to a medical center miles away from base, where he was in a coma. He was a regular John Doe until he woke last week and was able to give his name. We had assumed he was dead but had no grounds to declare him as such.”
“Birthday?” and so on, she continues asking questions. When she’s done, she prints something out and then gives Dean a hospital bracelet, putting it on the wrist that doesn’t hurt.
“Silly, daddy,” the little girl next to him laughs. She has red hair, but other than that, she looks almost identical to her father.
He hears quiet sobs and hushed voices as he approaches the kitchen. Once there, he sees Dean holding a small boy, probably three at the oldest, on his hip. The boy is sniffling into Dean’s shoulder while Cas, Dean’s husband, is wiping down his forehead with a towel. There’s a mess of food on the floor and at the kitchen counter, as well as on both Cas and the boy.
“If my yard is torn up from all of you running through it when the snow melts this spring, you’re all going to fix it,” Castiel says. Dean begins to worry that the man is angry when in a sudden, swift movement, he bends down and creates a snowball, nearly perfect, and launches it at Sam Winchester’s perfect hair.
The storyline is about two brothers  with a militaristic upbringing who were dragged into a life of “hunting” that they didn’t want to be a part of. The younger brother is more rebellious while the older one blindly obeys the father.
“That’s like, a little under 6 hours away from us!” Sarah grins, even though 6 hours isn’t anything to get so excited about.
“Papa!” Mary cried. She was wiggling around so Cas brought her down from his shoulders in fear that she might fall. “Papa! I see daddy!” She took off running before Cas had a chance to ask where. He tried to follow her through the crowd of people, not even bothering to care when he bumped into too many people.
“So we watched your short films,” Sam says when they’re at dinner. It’s fancy this time, because it’s the last dinner they’re having together this trip. They’re at some big restaurant with white table cloths and polished silver ware.
“You’re a lot friendlier than the woman we sat next to on the last flight. She complained about me to one of the flight attendants and got her seat moved.” Cas snorts and Dean glares at him, but there’s no malice behind it.
“They are really good, aren’t they. One might even say they’re good enough for television.” Cas says. Sarah and Sam look confused.
It had been over a year since Castiel Winchester had seen his husband. Over a year since their daughter, Mary, had seen her father. Birthdays passed, holidays passed, milestones passed.
“Castiel. Or Cas.” Cas would reach out to shake Dean’s hand, but he really can’t, since the man has gone back to gripping the armrests.
Cas reaches forward for Sam’s hand and shakes it. “It’s nice to meet you, Sam.” He doesn’t seem all that eager to be meeting him, which leads Sam to think he’s developed some less than positive opinion of him, and they’re probably completely valid.
Dean is about to turn, to say something, he doesn’t know what, when a second thought occurs to him—in the entire time Miracle has been living with thim, Dean hasn’t been able to leave the dog alone for more than five minutes without him whining like a baby, but the bunker is dead silent. He says as much to Sam who was apparently thinking the same thing because he’s already pulling out his gun.
Sarah and Dean behave kindly to each other, having no reason not to. “It’s nice to meet you, Sarah.” Dean says in a way so mature that Sam has a hard time believing he’s not dreaming. Sarah is the type of girl Dean would normally flirt restlessly with, so why isn’t he?
“Well, they’re about these two brothers who kind of fight monsters… I know it sounds cheesy when it’s put like that but it’s a lot creepier and… well, emotional than they seem… or so I’m told.”
She clicks on one of the first websites that shows up. It shows a chart with a bunch of titles and ratings next to them, all of them relatively good. The first title reads “The Woman in White” and Sarah clicks on it.
When the episode ends and the credits roll out, Dean excuses himself to go to the bathroom. Cas stays, because he likes seeing his boyfriend’s name printed in white font as the very last thing someone sees of the show: Created by Dean Winchester.
So maybe it wasn’t a great idea to have this snowball fight right in the front yard, but this is the first year Dean has hosted the Christmas get together for his family and he wants everyone to be satisfied. So naturally, when his niece and nephew, Mary and little Bobby, asked if they could have a snowball fight, Dean couldn’t refuse. Of course, it hadn’t helped that his own daughter, Grace, had used those irresistible puppy dog eyes on her dad--they were the last things he saw before he caved.
They spend the rest of the night lazily making out. Aside from a few hickeys here and there, they don’t do anything more than kiss and grope each other. Cas probably assumes that Dean is too worn out to go any further, and for that, Dean’s thankful.
In retrospect, Sam didn’t know how he hadn’t seen it all along. Maybe in the beginning it was because he was naive, just like a young person should be. But as life went on, he and Dean had somehow always felt like they were alone.
Sam shrugs and scoots over to make room. They sit in silence for god knows how long. The night is getting colder and Sam is beginning to wish he’d brought a jacket, but he doesn’t plan on getting up from his position beside Dean.
“Dean, wait up,” Sam calls, but Dean doesn’t stop. He storms up to the door of the bunker, ignoring the sound of his brother behind him,.
“Have you gotten the call yet?” Cas asks when they wake the next morning. Dean has barely opened his eyes yet but Cas is eager to chat, apparently.
“Alright, bring him on back.” Cas then walks Dean to a room with flowers on the wallpaper and a fancy, high-tech computer coming out of the wall. Cas sits Dean down on the bed covered with a sheet of paper but he doesn’t leave. Instead, Cas sits down in the chair next to the bed while the woman stands in front of the computer and begins tapping the screen.
“The flying! Humans really shouldn’t be able to fly--dammit.” The plane rocks forward and the man squints his eyes together tightly.
Dean, dressed in his uniform, was leaning on a crutch, one arm in a sling, and the entire area above his left eye bandaged but he managed to hold up the little girl effortlessly. Cas stood for a few moments before it finally sunk in--this was real. Dean really was right there.
Dean pours water into one of the biggest glasses in the cupboards and follows Sam back to Cas’s room. He’s still there, sleeping soundly with Miracle at his side.
“Castiel!” Sam was pounding on the door, sounding worried now. If only he knew. If only knew that his only brother could be dead right now. Sam looked up to his brother--basically worshiped him. This would break him.
“Beverages? For the enemy?” Cas gives Dean his renowned bitch-face. “Okay, fine. Hey, what are you going to do with the groceries you left outside?”
Cas closes his eyes and his lips turn upwards, reminding Dean so much of how he looked after he’d said goodbye. Dean has to look away.
When they part ways, Sam is more confident about his and Dean’s relationship. He feels like, if anything, they might stay in touch after the funeral which happens in two days.
It’s perfect and Dean doesn’t even care that people might see him because nobody’s opinion of him could change how happy he feels right now, so Dean goes back to focusing on his boyfriend’s lips.
“Castiel? Like the angel?” though Dean’s getting more delirious by the second, he notices the surprise on Castiel’s face. People probably don’t often understand what his name means, Dean imagines. “Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?” he asks, a dreamy smile on his face.
It’s not long before the front door swings open without a knock and two women stroll in. One has bright red hair. She’s smiling and carrying a massive crockpot. The woman beside her is holding a pie in each hand.
“So, Cas,” Dean says when he approaches. “I don’t know if you’re interested, or single, but I was wondering if you’d like to maybe grab coffee sometime?” He looks nervous--not we’re on a plane and ohmygod we’re going to die nervous--but nervous nonetheless.
“Oh, I believe it. Freakin genius, in’t he,” Dean laughs. “Well, congrats Sammy. What about you, Sarah? What do you do?”
Now he’s here, holding the postcard in his hands, checking it again and again to make sure he has the right address. He isn’t sure how he’s going to work up the courage to actually go and knock on the door when he’d spent about an hour in the airport bathroom convinced he was going to throw up from anxiety. He should have rented a car. That would have given him a chance to get away if things went badly or, more likely, if he chickened out. Instead he’d gotten a cab and paid way too much for a ride all the way to Pontiac. A cab that’s long gone now.
“It did. I wonder if he’s leaving as soon as the funeral is over. How long are we staying?” Sam asks.
Cas runs over to Dean, groceries forgotten on the sidewalk, and crouches down behind their makeshift blockade. The left wing is weak, but there’s no time to fix it now.
The room is silent for a few moments. The only visible light is coming from the lamp post outside, shining through the dingy curtain.
He’s nervous about so much right now: the funeral, Sam, Sam and Jess, Crowley’s impending phone call, coming out to Sam… everything. “So we’ve got the rest of today and all of tomorrow to ourselves. What should we do?” Dean’s driving, his eyes are on the road, but he doesn’t miss Cas’s smirk. “Alright, so back to the motel?”
“What are you talking about? Why’d you let me drive all this way?” Sam huffs a breath and looks up from the book. “Cas didn’t die,” he says and, upon seeing Dean’s confusion, quickly corrects himself. “I mean, yes, the empty took him, but he didn’t die. He was taken.”
Everyone in the kitchen is hugging each other. The redhead kisses Dean on the cheek and engulfs Cas in a bear hug. Then she lifts Jack off the ground and swings him around, prompting him to fall into a fit of giggles.
At around two in the afternoon, Jack announces that the first guest has arrived by shouting from where he’s been perched by the window for the better part of thirty minutes.
They spend the rest of the time at lunch catching up. They don’t bring up any subjects regarding their past or their father, they just talk about the now. They chat about their friends and their jobs and what the city they live in is like.
“You'll need to get to Los Angeles as soon as possible, you'll start hiring your team and making a script.”
“Since you won’t let me call you an ambulance, I’m taking you to the hospital myself.” He closes the passenger door and moments later climbs into the driver’s side.
Sarah gently grabs his chin and turns his face gently so he’s facing her.  “Hey, it’s gonna be okay.” She presses a soft kiss to his cheek. Sam closes his eyes and smiles before getting out of the car and moving to open Sarah’s door.
“Can I help you?” the man asks. He’s squinting and tilting his head like Sam is somehow the strangest thing he’s ever seen. It’s not exactly unfriendly, but Sam gets the feeling the man would rather not have been interrupted from whatever he was doing.
“We’re fine, thanks,” Cas sort of growls. Sam turns his head abruptly, surprised to see Cas’s cheeks look a little flushed. Maybe Dean gets hit on a lot--that would get annoying after a while. Whatever his reason, Cas gets her to go away. Dean chuckles and nudges Cas’s shoulder with his own.
“You know, if you don’t push so hard, the crayons last for a longer time.” Cas tells the girl, picking up one of her crayons and demonstrating. Emma smiles and picks up a red crayon, rubbing it over a dog’s ear. Cas refrains from reprimanding her color choice and technique.
“Oh,” Sam says. He hadn’t really considered that himself, seeing as he was drunk when he bought the ticket. “I, uh, I’ve had a rough go of it lately. To be honest, I was tired of being alone. I think I just wanted my family.”
“No thanks needed, Ellen. She was lost and needed a place to stay, I’m glad I’m the one who could give it to her.”
Cas couldn’t make it to the bathroom, he only got as far as the kitchen sink before retching up everything he’d eaten that day. There was a picture on the fridge, one of Dean and Cas and Mary on the day they finalized her adoption--Mary, only a baby at the time-- was grinning widely and happily as her new dads held her and cried.
“Sounds good to me.” Cas says with a wink. He then pulls Dean into the bathroom and toward the grimy shower.
“Don’t know if you’d look great in cowboy boots, though. And personally, I don’t think that Doctor Sexy is half as sexy as you.” The guy laughs again.
“Oh, no, I figured I could just go find a hotel. To be honest, I forgot it was Thanksgiving when I decided to come.”
As Cas turns to walk away, Dean slaps his ass and Sam rolls his eyes. So does Cas. “Night, babe,” Dean says.
The worst part had been Mary talking about her daddy like he was coming home any day now. She’d been like that since the beginning. This was the first tour where Mary had understood what was going on.
When Sam looks back to his brother, he sees Dean watching Jack with fond eyes as he dances to the music. Cas, on the other hand, is watching Dean with the same kind of look.
“Neat. It’s important to get the arts in High School, ain’t it. I wish I’d had more of them when I was in school.” Dean smiles and Sam looks at his brother confused. He never knew Dean was into any kind of art. Dean and Cas share a knowing look, and Sam doesn’t comment about how that used to be a look he alone shared with his brother.
“Bout a year after we met. Just went to the courthouse and signed the papers.” He pauses. “Jack is Cas’s son. I mean, he’s mine, but Cas and his girlfriend had him before we met. She died in labor.”
“You mind if I get some fresh air?” Sam asks. Cas looks up from the stack of papers in his lap and nods. He motions behind him to the dining room where there’s a sliding glass door. Sam gets up from the couch and walks over to it, sliding it open and stepping outside. It’s chilly but it’s warmed up since the morning, melting all of the snow. There’s a fair amount of toys scattered around the backyard, a grill, and a nice wrap-around porch. Sam sits down on the top step.
Cas doesn’t hate flying. In fact, he loves it. He doesn’t do it often--doesn’t have any need--but when he does, he’s absolutely thrilled. So now, he should be buzzing with excitement, right? Except, not, because he’s flying back to Lawrence from his family Christmas in California. Not an ideal plane ride after a less than ideal Christmas.
Dean glanced over at him once, the glint in his eyes saying he thought Sam was crazy, and puts the car in park. Sam climbs out first and immediately goes to the trunk.
He went to New York one summer for an internship at a law firm. He went to Haiti on a mission trip. He’s been to Mexico, Canada, and even went backpacking through Europe the summer before he started Stanford Law.
“You ready to order now?” the same waitress from earlier asks, surprising Sam as he had not seen her approach.
When Sam is gone, Cas finally turns his head so that his cheek is resting on the pillow and h’s looking up at Dean. “I’m sorry,” Cas says.
He smiled. "It's been nothing bad, Dean. Just that you're a firefighter and that you're very helpful with Jesse while your brother is at Stanford. He's pre-law, right?" Dean nodded and he continued. "And he says you're very sweet and smart and he wishes you hadn't had dropped out of college."
Jack left the ball in the corner and ran to the middle of the room. Kevin was on his right and Maggie was on his left. He adjusted his orange belt and stood striaght, staring ahead.
Shaking as he held onto Miracle, Dean squeezed his eyes shut and buried his face into her fur, breathing in her smell and mumbling "It's okay" over and over. He wasn't sure if he was talking to the dog or himself.
Dean stood in the doorway to his bedroom, Castiel's yoyo clutched in his hand.  He was watching as Cas put his clothes in his dresser. Cas refused to put dirty clothes in his duffel and always insisted on going to a laundromat before they came home from a hunt.
Sure enough, Cas was paddling his way towards them. The kayak was a light green color, and he had on a dark red personal flotation device.
Brow furrowed, Dean turn the heat on the stove down and turned to the man. "Jo's best friend. And one of her roommates."
"As the dominant one," Cas reiterated, giving his boyfriend  a warning look, "it is my duty to make sure you are safe during our intimate time."
Dean grabbed the neck of the instrument and pulled it out of his friend's grasp. "It's not yours. Leave it."
The boy looked around and spotted Dean, the fire making the shadows dance on his face. His father was holding tight to him, gently stroking his hair. Jack took a step towards their direction, but was pushed back into his mother, and locked into that position when she snaked her arm around his middle and held tight.
"Oh, you live here? I live there," Cas pointed to his house. "I'm Castiel. Are y-" The guy rolled away before he could finish his sentence.
Jake held up a white purse, a dripping stain of blood on its bottom. "This proof enough?" He peeked inside. "I see a real sharp knife, and three witnesses saw you grab it off of Mrs. Montgomery and run off with it."
Inias sighed. "Alright, I guess I could walk by a few times and text you some updates. And I'll ask Dumah."
"You've grown a whole inch, my boy!" He put his son back on his feet and stared at him seriously. "Momma okay?" He smiled at the young boy's enthusiastic nod. "Excellent. Mags, you got it?"
Dean marched over to the armchair, where Castiel was sitting, and sat on the man's lap, giving him a kiss on the cheek. Jack's mom and stepdad were on the couch, Sam holding the baby to his chest.
Jack shook his head. "I'd rather read in my room with Felix." His pyaramid collapsed and he sighed, and the sigh turned into a yawn.
"Uh, that wasn't a euphemism, right?" Claire asked, nose scrunched up. "'Cause I don't need to hear that."
He nodded. "A few years. My older sister gave it to me for my twentieth birthday. Did you get your boat fron Tran's Rentals?"
"They... are not very curious I guess. I told them all they needed to know about you. I was pretty sure they wouldn't ask you anything. I just wanted them to meet you."
Because he was holding his phone, Cas fingerspelled 'Congratulations' instead of signing it. "Another Winchester, huh? Your parents must be ecstatic."
In the bathroom, as Castiel washed his hands, his phone rang. Quickly drying them on a hand towel, he pulled out the device. It was a Facetime call from Dean's brother, Sam. Confused, he answered it. His ex boyfriend's grinning face filled the screen.
"Are you having an orgasm?" Sam asked from the cot, sitting crosslegged and flipping through one of the books he bought, the rest stacked precariously next to him.
"And she dumps me through a text," he exclaimed. "A text! 'Sorry, I'm actually gay, bye'. I mean is that normal?"
Finally, it was time for the game to start. Kevin was goalie and Maggie and him had to stay and wait their turn. Jack crossed his arms and slumped against the wall.
When he landed, he wobbled and was afraid he'd tumble off, but he was able to right himself. Sighing with relief, he looked at the window across from his bedroom and noticed it was open, so he climbed through. Dean was standing there in a tshirt and boxer briefs, brushing his teeth.
The front door was open a crack and Cas's heart beat wildly. He couldn't remember if he had locked or not, or if someone had broken in. Leaving the cart on the porch he quietly went inside.
"I know, but it is tradition. It's been happening in Tadpole for so long it has become an integral part of Indigo Forest culture." He looked out the window at the stars twinkling in the sky. "People come from all around. Not just the forest, the islands nearby, too. It's good for trading and farming and everything that helps keep this town alive." He looked back at his nephew, and the smile on his face did not reach his eyes. "The... activity at the end of the night is the worst part, yes, but everything else it brings is a blessing." He ruffled Jack's hair, leaving it slightly damp from his touch.
"Donate ten bucks- hic- and register your Email. It's for charity. An LGBT youth center. I am so- hic- entering." A smile graced Dean's handsome face. "I need m- hic- my card. I'll be right- hic- back."
A question Jack had been mulling over the past few weeks popped into his head, and without thinking he asked it. "What's it like having a little sister?"
When the words had processed their way into Dean's brain, he sighed sadly. The sight that he'd seen in that room and what he had just listened to was familiar to him. His parents had spent almost every night with him at that table, trying to help him get through his own homework and study for exams, and it was always extra hard for his dad but Dean always appreciated how much he tried. Despite all their support and help, all he had to show for his high school career was a wrestling trophy and the framed GED above his bed.
"No, that's everything," he replied. "Thank you again and Happy Valentine's Day. And flip the sign to 'closed' on your way out."
Adam hit Cas hard in the right knee. Pain rung throughout his leg and he hid it behind a strained smile.
Dean moaned softly and put his hands on the back of Castiel's head. Castiel moved his hands to Dean's pants, pulling the button out of the hole and yanking the zipper down. He reached into the slit of Dean's boxers and grabbed his cock. It had gotten half hard when Dean had Castiel's own cock in his mouth, but softened when Sam showed up.
"Yeah," Cas agreed, keeping his gaze on Dean's profile as he followed him to an empty billiards table. "Very."
Cas stared at a chip in the paint in the wall behind Dean. I miss you, too, he thought. "You'll live. You were fine there before we met."
"Hi, sweetie," his mom yawned. She patted the spot next to her. Jack plopped himself down and glanced at the baby.
Castiel hopped off the bed and slid his feet into Dean's slippers. At the door, he turned and blew Dean a kiss. "I'll be right back." He headed out into the hallway, igoring Dean's loid, exaggerated grunt, and walked to Jack's room. The door was cracked open, and just before he knocked, he heard a long sigh.
Castiel snickered against the back of the younger man's neck. "She asked me if I wanted a blowjob and I told her I was flattered, but gay. Then she laughed, said 'That's nice', and passed out on my lap."
"Hey, I'm getting changed," the elder Winchester brother called over his shoulder. He heard Sam throw the blanket over himself. Quickly, Dean took the rest of his clothes off and threw them onto the pile of dirty clothes next to his backpack and considered the two pairs of trunks he had packed. The one with the shark print was dryer so he slipped them on. "I'm decent," Dean said as he put his robe on.
Charlie pressed on her controller, and the gampelay onscreen stopped. "No, I'm gonna fuckin' turn it up." She spun around on her ass to face Cas. With the AC cranked up it was cold, and she had on a lime green hoodie zipped all the way up and oversized hot pink sweatpants. Ugly bright socks donned her feet and one had a small hole in the toe.
Castiel shook his head. "No, I have my own apartment a few minutes away. I come by sometimes to babysit my younger siblings."
"That reminds me of the other thing," Cas rubbed Dean's knee. "I know you like it when I say rude things to you, and if maybe sometimes I go too far or you're not in the mood, you can safeword and I'll shut up."
The car shook violently and Dean threw his arms around Miracle, rubbing her back as she whimpered again. He swallowed, throat dry, and sat up as best as he could to look out the window and see what had happend. Squinting, he peered out through his suddenly gray view. Another jerk of the car had him gasping and he realized he felt lighter, like a drop on a roller coaster. Confused, Dean looked closer and he saw through the gray and leaves and loose dirt the neverending expanse of cloud, and all of a sudden he felt like he was spinning.
"About before? Under the mistletoe you asked me out and I didn't get to respond. So... yes." She leaned over and pecked the corner of his mouth.
Kevin nodded, gave him a strange look and walked away. Cas sighed and continued his shopping, aware of the way the other customers were looking at him. A mother near the frozen meats stopped short when she saw him, grabbed her son, and scurried off in the opposite direction. Cas didn't pay it any mind, and went about his own business.
The park was only six blocks away, so Cas picked up the pace to catch up to his boyfriend. His board ran smooth over the pavement until a filled in pothole nearly knocked him down. He ran a bit to make up for those seconds he lost, and back on his board, he ended up next to Dean.
Kelly took a long drink of juice. "Uhm... I... Cas and Dean were a couple but they broke up and now we... we. Him and I, that is..." Her shoulders slumped. "Oh, forget it. I can't lie in front my son. Mom, Dad, everyone," she glanced around the room, "Cas is gay, and w-"
At first, Dean thought it was sweet of him to do that, since they had stayed up until 3:30, first watching Tombstone on his laptop and then, after it ended, he was informed that Castiel was horny and was flipped onto his stomach. Dean still felt sore. But then he realized, since it was Cas, there was probably some selfish reasoning behind it.
"Balthazar, please do not compare my feelings for Dean with your ill advised trysts with three of the worst human beings I have ever met."
Cas got up with the list and pen clenched in his fist. He got under the covers with his boyfriend and handed the paper over. "I wrote down things Claire, Jack, Maggie and I could do together tomorrow."
Legs kicking in the water and feet barely grazing the slimy bottom, Dean swam towards Cas. He kept hid slightly blurry gaze on Castiel's lips. Dean gave the man a quick peck, and pulled back, looking into his eyes.
"Found the solvent, Jodes," a man said, appearing next to the sheriff. He was tall and and Dean guessed he was about Sam's age, and was wearing a similar uniform to Sheriff Mills's, his a chestnut brown and the nameplate reading "Deputy Talley". "There's barely any left, and I'm positive it's the last bottle."
Cas looked down at his sleeping son and then at his husband, the other man's beautiful face smiling sweetly at him. He let out a long sigh. "I'll go to the store."
Jack, Maggie, and Mary jogged away, while Dean and Cas walked at a slow pace. Cas grabbed Dean's hand, and squeezed. Both their palms were sweaty. Castiel didn't care.
"Yeah. Her dad called and said she refuses to come back until I do. Did you know she sent a fruit bouqet to my class?"
When it got pretty late, the occupants all went to different areas of the house, most heading upstairs to one of the three bedrooms. Charlie and Stevie were on the pull out bed and Layla was squeezed onto the loveseat. Cas was near the fireplace on the air mattress he brought, Jack on the floor next to him tucked into his solar system sleeping bag, reading out loud from Goosebumps number 16, One Day at HorrorLand.
His mom ignored him. "Don't you think it's a little bit, I don't know, unethical to date your father's doctor?"
They turned around and, sure enough, Dean was fast asleep against Castiel's shoulder, snoring and drooling away. Cas yawned and gently shook the man. When he continued to snore, Castiel shook him even harder. With a snort, Dean's eyes popped open.
Castiel turned his beautiful blue eyes toward him, and Dean let out a low gasp; The man was clean shaven and his hair was neatly trimmed. A black coat covered a light blue button down that Dean was certain belonged to him and dark blue jeans hugged his legs. He caught a whiff of watermelon and the scent of the yellow and pink flowers he was carrying.
Dean grinned. "When you say 'hang out', do you mean going to see a movie and maybe dinner at a nice restaurant or even  you pounding me into my mattres?"
"Why is he being such a dick? If he just tells me why he's mad I can apologize and we can get back to having sex."
Cas hummed in reply and gently lifted Dean's arm toward him, inspecting his wrist. "Do the marks hurt?"
Dean exhaled through his nose. "Probably because you've barely slept since we brought the baby home. That's why I woke you up, I wa-"
Dean looked up and waved. Cas watched as he put the bottle down and started stretching; touching his toes and reaching his arms up. The he spun around and gripped the wall, sticking his ass out.
Cas glowered at him. "I am not a hippie. It's a fulltime position and the pay is way more than I could ever make at the gym. Need to start really saving up for my own place. I'll probably ask Sam to room with me, so he'll be out of your hair, too."
Cas placed plates of pancakes and waffles in front of Dean and Jack, and Dean gagged, pushing the food away.
Cas smiled at him and pulled the hunter in for a hug. "I'm sorry, too. I should've told you why I was upset. It was petty and immature. "
"Hey are you okay?" Dean, who'd been about to walk into the kitchen, asked worriedly. He held his hand out and helped Cas up. "You just slammed on to the floor. Why are you running?"
The bright white of the cafeteria made Dean wince when he first walked in. It was a stark difference to the red, blue, and green of the actual park. His eyes still hurt slightly as he slid into the seat and dropped his tray on the table.
Dean blinked. He did not expect Cas to look so animated. His eyes lit up and he was gesturing widly with his hands.
"Don't let them do this, Cas," Dean murmered, and Jack could desperation in his voice. They were bathed in star light and holding hands. "I need you."
"He always tried to keep Dad away from the frozen section," Gabriel added. "So he couldn't get any ice cream or microwaveable pizza."
Just as he was closing the door, his dad was coming out of a patient room, pulling on his tie-dyed Wildwood, New Jersey sweatershirt.
Jack shrugged in response and climbed into the car. He put his backpack on the floor and buckled in. Unzipping the bag, he squeezed his teddy bear's ear.
Anael was by one of the tables, talking to Spruce and a few of the other members of Dean's roller derby team. Cas waved at her and she smiled back at him.
"My dads and my grandma cooked everything... and I cleaned the dining room for the adults! It's probably a mess now, bu-"
"I haven't lied about anything," Dean stated, taking his jacket and standing up. "Uhm, thanks for the food, but I think I should go."
Castiel pushed into him harder, going faster. His cock stabbed his prostate and precum dribbled out of Dean's slit. He whined again, aching to touch himself. His balls started to tighten and he came, shooting white onto his stomach and chest. Cas fucked into him a few more times before he stilled. He breathed heavily and pulled out of Dean. He threw the condom out and got off the bed.
"Yes, I mean no. I... Dean, stop staring at them!" Cas yanked Dean by elbow and led him and Jack out of the room and back to the kitchen.
"The orange and green one?" It was the only mug there. Dean looked closer. "It has some kind of weird looking bug glued to the bottom." There were smaller bugs painted around its inside.
Dean took the three steps over to him and put both hands on his shoulders, squeezing slightly. "Come with me."
"I dunno. I'm, uh, busy at work. Lots of cars to fix." A confused look crossed his face. "Where are you guys, anyway?"
"We tried," Charlie answered for her. "You never listened. I love you, Mom, but thank God for Stevie or else you never would have stopped."
Squinting into the burning orb, Dean concentrated on looking past the bright purple spots that smeared his vision and studied the sky. It was a bright perfect blue, not one single cloud marring it, like the storm never even happend, and as far Dean knew might not have; If he wasn't at home or even in Lebanon, he could've been literally anywhere. He wasn't even sure how he was still alive after getting sucked into the tornado.
"I am. Now here is what is going to happen. Dean, you are going home and Cas is going with you. The long trip will do you two good. Nothin' to do but talk and talk and talk."
Dean snorted. Then he clapped his hands once and shifted in his seat. "So. My dad. What's he been tellin' you about me? Come on, let me hear it."
"Ugh," the boy muttered and crept into the bathroom, where he shut and locked the door before turning on the light. Blinking a few times at the brightness, he peered at himself in the mirror. Yellow bruises sweeped under his eyes like deformed crescent moons, and he poked at the edge of one of them and winced in pain.
Suddenly, he was yanked out of the air and  pulled over someone's legs. His shirt was hiked up and fingers started lightly running all over his back.
Cas didn't even realize he was smiling. "Oh. I uh. Was just thinking about my... friend. He always puts something dirty when he frosts Christmas cookies."
"I can't pick this up," he declared, stepping back from the vehicle. "And of course I had my keys. I must have, I definitely turned the heater on. How did I get them though?" He made a fist and tapped his forehead. "Maybe they were in my pcoket? Or already in the car? Would I have done that? I have before. Maybe I-"
Cas, at the stove, was heating up sesame oil in a skillet. He grinned. "Dean calls himself that. He needs to eat healthier. Everyone in this place does."
"That is absolutely impossible," Dean said, pouring the batter onto the frying pan. "Can't have too many."
"And yet," Maggie added, "she can lick dirty plates. That man's mind is a mystery wrapped in an enigma."
Dean gave his dad a suspicious look and ripped it open. "A wallet?" He inspected it; it was brand new, the leather cool in his hands. "What for?"
"Uh huh," she squeaked. She cleared her throat and finished emptying the syrup. Lifting the bucket, she wiped the bottom with a dish towel until it was bone dry. Then she asked Kaia to get the stepladder from the pantry. Next, she taped a piece of the twine to the bottom of the bucket. Kaia opened the ladder and put it next the door.  "Jack," she whispered as she climbed, trying not to grunt, "open the door a little."
Loud snoring was coming from the couch, so Jack tiptoed towards it and peeked over the back of it. Dean and Cas were on the pull out bed. Jack thought the two men looked like parenthesis with the way Cas was bent around Dean's back, and how  Dean was curled in on himself, head pillowed on his hands. The Winchester was the one who was snoring and Jack bit his bottom lip and covered his mouth so he wouldn't laugh when the man snorted, making him sound like a pig.
John made a "tsk"ing noise. "Thirty seconds since you last asked. Oh look at this idiot. Can't fucking drive."
The clock on the nightstand changed from 8:03 to 8:04 and Castiel's stomach growled again. His head was pounding from hunger, but he needed to watch Dean sleep for just one more minute.
Each kid in his class did ten front kicks, ten side kicks, and ten flying side kicks, which were Jack's favorite. After that they were allowed a five minute break and most kids went to get a sip of water from the fountain or use the bathroom. Jack ran to pee and nearly forgot to bow to the dojo, something that had to be done when leaving or entering.
Gabriel leaned down and directed his attention at Castiel.  "You're supposed to be talking through your issues, not trying to get Dean pregnant."
Dean hugged him a little tighter. "I'll watch but I won't join in. And I hope you realize your hands are going nowhere on or in me until you wash and purell at least three times.”
"Huh?" Chuck finally looked up from his writing. "Oh. Ri- thanks." Using one hand to continue writing, he used the other to munch away on his cheeseburger.
Back in his and Dean's room, Cas carefully put the bowls in their stand on the floor. Miracle was still sleeping so he woke her up with a belly rub. She woke with a snort, flipped onto her stomach, and let out a big yawn. She sniffed the air and headed for her dish and crunched away at her meal.
"Oh... y-your dad was the quietest. If anyone would ask me stuff, I expected it to be him. He doesn't talk much?"
"I mixed the batter," Jack called out happily. "And made the shapes." The nine year old had gotten cookie cutters shaped like dinosaurs the previous Easter and he took every opportunity he could to use them.
"R-right. Thank you." They stood in front of the elevator doors quietly for a couple of minutes. One was stuck on the 18th floor and the other was slowly coming down from the penthouse.
Cas put a hand on his husband's thigh and gave him a soft look. "I know you're his father just as much as I am."
They ate in a comfortable silence, and when Dean had a bite left of his burger, he heard a crash form the other room. He jumped up, nearly knocking the chair over. Jo was sitting on the couch, giggling. Looking around, he spotted Sam on his knees, trying to turn the knob to Dean's bedroom. He finally got it open and stumbled inside.
Castiel smiled sadly. "No. I meant about... the stuff I've been doing. Trying to make you healthier. Are you going to break up with me because of that?"
"Who the hell is being funny?" They were kissing again. With tongue. One of Castiel's biggest fucking dreams was really happening. Breathlessly, Dean touched their foreheads together. "Do you know how hard it's been, seeing you all the time and thinking I couldn't do what I just did?"
"Oh grow up," Dean told them. He opened the book that Jack had picked out earlier in the day, the first book in The Bad Guys series, and started to read.
Cas appeared behind Dean and grabbed  his shoulder. "What happened? Why did you scream? Are you okay?"
"Her," Jack said, annoyed, "her name is Miracle. And yeah, just lick the salt off and don't give her a kernel. And don't tell Dean. He doesn't want her to have junk food."
Miracle squeezed herself out of the narrow space by standing up as well as she could and putting her paws on the door for leverage. She managed to get her body on to the seat and hopped onto Dean's stomach, crying and licking him all over.
"Hold on," Jack said. He dropped his bag on the table. "I wanna show you something." He reached inside and pulled out two small objects.  "We stopped by a toystore and me and Castiel bought these. Maggie says she's going to teach us how to do the yoyo."
Later that night, after texting Sam for awhile to remind him about safe sex and a dinner of pizza, donuts, and ice cream, Dean and Cas were in Dean's bed, blankets a twisted mess around them.
It wasn't like Dean didn't notice things about him before, like the head tilt or that cute squinting thing. It was different things he saw now that they were together; Like when Cas would walk into the kitchen in the morning and Jack was hunched over eating whatever healthy crap Sam was making him eat he would touch his hair as he walked by. Or after a hunt he would hold Dean a little tighter at night. Or when Sam showed him something in a book Cas would lightly grip his right shoulder as he leaned over to look.
The boy up looked up at his uncle and nodded. He had learned about the Blue Moon Festival in school, knew about all the important stuff it brought to Tadpole, but he still felt a knife stab his stomach when he thought about how the festival ended.
Dean walked a few steps down the sidewalk, away from his car. Cas watched him grab fistfuls of his hair. He stopped and turned back around. "I have been feeling like the biggest asshole for two fucking months!"
Cas hummed in response and ran a hand over Dean's smooth chest, scratching lightly. He leaned down and sucked at a spot right above his left nipple.
Dean nodded and ran to catch up, speeding up the stairs past Cas and pulling the door open to hold it open for him. Kelly walked out as Dean came in, and she made her over to Gabe.
"Get it out!" he would shriek, from where he stood on the toilet, either at his own apartment or Cas's. "It's right there! Get it"
Cas, leaning forward in the back of the Prius, asked, "Charlie?" His breath was hot on Dean's neck and it made him nervous.
"But my breath will smell good," he pointed out. Taking the candy out, he gave her a serious look and lowered his voice. "Listen, Kells. Last night, I'm sorry about all that. I know I bummed you out."
"Unfortunately, I do," Dean called out as his dad ran out of the room. He looked at the doctor, who was smiling politely at him, hands folded on his desk. Dean smiled back and looked around the room, trying to find something he could use to make conversation. Besides the usual framed degrees on the wall, there was a messily painted rainbow flag taped up.
"First of all, the website I looked at advised anyone in sexual relationships to use safewords. Second of all, there are many things we have done, meaning what I've done to you, that could have gone badly to the point where you would have wanted me to stop." He narrowed his eyes at Dean.
When he got to the tent, he noticed that Castiel was not at the telescope. Instead, his apprentice Celeste was showing Rufus Turner how to aim it at the correct point in the sky.  That was strange, because Jack knew that his uncle had an issue with the young woman using any of his equipment at the moment; she was too new, he had said.
"Yeah!" Jack jumped onto his feet.  "Lemme see it!" Cas turned the box in his direction. "Cool, face painting!"
Mary waved a hand in Jo's general direction. "She's group chatting with her hockey team. Leave her alone."
Kelly huffed out a laugh that sounded like music to Gabe's ears. He knew the boy preferred hanging out at his brother's bookstore, devouring the pages in one of the comfy chairs and listening in during the weekend storytimes. Swimming lessons at the gym paled in comparison to the written word to the boy.
"Oh, sorry," the boy replied sheepishly, dropping his arms to his sides. Castiel could see pink on his cheeks. "I'm just so excited to finally meet you! Cas told me all about you."
Dean stared. "I don't under..." he trailed off when he realized what the strange shape was. Then he thought back to the hat. The mug. Sam saying "ribbit" to him.  "Oh."
Putting his pen in his mouth, Dean took a hard look at the clue in the crossword puzzle. Six letters, a person who prescribes medicine.
"No, I... It's really dumb." Silence for a few seconds. "Okay, so my m- uhm, Jody Mills, you guys know her?" Maggie said she didn't and Jack told her he had met Jody once. "Well she had advised me not to go on this hunt alone, it was this asshole shapeshifter, and I decided to ignore her and I kind of almost died, but her and these girls I live with, Patience and Alex, came in saved my ass at the last second. And, uh..."
It was a really good day. Especially when Cas was invited to spend the night. He could see the hickeys the ran up Dean's neck from where he sat.
Cas rubbed fists into his eyes, watching the swirls of light moving against the darkness. "Give me something. Please. I'm losing my mind."
Dean obeyed and watched, amused, at Cas as he sat down across from him. His laptop was also on the table, closed and with a heart shaped box on top. Dean put the book and donuts right next to it.
Dean gave Jesse a half smile and turned back to the newspaper. Him and Sam always had fun themselves when they were asked to repeat the phrase as kids. "Use the stall and don't fall in." The kid made his way over to the coffee shop bathroom at a quick pace.
"Yeah," Jack put in. "I didn't get any the other day when I got my tooth filled in." He turned to Maggie. "Did you know it was my first cavity?"
The sun was out, warming Dean's naked chest as he lied on the dock. Sam was next to him, reading again. They had spent the last hour and a half fishing with only a small bass to show for it. His parents and Jo were on a hike, and the two Winchester sons were too content to go with them.
Banshee stared at him, head cocked, but did what she was told. Her claws gripped into Miracle's sides and she clamped her teeth on the bigger dog's collar. He barked and ran up to the female and scratched at her knee. She looked at him and he immediately took off back to his uncle.
Listening as his dad creaked over the floorboards, Dean kept his gaze away from Cas. Mortified was the word that came to mind. He swallowed.
"Doubt it." He reached behind him to put his beer in the armrest's cupholder and tugged lightly on Castiel's wrist. Cas sat on the edge and Dean sat up and hugged him from behind. "Let's just stay in here together. Little alone time since the kids aren't inside. If you get what I mean."
"You okay now?" Dean asked. He put his hand on the boy's shoulder and Jack shrugged him off. "Alright. Look, kid, your mom and Sam are worried about you."
The next day at the water park, Dean spent most of his time  looking around for the lifeguard. Unfortunately, he didn't seem to be anywhere Dean went. He didn't see Castiel later the night either. Dean had kept looking out the window toward the other chalet, hoping to see Cas come out.
"Nothin'," she responded happily as she opened up the fridge, causing a wave of cold air to ghost over Cas's naked chest. She started shoving soda and beer cans into the cooler. "Can't I be in a good mood?"
Gabriel spat the mouthful of chocolate back into the cup. "Wh-what? H- Wh would you ev- I don't know wh-"
In the Impala, Cas had held Jack close to to his chest as Dean sped to the hospital. By then he had stopped crying and just listened to Cas murmuring soothingly into his ear. The throbbing pain in his nose made him wince and the blood on his face made him feel itchy.
Cas sighed. "Did you forget or were you just not listening when I told you about it last month while you were in Texas?"
They finished setting the tables just as Kelly's family started to pile in. Her cousin Layla, a bandana with Peanuts characters printed on it wrapped around her head, and her aunt came in carrying dishes of food, her Uncle Deacon close behind with bottles of Pepsi and Diet Coke.
"Yeah, well," he shrugged, "what're ya gonna do? Life huh? Foster care wasn't the worst. There were some good families among the shitty ones. When I turned 18, I took off for Manhattan and didn't see Cas for four years until he found me. Apparently he'd graduated high school early and went looking for our shithole father. I thought that was a pretty stupid idea; he was basically homeless that entire time."
"Yes, I heard you." Castiel wrote something else on the bottom of the list. "I'm sure they'll all like that," he muttered. "It's supposed to be fun."
His mom shook her head. "Soon, hopefully. Listen, sweetie, Sam and I were thinking maybe it would be a good idea for you to spend a week or two at Dean and Cas's."
Castiel ran up the steps and scooped Dean up, ignoring the Winchester's protest, and carried him to the kitchen.
John sat down and started in on his breakfast. "Tha- thi- it's delicious," the man said through mouthful off eggs. "What's th- what did you make it with?"
"Don't make fun of your sister," Ellen ordered. "That's not nice. Jo, just calm down baby. You'll get through it."
"Bela Talbot," the head of the council said, "you are charged with fraud, theft, two counts of murder, three counts of  attempted murder, and one count of suspected murder. Do you have anything to say?"
Dean licked his lips. "Okay, maybe I said that, once or twice. But you don't really act like a boyfriend anyway."
"Thank you, but no. I promised my roommate I'd watch a movie with him later." Rufus nodded, but didn't leave. "You're still here. Is there something else you want?"
"Aw, come on, Mom," Dean whined. "Why do you always have to find some kind of fault with all my relationships?"
What Dean found strange about the scene, was that no one was talking. At his house, it was nonstop conversation during dinner, his parents never shut up. Cas's family was focusing on eating, and his dad, Marvin, had one hand holding a book he was nose deep in and the other held a burger dripping in ketchup. He didn't seem interested in the salad or water.
"Just the thought process of pharaohs who ordered these triangular structures to be built," the nine year old stated while he used the mashed potatoes to keep the chicken nuggets in place.
"Right," she replied, "I'll let Becky know when we get back to the station." She turned to Dean. "Sir, I -"
"Hell yeah," Dean replied enthusiasticly. "You're missin' out, dude. You'll listen to Lizzo and Taylor Swift but not the gods of classic rock?"
He huffed, like a child. "Whatever. Point is, what you wanna say to him has to be spontaneous. You can't plan what you want to say to him. Just feel it. And say it."
"I am so," the rollerblader insisted. Cas gestured to the scrapes on his legs. They were cleaned up but now the scabs were an angry red. "Forget those were your fault?"
Dean huffed. "I am coming with you two. And there will be no funny business happening while I'm there."
They were on their bed, kissing, which was great. Kissing Dean was one of Cas's favorite activities. Dean was lying down, Cas on top of him, and they were both down to their boxers; Dean in his Scooby and Shaggy pair and Castiel with his new ones that had Tree frogs on them.
When Dean was done, they all went back into the living room to have their desserts and watch Scooby Doo, Where are You?, which Dean insisted was the best version  of the cartoon. "Nothing beats the original," he had stated.
The waitress left with the menus and Dean shook his head at Cas. "Well aren't you Mr. Health Conscious."
Castiel stilled and turned to him. "You mean I can't?" If Dean didn't know any better, he'd say Cas sounded hurt. The bed dipped with the man's weight and he pushed Dean's hands away to slide his shirt off. "How long is Sam staying?"
Dean rubbed his hands together. "Now you kids will see a how real player does it." His foot slid out from under him and he fell face first on to the mat.
Gabriel had thought, when he had finished his story, Kelly would pat his back awkwardly, or try to change the subject into something more cheerful. He didn't expect her to wrap her arms around him and rub her cheek against his.
Despite it not being that late, Dean actually felt tired. He stripped down to his boxers, flipped the light switch off, and crawled into the bed. He grabbed his pillow and hugged it tight before he fell asleep.
"Here is eighteen and nineteen: please let me us- cook in the kitchen. Please let me use the kitchen."
Gabriel stood, his chair scraping against the floor. "Alright. I think that's enough. Will you all excuse me for a moment." He strutted toward his brother and Dean and grabbed them each at the elbow, dragging them outside.
"Oh, I work at the hospital across the street on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Speaking of which, I should be getting back. It was nice to see you again."
The two of them spent the next few hours together; racing in the lake, a short hike in the woods, ordering sandwiches and eating them on Dean's bed. Sam had decided to stay in the living room after his swim, which was good for Dean because him and Cas traded quiet and sloppy handjobs on the bed.
Gabriel, his heart hammering in his chest, leaned forward as well, but then something he saw through the front window of the house caught his eye. "Is that Dean?"
"Take the wallet, put your shit inside, and come down for some pie and ice cream. I don't want to hear another wor-"
"I wanted to see you," he replied earnestly. "I've been texting and calling from my phone and Sam's and my dad's an-"
Dean shrugged one shoulder. "I don't want to spend the rest of my life changing lightbulbs at some dumb hotel. In fact, I went to see my parents after Amara canned me. They said they'd let me work in the bodyshop as long as I take business classes. So I can run it some day." He stood straighter, puffed out his chest. Proud.
Dean didn't know what to say to that. He couldn't imagine a world where his parents weren't a constant presence in his life. Even though he lived 15 minutes away from them, he saw them almost as much as he did when he lived at home.
Dean pointed his knife at his mom. "According to you, Robin was too clingy, Cassie was at a different place in her life, whatever that means, and Victor was too old. Am I missing anyone, Dad?"
Eventually, the boy finished and proudly showed his mom his empty plate. Carefully stacking the cutlery and cup on top of it, he headed off into the kitchen to put them in the sink.
Eileen joined in on the singing and Miracle sat quietly on the floor, head cocked in curiosity. Despite the rocky start to day, the joyful look on Sam's face told Dean the morning plan was successful.
Stepping inside his warm home, he hung his backpack on the hook near the door and headed into the living room. He sighed sadly when he saw his mom and Sam sleeping on the couch, Claire dozing in her playpen. It was a sight he'd been getting used to seeing.
The sudden urge to sneeze overwhelmed Dean and he pulled away, turned his head to the left, and gave three loud sneezes.
"No, Dean look." He showed him the toys again. "Look closely." He handed Dean the one that belonged to Cas. "Look."
Castiel had woken up early, as usual. The house was quiet and he tiptoed into the kitchen and got himself an apple and a glass of milk. When finished, he chugged two cups of water and tried to make as little noise as possible as he put away the clean dishes that had spent the night drying in the dishwasher, and he washed the ones that were in the sink.
Dean laughed quietly and looked at the burger on the plate. He squirted some ketchup on it and hesitantly picked it up. Swallowing nervously, he took a decent sized bite and ran his tongue along the piece in his mouth.
Rufus walked over to him and, to Castiel's surprise, squeezed his shoulder. "Keep your chin up, bud."
The sheriff's voice faded to a dull buzz floating aroind Dean's head. He watched her march Alastair to a stagecoach Dean hadn't noticed before. He squinted and concentrated hard at the words written on the door; Green Allium County Sheriff's Department. Two white horses attached to the coach stood patiently, one drinking from a bucket of water on the ground. Miracle sat at Dean's feet, head cocked and looking curiosly at the horses.
Dean swallowed. "Oh. Uhm... you don't have to go. Sam should, the max for a one bedroom is two people. But you can stay."
The referee's whistle echoed throughout the gym. Jack and his friends ran to their team's corner and squeezed between the turned over folding table and the wall. He glanced over at the other side of the gym, behind the short, broad rubber wall, where all the spectators were seated. Dean and Cas saw him and waved. Jack happily returned the wave, even though he was hoping to see his mom and Sam.
The doctor sat up a little straighter, narrowing his eyes. "That's a little bit inappropriate to ask isn't it?"
He was able to block the first three shots. A fourth one tapped his fingers and spun into the net. He stomped his feet a few times, and then put it out of his mind so he wouldn't miss again.
"That's just a typo. It's this ridiculous holiday the greeting card companies and florists cooked up together to turn a profit. It's a scam. You're almost four, how come you've never heard of it?"
Dean shurgged. "I-I didn't do a thing. I just sat in the car. I couldn't control where it went. And I didn't do it on purpose, ya know? So, like, I mean what he did was bad, like real bad. I don't stab people or steal."
In his bedroom, Castiel was putting his stuff in a somewhat neat pile in the corner next to Dean's closet. The duffel and the suitcase were open and he was folding clothes onto the floor.
Cas watched Dean for a couple minutes.  He looked so cute and relaxed while he was asleep. Pulling the blanket off him, Cas slapped Dean's right ass cheek.
He was hopping up and down, koala hat on his head and one arm shoved into his coat. "Cas, Cas, Cas! It's snowing, you have to come out, come on! Who is that? Who are you talking to?" Jack bounced his way closer and let out a squeal. "Dean!"
"I told him what really happened. That it was really my fault. I was worried he'd try to get you arrested."
"I am not on a side," Dean's dad insisted. "There's no side to take. I-I-I'm only stating facts. Look Mary, if you're so concerned about this guy's ethics or whatever, why don't you go out with them to, I don't know, talk to Cas alone? In fact, Dean, you said your roommates are taking you and him out to get drinks later, take your mother."
Gabriel shook his head. "When he was certain he was getting close, some dude named Joshua showed up at the motel he was stayin' at and gave him a note from dear ol' daddy, tellin' him to fuck off. Gave up after that. Like I said, no b-"
Upstairs were the three bedrooms. Each had a bed, dresser, small closet, and nightstand. John and Mary had chosen the one with the biggest bed and Jo had a room all to herself.
He spotted Dean's teammate, Caesar, grilling by one of the picnic tables. There were two plastic tables nearby full of food and drinks. Dean sat on the ground and took off his blades, shoving them back in his bag, and took off across the grass. Castiel followed behind at a considerably slow pace.
Dean took down a pink, purple, and blue striped vase his mom made for him in a pottery class she took a few years ago. It was dusty so he washed it off in the sink. He could feel Cas watching him, his laser-like focus on his movements. The older man didn't say a word, just stared at him. Dean cleared his throat as he dried off the outside of vase and filled it halfway.
Dean paused when he got to a picture posted by his friend Dirk. He was in the game room at the comic book shop they worked at, a Dungeons and Dragons game on the table. Their coworkers Samantha and Stuart were sitting across from him, and next to him was Cassie Robinson.
"Oh," the boy said again, quieter this time. He walked over to the table, dragging his feet and not caring if he messed up his slippers. He sat down on one of the chairs and lyed his head on his folded arms, staring sideways at Sam as he cooked.
Sam cracked his neck. "You wanna take off with her? Strike out on your own, just an old man and his hor-"
"Stupid baby," he grumbled. Him and Kevin had been having a lot of fun; there weren't any other kids at the park. It was nice hanging out with another boy, but he still wished Maggie had come.
Wordlessly, their son quickly got up and led the way to the door. Dean carried Claire, rubbing her back soothingly.
Jack had opened his door and the second his feet hit the grass he was swept up into a hug by Garth, lifting the boy up and letting his legs dangle above the ground.
He hesitated, looking back into the living room. They were still just laughing and talking. "Uhm... alright."
With his robe hanging open on his chilled body and his wet feet in his water shoes, Dean started the walk back to his chalet. Head down and arms crossed, he felt disappointed about how the night had gone. Cas probably thinks I'm just some dumb kid, he thought.
"Okay," Claire breathed.  She looked at the adult's phones, all placed on the kitchen island. "Which one belong to James?"
The conversations in the dining room and the sounds of cutlery clinking against plates ceased, and silence fell heavy in the air.
Claire sucked her teeth. "Small Dad once took my skateboard away, so to get back at him I put this plastic wrap on the toilet so that he ended up peeing everywhere. It was really funny!"
"I wish we could trade places," he said to Felix, who was wrapped around his neck like a scaly yet comforting necklace. "I'd love to just sit in a box all day and do nothing."
Dean's eyebrows raised. "Buncha pigs, the lot of them... oh! Where the damn hell are my manne- Cas come meet everyone." He pulled the doctor closer to the other firefighters and pointed to each in turn. "You already know Benny. And that's Layla, Stevie, Jesse, Rufus, Linda, and Annie. And uh..." Dean looked around. "The captain... is... Where's Bobby?"
Cas covered his mouth to stifle a laugh. He had to admit Dean was inconsistent with what their girl could and could not eat for a snack. It seemed to change ever week. Some days he said she could eat string beans some days he said she couldn't.
It was a little past two the next day when they finally got back, and Castiel heated up the chicken noodle soup he had made, and they ate it in the "Dean Cave" while watching Scooby Doo on Zombie Island. Dean took the longest in eating his lunch because he kept picking out the vegetables.
Cas grinned.  "It's kind of hot in here." He peeled off his shirt and locked eyes with Dean, who promptly walked right into the door.
Castiel nodded seriously, as if he understood. Again, he'd forgotten what Dean did for a living, which was weird because he'd been to Sandover several times visiting his uncle, Dean's boss, to beg for money. He was probably high. No, he was definitely high.
Halfway through the second chorus he felt a tap on his shoulder and Dean turned to see his mom standing next him, swaying slightly on her feet, Cas standing awkwardly on the steps to the stage.
"Marvin the landlord is a prissy little princess with a vendetta against marijuana... and yes, not paying rent was a factor. The gym does not pay much."
When they finally calmed down, Maggie went over to Felix's glass case and, with Jack's permission, wrapped him around her neck . She snatched the spinner fron the floor and flicked it.  "Right foot blue, Dean."
Bones sat at Eileen's feet, tail wagging and panting. Banshee was curled up in Miracle's bed by the armchair, eyes closed. Miracle saw how stiff the two humans were sitting, a lot different than his daddy and Cas; they couldn't sit on the couch without touching one other.
Jack hopped happily back to the house with his grandmother, and Charlie gave Cas one last look before following them.
On Sunday evening, Jack and Maggie were in her room eating lunch. Kevin was at a dental appointment with his mom.
Then Dean heard the soft click of the lube bottle and only a few seconds later he felt one of Castiels fingers playing around his hole. Carefully, Cas pushed the finger inside. The sensation was a little bit odd at first, but it got better and better when he pushed it in and out.
"I don't understand the problem. We could just start harvesting early. Then we'll have plenty of time till the weather changes." Dean countered.
“Fuck Cas! Did you really think I would just leave you after last night?” Dean knew there was no point in getting angry now, but he just couldn’t help it.
"We didn't just buy it with the money from Dad. Cas also had some savings. How will Dad react when he finds out we're getting married?" said Dean.
In a far back corner of his brain, there was a little voice reminding him that Jo was in the house, that she was probably wondering where he was, that she might hear them. But all these thoughts vanished into thin air as Castiel's hands slipped under his T-shirt caressing his stomach.
He knew he should have been embarrassed because his voice sounded so incredibly needy, but he didn’t care.
What the hell was he gonna write? It was almost funny. He should write about Soulmates. The first part wasn't a problem. He described the historical and scientific facts known about the phenomenon. The problem was the second part, which was about his personal experience or his opinion. And there was the crux of the matter. He had actually finished the whole essay, but the second part was too personal. Mrs Johnson would know right away who he was writing about. So he had to rewrite it. But he didn't know how. He only knew he had to change it.
Hastily both slipped out of their T-shirts and pants so that they could lie down on the bed dressed only in their underwear.
“No! Oh, my God. I am so sorry Cas. Of course, helping me is the last thing you would want to do…” Dean wasn't even able to look Cas in the eye.
Wow! So Dean had not only left, he had moved out. Cas wondered why it hurt him so much. After all, he was about to do the same thing.  It was just the logical consequence.
"Stop lying! Even though I can’t smell your Omega scent because you are wearing scentblockers I smell Alpha arousal in every corner of this room. So stop denying it. "
The problem was Dean's damn loyalty to his friends. Jody and Castiel were very sure that Dick Roman's son and the whole gang had something to do with the fires.
"Fuck you, Dean Winchester! You can’t decide what I do. And don’t you dare to blackmail me because you know my secret."
Oh God, how long had he waited to hear those words and now? Now they felt completely wrong. Why would Dean suddenly fall in love with him? That didn’t make any sense at all. Dean wasn't into men.
Ellen always had a soft spot for the boy, even though he had caused her enough trouble, and when he buried his face in her neck and whispered that he loved her and whirled her around in the air afterwards without any warning, Jody could well imagine why. Dean Winchester had his heart in the right place, he was just unlucky with his choice of friends, that's all. But Jody was very sure that this was about to change because Castiel was certainly a good influence.
It took them some time to get back from their heights. Dean managed to roll behind him so they were able to spoon.
"Might be. But I don't care, Sam. Honestly, it's not that bad. It's saving me some pain. Physically and psychologically. Dean doesn't want me, and my inner omega doesn't seem to want to suffer. " He shrugged.
"Dean was in a car accident. I was still registered as his emergency contact. The nurse wasn't allowed to give me any details, but apparently, he's not in any danger of his life. He is really in Santa Cruz, Charlie. I knew it. "
“Oh, fuck, oh God, Alpha!” Dean cried. He knew he sounded like an Omega in heat but he couldn’t care less when he heard Castiel's moan.
Dean was getting ready for the party and disappeared from their dorm as quickly as possible. The party at the frathouse was just the right thing for tonight. He'd get wasted and disappear upstairs with some beta. That would distract him. Yeah, that's what he'd do.
"Mr Novak. Mr Winchester's brother arrived an hour ago. If you want to wait, I will tell him you are here."
"Dean's Dad won't let the Male Omega Care Organization into their house. Since there are no more Omegas in Dean's family, Sam would be on his own. I'm sure it's not easy without someone who understands you, who tells you what to do. No one expected him to be an Omega."
"Dean, please. . . I need. . . Ahh. . . " Cas was babbling now but he knew that Dean would like to prepare him properly because he wouldn't want to hurt him. The Alpha knew that Cas was a virgin. Careful Dean pushed one finger inside. The sensation was a little bit odd at first, but it got better and better. When Dean pushed a second finger inside Cas was already squirming.
Slowly he turned to the other man. Cas leaned in the doorway and looked at him strangely. His gaze was as intense as if he was trying to fathom Dean's insides. It took Dean all his willpower not to go to him and bury his face in his neck to smell him even better. But before he could embarrass himself, the doorbell rang. Thank God!
“Yeah… there… there is some kind of tickling inside of me. I don’t know how to describe it. It’s like a fading anaesthetic syringe after the dentist.” Dean tried to explain.
"Yeah, it's all right, Ma. I'm just tired and not hungry. I think I'll go straight to bed if you don't mind. "
When Cas thrust a second finger inside, Dean was already squirming. Then Cas found the special point inside of Dean that had him see stars.
"Good! I have thought about buying something like that myself, but I didn't dare to leave Sam alone. So thank you!"
Unfortunately, the next day it turned out that it wasn’t that easy. Of course, it wasn’t. Why did he even think about this possibility for one second?
It was like everything beautiful and good just got sucked out of him. That must be how Harry Potter felt when he was attacked by the dementors, Dean thought. He was so busy dealing with the deep pain in his soul that he didn't even notice Cas bite.
Before he could embarrass himself even more and do something stupid, he went to the bathroom and clashed the door behind him. Tonight at the party he would screw someone. No matter who it was, maybe Lisa. The Beta flirted with him for weeks. Or maybe he would break his rule and sleep with Aaron. He knew the Omega wanted him.
But I have to admit that I changed my mind now that we met.Okay, you are a little bit nerdy with your glasses,
“I would touch you everywhere. I would play with your nipples while I kiss your neck and your shoulders. Then my mouth would follow my fingers to your nipples. I would tease them with my tongue and my teeth.”
At that moment Dean saw Mr Novak leaning in the doorframe staring at him. Dean knew what he really wished but he also knew that he wouldn’t get it. When they were younger Jo always told him how curious she was about her soulmate and how romantic it was to finally meet them. Dean often teased her being cheesy. But now all he wanted was this man to be his. The thought confused and annoyed him at the same time. It was pathetic. Why couldn’t he just let go?
Yes, of course, this was a good explanation, but somehow Cas couldn’t choke the emotion that this had nothing to do with the music lessons or Dean’s pleasure in writing. The boy was avoiding him. He did so since Cas arrived. Cas rarely saw him when he was at the Winchesters house. He knew it had to do with his marriage. But why did Dean care? Why did his mother care? Cas had no idea. When he saw the boy for the first time he was surprised that he was so attracted to him. Yes, of course, Dean Winchester was attractive and Cas was always more attracted to men than to women but that wasn’t the point. There was something about Dean that pulled Cas towards the boy. And so he found himself disappointed when a day passed in which he didn’t see him. To be honest, he was looking forward to seeing him in his class. Damn it!
"I think you're not the only one who wonders what’s going on with Dean Winchester. I have seen him at many parties. Most of the time he was sitting in a corner making out, or he disappeared in one of the upper rooms with his squeeze. "
”Don’t stop, Dean I beg you… don’t… I…“ Cas cried shamelessly, shaking apart beneath Dean. After another moment he came all over their joined hands in thick ropes. Dean’s breath hitched. ”Fuuck!“ he cried.
Maybe he should try to have a neutral conversation at first. Castiel starts to put his stuff away, ignoring him as much as possible. Okay, this was not the right way. He had to play with open cards.
Charlie opened the door. She hadn't spoken a word to him since the party, although he had apologized to her a hundred times. But who could blame her? It was a dick move to leave his own party.
“Cas, that’s not fair, you know that is not the case. It was hard for him to let you go. That’s the reason why I told him about Balthazar when we thought he could be the one…”
There was a pause behind the door and Cas knew that Sam was coming closer to smell if he really was an Omega. After a few moments, Castiel heard the key turning around.
When Dean was feeling his knot forming he wanted to move away a little bit so his knot wouldn’t be locked in the Omega. But Cas embraced Deans hips with his legs and pushed him even closer.
Determined, he walked downstairs and knocked on Dean's door. He was too impatient to wait for an answer and so he just went into the room. Dean was sitting on his bed already in his pyjamas.  Surprised he jumped off the bed.
All of a sudden Cas felt exhausted. This was just too much. First the shocking news about Dean and Lisa moving in together, then the accident and now Meg had told Dean that Castiel was in love with him. He was afraid to go back to his apartment where Dean was waiting for him. Fuck! This wasn't fair! He couldn't lose Dean!
He noticed Dean didn't look happy at all. He also avoided looking directly at Castiel. Was it possible that Dean was really his soulmate? Okay, maybe the idea was a little far-fetched since there was no evidence for his theory. It was just a feeling, but he felt new hope sprouting in him. If it really was Dean, he might have a chance to talk to him. Maybe it was all just a misunderstanding. Dean was only eighteen. It might be possible that he just overreacted. If the boy really was his soulmate, the fact that Cas was married must have hurt him. Gabriel might have been right. Maybe it wasn't the best idea to marry Meg. But he had never thought of the possibility that his soulmate wouldn't talk to him, that he would act so drastic. He had expected to be confronted by them about the fact that he was married and he thought that there would be a chance to explain.  It was almost funny. Cas was always an A grade student, but he wasn't smart enough to imagine that his soulmate could be so hurt that he wouldn't even give him a chance to explain. Why had he never considered this possibility?
Somehow everything Sam said made sense. It explained the strange fact that Cas felt so numb that he wasn't sad or desperate and that he didn't miss Dean. His inner Omega decided that it would not exist any longer. Like there would be no need of an inner Omega any longer now that he's been rejected by his matching Alpha. His first reaction was to panic. However, he quickly calmed down again. Actually, this was not a bad thing. Maybe it was the best thing that could have happened to him in this situation. From his biology lessons at school, he knew that he would still be able to have sex and feel pleasure. However, he wouldn’t be able to love or feel that he belonged to someone in the future. But wasn't that good? After all, it saved him a lot of suffering. How would he feel right now if he wasn't in full rejection? Surely he would be at the beginning of a terribly painful heat in the hospital. No. This here was clearly better.
"Hey... Dean. Please look at me," Cas said and took Dean's face in both hands. Tenderly he stroked Dean's cheeks with his thumbs.
Hell, Dean was only five when Mum died! Of course, Dad’s fate had a big influence on Dean. And now he is afraid he is gonna end up like Dad. He's so afraid of loving someone that he tries to prevent it. Of course, a true mate must scare him to death."
". . . but your thoughts are with your soulmate. I know Dean and I understand. When are you planning on talking to him, Dean? It's Friday today. You know I said I would give you time until Sunday, then I'll take care of it. "
And now the time had come for him to realize that the little voice was right. He wasn't good enough for Cas. Somewhere out there was Castiel’s true mate. Dean was not allowed to stand in the way of the Omega’s happiness. He had no right to put his own needs above Cas's.
"Yes, I can understand that. The last days before birth are exhausting, especially in this heat. Let's get you a beer. You can have one, can't you?" Ellen wanted to know.
"But that's not possible. Only true mates can sense when their partner is in danger. We are not true mates. I bit you, we would know if..."
Suddenly Dean realized that he was shirtless. He was standing half-naked in a room with an Omega whose scent was driving him crazy even if he used scent blockers. This was not the best idea. Quickly he went back to his bed to put on a t-shirt.
But the bathroom was also empty. He frowned in confusion. If only he could remember something. But his brain was still refusing service. So he put the coffee maker on and took a shower afterwards.
“Dean, Alpha, please…I need… I want to present for you.” He mumbled when they pulled away to catch their breaths.
"The honour is all mine, Mr Winchester. I'm glad for Sam you didn't call the Omega Health Care Service. I have to admit, I don't associate good memories with the service. "
"Fuck you, Dean Winchester! You can’t decide what I do. And don’t you dare to blackmail me because you know my secret."
“Yes, I am. I won’t let him go without a fight. Maybe we will break up in the end but he has to look at me and tell me face to face that he doesn’t want me anymore.”
Cas stopped as if rooted to the spot and stared at Dean. It only took a few moments for the other man to approach him and to hug him.
Dean knew there was a logical explanation behind all this, but his brain wasn't capable of putting all the pieces together.
Dean knew he'd have to spend his savings to pay for the tattoo. Actually, he wanted to use the money for new tires. But that would have to wait. Maybe he could do some extra shifts at the garage.
“Yes, please. I could really use a cup of coffee right now. I wasn’t able to get much sleep in the last few weeks.“
"Dean! Please tell me what's going on." Cas said. He seemed to be worried and reached for Dean's shoulders. That's when he saw it. The tattoo on Cas's hand. The two white wings were back. With both hands, Dean reached for his soulmate's hand.
Dean knelt next to him and watched each of his movements with hungry eyes. After a while, he added a second finger and grabbed Cas cock with his other hand. Then he slowly took him into his mouth and sucked.
Before Cas had the courage to say anything, the doorbell rang. Dean seemed to be glad about the interruption. Cas could smell his relief. Besides, the Alpha almost ran to the door.
„Good,“ Cas replied satisfied. „Because I am not planning on letting you go. Even if I sound like Annie Wilkes from Misery.“
“Good, Castiel. Welcome to the family. I must confess, at first I wasn't exactly pleased by the fact that you were Dean's soulmate. I had imagined it differently. I thought Dean was gonna settle down with a pretty girl and get me some grandchildren. I would never have thought that one of my sons could have a male soulmate.”
“And I love wearing them.” Cas slipped into Dean’s grey AC/DC t-shirt and came back to the bed afterwards to kiss Dean.
"You look good and Novak is gay. So, if you play your cards right, maybe you won't have to work so hard. . . " Crowley smirked.
“I thought you were Mr Novak's soulmate, sweetheart. And I am so glad that you are not. Something really bad happened to the poor man today and I am really grateful you are not the reason for his suffering.”
"What the heck, Dean? I confessed my feelings for you only a few weeks ago. Do you really think I can just turn them off after all this time? Of course I'm not in love with Balthazar, but who knows? Maybe I'll get there one day," Cas explained much calmer than he really felt.
“He is gone! He left me because of the heat delirium, didn’t he? It’s all my fault. It’s my….it’s my fucking fault. I pushed away the one person I love more than anything else because I couldn’t control my stupid body. He must hate me.”
With a sigh, Dean slipped into a T-shirt and jeans and ran downstairs. It was the last Saturday of winter break and actually, he would have preferred to sleep in, but his mother had to insist that the whole family would be there to welcome Mr Novak.  It was strange enough that a stranger should live with them under one roof. Well, it wasn't weird with Benny. But Benny was just Benny and he was not his English teacher. The lodgers always lived in the attic. There they had everything they needed, including a bathroom and kitchen facilities. Actually, the attic was meant for him. He had expanded it together with his father and uncle Bobby. But then the accident happened and everything was different. It was okay. Dean wouldn't be here after the summer break. If everything went well, he'd go to Pasadena College on a sports scholarship. That was his plan, anyway. Dean couldn't suppress a groan when the doorbell rang.
But even if he wanted nothing more than to take everything Cas was willing to give, he was scared to death at the thought. This wouldn’t be a normal hook up. It would be so much more. He knew he would end up mated to this gorgeous Omega. But this was the problem.
Dean sat down on his bed and desperately drove his hand through his hair.  He might have had a chance if he hadn't reacted so incredibly stupid. But now?
No, this couldn’t be true! Was Charlie really right? Did he overreact? No! He didn’t. The guy said he didn’t want to be with his soulmate. Okay, that were not the exact words but the meaning was clear.
"You mentioned you didn't want to have anything to do with Omegas. But how does this even work with a Beta? You can't knot a Beta." Cas thought aloud.
Cas could only return the hug timidly. Not only because he didn't know how to deal with the situation, but also because everything hurt from the accident.
"Okay, you're right. It would be nice if you could come with me, but please let me say again how sorry I am about everything. "
But for the first time since he was a child, Dean doesn’t have to stop at enough. He doesn’t have to accept the bare minimum. He presses his lips against Cas’s and doesn’t even feel embarrassed at the tears he knows are falling from his eyes onto Cas’s cheeks. It doesn’t feel wrong, or uncertain, or any of the things Dean has told himself repeatedly to keep himself from doing exactly this.
“Do you think I don’t know, Dean? Do you think I don’t see the way you carry around that jacket like your life depends on it? Do you think I didn’t see the way that you used to look at him?”
Cas watches in amusement as the little girl continues soothing her nervous father. Her nervous, yet very handsome father. Cas shakes his head--best not think those kinds of thoughts of a man he may never see again, who also has a child and most likely a wife.
Castiel sets his bag of groceries down on the shoveled and dry sidewalk--Dean can barely see the items inside of it: two boxes of Christmas lights, a can of something that looks like whipped cream, and a package of toilet paper. Is it suspicious? No. Is Dean upset that there’s no pie in the bag? Yes.
“Well, I guess I can probably work my busy schedule around this business. It might take some persuading, though…”
It’s only about a minute more before the theme song to another cartoon starts playing on the television and Jack squirms out of Sam’s arms to go watch.
Cas pretends Dean is travelling. Pretends he’s driving down the backroads of Nowhere, USA with his obnoxious rock music playing from the speakers in the Impala. But whenever Cas catches a glimpse of the picture on the fireplace, the one with Dean in uniform standing stiffly in front of an American flag, he’s reminded that Dean is overseas, with nothing but a small, torn up picture of his daughter and husband to make him feel safe.
“Sam, you’ve gotta calm down. Dean is your brother, okay? And I know I don’t know him, but from what you’ve told me, he loves you. So let’s just see this through--see how things pan out.” Sarah holds on tightly to Sam’s arm which comforts him more than she can know.
“So, it’s good to see you happy, Dean.” Sam says, joining Dean outside of the restaurant. He left a few moments ago, said he needed some air. Cas offered to join but Dean declined with a smile.
But then, on Sunday, Sam drank himself stupid and booked a one-way ticket for a flight to Bloomington, Illinois because that was the only thing he could think of that might make sense. When he woke up the next day, having completely forgotten the purchase, he got a confirmation text. Rather than cancelling it and getting his money back while he still could, he threw a bunch of shit into a suitcase and decided to go for it.
Something about that, something about Cas thinking he’s expendable, really pisses Dean off. “Are you kidding?” he asks. He grabs Cas’s hands, using them as leverage so he can put his wait over Cas without actually straining himself. He gets closer and closer until his face is only an inch away from Cas’s. “You’re not going anywhere. Don’t you ever do something like that again, you hear me?”
Even when they were figuring out some of the funeral things, it was all just over email. Dean claimed to have gotten Sam’s email address from a friend of his named Charlie, and Sam doesn’t question how this Charlie got it
“Don’t know what you’re talking about, I’m just here for some coffee.” He jokes, but it’s in good nature.
He keeps bringing them up, hoping Dean will show some sign of pain or grief, but he doesn’t. And Sam doesn’t care about the looks Dean gives him when he mentions bringing Cas back. He knows his brother better than he knows himself. He knows Dean is afraid of hoping, afraid of wanting, only to be let down. But Sam also knows that they owe it to Cas to try, because Cas never stopped trying for them.
“I’m Chaplin Lafitte,” the man who spoke earlier said. “We understand that you’ve been aware of your husband’s missing status for the past few months?” Cas nods. “We have good news, Mr. Winchester: Lieutenant Colonel Dean Winchester is alive.”
“I don’t know what to do, Cas. I just… I didn’t expect to cry. I thought I was fine, that I wasn’t going to care, but I care so much”.
“That was then. I’m glad you asked. Oh, Sarah, am I going to be dancing with a pretty friend of yours? A sister, maybe?” Dean asks with a wink.
Now, however, Dean is beginning to regret it. Sam has absolutely no idea how to comfort his nervous brother. Normally, Dean would turn to Cas when his palms start sweating or when his throat starts closing up but no, of course Cas is a traditional bastard who thinks he and Dean should get ready for their wedding in separate rooms. And Dean tried to tell him. He tried to tell Cas that ain’t nothing traditional about this wedding, but the other man wouldn’t have it.
And Dean, Dean should have known that it was too good to be true. The spell was too easy, too fast, too perfect. That should have told him. That should have told Sam.
Everyone raises their glasses and Dean stands up to hug his brother. He makes a joke about “chick-flick moments” and Sam punches him in the shoulder, but the sentiment is still lingering and Dean sits back down with a smile on his face. Cas takes Dean’s hand in his own and kisses it, smile very prominent on his face.
Cas threads his hand through Dean’s hair, holding so tight it would hurt if not for Dean’s complete and utter focus on the feeling of Cas’s cracked, full lips against his. Their hands are still clasped together and Dean’s knee which rests on the bed is pressed up against the side of Cas’ thigh.
As things start becoming clearer, Dean realizes that he’s lying down right by a sewage drain on the side of the road.
“‘M fine, let’s go.” Sure, Dean was hit by an ugly ass prius and probably broke his entire body, but he’s not gonna let his dignity disappear as far as to let the guy wheel him into the ER.
When Dean was deployed the first time, it hadn’t been for longer than a few months. The second time, it had been roughly seven months. It was hard, yes, but the waiting was never this bad before.
“Come here, little bee,” Cas is saying to the boy, pulling him from Dean’s arms. He goes easy, turning his head so it’s now pressed into Cas’s shoulder. “Let’s go watch some cartoons.” Cas carries the boy out of the room and Dean watches until they’re both out of sight.
When the flight begins to take off, the little girl giggles as though she’s on a roller coaster and her father grips the armrests so tight, his knuckles are visibly white. The man looks up and around like he’s trying to see if anyone else is freaking out, but no one is. When he looks in his direction, Cas finally gets a full view of the man’s face. Which happens to be even more attractive than he initially thought. He’s probably around Cas’s age, but his face still looks young for being near thirty-years-old. His hair is a sandy color and his eyes are bright green.
John’s being lowered into the ground and Pastor Jim is asking everyone to pray with him when Dean decides he can’t take it anymore. He walks away and leans against a tree that’s far enough away so that he can’t hear what’s being said.
“Is that—are you married?” Sam asks, not bothering to mask the surprise that’s most definitely showing on his face.
Dean waits outside for Cas, stomping out the cigarette he just finished. He’s stressed, otherwise there wouldn’t be a cigarette to stomp out. Not only has his father just died from a heart attack (of all the things), but he has to deal with Sam, and he’s not entirely sure how happy Sam is about seeing him again.
Ultimately, Sam is persuaded to knock when an elderly woman walking her dog across the street starts giving him suspicious looks. He worries that she’s a moment away from going back to her house and calling the police to report him for loitering, so he grabs his bag, hauls it to the front door, and, before he can back out, knocks.
Cas laughs at their dynamic but then becomes genuinely concerned that Dean is going to either have a heart attack or start screaming. “You know, the likelihood of this plane crashing is slim to none,” he tells him, hoping to calm him down.
“Dean, wait up—” Sam called, but Dean didn’t stop. He stormed up to the door of the bunker, ignoring the sound of his brother running to catch up to him.
Slowly, Cas pulls one of his hands from Dean’s grasp, sliding it up his arm and stopping only when he gets to the back of his neck. Dean waits for a moment, thinking that if he was to die right now, it would be enough. It would be enough for Cas to know that he’s loved.
“Fuck, I feel like I got hit by a car,” he moans, squinting his eyes in an attempt to get them to focus.
“Fine, don’t. But I am. You can wait in the car.” Dean doesn’t move and neither does Sam. “Why don’t you just admit it?”
Cas tried not to fear that Dean would be different. He tried to no avail. What if the things he had seen messed him up too much? What if he didn’t want Cas anymore? What if Dean wasn’t even Dean?
It’s virtually the same question Cas asked earlier, so the words “I didn’t want to be alone,” come easily.
After a short time in the car, Sam pulls into the parking lot of a chain restaurant he’s been to a few times before. For a brief moment, he thinks--hopes--maybe Dean hasn’t shown up, but one glance through the parking lot reveals the massive Impala Dean’s devoted his life to. He sits for a moment, not wanting to get out of the car.
“Just… come here.” Dean says, pulling Cas up from where he was sitting on the bed. Their lips collide almost immediately. Dean groans against Cas’s lips, feeling comfortable for the first time tonight. Cas gently nibbles on Dean’s lips, not wasting time to run his hands down his boyfriend’s back to grip his ass. Dean pulls Cas down onto the bed.
“So is Dean, though he refuses to admit as such.” Cas deadpans. He takes a sip from his drink and then continues. “He often forces me to have Star Wars marathons, regardless of having seen them multiple times”.
As both Dean and his husband are pelted in every part of the body, they rush up to the front porch of the house and run inside as quickly as possible. Even after they’re standing in the warm, heated house, a few snowballs are launched at the door.
“No,” Dean says, trying again to push himself up, using a different arm this time. He gets into a crouching position and then falls over, too dizzy to be entirely upright. Dean leans back against the curb and pulls one knee up, leaning his elbow on it and putting his head on his hand. Immediately, he pulls his hand away due to feeling something wet and sticky. When he looks, he sees bright red blood on his palm and leans over to throw up.
The plane jerks to the side a little bit, and Cas looks to Dean immediately to see him clenching his eyes closed again and gripping the armrests once more. “Shit,” he all but shouts.
“Charlie works with Cas,” Dean says. Sam nods, realizing he doesn’t know what Cas’s job is. Or Dean’s, for that matter.
Sam wasn’t expecting anything like this. He’d imagined Dean living in a small, shabby apartment at most. Maybe he would have a few friends, or even a job, but this? An entire life—a world Sam isn’t a part of… it hurts just as much as it makes him happy.
For the first time in his life, happiness feels more than just an emotion. It’s a state of being. It’s a part of Dean.
“I just woke up, and we haven’t spent any time apart since the last time you asked me, what do you think?”
“Cas writes about angels and demons.” Dean announces with a proud grin. “He’s practically famous but you wouldn’t know because he writes under a pseudonym.” Sam notes that his brother and Cas seem keen on bragging about each other’s success.
The first thing Cas notices is an annoying wetness. His fingers are sweaty and so is his forehead, but he’s freezing. It doesn’t make sense. Neither does the hollow pit in his stomach, the rumbling of his organs, or the ache filling his body.
Slowly, Dean raises his eyes to see who the voice belongs to: One grumpy looking Castiel Novak, standing on the sidewalk, holding a brown paper bag of groceries and sporting a face full of snow. Dean almost feels bad.
“Now we’re here. You know, I never pictured myself as a father. I don’t know, maybe I always wanted it, but I just didn’t think it was in the cards for me. But I wouldn’t change it for the world.”
Surprisingly, he has a good time. Dean turns on some music from a speaker above the fridge and Sam is actually relieved to learn that Dean is still playing his mullet rock, no matter how different he may seem.
Dean kneels down beside the bed so that Cas doesn’t have to strain to see him. “Cas, what do you remember?”
He’d noticed earlier that the house is cluttered in photographs, but he hadn’t seen the one on the table beside the couch until now. It’s one of the few pictures that survived the fire back in Lawrence, only it’s blown up so it’s big enough to fit a frame. Sam, Dean, and their parents are standing in front of a tree outside of their house, smiling at the camera.
Dean smiles at that and the two then exchange phone numbers. As Cas is driving his car home that night, he thinks he really does love flying.
Dean slams the car door behind him and barely takes a moment to feel bad about it. Sam is calling his name but he doesn’t care. Sam wanted him to be miserable? Well, he got his damn wish.
It’s dark, but Sam can still see the tips of Dean’s ears go pink. “Right, I guess I kept that secret pretty well, huh?”
As Dean drives, he goes on and on about how it’s like old times, how surprised he is that his FBI suit still fits, how he can’t wait to get some good ol’ monster guts on his hands. But that’s the thing: this isn’t supposed to be like old times. They’ve been doing this their whole lives, they just defeated God—they deserve a little more new than some hick pie festival. Sam plays along because he knows Dean will back out if he knows what Sam’s real goal is.
