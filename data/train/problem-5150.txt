It's made of lace, and the lace instantly makes him think of his afternoon in the garden with Steve; it has beautiful, delicate flowers embroidered through it.
Tony pauses thoughtfully, using a knife to smear a tiny bit of butter onto some bread. "I'd heard… well, I'd heard something about an elixir? I heard a lot of things about what it did to you, which obviously aren't true, but I wondered, is there any truth to it at all?"
He knows some of his proclivities are, if not dangerous, at least unusual for an Omega. Technically, what he's doing isn't against the laws of the land. He can read whatever books he likes, learn whatever he wants to learn about engineering and science. He can draw his blueprints, come up with his mathematical theories, it doesn't matter.
"May I?" he asks, voice husky. Tony nods, eyes wide. He licks at his swollen lips, and Steve keeps his eyes on Tony's face when he undoes the buttons and ties at his waist.
. You want courting and grand, sweeping gestures and violin music. Not some Omega Consort from Starkland you've never met, that you may not even
The rest of the trip is hard and boring and, yes, cold. They make their way around the mountains and through the swamplands. By the time they get through to where the farming villages and towns begin, Tony has gone through almost all the books he'd brought along for the trip. He has more in his trunks, of course – science and math and engineering texts that he'd had Rhodey procure for him in secret because, of
Steve uses his fingers and his tongue to work Tony open, licking and thrusting and sliding in and out. He pushes in, deeply, with his fingers, rubs the pads of his fingers over Tony's prostate, and Tony howls, his whole body bowing on the bed. Steve can feel his balls and cock pulsing, feel the hot dampness of Tony's come hit the inside of the lace where he's still covered. Tony writhes, his hole clenching around Steve's fingers, and the sudden rush of slick coats Steve's lips and chin. He licks it up messily, revelling in the taste of Tony's obvious pleasure.
Pepper pauses. "I don't know. It hurts for some, and not for others. You'll just have to breathe, and relax, and hope."
And a bondless Consort? He'd be relegated to the streets in no time, nothing for him to do about it but beg for scraps in bad neighbourhoods.
, baby. And, I mean, you're good and all but think of how many things this one has learned at Omega Sex School."
"Now, what can I do for you?" Tony asks, gesturing to a chair for Steve to sit down. Tony remains standing until Steve is seated, then sits across from him.
Tony's return kiss is beyond enthusiastic, his lips and tongue desperate and hot – either uncaring about the taste of his own slick on Steve's lips, or excited by it. He surges up, pushing Steve back on the bed, rolling over to straddle him. Tony's fingers work frantically at Steve's clothes, pulling his shirt up over his head, then working at his pants. He pulls them down and off in a hurry, moving with them, then looks up at Steve's body. Steve doesn't shy away, unbothered by his nakedness. His cock is standing tall and proud, slick at the tip with pre-come.
"I'm sorry, Tony, we didn't mean to wake you," Steve says, ushering Tony back into the bedroom. Tony's own cheeks heat up a little – had coming out of the bedroom somehow made Steve look weak or foolish in front of one of his subjects? Maybe Steve had wanted to keep their heat-related activities under wraps. So no one would know he'd taken pleasure in Tony's body?
He wishes his mother were still alive – she probably would have convinced Howard not to send him out to the coast, to some shitty little fishing village and its so-called 'lord'. Hell, Maria might have even managed to convince Howard not to send Tony to the Academy at all.
He shoves the thought away, unable to deal with the possibility that Tony's heat is the only reason Tony would be in Steve's bed. It's true, at least, that his heat is the reason Tony had
He pops his head up from the nest of blankets to see if he can find Steve. Maybe Steve had gotten out of bed to secure them some breakfast. Tony hadn't eaten much over the past few days, his heat pushing aside any appetite, and now he's ravenous. He'd seen all manner of delicate pastries in Steve's rooms over the past two days, and his stomach growls hopefully as he looks around.
"I don't want you to tell me what I want to hear," Steve says, sliding his hands around to Tony's back, and then, finally, to his gorgeous, full ass. He squeezes it in his hands, basks in the scent of slick arousal. "I want you to tell me what
"It was fine. Uneventful, mostly – we'd have been better served if we'd brought Nat out with us. She's the better interrogator."
"Sure," Steve says. "But what I did… what I was able to do. I didn't do it alone, Tony. I didn't – I didn't
"He had to go, Pepper. I thought he wanted me to go with him but he said it's too – but it doesn't matter, this is good, right? I mean, now I don't have to, like, be at his beck and call, and whatever. I'm free to read and, and get to know the castle a little better, and do whatever I want without having to, to go see to my Alpha's cock, or anything–"
Natasha is watching him carefully, scrutinizingly, but she doesn't say anything more. Tony gets the feeling she's examining him, cataloguing his responses, reading his mind. He doesn't want her to know what's going through his head right now, though, so he takes another sip of his tea, changing the subject.
As Steve fucks him, hard and fast, Tony's ass leaks slick and Steve's own spent come. Transfixed, Steve reaches down and swipes his fingers through the pool of it and brings his fingers up to Tony's lips.
"It's too much, I can't – I can't take it," Tony whines, even as his cock throbs, desperately trying to get hard again. His ass clenches around Steve's cock.
"Man, you get all the good things," Clint sighs theatrically. "You got all the enhanced muscles, you got the fancy castle, the kingdom, and now you're getting the mail order bondmate… Sometimes I really wanna be you, man."
"We'll have to consummate the bond," Steve finally says, keeping his voice gentle. "But after that, if you don't want–"
The training centres in Krasnyygorod had long been a terrible story told to misbehaving Omegas in Starkland. Not as a threat, of course – that would have been cruel – but as a cautionary tale. 'Sure, you can't be a doctor, but at least you don't live in
Steve rolls away, laughing, and starts on his own shirt, working at the fastenings of his pants, and gives Tony a heated look. "This will be much faster if you undress yourself," he says.
The entire Kingdom was aware of King Howard and Queen Maria's plight when it had come to producing an heir. Queen Maria had suffered miscarriage after miscarriage before she'd produced a successful live birth. The child had been a male Omega, much to the consternation of King Howard.
Steve is in the living space, hunched over a low table. Sitting across from him is Wilson, looking grim. Tony's glad he'd taken the time to cover up the worst of his nudity.
Bucky nods, taking another large bite of the raspberry cream pastry. "You're right, that would be stupid. Okay, tell you what – I'll eat all the pastries, and if I don't die you'll know they weren't poisoned."
Actually, the whole crowd seems disinterested, and Dr. Banner speaks as quickly and as quietly as possible, looking nervous and uncomfortable, and then… it's over. Banner is walking down the steps in the square, off the raised area, and Tony, with nothing better to do, follows after him, blinking.
Sam, again, doesn't wait for an answer. "So as far as Prince Anthony knows, you're some scary lord who's going to treat him the way he's been taught to expect – like his wants and needs are secondary, unimportant, and he's not much more than a body to warm your bed."
It's days later when he receives word – through Rhodey – that Steve has returned. In fact, Steve arrives home and heads straight to his own rooms. Tony expects to hear from him, to be summoned to him, something. But nothing happens. Steve arrives home, and simply… goes about his business.
Wilson shows Pepper and Rhodey their rooms, and Tony has to admit he's impressed. They're not richly furnished or anything, but they're large and aboveground, which is more than he can say for the rooms Howard had allowed them at home. Tiny, dusty, dank little closets, those had been.
Steve moves in his sleep, tightening his arms around Tony's body, and Tony likes this, too. The feeling of being possessed, of belonging, of being Steve's, more than anything else.
"What?" Steve rounds on him. "What the hell is wrong with you? What the hell makes you think I give a damn about – about who he might have–"
"Thanks, Natasha," Steve tells her as she goes. "You're always here to tell me when I'm being a moron, and I appreciate that about you."
he's nervous. Tony had sent a note back with the kitchen staff saying he would, in fact, join Steve for dinner. Which is a good sign.
"What would you ever do without me?" She says, laughing prettily. "I'm not even sure you could put on your own waistcoat without me."
He goes slack all at once, and Steve drops to the bed, keeping Tony's hips locked to his. He groans, shivering, and pets over Tony's arms and back, soothing the Omega's sweaty skin.
She smiles at him again, and this time it's more natural, more warm. "I'm just here for a visit, your highness."
Wilson takes him to a high stone wall, and a heavy wooden gate. Pepper and Rhodey follow along behind them, of course.
Tony wakes late, to a knock on his door. He's still dressed from the night before, but there are pages of drawings and equations spread out all over his bed. He hastily shuffles them into a pile, throwing the blanket over them to hide them. He moves toward the door, opening it slowly and peering out into the hallway.
He doesn't get to finish the sentence – Steve seals their lips together again, stopping him and plundering his mouth for a long moment. He tears away breathlessly. "No," he says, panting. "Never think that. I didn't know you, I didn't know how amazing you'd be, and I will be forever, forever grateful that Howard brought you to me."
"Alright," Pepper says, placing a gentle, soothing hand on his arm. "Okay, Tony. It's going to be okay. We'll go back to your chambers, then, so you can get ready."
"Well…" Bruce starts, and Steve pushes up from his chair, looming as well as he can in the well-lit room.
The ugly thought makes Tony frown. Steve's been nothing but nice to him, and Tony needs to remember that. Even if Steve had taken off as soon as Tony's heat had broken.
Tony throws his head back, crying out and coming, spurting between them even as he clenches and squeezes Steve's cock. Steve growls, wrapping his big hands around Tony's narrow hips, and pulls him down harder, grinds Tony into his lap and onto his cock, groaning deep and low in his throat as his knot swells, as his cock pulses and he comes, spurting his seed into Tony's wet, shivering body.
Wilson takes them further down the hall, then they climb a flight of stairs and cross over a viewing alcove into another wing of the castle.
Clint stares at the basket for a long moment, then shrugs exaggeratedly and reaches for something covered in powdered sugar. "I'm gonna risk it."
He'd learned something fundamental about sex when he'd been at the academy. The professors, mostly Betas, had told them that if there was something their Alphas did to their bodies, something specific, there was a good chance it was something they, themselves, enjoyed. If an Alpha concentrated on your nipples, then they likely enjoyed having their own nipples played with.
He'd been expecting bare skin. What he hadn't been expecting was black-red lace, shining in the lantern light of the room, a deep V of it disappearing into the waistband of Tony's pants. Delicate embroidered flowers swirl around the peaks of Tony's nipples. The dark scalloped lace plunges down to bare him as far as just under his navel. His shoulders look strong and square, framed by the halter-neck, and Steve reaches out a tentative hand to touch the silky material.
"And he won't treat you differently just because you're his mate," Natasha continues. "If you want suppressants, you'll have them."
He waits for Steve to say something, but Steve just waits for him to continue. Tony takes a deep breath. He's 90 per cent certain that Steve won't punish Tony for answering him about the flowers.
Steve checks the mirror again to make sure his hair is still neat. He can't sit still, but that's okay because he doesn't even know what time Tony will be coming to him.
Tony squirms, limbs loose and uncoordinated. Steve is, quite suddenly, reminded of how hard and insistent his own cock is. Tony is gorgeous like this, messy with his own come and sweat and slick.
Tony cries out again, and Steve knows he's coming a second time already, his whole body jerking and pulsating as he writhes on Steve's knot.
At least Sam's less likely to tease him for his absolute uselessness when it comes to wooing a guy who is already
," he says, his voice shocked and delighted, and all his own training flies out the window as he leans forward in excitement, clasping a hand over her wrist. "Were you at the Academy? You can't be much older than me, how could I have missed you?"
"Your highness," Pepper starts, face flushed. "I had a visit from Lord Steven this morning. He said you'd told him about your ideas for aqueducting in the kingdom."
"I'm not going to hurt him," Steve says, and it comes out more fiercely than he'd meant it to. "I'm never going to hurt him."
"And there were rumours of your – well, I mean–" Tony blushes dark red, casting his eyes down to his plate. "That's about it," he finishes lamely.
"I fought my way out," she shrugs. "They'd decided on an experiment. You see, the Krasnyy sex slaves are a highly sought-after commodity, among Alphas in countries with no moral compass. Or, I suppose, among Alphas that can get away with it. The government wanted to find out what would happen if they trained their whores as double agents – to get them into the bed of a high-ranking Alpha somewhere and have them steal secrets or assassinate their enemies."
Tony drains his glass of wine, and sets it on the table. He takes a deep breath and meets Steve's eyes.
know is that the guy's probably a giant asshole. Howard would never have sent Tony to an Alpha that wasn't.
Steve tilts his head, studying Tony carefully. "Have you always been able to do that? Figure out how stuff works, or how it should work, and make it happen?"
He doesn't sleep, though. After a few hours, he rises, heads for the trunk at the foot of his bed. He finds charcoals and paper, and he begins sketching.
"What's all this?" Clint asks, gesturing to the contracts on the table. "Is this why we have bribery baked goods?"
"Well, all flowers have a meaning. Giving a certain type of flower can convey a message to the person you're giving it to. It's more than just 'flowers are a present'. Each individual flower has a meaning, and some of them, together with other flowers, have an entirely different meaning."
that. I want to get to know you, as a person. You're an Omega Consort, yes, and all that that entails but, Tony… first and foremost, you're my bondmate."
He grins wider, trying to give her a wicked, devilish smirk. "I'll be honest, I excelled at a few classes. Usually the ones that didn't involve a lot of 'class' but did have a lot of–"
want to have dinner with his Alpha, but they've almost reached a breakthrough on one of the long range weapons, and Tony prioritizes.
Tony can't speak for a moment, and when he does manage to get words out, his voice is thick and cracked. "They're beautiful. Steve – your highness – they're lovely."
"Hold your panties out of the way for me," Steve instructs, voice almost hoarse, before pushing back in, this time with two fingers and his tongue, and Tony obeys immediately, reaching back to pull the lace fabric off to the side so that Steve has both hands free, and he slides his other hand in under Tony's body, cupping his cock in the lace. His cock is a nice size, bigger than his frame would suggest, but Steve has big hands, too, so he can mostly cover the bulge of it. Tony cries out, thrusts his hips forward mindlessly, fucking into Steve's hand.
"Or, you know, the elixir that gave him his health and strength must have also made him feral and, well, you know how theories start in small places like this. Some of the townspeople think you might even be dead, though the staff keeps sending food up with Ms. Potts."
Steve gives him a look, and the sparkle softens a little into a warmth Steve hadn't even dared to hope he'd see. He flushes with pleasure at it, then continues talking. "Do you… have any questions about that?"
"Not — oh — not in heat," Tony says, arching his back and pushing into Steve's clever hand. He'd never imagined an Alpha being so interested in Tony's pleasure, in touching Tony and stroking his cock and watching him fall apart. He'd expected an Alpha who would use him, fuck his ass and knot him at his own leisure, but Steve had upended every expectation Tony had come here with. "Just want you."
Tony glances up. Rhodey has already left the coach and is outside talking to some of the soldiers they're traveling with.
Steve leads him back down the hallway, through the corridor and back to his own rooms. Luckily, there's a private dining room that he'd told the staff he wanted them to dine in. The
going to punish you," Steve tells him, putting some of that royal command in his voice. He doesn't bring it out very often, but he's done arguing about this, and they've barely even started. "I am
fine. He'd thought… he'd thought Steve had liked him, at least. A little. But Steve had only wanted him because of his heat, because of the smell of his arousal. It had been biology, nothing more.
"Don't move, honey," Steve says, doing his best to hold his own hips still. "Give yourself a minute, get used to it, okay?"
So Howard and Maria had tried over and over to conceive an Alpha, or even a Beta, but each pregnancy after their Omega son, Anthony, had ended in miscarriage – until the last. Maria had died during childbirth, and the infant had died soon after.
"He wouldn't mind," she says, again, gentler this time. "He wouldn't pressure you for anything, he wouldn't take advantage of you. He isn't the type."
He pulls at Tony's hip, pushes his leg over, and rolls Tony over onto his back with very little assistance from the Omega himself.
Tony heads into the bathroom, reaching for the hem of his shirt but then stopping dead in his tracks as he looks around the bathroom.
She grins, helping him out of the bath and holding out a big, fluffy towel for him to dry himself. She uses another towel to roughly dry his hair, then heads back out to the main section of the room. Rhodey is sitting in an armchair, reading a book.
"Alstroemeria," Tony says, pointing to some pink and yellow blooms. "Wealth, prosperity, and fortune. It also means friendship."
Steve eyes him for another long moment before he finally lets go of Tony's wrist. He doesn't say anything else, though.
"What's security like here at the castle?" is the first question Rhodey asks as they step through the large front doors. The entry hall is dimly lit, but decorated warmly.
"Why are you here, Natasha?" he asks her again. She hadn't answered him the first time, only told him he'd chosen the wrong shirt and made him go change, then she'd mussed his hair up a little. He'd had to take a minute to smooth it out again.
"Oh, yeah," Tony says, a little strangled. "This is gonna be fine." Then he slides his mouth back down, sucking Steve all the way into him. He swallows and licks and bobs, taking Steve deep in his throat, over and over.
"Well if that's not a little bit of fuckery, I don't know what is," Bucky had said, peering over Steve's shoulder at the note.
"You're right, you are shit at it," Bucky agrees again. "These are good, what is this, raspberry cream?"
But what he wants isn't important, especially not in the face of what it means for the hundreds of people in the kingdom who need what King Howard has to offer.
"Your highness, Steve asked me to come find you, actually," Wilson says, stepping through between the Betas. "If you'd like to join him in the garden?"
Tony starts slowly, carefully, trying to gauge Steve's reaction as he slowly pushes Steve's thighs further apart, Steve moves his legs willingly. Tony glances up to check his facial expression, and Steve is watching him raptly, eyes glued to Tony's mouth as he licks and sucks and bobs his head.
"There aren't a lot of Omegas in the kingdom, but they all get to have suppressants if they want them," she says, as though reading his mind. "Even the bonded ones."
Steve leans forward, braces his hand on the middle of Tony's back to hold him down, and curls his other hand around Tony's shoulder to hold him close, to make sure that the force of Steve's thrusts don't push Tony away from him.
The first taste of Tony's slick on the lace of his bodysuit is ambrosia. The musky scent of it and sweet taste on his tongue pull a groan out of him – a groan completely drowned out by the startled yelp from Tony when Steve licks hard at the lace covering his opening.
"I think King Howard doesn't have enough regard for him to bother with anything so invested as 'punishment'," Natasha says.
Tony and his team work that way for days. They make breakthrough after breakthrough. By the end of the fifth day, Tony sets the team to mass production. They have so much to do that Rhodey goes around to the other smiths in the kingdom and has them working on the various pieces.
And, now that he's bonded, his Alpha will have final say about his hobbies and projects. If Lord Steven has a problem with his engineering texts, he'll have to get rid of them. He'll have to do whatever Lord Steven says.
The door opens, and it's not Rhodey striding into the room at all. It's Natasha, Steve's redheaded friend. The one Steve had said would stay behind to keep an eye on him.
Steve. And those nights he was in heat, when Steve worshipped and ravaged his body in turns – that would be a thing of the past. Tony would be nothing but a disappointment.
No, that's a surefire way to get himself sent back to Howard in disgrace, to spend the rest of his days in exile.
"No, no, I want it, I want to feel you – fuck – stretching me open, feel you filling me, god, like that," Tony moans, not stopping, still pushing back and back until he's all the way down, Steve's whole cock inside him. He's trembling, cheeks flushed with pain and pleasure, and his cock has flagged but it's still half hard, and he stays there for a moment.
Steve is rescued from his floundering when Ms. Potts clears her throat, drawing both their attention across the room.
The training programs in Krasnyygorod are like a terrifying parody of the Academy in Starkland. Omegas don't learn anything about diplomacy or politics or manners. They're taught to use their bodies in order to give Alphas pleasure, and only to give Alphas pleasure.
He can wait for his own pleasure, if the trade off is seeing the look in Steve's eye, right now. Naked want and desire and surprise, like he hadn't expected Tony to do that for him, hadn't expected Tony to give him that.
"It's probably intensified by your heat, Tony. Not that I'm not happy to hear about you wanting me – feel free to repeat that."
Steve glances back at the sofa over by the fireplace, and lets one of Tony's hands drop to his side. He holds onto the other, though, lacing their fingers together and tugging Tony toward the sitting area. "Come sit down," he says.
The pink skin is fresh and clean, furled and wet with moisture from Tony's own body and from Steve's saliva. The muscle pulses as Tony's inner walls clench and release, arousal and heat and hormones readying him to receive Steve's knot.
But Tony hasn't been able to separate truth from rumour. For example, according to one tale, not only had he defeated the Red Skull, but he had then proceeded to crack open the Skull's, er, skull, and bathe in his jellied brain matter.
"It'll be fine," Pepper says, handing him a small vial of rosewater. "Use this if you must, but I'm sure they'll offer us a chance to freshen up before we have to meet Lord Steven."
"Your highness, I'm Captain James Rhodes," the man interrupts him, obviously trying to keep himself from laughing. "I'm Prince Anthony's bodyguard."
"Then I suggest you get off my lap, stand up and take it off yourself, because I'm going to tear it off you in a second," Steve rumbles, burying his nose in Tony's jaw and nipping at the skin again.
"Not you, too," Steve sighs, looking at her beseechingly. "I'm getting enough of this from Bucky, Clint and Sam. I was really hoping you wouldn't be dishing it out, too."
Steve knocks on the door to Tony's chambers. The door is opened by Rhodes, who gives him a slight nod, opening the door wider.
a heat before. God, here Steve is, thinking about himself, when Tony's going through his first heat, about to have his first Alpha.
"It's not," Steve says. "I… was rough with you, I know. And then, before we could talk about it, before we could do anything else, before I could show you… anyway, I left. That wasn't fair. I wish I hadn't had to go. I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry," he says, coming back, brushing his hands against his pant leg. "I'm not disappointed in you. I could never be disappointed in you."
"No, honey, no," Steve says, nuzzling in behind Tony's ear. He takes Tony's trembling hand in his own. "It's not dangerous. We're just going to go ask some questions, try and get some information."
What if Lord Steven doesn't like him? What if Lord Steven casts him aside and sends him away? If he's sent back to Howard in disgrace, there's no telling what Howard would do to him.
But this year, the harvest had been so poor, and the winter so far has been hard. He hadn't wanted to do it, but Steve had known that he would have to seek help from King Howard in order to keep his people alive.
"He's not here," Pepper says, sounding thoughtful. She looks like she's about to say something else, but then her face changes, taking on a polite but scrutinizing smile looking over Tony's shoulder.
"Captain James Rhodes," Rhodey says, thrusting out a hand to shake. Wilson does so with a firm grip, then turns to give Pepper a genial bow.
Steve can barely hold himself still. He moans, fingers clenched into the bedding, watching Tony devour his cock. It's gorgeous, and he wants to burn it into his mind to relive it over and over. Tony's pink lips stretch around Steve's girth, and he wonders what Tony's lips would look like stretched around his knot.
Instead, Steve picks him up, twists him and hitches him up, and Tony can't help but wrap his legs around Steve's narrow waist, and Steve tilts his chin up for a kiss. Tony meets him, lips and tongue searching and wild, trying to seek out all of Steve's taste, trying to make Steve understand how much he wants the Alpha, how much he needs him, right now. How strong his desire, how wild his arousal.
"I learned a lot about the world when I was at the academy," Tony says, looking down at the cobblestone path. "Some of it more useful than others."
," he says. "You don't do this exam? The whole kingdom knows. You skip the exam and have Bruce lie about it? Same thing, everyone knows. And what do they assume? They assume you're lying because Anthony came here
about his virtue," Steve growls. Bucky doesn't back down, though – if anything, he leans in, nose to nose with Steve.
The rush of slick and come that slips out of Tony's soft, open hole when Steve finally pulls out of him is almost as hot as the tiny little moaning sound the Omega makes at the loss. Steve pets him, soothes him, and kisses him as he rearranges them on the bed to get under the covers, pulling Tony tightly to his chest.
"Fuck, yes, please," Tony whines, and Steve takes his cue, starts rocking forward over and over, pushing his knot into Tony's prostate. He watches, fascinated, as Tony spirals higher and higher, wilder and wilder, and then his whole body goes tight as a bow string and he comes again.
"It's delicious," Tony says after he's chewed and swallowed his bite. He glances up under his lashes and catches Steve's gaze still on him, and his cheeks flush again.
Shit. He should have known better. He shouldn't have taken it all for granted – he'd cancelled on Steve, and he'd spent a week being an
about the walls," Tony grins, as though he hasn't heard Steve's question, or as if he's misunderstood it. "But he had the palace engineers in to look it over, and not a week later they were doing the same in his chambers."
"Tony," Steve says, blinking. His cheeks flush and his eyes roam over Tony's chest and legs. Wilson, beside him, lets out a strangled noise and then averts his eyes back to the floor.
"I want you to have a good time," Steve says, lifting his free hand to stroke Tony's cheek. "I want you to feel good. I want you to feel good because of me, because of what I do for you. Do you understand?"
Tony's legs splay wide desperately and he cants his hips back. Steve groans at the sight, of Tony's ass cheeks spread, of his slick hole gaping open and pink, waiting for Steve's knot to fill it.
"Prince Anthony, I believe his highness is just concerned that you might find the procedure invasive, or uncomfortable. Your highness, Prince Anthony is quite used to these exams – not only are they important to track his health, but they were performed every six months at the academy. It's a medical procedure the prince is quite used to."
He rocks forward a little, pushing his knot against Tony's prostate, and Tony  screams, cock pulsing between them again.
He gives up Steve's mouth, though he can't help but nip at the full, swollen bottom lip with his teeth as he lets go. Steve groans and lifts his head, chasing Tony's lips, but Tony kisses his way down Steve's neck, across his chest. He pauses there, peppering kisses across the broad, muscular chest, sipping and lipping at Steve's nipples. Steve pushes his hips up, grinds his cock against Tony's thigh, but he keeps his hands on the bed to allow Tony to control everything happening. Tony rewards him by moving lower, licking and sucking his way across the ridges of Steve's muscles, down to the V of muscle that leads to his cock.
Steve thinks about it for a long moment, then lets a small smile creep onto his face. "To messages," he says, tipping his glass up. Tony smiles, a small blush gracing his cheekbones, and clinks his glass with Steve's. They both take a long, fortifying drink.
He'd worked out fairly quickly how much of an insult Anthony is to Steve, but he's yet to figure out why King Howard would make
"Oh, sure, that wouldn't have been at all awkward. 'Nice to meet you, my liege, please, tell me, are you a grower or a shower?'"
Steve thinks he might get a few minutes to himself, finally. He wants to turn the puzzle of Anthony Stark over in his head a little bit.
"You have me," Steve promises, back to kissing Tony's mouth. His hands pull at Tony's clothes, trying to undress him, but Tony keeps getting in the way by pulling and tugging at Steve's own.
Tony stands proudly beside the doctor out in the main square when he makes the announcement, surveying over the men and women that are now, apparently, his subjects. Lord Steven – Steve isn't there, though.
That first heat, when they had consummated their bond, Steve had done something for him that he hadn't expected. He'd been taught how to do it, of course — they'd been taught how to do most anything sexual at the academy — but it wasn't something an Omega should expect from their Alpha, as it was designed to give pleasure to the receiver, and generally Alphas were not so interested in the pleasure of their Omegas.
"Please," Tony gasps, a rush of slick easing the way further for Steve's questing fingers. "God, please, Steve, I need your knot."
Steve flipped his middle finger up in a rude gesture, almost on reflex. Bucky took it in stride, not even pausing.
He feels his body next; loose-limbed and warm, his muscles slightly sore. His legs are a little shaky, his asshole a little loose from Steve's huge knot. His skin is sticky with sweat and slick and come, and he needs a bath.
"And now I want you to know you're not obligated to do anything else," Steve says, nodding. "Do you understand?"
"I understand things were done a different way in Starkland, and when you were at the academy," Steve tells him. "But that's not the way it is here. I don't even know how you think you might have offended me, but I can assure you that even if I
"No, but you knew that already. If only you'd just let him forget about our silly little fishing villages, I'm sure he'd like you much more."
He's about to flounder for something else to talk about, but Natasha rises to her feet, setting her tea cup down on the table with a soft click. "I'll leave you to your tea," she says, giving him a look that lets him know he's not fooling anyone. "You think about what I said."
He slams his book closed, flipping it over onto its front to try and hide the title, but Natasha darts out a hand and grabs the book, pulling it across to herself and flipping it back over.
Steve snorts, burying his face in the crook of Tony's neck, trying to get himself under control. "Is it too much?" He asks cheekily.
He's been trained in several different types of sexual discourse, of course, but he's going into this blind. Would his Alpha be rough? Cruel, perhaps?
"Thank you, your highness," Ms. Potts says, and Steve looks between them, and at Rhodes, for a moment before he stands.
"Is it alcohol? Because I feel like alcohol is the only thing in the world that's going to settle my nerves."
The note King Howard had sent had filled in the missing pieces of the puzzle when it came to Steve's new Omega Consort. The signing of the contract had finalized the deal – there needn't be any bonding ceremony. In the eyes of the law and the land, Steve and the Omega were officially bonded when Steve had signed that paper.
He doesn't know how to finish the sentence, but she's peering at him now, eyes sharp. But she doesn't look disapproving at all. They stare at each other for a long moment, then she slides the book back across the table to him. He puts his hand on the cover automatically, as though to protect the book from any further manhandling.
Tony turns to Pepper, eyes wide. "I have been on the road for two weeks, Pep, I need a bath more than I need
Tony huffs in a very unprincely manner. "I'd be shocked if it did," he admits. "But you didn't ask me if I was honest, you asked me why I was here. Do you think I'll be honest if I tell you?"
. Tony keeps his face frozen and closed, keeps his eyes on the path in front of them. Ignores the way his eyes are hot, the way his cheeks are tight.
"What do yellow carnations mean?" Steve asks, taking another step closer. Tony can almost smell the tang of clean earth, fresh sweat, even coffee on Steve's skin.
"I would love to," the prince says, taking a deep breath. He flicks a small smile up toward Steve and Steve feels his heart pound at the beauty of it. He needs to see it again, and he resolves himself to finding ways to make Prince Anthony smile as frequently as possible.
Bucky crows out a laugh. "I bet they teach them to call fucking 'bond-strengthening discourse,' too."
Natasha stands up from the table, quite suddenly, and moves into the little kitchen area and pulls two mugs from the shelves and a box of tea, and goes about – without discussing it with Tony
Steve studies him for a moment, as though he could see what Tony had talked to Natasha about – her past, suppressants, what it's like being an Omega in America – on Tony's face. And for all Tony knows, maybe Steve can. "I'm glad. I thought you two might get along."
"I love you, I love you, I love you," Tony finally gasps, the words coming out slurred and barely intelligible as he lolls his head down between his braced arms.
Tony sinks further onto him, trying to pick up speed with the kiss. Steve slides one hand up Tony's spine, up to the back of his neck, and grips him there to hold him still. Tony's body instantly freezes, then relaxes into the dominating touch, and he lets out a sigh of pleasure as Steve takes control of the kiss, keeping it slow and deep.
.' 'No, of course you can't bond without a dowry and you're treated like a second class citizen, but in Krasnyygorod the Omegas aren't even that – they're chattel, kept and traded and used like animals.'
afraid of me," Steve says, but he smiles a little to take away some of the sting. "It's okay, Tony, I'm not mad. I just want to find out why you're scared, so I can try to help."
He reaches out, takes the lace in two fingers, and rubs it. It's soft, silky, and light. It makes his belly cramp again, but it also gives him a rush of desire.
Tony thinks about Steve's searching eyes, the way he'd taken Tony's hands in his, the way he'd called Tony 'sweetheart' even when he hadn't been fucking him. The way Steve had held him, like he'd been something precious.
king. He's not cruel to his subjects, he's not a warmonger. But before Steve had been named Lord of America, the province had fallen by the wayside. It's isolated, far away from the Capitol, and populated by farmers and fisherman – not a high profile place. That low profile had made it easy for King Howard to ignore the people here – convinced they weren't contributing to the advancement of the kingdom – and Steve doesn't ever want that to happen to the province again.
Steve stares at him, unsure what to say to that. Tony doesn't really give him a chance to think of much, before he's out the door and gone.
"They don't have aqueducts here," Tony says, his voice quiet as he stares at the chamberpot across the room. "Oh my god, they don't have
"You think Howard's gonna send you contracts for an Omega Consort with some poisoned baked goods? Coulda just sent an assassin, it'd be simpler."
Steve studies him for a moment, then decides to throw caution to the wind and lean back on the sofa, pulling Tony with him. It takes a moment to arrange themselves so that Tony is against his chest, but eventually Steve is able to settle them comfortably and wrap one arm around Tony's shoulders.
"I know, I wish it could be any other way," Steve says, arms tightening around Tony's body. "I wanted to – it doesn't matter. It'll only be for a couple of weeks."
"I just don't know how to talk to him," Steve says. "It's like he's afraid to say anything to me, like he doesn't know the answers to simple questions. What does he like to do, what does he like to eat, what was it like growing up a prince – he seemed
"This says Stark will be bringing his valet and his bodyguard with him. Ask the staff to make up rooms for them?"
"Do you like it like this?" Steve asks, murmuring the words into Tony's skin. He wants to know everything about Tony, he wants to know his favourite ways to make love so that he can do all of them, make Tony scream and cry under him. "When you're riding me like this, taking me? Do you want my knot like this?"
Steve knows his knot is big, but he also knows Tony can take it, that for Omegas a knotting can be very intense, but also very pleasurable. Tony is breathing hard, swinging his head from side to side, panting. Steve kisses him, his body shivering because Tony is so hot inside, hot and tight and slick around him.
"How are your, um, weapons coming along?" Steve asks. "Clint said you were using the engineers to build them?"
"Part of the selling point for getting an actual Consort, instead of just any Omega, is the lessons they're taught there," Steve says. "Navigating the politics of the kingdoms, negotiating with other rulers, planning and maintenance of the palace, the whole bit. There's a list of their curriculum in one of those piles."
Steve lets out a light, frustrated sound. Tony flinches, so Steve takes a deep breath. "Sorry, I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at… the world, I guess. I hate this. I hate that I have to sit here in our bonding bed and explain to you that it's okay for you to have thoughts and opinions whether I share them or not, and that if you express those thoughts and opinions I won't punish you in some way. I hate it."
Tony stares at him, flabbergasted. Steve is panting by now, heart pounding as he pours all his emotion out on the table between them, hoping it's not too much, hoping Tony will feel even a little bit the same.
"It's fine," Tony says, glancing back up at Steve. He doesn't seem upset about Tony making an appearance outside the bedroom, but he does seem upset. "I didn't mean to interrupt."
Tony manages to keep himself from drinking it directly from the pitcher, a personal victory he doesn't manage every day, to be honest.
"Tony, it's okay," Steve says, rubbing his thumbs over Tony's hands. "We don't have to rush, okay? We can take our time."
Steve snorts, then slaps his hand over his mouth to stifle the laugh. "Pretty much," he says, grinning with a shrug. "Is that… okay?"
His cock is hard enough to bulge at his crotch, and he's breathing hard, chest heaving. Shaky fingers jerk up to the button at the top of his shirt, and he starts unbuttoning it. He's shaking from urgency, now, rather than nerves, and Steve is enraptured, unable to look away as Tony slowly bares his skin.
wasn't what he'd wanted out of this deal. But he'd also had the wherewithal to make sure he hadn't told Tony that Steve had never
Sam smirks at him. "You just gotta be you, man. You're kind, and generous, and kind of a dork. Just be gentle with him. Convince him you're not what he expects."
"I get the feeling that whatever I just said, you heard something different," he says, keeping his warm, dry fingers looped around Tony's wrist. It feels like a firebrand.
"Sam sent them back with Redwing," Steve says, nodding at the paperwork. "The troops have managed to push the Chitauri back past the river."
Steve cries out underneath him, fingers clenching and digging into the bedding, and Tony takes his time, slowly swallowing Steve all the way down and then drawing his head up to the tip, then softening his tongue and lips and throat and sinking back down.
They walk through the halls quietly and make their way out to the grounds, headed for the enchanted garden. The snow on the cobbled streets has started to melt, leaving puddles in its wake. They walk with distance between them, and at one point Tony walks around a puddle while Steve walks around the other side of it entirely.
"Of course," he says, taking his tea cup back into his hand and sipping from it. It tastes like ash. He gulps it down, then – blatantly ignoring good manners – reaches out to take hers. It's only half-drunk, but he takes the two cups and stands up from the chair. "I'm quite tired, Natasha. I should head to bed."
Pepper starts to wash his hair with a spicy-smelling shampoo, digging her fingertips into his scalp and scrubbing.
He fucks into Tony from below, speeding up the hand he's using to stroke Tony's cock. Tony cries out, spurts come up over his chest, shivering with another orgasm.
Steve sighs, jumping back to his feet restlessly. He begins to pace as he talks. "I don't want to ration our stores. I've
The people of Starkland had long cut ties with Krasnyygorod – there'd been a trade embargo for years, mostly based on the way they treated their Omega population. There had been a few refugees through the years, but Tony doesn't think he's ever met an Omega who'd been through their rigorous training programs.
Natasha moves out into the hallway with Ms. Potts, then closes the door, leaving Steve alone with Tony.
She leaves Tony alone with his thoughts then, by himself in the coach. It's only mildly warmer than outside, so he wraps the furs and blankets around him more snugly.
Tony sucks his bottom lip in between his teeth and worries at it for a moment. "I do," he says, finally, voice barely above a whisper. "I do want you."
Tony sits down, waiting until Steve has sat down before taking the pot off the stew and dishing some onto Steve's plate. He serves himself second, pouring wine into each of their cups.
"I wanted to make sure you weren't dead, after all," she says. "Steve specifically asked me to keep an eye on you. I had intended to casually run into you in the courtyard or something, but you've made that very difficult."
"Here, Tony," Pepper says, pulling a small jar of preserves from her cloaks. "This will settle your nerves."
Bucky sighs and rolls his eyes. "It's an exam to make sure he's never been knotted before," he says. "You
"But I have it now," Steve soldiers on. "I'm just… I'm just trying to say that I'm not… I know what you – what you learned. What your lessons were in. I know you were sent here like some kind of, I don't know, property. And I want you to know that I don't… think of it like that. I don't
Bucky grimaces, pushing the mouthful of pastry he's chewing to the inside of his cheek so he can talk. "Clint thinks he found tracks down at the south end of Liberty Beach."
The possessiveness slams into his chest, and he growls, biting into the soft, tender skin of Tony's lower belly, teeth digging into lace, before soothing it with his tongue.
His body language shifts immediately, and while his spine stays straight, he somehow manages to tip his head down just enough to present a picture of submission, of reverence. "I'm not anyone special, really," he says, letting his voice take on the slightly breathy tone people expect from a Consort.
Steve rolls his eyes. "Put them closer to Anthony," he says. "Not a lot of point having him far away from them."
Tony wails, whole body bowing and tightening as he comes, and that's enough to push Steve over, too – he shoves forward, grinding his hips into Tony's plump ass, burying his cock deep inside him. His knot swells, stretching Tony's hole open and eliciting a wail of pleasure and triumph from both of them.
"So if you want to fill a pot, or a bathtub, or anything, you just go to the spout and turn it on – when the valve is open, water pours out. When you close it, the water stops."
"Your highness," Steve's friend – he'd called him Bucky? But that can't be right – bows slightly, then stands and peers at Tony. His gaze is sharp, interested, and searching. Like he's trying to see through Tony into the very core of him.
It's clearly not one of the richer provinces. There's a fair amount of activity at the front gates, and Tony images it's the townspeople preparing for his arrival. God, he'd hoped to avoid a production, really. The last thing he'd wanted was to be gawked at by a bunch of local farmhands who don't know the first thing about a Consort.
Tony nods, and raises a hand in a wave, but Steve is already on his way out the door, leaving Tony alone in the bedroom that smells of their lovemaking.
"May I present his highness, Prince Anthony Stark," Rhodes says, stepping to the side. "Prince Anthony, Lord Steven Rogers – your Alpha."
"This is the great hall," Wilson tells them. "Steve's not into the whole 'throne' thing, so we don't have one of those." He rolls his eyes, and while it seems fond, Tony can't help but be struck at the disrespect of it. Howard would probably have had the man beheaded.
"I hear congratulations are in order," she says. Her tone is light, but there's an edge to her voice Steve doesn't miss.
Tony sighs again. "In Starkland, they've built aqueducts. It's an amenity I've grown quite fond of, and it hadn't occurred to me that other parts of the kingdom might not have the same thing."
Steve stares at him for a long moment. He's suddenly gripped by the intense need to taste Tony, to taste the ambrosia of his slick, to see if it's as good as it smells. He moves forward slowly, placing his hand on Tony's back and sliding it down to the round firmness of his ass. Tony shivers.
"But that was different. God, I don't know why I'm so nervous," Tony says. "It's the knotting, I think. Do you think it'll hurt?"
"Well, growing up in the royal family can be hard," she tells him. "You're in the public eye all the time during your formative years. It has to be even harder when you're an Omega, and when there are no other heirs to the throne."
"Strip," she tells him, rearranging things on the table. She picks up a sweet-smelling soap and the shaving blade, heading back toward the washroom. Tony, knowing better than to argue with her, follows behind while undoing is pants. This, at least, he's familiar with.
Tony convulses almost immediately, his whole body seizing and shaking, jerking under Steve's. It's amazing and beautiful and the most erotic thing Steve has ever seen, the deep, full-body orgasm Tony can have on his knot. He'd thought the first time might have been a one-off, but to have it happen again is thrilling, and Steve wonders if Tony will come on his knot like this all the time, if Tony will let Steve fuck him like this even after his heat.
There's a dark-skinned man standing on the steps of to the palace, smiling warmly as Rhodey gets out of the coach. He turns to help Pepper out, and then loans a hand to Tony. As Tony steps out of the coach, Rhodey gives his hand a reassuring squeeze.
"Don't be lewd, Tony." She rolls her eyes, but the fragile paleness to her face is fading. She looks less heartbroken and afraid for him now, which had been his goal – he's afraid enough for himself without adding her fear to the mix. Her eyes take on a mischievous glint of their own. "I meant your ballroom dancing lessons. You were always quite good with a rhythm."
what you care about," Bucky tells him, standing up and getting in his face. He doesn't raise his voice, though – Bucky almost never does.
"So you asked King Howie for help and his response was to insist you take on a sex kitten for a bondmate? Seriously?" Clint asks, looking between Bucky and Steve.
Tony hadn't realized there was a garden here. Maybe America will be more than snow and frigid water, after all.
Her green eyes shine, and her pert nose turns pink with determination not to cry. "If – if he's awful, if he's a monster, Tony, we'll find a way to–"
Steve blushes. He knows that. He's known it since that afternoon. He can see it in the dampness on Tony's upper lip, the brightness of his eyes. He can smell Tony's pheromones, the slightly spicy, sweet scent of slick and heat. But somehow, having Tony say it so bluntly, so openly, makes him shy.
in the first place. Now, King Howard was clearly drawing a line in the sand: Steve Rogers isn't royalty by blood, so his bloodline ends here.
"Oh, god, no," Tony says, a laugh startled out of him. "I don't think anyone's told the truth in Starkland in 10 years."
Steve groans, revelling in the feeling of his knot swelling and locking them together again. He grinds forward, watching as Tony shudders and jerks. His cock stays soft, but a dry orgasm overtakes him and he cries out, his whole body tensing and shaking.
They'd been lovely stories, and if Tony is honest, it had made him feel warm in his chest, at how very
She wraps her arms around him, and Tony only now realizes how badly he'd needed a hug. He sinks into her arms, breathing in her sweet, soothing Beta scent.
"I know," Steve says simply. "There's no rush, though. I want you to do what you want to do. If that's building weapons, even though you don't have to, even though it's more than I have any right to ask of you, then you do that. Until you decide to do the aqueducts, we've been doing fine like this."
"So he gathered some engineers," she continues, grinning. "He told the staff to make sure you had everything you needed."
"Please," Steve says, not sure if he's begging her to translate the apparent communication breakdown between the two of them, or just to put him out of his misery altogether.
Pepper tilts her head, studying him for a long moment, before she gives him a small smile. "No it's not," she says.
Tony is sitting in his rooms by himself, flipping through an architecture book and feeling bored and lonely and rejected, when there's a knock at the door. Thinking it must be Rhodey, Tony simply calls from the chair, "Come in!"
afraid." Steve opens his mouth, but Tony barrels on, not letting him interrupt. "I'm really not, I swear. I'm just – it's the
Steve moves forward, letting himself sink onto a small bench near Sam. "Well, I mean, we ate food and neither of us choked, so sure. We'll call it a success."
"Anemone," Tony says. "That's one of the ones with two meanings. On the one hand, it's fading hope, or having been forsaken. Or, if you look at it as a positive thing, it's 'anticipation'."
But if it will make Tony look up at him with that big smile, with those sparkling eyes – if it will make Tony wind his arms around Steve's neck and kiss him, well. Steve has suffered worse embarrassments for less.
Tony feels his cheeks heat. Had Steve done it on purpose? Left Natasha at home to talk to Tony, convince him that Steve wasn't the kind of Alpha he'd read about in school? That Steve would let Tony do what he wanted, have what he wanted?
"Let me love you," Steve says, gripping Tony and holding him still, catching his eye, and he's serious, he's gentle and loving and he wants to love Tony.
"So, how many Kings and queens and rich and powerful folks do you know?" Sam doesn't give Steve a chance to answer. "Now, how many of those people do you
He's sketching a blueprint design. He'll never do anything more than sketches, he knows, but from time to time he enjoys letting his mind run free with ideas and problem solving. Today's blueprint is for a compact but powerful energy device, a self-sustaining design based on the electromagnets he'd been reading about in one of his texts. If the design worked, it could potentially power an entire house; a larger one could power a village.
to," he stresses, looking back at Tony. "I'm saying… I trust you. And even if I didn't think you'd – I don't care. It wouldn't bother me."
They don't talk much about her past, but Steve knows she feels a kinship with Tony. She'd grown up in Krasni, and Steve thinks she'd been slated for the same kind of fate as Tony had been, as an Omega Consort, before she'd defected and moved to Starkland, fighting beside Steve in the war. He doesn't think it had been as coveted a position in Krasni, though.
"Tell me what I've done wrong. At least so I don't do it again," Steve says, stepping forward again. He's holding the flowers down by his hip. "Please."
"Is there something wrong?" Tony asks, spine tense. Steve sits down and pulls Tony down onto his lap, burying his face in the crook of Tony's neck.
Steve steps forward, smile softening. "Usually it's open for all the townspeople to enjoy. But I wanted us to be alone the first time you saw it."
"But if you have any regard for the 'little guy', you should make note to have that same generosity toward him."
"It was long, but it was fine," Rhodes tells him. "Thank you for a warm welcome into your home. Ms. Potts and I care very deeply about the welfare of the prince."
"Alpha, Alpha, Alpha," Tony moans, limbs going limp even as his hips shift and rock, as though he can't take any more stimulation but his body is seeking it out anyway, desperately.
"So I had an interesting visit in my office this morning," Bruce begins, looking mildly uncomfortable. Of course, 'mildly uncomfortable' is Bruce's default state, so Steve doesn't think too much of it. "From Ms. Potts, the prince's valet?"
There's a fireplace in the corner with a large cauldron. There's already a fire under it to heat the water inside, and there's another cauldron of water beside that, likely room temperature.
Steve sits back against the pillows, leaning over to set his wine on the bedside table. "Tony, how do you know how to build an oven? And how to make it work like that, so you can heat the water, and keep it warm?"
"My lord," the young man says, keeping his head bowed. Steve desperately wants him to look up again so he can stare into the young man's eyes.
The lace forces Steve to lick and suck with more pressure than he ordinarily would, but the texture of the lace over smooth, silky skin is intriguing and sexy.
"Are you sure you don't want to get out? Stretch your legs?" Rhodey is already gathering up his coat and hat, wrapping a scarf around his neck.
"Lord Steven," Wilson grins. "We don't really stand on formality around here – at least not with those of us who knew him during the war."
Tony looks at his glass for a moment, before glancing back up to Steve. "Should we toast to something?"
His knot is swollen, big and hard and Tony wants to feel it inside him, but he has to wait now. Not that he would trade it – watching Steve come like that, watching Steve come not because of using Tony's body, not from fucking him, but from what Tony had done to him, how Tony had pleasured him.
"Yes, the staff has been great," Tony says. "I haven't met many of the townspeople, but I hope to in the coming weeks."
Tony stares at him, face still pale. "I would," he says, swallowing hard, "very much like to do whatever would make you happy."
Steve feels his blood run cold, and glances at Bucky, hoping it's a joke. The grim expression on Bucky's face tells him it isn't.
"How?" he asks, simply. He doesn't want to finish the sentence, to say the words out loud. 'How did you escape? How did you survive?'
Tony nods, jerky, breathing hard above him. Steve reaches for his cock between them, wraps his hand around it and starts to stroke. After a minute, it starts to swell and harden under his touch, and Tony starts making breathless moans, his hips twitching slightly.
Tony stares at the cake for a long time, not even moving to eat any of it when Steve starts in on his own. It's heavy and sweet, with some kind of jelly in the centre of it.
Tony cries out into his mouth, but he doesn't clench up or shy away, so Steve allows himself a few moments to push his fingers in and out. Tony's hole is tight, but open enough to take him if he moves slowly.
"I see you've heard of it," she says with a knowing look. "I was placed in a training centre as a child, and I left a few years ago. I wandered into America, and Steve… has been good to me."
Tony whines, and Steve feels a hot rush of slick dampening Tony's pants, even through his own. A moment later, the smell hits him, and Steve growls, fist tightening in Tony's hair and smashing their mouths together for another rough kiss.
It's not just because Tony is his bondmate, though that's part of it. It's not even that they're virtual strangers.
He doesn't know where it's coming from. It's not like he's never done this before, though it has, admittedly, been a while. But somehow, this feels different. More meaningful.
He licks and sucks and kisses at Tony's hole, swirling his tongue over and around his tight, sweet pucker without trying to enter. As he works, the ring of muscle starts to open, to soften. Tony may never have taken an Alpha's knot before, but his body knows what to do, and it prepares itself by opening to allow Steve's cock inside.
"Tony, wait, wait, honey, it's too soon, I'll hurt you," Steve says, grabbing hold of Tony's hips to try to stop him, but god, he feels good – hot and wet and tight like a vise around him.
Tony mostly hopes those ones aren't true. He's nervous enough about going into heat, about consummating with an Alpha, about being knotted for the first time. He doesn't need to think about some forearm-sized dick with a knot the size of his head.
He's saved from too much more pacing and obsessing by a hesitant knock on the door. He rushes over to it, running his hands over his torso to smooth the fabric of his shirt.
"You know, I never wanted to be a lord." Steve flops down on his armchair in the drawing room, suddenly overcome with a feeling of petulance about the entire thing.
He reaches a hand up, task hold of Steve's cock, of his big, beautiful knot, and starts to stroke. He keeps his grip firm, stroking root to tip as Steve cries out under him. Tony licks and sucks and thrusts his tongue deep inside, grips his hand around as much of Steve's knot as he can and rubs hard, squeezing the sensitive knot, and Steve lets out a howl, hips jerking and hole spasming around Tony's tongue as he comes, cock spurting thick white fluid over Steve's chest and stomach, pooling in the dips of his muscle.
At least, that's what his lessons had told him. He's not sure about the sexual desire part of things – he's had sex, of course, with the Beta professors and some of his Omega classmates. How else would he be expected to learn, really? And it had been fun, god knows he'd enjoyed it. Excelled at some of his lessons, there, really.
"Yes, Steve. The words you should have used are 'I like you, Tony. I like you a lot. I think you're gorgeous and I'm ridiculous and stupid and I'd like you to sit on my lap'."
Steve smiles, and takes a deep breath. He lets Tony's scent wash over him, the heat of his body against his warming him from the inside. He puts a tiny bit of pressure on Tony's jaw, nudging his face to turn, and Tony does, tilting his face and turning his torso and pressing his lips against Steve's.
his Omega. Maybe it's not been the most traditional bonding, but it had happened. Steve does wish he'd had more time to get to know Tony before his heat, but there's a part of him (a rather large part, as a matter of fact) that's glad his heat has come so they don't have to wait anymore.
"He said you'd mentioned something. A project. He said your eyes lit up when you talked about it. Engineering. Then you said something about the pipes, he said. The aqua somethings."
Tony shrugs, glancing down at Steve's lips as though he can't bear to hold his gaze. "But you're obligated to–"
"Prince Anthony, it's a pleasure to meet you," Steve says. "I have been looking forward to making your acquaintance for some time. You're as handsome as I'd –"
"Oh," Tony says, still staring down at the table. Neither of them says anything for a long moment. Steve desperately tries to think of something to say, something to make Tony understand he's not mad, that Steve wants him, that Steve could never be angry at him for this.
The young man dips into a shallow bow, the red silk of his shirt shining in the low light. His eyes fall to the floor, submissive and deferential.
"Are you – are you hungry?" Steve says, trying not to scent the air. He wants to get closer, scent Tony's whole body, but that would be rude. "I have wine, if you'd like?"
"He's had sex with Betas," Bucky points out. "Maybe even other Omegas. But there's a reason, specifically, Bruce is going to check for an Alpha knot test."
"Ms. Potts," Natasha says, turning away from Tony. "I was on my way down to the kitchens for a snack. Would you care to join me?"
"I should have said," Steve growls, kissing his way down Tony's jaw, to his throat, sucking at the tender skin there. "I should have told you that morning, I should have told you the other day in the garden. You're beautiful, Tony, and I want you. I always want you, I just didn't want you to feel like you
Tony stays in Steve's arms for a moment, enjoying the closeness. It's different than the closeness they've had over the last few days, but just as compelling, to Tony's mind.
Tony doesn't know what to say. Anything complimenting her strength or resilience would only sound trite.
And he wants this gorgeous Omega to want him back just as much. He wants Tony mewling and crying under him, begging for Steve's knot, desperate and wild and ruined for everyone else.
"He's essentially been bought and sold to you, in his mind. You could be a monster, you could be vicious, you could be infirm or old or weak or ill or hideous. He didn't get any kind of a choice. You went into this knowing you were getting a trained Consort, and they're guaranteed to be a lot of things – beautiful, deferential, polite, smart, and yes, sexually gifted. He's coming here after a life of having no agency, no autonomy."
of an Omega, acting like he could be an engineer, like he could do something other than lie on his back and spread his–
The lace over his ass is dark and damp with slick, the fabric stretched over plump, round globes. The lingerie is backless, giving Steve more beautiful skin to stare at. Tony's thighs are twitching, muscles in his back bunching and rolling as he moves into position.
"I was bored, I needed something to entertain me," she says, taking a grape from the platter on the table. She pops it into her mouth, chewing slowly.
"Sure," Steve says, pushing away from the table. He leaps up and moves to Tony's chair to pull it out and help him stand. "I'll walk you back."
Steve watches him sleep until his knot shrinks enough for him to move, and then he gently pulls a blanket over them both and settles in to doze himself.
He shifts his hips again, feeling a low twinge in his belly, a hint of desire. It's not urgent, so he just rocks his hips back, feeling Steve's limp cock against his ass, teasing himself and thinking of Steve inside him.
"Well, the poison oak is basically everything else," Tony says with a light laugh. Steve's smile widens, and Tony bites his lower lip to try and tamp down his own smile.
Steve's own knees want to give out, but he has to move slowly to make sure he doesn't hurt Tony – they're still locked together by his knot, after all.
Steve watches as, inch by inch, the tanned V of Tony's chest is put on display for him. When he gets to the bottom, he shrugs the shirt off, and Steve's cock jerks in his pants, throat going dry.
"Hi," Steve says, smiling. "You look…" he can't find a word that encompasses how beautiful Tony looks, so he trails off. He swallows roughly. "You look good."
will also be the cause of the Alpha's violent, possessive and rough tendencies? God, the unfairness of it all.
Tony licks and sucks at Steve's fingers greedily, swirling his tongue over the digits to lick up every drop. Steve groans, bracing himself on his knees and straddling Tony's thigh, pushing the other one up higher so he can watch his cock disappear inside Tony's body as he fucks him.
"What if he doesn't like me?" Tony asks, his voice quiet. He hadn't meant to say it, but once the words are out there's nothing he can do to suck them back in.
Steve's cheeks are pink, and his eyes dart down Tony's body and back up again. He swallows, and takes a half-step back into the hallway.
"But now I live here," she says, sweeping an arm up to gesture around the room, to indicate America. "Steve is very kind to me."
, Tony," Steve says, cupping Tony's face with one hand. "Sweetheart, you're an Omega, and you're beautiful and strong and brilliant, too. Being an Omega doesn't make you
God. He's such an idiot. It had been bad enough when he'd thought that Steve had had his fill, had fucked the needy little Omega and was no longer interested. But now, to find out that Steve had never
before," he says. "It's a heat. A bonding. A knotting. And, god, Nat, you should have seen him this afternoon. He's so… I've never met anyone like him. He's brilliant, but he has no idea how beautiful he is."
It's the not knowing that's killing him now. What will the people be like? What will Lord Steven be like? Will he have normal Alpha appetites, or strange ones? What
White roses, to signify a new beginning. Peony for happy life and good health. Orange roses for fascination, aster for patience, white chrysanthemum for loyalty, and a fistful of myrtle to symbolize good luck and love in a marriage.
It's dry, of course, the wrinkled skin tight. Nothing like the hole of an Omega. It sends a little thrill through Tony, this slightly taboo touch, and it sends Steve skyrocketing. The Alpha cries out, thrusts his hips up and his cock pulses in Tony's mouth. He's not coming, not quite, but Tony can feel a slight swelling in the knot under his lips, an obvious sign of Steve's enjoyment. Of his pleasure.
"In time," Steve says, suddenly pushing up and to his feet, looming over Tony. It's alarming, exciting, and Tony is urgently reminded of Steve's strength, his size, the way Steve can hold him down and take him and god, he needs Steve in him now.
. A lot, Tony, I like you so much. You're brilliant and funny and gorgeous and kind, and I mean, you're so generous, you're so – I gave you engineers, and tools, and you could have built anything. You could have built your aqueducts and your hot running water, and instead you built
Suddenly, Steve wonders if he can make Tony come like this, if Tony could get enough out of it, and resolves to give it his best shot. He doubles his efforts, mouthing and licking and thrusting his tongue inside in a crude approximation of fucking. Tony cries out, and Steve pushes the tip of one finger in beside his tongue, pushing and pushing, deeper and deeper until it's buried to the base. He slides it in and out a few times, searching and caressing and licking.
There were rumours that he was the recipient of some magical elixir that had made him immortal, 10 feet tall, then made his cock so big no Omega could take his knot.
"I liked the sex," Steve says, even as he's horrified at the words coming out of his mouth. "With you."
"Good morning, your highness," she says cheekily as she comes in and closes the door. Her cheeks are pink and her eyes bright. "I trust you had a lovely heat?"
"I'm not going to let your stubborn attitude ruin this contract," Howard had growled at him. "You'll stop taking the potions now, and by the time you reach America, you'll go into heat within a few days, and you can consummate the bond and then you won't be my problem anymore."
no Omega Consort would read anything more than a few romance novels, cookbooks and 'how to please your Alpha' instructional books, oh no. But he's gone through everything easily accessible in the coach.
"I have to go," Steve says after a few long, deep breaths. Tony shivers at the rumble of his words against Tony's tender throat.
Tony blinks. Yes, actually, he had mentioned that. It had been, for lack of a better word, pillowtalk.
He slides the hand still on Tony's waist up his chest, tweaking a nipple through the fabric of his shirt on his way up to Tony's throat. He slips two fingers into the neckline of the shirt, thumbing the top button idly as he keeps a firm grip on Tony's hair, holding him immobile.
His thoughts are interrupted when Natasha comes into the drawing room. She's been away on a scouting mission through some of the more isolated villages on the outskirts of the province, both to keep an eye out for Chitauri or other enemies, and to check in with the communities to see what aid they require from their lord.
Steve sets the kingdom and his closest advisors to frantic preparations. They need housing for the soldiers, they need to reorganize the community stores to sort out the new supplies.
. It's what he's been taught to say, what he's been trained, and that's not what Steve wants. It's probably a defense mechanism – if Tony is feeling unsure, he'll fall back on those habits, that training, but Steve doesn't want Tony's training. He wants
He can't become a scientist or an engineer, working in one of the cities in the kingdom to build things and repair systems.
"Okay. Thank you, for coming for a walk with me," Steve says, still watching him carefully. "Would you… like to have dinner with me? Soon? It doesn't have to be tonight, it can be tomorrow, or the day after. Or… I don't know, you might be busy."
"Only mine," Steve agrees, and he's rolling Tony over, hitching his hips up so Tony is on his hands and knees, presenting properly, the way he'd been taught, and Tony shifts his legs apart, shows off his hole, knowing it's wet and open and begging to be filled.
At the same time, he can't help but wonder… will Steve like him? Will Steve, maybe, find him attractive?
Tony sighs, and takes a long, slow sip of his wine. "I really didn't mean to offend you, or insult your kingdom," he starts, straightening his shoulders as though preparing himself to walk to the gallows. "America is lovely, and you should be proud of it."
"I can only imagine they told you it could hurt to prepare you in case you were bonded with an Alpha who wasn't gentle," Steve says, trying to keep the anger out of his voice. He hates that he has to have this conversation, that Tony doesn't already
"You can't stay until spring, Tony," Pepper reminds him, wrapping herself in an additional few layers of clothing. "We'll be in America in days."
Not that he has any control over his heat whatsoever. He misses the suppressants desperately. He wonders if Steve had really meant it when he said Tony could go back on them after they… consummate.
"Ah," Tony says. This, he understands. He's used to the curious stares and gawking when people realize they're in the presence of a Consort. That kind of attention, he can handle.
"I know that, and you know that, but literally no one else does." Bucky holds up a hand to stop Steve's next protest. "If you don't give a shit how the rest of the kingdom sees you, think about it from
"There's the palace," Pepper murmurs into his ear, leaning into his space. He looks up in surprise, his heart hammering in his chest. He can see it before them. It's still a ways away, but the ground is even and the snow has been packed down by traffic before them, so Tony can see it clearly up the road.
Steve pulls all the way out, heart clenching at Tony's sob of loss, and hurries to slide off the bed, grabbing Tony by the hips to haul him over to the edge and push him over onto his belly.
"Yeah, Steve asked that Prince Anthony dine with him tonight." Wilson turns to Tony. "If that's okay with you?"
"So," Steve says, once the young man leaves them alone again. He gestures to Tony's plate. "Eat up."
. Steve drives his tongue into Tony's mouth, hunting his taste and heat and slickness. Tony sighs, rocking forward on Steve's lap.
When they get to Tony's rooms, Rhodey stays at the door while Pepper whirls into action. She's laying out tools on the tables – a shaving blade, creams and gels and perfumes, kohl liner. She dumps a pile of lacy underthings on the bed, and Tony's face goes red again. She's seen it all – hell, she'd picked most of it out. And at this point, Tony doesn't have a lot of modesty left. But still, now it's all
Steve puts him down on it gently, using his body to push Tony onto his back. He takes hold of Tony's hands, pushes them up over his head and down onto the mattress. When Steve releases them, Tony keeps them there obediently, so Steve gives him one more kiss before pulling back, lifting himself up, and moving to stand at the edge of the bed between Tony's spread knees. His hands slowly go to Tony's waistband, telegraphing his intention.
He can feel the irritation, the warmth of it prickling under his skin like an itch. His body is preparing itself for heat by making him moody and overly hot, which is quite frankly just a little over the top, he decides. Isn't it bad enough that, as a male Omega, he has no property rights, no bonding rights, and no reproductive capabilities? He has to have mood swings and uncontrollable sexual desire on top of it?
"I have Pepper and Rhodey," Tony says, mildly affronted on their behalf. "He's been my bodyguard for years."
"You think I'm a punishment for him." Steve's not surprised. He'd come to the same conclusion, himself. It would help explain Tony's reluctance to open up, his inability to relax. His general fear of Steve and this place – if he'd thought his father was sending him here as punishment, of course he would expect pain and mistreatment.
"I see," Prince Anthony says, looking deep in thought. "It will take some getting used to, but I can try."
Tony makes a noise that sounds like a strangled laugh, but he clamps down on it right away, like he hasn't meant to let it out. "I'm in heat, and I'm slick," Tony gasps. "How much more ready can I get?"
He wiggles, pressing his ass to Steve. He's not sure when Steve had turned him, rolled him and spooned up behind him to hold him in their doze, but he feels safe, protected here. Warm in Steve's arms.
Bucky stares at him. "That exam is gonna be a hell of a lot easier on him than what's gonna happen if we don't do it."
Tony slides a hand down the inside of Steve's thigh, lets his thumb caress the tight, furled hole between his cheeks.
," Tony snaps, and Rhodey chuckles to himself as he leaves the room to, presumably, check on the status of their trunks.
"You can… go ahead and schedule whatever you need to," Steve says. "But whatever the result… I don't want to hear about it, okay?"
"Let me – let me talk to Tony about it, okay? Before you – before you do anything." He directs this last to Bruce, who just nods.
Tony studies him for a moment. "Alright." He starts to walk slowly toward a row of flowers, bushes and stalks planted in a manner that looks haphazard, but flows quite nicely.
"This is me making a choice," he tells them. "A choice about how everyone else's life is going to go after this."
It sits heavy in his belly, mostly because he's sure he's said something to offend Tony. But he'd been compelled to tell him that he hadn't contracted with King Howard to get some kind of sex slave, that
Steve studies him again, then reaches down and picks an alstroemeria stem. He presents it to Tony with a half-smile.
"Fucking — harder," Tony says, pushing his hips back to meet Steve's thrusts, and Steve obliges, his big, thick cock and his half-swollen knot stretching Tony, opening him wide and he knows if Steve pulled out, his hole would gape, he would feel so empty, and he wants Steve to stay in him forever, always.
"And if I could give you a team of strong men. Men and tools and whatever else you needed. Could you do that here?"
"You can still back out," Bucky says softly. "I'm givin' you the gears here, I know, but the real bitch of it is that this is going to be it for you, pal. You don't get to choose how the rest of your life goes after this."
Steve decides to seek out Sam after dinner. He needs advice about what to do with Tony – how can he get to know him when Tony won't answer any questions, will barely look him in the eye?
She gives him an unimpressed look. "I just came from there. He was moping, so I didn't stay after I told him what I'd learned."
"So what's the big deal about the whole Omega Consort thing anyway?" Clint asks, wiping jelly-covered hands from his pastry over his shirt.
Tony can't help the shiver, the way his eyelashes flutter as though his eyes want to roll back into his head – again. God, he'd come so many times in the last three days he's not actually certain how it is that he's able to walk right now. Plus Steve's amazing, ridiculous, huge-but-not-terrifying-at-all-after-the-first-time-anyway cock had felt so good inside him, had made him feel things he hadn't known he could feel. God, it had been the most amazing heat, the most amazing sex on the planet.
The note had explained that Steve's new bondmate was, in fact, the Omega son of King Howard himself. Not that, Steve supposes, that's any kind of positive aspect in most people's eyes.
The coach comes to a stop in front of the main doors of the castle. The rest of the caravan had stopped further away, in the city proper, under the direction of two men who had waved them down. One would take the stores, and one would take the army.
"You're stunning," Steve breathes, hands clenched tight around Tony's hips to help him lift and drop. "Gorgeous."
"You live in America now," Steve tells him. "I may not be able to change the laws across the countryside, but I can do this. From now on, whenever you want to build something, or invent something, you can do it. I don't care if you're an Omega."
. God, it's disgusting. He's tall, and his shoulders are a mile wide, and his hands are big and soft-looking and gentle and strong. Christ. Tony had barely been able to stop staring at him the whole night.
"What else was I supposed to say?" Steve growled. "He already feels like he's, I don't know, beholden to me in some way–"
"Oh, god, Steve," Tony moans, shifting against the mattress. He looks like he's trying to get away and get closer at the same time. "What are you – oh, god."
Bucky has been Steve's friend since long before Steve had been named Lord of America – since before they'd both joined the army, even. Bucky had pulled Steve out of one of many scrapes with an angry older boy when they were both children, and they'd been inseparable since then. Bucky had been there his whole life, up until the Beta had gone off to join the war effort to fight back the Hydra hordes for King Howard. He'd been gone to war for nearly a year when Steve had found the apothecary on the edge of the province. The one who had given him an elixir that had cured his many maladies and had transformed him from a sickly, tiny Alpha into the bulky, robust one he is today.
But Howard had, as usual, exceeded all expectations, and now he's being sent to some isolated warlord in the middle of nowhere.
"I wanted – I wanted to talk to you," Steve says again, suddenly uncomfortable with the conversation. "About… something."
"I'll take you through this wing first – it's where I live, and where Bucky and Clint live – Bucky is the captain of the guard, technically, but he's been Steve's friend since they were small, and Clint is his bondmate. Ms. Potts and Captain Rhodes, we've set aside some rooms for you here."
He breaks his mouth away, kissing hotly up the line of Tony's jaw. He threads his fingers through Tony's hair and pulls, exposing his long, graceful neck so Steve can press hot, sucking kisses on the tender flesh.
Steve takes a grape and puts it in his mouth, follows it quickly with a little cube of cheese. After the fifth bite, Tony finally reaches forward and takes a blueberry and brings it to his lips.
"Patience, love," Steve murmurs against his mouth, and Tony whines, tries to hitch his hips and get some friction on his cock. Steve is hard, too, Tony can feel his erection, the base thick and heavy, the length of it deliciously long.
His knot thickens, and Steve can't help it, he grinds himself in deeper, tries to get as deep into Tony as he can as his knot locks them together, stretching the rim of Tony's entrance.
A slow smile stretches across Tony's face, and it's filled with hope. It looks beautiful on his face.
"Stay here," Steve tells him with another gentle squeeze to his hand. Steve slides out of the bed and moves over to the table with its spread of food. He fills a plate with a selection of items and pours them each a glass of wine. He rests the plate on his forearm and takes a glass in each hand, bringing them back over to the bedside table. He puts the glasses down first, then the plate, and crawls back into bed.
Steve gentles his tone, sitting all the way up and placing a gentle hand over Tony's, locked together. He squeezes a little, then brings his other hand forward to pull Tony's hands apart. He brings one up to his mouth so he can press a light kiss to Tony's palm.
Tony shifts up on his knees, tilts his hips and starts to push down, reaching one hand down to hold the base of Steve's cock, right at the beginning of his knot. He slides down, engulfing Steve in his slick, welcoming heat.
But now, the day they're announcing his virginity to the kingdom – for Steve's benefit – he's not even around?
Steve had immediately gone to the front lines to help with the war, and risen through the ranks to lead his own company – a company he had insisted Bucky join. Steve had led Bucky and their men to the heart of the Hydra kingdom and defeated their leader, the Red Skull, effectively ending the war. Bucky had lost an arm in the battle, and Erskine, the apothecary who had given Steve his potion, had died while they were away.
When Steve finds himself walking down the corridors of the castle toward Prince Anthony's hallway, he wants nothing more than to turn tail and run. He's faced down Hydra hordes, warriors and beasts and he's even faced down Natasha on a bad day, but the idea of meeting his Omega Consort has him tied up in knots.
"What about right now?" Steve growls, reaching up and digging his fingers into Tony's hair, tugging it to expose more of his throat. "Do you want me to knot you like this, or should I turn you over and mount you properly?"
Steve wraps his hands around Tony's waist in return, spreading his fingers wide so he can touch as much of Tony as possible. Steve can feel the heat of his skin through his clothing.
He'd tried showing his father some of his designs, once. Mostly they were weaponry, because he'd been hoping that might interest Howard enough to actually look at them. But instead, the King had simply crumpled them up and thrown them out, throwing Tony out of his drawing room.
Tony's cheeks – which, honestly, shouldn't he be immune to sexual embarrassment by now? – heat and he scowls at her. "Stop that. I'm not going to talk about my… relations with my bondmate. Not with you."
"Don't forget the Chitauri," Bucky says, leaning forward and plucking another pastry from the basket.
"Morning," Steve says, tilting his head up with a grin. Tony leans down to kiss the top of his head, resisting the urge to just drop into Steve's lap for a cuddle. The paperwork looks important.
No. This whole trip has felt like a death sentence because if he's not very, very careful, it may actually be one.
Steve's hard against his hip, and Tony is spent, sated, but he wants to make Steve feel good, needs it. More than air, more than water or food or sun, he wants to feel Steve fall apart in his arms the way Steve has ruined and rebuilt Tony so many times.
"Of course," Steve finally says, tearing his eyes away from Prince Anthony's. He gestures to the hallway behind him. "I was – I was hoping to take you to dinner, Prince – Prince Anthony."
what to expect. And he hadn't been able to bring himself to ask about Steve's knot, because how exactly do you bring that up over dinner with your new bondmate? "Oh, hey, I heard the potion you took made your knot the size of my head can you not shove it in me please?"
Tony had thought, maybe, Steve had liked him, at least a little bit. At least, he hadn't treated Tony like dirt on his shoe, or anything. Hadn't Steve wanted to be here for this? Sure, he'd said he didn't care whether Tony was a virgin, but those are just words. He should still be here to confirm it, to make sure Howard hadn't sent some whoring, used-up Omega.
"It'll be easier from behind," Steve whispers into his ear. "If I mount you. But if you want, I can still take you like this without hurting you."
"You're gorgeous," he breathes, palm sliding over the lace over Tony's ribs. Tony's whole body shivers, his eyelashes flutter and he swallows.
"Come here," Steve tells him, and Tony does. He expects Steve to get in the bath so Tony can wash him, clean him of the sweat and come and slick from Tony's body. Instead, Steve kisses him soundly and pushes him toward the tub, helping Tony step over the side and into the wonderfully hot water.
Steve growls triumphantly, rolling them to the side and hitching one of Tony's legs up so he can fuck into the Omega's body more deeply.
Steve blinks at him, looking stricken. "Oh, Tony," he says, and Tony can't help but glance up. He's expecting pity, but he doesn't think that's what this is. It's sympathy, maybe. But not outright pity. "I'm not disappointed in you."
"It's definitely happening tonight," Tony says, barrelling through the open door to Pepper's chambers. Rhodey follows after him, and Tony ignores the eyeroll he gives Pepper.
Because a male Omega wouldn't be able to produce children with a male Alpha. The genetics are simple – the Alpha and Omega genes are recessive, and the only way to produce an Alpha or an Omega child would be to have one parent be an Alpha and the other an Omega. Beta parents almost always produce Beta children, since the Beta gene is dominant. But there's a flaw in the evolution of the male Omegas. They have a womb and heats, but because of the mutation that allows for an Omega to be a male, a fertilized egg won't survive.
With a Herculean effort, Tony heaves himself up, swings a leg over so he can straddle Steve's lap, leaning down to kiss Steve. For once, Steve lets him lead the kiss, lets him decide the depth and speed. Tony takes his time, exploring that beautiful mouth leisurely. Steve shifts under him, and Tony is reminded of the somewhat insistent erection pressing against the inside of his thigh.
"Your cock is huge," Tony laughs, breathless. "I'd heard stories, and I've had it in me before, but Jesus."
Steve sets Tony down on a chair, pressing his hips down into it. "Stay here," he orders, and Tony wants to disobey, wants to stand up just to be ornery, but he doesn't. He stays on the chair, even as Steve straightens up to his full height, naked and glorious in the firelight. Steve watches him for a moment, as though to ensure Tony will obey his orders, and Tony gives a little shiver. He wonders what Steve would do if he did disobey — would he turn Tony over his knee? Would there be punishment? Or would Steve be sweet and gentle and solicitous, as he's been up to now?
They keep walking through halls while Wilson points out the kitchens, the dining hall, and they begin to move into the residential wings.
"Lots of flowers have more than one meaning," Tony continues. "Take the yellow rose, for example. On the one hand, it can mean joy, friendship. On the other hand, it can also mean jealousy, a decrease of love."
A slow, wicked smile spreads across Steve's lips. "I'll show you," he says. He pushes Tony's hips down to the bed, none too gently, and manhandles him so one knee is pushed up and out, spreading his thighs wide apart. Tony flops down onto his belly, unable to hold himself up against Steve's pressure, and Steve buries his face, finally, in the lace between Tony's cheeks.
It's dark, almost black but with a wine-coloured sheen in the light. It's only one piece, more of a bodysuit than anything. The thighs are cut straight across, so it'll accentuate his muscular thighs, and leave more to the imagination when he turns around and shows his ass. It's a halter neck, and a deep V, and it will leave his back entirely bare, and leave him bare in the front to his navel.
It's slower this time, but no less heated. With Tony above him the scent of his arousal in the air, Steve can't think of anything else. His tongue licks into Tony's mouth, and Tony reaches back behind himself to take hold of Steve's hard cock.
, Tony," Rhodey reiterates, watching the castle as they approach it. It's late afternoon, and the sun is already low on the horizon. The short days of the winter seem somehow even shorter out here, this far from home.
Steve leads him into the dining room and pulls out a chair for him, tucking it in as Prince Anthony sits down. He takes a deep breath, then goes around to the other side of the table to find his own seat. It's a smaller table, but there's still quite a bit of space between the two of them.
Tony bursts out laughing, surprised by the off-colour joke from her. "At least we can take comfort in the fact Howard sent you and Rhodey with me. Though, I
It's different this time – it's the kind of orgasm only an Omega can have on a knot, and Tony writhes, shakes, shudders with pleasure that seems to go on forever. His eyes are rolled back in his head, his limbs jerking, his body clenching hard and fast as he comes and comes.
Tony glances up into Steve's face, feeling a pressure in his chest he can't identify. The truth is, he's touched. No one has ever gone to the trouble of giving him a gift before, even if it is a bundle of poison oak.
Tony whimpers, clenches down experimentally, then tilts his hips up. "Please, Steve, fuck me," he says. "Fuck me and knot me."
"That's it, sweetheart," Steve praises, carrying him across the room, out into the washing room. The bath is there half filled with water. There's a large basin over the fire, the water hot and rumbling.
"Oh, Lord Steven!" she calls back over her shoulder, eyes twinkling merrily because she's awful. "You have a visitor!"
He leans forward and wraps his arms under Tony's chest, under his hips, and pulls him close against Steve's torso. He's strong enough to lift Tony without any trouble, so he picks Tony up, holding him so that his knot stays in place. Tony moans mindlessly as Steve rolls and lays on his back on the bed, letting his legs dangle off the side. Tony's legs are draped over the outside of Steve's thighs, so when Steve spreads his knees apart, it spreads Tony's legs further apart.
The appointment with Dr. Banner goes well. Tony had expected it to – he is, after all, still untouched by an Alpha – but he wouldn't have put it past his father to plant some misleading evidence or buy the doctor off entirely just to embarrass him. So, either his father had left it alone, or his attempt to make the doctor lie had been unfruitful.
Pepper's small, dry hand covers one of his, but she doesn't say anything. Tony stares at the castle as they approach, his knee bouncing anxiously.
. Science and math and engineering. He wanted to take things apart, learn how they ticked, then put them back together better than they'd started off.
Bucky glares at him, but before he can retort by telling Steve what a monumental idiot he is, the drawing room door opens and Clint walks in.
Tony blinks – he wouldn't have expected Barnes to be perceptive enough to sniff out the little white lies.
He doesn't pretend not to know what she's talking about, but he doesn't agree to it, either. She walks out the door without a second look back, as though she knows he won't be able to
She helps him shave off all his body hair and neaten up his goatee, using a basin of warmed water, then uses the rest of the hot water to fill the bathtub.
"No, no, it's – better. It's okay, I have to talk to you." Steve sighs, and leads Tony back over to the bed. Tony's ass twitches, a bead of slick forming as he thinks of all the lovely things Steve had done to him in that bed.
"We don't do things in the shadows in America," Barnes tells him. "We're honest around here – about what we do, what we want, and who we are. Can you say the same?"
He takes Steve's long, thick cock into his mouth, opening his throat and taking him as deeply as he can, pushing all the way down before sucking his way up, swirling his tongue around the smooth head, and plunging back down.
"I want you, too," Tony moans, arching his back. Steve nips at the thin skin at his collar bone, and Tony cries out. Steve can feel his cock, hard between them, has hard as Steve's own. "I didn't think I'd – but I do, god."
"Good answer," Natasha says, gracefully climbing to her feet. She takes one more grape, and heads for the door. A moment before she reaches it, there's a sharp rap on the wood. Steve feels his heart jump.
"So, you're King Howard's heir," Barnes says, and it sounds not-quite light. Ah. Tony supposes he should have expected suspicion. The highest ruler's only son sent off to bond with a provincial Lord at the edge of the kingdom – and most people wouldn't know just how very much Howard hates his Omega son.
Steve sighs, and it sounds relieved. Of course he does. Tony understands – Steve doesn't want to take Tony to bed again, but it would be better if the kingdom thinks of them as bondmates. Meals together are a good way of solidifying that. Steve would know that.
He dips his tongue inside then, feeling the tight muscle stretch around him, and Steve moans, his balls twitching against Tony's forehead.
Now, he regrets it. He'd always sort of felt that Howard sending him to the Academy had been more punishment than anything else. Punishment for being an Omega. Punishment for Maria's death, for the death of his baby brother – though he'd had nothing to do with any of that.
Tony looks over her shoulder, at the people – the engineers – in the hallway, at Rhodey. Rhodey has an odd expression on his face, as well. Some mixture of tentative awe, encouragement, even pride.
She glances back at him as she heads for the door, but he doesn't meet her eyes. "I don't know what I said," she says. "I'm sorry."
Tony rolls his eyes. "You might as well call me 'Tony'," he says, frowning. He's kept most of Steve's friends treating him more formally than that, and he's not entirely sure why he's not doing the same with Natasha. Maybe it's the way she's made herself at home. Or the way she's managing to disrespect all his personal space boundaries while still managing to be quite respectful.
Steve growls, surging forward to push Tony down onto his back in one quick movement, driving into him hard and fast.
"Exactly," Steve growls, surging to his feet and capturing Tony's mouth again. He keeps his hands on Tony's sweet rear, pulling them together so their groins grind together. Tony is just as hard as Steve is, and suddenly Steve wants all the fabric out of the way. He lifts Tony up by the hips, and Tony's legs automatically wind around Steve's waist. He's light enough, and Steve is strong enough, that Steve can carry him that way, so he does, moving across the room toward the bed. It's huge, dressed in soft grey fabrics. Steve keeps kissing him as they walk, letting Tony writhe in his arms, rolling his hips and grinding his cock against Steve, until they reach the bed.
"Hello." Tony's at the door, looking soft and beautiful. He's dressed down as compared to the day before, though he looks a little flustered. "It's good to see you, my lord."
It's enough to remind Steve that, over the few minutes they've been kissing, he's gotten rock hard with arousal. The smell of Tony's own arousal is thick in the air, and Steve wants to drown in that scent forever.
Steve's loving arms. He can admit that, now. That Steve cares for him just as deeply as Tony cares for Steve. Steve has been nothing but kind, has been gentle and generous and Tony hadn't ever expected it. But it's time to stop hiding from it.
Tony swallows, glancing down at Steve's cock, then back up to his face, as though searching for a lie.
"I don't know," Steve admits. "But make sure you spread it around to watch what we say and do in front of him, just in case."
"But I'm gonna have to get used to it, first," Tony says, and with a wink he crawls onto his knees between Steve's feet, wraps his beautiful, graceful hand around Steve's erection, and leans forward to let the head of it slip between his plush, slick, pink lips.
Prince Anthony swallows, his throat bobbing with the force of it, then stands up, looking up at Steve from underneath his black eyelashes. Steve is mesmerized by the way Prince Anthony's eyes are so sharply framed, and wonders if he's wearing kohl around the rims to define them better, or if it's fully natural.
Barnes looks like he's about to say something else, but Wilson comes up behind him, popping his head between Clint's and Barnes', and slapping them both on the shoulders.
"Oh, god," Tony moans, ass clenching around Steve's cock. Steve nestles his nose into the back of Tony's neck, scenting him and breathing him in, even as his other hand drags itself up to Tony's nipple, pinching and rolling the little brown bead between his fingers. Tony writhes, bringing one arm up behind his head to card his fingers through Steve's hair.
Steve chuckles, pride and lust pooling low in his belly, and Tony's cheeks turn scarlet at the admission.
He'd be lying if he said he hadn't been thinking about the more… intimate details of taking on a Consort as a bondmate. At the same time, the thought of it all makes him uncomfortable more than anything else. What if King Howard sends him a simpering fool of an Omega? Or worse, one with cunning and more loyalty to Howard than to their new Alpha? Steve doesn't think they're doing anything out here in America that could be a problem, but he still isn't sure he'd be comfortable with a spy coming into his home.
"Please," Steve says. Tony expects him to offer an elbow for Tony to take, but he only gestures to the hallway, offering for Tony to precede him. "After you," he says.
And Steve has always been awkward when it comes to dating, so going into this knowing he and the prince are already bonded is making it that much more daunting.
Steve doesn't say anything for a long moment, but when he does, his voice is gruff. "I – I'll be ready," he says. "You can come to my chambers."
"You're not gonna run, Tony," Rhodey says as the coach pulls through the gates. It's the last chance, and he hadn't
"I… actually don't know," Steve admits, glancing down at the contracts. "The contracts don't name them. Just that the Consort will be sent shortly before they enter their heat, and we have to consummate the bonding during that first heat." Steve ignores Clint's lewd eyebrow waggling. "In exchange, we get the men, the foodstuffs, and the weaponry we need to protect America from the Chitauri."
"One of the things they taught us, in our classes, was the language of flowers. Have you heard of the concept?"
a surprise about the whole thing is that Tony is in the bed by himself, wrapped up in a cocoon of comfortable blankets. His skin feels tacky with dried sweat and slick and semen, but it also feels blessedly cool.
"That's it, honey," Steve murmurs, picking up the pace. He can already feel the base of his cock swelling, his knot forming and preparing to lock them together. He wants to see Tony come before that happens, so he reaches between them and wraps his hand around Tony's cock, stroking in time with his thrusts as he picks up the pace, fucks into Tony's body harder and faster.
Pepper leans forward and gives him a light kiss on the cheek before she gets out of the coach to join Rhodey and the men outside. "The seaside will be nice in the summer," she tells him. "As for the winter, well, it will be over before we know it."
He crawls into bed without cleaning his teeth or anything else, burrowing under the blankets. He wants to hide, to die of shame.
Natasha takes a moment to look back and forth between them before she rolls her eyes, and steps aside to allow Tony entry. He steps through the door and into the room, and it takes all of Steve's willpower not to step forward and pull Tony against his body.
Tony starts talking about the weather as they eat, keeping his bites small and far apart. Steve feels awkward, not sure how to get back the easiness they'd had the last time they'd been in this room together.
"The way you phrased it, Steve… it sounds like you were trying to let him down easy. Like you'd gotten your knot off, had the contractually obligated heat sex, and now you're done with him."
Bruce lets out a breath. Ms. Potts seemed to think it was standard, but I've never – I've never performed one. I know how, but it isn't–"
"Not if we don't go straight down," Steve tells him. "We'll go around the perimeter, toward the beach, so they can't sneak up on us. It'll go fast, you'll see."
"How do you feel, love?" Steve asks him, moving up to lay beside Tony. Tony is sprawled out on the bed, not sure what day it is or how long Steve has been torturing him so sweetly, or how to answer that. He feels everything.
Tony shrugs one shoulder, taking a bite of chocolate from the plate and biting into it. "It just made sense to me."
"Well, then, that's going to work out fine for me," Steve rumbled, moving his hand down to cup Tony's balls, stroking and petting at them before moving down, pushing between Tony's legs and back, back to his hole, already slick again with want. "Because I want you, too. All the time, Tony."
Steve is saved, temporarily at least, from any further awkwardness when one of the kitchen staff enters with a large serving trolley. He places a plate in front of each of them, filled with roasted elk, some spiced sauce, and some roasted potatoes. There's even a small pile of purple cabbage on the plate, and a rich, red slice of tomato. The kitchens had gone all out, it seems. They haven't got a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables, after the failed harvest.
"Oh, I knew you were okay," she says. "I did my homework. I just thought I'd properly introduce myself, and I wanted to get to know you a little better."
Steve obliges the request, hands gripping Tony's hips hard, and there will be bruises. Bruises that Tony will press his fingers into, tomorrow, to feel the sharp edge and revel in it, in how much Steve wants him. Steve is fucking into him hard, and Tony cries out with every thrust, but he pushes back, too, matching Steve's rhythm and meeting his wildness with a wildness of his own. Steve pulls Tony's hips back, pulling him onto his cock, growling and fucking Tony harder than he's ever been fucked in his life.
"Call me Steve," he says. "I don't – everyone around here calls me Steve. Except, I mean, some of the house staff and the townspeople. But, I mean, everyone who lives here… they knew me before. They're my friends. They all call me Steve, and I'd… I'd like it if you did, too."
"Yes, I do," Steve says. "Of course I do, Tony. I shouldn't have left you alone. I should have found a way."
"Nah. I just never liked bullies, and if anyone was a bully, it was Hydra. So I went to see an apothecary in the village. I didn't expect… I just wanted to be healthier, really. So I could do my part and fight. But he had something different, something special. It made me healthy, sure, but it also made me taller and stronger and faster."
"Oh, I'm not here to dish out anything," Natasha says, idly running a finger over the side table as she makes her way around the room. They don't talk about it, and Steve doesn't acknowledge it, but he knows she's walking the perimeter to double check exits and escape routes before she sits down on the sofa across from him. It's her way, and he's well used to Natasha's ways by now.
Sam gives him a warm, wide smile, and it brightens the gloom of the room immediately. "See, that right there? That's what you'd call a good start."
"I told you, it doesn't matter that you're an Omega. No one here knows how to build aqueducts, or how to keep water basins heated all day. No one but you. Being an Omega won't stop you, here. If you have the manpower and the tools, would you be able to build it?"
He doesn't understand this place. At home, this kind of announcement is met with all the pomp and circumstance it requires. There are speeches, maybe a nice religious song about abstinence, and the crowd is excited.
Steve reaches down and tests the water with a hand, pours more of the boiling water in. Another test with his hand, then he takes the basin and hangs it back over the fire.
"No," Tony says, his voice cracking a little. He doesn't take his eyes off Steve, either. "No, thank you, Ms. Potts. That will be all."
Tony thinks. "Like I can't handle it when you go. You're going to have to go, and I'm going to have to stay here, and it will be fine. It will always be fine."
"Why wouldn't I want to?" Tony asks, jerking his head up, looking panicked. "Of course I – you're my Alpha, and anything you want to do to – with me, I would want that–"
Steve gives one shoulder a sad little hitch up. "That's the thing about being a leader, Buck. Sometimes you have to sacrifice the things you want in order to make sure your people have the things they need. We don't have the stores, the soldiers,
The corner of Tony's mouth ticks up. "I know," he says, surprising himself with the truthfulness of it.
"Reports from the front?" Tony asks, leaning back against Steve's crooked elbow. "Things going okay?"
"It looks like it'll blow over in a stiff wind," Tony says grimly, putting his notebook into a satchel beside him. "God, isn't there a place we can stop first? So I can, I don't know, freshen up or something?"
"Because Nat told him about the Chitauri," Bucky shrugged. "Nat told him the Chitauri are probably gonna invade, and you know how he responded? By building weapons to protect us. To protect
She squeezes his shoulder in her small hand, then stands up and heads for the door. "Now, I've been on the road for two weeks, I need a hot bath and bottle of wine."
Pepper moves in front of him, which is when he realizes he's pacing. She's holding an empty vase, and there's a strange expression on her face – like she's trying to hide a smile.
"Wanna watch you come like this all the time," Steve growls, grinding his knot deeper into Tony's prostate, reveling in the way Tony whines and gasps and squeezes around him. More slick leaks out between them, and Steve's thighs are soaked, wet and slick with Tony's fluids, and it's so hot Steve's own cock gives another valiant twitch, pulsing and spurting more come into Tony's body.
"So that's it, then, huh?" Clint asks, breaking through Steve's thoughts. "You sign that and you're bonded forever?"
"Right, but he's still an Alpha," he says, watching as Pepper packs up a small bag to take with them. Perfumes and creams and candles. There's more in his chambers – a whole trunk of toiletries designed to help him be as attractive and demure as possible.
He hasn't had a heat before; once he'd reached puberty age, he'd been given the usual suppressants. He's been on them since he was 12, through his days at the Academy and while waiting to find out who he was being sold to – bonded to.
Cold in the pit of Tony's stomach, but he steels himself for the rest of it. He knows what's coming.
"So," Steve starts, after another moment of unbearable silence. "What do you like to, um, do for fun?"
"I can't promise he will. But he seems like a good Lord – a good man. I can't think of any reason he wouldn't like you, but Tony… if he doesn't, he'll still be kind to you, I think."
"That's good," Steve says, pressing back in. He licks and sucks, using his hands to push Tony's legs apart, spread his cheeks. After a few moments, he slides his fingers in under the lace and pulls it to the side, stretching it over and up to expose Tony's slick, soft hole.
"You're amazing," Steve breathes. "God, I can't believe I get to have you. For as long as you want," he says, letting go of his legs and pulling Tony up to kiss him, uncaring of where Tony's mouth has been, uninterested in the mess of semen between them. "I'm yours for as long as you want me."
"Your highness," Natasha says, dipping her chin lightly in a loose approximation of a bow, and gracefully moving to sit at the table with him before he can even stand to greet her more politely.
Will his Alpha allow him his own room? His books, his tools, the many things he enjoys tinkering with? Or will he be locked in a dungeon between heats? God, the possibilities are endless, each more horrifying than the last.
An Omega wouldn't be able to inherit the throne, according to the laws. Beyond that, a male Omega wouldn't be able to parent any children.
Tony's cock and belly are slick and messy with his own come, his cock still half-hard. Steve reaches down and wraps his hand around it, stroking it slowly but purposefully.
"Nothing – nothing special, really," Prince Anthony says. His eyes take on a panicked look. "I don't – what do
"No," Bruce says, squirming uncomfortably. "No, that's not it. It was, um, about a – an exam? A virtue exam?"
Steve pulls his fingers out and takes hold of the base of his own cock, shifting down so he can angle himself. He lets the tip of his cock slide across Tony's hot, slick entrance, but he doesn't push in yet. Just gives Tony time to get used to the idea, to relax.
Tony deepens the kiss, letting out a quiet whine as he shifts and climbs over Steve to straddle his lap.
Tony wraps his legs around Steve's hips for purchase, grinding against him as Steve walks them through to the bedroom, to the bed, and he lays them down, covering Tony's body with his own.
"It doesn't matter what you want," she interrupts him. "What matters is that Anthony will be coming here under duress. That's a choice you made for him, that he would be bonded forever to an Alpha he's never met."
"I'm… I'm good," Tony says, and it's an honest answer. Steve lets his thumb slide back and forth on Tony's skin where his arm is wrapped around his waist.
"When you're right, you're right," Tony says, pulling his shirt up over his head, shoving his pants down to his knees. He's not wearing elaborate lace undergarments this time; he's naked instantly, and Steve's hips judder in the empty air at the sight.
"I wanted to introduce myself," he continues. "I'm James Barnes, I'm the Captain of the Guard here in America, and a good friend to Lord Steven."
It's enough to make Steve's cock throb inside him, more come spurting in, and Steve's balls pulse as he empties himself again. Tony cries and cries until the aftershocks start to settle, and he lies bonelessly under Steve. His body shivers from time to time, but he's barely conscious.
Which means no heir. Steve could name a successor, but King Howard could just annex the province and fold it back into Starkland Kingdom. It would be a terrible scandal to take Steve's kingdom from him while he's still alive, but without an heir to Steve's throne, there's nothing to stop him once Steve is dead and gone.
Barnes stares at him for another moment, then deftly steps to the side and gestures at the man with him. "This is my mate, Clint Barton."
"Steve," Tony moans, water sloshing out the side of the tub as he thrusts his hips up, seeking friction again even as Steve rubs at his sensitive prostate.
His knot starts to shrink down, but Steve's cock stays rock hard – he attributes it to the feeling of Tony's ass clenching around him, slick and full of Steve's own come, as well as the sight of Tony writhing as Steve jerks him off, and the tiny, breathless moans he's making.
"Aqueducts?" Steve purposefully keeps any judgement out of his voice. Honestly, it's not difficult – he really is curious as to what an aqueduct is.
Pepper snorts, picking up a pitcher and filling it with bathwater. She uses it to rinse his hair. "You know exactly what to do, Tony. You aced all those classes."
Tony sighs happily, burrowing into the bedding. His hand slides down Steve's arm, and he laces his fingers with Steve before he falls asleep.
"It's all the way to the south," Steve grimaces. "And we can't go straight down, that would be too risky."
God, really? He thinks. He wonders how long the pre-heat irritability will go on. How is he supposed to know when he's
"Good," Steve says, tearing his eyes away. He cuts off a substantially larger piece of meat for himself, thrusting it into his mouth before he can say anything else inane.
"Sweet pea," Tony murmurs, not quite able to meet his eyes. "Departure after having a good time." He swallows. "I had a nice time, today."
, Tony thinks. He takes a deep breath. "Yellow means 'disdain'," he says. "'Disappointment'. Even 'rejection'."
"Tony," Steve says, and leaves it at that. He does reach out and place a hand on Tony's knee in a gesture meant to be comforting.
Tony is desperate, gorgeous, and needy, and Steve wants to give him everything. He wants to give Tony the hard fucking he's begging for.
Tony tears his mouth away, and Steve has enough decency to let him go, to drop his hands and let Tony stand up off the sofa. Tony stands before him, cheeks flushed, hair wild, and lips red and swollen from Steve's rough treatment of them.
"You're a menace," He breathes, and Steve huffs a laugh another gentle kiss pressed against Tony's collarbone.
But knowing she's an Omega, and one that had lived through the Krasnyygorod training programs… well, he feels a kinship with her.
Tony's blush has settled down, and he's lifted his eyes to watch Steve, though he still looks a little timid. Steve hands him a glass of the wine, and moves the plate onto the bed between them.
He could choose that light blue number with the lace, it would bring out the shape of his shoulders. But that little red set shows off his ass better.
"That was…" Tony starts, then doesn't finish it. Steve doesn't need him to, though, so he just grins and crawls over Tony's body to kiss him.
"Is it dangerous?" Tony is suddenly gripped with a choking sensation, a tightness in his chest. What if something were to happen to Steve? He'd be out there, unprotected against the elements and the enemy, and it could be an ambush. Steve could end up killed or captured. What would happen to Tony then? Surely he'd be shipped back to Howard, in disgrace and used, and he'd never be able to escape again.
of Starkland. Why doesn't he just give us the aid we need to protect his own borders? If the Chitauri get through here, they're going through to Starkland anyway. Why does he insist you take a Consort?"
"Sure," Tony says. "I always wanted to be an engineer, or an inventor, but I'm an Omega." He shrugs, as though that's the end of the topic.
"I… enjoy reading as well," Prince Anthony says, looking as uncomfortable as Steve feels. "I'm afraid I don't have a lot of practice at running, my lord, but I could –"
Prince Anthony just smiles at him, but it doesn't quite reach his eyes – it's not anything like the beautiful little smile Steve had seen a few moments ago.
He can feel Tony's cock growing hard against Steve's belly, and he can feel Tony's ass getting slick with desire as he moves over Steve's lap. Tony seems particularly amourous, and Steve hopes it's more than just a show of gratitude for inviting Tony to do some proper engineering in the kingdom.
"Well, I mean, there were rumours. About the elixir you'd taken, and what it had done to your… well, your cock. And your knot."
Pepper sets her mouth in a scowl. "You would not have. You were a great student when you wanted to be, Tony."
Tony's eyes pop open wide as he falls over the edge, his cock pulsing and his ass clenching as he comes. It spurts between them, splashing up over Tony's chest, over his nipples, and it's gorgeous. He looks sinful, wild and fucked out, and Steve follows him. He feels his knot grow, feels himself swell and pulse, and then his vision whites out and he's coming, pouring himself into Tony's body, coating his insides with his spend.
Steve has softened, his knot gone down so he's slipped out of Tony's body, and he feels empty. His hole is tender, raw, sore from being stretched too much too fast, but Tony doesn't regret it. He'd loved it, the feeling of Steve's huge cock filling him, stretching him and making a place for Steve inside Tony's body. It had felt like a true claiming, like Steve was really taking him, owning him.
