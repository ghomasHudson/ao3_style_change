“I’ve just been busy Sherlock,” he continued, still speaking much louder than Sherlock was. “But you could have texted me! It’s not like I don’t check my phone throughout the day! You could have said you needed to tell me something! You shouldn’t have pretended everything was fine! I don’t understand why you kept quiet!”
“If I may…” John cuts in. “Mycroft, I don’t know you. I’d really rather you not investigate my background.”
“Back to work,” she instructed. Her voice did not shake, John noted with admiration. “We’ll let you know how Winter fares, but for now you can do nothing for her but your duties.”
John stiffened, the cup clattering to the floor. Blood rushed through his ears as, without warning, he was transported back.
Sherlock licked his slightly-swollen lips and cleared his throat. “John, you know I could not have done all this without you. I could not have defeated the
“Wait, where are we going?” John asked. He stood too. “Are we going to talk to Lestrade, or are you going to be stubborn and do your stupid homeless network thing?”
John froze. For an instant, they stared, each finally taking in the words the other had been saying. Sherlock felt his chest heaving again, and the prickle in his eyes had returned, stronger this time.
Gathering the books in his arms—he'll decide which to buy later—he makes his way toward the mystery section, which he'd spotted earlier. He assumes John is set up there, judging from the low babble, which is above the typically accepted decibel levels for bookstores.
“I’m twenty-four years old, John,” he begins, voice earnest. His gaze is trained upon his own, now-empty hands. “You would think by now I’d have had at least one serious romantic relationship, but I haven’t. No one has ever looked at me, talked to me for more than a few minutes, and decided that I am someone they could make a life with, or even give a second look to. I’ve been called many things, but never... boyfriend material.” He speaks the last two words with an odd combination of disdain and wistfulness.
during my first year. One of my professors urged me to try to find an agent, and…” He holds his hands out to the side as if to say
But at the same time, he saw the wisdom of Sherlock’s words. Logical, reasonable words. He needed to tell the Navy he was alive, and perhaps in doing so he could even protect Sherlock and this crew from being punished for piracy if they were ever captured.
Sherlock regarded him flatly for a moment, but then inclined his head with a slight smile. “It’s alright, Victor. We’re both rather like ghosts by now. I myself did not tell Mycroft I was still alive for ages.”
Actually being at  the Yard had presented a whole other set of issues. Firstly, John had been unaware Sherlock wanted to
Sherlock laughs without humour. “Should I settle for your lifestyle then? Hiring someone for sex on Christmas? Playing at being sophisticated but failing every class you take?”
His mood had been that way - a rather angry, roiling mass - ever since finding out about the texts. How could Sherlock have betrayed him like this? How could he have hidden such an important thing from his boyfriend?
How could he not know this? He’d known Sherlock for long enough now, so why did he not know the man’s day of birth? (Granted, he wasn’t sure what day this exactly was, having lost count a few weeks ago, but nevertheless.)
“I know,” Victor sighed. “But you weren’t there, Sherlock. You didn’t see how they reacted when they suspected I wasn’t who I said I was. They threatened to kill me. I had to flee, to disappear.”
Sherlock wiped his face on the sheets between John’s legs and smiled up at him. God, making John come was a joyous thing. “You thought I what, tiger?”
Dread and worry flood Greg’s stomach. Sherlock would never, ever leave his station in such disarray. There's a trail of coffee grinds leading from the counter to the back room, and a torn off barista apron wedged between two chairs. When he steps to the swinging doors, he hears a low moan. Christ, he thinks, cursing himself for hiring the new kid without checking references first.
“Fuck, Sherlock, God, you have the best ideas, the best fucking ideas, but that’s not going to, oh fuck, that’s not going to be enough.”
“Well, if that's as bad as it gets, I'm really not too worried. I put it away to make room for one of our wedding photos.” John turned his head and smiled at Sherlock. His face was flushed and his lips were wet and swollen. His hair was messy from Sherlock's fingers raking through it and he was still breathing a bit heavily.
And then he would be touched. Surely John would expect to have marital relations with his husband, would he not? And surely John was entitled to that? But wasn't Sherlock also entitled to have his privacy respected if he didn’t feel he was ready for that kind of encounter, or if he felt that such intense physical sensations would detract from the things that really mattered? His ability to think and reason and deduce: those were the things that mattered the most. Speaking about this with John sounded about as easy as ice skating on the rings of Saturn.
Sherlock was running out of ideas. He closed his eyes and rested his head on John’s shoulder, and John ran his fingers through his hair, and kissed the top of his head.
Sherlock tells Mycroft about Tui and the seal, about the way Cetus and his apprentices worked miracles to save her, about her slow recovery. Mycroft listens, wide-eyed, with a shocked and furious expression on his pinched face, until he is reassured that she is well, that both she and Anahera are happily ensconced in the heart of Pobeda’s colony.
“We’re done. C’mon. Leaving. Leaving now.” He pulled Sherlock out of the store by his coat sleeve, crowded him up against the shop front’s brick wall, and said, “Well? You can’t just talk to Greg about this little sting operation the two of you have set up, and then not tell me anything.”
When he reaches the place at which he last turned, he stops and looks around. The only way to go is back down, or to the ice cave, their ice cave. Certainly a fall from this height would cause injury, but why would Moringa keep coming back to the cave after taking everything out of it?
A wave of humbleness overtakes Sherlock. That it took him a trek across the Shelf in search of mythological baubles and countless debates within his own head to come to the conclusions that Erebus did so easily, without pause, reminds him of how much he has yet to learn. That, in turn, reminds him that Erebus has not finished telling him about his experience with Anahera. “Can you tell me the rest of the dream?”
John leaned forward and whispered in Sherlock's ear. “Sherlock. I just drove four hours, mostly in the middle of the night, to get here, back to you, as fast as I could. I did not do that because I wanted to tell you that maybe this was all a big mistake.”
Sherlock and John aren't chicks anymore, but they aren't adults, either, and their markings reflect that. They are still black and white, without the orange bits. When I first started writing this, I couldn't find good examples about what juveniles would look like, so I went ahead and gave John his coloured bill. Turns out, I was ahead of myself. That's okay - I'll just invoke my right to artistic freedom.
The bishop began to blither on about love and honour, and then there was something about John’s courage and bravery, and Sherlock thought to himself that yes, John was very brave to marry Sherlock, even if that probably wasn’t what the cleric meant. It was difficult to concentrate on the man’s words when John Watson with his gorgeous little body in his gorgeous little morning suit was standing across from him with that enormous goofy smile on his face while holding his hand and staring at him with those ridiculous blue eyes.
John came in closer and pressed his soft, warm, lips against Sherlock’s and Sherlock’s brain went completely offline almost immediately. He pressed back, just a nudge of his chin at first, and then a tilt, pressing harder against John’s lips. John hummed and opened his mouth just the slightest bit, and Sherlock tried his hardest to block out all other thoughts. Just a bit more. Just a bit more … lips …
Sherlock found the bottle of lube in the bed sheets and slicked himself up again. He tossed it aside and smeared his hands on his thighs.
John laughed, and dug a tissue out of his pocket. Sherlock blew his nose and cleaned himself up, and flipped through the book again. He would need time, a lot of time, to go through it the way he wanted to, photo by photo, memorizing the details of each and every one.
“If I found something unusual, I’d make up a story about it. The story would grow and grow and grow, until one day, three hundred generations from now, my ancestor would tell her hatchling about it, but it wouldn’t be a story anymore. It would be truth.
Sherlock giggles, then John giggles, and then Sherlock slips and lands on his back, and John slips and lands on top of Sherlock.
“It must have been very hard for you. You were a career military man before the accident. Decorated. Strong, capable, a natural leader. Afterward, you’d have had months of recovery followed by months of physical therapy. You considered yourself broken. Unworthy.”
Sherlock wants to refuse, but then has a vision of John, wings on his hips, nodding his head, and gesturing for Sherlock to move forward.
“Interesting,” Sherlock mused. “It would’ve been a magnificent view.” He loved John’s knowledge of the area and the obvious pride he took in his ancestral lands. He made a mental note to pull out some of the books he’d seen on John’s shelves about Scotland’s ancient peoples and customs. John was his people now, and by extension, so were John’s ancestors. He needed to know more.
John rolled his cheeseburger wrappings and napkins into a wad and stuffed them into the empty paper bag, then squeezed the bag into a ball and stood up.
A small smile wobbles on Mycroft’s face. “I believe I have you to thank, Sherlock. I would never have volunteered myself for the position of committee head.”
This is the way it had been for all the ages. Proof of her existence, protection, and love, was personified in her heirs, who boasted a small red mark on their otherwise unblemished chests. These sons and daughters were named in accordance with Kororā's wishes, but otherwise lived among their peers as equals, no more highly revered than any other individual. Their presence served to remind them all to love and be kind, to give freely of themselves, and to value each other.
Back at the table, Greg was stirring more raw sugar into his coffee and folding the empty packet into tiny squares. He waited until they’d taken off their coats and pulled up chairs, then said, “So. Have a good time last night?”
Sherlock takes John to bed and holds him close, touching and kissing him with reverence and adoration. He knows of no one else who ever would have put up with what John has. He knows of no one else who would have taken such care, such patience, with the man that Sherlock was when they first met. John has saved Sherlock's life many times, but the life he is most grateful for is this more emotionally aware one, the one that John nurtured and tended to as if Sherlock had been a rare botanical species, ready to uproot and whither at any time.
Moonlight strayed into the small bedroom and came to rest on the faded quilt, then, when that was pushed to the floor, on Sherlock's long thighs, and John's shoulders, propped between them.
Sherlock watched in fascination as Tiny Bat John rubbed his entire face around the head of his cock, smearing the pre-ejaculate onto his cheeks and nose and forehead. There seemed to be a direct correlation between the mess on his face and the filth of his words.
Sherlock’s breathing stalled and his mouth flooded. Slowly, savoring the anticipation of more skin-on-skin contact, Sherlock ran his hand down John's side to his hip, and pushed him onto his back. He raised himself up on one elbow, swung a leg over, and lowered himself back down, belly-to-belly, chest-to-chest.
Sherlock pushed the door open and moved to step out. He hesitated, then swiveled back, grabbed John by the back of the neck, and pulled them together. He kissed John, hard and fast, got out of the truck, shut the door, and disappeared into the crowd.
Sarah nodded and smiled at Sherlock. He had to admit, it was a genuine enough smile, and she hadn’t done anything to warrant a negative reaction from him. She wasn’t even remotely flirting with John.
“Yes, I do believe I am.” Sherlock climbed onto the bed next to John, gave him a lingering kiss, and settled down onto his elbows and knees. He rested his forehead on intertwined fingers and wiggled his bottom. “How’s this?”
“Can I help you with something, Captain?” John asked through gritted teeth as some of his earlier feelings of anger and betrayal returned.
“As did I,” he breathes, almost soft enough to be lost in the pattering raindrops on the awning above them.
Without warning, Sebastian spat in Sherlock's face. The captain leaned back, an eyebrow lifting. Several of the crew started forward, letting out loud protests, but he held up a restraining hand.
So they chat and grin and taste each other’s food. They finish the bottle of wine with their pasta, then spend nearly an hour lingering over cups of rich coffee and the cannoli John decided to order for them. The moment Sherlock bites into the chocolate cream one is the moment John learns about his boyfriend’s rather voracious sweet tooth. His eyes roll back into his head, and he lets out a groan of contentment. John watches in amusement, then laughs when Sherlock opens his eyes and — seeing John’s eyes on him — blushes scarlet.
He joined them in the kitchen, his two favourite people. Sherlock was already moving about the room, swinging Rosie out of his arms into her chair. She sat agreeably, watching with a rapt expression as Sherlock started preparing Rosie’s oatmeal while simultaneously putting the kettle on and whisking eggs for omelettes. She grinned at John when he pressed a good morning kiss to the top of her head.
Sebastian parried Winter’s blade, thrusting it to the side. But she recovered immediately, whirling around to swing her blade toward him again. They engaged in a series of motions, whirling limbs and slashing blades, so rapid and smooth that John could hardly follow the individual moves as they flowed into one another. However, he quickly realized the advantages on both sides. Sebastian had more strength, but Winter was quick and agile. Her smaller size made her nimble, as she proved when she at last ducked under his swinging blade to thrust hers toward his gut.
As he nears the convention centre, Sherlock hoists his bag higher on his shoulder. He hasn’t had time to get a hotel room, planning to crash with John in his. Perhaps a bold decision, considered John has no idea he’s here, but oh well.
“Judging from the amount,” Stamford said. “It’s probably a ship’s hull, or mast. Either way, some vessel is in trouble out there.”
“Mmm.” Rosie looked satisfied, though far too calm about this groundbreaking development. She dug through her box of crayons, apparently oblivious to John’s pounding heart.
“Thanks,” he mutters, joining Sherlock on the sofa and giving him a slightly crooked, utterly charming smile. “So. What did you want to talk about?”
It was the most short and terse Sherlock had ever seen John behave with Lestrade, and indeed, with himself. He felt a bit baffled; John had been all for going to Scotland Yard and getting Lestrade in the loop so the three of them could stop Sebastian, and now he was leaping upon the first opportunity to get out? Sherlock did not, for the life of him, understand his boyfriend right now.
Sherlock winced and sucked in air with a hiss as he dragged his shirt over the bandage on his shoulder. The cloth caught on the gauze and tugged painfully at the still-tender wound.
“You’re still sore from the battle, though the wounds have mostly healed. The tremor has gone again, finally, as have the effects of that blow to the head. Still. You aren’t completely well yet. I’ve been discussing this with Molly. She says that stab wound you cauterized needs more time to heal. Stretching, pulling, twisting—you should avoid movements like those.”
Sherlock grunted as his cheek made hard contact with the wood, then blinked several times rapidly when he recognized the man to his left.
“Well, what are we going to do about it?” John tried for a joking tone, but it fell flat. “We are in the middle of the ocean. Speaking of which, we should probably venture out onto the deck. Cannot have your crew thinking you’re neglecting your duties.”
“Yeah,” Lestrade looked up and gave him a reassuring smile that was only partially effective. “Listen, this isn’t going to be difficult. I’ve seen cases like this, where the stalker is so intent on just terrorizing their victim that they make stupid mistakes. Overconfidence can be just as helpful as outright stupidity when it comes to solving cases. Though it does help to have the information sooner rather than later. Not saying you’ve done anything wrong,” he added quickly when Sherlock ducked his head again, the shame welling up once more with a vengeance. “I’m just saying people are often too scared to say anything, in case they’re accused of overreacting or making it up.”
Sherlock allowed John to steer him inside and up the stairs, not even thinking to enjoy the touch. He followed automatically as John moved them both to the sofa and then slid close and began rubbing Sherlock’s back.
, which he regards thoughtfully. It’s more dog-eared and well-loved than the others, and out of curiosity he flips to the first folded page.
He set down his drink, mostly finished, and made to join his old crew. He had not walked more than a few steps before there was a hand on his shoulder.
“You’re a pirate, which means you have no honor or sense of morals whatsoever. You only work for yourself with no regard to how your actions affect others. You kill and steal and destroy property without caring that it might ruin many more people’s lives than you’ll ever see. One sailor dead at sea might mean an entire family goes hungry at port. You have no sense of right and wrong, and your selfishness will destroy everything you care about.”
“I thought he told you that you were handsome,” John says, sounding furious that Moriarty had dared notice.
She did, dropping into the last empty seat at their table. “Alright,” she crossed her arms, lips pursed in a half-amused, half-indifferent kind of way. “Let's have it. Which
Victor chuckled, and Sherlock smiled. John was glad to see they had resolved the tension. Then, he cleared his throat. “Shall we discuss… whatever we are here to discuss?” He exchanged a fond look with Sherlock, feeling affection surge up within him. Sherlock could have sat on the bed, but he had elected to sit here, so close to John.
“I, erm… how do you know I’m a writer?” John shoots a glance at Sherlock, whose mouth twists into a painful-looking grimace.
Sherlock makes a low growling sound before pulling his hand from John’s grasp and whirling away. He drags his fingers through his hair. “I apologize,” he says under his breath. “My brother is the most insufferable, pompous arse in the universe. He irks me more than any other human being.” Sherlock is pacing now, aggravation emanating off him like sunbeams — fiery and potentially dangerous. John watches, a bit at a loss.
He didn't yet know how he would blink back tears when Sherlock would graduate university, how his fiance would look horribly bored during the ceremony but would burst into delighted laughter when John would produce a large bouquet of k-cups afterward.
They sip their tea for a while in silence. Then, Sherlock sets down his half-drank cup, lets out a long, slow breath, and launches into speech.
Then, a question came to mind, one he had been agonizing over all night as he had replayed the conversation with Sherlock over and over. “You really aren’t going to kill me?”
Now, even as John had to focus on Moriarty and his vicious sword, he could not help but watch for Sherlock to move. The man had slumped down, body shaking as he tried weakly to force himself to his feet again. And John’s heart twisted in his chest, worry for Sherlock overriding his worry for himself. How could he concentrate on the enemy before him, when his lover was in pain?
“Why not? You’re a skilled writer, and it only makes sense for you to be recognized for it,” Sherlock says, as if it’s a given. Perhaps, to him, it is.
Well, that would do. Sherlock grinned, leapt out of bed, and dressed in a flash. As he was dashing out the door, however, he felt his phone buzz.
John spins on his heel and strides away, Sherlock on his heels. When they’re on the corner, seeking an obliging cab, Sherlock clears his throat.
Despite the consternation in his gut, John snorts. “I appreciate your faith in me. But this is some stiff competition, whatever you may think.”
When they were an estimated two days from Lisbon, the dawning light found John waking with shivers wracking his body. He rolled over, groaning. Sherlock’s head popped up from the pillow next to him.
Then, as if realizing how much he has revealed with those few words, he looks back down at his lap and wrings his hands. John smiles, feeling absurdly fond of this man already.
“I have. The uni’s been great about it. Something about showing they support the arts, or something. Mutually beneficial, though. They get to show they care about more than maths and science, and I get paid for talking to other writers about hypothetical ways to commit crimes.”
Sherlock huffs a laugh, though his head dips self-consciously before he can prevent the movement. “Probably,” he murmurs, then moves further into the store. John chuckles behind him, and the sound is almost enough to compel Sherlock to spin about and stay to just watch John laugh.
She grinned, then pointed above them. John followed her finger to the crow’s nest above them. The red-haired woman, Kate, perched in it, clutching a telescope and watching the horizon.
Quick PSA. This chapter is a little more graphic than the others in terms of violence. I’d still call it PG-13 however, so I’ve left the official rating as it is. I just wanted people to be aware.
Finally. After all these years of researching, intelligence-gathering, and seeking, he had found it. It was
Irene shrugged. “Sherlock will leave him here. Sebastian understands what will happen if he tries to retaliate. So he’ll probably stay here until he can find other work. But Sherlock will spread the word about him to ships we know. Finding work will not be easy for that piece of filth.” She smiled, grimly satisfied.
"You're not a moron," Sherlock rolled his eyes, digging in John's bag for his notes. "Here, I'll quiz you."
Sherlock faltered a little at that. During the past month of frightening texts and burgeoning paranoia, Sherlock had still rarely allowed himself to think that word:
Yes, Mycroft would, without a doubt, consider the idea of his little brother moving in with his boyfriend of only one month to be too much, too soon. And even Sherlock could not entirely ignore the knot of anxiety at the possibility.
“What do you mean…?” John starts to ask. An endearing wrinkle appears in the center of his forehead, and Sherlock watches him read the end again.
“Well, let me remind you, you kissed me first.” John smirked and was rewarded with a light blush bursting to life on Sherlock’s cheeks. They both sobered quickly, though, and John just watched him for a moment. His eyes had flecks of gold in them; John had never been close enough to notice before.
"Sherlock, I've kind of been trying to talk myself into making a big deal sort of declaration for ages. If anyone's being saccharine, it's me." He smiled.
Sherlock blinked, then smiled at him, a look that sent warmth straight through John’s entire soaked body. “I can’t believe it’s you.”
“Oh.” Sherlock blinked as John set down the cloth and alcohol and stepped past him. He stopped and glanced back.
Several minutes passed before either of them was calm enough to speak, but finally they settled down, still wrapped around one another in their warm nest.
A small smile fights its way onto Sherlock’s face, as if he is thinking the same thing, and they regard one another in silence for a few moments. Then, however, footsteps break the spell.
That coaxes a laugh out of Sherlock, eyes sparkling in the dim light. “That would be an honor,” he grins. “But perhaps you could keep me inside?”
Sherlock lifts an eyebrow. He’s painfully aware of the scrutiny of the others around them. A few more people had joined the line after him, and he feels their gaze upon the pair of them like a physical weight. “Am I permitted back there?”
Sherlock, the most fascinating person he has ever met. Sherlock, who seems so unused to attention and interest, but who has the most delightful, unique opinions. Sherlock, whose sharp wit and shy smiles are rapidly becoming two of John’s favorite things.
“Not at all. Now, come on,” Sholto says, “I’ll show you to where John is, but I need to go participate in a panel soon.”
One hand tangled in Sherlock’s soft curls. The other wrapped around his back. He pulled his mouth away from Sherlock’s to latch onto his neck. Sherlock moaned and tilted his head back, giving John better access to that torturously delectable column of skin.
“You’re to rest now, James,” he said sternly. “We’re guests here, so anything Doctor Hooper, Lieutenant Adler, or Captain Holmes say is as an order from me. Is that clear?”
point yet,” he conceded, “but I doubt that if I met you for the first time now, I’d ever accuse you of being a machine, or heartless.”
Lestrade seemed to have realized this as well, for not a moment later his voice rang out, strong and loud over the fighting and the rain.
John scoots closer, and Sherlock shifts so John can settle between his legs. “That’s considerate. Thank you.”
Behind his closed eyelids, John’s face swam before him. That fascinating face, so ordinary at first glance but containing such multitudes. Now, he watched Sherlock with plaintive earnestness.
He sank back to his knees. The blood was soaking half his chest now. His vision blurred—was that the fog condensing on his eyelashes, or was he losing consciousness?—and he felt his heart pounding hard, as if to make up for the blood he was losing. Pain like fire coursed through him.
“Right then,” John murmured to himself, running his thumb over the hilt of his sword. “Sherlock, dearest, you’d better be in one piece when I get to you.”
Sherlock resisted the urge to roll his eyes, and barely kept himself from flinching at the use of what had been—until now—John’s favoured term of endearment for him. “Very well. Shall I let you clap me in irons, then? Or strap me to the mast, perhaps?”
After she caught her breath, she located the correct door. Room 221 in the Baker History building. She glanced down at the syllabus for Watson’s class. Yes, this was the right one. She adjusted the strap of her bag on her shoulder, took a quick breath, then lifted her hand to knock on the closed door before her.
“Oh,” John murmured. He nodded, then dropped a kiss on the top of Sherlock’s head. “Good idea. Be right back, love.”
He nods, chest heaving from exertion. John does a terrible job hiding his interest in the way Sherlock’s sodden shirt now clings to his torso.
“It could be a lot of things,” Greg protested. “There are plenty of other reasons for couples to argue! Their interests being too different, their schedules not lining up, their families not getting along, not wanting to go public… Should I continue? Anyone wanna chip in?”
And without a backward glance, he departed. John huffed. He couldn’t bring himself to regret insulting the pirate, though the quiet side of his conscience couldn’t hide the fact that he almost wanted Sherlock to stay and say more fascinating, frustrating things.
He turns and sighs in relief. James Sholto, looking rather dashing in a smart but not too formal suit, approaches him from a side door. Sherlock smiles; as uncomfortable as their interaction might turn out to be, seeing Sholto means he is one step closer to seeing John.
Sherlock blew out a slow breath. “Whatever it takes. I would rather have him leave me and live than have him stay just to die.”
“I’m fine,” Sherlock says. His voice is still a bit strained, and John finds himself wanting to kiss him, to see if he can snog away the hoarseness. “But see, eating is
Mere moments passed before John saw it was a futile effort. As they ran, the enemy crew redirected fire toward their destination. More blood soaked into the deck.
Straightening up, he shook his head. “No good. It's too hazy, Captain. I can't tell what we're dealing with.”
Sherlock scolded. He twisted around, and started to again move toward the ship. He wrapped his hands around the rope and, groaning, hoisted himself above the water to get better leverage.
John nodded. “You slept, like, eighteen hours or something.” He shot Sherlock a knowing look. “Have you not been sleeping again?”
Sherlock felt the anxiety and worry fall away as he spun on his heels to face John, who was striding toward him. The slope of his shoulders, the set of his mouth, the speed of his walk, all pointed to one conclusion: he was tired, but preoccupied about something too.
“He’s going to jail,” John squeezed his hands, eyes wide with urgency. “He won’t be able to hurt you again.”
A soft noise to his right made him turn his head, and a different sort of chill shot through him. This time, it was the chill of undiluted fear.
“There.” Sherlock nods to a small stand about half a block away. It’s a cheerily lit place, with a short queue of customers waiting to order. “I hope it’s okay, it’s just fish and chips. But I have it on good authority that it is the absolute best in the city.”
Sherlock’s mouth is crammed with a marmalade-covered scone, but when he glances up at John, he smiles. His annoyed demeanor of an instant ago drops away. “She is,” he manages to say around his mouthful. “But don’t tell her I said that.”
“Well, alright, you did one thing wrong,” Lestrade conceded with a note of amusement in his voice now. “You shouldn’t have broken into my computer, but I’ll let it slide just this once. You’re right, it is for a good cause.”
Sherlock nods. “I am. I wasn’t before you came, but as you say, we’ve both been a bit overloaded.” His voice is low, not blaming at all, only resigned.
He rolled a barrel of gunpowder toward the nearest porthole, which he had tugged ajar. A steady stream of water cascaded down, wetting the powder below. Once it was more like mud than dust, Sherlock moved to another barrel. Time to move quickly, he reflected with a glance out of the porthole. The sun was still below the horizon, but the sky was beginning to grow lighter.
Molly tried not to visibly vibrate with excitement, nor to stare too obviously, for the duration of the lab. She completed the assay, one of the first to do so, and scrawled the last notes and conclusion in her notebook before clearing up. Holmes accepted the proffered lab report with a nod and went back to assisting a confused looking boy. He did not appear to notice anything odd in her behaviour, fortunately.
“I can’t confirm the reports,” Stamford continued. “But from the looks of it, there was at least one ship ‘round these parts last night.”
By the time Molly located the pipettes, the other students, only about a dozen in number, were filing in and setting out their belongings on the black lab tables. Molly handed Holmes the box and moved to sit next to her lab partner, a girl she'd probably only exchanged twenty words with the entire term thus far. She usually spent most of the lab texting under the table, leaving Molly to do the work, only chipping in on occasion.
A crease appears in John’s forehead. “We don’t have to, if you don’t want to. I also said we can take our time.”
Sherlock softened. He felt as though his heart, which had been so bruised and battered and stressed lately, was relaxing, bandaging itself with every word he and John exchanged.
Again, he gazed up at the mast and sails and lines of his ship. Whether he had meddled or not, Mycroft would be a valuable ally. And staring at his new home, and at the ocean beyond, John felt he would need all the hope he could get.
again. He's rereading Sacker and Sherrinford’s reunion scene when yet another intrusive thought about John occurs to him, and he is sent scrambling for his phone yet again.
But intensify it did. Less than a quarter hour later, John was struggling to discern anything beyond a cable length in front of the ship. He shuddered from the cold, which felt as though it were seeping into his bones by now.
“Perhaps it would be easier if I were a heartless machine,” he said, voice quiet and flatter than before. His gaze fixed on John, who felt the atmosphere shift around them, as if the very fabric of the universe were enveloping them. As if the world were pulling away until nothing remained save Sherlock, looking at John, looking at Sherlock.
“Winter,” he breathed. His harsh expression melted in an instant as he crossed the deck in three strides and dropped to his knees beside the girl. His hand found hers and held it to his lips. “Winter, it’s alright. Breathe.”
An hour later, John strides down the corridor, toward his usual classroom. He can already hear his writing kids—he still feels odd calling them students—chattering away inside the room. After a full term and then some together, these writers have become quite close. All of them are rather serious about developing and preparing their manuscripts for possible publication, and he has delighted in watching their skills in prose, plot, and personalities develop over time.
, he thought. Perhaps it was better that no one else knew about Sherlock. Not only would it be dangerous for the captain, but a part of John wanted to keep Sherlock to himself. A secret, carried in John’s heart, unseen by everyone else. Because no one in England—no one in the world, really—could possibly appreciate the way Sherlock Holmes had made John feel. He had brought John alive again in a way no other person ever had, had shown him wonders in the way he saw the world, from the way he reacted to life. No, no one could understand. And no one else should.
lurched to the side. Cries sounded, the NOTP sailors commanding and exclaiming and some simply screaming. John heard a crash, but did not take his eyes off his opponent to look.
John tilts his head, frowning. “I told you, it’s kind of my fault the old one broke. Besides, buying it was my pleasure.”
“Alright,” John mutters under his breath, squeezing Sherlock’s hand hard. “Well, thank you for stopping by, Mycroft. It was…” He was going to say
He ducked down below the railing to reload and stared about. His men were doing their best, many having found cover from which to shoot. Others had apparently made it below, for their own guns were firing cannonballs at the enemy. But several men lay sprawled on the deck, motionless. The water tinged red around their bodies.
Finally, as Irene’s sword swung around toward his chest, his hand spasmed without warning. His own weapon went sideways, just glancing off hers. And her sword slipped through his reach and came to rest, tip sharp even through his clothes, over his heart.
“It’s for their own safety as much as our anonymity,” John muttered with a sigh. “Will you be departing with them?”
“I know,” Molly said. “I just think it bloomed out of some silly off-hand joke one of us made first year and got out of control. But it would also be so cute and romantic if we're right, wouldn't it?”
There’s a longer pause this time, then, in a quiet voice John has to strain to hear through the door, Sherlock says, “We’ll talk later, alright?”
“Right, well, whatever you say,” Sholto says, skepticism dripping from his voice. “It’ll be ‘John H. Watson, Best-Selling Ellipsis Award Winner’ on all the book jackets from now on.”
’s decks soon alerted him; he risked a glance back to find the crew retreating, some surrendering. The pirates were returning, loot in their arms. John cursed. Their side was failing, badly.
Sherlock manages a smile, and John relaxes. He may not have solved Sherlock’s problems, but he doesn’t have to. He made him smile; that’s enough for now.
After a moment, John gets his amusement under control and continues signing the books, making sure his usual message of “happy reading, [name]! ~ John Watson” is especially neat, and that Sherlock’s name is spelled right. The effort is worth it; Sherlock is definitely his favorite fan he’s met today, probably in months or perhaps years.
He loathed the hypocrisy of his own words. Sherlock had been a captain, after all. John supposed he could argue with himself that he had not truly been a crew member under Sherlock, but what would be the point? Saying this to James stung no matter how John tried to rationalize it.
Irene grinned, all teeth. “Excellent. I think I’ll go next,” she declared, to raucous cheers. “And I think I’d like to spar…” She turned her gaze onto each pirate in turn, before stopping her sweep at John. “The sailor boy.”
“Goodnight, Sherlock.” He rolled over and closed his eyes. A beat, then Sherlock’s footsteps retreated in defeat.
“Okay. No bridge club. Here we go. She says, ‘I had Dorothy over for lunch yesterday, nothing fancy, just a quiche Lorraine I'd whipped up’ blah blah blah, apple tart, blah blah, ‘and when we finished I showed her some of the changes I've been making around the house.’
“God, no. We could drive down on the twenty-sixth, and stay until, I don’t know, maybe the tenth? That’s two weeks. That’s a long time.”
. “Want to make you feel good, Sherlock,” John whispers, and Sherlock shakes his head, his curls tickling John’s chest and abdomen as he slides down low, kissing with those peach-sweet lips as he goes. He bites John’s hipbone and it’s like pressing a secret button—John’s legs spread wide and bend at the knees.
John aligned himself behind Sherlock again, pressed his forehead to the back of Sherlock's neck, and rested his hands on his waist. Sherlock opened his eyes.
“I want companionship and affection, mostly. I think I have a lot to offer someone, if they’ll have me. I’m not a bad bloke, you know. I had planned on being in the Army for, well, for a lot longer than I was. And I had planned on being a surgeon as well, but things have changed. If I’m going to lead a civilian life, I’d like to make the most of it. I’d like to do it with a partner. I’d like to figure out the best way for me to go back into medicine. You know that my parents are gone and that they left me the estate. It’s nothing compared to your family home, but I’d love to be able to fix it up and have it as a second home for me and my spouse should I ever have one.”
John shudders in spite of himself. Sherlock smiles into the faded fabric of the t-shirt, inhales his own scent mixed with John's.
“That's too bad. I saw everything here. I saw the calling, and the pairing off, and the mating, too.”
“He is here, in the huddle, resting. The mating was quite exhausting for him. Not so much for me; I really didn’t have to do much at all.”
They had a good view of the back of the manor from where they stood, surrounded by cowslip, primrose, and wisteria in the walled garden, so Sherlock pointed things out to avoid having a proper conversation. “That’s the guest house, and the stables are over there, and Daddy had a pool and tennis court added in ‘97, those are that way, and my laboratory is in an old greenhouse that way, and—”
Sherlock shrugged, then shook his head. “No. It didn’t happen then for a reason, and I choose to believe that it happened the way it did because that’s the way it had to happen.”
“I'll think about it,” Sherlock answered, his voice breaking halfway through the sentence. He doubled down on his efforts to read the article about the Georgian Gothic house, but read the same sentence twelve times after John's hand came to rest directly on Sherlock's chest. Sherlock was used to feeling scrambled by physical touch, not frozen. They stayed like that, John's thumb rubbing small arcs on Sherlock's skin, Sherlock staring at the jumble of letters on the page.
John shuffles, head down, belly almost touching the emperor in front of him, back almost touching the emperor behind him. Next to him, never far from his side, Maryle moves, too. When they reach the next place to settle, he shuffles back just far enough for her to move in front of him, and he rests his wings on either side of her body, with his head bowed against her neck, protecting her from the blitz of stinging ice and whipping winds.
“Well, then, what are you two standing there for? We have work to do. We have a heartstone to find.”
“I haven't slept lying down since I was a hatchling,” Anahera says, and Tui nods her head in agreement.
They sat across from her and let her prepare their tea, continuing to sit in silence while she stacked the toast and pushed it across the table with a plate of butter and the jar of preserves. She picked up where she’d left off with the saucepan, eyeing Sherlock as if to dare him to insult her sister by not trying the strawberries.
Outside, a boom of thunder rolled overhead and rain began to splatter the windowpanes. He closed the door behind him and retraced his steps. James was where Sherlock had left him, although he seemed close to finishing the last pages of the newspaper. He looked up when Sherlock stepped outside and when he saw the green folders in Sherlock’s hand he put the paper down and gave Sherlock a small smile. Sherlock handed them over without a word and reclaimed his chair. He leaned forward, elbows on his knees, and steepled his fingers under his chin. James set the folders in his lap and waited for Sherlock to speak.
rattle around in his head for a few seconds. He noticed that John's lips were very pink this morning, not unlike the color of his nipples.
When finally in the company of their mate, the new couple mimics each other. One stands tall and cranes their head and neck skyward, then the other matches the pose. They stand that way for a long time; Sherlock counts one hundred heartbeats before most lower their heads. When they have shown each other how well they match, they entwine their necks, exchange hugs, and take their place in the parade.
“Even back then, Sherlock, I knew you were special, that I wanted to be near you. I looked up to you like crazy. Thought about you all the time. Even then.”
“How many houses have you made her show you?” Sherlock asked, hands clasped behind his back, taking in the overrun garden and crumbling cottage in front of them.
“What? No! Sherlock, we are not taking six pounds of hairy mold back to the hotel. Jesus. What the hell?”
“Yeah, we’re in Winnetka. Next up is Kenilworth, then Wilmette, then Evanston. Are they all like this?”
Once Daniel Cotter contacted James, which he did in record time and with great enthusiasm, James established a day for their first date and recommended a hotel for his stay, then relayed that information back to Sherlock. Sherlock and John spent an afternoon surveying the hotel, taking note of all entrances and exits, lines of sight, and staffing schedules, but John drew the line when Sherlock announced his plan over breakfast to break into Daniel’s hotel room to gather as much information as possible.
By the morning of the third day he is ready to put a theory to the test, but he cannot do it alone. He lets himself miss John for as long as it takes to scan the pack and find a familiar face. He thinks about how John acts with his other
The energy between them ratcheted up even more as the tour progressed. Standing side by side while the guide discussed the role of the Stone of Destiny in crowning Scottish kings, John wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s back and slid his hand down until he could cup one side of Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock responded by sliding his own hand down from where it rested on John’s shoulder until it was low on John’s hip, his fingers dipping into the waistband of John's jeans. Lingering behind the rest of the tour group, John grabbed Sherlock’s wrist and held him back.
"Yes. But the most extraordinary person ever was also a complete berk and said moronic things about being married to his work, and caring being a disadvantage, and complete rot like that."
“Right. But what if we made a deal that instead of paying me for the acres he put that money toward your tuition? He would get the acres, I don’t need the money, and you’d get your tuition for the University of Chicago. He’d have to take out a loan to buy any significant acreage anyway, so he’d have the money, he’d just be paying tuition instead of me.”
John arches up off the bed, still sucking on Sherlock’s finger like his life depends on it, and he looks down at Sherlock, and Sherlock looks back up at John from his vantage point over ground zero, and he fucking winks. Sherlock winks, and the base of John’s cock contracts, over and over again, and the pent up pressure in John’s perineum explodes as ejaculate comes bursting up and out, and into Sherlock’s mouth.
The drive home started innocently enough. John was taking them home on the back roads, one hand on the steering wheel, the other on Sherlock’s knee. Sherlock had scooted a bit closer, in part because he needed to fulfill his role as radio button fiddler, in part because he was cold, but mostly because it was paramount that he be as close to John as possible.
“That reminds me, what’d Bea say to you this morning? Did she write you up or…?” John asked, jerking his chin over Molly’s shoulder towards where their boss, Beatrice, stood, trying to talk a customer into trying a Turkish coffee. Molly had been late again that morning. John had stood outside the shop at 5am for thirty minutes, collecting a small gathering of annoyed customers as it drew closer and closer to their scheduled opening, before she arrived, flustered and embarrassed, to use her supervisor keys to open the store. John regretted asking the question immediately as Molly’s eyes welled. She shook her head, blinking quickly to dispel the tears.
“Are you sure?” John didn’t look upset or annoyed. He looked a little amused, maybe, and was still staring somewhat deliriously at Sherlock’s mouth.
Shirt undone, he reached for the top button of John’s jeans, and then the next, and the next. John was breathing hard, and leaning back against Sherlock’s chest.
Truffles, from the overpriced chocolate shop in town, Sherlock thought, but only a few as to not be pretentious. Again, John's mom would be impressed. Too bad she didn’t bring a bottle of wine, then someone could’ve made the case that she was a floozy.
"Mm. Bonobos do it, too." John winked, grabbed the sheet, and trailed it behind him as he sauntered into Sherlock's bedroom.
“Would you be okay with us starting like this?” he asked as he snapped open the lid. “With me on top?”
They said their last goodbyes and turned to go in separate directions. John looped his arm through Sherlock’s as they started walking west on Diversey. “Great guy,” he said. “I’m glad we met him.”
Sherlock bit down on the corner of his mouth and smiled to himself. John was fabulous. John was amazing and smart and sexy and he was taking Sherlock somewhere secret for his birthday and tonight he was going to give Sherlock something very special indeed and this day could only be perfect, no matter what happened. Perfect.
“I hope you don’t mind that I asked John to be here today, Sherlock. I wasn’t sure if you’d even be willing to see me.”
Mrs. Hudson rapped on the office door, and he lifted his head to see that it had gone dark. He hummed entry over the pencil eraser pressed to his lower lip, and she carried in a tray of chicken and dumplings, a mug of black coffee, and a slab of cobbler. He snapped a cloth napkin down over his lap, and she took a seat across the desk from him.
At first, he thinks they didn't even last the thirty minutes, because there's no one at the espresso machine. In fact, there's no one behind the counter. He makes his way through the front of the shop, coming to a halt when he sees what appears to be the results of a physical altercation.
Thank you for being so patient with me while I've not been able to post. I won't have a schedule from this point forward because I really don't know how the writing will go. I apologize for that, but hope the not knowing will make the eventual email notifications feel like little surprises. :)
“You have a point. How did you even do that? How did you not really do anything, and get me to come that hard?”
“He’s already left me several messages. He wants your full names, phone numbers, ages, etc. He intends to press charges.”
Sherlock opened the photo album and read the inscription on the cover page. John had written it very carefully, taking care to be neat, to not make mistakes.
Ten minutes later they were headed down the plowed road, away from both their houses. Sherlock tugged the sleeves of his coat further down over his gloves, and pulled his scarf in a tight loop around his neck and chin. John tugged his hat down over his ears, and tucked his hands into his pockets.
“It's – it's so hot, the perfect temperature. Should I bob it in and out, like that? Oh, John, that's – oh, your technique – it's so good!”
“The girl in the Packers shirt, sitting at your nine o’clock, just broke up with her boyfriend. See? Tear tracks, indentation where her promise ring was, and her phone hasn't stopped chiming since she sat down.”
Sherlock stands next to John and taps out a clue with one foot until John stops muttering and turns to Sherlock.
“I do not take on ‘little bets,’ John. This endeavor, like any I choose to pursue, is based on the principles of science and is worthy of my undivided attention. I will win, and you will give me whatever I ask for.”
“They’re not all tourable,” Jessica said. “They’re mostly private residences, except for his own house and studio, I think. You’d just be biking around looking at them and hearing stories from the tour guide about what an amazingly talented jerk he was.”
Some time later Sherlock realised the space around him had gone quiet. He placed his ear to the door but couldn’t hear anything. John appeared to have left the room. Sherlock eased open the bathroom door and peered around its edge. The room was, indeed, empty. He went to the armoire and stripped off the robe and g-string. He threw the scrap of silk into the back corner of the upper shelf, pulled out his long pants and the long-sleeved shirt and got dressed again. He put the robe back on and tied it around his waist, tight. He was protected now, covered, untouchable. Sherlock wouldn’t have to say a word to communicate the change of plans to John. His decision was a visible pronouncement made clear in layers of white silk.
,” Irene said. “From what you two told us, Watson’s hardcore icing him out. You don’t do that for something like uncooperative schedules.”
“Hey,” John laughs. “Don’t be upset your friend cares about you. She looked so excited when she realized we’re here together.”
Rather giddy with how good a day it’s been, John drags an enthralled Sherlock away from one of the bookshelves, then watches in amusement as his soon-to-be date buys another three books, which he shoves into his bag along with his newly signed Watson collected works.
“I don’t need the money, thanks.” John clenches his fists, mirroring Sherlock from earlier. “I’m perfectly comfortable financially as is. And I am certainly not comfortable helping you spy on my boyfriend, who obviously doesn’t want or need your help with anything.”
“What, that there could be an entire town run by women in the 1600s?” Kitty snaps. “Unrealistic to you, maybe. Have you ever had a girlfriend who could be described as anything other than imaginary?”
Ducking between combatants, he scoured the deck. A fallen sword, long and slim of blade, lay a few feet away, and he launched himself at it. Seizing it, he turned. Lestrade was still fighting, but John knew the man well enough by now to see by his movements that he was tiring and in pain.
“I think the poultice made things worse,” he bit his lip. Sherlock approached, concern flashing across his face. “You must be sensitive to it. That… That happened once before…”
No. None of that right now. Memories of Sherlock were reserved for quiet moments, alone in the middle of the night after a nightmare. Not now. He sighed heavily and stood up. Enough work and worrying. Time for something more enjoyable.
Sherlock is so close now, almost there, but the skua rights herself on the ice, shaking her head, unbalanced, and limps toward the chicks. There’s another
“Yeah, I thought you wouldn't want to do it, so I didn't ask. I didn't want to make you uncomfortable.” John pushed Sherlock's Levi’s down to his knees, and Sherlock pushed them down from there. John was already taking his own jeans and underwear off by the time Sherlock had kicked his aside. John sighed when his erection popped free of their cotton constraint, then he reached for Sherlock's underwear.
“No, it’s not really on my agenda, either,” Sherlock answered, moving the app’s map to a different neighborhood. “It’s kind of early to eat, but we could head up to Andersonville and walk around a bit, then grab some food, and head back to the hotel until later tonight.”
Sherlock watched a trail of bubbles slide in a slow line down the curve of John’s bicep. “What did you just say?”
, he comes to understand, is another like him. Of course, he realizes: he is begotten. This is his father, who grooms him now, bending low, tucking a slick black head under his scrawny wing to right him, prop him, test him. He must move a bit now, he must learn to hold himself, because unmoving is unsafe. It is too cold to go far, so he stays tucked under his father, and he watches.
Thirty minutes later they were kissing Mrs Hudson goodbye and promising to text when they got there.
Sherlock opened his eyes and looked down. John looked fierce between his legs, looked deadly serious, seriously deadly. They locked eyes, and then John licked one, thick, wet stripe up Sherlock's delirious cock, titled his head down, opened his mouth, and swallowed it.
And so with heads turned down and collars turned up against the light drizzle, they made their way down an alley, striding through an almost deserted midnight circus, and into the tiny, candlelit space with Angelo’s scrawled across the awning.
“And how I’d wait for you after home games, wait for you to come out of the locker room, even if it took a while?”
“He might not be a secret agent, but yeah, this confirms what I thought. He does something for the CIA. Well, maybe the FBI. I’m not sure. I mean, look at this card. A phone number. Really? Who puts just a phone number on a card? They aren’t trying to save money, this is high-quality linen stock. Embossed. Plus, it’s a 202 area code.”
They stood silent then, watching the woman on the floor, listening to the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs and down the hall. Annette’s cousin and another uniformed officer walked through the open door and into the flat. “Well, I’ll be,” Olivia said. “Annette, what the hell are you doing here?”
“I find myself of a most curious nature this morning, young Sherlock. Thank you for asking. And how are all of you? You certainly are awake at a crisp and vibrant time of day, aren’t you?”
Angelo’s was dimly lit with twinkling fairy lights strung up behind the bar and above the fireplace, bubbled glass pendants hanging at varying heights in the front window, and candles on each of the tables. The restaurant was mostly empty of diners that late at night, and Sherlock observed that the few tables that were occupied were taken by giddy, smitten couples, spontaneous types who hadn’t wanted the night to end. People like him, Sherlock thought, desperate to prolong contact.
The doorbell rang in the middle of a dream Sherlock was having about a dominatrix and a plane full of dead people. His brain incorporated the sound into the dream, signalling that the plane’s intercom system had been activated. The second time it rang he woke up and thought Mrs Hudson was ignoring the door. The third time it rang he remembered that he wasn’t at 221b, and wondered if anyone was going to answer it. The fourth time it rang he got out of bed, wrapped his sheet around his naked body, and went to open it himself.
“No, not at all. It’s just a bit arousing, is all, listening to you talk about the things you’d like to try.”
Back at the colony, Sherlock leads Mycroft within a short distance of the crèche. They stop, and Mycroft takes in the site of hundreds of adolescent emperors packed together, a hodgepodge of ruffled feathers and renegade fluff, bills tucked down low under wings. An occasional hiccup or snort or squeak escapes their slumber.
When he lifts his head to kiss John’s face again, John lowers his head and nips at Sherlock’s neck. A tremor shoots down Sherlock’s body, momentarily stilling him.
When we last left off, our peng-heroes were making Mycroft's life difficult, and the council was about to start accepting questions on the life stages of their kind. Turns out, Sherlock has a question, and he doesn't like the answer.
“I’m never going to understand your obsession with me in desperate need of a shower, but I’m never going to complain about it, either.”
“Yes, yes, I hear you, I do, John, but please, for now, let’s not say anything to the others. At least for tonight, not until we figure out how we want to proceed. Let’s know what
Anahera’s light is almost completely gone now, and Sherlock has the sudden urge to step forward and touch that shine before it altogether disappears. He cannot move, though. His feet are so heavy, his legs are like pillars of ice. He looks down to see what holds him, but encounters only his own belly. He looks up again, and she is gone.
“Very funny. And yeah, but all four of their opinions don't count as much as those of that priest she’s been talking to.”
It was John's turn to blush. He'd gotten carried away. What was he even nattering on about? Christ, this boy made him chatty. Here he was going on about tea and coffee as if it was, God know's what, and Sherlock had come up with some sophisticated, nuanced perception that was much more succinct and interesting than John's own description. “Go on then,” John said, slightly self-conscious, finishing the drink off with a sprinkle of sea salt on top of the toffee pieces. He capped the cup and passed it over. Sherlock raised it to his lips and took a sip, his eyes sliding closed in bliss as the decadent white chocolate toffee taste spread itself over his tongue. A deep, satisfied groan escaped Sherlock, seemingly involuntarily, rumbling deep in his chest and throat. It did things to John, that rock-rough sound, so explicitly sensual and uninhibited. John allowed his gaze to linger on him, touching where his fingers itched to draw: over those razor edge cheekbones and across the plush pink bow of his lips, trailing down the curve of his throat and dipping down into those soft inky curls that just begged to be mussed.
“I don’t know much about her, to be honest.” John filled an espresso cup with whip cream and drizzled fudge sauce on it. Grabbing a spoon, he pulled himself up onto the counter beside Sherlock. The space was tight so they were pressed together all along one side, snugged close. “She’s got two sons, both grown. I think one runs a dry cleaners? The other’s a cook of some sort. At a chippy. She doesn’t seem to like them much. She’s always complaining about them being worthless gobshites.”
John stepped as close as he could without touching Sherlock, and stared at the pouty lower lip just in front of him. He tilted his head up and whispered, “I like the moon, too, Sherlock. I have a favorite memory of the moon. Wanna hear it?”
Sherlock licked, and he sucked, and John babbled mindlessly as if he were seeing all Heaven’s treasures for the first time. Sherlock slid his finger higher, searching as he went. He knew he’d found John’s prostate, both from the feel of it, and the loud, happy,
Sherlock took a deep breath, sighed, and pushed away thoughts of the other shoe dropping. The other shoe needn’t drop. Or, if it did, maybe the other shoe could turn out to be a soft soled slipper, something that would land on plush carpet, not making one whit of noise, causing no disturbance.
At the bottom of the duffel bag was a box wrapped in silver wrapping paper and a wide, red ribbon. John had written directly on the paper, “Merry Christmas. I love you. John.” Sherlock left it in the bag, then put that in the closet, too.
“We are, are we? Don't tell your mama we gave you ice cream for lunch. She'll be mad because we never let her have ice cream for lunch.” He sets the jar of flowers down on the table, turning it this way and that, and then wipes his hands down the front of his jeans.
“Don’t listen to her, Sherlock. She stalked me for weeks. And I already knew who she was. I mean, look at her, it was impossible to not see her. Finally, one day, I just turned around and said, ‘Anahera, you seem to be following me. May I help you with something?’ and she said, ‘Yes, I think you probably can. It seems I have fallen in love with you.’”
Sherlock took a step back and reached for John’s hands as they slipped off his hips. “Might not want to kiss you? I find that highly improbable. What is it?”
He stopped when he entered the room, and stared. John had tossed two ancient afghans down on the floor, and some cushions from the couch, and was poking at the fire with a piece of kindling wood. He tossed it on top of the burning logs, and rubbed his hands together in front of him. The firelight moved in orange and yellow waves over his skin, and the tips of his eyelashes, and over the strands of his hair. He was even more golden than usual, and God, but he was beautiful.
– ICVOC, a newly registered not-for-profit organization created to aid families who have been victimized by organized crime, will open in June of next year. The organization will offer individual and group counseling; art, writing, and equine therapy; PTSD recovery programs; vocational training; and short-term safe housing to those who have suffered trauma and loss through organized crime.
“I'm sure she'll make someone very happy,” John answered, squeezing toothpaste onto the spare brush he'd brought over. “But not me.”
Tui takes Sherlock’s wing between her own and holds on tight, pressing herself to his side, as if he might float into the sky at any moment. He can feel her trembling. He thinks her very brave. He closes his eyes. He steps inside his ice palace.
“And I thought I was the idiot. As if you could kill the mood by demanding respect and declaring our relationship off limits to outside speculation. Not to mention I'm a red-blooded twenty-year-old male and you're the finest piece of ass I've ever seen.”
“Our own farm has done quite well over the years. We’ve had our ups and downs, but we’ve always been able to meet payday and put a good meal on the table. I haven’t played around with the stock market to the extent Mycroft has, and my gains there have been modest, but like I said, we’re doing okay.
“I hereby dismiss this session of the Emperor Intercolonial High Council. Sherlock, you are free to go, although I speak for all twelve of us when I say that I sincerely hope we may meet each other again. I wish you godsspeed on your journey, and every blessing in finding that which you seek.
It is not until Sherlock speaks with Mycroft privately that he understands the timing of his brother’s decision.
Sherlock takes the bottle from his hand and leans in for another kiss, and John tugs his shiny lower lip between his, sucking it gently before releasing him. Sherlock feels himself running hot, melting, and he presses himself up against John, revelling in his approval. John grins into his mouth and pulls away, twirls his index finger in the air and nudges Sherlock back. Sherlock turns and walks to the kitchen, his hips and buttocks swaying as he goes, and he knows that John's eyes are glued to his ribbon-tied arse until he turns the corner into the kitchen and is out of sight.
“Boys drive into ravine, driver trapped with jeans around his ankles, tonight at 11,” Sherlock quipped in a deep, newscaster’s voice.
Sherlock opened his mouth, closed it, opened it again. He swallowed, licked his lips, took a breath.
His tone, his expression, and something about the gentle sparkle in his eyes—all that evokes an odd feeling in Sherlock. He feels as if he has been transported back to a time well before uni, in a smaller classroom with a much less well-stocked chemistry lab, burning cobalt oxide and aluminium oxide, and watching, enchanted, at the seemingly miraculous result. This sensation returns to him now, the delight of new, unknown territory, and it encourages him. He begins to speak, with gestures and gesticulations, all about the book. Sherrinford’s return, Sacker’s quiet fury at the fact he has been lied to for three years, and the case that forces the two men back together at last.
John laughed as he leaped to his feet and offered the other man a hand. Sholto took it, the scar tissue on his left hand rough and ropy to the touch.
John cannot resist turning his head a bit, just enough to bring their mouths together in a gentle kiss. Sherlock returns the kiss immediately, and something in it tastes of relief. John, spurred on by this observation, pours all his affection into their contact; Sherlock should never have to doubt him, and if John has anything to say about it, no one — not even people like James Sholto — will make Sherlock feel unsure again.
And that is strange to him. Usually he cannot stop himself from saying things, even things better left unsaid. Plenty of people at university revile him for this, and he has developed a reputation for being rude, even cruel on occasion. So why, when what he could say might be truly important, can he not find the words?
“During the years after my father’s death, while I still in school, I met Victor. He was an orphan, adopted by a friend of my father’s. But that guardian died soon after my father did, and we were brought together by similar griefs. We became close, and I told him my story. He was a passionate person, and declared we would get revenge.”
He could hardly believe it. Even three years ago, Sherlock had been searching for Victor for years. How had John found him, here and now?
When the admiralty had informed him that they were making him a captain, he had not quite comprehended it. Now, standing on the deck of the newly-christened vessel, the potent realization washed over him like a wave.
“Nothing, never mind,” Sherlock says. He shifts the conversation back to Sherrinford, and the logistics of how he survived that waterfall. John allows the change, but seems to be watching Sherlock with a more thoughtful expression now.
John pressed his fingers to Sherlock’s wrist and breathed a sigh of relief when he felt the pulse beneath the skin. “Heartbeat is strong,” he reported.
“Because I’m an idiot, apparently.” He lays his head on the table. “And a predictable, unoriginal, boring writer.”
John laughs. Sherlock’s apparent tunnel vision in regards to his chemistry tests reminds John of his own tendency to withdraw into a zone where he sees nothing but the document in front of him. “Well,” he looks around the kitchen. “Maybe we should skip kettles entirely, yeah?”
“Hi,” Sherlock said, suddenly breathless. Maybe he was here to make up, as Sherlock so wanted to do.
John snickers, his countenance declaring, somehow, that listening to Sherlock is the most interesting, splendid thing he has done in a long time. As if Sherlock’s opinions are the most stimulating opinions in the world. “So you don’t mind if I, oh I don’t know, end sentences with a preposition?” He is beaming. “Or split my infinitives? Or ignore parallel structure?”
“She sounds lovely,” John says. He already likes this woman, for if not for her he may never have met Sherlock.
His entire demeanor had shifted again, Sherlock noticed. The moment they had moved away from the weapons and the secluded space where he had cornered Sherlock, Moriarty had changed. Now, he was impish, playful, yet almost formal in his speech. More violent than intimate, almost performative in his threatening tone. As if he wished to downplay their previous connection.
Sherlock seems to have read this scene many times, judging from the way the book seems to fall open to that page of its own free will. James’ name is even underlined the first time it appears.
“Erm, yes. The internet had many interesting ideas about apologizing to one's lover after a fight. These were the less absurd options. Besides, I... I wasn't sure my presence alone would be persuasive enough. Hence, flowers.”
John nods. “I have to agree. Obviously, if you aren’t comfortable, you don’t have to submit any work to them. There are other ways to get your writing out into the world. This sounds like it might be a company that would require you to pay them to be published, and that isn’t how it usually works.”
“Mmm.” Sherlock tugged at the blanket so it more securely rested under his chin. “When did you get in?”
Sherlock feels he has divested a weight from his chest and only now can experience what living, breathing, existing is. The words are out, and he cannot take them back, and he is so alive.
John stepped forward. “We can't worry about that now. Captain, there's clouds up ahead, and if that turns into a storm, I want us to be prepared to weather it.”
“Oh,” Sherlock gasped. His arms wrapped around the back of John’s neck, so he could not retreat even if he had desired to.
When John had realized through the telescope that Sherlock was being keelhauled—the rope stretching into the ocean off the stern had revealed the terrible truth—he had nearly fallen over with fear. What a barbaric punishment. There had been no question in John’s mind that it was Sherlock at the end of that rope, Sherlock who was likely terrified if he was even conscious, Sherlock who was drowning and bleeding and dying.
After a few minutes of companionable silence, John swallows a bite and opens his mouth to speak—to ask Sherlock about his life, his hopes and dreams and ambitions and how the hell his hair always looks so tempting and beautiful—when a voice interrupts him.
“Oh, I don’t know,” he paused at the door and gave Sherlock a mirthless, cold smile. “I don’t really think I need to tell you, do I?”
Seven hours later, Sherlock flopped into a cab, feeling exhilarated and lighter than he had in weeks. The case had been, by his estimation, an eight. A disappearance from a room that had been locked from the outside, a complex scheme of extortion, and a quick chase through a maze of alleys later, and Sherlock had both caught the criminal, thwarted the murder of the kidnapped man, and actually gotten a clap on the back from Lestrade.
But that was impossible. Disbelief thrummed through him. He whirled, hoping, desperate, terrified to be right but more terrified to be wrong. When he called out, his voice rose above the others who murmured around him.
Sherlock chuckles softly as he puts a gentle hand on John’s. “John, everyone has their own biases and histories when they read a novel. Or do anything I suppose. Everyone’s personal experiences inform each decision in their life. So do not let a few negative reviews of your book discourage you. Nothing, not even novels by the most lauded and distinguished writers are universally adored.”
Sherlock scowled. “Because as you said to your own men, you are a guest here. Thus, you are beholden to me. Let us speak, Captain, alone.”
Their journey upstairs is giggly and full of fond caresses and quick kisses. John, were he not dazed from strong wine and delicious food and heady snogs, might have looked around at his surroundings. However, he
Sherlock did not reply, so Moriarty stepped closer. His fingers lifted to clutch Sherlock’s jaw. And Sherlock, held so tightly, could not flinch away.
He pulled his hand back, noticing how Sherlock leaned forward slightly as if to follow the touch. “I thought you were dead,” he spat again.
Sherlock’s head ducks a little, an utterly endearing expression on his face. A combination of shy and amused. “I do, only… Digestion slows me down.”
John advanced on Sherlock, curious, as the unknown man—whom Winter had identified as Ekene—gestured to him with an intricate series of hand movements. Unable to resist, John approached. The two did not appear to notice him, wrapped up as they were in their discussion.
“What do you plan to do with me, pirate?” John asked. He didn’t want to bother with meaningless pleasantries. Not with this man.
“Because I would not want to forget... who I am now,” Sherlock said. “I feel that I... I am different, perhaps even better, and I would not change that. And I cannot bring myself to regret certain things... certain things
Sherlock, seeming reassured by John’s ready acceptance, appears to fight a smile, his mouth twisting in a funny little curve. “I’d like that. When are you free?”
He turns to John, surprised. He thought being asked here meant he was expected to stay with John, to keep him company during the book signing.
But does John? That is the real concern. John, the more open one, the one more conscious of social issues, has not said it. Wouldn’t he say it, if he felt it?
“You’re welcome,” John says. His foot nudges Sherlock’s beneath the table and smirks back. Then, he glances toward the counter. The pub he suggested they meet was not far from Sherlock’s university, apparently, which had certainly explained the sheer number of fellow twentysomethings who had been milling about when John had arrived. Luckily, that lunch crowd had mostly cleared out as of a few minutes ago, and now there is no wait to order. “Are you hungry?”
, isn't it?" John's heart pounded in his chest, perhaps trying to hammer its way out so it could lodge in Sherlock's rib cage instead, where it belonged. Now that he considered all the angles of a marriage proposal, he just wasn’t sure if it was the best move. Luckily, Sherlock seemed to accept his role of talking John down.
would have no way of knowing where she was. They would be ignorant of whether she was still following at the same distance, or if she was approaching them.
When he returns to Sherlock, he finds him still crouched down on the pavement, eyes fixed on the open page of one of his books. John realizes which one it happens to be and watches for a reaction from Sherlock.
After his tense, confusing conversation with Sherlock Holmes and a hastily-gulped down meal, John returned to the infirmary. Exhaustion and dizziness had overtaken him quite without warning, and he soon had fallen into a fitful slumber.
, the crew stirred and began to move about the vessel, tending to early morning duties with sleepy eyes.
John considered that for a moment, eyes on the bandaged wound, hoping those efforts would be enough. Then he turned back to face the pirate. “So what are you going to do with me? Since it seems we’re stuck together.”
“Good,” she says. Then, she looks at John, shifting and biting her lip, as if aware she is interrupting something. “Listen, do you think I could see your notes? I’m worried about it, with the exam so soon…”
Sighing, he sat down in Irene’s place and set to work. As he worked his fingers between the insane knots, he saw Irene and Sherlock standing near the stern. They were standing rather close together, John thought, and laughing together.
John’s sword felt more familiar now, and he nodded. Yet still, his hand twitched involuntarily. Damn. He took a breath to steady himself, Sherlock's patient expression calming him.
However, her discomfort quickly shifted to the backburner, as she caught sight of the image on Watson’s desktop in the instants before he opened his browser. But she could have sworn that was a photo of him and Holmes…
But were they so bad? He had seen nothing but a happy, hard-working crew. There were no signs of mistreatment of the women, no indication of any crime being done. And Sherlock… he was another mystery entirely.
John stepped inside, and the sight of him - or rather, the sight of what he held in his hands - made Sherlock’s eyebrows furrow.
A few minutes later, after John insists on washing up, he is freed to go upstairs to Sherlock’s flat. He’s surprising his boyfriend, because this is his last exam, and John wants to celebrate. He planned in advance, bringing over the ingredients over the past few days. Sherlock, ever oblivious to trivial matters such as the contents of his refrigerator, has no idea. He doesn’t even know what this dish is called; he only refers to it as “that thing with the peas” whenever he requests it from John.
The night after, once the streamers and balloons and general party detritus was finally cleared away completely, John collapsed into bed next to Sherlock. He took a deep breath and exhaled slowly.
“Really?” drawls the student in question, a young man named something pretentious like Alastair or Aston or something — Sherlock hadn’t really bothered to file the name away. Adelbert, maybe? “No one’s going to believe that.”
Now, at this closer proximity, other than the obvious benefit of John touching him, Sherlock can also hear Sholto’s voice, tinny through the phone. “...should be a success, since
“That would be around when I met you,” John said to Sherlock. “But why would Mycroft not tell you Victor was alive? He had no reason to keep that from you.”
He still would not look at John, eyes fixed on the horizon and lips tight. John stepped close, hand covering Sherlock’s where it rested on the wheel. Words fought for dominance on his lips, words like
John watches him interact with his parents, grudgingly happy by their doting, and smiles. Sherlock has become his family, and John thinks, in time, so could Margaret and William.
Moriarty bared his teeth, but Sherlock did not back down. “You wanted to keep me alive, just for a bit longer,” he whispered. “That is your most severe mistake to date.”
Greg bent forward so their heads were together. He didn't know when he and Molly had become so obsessed with this, but he could hardly back down now.
“Not yet, you nosy sod,” John scolds. “Just because I told you a bit yesterday doesn’t mean this is ready for an audience. You can sit here, but don’t read what I’m writing.”
There was a tinge of concern under the nonchalance, and it spurs John forward to tug Sherlock into his arms. “It will, Sherlock,” he whispered fiercely. “It wasn’t an impulse I acted on last night. I told you, I want to be with you in every way, and I will work for this.”
“Alright, alright,” Lestrade said, voice low and calm. He raised his hands to shoulder height and stopped, ten feet away from the pair. “Let’s talk about this.”
“It’s Captain James Moriarty, you insolent creature. Not Victor. Hateful name anyway. Although…” he smirked. “Almost appropriate, as I rule the seas. I am the victor, the conqueror.”
curious about all this, yes, but it still felt invasive. Even if Sherlock had really meant it when he said they needed to talk. “Why are you a pirate?”
“Anything you’re interested in exploring, as long as it’s a topic within the time period we’ve covered.” Watson said. “Just email me your ideas, or run it by me after class. Any questions?”
“Do you bring in drafts for the students to look at?” Sherlock asks, a glint in his eyes. John can see the eagerness there.
They remained curled up on the floor for several minutes, catching their breath. Finally, John rolled off Sherlock to the side, but Sherlock immediately pulled him in to his side.
John stopped next to him and dropped his bag on the ground by their feet then leaned against the fence. “What are you doing out here, handsome?”
It had been nearly a month now. Nearly a month of the texts and the steadily growing distance from John.
Sherlock tilts his head, mouth curving up on one side. He looks rather pleased, rather full of wonder. As if he has never imagined this, has never thought anyone would ever ask him out, has never believed he could be liked.
“Yeah.” John’s voice has a hint of irritation in it now. “Your ambitions. That’s the sort of things people in a relationship talk about.”
John laughed, but sobered quickly. “Right, but still.” He met Sherlock’s eyes, a crease in his forehead and a slightly distressed expression on his face. “You’re only seventeen.”
“Oh?” Sherlock teased. He felt more at ease than he had in ages. “What else? I wasn’t aware there was anything to life besides working.”
As if the universe had heard Sherlock speak, a great creak rent the air. The Dutch ship was near enough that John heard her crew cry out as one. She had smashed into a reef, a fatal blow from the looks of it. Seconds later, the mainmast splintered and tumbled into the waves. The ship pitched to the side, then began unmistakably to sink.
John blinked, surprised. He had not realized that might have been the true reason Sherlock had been on the deck. Certainly one of Sherlock’s own crew meant more to him than a guest who sailed with the British Royal Navy. Even with them being on better terms, his attentions to John were likely a mere courtesy.
He was about to look up, to call for Molly and ask her to take Sherlock below to recover, when movement made him freeze. Sherlock coughed. His eyes flicked back and forth beneath their lids, and he stirred in John’s arms. With what appeared to be a monumental effort, Sherlock forced his eyes open.
“Well…” John had thought earlier in the day of inviting Sherlock to this, but now—faced with the actual asking—he is unsure. Sherlock still acts reluctant, both in showing and receiving affection. Not that that is a problem; this is only their third date, so it isn’t so surprising he is still guarded. Still, how will he react? Well, best to just tear off the plaster.
“Firstly, I have interrupted you twice, not constantly,” John says with a grin as he enters the room and climbs into bed. “How are you liking it?”
Rosie sighed. John watched, as if observing a tennis match, as the two went back and forth. Rosie’s ability to formulate and express her opinion seemed advanced amongst her age group, no doubt thanks to her papa. “That’s different. It’s… for fun. Pretend. Kids have Friend Valentines ’cause they love each other. Grown-ups have Mushy Valentines ’cause they Love each other.” Her ability to make capital letters audible — also undoubtedly inherited from Sherlock.
Upstairs, in 221B, silence reigned, punctuated only by the soft breathing emanating from the bedroom.
They hang up, and Sherlock retreats into the bedroom after turning off his laptop. He changes into pyjamas and crawls under the covers, missing the warmth John emanates when they spend the night together. He doesn’t plan on sleeping much, but he thinks if he at least tries, the time they are apart might pass quicker.
They stare at each other. Finally, after several lengthy moments, John clears his throat. “I’m glad you called.”
on cat’s feet. The space was dark, no light at all coming from the portholes. So Sherlock had to work blind, relying on his fingers and ears and memory.
