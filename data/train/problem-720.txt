"Sherlock, I'm a bloody doctor. I'm going to be perfectly fine. Promise."
The next thing he knew, something wet slapped the side of his head, and he looked up just in time to see Sherlock fling another handful of orange slime right at his face.
"Still not good, Sherlock."
"D'you really have to
“Case? What case? Bloody hell, Sherlock, what have you done now?”
"Stir it?" Sherlock wrinkled his nose.
Sherlock: 22
?” John said, resisting the urge to laugh.
"As though he has a choice in the matter," Sherlock scoffed, not daring to mention to Teddy just how dangerous Seb was. "Besides, what do you suppose
A gleaming, silver swarm of bees swooped about the room, filled every corner, silently zipping about with a determined air. They surrounded them, the entire chamber shining with the light of a million little spots of energy. Sherlock’s jaw dropped as John spun around, laughing and twirling through the silver cloud. It illuminated every curve of his face, made his eyes sparkle like they had under the stars. Sherlock gasped before chasing him down and holding him in a tight embrace, practically lifting him off his feet.
Sherlock shook his head. He giggled. “Maybe Gray’s just a big fat liar. He does have a painting in his attic that ages for him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You...really think so?” Even he knew it was lame, and he’d figured it would irritate Sherlock immensely to be asked to repeat himself.
One of the first times Sherlock had the pleasure of John's company, he had barely started nursery school, and was too young to even think of being embarrassed about wetting the bed. John's sleeping bag spread out on the floor below him made him smile as he snuggled under the covers and his mother kissed him goodnight.
John thought Sherlock's tale was hilarious.
“Sherlock, I…I have to go. Harry’s expecting me.”
“In what alternate reality would I care about something like this?”
John looked up as if in contemplation for a moment, then smirked. "Alright."
"You should know better. What knocked me out?"
Someone cleared her throat, and John found himself following Mrs. Holmes’s example of swallowing his laughter as a woman that could only be her twin approached. Trailing behind her were two teenagers in matching green robes and a man wearing a similarly colored tie. John was actually alarmed at how much Mrs. Holmes’s eyes contrasted with her warm smile.
John would live.
Sherlock’s heart skipped a beat. “Come again?”
It didn't help much though, and that first week at uni was utterly boring to Sherlock.
Sherlock turned his head as far as he could. "John?"
"Hm?"
“John?” Sherlock muttered after a moment.
“Are you frightened, John?”
John's frustration was put on pause. "Wasn't it?" He looked at Sherlock, who stared at him with wide, shocked eyes that somehow still seemed to be awaiting John's reaction.
"I'll let your...him back in now."
"You know, I don't have any lectures tomorrow. I could go with you to take notes."
It was always a treat for Sherlock, being able to stay over at John's flat. It was less of a treat when John had work or class the next morning, but even so, there was something satisfying in dancing around one another as the sun rose.
“Precisely. That, in combination with some of the things Mycroft has had me take a look at this term, is enough to make me think that a stranger giving you odd looks is no coincidence.” Sherlock looked at him, his eyes intense. “Just look out.”
The laugh came out as more of a giggle.
Sherlock hesitated simply because the smile reminded him more of a lazy crocodile than anything else. Not frightening, but certainly unpleasant. “Yes,” he eventually said. “And you are…?”
The air around Sherlock seemed to crackle. “Do you know what you’re dealing with?”
“Neither did I.”
“S’okay ’Lock.”
"Thank you, John's Mummy," Sherlock lisped at the ceiling.
"'Night, Honeybee."
Sherlock scrunched his nose.
"In a bit, perhaps. Don't think I could right this instant."
Sherlock and John looked at each other and grinned, and this time Sherlock was sure they were communicating telepathically.
Mycroft looked at him coldly. “What is your relationship to Sherlock Holmes?”
Greg chuckled as they approached the place. "At least get inside the building before you start getting each other off."
“What is going on up there?” Greg hissed.
"Can I talk to Sherlock?" he asked when Mycroft answered the door.
“Did you find out about Mary, too?” He asked softly.
Sherlock hesitated for a moment, opening his mouth and closing it again, pressing his lips into a thin line before he answered John, listing off what all he had taken and how much. He also produced a handwritten list, the one Mycroft had always asked him to write when he used.
When John learns of Mary's true identity, and what it is that she used to do for a living, he's conflicted with how that will effect his life long term.
John smiled some, watching Sherlock hold his daughter and something in his chest tightened. He stood straighter at the feeling and seemed to struggle with himself for a moment.
He sat his phone on his desk and sat down in his armchair, crossing his legs and lifted his arms, placing his palms and outstretched fingers together. He tilted his head back and closed his eyes, pressing the tips of his middle fingers just against the soft flesh of his chin. It didn’t take long for him to sink into his mind palace and continue his dream from earlier, imaging his rosy cheeked John Watson mere inches from his lips.
“Uh, yeah. Go ahead.”
John cut him off. “Sherlock, shut up. How did I not see the signs! I’m a bloody doctor!”
His heart twisted in his chest and a lump formed in his throat. “Well, yes, don’t panic. You’ve had plenty of practice being parents. You’ll hardly need me around now that you’re having a real baby.”
His speech dragged on for a ridiculously long amount of time, most of it being interluded by some ‘clever’ remark about his views on something. “Regardless, I must say in the position of my best friend, John is the wisest and most courageous man that I have ever known. He has saved my life on several occasions, and while I may solve the cases, he always remembers to save the lives involved. He is a kind and selfless man, though I may not openly admit that often, and he is not entirely an idiot.” He paused for the chuckle from the crowd. “He is a man of a much higher resolve than I myself can say. For what he lacks in deductive ability, he makes up for in his ever present need to take care of those around him and he has earned my highest respect in doing just that.”
Sherlock ground his teeth together. It was his turn to be pissed off. “You’re the one who abandoned me for her!”
“One of those things will be about Mary. The first… Is I would like to say I’m sorry, John. For how I acted. I reacted poorly and should have been more appreciative of you being there to help me.”
Sherlock was not only in the hospital, John had insisted that he be placed on suicide watch for a minimum of two weeks. Sherlock naturally thought it was silly, because John knew better than most that Sherlock was not capable of killing himself. He found the idea to be doing more harm that good, despite feeling at times that those around him would be happier if he wasn’t there to make rude comments or make them feel like idiots.
Other observations from previous (possibly flirty?) interactions, questions to be explored later and
Thank you so much for all the kudos and comments! I am so pleased people seem to be enjoying my story. I have never really written before so this is an experiment of my own. :)
Thank you for reading! I would love to hear your thoughts/feelings/etc! <3
John chuckles and kisses your forehead. “And a pain in my arse!”
This is not a song fic, buuuut since the last chapter had a song to go with it, I decided to include this for your listening pleasure because it made me giggle while I wrote this:
That silence... The moment John paused before reacting. It had a whole conversation, a whole world inside of it. His face, his body, his eyes all had micro expressions that built the framing of new room in your mind palace. Loosely belting your dressing gown back into place, barely even noticing its presence anymore, you collapse into your black armchair and vaguely watch the shape of your flatmate making breakfast while exploring this new information. You play the scene on repeat in your mind’s eye, leaning to one side, elbow on the armrest, resting your mouth against the knuckles of a loosely curled fist, making a fairly striking modern interpretation of The Thinker statue. You begin filling this new Mind Palace room with observations.
John’s eyebrows perk up slightly but manages to recover quickly. “Of course.”
The next several minutes fill with warm, slippery touches and mildly awkward exchanges of smiles and “This okay?” And it is. John is perfect, as usual. You are again struck by the vast difference between this encounter and all the rest – bright and soft and loving, instead of furtive, quick... meaningless.
"Oh, right." He flipped open his brand-new mobile phone.
!” he shouted when a bit of the steadily growing fire licked at his arm and singed the hair there.
"It's really soft," John whispered contentedly. Sherlock could hear him rustling around, curled up in the fleece lining.
He rested a finger on the tiniest of freckles near Sherlock's temple. He held on to his ear lobe for a moment before moving on to his lips. He was rewarded by a swift kiss to the palm of his hand, and he mentally added Patrick Swayze to the list of people he felt like he needed to thank for the best things in his life.
Sherlock shook his head. “You’re our guest. You have to go first.”
“An extra set of eyes is invaluable to me, John.”
John had discovered quickly that between rugby and studying, it was difficult to maintain a relationship. Especially with a boyfriend as needy as his.
“Hello, Mycroft.” John tried to be as polite and cool-headed as he could, given the circumstances.
“Society would say no, especially considering we’re in the same bed.”
John sighed. “Listen, can we talk about it tomorrow? It’s been a long day.”
John just barely stopped himself from groaning. “Mary can take care of it. She’ll be fine.”
“That’s…!” he began indignantly, but decided she should at least know that truth. “That’s exactly right, actually.”
John shook his head. He patted the cushion next to him. “Come here.”
Mycroft glared across the table at him as John barked out an involuntary laugh. Sherlock quirked an eyebrow and speared a bit of food rather purposely with his fork.
As John's arms settled around him, Sherlock let out a contented hum. He twined his feet around John's calves and kissed the back of his hand.
“John,
“You are mistaken,” Sherlock replied, steadfast in his conviction.
"P-perfect." John looked around at the tiny room. "Have you got any ideas about what to do til this blows over?"
There was a knock at the door, and when Sherlock froze Victor bolted over to open it for him.
Sherlock picked up his empty bag and headed toward the door. Soon they were on their way, James Bond and Jareth the Goblin King walking side-by-side down the street.
"How so?"
turn him back?” Sherlock asked.
“Perhaps we shouldn’t go back,” Sherlock suggested.
"You're in
“Ah, I should’ve known. Well, what’s your favorite poison?”
Sherlock laid his head on John's shoulder. "Yes. Maybe."
“It wouldn’t have anything to do with not having to think about going home for the holidays, would it?” Harry said.
“Yes, I’m helping with breakfast,” Mycroft confirmed as he entered the room with a tea tray. John thought he looked a bit out of place in his pyjamas, but he wasn’t surprised to find that they were made of a rich purple silk.
“Yeah. Oh, and by the way, that whole ‘swoop in and save Holmes’ bit was nauseating. Do save us all the trouble of losing our breakfast next time and skip the melodramatics.”
“Now, Sherlock, behave. Wilson will be here, you actually get along with him,” Mrs. Holmes pointed out.
“Why do you have that?” he asked as Sherlock placed it on his head, clearly disgusted with himself for doing so.
“Oh, come on, John, it’s always dangerous. If it weren’t, you wouldn’t be here.”
"No, it was awkward."
He shrugged. "Let's get back to the Yard," Sherlock suggested, leading John back out onto the street.
“So I’m your escape plan?”
“No, I mean—it’s you. You did this.” He kissed him roughly, quickly. “I thought of you.”
The look that crossed behind Sherlock’s eyes nearly broke him. It was such a rare look of hurt and confusion that it was all John could do to listen to Moriarty’s words and repeat them stiffly.
Suddenly, he kicked out on a backward swing, catching John’s knee.
Sherlock turned to him. “You think so?” he said, genuinely curious, which sent John into fresh giggles, which in turn set them off in Sherlock. They laughed gleefully until they were slumped against each other, catching their breath.
I will be consistent.
"I can make it."
"Thank you, I think," John replied, eyebrows raised.
But he did. He wasn’t sure why, but he really did.
It was true that John had hardly gone all-out this Halloween, but that didn't change how great he himself looked in his cheap costume. The too-shiny metal plates attached to his shoulders made them look even broader than they were, and the wooden sword swinging from his hip made Sherlock think of other things below the waist, which in turn made him go bright red.
"So? It's not as if he doesn't know we're together. What's he going to do,
John didn’t know what to say, but he knew he didn’t want anyone but Wendy beating themselves up about what happened at dinner, least of all Wilson. “Don’t say that.”
“It doesn’t matter.”
Happy fourth of July to all of my American friends. And in celebration of our independence, I post another chapter of...a crossover...of...two British franchises.
Sherlock didn't say anything for a moment. Then he said, "I liked it."
“Do you remember what you said?”
John was suddenly beginning to realize he rarely saw Sherlock at mealtimes, but he’d assumed it was his way of avoiding people, going to meals early to skip the rush.
Your eyes and head tilt ask, gently squeezing the fingers that envelope his. Fear and guilt spark from John, still in panic mode,
Lovefool - The Cranberries
He deposits the contents of his hands on the bedside table; a bottle of lube that was mostly full and four shiny condom packets.
John’s held breath rushes out onto your lips, shuddering and still smelling of tea, somehow. His mouth crashes down onto yours violently. The kiss is so possessive that it borders on painful. You are almost, unthinkably, about to ask John to stop when suddenly he is staring down at you again with that same intense look as if trying to read tiny print on your retinas.
“I don’t know! Maybe you wanted them. Or maybe you hate the mess. I wasn’t exactly thinking clearly with all my blood to my brain otherwise occupied, Mister Holmes. I just grabbed a handful and ran back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh damn. Sorry, I thought-”
What could go wrong?
“Seriously, why?”
, he thinks miserably, but knows deep down that self-pity was masking a deeper fear. He looks up to see John’s eyes narrow slightly at him, thin lines gathering beneath them with the well-practiced squint of concern. Had he made his feelings too obvious just then? Sherlock’s thoughts fly by in panic. Fast, much too fast to actually read them and stands stock still.
Nibbling on the last bit of crust left of your toast, you finally brave a glance up. John has finished his food and is watching you with interest, arms crossed over his chest. He doesn’t seem at all perturbed at being caught staring, and the realization hits that this is a different John indeed from the one who found you sprawled on the rug earlier. The shift from furtive to brazen now that his feelings are out in the open feels monumental, not to mention
So I will share this room with you,

appreciate the sight, his lips and chest are pressed to yours. The temperature change on your skin makes you shudder involuntarily as your arms slip to wrap around his shoulders. His arms find your waist and pull to eliminate the last bit of space between you. You feel the rough prickling sensation of his chest hair, blond and barely visible, slide over your own darker body hair and grin into his lips. John responds with a soft growl and presses his hips forward, the unmistakable pressure of his erection jabbing into your hipbone.
Hi, sorry this is so short. I noticed I've been meandering between past and present tense as I'm writing, so I'm trying hard to keep that under control. It's a bad habit I've had since high school. So, I've been editing and reposting chapters for both my WIPs and it was sucking up what little time I had to dedicate to writing.
“You’re so handsome.” He breathes, rubbing a thumb over your right cheekbone. It’s your turn to laugh, a low, self-deprecating chuckle. You try to turn your face down, away from the praise, but John holds fast. “Seriously, Sherlock. You’re stunning.”
“I love you.”
His smile is gentle but his voice is rough. “Is this the aforementioned begging?” Apparently even in the throes of love-making you cannot escape John’s penchant for sarcasm. You decide to not rise to the bait.
– the plaque would read –
His mind supplies, helpfully.
God, you want this. In this moment, it feels like all you have ever wanted. Despite this, though, something whispers, itches at the back of your mind enough to speak up.
In one fluid motion, John cuts off your train of thought by pushing forward and up. Warm, rough lips are on yours. Startled, your eyes widen, but you see his are closed and tense – He's decided to gamble everything on this and you are paralyzed. John ebbs back when nothing happens, and your body aches at the missing warmth.
Sorry about the angsty ending... :(
(Insert gif of SPN Crowley hatefully spitting out the word "Feelings")
that trip him up as if wading through molasses and it’s statistically a painful process. Honestly, best to avoid it as much as possible.
Sherlock plasters a sheepish grin on his face and runs one hand through the damp hair on the back of his head in a show of contriteness. His dressing gown pulls up from the action but, thankfully, he had a towel tucked around his waist. Why did John have to make everything so awkward? Wait, since when had he ever felt awkward about nudity? … Best to investigate more on that later.
Sherlock shudders at the word despite the steamy heat but presses on. For science.
Someone was either ambitious or overly cautious. Though, anyone was possible to be both of those things at once, it was John Watson. He must have seen your thoughts on your face, because you hear him give a nervous huff of laughter.
He rubs his hands over his face lightly and allows himself a soft sigh. Emotions are so... thick, and heavy. Thoughts are lightning fast, and he finds he can hop easily between them, back and forth. It’s
Emotion threatens to overwhelm you. Your vision wavers and you close your eyes to shutter up any tears. Not again. That was enough for today. Clearing your throat, you fall into being playful instead. When you open your eyes again, you adopt the most obnoxiously regal accent you can muster.
“Say, I have something I’d like you to read over,” He plows forward, knowing he will lose his nerve if he doesn’t say this now. “Since you aren’t sleeping...?”
I wanted to make a longer(ish) chapter to make up for the last one being so short. Please let me know what you think?
And so, you both stand there, hip to hip, looking in each other's eyes as a bubble of ‘What now?’ expands into the space. Before the hesitation can grow awkward, you lean to press a soft chaste kiss to John’s mouth and murmur softly against his lips, intentionally dropping your voice low so he can feel it as well as hear it.
He turns to the table with two plates, setting one before you and another to your left. Somewhere, in your midst of your revery, he had made toast that sits buttered and lovely next to your (not runny) eggs. You try to convince your transport the sting in your eyes is most definitely not tears and instead perhaps steam from the food. John sits beside you, fork in hand, oblivious to your current emotional renaissance.
Later, while cuddled together watching telly, you run your fingers along the arm of the couch, smiling at the sensation of the leather surface. Aside from the skull, you didn’t take a lot of stock in talking to inanimate objects but it felt appropriate to give a mental ‘thank you’ for rolling you onto the floor this morning.
The process of analysing the data and writing up a conclusion that would reflect if his original Hypothesis was upheld by said data took hours and, to be honest, more self-reflection than Sherlock had anticipated. In the barely pre-dawn hours, he reads through it once more for final edits. The weight of the task rolls off of him like a stone, and he stretches his arms and shoulders with a grimace. He makes extra sure the file is saved properly, sets the laptop aside, and timidly pokes his head out to see if the coast was clear.
Now for a chapter from John's POV!
When John’s eyes find yours again, you notice they are shiny with unfallen tears, but his face is set and stubborn. You like that face, it means he’s made up his mind about something. A spark of excitement flash through your mind and travel down your spine, not even remembering that barely an hour ago you were bored to the point of trying to melt into the sofa. How is it possible for John Watson to get even more fascin-
. Golden, muscled, and aroused, he looks like something out of legend. Even the gnarled scar at his shoulder has its own appeal, not diminishing the aura of strength in the slightest.
He kisses your chin. “And brilliant.” Then, your nose. “And sexy as hell.” And your lips.
John talks off and on as they wander through the building and the detective dutifully attempts the suggestions he read about “Active Listening” - rephrasing back what John says to illustrate he has heard him, asking open ended questions to keep him talking. He even clamped his teeth down on the tip of his tongue to stop himself from correcting John when he misidentifies a Chromodoris nudibranch as a sea cucumber.
Ok so this is not the end, but what I have written became SO LONG that I wanted to at least give you all something to read as I work to finish it. :)
You consider giving your typical non-committal answer so you can get back to mental reorganizing but your transport informs you it would indeed like some nourishment by way of a mild cramp on the left side of your belly and a growl. Well then.
To more Johnlock smooching!
Song for "Quality Time":
boredom. Your chest clenches slightly at the thought, not wanting it to have been a pantomime birthed from your imagination. Except maybe the embarrassing growling stomach bit, that can stay fiction. So far, the joint aches and warmth do nothing to disprove you are still in the sitting room recovering from a rough nap. But then, the ‘couch’

bored by the saccharine displays and taken control by now to get to the point, get it over with. The urge to take, to overrun, to press and press until you get what you want, is all still there – thrumming in time with the pulse in your throat – but this is not a race to paroxysm with a casual stranger to clear your racing mind. This was a man you know and live with and work with. A man that loves you. You would rather be dragged to hell than push too hard and shatter that. You want
, anything John was willing to give, but you have no idea what he may or may not want. And so, despite your already weak self-control dwindling fast until his tender attentions, you again resolve to let John set the pace. The restraint gives you another involuntary shudder.
, in this moment.
Sensing your tremors, John pushes closer into your space to wrap both arms around your waist. Your torsos press together and the heat of him seeps through the thin fabric of your t-shirt.
You smile at the misconception, but don’t feel compelled to correct him. Slotted snugly in John’s embrace, you tilt your head deeper and let your lips part in invitation. Your hands slide up his delightfully well-defined biceps and deltoids to run fingertips into the tactilely pleasing short hair at his nape, then up, up into the longer, soft strands at the back of his head. The touch seems to surge John forward into your lips, taking the offering of your open mouth to morph the sweet, cherishing kisses to something more urgent. Tongues touch, swirl, explore. John tastes unsurprisingly of tea, salt, and butter.
Mrs. Holmes raised her eyebrows even higher once Sherlock had said it twice. “And he asked you, did he?”
“So you
“What’s wrong?”
John hadn’t been paying much attention to the conversation going on around him, so he couldn’t tell whether this was a sudden change of subject. He’d been watching Sherlock shove bits of roast duck all around his plate sourly.
"Fine," he panted. "I just...the altitude..."
“Hi, Molly. Mind if I sit here?” The boy pointed across the table to a vacant seat.
“You’re not eating?” John said, swallowing a mouthful of food as Kreacher scurried away.
keep up.”
“Right….What?”
John rolled his eyes and sighed, reached out a hand, and twisted the suspect's dominant arm behind him, slamming him against the wall of the building next to them and forcing him to drop his weapon.
Sherlock shrugged, uncomfortable.
"You mean...? Oh.
John sighed. "Alright, let's see...scurvy grass and sneezewort..."
“Fair enough. But you've got to eat sometime.”
After the awkwardness subsided, the meal continued with conversation about Holmes traditions for the remainder of the Christmas holiday.
“I’ll work on it,” he grumbled, which seemed to appease John, because he directed his attention straight back to the parchment in front of him without pursuing the subject.
“But that’s all the same, I’m sure you understand, Mikey, old boy,” Andrew was saying to Sherlock, clapping him on the shoulder as though he’d continued talking through the tense moment. Maybe he had.
“I’m not an idiot, peanut breath!”
John was startled when Sherlock stood and looked around before discreetly making his way up the aisle between tables, headed for the giant double-doors.
Sherlock waved awkwardly, nodded politely at Sarah, and took John’s suitcase from him.
Those times were fun, somehow, when the both of them were rushing through their routine, briefly touching each other on the elbow, the hand, the shoulder, to get them through the morning as quickly as possible. But Sherlock's favorite mornings, of course, occurred during the weekend, and always had him coming back for Saturday nights in John's flat, drinking and laughing and finally going to bed around three AM. Because hours later, when he would open his eyes--always before John--he got to watch him, and kiss him, and perhaps even ride him when he did wake.
Mycroft groaned and turned to his father. "Are you really going to--?"
"What about?"
The body on the bed above him rolled and looked over the edge. "What is it, Sherlock?"
“Sherlock!”
John didn’t have an answer. He didn’t want to have an answer. He curled closer around Sherlock, who tensed ever so slightly.
"That doesn't mean you can go after him," Sherlock shot at her, then realized what he'd done and went red.
“Shut up, John! Yes I can!”
John sighed, ready to settle in and nod off after being thoroughly disheveled and debauched by a no longer preoccupied Sherlock, and disheveling and debauching him in return, but instead he forced himself to be the reasonable one. "Sherlock, we're going to have to sneak you back out of here soon."
Greg Lestrade, always the voice of reason. “I know.”
John thought about that, then said, “I’m sorry. You’re right. I won’t talk about Sherlock.”
"You're right, perhaps 'lost' isn't the right word. 'Reluctant,' more like."
think about when it came to Sherlock back at the flat. Was he eating? Probably not. Sleeping? Doubtful. Staying off of his foot at least as much as was necessary? Not likely.
“Mmmm,” was Sherlock’s only reply.
“Please,” Sherlock scoffed. “See those beams there, and the structure of the foundation? No, this building was built to last. More than that, to contain something. Something destructive.”
He wanted to argue, but she'd clearly just proven the case. "But what do I do about it?"
Sherlock reached over and picked up the phone, sitting firmly on the suspect's shoulder blades, and held it to his ear. "Lestrade, if you're not here in ten minutes, you might have to arrest
“Together?” John suggested.
Sherlock glanced at the clock above the lighted mirror. "We've got about twenty minutes. I don't know why everyone else is so eager to get out there, it's just one badly-written song and a bow." They had been alone in the dressing room for a few minutes already, their castmates having leapt at the chance to leave.
“Back off. Just do us both a favor and back off.”
“Nothing. You’re just…Sherlock.”
“Isn’t that what we’re doing?”
“John should go first.”
He was embarrassed. His skin prickled in unpleasant ways and all he wanted to do was curl into a ball and force down the lump in his throat. Right before John, who up to now had seen the rawest bits of emotion he'd thought he possessed, he was proving himself wrong on that very count.
“Hey, Watson,” Moran said when he sat down and dragged some eggs over onto his plate.
“What? Why?”
Sherlock’s head shot up suddenly. John quirked an eyebrow at him. “I’m going to bed.”
"I'm trying!"
They sat in silence for a moment, staring at each other. Then Sherlock said, "Remember the first time you held my hand?"
"Absolutely. He's all for that couple tripe, he just won't admit it."
"It was just a kiss."
John smiled wistfully. "Ah, the good old days," he joked.
"Let's see." John considered for a moment. "Well, I had my first kiss when I was ten. Her name was Sarah. She lived next door. Still does, in fact. She's a Muggle. She was fascinated with the way I could make her dolls levitate." He sighed. "Of course, she had to get her memory modified when she went and told her parents about it. I got in trouble for that. Got told off because I was 'old enough to know better.'"
She sighed. “Look, I don’t know what you think you’re doing hanging around him, but I’m telling you, it’s a bad idea.”
was where Sherlock got his proclivity for innuendo.
“Brilliant. Her family went on holiday to Australia. But you already know that, don’t you?”
“What?” Sherlock panted through kisses to John’s neck, sensing his amused distraction.
Sherlock scoffed. John smiled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Then where are we going?”
"Where?"
." John laughed. "He's shagging someone?"
"Would you like to go with me?" John suggested, unsure.
"Oh." His eyes went wide. "
"Waltz!"
"No, you will," the man shot back.
“No, someone else is going to get themselves killed. By Polly Winston.”
“The hell you are.” John situated himself between Sherlock and the exit. “You’re not going home until I get at least some explanation.”
“How is it my fault he’s daft?”
John swallowed before smirking in return. He touched Sherlock’s silk-clad shoulder and leant forward, his lips next to the other man’s ear. “Sit,” he whispered.
“She comes to the Dark Forest? Why on earth would she come to the
simply flown into the path of his already swinging club, and that John would have stopped himself if he’d seen him coming.
He smirked and sighed contentedly.
“Yeah, okay, I did,” Jim conceded immediately. “But the flirting’s over, Sherlock, Daddy’s had enough now!”
"My mother?"
Sherlock glared at him. “The case is boring.”
He was just closing the door, fresh towels in hand, when he turned and came face-to-face with Mycroft, who took one look at the towels that were clearly too many for one person and raised his eyebrows.
Sherlock jumped up. "Oh, fantastic! Thank you, John. Our disguises are in the car."
It was during his shower, exactly a week after moving into his new room, that things began to get interesting, because that was when, just as he'd rinsed the shampoo from his hair, the fire alarm went off.
“Start answering my owls,” the other replied, more dangerous than before. More than a challenge, it was a command.
"Why on earth did you do that?"
"No, Molly, I've told you before. I won't be your boyfriend."
"Calm yourselves down before I have to arrest you for public indecency," he laughed.
"They love the
As promised (sort of, vaguely), here's the next chapter since I'm so bad at deadlines.
Sherlock had gone all out with that year's costume. In fact, he had gone a bit overboard. At two in the afternoon, Mycroft had started his makeup. Three hours later, he'd been forced to redo it twice because, in Sherlock's words, it "didn't look Bowie enough." He was busy with the third application of eyeliner and cursing himself for ever taking Sherlock to see that film when there was a knock at the door.
. But he didn't point this out. Instead, he replied, "You look great as well."
He resisted a breathless laugh.
It was lucky that Sherlock had grown bored of his company and decided to work on an experiment of some sort, giving John time to check the gifts and properly wrap them before going to the sitting room and placing them under the Christmas tree just as he heard Sherlock call him.
Sherlock glared.
“Fine,” Sherlock sighed. “If you want to rest, we’ll rest. Meet me in the secret passageway on the third floor at ten 0’clock.”
“I fell asleep on top of the astronomy tower last night. Won’t happen again.”
John rolled his eyes. "Lucky me. I'll drive." He climbed into the front seat.
Sherlock’s hands flew out to bat the piece of chocolate out of John’s hand, but he stopped himself, unable to think of a proper excuse. “Honestly, John, I don’t see how it could be any different from what you usually have with ice cream,” he said very quickly.
"I don't see why not. It is hardly a difficult task to do up a bowtie." Sherlock stood up straight and placed both hands on John's chest.
“You’re a Prefect, John!”
“I’m glad no one saw that,” John said, offering him an out but not exactly sure what he was saying himself.
Sherlock studied his position and determined that he was tied to something that slowly pulled him further into the lake. He waded in, ignoring the chill as his cloak billowed over the water, and felt for the ropes that he knew must be there, reaching for his wand. “Hold on, I’ll get you out of there.”
“I was going to get my trunk.”
At least, that was what he told himself.
"Then we match," John replied with a smile, and all of the tension left Sherlock's shoulders. Victor was right. John was glad they matched. He shouldn't have been so nervous; John had asked him to accompany him to the party, after all. Clearly he thought of Sherlock as his date, right? It was just all happening too quickly for Sherlock to process.
Mike seemed to realize his mistake, but took it in stride. "Well, that's bad luck. But I'm sure Sherlock's happy to have you home. How is he, anyway?"
“Well, it’s close, I’ll give you the satisfaction of that.”
“Please, John, refrain from stating the obvious and take me upstairs.”
Half an hour later, they were surrounded by Christmas wrappings, putting off getting dressed until the last second. John and Sherlock were both lying in a sort of nest of wrappings, sighing pleasantly every so often. Even Mycroft sat forward with his legs folded, his elbows resting on his knees, and his eyes closed, a contented smile drifting dangerously close to the corners of his mouth.
John said nothing.
Sherlock sighed and joined them on the sofa just as a photograph from some picnic became visible.
“A femur.”
John’s heart sunk like a stone as the dot of another laser sight found its way to rest on Sherlock’s forehead. Sherlock closed his eyes and sighed in frustration as though this was just what he’d expected. As soon as he regained function of his own limbs, John had no choice but to release Moriarty and back away, arms raised in surrender to the invisible sniper.
This was going to be a long plane ride.
Sherlock hovered constantly at his side, now that the suspect was cuffed in the back of a police car. "Are you sure?"
They sat in silence until the cab arrived, then ushered each other into it. John had left his cane behind in the alley, proving that Ella was at least right about some things, but also making things rather more difficult at the moment. His shoulder still burned, and he cursed the past year, cursed his decision to leave Baker Street in the first place, his addiction to danger, the things Sherlock's absence had done to him...the things his absence had done to Sherlock.
By the time dessert came round—a rather large chocolate cake with the richest frosting John had ever tasted—Sherlock was beginning to get antsy. He barely made a single remark about Mycroft having a second piece, which John thought odd; Sherlock never missed an opportunity to tease Mycroft, especially if Mycroft was actually around to hear his commentary. However, it was clear by the time Sherlock abruptly asked, “May we be excused?” that he was simply bored with the proceedings when he could be snogging John next to his prized experiments.
The corner of John’s mouth perked up into a small smirk. “Sure is nice, being one of the Holmes boys.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes again and sighed, obviously aware of Sherlock’s spoiling the gift. “Don’t mention it.” He practically threw a similarly wrapped gift at Sherlock. It rattled when it landed in his lap. “You next, brother dear,” Mycroft said sarcastically.
Love could be flipped on its head, but Sherlock was lucky. He had John. And John was always careful.
Sherlock looked around, puzzled. “Where’s Mycroft?”
It occurred to John as he dressed for dinner that he might miss snogging Sherlock in the middle of the day once the holidays were over and they had to go back to Hogwarts. In fact, he was probably going to miss the whole atmosphere at Holmes Manor. He would miss Sherlock’s mother at mealtimes fussing over Sherlock’s latest shenanigans, her praise of John for keeping him out of trouble at least to an extent, and then her chiding Sherlock for turning mild-mannered John into another mischievous thrill seeker. He would miss Sherlock’s constant argument that he had been that way when they met, and he would miss Sherlock’s father’s way of letting the geniuses go back and forth, rolling his eyes occasionally but always smiling around a mouthful of food.
After several moments of staring into the darkness, John looked over at Sherlock, his cheeks glowing by starlight, eyebrows knit together. “What am I meant to be doing exactly?”
Sherlock agrees to study with John. What could possibly go wrong?
"I know. You didn't mean anything by it."
“Sleep!” he shouted over his shoulder, slamming his bedroom door behind him.
“Where?” Lestrade asked, taken aback.
“Wait,” Sherlock cut in, smirking. “Is that how you lost all that weight five years ago?”
“Got it?”
“You’ll be at the rugby party Friday, right?”
“Come on, Sherlock, spit it out.”
Andrew looked again at the large tumbler-shaped bowl suspiciously, then seemed to get the joke. “Funny. That’s funny,” he muttered good-naturedly, and promptly began snoring.
"Not real ones," Harry said in answer to her own question. "Sherlock is your real friend, John. He may be younger, and he may be...odd, but you two have been inseparable for years. And those boys...well, if those other boys have a problem with you kissing a boy, then they're not very good people."
"Yeah, Sherlock, I'm here."
But Sherlock was different, somehow…
John smiled. "We've got to get out there," he murmured, clearly not wanting to break Sherlock away from his happy reflection on recent events.
"Oh. Well then he has a good eye for making other people look entirely too attractive for their own good."
Sherlock grumbled, out of arguments. "What else do you want me to do?" he huffed.
“I told you, I’ve got better ways to occupy my time.”
"Good. Then kindly fuck off."
“Well, you shouldn’t need stitches, it isn’t really
John looked at him. "Really?"
Molly's eyes were wide when he broke away from her. After a moment, she shook her head.
“Dear Sherlock,” he wrote, and then slumped in his chair. He couldn’t believe John was making him do this.
"What?"
With a sigh, he reached around the curtain, but met only the terrycloth of his towel hanging on the hook.
"We’re the only ones here, John."
“Good thing, too,” Mrs. Holmes said, breaking into their moment, tearing down the heavy eye contact that had been drawing John toward Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock rolled his eyes and huffed impatiently at her interruption.
John leaned in and whispered into Sherlock’s ear, “I have ways of getting what I want.”
“Yes, fine. Sorry.”
"That's an empty threat."
“Sherlock, you have to see this!”
"Myc, let him in," Mrs. Holmes insisted. She appeared in the doorway herself, and although she did not look on John unkindly, there was a grimness there that he wasn't even sure was meant for him.
Standing next to the miraculous bed that had simply appeared in the room, John placed his hands on Sherlock’s chest and kissed him again, letting himself be enveloped by the warmth of the arms that settled around him easily, as they had hundreds of times before. This time, though, there was an electric current there that ran straight through to the skin of his back, unimpeded by the layers of cloth between source and destination.
“Is in the
Now he could just keep working on it, maybe get it to take shape—
John laughed and kissed him again.
The two of them fell asleep on the sofa. Mrs. Holmes called John's mother to tell her that it was probably best if John stayed over. Before bed, she covered them each with a blanket and kissed them goodnight.
Two, not a single thing had gone amiss with his powers in two days. That could only mean that something big was coming.
“Sure,” he repeated more firmly.
“Watson,” Sally Donovan said as he entered the common room. He’d made Sherlock wait in the nearest corridor. Part of him hoped he would get bored and leave. A frighteningly large part of him worried that he would.
The shop was just as chaotic as Sherlock had expected. Most of the team had gone home to wash and have dinner with their families, but those that came filled every available table. Molly sat in the corner, bewildered as to how she’d been dragged into this. Sherlock sat next to her, and John across from them, holding a plain vanilla cone with non-magical flake. He hadn’t yet started eating it, but was talking animatedly to the two of them, only responding to his team when they directly addressed him.
freezing in here," John said in greeting as he pecked Sherlock on the cheek.
"What?"
“What are we doing?”
26 Dec--Chapter 20
Of course, Sherlock saw right through that. "Oh, John, don't
"Not in pain?"
"You know," Mr. Holmes said, "I think dinner at Angelo's is a great idea." Unbeknownst to both Sherlock and John, their parents had been planning on dinner together, and there was no doubt that Angelo would be accommodating to the plan stirring in Siger's head.
Sherlock dragged him over to choose a song.
Sherlock turned away to see if his mother was coming back, and John burst into fresh laughter. "What?"
“Right.”
“Not your housekeeper,” she muttered, following them.
. She did a great job illustrating the
When John had suggested a picnic, Sherlock hadn’t realized he’d meant right at that moment.
?” John asked, astonished.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment, shocked. Then, just as suddenly as if they’d been struck by lightning, they were both laughing airily, unaware of the giggles from some nearby girls who had watched them from the moment John had sat down.
John's face went red, but he stood and held his hand out for Sherlock. "I dunno when Moran'll be back, but all the rest have said they won't be in 'til late."
"Hello?"
Wilkes didn't seem to know who he actually was, and clearly took him for an actual authority figure. "None, sir."
John propped himself up enough to turn Sherlock's head and kiss him deeply. "Yes. I do. God, yes. You have no idea how long I've wanted to."
"You don't have to."
“No, Sherlock, I…”
“Right. Because I’m not putting my mouth anywhere near that stuff.”
"Hmm?"
“Now, Sherlock, we’ve got to get to the car somehow.”
"Just left him."
As soon as Greg and his wife finally made it out of the house, Sherlock was sitting on the floor among blocks and dolls and toy trucks, the girls sat across from him, bouncing excitedly. He rolled one of the trucks over to Amelia, who squealed with glee when it bumped gently against her knee.
“Pick something, on me.”
“Well, sure, once Wendy left. I told you the rest of them were tolerable.”
Sherlock stared at him suspiciously. "You've got work."
“Thank you, but it’s hardly my doing. My boys make their own way well enough.”
“Wait, what?” John said, panicked at Sherlock’s tone.
"Can't hurt," John repeated.
Sherlock squinted, thinking. “Yes. Fine. You win.”
John looked over to the Ravenclaws and caught sight of Stamford, looking slightly uncomfortable next to none other than John’s carriagemate from earlier that evening, Sherlock Holmes. Holmes himself was simply sitting as one might have in a particularly boring class, leaning on his elbow and twirling his wand in his other hand. John stared. He had never seen anyone show that little interest in the Sorting, not since--well, not since his own Sorting, when Holmes had actually walked up to the stool
“Bond Street.”
“Who? Your parents?”
John stared at him. "I--I didn't know you wanted to."
3.  If you haven't noticed,
John indicated the doorway with a nod in its direction. "Dance with me?"
“Well, it’s only a few days away. And that way we don’t have to bother with gifts twice in one week.”
“Why would I ever do that? I would never do that.”
"Yes, I remember."
The next time John saw Sarah was when she told him it wasn’t going to work out between them.
John eventually also caught on to which presents had been wrapped by their father and which had been wrapped by their mother, for both boys seemed to have a much more difficult time deducing those that their mother had wrapped; more than once, John saw Sherlock practically throw his hands up in frustration before giving up and tearing the paper away. With John thrown into the mix, it seemed a nice change for Mr. Holmes to have wrapped presents that would actually be a surprise. His wife, it seemed, took this into account—significantly more of John’s gifts were wrapped by Sherlock’s father than were wrapped by his mother.
John soon found he was struggling between the impulse to study Sherlock closely and the desire not to seem too eager, so he was grateful when Sherlock backed away and waded into the pool.
Sherlock pressed against John, wriggling in his grasp and creating as much friction as he could for the erection that pressed back.
John tried and failed to imagine Moran with that maniac Moriarty in the way that Sherlock implied. Perhaps because he didn't actually want to imagine it; there were far more pleasant things to do when lying next to Sherlock Holmes than imagining a pair of psychopaths going at it in some dark corner of the castle. So John turned his attention back to his boyfriend and used the extra space that Sherlock had commandeered on his side of the bed to his advantage, throwing a leg over to straddle his thighs.
"Of course. There's no fooling you, John Watson."
“No. Are you?”
He was down to his pants by the time he felt Sherlock behind him, kissing the back of his neck, snaking his arms around John’s waist, and already completely naked.
He'd been trying for several minutes, over the course of which Sherlock had become more and more frustrated with his low skill level. They were lucky the group continued to play waltz after waltz, although John suspected Sherlock may have bewitched their instruments when he wasn't looking.
“I just wanted to wish you good luck. Not that it matters, as luck is a completely false idea used to socially justify success and excuse failure.”
“What for?”
“Is it?” Mrs. Holmes turned to John. “Well, we’ll have to have a special dinner then, too, won’t we? What’s your favourite dish, dear?”
“If the whole of Ravenclaw House are idiots, I’d hate to know what that makes me.”
Sherlock paused again, then looked fully at John for the first time since the bomb had been revealed. “You all right?” he asked softly. If John didn’t know better, he would’ve said there was something like concern littering his tone.
“To be fair, I kissed you first.”
Eventually, John sighed. “I suppose I should go back and apologise.”
Sherlock took John by the hand and led him back down to the den. “You know we don’t have a king.”
Sherlock smiled tightly at an unexpectedly chubby uncle as he made his way to the dining room with a curt nod. As a young man passed, Sherlock grinned more genuinely than John would have thought possible in anyone’s presence but his before being taken up into a hearty embrace, which he miraculously returned, although with much less fervor.
my hair long. And so do you."
," John gasped, and when his hips ground against Sherlock's backside, Sherlock realized he was still asleep.
"Good."
"Tell that to the rest of the building."
John furrowed his brow and decided to try and sleep. Which was nearly impossible, knowing that Sherlock wasn’t acting like a prat for the benefit of everyone at home. When he did sleep, it was fitful, and he awoke the next morning with the taste of a forgotten nightmare still on his lips.
sort of Prefect to answer to, and I’m certainly not answering to my brother.”
"I can tell."
John laughed bitterly, cutting her off. “Oh, please, this has nothing to do with what school he goes to. In fact, Hogwarts is the best school of wizardry there is, and you’re an idiot for sending your children anywhere else. No, this is about your son being a bully and you letting him get away with it.”
"Fair point."
“What, being sixteen? As opposed to yesterday, when I was fifteen?”
"Oh, is that so? Then what're you doing out with a man who looks like he could be your father?"
Suddenly, he heard Sherlock’s voice, calling out for his adversary, and the silky Irish lilt murmured in his ear, “Go get him, darling. It’s showtime.” John stepped from his hiding place, a plan already forming in his mind. He blinked rapidly, willing Sherlock to get the message, praying that he hadn’t gone and “deleted” Morse.
“Welcome to Westpark. Finding your way around alright?”
“Aren’t you gonna try it, nappy-head?” Harry sneered.
"Just a little longer."
“Not a chance.”
When they entered the old flat, John actually took a step back at the mess. It was more cluttered than ever before, with a layer of dust in places that Mrs. Hudson clearly hadn't been able to reach for months.
"No I'm not," Sherlock replied too quickly, snapping his eyes forward.
. We’re dropping the subject.”
John absently stroked Sherlock's hair with one hand, tucking a bit of it behind his ear to expose the highest point of his cheekbone. He let the pads of his fingers tap lightly and rhythmically against it, pausing every few taps to run the length of it gently, letting himself enjoy the smooth skin of Sherlock's face in a way he wasn't used to. Usually he was under Sherlock's gaze, held by an intense stare of some kind, whether it was the calculating look of a great mind trying to solve a puzzle or one of those softly passionate stares that only John seemed to truly recognize for what they were. But now, with Sherlock focused so intently on the movie, John was able to appreciate his face in new ways, without being distracted by the intensity of his eyes.
, he thought, but he kept his mouth shut.
He knelt down to rummage in his trunk. It was a while before he resurfaced, a vial of clear liquid in hand and a suspicious look on his face. "Sherlock, what's this?"
“It definitely is not okay, John! You’re sixteen years old, you’re not supposed to age backwards. Of course this would happen. Of
“Do you want to get your trunk?”
“Isn’t this nice?” John mumbled into Sherlock’s hair.
"Sherlock?" John said, alarmed to find him losing consciousness. Carefully, he lifted him and carried him the few blocks to his flat, never once stopping, even when Sherlock woke and started slurring through deductions on where he'd been for the past year. Not even when his shoulder began to ache so badly that he thought it would give out completely.
By the time his forearms rested on either side of John's head and his hips lay slotted along John's, he was panting into John's mouth. "Simple," he said breathlessly. "Two can play at the domination game."
"I thought you were tired from your big day of essay-writing."
“What’s this?” his flatmate hissed, turning his laptop for John to see.
" He was laughing so hard, he almost fell out of his chair.
“Better. And it would keep in that direction if he didn’t keep insisting on walking everywhere. He won’t take a cab. It’s been a week and he’s still limping around London.”
He turned and saw the small woman on the landing behind him. “Sorry, Professor. I was just...taking a walk.”
"So you were skiving off."
He'd known going to uni was supposed to be an exciting time, but while the other students were busy getting acclimated with their surroundings and "forging lasting friendships" (when the dean had used that exact phrase at orientation, Sherlock had rolled his eyes), he shut himself up in his dorm, sometimes doing experiments in the corner he'd set up on his side of the room with beakers and flasks and
"And you sabotage all of his girlfriends."
"Mum, no!" Sherlock shouted after her, but she was already gone.
“Good idea.”
“Is that really as quickly as you can move?”
"Then what constitutes a
"John," Sherlock whispered, pushing him away and breathing heavily.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock deadpanned.
“Have fun!” she sang after him.
"Sherlock, maybe we

stares. I wouldn't put it past him to hack CCTV to spy on our dates."
Harry sighed. “You know, perhaps it’s not the best time to mention it, but I’m staying at Clara’s over Christmas.”
," John pointed out.
“I guessed as much,” Sherlock muttered, closing his eyes in impatience.
Mycroft sighed deeply.
John backed away from his sister and turned to the ladder up to the monkey bars. Without another word, he defiantly climbed it, grabbed onto the first crossbar, swung forward, and promptly fell on his behind.
John held up a finger, and Sherlock realized he’d been rambling, helplessly falling into a panic that he couldn’t fully explain. “Sherlock,” John said suddenly, and their eyes met. “That’s not—I wasn’t…” He sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, the way he always did when something was bothering him. “Sherlock, I didn’t expect things to go any further than a really good snog.”
"It's not like it matters, being mistaken for a female."
“Is that Amortentia I smell?” John put his bag down on the table next to Sherlock’s cauldron and leaned into his shoulder.
“Experiments!” Wilson supplied.
Wendy and her family walked past, and John made good on his promise to himself. “You got a boyfriend by being brilliant.”
"Yes, thank you, Mike," John replied, also breathing heavily. Sherlock was much too busy burying his face against John's neck, feeling his healthy, strong pulse, to even nod.
“Then which one?”
"Not alive, and not real, certainly, but a very good semblance of reality. You might think one of these things was sentient. But then"--he pulled the leg suddenly from the frog, which didn't react in the slightest to having a limb pulled from its body--"we mustn't forget that it's just chocolate." He popped the leg into his mouth. "John, you're staring."
“For—I don’t know, ruining dinner.”
"Sherlock? Sherlock, are you alright?"
At the sight of Sherlock’s watery smile, Mrs. Holmes nudged her husband, who raised his eyebrows and blinked.
Sherlock squeezed his hand indignantly. "Well, Mr. Zookeeper, what changed your mind?"
He was a few minutes late to the match, but Sherlock easily found Molly seated by herself, shivering in a black dress that was much too short to be wearing in January, and much too formal to be wearing to a rugby match.
"Really, John?"
It was at that moment that Sherlock Holmes himself decided to take a seat next to John, who nearly choked on his pumpkin juice. “Bloody hell, Sherlock, what are you doing here?” John was all too aware of the stares.
It was Harry who caught up with him after school as he trudged towards his father's car. "What happened on the playground today?" she demanded without preamble.
"That was
“Forget it.”
Sherlock smiled the most dazzling smile John had ever seen.
John wanted to follow, but how could he with Harry there? “Harry, I...I don’t feel well. I’m going to go lie down.”
On his way to dinner, he found Sherlock waiting at the entrance to the dungeons and stopped. “Sherlock?”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Mrs. Holmes laughed. “You’re a warlock.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Oh, not this again. Look, am I alive?" He waved his hands around.
And God, did John crave it. If John had to pin down one thing about Sherlock that he loved most, it would be his utter disgust for conforming to those around him, even his own family. He somehow stood out from them, not aloof like Mycroft or his grandmother, not kind and relaxed like his father or Wilson, not even leaderly and proud like his mother or aunt. It was as though he had forged himself from their best qualities and formed a new type of Holmes—a new type of human being—with the help of their influence. And John could very well say that he would continue to love the Sherlock that Sherlock had created, if not simply because he loves the creation, then because the creation was Sherlock’s, and Sherlock could do no wrong. At least, not majorly wrong.
Sherlock didn’t like to think about that night, but he knew that John had a point. He also knew that if he were to immerse himself in a case of this magnitude, the little time he did spend with John would be lost.
Sherlock's mother had come up with the plan for them to come in from opposite sides of the congregation. He took her arm and let her lead him as the music swelled.
John couldn't find words. He just sat with a strange smile on his face, brow furrowed, trying to figure out where this conversation was going and worrying vaguely whether he'd fallen in love with a sociopath. "It's nothing."
"I...I didn't. He just...he was..." Sherlock took a deep breath and held it for a moment, before letting it out in one big
"You can keep going while...while I catch my breath, you know," Sherlock pointed out.
"Yes, and I quite enjoyed it, as frustrating as it was."
John couldn't keep the incredulous grin off his face. "Wilkes, I'm
A few moments later, Sherlock went slack in John's arms.
"I...I do, too."
friends.”
"I beg to differ."
They walked to their destination, and John was completely baffled as to where they might be headed. He had been frustrated when they'd reached the street and Sherlock had turned to walk instead of hailing a cab, because it meant that he could be kept in the dark a bit longer without Sherlock having to tell a cabbie where to go.
Sherlock never

“Understood. Although I don’t think it’ll be anything you’d find too objectionable.”
“And he just
"What, am I a drug?"
Sherlock stopped. "What makes you say that? That's not what I was suggesting at all." He realized a bit late that he was speaking very quickly.
Concern. Again. Sherlock smiled bitterly. Then he laughed. He laughed and laughed. It wasn't a pleasant sound, even to his own ears.
He cleared his throat again. "Erm...well, I hope so."
John was excited, which was to be expected. Rather than annoying, as Sherlock normally found others' excitement over trifling events, he found John's commitment to Y2K celebrations endearing. He'd made a list of resolutions, and although John was more disciplined than most, Sherlock had a wager with Molly that they would only last to the 6th, when Sherlock's birthday celebrations would put an end to the ridiculous attempt to eat healthier when Mrs. Hudson came round with some of her mince pies.
"What?" John demanded, whipping around to face him.
“In certain situations, maybe. But no, not for dinner with your parents,” John conceded. He turned off the water and reached for a towel. “Um, Sherlock.”
Sherlock's head whipped around. "No. Of course not."
“Mind you, I wouldn’t doubt it,” Sherlock’s uncle put in from Sherlock’s left, picking up right where Aunt Wendy had left off. After more than a few drinks, the man had opened right up. It was all John could do to keep a straight face as the beginnings of his sentences began to slur a bit. “Your mother,” he went on conspiratorially to Sherlock, “was the best in the class. Helped your father out from time to time, he was rubbish at Charms.”
John glared at him. “Excuse me?”
When the song started, Sherlock's slurring and lisping contrasted comically with the gravelly level of his voice. "
Sherlock: 20
He shrugged.
He heard his name from somewhere below—probably Lestrade calling for some sort of emergency time-out due to one of his team being aflame. When John looked down, however, he found himself hovering about fifteen feet over a sea of generally neutrally-dressed Ravenclaws.
"Sure."
“You aged backwards at an accelerated rate.”
Had he been there by his side, Sherlock would have chided him for his politeness. John was suddenly struck with an image of Sherlock at his house, with all of Aunt Edith’s pointless collections which filled locked rooms, armed with his lock-picking contraption. He snorted. It was very unlikely that Sherlock and Aunt Edith would get along very well.
“No time to explain. Lestrade, tell McGonagall. She won’t listen to me after the…incident last year.”
“Ah, fuck. Sherlock... I’ve wanted you for so long.”
He is utterly, irrevocably in love with John Watson.
I fade to black before describing putting in sutures, though, because... no thanks.
I think I've hit a little bit of a stride with writing? That being said, I know there are probably changes in tense or weird typos.
“Sherlock?" Confused and mildly alarmed blue eyes survey his tall, disheveled flatmate. And, when Sherlock doesn't appear to be physically injured: "What's happened?"
(See the end of the chapter for
As if a cruel universe heard his thoughts, from the moment he arrives at work to the time he opens up the door to fall back into 221B, he is miserable. There was a steady stream of figurative fires to be put out, both clinical and administrative – he wasn’t even finished with all the typical paperwork of the day when he left because of all the other random but urgent nonsense that had cropped up. The relief of leaving for the day was cut off painfully by the heavy downpour of rain, which led to the tube being an uncomfortably humid press of bodies, and his walk from the station left him soaked through as it was too blustery to use his umbrella properly.
There’s a pause, and then. “Mm yes. Sort of.”
“Say it again.” John’s voice is thick and wobbles a little.
Sherlock had hoovered.
There is nothing quite like adrenaline on an empty stomach to wake a body up. Your nerves are all alive and tingling. You can feel the warmth from the hob and the chill of the lino beneath your bare feet, and every hair stands on end with goosepimples at the contrast. Is this what it is meant to feel like? Or is a heady combination of brain chemicals? Both? In whatever case, it is electrifying.
Aaaah! 30 Kudos!? I feel spoiled.
It was one of
The next morning, John has a shift at the clinic. As he putters through is morning routine, he is still smiling. Maybe he needs a holiday, if a handful of hours out of the flat had made him feel this good. Maybe he’s been more stressed than he had realized.
It doesn’t take long for the contact to become heated again. John pushes forward as to be partially on top of you, sliding his hand up to your shoulder blade and back down over your lower back, hip and thigh until he hooks his fingers around your knee and pulls it over his hip.
