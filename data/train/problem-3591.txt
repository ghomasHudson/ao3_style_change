Buck parked his jeep outside the hospital, the back filled with party decorations and banners along with a tablecloth, plates and utensils everyone could use. He stopped by the hospital to pick up whatever Cas and Alex had been assigned in getting, plus their gifts for Dean.
“We are going to tell you a secret, but you need to swear you won’t say a word.” Eddie says as he crosses his arms over his chest, leaning into the lockers.
“It’s just a weird day Dean. It isn’t anything to be worried about.” Bobby tries to reason. Dean wants to argue, wants to dig up information but he doesn’t know what he’d be digging for.
Chimney finally arrived at the firehouse, exhausted from worrying about the baby and Maddie. He heads to his locker to get changed before he gets ambushed by Hen and Eddie. “Good afternoon to you too guys.” He says with suspicion in his tone. “Am I missing something?”
The team responded to a vehicle collision involving a car colliding with the house. It was intense, but unfortunately, not the craziest thing they’ve ever seen. Bobby huffed, trying to think quickly what could the plan be in order to make sure no one's life is lost today.
“Mad?” Dean asked, confused. “Cas, why would I be mad at you?” Cas shook his head, dropping his gaze to the floor again.
“Dean…”
“And, you need to not make it obvious that it’s a secret.” Hen joins. Chimney backs away with his hands up as if he were surrendering.
Castiel shrinks, slumping his shoulders in embarrassment as a small tint of pink covers his cheeks. Dean lets out an airy chuckle, wincing at the pain in his ribs. “They’re beautiful.” The angel meets his human’s gaze once again, a fondness filling his eyes as he looked into Dean’s. searching for a sign he was saying it just to make him feel better, but he saw nothing but love and adoration. Castiel’s eyebrows furrowed, tilting his head sideways as he let Dean’s words sink in.
Jack is 12 years old, barely getting the hang of middle school and often tutored by his surrogate mother — or “Aunt Kelly” after school lets out. Claire is 17, in high school, and trying to figure out what she’s going to do with her life afterwards.
“You sure?” Castiel nodded and closed his eyes, hoping it wouldn’t be painful, but when he felt the first touch...all that worry just seemed to vanish. Dean softly ran his fingers over every curve and folded feather, a smile on his face as he felt how soft it felt. He was careful not to touch the feathers so roughly, fearing that they would fall and Cas would hide his wings. Dean walked to the other side, doing the exact same — feeling every curve and folded feather that his fingers came in contact with. Meanwhile, Castiel’s eyes were filled with tears. Not that he was in pain; he had become overwhelmed with the feeling he got when he felt a human touch to the broken part of his celestial being. The act wasn’t at all intimate. Dean stepped in front of the angel, a smile of adortion quickly faded when he saw the tears in the blue of the angel’s eyes. “Did I hurt you?”
“I love you. I love you so much.” Dean said breathlessly as he pulled away, still holding the angel’s face.
“Seriously?!” She shouts on accident, earning a few stares from her coworkers and some patients. “Damn it.” They both stayed silent, thinking of ways they could better hide this whole surprise for the next two days.
“Chimney, when the car lifts, you start up with the jaws.” Bobby says into the radio.
“Alright, Chim, Hen, check on the driver and make sure the car is stabilized. Eddie, go with them and disable the airbags.” All three firefighters nodded and headed out to their assigned places. “Dean, Buck, I need you guys to carefully check out the house for any residence. There’s probably a few gas lines that busted so take precaution.”
, I can't take any risks.”
“See what happens when men bicker?” Hen shouts as she drops her food on the table. A playful smirk cracking at her gloss covered lips. Dean and Eddie mock her before everyone rushes downstairs and into the assigned places.
“I get it, growing up without a good father, it becomes a fear that you can become like them once you have your own kids.” Dean says. Hen sits in the ambulance and listens, this was how they were. Having deep conversations at the weirdest times, her, Dean and Chimney.
Because he lost him, and he couldn't save him.
”You think so?” The angel nodded, reaching out a hand for Dean to take. Castiel scooted himself over for Dean to climb in next to him as he did a few hours before. The both of them got settled, a comfortable silence falling between them. “Did you actually like it or were you just being nice?” Dean asked, still unsure of his new talent. Cas smiled as his hand traced Dean’s jaw down to his neck then his collarbone.
Bobby prepared the firehouse’s breakfast for that morning, making sure they all had the same amount of everything. Buck and Chimney walk up the stairs, eyeing the food as if it was their last meal. Soon, they would be followed by Hen and Eddie along with the rest of the fire house. “Oh, God Bless you and your cooking skills Bobby.” Buck praises as he eats the food.
Cas rushed through the halls of the hospital, hearing that a firefighter from the 118 was brought in. “Excuse me, sorry.” Cas carefully pushes through the nurses and other doctors before his blue eyes catch a glimpse of a nurse checking on a dirty, slightly cut up firefighter in one of the rooms. He sighed, seeing that Dean was still in pretty good shape. “S’cuse me, I got it from here Danny.” Dean’s eyes widen at the sound of Cas speaking.
“I love you too Henrietta.” He laughs, waving at the rest of the team and they looked at him with relief and like they wanted to throw something at him. “Don’t tell my boyfriend about this. I only need one lecture today.”
“Again? Jesus how long have you been planning this thing?” Neither Hen or Eddie answered that question, they just waited for Chimney to give in and join on the plan for their friend. “Fine, but don’t count on me too hard. Dean is scary.”
“Are you sure? I don’t-”
“She’s older.” Jack lets out another whine and stomps out the front door.
“No.” Dean swatted Cas’s hand away and looked down at him, anger and worry clearly written into every inch of his face. “You’ll die if you use anymore, and Cas...man, I don’t think I can go through that again.”
“Ha ha, very funny.” Dean turned around to face Cas who was standing at the doors of the barn. He bit the inside of his cheek as the memory came flooding back to his mind. The memory of Castiel — Angel of The Lord walking into this barn in the most dramatic way possible. “You were so dramatic with your entrance man. Breaking down the barn, putting Bobby to sleep.” Cas stepped forward a bit, his hands in the pockets of his trench coat and a smirk playing at his lips.
“Of course, uh,” Cas takes the gift and turns around seeing his two other friends. “Oh! Jody, this is Maddie and Buck. Dean’s friends.” Maddie walks towards Jody holding out her hand to shake.
“Hey, a man’s gotta eat.” Bobby chuckles and puts his hands on his hips.
“What was that?” Cas asked, earning a smile from the Winchester.
Dean hesitated to speak, noticing the feather against Castiel’s chest and the tears running down his stubble covered cheeks and onto his black slacks. “I-It’s the only thing I have left from…” Cas starts quietly, his voice breaking. Dean didn’t say anything, he didn’t know what to say. Instead he wrapped an arm around Cas, pulling him to his chest then furrowing an eyebrow when he felt the former angel stiffen up at his touch. Dean let go, letting Cas resume to his previous position and looked at him, waiting for him to speak. “You’re not mad at me?” He asked as he looked into Dean’s worried green eyes.
“Yeah, just blasts from the past I guess. Nothing to worry about.” Dean shrugs the weird feeling off his shoulders, not really in the mood to talk about his past. It’s not that he didn’t trust his team, he just believed that the past should stay as is. Everyone’s moved on, why bother...right? “Anyway, what’s for dinner today Cap?”
Dean has been living in LA for nearly 3 years. Been a firefighter at the 118 for 2 — his first year he was in his probation period of his duties.
“Yeah, Cas took Jack to school today so,” Dean takes a bite of his food. “Kelly’s gonna pick him up and Claire is going with a friend. They’ll be occupied for the afternoon.”
“What was your father like, Dean?” He chuckles at the question.
“He was a kid, Cas. I wasn’t gonna leave him alone.” Cas wants to be selfish, wants to argue that Dean should have been thinking about himself, but understands the sacrifice. “I thought of Jack.” Dean says quietly. He really didn’t want to cry, but the look in that poor boy's eyes was gonna stick with him for a while. “Remember? When Jack split his head open and he asked if he was gonna die?”
“Yes.” Dean’s eyes went wide. Cas not sure if he was doing this right. “Am I doing this correctly?” Dean chuckled, blinking a few tears away. “I’ve seen movies where couples…”
“You’re adopted?” Dean looks up at her, thinking to himself if it was a good idea to let her in at this time — at work. He just does what his heart tells him to, his head is never always correct.
“Guys, I could have fallen off the tree.” Dean says, a bit annoyed, but also wanting to laugh at his own misery too.
“Look, we all don’t know Dean’s past. We don’t know for certain as to why he doesn’t like to celebrate his birthday, but he’s made a family here. With his boyfriend and his kids, to his little brother and his wife, to us. This,” Bobby circles his arms to motion at the entire house. “This is what Dean made on his own. He put his life in our hands and he trusts us enough to know that it won’t be taken, because we take care of him.” Everyone sits and watches Bobby move from behind the kitchen counter to in front of it and standing over the firefighters. “We are his family. He came here for a fresh start, celebrating his birthday is going to be the missing piece in his puzzle.”
“Especially when he couldn’t stop sneezing.” Hen adds, a smile so big that there were crinkles appeared near her eyes.
“You’d be surprised.” Cas chimes in, an unamused look plastered on his face. Alex presses her lips together to suppress her laugh. “That’s a good plan, good job.” Buck bites his lower lip and looks back towards the young nurse knowing she seemed unphased by the idea.
“Samantha...but I call her Sammy.” Dean smiles again, his little brother coming to mind when he nears the name. He makes sure Andy is covered well, and that he’d be safe from getting any debris on him.
“Just so you know, you all are terrible liars.”
“Lift the car.” Dean says. Buck furrows his eyebrows and walks back over to Dean. “Lift the car, I can try and pull this kid out as fast as I can, then you can use the jaws to cut the driver out.” Buck looked back at everyone else, they had no protests on it.
. That was his mission after all, to protect Dean Winchester. And yet...he failed.
“Perfect.” She gives a thumbs up to both of them. “Buck, where are the gifts?”
“How are we supposed to keep this from him?” Buck asks, nibbling the skin on his finger.
“Dean trying to get the cat down from a tree was pretty funny.” Eddie says, trying to lighten up the tension in the truck. Everyone started to chuckle.
ever since Dean showed up. Everyone that met him just liked the guy; him leaving would take such a huge toll on everyone.
“Take one for the team Dee.” Eddie chimes in with a smug smile. “I would, but I got a kid at home.” Dean makes a fake offended expression, his hand flying to his chest in disbelief.
“Andy.” He replies, voice weak and eyes getting heavy.
“Are you out of your mind?” Cas whispers harshly. Dean wants to attempt to stand up, but also doesn’t want to make matters worse — so he puts his hands up instead. “And if you hadn’t moved out of the way in time?”
“Dee, I’m on my wa- fuck!” Buck screams as he watches the front of the house collapse onto the car and onto the ground.
“Shut up Jack!” Claire punches her little brother’s arm resulting in a loud ‘ow’ from him.
it.” Castiel said sincerely. Dean caught his hand, enveloping it within his own and bringing it up to place small, soft kisses to his fingers and knuckles. His eyes never leaving the blue of the angel that lay right in front of him.
“No, the front of the car is inside the wall. Cutting it is putting more weight to the front and it’s crushing the kid.”
feather. He had kept it around; unsure if it was to torture himself with the memory of who he was before, or just because he didn’t want to believe that he wasn’t an angel anymore. The heavy weight that crushed his chest became nearly unbearable for him. Tears building up in his broken blue eyes; his body falling apart. Cas brings the feather to his chest, holding it tightly without caring if he bent it or disheveled it. He missed who he was, what his father created him to be — but he was scared. Scared that Dean will realize that he’s just a deadweight, that he’s no longer of use to him and his brother and will ask him to leave. These thoughts ran a hundred miles per second in Castiel’s mind, not feeling how much tears were running down his face, how tightly he was holding onto his feather.
"It's okay Jack."
“Athena’s coming over after her shift to cook for us, so surprise dinner.” Bobby says before he walks up the stairs to the kitchen, leaving Dean and Hen on the main floor.
“You two have fun then.”
“Dean is the least intimidating person in this house.” Hen argues in a playful tone.
Dean looks around at everyone else and is still smiling, genuinely. Feeling...free. “Let’s get this party started then huh?” He shouts and everyone cheers again.
“Go through...?...oh.” Castiel sighed and Dean cleared his throat. “I’m sorry.” A chuckle escaped Dean’s lips and he dropped his head making Cas furrow his brows in confusion. “What?”
“You sure?” The nice nurse asks, Cas nods and offers a tight smile before she finally agrees and leaves the two men in the room. He shuts the door and slowly turns towards his boyfriend sitting on the hospital bed.
"Jack?" A voice called from the distance. Dean cautiously approached the celestial beings with his little brother following behind, his shoulders relaxing once they had broke the hug and looked at the relieved look on both of their faces. Sam had looked around the empty field as if he were trying to convince himself that everything was finally over. "Is it...did we..." Dean struggled to get a sentence out as the events that had just taken place started to settle in his mind.
“I’m sure.” Castiel gently placed his hands on Dean’s body, healing him, discomfort clearly on his face. Dean closed his eyes for a minute out of pain from his wounds slowly closing and bruises, broken bones slowly healing. The next moment that Dean opened his eyes, he saw Cas had turned pale and looked as bad as he did when he was running on borrowed grace.
“Okay, Einstein.” Alex rolls her eyes and grabs his arm to lead him towards Cas’s office.
"No your not a bad person Ryan you just reacted to a stressful situation in a physical manner, it's a very natural... a very human response. Here let me see" The Angel crouched to get to Ryan's level.
"Right" Shane snarled back.
"Put the tape the way you found it or so help me-" Dean's grip of the steering wheel became tighter and tighter until up you could see the white if his knuckles protruding from his skin.
"Besides Dean and I, we've had help from demons in the past" Cass informed Ryan remembering working with Crowley and Meg.
Shane and Ryan looked to each other trying to understand what Cass was talking about.
"The fuck I have. I know what I saw! Dude your eyes were yellow, what is going on around here?" Ryan demanded to know.
Cass squirmed uncomfortably on the spot "I suppose you could say that yes. If I'm being honest I find it difficult dealing with Shane's kind. It's built into me to dislike demons even if they aren't always bad" Castiel admitted, slightly ashamed to even acknowledge this inherited prejudice.
"I'm sure it was just the wind Ryan or your over active imagination again" Shane assured him.
Castiel looked furious and Dean started to panic as the situation was getting out of hand.
"Whoa, dude did you fucking run up there?" Ryan laughed at his speedy return.
"I will relish in this victory" Castiel smiled smugly. "Besides any establishment would be lucky to have you on staff Dean" He added lovingly.
The front door swung open and a tall man wearing a hoodie, a flannel and a jean jacket strolled into the foyer. He reminded Dean of a Russian nesting doll with all those layers. He didn't trust someone with that many layers on. Well apart from Cass, but he wasn't just anyone.
The three turned as they heard Ryan's footsteps from up the stairwell.
"Round here we call em revenants" The barman says while shining a pint glass with a rag.
"Wait you're "the Lord of the flies" Dean said looking puzzled, as Shane wasn't what he had imagined such a famous demon to look like. What kind of demon wears chinos? A hipster demon that's who, Dean shuddered at his own thought.
"That's a great idea" Shane replied "Maybe if we get Ryan drunk enough he'll stop being such a wuss.
"What my rude coworker meant to say was, isn't there another host?" Dean corrected through gritted teeth holding back the urge to grab Cass by the shoulders and ask him what the fuck he was doing. Talk about bad cop.
The tiresome eight hour car journey from Lebanon to St. Louis was speed along by the soundtrack of the impalas radio which Dean had switched on and turned up so it was blaring at full volume.
Dean stared at him, taken aback. He was aware it been been quite a while since they had enjoyed a night solely in each other's company, without something cropping up to ruin it. Whether it was a case Sam had just stumbled across or Jack seeking refuge from a particularly scary nightmare something always seemed to ruin their special moments together. Obviously Cass had noticed this also, since he was able to give such accurate information regarding their lack of special time as of late.
"Okay some of the ghouligans might have noticed a thing or two" Shane commented. "Smart cookies they are" He added with a sense of pride.
Dean was the first to open his peepers, since this wasn't anything new to him. "Thanks Cass" He told the Angel as he patted them on the shoulder in gratitude for his help.
"It's date night you dick" Dean erupted shouting at Castiel.
____________________________________________________________________
Could be this much fun
"What, you did!" Cass confirmed. "I'm just saying violence is a valid expression of intense emotion in stressful situations such as this"
"Cass of course I know him he's a legend, he was in the movie tombstone remember I made you watch it?" Dean tried to jog the Seraph's memory of the film.
Shane sighed heavily.
"That's not what I meant. Never mind why am I even humouring your idiocy" Cass spat back at him.
"Ryan I said I was sorry" Shane began to apologise again when suddenly the four were knocked down to the ground by four figures, flickering in and out of their perception like T.V static.
"Yeah he's a character from the hotdoga" Jack explained.
"No I'm not talking about urination. Dean there's a very strong demonic presence here that wasn't here earlier" Castiel retorted, as they bickered like the old married couple that they are.
"Oh yeah well so is-" the two disappeared into their room, their snarky conversation fading out of earshot.
"Do you have any music that isn't from before Ryan was born?" Shane began riffling through the glove box of the impala, looking at Dean's collection of classic rock cassettes.
"Shut the front door, there's not" The demon looked hyped for booze.
"Like pineapple on pizza wrong or human sacrifice wrong?" Dean joked playfully to mask his own concern.
"Wow Spooky isn't it" Dean gazed up at the Lemp Mansion in a state of awe.
If this reads weirdly please note that I was drunk when I wrote it hashtag living that Dean Winchester way of life lately.
"Sounds like it. Mike soup? That poor Guinea pig" Dean tutted, feeling sorry for the furball.
"No we lied" Castiel admitted. "Sorry"
Ryan seemed rightfully taken back but the Angel's abruptness.
"That truly isn't necessarily" Cass said, looking very uncomfortable from this gesture preformed by the gunslinger slash dentist.
"Now that was mean cassie! Wait oh my dad, lightbulb moment Dean's a bottom. Oh it all makes sense now that macho man front it's all a facade" Satan rubbed his face in his moment of realisation.
"Me? Oh I'm swell, just peachy" Ryan stated dryly, as he resisted the strong urge to roll his eyes to this statement.
"Well it's not captain tinkle pants at least" Dean concluded referring to Ryan. I  "He would have got stuck at the door by the Devils trap if he was a demon."
"HE" The box blurted.
"Do you believe us now?" Cass said, wings now back out of human perception.
"Jesus fucking Christ. Can we not once do a serious investigation" Ryan had his head in his hands.
"Yeah uh huh" Shane replied flatly placing the bags near the door with a grunt.
"How about fake identity, 'Steve' worked for me. I'm sure you could pull it off also considering you pretend to be a US Marshall or a Special Agent every day of the week " Cass assured him.
"Yeah" The ghost hunter replied.
It's hard to imagine that
"Dean, Cass this is my annoying co-host Shane" Ryan gestured lazily to the lanky man, still clearly angered with Shane's lack of enthusiasm in ghost hunting.
"Well credit card scams and hustling aren't very honourable ways of making a living" Cass declared with a judgemental gaze. Fuck he looked so sexy when he was angry Dean thought to himself. "Maybe that's where Jack got the idea to do it, we don't want to confuse him about right and wrong so early into his development" Cass accused Dean of being a not so stellar influence on their kid.
"Yeah it is and I wouldn't have had my life ruined if Azzael hadn't burned my mom on the ceiling now would I?" Dean snapped, getting heated.
"I know, Sam said that you have to clean out their poop everyday!" He said excitedly.
"There's supposed to be a portal to hell down here" Ryan said matter of factly, yet fear was still evident in his words.
"That thing was giving me a migrane" His co-host huffed.
"No Dean, although I can imagine the annoyance he must feel toward us for those reasons he's not the pranking type. He's playing on our side now, so I have faith that Michael must have sent us to this place for a reason" Cass reassured the hunter again.
"February" Cass said, confused about how that particular word had anything to do with Ryan.
Ryan didn't notice the little squirmish between the Angel and demon because he was staring down the dark hallway.
"So that thing, it was an actually ghost?" Ryan asked nervously.
Dean and Shane finally returned to the B&B and regrouped with Ryan and Cass in the front of the house.
"Dean, he sees a lot worse on hunts" Sam assured his brother.
"So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodbye" Shane began to sing, whilst waving at the dead bodies that were alight.
"Wait, wait who's Brent" Dean asked confused.
The shortest of them stuttered out "T-that's not possible-Y-your kind are long gone" as they stared at Castiel in utter disbelief, while the other two remaining demons were stunned in silence.
"I'll save you the journey bud" Shane flicked his wrist and the tomb was ajar. "Open sesame" He smiled widely.
Team free will had just finished up on a hunt and had finally got back to the bunker. It was nothing special just a vamps nest, a milk run as Dean had put it. It was good to be home they thought as they came in the front entrance and saw Jack waiting for them.
"Buzzfeed" Shane shot back straight away.
I'm gonna have another drink, fuck it" Ryan grabbed another bottle of beer and chugged til it was empty and reached for another.
"Great! See you two tomorrow over breakfast we can answer any of your pressing questions after I get my five hours. Night you two" Dean waved to Ryan and Shane as he headed up the stairs after swiping the keys to a suite from behind the front desk.
Shane frowned at that remark "You're my friend Ryan, why would I let you get hurt? Besides I'm not a crossroads demon I don't give a rats about souls"
"HELL" It spat.
"Yeah like literally hell" Ryan chuckled, taking another swig of his beer.
Dean swung the impala into the cemetery with the skill of a nascar driver and pulled up to where the Lemp family tomb was situated. He turned the car off and both he and the prince of hell in the passenger side exited the vehicle swiftly.
Ryan's brain hurt from all the crazy happenings of the day he couldn't wait to get his head onto that  pillow and nod off. Now if only life were that simple...
"Where did you and Ryan meet anyways?" Dean tried making small talk with the demon, to make the ride back to the Lemp house a little more bearable.
"Yeah listen to the old fool pretty boy" The black eyed monster mocked Dean.
Castiel was practically fuming "You were supposed to help us defeat the Darkness, not just sit back and watch security footage all day Lucifer" Cass snarled at him.
"Um guys does the red light mean the camera is on or off?" Castiel asked staring at the camera bewildered.
Heaven is a place
"You're right, I guess our lives are living nightmares" Dean said sadly. "I'm glad he's happy I am, but I hope he gets that a Guinea pig isn't an everyday thing. The bunker is not gonna become a petting zoo. Not over my dead body."
"Their just friends Dean" Castiel replied.
Castiel remembers the day he was sent to save the righteous man like it only happened yesterday. He still didn't know why his garrison has been enlisted to retrieve the Michael sword from hell. It made barely any sense really. If Michael wanted his vessel so bad why didn't he go get them himself? But he didn't. He probably said it would be easier to send expendable, lower-ranking Angels into that war zone than for the precious prince of heaven to go get a scratched up down in the pit. Whatever reason lead Castiel's garrison being chosen for the mission, he was so happy because of it. Hell was exactly what it said on the tin. The battle to get Dean out was long and harrowing. Castiel lost many of his soldiers just trying to get to Dean and many more when he actually had to return him to the Earth. When he finally got through the carnage with Dean in tow he had never felt more alive in all his days of existence. He made all the Angels know of his handy work when they returned to Earth when he proudly announced that "Dean Winchester is saved". Hester had said that when Castiel first laid a hand in Dean in hell he was lost but she had it all backwards. That was when he was saved. Dean may have been raised from perdition that day, but in reality it was Castiel who was saved. Dean thought him what it was to have free will, to choose your own path in life, to be loyal to those you care about and he loved him for it. He thought him how to love.
The barman and other demons seemed stunned, which gave them an advantage yet again, as this allowed for Castiel to get involved in the brawl. The trench-coated seraph sauntered over to the scene of the action and locked eyes with the remaining demons.
"This doesn't mean we believe your little sob story or trust you for that matter" Dean admitted.
"What can I say, I learned from the best" He said plonking next to him on the King size bed. "Sure I can whip something up as you say, I'll do that in the morning. This day has been quite eventful hasn't it" He added.
Nothing ever happens
Cass stood at the bottom of the stairwell pensively "Remember what I said Ryan. Goodnight Shane, Goodnight Ryan" He bid them farewell.
"1990" The demon responded immediately, knowing everything about his best friend like it was his civic duty.
"I still can't believe we're gonna be sleeping in a beer barons bed! Try saying that three times fast" Dean practically beamed at the king sized bed before him, a far cry from what he was used to slumbering on.
"Okay that was a rhetorical question, but Cass I'm flattened you've been counting the hours-" The hunters train of thought was cut off as Castiel grabbed him by the lapels of his jacket and kissed him passionately. The hunter took the initiative as he pulled the Angel closer, as they both began to undress frantically to engage in some hopefully uninterrupted special time at long last...
"Excuse me?" Dean furrowed his brow, which highlighted his newly forming crows feet. The majority of hunters don't live to even see forty so Dean was in the lucky minority somehow, despite the atrocities he had already faced during his existence.
To get to the bar
Dean struggled to open the tomb up and admitted his defeat. "I'll get something from the impala to bust this open" He turned to walk away but Shane stopped him in his tracks.
"It's all bogus Sam, it's edited in to get their hits up" Dean told him, covering up what was really going on.
It's hard to imagine
"We roughed them up a bit until they spilled the beans. It's all movie magic Sammy sorry to break it to ya" Dean lied.
"He's telling the truth" Dean backed him up.
"I'm here too Dean" Cass pointed out "All of this doesn't just rest on your shoulders you know that right?" He added sadness creeping into those big blue eyes.
"I didn't say that. Cass your plenty pretty, it's an expression" Dean stated feeling guilty for making his Angel feel bad.
"He prefers it" Dean said through gritted teeth.
"Strange bedfellows you keep Dean, that says a lot about a guy who he surrounds himself by. So for you that's Angels, demons and the actual God himself" Shane loomed over the hunter and Dean dug around in the trunk, making sure he had everything he needed to properly sent the Lemp's spirits to the other side.
Ryan was not impressed "Cut the crap Shane" He bellowed.
"You okay man?" Dean said trying to remain calm even though his heart was pounding heavily in his chest. Castiel wasn't a whimp, he was actually kind of a badass. Anything that made him worried made Dean feel terrified.
"Dean you know are good at spotting other people's lies? Liars" Shane smirked at him.
"They could get hurt Cass or worse dead if we don't give them the whole monsters are real talk" Dean replied.
"Bye Dean-Oh and tell Cass to check his bank account. He's not gonna be happy" Sam told him.
"What are you so afraid of?" Dean asked the demon.
"How many living women's bedrooms do you skulk around in at this hour of the night Ryan?" The demon joked.
Castiel's eyes grew wide. The Angel was a sucker for animals, he loved bees and cats but Guinea pigs were one of his favourite creatures. Jack apparently shared this trait with his chosen Dad.
"Well jokes on you Shane I'm still better than you at b-ball despite your abnormally long limbs" The smaller man boasted.
"Don't dude. I find out my best friends a demon and I'm supposed to just go 'fine' and move on" Ryan yelled.
"I'm sure he is a very nice fellow indeed but that doesn't account for how he killed those revenants" Doc replied, missing the earnestness of Dean's words.
"There's a brewery" Cass told Dean, knowing he was onto a winner with that little anecdote.
"Uhh I'm setting up some cameras bro, what does it look like" Shane answered innocently.
"Sunshine, you mean Jimmy Novak's credit card" Dean teased Castiel with a smirk plastered on his face.
"We all have our demons it seems...and I have been know as a bit of a gambler" The good looking  barman admitted with a sigh.
"Worked out fine for you Dean" Shane said pointedly to the hunter.
"That's what I thought. Anyway before that day, I didn't believe in ghosts. I thought it was all bullshit but what happened on that boat, it changed me" Ryan looked like he was having war flashbacks but then he snapped out of it.
"Yeah out there somewhere" He looked up and around at the dull night sky above them as if searching for a sign of the Devine Mister Shurley "Not that he gives a rats ass about any of us" He murmured angrily.
"You're The John Henry Holliday. The man the myth the legend?" Dean continued ignoring Cass's jab at him because this was just totally insane. Maybe Michael really is pulling a fast one on them he thought and instead of meeting Doctor sexy he's getting to meet Doc Holliday this time. He didn't really care if it was an angelic trick because he was getting to meet one of his favourite people in history.
"You're a real jokester when you wanna be" Dean raised his eyebrows.
Dean and Castiel looked accusingly at the demon.
"Is that-" Dean began to ask only for Ryan to interrupt him.
"So you think there's no chance your dick of a brother would have sent us here on purpose you know like payback for the 'hey-assbutting' and for leaving them in the cage for so long?" Dean pressed the Angel for a definite answer.
He rubbed his hand "Fuck that hurts Ryan whined.
Then Dean knew why Castiel had gone fully Jason Bourne on this guy's ass.
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
"Okay fine I'll whack out the spirt box if your just gonna be a dick" Ryan said.
A place where nothing
Shane grunted "That things the least scientific doohickey you've got and yet you still always wanna use it"
"Well this room is fucking eerie" Ryan shuddered as he took in his surroundings.
"No everything was fine" Castiel assured him that they had a perfectly normal time in the mansion whilst Dean and Shane were elsewhere.
"Exorcisms are for when demons are inhabiting a meat suit against someone's will. This dude died,  so the body was free real estate so to speak." He shrugged looking down at his body.
"Cass!" Dean shot him a side eye.
"It's times like this I really love my job" Shane said sipping from the brown bottle.
"Okay fair enough, ouch that was a low blow" Dean shrugged, slightly wounded by these words.
"Right well if you say so and if that flower really is around here we got to track it down stat. We're  on the clock remember? We've for twelve hours before the door closes" Dean prayed they were right. "Maybe we should ask around pry some of  the locals noggins for info huh?" The hunter suggested to Castiel.
Could be so exciting
"Shane you set up only one camera? Just one! In all that time. You're unbelievable man you know that" Ryan was visibly mad. He was like a tiny tea kettle about to explode. Adorable but kinda scary nonetheless.
"Yes, I think breaking someones nose would have an adverse effective on your hand" Cass stated rolling his eyes.
"No!" Cas and Dean shouted in sync raising their arms defensively. That little guy had spunk and they didn't want to be on the receiving end of his strong arms.
"Restaurant?" The word left Cass's lips which weren't being piloted by him.
"Maybe you're not as useless as you look" Dean shrugged more impressed than he would let on.
"Its true, fair enough then" Dean smiled to himself.
"No Dean you're somehow in perfect health, apart from your liver but that's not news to anyone" Cass informed him.
"Why? What do you need me for Mister famous hunter" The demon looked confused.
"That should do the trick if there is a demon in the joint. They're bound to end up trapped in one of those" Dean mused to himself.
The trio humoured their adopted son as they sat down and watched the odd happenings unfold on screen from the episode entitled "The Demonic Goatman's bridge"
"What a guy with a tiny bladder? It's cute you're concerned but that's a bit overly sympathetic man" Dean patronised Cass.
"How can you retire from being a demon" Dean quipped back at Shane ignoring how good of a pun that was.
Heaven
Everyone will leave
The pair continued their drive to Missouri accompanied by Deans mixtape that Cass had carefully shoved into the tape deck.
"It's exhuming a corpse, it's different" Dean assured them.
Dean lifted the rug to see their spray paint was gone "So that's what was taking you so long out there" he sighed, realising how much time they wasted spraying sigils when they could have been testing the product in the brewery instead.
"Your not my mother dude, heck I barely even know you" He waved the bottle towards Cass's face, but accidentally slammed his hand into the side of the chair.
"I wouldn't call civil wars nothing Cass" Dean replied recalling the turmoil that always seems to occur up in the silver city.
"Shane, we've got a problem" The ghost hunter looked pale.
"You sly dog" Dean muttered to himself.
"Holy water in a water gun? Yeah don't laugh at me, something legit is happening in this place and I want to get to the bottom of it. Also I called the company and they're getting us a replacement spirt box. You better glad it's not coming out if pocket after that shit you pulled" he pointed angerly at Shane who looked hurt by this tone.
Dean smirked quietly to himself and drove on. Occasionally he tapped his hands on the steering wheel in time with the different Led Zeppelin songs, feeling pretty confident that Cass didn't care about the music on the tape itself but the sentiment of receiving it from Dean. That made him happy beyond words.
"It sounded like people whispering, but no ones supposed to be down here after hours" The colour drained from Ryan face.
"My girlfriend" Shane replied.
"Ya, sure look Dean call me if anything weird happens alright?" Sam begged.
"Swallow a dictionary did you?" Cass squints at him.
"Like what" Dean literally couldn't think of a worse name than Mike Soup for a Guinea pig.
I probably started writing this in the worst time ever, I just started college and I have no free time anymore but I'll try and keep posting chapters of this when I can for anyone who cares-peace from an exhausted college girl.
"Yeah yeah, touché chief" Shane said brushing himself off.
Cass had gotten so excited about the Guinea pig he didn't realise he was holding the camera upsidedown.
Play it all night long
"You're a Winchester too Cass. Not by name sure, but a wise man once told me family don't end with blood." Dean said turning to look Cass in the eye to hammer the point home that he saw him as family, and everyone knows that nothing matters more to Dean Winchester than his family.
A place where nothing
Heaven
"See ya" Ryan replied and Shane nodded towards the hunter.
The demon in the passenger side turned his nose up at the driver's music selection.
Dean rolled his eyes tiredly "Cass remind me again what day is it?" He asked calmly.
"It's a coincidence man" the demon tried to play it off.
Dean didn't know how soup or hot dogs factored into a show about unsolved mysteries but he was too tired to keep digging.
-I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
"Has that ever happened before?" Cass asked, trying to restore calm to the situation.
"Anyway I'm going to sleep I'll see you tomorrow your highness, which will be Friday. Hope you understand how the days of the week work by then. Don't even try and come to bed because I'm still pissed at you. I'm whacking up a warding sigils in my room you can have the couch" Dean yelled as he tried to storm off dramatically, but his drunken legs weren't given him the best attempt at it.
“I am not dismissing your argument on relationships, but in this respect we are not normal people. Compatible sentinels and guides achieve a measure of union that is not possible to duplicate in the normal world. Believe me when I say that being together would be the only desirable end, and that once bonded neither of us would wish to be with someone else.”
Still smiling he heaves himself up and grabs the man’s arm to get him back on his feet too.  He dusts both himself and his captive down.  He grabs his own kerchief from around his neck and dips it in the stream.  He tries not to laugh as he wipes dust and dirt from the man’s face, but his efforts are not appreciated as the scowl intensifies making him look more and more like an angry ruffled cat.
Knocking. Dean mumbled and shifted, trying to retain his dream thread.  Louder knocking.  He grumbled and an uncoordinated arm groped out of the duvet nest to grab the clock.  5.43?  Who the fuck knocked on people’s doors at 5.43?  Actually, no, it wasn’t even that.  His clock was set ten minutes ahead, so he could lie in bed gently waking up instead of having to shoot out in a rumpled hardly coherent state every morning.  Some asshole was going to get himself torn a new one.  His sense of outrage spurred him to abandon the comforting warmth of the bed and propelled him to the door.
“Ok, dude, don’t ever call it that if you are actually hoping to get laid.”
“You are actually thinking of refusing? Are you fucking serious?”
“Is that what I’ve been doing?”
There isn’t much silence after that, and when there is it’s a comfortable one.
He waited until he was aware of nothing but the quiet of the night, then turned the key in the ignition and eased himself onto the road from his hiding place. He made the right turn into the Novak drive, lights still off, and slowly followed the gravelled path right up to the mansion. The clear night and the white track were enough for him to spot his prearranged hiding place easily and he slipped his baby in place.
She turned to him then with an anguished cry.
Dean was glad of the extra layer while he stood outside.  It was a beautiful fall morning, bright sunshine and cool air, multicoloured leaves swirling around his feet in the light breeze.  He quickly checked out his surroundings, but there was no one close except for their group, shuffling and grumbling about time wasting and false alarms.
The doctor’s words petered out as Dean grabbed the offered plate while Cas was still listening and therefore distracted, and dove into the pie with all the enthusiasm of a starving man. Awed yet horrified faces watched as Dean devoured the slice in a few heartbeats, his mutinous expression making it clear that no one had better interfere. He reached for the coffee while Cas was still staring and slurped noisily, just to be annoying.
Castiel tilts his head like he’s scrutinising Dean’s soul.
“I understand the town is looking for a school teacher.”
“Look, we’ve talked about this.  I get that you’re weirdly invested in my love life, but it’s
“It didn’t say” – Dean swallowed – “it didn’t mention there was a way to break it. Is there?”
He looked up.  Blue, so much blue.  It filled his vision, his mind.  The most amazing blue eyes were staring at him, in as much abject horror as his own.
He felt the gentle reassuring squeeze on his hand and when he gathered his cojones to look up, Castiel was leaning in closer, all earnest eyes – “I assure you, I’m screaming on the inside.”
a small community.
“I should warn you.  He’s a slippery customer, that one.  He might seem like just any other bumbling city slicker, but boy does he have the gift of the gab.  The stories he told me to get me on his side...” – Dean whistles in appreciation of the fantastic whoppers Castiel obviously has regaled him with.  Castiel watches his masterful performance from his imprisonment with a mix of annoyance and admiration.  Dean should have been an actor.
Dean turned round. He knew Martinez would ride with Cas, but they would have to remain at a discreet distance, so there was really no chance of him spotting them yet. Ania was turning onto the main road anyway, so the long drive was now hidden from sight. Didn’t stop him from yearning for a glimpse of their car though.
One coffee shop date led to a lunch date and tentatively they began to meet more often. Two weeks had passed since that confrontation, and though Dean was always reticent to talk about how he felt he seemed to be more at ease in Castiel’s company.
One of the men emerged from it with Ania’s mobile and her radio. Now there would be no way to communicate the situation. Dean tried in vain to catch Ania’s eye. He wanted her to know he didn’t blame her, but the distance now between them and the deployment of bodyguards around him made that impossible. He was hussled into the front car, hemmed in by two burly guys, and driven away to his new destination. He just hoped that damn chip was doing its job.
There were a few car trips to break up the monotony, scheduled in the hope that Crowley would make his move. No bites yet, but at least he got to see the outside world, albeit through tinted windows and accompanied by at least one agent. He was sure Crowley would spot the trap, and was starting to believe he might just give the whole thing up as too much trouble.
The words were barely out when Cas’ warm solid frame descended on his, soft lips silencing any further comments. Cas proceeded to drive Dean out of his mind with feather soft applications of said lips and a maddening teasing tongue to all the areas Dean had wished them to be, and some he had never dreamt of. He was very thorough in his explorations, and made up for any so called teasing with energy and enthusiasm.
, but still, damn rude).
“You are highly aroused.”
That seemed to make Cas relax a fraction. Dean got it. If he was sold off to some unknown sentinel, who knew if and when he could be found. Can’t rely on the cavalry to get you out of a scrape all the time. God knows how many guides had been sold off to dodgy sentinels and were never heard of again. But knowing which sentinel he was being targeted for would narrow the search.
He was sitting alone, tactfully left in peace by the other officers, when their activity began to fade away into silence. The short hairs at the nape of his neck rose and he shivered as he lifted his head, and found himself staring into Dean’s eyes. Dean could not possibly be sitting across from him, looking as surprised as Castiel, but whatever this was it felt real. Both mind and body were attuned to Dean, and this was no empty vision brought on by wishful thinking. Before he could utter a word, Dean reached out, his hands seemed to grasp Castiel’s, and a stronger jolt of connection passed through them that made them both gasp.
“Ok, out with it. What’s eating you?”
). He didn’t know where the safe was located, but if Dean had learnt anything about the rich was their serious lack of imagination and their pathological innate complacency. They didn’t actually expect anyone to get through the security.
“You see, that’s what I like about you. None of this kowtowing to sentinels. You’ve got attitude, kid, and I like my guide with a little spunk.”
“No, it was not punishment. And no, guides can eat whatever they like. Once sentinels are bonded, their senses become more balanced, so most of them can eat pretty much anything. Obviously this varies from person to person, just like with normal people. Some love spicy foods, some find them obnoxious. But once a guide is there to help the sentinel, there shouldn’t be any issues.”
Gabriel had kept quiet up to now, but Cas noticed that the indolent amusement he generally sported had given way to sharp interest.
They climbed to the first floor and wandered a short way down the corridor before MB2 stopped at an open door, resumed the at-ease-but-ready-to-tackle-you-to-the-ground posture all the goons here seemed to favour, and waited patiently for Dean to enter. As soon as Dean crossed the threshold, he heard the door close behind him and the sound of a lock. Well, he might as well explore though escape options seemed to be thin on the ground.
“Dude, I don’t have one. I’m good at what I do and I ain’t never been caught.”
“Let me see. Entitled spoilt brats. Does that about cover it?”
Dean must see the scowl on his face and misunderstands its significance.  “Yeah, seriously.  He’s not pining for me or anything, no matter what my father may have told the agency.”
He can barely hear the murmured – “And still does.”
The voice was jarring and getting louder. He had been aware of it peripherally for some time, but he hadn’t slept so deeply for a while and was loath to surface. Once he blocked out the annoying yammer he was aware of something else filtering through his senses, like a persistent whisper in his mind demanding attention. He still felt half asleep so at first it was hard to work out what was happening, but once he concentrated on it he felt ... open, like some indefinable barrier had been removed. That was enough to chase away any sleepy thoughts and he would have bolted upright there and then if some wary instinct hadn’t warned him to stay still.
Dean was well pleased. Small change to the Novaks, no doubt, but fifty thousand dollars would go a long way to help. It was just he and Sammy now, and he didn’t want this kind of life for him. Sammy had brains and a good future ahead of him. He zipped up the bag and tidied up after himself. Unless someone went to open the safe, they wouldn’t know anything was amiss. He hefted the bag, turned around and froze.
Sam put down his barely eaten burger with a disbelieving sigh. “How can you eat? I just....”
“Woah, no... I mean... never! I didn’t mean.. whatever you thought I meant!”
Dean snorts.  “Yeah, pleasure...” – he mumbles with a frown – “Look, you gotta realise that this was purely a business transaction between my father and Milton Sr.  Even Michael, I’m pretty sure, is not so secretly happy to be rid of me.”
“Oops. Awkward.” He then added with a cheeky grin. “Right, follow me. Cas is in the study.”
As soon as he was left alone, he tested these. If there were any way to escape, the grounds seemed a better option than going back through the house. Of course, no such luck. At first he ignored the door he came through in favour of the only other exit left, only to be greeted by two raised eyebrows attached to two muscled behemoths. As he made his way to the last door without much hope, it opened and Crowley emerged. He smiled the same smug little smirk that made Dean want to punch the guy’s lights out.
“Or maybe you drove me almost mad with your incessant yammering,” – he rolls his eyes and makes yapping motions with his hand – “pleading to be let go and then cussing me out when I took no notice.  Had to do it.”
*******
Even at his most love happy Dean found the seclusion grating on his nerves. Cas’ presence made the ordeal infinitely more manageable, but Dean had always been an independent outdoor kinda guy, and he missed that. On top of that, everyone was understandably on alert, and that kind of environment did not make for a relaxed atmosphere. So each day was a strange mix of boredom and anxiety.
“Dude, what the hell? That was not her fault!”
“You know, I’m almost sorry I won’t get to see you doing that kicking. It would have been bloody great.”
“I will ask that they imprison both of us until word comes back from the agency.”
He reopened the door with a strained smile and there was now a clipboard in the guy’s hands, and a little smirk to go with the eyebrows.
Dean smirked at Crowley’s profuse swearing. Whatever happened it was good to know he had at least thrown a spanner in the works. He could hear him talking to his goons, followed by sounds of activity. Then silence. He was beginning to dislike that ominous absence of sound. Crowley was up to something and he remained alert to any attempt to reach him. A few minutes passed, then Dean heard the unmistakeable sounds of a helicopter approaching. For one heart leaping moment, he thought the white hats had finally arrived, until he noticed there were no markings on the black copter. And a man at the door with ... a weird ass frikking
He settled back into the seat. Doubt and apprehension still lingered every time he stepped out of the house, notwithstanding all the contingency plans. So it was just as well he hadn’t had that coffee, or he’d be bouncing out of his seat. As it was, he kept turning round to check on their detail, though the road wound enough to make it difficult. He was about to ask Ania when he spotted it, and let out a sigh of relief. Just as he turned to the front, another familiar model was pulling up from the side of the road to forge ahead of them, except it simply stopped across their path, blocking their way. Instantly knowing something was wrong, Dean tensed, expecting Ania to swerve off the road and go round the blockade. But the car came to a stop. He looked to her and found tears running down her cheek.
It was surprising how dull a tense trip like that could get. Jammed between his jailors he could not even easily look out of the window, and there was nothing to engage his attention inside the car. He took stock of his situation, and reckoned it was still possible for the plan to work.
Dean seated himself and grabbed the menu, so he wouldn’t have to look at Castiel’s stupidly beautiful face. Peripherally he was aware that Castiel’s movements seemed uncertain, but then he also took a menu and immersed himself in it. Although it was obvious to both that neither was concentrating on the food on offer. Still, Dean was all for avoiding conversation for as long as possible. Also, he was in need of apple pie and a gallon of coffee.
“Hey, what’s up? This should be happy news, right?”
“What. The. Fuck? You threatening my brother, you son of a bitch?”
He helps the guy sit down, and can’t help but appreciate his firm trim figure as he oh so helpfully manhandles him into a comfortable position.  The man gratefully accepts what Dean offers, and Dean tries not to be a creeper as he hand feeds him.  But he knows those lips are going to feature in his fantasies for a long, long time.
“Dean!”
“I hoped you wouldn’t hold it against her. It would help her case if you were to give a statement in her defence.”
he wouldn’t call the cops, but that would be even worse. He had no intention of ending up as some sentinel’s guide, as effective a prison as bars and a cell.
“Dean, I’ve never seen you take any interest in a sentinel and whenever one has taken a shine to you, you’ve made sure to give him short shrift. Now you tell this guy you’ll
“The official line implies that only breaking forced bonds or such defective ones is possible, but that is simply not true. There are ways to break any link with the use of drugs. It isn’t pleasant. The person will need both medical help and therapy for months in order to return to a workable level of normality, if they ever do. Dean and I discussed this, and we agreed that bonding would actually be worse under these circumstances. If Crowley’s aims are nefarious in relation to Dean” – Dean raised an eyebrow at the language, and at the ‘if’ – “then the first thing he would do once he had him would be to break the bond. Neither of us would be in a position to aid the other.”
Castiel made it out the door in time to see a car speeding away down the driveway. His sentinel vision had recovered enough to allow him to ascertain that it was a classic car, possibly a late sixties Dodge Charger or Impala. If he hadn’t been dazzled by the light, he could have grabbed the plate number too. But still, he couldn’t help smiling. No doubt the thief had not expected anyone to interrupt him, and certainly not a sentinel, or he wouldn’t have chosen such a vehicle. So, a little cocky but very clever. Castiel’s spirit soared. He was the one, and Castiel could find him with that information.
“Really?  You didn’t want this either.”
“Sammy...” He sighed at Sam’s mutinous look – “I haven’t made up my mind yet, ok? I told Castiel I’d think about it.”
“Well, first of all, this” – he waved his hand between them in imitation of Dean’s gesture – “is not what happens when we sense
“Nothing worthwhile is easy to come by. We have differences, sure, but I believe your situation has led you to the life you now have, not some inherent criminal tendency.” And as Dean looked about to butt in – “Hear me out, please. I... did a little research on you.”
Cas smiled, but it didn’t contain the usual amount of radiant sunshine. Something was definitely up.
“He said he thought we would be well suited.”
) morphs into a calculating thinking one (
The mansion was reassuringly dark and welcoming. As it should be, considering Dean had been studying the Novaks for weeks. So far their behaviour had played right into his plan. Creatures of habit were the best. Tonight was the biannual Novak dinner, which as far as Dean could tell was an opportunity for the family to celebrate all successes and generally slap each other on the back. Because it was so hard to be successful when you were already rolling in it. Dean grinned while he expertly disabled the alarm system before tackling the lock. There would be a little less to roll in once tonight was over.
“Yeah, well, a guide’s life is all about following his sentinel about like a loyal little dog, isn’t it? You would expect me to drop everything and go to New York with you. I want my own life, thanks very much, and my own choices. And me and Sammy are doing fine.”
“They have my daughter! I couldn’t...”
“He’s your brother. On his head be it.”
“Nope.  Ain’t staying the night I’m afraid.  I squeezed this last job in, ‘cause the money was good.  Because” – and here the master class in acting, Dean’s face unleashes the most stunning and happy smile – “I’m getting married!”
Panic.
” – a gentle pressure on his hand – “is worth a shot.”
Castiel tried to think of any other way he could discover Dean, to try at least to keep his mind active and useful, and not succumb to anger or hopelessness. That would not help his guide. But his mind kept drifting to thoughts of Dean and what he might be going through right now, and he had to draw on all his strength to keep his focus. Hours passed in this agonising state of mind.
Geez, this was not how he had expected this conversation to go. He was ready to get all up in Castiel’s face and angrily kick the guy’s butt. But he wasn’t prepared for sad blue eyes and a voice that sent pleasant shivers down his spine. And so instead of sending him off with a heartfelt ‘fuck you’ his mouth uttered the words “I’ll think about it.”
*******
But by a stroke of bad luck the safe that was hardly ever used was opened the very next day after his meeting with Dean. His spendthrift brother Gabriel had sweet talked his mother into another loan above and beyond his generous allowance. Luckily they asked him first to look at the crime scene, without getting the police involved. He saw no point in holding back on the facts. He knew his parents would put his need for a guide well above any material loss.
“Are you done?” – and at Sammy’s somewhat resentful affirmative – “Awesome.  I’ll see you on the weekend.”
has not soured you about relationships
Some small talk followed, general queries about the ride there and Dean’s lovely vintage car. Then dinner was announced and Mr Novak led the way to the dining room. Dean was looking around as they made their way, and sensed a new presence next to him.
He also rides the go-karts just for the hell of it. That’s fun, even if some people give him odd looks for going alone.
But then Tennessee gets boring too, the country music gets annoying, and if he has to deal with another tourist family in town for the weekend he’ll lose his mind. So he unfolds the map again, throws his pocket knife, and heads for Oregon.
Dean stays in the Great Plains for the first two months. There’s a few hauntings in the area, one vampire, and two werewolves. Easy work. He calls Sam every night to tell him where he is, what he’s doing, and that he’s still alive. Sam gives him reports on life at the Bunker. The pipe in the bathroom broke, had to be fixed. Jody called asking for advice on an issue, but it turned out to be nothing. Mary asked again when Dean would be home, and again Sam lied.
Dean isn’t sure how he feels about this. On one hand, out of sight, out of mind. On the other...he just wants to see Cas again.
Dean thinks about it. Genuinely does. The idea of driving the six or seven hours back to Lebanon. Back to the bunker. Back to Mom.
“Are you sure you don’t want to talk to her?” Sam has begun asking this of him. Maybe his way of trying to ease Dean into getting used to Mom being around.
He gets to Nashville first. Goes to the Grand Ole Opry, picks up some Johnny Cash cassettes at a cheap record store and a woman named Carrie who looks close enough to the country star to make her worthwhile. It leaves him unsatisfied and upset with himself and that’s when he moves on to Memphis to tour Graceland for the fifth time and then to the Smokies, where he drinks overpriced Moonshine, buys a birthday gift for Sam at an outlet mall, a necklace for his mom, and a jacket that looks identical to Cas’ old one before it got ruined and replaced with that cheap, odd fitting one that was never quite the same. He mails all three to their P.O. box back in Lebanon, and Sam calls him a few days later to thank him for the package and to say that when Mary received the necklace she cried. Dean drinks himself senseless that night, then goes for a hike in the mountains the next day to clear his mind.
Sam tells Dean every phone call he wishes he had an estimated return date. And every time Dean tells him, “The moment I have one you’ll be the first to know.”
They always skirt the elephant in the room, the third member of Team Free Will who has been off on his own adventure for several months now. Neither knows how he’s doing, where he is, or if he is even still alive. They both are terrified to ask. Instead, Dean continues hunting, Sam continues living, and they both decide to act like Cas doesn’t exist until he does.
But, eventually, as all things do, it begins to wear thin. Each hunt starts to feel the same, and driving through endless corn from identical small town to small town starts to get old. It starts to get more difficult to stay in character undercover anymore, just because he doesn’t have the energy to keep the act up.
It lands smack dab in the middle of Tennessee. Tennessee it is. He hasn’t been to Nashville in a long time, anyway. And never before to the Smokies.
“What are you going to do then?”
Dean picks at lint on the threadbare quilt of his motel bed. “I’ll figure something out.”
