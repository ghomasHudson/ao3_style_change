I am planning a new superfamily story that I hope to begin posting around the beginning of March, so I won‚Äôt be gone for too long üòâ.
"He's‚Äîhe's," he stammered, gritting his teeth as he rounded a corner.
"Do you remember what I told you the night before the Phoenix mission?" Steve asked, his lips following the path of Tony's scar. Despite all of Steve's protests to the contrary, he knew that Tony still found his scar ugly, so he always tried to lavish as much attention to it as possible when they were intimate.
, he thought as Dad and Papa tucked him into bed, taking turns kissing his forehead. Even Papa seemed to be having one of his better days, which probably meant that he and Dad were making a beeline for their bedroom in three‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶ one‚Ä¶
"Yeah, but there should be no 'we' in this equation, Pete!" Tony said as he drew Peter closer, burying his nose into his curls. "We were trying to keep you
"Warp‚Ä¶ speed?" Bruce asked, frowning deeply. "Tony, is this more of your
"Don't listen to anything he says," Peter cut in. "Ned was actually late getting dropped off at the Tower because
Kicking off his shoes, Tony flung his tie in the general direction of the armchair and pushed himself up to his feet, grabbing his stack of books and following the glaring beam from his handlamp as he headed down the short hallway towards the bedrooms. Peter's door was cracked open, as per usual, so Tony peeked inside, relieved to see that he was sleeping peacefully.
Tony couldn't seem to help it, though. Not when he could no longer convince himself that Rogers' meaningful glances were just accidents. Or that Rogers seemed to go out of his way to praise every single thing that he did.
"Damn right we will," agreed Tony. He drew in a deep breath as the light turned green, deliberately loosening his death grip on the wheel. He wanted to make a good impression on Steve's ma, and getting all upset about stuff that he couldn't change was only amplifying his nervousness. "Tell me the first thing that you're gonna do with Pete once he's better, yeah? I'm sure you've thought about it."
, if you're not a sight for sore eyes," Tony said as Steve's large hands slipped around his waist, drawing him right into one of his patented bear hugs. Tony immediately breathed in, allowing the glorious scent of his husband's aftershave mixed with just that slight touch of vanilla wash over him, feeling the stress seep from his body in waves.
‚ÄúYeah, I think so.¬† I‚Äôm just‚Äî‚Äù¬† Steve sucks in a deep breath, shuddering again at the terrible taste in his mouth.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶
Dr Strange shook his head as Dad landed next to him, his shaking arms already reaching for Peter.
As Lorraine returns to her desk, Steve leans back in his chair, hissing in pain when his left shoulder protests him attempting to cross his arms.¬† He lets out a sigh as he carefully rubs at it, remembering Sharon‚Äôs instructions that he work more on his range-of-motion.
"You're alive. Oh God, you're alive!" Steve gasped as he squeezed his eyes closed, focusing in on the melodic sound of Tony's heartbeat and the feel of his long mechanic's fingers carding through his hair. His chest hurt so badly that he could barely breathe, and he knew his ironclad grip was probably hurting Tony, but he couldn't seem to bring himself to let go.
"Uh huh."
"Steve!" Tony moaned, far too loudly as Steve's long fingers curled around his ass, holding him in place as he rolled his hips up. A guttural groan tore from Steve's throat as he kissed his way back to Tony's mouth, his fingers kneading Tony's ass as though it was dough for bread.
Tony gave a sheepish shrug. "Well‚Ä¶ yeah, it kinda is, but it also makes sense when you think about it." He shifted, poking at his left foot which had fallen asleep. "Look, I can understand why you're confused since I don't remember Thor's ship having this capability. But the ship that took Pete and I to Titan did, 'cause Pete recognised it. It's why Strange couldn't use one of his portal things to get us off it before we landed on Titan. Or crashed, if you feel like getting specific."
It was something that she would do. Unlike some of the other nurses, Ms Sharon had always treated him well.
"Shh, buddy, I've got you," Dad murmured as he ran his fingers through Peter's hair. "I'm not gonna lie to you and say that everything's gonna be fine, 'cause those HYDRA creeps are a bunch of pretty sadistic motherfuckers, but I also know that there's no way in hell that Papa's just gonna sit there and take it either."
"I wasn't hiding it, Steve," Tony mumbled into his chest. "You were in no condition to hear it when I found out, and then‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ we needed that trip, honey. We needed that trip to be as relaxing as possible, and I didn't want it hanging over our heads the whole time."
And especially not after the news JARVIS had given him right after Peter had finished eating, while Steve was helping him brush his teeth.
"Dad, that was an accident, I‚Äî"
"Okay, so‚Ä¶ do you think she likes me? Like, like-like's me?"
"We sure do, little guy," he whispered as he pulled Peter into a hug. "We sure do."
The sound of a running faucet pulled Steve from his thoughts, and he quickly set the notebook back down on Peter's bed, arranging the blankets to cover the page he likely wasn't meant to see.
"Oh, yes. So I've heard," said Stacy. He gave Gwen a quick kiss on the cheek. "Well, have a good time, sweetheart."
The chambers grew so quiet that Tony could've heard a pin drop, but Tony was so upset that he barely registered it. How
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not anything,‚Äù Steve cuts in.¬† ‚ÄúWell, nothing except late.‚Äù¬† He brings Tony‚Äôs hand to his cheek, closing his eyes as the realisation hits him like a blast to the chest.
He at least had the wherewithal to emerge from his mind fog in time to brace himself for the high-pitched shrill of the bell. He had already been caught unawares by it twice that day, nearly knocking his computer to the floor one of the times in his haste to cover his ears, and he really didn't feel like having to listen to Flash tease him about being afraid of it yet again.
He‚Äôs not sure if it‚Äôs a good thing or a bad thing when his first thought is how many times he‚Äôs going to have to hear Phillips tell him ‚ÄòI told you so‚Äô.¬† Or that his very next thought is how much he doesn‚Äôt care, because he just won a FUCKING GOLD MEDAL!
"Not so strong now, are ya, asshole?" Quill taunted as he and Gamora landed next to Thanos. "For the record, this was
Blaster Peter shrugged. "Look, I dunno. I didn't really ask."
Because Steve Rogers, aka Captain America himself, had somehow seen it fit to fall in love with Tony, a sentiment he had shared only a few months after Tony‚Äôs fateful flight through Loki‚Äôs portal, carrying the missile intended to wipe out the citizens of Manhattan during the Battle of New York.¬† After releasing that missile straight into the aliens‚Äô mothership, Tony had fallen unconscious as he‚Äôd plummeted back to Earth, finally coming to in the middle of a debris-filled street.
"Yes, sir," said Steve. "I've been cleared by the base medical office and I'm ready to resume my duties."
"Approximately fifty-five miles, Mr Wilson," answered JARVIS.
Strange gave a shaky nod. "Yeah."
A situation he was not going to just sit by and allow to happen just because his dads still thought he was only a kid.
"What‚Ä¶ master?" scoffed Blaster Guy. "What am I supposed to say, Jesus?"
Unfortunately, Dad's poor attempt at bravado had Peter in such a bad mood the next morning that Gwen, who had been so excited about their upcoming trip to the Compound that she had accidentally let it slip in front of Ned, actually suggested to Peter that they postpone it instead. Peter immediately vetoed that idea, assuring Gwen that even if he did end up spending the weekend with his dads as usual, nothing would change.
"I'm sorry, Tony, but not exactly," Sam cut in. Tony immediately turned on him, and Sam raised his hands. "Hey, without Steve here I'm supposed to think like the Captain, so‚Ä¶ I'm just wondering if we can actually trust this location is all. I mean, how do we know that Peter didn't leave this here just to throw us off?"
‚ÄúHa ha ha, Dad.‚Äù
it." He leaned forward, kissing Tony softly on the lips. "Can you trust me?"
"Yeah, maybe. I s'pose it was inevitable since he is a Stark after all, the poor kid," Tony said instead. He looked up as Peter reentered the lab, a set of his earplugs clutched in one hand.
"Unlikely, sir, without Master Peter's assistance," JARVIS answered.
It wasn't exactly the same. The pitch was just a touch lower and the timbre just slightly‚Ä¶ off, likely due to compression by his ancient workstation, but it still sounded so much like him it was as though he'd been raised from the dead.
And the last thing that Joseph saw, just before a fireball half the size of the entire continent of Langara engulfed him in its searing heat, was the photograph of his beloved wife, Sarah, her small hands resting on top of the child she carried within her, knowing full well that he had just made her a widow.
"Okay, I'm going to ask you again," he said in his Captain's voice. "Do you think this is still a good idea?"
He'd even gone so far as to tell Peter that he was in love with Tony, something he hadn't even managed to say to Tony yet.
"Yeah, I sure hope so," answered Steve. "'Cause I'm pretty sure we're gonna need him."
If he could manage to get Obie out of his office, that is.
Tony stood next to his workstation as Barnes‚ÄîBucky‚Äîand Peter entered the lab, his hands clenched into tight fists at his sides as he attempted to take deep breaths. Conversations with the Department of Damage Control were never what he would call enjoyable, as trying to accomplish anything government-related had always been a royal pain in the ass, but the last several discussions had been particularly frustrating. Apparently someone, or more likely a group of someones, had decided that the convoys transporting artefacts from the Triskelion wreckage sites in Washington D.C. were the perfect targets for robbery attempts. So far the perpetrators hadn't been able to make off with anything of importance thanks to the newly upgraded Iron Legion, but as usual, trying to thwart future attempts had fallen squarely on Tony's shoulders.
"No sir!" Steve and Bucky said simultaneously.
"Thank you, sweetheart," he murmured into Tony's ear. "Thank you so much!"
don't you?"
Peter gave a nod. "That's good," he said as he turned to Steve. "And you're not afraid of going into space?"
Tony's heart gave a painful lurch. He'd so far been able to almost avoid imagining how badly hurt Steve was going to be once they found him, but now‚Äî
"Oh, Christ," Tony moaned as Steve hit a particularly sensitive spot on the back of his head. He shivered as a cold sweat broke out across his body, winding his arms around Steve as tightly as he possibly could. "Steve, where's‚Äîis he‚Äîare you
"As long as you like Steve and get along with him, I'm good," Dad added. "Yours is the only opinion that I care about."
"Can you tell me what's going on?" she asked, so tender and full of concern that Peter had to forcibly hold his tears back. "Or I guess, what else is going on?"
He was so deep in his own thoughts as he swung the backpack over his shoulder and hurried out of the locker room that he didn't even see Gwen waiting for him outside the door until he had barrelled right into her.
"Naked," Tony added. He glided his fingers down Steve's neck to his right pec, brushing his thumb across his nipple as his lips attacked Steve's throat, kissing and nibbling across his Adam's apple. "It's the only way to get a completely accurate scan."
"And how exactly would you know it, huh?" Dad shouted. "Just because your friend Gwen is a sweetheart doesn't mean that her old man can't be an asshole!"
"Daddy," Peter whimpered, his hands clamped around his ears like his head was about to explode. "Daddy, why're they all screaming at us? It's too loud, why do they have to be so loud?"
Yet another step in his healing process.
"Yeah, Liz is pretty upset about it, she told us that she's gonna be moving out of state now with her mom 'cause her dad's in some kind of witness protection or something, so‚Ä¶ but please don't forget to tell Peter that I called? Please? And as soon as he's feeling better I can bring his homework by, and‚Äî"
"And we're done too, Cap, so we can be wheels up whenever you guys are ready," Natasha said over the comm. She, Clint, and Sam had been scouring the rest of the bunker for the better part of the night, searching for any further clues as to what HYDRA had been up to.
Grandma brushed the hair from his forehead, tenderly patting his cheek. "You are a lot like your papa, young Peter Stark. You have a strong heart, just like he always did. Even before he was tall and strong."
"You're absolutely right about that, Captain Rogers," he said quietly. "In fact, I'd go so far as to say that most of my life has been a complete waste, leaving me as just another lonely old man." He glanced over at Peter, lying motionless in the capsule waiting for everything to begin, and then looked at Tony, his lower lip twitching slightly. "But yours won't be, Tony. You've got someone here who loves you despite the Stark name that was spoken like a curse for so many years. Despite every single strike that you ever had against you because of me. And so will that boy. Because of what he did, he'll be able to grow up revered as a national hero, and I guess‚Ä¶ I guess after everything‚Ä¶ it's the least I can do to help ensure that."
Well‚Ä¶ then again‚Ä¶ maybe not.
Peter gave a shrug. "Pizza's always good, isn't it?"
‚ÄúDon't you mean three by three there, Iron Man?‚Äù Clint says, smirking as he tightens his arrowhead.¬† ‚ÄúYou know I've been itchin‚Äô for a chance to try out these new arrows you made me.‚Äù
"Reminder noted, set for tomorrow afternoon upon your return from school."
"Well, that makes me feel a bit better," Steve said as the doors to the penthouse elevator slid open. "I'll let you know about the game, okay?"
It was the least he could do for his papa's best friend.
Before, Steve could only watch his life as it passed him by, stuck in the shadows of mistakes he knew he‚Äôd never be able to fix.¬† Until one day, a boy just happened to wander into his store, and set Steve‚Äôs life on a completely new course.¬† One that in all of the thousands of books he had read over the years, he still never would‚Äôve thought possible. ¬†In about a year and a half, he went from a man who had been slowly dying inside, going out of his mind with the madness that would‚Äôve eventually consumed him, into a man who, despite being so broken and faded, knew he was loved beyond reason.
As optimistic as he liked to pretend he was, Steve highly doubted it. The Langaran government had been searching for a permanent solution to their country's energy problem ever since the Battle of the Continents, and yet here it was twenty-eight years later and they still couldn't seem to come up with something better than turning everyone's lights off every single night.
"Steve?" Tony said as he skidded to a landing right behind Steve, his right repulsor at the ready. Gripping his shield, Steve pulled open the door to reveal another laboratory, complete with several machines that Steve remembered seeing in Dr Cho's offices as well as Tony's lab, as well as a couple of chemistry setups similar to what Peter used at home.
The next morning he'd repeated the question, especially once he realised that his father was nowhere to be found. But again his mother refused to answer, only telling Tony that Howard was away and that she didn't know when he'd be back.
"Mmm," said Stane, running his fingers along his salt and pepper goatee. "Well, then I guess we'll just have to try something a bit stronger." He stepped back, jerking his head towards the far corner of the image. "Get the sceptre."
All he wanted was to
look, complete with an extra helping of both his worry wrinkle and his steel-cutting jawline.
"Tony," Steve whispered, his fingers slowly threading into Tony's hair as he turned his head, his lips brushing across Tony's cheek as Tony shifted so he could kiss him properly, nearly sobbing once they finally connected. Steve's lips were dry, chapped, and swollen, but it was still one of the best kisses that Tony had ever had in his life because Steve‚Äîhis
Bruce nodded, yanking on his shoelace. "Okay, and the whole goal of using the Quantum Realm is to try to reverse the snap, right?"
I love you so much."
"There are some tools aboard," said Gamora, jerking her head towards Dr Strange, who had assumed the goofy
"That's what he said," answered Sam. "The first few times it freaked him the hell out pretty good, but now he just kinda goes with it. As much as anyone can, I guess."
"Ah, Tones? Care to fill in the rest of us?" asked Rhodey.
It had been Sam's way of telling Steve that a small amount of guilt could be healthy, as it tended to motivate people to try and fix things for the better.
"Ah huh," Tony said warily, pointedly ignoring his internal
"It's all right, Pep. Just have Happy bring 'em up sometime in the next couple of days and I'll take a look. It's not a problem."
If he were truly brave, Steve would've seen Brock for what he was way back in the beginning, instead of allowing him to take complete control over Steve‚Äôs life for the last three-plus years.
"Ah, yes, yes, your round friend," said Thor. "I rather enjoy his company, will he be accompanying us to the hockey as well?"
‚ÄúSo, it really is like the Twilight Zone,‚Äù Steve mutters.¬† ‚ÄúWith the door and everything.‚Äù
"I could do it," Tony said quickly, causing Steve's head to snap up in surprise. He opened his mouth to protest, and was immediately greeted with Tony's don't-argue-with-me-babe frown. "I've still got a few favours saved up, let me see what I can do."
"Well, you know I always appreciate that," Pepper said with a kind smile, waving her hand towards the door. "Go ahead and grab what you need, and then just send the stockroom supervisor an email with the serial number so they can take it off the stock list, all right?"
‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Fury muttered, frowning deeply.¬† ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs exactly what worries me.‚Äù
Peter huffed out a sharp breath, loosening his ironclad grip on his poor polar bear before he managed to force it into another dimension. "That's what I told her, and she said it was fine."
‚ÄúMmm.¬† Hope so,‚Äù muttered Peter.¬† ‚ÄúG‚Äônight, Dad.‚Äù
"Well, then I guess that rules me out," Sam said. "Since I'm just one of your normal, everyday humans."
Tony dropped his head, stroking his fingers through Peter's hair. "I know, bud, and I am so, so sorry. I wish I could make all of this just go away."
"You like that, don't you baby?" Tony murmured, kissing and nibbling across Steve's neck to his collarbone. Steve nodded frantically as he fumbled with Tony's shirt buttons, getting frustrated towards the end when the tiny round circles refused to cooperate and just ripping the shirt off of him.
"No!" Peter cried, the pathetic sound piercing Tony's heart like a shiv. "My name is Peter Stark-Rogers! I'm fifteen years old! I live in Avengers' Tower, and you can't have me! I won't let you!"
"You did?" Tony asked, his belly swooping when he realised that he had just pretty much confirmed their suspicions.
A wide smile stretched across Peter's round face, one that Tony couldn't help but return. He could never resist one of his son's smiles.
And Uncle James had mentioned it a few times to Peter as well. As had Grandpa, and Ms Sharon, and a couple of his old friends back in school, but Peter figured that the point had been made well enough.
Steve brought Tony's hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles. "I can't wait."
With the quickest of glances at his fuel gauge, Joseph steered the X-101 closer until he was within firing distance of the aircraft, scanning as best he could for any identifying markings and finding nothing. He huffed in frustration, activating his comm as he clipped the oxygen mask back over his face.
I can‚Äôt wait to see what you think!  Please don‚Äôt forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  üíñ
"You didn't connect his oxygen properly before he went to sleep," Tony said, low and tight. "The hose‚Äîit wasn't fastened the way it was supposed to be, so when Pete moved in his sleep, he‚Äîhe‚Äî" A single tear snaked its way down his cheek. "Oh gods, I can't lose him now. Not after‚Äînot after everything‚Äîoh gods
"'Kay," whispered Tony. The corners of his mouth drew into the slightest of smiles, one that Steve couldn't help but mirror.
"Mmm," Peter mumbled as he dragged his gaze over to Steve, his eyes widening in shock as they took him in.
‚ÄúHYDRA died with the Red Skull!‚Äù Steve snapped.¬† ‚ÄúThere is no possible way‚Äî!‚Äù
"Yeah, 'cause they're having so much trouble getting through now," Clint muttered. "And I was hoping I'd actually get to keep some of my arrows this time."
Tony let out a half-amused groan, rolling his eyes. "What, did he forget again?"
‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôve been known to play a round of golf or two on occasion, Colonel,‚Äù Obie said, giving Rhodey such a fake chuckle that Tony felt his blood pressure spike.¬† ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not sure you can call us
"Uhh, o-kay," he said slowly. "Can you tell me why?"
"Um‚Ä¶ could you please text Gwen in about ten minutes and tell her that I'm really sorry, but that my dads called and I had to leave early? And also arrange for Betty to give Ned a ride home? I'm pretty sure that she drove here herself, so it should be okay."
He was so thoroughly exhausted by the time he crawled back up to the penthouse and into his room that he just collapsed onto the bed without brushing his teeth, with one final thought flitting across his consciousness.
"Acknowledging the inevitable isn't the same as giving up, Tony," Howard said to Tony's back as he headed for the door. "You'd do well to remember that."
"No, no, let me help you," a woman's kind voice suddenly said, startling Peter so much that he gasped, which immediately triggered the very coughing fit he'd been trying to avoid. He squeezed his eyes closed as he gave into it, curling into a tight ball as two chilled hands took hold of his arms, guiding him to a more upright position.
Clearing his throat, Tony planted his feet and squared his shoulders, keeping his repulsors aimed directly at Hammer's chest.
"None of this is your fault, Gwen," Steve said in his Captain's voice. "There's nothing you need to be sorry for."
Tony was used to a lot of trial and error in his experiments. In fact, aside from parenting, he often enjoyed the errors almost more than the trials, as they provided him with the same kind of rush that he got when he drank too much coffee, or drove too fast around a sharp corner.
For a moment Peter didn't respond, his wide eyes flicking around the room in confusion before landing on Tony.
"Hey, guys!" Liz said as she slid into view from a nearby hallway, a red Solo cup in one hand. "I'm so glad you came!"
Shock swept across Steve's body like a wave, amplifying the pulsating pain in his ribs and foot to almost unbearable levels as tears stung his sore, swollen eyes.
"Papa," Peter said again, barely audible, his eyes completely closed. "I can't hold on anymore!"
. So very, very wrong.
"Congratulations," Dr Strange said, cold and biting. "You're a prophet."
Papa locked eyes with Dad over Peter's head, quirking his eyebrow, with Dad's shoulders sagging in response.
"Oh, he was an idiot," Tony cut in. "Pure and simple. Tried to convince O'Brien that he could design a better aircraft than me. He put on a pretty good show, but that's all he was. Just a bunch of unfulfilled promises dressed up in a fancy suit."
And now, faced with the very real possibility that another Chitauri invasion was imminent, Tony was damned if he was going to allow his husband or son to be hurt yet again because someone else was too afraid to act. Those images that he saw every single night, and that lived in the back of his mind every waking moment, those images of his beloved husband, beaten and bloodied and lying sprawled out on the battlefield, and of Peter, taking his last terrified breath in his arms‚Ä¶
"It would appear so, sir."
Peter's eyebrows knitted together. That wasn't exactly a secret.
"Who the hell is Peter?"
What would Tony have left then?
"Yeah, I'm sure there were a lot of things that the doctors told you about him," Phillips said, rather bitterly. "So it's good that my plan doesn't involve any of them."
"Ah huh," said Sam. "And‚Ä¶ is there any specific reason for this hobbit-like behaviour? I mean, I know it's not unusual for guys like you and Bucky to eat full meals every hour on the hour, but‚Ä¶ something tells me that there's something more going on here."
But Steve had told Tony that he was in love with him, and Tony had told Steve the same. And despite his nearly crushing anger and hurt, he still was.
"Just‚Ä¶ let me finish, okay?"
"Think you've got a screw rattling around in there or something, Hawkeye," she said as Clint clapped his palm over his ear.
"Ah, yep," said Tony. "When I got assigned to the X-300 program I asked Colonel Phillips if I could move over here. I'm usually up working past the blackout time, so it just made more sense." Tony didn't add that his main reason for the request had been because he just couldn't stand working alone in a tiny, windowless room with only a small handlamp for light. Only certain sections of the base had electricity during the blackout periods, and Tony's office was now in one of them.
Steve huffed, scowling as he tried to push the little voice back down into the deep recesses of his mind, where it belonged. He had tried very hard to ignore the fact that he found Anthony not only beyond beautiful but also charming as well, an effect made even more obvious when he smiled.
"Let's make sure that he remembers this one, yes?" the voice continued as two sets footsteps echoed against the concrete floor. "I think it might make our task a bit easier from here on out."
"Am I ready to meet an actual prince? Hell no," Bucky answered, smirking slightly. "But someone's gotta make sure that you don't trip over your tongue, so here I am."
"Oh, Christ," Tony muttered, his shoulders dropping. He probably would've figured that out as well if he hadn't been so distracted by the fucking
Steve watched her disappear around the corner, tipping his head back once she was gone.
"Oh no," Howard said softly. He swallowed hard, tilting his head. "I‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ well, the connection, it looked‚Äîit looked right to me when I did it, but‚Äîbut maybe I didn't get as good a look as I thought, and‚Äî"
‚ÄúYes, sweetheart, I promise,‚Äù answers Steve.¬† He lifts his head to press a kiss to Tony‚Äôs forehead, then lets it fall back, too weak even to hold it up.¬† His eyes flutter again as he hears a strange sort of ruckus, followed by an odd ripping noise as a shadowy figure appears, almost like a god descending from the heavens above.
"There's a lot going on that you don't know about, Buck," Steve finally said.
"Yes, we did," Natasha said before Steve could answer. She gave Carol a friendly smile that was only slightly forced. "So, we were kinda hoping you might be able to help us figure out what happened here‚Äî"
don't let them put me under! Please, I don't want to!"
weird?‚Äînow that he thought about it, it was almost as though Dr Strange had been specifically waiting for the moment when Dad and the others disappeared.
Once again the battle seemed to pause as everyone on both sides glanced up at the gargantuan ship, watching as it settled about two hundred or so metres above the ground. Tony's heart thudded as he heard T'Challa order his warriors to regroup, followed directly by Valkyrie ordering the Asgardians to do the same.
Heat bloomed across Steve‚Äôs chest, and he dipped his head, brushing his lips across Tony‚Äôs in a gentle kiss.
With a sigh, Gwen shuffled the stack of index cards in her hands, eyeing the rest of the team before she started firing various questions at them, the sharp
"Yeah, okay," Tony whispered. He pressed a soft kiss to Steve's lips, tilting his head as he smirked. "But I'm not exactly sure how watching all you guys stuff your faces full of pizza is supposed to be enjoyable."
‚ÄúThank you, little guy,‚Äù Papa whispered as he kissed the top of Peter‚Äôs head.¬† ‚ÄúI couldn't have done this without you.‚Äù
"Yes, please," said Peter. "I'm starving!"
"You are most welcome, Captain."
‚ÄúTony?‚Äù Steve calls again, a bit louder this time.¬† He steps forward, attempting to peek through the window, his heart jumping into his throat when he sees nothing but blackness.
"It's just not right, Steve," Tony said as he stopped at a red light, gripping the steering wheel with white knuckles. "No kid should ever have to go through what you and Pete had to go through."
"And I can't think of anyone better qualified to handle it," Tony said proudly. "Thanks, Pep."
"Yes!" Uncle Thor suddenly shouted from the opposite end of the suite, nearly causing Peter to drop his plate. "That is yet another victory for our beloved Rangers!"
"Pictures of what?" Ned asked as he suddenly appeared behind Peter's left shoulder. Peter jumped, almost knocking into Gwen as he grabbed her hand, tugging her around.
"Hey, hon," he began, quickly clearing his throat when his voice caught. "You know, normally in times like this I tend to put my foot in my mouth and say something totally inappropriate, but I'm afraid this time I'm gonna have to disappoint you and just tell you how I'm feeling. So‚Ä¶ here goes." He paused, tapping his armoured fingers against his thigh. "The truth of the matter is, I failed. I missed signs, didn't read the room correctly, whatever you wanna call it. I just failed. And because of that, our son, our sweet, precious boy, the boy you brought back to life lying there in the desert sand, is‚Äîis gone. And soon enough, I imagine that I'll be gone too, 'cause this ship's pretty much dead in the water up here, so‚Ä¶ The blue and green madams and I tried to fix it, but‚Ä¶ it was just too beat up. I'm guessing we have less than a day's worth of air left before‚Äîwell‚Ä¶ I know I don't have to tell you what I mean."
"You have to, –°—Ç–∏–≤, and you know it," said Bucky. "For him."
"You!" Tony finally choked out, bumping into the bed and nearly falling backwards. He sucked in a deep, shaky breath as he righted himself, his heart threatening to pound right out of his chest. "What in the goddamn
"Not one of mine, honey," Tony said as he landed with a
Steve gulped, shaking his head. "Tony, it's not important‚Äî"
anything was going to be okay, much less whatever "it" Dad was referring to.
"You feel so good, Tony," he murmured as he trailed soft kisses all over Tony's cheeks and jaw, each sending bolts of pleasure throughout his body. "So hard to keep my eyes off you, so hard to keep my hands away. I don't‚ÄîI don't want to let you go, I don't‚Äî"
"Steve‚Ä¶ are you‚Äîare you
"Yeah."
"I am unsure, sir," answered JARVIS. "I do however agree that the fog does not appear to be a natural phenomenon."
It was on the tip of Steve's tongue to tell Bruce that he had no intention of picking up a pencil or paintbrush ever again when James grabbed hold of his arm, holding it steady as Bruce jabbed him with the needle. The drug hit him like a truck, making his head spin even more as James guided him to lie back on the gurney.
‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Sam said with a short nod.¬† He tugged gently on Bucky‚Äôs hand.¬† ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, babe, let's go decompress for a while, huh?‚Äù
"Holy shit," he said, turning to Bruce with wide eyes. "Cryokinesis? Ice manipulation?"
But there was no stopping it. There was nothing to stop the shattering of Peter's heart as if it had been made of porcelain instead of flesh and blood. There was nothing to stop the fact that his actions had managed to kill not only his dads, but his beloved Auntie and Gwen as well.
"Oh, yeah, sure he is. I don't believe that for a second," Blaster Guy snapped. "And how the hell does this other guy know my name, hmm? What're you, a psychic or something?"
"Mmm, okay," Gwen said warily. "Are they coming to pick you up?"
Suddenly the entire screen went blank, returning about three seconds later back at the same place where Peter had started. Peter bit down hard on his lip as he tapped in various commands, checking on both his father's and grandfather's passwords, and finding nothing.
"I don't know, Steve, okay?" Tony snapped. "Teenagers do stupid things all the damn time, but‚Äî"
Now it‚Äôs Steve‚Äôs turn to frown.¬† ‚ÄúYou think Strucker was already gone by the time we jumped down here?‚Äù
"Well, technically I really am only thirty anyway, so‚Äî"
"Can I‚Äîcan I hold you?" he added, glancing down at his all-but-useless arms. "Please? I know this doesn't magically fix anything, but‚Äî"
"Mmm. So, you said he's a pilot?" Peter asked. "What's his name?"
Of course, when Tony proceeded to shout all of that into Howard‚Äôs face the day Howard kicked them out of his house, Howard emphatically denied it, saying that if Tony had just been more willing to let go of some of his ego and give Obadiah the respect he deserved that Howard wouldn‚Äôt have been forced to take such a drastic step.
For a moment, Shostakov stares at Steve, his lips twitching like he‚Äôs trying to figure out how to respond.¬† Then he laughs, clapping Steve so hard on his left shoulder that he has to bite down on his tongue to keep from crying out.
Not that she would've had the time to date anyone anyway. As the only source of income for their family, Sarah was forced to practically work herself to the bone in order to keep a roof over their heads and food on their table, not to mention paying for the medicines that Steve constantly needed in order to keep breathing. During the winters it often got to the point where Sarah went days without even coming home, choosing instead to just sleep at the hospital for a few hours in between her shifts while leaving Steve in the care of Bucky's family, whose father was also an Air Corps pilot and whose mother didn't have to work.
Tony's lower lip shook as he took a small sip of his coffee. "You were right, I was looking over the data from SHIELD last night. And from what I've been able to figure out, it's‚Äîit's coming, Steve. That Chitauri army that I saw out in space, that massive ship that I blew up with the missile, somehow it's coming back. Whatever the hell that was that happened over Wakanda, the energy signature was the same as the energy weapons used by the Chitauri in the Battle of New York, so‚Ä¶ they're coming back. And this time, they're not gonna stop."
"Actually, he's not," answered Sharon. "He finally turned a corner about three days ago and was just discharged earlier this morning. The doctors expect him to make a full recovery."
Unfortunately, not even Gwen's immeasurable understanding was enough to get Peter through his school day unscathed. Not only did he manage to snap one of the arms off of his favourite pair of glasses during Physics, earning an obnoxious guffaw from Flash Thompson, he also accidentally broke one of the faucet handles in the locker room after gym and only remembered to pack half the amount of snacks that he needed, forcing Gwen to ask her father to stop at a convenience store on the way to their house after practise so he could buy something to eat.
"Bruce said Dr Cho is already waiting for us in the penthouse," Papa said as he braked for a red light. "Are you sure that's gonna be enough?"
"Mmm. You and Stevie both, apparently," grumbled Uncle Bucky. He shifted on his chair, tossing a quick glance at the door. "All right."
‚ÄúYeah, baby, that‚Äôs it.¬† I wanna see it,‚Äù Tony rasped into Steve‚Äôs neck, his thrusts already starting to falter.¬† ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, Steve!¬† Come for me!‚Äù
At least for a few minutes.
‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm guessing you're here about the Jericho‚Äî?‚Äù
"See? 'Cause you're a smart kid," said Uncle Bruce. "Did your dad tell you that I'm gonna be going with Thor and Loki once we finally get this ship ready?"
"You're gonna be at school on Monday, right?" Ned asked.
Tony grinned, pecking Steve's kiss-swollen lips again before sliding off his lap and hurrying over to his workstation. He and Steve had had sex in the lab often enough that Tony now made sure to keep at least one bottle of lube in there at all times, especially after he got caught in the hallway once by Peter during one of his middle-of-the-night snack runs. Grabbing the bottle he found in his top drawer, Tony squirted some into his palm and dropped to his knees in front of Steve, slowly stroking him as he trailed his lips along the inside of his thighs, sucking more marks into his skin.
"That's 'cause you showed up three minutes late to a briefing with your zipper still down, you idiot," said Tomis. "I mean, really. A toothpaste stain on your tie or something would've been better 'n that."
"Hey, kiddo," Ms Sharon said sadly as she came into the room, a telephone receiver in one hand. "It's your dad."
After swearing to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help them God, Tony and Steve retook their seats, waiting expectantly as Senator Davis cleared his throat, giving Tony that politician's smile of his that always made his skin crawl.
"Me too." Steve sighed as he glanced over at the clock, patting Tony's flank. "Don't get up, okay? Just let me take care of you."
She'd never treated him like he was nothing but a menace to society, like so many others had.
‚ÄúAh huh,‚Äù Tony said as he tapped his monitor to life.¬† ‚ÄúAnd how many of those rifles are going out?‚Äù
"All right," he said. He popped the bread into his mouth, his eyes closing briefly as he chewed. "This really is delicious."
"Sleep now, buddy," Dad whispered. "I love you."
He was silenced by Tony brushing his fingers across his lips, the soft touch nearly causing his knees to buckle.
"Um‚Ä¶ I don't know exactly. It was baked into a cake, and‚Äî"
"All right." Tony's hands were shaking as he poked his head out of the bedroom, finding Steve standing down the hall with his ma.
"I am unsure as to what else we could consider, sir," JARVIS said. "Unless you feel that a possible target might suddenly possess inanimate qualities the very moment it is targeted, then there is nothing else I would recommend."
"That's correct," said Gwen approvingly, shuffling her cards. "Ned, in what year was the novel
Pressing a quick kiss to Tony's forehead, Steve took his place on Peter's opposite side, laying down next to him and carefully draping his arm across his waist. Bruce, Natasha, Clint, and Bucky were all working in Tony's lab, already trying to figure out what had happened, but Steve knew they wouldn't bother them for awhile unless it became absolutely necessary.
‚ÄúJARVIS, do me a favour and run the simulation again, yeah?‚Äù he said, or rather, croaked as he walked over to the coffee pot, giving DUM-E a quick pat on his arm before refilling his largest mug.¬† In his intense brain fog, no doubt brought on by the fact that he hadn't slept in over thirty-six hours‚Äî
"She doesn't really hate your father, sweetheart," Steve said once they were parked outside the hospital. He hadn't been lying when he'd told Tony they were only going to stay for dinner, explaining to Sarah that Peter had been going to sleep a bit earlier than usual lately. "It's just not illegal for anyone in Langara to hate Howard Stark."
"The master bedroom is now soundproofed, Captain," JARVIS announced.
He only hopes that Mr Rogers doesn‚Äôt charge more than they can afford.
Steve didn't know what was worse: the fact that someone who didn't even know him was so harshly judging not only his intentions but also his integrity, or that at least a third to a half of the other senators seemed to be agreeing with Davis's remarks.
you, Barton!" Tony called as Steve made a very poor attempt to adjust himself. "You think you're so damn funny, don't ya?"
And, if there were two more people like Peter who HYDRA had already found, that meant there were likely even more who had yet to be found, which meant that there was quite possibly an entire subpopulation of people with similar mutations who were potentially in danger of becoming slaves for HYDRA. All HYDRA would need would be a big enough supply of that drug, and they could control just about anyone.
But later that night, after he and Steve practically pounced on each other as soon as they made it to their bedroom, spending almost two hours making love with an intensity they hadn't had in a long time, Tony laid there awake, holding his husband as he slept curled up next to him, his head resting on Tony's chest and Tony's fingers buried in his hair. It had been in the back of his mind for quite awhile that the fact that Peter and Steve had shared that brief empathic connection during the Miami bunker battle was perhaps part of the reason why their nightmares and flashbacks had been so much worse than his own since then. Bruce had treated them both with the Aminacin antidote, but they could still detect trace amounts of the drug in both of their systems, and in Bucky's as well, which had led Tony and Bruce to believe that there had to be a connection between the drug and their enhanced genes that he hadn't yet been able to figure out.
"Send this over to Rhodey, will ya?"
"Yeah, my eyes are pretty good," Peter said with a chuckle. "One of the few parts of my body that actually work correctly."
Panic washed over Steve like a tsunami, stealing all the air from his lungs. If HYDRA had already managed to capture Peter, then that probably meant they had Tony as well, and then‚Äî
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Steve said, without hesitation as he grabbed onto Tony‚Äôs perfect ass, pressing down on him as he rolled his hips up to meet him.¬† A gasp tore from Tony‚Äôs throat at the friction, sending such a strong burst of heat across Steve‚Äôs chest that he threw his head back against the pillow.
Steve looked over at Tony, who responded with a quick shake of his head. Turning Lang over to the authorities would accomplish a whole bunch of nothing, and besides, it was Hank Pym he was really after. Not this stuttering, bumbling, Captain America fanboy.
"I called her this afternoon, before I met you for dinner." Steve sucked in a shaky breath, bringing Tony's hand to his lips. "Sweetheart, there's something really important that we need to discuss, and‚ÄîI hope that you won't be upset with me, because I'm probably overstepping things here a bit, but‚Äî"
"No," Peter squeaked. "I'm really happy for you, Dad. I hope you guys have fun."
Once again, it was as though someone had dropped a bucket of ice water down Steve's spine as his disbelieving eyes read through the vast list of projects, a list that included none other than Project Rebirth.
Peter didn't have much time left, which meant that none of them did. Project Phoenix needed to find its wings soon, before the whole entire thing just burned up, leaving nothing behind but ashes.
As soon as he did, though, well‚Ä¶ Steve was positive that he had never blushed so hard in his entire life.¬† And since he was usually about as pale as the moon, that was saying something.
Tony's eyes crinkled as he smiled mischievously, grinding his hips down against Steve's as he glided Steve's t-shirt up and over his head, tossing it aside. "Oh, I know that, hot stuff. If it had been, you wouldn't've bothered with a shirt."
"Double-check the hologram first, Pete, yeah?"
Would there ever come a time when such an announcement would be no longer necessary?
Peter's eyebrows shot up so high they disappeared under his hair. "Oh! Can I?"
‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù Tony said, trailing his fingertips along Steve‚Äôs knuckles.¬† ‚ÄúYou trust me, right?‚Äù
Basically, what HYDRA and the Winter Soldiers had been trying to do to Peter down in the Miami bunker.
"Oh, thank the gods!" Tony exclaimed. "Your exit took about eleven seconds longer than the first time, so I was just‚Äî"
"Thanks," Tony whispered, and Steve's throat tightened. Clearance or not, it bothered Steve that Tony felt he had to constantly thank him for showing him what he considered basic kindness and respect.
"Thank you, sir," Steve said. "We all appreciate that very much."
‚ÄúLook, if it‚Äôs a question of work ethic, let me tell you right now that you won‚Äôt find a kid with a better one than my Pete,‚Äù Dad says, gently squeezing Peter‚Äôs shoulder.¬† ‚ÄúNo matter what, he‚Äôll make you proud.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs afraid he‚Äôs gonna lose,‚Äù Tony whispers.¬† ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ why?‚Äù
"Oh, yeah. Apparently he's being moved to some super-secret holding facility sometime in the next few days, somewhere that's only accessible by helicopter or something, based on what my dad says. And he's still refusing to talk, so, whatever he was involved in is probably a lot bigger than people first thought."
‚ÄúYes, I think so.‚Äù¬† In particular, Steve was thinking of Bucky, who, despite his rather normal-appearing demeanour when he and Sam stopped into the bookstore, had apparently been still suffering from his trauma issues almost as badly as Steve.
‚ÄúJesus Christ, when isn't it urgent,‚Äù Tony muttered, scowling.¬† ‚ÄúGo ahead and put him through, Miss Potts, and then you're free to leave.‚Äù
A wide smile stretched across Peter's pale lips, one that Steve couldn't help but mirror.
Peter felt Dad sigh, and he made another attempt to speak, to remind Quill for at least the third time that Dad's name was in fact Mr Stark, not Mr Man. But after Dad muttered a rapid series of curses under his breath and yet another swallow attempt was thwarted by his dry, raw throat, Peter decided against it.
"Hmm‚Ä¶ it's not quite there yet. Something's‚Ä¶" Peter murmured as he tilted his head, inspecting his work. His tongue poked out between his teeth as he darkened a few lines near the elbow joint and added in the outline of a forgotten pinky fingernail. There was no sense in having a fully-functional prosthesis without the appropriate fingernails.
"Tony‚Äî"
Like that time Peter got lost at Disneyland when he was seven kind of panicking.
Steve bit down on his bottom lip, pondering Sam's words. He
‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù Lorraine asks, startling Steve.¬† ‚ÄúI didn't quite catch that?‚Äù
Even so, Steve was still glad they had made that arrangement, as he and Tony desperately needed some time for themselves. Ever since he had returned home from space to discover that Peter was near death, he and Tony had barely had three seconds to catch their breaths. Getting Peter through his serum procedure and helping him adjust to his new enhancements, all while helping to rebuild two war-torn countries was more work than Steve had ever imagined it would be, and while he was very proud of what they had already accomplished and what they were continuing to accomplish, he was ready to push all of that out of his mind for the next forty-eight hours and focus all of his attention onto his husband.
"You're damn right you may," Tony said firmly. "Actually, why don't we just say that if any of these goddamn things so much as looks at Pete funny, you take 'em out. Yeah?"
"Uhh, not till after I broke out of jail," Lang answered. "But that only happened because I was trying to break back into Hank's house so I could return what I took."
"Ah huh," said Tony. "So how long would that give us?"
"No, honey, I don't know if you understand‚Äî"
"Are you too busy to come help me with dinner, little guy?" Papa asked.
Dad glanced at Papa, his face falling as Papa dropped his head.
he thought as he glanced out his window, smiling lightly as he watched Mrs Bird land on her nest. Her chicks had grown so big in the last few days that they were almost too big to still fit inside. Soon they would be flying away.
Peter thought frantically as the monster swung again, knocking Peter from his perch on the wall and onto the sticky and gross theatre floor. Peter grimaced as he saw that he had barely avoided landing on top of a wad of gum that was almost the size of his fist, quickly getting to his feet to find Uncle Bucky trying to punch through the wall with his metal left arm, with Gwen still held tightly in his right.
"No, I don't think it's a good idea!" Tony snapped. "But I also don't think that we have a choice! That asshole tried to break into our
Which, if he was being completely honest, he wasn't quite sure if he
"Uh huh. So, each satellite would have the arc reactor that you designed as its main power core‚Äî"
Mr Stacy frowned as he took a sip of his water. "Yes, but why did you learn about him? What has he done that makes his life worthy of being taught to a fifth grader? It's not like you're learning about military strategies or how to vaporise aliens yet, are you?"
Tony internally rolled his eyes, crossing his arms over his front.¬† ‚ÄúDid you have an actual reason for being in here, or am I just supposed to guess?‚Äù
Peter's heart was still beating, as evidenced by the steady
"No!" Steve choked on a gasp as Peter released his grip and he fell into a crumpled heap on the freezing cold floor. He immediately reached for his left foot, cradling it as Doctor List and Wanda turned and walked away, their footsteps echoing in time with his panicked cries.
"I'm fine with that," Scott said with a shrug.
They continued on for another ten minutes or so, until Mr Harrington called an end to the practise, practically tripping over himself in his haste to rush over to Papa so he could shake his hand.
"Steve, it's just gonna get worse!"
Captain," Tony would say, as he tried to hide that little half-annoyed smirk that Steve still found irresistible over four years later. Even when it was directed at him.
They had taken his clothes sometime between being shoved into the backseat of Agent Bartlett's car and his arrival at‚Ä¶ wherever he was, leaving him dressed only in a paper-thin t-shirt and pants. The car had barely cleared the parking garage when the agent sitting next to him jabbed him in the neck with a needle the size of a straw, pulling a cloth bag over his head as he lost consciousness. Steve grimaced as he gingerly touched the puncture site, hot and tender under his fingertips. Whatever it was they had shot into him had burned something fierce going in, which led Steve to think it was the same drug that Killian and Stane had given him down at the Miami bunker.
Despite the pain throbbing with every single beat of his heart, Steve felt himself nodding off again, the dinosaur tranquilliser apparently even stronger than Bruce had said. Right away, he fell into a dream, a happy, peaceful dream that he instantly decided he never wanted to wake from.
"Um‚Ä¶ but isn't he that one doctor that drove his car off a mountain?" Peter asked. He was only about a block away now, and still trying to wiggle out of his jeans after sending his hoodie and t-shirt flying a couple blocks back. "Oh my God, JARVIS, that one alien carrying the pickaxe thingy is humongous!"
And then there were Steve‚Äôs nightmares.¬† And the daytime flashbacks, which, as much as Tony hated to admit it, were getting worse almost by the day.¬† It was horrible for Tony to watch the man that he loved suddenly become so consumed by thoughts and visions from his life as a soldier.¬† Horrible to have to just sit there helpless as Steve clamped his hands over his ears and dug his fingertips into his scalp to the point of drawing blood, all while begging him to please,
"Peter," Papa finally choked out, tears welling in his eyes. He reached a shaking hand up to cup Peter's cheek. "It's really you? You're not‚Äîyou're not just another HYDRA trick?"
out there! And if you die, that's gonna be on me and Papa, and I can tell you right now and with absolute certainty that neither one of us would ever be able to recover from it. Not
And that was assuming that Steve didn't get sick again, which was never a given.
Yet another futile attempt to assuage the guilt that constantly gnawed at him.
Unfortunately, they hadn't found much of anything. Everything in the place seemed to focus on the computer data and the strange-looking stasis pods in the opposite laboratory.
A chorus of assents rose up from the table as everyone got to their feet, filing out of the conference room towards the kitchen. As soon as Thor had exited the room, Steve drew Tony into a hug, squeezing him as tightly as he dared.
Steve's chest was so rigid and tight that he could barely draw in air, pulling memories of his severe childhood asthma attacks from deep within the recesses of his mind and slamming them to the surface. The sensation of being unable to breathe had never failed to cause Steve to panic, but this time he couldn't blame the lung disease he had suffered with for the first twenty-four years of his life, or the fact that he was drowning.
"It's okay, buddy. I've got you," Dad said, over and over. "It's all over now. Oh God, Pete, I thought I was gonna lose you!"
"Never!" Steve screamed as he launched his shield at Thanos with every ounce of his strength, crying out in shock as the alien deflected it away as if it were nothing more than a frisbee.
Steve hesitated. He had just visited with Peter the day before so he knew Peter wasn't expecting to see him again until tomorrow, but‚Ä¶
"You mean the ones that somehow keep winding up in your drawer?" Steve asked, raising an eyebrow.
‚ÄúAt your service, sir.‚Äù
Apparently, it‚Äôs not meant to be.
"Good evening, officers," he said once he'd opened the door. "What can I do for you?"
‚ÄúYes, please,‚Äù Steve says quickly.¬† ‚ÄúJust give me a count of‚Äî‚Äù
"Mmm," Steve muttered as he leaned back, sliding his hand under Tony's chin so he could meet his eyes. "You know that's not true when it comes to you and Peter, right? We always make those decisions together."
Peter shook his head, closing his eyes. "No, I can wait till we get home," he said, stifling a yawn. "Just tired."
And he still was, there was no question about it. There was no doubt in his mind that the procedure ended up saving his life, as he had grown up with such severe‚Äîand costly‚Äîlung problems that he likely wouldn't have lived much past his nineteenth birthday having to rely on the medicines that were available to civilians.
If Tony had been a poet he could've written sonnets about that dimple. "I
But he never was. Not about anything.
They left for home the following day, taking off just after the sun went down in the hopes that the children would be able to sleep on the jet. Steve's heart was nearly filled to bursting as he, Tony, and Peter took over the largest couch in the back, Tony tucked up against one side and Peter against the other, both of them sound asleep. They were so alike that they even made some of the same faces as they slept, with Steve taking plenty of mental notes so he could sketch them out later. The little sketchbook that he always took on missions still had a few blank pages left, and Steve wanted to get them filled before Peter decided that he was too old to cuddle.
"Please, Tony, just let me finish, okay?" Steve interrupted. "This is really important to me."
And what Steve wouldn't give to hear one of Tony's goofy remarks now.
Since the Iron Legion was developed mainly for the protection of the Damage Control convoys, Tony had been storing their schematics and other information on a dedicated Damage Control server, one that apparently either Quentin Beck or whoever he was spying for was able to find and hack into using the coding patch that Beck wrote for JARVIS all those years ago.
"It was at that point that I was introduced to Dr Erskine, Senator," replied Steve.
"Let me stop you right there," Peter interrupted. "I know what you're gonna say, and you don't have to, okay? I've heard it my whole life."
Their family had won.
"Barring interruption, Colonel Rhodes' armour will be completed at approximately 1800."
For at least thirty minutes, Tony just stood there while Obie continued his diatribe, ranting and raving that Tony‚Äôs ‚Äúshameful dalliance‚Äù was going to bring such a crushing wave of bad publicity to the company that it may never recover.
You may have noticed that I‚Äôve added a chapter üòâ My words got a bit away from me, as they often tend to do.  I hope that‚Äôs okay with everyone üòä
The tears he'd been trying to hold back finally spilled down Peter's cheeks as he looked over to where Dr Strange was sitting. The wizard's head was tipped back, with his eyes closed and his left foot tapping on the ground as though he were listening to music or something, seemingly oblivious to the fact that three people had just up and vanished right in front of him.
"You're Scott Lang," Steve stated. "Yes, we're both already well aware of who you are."
"Yeah, yeah, does that mean we can go eat soon?" asked Sam as he landed next to Bucky, who was brushing dust from his metal arm. "I'm sure the turkeys are just about done, and‚Äî"
"Make ready your team, Captain," he said. "It is time."
Steve narrowed his eyes, not too difficult given how swollen they were, his heart already thudding against his sore chest. "Think your trust has been misplaced, Doctor."
But first he had to ensure that Tony did get better, which, despite the forward progress he had made in the last twenty-four hours or so, he still had quite a ways to go. While he at least wasn't as sick as he had been following the battle in the Miami bunker, having to see his husband lying motionless in a hospital bed and hooked up to an innumerable amount of tubes, wires, and monitors was bringing way too many of Steve's repressed memories of that horrible time back up to the surface.
-geeky
"Where're you going this time, Papa?" Peter asked as he stepped into Steve's open arms, squeezing him so tightly that Steve grunted. Peter had had yet another growth spurt over the summer, and still hadn't quite adjusted to his subsequent increase in strength.
At Steve's nod, Tony ordered JARVIS to turn off the television, pulling Steve to lie back down. Steve draped his arm across Tony's waist and pulled him as close as possible, burying his nose into his hair and breathing in.
"Of course I did! Tony‚Äî"
"Yeah, he and Bucky are down in his lab," Dad said. He picked up a piece of bacon from the tray, breaking off a piece. "Why?"
"There's really nothing about it to understand, Steve," said Sam, practically spitting the words. "The only message here is that instead of taking care of one of their own who almost died for his country, our government is turning its back on him just 'cause he can't fly anymore." He let out a morbid chuckle, his hand resting protectively on Bucky's uninjured shoulder. "They even had the gall to tell Bucky that he's gonna be billed for any treatment that he receives from that point on, even though the docs haven't even cleared him to be discharged yet. There was no mention of a prosthesis, physical therapy, nothing. They're just completely hanging him out to dry."
"I have received no reply as of yet from Agent Bartlett, sir," JARVIS said. "Would you like me to put in another call to his office?"
"Not here, babe," Tony whispered. "Let's get back to the apartment first, yeah?"
Steve frowned, wishing he'd thought to tell JARVIS not to say anything. "That's okay, JARVIS, but please tell Peter that he can't come in here. I don't want him exposed to anything until‚Äî"
‚ÄúMight be nice to commandeer one of those trucks too,‚Äù adds Natasha, indicating the armoured jeeps parked next to each of the bunkers.¬† ‚ÄúThat way, once Clint takes out the guards, he and I can use it to move from point to point.‚Äù
"Then we snap our own fingers," Tony said firmly. "And we get rid of all the Chitauri and all the Thanoses in all the universes. We finish this whole goddamn thing once and for all."
"Oh, shit!" cried Peter as a deafening cracking noise suddenly split the air, the same exact sound that he'd heard up at the Compound when he and Papa were waterskiing, right before he was pulled under the water. Twisting around, Peter let out a shriek as he saw the ice start to split, the crack growing wider and wider as it approached him.
"Yeah, Steve," said John. "I'm thinking that after all this is done and we save the planet and all, you should owe me a round of golf."
"His father and I wouldn't have it any other way, sir," said Steve, patting his pocket when his phone buzzed again. He held out his hand, shaking Stacy's firmly. "Now if you'll excuse me, I'll let you get back to your work."
looks. "Well, what're you thinking, Sam? My husband's been held captive by a bunch of raving Nazi lunatics for almost a month, and now my son's got it into his head that he's the only one who can save him. How in the hell do you
Another pause followed, accompanied by the shuffle of papers and the zip of a messenger bag.
"King T'Challa," Steve said in his Captain's voice. "While you've met some of our team already, I'd like to introduce us all again, if I may."
"Hey," James suddenly cut in from the doorway. He jerked his head, indicating for them to follow him.
"What did your papa mean about sensing something weird?" Ned asked as they approached the door. "I've never heard him say that to you before."
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt what?¬† What can't you do?¬† Dad, it was an accident!¬† He didn't try to hurt me, he thought he was protecting me!‚Äù
Tony turned his head just enough to kiss the underside of Steve's jaw. "I know, honey. I love you too."
Tony's eyebrows shot up at Wilson's remarks. For someone who'd been in the running to fly the Phoenix missions as well, he definitely didn't seem like he was bitter about the fact that he hadn't qualified.
‚ÄúOw, ow, ow, ow, ow,‚Äù he hisses as he bends his elbow and slowly raises his left arm above his head, twisting his palm to and fro once it‚Äôs in place, just like Sharon taught him.¬† He gasps when the pain spikes as he starts to lower it, squeezing his eyes closed and breathing deeply through his nose as he tries to not let the pain defeat him.¬† He repeats the motion two more times before deciding that that‚Äôs enough for the time being, setting an alarm on his phone to remind him to do it again after lunch.
"Yeah, what do ya got for me, J?"
"He doesn't want to because all of his friends wait outside, babe," Dad said, glancing up from his tablet. "And we're usually here before he comes out anyway."
"I'm not worried about the hockey game, honey," Tony said with a sigh. "Or at least, not too worried. Thor pretty much single-handedly took out both of those semi-enhanced monsters that attacked Pete, so I'm pretty sure he'll be safe enough with him."
"I think I'm okay now, Mrs Rogers, if you wanna go back to sleep."
"I see." Mr Stacy gave Peter a rather ominous smile. "And therein lies the problem, I think. With no oversight, what's to stop the Avengers from adding enough members to their roster until they have their very own army, hmm? And then what? Us laypeople are just supposed to accept it while they go about their merry avenging business? You may think that the Avengers are like rock stars, that everybody out there just adores them, but son, I assure you that that's not the case. Captain Rogers, Dr Banner, and that Thor guy who shows up from time to time, they're all enhanced individuals, and who's to say there aren't more of 'em out there who would just as soon snap someone's neck like a twig than protect us from invading aliens. Don't you think we should be able to know who those people are?"
"Oh, you know, same old, same old," said Ned. "My dad and I went downtown so we could see the fireworks better, but other than that it was just crowded, cold, and noisy. You know, typical New York."
"Sounds good." Steve remembered all too well the hundreds of days and nights that he'd spent in that room, hooked up to his never-ending breathing treatments.
agreed Mr O'Carl. "
"Well, damn. If she can teach you to move like that, I might ask her for some ballet lessons myself!" Ned exclaimed. "You think she'd teach me if I asked her?"
"Hmm. She's kinda pretty though, don't you think?" Ned asked. "In a sort of classic, preppy kinda way."
Thor narrowed his eyes. "Yes, Agent Barton," he said grimly. "You most likely would."
Sucking in a deep breath, Steve turns to face Shostakov head on.¬† ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll survive without you,
‚ÄúMmm, fine,‚Äù grumbled Peter, sticking his bottom lip out.¬† ‚ÄúBut you're gonna come back tomorrow night, right, Steve?¬† Then you can even stay even later since you don't open till noon on Sunday!‚Äù
‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Steve cried, followed directly on its heels by a burst of such intense pain that he felt like his entire nervous system was overloading.¬† Chills raced down his spine, spreading down his limbs at a rapidly increasing rate, almost as though his very own heartbeat was fuelling them.
"I need to burn you into my memory, sweetheart," Steve said as he moved down the bed to Tony's feet, curling his fingers around his ankles and slowly gliding them up his legs as his lips followed in their path. "Need to remember every single dip and curve of your beautiful body, every single place that I've felt and touched and kissed. It's so cold out there in space,
Thankfully, both Dad and Papa were still otherwise occupied when Peter got back to the penthouse, so he was able to sneak back into his room without being spotted. Dad had been holed up in his lab ever since he'd gotten home from school, working furiously on the MAUDE glasses that he was hoping to have ready within the next week, and Papa was down in the gym for his late afternoon workout. Peter had noticed that he'd been spending even more time down there than usual since he and Dad had gotten back from D.C., which, given what he'd discovered while they were gone, didn't really surprise him.
There'd be no way that Tony would survive if he lost even one of his boys, much less both of them.
Steve let out a sharp gasp, curling even further into himself. To him, the word 'lost' or 'lose' were like curses, words meant to be spat, not spoken.
It hadn't taken long for Steve to realise that Peter was smart, especially since he had mentioned to Steve that for the past year he had been too sick to go to school, something he didn't seem to mind all that much. Aside from missing his friends, Peter had said that his classes had only bored him, and that he was learning far more from his father and grandfather than he ever did in school.
Uncle Bucky looked down at the floor, studying the tops of his shoes as his teeth worked over his bottom lip.
"Yeah, I guess I did. It'll hopefully mean that he'll sleep good though," Steve added, his warm breath on Tony's ear causing him to shiver. "Do you think we should suggest that he head to bed now?"
As if on cue, Tony came barely three strokes later, crying out his release into the warm African air as Steve buried his head in Tony's shoulder, his broad body shaking as his own climax washed over him. They laid there, with their sweaty, sated bodies intertwined, for a long time afterwards, exchanging soft kisses and caresses until Steve carefully lifted Tony into his arms and carried him into the bathroom, cleaning him as carefully as if he were made of glass.
"That was the mission you guys went on before the whole Project Insight mess, wasn't it?" Tony asked, pinching the bridge of his nose. He had been nursing a headache for the last several hours, and was well overdue for more coffee.
Steve attempted a smile, gripping his cracked bat with white knuckles. "Maybe next time, Buck, all right? I'll see you guys at dinner."
"Like a charm," said Tony. "She had me hold Pete against my chest so his ear was pressed right over my heart, and then she took this long piece of cloth and wrapped it around the two of us until he was as snug as a bug in a rug. And then he just sort of relaxed into me. I'd say it was less than three minutes later when he popped his tiny thumb into his mouth and fell asleep."
"Uhh," Tony said, cringing.
"Oh, sure! The fresh air'll probably help," Gwen said. "Or, at least as fresh as you can get in New York City. I'll go and get your stuff."
"Yeah, we'll see," Tony said, pursing his lips when Steve frowned at him. "Probably, honey, okay? Let me see what I've got to work with first, yeah? I wouldn't put it past Beck to have stomped those glasses of his to bits before he was kicked out of the building."
"Exactly." Tony opened his arms, letting out a slight shudder when Peter didn't hesitate to step into them. He buried his fingers into his sweet boy's curls, closing his eyes as the faint scent of green apples filled his nostrils.
"Just don't overwork yourself, okay?" Steve said gently. "Are you under guard?"
"Yes, sir," Steve answered firmly.
"You know, you can't really blame me, Anthony," Hammer said as he turned back around. "I mean, you went ahead and created a sword with untold possibilities and then tried to insist that it was only a shield, so at least I'm not a hypocrite, like you are. I built these suits to be an army, and an army they're gonna be!"
"I was gonna," Peter interrupted. "Sometime‚Ä¶ maybe when you weren't so busy."
it felt good.
"Are you sure?" Steve murmured against Tony's thigh, his eyes twinkling as he tapped Tony's prostate again. "I could just keep doing this, seems like you're enjoying it just fine."
Or rather,
It was just‚Ä¶ Tony just really wished that he wasn't there. If he‚Äîand Steve‚Äîhad had their way, Peter would be safely back at the Tower by now, surrounded by JARVIS, dozens of Happy's security guards, the best defence drones that Tony could build, and George Stacy. Not there with him on a barren rock of a planet, surrounded by a pack of bumbling idiots while they waited for their impending doom to arrive wearing a fancy, bejewelled glove.
A huge thank-you to my awesome betas, allthesinnersandallthesaints and jehbeeeh.  This story wouldn‚Äôt have been the same without you! üíú üíú
"Like that, yeah?" he said as he curled Steve's fingers around both their cocks. "Feel good?"
So he simply burrowed closer, smiling contentedly as Steve kissed his forehead.
A nod that clearly said,
"Don't you fucking
"Okay, so‚Ä¶ what happens afterwards?" asked Cam. "Once you and Carol get done deploying all your stuff, what then?"
"And you didn't smell it beforehand?" asked Uncle Bruce. "Usually you're pretty good about that."
"And so, what's the endpoint here?" the student had asked, confused. "If he's still deteriorating on his current treatments, then what are his goals of therapy?"
About a thousand different emotions crossed Steve's gorgeous eyes in the span of a second or two.
"Dad, I'm pretty sure that Papa's being held somewhere that you can only get to by helicopter."
Tony was quiet for several heartbeats, his skinny body way too still. "Just‚Ä¶ go away, Steve," he finally muttered. "I just‚ÄîI need to be alone. It's how I'm best."
"My King!" cried General Okoye as she rushed forward, only to be repelled in the same way. Steve was next, managing to knock Thanos' arm away with his shield just long enough to take a swing at his head. The blow was as strong as Steve could deliver, but it barely even registered with Thanos as he drew back his own right fist, punching Steve so hard across the face that for a moment he blacked out. He came to in a rush, barely able to blink his eyes open against the harsh white light beaming down from the tops of the trees.
Nothing more than a nightmare.
‚ÄúSince the second you stepped inside the store looking like you were going on a date,‚Äù Peter shot back.¬† ‚ÄúWhich you haven‚Äôt been on in at least five years, by the way.¬† And no, sleeping with the
"The Planck Scale is a set of universal limits that govern the laws of physics," explained Bruce. "It basically means that what you say you went through doesn't abide by those laws, and that not even the particles themselves abide by those laws."
"Yeah," Tony whispered. "I think all three of us have."
And Tony, being the incredible man that he was, instead of berating Steve for waking him or tearing the hell out of his expensive designer sheets, had simply gathered Steve close, holding his head against his chest as he ran his fingers through his hair.¬† Once Steve had felt able to release the iron grip on his limbs, Tony had led him into the bathroom, right into the hot bath that JARVIS had run for them.¬† They‚Äôd ended up staying in the steaming water so long that Steve fell asleep, his back pressed up against Tony‚Äôs chest and his head resting against Tony‚Äôs neck, not waking until JARVIS announced that it was time for Peter to get to school.
"Come here," he murmured, wrapping his arms around his husband and practically crushing him to his chest. "I'm so sorry, mo gr√°. I didn't‚ÄîI haven't been thinking, and I'm‚Äî"
"Okay, but we should wait until Tony wakes up," Steve said quickly. "I don't want him to miss anything."
Papa's face flushed even pinker. "Of course, little guy," he said. "Where do you want me to stand?"
"Why don't we just let Mr Stark finish his presentation, hmm?" Phillips cut in from his perch in the corner. "I know you're all chomping at the bit to get up in one of these things, but dare I say that you might wanna learn a bit more about 'em first? Because these cost way too damn much for any of you to assume that you know what you're doing, which you sure as hell
That they were always better together, no matter what.
And Tony had no choice but to believe him.
"Tony‚Äî"
"Are you thinking that someone had it in for your papa?" asked Tony. "Some kind of sick revenge thing or something?"
‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, Tony,‚Äù Papa said with a chuckle.¬† ‚ÄúI don't need any stuffed animals with me.‚Äù
"Probably only had to once," said Bucky. "That's all Stevie ever has to read anything, the lucky bastard."
"Goodnight, buddy."
Then again, based on everything he'd heard about Wakanda and their tech, Steve supposed he couldn't be too surprised. The shield tucked securely next to his legs on the floor was only a tiny example of the effectiveness of the Wakandan technology, and it had been good enough to cushion his leap from over twenty stories up.
"Shh, baby," Tony whispered as he tangled his fingers into Steve's hair, tugging Steve's head back down to his shoulder. He was convinced that there was nothing hotter during sex than hearing sweet nothings spoken in Irish with a Brooklyn accent. "It's okay, Steve. I'm right here."
Completely and utterly failed in his most important duty as a parent.
"All right," he said as Peter joined him in the living room, ready to go. "You've got everything, right? Glasses? Earplugs? Snacks?"
"Well, then it's a good thing I'm here," Steve said. He tapped his palm on the counter, returning Sharon's smile. "Thanks, Sharon."
"Yes, sir."
of Thor's giant axe as it flew down the light beam towards Thanos, and the sickening
If only his arms had been strong enough to hold onto them.
"Yeah, it is, since the big guy and I will need it to make similar suits for the rest of us," said Tony. "I'll have JARVIS start on a couple spares right away."
With a final kiss, Steve headed down the hall towards his locker room. Tony watched him go until he disappeared around the corner, then unlocked his office door and stepped inside, booting up his computer.
"Mmm," muttered Peter. "Well‚Ä¶ she is really smart, and nice, and she's definitely pretty, and‚Äî"
I'm just not strong, honey, not like you, and I can't‚ÄîI can barely even think about it, much less wanna actually hear it, so‚Äî"
at you the wrong way, then I swear I'm gonna‚Äî"
"But if you don't mind, I'd appreciate it if you could cancel my alarm for the morning," he added. It had been over three weeks since he'd taken a morning off from running, and despite his blatant attempts to ignore it, his left foot was definitely starting to notice.
Thank you so much to my awesome betas allthesinnersandthesaints and jehbeeeh! üíñ
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh, Christ, Steve, you always please me," Tony whispered. "You don't‚Äîyou don't have to do anything‚Äî"
"Like fire," Wanda said, sniffing. "Like my very blood had turned into molten lava." She shot him a quizzical look. "You know of this?"
Intellectually, Steve supposed he could understand why Colonel Phillips chose to keep his emergency plan for Peter a secret from Tony, knowing how Tony would react to the necessity of Howard's involvement. With the colonel being aware of the lack of a qualified paediatric heart surgeon since even before Peter's admission, Steve knew it couldn't have been easy for him to keep that information from Tony, to silently watch as Tony clung desperately to the hope that once they got Project Phoenix up and running, Peter would be fine. Colonel Phillips having a front-row seat to the deconstruction of Howard Stark and the subsequent breakdown of Tony's relationship with Howard couldn't have been very easy either, especially since he knew exactly how Howard was set up to take the fall in the first place.
Rhodey gave a short nod. "Yeah. Exactly."
"You sure I wouldn't be takin' you away from your schoolwork?" Uncle Bucky asked after a short pause.
While they had not been celibate in the nine weeks since the sucess of Project Phoenix, their busy schedules combined with helping Peter adjust to everything had often left them too exhausted to do much more than collapse into each other's arms at the end of the day, hoping that Peter would be able to sleep through the night.
"You mean his father's reputation," Steve insisted. "The one that's been hanging over his head for most of his life?"
"Master Peter," JARVIS suddenly said as he swung towards the next building. "May I inquire as to what you are doing?"
Which seemed to be most of the time lately.
Peter squeezed his eyes closed, trying to keep the tears contained. "Yeah, I can. I'm sorry, Dad."
"Oh, yeah, bud, that makes sense," said Tony. "And you're already packed, right?"
News traveled fast in a free society, apparently.
Which was good, since Steve honestly wasn't sure
Because
But that didn't mean that he couldn't.
The entire drive to the bookstore, Tony had been psyching himself up for telling Steve about what happened, preparing to ask him to accompany Tony to Obie‚Äôs office sometime in the next week and inform Obie that there was no way they were going to bow to such disgusting demands.
Steve chuckled, his cheeks flushing pink like they always did whenever Tony complimented him.
"Honey, I don't know‚Äî"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Tony, hold on! Tell me what's wrong!" Steve said as propped himself up on his elbow, his other arm tightening around Tony's waist. His disheveled blond hair was sticking up in all directions, and he had such an adorable
And as such, he really had no idea what to tell Peter's worried girlfriend about his condition. Steve had spoken to her the last time that she'd called, telling her that Peter had been diagnosed with mononucleosis and was taking a nap, and would speak to her as soon as possible. But that had been three days ago, and as smart as the Stacy girl was, she likely wasn't going to buy another story of Peter conveniently napping every single time she tried to call. Ned had called a couple of times too, but since he still remembered when Peter was the scrawny, sickly kid he used to be before his enhancements kicked in, he was a bit easier to brush off.
Fighting the urge to jump for joy, Tony raised his other arm and planted his right leg slightly behind him, assuming his usual repulsor firing position.
And all because of him.
"Only when it'd be time to eat," Tony said with a laugh. "And you just better watch it,
Steve snorted as he grinned. "Well, then I guess you'll just have to take a shower with me. Is Peter still down with Thor and Bucky?"
‚Ä¶ my eyes, they were
Tony sniffed, contemplating.¬† ‚ÄúOkay, so you think HYDRA‚Äôs been behind all the instability in the region over the years?‚Äù He asked.
"Copy that, Phoenixes Two and Three," said Tony. "All Phoenix aircraft, you have a go. Captain Rogers, it's your call."
Doctor List laughed, a sound that while under different circumstances might‚Äôve been innocuous enough, only served to reinforce the million-watt pain coursing through Steve‚Äôs body.¬† Against his will, he let out a groan, clenching his hands into such tight fists that a bolt of pain shot across both sets of knuckles.
"He's just having some bad dreams, Peter," Papa said, rather despondently. "Nothing new, just‚Ä¶ a bit more often lately. I'm making sure that he's talking about them with Sam, though."
And then, as he took his seat at that table, flanked by his husband and son as he looked out onto the rest of his amazing teammates, Steve raised his bottle of his favourite Irish beer, waiting while they all took hold of their own various beverages.
"That's all I'm asking, honey," Tony whispered. "Thank you."
"Beating ourselves up over what ifs never helps anything, right?" Steve cut in. "Isn't that what Sam's always telling us?"
Buckling his mask over his face, Steve glanced down at his drawing, sucking in as deep of a breath as he could.
"Love you too, Dad."
"Okay, now that's just not fair!" Peter cried as the monster swung again, this time landing an uppercut that slammed Peter flat against the sand, knocking all the air from his lungs in one fell swoop.
Carefully, Steve hefted Peter off the bed, letting him test his wobbly legs a bit before releasing him to walk to the bathroom with Tony's help. At least they didn't have to worry about Peter losing as much of his muscle mass this time around since he was only asleep for a few days instead of several weeks. That would hopefully help both he and Steve recover a bit faster.
"It's okay, Uncle Bucky," Peter said softly. He hopped down from his chair, taking Bucky's hand and leading him over to the hologram, pointing to the offending dust. "See? Dad's already found the problem. You've just got some dust stuck down there, which is really easy to fix. Right, Dad?"
"Yikes," Scott said, wincing. "That‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ that really sucks."
Has Tony ever seen such an incredible, gorgeously round ass in his entire life?
Peter thought.
‚ÄúYeah, let‚Äôs hope,‚Äù said Tony as he accepted a quick shoulder clap from Colonel Rhodes.¬† Then he handed the colonel the papers he got from Pepper, waving at them dismissively.¬† ‚ÄúYou wanna look through those right quick?¬† Make sure nothing‚Äôs missing?‚Äù
Steve's heart was thudding madly, his mind racing to come up with any other possible solution than the one Tony had just suggested.
"No, I'm afraid not," Steve said gently. He glanced over at Tony, who simply shrugged. "I'm wondering if it's because he was killed before the snap?"
And little did Tony know just what kind of rollercoaster they were stepping on. One that over four years later, still hadn't stopped.
he thought, repeating the words that Sam had suggested to him whenever he was feeling overwhelmed.
"Oh," Steve said on a gasp as Tony kicked off his shoes and carefully climbed onto the narrow bed, laying his head down on top of Steve's chest as Steve's heavy left arm settled across his waist. As soon as he was in place, it was like the weight of the world was suddenly lifted from Steve's back, and he found himself so overwhelmed that he could barely breathe.
it! Mr Beck just finished putting the final touches on it only this morning, so why don't we get him into position, all right?"
"Tony‚Äî"
"All right. And then you were immediately sent overseas to recover Mr Stark and his son?"
"It'll be like Bruce said," said Steve. "They'll come for all of us."
And he also knew that once he explained the mission to Steve, he would go along with it without hesitation. Steve loved Peter so much, there was no way he would say no to a mission that Peter had specifically designed to better their entire planet.
Ned's eyes were wide as he watched Mr Harrington disappear out of the gym. "Wow. You gotta wonder sometimes, don't you?"
Instinctively, Steve grinned. "You're damn right I am. Gotta get 'em broken in, right?"
And, which also meant that Dad had no idea where they'd taken Papa or what they were going to do with him. An attempt to trace the licence plate of the agents' car had led to a dead end, and there was no way for JARVIS to trace the location of the answering service either, as the phone number was being routed through about a zillion different relays. JARVIS was working on it, of course, but since HYDRA was likely changing the relay locations on a real-time basis it probably would turn out to be just another dead end.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to finally see this amazing place in person,‚Äù Steve said as he kissed Tony again.¬† ‚ÄúThank you, sweetheart.‚Äù
Once again the sceptre flashed, even brighter and longer than before. Image Peter's cries of pain were getting quieter, his strength starting to falter.
"What? Why?" demanded Quill. "I don't need you to keep any eyes on me! I'm still not even sure that I like you!"
It was too much for Tony to even contemplate. Even now, wrapped tightly in his husband's arms with Steve's strong heartbeat beneath his ear, there was a tiny part of him that still believed that all of this was just one big, elaborate dream, and that someday he would simply wake up and it would all be gone. That the last four-plus years since Steve found he and Peter near death in the middle of the Afghanistan desert had all been nothing more than something he had made up in his overactive imagination.
Peter inhaled a deep breath before opening the door to find a very concerned Gwen holding an ice pack, a towel, and a handful of wrapped peppermint candies. Peter immediately jumped back, clapping his hand over his mouth and barely managing to avoid lurching again.
"Cap, be advised there's another tank on the south side of the building," Sam said. "And it's still firing."
"–ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ —Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ," Bucky said with a nod. Then he gave Peter's head a final pat and excited the bathroom.
For all of Tony's nervousness, the dinner went remarkably smoothly. Sarah had prepared one of Steve's favourite meals, some kind of sausage and noodle dish along with some homemade bread that wasn't like anything that Tony had ever eaten before, but tasted absolutely amazing. Whoever it was that ran the mess hall at the barracks had absolutely nothing on Sarah Rogers.
Steve shook his head in amusement as he headed down the hallway towards the bedroom. Peter was so much like Tony. So much so that Steve felt like he frequently got little glimpses of what Tony could've been like as a teen if he'd had a more supportive home life. While Tony had told Steve that he'd adored his mother, his father, Howard, was at best a distant and neglectful father and at worst emotionally‚Äîand occasionally physically‚Äîabusive. And, based on what Tony had told Steve about his mother, it honestly seemed to Steve that she hadn't been the most attentive parent either, often leaving Tony solely in the care of the family's butler, Mr Jarvis, the man who had inspired Tony to create his UI.
"Can I help you, sir?" asked the cadet overseeing the computer lab as soon as Steve stepped inside. She had shot to her feet so fast upon seeing Steve that she'd bumped into her desk, the resulting scraping noise on the polished linoleum floor sending a shiver down Steve's spine. He'd always hated that sound.
"Okay, but then what was the purpose of the attack?" asked Sam. "And why hasn't anyone claimed it yet?"
As Peter had pointed out way too many times in the past for Tony to keep track, he tended to have a blind spot when it came to Obie, and for something this gargantuan, he simply could not afford to have any impairments in his vision.¬† No matter how small.
"And turned into Winter Soldiers," Steve finished. "Or whatever these new things are called."
"Yeah, well, he's not here right now, is he!" Dad cried. He let out a sharp gasp like he was in pain, pressing his palm to his chest where Papa's dog tags were hidden underneath his shirt. "And until I can figure out exactly where those goddamn assholes have taken him, I don't see the point to‚Äî!"
"And I'm not trying to baby you either," Steve cut in, raising an eyebrow when Tony opened his mouth to protest. "But if there is a risk, you know I'm less likely to be affected by it."
"Um‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ sometimes it does get a little weird," Peter said, which wasn't even a lie. He felt Gwen squeeze his hand, giving hers a squeeze in return. "But you know, they're all pretty cool, so‚Äî"
"That's right," Steve said as he grabbed the teakettle, filling it with water. He'd always preferred hot tea over coffee, with peppermint tea being his absolute favourite. But ever since Peter's odd reaction to some peppermint ice cream a few weeks before the Battle of New York, Steve had switched to drinking cinnamon tea instead, and had grown quite fond of it.
"JARVIS, what's Pete up to?" he asked. "He still awake?"
"Um, did you say,
"You know I don't mind," Tony said with a frown. "But I have to say, you seem particularly concerned about this, so‚Ä¶ should I know why?"
And also one of the most rewarding.¬† It had been so long that Tony had pitched anything to anyone outside of the military that he‚Äôd almost forgotten how much of a rush it was to actually see the skepticism seeping from the eyes of his audience, watch as their faces transformed from their ‚Äúyou're outta your fucking mind‚Äù expressions to the more work-withable ‚Äúhmm, that actually sounds kinda interesting.‚Äù
"T-Tony!" Steve rasped, groaning as a fresh wave of dizziness slammed right into his chest. It was a good thing his stomach was empty, or James would probably be wearing its contents already. "Is he‚Äîis he‚Äî?"
"All right, then you're still our son, our boy, if you will," said Papa. "And I don't know if anything that we say will help you see it from our perspective, but please, just try, okay? We've already come so close to losing you so many times, little guy, and I suppose that tends to skew our view of things, but that's only because we love you so much and it would kill us both to have anything happen to you."
Tony tilted his head as he looked up into his husband's gorgeous sea-blue eyes. "Three years ago I might've thought it was just a coincidence, but now‚Äî"
"We'll see, okay?" Steve kissed the top of Peter's head, squeezing him one final time. "I love you, Peter. I'll see you this afternoon."
"Yeah, but I'm sure if I'd really wanted to, I could've figured something out. Some way to stop making weapons long before Pete and I nearly got blown to kingdom come," said Tony. "I just didn't try hard enough."
"Yeah, call me Tony," said Tony. "And from what Pete's told us, with how hard Miss Stacy's been drilling them, I doubt there's any way they can lose."
"No, no, I don't think that's necessary," said Steve. The less radiation that Peter was exposed to, the better. "I trust your judgment, Dr Cho. If you say he's healing like he should be, then that's good enough for me."
Peter sighed, allowing his stiff body to relax against Papa's as Dad kissed the top of his head. "Papa said all that a lot better than I could've, Pete," Dad said quietly. "All we want is what's best for you, and you know that you're more than a bit biased here."
he said with a wink. "Glad I don't have to worry about losing you once you get up there."
Steve grinned, guzzling down the rest of his Powerade. Peter knew how to make himself a more substantial breakfast than cold cereal, but, like his father, he was often too sleepy or too distracted in the mornings to reach for anything other than his usual.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh yeah," Steve answered, without hesitation. "Yeah, everything's fine, I just‚Äîjust give me a couple minutes, okay?"
he thought, gritting his teeth as he tried to psyche himself up.¬† Peter had a big debate competition coming up in the next month, the first such competition Steve would get to watch him participate in.
"Damn, baby," Tony breathed once they broke apart. "It's too bad you have to go and cook now, huh?"
He didn't have much time left, which was why he needed to find out what happened as soon as possible.
"All right, JARVIS," he said as he took a big sip of coffee. "Let's do this."
But most of all, remembering the time that they did have with him, and trying‚Äîtrying so damn
what you're talking about!‚Äù he said through clenched teeth.¬† ‚ÄúAnd if you think I‚Äôm gonna stand here any longer and let you‚Äî‚Äù
"But how the hell does a cocky-as-hell surgeon survive an accident that should've killed him and somehow come out of it a wizard?" Tony wondered as he approached what appeared to be a platform suspended about two stories up from the bowels of the ship. The last thing he'd heard about Dr Strange was that the injured doctor had sold all of his possessions and fled to East Asia, probably in search of the cure that had eluded him in Western medicine.
Steve thought. "Okay, then, maybe some food?" he asked. "When was the last time you ate something?"
Peter thought, cringing.
"And, as much as it
"Nope, you sure didn't!" Dad shot back. "'Cause I didn't ask!"
"Yeah, that's normal," Tony replied, his hands settling into their usual spots on Steve's biceps. "It took me a few tries to get used to mine too, and you know Pete's still working out the kinks in his, so‚Ä¶" He paused then, chewing nervously on his bottom lip. "You're still gonna try to get used to it though, right?"
"That is correct, Agent Romanoff," said JARVIS. "Mr Lang was reported as missing by his former wife, approximately one month following the snap."
Peter had done it. He had managed to rebuild JARVIS.
"What we've got to do right now is go and talk to Thor, Tony," Steve said. "Natasha said it's urgent."
"See? There ya go," said Tony. "I'm sure between the two of us we'll be able to convince him."
(See the end of the chapter for
And apparently, a criminal who was helping to steal stuff from Damage Control, both from the inside and by attacking the convoys.
"There," Tony said cheekily once they finally broke apart, flushed and panting. "See what you get when you listen to me?"
"Good idea, Captain Barnes," said Anthony. "Now, you might've noticed in the X-302 flight manuals that those aircraft are using a brand-new power source that not only is far lighter and less noisy than conventional jet fuel, but also semi-renewable."

There was a brief pause for a moment while O'Brien contemplated Steve, looking him up and down as though he were inspecting his uniform cleanliness.
‚ÄúYou needed to see me, sir?‚Äù she said once she‚Äôd stepped inside, her ever-present clipboard clutched in her perfectly manicured left hand.

"Of that I have no doubt," Sam said with the slightest of smiles. "Thanks."

"Goddamnit!" Bucky exclaimed through Tony's headset. "I thought for sure that I had it!"
, Peter thought as he drifted off, only to be awakened three seconds later‚Äîor so it seemed‚Äîby his phone alarm, the sun barely visible through the fog in the distance. It was time to catch his boat.
"Protect the stone!" Steve heard T'Challa call into his comm as he landed across the river, followed immediately by a burst of purple energy that took out at least five of the war dogs. "Shuri, make sure the stone is protected!"
They aren‚Äôt usually this bad.
"You know Davis is just a first-class asshole, babe," Tony said after they had walked in silence for almost three blocks, his hand tucked securely into the crook of Steve's elbow. Tony's brown eyes were hidden behind one of his many pairs of sunglasses, but Steve didn't need to see them to know how much hurt they were carrying. Like Steve, Tony always took any jab at his loved ones very personally, and Davis's remarks about him had been about as low as Steve had ever heard.
Not exactly an easy task, especially since thanks to the above-mentioned strangling, Thanos was now in possession of the Time Stone.
But one that could still come true, if he wasn't prepared.
"Okay, so‚Ä¶ then where'd he get such cool tech?" Peter asked.
It was extremely frustrating for him, and for Steve and Tony as well, being unable to help him.
Peter's heart clenched as he reached for Gwen's face, brushing a tear from her cheek. "I'm sorry, Gwen, but I have to go. Once you find your dad, you guys head straight to the Tower, okay? Tell your mom to bring your brothers there too. You'll be much safer there."
"Anyway," he said after a short pause, holding up his camera. "Is it okay if I take a couple pictures of you? Some before-the-wedding pictures?"
"Goddamnit, Steve, you don't need to be talking like that," Dad muttered into Papa's chest. "You're gonna scare the kid."
The light flashed again, another direct hit. Over and over, every single command that popped into Tony's mind, the suit obeyed. From forming whatever defensive and offensive weapon he could think of to constructing protective shields and barriers in a fraction of a second, in over ten minutes of continuous testing, the suit didn't make one single mistake.
Tony smirked.¬† That was something that Mr Jarvis used to say to Tony at least once a day, right up until the day he died.
Tony gave an almost imperceptible flinch, prompting Steve to squeeze his shoulder. "Thank you, Mr Stacy," he said in his Captain's voice. "We appreciate that very much."
"Which we both know that we would never use unless we had absolutely no other choice." Steve pressed a kiss to Tony's forehead, then tipped his head back, eyeing him intently. "If it'll help us sleep better at night, sweetheart, then I'm okay with it. Peter deserves to feel safe in his own home, and that includes all of our land up at the Compound as well."
The fact that Peter was unconscious, sedated, and chemically paralysed so as not to fight against the ventilator as it breathed for him was only a very small consolation.
And besides that, he was hungry.
Wanda gave a nod, twisting her arm as the window of Steve's cell disintegrated and he began to move against his will, led into a huge square area that was as big as a baseball stadium, with a ceiling at least five stories high.
Which it was. Less than a minute and only a few commands later, Peter had once again broken into the main Air Corps database.
"Well, great. That's a comfort."
But unfortunately Dad and Papa didn't see it that way, and Peter just didn't have the heart to disobey them again, as much as he was tempted to sometimes.
"No, it's really
"You didn't tell me this movie was gonna be so sad!" she whispered into his arm, flinching as yet another one of the Rebels was shot by an enemy Stormtrooper.
"It‚Äîit was, but‚Äî"
"Just as soon as there's room in the kitchen," said Steve.
"Yes," Gwen said, nodding rapidly. "I'd love to dance with you."
Steve gave a single nod. "I understand. I'll‚ÄîI'll be here once you're ready. Just let me know."
"Quite well, sir," answered JARVIS. "I have not currently found any flaws in Master Peter's design."
"It was a great shot, Buck," said Rogers.
And the hours were starting to pass faster and faster.
‚ÄúGood afternoon, Mr Stark,‚Äù the bespectacled Chairman in the poorly-tailored suit said as he popped onto the screen.¬† ‚ÄúSo, what do you have for us today?‚Äù
"I'm pretty sure you're right," said Sam. "Now, if we're all done talking here, I'm ready to get going."
‚ÄúOhh,‚Äù he rasps as his blood pressure suddenly takes a nosedive.¬† He immediately rolls onto his side and squeezes his eyes closed, breathing in through his nose as he tries to staunch the raging flood of pain and nausea threatening to overtake him.
Grandma smiled as she set the tray aside. "And I highly doubt that it's a lot of fun for you to be sitting here, hooked up to all that stuff, hmm?"
That had been a particularly bad night. Peter didn't know exactly how many punching bags Papa went through after that conversation, but he was pretty sure it was all of them since his hands were all bandaged up the next morning and Dad was in one of his deep brooding moods, one Peter had a feeling wasn't only because of the campaign funding discovery. There was something else going on too, something that they hadn't bothered to share with Peter yet, and it bugged him to no end.
