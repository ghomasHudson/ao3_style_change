"I did not throw the debate!"
"Cas! Thank God!" Cas hardly has time to check the room before Sam is launching himself at him, babbling a mile a minute. "This moron is trying to make me pee in a cup in front of him, and I've already explained that Lucifer won't appreciate that, so then he grabbed my arm and threatened me and said no one will believe me, but you believe me, don't you Cas?"
"I'm sorry. That was a stupid joke. I knew it might make you uncomfortable."
He troops up to the bathroom, carrying a huge pitcher of ice with him that he filled with ice from the fridge. Thank goodness they have an ice maker, because otherwise Cas doesn't know what he would do. Spontaneously combust into a puddle of sweat, possibly. He continues lugging ice up the stairs. It takes what feels like a century to fill the tub with ice. He stands back, surveying the tub with pride for a moment, before he strips his boxers off and steps into the ice bath. He stays in until the ice melts, which is much less time than he had hoped for, and crawls out still feeling like a marshmallow being toasted over a campfire.
'Dear Lucifer,
"And if it never comes back?"
John walks by, smacking Cas on the back. "Good to see you again, Castiel. Sam, when you get a moment I'd like to speak to you and your brother in private. Tomorrow, though, not today. I have something important to do now." He approaches Mary, holding one hand out to her. "Will you come with me? I would like to tell you several things."
"That's your baby's heartbeat, Mr. Winchester."
"Not a problem. Bobby and I had fun with the first one, and I think building on a second piece should be much easier."
"What? I was going to say tongue," Sam says, but his eyes are gleaming and Cas knows he's lying.
"It just makes me feel terrible inside, Dean. Like, I lived thirteen years of my life and had no idea that my parents thought he was a mistake. Do you think he knows I don't feel the same way?"
"All right, all right, enough," Michael orders. "We're going to a wedding, we're expected to behave." He grabs them all and transports them back to the hotel.
*Current time*
"Brave," Aurora comments.
"I suspected," Bobby admits.
"Five minutes starts now," Azazel tells him cheerily.
Dean blinks his eyes open. Seconds ago there had been pain. He remembers being impaled, the pain of it slicing through his stomach and out the other end. He remembers comforting Sammy, and then he had closed his eyes.
"That being dead hasn't changed Zachariah at all?"
"Body inadequacy," Balthazar stage-whispers. "Since we're twins. But you'll obviously realize I'm the better-looking twin if I strip."
Sam cracks a smile at that. "Who healed me?"
Sam smirks. "This is so awkward. What do the both of you want from me?" He stares down Lucifer first, making it clear the older angel will be participating in this discussion too.
"Shark! No shark, no bite me!"
Sam shrugs again, unwilling to commit to an answer. "You ran away really fast then came back and you were bleeding. I was a little worried. What happened?"
"Gabriel. A slap to the butt is nowhere near the same plane as sex."
"Do too!"
"Doubtless," drolls Gabriel.
"Maybe you should apologize again."
A hand touches Sam's shoulder. He grins up at Adam, but feels the smile practically melt off his face when he realizes John is with him. "It'll be fine," Adam says, "and if not we'll go help him, whether we're allowed to or not."
"Yeah, sure. Help yourself. The glasses are next to the microwave," Uriel says, trying to figure out where Cas is.
"Yeah. Okay, yeah." Cas impulsively pecks Dean's lips, then rests his head on Dean's shoulder.
"Sam, there- oh. Am I interrupting something?" Michael asks, frozen in the doorway.
Cas blinks as he processes this. Apparently, that should've made sense. Maybe... nope. He still doesn't get it. "I don't understand that reference."
"Since the time you were born."
B: 'Did you call Dean?'
"Oh."
"Luce-"
"I care! If we don't do this right, we can't redo it!" Michael runs a hand over his face in frustration. "Just get back to the hotel," he orders before vanishing again.
"Hi. I brought in the rest of the groceries and closed the trunk for you."
Jess and he hug, and when they finally separate she says, "Remember what I said. Talk to Lucifer."
"No," Sam decides, but then he taps Balthazar's foot as the owner returns with their drinks. Balthazar wisely falls silent.
"And let your brother know I don't blame him for not realizing I was in danger. He came to my grave to apologize on the one year anniversary of you jumping into the Cage."
"He's tired, Sam. He's overworked, overwhelmed, and he just saw his best friend who he hasn't seen in years- his best friend who, last time they talked, said he didn't want to be friends. We didn't tell him we were coming, and maybe we overwhelmed him. Maybe he's shocked and overtired and couldn't win that debate for those reasons."
Lucifer, in the meantime, has spotted the children. "No!" he exclaims as he sets eyes on Ben. "No way, no how. I did not sign up for this, no sir. I don't even like Dean that much, I am not doing mini-Dean care. Huh-uh."
"But see, Cas and I did kiss. We didn't need to have sex because we were kids. And now that we're old enough we still don't because we promised Michael we wouldn't. And we didn't have money for a honeymoon, so we didn't have one. But we did run away to Boston together, so that's got to count for something."
"You didn't even try it, Samshine," Gabriel says as he grabs a spoon and offers Sam a bite. Sam tries it, then repeats, "Yuck."
"Gabriel's mourning his mate's injuries," Cas answers. "He's letting the Host know his mate has been badly hurt."
"Heal me then," Sam says, turning toward Lucifer.
Sam makes a scandalized face. "People eat there!"
The angels are still standing there when Sam turns around, and he's still ignoring them, so he ducks out the door without saying anything. He brandishes his knife as he tiptoes down the stairs, then falls to the ground as Dean and Cas finally enter, distracting Baldur so Sam can sneak by. He bounces to his feet again, knife ready as he sneaks into the kitchen.
A crash announces Dean's victory, but Sam didn't see how it happened thanks to Lucifer's yanking on him. Inias grabs his blade, says something with a smile to Dean, and exits.
Sam blinks at it hazily. "You'll have to do better. I was tortured by Lucifer and Michael."
"And you left it consume you."
Sam shrugs helplessly. "I haven't gotten that far yet."
"Sweet dreams, my darling Omega," Lucifer calls after him. In the silence of his own apartment he whispers, "I hope you dream of me."
"It's okay. I love you," Sam whispers back, and then the words that he realizes are even more important, "I forgive you. I don't blame you. Not for Phobos, not for the Apocalypse. I forgive you. I love you."
"A banner, some streamers, maybe a balloon or two. Dean won't want much. Most of the money for our birthday gift will be the food."
"Lucifer, Sam! How's Lucifer?"
"I'm sure he does, Cas."
"No way. And neither of you are going to tell them, either. I don't want to make a big deal out of it."
"Lisa's dead?" Dean repeats.
"For what it's worth, I believe you will come to discover that my son has changed a lot in his time in the Cage, Dean."
"Yeah. So I called Dean and asked to stay with him. He said I can't, because he and Cas don't have space with the babies, but that he could drop me off here. He was sure you wouldn't mind."
"How are you doing, Cassie?" Balthazar asks as they sit down. Rowena has already plated everyone's pizza slices, and she's finishing with their drinks.
"No, you didn't. Lucifer did."
"You could sound a little more excited, at least. It's been six years," Balthazar drawls in a thick British accent.
"Your singing sounds horrible."
Gabriel asks, "Where did you find these?"
Cas rolls his eyes. "Hide out while you can. Michael will expect us by his side once we're in charge of heaven."
"Did you tell Kali that?"
Sam shrugs helplessly. "We had sex all night two nights ago, and most of the day. I didn't sleep then. And last night I got an hour before I was woken up with that nightmare or prophetic vision or whatever telling me I had demon blood."
"Dean, dude, you sound awful," Sam tells him with a small smile. His brother still looks like a walking corpse swaying on his feet, and his gaze is still unfocused, but he's spoken, and that's more than Sam's heard for at least a week.
Sam yanks back and stares at her, shocked. "What?!"
"Well, nobody says you have to intern with him. You could learn a bit then request a different doctor to intern under, if you wanted."
She jumps up from the bed, pulling the blanket with her to cover her nudity. In doing so, she uncovers Balthazar, who is also- Sam holds up his hand to block him from view. He does not need to see that, especially not from his Alpha's twin. He tries to block the thoughts of knots and knot sizes from his mind as easily.
"You don't look good."
"Hear hear," Lucifer agrees, lifting his cup of soda in the air with a laugh. "I could not do it."
"Brother?" Cas echoes. "But Sam-"
Sam reels his fiance in for a kiss, breathes, "I trust you. Trust yourself," against his lips, and brings Phobos back. For the moment, it's his worst fear.
Cas begins leading Sam toward the alter. "Michael said he wants it put up over here. He wants to stand by the windows so that the sun comes in as it's coming up tomorrow and hits us."
"Oh really? I'm sorry, did you spend centuries talking about you with him? Because I certainly did. Newsflash: he loves you. It was enough to make me jealous, listening to him go on and on about how much he liked you. He was in love with the idea of you before he ever met you."
"Okay, okay. We'll figure it out together, okay? We'll go back and do some more research."
"Sammy, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy-" Dean singsongs, before morphing into "a little bit of Sammy in my life/ a little bit of Sammy by my side/ a little bit of Sammy's all I need/ a little bit of Sammy's what I see/ a little bit of Sammy in the sun/ a little bit of Sammy all night long/ a little bit of Sammy, here I am/ a little bit of Sammy makes Dean his man."
"I'm just so angry all the time," Sam says, apropos of nothing. "I feel like I can't help it, and yet I also feel like I have no reason to feel this way."
"Yeah, but it'll probably be the last time we can ever do this. Our last hunt ended before we even realized it-"
"I don't know. I'll go look real quick-"
"I'm not!" Sam pouts, crossing his arms.
"I'm sorry, do you two know each other?" Lucifer asks.
Sam nods excitedly. "Probably. I was thinking of criminal law-"
Michael takes the box and tosses it against the wall. It ricochets off and lands somewhere unseen, hopefully to never see the light of day with a baby brother in his room. "I know, okay? I know. Just- just go to the bathroom, and then we'll talk."
Lucifer grabs his phone, heading to the waiting room. "Hey Michael," he says as soon as his brother picks up, "I need you."
"Dean-" Claire begins, but Dean interrupts.
Balthazar hands Dean his blade. Instantly Michael is there, hand on Dean's wrist. "Do. Not," he orders tersely. "I'm having enough trouble with people wanting to kill you, don't add to it." He turns a glare on Sam next. "You too."
"Shall we go before Dean eats all the desserts?" Gabriel asks.
"You look pathetic, Winchester," Meg tells him teasingly as she walks into the lounge. "False contractions?"
Sam nods. "He's planning to come back once I graduate from high school. They all are, including Balthazar, or so he says. Then we'll talk about the possibility of mating."
"You better not get that in the bed," Lucifer tells him.
"Take Sam with you!"
"Um, sometimes, I guess? I dunno. It's only ever been Kali for me, and I guess she's fairly proportional."
"Like who?" Seeing Lucifer's expression, Sam hurries on, "C'mon, Luce! Just tell me one example, and I'll research the rest!"
"Then we're all going out some time while we're here, and I'm paying."
"That section of the paper was more for those of us who do not have cars, mainly me and my brothers, but Sam as well. You and Castiel can go along to offer your opinion," Michael reassures him.
Dean wraps his arms around Cas again and says, "Listen to me," and Cas does, because it's impossible not to when Dean's words are literally vibrating against his own chest. "You are more important to me than any object, including that ring. If you really had lost it, that would be okay. You're so much more valuable than that."
He can still hear Dean cursing from the distance he's holding the phone away, then Dean comes on the line. "Hello?"
"He doesn't want to mate yet, John. And I can wait for him."
Dean and Sam exchange glances of exasperation. Then by silent agreement they leave, searching for Bobby and some jobs.
"In charge of heaven. Michael is an archangel, after all, the oldest of the brothers, and the one in charge of heaven now. Once we're married that role will transfer to us as well."
'No!' Sam thinks. 'You can't, you idiot, we're doing this for world peace!'
"It does."
Sam furrows his eyebrow. "Somehow I can't imagine Dean agreeing to that."
Michael glances at Dean. "Do my parents know you're here?" Dean shakes his head no. "Do your parents know you're here?" Another head shake. "Go call them. Right now."
"It- I- He-" Lucifer stammers, and then he finally confesses, "Yes. He's my mate."
"I'm Lucifer."
Gabriel points to their house and his brothers, still crying. Lucifer climbs the fence, and Balthazar scrambles over it next, holding Cas. "I'm sorry! I was supposed to be watching him only I wasn't, and now he got hurt!" Lucifer explains.
"Cambridge? Like, in England?"
"Fine. Leave me alone with him, I don't care," pouts Gabriel, throwing himself dramatically back onto the oversized bed.
"I did something that may have hurt your brother. Maybe. Or maybe he doesn't care, I don't really know. I don't want to hurt him, Michael. That was an accident. If he's hurt at all, I mean."
"I don't," Lucifer says, kicking both feet on the couch and turning his head away.
"Gee, as wonderful as that does sound, I gotta pass. I'm actually in the middle of trying to define true evil with Michael."
"Actually, Michael just said we were supposed to."
"And for what it's worth, you have my blessing as well. Both of you."
"Pretty sure everybody is at least a little bit scared, their first time."
Lucifer nods. "I see my reputation has preceded me."
"Because I was close to who they really wanted."
"If your plan is to woo me with sex, you'll have to go get Gabriel too," Sam teases.
"Where's Sam?" Lucifer asks, probably too anxious and sounding too much like he wants to get rid of Mary, which isn't true, but it's been a year and he wants to see Sam.
Sam shrugs. "Dean did it too. I am so sorry. I wish there was more we could have done to help you guys. We didn't want-"
Gabriel's watching Sam with a concerned expression, so he reaches forward and pulls him into his arms, pressing a light kiss to his lips. "I'm fine. Really," he says at Gabriel's skeptical look. He can feel arms wrap around them both from behind and relaxes, allowing Lucifer to take most of his body weight. "We're going to be fine," Sam continues, sliding an arm up to latch onto Lucifer as well. "We'll be fine," he repeats, though he's not sure if he's reassuring himself or the archangels with him.
"Goodnight."
Sam is 9
"Dean," Cas says calmly, talking over his husband, "I need you to get ahold of your parents, and I need you to tell them to come down to the hospital. Then I need you to call my family. It's Sam- he's hurt."
"Which one?"
"Watch it bucko, that's my wife you're talking about."
"This nephew of mine is spoiled rotten, and he's not even born yet," Lucifer remarks, stretching out his back.
"You are a sap, Dean Winchester."
"It's three a.m."
Crowley eyes them both suspiciously. "That doesn't sound like something Moose normally does, anything that's not involving Dean doesn't normally get done."
"Trust me, kiddo. We all go through this. Well, maybe not this exactly, but we all have our own worries and fears about being mated."
"Okay, but if he wasn't your brother and you didn't have Dean, would you do him?"
"I'm too sexy for my pants, too sexy for my pants, too sexy for my pants- so sexy it hurts!" Sam drawls.
Sam doesn't answer. He leads Gabriel outside to where the car is parked and the two men crawl inside. Sam reclines the driver's seat and turns until he's comfortable. "Night, Gabriel."
"Yeah that was when we were all at Stanford together. Oh my God do you remember that?"
"I met my mate today."
"I had a whole other bit to say, you annoying little brat. By the power vested in me by the state of Kansas-"
"Dean's about to be expelled?"
Sam wakes up with a huge crink in his neck and an archangel blowing breath that smells like caramel popcorn into his nose. He makes a face and sets about removing himself from the octopus that is also known as the archangel Gabriel without waking him. Miraculously a few minutes later he manages to make his escape. Gabriel seems to realize that he's left, because he reaches out for the warmth of Sam and instead tucks himself into Castiel in Sam's absence. Cas doesn't seem to mind if his deep breathing is any indication. Dean is still draped across Cas and Lucifer both, and Lucifer is leaning so far into Cas' shoulder he's nearly knocking him into Gabriel. Sam pulls out his phone and clicks a picture.
Mary gives him a hug. "I'm so glad to be here with you. Celebrating this special day!" She hugs Sam then too. "I heard you're getting married too!"
"Well you see, when two people like each other very much..." Claire begins mockingly.
"Good! Then unlike you, it appears he can follow simple directions!"
Cas and Dean are 21
"Sam, Dean and I have been married for a year almost. We got married last August."
"Thanks for getting me out of there with the demons. I didn't want to keep dancing with them. Though I'm not sure you grinding on me is a better alternative."
Judge Mosely rules Sam the winner. The courtroom erupts, Sam's classmates conglomerating on him and screaming victory. Sam doesn't care. He just wants to be done.
"I get all tingly when you use your college education like that, Sammy."
"Well, he did."
After slipping his phone in his pocket, he makes his way down the hall. In the lounge he spots Balthazar, Crowley, and Bobby sitting on a couch together. Their legs are all intertwined as they speak lowly amongst themselves. Sam approaches slowly, unsure from their facial expressions whether or not he'd be interrupting anything.
"You were gone for six hours, Sam."
Lucifer slaps Sam's hand. It's only when he hears the crack echo through the clearing that he realizes he might have slapped him a bit too hard. "Stop that!" he orders, ripping his T-shirt and applying pressure to the cut.
John gets out of the car, closing the door softly behind him. Sam slouches in the seat, tired and overwhelmed. His father had never talked like that before and Sam doesn't know how to respond to it now.
Cas gives him a hard look. "Then I suggest you change his mind. Quickly. Woo him, Lucifer."
Cas and Dean are 21
"Yeah, me too." He turns back to his computer, searching for a bit more information about their newest client. He loses himself in the monotony of the work for a while, until something moves beneath him. Lucifer's gaze snaps from the computer to Sam.
Michael's lips purse into a thin line as he stares at his remaining husband. "Close down Heaven. Recall the Host. Earth obviously isn't safe anymore."
Sam stares at Lucifer confusedly. "How do you not know where your own Cage is?"
"Here are the keys to your car, sir. It's parked outside by the big oak tree."
"Left," Sam finishes lamely.
"I don't think he's hiding," answers Gabriel as he heads into the bathroom.
"Dean, anything you have to say to me you can say in front of them."
"Dean-" Cas' voice cracks and he can't finish his sentence.
"I-" Dean starts. He never finishes the sentence, trailing off to stare at Ben with confusion. Then he stalks outside.
"Lucifer, you never once asked me to do anything that I actually enjoy doing. 'We're going to see an action movie, wanna come? We're going to a horror movie, wanna come? Haunted house?' Listen, I hate haunted houses and horror. And I don't really enjoy action movies either, I like comedies. Besides, we were friends when you were quieter too, but then Sam was born and your personality did a 180 because you had a baby to amuse."
"You're a lawyer, you can afford it."
Sam nods, mouth quirking up into a tiny smile.
"I'm sorry, Dean will be doing what now?" Dean demands.
Cas grins into the night, and all the lightbulbs in the room shatter.
"Sorry, Cas, your fiance calls. Um, good talk and all that." He smacks Cas on the back and literally runs off.
Dean stops. "Does it really bother you? That much?"
"Dean, please stop traumatizing your brother!"
Three hours later he is cursing his luck. There is nothing signifying a case anywhere in the nearby town. No disappearances, strange murders, electrical outings, weather disturbances. Zero, zip, zilch.
"Yeah. Good idea."
"Could be, but he's not," Lucifer answers. "Definitely a boy."
Gabriel is 24
"I can't keep going," Sam says brokenly, collapsing to the ground. "I can't. I've given everything there is. I see them, Adam, not the dead, but the living, and it's so much worse than anything I imagined. I keep thinking that maybe they've figured out some way to free me, that maybe Dean figured something out, or that if Cas can get him free from Alistair's rack then he can pull me out of Lucifer's Cage, and every time it's been a let down and a disappointment. It's not real, Adam!" Sam screams the last line.
"Careful," Sam teases as Balthazar's hands move to his hips. "Don't want Lucifer to kill you," he yells over the music.
"Eight years and counting. Plus three children: Tom, Shep, and Odette."
"Very good, Lucifer. Or should I call you by what you are now- weak, fragile little human?" comes a mocking voice from behind them.
Dean leans forward and kisses him. "It'll be alright. Tomorrow Daddy will make us pancakes, and we'll play at the park!"
After getting a bus ride to a block away from his house, Dean started walking home, disheartened, thinking the entire time about what a waste this whole crusade was. Maybe he should just quit while he was ahead.
It held up a hand and Dean stopped mid-air, as if somebody had hit pause on the very basics of momentum. “So now you remember. So then you must know...”
“Stop!”
Dean calculated for a bit, factoring in what time he got off and what he would do with Sammy. He figured nine would give him enough time to sort things out.
“You mean the one that you stared at with an intensity that could’ve possibly made something spontaneously combust?”
Dean turned to Castiel and looked him dead in the eye. “Ask the question that you’ve been dying to ask. Ask me why I become a blazed up skeleton freak. Tell me what you’re going to do about it, how you’re going to ruin me.”
(Oh, and Cas is a badass. Balls of fucking steel, even though he a soft boy as well.)
"Fuck you Sammy," Dean replied angrily, going up the stairs. "Seriously."
“No, Dean, I…” Castiel’s brain caught onto Dean’s words. “Wait, you can
“Ah,” Cas nodded. “The ‘Spirit of Vengeance’, or whoever that is.”
This story is the "Starships" to my Nicki Minaj, except this isn't as popular (not that I want it to be lol).
Castiel brought up his fists.
Green eyes opened and blindly stared off into the distance, hands shaking. “W-Why did I wake up with a fucking knife in my hand surrounded by a group of corpses that would make Hannibal fricking Lecter proud?”
Dean again. Of course Sam was upset with his brother, with whom he shared a grossly co-dependent relationship with.
“What’s up, Charlie? What’s wrong?”
, he thought, freezing mid-step. Castiel had forgotten that Uriel was guard that night. He winced and tried to make himself as scarce as possible, but, unfortunately, he had already been spotted.
(See the end of the chapter for
The Angel smiled and took his pants and leather jacket off, leaving him in boxers and a t-shirt. He climbed next to the stunned Winchester and squirmed around to get comfortable, until eventually he put his arm around Dean. At what, Dean squeaked (a very
I'm curious to see if anyone spotted the reference to 15x20. It's "squint or you'll miss it" but it's there.
Sam stood up, too hurt to remember to keep weight off his slowly healing leg. “Is that what you really think?” he said brokenly, disbelief written upon his features, “You think that I don’t care what happens to my brother? You think that if I couldn’t take everything back that I said the other day, I would?” Tears sprung to the teenager’s eyes. “It’s my fault that he’s out there alone, and scared, and trapped by this...monster that is going around and wreaking havoc. And I would save him, but what can I do? I’m a goddamn fifteen year old! I might as well be a baby, for all the help I can do!”
The Angel nodded solemnly. “It’s definitely Dean.”
"Yeah," Dean said. "But that just makes me worry even more."
The Commander sighed. "It was the Demons, Castiel. They were waiting to ambush us. I know Inias was your friend and I'm sorry for your loss, but last night...you know what needs to be done, Seraph."
At that, Hades’ mouth surged to meet his in a fiery passionate kiss, mapping out his lover’s mouth, before pulling back and smiling that adorably gummy smile of his again. The King of the Underworld held out his hand. The Queen grasped it, and, as they stepped into the chasm that would lead to the Underworld, Persephone knew he was home.
Sam made a chuffing noise that was a mix between a laugh and a groan, running his fingers through greasy hair. “Well, uh, to quote Bobby, ‘I know something isn’t right you damn fool idjit, and Red knows it too’. So it’s a stretch, but I think that they suspect something’s up with Dean.”
Dean squeaked. “We?!” But Cas was already on his way up the stairs, the eldest Winchester in tow. Sam was left in the kitchen dumbfounded. Who the hell did this Castiel guy think he was?! This was between him and Dean. And what was it with this stranger and his brother? What was their relationship?
Kudos and comments are very much welcome.
“Why are you here? I mean, not that you’re unwelcome, it’s just that...well, the way that things were left last time I saw you…” Castiel made an expression between a wry grin and a wince.
“Yeah.”
Cas laid a hand on Dean's shoulder and stopped him, looking him dead in the eye. "We are making progress, Dean. We now know that the plot against you was kept secret from lower level Demons."
Castiel remained silent, like he had been for pretty much the entire conversation and, after peering at the Angel for a time, Bobby turned to look at the other two in the room and sighed. “Well, can’t say it doesn’t make sense.”
So what, I couldn't help but sneak in a little Destiel in there. I'm a little obvious, but I don't care. Next chapter should be out soon 💕
As Dean viciously laid one on Castiel in the room behind them, Sam and Gabriel were exiting, taking that as their cue to leave.
Lilith: how bout you distract your little boyfriend wink wink
Castiel shook his head as it grinned. “I’m all the parts of Dean that matter. I’m Dean, just...with a twist. Tell me you don’t like that, baby. Me, better than ever.”
I'm tired lol.
I love cliffhangers. And I hadn't brought Charlie in in a while so what the heck. Also, I both love and hate Ruby. Mostly hate cuz she's annoying af, but also kinda love her because she's so sketchy and somehow manages to get Sam to "play D&D" with her. Like what the heck. Yeah girl, you so smooth.
The monster grinned and moved closer. “Let’s dance, baby.”
He didn’t tell Sam.
The first thing he heard was a hypnotic, repetitive dripping noise. He came to on his knees with an innate sense of calm and an underlying assurance that everything was right in the world. He felt...great. Fantastic, even. Definitely better than he had been in the past few months. His eyes fluttered open as he breathed in, the calm filling him further, before his eyes widened in shock.
“Dean?”
“Well, the only thought going through my head at the time was that we had to come out of that alive. Especially you. God knows I couldn’t lose you. So I asked for help.”
“Hey, Dean. Slow day today. Can you stock up the shelves over on that side while I do some inventory?”
Dean thought of the slip earlier when he had spoken out loud instead of thinking, as well as the pain that he had felt in the beginning and the loss of control. “I...don’t know.”
Charlie loved Dean. She loved how he understood her shyness about her orientation, she loved how he would drive in the middle of the night to comfort her, and she loved him even though he dropped out of high school during Junior year in order to take care of Sam. Long ago Charlie had realized that she would die for Dean as he would for her.
a burden? You were a burden to Dad after Mom died. He had to deal with a whiny, snot-nosed brat who couldn’t stop crying about his mommy being gone. And then he left you to raise Sam as he threw himself into his work, leaving for weeks at a time, ditching that burden and leaving it to take care of the child he
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean made a disgusted face. “Isn’t that self-cest? Feels skeevy.”
Sam’s head shot up. “What?”
Ruby stepped into her house and silently closed the door behind her. She moved into the main room, where multiple Demons were congregated. They all turned and looked at her as she entered.
I wrote the first half of the chapter a longgg time ago, and it is highly fortuitous that Sam gets pissed at Chuck for all the crap they've gone through.
“It’s okay, Dean. It’s going to be okay. I can make it better, alright? But only if you say yes.”
“Hi guys. Gals.”
“Gabriel, this is most definitely not the largest apiary collection in all the Earth,” Castiel grunted, steely blue eyes fixed upon his brother. It appeared as if he was going to try to smite Gabriel before he caught sight of the Winchesters. “Hello Dean.”
Dean was about to reply when he heard a very familiar horn that belonged to a very familiar yellow Volkswagen. He got up and grabbed the passenger door handle.
“Aw man, Sammy. I’m sorry.”
mysterious warehouse. They had been teleporting around since Gabriel told Sam of his plan: Gabriel would fly them somewhere halfway across the world, find something, grab it, and then leave. Most of them were warehouses and storage facilities, but Sam still feels bad about landing in the middle of a Hindu temple during a ceremony.
“Hello, love,” Hades rasped in his ear, gravelly voice causing a shiver to ripple down Persephone’s spine.
Fluff and then angst. Shit goes down. I'm sorry for how badly I write....I STARTED THIS CHAPTER IN MARCH 😤
Castiel stared at the hand in confusion before, after Dean had let it hang there awkwardly for a few seconds, Dean dropped it.
“Hey Castiel.”
Castiel rolled his eyes and closed the window. He didn't need the bullshit on the other side of that door.
cared about.”
. He hadn’t seen his brother in over two days, and his absence was definitely making a mark. When he was little, Sam used to fantasize over what his life would be like when he was on his own - he would be able to eat what he wanted, do what he wanted all the time. However, now, in this realistic world, all he wanted was Dean at home. He was almost out of food. Bobby and Charlie had been calling, asking after Dean, who, obviously, hadn’t made contact with them. And, also, Sam just missed his brother. It was quiet and lonely in the house, and in every shadow lurked a paranoia that was non-existent in Sam’s life up until now because of Dean’s constant presence.
“Alcoholism?”
“Hey Ruby.”
From the Underworld, Hades got up from where he had formerly collapsed and smirked. His love was almost ready, and it was just a matter of time until he could be with his love again.
His hand jumped off the boy as Dean’s eyes glazed over.
“Yeah. There’s just a..whole lotta shit that comes with surviving, you know? First there’s voices, then there’s the whole ‘hunger’ thing.”
Castiel was speechless with grief. "I-Inias is d-dead?"
So, when Ruby went to see Sam Winchester that night, she did not have the innocent intentions she claimed to have. And as she left, the girl smiled, pleased that Sam Winchester was playing so easily into her hand.
(meant to be read in the voice of Mr. Incredible) CLIFFHANGER! YEAH!
The Winchester relaxed and tentatively smiled up at the other man. “Oh, okay Cas.”
Dean cleared his throat and shifted. “No Sam...
“Hey-so sorry, didn’t mean to miss ya there-oh, how’s your kids-no, haven’t found a special someone yet-so sorry again about your coffee-yes we do serve that here-okay, have a nice day!”
He didn't give Sam any chance to reply, as he was already up the stairs and in his room, door closed. He took a swig of his beer, which was quickly followed by another, and another after that. Dean didn't want to deal with the conversation he had just had, and he had no interest in remembering it.
Castiel silently crossed the room and examined whatever was on Charlie’s computer before averting his eyes and placing a hand of comfort on the redhead’s shoulder. Sam’s hazel eyes met Castiel’s blue. “They’re the crime scene photos, Sam.”
“The thing inside him?” Sam tilted his head, curiosity mixing with his worry as he splashed the whiskey onto the wounds. Cas hissed before nodding.
Thank you for reading ❤️ I love your comments.
Sam’s hands froze from where they were wrapping a bandage around his bicep. “Possessed?”
Castiel winced. Obviously someone had told Dean of his past. “I’m not what I used to be. Yes, I did do some...bad things, but none of those were of my own volition. And I’m trying to get out.”
“Michael,” Castiel ground out, sore and tired and not desiring his uncle’s worry in the slightest. “I. Am. Fine. For most of the time you know where I am, unless you spontaneously forget where your sister’s bakery is. I am quite obviously not off the grid, or else we wouldn’t be having this conversation, and, I can assure you, my well-being is fantastic.” The lie passed his lips as easily as the air he breathed.
The Creature turned around to find Dean Winchester leaning on the wall behind him. It snarled at him and, in a flash, had its hand wrapped around the human’s throat. Well, at least it attempted to grasp the human’s neck. Instead, its hand just went through the neck like it was nothing as Dean smirked at it. With threatening eyes and an even more deadly grin, the human reached out and successfully grabbed the Creature by the throat, ramming it into the panic room wall.
Gabriel turned to see Dean, still frozen in place. The archangel appeared in front of the elder Winchester to see Dean’s eyes totally blank, pupils dilated. “Shit,” he cursed, before touching the hunter and healing him...on the outside. “Sam, get over here; I need to get you two back to your motel. Dean’s in shock.”
“Cas, are you suggesting that we team up and kill people?”
Dean sighed and leaned against the counter. “Dude, I got no idea. One second, I was feeling like my insides were being melted, and then I’m here, talking to you.”
There was a pause. The next time he heard his uncle’s voice, it was softer. Much less harsh.
“You know,” Michael started, ready to repeat a rant that Castiel had heard many times before. “You don’t have to work there. You could be much more well off working for the Angels.”
That one word broke Dean’s entire world, the amount of confusion and sadness imbuing it making him slump over and not meet the angel’s eyes. “Cas, I just..”
, Michael. I’m happy to be your soldier. Do with me what you want. But that… I won’t do that.”
, he thought.
After his rant, Dean looked at Sam with complete and utter despair. Sam inwardly smirked at the satisfaction about being right about what Dean’s issue was and leaned back in his chair, donning a contemplative face so as not to arouse suspicion in his brother.
Castiel burst out of the kitchen, irritated expression. “Gabriel, for Christ’s sake, if you continue to pull that with every single person who walks in, I will kill-” The dark haired man froze, spotting Dean, and nervously wiped wet hands on his apron.
Next chapter will be out eventually. I already have three quarters of the next sentence done 😃.
Castiel Novak was a small memory, a mere blink in Dean’s existence. However, Dean remembered him well. He was the only kid in the third grade to act like Dean existed. When he had left it had devastated Dean, because that meant probably no one would ever talk to the motherless mute boy with the absent father. In fact, no one had made any effort to acknowledge Dean in any sort of way since Castiel had left; that is, until Charlie transferred over in the eighth grade.
The teenager gulped and nodded before noticing that Cas was swaying more and could barely keep his eyes open. His arm shot out for stability. “Cas, I think you need to lie down.”
Cage Match!
Sam softly laughed. “Yeah, pretty much.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Look, Sam, the spell will be fine. We have everything we need, and it will work. My only concern here is that Dean, or, rather, Persephone, will eat something while down there.”
The uber-hot Dean smirked. “Your wishes are my command. In exchange for one thing.”
“Look, Sam, I just - I’m tired, man.”
But her plan of worming her way into Sam Winchester’s trust was moving along well, and Ruby was perfectly content with that.
“He’s one of the most dangerous people in all of the Angels.”
Sam couldn’t believe that his brother had left. Although, technically, a supernatural creature housed within his brother’s body had left, but that meant that Dean was gone too. He adjusted his bag on his shoulder and felt the comforting weight of the multiple books on possession he had checked out of the library that could possibly hold the answer to his brother’s salvation. He would save his brother or, well, frankly, die trying.
Today: State standardized test AND a chem test
Castiel closed his eyes and took a deep breath before swinging his fist into the creature’s face, barely feeling the impact over the ringing in his ears. It stumbled back, startled, before it smiled - a gnarly thing that could barely be called a smile. Maybe a better word would be a snarl. It wiped Dean’s hand across its mouth. “Wow, baby, didn’t know you had that in you.”
This chapter is long, ik. Lol inspiration strikes when it strikes.
The brunette stared down at his lap, suddenly interested in his fingers. “I..may have followed you back to your house after our first meeting.”
Dean had also always respected her gift as well. When learning that her accident had allowed her to see auras and get intuitive feelings about events and people, he never made fun of her for it. In fact, Charlie distinctly remembers him saying, “Well, okay. We all need a little more special in this world.”
“I don’t know...It was something about someone paying for something. He was saying it over and over.”
me. But what will I do? I’ll never be good enough for anyone. Nobody deserves to be burdened with Dean Winchester. I’ll be in this life forever, selfishly dragging you down with me. And what if you’re stuck with me forever, Sammy? What if nobody actually falls in love with me?”
It's probably not as funny as I think it is, but it is 3 in the morning sooo 😇)
After work that day, Castiel made his way back to the trailer park a few blocks away from the cafe. He took a shortcut through the woods, navigating through the dark purely by memory and instinct. All of a sudden he heard a voice say his name.
God I've had a week.
, he thought.
The teenager slammed his way out of the kitchen, wild eyed and covered head to toe in flour. “YeahDeanowhatsup”, he jumbled.
“I’m good.”
Sam couldn’t think of anything to say; he knew deep down why they didn’t want them seeing them. “Oh. And, uh, do you know…”
TW: blood, dark themes, Dean's a little psycho, it's implied that Dean has...intentions toward Cas, but nothing happens. I swear. Just a lot of whump and angst...mostly Cas whump :)
“Joy.”
“Not that kind of tired!” Dean interrupted, irritation at his brother making his voice rise. Sam jumped, taken aback by Dean’s outburst before he relaxed and refocused apologetic eyes on his brother. Meanwhile, Dean took a second to calm himself down then started again.
,” he huffed, horror in his eyes. “You are
“What exactly do we need?”
Cas raised his eyebrows. “What are the consequences behind that?”
Persephone stepped out into the parking lot, and, spying his love, almost ran to see him, a joyous smile on his face. His Hades looked so beautiful, power and magnetic darkness radiating off of him. Persephone, himself, was feeling wonderful. His human life was just a memory now; he knew, in his soul, that he was now going to be where he was meant to be. He could feel every plant on Earth in his veins, all of them holding a place in his heart. He felt like something
The blond man ducked as a knife came flying by his head. He whipped around to find a Demon behind him. The would-be attacker gulped as Dean’s eyes flashed orange and a sadistic smile crawled upon his features. Dean promptly lifted his hand and the Demon combusted. The Spirit hummed with pleasure at the kill.
“Wait..,” Dean said, putting the pieces together. “That was
The archangel smirked as he determinedly led the tall man down the corridor of yet
“Well, that first day of work that Dean had after you guys’ accident, he...wasn’t himself. He was totally out of it and had a weird thing goin’ on-” he waved a finger at his eyes “-with his peepers. Bright orange. And he was chanting too. Didn’t notice I was standing right in front of him for a few good minutes. And when he looked at me...” Bobby shuddered, remembering the depth of the anger in his boy’s eyes. “I felt the worst fear I’ve felt in my entire life.”
“What’s happened to him?”
“What.. what the hell?”
“Samsquatch, get over here.”
“Yes, I am an Angel. But I’m not a bad person.”
“What?”
He tensed at the use of his official title. "Michael, no."
(PS. I find the whole Ruby part of this chapter hilarious. It's literally just this:
, Castiel thought.
Sighing with relief, Dean smiled at Cas, his expression tired. “I believe you, Cas.”
“Alright. I’m in.”
“Gabriel, you promised to never joke about bees. Ever.”
“Dean,” #3 started. “There is a way out.”
Imma go to sleep now.
“No. Sorry. We’ll study some other time?”
He got to the doorway to see Castiel and Sam sitting at the kitchen table. Dean fought to keep himself calm; he wanted to explain to Sam what was happening, and the
Anna threw a washcloth on the counter in front of Gabriel while walking by.
"Where have you been?".
Uriel, seeming to have calmed down, nodded. “He’s where he usually is. But, Castiel, keep in mind what I’ve said.”
The archangel smirked. “Sammy-boy, I think I know how to get our brothers back.”
“Go ahead. Ask.”
Dean sighed. “Do you remember the car accident?”
"Castiel."
Dean walked over to the counter and sat down. “I..don’t know. Never been here before.”
But now that I stayed up late on the one day this week that I work morning shift, I'm glad to say I got this part over with. I've literally been dreading writing the whole "fight" and now that that's over with this ball might start rolling.
“Dean, you must realize that you have a very small bed. It’s not big enough for the both of us to be in without touching. It’s alright.”
Happy Easter 💕🐣...🍳
“What?”
Even though it was just a voice in his head Dean swore that he could’ve felt the voice roll it’s eyes.
“Oh yeah? And how can you help?”
In which the power of gay love conquers all. Also, Destiel stares. But is there really difference between the two?
Castiel felt the blood drain from his face as his world stopped moving. “Dean?”
“Hi Michael,” he said, swinging into their shared trailer, throwing his backpack on the floor.
“So, you know that when dear ol' Dad brought me back, he also made a lot of changes. One of those changes was, as you know, killing Crowley. However, while it is a great thing that that cockroach died, his death left a gaping hole in the infrastructure of Hell. Without Crowley, there is no ruler, and there is no Hell without a ruler. Lucy’s in the cage, all the archdemons are dead, the Princes of Hell disappeared centuries ago, and now it’s basically one large power struggle down there. However, the thing with Hell, boys, is that the place is basically its own sentient being. It needs a ruler. And if there is no potential ruler from Judeo-Christianity, then the title falls to Hades, the second-most known ruler of the Underworld. However, much to Hell’s chagrin, the god formerly known as Hades was killed years ago. No other titles truly fit any other gods, so Hell is then up to the task of finding and creating the new Hades.” Gabriel paused and sucked on his candy cane a little more.
The redhead smiled a bit before maintaining her intimidating appearance. Castiel walked out, pizza slice gone, but with a little bit of sauce on his cheek. Sensing the tension in the room, the brunette moved toward the girl and put his hand out. “You must be Charlie. I’m--”
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel glanced behind him at the door, but then decided against escape. The creature would just hunt him down and hurt him anyways. He took in a deep breath. “Do what you will. Just know that I won’t be going down without a fight.”
“...Yes. But what if we went after the Demons, that gang on gang violence, as well as all the drugs and unnecessary death, would decrease exponentially.”
“Yes.”
The creature stared into the Angel’s eyes searchingly while Castiel stared defiantly back. The pressure was soon taken off of Castiel’s neck, and, as soon as his feet were back on the ground, Castiel let out an inaudible sigh of relief. The creature in Dean turned away from the brunette. After a beat, Castiel squared his shoulders and said, with a (hopefully) confident tone, “Because you’re not you.”
The Winchester was silent for a bit. “Hey, uh, Cas...about what happened downstairs, you do realize how that sounded, right?”
When the Saints Go Marching In
“Helping him? By killing people?
“So you’re an Angel.”
Ruby worked hard to make her voice sound as not-irritated as possible. “Really? Why?”
Ruby was a popular girl. She was beautiful, decently smart, and had a magnetic personality which either repelled or attracted people. One thing about Ruby, though, is that she had one major flaw.
“Let me guess,” Dean rasped, coughing to clear his airways. “Feels like a million freaking bucks.”
Castiel graced him with one of his beautiful gummy smiles and stood up. “Alright, now move over.”
Castiel’s eyes snapped open at the sound of a phone blaring in his ear. His phone, he thought, recognizing the ringtone. He flung his hand out and reached for the deafening object that deserved destruction for awakening him, groaning as pain came at him from...everywhere on his body. Pre-dawn darkness prevented him from acquiring the object of his quest, frustrating the man further. He fumbled for the accursed device and finally managed to grab it and pick up right as the last ring sounded.
“Well, obviously, because your brother here looks like someone just killed his puppy.”
She looked up with tears in her green eyes before quickly looking away from the young Winchester. “It’s nothing, Sam,” she rasped. “You don’t want to see this.”
He abruptly stood and started briskly walking toward the door. He was almost home free, his hand on the knob, when he felt unnaturally hot breath huff on the back of his neck and felt a growl echo on a soul-deep level. “And where do you think you’re going?”
Dean sighed.
.” The god looked pointedly at Gabriel before looking back at Sam, that way-too-Dean sad expression firmly in place. “
“Dean?!” Sam yelled, trying to wake up his brother. Gabe shook his head and picked up Dean, laying him on the bed. “Sam, I think I know what’s going on.”
Ruby softly smiled at him. “Do you want to talk about it or do you want me to take your mind off it?”
Yup, Cole definitely hated the night shift.
Dean went to work two days after he woke up, even though Sam had protested. John wouldn’t be sending money for at least a week and they needed to get groceries. Therefore, Dean went to the shop as always.
. That asshole, thorn-in-her-side, brother of Sam’s was always interfering with her plans. She’d never met the man, but, with Sam, it seemed like his brother always came first. Ruby didn’t know what the deal was with this guy. She hadn’t talked to her sister Meg in years.
, he thought as he limped to the kitchen to make his new comrade a sandwich.
afterwards?” The last sentence was punctuated with an eyebrow waggle and a predatory gaze that made Cas squirm a little.
Hades grinned. “That is true, love, you are quite a force to be reckoned with. Although I cannot tell if I preferred the red hair more or this blond.” Persephone laughed softly, fully relaxed into his lover’s embrace
Castiel sighed, not even bothering to hide his irritation this time. “I’ll be there.”
Sam’s question was rewarded with a head tilt, genuine confusion wrinkling Castiel’s forehead as his eyebrows pulled together. “Yes, Sam. ‘We’. Because we are going to save your brother, or die trying.”
The Spirit laughed. “I don’t necessarily have to look like you. This is just the form I’m currently in. I could look like this,” -it transformed into an old man with wild, white hair- “or this,”- he transformed into a guy who had an eerie resemblance to Nick Cage- “if you prefer.”
Sam stared intensely at the blueprints in front of him; the blueprints he and Ruby had been poring over for days. “So, if there were motion sensors here, then you would need to turn up the temperature in the room, because most sensors can’t deal with any kind of heat over 95 degrees.”
He stood there like a deer in headlights and then snapped into action.
The Spirit was quiet for a while before answering.
A wry chuckle echoed throughout the cell. “‘The Hell’ is right, Dean.”
The heaviness of such an omission settled over the room, striking Bobby to his core. Castiel remained calm, impassive exterior containing the raging storm within. After a beat, Sam cleared his throat and the Angel sat back down on where he had been perched, icy stare still settled on Bobby. The older man eventually looked away and returned to his spot. Sam started hesitantly, tension in the room still potent.
Dean smiled and looked down at his hands before softly saying, “Hey Cas.”
Castiel closed his eyes for a second before turning back to Sam, leaning against the door for a second. Sam stared at him, then his suddenly unappetizing sandwich. He had his answer.
Updating... eventually :) thanks for dealing with this remarkably bad story so far
Bobby’s head shot to where Castiel was sitting. “Pardon?”
Castiel picked his head up and looked at Michael. Wide blue eyes met a calm blue. The elder nodded once more.
Also, all of you who caught that Nick Cage reference, you get a metaphorical cookie. Although, for the record, Ghost Rider is a terrible movie.
squeak, thank you very much). Cas smiled down at Dean.
They pulled up a block from where the deal was going down, hiding the Impala in some brush so as to not arouse any suspicion. Dean and Castiel had fallen into this familiar pattern as of lately; their partnership had reached the wordless communication stage. They snuck towards the rendezvous point in the warehouse district, Dean peeking around the corner of an old building that was close to the empty lot that held at least thirty Demons. The Winchester gulped and turned toward Cas; this was at least twenty more gang members than they had expected. Cas reached out and, taking Dean’s hand, squeezed it. The blond looked down at the joined hands and then back up at Cas before swallowing and nodding, squeezing back before pulling away.
Sam grinned at her, the first real smile since she saw him. “Embarrassing and nerdy are my middle names. Let me at it.”
She looked at Dean and gasped. Dean tilted his head in confusion and stared back at her.
Michael was silent for a moment. "Naomi will be waiting for you. Be at the Sandbox in two hours." And with that, the Commander hung up.
Dean absolutely did not want to tell his brother where he’d been, because that would raise even more questions. Then there would probably be a fight, then hurt feelings, then more problems that will inevitably will come in the future. He absolutely should not tell Sam.
Sam looked at Dean, a sad yet confused look upon his features. “Dean, we’ll still be together even if I go back for my degree. I’m with you.”
Dean nodded and set about to the task. He was somewhat distracted: ever since that conversation with that voice in his head last night he’d had a sort of...paranoia. At first it was just the little things, like smelling smoke in his bedroom when there was none or being able to easily jump out of the way of a car while on his way to work. Then came the bigger things, such as the voice chanting
“Hello?...No, Bobby, he’s not gonna be there...Yeah, I don’t think he’ll be showing up for work for a couple of days...Well, he’s sick. He’s vomiting everywhere and it’s super super gross...No, Bobby, don’t come over here it might be contagious...Charlie called you? Why?...No, no, Bobby, don’t come over here everything’s fine.--”
He stopped and observed the throne. It was made out of iron with silver inlay, with a plush and

over and over in his head and the fact that Dean had had murderous thoughts about random strangers he passed on the sidewalk today. While thinking on this Dean’s hand shook, causing some odds and ends car trinkets to tumble to the ground.
Castiel frowned but, knowing his situation couldn’t be helped, replied. “Sam, this, here, helping Dean, is all that I want to do right now. However, there are more pressing matters at hand, and I have obligations which need my attention.”
“Dean and I have plans.”
“Now that all these pleasantries have been sorted out, I’m afraid that we have more pressing business to attend to. Dean, what do you remember before you woke up here?”
Sam glances up from his phone only to stick his tongue out. “I didn’t
“That was a
. Who knows what could grow on it by then!” He runs a cloth over both, washing them quickly in the side of the sink that already has soapy water in it. “Just rinse it and put it in the dishwasher or hand wash it and put it back in the cupboard. It’s not that hard.”
Castiel flinches from her touch and ducks his head to try and avoid it further. He leans away, but not before fixing Crowley with a glare. Of course he understands what she means, but he won’t acknowledge them out loud. Crowley is
There are too many variables and Castiel doesn’t like any of them. He needs to learn so much more about what to expect before he would be comfortable going there. And there would either need to be less people, or he would need to get to know Charlie and Jo before he could possibly go there on his own. Maybe he could do this on Monday if Gabriel was coming, but he wouldn’t want to. He sees much more of Sam than Castiel does, and it would most likely be too weird for him. Not to mention that he’s not friends with Dean or his roommates. It would be more awkward for him than it would be for Castiel, since he wasn’t actually invited.
“I dunno, Cas.” He tilts his head back into the pillows with a laugh. “You sure seem to know what you’re doing when we have sex.” Dean reaches out and pokes him in the chest. “And, for the record, there is no

He shoots her a glare as they make the turn onto Pitkin Court. “Don’t start with me.”
“Nah, s’fine.” Dean yawns and sounds clearer by the syllable. “You only got me up, like, ten minutes before my alarm was supposed to. What’s up, buttercup?
Dean pats him on the shoulder as he squeezes past him to go out into the hall. They head back downstairs and no one even bothers to give them a second glance. That’s a little disappointing too, but it’s better than Cas getting embarrassed enough to want to leave early. He still seems nervous and he sticks close to Dean for the rest of the hour. They find themselves a nice corner of the living room where they can lean their heads together while they drink, snack, and sway to the music.

Charlie Bradbury, in all accounts, was a ray of sunshine. However, in high school, when she could’ve been hanging out with the popular clique, she chose to stick with one person: Dean Winchester.
Dean’s eyes widened and he sat up quickly, wincing at the body-wide headache he was sporting.
As soon as they were done and out of the building, Dean sighed.
“And what would that be?”
"Yes, sir?"

He began talking about the accident, which stemmed into telling Cas about his past. When he mentioned Sam, he didn’t need the voice in his head to tell him that his companion was hiding something. Dean paused. “What is it?”

“Well,” Anna said, looking at Castiel. “I heard that he’s working at that auto shop..Um, what is it...Singer’s Auto?”

Dean leapt to his feet. “Well at least I’m no body-snatcher who thrives off of making my life a living hell!”

"Dean?" Sam asked weakly, wondering if it really was his brother or if he was just hallucinating.
Sam smiled.
Sam smiled up at Ruby sweetly as she sat down next to him at one of the many study tables within the library, although it didn’t meet his eyes, which looked absolutely devastated. She shot him a quick grin back before donning the worried friend act.
More Dean whump. The squad is doing things. It is revealed that Cas is a simp for Dean. But we already knew that.
Bobby glared at him, even further on his guard around the Angel. “What do you mean by ‘
Dean froze. That had been Castiel? He swallowed nervously. “Okay. Where?”
Thirty minutes later, bathed in the blood of gangsters long dead (and then some), Dean was pulling Castiel into a shitty motel room straight out of the seventies, shag carpet and all. Dean had a giddiness about him that only confirmed how un-
The teenager, still in the room, cleared his throat. “So, uh, Charlie, Bobby will be here soon, so, uh, do what you want. I’ll explain everything when he gets here.”
(When he asked his brother about it that night, all he had gotten was a “Sometimes people have important things to tell you about themselves that not everyone reacts to the same, Sammy. It’s shitty that common courtesy can have that much of an effect on a person...really shows how little they have received it.” Those words echoed in his mind for a second, making him even more disappointed in himself for the way he handled the Dean situation.)
the word duty.
The blond sucked in a breath. “Well, to answer that, I need to give you a little bit of a background.”
“...Dean? You okay?”
Sam rushed to the window to see Castiel outside, standing surrounded by what looked like demon smoke, his normally tan coat a deep black. He was standing next to the cause of the tremors, a deep crack in the ground that most likely was a direct passage to the Underworld. The angel - could the guy still be called an angel? Didn’t look like one anymore - lifted his head and stared at the motel with those swirling black and purple orbs that were once pure blue eyes. The younger Winchester winced once their gazes met, his entire body seizing up with the feeling that he only felt when he was facing impending death. His heart dropped out of his chest, and he went pale, stuck in a trance, staring into the eyes of the Lord of the Underworld himself. Suddenly, he was jarred from his reverie by a hand on his elbow.
The younger Winchester nodded and continued. “Anyways, so Dean prays for Cas, and he shows up, and then all the demons kind of just...stopped attacking us? I don’t know, it was weird. But anyways, so this one demon starts trash talking Cas, and then, next thing you know, he’s ordering the demons back to hell...and they listened. Which was really weird. But the strangest part is, Cas turned toward us and his eyes….”
Sam glanced away. “Yeah...Ruby, what’d you say this was for again?”
Meanwhile, Gabriel kept watch over Dean, feeling a strange presence in the air that seemed to be growing stronger by the second. Even though he suspected what was going to happen to Dean, there was no telling what would occur, as this had never happened before in the history of mankind. The energy filling the room felt like life, like new things, but it was tinged with something dark with a small side of the power of Hell. All of a sudden, the power surged, and Gabriel’s eyes widened as Dean’s eyelids snapped open and the tremors stopped.
Dean scrambled back against the corner he had just come out of, breathing heavily. What the hell was going on?
Laughter floated out into the air, a wicked thing that poisoned the atmosphere of the room. Dean opened his eyes, disoriented as they focused in and out. He heard laughter and a repetitive sound of...he didn’t know what it was but it sounded squishy.
“Look, guys, I get that you care -” Gabriel opened his mouth but Dean quickly held his hand up in a silencing motion. “- in some way. And I appreciate it, I do. But this is my own problem, okay? Let me deal with it on my own, in my way.”
Cas leaned closer to Dean and intently stared him in the eye. “Dean, there are unknown consequences if you don’t do this. You might just have to kill people. But don’t worry, I will help you.”
Dean painted on a smile. “Right as rain, Sammy-boy. Nothing a little beauty sleep couldn’t fix.”
Castiel could hear the phone settle back onto its rest as Sam cursed under his breath. After a minute, the teenager limped into the living room. Upon seeing the brunette awake, Sam nervously smiled. “So, um, apparently Bobby’s coming over with Charlie. Oh, uh, Bobby’s Dean’s boss and Charlie is his best friend.”
“Castiel?”
“Castiel.”
The Winchester peered over at the couch upon which Bobby was passed out before looking up at Castiel in thinly veiled worry. “And I’m to keep an eye on Dean, I take it?”
Ruby: yeah ok I gotchu
“Castiel? Holy shit, what happened?” Sam paused, his worry momentarily abating as suspicion took over. “Wait, that’s your blood, right?”
“You’re wrong. Cas will save me.”
“Dean, do not be scared. You know me. I’m the voice that has been in the back of your head all these months.”
His heart beat faster. God, all these people, dead at his hands. His breath quickened, and he felt himself go into the beginnings of a panic attack, until something sparked in the back of his brain.
Dean and Sam nodded in acquiescence. Gabriel, satisfied, began speaking.
“So, what does all this have to do with Cas?” Dean asked impatiently.
Dean winced. He didn't need a reminder of the overwhelming, too real memories that overpowered every sense as a form of torture.
Sam rolled his eyes as he watched Dean move slowly (and what looked like painfully) to sit down at the table. The young Winchester observed Castiel and Dean exchange an unreadable look, one which made Castiel look even more worried. He waited for his brother to sit down, before unleashing the full force of his irritation on his brother.
Castiel looked back and forth between the two. He took note of Dean physically trying to calm himself and felt a pang of sympathy for his friend. The man was already worried about how the spirit possessing him was affecting him, and he didn’t need this extra stress. Castiel watched the younger Winchester put his brother down, and how every word made Dean’s shoulders slump more and more. Worry quickly turned into protective rage, and the Angel decided to make an executive decision. He stood up abruptly, his chair squeaking, offensive to the ears, making both Winchesters suddenly pay attention to the dark-haired man.
Everyone let out a collective breath after Sam got done with briefing them. Charlie was the first one to speak.
,” Michael responded, frustrated at his ward’s stubbornness.
“Not really.”
The only sound in the building was his rapid breathing. His pupils dilated, and he put his bloody fingers up to his face and drew stripes underneath his eyes. He began shaking in near ecstasy: he had only just begun to get his vengeance. He was getting a taste for it, and, deep down, he knew: once you get a taste of vengeance, you could never ever stop.
Persephone raised his hands to Hades’ cheeks, the other god closing his eyes and leaning into the touch. “
Sam swallowed. “Dean?”
“You better be careful around him boy.”
“Are you sure? Because Anna called me two mornings ago and told me you hadn’t been in for work. In fact, last time she saw you, you had left in the middle of your shift.”
The young man sat straight up at the tone of Michael's voice. It was positively livid, and, while Michael did occasionally get annoyed and even angry with Castiel, he had never heard the Commander speak like this.
It moved closer, a smoothness to its motions that Dean felt almost uncomfortable seeing. “It feels amazing, Dean. I can show you.” Its eyes began to glow that hellish orange as it began to reach out toward him. Dean squirmed away the best he could.
Sam swallowed, a little taken aback but cowed due to the bluntness of the man’s words. “Uh, yeah...I’m gonna go get some stuff to disinfect your wounds.”
“What?” Sam asked, still distracted by the fact that his brother just turned into a supernatural creature. “What’s wrong?”
So when he called her, panicked, on a Thursday afternoon, she dropped everything and ran to her car to go get him.
Writing an essay about Hamlet that's due tomorrow? Nahhhh. Let's update a fanfic.
“Was that Castiel Novak?”
people with you? Do you get off on this or somethin’? The hell is wrong with you?”
Cas sucked in a deep breath and covered his mouth. He usually let Dean handle the opening remarks, as Dean could hold his own, but never had he ever thought that Dean would get shot. What was going to happen? Would the Spirit save him?
“Okay,” Dean said. “This is a little out of the blue, but okay.”
Hope to post soon. ❤️
The elder Winchester wryly laughed and walked to the kitchen, opening the fridge to grab one of his dad's beers. He didn't care if he was underage; he needed one. "Yeah Sammy. You know, the place where I make money? By the way, the Impala’s almost finished."
Sam swore softly under his breath, no doubt kicking himself for not noticing what was going on with his brother sooner, and Charlie snapped her fingers in sudden realization. “He called me right after that. Totally freaked. And his aura looked so...weird and angry. Poor guy, who knows what he was going through.”
The creature paused its ministrations, a flicker of vicious curiosity in its eyes that didn’t match the forlorn expression upon its features. “What’s the problem, Cas? You can’t tell me you don’t want me? Cuz I can see inside of you. Your desire for me. The unspeakable things you want to do with me.” He smirked. “
Castiel blushed but his mind was somewhere else. He knew what he was doing on his lunch break.
Dean breathed out through his nose. “He turned around and his eyes were all..glowy. Like, they were black and purple, and there was just like this dark light coming off of them. And he was totally surrounded by this darkness. It was freaky as hell.”
“How is the plan coming along?” Azazel, one of the head members asked.
Relaxing his body, he walked across the warehouse, stepping over charred bodies that were scattered sporadically on the floor. Cas looked up from the Demon he had just stabbed and dropped the body on the ground. Dean’s eyes lost their bloodlust and he tentatively shot a half-smile at Cas. Hesitantly, the dark haired Angel smiled back. They started to clean up any evidence that they were the ones behind the multiple corpses covering the warehouse.
HAPPY (belated) NEW YEAR BTW ❤️
bold if he liked him in this way. The weight of the creature was soon on top of him, and, at the feeling of lips attacking his neck, Castiel couldn’t take it anymore.
Completely and utterly broken, Dean nodded, tears dripping off his chin. The monster caught one on its thumb and licked it, savoring the taste. Returning that hand to the man’s shoulder, the monster lifted its other hand and pressed it to Dean’s forehead, an orange glow emitting from it as Dean’s entire body tensed and his eyes rolled back into his head before he went completely limp. The monster smiled and petted the side of Dean’s face. “Good boy.”
Dean put his head in his hands and thought for a moment before meeting Cas’ gaze once more.
“And then Sam, oh, sweet Sammy, he didn’t appreciate you. He didn’t appreciate you starving yourself so he could have a well-rounded meal. He didn’t appreciate you dropping out of high school to get that job at Bobby’s just so you could afford to get Sam new clothes and shoes. You threw away your future, Dean, and what did you get? A spoiled teenager calling you a monster and insulting you to your face. God, Dean, you even fucking got yourself possessed for him. He’s the whole reason you’re in this mess.”
“..By working here?”
The second time Castiel woke up was also due to a phone ringing, just not his. Sunlight blinded him as he opened his eyes and then promptly squeezed them shut. From a room away, he could hear Sam answer the landline.
Easter egg from 9x07, anyone?
“Sign me the hell up.”
I was gonna add a little more of the Demon storyline in this chapter, but I kinda got swept up in fluff. I'll divulge more on that in the next chapter I think.
“Well, what do you expect me to say? That’s my reaction. There’s a spirit that has merged you that feeds on death. Have you fed it?”
“Dean, lately you’ve been distracted and have been jumping into the bottle more than you’ve actually faced your issues.”
Somehow its eyes became even more furious and its grip became tighter, causing Dean to wince, before something overcame it (
“Hiya Bobby.”
I'M BAAAAAAACK.
Dean got Sam inside the house and proceeded to carry the injured (and now slightly irritated) boy up the stairs and into Sam’s room. The younger sibling rolled his eyes as his brother checked him over thoroughly, making sure Sam was okay.
To her, Dean was like the brother that she had never had. He understood her. To anyone else in high school, he had been quiet and shy, too nervous to ever even say hello to anyone. But, to Charlie, he was one of the best people she knew. He was caring and compassionate, especially when it came to his little brother, Sam, who he had been looking after his whole life.
Sam cooperated, and one second later they were in their motel room. Sam sat his brother down while Gabe got a glass of water. They gave Dean some space until he came back to himself, and then made him drink the water. Dean was still slightly confused, but the water helped to kind of clear his head a little bit better. Once it was established that Dean was okay, Gabriel sat back. “Okay, so what’s wrong with Cassie?”
“I’m sorry,” Dean said in a tired voice, scrubbing a hand over his face. “I..you know, the uh voice in my head.”
Sorry I took so long posting! School has started, so I haven't been able to write for a while, well, that is, stuff I want to write. But I'm gonna try to finish this.
It clicked his...its tongue. “Dean, Dean, Dean. It’s not like this is new to you. I believe I’ve woken you up before in similar circumstances.”
A hurt expression that hit way too close to Sam’s heart crossed Dean’s, no, Persephone’s, face before the being stood. “
Dean had, with much hesitation, returned to work. He needed a paycheck and he couldn’t avoid Bobby forever. When he had walked in, however, Bobby didn’t make a comment, just looked at him out of the corner of his eye and said that there were a few shelves that needed to be restocked. Dean had nodded and went to grab the supplies.
Flaming eyes opened as the Spirit of Vengeance, or, rather, the Dark Spirit, grinned. He had granted Dean’s wish; technically, the nightmare
Persephone paced the throne room of Hell. As Dean Winchester, he had hated this place - it remained the source of many of his nightmares. As Persephone, well, it’s not like he liked it a whole lot - it was a little hard to make plants grow in Hell, even for the god of plants and growing things. And as Persephone suppressing Dean, well, he still thought that there should at least be a few houseplants down here. Maybe a cactus.
Castiel's phone rang, echoing off the walls of the basement. The Angel jolted awake and felt around for it blindly before finally finding it on the floor next to him. Without even looking at the Caller ID, he answered. "Hello?"
Castiel smiled slightly at the concern in Gabriel’s tone. “Yeah, I know. I do have a question.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Lmao the ending fell apart, I know. That's what you get for writing at 3 in the morning.
Dean looked at the bullet that was lodged in his shoulder. The small chunk of metal promptly was pushed out of his shoulder as the skin and muscle knit back together quickly. The Winchester slowly lifted his head, revealing flaming orange eyes as his body began to turn orange, almost as if his insides were on fire, with the flames fighting to get out. Though it looked painful, Dean was oblivious, laser-focused on his shooter.
“My turn to fuck
. He had completely forgotten.
Cas’ departure left behind two extremely dumbfounded and worried hunters. They stood in silence until Dean inevitably broke it.
“Why would you care?” Castiel asked, his bitter tone wounding Sam to his core. “You are the reason we are in this mess in the first place. You’re the reason that one of the best, strongest people I’ve ever known is drowning, and you’re living your life like you don’t give a damn!”
Dean got up and quietly walked downstairs, listening to his brother’s shower of questions.
boy, who is flipping
"You can tell me, Dean: is it a girl?"
“So? We couldn’t talk at a normal time? Such as when I’m awake?”
“Could you take my mind off it? I hate to ask this of you, but I’m just not up to talking right now.”
Ruby’s phone lit up, Sam’s number on the caller ID. She rolled her eyes and picked up.
The Spirit strained against its invisible restraints, trying to yell through the gag, but Dean didn’t notice. Dean #3 smiled indulgently. “Yes Dean, any wish you want.”
velvet cushion. There were human skulls that both topped the throne and served as the throne’s feet, which, in Persephone’s opinion, was a little too “tacky” and macabre for his taste. He was pondering on the benefit of adding some orange roses to spruce up the piece of furniture when he felt a very familiar pair of arms wrap around his waist and pull him into a backwards embrace. Persephone smirked and leaned his head back.
Sam sighed and looked down at the ground, which, underneath, housed his brother. “Let’s hope that Dean’s appetite didn’t transfer over to Persephone.” He felt a hand grab his wrist and looked up to find Gabriel, staring earnestly at him.
“Anna’s diner. Castiel, why do you stoop so low as to work with that...abomination. You should be doing what real Angels do. Not rolling in the mud with the pigs,” Uriel ranted, a look of disgust seemingly carved into his features.
“Cas! Put me down!”
“So what you’re saying is that since I didn’t fully accept you, the shittiest part of me merged with the shittiest part of you?”
The daughter gave the affirmative, distracted by her Lit homework. “Yeah. Sam’s pretty cute. Genius too."
"You can't keep me in here forever, Castiel! I'll get out, and then you'll burn! You ALL will burn!"
Dean sagged on the slick floor, uncaring and not wanting to think of what it was so slick with. His hallucinated (didn’t feel hallucinated, but it has to be...right?) doppelganger’s feet appeared in front of his eyes. It crouched and gently grabbed Dean’s chin between its fingers. Dean shuddered at the touch; though it was gentle, it held promises of further violence and pain. For him and for others. Nothing like how Castiel would touch him: his gentleness held promises of good times and friendship, it made him feel safe. God, where is Cas? Wait, he’s probably working out a way to fix him, even though he isn’t worth it. He sent up a silent prayer to whoever was listening that Cas would save him. The grip grew tighter and forced Dean’s head to turn, his eyes meeting the angry eyes of his doppelganger.
Dean took a deep breath and cleared his head, before roughly running his fingers through his hair and standing up. He glanced out the window, seeing the moon, before doing a double take. Instead of the regular moonlight Dean, and, well, everyone, was so used to, it was as if the moon had been replaced with a blacklight.
“He just has been lonely and concerned he will be alone forever. And not just alone,
The figure moved into the light, to reveal Dean’s own face looking back at him. The real Dean closed his eyes in despair as the creature spoke. “Why what, Dean?”
The Spirit turned back into Dean’s doppelganger and smiled. “Okay, good. I just wanted to make sure you were comfortable with me in this visage.”
He tried to remember what happened, but he couldn’t recall. In fact, he couldn’t really recall any recent events. Every time he tried to reach into his short term memory he got an overwhelming sensation of being shoved, beaten, drowned in darkness. He couldn’t breathe, and all he could feel was just...suffocation. He was suffocating.
Bobby has a bat, Sam is a teenage damsel and has the hair for it, Castiel's backstory is once more hinted at but STILL not elaborated on, Dean is oblivious to everything because he's still possessed, AND I can't decide what to refer to Dean as.
, the dark haired man thought as his eyelids began to flutter closed.
“Yeah, sure, see you then.”
In which Castiel's job catches up with him and Sam eats a sandwich. Oh, and the author takes the opportunity to beat up Cole Trenton. Sorry to all Cole fans out there.
Dean Winchester, covered head to toe Carrie-style in the blood of Demons, leaned back, his palms struggling to find purchase on the slick floor, threw his head back as far as he could, and laughed at the beauty of the destruction surrounding him. The destruction he created. He couldn't wait to make more.
Sam paused and Gabriel, previously listening attentively, gestured him to go on. “His eyes?”
“Sam, we got company.”
Gabriel gave him a smile and gently rubbed his thumb over Sam’s wrist before releasing the appendage. “Let’s go fix our brothers.”
“And who the hell are you supposed to be?”
“I’m fine, Michael.”
I'm. So. Fucking. Tired. So I'm sorry for being salty.
Next up: The Return of Charlie and Why Kids Shouldn't do Dumb Things.
Dean quickly realized he hadn’t been engaging in conversation for a few minutes and stuck out his hand. “Of course I remember you. Nice to see you!”
Behold, bad writing!!!
As soon as he finished his prayer, the archangel appeared, a worried look on his face. He quickly looked over Sam and, making Sam bend over a little, pressed a finger to the much taller hunter’s forehead, healing him of his injuries. The angel went to speak but was cut off by Sam shaking his head. “No,” the hunter said. “Help Dean.”
“Hey fuckhead! I said, why the hell won’t we just kill you where you stand!”
thing he needed was to lose control and burst into flame on cue. So he decided to speak up.
Michael looked at Castiel in silence for a second and then nodded.
Dean swallowed.
The blond rolled his eyes and raised his knife. “Because…”
“Oh, Dean,” it said, getting closer, and cupped Dean’s face with a burning hot palm that made Dean flinch in pain. “I have so many plans for you.”
Gabriel started Castiel out of his reverie, making the dark haired boy almost fall out of the stool he was perched on. Castiel glared at his cousin from across the counter as the other guy chuckled. He took a deep breath to calm down before answering.
interesting. “He..uh..he feeds on........death.”
The tension that suddenly filled the air took the breath out of his lungs. The creature’s head turned toward Castiel. “What do you mean, Cas?” It’s voice was low and laced with a promise of danger.
Things are happening in Hell. And a plan has come into motion.
While Sam ran to his brother, Gabriel felt a pulse of energy, and, upon further investigation, sensed every plant within a mile radius of the motel rejuvenate, flowers growing in less than a second.
He prayed.
“I know, I know,” Gabriel said, candy cane almost gone. “I told you that you wouldn’t like it.”
“What? Fuck you. No.”
“Shit.”
Dean was returned to a normal, upright position sporting a confused expression before it dawned on him. “I’m trapped in my head.”
Sam wiped a hand over his face to clear it of any tears that had congregated there. “Yeah. It is what it is.”
! I’m just looking out for you! What else are loving cousins for?”
“Different how?”
“Dean and I got into a fight.”
“Are you okay?” she asked, gently putting her hand on his arm. His lips quirked up wryly before he stared off into the distance.
All of a sudden the motel room to their right collapsed in on itself in a pile of rubble with a bang, revealing an archangel dragging behind him a very disgruntled angel in a very familiar trenchcoat.
“Yeah, well, it’s not like I have a choice. Orders are orders.”
The younger man blushed and continued. “Do you know who that was?”
He wiped a hand over his face (
“Hiya,” Dean greeted, standing, recovering himself from their intense staring contest. “What can I help you with today?”
Ignoring the comment about the monster in front of him being a part of him, Dean threw up a cocky facade. “You could be freaking Cher, for all I care. My family will find a way to save me.”
Castiel shrugged and made a noise of indifference, making everyone turn to him again. “That isn’t new news. Dean and I were hunting down Demons before he left.”
AUGH.
They had found a group of Demons harassing the members of a bachelorette party, which ranged from tipsy to thoroughly inebriated. Castiel had thought he was unsettled before, but seeing Dean’s maniacal grin at the promise of violence chilled him to the core. And Cas’ past with the Angels, no matter how violent or fucked up it was, definitely could not have prepared him for the absolute carnage Dean had soon caused.
“Come on man, I know you’re hiding something. Out with it.”
Thank you for reading ❤️ Love y'all.
“Dean isn’t gonna like this,” the teen muttered, pushing his plate away.
The man threw his head back and laughed before grinning a little too sharply for Castiel’s taste. “All’s good, baby. Hey, what do you say that we get outta here? Shoot some pool, kill some bad guys. Maybe have a little
The dark haired man then leaned forward and said to Dean in a low voice (which Dean thought couldn’t be physically possible to sound that deep and good), “We need to meet.”
Dean opened his eyes. Or rather, not Dean. Something else. He looked around, body shaking from utter euphoria. Surrounded by bodies. Soooo...as usual. He stretched and, when he clasped his fingers together, he couldn’t help but notice the rust coating his hands and examined his fingers with interest. It flaked off when he scratched it. Felt familiar. The stench of death and rot invaded his nostrils and he welcomed it like an old friend. The smell activated something within him, and he grinned.
Anna pulled her red hair back into a ponytail. “Blond hair, tall?” Castiel nodded.
“Sam. Sam!”
Castiel, for some reason much more aware of the feeling of the wooden grain on his neck as well as the cold that was seeping into his back, on top of the chill in the base of his spine. He swallowed. “No, Dean, of course not.”
Dean and the Spirit were thrown onto opposite walls as a third person appeared in the room. Well, to be absolutely transparent, a third
The blond wryly quirked his lips up at Cas, and that was when the waiter had realized he was staring. “...Um, are you okay? How are you here? What happened?”
Sam gave him a sympathetic and worried look, and then nodded. “I know, Cas. Just...let us know if you’re okay, alright? After you do whatever you have to. ”
As Dean pulled the door open with so much force that it hit the wall, Castiel took a deep breath and then let it out slowly. Something was wrong here, and he was going to get to the bottom of it.
Charlie suddenly gripped her head and grunted in pain. Castiel reached for her, but she screamed just as he was about to make contact. “Don’t touch me!”
are you doing in my brother’s body?”
“Hello to you too.” The god turned into his lover’s embrace and wrapped his arms around the Lord of Death’s neck, staring into those ethereal eyes. “How is the Underworld holding up?”
Sighing, Castiel grasped Dean’s shoulder gently. “Well, I’m not going to.”
“Sam,” she said, making her voice sweet and happy. “What’s up?”
The corner of Sam’s mouth quirked up. “...I don’t think you know what D&D is.”
“Sammy?”
The dark haired man seemed to be startled out of...well, whatever that was. He looked up at Dean with an unreadable expression on his face. “You may not remember me, but I’m Castiel Novak.”
Thank you so much to all those who've stuck with this story. It means a lot. Also, I know I can be a little annoying so it really shows your strength of character 👏👏👏. Bravo :).
“I...have no idea what just happened.”
“Ahhh, you love me and you know it,” Gabe smirked, and then went to go wash some recently vacated tables.
“Wanna tell me what happened?”
Sam smiled a little as the tension in the room began to fade. “Yeah, man. I’ll go make you one, and maybe in return you could tell me a little bit about this whole possession thing?”
“Once the child has been sacrificed to Hell,” Gothlord pontificates, “you, Dean Winchester, will be next, and your brother can watch as we carve out your heart.”
“Yeah, he did. He moped around like a teenage girl. And, Dean, we don’t leave you forever because we love you. You know what? It’s okay to love.”
Octopus-Cas continues in his very loud octopus voice.
“Yeah, while you were getting the room. I prayed to him too, and called the hospital, but Meg says he took off and hasn’t checked in.”
Meg starts laughing. Uproariously. “Heya, Clarence; nice digs. Deano; nice legs.”
Then he stops. His lips thin into a tightly shut line and he disappears.
“So, how long have you had the hots for old Feathers here, Deano?” Meg asks. She’s perched in an armchair, supposedly filing her nails while they wait for Sam to research up a cure for the curse, but actually asking Dean questions like the world’s most evil psychiatrist.
“It is, yes. I do prefer that. Thanks.” Dean pats Cas’ chest feathers. True, Cas did kidnap him, which isn’t cool. And he did just say ‘courtship’ in a context that Dean is almost totally sure he finds disturbing and not at all sexy. But Cas is presumably cursed. There’s no reason to make him sad on top of it.
Cas makes a frustrated-sounding growl, and amends,
But Cas has also died for Dean. Literally, and more than once.
Cas replies happily.
“How the fuck would I know?” he says. Honestly. “I’ve had a grand total of two relationships that lasted more than a night on the road, and they both ended badly. I kill things for a living, go out, get drunk, scam people out of their hard earned cash, and bang the bartender in an ally. The only people I really care about are Sam and Cas, and the only reason they don’t leave for good is because they’re too stupid to stay away. There; I said it. Are you done now?”
“Can you lie to me, Cas?”
Sam towels some stray purple glop out of his hair, hauls out his laptop, and plugs in the charger. “I’ll try running his phone.”
“Holy fuck, do I need another beer.” Dean goes back to the mini-fridge, remembers he still has half a beer in his hand, drinks that, and takes out another one.
Dean means to make a snarky reply. He really does.
Since Cas has only been cursed for a couple hours, and the bower is intricately laid out, with a branchy hall-like structure leading into the nest proper, and a large central “room” where the blue things are woven into the walls and laid in complicated patterns on the floor, he would’ve had to work very hard indeed—and possibly also time travel—to get it all done before his same-day-delivery kidnapping.
One of Cas’ tentacles shoots out and grabs Dean around his wrist and another does the same with his shoulders and Cas starts pulling and prodding until rather than walking calmly to the bedroom to recover his dignity and then maybe dragging Sammy to bed to sleep off his Cas hangover, Dean is more or less forced to step over Sam’s prostrate body and shuffle reluctantly towards the window. The glass has a hole in it surrounded by spiderweb cracks that weren’t there when Dean got in the shower.
“It really isn’t,” Dean says with conviction. Because it isn’t. It sucks. It’s the absolute worst. It hurts all the goddamn time, and then you just get betrayed. “Cas
He drags in the slowest, deepest breath he possibly can. Cas has his head cocked to the side and is staring at him sincerely out of one birdy eye.
Dean yells at Sam. Sam keeps shooting.
Cas replies sadly.
Cas’ tail twitches hopefully.
~*~*~
“It’s a sapphire, isn’t it.”
Cas’ bower—whatever a bower is—is blue.
Whatever that spell was about, it’s made Cas even crazier than he was before, and apparently he thinks he’s in love. Also Dean is still naked on top of a building in early spring, and his junk is freezing off.
“Where’re we going, Cas? Got a rocking bachelor nest up here somewhere?”
Cas is still wearing his psych ward hospital pajamas, but peacefully watching the bees must not be on today's agenda. He takes down the demon first, burning it from its host in a crackling orange glow. Sam and Dean come unstuck from the wall and start shooting again, while Cas walks casually around the room like a badass, smiting witches as he goes. The ones who aren’t dead yet chant and gesture away like mad, trying to cast whatever nastiness they can before they’re filled with either lead or Cas’ mojo. The room smells cloyingly of incense and sulfur, and Dean’s feeling pretty good now actually, adrenaline singing through him and only three more witches to gank before the town is safe and they can drive little Timmy home to his parents.
“Yeah, I’ll say.”
Cas complains. He does uncoil from his foe-leaping crouch though, so that’s a plus at least, small as it is.
, you idiot. He thinks you’re a monster.”
Cas growls.
“Down, Cas! Not up! Down!” Dean shouts, but Cas ignores him. The ground drops away at a dizzying speed.
She grins big as the Cheshire Cat and Dean knows he’s in trouble. “You assholes rub off on a demon girl terribly; I really shouldn’t be this altruistic. Dean, are you in love with Castiel?”
Cas says primly, because apparently he’s a proper Victorian lady now.
He tries again. “It’s um. Beautiful. Like I said. But you’ll have to put it back.” He unhooks an El Sol from Cas’ talon, cracks it open, and takes a long gulp.
Meg is laughing again. Dean gets a beer from the mini-fridge and drinks half of it in one pull.
~*~*~
Cas says with ridiculous but typical sincerity.
No, that—unbelievably—is not the worst part. The worst part is he wants to follow up with
Cas pronounces, and lifts Dean bodily to the window. Dean’s cheek smacks into the glass. He has a sudden flashback to a youtube video he saw once of a six hundred pound octopus compacting it’s body down small enough to fit through a hole the size of a quarter.
He carefully removes the hand from over his mouth.
“Christ, Sam; can’t you research any faster?” Dean grouses. Complaining is safer than answering questions.
“Dean,” Sam says. He gets that disgustingly kind expression on his face he uses when he’s forced by circumstance to explain to a victim’s family members that the supernatural is real. “You worry about Cas all the time. You make heart eyes at him behind his back. You’ve killed every angel who’s ever gotten in your way, except Cas, who you keep trying to save even when he’s screwed up royally. You carried his trench coat around in the trunk of the car for eight months when you thought he’d been killed by the leviathans.”
he yells in a not at all panicked fashion. He could just use a hand is all.
the giant octopus monster who is apparently Castiel says.
He heads into the tiny bathroom. It has no particular color scheme other than mold, and the housekeeping staff—assuming there is one—appears not to have cleaned it since the Renaissance. Still, a shower is a shower, and even the worst hotels are a luxury these day, what with the leviathan after them and everything. The water’s moderately warm and the pressure’s almost adequate, and when he lathers up his hair with the entire contents of the single microscopic hotel shampoo bottle, the scent is pleasantly neutral.
Although Dean does feel a tiny bit nauseous when he pictures Cas collapsing to the floor with his face all scrunched up in that grimace of agony.
No one is shooting or mauling anyone else, they’re back at the hotel, and Dean has pants on. Other than that, the world still sucks.
“He’s probably fine,” Dean says. Because he is probably fine. Almost definitely fine. He survived for millennia without Sam and Dean to take care of him.
The skyscraper roof Cas built his bower on is barren except for cigarette butts and scattered trash. There’s no fire escape and the emergency exit leading back into the building is chained and padlocked closed. The street is at least thirty stories down.
“Cas?”
Because Cas, and therefore Dean, are really quite high in the air now. The motel looks like a ratty old matchbox surrounded by other ratty old matchboxes, and the road it’s on looks disturbingly like the part of
A six-pack of El Sol dangles from one of Cas’ talons and an enormous, clear blue, sparkling stone is clutched between two others.
Cas asks. His face isn’t very expressive, because he’s a bird and all, and besides Cas’ expressions—other than sarcasm—have always been on the flat side. But Dean thinks he detects a note of hopefulness in Cas’ voice.
“Whoops, sorry,” he says. “My bad for phrasing it that way. If it helps, I knew all that already.”
rattling now? Dean’s eyes pop open and his heart almost stops, because holy mother of god, it is the shower curtain.
Everyone raises their hands at once.
Dean runs to Cas.
Dean reassures himself.
Thanks to my amazing artist, deliciousirony. Check out her other beautiful works
Shooting straight up and then diving down so fast Dean clutches the feathers of Cas’ belly to keep from falling off his talon.
Cas booms contritely over the sound of the wind from his gigantic flapping wings. He readjusts his grip so that Dean is sitting more or less freely on one foot while being gently gripped around the arm by the other.
And furthermore, Cas is starting to swoop.
“How urgent is the situation exactly, Cas? Leviathan-are-breaking-down-the-door urgent, or just I’d-rather-not-be-an-octopus-all-week? And if you wouldn’t mind using your indoor voice, you’re making my ears bleed.”
There, six inches from Dean’s face, is an enormous, hideous, octopus monster.
This whole situation, if Dean does say so himself, is fucked.
It’s windy outside the protective confines of Cas’ basket weaving project, and Dean’s teeth are starting to chatter. He wastes a bunch of time trying to jimmy the lock open with the barrette and getting frostbite on his dick, and when that doesn’t work, he tries breaking the chain by bashing it with the tire iron instead. When the chain won’t break, he starts in on the door handle. That’s an abject failure too, but at least he works up a sweat and isn’t in danger of acute hypothermia anymore.
“Bring me one too, please? Right away?” Sam has the grace to sound mortified with himself. “That was too chick flicky even for me. Also, I can’t find a cure for the curse, but the lore indicates truth spells wear off fairly quickly. We should be back to our lying, more comfortable selves in a day or two.”
Fortunately, before Dean has time to go off on another disastrous chick flick tangent, there’s a racket of clanks and clangs from the emergency exit. The door swings open in a clatter of broken chain, and Sam and Meg burst through.
“I’M FINE,” Sam yells “GO ON. I’VE GOT THE KID!”
In fact really, if not for the part where Dean is a manly dude who doesn’t enjoy being carried around like a delicate princess and the other part where Cas is behaving even more irrationally than his recent norm, it’s actually kind of nice.
~*~*~
Dean grabs behind his back for his 1911, but it’s not there of course, seeing as how he’s buck naked. His knife’s on the toilet lid, but he’ll never get to it past the gelatinous bulk of the monster, which takes up most of the bathroom, and its assortment of tentacles, which take up the rest.
“Gee, thanks for your input, Chatty Cathy.”
“It’s um, blue? There are a lot of blue… things?”
“I don’t suppose you’ve got in-flight cocktail service?” Obviously Cas doesn’t, unless he’s been cursed to have a mini-bar up his butt too, but a drink to take the edge off would almost tip whatever this bizarre experience is all the way over into downright pleasant.
“What do you think’s going on with Cas?” Dean asks later, when little kidnapped Tommy has been returned to his white picket suburban home, and Dean and Sam are safely behind salt lines, stripping down to their T-shirts and boxers in their crappy hotel of the night. Sam got a fair amount of splashback slime on him, and once the excitement died down and Dean had time to look at his own clothes, it turns out he got even more. Neither he or Sam has noticed any typical spell effects, but showers are in order anyhow, because better safe than sorry.
Dear God, Castiel regrets ever wanting to decorate. He rubs both hands over his face and arches his back in a stretch. “What time is it?”
Cas groans again and pinches the bridge of his nose. “You can debate this until kingdom come, Dean, but I keep telling you that having a pet Unicorn would be absolutely

There’s nothing else that Dean can do, and he’s really unsettled by it. Worry is boiling up hot in the back of his throat; burning and painful. The worst thing about all of this is that there’s nothing he can do. Dean can think until kingdom come, but he’s probably never going to figure out what the hell he could do to help Cas and Gabriel.

A half-hearted growl rumbles in his chest and his upper lip curls back in a weak snarl when the SWAT takes a step into the bathroom. Immediately, the SWAT takes a step back again and raises his hands with his palms out.
“I – I –” Chuck looks around desperately, as if Sam and Kevin might come to his rescue from where they’re both watching over the display case. “I wouldn’t even know
When he’s playing video games on his own and there’s going to be food involved, Dean has a setup that keeps his hands grease free so he can play without issue. His arrangement involves sitting on the floor with a pillow under his ass and his back against the couch. He drags the table right up to his chest and puts his bowl or plate of food practically under his chin. This way, he can use the game controller in his lap and all he needs to do is tilt his head a little bit to eat whatever is on his plate. Usually he only does this if he’s got pizza or chips. It’s gotta be something easy to eat hands free or he doesn’t even bother.
“But what if it was a

find Cas?”
Apparently he doesn’t have to finish his thought, because Dean raises an eyebrow and cocks his head to the side. “Let me guess; you’re worried that I’m gonna jump you the moment we’re in bed. Am I right, or am I right?”
“And have you be distracted all day day?” Bobby snorts and Dean can picture him rolling his eyes. “Fuck no. Go do your thing and let me know if you’re able to make your next shift. I’ve got your ass covered here for today.”
“And you as well.” He shakes his hand once more. “I hope you have fun today.”
His hands won’t stop shaking from where they’re gripping Nike’s kennel tightly. She meows unhappily from inside of it, but that might be because he simply shoved her into it without a care for the claw marks on his forearms. They sting, but Castiel can’t feel them. Neither can he take his eyes off Gabriel’s crystal necklace. It hangs against his chest, flashing as slowly as the ones set up throughout at home – a home that is quickly falling behind them and one that Castiel isn’t sure he’ll ever see again.
“What’er you idjits doing in public?” Bobby calls out to them as Dean basically stumbles right past his booth. “Act your age, not your IQ.”
at games?
Laughing, Dean wipes fake sweat from his brow. “Thank God! My bruised ego wouldn’t be able to take another crushing defeat.”
Castiel shakes his head and moves his arm so he can tilt a smile his way. “You did a very good job for your first time, Dean.”

?” He’s all wide-eyed surprise and he holds Nike to his chest like she’s some kind of safety barrier between them. Considering her claws and teeth, she’d be a pretty effective one in the long run.
, but everything Cas does is so graceful and he’s probably secretly a fucking great dancer. Whenever he wears a tighter shirt than his usual sweaters, Dean can tell that he’s got a nice body and some killer hips. If they get a good sway going, they could probably hypnotize any man; straight or not. Oh yeah, these are definitely thoughts that he needs to get out of his head

“I’m glad you’re safe.” He rubs his thumb over the back of Cas’s hand and smiles. “And that you’re back. Welcome home, Cas.”
Although he was annoyed at him earlier, Castiel is very happy that Gabriel went to all the trouble to put these together for him. “Thank you. If you want me to check in at any point, just text me.”

pile would be subjected to a firing squad of snowballs from the remaining players. Castiel is certain that every other year his parents made sure to lose so he wouldn’t constantly be losing every year. Gabriel is a good six years older than him and always went all out when it came to a competition within the family.
. Flirt. With. Me.” Castiel might not pick up on all social behaviours, but he’s fairly certain that he would know if someone was flirting with him. He was uncomfortably aware of when Nick was flirting with him. And there are the various men and women who come to the café. Some leave their numbers on the cups when they return them to the counter, some ask him outright. He can tell and he is

“But you – but we –” Dean makes a few gestures with his hands before he drops them. “R-really?”
“I noticed.” Castiel coughs again and rubs at his eyes so the world isn’t so blurry. “I should have warned you that I was going to do that.” His hindsight is twenty/twenty, after all. After he’s caught his breath, he leans down once more. “Try not to do that again, okay?”

Oh the cheek to this one! Balthazar has always had an attitude since the first day they met, and sometimes it rubs Castiel’s nerves the wrong way. Perhaps that’s why he gets along so well with Gabriel. He’s lucky that he gives Castiel the respect owed him for being his boss (and an excellent one at that, he might add). Otherwise, he wouldn’t get off so easy for how absolutely

almost home. He can hardly contain his excitement now that they’re only an hour away from being back.
He’s considering actually saying something while they’re pulling a U-turn in the station parking lot so they can actually pull up right in front of the café, but then pretty much every thought leaves his head the moment he spots Cas and Jess waiting on the sidewalk for them. To start with, Jess looks amazing in tall boots with a dress peeking out from under her coat. Her hair is braided back from her face but it still flows down her back in a very Khaleesi style. If Dean wasn’t completely distracted by Cas right now, he would be totally jealous that Sam gets to go on a date with

“Of course I am.” He shrugs and ducks his head while playing his next work. “You’re my friend and I enjoy spending time with you.”
close.”
“Careful, Cas. The firefighters might love you for this.”
“That look. The one on your face.” He gestures at her, narrowing his eyes slightly.
The moment it’s his turn in the very short line, Tessa leans forward excitedly. “Sam’s washing dishes. I’ll get him in a second. First tell me what you’re bringing me today!”
Cas asks. His voice has a plaintive quality that is entirely unfair considering he just kidnapped Dean from the shower.
“Cas,” he hisses. “People will see us.”
The action grinds instantly to a halt.
“Bower. Right.” Dean is a little afraid he’s heard the word ‘bower’ before, in bodice-ripping romance novels.
Dean rolls his eyes at the heavens that are definitely not going to save him.
Not that he has a bodice currently anyway.
rumbles the monster.
He nods his head—which disturbingly is also most of his body—definitively, apparently more pleased with this second, not in the least bit clearer, answer. Dean is trying to squeeze past and get to his pants, but he’s not having a great deal of luck. Cas as an octopus is maybe not Chrysler Building-sized, but he’s still pretty huge.
“No! No cartwheel anything! Please! Just.” Dean takes a calming breath and tries not to sound like he’s about to piss the britches he isn’t actually wearing. “Just fly in a nice, straight line to wherever you were planning on taking me, okay, Cas?”
Despite being naked.
“Fine, fine. I’ll stop,” she replies. She makes a ‘whatever, no big deal’ waving motion, and then leans down and pats Cas on the head. “In a minute.”
And yet, somehow what comes out is, “It’s beautiful.”
Cas says,
The next twenty seconds are the same terrifying mix of adrenaline, confusion, and life-threatening danger that the worst hunts are, except everyone’s on the same side and no one seems to have noticed except Dean.
he yells at Cas.
Eagle-Cas is to the size of a regular eagle approximately as octo-Cas was to the octopus Dean saw in the children’s petting pool at the Monterey Bay Aquarium one summer when he was ten and Dad was doing a case in Salinas.
—Wait, is that the
The scenery, when Dean can bear to look down at it, is really quite beautiful, a vast green ocean of trees and fields. Towns and cities float by like islands. And if Dean’s heart is still trying to jump out of his rib cage and escape, the rest of him is starting to feel a tiny bit calmer now that the ride’s evened out. Cas isn’t always the most trustworthy ally. Even when he wasn’t under a mysterious spell that Dean doesn’t know the purpose of but that can’t be good, he let all the monster souls out of purgatory and released the Leviathan. He stabbed Balthazar, who Dean personally thinks was a dick, but was still Cas’ brother and friend. And worst as far as Dean’s concerned—even if maybe it shouldn’t be—he broke Sam’s wall.

And thanks so much to the organizers of the Supernatural Reverse Bang. This is my second year doing the challenge, and both times it's been a wonderful experience.
"Having Jimmy Novak's form again? I don't see why not."
Dean flinches guiltily and holds the tire iron in a defensive position as he whirls around to see Cas’ majestic but annoying eagle-like form. Cas shows no signs of being bothered by Dean’s escape attempt.
“It’s nice and uh, leafy, Cas? But maybe we should concentrate on reversing the witch’s curse? Because even for crazy-you, this is unusual. How ‘bout you bring me back to the motel and Sam and I can do some research?”
Everyone stares at Dean.
Meg is still giggling gently. “It’s fine, Clarence. No worries.”
—“that I would totally love to tap. But in case you haven’t noticed, right now you’re kind of an eagle, so”—
Sam looks up from his Search the Web or whatever. His mouth flattens out in an irritated line. “As a matter of fact, no, I can’t. And it’s annoying when you push all the research off on me and then complain I’m not doing it to your specifications. Your ‘I’m too dumb to buy a laptop and do my part’ shtick is manipulative and I only put up with it because I can’t figure out how to make you stop. I didn’t mean to say that though; please don’t ask me any more questions.”
“Hey! Hold on a minute there, Terror of the Deep. Are you trying to take me outside? Because first of all, I can’t fit. And b, I’m naked.”
Sam landed with one arm underneath him. Dean shoves him onto his side so he won’t wake up with pins and needles.
“Listen, Cas. Not to diss your nest or whatever—“
And that, thank Chuck, is when Cas shows up in a flutter of wings.
Dean slaps his hand across his mouth again. He definitely doesn’t want to say his admission of gayness for Cas’ angel ass is the gospel truth. But that’s the problem with curses; they’re really not in it for your comfort.
Cas intones mournfully.
Dean turns to Cas. Cas is licking the fur between the toe beans on one of his gigantic forepaws. He’s really quite regal. And kind of adorable too.
He cocks his head to the side in the same bird-like fashion he always has, only it looks even birdier now for obvious reasons, and adds,
The coven job’s a mess. They knew it would be, going in fast after a single day of research—witches and missing kids, man, Dean’s least favorite combo in the entire world. Sam gets the leader nice and easy; a clean head shot as they burst through the basement door. The knife she was holding above poor, screaming, eight year old Timmy Fothergill’s sternum clatters safely to the floor, so that’s a win if they can hold it. But the room is packed like it’s convention week at the Hilton of Evil. Dean shoots two more, and it’s barely a dent in the crowd.
~*~*~
Cas doesn’t make any further threatening moves, so Dean squats down and checks Sam’s pulse. It does seem strong, and he looks peaceful, if—given the relative sizes of the bathroom and Sam—somewhat squished.
I’m down to bang. It’s just”—Dean claps a hand over his mouth in horror. He definitely, definitely meant to say ‘No way are we going to pound town; I don’t bat for the rainbow team’, not ‘yes I would love to play touched by an angel right on my junk’.
Cas’ voice calls out from behind him.
“Well, I assure you—” Cas starts.
Dean reaches for his duffle. He’ll need an extra pair of pants.
“I’m sure I don’t want to know, but where did you get the… pebble?” Dean asks as he accompanies Cas back into his nest.
“Pretty much.”
“Not right now though!” he adds, when Cas gathers his wings in a way that might presage Dean being left alone atop a freezing cold skyscraper again.
Like, a lot.
Cas slithers across the cracked linoleum floor, propelled on all of his remaining six tentacles that aren’t cradling Dean to his jelly-like bosom, past Sam’s snoring body, out into the hotel room where Dean was trying to go not thirty seconds previously, and from there across the hideous orange and chartreuse carpet towards the door.
And now in the hall.
And he saved Dean from Hell. He flew Dean the endless distance from Alastair’s dungeon back to life and Sam. He didn’t drop Dean then. He won’t let Dean fall now.
Meg arches an eyebrow. “Aren’t I?”
Sam.”
In the distance, a city large enough to have a skyline of high rises and office towers is coming into view. Dean doesn’t recognize it from this vantage point like he undoubtedly would from the ground.
~*~*~
Dean had managed to forget briefly in the fray that he was naked except for his overshirt. “Her, you can eat.”
He grabs the blue Carhartt—which, sure enough, fits him perfectly, if perhaps not as long in the shirt tails department as his lack of pants necessitates—and untangles a sky blue barrette and a Lowe’s brand tire iron with a lovely blue handle from the nest walls. He ducks under an arch of branches, and creeps out through the foyer or whatever. He was unaware before today that nests could even have foyers. You’d think with all the Animal Planet Sam used to watch as a kid, he would’ve heard of nest foyers if they existed. Maybe it’s an angel thing.
And before Dean has time to reply, he disappears in a flutter of wings.
“Is that lion thing…
“Mmm,” Sam says noncommittally, typing away at his laptop.
Dean considers jumping off the building. There’s a guard rail, like there sometimes is on skyscrapers, but he could probably climb over it before anyone recovered enough from the shock of his outburst to stop him.
where Woody Guthrie sings about seeing below him that ribbon of highway. It’s not a vantage point Dean enjoys.
And it turns out their demon patron’s there too, all decked out like a gothlord to personally accept their tribute of the week. He does the handwavey thing demons always do, and Sam and Dean crash back against the cinder block wall. The live witches drag the dead ones into a corner and Gothlord monologues at Sam and Dean while the poor little rugrat sobs for his mom.
“So what you’re saying is we need to lie low and not do anything dangerous for forty-eight hours so the truth won’t bite us in the ass on a hunt?”
. But he can’t. Apparently he doesn’t mean it.
He digs deep for other possible compliments besides “wow, blue like your eyes”, which would be both repetitive and kind of gay.
“Put me down this instant! Your claws are hurting me, dude!”
Dean makes a series of token attempts at escape, but while Cas is less the consistency of concrete than he’s been in the past when Dean has hit him, he’s apparently equally impervious to damage. He slimes his way obliviously down the corridor and through the lobby. Both of which, by virtue of being the combined public areas of the cheapest hotel in the entire state of Indiana, at three p.m. on a Wednesday, are thankfully empty except for the clerk. The clerk is watching TV in Spanish and doesn’t notice anything amiss.
Sam sighs. “Yeah, okay. Can we all give the questions a rest now? Especially you, Meg. You’re not helping.”
“Yeah yeah, whatever,” Dean replies, because it’s not like he wants to sit there twiddling his thumbs and looking at Sam’s ugly mug while Sam does all the Cas-finding work anyhow.
“Still naked here, Bud,” Dean points out.
Which he doesn’t read.
An especially unattractive witch with blood red fingernails and purple hair runs to where the fallen demon lies, and stands possessively over his husk of a meatsuit. She snarls Latin at Cas, and a burst of green rushes from her hands and crashes into Cas with the deafening roar of a concussion grenade. He staggers under it, but if he screams, Dean can’t hear it over the ringing in his ears from the spell. Tendrils of magic spark around Cas, writhing against the walls and falling from the ceiling in slimy glops, filling the room with green and purple so bright it’s an effort for Dean not to waste precious shooting time shielding his eyes. He squints and puts a bullet in the witch’s chest, and Sam takes out the other two. Cas is grimacing in pain, with his body bowed forward over the ruins of his dress shirt, and his hands scrabbling to brush the green and purple goop from his skin. Sam’s got some slime on him too, but he shows no signs that it’s bothering him.
