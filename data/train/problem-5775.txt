Bucky threw his arm around her. "You're safe. People actually to this hospital to get out of their unsafe houses."
"We'll have to fix that, won't we?" Tony clapped his hands together. "We need to go grocery shopping."
He met Bucky in the living room, where he was quickly falling asleep on the couch. The soldier's eyes opened when he saw Steve entering the room again.
Steve gathered up the charts and tore off his gown. "Goodbye, Tony."
And their date was...picture perfect. The couple had never been to Navy Pier, so Tony took her to a restaurant that overlooked the water. It wasn't a sight with ferry boats like they had back in New York, but the way the city glittered was beautiful all the same.
Steve chuckled and felt his face grow warm again. "R-right. I live here."
“How cute for you to bring her here,” Tony replied, “Maybe she can give us all a lesson on cellular respiration.”
"We have one! We have a heart!" She threw her arms around Steve. "Someone from Northwestern is bringing the heart right now. They said they'd be in the lobby in twenty minutes!"
When the two arrived at the grocery store, Steve felt a little nostalgic. The store was right around the corner from where Steve grew up, and after all these years, it was kept mostly the same. There was some fresh paint on the wall this time, but the aisle signs were still old and faded as they were when he was in high school. The owners of the store, the Bautistas, ran over to Steve as he walked in the door. They had only heard about Steve's medical school tales from his mother, and they were in disbelief to see that the little boy who ran around the aisles was finally a grown up.
The mother wiped her tears away. "How long will that take?"
God, he was so
“Ready to scrub in?” There was a hint of concern in her voice as if she already could read his mind.
"All the more reason to take some extra food!"
Katie sat up eagerly, glancing at Steve before going back to Tony. "No way. You're my doctor too? Did they all hire you from the same modeling company or something?"
"Why didn't you tell me?" Steve blurted out. "There were so many chances. We've been together for months, and I have to find out from some woman who could basically be a movie star tell me that you're married!"
Steve closed the gap between them, finally melting against Tony's lips. The familiar scratch of Tony's stubble made Steve shiver, a feeling he could never get over no matter how many times he thought he was over that sensation. The intern's hands found Tony's hair, relishing the thick strands and how they felt after months of being away.
The song finally ends, fading away quietly as the pianist’s fingers flutter off the ivory keys. he takes a deep breath, satisfied with himself. After weeks of trying to perfect the classic song, he finally accomplished his goal.
"Are your parents doctors?"
Steve was speechless. "Well, I—I just figured people would be weird about it."
"She's first on the list." Sharon twirled in the chair, cellphone pressed to her ear. She nearly fell out of her chair when someone finally picked up her call. "Hello?! Yes! I'm calling from Chicago Medical..."
"She was asking for you too," Tony replied, "She said you saved her life. Pretty good for your first day, running a code all by yourself."
"And you're just a know-it-all when it comes to the hospital's architecture?" Sharon asked. She laughed when Bucky glared at her. "You're right though. This is one of the best hospitals in the city. We'll be okay, Nat."
"Leave the NICU, Dr. Stark. I have patients."
"Of course," Tony replied, "You figured it out. Book the OR and scrub in."
He can’t resist pressing his lips to Steve’s cheek, and his heart is soaring to see the blonde’s eyebrows furrowing together. Tony moves in again to kiss the other cheek, chuckling to himself when Steve relaxes and settles against his chest.
"Shouldn't we call Wilson?" Steve asked, growing nervous as he put his stethoscope to the boy's chest. "There are no breath sounds on the right lung."
"Ma." Steve returned the stethoscope around his neck and removed his gloves. "Little guy's a trooper. Still doesn't have a name yet."
Steve closed the gap between them and pressed his lips to Tony's. He thought it would make him feel better, that maybe all the pain would melt away for once. That the pain he felt all these weeks would maybe disappear, and maybe Tony's touch would bring him peace. He let Tony touch his hair, his chest, his hips, hoping that his misery would end finally, but it didn't. He let Tony kiss every inch of exposed skin, letting himself feel the soft scratch of stubble. He waited for the pain to subside, for the same warmth and happiness he felt before, but it never came.
Steve rolls his eyes, but blush eventually spreads across his face and neck. Tony beams at the blond; it’s moments like this that make it a little easier to be away.
, wanted to kiss him again. Watching Steve's lips move as he spoke wasn't helping with Tony trying to focus.
Tony’s always the first one awake. Even with a tremendous lack of sleep over the years, he always wakes to the sight of his favorite super soldier fast sleep, mouth slightly agape. Even America’s golden boy snores when he sleeps.
He tried to ignore it at first; they were always going to be together. Sure, they were just a couple of dumb kids, barely out of high school, but he can feel it, God, he
He means that, though. That’s not part of the playing along. He’s loved Tony Stark from the moment they met; that he knew to be true.
Suddenly, Steve's face was hot. "He's not my
“This is perfect.”
Steve blanched. "You're working with Dr. Stark?"
"You okay?" Nat asked Bucky.
"And so do you. So, so, good." Steve cleared his throat. "Not that you ever stopped looking good. Ever."
Tony made a fuss at first, feigning weakness and the inability to walk just ten feet to the sofa in the living room. The soldier sighed, but he put on a smile and carried his husband to the living room.
Pepper opened her mouth to speak but she was cut off by her pager going off. It was 911 for the hospital. Tony's pager began buzzing as well, and they both sighed. They bid farewell to the counselor who seemed almost thankful that the session ended short. They started making their way out to the city street where their cars were parked.
Steve was surprised. "Oh, Peter didn't have a name for him—"
“You promised to love me for better or worse, you said that!”
"Sounds like your teammates better work on catching you better if you're going to win, huh?"
He took the packet, nodding wordlessly to the lawyer before slamming the door shut and groaning in frustration. The papers weren’t a surprise, exactly—mostly a reminder that his life was going to complete and utter shit.
"I am," Steve replied, "I didn't know you settled on a name."
"Where's your boyfriend, Rogers?" He slurred. Steve couldn't think of his name; maybe it was John or Jake. All he remembered was that he hated the idiot's smile more than anything. "Aren't you supposed to be getting it on in the on-call rooms?"
"Not funny."
Steve took a step back, glancing at Tony. The neurosurgeon was smiling, eyes crinkled in happiness as he saw the look of astonishment in the intern's eyes. Tony turned off the headlamp that was around his head, allowing the resident and nursing staff to close up the patient.
He leaned down and pressed a kiss to his mother's forehead. Sarah sighed and hugged her son. While her back was turned, Steve's smile quickly morphed into a frown. Tony winked and turned the corner before Steve could say anything more.
After hours of calls, Steve decided to take a break and check on Alex. She stood in front of her daughter's incubator, holding back tears. Her eyes locked with Steve and she smiled.
"Go rest! I can watch her." Steve helped her out from the rocking chair and back to the wheelchair. "I'll update you if anything changes."
The kitten would also occupy the extra room they kept for Peter, crying out to the teenager. Tony had to close the doors any rooms that would even mildly smell like Steve or Peter, and Cheeseburger was
The interns said nothing more and eventually split off from each other to continue their errands. The apartment had not been stocked for weeks—they grew tired of eating cereal straight out of the box. Consequently, Steve made it a point to buy food that didn't come from a box. He had nearly forgotten what it was like to have fruit and vegetables in the house.
Steve gasped. "You're part of
"Daniela Sanchez, nine years old, intern injuries as well as injuries to to the head after a car crash," The paramedic explained. "We've been trying to maintain her pulse but she keeps crashing."
"It looks like we're trapped," Tony said coolly, "good to know one of the best hospitals in the city has faulty elevators."
"Barnes. Suction,
But then again, Steve didn't mind. He was still trying to slow his heart rate after shocking a sixteen year old girl's heart for the first time.
"Good morning, Dr. Stark, Dr. Potts-Stark." Steve's voice seemed to grow a little shaky now that he saw them together. "I had a cup for Dr. Stark, but I, uh, can run and get you some coffee, too, Dr. Potts-Stark?"
The soldier placed the thermometer on Tony's forehead, sighing when the scanner displayed the temperature. "102."
"Fifteen says he leaves the patient with a colostomy bag for life."
“Tony Stark,” he slurred, holding his hand out. “I don’t believe we’ve met.”
The mixer was supposed to help. He hung out with some of the interns, mingling and taking a sip of the champagne if things got awkward. Last week, the nerves got the best of him when his mother had sent him a text: "good luck saving lives next week!"
"Please find Stark and tell him?" He put on his best smile. "I'll do your scut for a week."
"Now that you mention it, I'm feeling kinda faint..."
Steve flopped onto the bed, groaning as he hid under the covers.
She took his hand and squeezed, wondering if he felt the same bittersweetness in her heart. Although their relationship had ended three years ago, she couldn't help but ache for him all over again.
"Any other charts you need me to sign?"
He knew his friends were right about Tony. Coffee is just never just coffee when it comes from your ex-boyfriend. He didn't want them to be right; he just missed Tony.
“You’re okay now,” Steve assured him, “just sit back and get hydrated.”
Or, maybe the rush was just him being horny. (That
, well, he forgot how to speak.
Maybe it was because he had a bad day, maybe it was because he was sick of having bad days, bad weeks, maybe it was because he got kicked off his case, he had no idea what possessed him to stay, but Steve found himself sitting beside Tony on the bed. A good distance away, far enough away to be out of range from the sweet smell of Tony's cologne, but closer than they'd been in a while.
Pepper couldn't help but notice how close the two had become in the weeks that Alex and Andy have been in the hospital. When Steve was initially kicked off the case, he could still be found coming in after his shifts and offering cups of coffee to the exhausted mother. Alex was calmer with Steve checking in, which was part of the reason she let Steve back on the case. Calm mothers meant a calm NICU and calm nurses.
Tony only felt sick to his stomach.
"I was looking all over for you," Tony whispered. "I—I need to talk to you—"
"Right. See you later, Tony."
"I guess it didn't really come up last night," Tony said, taking a step toward him. The smell of his cologne and reminders of last night made Steve ache.
She was perfect. The first two years of their relationship were perfect. Steve nearly had his heart set on marrying that girl.
pretty," Katie explained, "But Dr. Stark is not just pretty. He is more than pretty. He's gorgeous. Calvin Klein material."
"I...I care about her. I did love her, once upon a time."
That day at the hospital was another day of scut duties; Steve was spending the day taking patients to radiology or running blood to and from the blood bank. He was so lost in the routine of mundane activities that he didn't notice the same dark-haired girl waiting at the front desk of the surgical wing.
Tony." Steve could barely breathe. "I can't sleep, I can't fucking
Starks?"
"You're right. I'm sorry."
Most of all, he hated how many empty coffee cups that had the same chicken scratch that now lay in the locker. Steve gathered them all into his arms, dumping them into the bin and stomping down on them for good measure. He added the rest of the garbage the bin and left the room feeling just as empty as his locker.
It was just Steve's luck that he and the rest of the interns were assigned to Dr. Potts-Stark's cases for the next few weeks. That meant hours and days spent checking on her patients, reporting to her, scrubbing in on surgeries with her.
Steve left the supply closet before he could let any of his emotions get the best of him. He was going to work, he was going to forget, just for a few hours, that he didn't spend months falling for a guy who was married.
The intern turned back to baby Andy, who still laid asleep in the incubator.
Steve punched the soldier's arm. "What the hell is wrong with you?"
The interns were more than exhausted. They weren't just fatigued; they were wiped out after their first shift.
Bucky slumped down on the gurney next to Natasha, and Steve found his place next to Sharon. Natasha's nose crinkled up in disgust when she saw a bit of the rectal gel on Bucky's coat.
Bucky couldn't believe his eyes. He had made his way through the skin and the tissue underneath, the appendix was finally exposed. Red and inflamed, seeing the organ was terrifying. It was natural, it happened all the time, and he'd performed appendectomies on models before. Still, seeing the actual organ in the flesh took his breath away.
"You and Stark, Rogers?!" Bucky had clapped his hand on Steve's shoulder as he sat down at the lunch table. "Shit, dude. Getting it on with the attendings."
He wasn't new to the city; he had lived here growing up. Now that he was back, most of his friends had either moved away to other states, other neighborhoods, away from the bustle of the city and into suburbia. People were getting married, having kids, and city life wasn't for everyone. Every time he checked social media, he saw that another person had just gotten engaged or bought a house in a new, shiny neighborhood a few hours away from the city. It was odd, knowing that people were being grown ups, settling down, and he was back home, single and just now starting his life.
The dog seemed to be smiling just as wide as the owner was. Tony couldn't blame them; getting attention from Steve made him smile, too.
Idiotic.
"Dude, let me have this! I'm trying to make it up to Nat!"
It was the Captain Rogers look. Everyone (mostly Tony) teased him for how he always had the same furrowed brows, the crossed arms, looking like a disappointed grandpa. He knew that Steve meant well, but now that he was sitting here on the bed, not wanting to reveal how sick he was, he really just wanted Rogers to stop giving him that damn look.
Fury smiled. "Damn. You all must be terrified of me, huh?"
There was a beat of silence before Rhodey cleared his throat. "Well, are you happy?"
The neurosurgeon smiled. "Thanks, Pep."
"That's boring," Bucky retorted, "you need a rebound. Something to get Tony off your mind, someone new—"
Tony laughed, a weight lifting off his chest briefly. "With the whole surgical unit at your apartment, I don't think it'll help if everyone sees us."
“I hope you’re not kidding, because I need it,” Tony replies, “I just…can’t believe we ran out of coffee. I
The two enjoyed their chicken soup together, avoiding any conversation about Andy or medicine. Even though Alex had been through hell and back, and the last thing she needed was to talk about medicine.
Steve leaned down and kissed Tony's cheek. "I like expensive red wine if you're still trying to get in my pants this weekend."
The intern focused on his charts, not wanting to look at him.
“No, no, it’s good, I promise.” Tony sits up straight, trying to combat the fatigue of studying late into the night. “Besides, you look really cute over a computer screen. Definitely do not wanna miss this.”
The OB-GYN forced a smile. "That's sweet of you Dr. Rogers, but I'm okay."
"Ten bucks he can't even make a cut."
The bar was crowded—it was as if the entire intern class had showed up that night. That was to be expected anyway; everyone wanted to drink their worries away before the biggest day of their lives.
He was not this person. Not the person to pine and wonder about someone he'd just met. Steve wasn't much for one night stands; he always had long term partners. At least, up until medical school. His partners just didn't seem to understand him—medicine was going to come first. He needed to be on the top of his game.
The soldier left with a smirk on his face, leaving Steve as the last intern to pack up his stuff. He was just about to leave for his apartment when he got a text from Tony.
"Why not?" She traced a finger on his cheek gently. The touch was so subtle but it sent a chill down Tony's spine. He almost wanted to melt into her, kiss like he would before, touch her like he would before.
“Take care, Tony. Call me when you land.” Steve squeezes his hand, silently begging for him to stay. He won’t stay though, and Steve’s heart is a little more heavy because of it.
"I don't want to fight, please." Pepper took a step closer to him. "I...I miss you, Tony. I
"Loving you is
"J-Jackson." The boy trembled as he spoke.
"Fifty says he can fucking do it."
because Steve is staying in this little town while Tony goes off to one of the most prestigious schools in the country. Part of him—the horrible, incredibly selfish part of him—wished Tony would stay,
Pepper blinked in surprise. "He's on my service!"
For some reason, Steve felt like the wind had been punched out of his lungs.
"I'm sorry," Steve repeated, as if reading Tony's mind. "I shouldn't have asked. I'm, uh...I'm just tired. And kind of being  a dick. Sorry."
She held her ground and barely looked up at Steve. "Do you need something?"
Sitting at the bar all by himself was so goddamn awkward. Everyone else around him seemed to be on a date or had a group around them; he felt like the only one who came here alone. He quickly downed his beer and another round, hoping that the buzz would kick in quick.
"Are you trying to get wasted at my place? I heard there are going to be lots of nurses and booze."
Tony led him to a staircase, quiet enough so the two could talk. Steve felt dizzy.
"C'mon, I'm just saying it's nice that I can finally talk to you—"
"Congratulations."
“I’m Tony, by the way.”
As he clipped off the appendix, his scissors seemed to snag on the stump remaining. Blood pooled in the abdomen. Bucky's heart thumped loudly in his ears. He panicked as he looked at Dr. Fury, who remained stoic.
Not that Steve wasn't attentive already. The man noticed the tiniest details, like the difference between Tony's fourth or fifth cup of coffee for the day, but knowing that a sixth cup would be far too much. He'd notice on the phone if Tony was growing anxious from all the meetings and plans he had that day, and he'd go up to his office make sure Tony took a break for tea. He'd know when Tony was getting far too tired in the lab, and when it was time to sweep the engineer off his feet to get back into bed.
He nearly jumped ten feet in the air when his pager went off. The neurosurgeon paced the room for a few minutes, trying to shake the odd feeling in his stomach. When he heard a gentle knock on the door, it felt like his heart fell at his feet.
He has
"Book an OR now," The doctor instructed. She turned back to her patient, putting her stethoscope to the woman's chest.
Steve’s breath catches in his throat when he hears Tony’s voice crackling a little. He feigns a smile anyway, hoping to cheer Tony up. “Me too. But not in that bed. We’d barely fit together in those tiny dorm beds.”
Steve injected some morphine into the boy's body, then held the boy's hand as Sharon took a scalpel to her hands. The boy whimpered the sight, and Steve tried to avert his eyes away from what Sharon was doing. Jackson screamed into Steve's chest as the tube was placed, but soon his breathing improved as the blood drained from his lung. Steve placed an oxygen mask over the boy's mouth, feeling relieved as the boy relaxed.
Steve turned around, wiping his hands on a towel before pressing one of them against Tony's forehead. He frowned and wandered through the kitchen, rummaging through the cabinets.
No phone number, not even a last name. Just Tony, the ridiculously gorgeous guy at the bar.
The chief resident smiled. "Get outta here before She-Stark sees you."
to get a life.
Steve pulled away, breathless, tears streaming down his face. Tony paused, eyes growing wide when he saw Steve's fears. The neurosurgeon brushed them away quickly and moved forward to kiss him again, but Steve pulled away once more.
They had no idea what was about to come.
Shit. What the hell was he supposed to do?
Steve snapped back to reality as Dr. Potts-Stark removed the NICU gown. She bid the intern goodnight, not wanting to spend another minute with him. It wasn't fair of her to be angry at him—Steve had no idea she existed—but she was still hurt nonetheless.
Tony just about melted as Steve kissed his cheek and slipped back under the covers.
“Ignoring you now!” Rhodey called from the bedroom.
Rhodey sat up straighter. "Not from..."
Dammit.
The blond peeked over the edge of the bed, grateful that the man beside him was still asleep. Knocked out with his mouth slightly agape, he looked so peaceful. Short but lush strands of dark, slightly salt-and-peppered hair, the longest lashes he'd ever seen, perfectly groomed facial hair; he was a goddamn model.
Tony pursed his lips together. He nodded curtly at Steve. "I'll have to speak with you later, Dr. Rogers."
“I’m tired, and it’s late.” Steve pulls him in a little tighter; Tony swoons every single time.
"It's not
Tony paled. "If you're the reason why they won't stop calling me—"
Tony folded his arms. "Play with my hair some more and then I'll decide."
Steve sat back down on the floor. What was he supposed to do? Was he supposed to wake him up? Should he kick him out? Should he make him breakfast? Did he even have his phone number? He's a fucking Calvin Klein model, and if Steve remembered last night correctly, he wouldn't mind asking him for another drink tonight. And tomorrow night. And maybe the night after that.
He was never nervous. He wasn't nervous when he met the doctor he first shadowed when he was a teenager. He wasn't nervous when it came to examining cadavers and having to cut them open. He wasn't nervous when it came to putting a needle in someone's arm for the first time—everything usually came naturally to him when it came to medicine. However, the only thing he can think about is actually putting the stethoscope to someone's chest and worrying about if he could tell the difference between a heart murmur or if he just couldn't hear the patient's heart.
The lights returned, illuminating the darkness and revealing the ever handsome and charming neurosurgeon. Steve waited for the usual hum of the elevator, but everything was completely silent. The intern pressed the emergency button several times, expecting to hear some alarm sounds. Nothing.
"Uh, there are more at the nursing station if you're really looking for work to do." Wilson narrowed his eyes. "Rogers, are you alright?"
Tony chuckles, still tinkering away at his latest project. “Patience is a virtue, sweetheart.”
The other interns’ expressions matched a deer in headlights. Steve managed to keep his cool and a smile on his face.
Unfortunately, the morning was quickly ending, and it was nearly time for Tony to return to the hospital. He tried to get out of bed quietly, sliding his arm out from Steve gently. The subtle movements were still enough to wake the blond. Steve rubbed his eyes and chuckled.
"You guys are assholes," Steve said as he reached over to Bucky's soda, "Crazy, obsessed-with-other-people's-love-lives, nosy assholes. Don't you have other things to worry about?"
Tony nodded. He fiddled with the bedsheets for a while, searching, wondering, aching to say something to him and break the awful silence that sat between them.
Steve winked before kneeling onto the kitchen floor. "Of course not. We're just getting to know each other right now."
"She'll be okay." Steve cleared his throat, embarrassed now that Pepper was looking right at him. "All those wires and tubes, they look scary, but she's not in pain. Your little girl is strong, Alex."
"It's okay," Tony replied gently, "I just wanted to do something nice for you."
Steve nodded quickly, ready to leave the gallery before Wilson reached out and stopped him. For the first time in months, the man seemed genuinely concerned. The intern thought he was going insane.
"Thank you, Dr. Rogers. I appreciate it. It's been so scary," she said, voice trembling a little, "I sit here and watch her breathe, and I'm scared to let myself sleep. I only napped since a nurse said her vitals were good for now."
Even though Steve was successful in saving Katie's life, he still received a lecture from Wilson. It felt like a teacher scolding him really, as Wilson reminded him he shouldn't be running codes by himself. Could have killed her, Wilson reminded him.
. The neurosurgeon was so suave and dangerously pretty from Steve's perspective, smiling up at him. But his pager was still going off, and he wasn't trying to get an ass-kicking on his first shift.
“Where’s everyone else?”
Purple Stethoscope, who Steve learned was named Sharon, nudged Bucky. "Quit being annoying. Not everyone wants to disclose their private life to strangers."
“Something wrong?”
As if on cue, Bucky ran up to the nurses' station, panting as he tried to catch his breath. He threw his charts on the counter and forced a smile on his face.
A young teenage girl was seizing violently in the gurney, with the paramedics listing off her vitals to Dr. Wilson. Steve's head was suddenly cloudy, like he forgot what medicine was; it sounded like a foreign language in his mind.
"What if there was an aneurysm?" Steve continued, "What if when she fell, it burst."
And just like that, he was a goner all over again.
Wilson did not look amused in the slightest. "Did you hear anything I said about the patient in 3655?"
"How so?" Tony was holding his breath now.
The blond was puzzled. “What the hell is wrong with you guys?”
"The question of the century, Rogers." Tony sighed. "Before I moved to Chicago, Howard was planning to retire. Dr. Happy Hogan was the chief then, since I turned it down before. Howard insisted I stepped up once he retired, and I actually said yes. I was going to tell Pepper the news when I found Happy right in the bed next to her. I thought it was a one time thing, but it had been going on for several weeks."
The intern softened for a moment. “You were a wreck, how could I not feel bad?”
, what century is this?"
Steve nodded quickly as he took the chart. The interns split up to check on their patients, and Steve tried to clear his head. Tony was probably arguing with his parents. Maybe his other family members. He was suddenly struck with the realization that he didn't know much about Tony, only parts and pieces of his childhood. Nothing about the life he had as an adult.
"Nothing fancy," the counselor explained, "but I think you guys need to see each other outside of work. Outside of therapy."
You slept with—"
Natasha scowled. "It's six am."
Tony bites back his own grin, feeling a little more confident after his encounter with a wonderful stranger.
The sound grows louder as the pianist continues the tune; the melody swells gradually and fades away once more. Steve shouldn’t be surprised to be hearing music students practicing in this building, but the tune is so light and angelic, he can’t help but be a little intrigued.
Steve had no idea where his surge of confidence was coming from, but it was now or never. He fished around his pockets for a marker, taking Tony's hand and writing down his cell phone number. Tony took the opportunity to gently pull the blond close and kiss him. Steve froze for a moment until he melted into Tony's lips. The intern immediately dropped the marker, using his free hand to run it through Tony's hair. The scratch of neurosurgeons facial hair on his lips and chin was fucking addictive, so much so that Steve found himself pushing him onto the bed. Tony hummed in response and nearly fell apart when he felt Steve shaking the lab coat off his shoulders.
Steve wanted to keep the damn kitten so bad that he lied about knowing how to take care of one, which Tony very quickly found out. The little furball small enough to fit in one of the soup bowls, but it took the both of them to wrestle him into staying still for a bath.
There were several cuts on the woman's face. Her strawberry blonde hair was streaked with blood.
Steve snatched it back from the soldier. "That's how I take my coffee. Tony knows what I order every time." He rolled his eyes when everyone gave him annoyed glances. "This is friendly coffee! People can be friends after breakups, or whatever you call breaking up with your married boyfriend."
"Seems like forever ago was the last time I held you like this," she reminisced, "I missed it."
"Great, actually. And me? I’m just fucking
Sarah raised her eyebrows, as if to say
"Fine, fine! You win!"
The little boy's eyes watered. "Where is my sister? Where is Jo?"
Soon enough, the on-call doctor from neuro came and examined the scans. The patient was soon admitted, and the duo returned to their usual flow of patients in the pit. As the night continued and patients were either admitted or sent home, the ER grew quiet. Eventually, Bucky joined them in the pit, crashing onto one of the empty patient beds from exhaustion.  While Bucky laid passed out in the bed, Sharon quickly noticed that Steve grew a little restless, as if he were expecting a certain someone to greet them in the pit.
“Use your words, sweetheart.”
"Hey," Steve called out, "Your history said that you fell before seizing. Did you fall any other time than that?"
"That nick name is never gonna leave me, huh?" Steve smiled as he poured three glasses of water. "Your name's Megan, right?"
At first, Steve thought he was having a heart attack. His chest—it felt like there was a freight truck sitting right on top of him, pressing down on his rib cage and making it difficult to breathe. He could barely fill his lungs with any air, and his vision grew fuzzy around the edges. He had to force himself to sit down and finally get oxygen to his brain.
Alex smiled. "I don't mind."
There were only a few items in the fridge: some beer, cheese that was probably spoiled, leftovers from wherever he ate last, and some coffee cream. Steve had only moved into this apartment a few days ago, and he meant to go out for groceries the night before his first day. And well...that didn't quite turn out as planned.
"Quit complaining and do some paperwork." Sharon handed the boys a couple of binders from the stack of post-op patients that were assigned from Wilson. "Wilson's emergency surgeries from last night are really piling up with his regular patients."
The man chuckled abruptly, and Steve felt foolish until the man gave him a soft smile. "We don't have to do anything. I can just be the guy at the bar, and that'll be it."
"Tell your mom that we made those eggrolls she was asking about, will you,
"He was eating from the trash!" Peter's lip wobbled slightly, enough to pull on Tony's heart a little. "He was eating a leftover cheeseburger in an alley, Mr. Stark!"
Bucky mumbled more apologies as Steve led him to the other couch in the spare bedroom. Soon enough, the soldier quickly fell asleep. Once everyone was settled, Steve went back to the living room, not bothering to clean up the mess. That would be a tomorrow problem.
Steve was speechless. Somehow, he had forgotten. Forgotten completely that someone was watching them that day. The nurses behind Megan didn't try to stop their laughter now; seeing Steve's reaction only furthered the giggling. The intern cleared his throat and poured more glasses of water for them. They were just drunk—they had no idea what they were talking about.
That extra love would have helped right about now, because Steve was on a mission with Nat and Peter was away on a band trip for the next few days.
Tony was shocked. No matter how angry he could feel, he was always surprised at Steve's tenderness. However, the toxicity of the alcohol returned and clouded Tony’s brain. “I’m pretty sure your girlfriend wouldn’t enjoy you pitying me.”
Steve replied in agreement, then pointed to some pancake mix. "Wanna go crazy and get chocolate chip pancakes?"
The grin on her face quickly relaxed as the sedative entered her system. The way her eyes fluttered to a close almost made Steve nervous, since he'd seen this happen before she seized. It was different this time; she was going to live her life. And he was the one that solved it.
“Ah yes, I’m feeling very sexy in our matching ugly Christmas sweaters.” She pressed a button on her sleeve that illuminated the silly reindeer across her torso. “The lights were definitely a great choice.”
"Oh. You're Dr. Stark."
Steve studied the brunet's face. He almost wished Tony were lying, that he didn't want to be friends, that he didn't miss being in his life, that they could move forward and forget about each other. Honestly, that would be easier than this, standing in a room where they could only be friends instead of anything else. Steve absolutely hated that he couldn't read minds, but everyone else seemed to know what he was thinking or wondering.
“It’s a good thing I had someone bring me some dinner,” Steve continued nonchalantly. He glanced at the neurosurgeon, slightly disappointed to see that he was unreadable. Tony only gave some sort of grunt in response. He decided to egg him on. “How are you and Pepper these days?”
Steve wondered how anybody got any work done with Tony's lashes and a smile sweet enough to rot your teeth. How could any intern or resident listen to him? How in the hell was he supposed to focus with Tony on the case with him?
had something to do with it.)
Steve barely remembered the car ride—a majority of the ride was spent making sure that he didn't vomit all over his very attractive stranger. It would be a shame if the night ended before they made it to the apartment.
Steve sighed upon hearing the familiar voice. When he didn't turn around, Tony put on a gown and stood on the other side of the incubator.
"Rogers has a boyfriend." Bucky nudged the blond with his elbow.
Steve felt his muscles relax. "Oh, it's no problem. Good thing we hosted the party right here at the hospital. No excuses for injury."
The child's stats were originally low, but upon hearing Steve's voice and gripping his finger, they rose gradually. Sharon smiled and nudged her friend.
Steve relaxed. "Oh. I thought it was because I mentioned a guy—"
The interns were surprised to see Steve was right at home in the NICU. It wasn't easy, working in this unit—the babies were fighting to survive, and not every baby made it out of there. That didn't seem to phase Steve.
Tony grumbled as he sat on one of the bar stools; he didn't really mean it, though. He absolutely loved the fuss that Steve was making—he loved being babied.
The young boy in the hospital bed sat up straighter in response to seeing his favorite doctor. The boy glanced at his mom before standing up to greet Dr. Danvers with a hug. The cardiothoracic surgeon had looked so serious just moments ago, but all of that melted away when she took the boy into her arms. He squeezed her tight enough to rouse laughter from Dr. Danvers.
She knew. Of course she did; moms always knew what was going on.
Steve had endured breakups before. But there was nothing like losing Tony.
“It’s not something, it’s more just—“
The cat's ears perked up at the word, and Tony laughed. "I mean the actual cheeseburger. A burger that happens to have cheese on it. Don't give me that look, I swear...alright, fine. If you make a mess in the car, our deal about telling Steve you were a good cat is going out the window. I mean it."
The intern laughed. Usually, comments like that would have embarrassed him, but since everyone seemed to be plastered, there was comfort in knowing they wouldn't remember tomorrow. He chuckled and offered her some water. "Thanks, Megan. Have some water."
“Eva is a teacher at one of the city schools,” Steve said proudly. “She teaches biology.”
The smile returned to Tony’s face once he finished the conversation with Steve. “Anyway, let me know how you and Eva like the recipe. Supposed to be one hell of a dish. I’ll see you all later.”
"Did you have any pets growing up?"
? She said she's bringing it to the hospital for the night nurses." Mrs. Bautista went to the counter, bringing out a tray of extra food she had made for Sarah. "Do you want some too?"
"You're right." Tony looked at the intern apologetically. "I was selfish. You made everything so much easier, and I knew bringing it up would change something, even if I did come clean right away. I just wanted something happy for a while."
“Is it your life mission to make everyone around you miserable?” Steve shouted. “No one else can be happy, everyone has to be a mopey piece of shit like you, huh?”
They nodded wordlessly and ran to the pit, where they were met by doctors and nurses alike scrambling to take in the bodies. Dr. Rhodes noticed the interns and ushered them into a trauma room.
and Steve can barely think before he realizes Tony has already pulled away. Tony is clutching him so tight, he’s getting a little dizzy now.
His mother, Sarah, returned the grin. "Alright, let me give my patient's chart to Dr. Stark—"
"I do like you." Steve paused. "I like you a lot, and that's why I was so scared of Wilson finding out."
Steve shrugged. “I guess I still have a bit of a soft spot.” That he knew to be true.
"Stevie!" Natasha ran up to him and hiccuped. "You made it!"
"I think I figured out why she was seizing," Steve explained as Natasha looked over the chart, "she fell."
"I am so sorry," Steve said quickly, "I swear I didn't even see you—"
Tony furrowed his brows. "We own the tower—" He immediately shut his mouth once he saw his husband and Peter giggling together.
fucking chance? Tony, I have given you too many chances. I finally thought we could be friends—hell, it worked for a while! I ignored the fact that you treat every other person in this hospital like complete utter shit, just to give you a chance at being happy.”
Katie sat up eagerly in the bed, giggling along with Natasha. Steve ran toward the door and shut it quickly, hissing at them to be quiet.
"Is she okay?" Alex sounded a bit nervous now. "So many people keep checking on her, doing labs, but no one really tells me if she's okay."
She nudged him. "Hey. Earth to Steve."
He just missed Tony more than anything.
Steve chuckled and pressed his lips to Tony's forehead. "That was easier than I thought. Alright, let's get you to bed."
Those same interns invited him to the bar that night after the party, and while he wanted to, he didn't want to be distracted. They insisted it would only be a few drinks, but Steve waved them off, smiling and reassuring them he'd see them the next day, only he'd be the one without a headache.
Sharon shook her head. "There are kids involved. It's all shitty."
“You can’t be annoyed at us for asking,” Sharon added, “Tony hasn’t been nice to anyone but you these days.”
"—I'm
Sharon checked her pager and her cellphone and frowned. No texts or pages from Steve. He had gone down to the lobby to greet the harvest team, but they should have been back once baby Andy was prepped for surgery. Alex wrung her hands nervously.
Sharon and Bucky split from Steve and Natasha in the library, trying to conquer the massive amount of information to get their answer. They needed to move quick to get Katie back home.
"Okay." Rhodey faced Tony and set his coffee down. "You can't be pissed at me—"
"There are other doctors taking the best care of her," Sharon replied, "and Steve is right. We're going to help you and your sister, but we need you to sit down, okay?"
He thought about their conversation right before they got into bed.
She pouted in response, folding her arms together. Steve smirked and patted her shoulder. "I'm only joking, kid. We'll get you fixed up so you can cheer your heart out."
"It's okay."
"And I'm sorry for how I treated you through all this. After the breakup, putting you through my bullshit, confiding in you and pressuring you to be my friend because I was being bratty. I'm sorry. I don't want us to be like this, you know. I want what we had before."
Tony’s throat closes up a little, but he forces one last smile.
The stranger pressed his lips on Steve's cheek lightly, chuckling when he noticed the blonde only grew redder. The tender moment quickly ended once they were in the building and kissing in the elevator.
"Steve," Sharon urged, "we need to do the chest tube, otherwise—"
"I'm hungry, Cheesy," Tony explained. "Steve is the one that loves to cook, and well...I want a cheeseburger."
. Of course he's the one sent for a CT scan. The only damn intern who wasn't paying attention and daydreaming about a one night stand.
The neurosurgeon took a quick sip before slipping into a trauma gown. “I’m fine. Thanks for the coffee, Rhodes.”
She was nowhere near the same height as Steve, but there was no doubt in his mind that she could kick his ass in without hesitation. Her arms were folded and her glare could have melted all the snow that fell gently outside.
Tony slipped his arms back into his lab coat and sighed. Steve was in a frenzy now, red as a tomato from embarrassment, talking a million words a minute.
The intern could barely suppress his smile. "Uh, yeah. Okay. You can come over. You know where I am?"
this is a continuation of (not really a) goodbye. not all of the chapters will be connected but if they are i'll put it in the summaries!
“You absolutely should have. Don’t you know me? I love being swept off my feet, you know that. You never surprise me anymore, Rogers.”
"Hey there, Dr. Blondie." She sipped her drink for a bit more courage.
Tony was incredulous. "You're a supersoldier. You wouldn't even get sick!"
"This what we studied for four years for," Natasha added, "you know what to do. It'll be okay."
He wanted to want her, he wanted to love her the way she wanted. He wanted more than anything, to not disappoint someone for once.
. One of the best neurosurgeons in the country. I'd be dying to learn more from him. What's the deal with him?"
"This baby needs to come out." The civilian who was holding the woman's chest had bloody hands. "Some shards of glass cut into her side. I'm a doctor, I was at the scene. Nasty pile up on the freeway."
Steve nodded absentmindedly. "Yeah, she knows how to get what she wants. No one wants to say no to Sarah Rogers."
"I don't usually do one-night stands. Or flings." Tony's voice startled Steve out of his day-dreaming.
Sarah would only laugh as her son gorged himself on more popcorn and turned on another episode. No matter what, even if it was easy to guess for others, Steve loved the element of surprise and the thrill of not knowing what was going to happen next.
"Pupil's blown," Sharon called out. "We need to call Dr. Stark."
Bucky froze. It felt like there was nothing in his brain, nothing related to medicine, nothing related to the English language, nothing that could ever let him recover from this. Fury stepped forward, pointing to the blood in the abdomen.
"Honey, who are you talking to?"
"That's really nice. Your mother really is a superstar." Tony was a bit quiet for moment; it struck him just how different their lives were. It was endearing, to hear about the little bits and pieces of his life. Learning about Steve's life only made him ache about the life he left back in New York.
"I'm sorry if I made you nervous," Tony said gently, "I'll admit, I'm a little nervous now, too."
He expected Pepper to be angry, just like she had been in the hundreds of voicemails and text messages she had left when he came to Chicago. He expected wrath, but he was shocked to see her still smiling through tears. He almost wished she were angry; it would be easier to deal with rather than watching her like this, sad and beautiful.
"And it's a good morning, Nat," Steve replied as he sipped his coffee, "come on, we're finally getting the hang of everything! It's been almost three months here, aren't you guys excited by everything we're doing?"
Steve froze. The bartender left the two alone, and soon, the mystery stranger was now sitting right next to him.
"How did I let you talk me into buying all this?" Tony chuckled to himself. "Steve is going to kill me."
What joy, spending time with your ex-boyfriend's wife.
Tony scoffed and stuck out his tongue. "I found him first."
Steve pressed his lips to Tony's forehead. "I don't mind. I like being squished by you."
"Nobody said you couldn't talk to him—"
"Leave," Pepper said calmly, "and you can send one of the other interns for my service."
Steve lunged at him his time, grabbing him by the shirt and throwing him against the wall. The drunk intern braced himself this time, underestimating Steve's strength. The cut on Jake's face stopped him; he didn't want to get suspended at work because of some idiot. Steve let go of the man's shirt. Sharon was close behind, tugging at Steve to move away.
As if Steve's life couldn't get any more complicated, Eva rushed back into the grocery store, searching around for a familiar face. Once her eyes locked on Steve's, she took a deep breath and smiled.
"I can't take you out to dinner since residents love to abuse the interns for two days straight, so I thought I'd bring dinner to you." Tony had no idea where to put his hands, and
"I was there when Dr. Model asked you out," Megan slurred. "But I was wondering if that was over."
The morning of his first day as a doctor, a real, full-fledged, shiny-white-lab-coat-wearing doctor, Steve woke with a headache that paled in comparison to any of his previous hangovers. He groaned as he turned over in his bed and away from the brightness of the sunrise that came through the window. He opened his eyes for a moment and fell to the ground in surprise to see a stranger sleeping right beside him.
"Don't have to say thank you for that," Steve reassured, "I love you, and I'll always take care of you."
Sharon shot daggers at her friend; Steve’s lips were pressed together in thin line. He silently cursed the fact that Tony ever said anything, and the fact that nothing could get past his best friend. He also hoped that Sharon would spare him the lecture, but she already grabbed him and pulled him into a nearby staircase.
Sharon and Natasha didn't seem to have any good news either.
“Can I ask why?” Sharon leaned on him. “He didn’t seem so sorry when he got back with Pepper the first time. So, why do you care?”
"I got it." Steve held out his hand. "It was really nice to see you, Eva. I hope you're well."
But then they were on their way, and Steve gushed about the dog for the several blocks it took to get them back to the tower. Once they were back in the apartment, Tony sighed as he splayed on the couch. Steve smirked as he joined his husband.
After leaving the cafeteria in a blind rage, Tony returned to the ER, irritated at the sight left by the staff. Whatever patients that came in that evening were checked in or sent home, but the ER looked a mess. Beds were undone, carts needed to be stocked, and unfinished charts sat at the nurses station. Before he could stop himself, Tony realized he was paging the interns to the ER. It was beyond petty, sending the interns to tend to the ER just because he was jealous and pissy, but he didn’t care. This was an intern job, and the pretty dark haired mystery girl would just have to wait for her — whatever he was to her — to finish his job.
"I love you," Tony said softly. "Thank you for taking care of me."
"Well, no, but—"
Steve took a deep breath. "Grocery shopping it is."
"Katie Stevens?"
But Steve didn't want to be boring, he didn't want to waste his life only focusing on school and medicine. It couldn't hurt to meet the other interns, get a drink, see everyone outside the hospital.
For a split second, Tony almost swore that there was a hint of sorrow in Steve's expression. Maybe it was nothing, maybe he was just imagining things—it was nearly four a.m. The blurred lines between the middle of the night and the early dawn always made everything seem hazy. He found himself staring too hard at the intern because before he knew it, the same familiar rouge crawled up his neck.
Steve knew better than to question her; though he didn't know her, she seemed to know more about the woman's case than he did. The rest of the interns followed suit as they were all lead into the trauma room.
Steve picked up his tray. "I have to round on Laura and then catch up on Wilson's labs."
“And I really,
"Thank you," Tony said quietly. He couldn't stop looking at the man, trying not to smile now as Steve began to devour his creation. Steve blushed slightly as a result, wiping away some of the mess he'd made and pausing.
“Any chance you’ll slip in some morphine, doc?” Tony hoped for at least a smile, something to prove that maybe he hadn’t imagined what Steve had said. That it wasn’t a drunken dream, that it was true— Steve had missed him, too.
Others around him followed his lead, only not everyone toasted to the blond's namesake. Some of the other party goers cheered on about something else, clearly too intoxicated and deafened by the music. Bucky downed his bottle fairly quickly and sighed in content. Natasha and Sharon continued drinking some fruity drink out of their red cups, giggling and hiccuping around Bucky, who seemed to be going on about his med school days. Steve slipped away from them and went to the kitchen to get them glasses of water.
"Who has their car here?"
"No kissing if you're sick."
She took another step, close enough for Tony to smell her perfume. Her hands were on his chest now; she looked up at him, and God, Tony swore his heart was beating out of his chest. Pepper was on her toes now.
There was another voice in Tony's head wondering what would happen if they didn't.
. He was such a dick. He couldn't leave her now.
"Comin' right up."
“Don’t want breakfast.” Steve’s finally out of the blankets, but still sprawled out in bed. “Want you here instead.”
“I have a feeling I’ll be back here,” Eva said as she filled her plate, “every time I think I’m done getting food there’s something else I want—ugh, samosas!”
"Am I really being shitty? For wanting another kid to live?"
Tony rolled his eyes as Steve used his free arm to hold his waist. "Yeah, whatever, Rogers. You need to get that cat a brother or sister or something. He's insufferable when you and Peter are gone."
As if on cue, Dr. Stark finally arrived to the pediatric unit. "I got caught up in the ER. I'm here now. She seized again?"
"Charge again," Wilson said firmly.
Tony was single—no more secret wives.
Rhodey scoffed. "You're grinning because something is happening that I don't know about. And you won't tell me."
" Steve sighed in exasperation. "I can't keep fighting you on this, saying the same thing over and over—Tony, this has got to stop!"
"Don't wake me unless your patient is dying."
" Katie groaned. "What does that have to do with anything?"
Tony's heart fluttered for a moment, trying his hardest not to lean over the table and kiss him. He wanted to get to know Steve, wanted to feel the rush of initial attraction and the possibility of falling for someone. He also just really, really,
"This patient is pretty special to me," she began, "any changes you seen in this patient,
Tony laughed. "You flatter me, Rogers."
"Rogers, Barnes, Carter, and Romanoff, you're with Dr. Wilson." The doctor clicked her pen. "Everyone better be dressed. Meet your residents, and try to keep up, people."
“Drink some water and go home, Tony. You’re drunk,” Steve said through gritted teeth. He willed himself to be patient, trying not to clench his fists.
He didn't lie to Steve. What he told him about the call, it was
"Why would you tell her that? Why would you give her false hope?" Pepper spat. "Her baby was born fourteen weeks early! You don't assure them anything!"
The brunet smiled affectionately. "I'm guessing you don't really do this sort of thing."
But now, the memory isn’t so warm and fuzzy; part of him wishes they didn’t make a big deal of it. Wishes they didn’t make such a big deal about the fact that he’d be miles away from his best friend, his heart and soul, his
Sharon sighed. "Are you okay? Listen, I know the thing I said about going steady was scary but—"
The mother threw her arms around Steve and gave a shaky laugh. "Alright, I'll see you two later."
"Are you okay?"
Steve shook his head while pulling his jeans back on. "It's
"Please, Steve." Tony's voice faltered. "I...I need to talk you. Please."
"It's not funny to her anymore," Sharon said. She shared the same scowl that Natasha had on her face before she left the station. Before they knew it, the boys were left alone, with Bucky's jaw nearly hitting the floor.
"Do you actually live here, or do we need to go to my place?"
and i had to share!
It was one hell of a Christmas for sure.
The accusation along with the looks on his friends’ faces brought Steve to tears with laughter. The interns glanced at each other tentatively, suddenly confused. Steve could barely catch his breath.
Tony blinked in surprise. “I can add that to the list now. Tony Stark MD, neurosurgeon, divorcé, mopey piece of shit.”
Steve laughed and wrapped his arm around her. He stayed quiet, though, unsure of how to answer her.  He cleared his throat before saying anything else. “Say, let’s get back to the pit.”
This was
Steve sighed. "Sharon—"
"I'm not the patient," She urged, "get me a gown and some gloves."
"I wanted to talk to you before the storm but everything got so crazy." She wrung her hands, twisting the ring on her finger. "I wanted to have another date."
"So am I, I guess." The brunet smiled. "Just a guy in a bar."
"I'm saying that maybe you should talk to him. Don't shut him out so quickly." She smiled. "But I'm also willing to make his life a living hell any time he steps into this hospital if you need it. Either way, Stevie, I'm here for you."
okay, Tony. Shit, I really thought I locked the door..."
The soldier and the redhead shook hands as Nick Fury entered the cafeteria. A hush followed his entrance; everyone knew it was time to shut up when the chief of surgery entered a room.
"How do you have a life outside of working?" Alex asked. "It looks like they never let you go home."
Tony smiled. "You'll have to let me take you out for real this weekend."
Ever since Steve was young, he loved seeing the babies in the nursery. On nights that Sarah couldn't get a babysitter and back when there wasn't a daycare in the hospital, Steve got to spend the night on the labor and delivery floor. Whenever his mother wasn't looking or had a patient, he'd sneak off to the nursery.
Pepper cursed under her breath. "She's going into heart failure. She needs a new heart."
The chef turned around and kissed his husband on the nose. "Talking about you, Tony."
Baby Andy was recuperating well in her incubator, and Dr. Potts-Stark welcomed the intern with a smile. Steve was thrown off—very rarely was the neonatal surgeon happy to see him.
"Taking initiative!" Tony clapped a hand on Steve's shoulder, sending electricity through the blonde's body.
"You look like you just saw a ghost."
"It would be," Steve replied, "because then I would be lying to you."
Sharon smiled. "You are so into him."
"You paged me, Dr. Rogers?" Tony's smile was heavenly, but Steve tried to ignore it and stay focused.
Sharon sighed. "We can talk about it, Steve. You shouldn't bottle it all up—"
"Just talk to her," Steve insisted, "I'm not Nat. I'm not her best friend. She's not gonna tell me stuff about you."
"You only get taller, Steve!" Mrs. Bautista squealed and pinched the blond's cheeks as if he were her own son. Steve blushed a little, suddenly realizing that Tony watching everything.
Steve glanced over at Bucky for support, but the soldier shrugged. "Don't look at me. I didn't piss off the nicest intern in the program. This is on you, Rogers."
"What did you say? Why did you even say anything? The problem was between you and me, not you and Steve!" Tony sighed. "I can't do this, Pep. I can't."
Dr. Danvers was stoic again. "I'm really hopeful for him right now. He's at the top of the transplant list. Call UNOS every hour for updates, please."
The blonde quickly followed the rest of the interns and Wilson to the cardio unit, and the interns immediately hushed as they greeted Dr. Danvers. The cardiothoracic surgeon was usually friendly, but it was clear that she was not in a social mood. She stopped them before letting them enter the patient's room.
“No, because I’m not going.”
Steve hid his smile behind his locker, adjusting his lab coat and stethoscope. "I just got a good night's sleep."
, but leaving a little bit of the truth out always worked in the favor of the patients.
"I'm sorry I was an ass last night to you and Eva," Tony continued, "I was bitter about her before and again, I'm sorry. I'm glad you're happy. Seriously."
"This is me teaching you to shock a girl's heart since you didn't let me teach the first time," Wilson said quickly, "You better move unless you want to kill this girl."
Tony laughed in surprise when Steve pulled him back into bed. He only planned to let Steve kiss him just a bit more, but one more kiss turned into several, and hands wandered where they should not have been wandering. Soon enough, Tony's pants were inevitably back on the bedroom floor. When Steve gripped his hand around him, Tony groaned.
"The gallery isn't the best place to hide," Wilson said in a hushed tone. "And all the attendings know about the tunnels. Hopefully you can find a better place to avoid your...Dr. Stark."
They were kissing for a moment at the front door of the apartment complex, and the stranger pulled away briefly and cleared his throat.
"Goodbye, Tony. I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry." Steve retreated to the door. "I'll find somewhere else to sleep."
"It's good to see you again," Tony said gently. His voice was like melted chocolate, and the way he looked into Steve's eyes made him weak. "Didn't think I'd see you so soon, but I always like surprises."
need you to get into bed with me,” Steve murmurs quietly.
Steve smiles. “Don’t be sorry, Tony. You-you’re a genius, you know? You need to be out there, changing the world with other geniuses. I just…I miss you. Nothing to be sorry for.”
“I’m sorry.” Tony’s sitting up in bed now, brows furrowed together in concern. “If it weren’t for mid terms, I swear I’d be on the next plane out to you—”
The babies always made him feel better. They were so tiny, so happy to be laying in their cots and swaddled in blankets. He liked to see what their names were, when their birthday was. It was so odd, whenever he saw that their birthday was just a few hours ago. They were just so...new.
Steve recounted all the details to his friends, from every high point and low point. He thought that talking about her would make it easier, but it only seemed to hurt more now that he had just seen her in the store. Steve was suddenly struck with the realization of how much he had missed her, and how hard it had been to get over her.
Tony didn't move. "I love you."
Steve wandered over to his kitchen, looking through the contents of the kitchen and pantry as if he would find something other than popcorn and some leftovers from the other night. He didn't really feel like cooking, so he was going to have to settle for popcorn for dinner. He made a note to buy more butter for his next batch of popcorn.
about anything other than you and that is killing me. This—whatever this is—it has to stop."
"Shut up!" Steve exclaimed. "You have got to talk quieter. I didn't know he was a doctor when I met him! I was drunk off my ass, and he was really,
Steve shook his head. “I don’t even know why I tried being nice to you. At first I felt bad for you—“
"Hi." Steve cleared his throat. "You look good. Well. You look well."
"Stop that."
“See you later.”
going as planned these days.
"Sharon."
"Dr. Wilson—"
a mistake. I was happy, Pepper. I'm sorry if I hurt you, but I know that being with Steve was not a mistake."
"Geez, Rogers. Ease up on the bad cop routine."
not the guy who brought home hot strangers the night before the biggest day of his life.
The last few days without Steve seemed to fly by. It was as if Tony had a second shadow; Cheeseburger followed him around to the lab constantly, curiously inspecting anything that Tony was working on. The engineer even kept a food bowl in the lab since he and the kitten were spending long hours together. Growing kittens needed to eat, after all.
“Steve.”
Sharon was short compared to Steve, but that didn't mean he wasn't intimidated at the moment. The blonde intern was probably one of the sweetest people in their class; staff, patients, and families absolutely adored her. There were rare instances where she was caught without a welcoming smile on her face— to be on the receiving end of one of her glares was definitely something Steve did not enjoy.
Bucky didn't respond, only muttered the steps of the surgery to himself once more. Natasha threw a crumpled piece of paper at him.
"I'll have the interns call UNOS, okay?" Pepper offered her hand. "It's going to be tough waiting, but I'll have all the interns on it, okay?"
The soldier sighs, kissing Tony’s forehead one last time. “Goodnight, Tony.”
Tony arrived in the doctor's lounge with two cups of coffee in hand. Rhodey was napping on one of the couches with a note taped to his forehead:
Tony rubbed his eyes as the light flickered on. "Oh, hi."
Suddenly, she finally removed the ring from her finger. The jewel seemed duller now that she wasn't wearing it. Tony knew what he wanted, knew that it wasn't right to string her along the way he had, but seeing the ring off her finger left him breathless.
It’s always wonderful to finally see him, even if it’s on a tiny screen in the middle of the night. Video calls are harder to schedule with Tony’s courseload and Steve being so busy with work and school combined. Texting and calling were always okay, but Tony absolutely
"Dr. Rogers, I'll meet you at the nurses station when this exam is finished." He nodded again with a smile before turning back to Katie. The young cheerleader winked at the intern, motioning for him to come back later.
"Eva." Steve intertwined his fingers with hers. "Honey, come on, I'm sorry."
Tony smirked. "Okay, that's fair. You have a free pass to ask about anything you want. As long as we're trapped here, you can get to know more about me."
"Guess you can't leave til the storm blows over, huh?" Alex stared out the window. "I can't remember having a storm this bad in the city."
Steve nodded, barely able to contain his awe and excitement. "I can't believe—you were in her
"No, you're not," Sharon reassured him, "We'll go to the library. Steve has to read up on the craniotomy anyway. You're going to be okay."
"Good to see you again, Dr. Stark."
Cheeseburger returned to the kitchen, rubbing himself on Steve's legs and purring quietly. Steve chuckled to himself, then pressed a kiss to his pouting husband's cheek.
The following morning, a storm shook the city of Chicago. While the staff at the hospital had endured windy days before, the torrential downpour seemed to be shaking the entire building. The interns usually walked to the hospital from Steve's apartment, but the weather was so bad that they had to take a car just for a couple blocks. They still managed to be soaked from the short trip from the lot to the building.
Tony scoffed. “I’m sure Eva would follow you anywhere. She’s here, she’s there, she’s everywhere.”
Steve nodded quickly, grateful that the grueling and awkward conversation was finally over. "Thank you. It was nice to meet you, um..."
"My God, honey bear, no need to be rude," Tony gasped, "I brought you coffee. And you're gonna drink it because you love me. And because you need to help me."
Steve froze. "Um, what?"
The team of surgeons were finally placing the heart inside of the tiny infant's chest. The sight of a heart so small usually would have left Steve in awe, but that morning's events left him numb. He pulled out a notepad and pretended to focus on the surgery before him, scrawling mindlessly until someone tapped him on the shoulder.
The interns were surprised upon entering the ER. Natasha checked her pager again, as if there was some mistake. Surely, their 911 page to the unit had to be a mistake—there wasn’t a single patient in need of attention. Sharon made note of all the charts they had to finish of the patients that came in earlier that weekend. Slightly confused, the interns took charge and cleaned up the ER and continued intern duties.
Steve gritted his teeth. "This is a big hospital, that's all."
"She's barely the size of a newborn," Bucky said glumly, "do you really think there will be hearts available today?"
Tony smirked. Cheeseburger seemed content for the first time since Steve and Peter left for their trips.
Tony scoffs. “Steve, I—you’re everything to me. I could never,
"You heard the man."
And because it was so perfect and fun, Steve was terrified of ruining anything. It had been a few years since he'd dated anyone, and Tony just felt so right. Sure, they had only been together for a few months, but something about it made Steve feel good (no, not just the sex). Tony understood him, didn't suffocate him when he was busy, comforted him after hard cases or patients that he lost. Everything was so easy and simple with Tony, it almost seemed too good to be true. He wasn't about to rush into anything only to have Tony change his mind.
"I can get the TV to get that cheerleading channel if you want," Steve suggested, "that way you aren't bored."
, Dr. Blondie?" Natasha teased. "You and Purple Stethoscope would be cute together."
The young woman glanced at the mess on the aisle. "We should probably help the poor kid who's gonna be cleaning this up pretty soon."
Tony smirked before Steve ran out onto the neuro unit, running in the opposite direction than he was supposed to be going in. When he saw the blonde sprinting back the other way down to the ER, he couldn't help but laugh. Today was going to be interesting.
“Steve…”
Watching Eva meet everyone on staff made Steve’s heart swell; he had always imagined this, in his life before. Back when they were still in school, dreaming of the life they would have when they grew up, as Eva liked to say. Steve had imagined moments where he would introduce her to the people who would not just be his coworkers but close confidants, friends.
“Some party, huh?”
"It was always about that damn hospital," Tony muttered. "I can't do this."
"It's, uh...I'm Dr. Rogers. Sir. I have to chart. Because she crashed." He fiddled with the pen in his pocket, even though Tony had the chart and he had no other patients to chart on yet. "I'll be back."
When Steve tried to pry the bottle out of his hands, the intern shoved him a little. "Back the hell up, Rogers. Don't fuckin' touch me."
"What happened? What did you do?"
Tony raised his finger tips a little, waving them slightly. Steve waved back, motioning for him to come into the nursery. Tony never moved so quickly in his life.
Alex sniffled, but she didn't leave Steve's grasp. "I don't mean to cling so much, but—you and the other interns...you're all I've got right now. I'm alone in taking care of Andy right now."
Suddenly aware of his gaze, Eva pulled the intern aside and sat down. She leaned in and kissed his cheek.
Steve nodded. "I should have brought one for Pepper, too."
So, despite his nerves, he felt better walking the streets of his hometown and going to work. There was finally that feeling of being an adult, like someone who actually was going to pay bills, maybe settle down after the first few years of residency. After all those years of being a student, he was going to be a person with a real job.
Steve was practically sleep-walking as he made it back to his apartment. He knew this part of the city like the back of his hand, so it wasn't difficult finding his place, even after two days of working. The intern barely made it through the door before immediately slumping onto his couch. He should probably shower, change his clothes, brush his teeth, eating something other than cold french fries...
"I'd only like to see
Bucky snickered once Wilson was finally out of earshot. "Holy shit, she scared the hell out of me. It was kinda hot."
The trauma surgeon nodded curtly before returning to the pit and assisting staff on any incoming patients. Steve's mind was a million places at once, wondering at all why Tony would want to see him.
Really?”
Bucky wrapped an arm around Steve. "Quit lying about the couch. We know he sleeps in your bed."
Steve finally looked up from his paper work, burning bright red. "Natasha!"
"My craniotomy was canceled, I don't have to be in again until this evening for another surgery," Tony replied, "I happen to be all yours this morning."
Tony smiled. "I was hoping an hour gave you enough time to panic and clean the house."
"I'm responsible! Mr. Stark, I'll take good care of him, I promise!" He followed Tony around the room, who happened to be pacing over the fact that there would be a fucking cat living in the apartment. Their clean, pristine, and well-kept apartment.
The next time Tony opened his eyes, the room was almost painfully bright. His arm was sore, as if a very inexperienced intern had stuck his arm multiple times while trying to place his IV. A headache pounded at his temples, and he was very grateful when he realized he was laying in a hospital bed. He was also particularly grateful for the blond intern that sat at his bedside.
Once Eva finally stepped out of the store to take her call, the intern couldn't shake the girl out of her mind.
Tony sighs. “You’re right. Giant football stars like you would never be able to fit in this pathetic excuse for a bed.”
"Yeah, sleep and hydration work wonders after drinking your weight in scotch," Tony teased.
The more Tony kissed him, it felt like a scalpel was digging harder into Steve's chest. Because he was still married, he still lied, and he still didn't leave her. And even with the misery that Tony was giving him, he wanted him more than anything.
Nobody dared to raise their hand. That question seemed more rhetorical than anything else. Dr. Wilson did not seem to be in the mood for actual questions or concerns. Instead, the interns wordlessly followed him for a quick tour of the hospital.
“Hey, look at me.” Tony brushes the golden strands out of Steve’s eyes. “This isn’t a goodbye, not really. I’m gonna come back to you, I promise. I’ll just…see you later. Okay?”
Steve smirks and props himself up to meet Tony’s eyes. The engineer meets his gaze fondly, eyes wide and so endearing that Steve inevitably leans forward, kissing him gently. Tony sighs softly, melting back into the pillows as Steve’s lips are on his.
Steve was trembling now. "I don't know! Her vitals were steady the whole night, I even told the mom she'd be okay because everything was looking good—"
Tony Stark was suave and attractive. It was no secret; everywhere he went, he could charm people in an instant. He never really liked to gloat about it, but he knew that about himself. He was always the pretty boy. (Alright, maybe he gloated to Rhodey once or twice. Or lots of times, especially when he was a drunk college kid trying to get over an ex. He was a pretty boy, thank you very much.) Pretty boys usually aren't the ones doing the pining. Usually
Tony finally stood up and locked the door before easing Steve back into the bed with him. Instead of kissing him, he wrapped his arms around the intern. He hushed him gently.
The world stopped. It was like his heart fell out of his chest.
The neurosurgeon returned to his best friend’s side, enjoying the fuzzy warmth from the scotch. He delightedly accepted another drink from one of the other trauma residents, nodding and smiling politely though he had no idea what the conversation was even about. He quickly finished his drink, enjoying the slight burn in his throat.
"You're an idiot!" Steve called out. The soldier hushed him and ran off to find the other blonde intern.
"Pepper—"
"Bad day?"
Alright, so Tony hadn't really been giving Cheeseburger extra love. He'd give the kitten some extra kibble as a peace offering, but that was quickly forgotten whenever Steve showered him with belly rubs and cat treats. While the kitten loved when Peter came over, it was clear that Cheeseburger and Steve were inseparable.
"I'm not going to be your emotional punching bag," Sharon replied, "I'm here for you, but not to catch the blow just 'cause you're having problems with your ridiculously hot boyfriend."
"Where's the fun in that, sweetheart?" Steve winked before removing Tony's scrub top and kissing his chest.
The intern raised a brow. "This is a present."
"This isn't a fling, right?" Tony panted.
Seeing Steve fuss about whether to give Tony acetaminophen or ibuprofen and which would be better in reducing the fever made his heart swell. Another reason for his complete and utter adoration for his husband.
pleased with this at all.
Which was exactly how Sharon knew Steve was bullshitting her.
The interns exchanged pleasantries with the rest of the group—the usual information about where they graduated from, what they were excited about during internship, and what they were thinking of specializing in one day. Tony didn’t pay much attention to the interns as all he could focus on was the pretty girl latched onto Steve’s arm.
Steve stared longer than he should have, and Pepper caught on. Her smile faded, but she didn't seem angry like he expected. She looked broken.
"Do what?"
Tony sits on the bench, patting the space next to him. “I can write you something, if you want. You know, for inspiration in your art classes.”
“He’s just...having a hard time,” Steve explained, “When he told me about the divorce papers a few weeks ago—“
booze," Steve replied, glaring at Bucky. "We should send everyone home."
Dr. Wilson barked something at him, and though Steve knew it wasn't personal, that it was because this girl needed help, it only added to his anxiety. He pulled out whatever was needed from the cart, paged more nurses for medications, and soon, the seizing ceased. Dr. Wilson finally took a breath.
Steve’s surprised to hear Tony’s voice, but he chuckles when he sees Tony smiling, too.
"You can't do that!" Tony called out as Steve left the room. "You don't even have the clearance!"
"Hey. Dr. Blondie."
"You don't need to comfort me. I know I did a good job." Sharon tore off her trauma gown and left the room before Steve could get a word in.
The blond was ready to knock the idiot's teeth in, but instead, he held his hands up in surrender. "Let me get you a water bottle or something. Smells like you've had a few too many beers."
“It’s late.”
mistake? Sounds like several mistakes if you ask me!"
Tony laughs when he meets the same blue eyes again. “I’m flattered.”
Steve tightens his group around Tony’s waist. “You love me, okay? You made vows, you stood in front of the city of New York saying that you loved me, you can’t take that back now-”
"I'm sorry, really."
"Have another drink, Rogers!" Bucky exclaimed. "You're so fuckin' uptight these days. Forget about Stark, forget about the internship for one night!"
Steve threw an arm around Bucky's shoulder. "You'll be fine, Army Tags. We'll study right now. Let's go."
Rhodey shouted something at him, but the combination of music and alcohol made it difficult to focus. He accepted the cup of water his friend had given him, but what he could really focus on was Steve and his friends. He noticed the blond step outside for some air. Tony took another glass of water and hoped it would help him stand straight long enough to follow the intern outside.
"Dr. Potts-Stark doesn't strike me as someone who likes to wait. Am I wrong?"
There was no time to talk. No time to get an explanation for what was going on. The handshake was brief as the attendings went up to the OR to scrub and prepare for surgery. The rest of the interns were sent back to the pit for non-emergent patients. There was such a shock upon meeting Dr. Potts-Stark that the interns had no idea how to comfort Steve.
“You really don’t quit, do you?”
Back in the locker room, Steve sat next to his friend. The soldier was laying down on the bench, still donning the scrub cap.
tired—"
The interns decided that Steve needed roommates. Mostly because Steve couldn't stop staring at the neurosurgeon, and they needed him to focus.
, Steve."
too much of a distraction for me while I’m trying to study.”
Finally, the staff were dismissed, and the interns were back on scut duty. As boring as their tasks could be sometimes, there was no denying that it was peaceful to be stuck on charting or running labs back and forth.
As weeks passed, the look on Tony's face made everything worse. He knew that Tony was losing sleep, and it only added to the sad, apologetic expression he wore as he looked on from the nurses' stations. Steve wanted to forgive him. So badly.
Tony grew silent again, thinking about ways to run damage control. He could just block the calls entirely. Call his old company in New York, apologize for leaving on such short notice, maybe explain everything—
Cheeseburger almost whined in response, retreating to his bed in defeat. Tony almost felt bad for the little guy. He ventured into the kitchen, reaching into one of the jars of fancy cat treats and offering it to the sad kitten. Cheeseburger quickly accepted the treat and hopped up to the one of the stools at the counter top.
Sarah peeked around the nurses' station before pinching her son's arm. "My god, that Dr. Stark...I loved your father, but..."
"I can whip you up some breakfast for your troubles," The man continued, hoping to break the ice. "A little thank you, for uh...a nice night."
"Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt," she said breathlessly, "but, uh, Steve...can I give you this?"
"Get up and get your coffee." Steve checked his pager. "They said it's 911. There must be a trauma."
And now they’re finally in bed, Steve pulling the covers over them and pulling Tony in by the waist again. It feels so right, Tony just melts against him and his warmth, and soon, he’s sound asleep against the blonde’s chest.
They had barely eaten breakfast together; the first omelet burned once Steve had gotten busy on his knees. The couple then again tried to enjoy the pancakes that they whipped up, but Steve had been winking throughout the entire meal, and Tony practically drooled at the thought of what else the intern's mouth could do.
"Where have you been?"
Things were looking up. Sort of.
Steve Rogers hadn't chewed on his nails in years. He used to do it all the time, chewing and picking on his fingertips. He was nervous kid. He had gotten over that; it was a gross habit. But now, he couldn't stop himself from biting them, picking on the cuticle and the skin around the nails. He was willing to do anything to keep himself busy instead of running out the hospital doors and never looking back.
Once Tony was out of earshot, Bucky dragged Steve into the locker room, joining the other interns. The soldier forced Steve onto one of the benches and crossed his arms along with the other interns.
Steve stifled a laugh, though it was difficult with the look on his friend’s face. She looked as if she had just broken ground on a new medical marvel.
lives. Things were so much easier in medical school. Now there were human lives on the line. People with families, people who meant something to someone else. His mom got him all worked up in six words.
"Surely you could have checked up on your mother at least once while you were doing scut, right Rogers?" Tony took a breath and tried staying calm as the intern glared at him. "If I was lucky enough to be working with my mother, I'd visit her every hour."
"Cheeseburger," Tony replied quickly. "Uh, Cheesy is his nickname."
There was a note attached to his locker. It was only one sentence, written in handwriting that was far too familiar. He'd seen it stuck in his lab coat pockets, stuck into the lunches he packed for work. It was the same handwriting that could make his heart swell just weeks ago.
"Wait, where are you going, Dr. Blondie? Aren't you on my case, too?"
Dozens of texts and pages flooded his phone, now that he was in range of cellphone towers. He froze when he saw all the messages Sharon had sent him. The latest text said that Andy was already in the OR.
Steve wasn't usually a messy guy; his apartment was usually pretty clean, so was his car. But his locker had grown to be an atrocious sight over the past several weeks: empty coffee cups, candy wrappers, unfinished bags of chips that were thrown in the locker. Steve hated how messy he had become—locker was a fucking nightmare.
Steve scoffed. "I am not.
The intern sighed and pulled the blanket right up under his chin. Maybe this was it—being boring until his residency was over.
"This is quite the reunion," Pepper said abruptly. "My husband and his best friend."
The familiar strangers were silent as a teenager came in with a mop and cleaned the mess. Steve insisted on paying the small amount to replace the broken eggs, but the clerk insisted it was nothing. The intern felt nauseous once the clerk left them alone.
"You said you were falling in love. If you were falling in love, I deserved to know the truth. People you love deserve that." Steve squeezed Tony's hands one last time before heading for the door. "I deserved at least that."
He sat down in the chair next to Katie, trying to catch his breath and stop himself from vomiting whatever alcohol and coffee that was in his stomach. The nurses told him something about Dr. Stark arriving soon, and her vitals were stable for now.
"That's okay, maybe next time, Mrs. Bautista," Steve replied, "You're gonna be mad when you hear it, but I have no food in my fridge."
The neurosurgeon panicked now. He didn't want to lie, but he wasn't ready to tell Steve the truth. Rhodey barely knew the whole truth; he wasn't sure if he was ready to accept it either.
Steve nodded wordlessly, feeling nauseous as he held the crash cart paddles in his hand. Eventually, words came out of his mouth, telling someone to charge the paddles, but it didn't sound like him. Somehow, his hands moved over the girl's chest, watching her chest rise with the shock. Everything seemed to be happening in slow motion, like he was just a puppet watching everything happen around him. Finally, a steady heart rate brought Steve back to Earth.
The momentum from sprinting and turning a corner quickly made him trip, but he didn't care. He was finally in the room, he reached behind the monitors to press the code button—
Steve forced a smile in return. "Let's go get some dinner."
Sharon sighed and leaned on him. "Okay, I'm sorry. We're just trying to look out for you."
"You guys are going to be fine," Sharon reminded them, almost as if she had read both their minds.
Bucky shocked her heart, once, twice, three times, until her heart was beating. She was breathing, but something wasn't right. Steve checked her pupils. Unreactive.
He really hated how hungover he was. She seemed so warm and genuinely concerned, but he couldn't remember anyone's name and the headache wasn't helping. He pushed another fake smile. "I did, thanks."
“I’m sure I’ll be seeing you around more often,” Tony said, voice dripping with sarcasm, “since we’re just bringing non-hospital staff to all our functions and gatherings. Maybe she can scrub in for you next week, Rhodey!”
Alex was unsure. "I slept plenty after my surgery, Dr. Rogers, I was wondering if I could just stay here..."
Natasha groaned, leaning back on the couch. "I need some of that in my life."
The blond rubbed his neck. "Nat..."
For such a big hospital, it proved to be quite difficult to find a place to be alone. The nursery, his first safe haven in the hospital, was now occupied by a certain strawberry blonde that he couldn't muster the strength to face that day. The tunnels, while the normal space for the interns, was far too dark and depressing—the last thing he needed was to be sheltered from the sunlight.
The intern raced up to the gallery of OR 3, where baby Andy was being operated on. The child looked even tinier from saw a view in the gallery. The transplant team was just getting ready to place the heart inside the baby's chest. He couldn't stop staring at Pepper, who was focused on opening the baby's chest cavity. It was odd, knowing something so intimate about her.
"Okay." Tony leaned back on the couch. "Anyway, uh. The intern doesn't know about New York. But he's probably going to find out real soon. And I'm in deep shit."
, Dr. Rogers."
Peter gently placed the kitten into Steve's arms and grasped Tony in a hug. "I'll be here every day to make sure he's alright, I can even get a job somewhere to pay for some of his food and kitty litter! Thank you so much, Mr. Stark!"
"Dr. Danvers, I think I'll scrub out early and alert the family," Steve said.
," Katie explained with a huff, "I can't help our team win if I'm not there. I'm the flyer."
The intern left the room before either of them could say another word.
Steve sighed. "It's complicated. Just talk to him, will you?"
But Pepper still wore her ring. The beautiful diamond glittered on her finger, a shining reminder that Tony hadn't left her yet.
"Sharon drove," Natasha called out from the master bedroom. She was the first one up, and she had Sharon's arm looped with her own, dragging her since she wasn't fully up yet.
The surgery went smoothly. Soon after Pepper delivered the premature fetus, it was Tony's turn to operate on the patient. He was glad he didn't have Pepper in the room anymore; there were quite a few stares upon the realization that she was indeed his wife.
"You're lucky the position was still open," Fury said as he handed Tony the paperwork, "and that you happen to be the best of the best."
The blonde couldn't think, couldn't breathe. He was shaking slightly, but he couldn't bring his feet to move. Eva seemed to ignore this and smiled anyway.
"That depends on what you're doing tonight," the man replied coolly.
"Pepper, I..."
Steve peeks out of the sheets for a moment, squinting as sunlight peeks from the curtains. “Come back to bed.”
"We can always go out." Steve's hands were fidgeting so bad, as if he'd never had a boy in his apartment before. Tony pretended not to notice, although the intern's nervousness was so obvious.
"Would it be so bad?" Tony inched closer, impossibly close to him now. Steve could feel the cool air every time Tony exhaled.
“If you loved me,” Steve says between kisses, “you would have come to bed hours ago…”
The neurosurgeon sighed. "I will always, always care about you, Pep. Whatever you remember from all the hell I put you through, please remember that."
"We are going to need more details than that!" Sharon insisted. "That was not just an ex. Details or I'm not baking the cookies like I promised."
Steve pauses briefly, smirking to himself. “Yes?”
"I'm being serious!" Steve sighed. "I feel like I don't know anything about him, how can I be calling him my boyfriend?"
college is taking up so much of my time but i wanted to write a lil flashback chapter because i missed my babes
After Jackson and Jo's surgeries, the interns were charting in the tunnels. Bucky and Natasha were unnerved by the silence; usually it was never this quiet, even when they were drowning in scut work. Natasha nudged Bucky, urging him to break the silence.
Pepper groaned in frustration as she sat back down on the couch. Tony paced the room, restless and exhausted all at once. It was the same argument, no matter how many times they revisited it.
"What?"
"Babies love you."
Steve was on auto-pilot. Truthfully, he was glad that they weren't sent to the ORs and instead were left to help where the attendings couldn't. All critical patients were already taken up to surgery or already admitted by other residents and attendings; all the interns had to do was stitch up patients or run to the blood bank in case people needed transfusions. Steve didn't mind the busy work at all; he desperately wanted something, anything else to focus on.
