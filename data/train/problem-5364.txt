"If you think about it, the Captain's strategic mind, mixed in with the fact he is our leader might be why they have him. If they can dispose of him then that would create chaos within the Avengers. They want to harm one of us, to get to all of us."
"He just told us it was a reconnaissance mission," Steve said, "said there were signs of Hydra activity here and to go explore. He didn't tell us it was classified or anything."
"I know you're worried about him, trust me we all are. But now isn't the time for 'what ifs, or thinking about what's happening to Steve. We're going to get him back, and no matter what, you need to be there for him, and you will continue to love him." He nodded his head, his eyes opening only when he heard the door swing open. He slowly pushed himself up into a sitting position, looking towards the door where Fury and Thor now stood.
These thoughts confused Steve because, where he was raised, if anybody ever found out you were having homosexual thoughts, let alone actions with the same sex, it could get you killed. But here in the new world, according to Tony, it was normal to feel these things, let alone express them with whoever you loved. Where the confusion scratched the surface of what he was feeling, acceptance and a little curiosity seeped forth through the cracks. He wanted to feel this uncontrollable surge of happiness flooding through his veins, showing through his smile and his eyes whenever Tony was around. He craved it like a drug, except it wasn't exactly a drug. He wouldn't classify it as a drug either. To Steve, it wasn't a drug, because that implied it was something you were consumed by and couldn't stop wanting or needing. No, this was the feeling of attraction, a small crush forming when you meet the right person. Yes, he could feel the way he did when he met Peggy. The way he wanted to hold the genius and not let him go, how he felt his heartbeat quicken at the moment, how he adored those brown eyes of his and the pink of his lips, it made him feel so many things he didn't know how to express, but truthfully he did know how to express it, he just hoped it wouldn't backfire.
"Ya see," Tony said, leaning forward, a smug look on his face, "that's what I thought at first too, but that's not exactly accurate, is it? You tried to kill me, but instead, here I am looking at your disgusting ass face. Then you try to get my boyfriend to kill himself; which I'm sure you thought if he did it'd be easier to get to me since I'd be so busy with my self-destructive tendencies, and yet you failed."
He swallowed the lump in his throat and let out a shaky breath. He got through delivering the news, but it was so damaging to see the distressed look on Steve's face. "I'm sorry." The genius whispered, hanging his head low.
It's a nice thought, and that's why Tony was going to head on over to the raft today to initiate their plan. Was he worried? Absolutely not, he's Tony Stark he can absolutely pull this off. Sure he might be reckless and is more of a "go with the flow" type of guy, but with the right incentive, he's willing to stick with the plan. His incentive for this? His family, and a specific super soldier he's absolutely in love with.
mean no. You are not going on another mission without me. I forbid it." Tony argued. It has been a month so far and things have been going relatively smoothly for the time being. Tony and Steve have been spending every second of the day getting to know more about each other, going out on dinner dates, spending some quality alone time in their bedroom, and even going outside for some walks in the park, and whatever other activities they choose to do in the busy streets of Manhattan. And now, Steve was down here in his lab, telling him that Fury is sending him and the super spy twins out on another mission,
"For goodness sake, watch your language!" He teased. The soldier rolled his eyes and blushed a little more.
As he inches closer towards the staircase to the left that will lead him downwards to the platform where his helicopter was last permitted to park, he fires the two shock missiles, watching as they silently whizz through the air. The missiles explode on impact, a small puff cloud that crackles with electricity forms in front of their face and they convulse for a minute, collapsing onto the floor in the next second.
Then again it was a tough three weeks for them; what with Nat releasing all the information about Ross and his conspiracy with Hydra, as well as the footage of what they did to Steve when he was transported to the Raft, needless to say, society wasn't happy with the way the government let someone like that into the secretary role, as well as how Captain America had been treated.
"I understand this little plan on yours. Are you sure it'll work?" She had her doubts, of course. With what happened to Steve back at the bunker, what exactly would be real for him to believe, and would he accept that what he is seeing is the truth.
"It's just..." And he's not sure if she should tell him, but regardless if she doesn't she'll find out anyway. She's always been good with that sort of information; whether it's classified, or you're willing to confide your troubles and secrets with Nat, she always somehow finds out. She's good with keeping secrets as well- hell, she kept her own identity a secret from him when she went undercover as his second assistant. This is why he figures, it'll be fine to tell her, so he continues. "I got so angry at the fact that when he sees you and Barnes, that it's easy for him to speak. I'm sure you and him both know about his predicament, and it's just... I got so jealous of how he's spoken more to you guys than he has to me. When we got here it was difficult for him, and then when I saw Barnes I just thought that maybe he'd leave again."
Tony knew that the only way to make the situation better was to put an end to this whole nightmare. He knew that the team was going to have to figure out where these things' final target was, and they would have to put a stop to it. Tony swears that he'll do whatever it takes to not only ensure that this whole fiasco is over, but he'll also ensure that after this is all over, he'll make sure that Steve is finally happy, no matter what.
"We're gonna find him, I promise." He nodded his head slowly and rested his head against the stretcher, letting Natasha lull him into a gentle nap, a calm before the storm.
In those three weeks as well, the two males have been getting a bit more touchy-feely, and it excited Tony. He felt as if Steve was getting more comfortable and warming up to the idea of having sex with him, but he wouldn't get his hopes up. They weren't officially dating yet, and Steve seemed like the kind of guy who would wait till marriage to do that kinda stuff. Well, maybe not considering the guy almost showed Tony his dick pretty early, but maybe that was more for the experience than anything. Also, the thought of marriage sent a shiver down Tony's spine, cause not only was that a major commitment but no sex till marriage? It sounded like torture to Tony, but if that's what it took, maybe he'd be willing to wait that long.
He captured the other male's lips in his again, the genius wrapping his arms and legs around the soldier, moaning into his mouth as the blonde gripped onto his ass instead of the underside of his knees to hold him in the air. Steve slipped his tongue inside of Tony's mouth as he moaned, deepening the kiss as their tongues battled for dominance. His legs carried him towards the elevator, his back hitting the cold metal with a thud as the elevator carried them towards Tony's room.
"Aye, I can assure you these creatures will feel the full might of my powers for all they've done," Tony smirked, liking the way the Asgardian spoke.
. It was like the word willed me to believe that Tony brought someone who could get me out of here. I felt another wave of tears fall down my cheeks as I looked at her, her eyes never once moving from me.
It's the mere thought of that simple statement in his own mind that leads him to start closing himself off from the shorter male, not really bothering to respond to most of what he's asking. It hurts Tony, and God does it hurt him too, but he's not comfortable with speaking right now. His voice, while still being the same octave it's always been, it's drastically foreign to him as if the stuttering has changed the way he sounds entirely; and in a way, it actually has, not by changing his tone of voice, but how he's able to form a sentence. He can't form a singular sentence containing, or beginning with consonants, because that's when the stuttering happens. Every sentence he could form, no longer an option for him. He could only answer yes or no questions with just a simple nod of his head.
what Ross was doing to Steve. He saw every time he shocked him, every time he put Steve up for display and had his guards beat the shit out of him, how weak he looked and how much blood he was losing. He saw it all from the little microbot he left at the Raft, giving him access to their security footage so he could take a look for himself at what Steve was going through.
As soon as the words left Ross's mouth, Steve pushed the steering wheel of the jet forward, propelling it forwards and out the harbor entrance. He soared through the sky, past the vast oak trees, hovering above them. While the plan may have been full proof, and Tony had provided a good enough distraction, the soldier not only had no idea where to go but he was caught in a web of worry.
"Ah, this feels so much better. Don't you think, Tony?" It had his features down to perfection; his blonde mop of hair that sat perfectly on top of his head, shaved off at the sides while the top was swept over in a wavelike fashion, the usual tight skinned shirt Steve usually wears that shows off his muscles, and his ever so fashionable brown khaki jeans. It left Tony speechless at how... Accurate these things were able to impersonate them, it's no wonder that Steve was having a hard time telling real from fake. "Oh wait, hang on, forgot the signature suit." It even
"That's what I want to get to the bottom of," Tony said, walking away from Clint's side and towards the door behind Fury, "can you give me access to your security room? I wanna check the footage and find the missing pieces to this puzzle."
"Hmm?" He shook his head, eyes focusing back onto the other male in front of him. When exactly did he get this close to Steve? He swore he was just starting to walk over to him. God, he's been zoning out a lot, what's going on inside his fast-paced brain?
"I see the therapy is working now." And he couldn't help but smile at the reassurance in T'Challa's voice, because honestly, the therapy was working, but if it wasn't for Tony being his motivation then he most likely would have given up a while ago.
"He must've made the assignment himself, but disguised it as reconnaissance." He bit the tip of his thumb as he watched the way the man moved with a purpose as if he was hiding something. His eyes moved on to the screen in the bottom right, clicking on the top left screen, enhancing the image.
"J, think you can give me a rundown of what happened?" A blue light shone from the area near the suit's eye, encasing the room in its vibrant hue. A holographic scenario appeared in front of him. His eyes trembled as he saw how those things impersonated him and shot Steve twice, one in his right shoulder and the other in his left leg. He watched as the back of the gun made contact with his head, knocking him unconscious. He watched as that thing picked him up and carried him, his own footsteps matching the motions as he followed the hologram.
"I do." He whispered, in a hushed tone. Tony nodded his head and grabbed his wrist, speeding off towards the left-back of the debriefing room, where the spiral staircase that led towards the underground harbor of Quinjets was stationed.
Warning, there is smut in this chapter, if you do not like it do not read. The smut begins just shortly after Steve puts away the dishes, and says the words "I do". You have been warned. Happy reading!
"I understand t-that. I want you to k-know that I absolutely understand that, T-Tony. And I'm s-sorry for doing what I d-did in Siberia. I just didn't want y-you to have to deal with m-more pain and suffering. But, by n-not telling you I was hurting you, a-and I'm sorry."
"Makes sense, you got some powerful abilities from that stone they used on you." She smiled at his attempt at humor, lightening up the atmosphere between them. "All we can do is work day by day to make sure he gets back to himself. While I cannot get anywhere near him, maybe the rest of you can and it might work. You willing to try to make his life better, without powers?" She nodded her head, making him smile. He put his arm around her, starting to walk once more.
wanted to talk to him, but more so the fact that he let the genius see how distraught he was, how hurt and betrayed he was. He always tried to keep himself together, because too often vulnerability either got you hurt, or killed. In this case, Steve feels both.
"Absolutely. I mean, w-what if I say s-something wrong, o-or this is a b-bad idea?" He catches the traditional brown leather jacket he's come accustomed to liking ever since they defeated Loki all those years ago. He loved it, it pretty much complimented all his outfits, and it was pretty cozy as well.
"Oh, you're awake." He says a little startled, adding a chuckle towards the end. "Sorry about not being here when you woke up, I wanted to make you breakfast and be here but I got caught up talking to T'Challa." He places the plate of food and the cup of juice gently on the dresser, moving the sketchbook out of the way just so it didn't get dirtied somehow. He didn't say anything, for he simply just stared at the genius, which in return made him smile nervously and scratch the back of his head. "In case you're wondering, T'Challa and I were talking about the accords and trying to fix them so we can all go home back to the compound. I actually have to go speak to him again but, well, I wanted to come see you and make you breakfast in bed."
"No, actually you're right on time," Tony replies, his own beaming, warm smile plastered on his face. He nods his head and sits down carefully, extending his legs all the way out and sitting as close to the genius as he can. He turns towards Tony and notices the genius wearing a black, grey, and white checkered collared shirt, covered with a sleek black jacket, black dress pants, and red, black, and white sneakers. It was simple, with just a touch of fancy, and that was perfectly ok with Steve.
here, of all people; especially considering he was the main reason why he got caged in the first place, left to suffer at the hands of Ross and his guards.
"Right, as if you two cuddling on the couch wasn't already an indication that something is going on between you two. Besides," Clint pointed his finger at Steve, "Cap here hasn't shut up about you ever since we were on our mission. He always kept asking if we were done so he could talk to you."
A simple outing with Tony and both occupants learn more about each other. However, it is to be expected that some acquisitions of knowledge are off-limits, and Steve learns this the hard way.
"No, Steve," Tony cut him off, getting off his stool and walking close to him, "I don't want you going on this mission without me. I mean, what if something happens, huh? I can provide intel, backup, I can have JARVIS give you the in's and out's of the place, I can even-"
"You don't have to say anything, I know." And of course, she knows, because she's a spy. Hell, she's Fury's top spy, always knowing everything there is on a person, but he's grateful that she knows because she's always been one of his best friends. "Actually, we both know. Figured if I knew, you'd want Barnes over here to know, too." And he's ok with his first best friend knowing because they've been through so much together. He feels... Strangely happy with both of them know, and it gives him just a small ounce of confidence within himself to speak to them.
to do anything except sit here. I don't care if it's for an hour, thirty minutes, or even thirty seconds, but you can't stay locked up in this room expecting him to wake up any second."
"Ms. Maximoff is on her way, sir. In the meantime, is there anything I can do for you?" Once again he pondered, staring into space. What exactly could JARVIS do? Well, for one, the AI could tell him what Steve was up to by now, but that would just make him want to go back to drinking that taunting bottle of whiskey that is still sitting within his reach. He could ask his AI to tell him a joke, which for a lack of a better term, would turn to shit since he's pretty sure he didn't program humor into JARVIS, only sass; which he wasn't even sure he programmed into him, he just assumed he picked it up from Tony. There was one thing, however, that JARVIS could do.
"Y-yeah it's working r-really w-well. Uhm..." He bit his lip and remembered what Tony said about him and T'Challa discussing plans to change the accords. "W-Where is T-Tony?"
He was so caught up in his own slight emotional turmoil that he didn't hear the footsteps coming closer to him, that he didn't realize Tony had stopped in front of him and knelt, coming into eye level with Steve. In his hand, however, was that stupid fucking rectangular dial he was so used to seeing in Ross' hand whenever he wanted to shock him, and he already knew what was coming.
He pulls him flush against his body, pelvises, and thighs rubbing against each other, chests pressed together. He squeezes the brunette's ass, eliciting a moan that caused the shorter male to rut against him, drawing out a moan from him as well. He pushes Tony against the wall, lifting him by the cup of his ass, detaching his lips only for a moment before he places them on Tony's neck. He kisses the skin on his neck hungrily, making the genius arch his neck just a little to give him more access. His teeth rack across the skin, digging down just hard enough not to draw blood, but to draw out another pleasurable moan that makes the hairs on the back of his neck stand and the erection in his pants jump in response.
stuttered in his life; and sure he may trip up his words sometimes, but that's not stuttering, that's more along the lines of finding the right words to say while putting pauses in between. Stuttering is more geared towards an irregularity in speech patterns, making it hard to form coherent and clear sentences. And it frightens him, because how can he communicate if he can't speak properly. "H-help me-e."
"Tony... What?" I looked at him, confusion written across my face. All he did was stand there and smile at me, it was unnerving, to say the least. "Why did you shoot me? Where am I?"
"Where are you off to?" Her cool, soft-spoken, with just a tad bit of hardness in her voice questioned. He smiled and looked over his shoulder at one of his best friends that he's gotten close to over the years, and to this day he'll still never figure out how she knows so much. It's the small curve of her lips in a half-smile, and the way her greyish green eyes look into his and send the message of "I know", does he remember that she knows everything because she is a top spy.
As the brunette walked through the door, he wouldn't be lying if he said he was a bit overwhelmed. The room itself was dark, even with the multiple tube-shaped blue lights surrounding the perimeter, attached to the bottom, sides, and top of the walls, it was still significantly hard to see, but just lit barely enough for him to see the creature shackled to the table. He slowly inched his way forward, the sound of the door closing, followed by footsteps close behind him as he sat down.
Eventually, he brought them towards the Quinjet that was sitting there patiently, humming loudly and ready to take off once the two were on board. Even when he got into the jet, and the hangar door closed slowly behind him, he still didn't let go of Tony even when he sat down. He didn't want to let this man go, they've been through too much together. He wanted to keep him close, to let him know that he isn't going anywhere, that they are going to get through their shortcomings together.
"Then I assure you, sir, that Captain Rogers feels the same way. If anybody can make him happy, it is you."
"I don't think you're a mess. Sure a lot is going on, and we all have our issues; even I do, and I'm supposed to be this perfect person every time. It gets to be too much." He sighed heavily before continuing. "You're the only person who probably sees me as much more than just Captain America, and for that I thank you. We had our ups and downs, but you know me for me."
He stopped eating and moved his eyes away from the plate to see the retreated of the genius, and he knew he should have just let him go, considering he most likely didn't want anything to do with him right now, but he couldn't help the autopilot words that fired out of his mouth like a bullet.
He's never done drugs, so he wouldn't know what that's like, but he has gotten heartbroken, not once, but twice.
"This is all so beautiful. I've seen it a bunch of times, truth be told, but why did you wanna show me-". And he stopped for a second, because where he expected the soldier to be standing tall, looking down at him, he was instead on his knees, looking up at him instead with a smile so full of love, and a black box in his hand.
"You're not gonna eat?" And he didn't expect Tony to actually stop halfway through his walk, but he did expect him to noticeably stiffen and nervously turn around.
"So, Wanda," Tony said, crossing his arms and smirking at her, "what else can you do with your powers?" Her eyes wandered his laboratory, looking at every item within her sight. The corner of her mouth curved upwards in a half-smile, her hand stretching out slightly, scarlet filigree fluttering across her fingertips. He heard the groan of metal and he turned around in his stool, his eyes widening as he watched his Iron Man suit was suspended in the air by scarlet energy. "Holy shit," he said more out of awe than shock. He watched as the suit moved in all sorts of directions, coming dangerously close to crashing into other objects in his lab. As she gracefully put back his suit where it belonged, he turned around to look at her, a huge smile splayed on his face. "That is fucking sick. What else you got."
"Steve, please believe me he's lying!" Tony yelled. He looked into Tony's scared brown eyes, finding everything he's ever worked for right in them. He saw the love, the fear, the compassion, he saw everything Tony wanted to say at this moment, but he didn't say anything. "Babe, please I love you. I wouldn't betray you a second time. Please, believe me." Tony kept his tear-filled, trembling blue eyes on Steve's face, looking for any sign that he believed him. "Please, I love you."
"You need to get out of there. This isn't a reconnaissance mission, it's a trap! You're in danger, and so are Clint and Nat!"
"Oh, fuck Steve." Tony moaned, biting his lips as he let the soldier run his hands along his body in one of the most intimate ways. It sent a jolt of pleasure down his spine and towards his crotch as he let the blonde have his way with him.
He's tried so hard to find peace in the situation, tried so hard to allow the man he loves, who just so happens to love him back, comfort him in a way that nobody else knows how. It's not just a simple hug, or a simple kiss, or simple words of affection you can just get from anybody- no, these are gestures and words from a loved one. It's when Tony kisses his eyelids, or just below them when he's crying does he remember that it's ok to feel this way, that he doesn't have to hold all his emotions in. It's the way Tony understands what he's going through and doesn't complain, nor look at him like he's damaged. It's the way he only sees the love in his eyes, the care, the compassion, and understanding does it make his heartache because of how much he's pushing him away.
"Cap? Cap, are you there?" The sound of metal groaning resonated around him. A shadow loomed over him, and as he looked up, his heart metaphorically sank into the pit of his stomach. The Quinjets left wing was broken off, fire and smoke emanating from the vehicle, its flight compromised. He watched in horror as the jet crashed into the side of a building, breaking not only glass and part of the building but part of the jet itself. He watched as the Quinjets right wing broke off, falling onto the street below. He watched the jet descend dangerously closer to the ground, bits flying off, getting lost somewhere in the building or the city, fire dancing, crackling, smoke wavering in the air as it finally touched the ground.
"No, Tony, it's not. What happened to Steve is not your fault. They were manipulated into thinking they were going on a harmless mission when instead it was a trap." Bruce sighed and stepped away from Steve for a bit, pinching the bridge of his nose, his fingers grabbing a clipboard that held information on the soldier. "The serum is working slowly to try and mitigate the damage to his body, although we can see the physical wounds they've done, who's to say it goes further than that."
"I'll be ok Tony, I have Natasha and Clint to back me up. Besides, are you implying that I'm weak?" It was an attempt at humor to lighten the situation, and it worked. Tony smiled and chuckled lightly again.
"Actually can I... Can I sleep with you instead? It gets lonely and... I don't wanna be alone." He noticed a hand in front of his face, and as he looked up, a warm smile plastered on the face of the genius.
"Poor Steve," Natasha says before taking a sip of her freshly made coffee. Tony hums in response, not really wanting to say much more about the subject. In fact, what could he say? Sure he could talk about how things have been rough for the super-soldier, or how traumatized he really is. The more he thought about it, the more his appetite seemed to disappear as he let out a heavy sigh and dropped his fork on his plate.
"I want to." He watched as the soldier placed the belt off to the side, any words Tony wanted to say were caught in his throat as he watched the top piece of Steve's Captain America suit slowly start to lift, revealing the skin underneath. His breath hitched when he saw Steve's skin, and he so desperately wanted to run his hand over the blonde, feeling every inch of him, wanting to know just how smooth Steve felt under his touch. He bit his lip as he watched his thumbs slip into the waistband of his suit and the boxers he wore underneath, the fabric slowly sliding down his hips, revealing more of his skin to the genius. Tony was doing really well to not touch himself right then and there, the tightness in his crotch area absolutely unbearable, but he didn't want to move or he would miss the sight of his soldier unveiling himself right before his eyes.
This is the type of love he's always wanted; the mundane type of love where the mere thought or sight of your significant other gets the blood rushing, pumping through your heart, and coursing through your veins. It's not a sugary sickness that goes away, nor should it ever be compared to a drug. It's like a diamond; fragile yet so beautiful to the eye with the way it sparkles. It can either be protected or it can break with so much as a few mistakes, but even as the diamond shatters into pieces, its beauty is still there and just waiting to be picked up and cared for once again.
like him. Caring, selfless, all the things that Tony wasn't. If that were true, then the kiss wouldn't have happened, right?
"Do you wanna do this?" Tony asked quietly, his eyes opening slightly to see how close and intimate he was to Steve. He saw Steve look down for a brief second before looking back up into Tony's eyes. He licked his lips and nodded his head slightly.
"I'm glad to know that something good has come from the world since I went under. It doesn't matter who you love, really, as long as you're happy." There was that smile again that just warmed something inside Tony's chest. Was it the Arc Reactor? No, that thing was still cold vibranium, it was more likely his heart, the small, gentle caress of a hand over his heart, the way its palm was placed ever so carefully over the beating organ, radiating nothing but goodness and tranquility over it- God, since when did he become such a sap.
"Hey," Clint spoke softly, rubbing Tony's shoulder comfortingly, "we're gonna find him and we're gonna get him back, okay? Those fuckers will get what's coming to them, and you know Steve is too stubborn to die. He's probably fighting as hard as he can to see you, the
He still doesn't notice the genius getting closer and closer as he falls to his back, a hand clasping around his throat and squeezing with all its might. He tries to pry it off using his super strength, but the hand doesn't budge. He can feel the world spinning around him, his mouth opening and gasping for air. He doesn't notice when the pressure is elevated and he was able to take a long, hard gasp of air, and he never noticed when the spear entered the creature's body. He watched as it was lifted off of him, suspended in the air, and tossed to the side as its body returned to its original form. He noticed Tony, just shortly after he dropped the scepter, standing over him and looking pale and weak, eyes looking so distant and misty. He moved forward as the genius dropped to his knees, catching him in his arms swiftly. He noticed the wound in his abdomen, and he quickly told the others to call for help.
The soldier stood there, his breathing was shallow, his body shook as he refused to look at the genius across from him. He swallowed the lump in his throat, his hands tightening around his shirt. He closed his eyes and let out a shaky breath, words finally being spilled forth into the air. "I'm sorry."
"God, you're big. It's been killing me to see this for a while. I'll make sure to treat you well, Captain." Steve was effectively bigger than the guys he's done this with before, and it was going to be a mouthful, considering that as a super-soldier he was packing some heat in all the right places; not only his dick but also his ass. Seriously, Steve's ass was probably Tony's favorite part about him, besides his amazing personality. Without distracting himself any further, he licked the underside of the soldier's shaft, causing the blonde to throw his head back and let out a moan of pleasure, exciting the brunette even further. He took his time making his way up towards his tip, enjoying the way Steve trembled, his hands gripping the sheets at his sides. He placed the tip against his lips, soft kisses placed against it, causing the soldier to blush a little. It was so adorable the way Steve acted, all tough and dominant, but at heart, he was still just a little bit shy, and Tony adored it. He swirled his tongue around the head before ever so slowly, opening his mouth and placing Steve's cock inside his mouth.
"Look, I told you," he stared, getting off of his stool and making his way over to her, placing a hand gently on her shoulders, "I know what you did, and trust me, I hate that you did it. Nothing is the same anymore, but you went back for him. You could have left him there to die, and possibly that alone would have killed me, but you saved him so he could be here today. There's nothing I am more appreciative of than that."
He thought. He shook his head and looked over towards the glass window. It overlooked each prison cell from where it was stationed, and every cell was unoccupied except for one. He saw the familiar patch of half blurry and half clear brown hair that sat on the top of Tony's head, but he couldn't see his face as the genius was curled in on himself just a little, sitting on his knees and violently shaking. It worried him that something bad had happened, and so he took off down the stairs to his right.
He was filled with hurt and betrayal, both so clear in his eyes that even Tony could see, but the genius looked at him with so much disgust in his eyes and that smug grin on his face. That was the moment his heart broke; it was in that moment that Tony used that phone he gave him for emergencies, saying how much he missed Steve and wanted to talk, only to find himself face to face with the genius and men surrounding him, pointing their guns at him as if he were prey a hunter was trying to seize, that made his heartbreak right then and there.
"You don't need to lie to me, Tony." He then noticed the way Tony's eyes turned cold within an instant, followed by a loud scoff in reply.
He slept through the night happily, his body relaxed, mind at ease, and under the ever-watchful, ever keen eye of Tony Stark.
Steve pulled back from the kiss, starting to move slowly away from Tony. Instead of leaving the genius, he simply held out his hand for the brunette to take instead.
"I love you, Steve." He whispered, wrapping his arms around the soldier's neck and pulling him into a hug.
He stared at his sketchbook, a pencil held just loosely in his hand, but just tight enough that it didn't threaten to fall. Once more he knew this was a bad idea, but drawing gave him safety and security, and he was willing to at least
"S-Steve!?" Tony yelled, shakily. He jogged his way over towards the cell that he remembers seeing the genius inhabit. Once he got there, he could faintly see the genius looking out of the cell, and as he looked, he could definitely see Tony shaking violently from this closeup, along with a few strangled sobs scaping past his throat and out his mouth.
He first noticed how spacious the room was, he then noticed the abundance of drawers behind glass doors, and then finally, his eyes locked onto five computer screens in front of him. His feet lead him to the computers, the blue screens illuminating his features in the dark as he sat down in the seat. His fingers flew to the keyboard, looking at the main screen in front of him, passwords being bypassed until on the smaller screens, the last few hours at S.H.I.E.L.D. were being played. His eyes focused on and roved across each screen, but nothing out of the ordinary was happening.
As the vehicle took off once they got back and were situated, Tony held Steve close to him, listening to the way his heartbeat was so small and faint, that it scared Tony all the way to his Arc Reactor. He kissed the side of the blonde's head, rocking them back and forth as he whispered sweet nothings into Steve's ear. He sat there, paranoid out of his mind, a million thoughts running rampant in his cranium. The only thought he cared for was whether or not Steve was going to make it out of this alive.
He retracted his hand from the blonde's hair, letting himself stretch and release a sigh of content as his joints popped and cracked in a way that soothed him. He lifted Steve's head off his lap, gently placing it onto the couch. He walked as quietly as he could towards the door to his lab, the kitchen his only destination he had in mind right now. He needed some coffee in his system as he rubbed the sleep from his eyes and stifled a yawn. He was emotionally drained from staying up all night and watching over Steve, the soldier wanting the genius to stay close to him. He was debating on sleep at the time but decided against it just to make sure that he was awake in case Steve had a nightmare and needed him. So far he slept peacefully through the night, the genius making blueprints towards his latest Iron Man suit as he watched over his lover.
Now the third heartbreak was more recent, and it was almost unexpected, even to himself actually. He always considered himself a straight male, destined to fall in love with women until he eventually had kids, and grew old; because that's always been the plan for him. Find a nice girl to settle down with, marry her, have kids, watch his kids grow up, go to college, move out, and grow old with his wife. He only achieved one of those, and he actually never thought he would get another chance at love, let alone finding someone to marry.
"But you want to accept that fact he feels something for you, or you want to accept that you feel something for him?" He nodded his head and he swears he's an open book for Bruce to just read, and he hates the fact that when he gets emotional, which is very rare, that it's so easy for someone to just pick out how he's feeling. Years spent perfecting a persona and letting the world see only what he wanted them to see, only for it to crumble around the face of those he's willing to let it, he hates emotions because it makes him feel weak. You can thank his dad for that one, because "Stark men are made of Iron," used to be the shit his father told him whenever the asshole would hand him a hot piece of metal and he would drop and cry about how it burned his hands.
"I'm sure you can get Jarvis to pull up the video feed on that one, but more importantly," he sighed and looked Tony dead straight in the eye, "did you mean what you said about you and me..."
"Tony." He looked at Pepper and clicked his teeth with his tongue. She had that look on her face that he remembered all too well. It was her 'don't bullshit me, Tony,' look.
He just sat there, crying through the night, wishing that everything was just different so he wouldn't have to suffer this much. It's morbid, and he knows it, but he wishes he died back then so he didn't have to experience this right now. How he wishes he died back at the raft so he wouldn't be trapped in this goddamn room, in the place he once called home. And he knows it's a really bad low for him, but how he wishes he could kill himself right now and be done with everything. Anything, was better than the pain and anguish he felt right now, the damaged and almost irreparable heart he kept in his thoracic cavity, he didn't want to feel this way anymore.
"For a genius, you certainly made sure to ask a stupid question." It replied. However, it shook its head and chuckled. "I'm sure one of us already told you if you hadn't figured it out by now, but we wanted to break up the Avengers in our own way, make sure there aren't any threats for other races who want to invade earth."
"For what?" Steve's smile was replaced by a frown, his eyebrows furrowed as his once happy facial expression turned into one of confusion.
lost his life. How the serum had kept him alive while he was frozen for 70 years, but this time he isn't sure the serum can save him. This isn't the ocean; where it was just a big, vast blanket of blue, mixing in with specks of white littered around the surface,  it was the ground. It was hard ground that the Quinjet was barrelling towards, and as sad as it was, he accepted death once more.
"Can we stay like this forever?" And Steve smiled in response, kissing his forehead and looking at Tony with so much love in his eyes.
"Get off me! I-I have to get back there!" She said pushing past the doctors and towards Tony's direction. His hands wrapped around her upper forearm, she struggled against him, his eyes trembled as he's never seen her so rattled and distressed. It actually pained him to see her reduced to this, just what happened back there?
"You winning the staring contest with the coffee maker?" Tony quipped. Ah, yes, Tony Stark, someone who Steve wasn't exactly sure he had the pleasure or the displeasure of meeting. After their initial bad blood on the helicarrier with the whole Loki incident, they cleared the air and came together as teammates, and possible friends? Steve wasn't sure, but he would like to think that they were considered friends.
He remembers the feeling of pure sensory overload, mixed in with the rush of fear as he fell from outer space, the ground getting ever so closer and closer to him. He remembers feeling adrenaline pumping throughout his body when he got the suit to work again just before he hit the ground, allowing him to make it back home safely.
"We did, but there's a little more we have to inform you of since we didn't originally figure this out until afterwards, and... It's worse than we thought." The way she faltered in her explanation made him uneasy. He shifted his weight from foot to foot, chewing on his bottom lip and scratching the back of his head, turning towards the door to look away from her.
"My oh my, I think I've corrupted Captain America. Fury's gonna be pissed when he hears about this." The two shared a chuckle, their arms wrapping around each other, pulling the other in for a hug. "Go kick some Hydra ass for me, my sexy Captain."
"Trying!" He maneuvered through the thicket of trees, all while trying to maintain stabilization in the air. It wasn't easy as the jet threatened to dip downwards a couple of times, and with the chopper behind him shooting at him, it was just getting more difficult by the second.
"Get ready boys, might have our work cut out for us," Natasha said, getting up out of her seat after settling the jet down on the landing pad. Steve stood up, followed by Bucky who had previously sat in the co-pilot seat next to Nat. Natasha brought one of her guns, a Glock 26, out of its pocket on her thigh, handing it to Bucky who simply just stared at it.
"Hey, Steve. I have someone here who's been dying to see you?" Bruce smiled back, motioning with his hand to Tony. He watched as the soldier's eyebrows scrunched in confusion, but he continued to smile as he turned his head. That smile that was once splayed across his face, turned into a frown as he looked at Tony. His eyes conveyed fear, those beautiful blue eyes were trembling in fear as he gazed in Tony's direction, and it made the genius sick to his stomach. He shakily tried to reach out and touch the blonde, but it freaked him out more. He watched as Steve frantically got out of the stretcher, his body falling to the floor, taking some of the machines with it. The IV drips in his arms dislodged themselves as he moved away, the heart monitor giving a noisy flat-lined sound. Bruce was the first to move over to Steve as he continued to stare at Tony with complete terror in his eyes.
"But... But you can't be anywhere near him, and it's all my fault. They made me bring forth so many horrible things, and then they injected him with that syringe and everything got worse."
"I do. If I wasn't around then maybe you wouldn't have gotten to know more about me, and I wouldn't have asked to know more about you. It's ok, really. Nobody cares about Steve Rogers, only Captain America. Some might even say they're two different people, but who am I kidding? Nobody would say that."
"Are you sure you wanna know, Tony?" The genius nodded his head and Bruce slowly listed off what was wrong with him. "He has a small concussion, his skin is raw at his wrist, bite marks on his neck and lacerations to his abdomen. But as I said Tony, we can only see the physical, we don't know the mental damage these things have caused."
"I know you're a human being, Steve. But do you really think I have the power to talk Fury out of letting you come with us? Regardless if you're still adjusting to this world, or if you just got your life back, we do have a job to do." She was right, and that's the sad part. S.H.I.E.L.D. didn't care about whether the super soldier was still trying to adapt to his new life, if he was still capable in combat, or reconnaissance, they would use him for that. It sickened him that he was reduced to nothing more than a simple guinea pig.
"How many times have you had nightmares?" He looked at Steve, who stared back at him. His once-prominent smile that was etched into his face, was replaced by a stoic expression, his lips flattened into a straight line.
someone who is very close to you, and when you saw him you thought this was your chance to save him after the first time you couldn't and I get that. I understand that the Bucky you see, and the Bucky I saw are two different people. He was controlled by Hydra to do something he wouldn't normally do, but I want you to understand that it really hurts knowing that he killed my parents."
It's as he looks at this man in front of him, that he's overwhelmed with an immense wave of happiness. It makes him get out of bed instantly, placing his hands on the genius's face and attaching his lips to Tony's. It was more than just a simple kiss; it was a kiss that held so much emotion from the blonde, so much happiness and so much love radiating into this one kiss. He ran his hands down the sides of Tony's frame, inching down his sides and over the curve of his hips, stopping only once his hands had taken their place on Tony's ass.
"Always. You can always come to me if you ever feel lonely." Steve smiled in return, grabbing Tony's hand and letting the genius lift him off of the floor, following him to his room.
"I'm fine with that." He smiled and it transferred onto Steve's face. He placed Steve's erection inside of his mouth once more, the blonde pushing his head up and down again, only this time a little faster. As he continued to control the pace, Tony noticed that Steve was gradually putting more and more of his length inside of his mouth, until eventually, Tony found all of Steve's length at the back of his throat. He squeezed Steve's hand as he adjusted to his length, gagging just a little bit, but not pulling back.
"Thor said you got shot out of the sky. Are you alright?" He looked at the once blue light of his right gauntlet, which faded into nothing but a grey light.
"There were many times where Jarvis asked if he should alert you. I always told him no because I didn't want to bother him or you, for that matter. You were always in your lab, mix that in with the fact that you gave me a home and didn't ask for anything in return, which if I'm being honest, I always thought was weird because I thought you hated me."
"Shit." He whispered to himself. And then the man behind all of this, Secretary Ross, stepped out of one of the black vans, dressed in an all-blue business suit, a megaphone in his hand.
"Well, if you got inside of his head to hurt him, maybe there's a way to reverse it, right?" It was a long shot, but with her mind manipulating powers, maybe there was a way she could reverse the effects. She sighed and shook her head, her shoulder slumping in defeat.
"I'll be there as soon as possible." He ended the call without waiting to hear any more of what Fury had to say. His mind was only focused on one thing, and that was getting down to S.H.I.E.L.D. and hopefully getting answers, as well as teaching certain alien assholes not to fuck with the people Tony cares about.
"Captain Rogers," he jumped as he heard the voice of Jarvis speak to him, "you have been glaring at the coffee machine for a solid ten minutes."
His hands curled into fists, his body was frozen in place, but he willed himself to turn away and look back at the Triskelion. He took the first step, ready to activate his thrusters on the next step he took, but he was frozen in place when he heard the sweet voice of his lover he thought he lost.
"Well, nice to see you too, Tony." She said, taking a small sip from her glass of freshly made tea, courtesy of Bruce. He rolled his eyes and dragged his feet over to the coffee machine. Hopefully, a nice cup of coffee will help him relax.
"Either of you two know anything about what we're dealing with?" Wanda shook her head and was the first to speak.
Tony with all his heart, and he was willing to endure as much as he could to return to normal. He wanted to see those brown eyes light up whenever he saw him, how sometimes he would lean closer to Steve out of everyone else when they had movie nights, how he would confide his secrets into Steve because the soldier was always there, ready to listen, how the little touches they shared set his skin ablaze, he missed all of it.
, has ever called him by his full first name. He always despised it, it always left a bad taste in his mouth which is why he preferred Tony, but he let it slide this time since now wasn't the time to reprimand Steve for it. Besides, he's free to call him whatever he wants, right?
What he sees he has no words for, his mind starting to blank from too much blood loss, as well as the small static in his ears, and thick clouds that started to amalgamate together in his head, cutting off his thought process slowly. He does register, however, that there's two Steve's, throwing punches back and forth. Steve on the other hand- the real Steve, that Tony can barely make out through his fogged mind and intense depth perception, doesn't notice Tony struggling to get up. He doesn't notice the way he stumbles and loses his balance on his way over to him, doesn't notice the way he drags the scepters sharp edge along the roof, doesn't notice how close Tony is to passing out, because he's too busy with the imposter in front of him.
"Fuck!" He swore loudly, accidentally shocking himself with one of the new widow bites he designed for Natasha.
He leaned in slowly, as did the genius. Their faces were mere inches from each other, slowly getting closer until their lips brushed against each other.
"I should be in that stretcher, Bruce. I should be the one lying there, not him. Not Steve, he didn't deserve this."
this man, but was the past participle of love the correct variation to describe how he felt towards him?
"Fury, I need help. Send a S.H.I.E.L.D. medical crew to my location. I don't know where I am actually, but I'm sure you can figure it out. Steve is dying, so please get them here as fast as you can." He didn't bother waiting for a reply, the important task he needed to tell the spy had been finished, and now he could focus on the soldier.
"You say a lot of pretty things, it's sweet, really. Would you be opposed to letting me suck you off right now?" Steve chuckled in response and blushed profusely. "Sorry to spring that on you right now, but your words have a certain effect on me in all the right places. Mostly my heart, but also my dick too."
"Yes, sir," the AI replied. A hologram appeared in front of him as the footage played out, he watched as Fury was quick to rush them out of his office, giving little detail about the mission. His eyes moved over to the other screens, another video footage of Fury minutes before the mission assignment.
"They didn't tell me what they were, they just knew about me and asked if I wanted revenge. They work in small groups, I don't know if that is any information considering there were only three of them at the time."
"But what if he gets hurt? I'm not there to make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble. He's a super-soldier who doesn't like bullies, and nobody is a bigger bully than Hydra."
"We're S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Stark. We don't get the luxury to sit back and play with our toys, we put our lives on the line to get stuff done." Tony scoffed in reply.
"You know how you were so worried about whether or not you'd see me again, that you didn't know whether I'd be alive, or I'd die on my next mission?"
But then a small click and the cold barrel of a gun is pressed against the back of his skull. He freezes, not daring to move, cursing himself for not leaving the damn suit on.
He opened his mouth to say his thanks, but then closed it shortly after. He clenched his jaw and looked towards the ground, keeping his gaze off of everyone.
Regardless of that, the first time he wasn't the one in the hospital bed and stood just like he is now, behind a glass window looking into the operating room where the patient lay was when Rhodey was hurt. He sat behind the glass window feeling powerless to do anything, feeling guilty that if he had just done something different this could have been avoided. Now, this is the second time he's behind a glass window, but instead of Rhodey, it was Steve.
"T-Tony?" I said through chattering teeth. I looked at his face and noticed a bucket, water dripping onto the floor at the edge. Now I know exactly what woke me up, but I wasn't sure where I was, or why I was here. I wasn't even completely sure why Tony was here.
"It's ok to admit that you miss me even if it hasn't been a day yet. When I'm coming home exactly, Fury hasn't really told me when I'd be back, so I cannot give you the answer to that. I'm sorry."
"That is true," she nodded in agreement, "but sometimes I go back there to remember my brother. But that's when those things were there and they found me. They... They knew all about me and what I went through, they knew about my powers and they told me they knew a way to get revenge on you." The tears were back in her eyes, her voice quivering slightly. He didn't know when they stopped walking, but they were in a secluded area of S.H.I.E.L.D., away from prying eyes and ears. "I'm sorry."
"Well, duh," Tony said, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world, "you kissed me literally a few hours ago and I'm already missing those lips on mine. I'm also missing your ass; it's a really nice ass by the way. What I wouldn't give to see it again and want to run my hands all over-"
talk about the issues that are still somewhat relevant between them. As much as things are going well for both of them at the moment, that doesn't mean he can simply forget about the fact that they both hurt each other. They need to talk about Bucky and what went down in Siberia, as well as apologize for what they did. Well, if Tony didn't want to apologize for it, he didn't have to and he wasn't going to force him to either, because an apology cannot be forced, you have to mean it. An apology is like a screw; it has a specific place that it belongs to, each apology, or rather "screw" is important in keeping things together. Screws cannot be forced into place, much like an apology cannot be forced into place either.
He broke his trust, and his heart, and to make matters worse, not only did he lie and not tell him about his parent's death, but he jammed his shield into his chest where the Arc Reactor lay, or rather, it used to lay before he had the shrapnel removed and he replaced it. It doesn't matter. The damage has been done, and the nightmares plague his subconscious, capturing him in a vicious cycle of torment and terror that makes him wake up every night, screaming, sweating, hyperventilating, even
"Every time I come by this door, I get all giddy knowing I have Captain America looked up like the criminal he is." And wow, what a shocker it was to Steve-not really- that it was Ross who came here to speak to him, the same old sneer in his voice he's heard far too often since he was sentenced here. "I'm going to miss it, I'll say that." This had Steve furrow his eyebrows, causing him to look up. He saw the iron bars retreat sideways into the wall, the glass door opening, allowing Ross to step inside his cell. He felt the familiar aggressive grip in his hair, forcing him onto his wobbly feet. He was weak due to all the blood loss, but did Ross care? Did any of the guards care? No. They made him suffer, they left him in his cell to die slowly, to let his body eat at itself so he remained weak. He could barely stand, and while the center of the raft wasn't far, he still stumbled slightly, making Ross pull him by his hair harder.
We're almost at the end of the story! Two more regular chapters, and then an epilogue to go! Thank you all so much for the comments and kudos, and I truly hope that when you reach the end of this story, you loved it and hope to read more stories that I will be posting on this site!
alive because there's no way that they'd go down without a fight. They'll be back." If only Tony could believe the words he said, because deep down there was a feeling of dread nestled in his stomach. What if they didn't get out alive, what if he never see's Steve again? What if...
angry Tony Stark. He huffed out a breath of annoyance as he traversed the cold metal flooring. He never liked it here, what with all the super-secret spy missions and all their fancy gadgets that he could make ten times better, but most of all he never got along with Fury. It was a very rare occasion that the genius ever saw eye to eye with the guy, and when he did, it was mostly when it concerned his team and what plans they
"You're holding hands and Cap just kissed the back of it. So I wanna know, did you ask Cap out, or did Cap ask you out?"
"Right now, Thor is down at the science lab with Fury trying to decipher what these things are. He'll be back with whatever information he has. In the meantime, we simply wait."
"Have patience, Man of Iron. However, I understand your frustration, so it is okay to be on edge. These creatures are not similar to the Chitauri, if you were wondering, they're a smaller group of creatures whose purpose is to eliminate threats that could damage their plan to pave the way for other entities to take over."
"Well, hello there chef Romanoff. What's on the menu today?" Her head snapped to look at him and he saw her lips curve upwards into a smile.
Without another word he stood up abruptly, making his way out of the living room area towards the elevator. He waited as patiently as he could before the elevator ringed and the doors opened. He stepped inside, pushing the button to his floor, and waited patiently again for the elevator to bring him to his designated floor.
"That's the thing, Doctor Banner," Fury said calmly, his gaze locked onto Tony, "with the information that Stark has gathered, we can at least draw a conclusion as to what these things really are, and figure out a plan of attack. He's got this thing figured out."
"Sir, I'm worried about you," JARVIS spoke once more. He sighed to himself and rested his head against his palm, staring at nothing.
"Do you want to go to therapy?" Another nod, almost instantly. It brought some warmth into his chest at the mere fact that Steve
While twelve hours was a long time to wait, it was worth it in the end. After the doctors told him about his injuries- how he had a mild concussion, a fractured nose, scarring on his face, broken ribs and sternum, and a punctured lung, through all of that, they said the serum was doing its job and he was going to be ok.
Tony didn't really consider himself as someone who really needed love in his life. Don't get him wrong, he absolutely loves the idea of being with someone- and that didn't have to mean sexually, because yes he knows that before he used to be a playboy, bringing different women, and on occasions, men into his bedroom where he could be as intimate as he wanted with no strings attached. Simple, harmless fun that he could partake in without any repercussions. He never understood what it was like to wake up next to a partner you wanted to see in the morning, or what genuine love was until he met Pepper.
Just like before, he sits in his lab once more, staring at the screen in front of him that shows the soldier in his room. His heart lurches as he watches the soldier break down on the screen, guilt coursing through his entire being, staining his blood, curling around the bones in his body in a vice-like grip, not willing to let go. Just why did he say that word? He knows how much Steve hates that nickname because it reminds him of everything he has lost from his previous life, and he just
"Captain Rogers is trying to call you." And just like that, he fumbled around his desk littered with spare parts, searching for his phone, and laying it in front of him, accepting the call.
"Just k-keep guard!" He yelled over his shoulder. He pushed past the double doors and into the control center of the Raft, and just like the room before him, it was empty.
In no time at all the floating steel island came into their view. The lights spotted the Quinjet, and the top of the island slowly opened up to them, a landing pad coming into view.
"Well, we got word of an SOS from a specific location, when we found them... It wasn't pretty. They have some broken ribs, bullet wounds on the shoulder and abdomen area, gashes on their body, broken wrist, and sprained ankle. Some damage to the chest area of the male, and some patches of blood on the head of the female. Whatever did that to them, did a pretty nasty job."
"We'll figure this out together, they're not gonna get away with this." He nodded his head in response, all words he wanted to say locked away, safe for only Steve's ears. Time seemed to move at an agonizing pace, the heart monitor seemed louder in his ears, even the humming from the lights above them seemed to pierce his eardrums. It was all too much for Tony to bear, but he sat through it. He wanted to be here for Steve, he needed to be here for him, he wasn't going to leave this spot until he got to see Steve wake up with his own eyes.
"Coming home and seeing you." Tony didn't know what came over him, but he had this uncontrollable and strong urge to propel himself forward, jump onto Steve, wrap his legs around his waist and his arms around his neck, and place a passionate kiss onto the soft pink lips of the super-soldier. He felt the small vibration of Steve giggling against his lips, as well as the curve of them as he smiled into the kiss. He felt the blonde hold onto the underside of his knees as he returned the kiss, opening his mouth for the genius and allowing him to explore every part of it. God, Tony was in a state of bliss from kissing Steve, and he wouldn't lie to say he absolutely
"It's nice to know you're worried about me," he pulled the genius close to him, kissing his forehead, "but I promise that I will return to you safe and sound."
"It's ok, I don't mind really. I would probably react the same way." She had a hint of an accent, but it wasn't that thick or heavy. He slowly started to lift himself away from the trash bin, her hand supporting his back and her other on his shoulder. "Are you alright now?"
"New York is pretty massive, there's no possible way we could scour all of it, let alone just Manhattan," Bruce said.
He barges into the room, and he's relieved slightly that he doesn't see the soldier's body on the floor, but rather it's in his bed. He's relieved to see the soldier slightly confused, his hair sticking up in multiple directions as he sits up in his bed and looks at Tony with worry. But he doesn't get to say anything as the genius launches into his lap, wrapping his arms around his neck and placing a passionate kiss onto his lips.
Whenever Tony was in his lab, there was never a dull moment. Whether it was working on upgrades for the teams' suits, fixing up the Iron Man suit after it was horribly damaged thanks to some asshole supervillain, or scolding Dum-E for messing with, and touching, which leads to breaking, something he wasn't supposed to. Needless to say, Tony's fast thinking brain, fitted for the most complex of situations, was always preoccupied, but also, always on the move.
"Alright, now how about we get you into your room. Sleeping on the floor, or rather in the hallway, not as comfortable as it sounds."
"Bother with what?" A voice said behind him, causing him to jump a little bit in his seat. He turned around and spotted Natasha, standing there behind him, a crooked smile on her face. He swore it was hard to tell when she was being Black Widow and Natasha Romanoff, it was like the two were the same person, sneaky, stealthy, perfect posture and lack of emotion on their face. Although, with some credit to Natasha, the smile on her face was a small indication that he could tell when she was being Black Widow and herself.
"Hey, nice to see you. Thought you weren't going to pick up." Steve said a bright smile on his face. He was dressed in his Captain America suit, and from what Tony could conclude from what he could see, he wasn't hurt.
and it makes him all the happier. He's so in love with this man, and it's the images of them going on walks in the park, watching movies, having dinner with or without the team, that makes his relationship feel all the more
"You're right, I should." The sound of the gun went off and he flinched, a whimper of fear making its way out of his mouth. He felt no pain, and he slowly came to realize that it was a warning shot that was fired in a different direction of the room. "Now, as much as I should kill you, I think it's only fair to throw you a bone."
"How do you plan to do that," Bruce inquired, "no offense, Director, but if these things managed to take down Nat and Clint; two of the most highly trained spies, then how do you think we'll be able to handle them?"
"Of course. Anything you want and don't want me to do, just tell me and I'll listen. I promise." He watched the soldier nod in agreement, but his eyes weren't focused on him at all. They looked past him and directly up at the ceiling, the smile that was once prominent on his face was now gone, his lips formed in a straight line. A heavy sigh came out of his nose and he sat up, his back facing Tony. "Did I say something wrong? I'm sorry if I did."
Steve's words echo in his mind. Was he thinking these thoughts, or was it the mind stone making him remember his choice words. He wasn't even sure if he had control of his own mind at this point, and it was a scary thought as more words echoed in his mind shortly after.
"We're gonna win, right?" Even if they talked about this earlier, there was still that nagging feeling in the back of his mind that made him think the worse. He felt the blonde wrap his arms around his waist and kiss the side of his head. He pulled back and his own smile was prominent on his face, and it only made Tony smile more when he saw it.
"Pardon my interruption, sir," Jarvis started, causing Steve to look up at the ceiling in his lab, "but if you are going to show Captain Rogers around the city, I would suggest doing that and not wasting half the day here in the lab."
It was more casual than fancy, and Steve adored that on Tony. The only fancy thing about him was the black-tie that went with his AC/DC shirt, which was partially covered by his brown jacket, with black jeans to match. And how exactly did Steve look? A blue flannel with the sleeves curled up to his elbows, tucked into his brown slacks. He must've been standing there staring at the genius for too long, considering the man was standing there chuckling at him.
Before he opened his eyes, he could already tell that there was a body missing in his bed. He had hoped the genius would have stayed in bed with him, but he figures that Tony got up in the middle of the night and went into Shuri's lab to try and find a cure for his ailments. He had hoped the genius stayed because he was honestly looking forward to just cuddling him for a while before heading off to his therapy session. He was just delaying the inevitable at this point, and with a heavy sigh, he decided to just open his eyes and get ready for the day.
"Oh, hey," he said weakly, "sorry you have to see me like this." Her smile was kind, her hand still rubbing circles on his back as she spoke.
"What could be a good thing about this whole mess." Just then a bag was placed next to him that came from one of his favorite burger places. His eyes widened and he followed the arm that belonged to none other than Steve Rogers. The blonde had this happy aura around him that seemed to radiate to Tony, that smile on Steve's face that sent Tony's stomach into a fit of somersaults, and those beautiful ocean blue eyes that sparkled with energy that he loved to stare into so much.
"Trust me, I want to for what you did. But that isn't going to solve the damage you caused. So I suggest getting off your ass instead, otherwise, I'll do it myself." It took the sadistic smile on her face for him to get off his ass and dart straight out of his lab and to the elevator. God, how was he going to do this?
"I like the way you ramble, but you should know that what you're describing is some idea of a perfect person that doesn't exist."
"No, I know exactly what you meant. I'm sorry my existence causes you such trouble." The elevator door dinged, the doors opening as it stopped on Steves' floor. His heavy footsteps thudded against the interior of the elevator before he made his way out, stopping just outside of the doors. "I'm sorry for living as well. I'm sorry I didn't die when I put the plane down. I wish I wasn't here so I didn't cause you so much trouble."
"That's beside the point, Rogers. You still lied to me, and I don't know where the fuck you get off telling me I'm a liar when you don't know a damn thing about what I've been going through."
"I said, do you think Loki could be a part of this?" It was a possibility, what with Loki pulling that stunt in New York that almost destroyed Manhattan. Maybe the guy is still pissed off and wants to exact his revenge by getting rid of them one by one.
you." He yanked my head to the side and I felt pressure against my neck, and then a sharp pain. I closed my eyes, my breathing started to quicken as the grip in my hair lessened. My body felt on fire, this burning sensation pooling around my neck and crawling towards my stomach. I opened my eyes, and I screamed.
"You need to step out of this room for a bit." He looked at her with disbelief in his eyes, not really believing what she had just said to him. He shook his head and looked back at Tony, biting his lip.
"I'm sorry." He whispered. Shaking his head and letting out a small sob, kissing the back of his hand as a sort of apology for what he believes he's caused. He sniffles for a few seconds before regaining as much of his senses as he can to speak calmly. "Your right eye is going to be blurry for a while, as the doctors recently just told me. They're not sure if it's temporary or if the serum can fix it, so..." And he took another breath because it was too hard for him to deliver this news. He could see Steve visibly tense as his head dipped further back into the pillow his head rested on, his own tears threatening to fall from his tear ducts. He leaned forward and used one of his hands to wipe the tears away. He didn't want Steve to cry, he was already probably hurting so much on the inside because of this just like Tony, and if he cried, it would just destroy the genius even more. "They also told me that your larynx, ya know your vocal cords, Uhm... Got damaged during the operation and said that you either wouldn't be able to talk at all and even if you were able to, like right now, you'd experience frequent stuttering."
carries for this man, even after what he's done to him over the past five days, and even now, that he's willing to forgive him if he just comes through the door right now.
"Yeah. My foot in your ass, now, open the damn door!" He furiously jiggled the doorknob, still finding it locked. He heard footsteps and a heavy sigh, followed by the sound of the handle
"I gotta say, Stark here really played his part perfectly." Tony whimpered inside his cell and shook his head, looking deep into Steve's blue eyes.
die on me." He pleaded, his voice slightly hoarse. The first drop of Steve's tears hit Tony's cheek, and then the rest started to flow, dripping one by one. The brunette simply smiled, cupping the side of his face with his left hand, leaning up weakly to place a kiss on his lips before pulling away.
won't be possible. After all, once again, science cannot fix this. But he still believes, that Tony believes, that the genius can solve this. He tells himself that's the reason why he's being ignored, or forgotten after every therapy session- which, he's stopped attending fully due to not having the motivation to stay as often, or even go for that matter.
He squeezed his eyes and waited for the bullet to hit him, the sound of the gunshot loud and ringing in his ear. He didn't feel pain, he didn't feel a bullet pierce its way through him, he just heard the tiny sizzle indicating a gun did in fact go off. He turned his head slowly, and where the imposter Fury stood, the real one took his place. He looked down and saw the replica Fury with a bullet hole through its head, and he swears he's gonna have nightmares about this.
"Thanks, Bruce. And to answer your question, it was kinda hard to tell what was happening past the panic attack I was having. So, no, I don't remember anything." He paused, looking off to the side. "Scratch that, I remember everything before the severe panic attack."
sorry for what he did. It shouldn't have had to come to this for him to finally receive the touch he's been longing for, but he's been hurting for so long. He's been craving this blonde for far too long, and Siberia was just the turning point that made his emotions turn a complete one-eighty on him. He lets out a choked sob, resting his palm on the back of the hand that caresses his cheek, his lips kissing the soldier's palm.
He shuddered a bit as yesterday's events came back to him. He sat up and shook his head, willing his mind to just forget about what happened so he doesn't have another moment of PTSD or a mini panic attack. Instead, he focused on the sketchbook, grabbing it off from the drawer where it rested.
"Now I'm being sassed by Captain America, my life is over." He joked, earning himself a hearty laugh from Steve, causing him to smile back. "But you're effectively right, I'm shit at emotional, mushy stuff. Just look at how Pepper and I turned out, she's better off with someone that ain't me because of how unstable I am." He shrugged it off like no big deal, and of course, it really shouldn't have been a big deal, but for Tony it was. Pepper was his everything, and while the torch he once had for her was now nothing more than a dying flame, the memories are still there.
"We leave in about a few hours, I suggest getting ready and doing whatever you want until then. I'm sorry, but it's already decided." He sighed and nodded his head, but as he looked at her, he realized her eyes weren't focused on him, instead, she was looking past him. He turned his head and his heart dropped. He saw Tony, standing there with a frown on his face. He heard footsteps disappear behind him, signaling that Natasha left.
He didn't stir, didn't whimper, didn't make so much as a peep. He slept quietly through the night, the only sound in his ears was the sound of Jarvis, Tony's bots, his tools, and the occasional swearing of said genius. It was... Weird for Steve, in a sense. It should've been hard for him to fall asleep, considering whenever he was around someone he always felt lonely. But it was... Different this time around. It felt weird that this time - this one simple time where he
"I'm sorry," Steve whispered again, "for being weak... I'm sorry for being captured, and for not... Being stronger." His voice quivered, tears blurring his vision as he paused.
"Good boy. I knew you could do it. Come on Wanda, it's over." I heard his footsteps retreat from me, my eyes too focused on the way my hands had a mind of their own, dragging the scalpel across my wrist over and over, watching my skin tear, letting my own blood drip onto the floor, mixing with the water that still resided around me. I saw specs of black dancing before me, the room was spinning, and I could feel my breath slowly slip away.
I found my body undergoing shock, my eyes snapping open as my teeth chattered. I looked around, my eyes moving across the expanse of the room until it landed on a familiar figure, whose smile I was so familiar with.
"I'm glad you met Rhodey, he's a great guy. If it makes you feel better, I wish I was still around so I could at least stop the bullying as well." He couldn't help the full-blown smile that etched itself onto his face, truthfully it made him unbelievably happy to hear that, and he wouldn't be lying if he said a few butterflies were flapping around in his stomach.
"As much I agree with Clint," Natasha said, walking ahead of the two of them, "Cap's right, we were obviously sent here with a purpose. We should see what the root of this goose chase is about, find out what we need, bring it back to Fury, and find out all the details we can about this mission." She turned around and crossed her arms, a small smirk plastered on her face. "Any objections?"
"No problem, Cap. Now, how about we get out of here and take a walk through the park before going home."
