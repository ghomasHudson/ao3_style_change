Dean gaped, momentarily rendered speechless. “I…” He started only to snap his mouth closed before the syllable left his mouth. Was he a joke? He thought back to that first day with a frown, recalling how late he’d been to the set. He’d been coming off his heat, sure, but the decision to be late had nothing to do with that. He frowned as he considered. Could it be true? Could all his co-workers actually hate him? Was he nothing more than a joke to any of them? “You’re lying.” He countered, though his heart wasn’t in it. There was simply too much doubt.
Meg rolled her eyes at him. “Hate to disappoint, but no. I’m not kidding you. I really don’t care what Castiel does with his hobbies. And before you ask, no you're not special. You're not the first, fourth, or even the tenth omega he’s done this to.”
“He won’t believe you!” Dean shouted to his brother’s retreating form. Leave it to Sam to cross the distance in no time flat...the man really was part moose! Shaking his head, Dean followed. Bobby wouldn’t be happy, he knew, but oh well. It wasn’t like this was the first time he’d been late and probably wouldn’t be the last!
Gosh, he’d really gone and gotten sappy somewhere along the way, hadn’t he? Gabriel shook his head at himself as he opened the bag and started divvying up the food. He could be sappy as he wanted later--after his stomach was full. “So lover boy, how long are you planning on staying this time?” He asked Dean as he took a seat at the table and began unwrapping his burger. Since things had calmed down in the wake of Asmodeus’ death the angel had a habit of popping in for a few days before returning to his duties in heaven.
“That’s a buncha horseshit if I ever heard any!” Benny rumbled, sounding fierce, but his scent only relayed sorrow rather than anger as he came closer with Dean’s coffee. “I know you’re under contact and all but there ain’t any sense in you going in before you’re ready. It would be no problem to call you in sick another day.”
The steel shackle firmly tethered to his right ankle isn’t helping anything, getting tangled in the blankets and slowing him down even further. It’s a hassle that, not for the first time, Dean wishes would just go away. He’s already trapped like a rat…the rest of this just seems unnecessary.
Dean goes into heat thanks to Castiel mating him against his will. Meg finds him on the bathroom floor and does her best to help clean Dean up. Meg starts to have doubts about what her and Castiel are doing to Dean.
Dean pondered as he shuffled his way into the bathroom and headed straight for the sink. He wouldn’t be surprised to learn that Sam didn’t know yet, and Dean would have no one to thank for that except himself. He had been vague with Bobby on taking time off and since neither Sam or Bobby called Dean regularly it could be close to a month before they realized. The thought was sobering, and Dean frowned at his reflection in the mirror above the sink.
Castiel watched him, an amused glint in his eyes. “You’re adorable, did you know that?” He gushed like Dean was a cute pup rather than a very terrified man. “Hmm?” The alpha moved closer, his steps sure and measured like a predator stalking its prey. He didn’t stop until he was mere inches away from Dean’s face. Castiel leaned in, his nostrils flaring as he took a deep scenting breath. “Mmmm… you smell divine!”
Had he said something wrong? Dean wondered as he watched the way Gabriel’s face had gone slack and pale and his eyes had darted nervously towards the door. Not for the first time he wished Bobby had covered what was the appropriate thing to say to curb a human’s reaction to upsetting news. But since he hadn’t all Dean had to go on was himself, and well, how much worse could he make it? “I do not joke.” He said, voice just as calm as it’d been before. “Asmodeus is a problem that needs dealt with, which is why I’m here.”
It was already too late for him but with some luck Castiel wouldn’t target his family as well. Dean was more than willing to sacrifice himself in their stead. Considering they all thought he had up and ran, it was the least he could do . . .
How long he lay caught between waking and not he didn’t know but gradually the pain lessened enough that Gabriel felt he could possibly open his eyes. He regretted it instantly as the brightness of the room stabbed a sharp blade through his eyes before he even got them fully open. He hissed in discomfort as he squeezed his eyes shut again. Fuck, what had happened? He tried to cast his mind back, to
Dean didn’t need any prompting--he stood and shot Gabriel a grin, pleased that the human was going along with the plan. Given what little Bobby had told him about the human’s run-in with Asmodeus he knew it had to be hard and therefore was glad he didn’t have to push any harder than he had thus far. “Great!” He said excitedly as he reached out and rested his hand against Gabriel’s shoulder. Between one blink and the next they’d left the diner behind and were standing in the middle of the hotel's parking lot.
It took the better part of three hours for them to get Dean ready and out the door but Meg was relieved when he was. She leaned down, eyeing him worriedly where he was curled up into a ball on the backseat of Hannah’s car. In the dim light he looked so frail and weak bundled up in a pair of Castiel’s pajama pants and ratty old pullover hoodie. It’d been the best Meg had that wouldn’t immediately trigger Castiel’s suspicions. She just hoped it would be enough. “Drive safe.” She told Hannah as she straightened up. “Give me a call in a few days. Let me know if the package gets delivered to the right address?”
Someone is yelling his name, Dean’s near certain of it, but the sound is far away. It’s like someone shouting from a far-off tunnel but Dean can’t focus on it. The black spots in his vision continue to grow and take his concentration along with it. His heart feels like it’s going to beat straight out of his chest even as his lungs burn for the air they so desperately need but aren’t getting. What the hell is happening? A wail starts up somewhere, and god the sound stabs Dean right through his soul. It’s high and thin and sounds just like a dying animal. Dean hopes whatever it is gets put out of its misery; it’d be the merciful thing to do. The world collapses around him, the darkness growing, and all Dean can do is gasp and gasp without any reprieve.
Gabriel felt his jaw drop open for the second time and inwardly cursed himself for continuing to be so shocked by the angel. He was a hunter, dammit! He should have been reaching for the gun tucked into his waistband, not sitting here trying to wrap his mind around having a conversation with someone only he could see. And yet he couldn’t manage to help himself from asking: “If nobody else can see you, does that mean they think I’m sitting here talking to myself?” Gabriel wasn’t sure what he thought of the notion. At best the others would think he was crazy and leave him alone; at worst they’d probably turn him back into the night after declaring him a loon.
Taking a second to roll his eyes at himself and his fit of childishness Gabriel turned to face Balthazar. “Okay,” He said, caught somewhere between resigned and willing to do it. “Let’s do this.” The ‘
Cas pulled back, the pop his mouth made as it did sounded loud and obscene in the quiet room. He saw Dean's cock glisten, slick and wet with his spit, rosy with blood, hard and ready to mate with him. His own cock throbbed. It wasn't enough. He needed Dean in him, now. His hands shook from his desperation as he pulled Dean's jeans all the way down and swayed back onto his feet. Dean's hands moved to hold onto him. It stopped him falling over but Cas fell deeper into his heat as the warmth of Dean's hands burnt him, needing more, more. As he steadied himself, his lust making him clumsy, Dean's hands slid up, up under his coat to slide it off his shoulders before they stopped and dropped away. Cas tried to shrug his coat off but struggled with the arms, managed to push it off before reaching for his jacket. His fingers fumbled. He couldn't focus on what he was doing, not with Dean so close but not touching him, just watching him struggle to get his clothes off instead. The clothes that were stopping him from being touched like he needed.
Behind the door next to them was a guinea pig. The two of them turned around, rested their shoulders against the door. Dean raised three fingers to count them down.
"You didn't need to fix me like this. I'm just a guy, Cas." Cas kissed his palm, tickling the skin. Dean felt the 'no' against his skin before Cas lifted his hand and rested it against his cheek.
"It feels like I've failed when I do. I should prevent you needing to be fixed in the first place." Deep sincerity in his blue eyes, trying to get Dean to understand. "But it's beautiful, too. How you continue, don't stop because of your breaks. How you keep going and piece yourself back together. It is very human. How you change and yet you are always Dean Winchester, how this," Cas reached out to rest his palm against his heart, felt the warmth of his hand through the thinness of his tee, gave him an affectionate smile, "does not change, even when it breaks. It is so beautiful, and you are beautiful, not despite the cracks but with them and even because of them."
Of course his angel blade wouldn't kill Raphael, he knew that. But it was his last resort. He refused the pain of how well he knew the exact spot to kill any regular angel now, and how he wouldn't hesitate to do it. It worked. The slide of his knife into Rafael's chest was enough to shift Raphael's weight off him, enough to give him that second he needed to escape.
"So you're just going to brute force your way through this too? Great plan, Dean." Sam hadn't agreed with his brute force strategy earlier, was still sore about it even though Dean was now actually sore. It'd worked. He'd ganked the demons even if it meant letting them tie him up and let them think he was on the ropes. It gave Sam the chance to take them out, but Sam still looked pissy about it.
How much it hurt that he'd got his hopes up, hoped that Cas could love him, that hadn't been some sort of last minute screw up. Stupid him. It always was some sort of cosmic mistake with him, because good things never happened to Dean Winchester. Dean scooped the guinea pig up and looked at it. It met his eyes with something that almost looked like wisdom.
"I want to kiss you." The intensity didn't match the question. Cas pulled away to ask that? He raised an eyebrow.
"One of the demons got him in the ribs." Cas glanced over to Sam, who dusted off his hands as he stopped next to them, before fixing his stare back onto Dean. He reached out. He knew it was nothing, just Cas getting in his personal space to heal him. It didn't mean anything else to Cas. It was nothing and yet Dean still swallowed.
"Ugh, give me five and I'll be back. Need a human break." Despite the threat of Dean getting up, leaving for a moment, Cas didn't feel the blind panic of earlier. Didn't feel like he was about to die because Dean paused in fucking him. Instead he felt himself smile at the need for a 'human break'. That was it, his heat was done. He must only be able to handle one baby in this vessel, then. Despite his words Dean didn't rush up, trailed his hand along Cas' chest, running down his body before lingering on his hips for a moment. Cas let him linger, he would let Dean take as long as he wanted, but Dean finally pulled himself up and out of bed. Carefully Dean picked his way through the broken glass to the bathroom, moving like it was a trap he'd set to capture Dean but he'd never be caught by.
"A pocket dimension that leads to Dean's house." Cas didn't reply, lifted the guinea pig up from off his chest, held it up in front of his face to look at it before putting it on his shoulder. The guinea pig was calm, relaxed as it nuzzled up against his neck. It was the kind of attention Cas used to give to him, before he came up here and Cas had once again vanished.
He wasn't subtle at all in his sweatpants. His cock was straining against them and yet Cas kissed along the line of his hips like he hadn't noticed. Even with his hands in his hair he took his sweet, tortuous time. When he finally pulled his sweatpants down, despite the way Cas looked when his cock bounced free, breathless and eyes dark with arousal, he still didn't touch his cock. He was as dedicated to kissing every part of him as he said, proving his love to every part of his body. Injuries he didn't remember on his thighs, Cas ignoring how they trembled against his lips. He worked down his knees, the cracks from smashing them against stairs, the accumulated scars from too many fights and just from where they hurt sometimes, another sign of getting too damn old. Along his calves, lingered on a long slice along his ankle that made him groan, even kissed the crack on one of his toes where he'd banged it against a stray table leg in a motel room and bruised it three minutes before Cas arrived.
"No shit. What tipped you off?" Cas quirked his mouth in response, letting his thumb rub along just under his eye. It made him ask what he always wanted to ask Cas. "You staying?"
Cas lifted his face from his neck and looked up at him. He was practically shining too, just from happiness instead of with grace. It was the goddamn happiest he'd ever seen Cas, and yeah, okay, that was worth it. That was so worth all of it.
Smoke was on the air, the smell of Sam taking care of business. He'd insisted, left Dean to make the long walk back to Baby on his own. It meant there was no audience how much each inhale hurt like a bitch at least. He leaned against the driver's door, keys in his hand, and tried not to hiss when he took too deep a breath.
"Is your office over Dean's house?" Dean watched Cas intensely. Cas resolutely and absolutely, did not meet his eyes. Bingo. Sam was right.
The warmth around him woke him up, slowly shaking Dean out of his sleep. Whoever it was pressed up against him, arms circled around his waist and fingers interlaced with his own, and hips pressed flush against his ass, was totally overdressed for the situation.
"Weren't you just doing that?" Cas let out a noise like Dean was being especially stupid, his gaze drifting down to the glowing cut under his eye again, before forcing it back up.
"You can't do this dry Cas, for the love of God-" Cas didn't stop, didn't want to hear another word about God while doing this. He dropped all the way down in one move and filled himself with Dean. The burn, the fill of it. Dean's cock bottomed all the way out in his ass, and sent shocks through him. He bit back a whine, felt like he'd just downed water after nearly dying of thirst. The pain was only for a moment, before a casual flick of his grace dealt with it. Dean's cock eased the real, deeper pain of not having, of not being filled, of not being bred like he needed. Dean groaned under a wriggle of his hips and looked up at him, with an arm thrown over his head, with irritation, spiked with lust. "You're crazy." Dean was right. Angelic heat was a form of insanity so Cas didn't argue. Couldn't with how badly he wanted it anyway, he didn't want to think of retorts, of pushing back. He just wanted his cock. He shifted, trying to push it even deeper inside him, before he moved his hips to start fucking himself on Dean's cock.
"But the guinea pigs-" The woman stopped and glanced around her at the mass of guinea pigs around her, still placidly eating Dean's back yard up. She let out a breath of relief.
The whole galaxy and everything in it. Every star and black hole, supernova and planet, comet and every corner where anything lived, overlayed on his human eyes watching Dean above him. Double sight. He was coming as an angel and human all at once, seeing the whole universe and yet only seeing Dean too, just as beautiful and important as the universe, maybe even more so. He felt Dean's soul bursting through to touch his grace, to tangle up in it like he was an angel, like he could read every part of him just like he'd read all of Dean while pulling him out of hell. It felt like when he'd held Dean in his grace then, but this time Dean was responsive, not afraid, not hiding. He knew him now too.
"Really? His hair is way more like Sam's." He should be more annoyed that Cas decided hanging out with a guinea pig with his name was more important than seeing him. With Cas still there in front of him, looking up at him like he mattered, like he was the center of the goddamn universe, he wasn't. "Why?" Cas swallowed.
"I need you to breed me." His voice was rough, needy. Dean groaned, head thumping back onto the pillow again.
The promise of more lingered in the air. Dean wasn't rushing away, was only taking a break and expecting Cas to still be in bed, waiting for him when he came back. Cas wanted it, wanted more. Even with his heat finishing, he could keep going. He wanted to keep going, to stay the night with Dean and fuck until dawn, until Dean finally collapsed in exhaustion. To lie by Dean when he slept, to watch over him until he woke up, then go to get breakfast together when he did. To watch Dean eat with that ache in his chest it always gave him to see Dean eating, to see him happy, while his coffee was neglected in front of him, while Dean ripped on Sam for whatever choice he'd made for his breakfast.
"I can't exactly sew up my own back, Sammy." Dean countered and Sam was hit suddenly by a jolt of realization that during his time at Stanford, Dean could easily have been killed and Sam would have been none the wiser. "Anyway," Dean continued, "they gave me a prescription for painkillers, good ones too, and when I got back to the motel I saw the bottle of whiskey I had and I thought…I could do it. Just swallow it all down and…fade away." He let out a humourless laugh. "I mean, who would miss me right?"
"What?" She demanded, loud enough for the whole table to hear. "Why is he with you? I thought you said he was like the King of Hell or something?"
"Yeah. Listen, I got a match, and it's not from the lore... it's from police records. Looks like that symbol you found was spotted at a handful of crime scenes the last couple days, all multiple homicides."
"The only thing that matters in the end is the mission. Protecting those who would not and cannot protect themselves; the humans. None of us is bigger than that. And we will not let our fears, our self-absorption prevent us from seeing it through. Not anymore."
Castiel looked down at his hands to find that they were indeed quaking and his breathing had sped up to match the pounding of his heart.
"Look Dean-o," Gabriel started before Dean could continue, "I can't always fly in at the last second and Deus Ex Machina the world out of every blunder it gets itself into. That would be cheating. Besides, you're here aren't you?"
"Sometimes I forget…that I'm not an angel anymore, and all I want to do is protect you, like I used to." he looked over at Dean, pain shining through his blue eyes. "But I'm not, Dean…I'm human." he said softly.
On stage Dean was wrapping up an anecdote about pranks that happened behind the scenes on some of his movies and a question was asked that sent Castiel's heart racing.
Then he leapt forward, tackling Sam in a hug and Sam laughed while Sarah grabbed Castiel’s arm and leant her head on his shoulder.
Dean, who had been watching Cas' movements hypnotically, snapped back to attention and he looked up and smiled.
Castiel look up to see a sad, faraway look in Dean's eyes as he thought back to the parent he had lost so long ago.
He knew he was dreaming because in the dream he was an angel, and he was in heaven. He closed his eyes, breathing in the scent that was so unlike anything he had come across on earth.
Bobby was outside chopping wood when Dean sauntered out of the cabin clutching a bottle of beer like it was a lifeline and loitering in his peripheral vision. Bobby gave him a couple of minutes but when Dean didn't offer up anything, he sunk his axe down into the stump and turned to face the man he'd come to see as his own son.
"I'm not all that special Cas." he said in a voice that Cas had come to learn meant he was trying to mask his deeper emotions.
"Dean." he said and Dean glanced up to see a confused expression on Cas' face. "What are you talking about?"
Dean filled a cup with water and handed it to Sam who nearly spilled it when he tried to hold it on his own. Dean grabbed a straw and held the cup up so Sam could drink.
He played with Mary and Sam, he laughed, he hugged his mom and his younger brother, he drew pictures and played with toy cars and showed baby Sammy all of his favourite things and Dean saw the carefree wonder reflected in his own eyes and felt unburdened.
Crowley stood, holding a finger to his lips as he moved as quietly as he could to one of the library's alcoves, retrieving one of the swords that sat on display and moving towards the entrance to the library, Kevin hovering behind him.
"Okay, let's say you win, Dean, and I die. What's the world left with then, hmm? A herd of panty-waisted angels and you?"
"Listen, I don't want you keeping this all in anymore all right? You feel something, you come tell me, got it?"
Sam woke with a crick in his neck and rubbed his eyes as he glanced over at his brother. Dean was still fast asleep in the same position he'd been in when he had passed out and had luckily not thrown up again. He checked his watch – it was late morning so he stood and made his way to the kitchen. He was just finishing off some pancakes when Dean stumbled in, still wearing the clothes from last night, and fell into a chair at the table.
"Fascinating." He murmured before continuing. "I was communing with the trees. Trying to find the best choice. I found it."
Dean held his gaze, trying desperately to find any sort of indication of falsehood in them. Anything he could use to fuel his anger at having an injured and weeping Cas clinging to him like a child. But there was nothing but sad truth in the archangel's eyes and Dean slumped, nodding his acceptance as he brushed a soft kiss over the once again human angel's hair, closing his eyes and rocking the crying man slightly, whispering soothing gibberish and giving absolutely no fucks that his brother and the trickster were witness to his moment of tenderness.
Sam and Dean had managed to stop the bleeding enough to stitch up the wound; roughly, but enough so that Crowley wouldn't bleed out. He hadn't woken as of yet and they had moved him to a room closer to where everyone else was in order to keep a better eye on him.
Another rush of ladies stole away Dean's attention but he still kept an eye on the guy and as the night wore on and the crowd thinned, Dean finally found an opportunity to approach him when it looked like his glass could use a refill.
Then he felt a release of power like lightening across his skin and the shimmering net wavered and stuttered. Another burst of kinetic energy and the block faded even more. One more and he was through the door, breaking down the last of the warding before it had fallen. He could feel the remaining sigils sapping his energy, blocking his connection to the rest of the host. He did not care. Scrambling down the stairs, he made it to the main room to see Crowley with a can of black spray paint and several crossed out sigils.
Castiel stared at him with his usual intense gaze before leaning down and pressing a kiss to the sigil and moving back up and planting another one on Dean's lips, soft and sweet.
Jody stood and moved to the two boys on the bed, her motherly instincts still active despite having no child to direct them to.
Cas groaned and brought his forehead down lightly on the steering wheel. This was not the first car he had 'borrowed' that had mysteriously stopped working. He knew he ought to know why, he had spent enough time with Dean in the Impala, but he had never really paid much attention to the vehicle apart from the fact that it smelled like Dean and felt like home.
"They are lost, confused, and angry. Angels were not created to have free will like humans. We were created to follow orders. It's what we do best. I think the last few years have proved that we don't do well when we try to lead. I have faith that if the right angel were to take charge, he could unite heaven peacefully. But unfortunately I am not overly confident that the right angel is the one most likely to take power." His tone was sad as he ruminated on his fallen brothers and sisters and his own past mistakes.
When he reached the low riding waistband of the boxers Dean had worn to bed, he peppered light kisses along his hip bones, eliciting a wrecked moan from Dean as he shifted, bringing his knees up on either side on Cas' body and tangling his fingers in Cas' soft, unmanageable hair.
The drive back to the bunker was made in silence. Dean sat in the drivers seat staring hypnotically out onto the road, Sam dozed in the passenger seat, head propped up against the glass in a position that was all too familiar to him, and Castiel sat in the back, photos and mementos from his office sitting in a box beside him and Brian cradled in his hands as he tried not to think about what his next step would be, or if there even was another step to take.
It hurt so much, the tightness in his chest and the emptiness in his heart and the nausea in his stomach (although that may have had something to do with the hangover).
They continued kissing, hands roaming, touching, feeling. Castiel allowed his hand to slip beneath the waistband of the sweats Dean wore, fingers brushing over coarse hair and warm flesh. Dean's breathing sped up and Cas began stroking, fascinated by the feel and by his own body's response.
"Did I do it right? I have observed many kisses during my existence but I have not had much practical experience."
"Hey, Cheetah, Think fast." Jo said as she threw the towel she's been using to wipe down tables at him. He turned and it hit him in the face, bouncing off and falling lightly to the ground.
He turned, creating the portal back with a sweeping gesture of his arm. As he stepped into the ever growing column of smokey, liquid light, he turned and, with a wink, he was gone.
He had not remembered, had not recognized the angel when he had appeared again in the form of Jimmy Novak, but the connection, the 'profound bond' was still there, long after the handprint had faded from his shoulder, it was there. And now he could see that glow again. Castiel. Not Cas.
"That's your 'Big News'?" Sam asked, staring at the page of indecipherable symbols, "That you translated the tablet into…doodles?"
Cas raised his hand, intertwining their fingers and squeezing, and Dean smiled at the unspoken show of support.
"No. I mean, I never got along with the guy. We butted heads a lot when I was growing up and I pretty much hated him by the time I went off to college. But then he gave his life to save Dean and I…I mourned him as a hero. And Dean always sang his praises. Dean followed him blindly. Dean did everything he asked without question. And it always pissed me off so much. And then to find out he did that to him and more? Dean said Dad beat him too and he still obeyed every order." Sam shook his head. "And I know why Dean did it too, and that…that's what makes it so much worse."
"Yeah, he wasn't too happy when he came home to find me making out with another guy, so…" he trailed off, playing with a loose thread in the bedspread.
"Oh that," he said, rubbing his neck self-consciously, "I ah, saw you looking at it, thought you might like it. We can always take it back if you don't I just thought…"
Sam glanced up from his book as the figure in the bed began to stir. Crowley blinked open his eyes and lay staring at the blank ceiling for a long moment. Finally, Sam broke the silence by holding out two white pills and a glass of water.
"If you want me to go, I will go. And gladly, if it means I will not have to listen to you speak to me this way again. But don't you dare forget why I have done all that I have done, or for whom I did it."
Bobby settled in his seat, sitting back and crossed his arms, Sam and Sarah grasped hands, and Ellen threw an arm around Jo, everyone sensing that the story they were about to hear would not be a happy one.
"Yeah," Dean agreed. "Anyway, he says he wants to talk to you. You can feel free to tell him to piss off."
Dean rolled his eyes and Castiel frowned and cocked his head in bewilderment at the ideas humans concocted. Did they truly believe that his father would have given them the pleasure of fornication if he expected them not experience let alone enjoy it? It really was quite irrational.
Dean still couldn't quite get over the look of Cas in soft flannel pants and his old ratty t-shirts that Cas always insisted on wearing, despite having his own.
Without any sort of conscious thought process, Dean found himself leaning forward and pressing his lips against Castiel's.
There was a click and a dial tone and Dean hung up the phone. It didn't fix anything, having Benny exact some righteous revenge on the men who had ruined Cas' life, but it did lift the burden a little, making it easier to bear.
Once the dust had cleared, Castiel stepped from the wreckage of his own cell to find Hannah gasping over Gadreel's prone body.
"Well, look at you walking and talking." He remarked as Cas stepped forwards, coming to stand in front of the two brothers, "That's…that's great right?"
To his surprise, Dean didn’t scoff at the sappy words and stalk off to tinker with the blue muscle car they'd pulled up in. Instead, Bobby watched as tears welled up in the boy's eyes and he began to sense that this went deeper than a sexual crisis over his feelings for Castiel.
"If one of us were to pray for guidance, we may be able to get an angel here who could give us the information we need."
"Sorry. But I don't want you ever thinking you're a burden to us. Ever. You hear me? 'Cause you've saved me in so many ways. And not as an angel."
"Well, I can't stay here, Dean." Cas said, obviously not catching on to Dean's warning tone. "For one thing, the warding is blocking most of my power, and I don't even know where Metatron is. Also, my wings are damaged beyond repair which means I can't fly."
"I'm not here to fight." He declared. "I thought about what you said. You're right. Metatron, he's...something needs to be done."
"It's just the way I was raised, you know?" he said, trying and failing to keep his voice aloof, "My dad never really had much time for tears. Not from me anyway. I had to be strong, had to keep Sam safe."
Dean trailed off and moved his hand so he was grasping the back of Cas's head, his fingers tangling in the soft hair.
"Your body has expended a great deal of energy healing you." Cas interjected. "How have you been sleeping?"
Dean had weighed the options, already knowing what choice he was going to make. He knew Robin would get hurt, but in the end he would always choose Sam. He would always choose his little brother. And he hadn't been lying when he'd told Sam earlier that he didn't know what he was talking about when Sam had said it couldn't have been easy, because it
And suddenly Charlie understood and she knew that the look she had seen in hunteress' eyes had not been discomfort or scorn, it had been yearning.
“You got the look. You go through something like that, it leaves you with scars. It also leaves you with the ability to see them in others.”
"Well, look around." Metatron explained benevolently. "You've seen earth. You've had a taste of free will. I got to ask you, do you like it? I mean, the way you've flocked off to follow Castiel tells me you need to follow someone. It's in your DNA. But Cas? He's not what you think he is. He sends angels out to die. Have you told them about your stolen Grace, Castiel? How it's fading away, and when it burns out, so will you?"
Dean fidgeted with his slippery keys and opened the trunk, and they shoved everything hastily inside, then slammed it and sloshed around to the Impala’s front seat, sliding quickly inside. They pulled the doors closed and the sound of the rain muffled into a dull, static roar. For a moment they sat there, breathing heavily with effort and the chill of being drenched in the cool October rain, then they looked over at each other and began to laugh.
“Calm down, Cassie,” Michael said, sneering. “No need to be defensive.” He paused and looked away from Castiel, back down into the valley, where the deer were beginning to migrate back into the woods. “Yours wasn’t the only world our father abandoned. But unlike you, we stuck to his plan—rained down holy fire on the Earth and completed the prophecy of Apocalypse. We thought it would bring him back.”
Dean grinned and shook his head, amused, as he stepped into the shower, invading Castiel’s personal space. The hot water spilled over the back of his neck and Dean sighed, closing his eyes and leaning into it. He tilted his chin up and let the water splash onto his face. “It is nice,” he said. “We’re always in such a hurry. Haven’t enjoyed a shower in a long time.”
Sorry this is so late, I was a little blocked on this chapter so I went and wrote some other stuff instead. But here we are. Hope you like :)
“Because it crumbled. The pieces got crushed to dust by whatever’s happening inside his head right now.”
Dean closed his eyes and leaned forward, resting his forehead against Castiel's and revelled in the quiet moment, just happy that they were both still alive.
"Of course not. Besides, with my dating history a month is like a year. It's about time you met everyone else. Besides, Sammy's dying to meet you. He's really curious since I haven't really been able to tell him much about you, don't worry, I told him personal questions were off the table. Anyway, he may want to do the whole protective brother thing."
Dean swallowed, feeling vulnerable and exposed beneath the ex-angel's intense gaze, a feeling he was decidedly not comfortable with.
The house was put up for sale. Nick dealt with all that; one of the few helpful gestures that he actually appreciated.
Dean was huddled up against a pillar, his eyes closed and body shaking as his breaths came in short gasps.
“Congrats little brother.” He said, patting the gigantor’s cheek and smiling before moving over to hug his future sister-in-law.
Castiel seemed to consider this dilemma intently as he idly chewed his burger. Dean considered trying to explain it to him but found he couldn't come up with any plausible reason.
"Fine!" he shouted back, calling on his millennia of experience as an angel to steel his expression and hide the pain. "If that's what you want, fine!"
Dean nodded again and cleared his throat, pushing back the burning sensation in the back of his eyes.
Cas smiled and dipped lower; fanning his breath over the thin layer of cotton that separated him from Dean's ever growing interest and Dean keened and panted above him.
"Well…" Dean smirked and Castiel buried his face in his hand, not relishing the rehashing of their rather embarrassing first meeting.
Castiel thanked Dean and took them. Once he was finished with the glass, Dean placed it back on the side table and turning back around.
"Hey Cas." He greeted, forcing false calm into his voice, a life-long habit borne from his need to keep his emotions hidden and his head above water.
"What? Where?" Sam asked, moving over to look at the computer screen as Cas came over to peek over Dean's shoulder.
"Yeah I know." Dean said, "I just want to help is all. Besides, it'll be faster with both of us carrying it."
He looked down at the stick that was still in his cup and lifted it, drawing it slowly across his tongue as Dean had, before turning and tossing it at the garbage can, feeling an unexpected thrill of accomplishment when it sailed in.
"Yes, Dean?" Cas's answer sounded deep in Dean's stomach, the vibrations of the low bass thrumming through his bones like a tuning fork.
Dean glowered but sighed and turned to Crowley, glaring at hm. The man held up his hands in supplication.
"You've been working those people outside for, what, a day? They've already spilled blood in your name. You are nothing but Bernie Madoff with wings."
He stepped slowly and cautiously into the room, knowing it was never a good idea to sneak up on a Winchester.
"The crazy guy." Metatron explained. "Big knife. Kablooey. I'm fine, thanks for asking, but Gadreel is wounded, and Tyrus, the other faction leader, R.I.P. His followers are not your biggest fans, by the way. They've all come over to my team."
And then it was over and Cas slumped forwards onto Dean's heaving chest as he fought to control his breathing.
"I would like to give you my gift now." he said softly and Dean could detect a measure of excitement and nervousness flowing through the connection.
He told himself this, hoping he would believe it. Metatron lied. Metatron lied all the time. There was no reason to believe him. Dean was fine. Dean had to be.
Dean sat with elbows resting on bended knees, his hands in his hair, unable to look at his brother as shame painted his features red.
"Did you just bring me a plate of sandwiches that you made for me?" Dean asked with slowly growing love and adoration in his eyes.
"The angel tablet has power. If Metatron can harness that power…who knows what he may be able to do."
"I mean it." Cas repeated, "You have never deserved any of the terrible things that have happened to you."
Dean started. He hadn’t realized how unlike Castiel Emmanuel had been until that moment and Dean was hit with an overwhelming feeling of relief that the angel was finally back followed by sorrow at the immeasurable amount of pain he could see in the angel’s eyes.
Silence settled over the kitchen as Dean and Sam went back to their meals and Cas grabbed a hold of Dean's hand under the table, squeezing it and stroking over the skin as Dean attempted to finish his sandwich one-handed.
"Not for that. Well…not just for that." He fixed Dean with his gaze so that Dean couldn't look away.
"Sure, why not. I suppose you two being sickeningly sweet together is better than you two being angsty and morose apart. Just let me interrupt a few sigils and we'll have you back with your BF in no time."
He heard voices, Sam and Dean, moving toward him. He started to get up, not wanting to be caught eavesdropping when he heard his name.
Dean was hyperventilating now, having backed himself into a corner and slowly sliding down the wall to sit on the floor, fingers tangling painfully in his hair as he buried his head in his knees.
"Oh, shit I'm so sorry, Sam mentioned that you don't like talking about your past. I'm so sorry Castiel."
"Well, it all started when I was four and my brother Sam was six-months. Our house caught fire. My dad managed to get me and Sam out but…my mom didn't make it.
An idea occurred to Castiel and he glanced over at Dean, whose green eyes were still open, blank and unseeing.
Cas looked back at the racks upon racks of pants and shirts and sweaters and jackets. He looked back at Dean.
Dean stared. Was this a joke? If it wasn’t for the fact that Cas’ sense of humor was not nearly developed enough to pull a joke like that off, he might have been inclined to believe it. He stared at the man standing at the foot of the stairs staring back up at him. This
So this takes place during 9x04. It basically follows the plot of the episode (with minor details changed and things added obviously) so if some of the dialogue sounds familiar, that's probably because I didn't write it and you're remembering it from the show.
"Kevin's translated part of the tablet into a dead language. We were hoping you could help us read it."
Crowley stepped into the library as Kevin laid the phone down, letting out an exhausted sigh as he ran his fingers over his tried eyes.
truly terrified. His brother, who had been hunting monsters since before he was old enough to hold a gun, was shaking in fear.
He reached a curious hand out and ran a finger along the feather, feeling its otherworldly softness. The limb twitched and a soft grunt sounded from behind Dean. He turned to see Cas grimace in his sleep, his face scrunching up in a manner that was decidedly cute at Dean's touch. His heart swelled at the sight of the sleeping angel lying once again beside him. It was so right that, for a moment, it felt as though he had woken from a nightmare, as though the last few months had been nothing but a bad dream. All was right with the world.
The hunter turned and, quick as a flash, the hag reached forward and snatched the key from Dean's grasp.
Then one evening, when Dean was in the kitchen cleaning up from dinner with Sam helping from the chair he was still using occasionally when walking became too much, Dean's cell phone rang, vibrating loudly against the stainless steel countertop.
It was a few hours later that Dean wandered into the library, picking up his phone charger where he had left it lying on the table and plugging in his phone to power up and Sam leapt at the chance to question his brother about his boyfriend.
Dean looked up surreptitiously to see how Cas was enjoying the song but stood and moved to him when he saw that the other man was standing frozen against the bar, eyes fixed on the speakers and tears trickling in silent tracks down his cheeks.
He rested his hand, fingers splayed, over Dean's chest, feeling the comforting pounding of his heart in his chest.
"Hey Castiel." His relieved tone of voice told Dean that his brother was thinking along very similar lines to Dean.
Dean smiled and closed what little gap there was left between them, pressing his lips to Cas' and kissing him slowly, his arms encircling his torso and his hands running over the strong muscles of the former angel's back, fisting the plaid shirt that Cas had borrowed from Dean because he 'liked the way it smelled'.
"You're gonna be okay. You've got a pretty good goose-egg but you should be fine." His body sagged at the words and he pulled the other man into a relieved embrace burying his face in the dark tousled hair.
"Oh, right. It's just, I thought, after last night maybe you wanted to…" he trailed off, face heating.
"Yeah." he said breathlessly, thanking someone when a motel with a vacancy sign appeared in the next block.
"Okay I... I'm not sure what a fictional battle station in space has to do with this, but if taking out the emperor means taking out Metatron, I'm on board."
And then he was in the Impala, driving to Metatron's last known location and hoping that whatever he was about to do would end up being useful in the long run.
Castiel still had not been able to tell Dean anything else about his past. Dean had asked a few times but not in a pushy way and each time Castiel had wondered if he was ready, only to find his breath quickening and his throat closing up. Those times usually ended with Dean holding Cas and rubbing his back as the other man fought to keep his breathing steady and the tears at bay. Still, Dean did not push and Castiel found himself staring at times in wonder at how lucky he was to have found such a good man.
He reached up a hand to cup Cas' cheek, running his fingers over the ever-present scruff. Cas leaned into it slightly and Dean took the opportunity to bring his lips to the fallen angel's. Dean moved his lips and Cas followed suit and the moan that escaped from between Cas' lips was downright sinful and pretty soon Dean had a lap-full of eager angel.
Dean knew he should apologize, wanted to apologize, but Cas just looked up at him and gave him a small smile.
"Hey, hey, hey." Dean stopped him, covering the hand that was on his leg with his own. "It's all right, I'm not mad. Although, I think Sam would appreciate if you didn't come to him about the more…physical aspects of our relationship again. But, you shouldn't have had to do that. I should have…talked to you, like I promised, I just... I guess I'm not really very good at this, Cas. I don't…I don't like to talk about how I feel or what's going on with me. I'm just not comfortable with it. But I want to try. For you."
He pulled out the angel blade he had stashed in his coat sleeve. No way was he entering a room with a crazed angel without some kind of back up.
"I wanted to. Or a part of me did. I think that was the scariest part 'cause most of me wanted to live but…" he shook his head.
Sam felt like throwing up. He had never gotten along well with his father but never would he have thought the man capable of this. Hesitantly he reached out a hand to rest on Dean's shoulder. His brother stiffened but did not throw him off.
When Dean's sobs eventually died down, Sam helped him to his feet and guided him to the passenger side door. It was disturbing how submissive his normally recalcitrant brother was but at least it made getting him into the car easier.
"But you do." Cas countered, "A miniscule amount, I'll grant you, but it is there. And last night it activated."
"I'm really, really happy." He said it with a frown, as though he couldn't quite understand how it had happened.
They broke away and Dean swiped surreptitiously at his eyes while Sam passed a parcel over to the angel.
He thought about Castiel who sat beside him and how patient he'd been with Dean in the past few weeks since Dean had poured his heart out to him in the crappy motel room. They had made some headway in their physical relationship, moving forward slowly and tentatively, Cas always quick to ask Dean how he was feeling and if it was too much. Truth be told, at times it was annoying as hell and Dean may or may not have snapped at Cas once or twice for being overbearing and overly cautious, but sitting here in this group, surrounded by strangers and the two people he loved and trusted most in the world, he was thankful for the support he had no matter how saccharine that sounded.
Dean shrugged and cleared his throat. He could see Sam looking worriedly at him from the corner of his eye.
"In hell, after I pulled you out, you required…a great deal of healing; physically and spiritually. There was only one way. You struggled at first, but eventually you conceded. I suspect you were just in too much pain."
Dean idly wondered if the guy had been mugged or pickpocketed. He dove back in again and rifled through the pockets searching for keys but came up empty.
. Because at least if Dean was around he could keep an eye on his father and look out for his little brother.
"Stop?" Ephram interrupted, his brow creasing as he failed to comprehend Castiel's plea. "I won't stop until I wash clean the planet of all suffering."
"Great!" Dean shouted back as Cas turned to go. "Great! Just go! Fly off like you always do! Oh wait, I forgot, you can't fly! Well, have fun moving around like the rest of us pathetic mud monkeys! That's what you dicks call us, right?"
"Raphael sent me into heat and I need someone to mate with me right now. I have about five minutes before I lose all control and try to have sex with the nearest being." Dean blinked, surprised for a moment before it was replaced by disbelief as he shook his head.
He had. Tried praying to him a bunch of times. He was damn sure Cas had heard him but there was no sign of the feathery asshole. It was bad enough that his brother was bringing it up. It'd be even worse if he found out Cas was leaving him on the angelic equivalent of read.
Dean stopped. It took Cas a moment to realize he had, that Dean's cock was still inside him but not moving as Dean looked at him.
"You like that? Talking like you've seen everything but it's so easy to overwhelm you." Even in his need, his desperation, he gave Dean a squinty, irritated look in response to Dean thinking he knew more, undermined by another jolt, as the aching shot through him. Dean didn't care, kept talking even as his breathing stuttered. "You're so good like this though. Ready to be breed, all warm and welcoming for my cock. So crazy for my dick you didn't even prep for it." Dean groaned, pounded harder into Cas as his nails scrambled across his back, cut deeper into it as Dean fucked him relentlessly. "Gonna come again."
The first sign that anything was wrong in heaven was the snuffling noise coming from underneath the kitchen table.
"Slow down there, cowboy. Don't you even want to kiss first?" Cas looked up. Even from between Dean's thighs on his knees, fingers wrapped around Dean's cock, desperate to suck him off, he could still glare. He could still ignore any twist inside him from the suggestion.
"Don't stop." Dean sighed before flipping Cas over. Cas fell without resistance, letting Dean pin him down onto the mattress, loom over him like he was going to give him the screwing of a lifetime. The thought made his heat burn in him, need flaring up. Dean was pinning him down. Dean was going to breed him until it took, until he was sated and filled with come and wrecked. The thought made him shudder, his cock sliding against the line of Dean's hip as he pressed down on top of him.
He was filled with so much grace that on first glance it was dazzling, and it was all from Cas. It was like he was a pot that kept getting broken and yet Cas kept fixing him anyway.
Dean lay on the grass, Cas lying next to him, body slightly pressed up against his as they watched the blue sky above. His right arm, his fingers interlaced with the fingers of Cas' left hand, lying between them. If he focused, the blue changed to a different shade to what he was used to. Perhaps it was how the guinea pigs saw it. Were they color-blind? Dogs sure were. He felt a guinea pig sniff at his arm before moving on, looking for something to eat instead. He tilted his head to look over at Cas. He was lying there, letting the sun soak into him while several guinea pigs climbed over him, exploring. One had fallen asleep on his chest. Cas looked happy. Cas looked really, really happy. Apparently the trick to make Cas truly happy had been guinea pigs all along, even if the Empty had thought it was him.
"After a few days you won't be able to see it any longer." Dean watched himself, reflected in the mirror. It was too late, he knew what it looked like. He could see Cas' devotion written into his skin, as he tried to hold the broken parts of him together. It was too much. He didn't deserve it, still wanted it.
"Hello, Dean." Cas' breath was warm as it tickled against his ear, voice thick and slow like he'd been sleeping too. Of course he didn't need to, which probably meant he watched him sleep all night. That should be creepy but wasn't. He loosened his fingers from Cas' hands and turned over to face him. He met the sincerity that Cas was showering him in as if he hadn't just woken up from finally getting some sleep after a week of sleep deprivation.
When he finally looked up, catching his breath again, Cas already had his cock out. He shifted, propped on his elbows to get ready to reach out and give him a hand. Cas took it in hand before he could, jerking himself off at a furious pace as his thighs straddled Dean, before coming with a quiet gasp of 'Dean'. The sight made Dean's breath catch, seeing Cas completely let go, and right on top of him. It splashed onto his stomach, a line of come falling perfectly on top of one of the glowing cracks on his stomach.
He'd adjusted to the background pain, but gritted his teeth as Sam opened the door and thought of painkillers and sleep. Sam offered an arm he dismissed with a wave of his hand. He wasn't that badly injured, he could still walk by himself. The lights were already on as they walked in, a sign that made Dean groan in frustration as he reached for his gun. He hoped it wasn't the kind of unexpected visitor who needed to get their ass kicked.
"Sam! Dean!" The enthusiasm in Jack's voice was enough to let Dean drop his guard. He walked over to the top of the stairs and looked down into the War Room. Jack was there, waved at them with boundless enthusiasm, and sitting next to him at the table, was Cas.
There. At the edge of his grace, in the bow wave caused by Dean's soul steaming through it like he charged into everything. There it was, the moment of conception. He could feel it. The terrible, awesome love spinning inside him and its consequences. The Nephilim now inside him, both in his grace and his body. Trailing in the wake of Dean racing through his grace and settling into his human body.
The voice buzzed in the back of his subconscious, but he ignored it, focused as he was on the fact that Castiel was actually here, in his arms, kissing him.
"I do not think he is entirely mentally stable. He seems to fancy himself as some kind of hero who required a villain, an antagonist. And apparently he wants it to be me."
"So, you've come back. I do hope it's to make up with your emotionally stunted boyfriend because honestly, it's been hell here the last few months. Almost called you myself a couple of times."
"We need to figure out what we're going to do now." Sam declared, changing the subject and trying to steer the conversation away from any more awkward emotional moments between his brother and his brother's angel.
"And you're sitting in my chair." Metatron added and at his words Castiel's hands were cuffed to the armrests.
"Don't worry." he assured, carding his fingers through Cas' soft, dark hair, which Cas practically purred at. "Sam's on his way with coffee."
He placed his hand on the wound which was still trickling blood and poured the remainder of his grace into him. Slowly, he healed the extensive damage, lungs sealing, muscles reforming. The bruises on his face faded, the crushed wrist reformed, the blood dissipating and Castiel pressed a kiss to his temple as Dean sucked in a breath and his green eyes blinked open.
Dean's eyes opened, the normally vivid green dulled as he blinked sluggishly in the dim light, and Cas let himself relax. This wasn't the first time Dean had been subject to a panic attack in the last week, and Cas cursed himself for losing control.
"You're an excellent boyfriend." Dean assured him. "And yes I suppose that's what we are, although I don't really like that term."
She stepped back and eyed the blue-eyed man not dressed as a fed. He was standing far closer to Dean than she'd ever have thought Dean would be comfortable with. Not that she knew the boys that well, but Dean did have a certain…'image' that he put forward and this didn't really compute with that.
She continued forwards, picking up the pace before her foot touched the outer ring of the inlayed devil's trap and she leapt back as though burned.
He had been going all day, apologizing again and again for the things he had said, insisting he hadn't meant them and pleading for the angel to return. And Cas desperately wanted to fulfill that request.
He did the same to Kevin whom he found a few hallways later. The little blighter put up more of a fight than his mother but eventually Crowley got them into the safety of the dungeon.
Bonny's words, despite being bat-shit crazy, struck a chord in Dean. Clean slate, the chance to do it all over again, to reclaim his virginity and wipe away everything else; the panic attacks, the slew of faceless, nameless, meaningless hook-ups, and, most importantly of all, his father.
It had been nearly a year, nearly a year since Dean had ridden into his life and saved it. Castiel looked over to the man who sat next to him and was currently grinning and applauding his little brother on his big day. It had been an eventful year, not only with meeting Dean and somehow carving out a space in his life where he could feel marginally happy without also feeling overrun with guilt and grief.
Meeting Castiel’s three older brothers had been interesting, and by interesting, Dean meant fucking terrifying.
“Anyway, he wanted me to let you guys know.” Dean shifted forwards, resting his elbows on his knees, hands clasped, “Look, we’ve all lost people. We know what it’s like, the pain, the emptiness. And the pity. I think it goes without saying that he’d rather not have to deal with that this weekend.”
Dean's voice echoed in his head once more, tones soft and sad. Cas could picture him sitting alone in the bunker, head bowed, shoulders slumped, exhausted from once again trying to carry all of his anguish by himself.
Dean looked thoughtful. It would be nice not having to rely so heavily on pool hustling and credit card fraud anymore.
Dean closed his eyes and tried desperately to calm his erratic breathing as a few tears fell unbidden from his eyes. He heard Sam moving slowly towards him and he looked over and met his brother’s gaze, which was creased in worry, and no wonder since apparently Dean was falling apart right before his eyes.
"The club goes to its gigs on a bus, and in the case files it says…" he dug through the pile of empty take out containers and garbage on the table to fish out the copies of the police report from the crime scene. "A witness saw the same bus leaving the biker bar not long before the bodies were found."
He was tired of this town when everyone knew him and so everyone knew what had happened to him and they all
It was almost a challenge, Dean thought, to get Dean to spill the story so he could prove them wrong, and it was almost working. And yet Dean couldn't help picturing the look of disgust in his brother's eyes that he knew he would see there when Sam finally learned that Dean wasn't an innocent victim. That he had, in fact, deserved everything he had got.
Those blue eyes with as much love in them as his own. Maybe even more. Someone so ancient, so massive, even in a human body, and in love with him. It could have been frightening, but it wasn't. It was different, they were still different species even with how human Cas was now, but Dean understood what it was from where he could see it. He loved Cas, and Cas loved him. And he wanted to be loved. That was it.
"Recharging you." It seemed obvious. He could feel Dean getting hard against his ass, enough to slide back and push his cock back inside him again in one smooth stroke. The fullness of Dean's cock filling him up made pleasure shoot up his spine. His own cock was aching but it hardly registered. Cas didn't need to come to do this, just needed Dean to come and come until it stuck, until it worked. What did Dean like, what would encourage him in their mating, encourage him to stay hard and wanting in his ass? He thought of porn, of women with lewd words. Filth that had seemed ridiculous then, that made him shudder now on Dean's dick before he even got the words out in a shameless rush.
Dean's eyes shut and he let his head fall with a thump against the back of the couch. Fuck. There was squeaking from next to his head that made him open his eyes again. A guinea pig. It looked like the first one who'd arrived, accidentally fallen from its enrichment, friends, the angel who loved them, into his house. The irony hit him. It hadn't been enough for him to just make Cas fall, he'd made his guinea pigs fall too.
"Jeez, thanks. Glad to hear I rank higher than a guinea pig." He knew it was special for Cas to bring him here. He wouldn't have offered to anyone else, allowed them to see his favorite escape from heavenly crap. It made him feel fond, made him ridiculously, stupidly mushy in a way that he would have taunted if someone else dared to act it out in front of him (okay, if Sam did). He propped himself up on his left elbow, leaned over to kiss Cas and finally got him to open his eyes again too. Even here, with the different colors of this dimension, they were the same electric blue he'd know anywhere. From the day he first saw Cas in his vessel, maybe even before that. He felt like he'd seen the same blue when Cas had pulled him out of hell without one.
"Every damn angel knew about," he gestured at the cracks, couldn't say exactly what they meant. "Doesn't that annoy you at all?"
"This is how angels see grace?" Cas was silent. "Is this normal?" Cas stayed silent and looked away, like Dean was blinding him, like it was Dean's fault that he was glowing like a lamp. "If you've been doing weird angel shit to me, I need to know. You can't just do that to me and then pretend you didn't. What the fuck, man, it's not right." Cas' eyes snapped back to him, irritation clear in them. Dean was asking questions he didn't want to answer. Dean refused to back down. "Tell me."
Dean grabbed it, squeezed the soap tight in his palm, and looked down. It took him a moment to register the golden glow he saw as he did.
There was another sigh, deep above him, and then Dean's hands were on him. Pulling at his buttons, undoing his shirt for him, fast and efficient hands pulling his clothes off him, stripping Cas. Every brush of Dean's hand against his skin sent lust crashing through him. By the time Dean got him naked, pulling down his boxers, exposing just how hard and ready the jut of his cock was, the need was physically burning him. He needed Dean's cock inside him. He needed, desperately, more than anything, his dick nestled deep in this body and filling him up. He was too desperate to play nice, to remember his strength and not shove Dean onto the bed with enough force to make the twin bed creak in protest.
"I'm not saying that." Man, Sam could be such a buzz kill. Dean pushed his chair back and ignored the barrage of shuffling and squeaking it caused. Guinea pigs didn't have a heaven, he was ninety nine percent sure of that, but perhaps there was some other divine intervention involved.
"Nope. If we're fixing this, we're doing it together so you don't screw it up." Cas looked at him like he was being particularly dense, and just a little hurt by the implication he couldn't fix it.
"You. I want you. I want you so badly, Dean. I want you to be the one who gets me pregnant." Dean exhaled, dropped his arms from their defensive position, crossed over his chest, to approach the bed. Cas reached, pulled Dean down on top of him with all his strength without waiting. Dean was squashing him. The weight felt perfect on top of him, drawing a groan as his cock slid against Dean's skin, thrusted up and rutted against his hip. Dean pushed back, Cas chasing air with his hips before Dean pinned him down and pulled his legs back around him again.
Dean sighed, and pulled the angel in. He might not be a huge fan of the guy's family, but he could understand where Cas was coming from.
Dean and Cas continued to grow closer and, as Castiel became more involved in the business end of the roadhouse, Jo was beginning to consider going back to school the coming fall, even registering for some classes at the local Community College starting in the New Year. Sam called often from Stanford with Sarah constantly butting in to update the two men on how the wedding arrangements were coming along which Dean always pretended to be annoyed and exasperated by and which Cas always listened to with rapt attention; behaviour which Dean was never quite sure was genuine or not.
"How did you know?" Castiel spoke up staring inquisitively at the former demon. The rest of the group turned at the question and Crowley noted Dean's grip tightening around his gun as he brought it into a low ready position.
“Sometimes.” He shifted to lean against the bannister, perching on it and looking out at the sea of junkers that littered the lot, “Sometimes I’m worried that I’m moving too fast. I’ve been with Dean over two months now and yet it hasn’t even been a year since I lost my wife and child.” He looked up at her with concerned blue eyes, “Does that make me a bad person? Am I forgetting about them too quickly? Have I moved on too quickly?”
Dean looked up at his brother and then over at Cas, gauging the fear he saw in their eyes. Fear for him. He could feel sadness and love and protectiveness seeping in from the angel and he desperately wanted to open himself up to it. It was heaven basking in those emotions, but what if they went away? What if after he told them, Cas didn't feel that way about him? Sure Cas had promised to always love him, to always be there for him, but he didn't know the whole story.
"What? What the hell are you talking about? Hey," he stormed over to the dejected man, grabbing him by the shoulders and spinning him around to face Dean, "You are not useless you hear? So you don't have your mojo anymore so what? I'm human, Sam's human."
"Yes." Cas answered, "I do not know if he is telling the truth or a lie but regardless, many angels have been killed."
And then Ellen and Jo and Bobby and Lisa and Ben and so many others had left too, and Dean tried everything he could to numb the pain of loss.
"If you're really not ready, that's fine. I'll respect that. But don't think for one second that I wouldn't want you because you're a little bit broken. I don't care. I like who you are now."
Dean deliberated before coming to a decision. He'd already barreled past the point of no return last night when he'd dragged the man back here and given him his spare bed, may as well go the whole hog.
"Yes. But we must go. Malachi is bound to come back sooner or later, and there are other angels here who deserve to be freed."
Dean's green eyes rose to meet Bobby's and Bobby was shocked at the depth of pain he saw in them. The shoulder on which his hand rested was rising and falling with Dean's rapidly increasing breaths.
"Oh, okay." Castiel nodded, lowering his hands and watching in fascination as Dean filled the car with gas, before following him into the store and over to the coffee urns.
Dean licked crumbs off his finger as he finished assembling the sandwich and turned to his brother, one eyebrow raised.
"Look Cas and I…we're just good friends alright? Yeah, maybe I have some…feelings for the guy but that doesn't mean he has the same feelings for me."
Jimmy looked around. A security guard was standing above him. He needed to vacate the room. He stood and moved wraith-like, as though in a dream through the marble corridors of the county courthouse and out into the warm August sun. The sky was blue and the sun was shining. The trees were green. He could hear birds singing and children playing. And he felt so detached from it all. As though his heart had had enough of feeling and shut off.
"The case took seven months to go to trial. Seven months of waking up every morning with the prospect of having to face another day without them. And sometimes, in that time between sleeping and waking, just for a moment, you don't remember. You don't remember what happened, you don't remember who you lost, and everything is fine. And then it hits you, the memory and it's like…it's like it's happened all over again; the pain, the loss, the grief. It all comes flooding back and you feel like you're drowning in it. And you honestly can't imagine a scenario in which you could ever be happy again. Seven months of pitying looks. Of people tiptoeing around you like you're a bomb set to go off. Spouting out comforting words and empty platitudes that mean nothing.
Cas wasn’t pretending or ignoring him or playing a joke on him – not that Dean thought any of those scenarios was the least bit likely – he truly didn’t remember anything.
Bonny did turn out to be Vesta, and after tailing her to the site where she had imprisoned her victims, Sam sprung the trap on her, which overall could have gone better as Jody would comment later at the ER as she had the hole in her shoulder patched and a sling fitted.
They could hear a woman a few rows in front of them praying for someone named Mike before standing and moving to exit the church.
He bowed his head, laying it down to rest against Cas' chest as Cas leaned back against the pillows, wrapping his arms and wings around Dean as he shrunk into a foetal position, crowding in close, as though, if he made himself small enough, he could crawl inside Cas. Cas held onto him tight.
Once Castiel's sobs had ceased and the shaking subsided, Dean pulled back to see confused blue eyes staring up at him.
Dean fidgeted with the rewind and fast forward buttons for a few more seconds until he landed where he wanted. A slow, easy guitar lilted out from the speakers, and he turned around to look at Castiel. “So,” he said, and rubbed the back of his neck, cheeks coloring.
“And Michael was my choice, but you still came for me,” said Dean. “Because that’s what we do, Cas. That’s what family does: we save each other. Or we die trying. You don’t get to give up, because I can’t—” Dean paused and sucked in a breath, then folded. “Because I’m lost without you. I was
we’re talking about. If either of us ever stood a chance of making a life with anybody, it’s with somebody like him. Somebody who can hold their own.”
“—but you are still him at your core. His essence—tasks and orders, duty…” Michael waved his hand flippantly. “My Castiel wouldn’t have appreciated this like we do. He’d have wanted to burn it to cinders.”
“My time with the humans reminded me of our task,” Castiel countered, strain edging back into his voice. He forced himself to look away from the beauty of the valley and meet Michael’s gaze.
Dean’s heart stuttered in his chest but he backed up and did as he was told, moving the blanket to brace his hands on the cold floor for a better grip. Almost instantly, Castiel was there, a hand on Dean’s hip, the other lining up Castiel’s spit-soaked erection with his entrance.
” Dean shouted. He swung his legs over the side of the cot and glared at the metal table next to it, laden with sedatives and syringes. “Were you keeping me under?”
Dean nodded, and Sam clapped Jack gently on the shoulder. Dean could hear him giving coffee instructions as they turned down the hall, and slowly, their voices disappeared. Once he was sure he was alone, he leaned further over Castiel to stretch his arms around from behind to fold his fingers across Castiel’s chest. Dean shivered again and dropped his forehead to Castiel’s hair. “You’re gonna be fine, Cas,” he mumbled into it. “Everything’s gonna be fine.” He sat like this for a moment, face buried in Castiel’s hair, before he carefully stood to lean over him and press a slow, halting upside-down kiss to Castiel’s slack, too-warm mouth. Dean lingered like this for a moment before sinking back down and reaching for the thermometer and placing it gently beneath Castiel’s tongue. He held it there for a few minutes, keeping Castiel afloat with one arm, before checking it. One-hundred and sixteen.
“But that’s great!” said Jack, stepping forward into the library and beaming again. He looked between Dean and Castiel, considering them a moment before he asked, genuinely, “Are you going to get married?”
Jack grinned as he emerged, traipsing happily over to where Sam stood beside the table. “What do you think?” He asked cheerily, starting to deposit flowers and leaves into the vessels.
“We could’ve used you the last six months,” Castiel grumbled, stashing his blade in his coat. He reached out to push Jack’s hand gently down as well.
Dean began backing slowly into the hallway. He put his hand on his hip and hoped, somehow, he’d find the comfort of his gun, but of course he didn’t—never wore it in the bunker. Sam and Cas kept talking to each other, and when Cas reached out for him, Dean turned on a heel and ran his hardest for his room. He burst through the door and slammed it behind him, locking himself in.
“I was trying to be delicate,” Castiel admitted, sighing. He spared a glance to the cashier and leaned in towards Dean, lowering his voice. “Sam thinks they cause you undue flatulence, which, of course, doesn’t bother me, as my senses are—”
“This is amazing,” said Sam, running a hand through his hair. “I just found our angle for getting in on this new case I caught.”
“Come on, Sammy, what’s the big deal?” asked Dean, waving him off. “So you like her. It’s not like—”
“Then you gotta tell me why you’re so calm about this,” said Dean, his voice cracking a little, though his cheeks and eyes stayed dry, if red. “Why it doesn’t seem like you’re fighting. Because man, I’m punching this with everything I got, but it’s like hitting a wall if you aren’t punching too.”
“Awesome,” Dean blurted, and suddenly he was barreling across the open floor towards his brother. Castiel only missed half a beat, and then he followed, moving in on his spellbound, winged kin.
“I know,” said Castiel a third time. He crossed the kitchen to Dean and pulled him into his arms. Dean wrapped his arms back around Castiel and buried his face in his lover’s neck, breathing him in, fingers twisting the back of Castiel’s shirt. “But this is real. It’s the realest thing I’ve ever known. I’ve never been so certain of anything.”
“The original spell,” Sam clarified awkwardly. “It’s a last resort, but we do have archangel grace, and Rowena has the other ingredients.”
“Then I am false,” said Castiel, turning his gaze briefly to the sky, a prayer to his Father. “And perhaps I am damned, because I feel no guilt.” He blew out a breath through his nose and looked back to Dean, smaller now further out. If he focused hard, he could pick up Dean’s steady heartbeat, and Castiel tried to hold on to that as he broke his gaze away from his lover to start digging into the duffel bag behind him.
He slipped out of Dean’s long-since-borrowed jeans, then into his tennis shoes, and went for his daily run through the forest in Dean’s boxers and Zeppelin tee. It was Spring in Eden, or so Castiel believed—but it was hard to tell. The weather here was always lovely—the rain mild, the nights comfortably cool, the days pleasantly warm. He ran until he was tired, then stripped out of his shirt and used it as a makeshift bag as he foraged for whatever food he could find—edible roots, fruits and berries, anything that resembled a vegetable. When it was full, he made his way back to his tree, collected his jeans, and wandered to the river, where he scrubbed himself, his clothes, and his produce haul.
The rain-soaked cloth was stubborn, and Dean sat back just long enough to let Castiel lift his hips from the seat so he could jerk his jeans down, boxers and all. He shuffled out of his own boxers while he was up, then leaned back down, grinding against Castiel as he did, pulling a low sound from his throat. “How far do you wanna go?” he whispered against Castiel’s lips.
“Ready…” Rowena murmured, poising her fingers around the edges of the ball of smoke. “And…now.” Castiel inhaled deep and slow, and Rowena murmured one more foreign word as she stretched out her hands, forming the smoke from a ball into a thick, red rope that wound its way down Castiel’s throat.
“Okay,” repeated Castiel. He stared at Dean for a few seconds, unblinkingly, and then asked, “What now?”
Castiel smiled at the jab to his side and went to collect the lime wedges, but then lowered his brows. “You think I’m excitable?”
“You’re family,” said Sam in answer, and he clapped Castiel gently on the shoulder before disappearing into the hall.
Jack looked from Sam to Dean, and then to Castiel, who encouraged him gently, “Go ahead, Jack. We meant to stop on the way and got distracted. We won’t be long.”
Instead of stopping, though, Cas was encouraged. He gripped Dean by the hips and took him into his mouth, and Dean nearly managed to ignore the nag. His back arched and he moaned low in his throat, his hand tightening in Cas’s hair. “Sh—damnit,” he sighed in pleasure, letting Cas go on for a moment before the doubt itching in his brain bit harder. “Mmm—damnit,” he said louder, and then, “Stop. Cas—stop. Please stop?”
When he woke early the next morning after too few hours, he found himself tucked snugly beneath a blanket, the recliner’s legs having been lifted sometime in the night to let him lie back. On the table beside him, stuck beneath his empty beer bottle, was a note:
Sam and Jack were silent for a few beats, considering, and finally Sam said with a little chuckle, “…yeah. Fair point.”
“He should be back by now,” grumbled Sam as he scrolled through the contacts, then lifted the phone to his ear. “It’s almost seven.”
“Cas,” said Dean, cutting him off. “This is great. I just don’t want to stay that long, you know? Not ready to be away for a while yet.” He took Castiel’s hand and settled beside him.
“I tried. You were hurting yourself,” Sam said, and sighed. “Or trying to whenever you weren’t under.”
Dean, Castiel, and Claire met up with Sam at the crime scene, all in Fed suits but Claire. For the fake family, the ride there was tense, with Dean and Cas sniping at each other in the front seat the whole way.
” said Rowena. She gave her hair a dramatic toss. “I was beginning to think you’d forgotten who I was.”
Castiel smiled reassuringly. “Neither do I,” he said, though he wasn’t sure himself. “But the Empty isn’t something to fear, either. It’s just like being asleep without dreams. No sense of time or place. It’s—well, it was terrifying to wake up there, but I don’t think it’s normal to wake up.”
Castiel stood and dusted himself off, disgruntled. He concentrated hard, and his borrowed wings worked again long enough to meet the others, but it left him afraid to use them for the rest of the hunt, and after promising Dean to explain when they got home, they spent the rest of the hunt slogging after the Wendigos on foot.
Before Dean could think, he heard the tell-tale click of a pistol’s hammer, and within a split second, a gun was pressed to Castiel’s temple. “NO!” He roared. Michael smiled. Dean locked eyes with Castiel, pounded against the barrier. The mist obscured his lover’s face completely, and the last sound Dean heard before the spell dissolved was the sound of a gun.
“That’s not what I mean,” sighed Sam. He rubbed his hand over his face and leaned back tiredly in the chair. “Cas, look—we heard what Michael said, about what you saw. And it’s not like—it’s not like you two hide it well anyway.”
“Yeah, ‘course,” said Dean, knee-jerk. He started for the door again but faltered. In his chest, a warmth wrapped itself around his heart, squeezing uncharacteristically soft words up to his lips. He shifted to face Castiel again before he could talk himself out of the vulnerability and looked him in the eye. “I’ll always take care of you.” Castiel was quiet, staring intently back at Dean, and Dean felt suddenly too exposed and raw. “Starting with lunch,” he said, defusing the tension. “C’mon, sunshine.”
“Then why weren’t you here hours ago?” Dean countered. He balled his fists, only then realizing he was still holding his bottle of beer.
“Yeah,” said Dean. He looked to Castiel and continued, “Sorry, buddy,” before scooting his arms beneath the unconscious man and gently lifting him to a seat.
Castiel watched him for a moment, smiling, and then glanced up at the stars. “Sun’ll be up in a few hours. There’s something I want to do, before that.”
Dean gave a shuddering intake of breath, but nodded, and Castiel returned the gesture. He pressed his forehead to Dean’s and wound his hand to the small of his back, urging him close while the other hand pressed down against his shoulder, signaling him to sit. Dean obliged and Castiel went down with him, pushing him gently back into the grass and straddling him.
“Mmm,” Dean hummed into Castiel’s neck. Castiel slipped one hand up into the back of Dean’s hair and took a slow, deep breath, savoring the moment. After some time, Castiel murmured something in Enochian softly into Dean’s temple, then kissed him there.
Jack slid off the hood of the car. “Then let’s go home and tell Dean,” he said, simply, as if it was the easiest thing in the world.
Dean took the book and squinted at the drawing. “Who?” he asked, and Sam again tapped the page. “Dude, just tell me. I’m not reading what took you a week to figure out.”
Castiel leaned forward and joined Dean beneath the water, claiming his lips in a warm, wet kiss. Dean laughed through his nose a little and returned it, reaching to press a hand to the small of Castiel’s back, drawing him closer.
“The stack furthest to the right,” said Castiel, opening his eyes again. “I haven’t read through it yet.”
Dean?” said Castiel, rising again to pace across the room. He put his hands on the table and leaned over, sighing. When he spoke again, his voice was calm, soft. Pained. “Then why can’t it—why can’t we be like that?”
Dean stared into Castiel’s eyes for a long, silent moment, and finally he nodded. “Okay,” he said simply.
There was no answer, so he banged again, and then Jack appeared around the corner. “The…power,” Sam muttered, trying to save it, but Jack was unmoved.
Castiel looked up from Dean’s heart and met his wide gaze with an electric intensity. He let out a breath as if he’d been holding it, and said, almost a whisper, “Turn away your eyes from me, for they overwhelm me…” He pulled his hand up from Dean’s chest to thumb across his cheek. “Who is this who looks down like the dawn, beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun?”
“There’s only two bedrooms?” Dean said, wheeling around to gawk at Claire, who nodded. “We are not sharing a bed,” he pointed at Castiel.
“I bet he’d say the same thing about you,” countered Sam. He ran a hand back through his hair. “Listen, I know the self-loathing is just sort of what we do, but you gotta give yourself a break sometimes, Dean. You’ve always done the best you could. We all have.”
“It’s nothing, Cas,” Dean signed, smiling weakly. He sucked in a breath, though, and steeled himself. “Look, man, I know I’m hard on you. It’s not fair, I know it. Sometimes I get so wrapped up in this,” he gestured to himself vaguely, “I forget you’ve been through hell too. It’s not cool.”
“Because for the moment, you’re no good to me slow or dead,” said Michael, the eerie calm seeping back into his borrowed voice. “If you hadn’t noticed, I’m a little drained, and I’m not wasting precious time or energy dragging your broken body around.” He sniffed and shrugged as he moved to step beyond the treeline. “As for here? Why here? I wanted you to see it. There are so few angels left in your world to truly appreciate our father’s creation. So call it selfishness; I wanted you to see it, in all its glory.”
Dean kicked his jeans aside and while Castiel was still fidgeting with his own jeans, hooked a finger into the waistband of Castiel’s boxers and pulled them down in one quick jerk. He leaned forward to kiss Castiel hard as he took his erection in his hand, and Castiel arched into the touch, unintentionally breaking the kiss as his mouth opened in a loud, uninhibited, filthy-sounding groan that sent Dean reeling. He bent forward with Castiel to try to swallow the sound as he stroked him again, slowly, harder.
“Is he breathing?” Sam huffed as he pulled up beside Dean, leaning against the door to peer in, but Dean didn’t answer. “Dean!” Sam yelled and shook him by the shoulder. “Snap out of it!”
“I don’t like—this is ridiculous,” said Dean, reaching out to snag a book. “Let’s just finish this case, alright?”
“Something like that,” he answered, working his jaw. He looked up as footfalls sounded on the stairs and smiled without meaning to when Dean and Castiel appeared, shoulder to shoulder.
“Whatever,” Dean said, making a stink face at the girl as she snagged a beer and turned for the stairs.
“He recoils if I try,” said Cas. “He’s not convinced I’m real. He thinks…” Cas sighed and looked toward the ceiling, but closed his eyes, letting his shoulders droop.
” said Dean, rounding on his brother and slamming the fridge door, arms laden with hamburger meat. “I’m good—like,
“Child’s play, Samuel,” trilled Rowena. She crossed the room to gather her bag. “This spell works inside the mind. Jack’ll be able to see what Michael sees, give us his every move down to the inch until the holy oil’s lit.”
“Seems fine for now,” said Dean, closing the laptop and sitting up. “Except for the whole, y’know. Sleep thing.”
“Stop it,” said Cas, shaking his head at Jack. “You’re not useless. I won’t sacrifice you. Or Sam. Michael is my brother, and that makes him my responsibility.”
Castiel stood there a moment longer to get his bearings. He closed his eyes and focused hard on the silence. He’d just made up his mind to check the kitchen for Dean when he heard the faintest sound of music drifting down the hallway from the direction of Dean’s room.
Castiel grinned a little and snagged two bottles from the fridge and an opener, and slid into the seat across from Sam. He opened one and passed it to Sam, then opened his own. “Where’s Jack?”
The closest liquor store was a good fifteen-minute drive with no traffic—not that there ever was any, even now at half-past five—and Dean took his time, enjoying the early October breeze with his windows down. Driving had always been his solace, his way to think through things, good or bad. In the calm of the cool, early evening, not quite sunset yet but no longer afternoon, it was easy to forget that there were monsters or angels or even death.
Castiel looked at Dean’s open palm, then up to his lover’s eyes. He took DI ean’s hand and stood, smiling and dipping his chin a few times in a small nod. “I’d like that,” he said.
“Cas!” Dean finally scrambled to his feet and launched himself toward Castiel, who jerked his gaze back to Dean and ran at him. They crashed into each other so hard it hurt, a tangle of arms and hands desperate to pull the other impossibly closer. Dean’s fingernails clawed into the skin of Castiel’s back and a strangled sound, something between a sob and a laugh, pushed past his lips. “You're alive! I’m here,” he whispered into Castiel’s neck, the angel’s face buried in his shoulder. “We found you. You're alive. We found you,” he said, over and over, not quite certain who he was trying to convince. “I found you. You're alive. I’m here.”
“I know, I know,” Castiel soothed, leaning his forehead back against the strange window. “He can’t kill me if he wants his grace back. He knows that. I’m collateral.”
Dean blew out a long breath through his nose and listened for a moment, then sang along as he rounded a sharp curve, tires squealing, voice lost to the bluesy guitar and Robert Plant’s loud crooning. “But baby, since I’ve been loving you, yeah, I’m about to lose my worried mind.”
“Yeah. Look, man, I’m gonna hit the sack. We’ve got a long day of research tomorrow,” said Dean, rising and stretching.
“Aye, he will be,” said Rowena. She’d had her hand on his forehead, which she now removed. “When he wakes he’ll feel like he’s got the worst hangover of his young life, but he will wake up.”
“C’mon,” he said, pulling back and taking Castiel’s free hand. He started to step toward the bedroom, but Castiel resisted. Dean arched his brows.
Castiel stared at Dean for a few moments and his smile slipped away, expression turning soft, and almost sad. Without speaking, he sat up on his knees and crawled the few inches over to Dean, who watched him, startled. Castiel seated himself carefully in Dean’s lap, hugging a knee to each side, and wrapped him in a tight, borderline childlike hug, as if he was trying to absorb Dean into his body, make sure they were connected at the chest. He dropped his head, burying his face in Dean’s shoulder.
Castiel shook his head gently. “Tomorrow,” he said, and for a moment they fell into silence, happy to listen to the soft sounds of each other’s breathing. “How are you feeling?” he asked after a time.
Dean pulled his almost-empty mug to his chest and secretly reveled in the comforting warmth it sent through his sternum. “Okay,” he said, nodding. “I’m gonna…I don’t know. Go for a drive.”
I lower my hand and nod to the taller Winchester. "Of course, Sam," I answer more softly. "Will you be alright?"
“Yeah,” Dean finally conceded. He sank to his knees with a sigh, carefully keeping Castiel’s head above water. “Hey Jack,” he called over, finally calmer. “There a thermometer in the kit?”
They finally all piled into the car after a brief argument. Sam insisted on driving with Castiel as his halfway point relief, as they were the ones who seemed the most okay. Dean finally conceded unhappily on the condition that he still sat in the front seat.
Dean whipped around to see Castiel letting his head fall back and his eyes close, fists loosening. “I think the pills are working,” said the angel, almost slurring.
“You’re brilliant,” said Jack, eyes and face lit up with an amazed grin. Sam smirked, but Castiel just rolled his eyes.
“What are you saying?” said Dean. His voice cracked, and he locked eyes with Cas, who just barely shook his head. Even from the distance, Dean could see his blue eyes beginning to sparkle with tears.
Dean considered for a moment, worrying his bottom lip. He reached over to his phone on the coffee table, checking the time. Nearly ten PM; earlier than he’d usually go to sleep, but hell, it had been a rough week.
Dean looked from the ring up to Castiel, eyes wide, and then back down. “That’s the—cracks, or whatever? Your grace?”
Slowly, Castiel’s senses returned, and he found himself—or rather, a projection of himself—in the entryway of the bunker. It felt so real he had flashbacks of his own time holed away in this corner of the mind while he’d been possessed by Lucifer, but this was somehow even more intense, more
“Rowena?” huffed Dean. When she turned, he cleared his throat. “Stay out of trouble. And—thank you.”
“I think—” Cas tried again, broken up by a moan of pleasure. “I—” he started over, but Dean claimed his lips, rolling once more, and Cas groaned into them. He arched again, and Dean broke the kiss once more to nibble at his ear. “I think—” he tried one more time, and then he went still beneath Dean. Lifeless.
“Here,” said Castiel. He crossed the room quickly and disappeared into the bathroom a moment, then returned with a paper cup full of lukewarm water.
“Mmm,” Dean laughed a little, falling forward to rest his elbows on his knees and his forehead against his fists, back arching into the scratch. “What else?”
Castiel was halfway down the dark hall, t-shirt still in hand. Dean had to jog a few steps to catch up, and when he did he gripped Castiel’s shoulder, forcing him to turn around. “Cas, talk to me,” he said softly, pressing his lover’s back gently into the wall to make him stop.
“Anytime,” nodded Sam. He reached out and clapped Castiel on the shoulder as he passed, reassuring. “He’ll be fine. Don’t sweat it.”
When it isn’t a date—when it’s babysitting, and even that goes wrong, and he has to admit his failure, he doesn’t bother trying to hide his shame. Dean can sense it. Says Cas must be hungry—takes him to a bar instead. But Cas has to work in the morning. Cas has to be the responsible one. So Dean gets drunk while Cas finds them a hotel, wrangles away the keys to the Impala, drives them to their room.
came Jack’s reply. “Great,” muttered Sam. He grabbed a vial of blue grace, sighed, and trudged to the backyard hoping he wouldn’t find what he was expecting. He swung open the door and groaned when he found exactly that:
“I don’t,” Michael’s voice repeated. “But like I said, you do. So give me what I want, or I take what you need, and then I take you anyway.”
Dean cleared his own throat and stepped forward, holding out a hand palm up to Castiel. “I—can’t believe I’m gonna say this, because it’s so corny, but…can I uhh. Have this dance?”
“Claire’s years older than you were when you started hunting,” Castiel reminded Dean flatly. “And that’s not why you want to go.”
“No,” Castiel grimly agreed. “I’ll basically be punching my way into Dean’s mind by putting his body—controlled by Michael—under.” He wrung his hands. “Dean’ll be beat up afterwards. But at least he won’t be dead.”
“Dean!” Castiel yelled again, and he took a breath to shout once more, but faltered when Sam’s voice rang, oddly, through the roar of the flames.
Dean snorted and rolled onto his side to prop his head in his hand and watch Cas. “Not all of us come standard with Angel Radio.”
let me finish this, Dean Winchester,” Castiel roared. Light began to emanate from his eyes. “When I got back, when I saw you standing under that neon cross, the look on your face—I was sure you would say it then. I was so sure. But you didn’t.”
"I'm fine. It's just the heat, don't stop." His hands tightened on Dean's back again, focused on Dean above him, on Dean's cock inside him. Had it already happened? He shouldn't be able to think that clearly in heat, not like that. Did he already conceive?
He reached over and picked the guinea pig up, gently enough to stop it from squeaking in protest. Putting it down on his lap, it settled down, nose wiggling, whiskers quivering as Dean stroked it. Despite how sick he was of looking after them, despite the lead weight in his stomach from screwing up with Cas, again, it felt kinda nice to have the guinea pig on his lap, enjoying his company. It made him feel like he wasn't a complete failure, could at least make a guinea pig happy even if he couldn't do it for anyone else.
"You can't be serious." If he could think, he might be pleased to be considered capable of joking. In Cas' current state, all he could think was more, fuck, needed more, still wasn't enough, more. His vessel still shuddered from the aftermath of his orgasm but he needed more.
"When did they start?" Cas looked up from against Dean's jaw, and his fingers brushed against his neck as he shifted to look at Dean.
"Aw Cas, c'mon, it's not a burden." The words he wanted to say next stuck in his throat. Even now, with Cas this close, resting on top of him and looking at Dean like the sun shone out of his ass (ironic that was one of the few parts of him that wasn't shining), he couldn't get it out. Fuck. Years of squashing it down, repressing it from fear he'd denied for so long, and now he still couldn't get it out.
Dean protested too, a winded groan that Cas barely heard as he pushed Dean up against the headboard, right where he needed him before he clumsily, with trembling thighs, mounted Dean. The wet slide of Dean's cock against his ass drew a little huff, not enough but a start as it dragged between his cheeks with a shift of his hips. Dean, somehow, was still wearing more clothes than him. He gave the tee under his flannel a glare, offended that it was hiding Dean from him, before he grabbed it, hiked it up to expose his chest. The line of his hips, a couple of freckles doted on heated skin. One little freckle, all alone, right next to his nipple. Oh. Cas grabbed onto his waist, needed to touch Dean, keep him exactly where he was as he raised his hips. The nudge of Dean's cock against his hole made him groan, push down on it and let it catch on his rim.
"You can't. I'll fix it." Dean shook his head as he got up. He didn't trust Cas to go off and fix things on his own without making a hash of it. Didn't have a great track record with that. It might only be guinea pigs, but Cas might end up making them rain from the sky or something.
"Yes, it is how angels can see grace in humans. No, it is not normal for a human to glow from being healed by an angel like you do." It wasn't much. There was so much about Dean that was so far from normal that what was this but one more weird thing about him. Except...
talking about it again, capiche?" The tremor of relief at Dean's agreement shook his body, washed over him like a wave.
"Yeah I know that, genius. I mean what's it doing in my house?" Sam pushed himself back into his chair, shrugged as he picked up his fork again.
Cas had never done this like a human before. Of course he'd bred as an angel before, felt a heat before but riding Dean, feeling the catch of the head of his cock inside him, was different. There was no stretching of time and space. No spanning the galaxy as two graces merged, probing each other, exploring every nook of him, as deep and intimate as anything an angel could experience. No, it was just Dean nestled inside him, cock throbbing, eyes watching him through fluttering eyelashes like he'd never seen Cas before in his life. It was so close, so small and so human. It was a tiny gesture in a huge galaxy, and Cas wanted it so badly he would die if anything stopped them now.
"Your office is over my house? What the fuck, man? You couldn't even be bothered to call me when your office is over my goddamn house and you decided to - breed guinea pigs instead?" Dean gestured angrily at the guinea pigs surrounding them, who were content to ignore him unlike the angel responsible for them. Cas looked guilty, which he refused to feel bad about in the slightest. Cas should feel guilty for ignoring him. For not listening when he poured his heart out to him via angel radio after he'd had a little too much to drink, when he aired out that even in the place where he was supposed to have everything, there was something missing. Someone missing.
All the lights shattered at once. Too much Dean and coming and Dean coming inside him again, to the chorus of shattering glass around them, to hold back the pulse of energy surging through him as he came in Dean's hand. His come spurting over his fist, Dean rubbing his come back over his cock to slide against his palm as he came. Kept riding Dean through it, through the burst of light behind his eyes, like he was being blinded by the lights that he'd just destroyed around them, until Dean pulled back with a hiss. Cas blinked, dazed, needed more, reached out to touch Dean and fill him with his grace to go again. For a moment he saw his own daze mirrored on Dean's face, before it switched to exasperation as he started to get hard again.
"I love you." It didn't come out easily, but Cas needed to hear it. Deserved to hear it. He saw Cas soften around the edges before he leaned in and kissed Dean. It felt right. Cas pulled back, gave a look to the guinea pig, then to Dean, like he was torn. "You should take him home."
No, he was not jealous, even as Sam gave him a look that disbelievingly asked, 'are you seriously jealous of a guinea pig?'. Dean scowled in an attempt to get Sam to stop.
It looked cool. The door didn't need that much force to open it, in fact a small breeze might have done it, but it made an awesome entrance into the room. The Winchester brothers, challenging heaven once again as they stormed into the room and found the guinea pig.
He didn't actually need to breathe now, but it was reflexive. The way his breath stuck in his chest didn't hurt, not really, but he could still feel it, still felt like it would have hurt once as their eyes met. Cas looked surprised. Dean wasn't sure what he looked like. He hoped he didn't look like how he felt about Cas ditching him.
