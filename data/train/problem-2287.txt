During the London Blitz, many tube stations in the city became air-raid shelters. Among this period, Sherlock was forced to hide in a station in the vicinity of the university, together with a crowd of professors, students and other citizens, waiting for revocation of the air raid siren, but the day seemed never come, did not know when the classes could get back to normal. There were an old professor intended to continue his class in the air-raid shelter, to avoid students abandoned school too long, but while most students were anxious and worried they were hard to concentrate on learning, and finally left only Sherlock still asking questions and demanded to do experiments, made the old professor eventually decided to give up.
"Now she's going to compensate, Sherlock," Mycroft frowned, "She will arrive the day after tomorrow, and will take you back to England when your semester ends."
"I haven’t prepared any gift." Sherlock stared at him, was at a loss.
Mrs Holmes was so happy to see her and hold her hand friendly, "Miss Adler, are you dating Mycroft?"
Sherlock sat in the car silently. On the road, silence spread. Their hands were both on the seat, their little fingers barely touched by accident, they moved their hands rapidly to avoid the touch, and looked out the window pretending to admire the scenery, made their distance even bigger.
Sherlock's chest panting against John, they twisted together paralysed, just kept heavy breathing. Sherlock could not see John's expression as he was clinging on Sherlock, he could only close his eyes and had one thought: it was over.
Sherlock could hear the noise implying he was lying down.
"No," Sherlock stopped him. "It's ok."
"Sherlock!" be slapped across the face, Sherlock forced himself to open his eyes, he had injected heroin and slept past in a dirty lane next to trash cans.
"Thanks." Lestrade left.
The water level stopped rising and the flooding calmed down. Some debris floating around, while the machines and furniture were submerged in the water.
Although while seeing someone else - specifically, a woman - lying on his and John's bed, Sherlock was really upsetting.
#              #              #
Sherlock hugged him and observed his reaction in case the nightmare recurred. But John seemed to sleep well, so Sherlock followed him to fall asleep unconsciously.
"Sh~" John put his finger on his lips, said jokingly, "Don’t tell anybody." Then winked at Sherlock.
John buried his face in his own hands.
John gripped him back, just smiled. They stayed awhile, then Sherlock got up put on the dressing gown, going downstairs to change his clothes.
Sherlock laughed with Lestrade, and that was the beginning of their friendship.
Otherwise, I will never forgive you.
"Wait!" Sherlock grabbed his leg. "Interesting case?" his eyes shining brightly.
John took off the rest of his clothes and then pressed against Sherlock fiercely, let the boy’s legs separate to accommodate him. Sherlock saw the burning desire in John's eyes, feeling how hungrily he stroked his thighs, and then he stopped breathing while he felt something that came to his most intimate body part.
The earth was sloping and the world was in chaos.
John glanced at Sherlock and reluctantly smiled, "I'm still young, it’s too soon to consider marriage."
"He really demanded money so much?" Victor puzzled. "How could he do that to himself?"
John's hand was strong and warm, he lingering touched Sherlock's hand for a moment before letting go and then smiled - a smile with hunting confidence, and for the first time made people feeling dangerous of a soldier. "Could you let me send you back to school? I just have a feeling that you are not suitable for public transport. God, your look like a noble."
He knew when the war broke out in Europe, the Asian side was also been in a terrible situation at the same time, he did not know whether the war spread to Hong Kong, he did not know whether John was safe, whether John had been transferred to other place’s battlefield, he did not know anything.
I know the situation is not very optimistic.
"Don’t understand why we must get married." Sherlock frowned, really did not understand. "As I don’t understand why I must go to school, I have already learned by myself."
If the same person shot and was shot, what would it call? Suicide.
When Sherlock swearing in his mind, the black car greeted, just parked at their destination - the back door of the gate.
Sherlock tried to smile and swallowed it.
Sherlock closed his eyes and tried to relax and let John's fingers in. Under John’s gentle stroking, the uncomfortable feeling of invading was fading out. Sherlock's chest was flushed, looking at John confusingly and lustfully. John slowly stroked more fingers in, eyes were still inseparable from Sherlock, watching him twisting and panting under his massage, fascinating by his messy and sweaty curls, indulging in his swollen and moist lips as a result of his biting and sucking, that made John irresistible to kiss it again and to swallow Sherlock’s loudly moaning. John’s fingers kept pounding inside Sherlock and brushed against the spot, pleased to see Sherlock spinning out of control and groaning just for him. Sherlock stroked his erection and sounded in a hoarse voice, "Now."
"Ouch!" he cried, holding his leg and jumped back to his bed to sit down: "You came back."
Sherlock widened his innocent eyes and looked at John, seemed like still the inexperienced virgin child. He was trembling under John's invasion, heavily breathing, the whole body was on fire. John could never stop watching this Sherlock, his Sherlock, the Sherlock that only let him explore...
"Sherlock." Victor shuddered.
Sherlock smiled weakly, "It doesn’t matter, you two should have something to talk about, I'll find you later."
Lestrade held his head with frustration, looked away from Sherlock, did not response.
"Do you know that the war between China and Japan had been broken out for some time ago? The war has been spreading and may come to Hong Kong."
They missed the chance to say goodbye...
"Oh, nice one!"
"He was supposed to come with me to see you here, but he had something else to do suddenly. Maybe we can meet up tomorrow?"
"Yes, this is my room," John replied.
"Yup."
"Yes, I like this house number." Sherlock had made up his mind.
Sherlock had already deduced John's situation - if he had any relatives, why would he find a total stranger to share the flat? It could imagine that in England he had no "home" anymore - but John's indifference still surprised Sherlock. Had the affectionate, romantic, responsible John Watson been destroyed by the war?
“The Queen's English, Londoner? Your voice is very nice.” The smiling officer leaned over the railing, blowing the sea breeze with Sherlock and glancing at his school uniform. "St Stephen's College, you study in the boarding school at Stanley."
"No, you're wrong!" Sherlock had just finished the deduction in his mind and jumped out of bed right away, knelt down in front of John and forced John to face him. "I love you, I love you."
Sherlock stepped forwards curiously, stopping at the fence and staring at the man. John Watson opened the door and came out, looking at Sherlock who just bit his lips subconsciously but had not looked away from his gaze. John moved forwards and came to the other side of the fence.
Would John still remember him? - Sherlock meditated while turning the ring on his finger. This ring, always worn on his hand, was just like part of his body. Had John taken it off and replaced with Mary's wedding ring? Sherlock knew that Hong Kong had been occupied and was liberated after three years and eight months. Were the Watson family safe? World War II was over, would they back to England after that?
"At that time, the place I was stationed became a horrible battlefield where the Japanese army mistreated and murdered soldiers, civilians and medical personnel, and they did that could be just for fun. Even if had escaped from being killed, could bear the abuse, it's still hard for anyone to survive from hunger and disease. One year after being detained in a prisoner-of-war camp, not many fellow soldiers survived, it's just me in my team. Later, they brought me to the shipyard of Yokohama in Japan as a slave, I was released after the end of the war. All these years, I lost contact with the outside world, that's why everyone thought my whole team had all long died. " John memorized, although he tried his best to maintain a normal tone, his voice still helplessly trembled as if every word could still sniff the cruel bloody smell.
"Did he order you to hand over me?"
“Don’t act so shocked. It’s only chopped up lentils and rice in a slow cooker.  Hardly advanced chemistry.”
Sherlock looks almost affronted, as if John’s concession wounds his standing as a known terror.  “I play the violin at night.”
.  Sherlock takes the memory and buries it down deep.
Sherlock gaped at him. Mycroft’s knuckles whitened around his fork.  John tilted his head with a frown.  “What, you’re surprised?  That bloody ‘miss me’ video played on every screen in England.  Who except you has that kind of control?”
“Please be a client,” says John under his breath.
Mary blinked.  She’d known as much about Sherlock for some time, but Winter’s intuition surprised her.  A rabid dog doesn’t ponder the person it bites.  “Oh?”
“Hmm, yes.”  John rubs at the weariness around his eyes.  “That sounds… perfect, actually.”
As fortune would have it, a better case
Pain, sharp and sudden like a blade between his ribs, slitting a gasp from his throat.  He gulped, choked.  A tube was wedged between his teeth and down his trachea.  Blinding light flooded in as he opened his eyes and he clamped them shut, cringing against the intrusion.  Bright halos seared the backs of his eyelids.  Each failed breath dragged in a lungful of panic and
Got a patient coming in. Talk later.
“Not at all,” said Alexander.  “He’s just been listening to my case and deciding if he wants to take it on.”
Moriarty stumbled back and clutched his bleeding hand to his chest.  “You little
but…”  He trailed off, pondering, and watched the smile slip from John’s face.  “London is
Sherlock tenses as John moves his head, mashing his temple against a plush fold in the Belstaff.  “’Til the cab gets here,” he says, sleep-slurred.
“Yes.”
“Sherlock will get a lovely surprise later, if he keeps it up,” says John with levity.  “Manners are very important.  Right, Sherlock?”
seized Sherlock’s interest.  As Lucy Ferrier spoke, revealing the existence of a chilling, pseudo-religious cult that Mr. Ferrier had frequented in his youth, Sherlock and John listened, rapt.  Mr. Ferrier had joined the cult, unaware that one of its minor tenants entitled the cult leaders to take any member’s daughter as a wife.  Whether the leaders were already married or not was considered irrelevant.
John leans closer, intent on intimidation.  The effect is undercut as the motion grinds his cock harder against Sherlock’s leg, sending a delicious shiver through his frame.  Voice breathy, he says, “You planned this?”
“Hello?”
“Daddy, I’m ready,” Rosie announces, clomping down the stairs and looking terribly pleased with herself.  Another one of John’s larks Sherlock can’t condone with a clear conscience assails his eyes:  Rosie has been allowed to choose her own outfit for Honeycomb Primary School’s
“Oh, you will be.”  John steps closer, edging into Sherlock’s space.  He stops with his face tilted up, the tip of his nose just inches from Sherlock’s chin.  It would be simple, so simple, to duck his head, seal their mouths together.
they were called.  It didn’t matter how many generations had passed since a human man or woman had a misalliance with a fairy; it took only a drop of Fae blood to create the tell-tale traits.  Slightly pointed ears.  A feral energy.  Haunting beauty.  It was no great mental leap to see selkie heritage in a woman’s liquid-dark eyes and generous curves or Seelie in a man’s willowy build and angular face.  And there was a
“Don’t cry, John.  Please don’t cry.”
John gives him a playful shove.  “Cheeky.”
“John!”  Mrs. Hudson’s scandalized tone was belied by a smile.
“I—I don’t know what you’re on about,” Sherlock stammers.
“Months, certainly.  Possibly even a year.  We must also discuss pain management strategies, physiotherapy, and so forth.”
John sighs and sits up, pushing back the duvet.  “It’s nothing.  Just a nightmare.”
She closes the door behind them and takes a seat behind a desk of her own.  Opposite the desk, four chairs are lined up, backs facing the door.  Sherlock can see two figures huddled on opposite sides of the row, leaning away from each other to maximize the distance between.  As he crosses the room, Sherlock sees that one of the figures is Rosie.  She’s bent double in her seat, elbows resting on her knees, dark blonde hair hiding her face.  On the other side of the row, a girl with her dark hair tied back in braids glowers.
The next day, Sherlock bought a train ticket to Inverness.
When Sherlock speaks at last, his voice is flat.  Dead.  “You should call the police.  Let them deal with it.”
“You’re a genius,” John says.  “You figure it out.”
“Suppose I should…”
“Yes.”  The Great Tower rears high above them, old and grand.  “The Helens were children when they invented the idea of the Winter Palace – no doubt inspired by the castle that overshadowed their lives.  If Charlotte was correct in assuming that Peter has been off his meds for a long time, it would make sense for him to supplant one castle for another.”
John’s response is immediate; he’s in the queue.  Tapping his foot and chewing on his impatience as a woman fumbles with her chip-and-PIN card because he refuses to grapple with the self-checkout machines.
Sherlock laughs, startled – a snort that drops into a belly-deep guffaw. John is pulled into the riptide with him, and in no time at all they are giggling like schoolboys, tipping into outright hysterics.
The deduction is not a novel one.  Sherlock has suspected as much for years.  But with the new revelations about John, with the kiss in the stairwell and John surging hard and gasping against him, with John’s teeth at his throat and
Many things happen at once.  Rosie stamps on Catherine’s foot and Catherine gasps, more in surprise than pain.  The knife drifts away from Rosie’s face and the girl twists, wriggling free of her captor’s arms.  Rosie bolts out of Catherine’s reach, the knife dragging a deep line across her arm in Catherine’s futile struggle to snatch her back.  Behind Sherlock, Peter howls like a wounded animal, as if sensing what will happen next.
The second reason is that John and Mary were married in the summer. Sherlock keeps that reason hidden away in his Mind Palace, behind the walls of a glass greenhouse.  A golden summer day.
Sherlock was not the second-cleverest man in London for nothing, but it did take him an embarrassing amount of time to sort out the kidnappers’ destination.  Every time he tried to fixate on the clues scattered about the ransacked flat, thoughts of John would crowd into his mind.
“Mr. Holmes?” a familiar voice calls.
“The peaches Su Lin stole,” he said.  He let the sack slip from his grip to thud softly against the floor, disgorging its contents onto the cobblestones.  “Take them and go.”
“John—”
I'll be doing another double-update today, as this chapter is pretty case-fic intensive (also, I'm impatient lol).
"Mr. McFarlane," Ferguson begins, and McFarlane stiffens, knuckles white around the handle of his stein.  Ferguson's lips twist.  "Why don't you tell our friends what we learned about Jonas Oldacre."  It isn't a question, but a command.  "It's partially your story, after all."
Sherlock reaches down and tucks his hand into John’s, gripping tightly.  John glances at him and the corners of his mouth twitch up.  His hand squeezes back, threading their fingers together.
This chapter got away from me.  Tbh I'm not sure how I feel about it on the whole, but... /shrug
He swept into the sitting room, shoulders hunched to slip off the Belstaff—and stopped.  Rosamund’s baby bag sat in John’s chair, nylon handle peeping over the arm.  A corner of blanket protruded from inside the bag, meaty and pink.  The zipper was caught in the felt.
“I doubt there will be any danger at the gala,” said Sherlock.  “If Lady Smallwood is attending, Mycroft will have ensured tight security.”
“Rosie,” says Ms. Helens, “you know you oughtn’t have done that, right?  You could have really hurt Samantha.”
police,” said Sherlock.  Alexander’s eyes widened a fraction, and Sherlock, delighted, pushed his advantage.  “Your accent is native to London, true, but it has the broader inflections of years in America.  Your accent is hardly noticeable.  Dropping your t’s, dragging your u’s,
Near the end of the week, Molly and Greg found time in their schedules to bring Rosie to the flat for a visit.  She squealed when she saw John, smiling widely.  Steeling himself, John eased himself into his armchair and let Molly settle Rosie in his arms.
John’s hands moved of their own accord, accepting the bottle and flipping open the cap.  He was unable to tear his gaze away from Sherlock, who had craned his neck to watch hungrily.     “Please, John.  God, please…”
“He looks very sad,” Molly finished.  A pained look flitted across her face and she glanced toward the kitchen.  It was gone in a trice, but John knew who she had been thinking of.  “It just made us wonder what he had been through.”
“His name isn’t… you know what, sod it,” said John, chuckling.  He moseyed into the kitchen and leaned against the doorframe, watching Sherlock prod the specimen.  “Um, yeah.  As well as can be expected.”
“My blog,” Sherlock corrected.  “Not John’s.  He’s not involved anymore.”  He swayed to his feet.  “Mrs. Hudson, be a lamb and keep Alexander company until he has to leave.  I’m afraid I’m being summoned away.”
It’s a side-effect of getting lost in his own mind, he supposes – when he’s winding through the corridors of his Mind Palace, the cold outside might register as a shiver down his spine or a numbness in his fingertips.  Lost in thought, Sherlock could quite easily ignore plummeting temperatures as they wreak havoc, nibbling away at his energy until he can barely move.  Once, when he was a child, he spent two hours in the dead of winter crouched beside the pond behind their family home, captivated by the flowering whorls of frost at the water’s edge.  Mycroft had found him shivering and stiff, blue to the lips.  Mummy had thrown a fit.
Hours later, the sitting room is immaculate.  Sherlock’s sock index is a disaster.
And a terrible face, the eyes sunken pits, a macabre grin splitting the face like a scar in a withered apple.  The figure raises one hand and waves.
“The highest of compliments, coming from you,” said Winter, touching one hand to his chest in a bow.  “The big man in the government is good, I’ll give him that.  But he doesn’t get out much.  Doesn’t like getting his hands dirty.  Big mistake – he’s relying only on his eyes,” gesturing to the ID numbers on his mobile phone, “and doesn’t realize he’s blind.”
"Oldacre nicked it when I went to amend his will," McFarlane explains.  "Then it was only a matter of asking my mum to confirm it was mine."
at the violin.
It’s like a hand on you all the time.  It’s maddening…”
John’s smile tightens a fraction.  “Whatever are you doing, Mr. Watson-Holmes?”
“I’m saying I’d like… to have some kind of relationship.  With you.”  I fight not to cringe.  God, Sherlock had it on the nose about my babbling and anxiety.  “I would like to get to know you.”
“You almost died again,” John says.  “I wish—I wish you wouldn’t.  Die. I…”  He swallows, tries for a wry smile.  “I need you around, you great berk.”
Mary watched ellipses dance at the bottom of the screen.  She was expecting some inane babble along the lines of “All right, all right, don’t get your panties in a bunch,” but surprisingly, Winter got right to the point.
He was caught off-guard by John’s vehemence when he showed up to supervise their little tryst.  “I’m in the middle of a date! D’you want me to chase some killer while I’m trying to…” He trailed off, fuming.
I had dedicated a year and a half to helping you write?”
The door to Mrs. Hudson’s flat was bolted shut.  John knocked with a heavy hand and called, “Mrs. Hudson!”
The giggles and squeals died instantly.  Sherlock blinked, puzzled.  His vision was murky, the figures arrayed around him blurred into vivid splotches of color.  If he furrowed his brow and squinted, his sight would sharpen a fraction.  The effort made his head hurt.
“I can’t—can’t dance barefoot,” said Sherlock.  Seeing an argument form on the fairy’s lips, he hastened to add, “I’ve got other shoes in my backpack.  Can I…”
– all those thoughts are wiped away, leaving a clean slate.  The template for a new case, a new distraction.
A small protrusion in the jacket pocket.  A weapon?
They stare at each other, unable to tear their gazes away.  Silence settles over the table, heady and thick – and then the pair dissolves into a wheezing, helpless bout of laughter.  Rosie’s stare swivels between her father and godfather, utterly perplexed.
species 1) is hermaphroditic, possessing both male and female anatomy.  When they mate, sea slugs fight for the right to act as the male. The winner stabs his/her mate with his/her penile stylet, fertilizing him/her.  There is also quite a bit of head-stabbing involved, which is hypothesized to induce a kind of mind-control or behavioral change.
Sherlock had stumbled across Animal Planet just last week, in the midst of a hunt for a zookeeper at London Zoo’s Tiger Territory.  The zookeeper had been missing for days.  After scouring Animal Planet’s Youtube channel, Sherlock believed he knew where the zookeeper had gone:  directly into the bellies of the tigers, chopped into pieces and frozen in the apex predators’ favorite treats.
The idea of Rosie as a teenager – with John’s confidence and wry wit, with Mary’s cunning and innate skill, with Sherlock’s… and there, his mind draws a blank.  The jagged edges of Rosie’s reality scrape against him.
“I’m sorry if I seem a little… mad,” Catherine says with a wince.  “It’s just… I’ve read your blog.  I’m a tremendous fan of it.”
as each party fought to destroy the other. A redcap deprived of a kill would eventually weaken and die.
“Oh, will you?”  Lestrade grins.  “Not if you make yourself a nuisance, you won’t.”
They were out the front door in seconds and sprinting across the crumbling pavement.  The busy, antlike figures of the Met grew, resolved into humans, and stilled as they noticed Sherlock and John’s approach.  Anderson and Donovan hastened to meet them; whatever was on Sherlock’s face made Donovan hesitate, pressing her lips together.
John’s eyelids flutter as Sherlock settles between his spread legs, arching his spine to mold every possible point of bare skin to bare skin.  His arms wind around Sherlock and his hands clutch at his arse to bring their cocks into alignment.  They settle into a clumsy rhythm, their twinned moans accompanied by the splash of bathwater.
Later, in the dark, they moved together, exploring with a quiet sense of awe that had not been present the first time.   Then, it had been frantic, needing, an affirmation that they were alive.  Now, it was careful.  John insisted they be careful.
and he’s still got people after me.  D’you know how many times I’ve looked over my shoulder the past few days, how much sleep I’ve had?  Too many and not even
“Hush, you,” says John, slinging an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and mashing clumsy lips against his cheekbone.  He is rosy and exuberant after three drinks, and handsy to boot.  “He means ‘thank you.’”
Sherlock dips his head and purses his lips.  “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
You really are.  :)
“Maybe,” he says.
Sherlock rolls his eyes.  “Don’t be a pedant.”
John stopped in surprise.  “You never mentioned that name.”
Sherlock parts his lips and John’s tongue delves inside.  He’s determined to be relentless and rough, determined not to yield to his gentler impulses.  Sherlock has been toying with him for God knows how long, and it’s high time John got a bit of his own back.
John’s expression sobers.  “No.  No, I think I’m done with office romances.”
“John,” he said.
“It’s your homework,” says Sherlock.  “You choose.”
John rolls his eyes fondly.  “Thank you.  I may be getting old, but I can keep up with you for a while yet.”
“Ooh, a cad,” muses John.  “I quite like that.”
“Then you should deal the same punishment to little Samantha,” says Sherlock coolly.  Samantha tenses in her seat, dark eyes flicking to Sherlock, wide with the terror of a child who has wandered into an adult’s headlights.  “Clearly she instigated whatever squabble they had.”
“Really.”
His lips moved of their own volition.  “I’m not going anywhere.”
“I failed too, Sherlock.”  He says it like a confession.
“Sherlock, you okay?  Can you hear me?”
He was standing in the sitting room at Baker Street.  Sherlock lay pale and drawn in his armchair, the tiny seam along his vena cava fraying as he defended his would-be murderer.  Mary stood between them.  Eyes fixed on John, she cocked her head – the slow, swaying motion of a reptile.
Mycroft said nothing, but it was clear that his better judgment was wrestling against the sentiment he so abhorred.  Sherlock knew how that battle would end.  Mycroft always came to the logical conclusion, even if he had to step on love of family to do so.
Greg nodded.  “Doesn’t say much.  But, John – and before I say anything, I have to clarify that I don’t think it’s dangerous, or, well,
“You’re shaking.”  A note of wakeful alertness.  John’s eyes were intent on him.  “Are you okay?”
After, they lie side-by-side, panting and sweaty and dazed.  John turns so he is flush against Sherlock.  His fingers stroke through the sparse hair on Sherlock’s chest.
“And he seemed… okay?”
John turns with one arm in the sleeve of his coat.  Sherlock stands in the center of the sitting room, pale and weary-eyed and alone.
“You’re going to try to convince her to stop,” said Sherlock.
“The gala will be over by the time we get there and back,” he amended, “and we’ll have to wait for the museum to open.”  He shook his head.  “No, I have to go tonight.  You go back to Chiswick.  I’ll deal with the gala.”
John looked puzzled.  “Why not?”
“I’ll be fine,” John muttered.  He extricated himself from the seat belt and opened the passenger door.  “Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.”
Sherlock watches him for a moment, as if he hasn’t heard the question. Then, with all the levity of someone commenting on the weather – if Sherlock were the kind of person to discuss such mundane things – he says, “You have nightmares.”
“Mrs. Hudson kept complaining about the cold.”
Sherlock stares at her.  Mrs. Hudson’s returning gaze is muddled, but as she processes his shock, her mouth pulls into a pitying frown.  “Oh, Sherlock.”
Greg scratches the side of his neck.  “Hickey.  And…” He chokes the words off, because mentioning Sherlock’s wince when he stood will not only traumatize them, but forever blemish their friendship.
Minutes later, John leads Sherlock down the corridor toward the sitting room.  What little pretense is necessary to fool a five-year-old has been achieved:  Sherlock’s curls are neat, John wears sweatpants over his boxers – conveniently left on the floor during his last sojourn to Sherlock’s room – and if their lips are kiss-reddened, Rosie won’t notice.
“You,” he said.  He could think of nothing else to say.
Looking back on that day, Sherlock feels shame wash through his throat like acid.  He and John had investigated the cult – pretentiously named
Sherlock takes a hefty swig of beer as Molly giggles shrilly.  Once her tittering has subsided, Sherlock adds, “And you’re wrong about one thing.  He might be a boorish drunk, but he
If Mycroft Holmes was surprised to see his little brother slip into the sleek, dark car in a t-shirt, sweatpants, slippers, and his coat, he didn’t let it show.  As Sherlock settled, Mycroft’s mouth tilted in a solicitous smile while his eyes scanned him from head to toe.
And then Moriarty vanished, the shadows swallowing him, leaving empty air in their wake.  John stood motionless for several seconds – and then his shoulders went slack, rising and falling in ragged breaths.  He turned. His expression was a wreck.
“I’m s-s-safe?”
“Hmm, yes.  Protective talismans.”
Sherlock covers John's hand with his own and John smiles, thankful.  "I'm... I'm very lucky I have you.  I don't like to think of who I would be, otherwise."
And now, Peter is gone.  One half of the Father Christmas Killer still roams free.
Two days later, John’s doctor decided it was time for the catheter to come out.  The process was brief and the nurse perfectly competent, but it still hurt like hell, and John was acutely aware of the high whistling between his teeth as he bit down on the pain.  When the ordeal was over, he lay back in his bed, sore and miserable.  His gaze drifted to the empty seat beside his bed.
“Find someone else.  Someone who can appreciate both the science
After doctors and nurses fussed over him with blankets, a CT scan, and bandages for his fingers, Sherlock was released from hospital with diagnoses of
John took in the site of Rosamund with newfound wonder.  A baby – someone who could grow, create, and experience an entire life of their own.  Someone whose mind and body and agency would, in the end, be theirs alone.
Sherlock was stung.  “Last we met, you said John liked me.”
John notices, of course.  As they leave the restaurant hand-in-hand, he narrows his eyes at Sherlock.
“What,” John begins.  He remembers. “Oh.  I—yes.  I did.”
He takes Sherlock’s hands and helps him stand.  The blanket falls to the floor with a whisper.  Feeling shrouded in a dream, Sherlock follows John, fingers entwined, down the corridor to his bedroom.  As they reach the door, John’s footsteps falter for an instant – then he draws Sherlock inside.  At the window, the curtains are drawn back to permit lamplight winking off the snow, all silver and blue.
“John,” he said, “the last transceiver.  It’s in Nathan Garrideb’s shop.”
“Oh.”  Frankly, Sherlock hadn’t cared about Lady Smallwood’s dirty laundry when Magnussen threatened to reveal Mary’s secrets.  “You are… very welcome.”
Sherlock can’t stop the giggle that bursts from him, jumping out of his chest with a spasm.  The laugh spreads to John and back to him, rising between them in a positive feedback loop.  As they finally regain their composure, Sherlock lowers his violin and bow, casting about for the case.  His fingers are numb, his arms sore.
Sherlock leans against John as their feet run into the muck of the bank.  When the water is only lapping at their ankles, John bids Sherlock to be still and sets to the cords around his wrists.  Sherlock winces as his wrists are freed, rolling his shoulders as pain claws at the strained joints.
“Rosamund,” said Mary, raising her head.  “Rosamund Mary.”
He rings off, and Sherlock shoves his mobile phone back in his pocket.  He seizes the handlebars of the motorbike, shifts into gear, and roars down the road, the throbbing growl of the throttle trailing in his wake.
“But you said—”
John kept his mouth shut.  He had spoken to Indrah just last week, and she’d said she was going on leave next week.  “Right.  Well, Rosie and I should be fine here.  You’re leaving…?”
“A soldier,” Sherlock said.  “Former soldier, of course.”  He nodded at Alexander’s right leg.  Then he paused, eyes narrowed as details emerged.  “You were injured in the army several years ago – ten at the outside.  You walk without a cane, which means you’ve had time to adjust to your altered gait.  The callouses on your right palm and fingers are faded, but they indicate experience with handguns.  I’ve studied callous patterns caused by the Sig Sauer L106A1 model extensively, and they’re a dead ringer for yours.”
As Sherlock knelt, scratching Toby behind the ears, Craig turned the device over in his hands.  “Looks fairly standard,” he muttered.  “I can probably set up a tracer to track the signal, if there are other devices you’re looking for.”
“Ah.”  Sherlock flicks his eyes to Rosie, who is gazing adoringly at the picture on the box, running her hands over towers, ramparts, parapets.  A palace in miniature.  Cold seeps through his veins and he raises his voice, calling, “Watson.  I think you’ll appreciate the gift in gold wrapping – with the red ribbon.  Yes, that one.”
to tell me, or did you just… fancy a chat?” Sherlock interjected, or thought he did.  His tongue was heavy, his voice syrupy.  Mrs. Hudson shot him a reproachful look and he smiled.  “I don’t mind a chat.”
“It’s Mary,” said Sherlock.  “She’s—”
The cab trundles to a halt, pitching Sherlock out of his thoughts and into the mayhem of Oxford Street on Christmas Eve.  He opens the door and steps into clamor and chaos.  Frantic, last-minute shoppers clog the pavement like a writhing current, chattering and shouting and full of holiday madness.  Lights are strung overhead, unlit beneath the midday sun but promising a wondrous show by starlight:  here an umbrella, there an angel, there a cluster of orbs, each a moon in miniature.
Lestrade scowls and finally concedes, “Fine.  We’ll wait below.  But if one of you gets pitched off the tower, don’t blame me.”
John watches him for a long moment, smile fading.  “You’re very good to me.”
“Sherlock, wait,” he gasped.  Sherlock tried to pull John back down, but he resisted.  “Right now…”  John chewed on his lip and stared at Sherlock.  Flushed and panting, silver eyes gone coal-dark.  “Right now isn’t a good time.  You aren’t… you aren’t in a good place.”
John shook his head.  “What could chairs mean?”
Sherlock purses his lips and raises his eyebrows, unimpressed.  “Really, John?  With your wealth of medical knowledge, that’s all you can say?”
And then: the walls fall away, revealing the bleak sky and the high scream of wind.  In the distance, the town of Dover and its port look little more than a doll city.  Sherlock holds out a hand, bidding John stop in the doorway.  Then he steps out onto the rooftop.
“John Hamish Watson,” she said.  “Oh, don’t look so shocked.  Of course I know your middle name.  Sherlock keeps notes all over the flat, you know, and once in a blue moon he’ll deign to let me dust…”
“Let me see them,” he gasps, dropping to his knees.  John chuckles and his fingers thread through Sherlock’s curls.  A tug:  an encouragement, a plea.
“I am
Also - please let me know if you spot any mistakes or typos.  I'm running on fumes right now and the words were starting to swim in front of my eyes, so there's a good chance I missed something.  Thanks!
“Mentally ill,” Sherlock states.  “Severe schizophrenia.  Completely dependent on her.  At least she’s a primary school teacher specializing in special education, so it isn’t
“Sherlock.”
“Yeah.”  John pulled his fingers out and gripped himself, sighing a little with the pressure of it.  As he pressed close, Sherlock lifted a foot, seeking purchase.  John wound his arm around Sherlock’s thigh and lifted until he felt Sherlock’s heel rub the small of his back.  Sherlock’s hips tilted as he braced his weight on his back and lifted his other foot, locking his ankles together.  He settled his arms along John’s shoulders and scrabbled at his back, fingernails scraping sparks down his spine.
“I’ve hurt you,” says Sherlock.
It takes only a few minutes for Sherlock and John to find their destination:  Carbuncle Gardens, the thriving Christmas tree nursery of Edmund Brown.  The nursery is enclosed by fences, and a cheery sign painted around the edges with holly and wreathed in fairy lights presides over the coming and going of customers.
“Jesus,” John mutters.
“When you talked about setting up the fund, you said
They were small gestures:  a hand brushing over his shoulder in greeting or parting, bumping feet under the table – accidental or deliberate, Sherlock could never guess – and once, memorably, a ruffle of Sherlock’s curls to soothe a moment of pique.  Sherlock had sat at the kitchen table, microscope before him, stone-still as John collected his tea and toast and moved to the sitting room.
Biting the inside of his cheek, John nods.  He doesn’t look pleased with that aspect of the plan, but he knows time is short.  “Right.  Let’s go.”
“Like I said,” said Craig, “I’ll give it a go.”
“Yes, John,” Sherlock intones, using every ounce of his willpower to keep his voice steady.  “I’m not an invalid.”
Sherlock bites his lip.  “Thank you.”
“Sherlock, what are you…”
While this is almost certainly true for Rosie, Sherlock knows she also inherited some of John and Mary’s worst qualities.  John’s temper is a fearsome thing to behold in an uninhibited five-year-old.
John reaches a hand across the table and laces his fingers with Sherlock’s. For a moment, they simply look at each other.
The transport is staging a riot.
“It’s fine,” Sherlock said.  The text alert on his mobile chimed.
Boredom encroached and he summoned memories of the previous day, when he had tracked his mark into Lichtenberg before putting it down.  The mark – a businessman who had gotten on the wrong neo-Nazi’s bad side – had not been clever enough to evade him, but he
“No.  People.”
symbolizes purity, yes?”
“Anyway,” said Lestrade, unruffled, “we’ll move all the evidence to the lab. Donovan, you’ll follow up with the neighbors.  See if they noticed anything amiss.  Edwards, you’re with me.  We have to get the body parts to the lab so Molly can take a closer look.”
The slosh of water lapping against tiles.  The stink of chlorine, scouring and astringent.
John glared at Joe for a moment longer, then relented, the strength leaving his arm.  Fury billowed off him like heat waves on sun-blasted pavement.  Shrugging off Sherlock’s hand, John strode toward the door.  He paused on the threshold and regarded Joe with a steely look.
“Oh?”
Sherlock wakes shivering.
Sherlock leads John down the corridor, ink-dark and bitterly cold.  Concrete walls press in on them, so tight that when they give way, the contrast is startling: they are out in the open, as exposed as prey in an empty field.
“That
Sherlock scowls.  “Fine.”
“Such a lovely little dear.”
John’s hands shook, threatening to spill the tea.
them.  Enemies, competition for the title of Moriarty.  She was tempting them with something they knew existed, but had been hidden.”
It’s no Onima, but it will have to do.  –SH
His first visit was for a case, putting together a thoroughly accurate disguise.
John had returned an hour later, his temper frayed.  He had not replied to Sherlock’s request for tea, but had trundled to his armchair, swiping the latest edition of The Times off the table as he went.
It comes to him at the simplest and most sinister times – a shock that knocks the breath from his lungs.  Maddening.
John blinks out of his daze.  “What?”
She was cut short by the creak of the opening front door.  Sherlock’s lip curled as his greatest annoyance swanned into the sitting room, umbrella in hand, eyeing the flat with detached disdain.  Slowly – as if Sherlock were merely a part of the scenery – the languid gaze roved to him and halted.
“She’s alive.”
John grunted.  Anger suffused his frame like an electric current humming through a wire stripped to the core: a single brush could shock and sear.
A scream followed John into consciousness, but after a moment of frozen terror, he realized it was not his own.  He bolted upright and ran down the stairs toward the sound.  Sherlock’s door was unlocked; John threw it open, and it struck the wall with a bang.
Perched on her stool, Rosie jabs the pencil at Sherlock.  “Help me!”
John pulls away, and it’s like he’s stealing the last wisp of breath from Sherlock’s lungs as he does so.  His face is flushed, chest rising and falling as he pants.
“Before puberty it’s very difficult to distinguish a male from a female skeleton, but the shoulders are slightly broader than would be expected for a girl… The jaw bone is quite defined. Um… Maybe Molly could help?”
Sherlock nodded, “It was… Good.” He mumbled stiffly.
Just as John was crawling into bed next to them, the doorbell rang downstairs.
“No, Sherlock. Look at me.” John said quietly.
Ooooh, plot twist! Also, in case anyone isn't aware, the quote at the bottom is the de-coded clue for Sherlock when he was trying to find Redbeard.
“He must still be dead, it’s just not his body.” Sherlock proclaimed, “Lestrade, please ask your team to identify how long the skeleton has been in the water.”
“Oi!” John slapped his arm jokingly. They both laughed, shoulders shaking under the covers. Unknowingly, they both moved so that they feet touched, and the laughter slowly faded. The atmosphere grew serious, as though whatever was about to happen next mattered. Truly mattered.
The baby monitor crackled as Rosie’s sharp cry flooded the room. John sighed regretfully against Sherlock’s mouth, slowly pulling away. His lips were red and swollen, his hair riotous where Sherlock’s hands had dishevelled it. Sherlock could only imagine what he looked like.
John’s footsteps came down the stairs heavily, obviously carrying Rosie with him. His murmuring became more distinct as he reached the foot of the stairs.
“What did you do to him?” Sherlock demanded lowly, coldly.
“So…” John coughed a bit awkwardly, “was last night… Okay?”
“They’re… the analysis found them to be about 125 years old. As in, the little boy died 125 years ago.”
“Yeah. Rosie must have tired herself out last night. Took her ages to drop back off.” John agreed.
“Sherlock… Have you… Ever…. Y’know -”
“So Euros somehow happened to find a 125 year old skeleton at the bottom of a well near your house, and pretended all these years that she had drowned Victor in it, giving you clues to find it?” John said doubtfully.
“Redbeard, your dear little pet friend, Victor Trevor… He isn’t dead.” Euros grinned.
John smiled, and moved his hands up to hold his face firmly between his hands. “Yes.” He breathed.
“The skeleton found at the bottom of the well at Musgrave is 125 years old. So not Victor’s skeleton.”
Sherlock hummed in agreement, shifting Rosie so she leaned against the pillow so he could get up, too. John had already started padding down the stairs to get the door.
“Yeah?” John replied hopefully.
Sherlock shook his head sharply, “It was hard enough to manage that with Molly and Mycroft helping me, a child on his own could not have done that.”
John scrubbed his hands over his face. Sherlock was already more irritable than he had been even since Rosie was born. He seemed to have endless patience for her, no matter how loud she cried or for how long. But this case, this is what was crumbling that hard-earned self-control.
The pressure of John’s smooth lips increased and he breathed deeply. Their noses touched. Slowly, John pulled Sherlock’s bottom lip between his own, and something in Sherlock snapped. He inhaled sharply, and heat overtook his body. He gripped the nape of John’s neck, wrapped his arm around his waist, and when John’s tongue licked questioningly at the inside of Sherlock’s mouth, Sherlock crushed himself closer, opening his mouth so that John could lick inside. Their tongues twined together like their limbs did under the covers. John’s tongue pushed Sherlock’s down like a fight for dominance, and it was surprisingly sexy. It was hot, it was wet, and Sherlock had never loved John Watson more intensely than in this moment.
“Hm. Perhaps from a poor family then? Any signs of hard graft, did the child work?” As he suggested it, Sherlock poked at the finger bones with gloved hands, trying not to touch too much while looking for wear and tear.
“I can’t hold you and make milk at the same time, Rosie!” Sherlock explained. Not that Rosie could understand him. God, what had he become. He rolled his eyes at himself. Looking round in desperation, he spotted her teddy giraffe, and sighed in relief.
John nodded slowly, seriously. “That’s okay, Sherlock.” He said quietly, looking into Sherlock’s multi-coloured eyes.
“Thank you.” John repeated.
John appeared by his side with Rosie propped against his hip. “Here, I’ll do it, don’t worry.” He said, pressing against his side and touching his hands as he reached for the bottle. Sherlock momentarily froze, before handing the warm bottle over to John so he could feed Rosie.
Sherlock ducked his head, embarrassed. “Yes, John, I know it’s fine.” He said stiffly.
“Hungry? Come on then.”
“They can’t be. The analysis is very accurate. We asked a professional archaeologist to take a look, and all the signs are there. They are not the bones of a boy who died 30 years ago.”
He grabbed his dressing gown from behind the door, slipping it on and tying it firmly around his waist. He felt exposed after this morning’s events with John, as though Lestrade would psychically be able to tell. While Sherlock himself could always deduce these things, he doubted Lestrade had the mental capabilities to do so.
“So… Do you think the boy, drowned then?”
Sherlock shook his head as if to dispel a fly buzzing round his head “I won’t think about ‘what if’s yet. Focus on the facts.” He said monotonously.
“John…” Sherlock said hesitantly, “Kiss me? Please?” He added nervously.
“Yes?” Sherlock quirked an eyebrow. What could possibly be of interest about poor Victor’s bones?
Taking the stairs two at a time, Sherlock swept into the slowly-awakening toddler’s room and reached straight into the wooden cot.
“Morning.” John murmured quietly.
“No.”
Come morning, the arrival of D.I. Lestrade would disturb this gentle routine somewhat.
“Where’s the fun in that?” Euros questioned, smiling, “Such a wonderful discovery shouldn’t be wasted.”
“You did!” Sherlock shouted, smashing the table with his fist. John put his hand on Sherlock’s back to calm him down and Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Oh?”
“Yes. I know.” Sherlock said tensely, “Just do it. Then send it to all the border control authorities in Europe and all the police stations that will listen.”
“Yes, yes, I’ll get to that. But can you see anything medically wrong with this skeleton? How did the child die? Was there a struggle? Was he ill?”
“To be continued.” John said affirmatively, fondly running his fingers through Sherlock’s curls, before stretching and rolling out of bed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“But a child with Euros to aid him…?” Mycroft left the question hanging.
“Where is he?!” Sherlock shouted, standing and pounding his fists on the table once more.
“Very good.” Sherlock grinned, confident that John felt the same, “So… If I wanted to repeat… Last night…?” Sherlock left the question hanging, and he could feel the blush in his cheeks. He shut his eyes in embarrassment, and felt the blush getting worse.
Sherlock plucked a freshly cleaned bottle from the newly-made bottle prepping station that had taken up permanent residence by the sink. It was a carefully choreographed system of washing, reusing and restocking, much like every other aspect of their new life with a toddler to care for. A military operation.
John nodded and walked into the lounge. The sofa had become the ‘feeding chair’, because the arm rests were just the right height for resting tired arms on as Rosie’s head lay against them.
“Oh this is pointless. What good is identifying the possible job this child performed 125 years ago? MOLLY!” Sherlock shouted through the door.
“Yes.” Sherlock’s voice crackled down the line from Sherrinford.
Is Victor actually dead?
“Tell me what?” Sherlock spoke slowly.
“Oh it’s all coming together now! You see? I never confirmed nor denied your conclusion that I killed your friend. So what does that mean…?” Euros trailed off meaningfully, touching her lower lip with her finger in a traditional ‘thinking’ pose.
“Ah, Greg, what can we do for you?” He greeted him, using his first name proudly. It always made Lestrade happy that he remembered it now.
Sherlock drummed his fingers on his knees as he waited for Mycroft to reply.
Euros has agreed to talk.\\
“We’re not… Sure.” Lestrade replied, eyebrows creased.
They were in a small room on Sherrinford island, as it was too dangerous to let Euros out again. A table separated Euros from Sherlock, Mycroft and John. All were silent, staring, both fascinated and disgusted by the malevolent actions of a supposedly-innocent 6 year old.
“This is not a game, Euros. The game is over. You tricked us, well done, we thought the body was Victor’s. Now where is Victor’s body really?” Sherlock hissed angrily.
“He wouldn’t,” Sherlock growls.
“Right,” muttered John.
“There could be coconut in here, John.  I won’t take any chances.”
At that moment, Rosie stirred, her mouth forming a little oval as she yawned.  In Sherlock’s mind palace, a room took shape, bare save for a wooden chest.  Sherlock’s fingers brushed the grain of the lid, clasped, lifted.  A pink felt blanket was folded inside.
Words climb the back of Sherlock’s throat; he swallows them back, supplants them.  “You said you wanted me.”
That sense of disquiet prompted Sherlock to take McFarlane’s case. Without giving himself time to question it – time to doubt the sentiment worming through the logic, the data he has only just started to trust – Sherlock purchased two train tickets to Inverness.
Alexander’s hand cast out for the armchair across from Sherlock’s, and a noise of protest slipped from him before he could choke it.  The hand stilled.  Alexander looked at him.
First, there is only pain, stunning and white-hot.  Then Sherlock tries to drag in a breath and finds his nose clogged with the stink of iron.  He rears back and clasps a hand to his face.  Blood gushes from his nose, dribbles down his lips.
“I expect we’ll find out.”
Ellipses (...) indicate a text in-progress.
“the violin.  Obviously.”
“Fuck,” John grunted.
Mind whirling, heart in his throat, Sherlock fishes out his mobile phone and rings John.  John answers and he starts to babble, half-shouting over the rumble of his motorbike. “She’s not here, she’s gone, I was too late—”
Sherlock Watson-Holmes is a man who abhors clichés.
Sitting on the sofa, boneless with exhaustion, John tips his head back and sighs.  They’ve just finished a long, grueling case – a prominent politician’s wife kidnapped, a series of threatening letters and severed fingers – preceded by a marathon of shifts at the clinic when one of John’s coworkers took maternity leave. All is well now.  The politician’s wife is safe, all ten fingers and toes intact, the threats having been stolen from a morgue.  John wants nothing more than to fall asleep and hibernate for ten years or so.  He doesn’t think Sherlock will mind if he uses the sofa.  If he has to conduct any experiments, he can use John’s chest as a benchtop.
But something in his babbling snags Sherlock’s attention like a hook in a fish’s lip.  They go back to the cottage for a second look, ignoring the specter of the dead woman found just that morning, face white and eyes wide in a mask of permanent terror.  As John rifles around in another room, Sherlock goes to the kitchen window and peers out into the inky gloom.  He can see no devil cavorting on the hills, but he does see a smear of ash on the windowsill.  He scoops a pile the size of a thimble into a pilfered evidence bag and stuffs it in his pocket before John can join him.
Until Sherlock, working on a hemoglobin experiment at Bart’s Hospital in London, bemoaned his shite digs to a commiserating Stamford.  Good chap, Stamford; no brilliant mind behind that placid expression, but sharper than most of the morons running roughshod over the world.  Disarmingly easy to talk to.
Rosie reaches into the box and pulls out a violin case.  Her arms tense under the weight, but she sets it down with the utmost care and flips open the clasps.  Her fingers brush over the velvet casing, the delicate scroll.  It’s as if all her excitement has been distilled.  Purified into a moment of wonder.
Sherlock is suddenly and acutely aware of the cold.
They said nothing as the cab ferried them back to Baker Street.
John was stunned by a sucker-punch of affection.  Even in his state, Sherlock was the picture of childlike delight as he shifted his hands to scratch behind the hound’s ears.
Sherlock turns his focus back to the microscope, but keeps one ear on the sitting room, where John is gathering Rosie’s coat, hat, and mittens.  His voice is soft and low.  “Arms out, darling.  Yes, like that.”
The denim of John’s jeans is rough against Sherlock’s hands as they run over his knees, up his thighs.  He can feel the muscles of John’s legs tense as he splays his fingers over the jut of his cock, toying with his zip.  The staccato of John’s hitched breaths forms an intoxicating rhythm.  “Yes?”
“Right.”  John’s left hand spasmed – whether from nerves or the urge to reach for the magnifying glass in his pocket, Sherlock couldn’t say.  “That.”
At that, Rosie pries herself away from her father, face red.  She is all but trembling with exhaustion, but she says, “I know.”
The following month was a blur of missed calls, preparing for the baby, missed calls, fighting with Mary, and more missed calls.  He visited Baker Street only for Mrs. Hudson to apologize and tell him Sherlock was out.  Always out on cases, she said, or pestering that lovely girl at the morgue, or bickering with his brother at that stuffy old club, you know, the one where they lose their wits if you utter a word?
Piggy goes very pale.  He drops the blade.
Sherlock draws a steadying breath and tries to relax.  In time, the discomfort passes and his body loosens around the intrusion.  John crooks his finger, seeking, and Sherlock gasps and trembles as sparks of sensation crackle through him.  When his vision clears, he finds John grinning down at him.
But this – this is different.  This is a hand on the small of his back as Sherlock guides him through the chaos of a crime scene, claiming John will tread on delicate evidence otherwise.  This is Sherlock crowding against John whilst undercover at a nightclub, lingering just long enough for John to feel the press of lean muscles under clinging clothes.  This is Sherlock leaning against him in the close darkness of a cab, boneless and warm, sighing with the contentment of a case well-solved.
“That part is simple,” said Mycroft.  “This next one is less so.”
“Not enough blood to be fatal,” John said, blinking past a red haze.  “He might still be alive.”
“Yes,” Sherlock says a third time.  It feels like sealing a magical curse, more potent and powerful than any oath he’s ever made.  “Get some rest, John.”
Over the years, Sherlock has come to realize that John doesn’t have a specific
“Stay,” he murmurs.
John knew he had done the right thing.  It hurt more than anything he had ever experienced, but it had been right.  That didn’t stop him from feeling the guilt of tearing a potential future away from Sherlock.
need to know everything about me.  What made you think it was a good idea to sneak into the room of a combat veteran with PTSD and spy on him while he was sleeping? Honestly?  Because I’m wracking my brain and I can’t fathom a proper reason.”
“Yeah.”  Lestrade’s tone is disbelieving and a trifle smug.  “Thought that’d get your attention.  Will you come?”
“What, Anderson?”
Later, as they lie in bed sipping lukewarm tea, John asks, apropos of nothing, “Did you sleep well?”
Sherlock nods and stands, helps John lever to his feet.  As they trudge down the path, he darts a glance over his shoulder, hoping past a thin veneer of disdain.  The swans are floating out of sight, tail feathers flicking idly as they make their way back to the nest.
“Oh.”  John takes the pill, sets it on his tongue, and chases it down with a gulp of water.  “Ta.”
Well.  He might have got carried away.
“Rosie,” he said, and leaned forward to kiss the top of the baby’s head.
“Jesus Christ!” John shouts.
Mary shifted and drew near, her hand still grasping his.  She turned, silently bidding him to wind his arms around her.
John sighed as Molly hurried into the room, and began to have a look herself.
Sherlock grunted in frustrated acknowledgement. They all thought for a few minutes, the room silent apart from Rosie’s gurgles.
He had argued half-heartedly with John about burning the thing instead, but ultimately they had managed to struggle through without killing anyone. It was quite humiliating to be reduced to throwing an instruction manual out the window in frustration, and then sheepishly going all the way outside to pick it up and bring it back, when one was supposedly a genius. John had almost collapsed in his amusement, as Sherlock fought a smile tugging at his lips. The feeling of pride when they had observed the finished thing was surprisingly satisfying, though.
“Seems that way, however improbable. But that means Victor’s body must still be somewhere. And that she knew we would discover that the skeleton in that well is not Victor’s.”
“Da-da-da-da!” Rosie garbled delightedly, causing Sherlock to whip round to see John stumbling through the kitchen doorway, rubbing his eyes.
The motion caused his old army t shirt to lift above his waistband, and Sherlock distractedly tore his eyes away from the tanned skin beneath.
When John’s weight settled next to Sherlock’s later that night, Sherlock shifted quietly to accommodate him.
Just as Sherlock was hurriedly smoothing down his hair in the mirror, Lestrade’s gruff voice could be heard climbing the stairs.
John’s lips pressed quickly, and somewhat chastely, to his cheekbone, where it was hot with the adrenaline of the blush. Sherlock’s eyes flew open. They were acting like young teenagers, for God’s sake.
Sherlock blinked up at John tiredly, before his lips slowly creased into a smile. He contentedly dipped his head back down and fell back to sleep.
Interesting. Must be serious if he didn’t just text Sherlock.
If you actually watch TFP, Euros never confirmed that Victor is dead. So. Yeah. *spooky music*
“Right. Okay. So we’ll create Missing Persons posters for a 42 year old male, blonde hair, English-speaking, no known history before the age of 8,” Lestrade sighed, “We’re not gonna get very far with that. He could be anywhere.”
“Why do you say that? He could well be alive.” Mycroft butted in.
“Right. John and I will go to Bart’s. Um…” Sherlock looked at Rosie, thinking. “Is Mrs Hudson in?”
“No signs of a fracture anywhere, no signs of a struggle. Nothing. I wish I could observe the flesh.” Sherlock said, irritated, and a bit creepy. “Do you see anything John?”
Their lips met slowly, as though they’d never done this before. And they hadn’t, really.  Not properly.
“Here, you are!” He exclaimed, picking it up and ‘boop’ing her in the nose.
“So you didn’t bother to identify who the skeleton belonged to?”
She turned her head so that her lips pressed against his neck, breathing heavily. Her little hand fisted in the soft collar of his pyjama top, and the other lay against his bare bicep, contracting occasionally. Sherlock had of course researched these basic reflexes, and he smiled down at her. So vulnerable still. As he looked down at her, her brow dented and her eyes screwed up.
think
“He’s fine,” said Mrs. Hudson hastily.  She paused and chewed on her lower lip.  “Well.  As fine as you can be with a broken leg, but with Sherlock, that’s finer than most.  Getting a bit manic, though.  Can’t dash about on crutches, I suppose, but he does hobble very quickly.  Drives his physiotherapist mad.  I told him – Sherlock, not the therapist – ‘Sherlock, you can’t dash about forever, so maybe you can look at this as a wake-up call,’ but you know him…”
but John’s eyes say something else entirely.  He thrusts his hips gently, safe in the knowledge that the crush of bodies will conceal them.
Here I am!
The attempt at levity works; a laugh is startled out of John.  Shaking his head, he crawls across the bed, cock hanging thick and ruddy between his legs.  He loops his forefingers under the waistband of Sherlock’s pants.  “Let me help you with that.”
“All right, that’s enough.”  But a smile is fighting past the weariness on John’s face, and Sherlock will give not an inch.
Sherlock nods, dazed.  “Yes.  On the freezer wall.  He said they – the victims – were gifts.  For me.”
“John!” Sherlock bellows.  Bellowing is necessary because Sophie is wailing fit to bring the house down around them.  “John, help!”
Sherlock turned, maintaining his pace as they cut a path through the crush of commuters.  “What is it?”
Sherlock’s train of thought suddenly judders off the tracks.  “What—what did he say?”
Mrs. Hudson snorted.  “Wouldn’t you like to know.  Now.  The stairs?”
Ennui setting in.  Let’s go for a walk in Hyde Park after your shift.  –SH
“Oh, God.  You saw me flatline again.”
Sherlock fumbles with the oven dial, but the settings are such that the flame will burn brighter before the ignition is cut.  His fingers, slippery with wine, fail to twist far enough.  The fire blazes higher and Sherlock feels his eyebrows begin to singe before John drags him back, pushes him aside, and brandishes the extinguisher.  “Get back!”
“Who ensorcelled you?” he demanded.  Hope had to know. Fairies rarely enchanted a complete stranger.  The punishment for ensorcelling humans was severe enough to deter tricking random passers-by.
Sherlock needs a moment to find his voice.  “Yes.”  Clearing his throat, he continues, “So much.  And I—I love you too, Watson.”
He sat beside Sherlock on the sofa and they chatted about pants and the lack thereof.  Burst into giggles like a pair of schoolboys.  John’s hand stole to a trailing fold of the sheet, worrying the white fabric between thumb and forefinger.  Sherlock’s laughter ceased.
“Uh-huh.”
John laughs, a little forced.  His fingers tighten around Sherlock’s.  “And no concept of taste.”
Icy fear claws at Sherlock as he pivots, mind scrambling to make sense of what has happened.  The beam of the torch cuts a glowing swathe across the ceiling, pooling on the wall near an open window.  And inside that window, clinging to the ceiling, are three long, jagged icicles.
“No, you ponce, not ‘the anniversary of the day Sherlock Holmes was almost drowned in the Thames,’” says John, swatting his shoulder before setting a cup of tea beside Sherlock’s elbow.  His hand lingers, smooths into a caress as he crosses to his side of the table.  Setting down his own steaming cup, he opens his laptop and pecks at the keys with his usual lumbering fervor.  “I prefer ‘the anniversary of the day Sherlock Holmes stuck his tongue far enough down John Watson’s throat to give him the mother of all colds.’”
Twitching back the duvet, Sherlock swings his legs over the side of the bed and stands. He shambles to the wardrobe, pulls open the doors, and tugs a dressing gown off its hanger.
Sherlock cocks an eyebrow.  “Surely whatever you’ve got to say can be said here.  Unless you’re worried about dumbfounding your officers, but basic speech could accomplish that…”
“Well,” he said, voice thin, “I suppose I’d better tell Mycroft we’ll be late.”  He retrieved his mobile phone and unlocked the screen.  Speaking as though to himself, but leaving no room for John to mishear, he added, “And I can find something… suitable.  For the gala.”
The blanket slipped from Sherlock’s fingers and he clasped his hands to his mouth, feeling his gorge rise.
Meanwhile, Rosie putters about the flat.  She peers through Sherlock’s microscope, plays with her castle, props one walkie-talkie between Sullivan and the reindeer and babbles into the other.  Later, seated beside the windows with one elbow propped on the table, she lists with heavy eyes.
Mary was awake before the text alert fell silent, untangling her arms from the duvet to reach for her mobile phone. One of the numbers Winter had given her flashed across the screen.  She rubbed her brow with a sigh.
“You will have Mycroft’s clearance to do so.” Sherlock confirmed.
The snuffling noise emerging from the baby monitor woke Sherlock instantly. He lifted his head and listened carefully for any further noises; sure enough, the sound of wet sniffling and increasingly heavy breathing permeated the dark, thick atmosphere of Sherlock’s bedroom. Sherlock looked over his shoulder, and saw John breathing slowly and calmly beside him. Best to get to Rosie before she started crying and woke John.
“Right.” Mycroft replied, “So at what point did you decide to pretend the skeleton was Victor’s body? Why didn’t you just tell Mummy or Daddy and forget about it?”
“You’re a monster,” Sherlock whines.  “A villain.  A
To their credit, Anderson and Donovan only hesitated for an instant before springing into action.  Donovan signaled for two officers to collect Wiggins, who glared daggers at Sherlock while he was restrained and searched.  Meanwhile, Anderson lead Sherlock and John to a patrol car.  As they sped along the A302, Sherlock dialed Alexander’s mobile and tried to calm his breathing as the phone rang, rang,
The children who were taken – one-hundred gone, ninety-nine restored – would never be quite the same.  Though none of them knew it, all were touched by an ethereal hand.  All grew and developed qualities that could only be described as
A mischievous glint flickers in John’s eyes, doused an instant later as a familiar voice encroaches in their space.  “Oi, Sherlock!  John!”
“Have the Yard found any other connections between the victims and the killer?  Was there a motive?”
“Wanted this,” John gasps, pulling away from the kiss, “so much, Sherlock.  This—this is a fucking
“You said ‘I,’” Sherlock noted.
The needle buried still deeper; John’s fingers wound into fists at his sides, unwound with a forceful breath.  “I’m not.  Even if…  Well, I’m not worried.  I know you would be careful.”  God, but it was hard to speak freely with Sherlock, even when he knew it was allowed.  Encouraged, even.  “I know you would do that for me.  If… if I asked.”
It is only later, filling out paperwork at his desk, that Greg realizes Sherlock paid him a compliment.  Wrapped in scorn and tied with a ribbon of indecent lunacy, it was a compliment nonetheless.
Sherlock frowns.  “I was not.”
Perhaps it’s just as well they’re in a church, John thinks.  Because as he caresses and plunders with hand and mouth, Sherlock’s moans and pleas take a worshipful note.  Like a litany, or a prayer.
John suddenly tenses, gasps.  He reaches back, hand curling around Sherlock’s hip.  At the first insistent tug, Sherlock falls into a faltering rhythm, each thrust marked by a panting breath.
“Oh, for… Christ, Sherlock, what is it?”
I could believe.  She was a genius.  I was always ten steps behind her.  But this…”  He looked at the screen, where Mary’s youthful face stared back.  “This isn’t possible.  It must be a mistake.  S-she…”  His voice trembled, broke.  “She killed herself.  When the cancer spread to Effie’s brain, Rose couldn’t—couldn’t cope.”
Back in the safety of the cab, Sherlock and John came down from their laughing fit long enough to direct the cabbie to the next address.  Shaking his head, John wiped his forehead with a hand.
The victim was found seated neatly in a cider stand at Christmas by the River.  A pair of young women had demanded their drinks from her three times before realizing she wasn’t simply being churlish.
“Finally,” Sherlock grumbled.
I'm Zingiberis on Ao3.
is a sense of wary relief.  Relief that Sherlock has returned to him yet again.  Wariness that he will evaporate the moment John tries to pin him down.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft said, several minutes later.  The car had glided to a stop in front of the flat.  “The drugs need to stop.  You cannot continue like this.  You’re on the same road you took years ago – you know where it leads.”
Then:  “Oh.”
A litany, a prayer.
“I will,” says Rosie.
ill!”
The scar at the center of Sherlock’s chest twinges at the slight, but he forges onward.  “You’ll come with me, of course.”
“Oh, John, I’m…”  Mary looked down on the dozing baby’s face, blinking hard.  Her lips pulled into a tremulous smile.  “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you, but when you were… when you were gone, I started thinking up names.  You know, to pass the time, and… well.  It felt like a little secret between the two of us.”  She kissed the top of the baby’s head.  “For so long, it was just us.  Just me and the baby.  I guess I ended up naming her in my mind.”
Of course.  –SH
John regretted the words the moment they left his mouth – he sounded like a complete twat.  He sighed and closed his eyes, willing sleep to overtake him.  If he dozed off, Mrs. Hudson might take pity on him and leave.
“Hullo, ‘andsome,” he says, clapping a hand on John’s shoulder.
“I’ve had many enemies, Big Brother.  Not all of them were connected to Moriarty.”
“But then it loses its effect!”
you.”
but aren’t snowball fights quite common among children?”
“I only ask because she’s clearly mute, and by my judgement, she hasn’t eaten in a few days,” said John.  “You must have known where she kept it.  You’re her brother, after all.”
A moment of silence stretches between us.
Sherlock, startling a gasp out of him and gasping in turn as their hips slot together, hardening pricks rubbing and rutting through layers of clothes.  Sherlock’s gasp unfurls into a low chuckle; it’s infectious, and soon John is laughing, too, and they’re giggling and covering each other’s mouths with warm palms and warmer kisses.
you find something new.”
“You were shaking.”
After a tense moment, John coughs out another chuckle.  “Well.  Mission accomplished, I suppose.”
John raises his eyebrows.  “And how would you know that, hmm?”
There is a glimmer of good amidst the news, however.  The charred corpse Oldacre used to frame McFarlane was not human.  Blackened beyond recognition, it had taken forensics time to isolate usable DNA and make the analysis.  Bovine, young - killed and twisted past comprehension by mallet and flame.  Oldacre may be a psychopath, but as of yet, he is not a murderer.
“Come on, love,” John tells Sophie.  “Let’s leave this cranky old man alone to stew while we get you a bite.”
The thought niggles at him, disconcerting.  If Sherlock had asked himself the same question a decade ago – perhaps even five years ago – he would have scoffed at his own stupidity and fallen back on his usual
“And you haven’t been found in a month,” Mary marveled. “That is… impressive.”
As he walks out, Sherlock sits a moment longer, willing his treacherous heart to slow.  His mind races to hoard the feeling of John’s hand on him,
A thin man swayed into the doorway of the back room, brows knitted as he rubbed a handkerchief over dusty spectacles.  The smile twitching over his lips was brief and impersonal.  As he spoke, his fingers continued their cyclic task.
“Greg,” John called.  Wind rustled over the line, followed by a huff as Lestrade returned.
“I… I was Rosie,” I say.  “But I’ve gone by Cathy all my life.”
Wincing, Su Lin turned her head and stared at the bottom of the tabletop.  It was as if she could see through the wood, see through to the carnage of her beloved teapots.  Her eyes closed once more and she stilled.
John’s fingers climb his shoulder to rub at the knob of his clavicle. “No.  No, this was perfect.”
“I’m fine,” Sherlock says.
“In the Watson fashion, I believe that translates to violence,” Mycroft said coldly.
Sherlock thought.
Sherlock’s focus snagged on the chair legs and he drew closer, frowning.  They were warped by irregular hills and valleys.
“Yes,” Sherlock says.  “I was going to go to the Yard – see if Lestrade has anything new on Peter Helens.  They still haven’t found him.”
According to Lestrade, they had nothing to go on regarding Hope’s killer.  Sherlock gave him a pointed look and the DI rolled his eyes. “Okay, gimme.”
“You did a good thing for Peter,” says John.  “Sometimes that’s all you can do.”
Su Lin dropped the teapot with a sharp gasp.  Crouching, Sherlock fetched it out of the air, sparing the relic an untimely demise against the tiled floor.  He pressed the teapot into Su Lin’s trembling fingers.
of his breathing.  “It never used to be like this,” he says, voice breaking.
“What do you want, Sherlock?” he says.  “I need to know.  I can’t… I keep stumbling through the dark.  With you.” His mouth has gone suddenly dry. “I need…”
A warehouse rears into view.  Beyond it, a factory belches smoke into the air from twin chimneys.  Father Christmas tears past the warehouse and makes a hard turn into an alleyway squeezed between the buildings.
John gaped at her.  “What are you…”
Some witnessed the disappearances.  A mother in Downderry ran screaming from the beach when she saw her son race across the sand and wink out of existence with the first footfall into salt water.  They spent hours dredging the coast for him, certain the mother was mad with grief.  Children didn’t simply
“You’re self-conscious about your age.”  The deduction is as clear as crystal to Sherlock, uttered without a thought.  John’s smile falters and regret twists in Sherlock’s chest.
“I’m a genius.”
– proved less useless than Sherlock had anticipated, bludgeoning a Fae acrobat with his own pole.  They escaped the bedlam and retreated to Baker Street.
A knock at the door interrupts me.  My stomach twists into knots.
“Lestrade might catch him,” Sherlock says with more contrariness than conviction.
“Wait,” said John, clapping a hand to Sherlock’s shoulder to keep him from dashing inside.  Catching himself, he jerked his hand back, shame twisting in his stomach.  He drew his Sig.  “I’ll go first.”
John half-leads, half-drags Sherlock away from the crime scene.  After digging his heels in for a few steps, Sherlock lets himself be led, feeling like all the strength has been scraped out of him with a blunt blade.  He is hollow, his mind fixed on the image of Lucy’s cold, pale face, her eyes wide and unseeing.
“Oh, right,” says John.  “Lestrade mentioned them.  He and the rest of the Yard are following up on the rest, but so far, all the photographs have been of living people.”
“Obviously,” says Sherlock.  “It’s only eggy bread.  Not advanced chemistry.”
“I see,” says John, his tone expectant.
Without awaiting a response, Sherlock stepped into the pool of light surrounding the general and her captives.  Two men flanked her, eyeing him with brutish contempt. Beside the general stood the crossbow she had used for the escapology act.  A makeshift lever stood above it, over which a pulley with a bag tied to one end hung. Sand streamed from a hole in the bag, whispering as the grains counted down the minutes.  On the other end of the rope, a weight descended with slow purpose toward the trigger.
The gap widens and John comes in, eyes flicking toward Sherlock and away in the space of a breath.  He reaches to the hanger opposite the bath and selects a towel, drops it on the toilet seat.  Lips pressed into a firm line, he nears the tub and holds out his hands to help Sherlock stand.  Though John’s eyes are rooted on the tile floor, Sherlock can’t help but feel intensely vulnerable as he grips John’s forearms, levers himself slowly to his feet.  His knees shake as he climbs out, coltish with nerves.
Brazenly, Sherlock pushed away from the counter and retrieved a needle and filter.  He drew up the contents of the beaker, twisted the filter into place, and expelled the solution into a new tube.  As he repeated the process with a new filter, John’s stare weighed on him like a boulder.  A part of him was anxious to get this over with, if only to make John leave.
Rosie’s eyes widen.  “What?”
“You’re a doctor,” said Sherlock.  “In fact, you’re an army doctor.” He tugged on the second glove.
Once the bartender is bundled off in handcuffs, Sherlock snags John’s hand before they can be roped into the tedium of paperwork.  He leads John to the street and waves frantically at passing cabs until one deigns to stop.
“‘Spect you’ll be grateful for that when the tube in your willy comes out.”  Mrs. Hudson’s eyes gleamed with mischief and John cringed, reaching for the scratchy blanket draped over his lap.  “Oh, John, don’t be a clot.  I’m not going to take a peek.”
“Mycroft is nauseating.”
He draws his hand back to find a disconcerting amount of blood on his palm. “Fug.”
Eirene nodded, magnanimous.  “Of course.  I’m sure he’s nimble on his feet.  Aren’t you, sweetling?”
Sherlock’s heart thumps as the implication of that fact hits him like a slap of cold water.
This would be a perfectly reasonable arrangement if not for three things.  The first is that, by some wizardly yet unknown to him, he has become John Watson’s lover – and if he wants to remain that way, which he very much does, he needs to start charming John outside the bedroom (or the broom cupboard, if you prefer).  Flowers, chocolates, all that rot.
Sherlock merely grunts; the sight of the bed is too tantalizing to be usurped by something as silly as speech.  He mirrors John, removing his tie and tossing it to the floor.  He sets to the buttons of his shirt with muzzy, single-minded focus.
“The Grant family is fairly well-known in the business community,” Alexander continued.  “We manufacture tools for surgery – dental, mostly, and a bit of oropharyngeal.  We were recognizable enough that Effie’s death, and then my wife’s… well, there was a bit of a media circus.  Nothing huge, but it was more than I could handle.  So.”  He nodded at Sherlock.  “I wanted someone more discreet.  And apparently you’re the best there is.”
"While a sexual crime was committed, why did she not ask for help from the police? In addition to her conservative personality, the suspect might be an acquaintance - forcing her to leave her home and travel to Hong Kong to find you, the suspect is likely to be a family member.” Sherlock glanced at John and looked away again. "And you have a longtime alcoholic brother."
"Thank you, Mrs Hudson!" Sherlock said rudely.
"Sherlock ~" John shouted and moaned. Their pantings and groans resounded in the room, no matter they had already naked, still felt like it was hot as on fire.
"Of course." John shared the same will.
September 7, 1940, Nazi Germany strategically decided to stop the aerial warfare and started a systematical bombing of the British capital. From this day to November 3, London was bombed for 56 out of the following 57 days and nights by an average of 200 fighters per night, only the first two days caused more than 800 people died.
Did you hear what Mycroft said by your bedside, about the terrorist attack on the Houses of Parliament? I thought the case would be faster to be solved if you were there. Waiting for you to wake up and work with me again. Without our exciting adventures, the amount of exercise is greatly reduced, sitting around you all day, muttering, I'll soon become a nagging middle-aged short fat man.
"So..." Sherlock looked at John and lowered his voice under John's instructions, "we just broke this damn law?"

Mycroft's hardworking attitude might have benefited many people in the world, but not his brother Sherlock. The Holmes family had an aristocratic and gentry background, but while came to Mycroft’s generation, it had long been declined. An early dead father and a neurasthenic mother made Mycroft assumed the responsibility of taking care and educating Sherlock. But Mycroft's political talent was soon appreciated by the British government that entrusted him with the task, from a small civil service jumped into a diplomat, was sent to different places for the government to resolve disputes. Sherlock traveled with his brother since he was a little child, running across most of the earth, but never staying in the same place for more than a year. Frequently transferred from one school to another, Sherlock could not find any sense of belonging no matter where. Also because of his eccentric character, Sherlock could not make any friends. He just felt himself floating like a duckweed with the water, no roots and insignificant.
It's John.
The car door was opened suddenly, Sherlock stared at the person who was coming out - turned out to be his roommate Victor Trevor who wearing a scared look on his face, and even avoiding eye contact with Sherlock, just passed Sherlock with a taut face, backed to the dormitory with a guilty conscience.
"I had been on this street and somebody tried to sell services to me." He kept his voice down.
I can still feel his pulse.
"You like deduction?" John was curious about Sherlock.
The apartment did not have shower facilities. John contained a large pot of hot water for Sherlock, let him stand in the dish, sprinkled him with a water spoon to help him washing his body clean. Out of the doctor's habit, he checked his opening carefully, to make sure Sherlock had not been hurt.
"You've changed a lot." Sherlock's voice was so weak that just barely heard.
taking drugs because the Scotland Yard would not use any clues and evidence provided by a drug addict.
When Sherlock wanted to investigate deeper, he had to seek help from Lestrade and even Mycroft. With the help of Scotland Yard and the British Government, a large criminal group named "Moriarty" was found. Under the cover of the war, it quietly weaved a criminal network in London underground, involved in various crimes in all aspects. Lucky that it was uncovered during the embryonic stage, to prevent its expanding and its infiltration into the British government and among Europe and the United States.
“In fairness, Sherlock, you did do that yourself. And believe me when I say it was very convincing.” John said tightly, back on the sofa with Rosie bouncing in his lap.
Sherlock wondered whether John and Mary used to feel like that, when they… Did things together. Sherlock closed his eyes tightly against the thought. All those years of longing from a distance, dreaming of this happening. But the reality was horrible, cruel because Mary was dead, and that should never have happened. Dead because of him.
“Good morning, Rosie!” He cooed.
Sherlock hummed in affirmative. “John, get Mycroft on the phone. Lestrade, is there any way that archaeologist can identify the body? It could be another clue, somehow, or… I don’t know.” Sherlock shifted uncomfortably. He didn’t like not knowing. Surely a Victorian skeleton, rather than Victor’s skeleton… Wasn’t somehow a clue?
“Who said Victor was dead?” Euros questioned sweetly.
“She’s my daughter, Sherlock. It’s fine,” John replied, “Hello darlin’!” He cooed to Rosie as she stuck her arms in the air, wanting to be picked up. “Is Uncle Sherlock making you some milk, then?” He jokingly asked her, as though she would answer. He took her gurgle as confirmation. “Ah, I see.” He chuckled.
Obviously, the ideal milk for this stage of her development was breast milk, but that was no longer an option, for obvious reasons. Sherlock’s brow creased as he set about making the formula, a now well-practised recipe. He did his best but really, nothing he did would be enough to come close to replacing Mary, and it made him sad to think of Rosie when she grew old enough to question why she had two fathers and no mother.
Sherlock rolled onto his back, staring up at the ceiling above him. He breathed deeply, trying to slow his pounding heart. It had never felt like that with Janine. Nothing like that. Those cringe-worthy romantic notions of deep love and fireworks always used to make Sherlock scoff and turn his back, so it was with some internal conflict that he realised those metaphors were accurate. It did feel like that with John.
John suddenly started giggling, that same giggle that had emerged in the delighted adrenaline following their first chase round London, leaning against the wall at the bottom of the stairs to Baker Street.
“Not yet. I came straight here.”
“No, she hasn’t said anything to me,” He peered over his shoulder at the clock on his bedside table, “It’s only 9-o-clock anyway.”
“Nice to wake up of our own accord for once.” Sherlock smirked.
“- No.” Sherlock butted in.
“Sherlock-”
“So, if the bones belong to an as-yet-unidentified Victorian child, then where are Victor’s bones?” Sherlock asked, looking up to John in mutual confusion.
Sherlock smiled, and sat down beside John. The air was charged with words unspoken, but when John gently took his hand, and wordlessly put the One o Clock News on, the restlessness in Sherlock’s head ceased, and he relaxed against John’s side. Maybe Mary was right. They could get through this. *
Lestrade stormed down the hallway of New Scotland Yard with his phone clenched in his hand as it held it to his ear.
“Now, John. You’re the only idiot here.” Sherlock smirked.
The game is on...
“I’ll just be in bed, then.” Sherlock smiled at John.
“Never? Not even… With Janine?”
“Hiya, baby girl. It’s me.” Sherlock whispered to the struggling Rosie, pressing her soft, warm head beneath his chin.
“So… You killed Victor? Where did you hide his body?” Sherlock asked.
“Do shut up, John.” Sherlock replied sleepily.
“Euros, we have methods. We will get the truth out of you. Just help us. Please.” Mycroft said in a low voice.
She dragged herself closer to Sherlock so she could nestle against his chest. Sherlock automatically wrapped his arms around her small, warm body.
“Hello, Uncle Sherlock.” He greeted on Rosie’s behalf, waggling her hand in his direction in a poor imitation of a wave. But Rosie giggled at the pantomime, so Sherlock crooked his fingers at her and smiled, always pandering to her.
Building that flat-packed monstrosity had been… an experience. It was at the point when Sherlock found himself staring at approximately thirty different sized planks of identically coloured wood, and trying to match them to the a, b, c, d, or e sized planks in the instruction manual from IKEA, that Sherlock realised that perhaps his life had changed for good.
“Sherlock… Are you okay? What if Victor isn’t actually dead?” John asked tentatively, concerned but trying not to make the situation worse.
“Shh!” Sherlock shushed her, waiting for her developing hand-eye coordination to allow her to grasp the teddy. Eventually she managed to hold it tight enough not to drop it, allowing Sherlock to get back to making the milk.
The music was deafening. Pounding through his limbs as he moved towards the bar. All John needed was a familiar face, someone who knew what he’d been through and sympathised. Frasier gave him the warmest smile as he approached.
“John before you say anything can I please explain.” After carefully placing the violin back in its case, Sherlock began creeping closer and closer towards John, before stopping a foot away from him. John hadn’t felt the presence of a body, he hadn’t noticed others since Sherlock’s ‘death’ until now, until Sherlock himself was so close to him. He felt sick. It was getting too much. The water continued to boil hotter and hotter.
“John.” Sherlock was blind to where he was going with this but he knew he had to be careful, he knew John better than anyone and he knew all it took to set John Watson off was the wrong word.
John’s heart was pounding as his eyes darted up and down Sherlock’s features. John did not have long for his brain to catch up with what his eyes were seeing before Sherlock stopped dead, his lips ghosting John’s as he whispered,
“I’m simply stating that she does the Watson name no justice. A failed surgeon, a drug addict, homeless and some consider her a murderer…”
“Please.” John held his hands where they were. He tried to hold the gaze but Sherlock’s eyes burning into him was too much and he looked back towards the phone which was still buzzing. Sherlock couldn’t lose him. Fight Sherlock fight, is all he could repeat to himself as he gripped the older man’s thigh. Fight!
“John, I’m sorry. However, I do think it’s best she’s not there to embarrass you.” Sherlock stepped forward as John stepped back.
As he made his way out of the kitchen and towards the door he slipped his phone into his trouser pocket, leaned towards the coat stand to retrieve his signature cloak and -
It had been just over two years since January 15th and still John continued his daily rituals. “‘Mother accused of taking her son, five, with her on bank robbery’. Ridiculous, isn’t it? I mean what on earth goes through some parents’ head’s…” John trailed off his sentence as he looked up from the paper and at Sherlock’s dark green leather chair, a hint of a smile on his face as he awaited approval from the ghost of a man that lives in his memory. After several seconds, the upward curve on John’s face began to sink as he himself began to grip reality, just in time as well as he heard a soft, gentle and old voice call his name before entering regardless. John closed the paper quickly, leaned back and sideways glanced at the full cup of tea with a little milk and 0.5 cubic meters of sugar and begged Mrs Hudson would just ignore it.
“Gary,” Sherlock shouted “What’s happened?” Lestrade stopped and turned,
“Don’t answer it John.” Sherlock had pushed the door open lightly and was standing in the doorway, unsure of what to do with himself. Sherlock needed John to forgive him, he needed to know he still had one friend and no matter how hard it was going to be, Sherlock had to be the one to gain his colleague, his friendship, his trust back.
“I guess Mycroft fed you everything I’ve done since you’ve been gone.” John accused with annoyance, as he sacrificed the support his head was receiving in exchange with picking up his tea. John’s favourite tea had changed frequently what with Sherlock being gone all there was to do was drink it.
“No, but you are?” He meant for the comment to sound vicious and hurtful but he was tired of trying to be angry at Sherlock, he just needed him to see through his snide comments, he begged for Sherlock to be able read him.
“Thank you Nick.” Sherlock smiled at the old man who had practically been third parent to him.
******************************************************************************************************************************************************
John stood in fear. Fear that Sherlock would disappear and that he really was going insane. Fear that now he may have another chance with Sherlock it might not be real. Fear that Sherlock rejects his feelings but fuck that because Sherlock is standing in front of him. His warm, alive body filled with B Positive blood, two lugs, two kidneys, a liver and a fully functioning heart, as far as John could tell. John Watson is not scared of anything or anyone but he is terrified of showing weakness.
“Evening father, Happy New Year.” Sherlock had been cut off in the hallway, the kitchen was only a few steps away, he just had to get Rupert out the way, locate Molly and explain that he had ruined his whole relationship with John. No biggie.
“I…I…can’t…I just…” The boy suddenly averted his eyes away from John, leaning into the side the ear piece sat. Someone was talking to him.
“Yes.” He knew that if he was ever going to get John to listen to him he had to be patient and to be honest.
“No. But if I’’m being honest John it’s probably best she’s not there.” He flicked the page over.
He reached into his pocket to get his phone and call Sherlock, this seemed too serious for him to handle on his own. As he fumbled with his mobile, he heard the boy stammer “It’s t…t…too early. You s…said midnight.”
Greg looked at Molly, anxious “Is he on the phone?” She shrugged.
“Drama drama John. At least he’s alive and with you. Having said that I have been seeing this guy, Samuel, he works at the barbers down the road, you know the one next to Zara?”
“I’m afraid so. They haven’t got numbers yet just locations. I’m on the way to speak to Chief Inspector Harrison, I think he’ll want me at the explosion site.”
“Sherlock. Sorry mate I didn’t see you there. Didn’t even know you were here.” He clasped Sherlock’s hand in a quick shake. “Molly and I are needed, there’s been stabbings all over London nightclubs.” Molly’s head popped pout from the lounge door and she squeezed her way through the crowd towards them. The majority of the heads had all taken to finding a tv screen to gawk at instead of the little scene Sherlock and Lestarde had created.
John didn’t know what to do. Was this some sort of silly game some teenagers were playing? Was it much more serious? Pay attention John. Scan the room.
“There you are!” Rupert Holmes exclaimed, “Your mother told me you were here but I was stuck talking to her sister about Victoria getting into Woodbridge.You ok son?” Sherlock’s father. One of the brightest and most humble men he knew. Masters in all sciences, a Nobel Price and a doctor in Mathematics. He also liked the smell of freshly cut lemons and thoroughly enjoyed baking shows.
John, where are you? I need to see you. -SH
As he neared Baker Street however his mood began to drop as the sun hide behind grey clouds and he began to look up at the tall London buildings surrounding him, he began to remember. It struck him that there would be no Sherlock when he got back. There would never be a Sherlock at 221B ever again and John began to wonder if there was any point in living there without him. He rushed back through the Park and crossed the road too hastily, causing a black taxi to slam his breaks and sound his horn at John but he didn’t care. He needed to get back, he needed to change his life, to try and get over the death of his only ever real best friend.
“John,” he gently guided John’s chin towards him again with his spare hand, and forced their eyes to meet once more. Sherlock began to lean towards John while simultaneously edging John forward. Sherlock was millimetres away from John’s lips as he looked down directly at them, a weird feeling of arousal and emotions filled his stomach but he had to be brave, he had to do this for them, for John.
BREAKING NEWS: TWO MASS STABBINGS IN HOMOSEXUAL NIGHTCLUBS ACROSS LONDON. REPORTED EXPLOSION AT CLUB MM. OTHER NIGHTCLUBS AFFECTED REINBOW AND PEACH HAVAN.
“Let me get this straight,” John started as he pushed himself away from the cabinets and half a foot closer to Sherlock “Molly Hooper. Molly Fucking Hooper knew you were alive before me? BEFORE JOHN WATSON.” Tick. The water was ready.
“CLUB MM.” She whispered.
“Mother you must stop wearing such bright red lipstick, it doesn’t half age you.” Sherlock’s comment went un noticed by Camilla as her matching bright heels carried her towards her second son.
John’s phone was unlocked, his fingers scrolling down his previous messages until he found their last conversation. Here we go.
He finished his drink in one smooth motion, reached into his coat pocket to retrieve his wallet when someone caught his eye. He looked to his right and there, on the barstool next to him, sat a young brunette. He couldn’t have been any older than eighteen and sweat streamed down his face. The boy seemed anxious and completely disconnected from the world around him. John approached,
As always let me know, constructive criticism is more than welcome.
At that second, the tv flickered, all eyes turned including hers. The red banner ran along the bottom, the bright colour, burning her eyes. The hand that was on her arm slipped off and the boy was forgotten. She was too close. Too close she couldn’t read it. A few steps back and it read, clear as anything:
Greg stood. He wasn’t on call but this was awful. He had to help. Molly knew the A and E would be overran, sure she didn’t work up there but she was one hundred percent sure they hadn’t all made it.
“Happy New Year Mr Holmes.” Nicholas graced his way through the crowd and away from Sherlock.
John’s fingers stopped moving.
“I needed to fake my death John for so many reasons. Do you know how hard it’s been trying to think of ways to come back? I only did it this way because Molly said you’d be less likely to punch me and…” but before Sherlock could say anymore John had hitched onto his story. The kettle was making small eruption noises and began to jolt in its place.
“He’s not far behind, had some research at the lab he had to finish up on. Edinborough University sent him an urgent letter this morning requesting his help, something about a ‘Field Bazaar’” Sherlock looked up at his mother and knew that she could read him better than anyone. He pleaded with his eyes for her not to push.
Of course, Grandmama managed to escape the hospital and attend the world’s most over the top New Years Eve party but Molly Hooper was nowhere to be seen. Sherlock’s eyes scanned the vast, marble kitchen but he couldn’t locate her. He needed to find John and make amends. Before he even knew what he was doing his fingers had sent John a message.
The black door with the brass covered numbers and knocker flung over with a BANG as John was desperate to get out of the torrential rain that had attacked him with such force, only two hundred yards from his soon to be ex-home. But what John heard next stopped him in his tracks. He didn’t move from the door step, he didn’t dare enter the house as the notes from a violin played through his ears.
“Good evening. Breaking news for you now, three nightclubs have been what the police say ‘attacked’. The chief inspector of Scotland Yard has comment that these are not classed as acts of terrorism as present, but they are indeed focusing on the safety of civilians. If you are worried about a loved one then please call on…”
Sherlock stood by the impressive 221B windows, violin still in hand by his side. He had never wanted to hurt or keep this from John. He never wanted to fake his death and cause so much grief for one person. He did not know how to come back from this but he couldn’t lose John, not after knowing how it felt to be without him for two years, one week and one day.
“I know. I promise it’s not for long sweetheart.” She took a quick glance to either side of her son. The taxi had long since driven off ‘Where’s John? I thought he was coming this evening?”
The cab pulled up outside Mr and Mrs Holmes’ house, located in the beautiful, secluded part of Greenwich. The house was grand but didn’t boast. It stood tall amongst the suburban houses, each one still maintaining privacy.
The evening had started with general chat between the detective and the doctor; The occasional comment on a current case, John asking about what he should wear and Sherlock replying with a grunt as he mused over The Daily Mail.
“John! My dear God, is it really you?” Frasier worked as a bar tenderer at CLUB MM, a gay bar in which John spent most of his evenings after the fall. Frasier was a little younger than John, his hair a little blonder and his eyes a sour green. Neither had ever been romantically interested in each other but Frasier’s boyfriend had overdosed a year before the two met. He knew. Frasier understood why John would drink a bottle of whisky to himself and yet go home alone, every night. He understood the late, sleepless nights, too afraid to dream their loved ones were still awake. He understood everything and that’s just what John needed.
“Tisk tisk, what’s the boy done now?” He placed the bottle back in its location and served John the drink before turning to the till and placing him on tab number 221.
“What’s happened?” Lestrade steps forward as Sherlock looks up,
John sat on the edge of his bed, back up right, fingers intertwined together in a ball between his thighs, allowing the day’s events to wash over him. His phone continued to buzz on his bed side table but he didn’t need to look to know that it was Mary calling. But he didn’t want Mary. Things between Sherlock and him had been different leading up to the days before he faked his death what with John being the only human who believed Sherlock was innocent. They spent night after night together, planning how they were going to prove Sherlock was innocent but they didn’t look over the case files they had on ‘Richard Brook’ separately in their armchairs, no. They breathed each other’s air as they examined the case, sat tightly next to one another on the sofa. Their hands began to brush more frequently, Sherlock’s eyes began to linger on John for a lot longer than what was normal. But John didn’t know what Sherlock was thinking and Sherlock didn’t know how much John wanted, needed him. As John turned his head towards his luminous phone a gentle voiced coaxed him,
John looked down at where the boys hands were; firmly in his pockets. What was he doing?
“ …which of course means I had to spend a few nights in the cell but after the first one it was quite comforting really and I kind of miss it?” Molly’s had to paralyse her eyes as to ensure they didn’t roll right out of her skull and over the rug towards Greg Lestrade.
He placed himself on one of the red, leather barstools, coat and scarf still in place and smiled back at Frasier. “I’m afraid to say so.” John laughed a little awkwardly and looked down at his feet, knowing Frasier knew something was wrong. Without hesitation Frasier reached effortlessly for the bottle of 12 year old Dalmore, dropping a single ice cube in the bottom of a whisky tumbler.
“John.” His head immediately snapped back to Sherlock. “She’s no good for you.”
“My darling boy.” She reached a little on her toes to crane her arm around his curls, thankfully Sherlock was in need of human touch. He leaned down and into her warmth, his hands clasping around her waist. “Are you ok sweetheart?” She asked, tenderly, pulling away.
She, in all her life, had never been so bored. Molly stood by the grand marble fireplace that held the biggest flatscreen she had ever seen in her entire life. BBC one was on, the court down to the New Years was only a couple of hours away, that’s all she had left. A couple of hours. God she wanted to be in the kitchen. Not talking to this… this… person.
He didn’t want to jump to conclusions but all the years he’d spent serving his country he couldn’t help but think, this was organised. Was the boy being pushed to be apart of something he didn’t want to? Was he simply a lost boy in the world that terrorists picked apart and manipulated?
“That was Mycroft. I had him track John’s last known location from his mobile. 34 minutes ago at 30 Old Compton Street.” He looked at Molly.
“There was an explosion at CLUB MM and stabbings at REINBOW and PEACH HAVAN. Did you want to tag along Sherlock?” Molly had placed her jacket on and was pulling her long, brunette hair out from under it before giving it a quick shake so it fell naturally around her face.
No. No. “No” John claimed. The soft tune was so graceful to John’s ears and the way the music flowed through callused, talented fingers sounded like Sherlock. John knew this was it. He was deranged. He had lost his sanity.
It wasn’t long before he was lured into conversations with his aunts, uncles about his mindless, idiot cousins and all of their wonderfully dumb grandchildren. Some family friends held more of a conversation but nothing that excited Sherlock. He was starting to worry. He’d been at his parents for over an hour and nothing from John. Molly Hooper must be here somewhere, his mother and father both loved the doctor like she was one of their own.
He stood in place but looked all around him. They were defiantly being watched. Fraiser was busy serving, the dance floor, completely packed and a couple of men were standing behind the pair at the bar, just wanting to be served. Dammit John, find the target. Find. The. Target. NOW.
Sherlock knew he shouldn’t have mentioned anything. Of course he wasn’t embarrassed by John. He loved that man, he wanted a family and a life with that man. He just wanted what’s best for him. Idiot. How could he have been so stupid to say or even hint at such a horrible thing. He knew that all John needed to cool off were a few glasses of whisky, he’d drink up, get a cab to The Holmes’ for their annual New Years Eve party, they’d kiss and make up and he’d proudly show John off. He just needed a minute to himself. Him and John both knew this would be the case.
