What he had wanted to start with was how - no,
“Yeah, piss off” John says, covering Rosie’s ears with his hand. “Move over”
The fire is still on, and John only notices because he’s being pushed a little too close to it. Parts for a second even though he really doesn’t want to, his hands still flush against Sherlock’s bare skin, warm at his heaving ribs.
Although they touch fairly often, this is the first time for perhaps months that it’s been purposeful. The silence is quite deafening, and that anxiety Sherlock thought was on it’s way out comes creeping back in, crawling tiny fires through his veins and into the tips of his fingers as he works. It’s been a while since he’s had to tend to John like this – it’s only happened a handful of times before, and never on this scale. Case upon case Sherlock has turned down. Any he could predict inciting potential danger, including a good few the likes of which he may never come across again. So carefully he screened John’s emails to erase anything that could end up where they are right now. Yet still, somehow, the battered man in front of him managed to seek out harm and let it ruin his flesh.
John doesn’t want to falter – and so when Sherlock looks up, peels away from his chest and brings their eyes together, he doesn’t. He meets his gaze and all it means, drops his palm to the back of Sherlock’s neck again and holds him there.
Seven of the longest seconds John has ever counted go by before Sherlock looks at him again. Does not break eye contact as he touches him, turns and pushes John by the hips until his back hits freezing tile.
“I don’t see why not” The older man continues, straightening out his paper with one sure flick of his wrist.
John kisses the underside of Sherlock’s jaw, his neck and the protruding bone there, trying hard not to push too far in the heady rush of it. He finds those eyes, somehow brighter now despite the night time still going on around them, looking at him with a desire he has never seen so naked before.
John holds both hands up, retreating from Sherlock as they enter the living room. It’s all as it should be, the mess of the experiment he left still on the kitchen counter, despite everything around it being meticulously clean. The only item out of place is a grey throw, draped carelessly over his chair. Sherlock regards it as his fingers tighten against the black leather, seeking the support he brushed off from John moments ago. Waves of pain still trickle through him persistently, the pitiful amount of drugs they have him on are not nearly enough to achieve a satisfying high. The monochrome weave of cotton stares at him, an accidental clue to John’s recent sleeping habits.
Sherlock’s hands
The exhale through Sherlock’s nose is almost desperate as he swallows, gaze dragging from the shadows of their half-pressed bodies to John’s collarbone and finally his eyes, looking up at him through the curls on his forehead.
“What about this one?”
John shakes, feels the tremor scare the steadiness of his arm next to Sherlock’s shoulder. He remains upright somehow, forces the breaths through his chest as Sherlock begins to take his shirt off, every ghost of his fingertips brushing against the skin there making him tremble. Those dangerous eyes never leave John’s own, and all he can do is let it happen, find an anchor in Sherlock’s pupils as the man parts the shirt from his chest.
There are goosebumps on Sherlock’s bare arms where he’s rolled his sleeves up, neat tiny rows of them and John’s close enough to just reach the pads of his fingers out and read them like Braille, but he doesn’t. Doesn’t really need to because the hitch of Sherlock’s very pulse shockwaves through the room and John can hear the copper blood running through his startled veins, could take his mouth to them and trace every circulation of cells and oxygen if he so wanted, sees the threat of something simultaneously ruinous and terrifying, mirroring from his own eyes to Sherlock’s - and whatever he’s afraid of, John’s afraid of it too.
February is all round just shit. It rains almost every day, and though the melancholy is comfortable, the tide of boring cases brings with it a restlessness that sets Sherlock’s patience on edge. Either way, the weather does nothing to improve his mood when he leaves the therapist’s office.
The passing of minutes and hours is something Sherlock is now apt at counting. In Moscow, he’d learned the art of marking precise measurements of time, plotting his escape from the underbelly of an experimental bio lab by recording the movements of the security detail. Exactly three minutes and twelve seconds pass before John wakes again, the panic rapidly rising in Sherlock’s gut quelled by eyes slowly blinking open.
“Rosie. There’s Rosie “
“I want to stay,” It comes out as a single breath, weak from John’s lips. “Can I stay, please”
All he can do is circulate the stuffy air in and out of his lungs as John leans into him, the smooth of his chin coming to rest somewhere on Sherlock’s collarbone, face hidden in the curve of his neck. And although Sherlock can’t hear anything now but his own blood in his ears, can’t feel his own hands or feet on the ground because John’s breath is hot against his skin, it really is the best position to observe their suspect. Sherlock tries to focus, get his brain to pinpoint on the man opposite them instead of the one brushing his nose under his jaw.
fine” Sherlock corrects, rolling his eyes at John’s condescending brow.
“What’s the premise here, explain it to me”
“Sherlock, we’ve been here for nearly two hours. If I see another tree I’m going to cancel Christmas altogether”
“If that’s really what you want”
“You don’t” John says, not really a question because his fingertips are already tracing down Sherlock’s throat to his chest.
“Long day?” Sherlock asks, leaning against the doorframe with one arm.
“Oh for
“It caught me off guard, is all”
“I never have” Sherlock confesses.
Except it shouldn’t be. They should not have to do this. There should not be a world in which Sherlock is trembling with hurt, so much that John can feel it, breaking across his chest as Sherlock presses his forehead against it. Curls his torso towards John’s until hot breath warms the space there. John flattens his other palm gently along Sherlock’s shoulder blades and then to the back of his neck. Echoing a touch that he once felt, that brought him back from a peak of grief.
John thinks, but before he can voice the words he’s already answering himself; flattening his palms against Sherlock’s chest and mouthing the cotton of his shirt collar, it catches on his fleshy lips and he wonders if he’s strong enough to teeth open the buttons just there; break right through Sherlock’s rib cage to the heart of it all.
“I was asking what our tactic is here,” John continues, grabbing Sherlock’s arm to stop him, a few feet away from the bouncers. “I haven’t got my Sig”
Slowly, John stands. Pads over to the other side of the bed, naked in the morning light, and gestures for Sherlock to move up. He’s on his back again, but this time it’s not so painful when he stretches his right arm out, creating space for a taller frame to fit into.
It comes out much too fast and Sherlock reaches across the table to where he’s left the half bottle of spirit, drags his eyes across John from foot to face as he pours another glass for himself. The gold liquid reminds John of the sun and how it had shone down on him for a just a few precious weeks of white satin and neat flowers before forsaking him completely. His own glass is empty and for some reason still in his hand, such a meaningless thing that it feels ghostly in his fingers. It’s strange how senseless everything seems in the dark of night; how utterly void it is with the knowledge he’s been living such an incomprehensible life, months and days and hours and minutes of deception.
With hesitation he curls a hand around the suspiciously blue looking drink John has bought him, and darts his eyes around the crowd, unable to pick out any face that matches the description of their suspect. Suddenly everything is a little bit too much. Sherlock can feel sweat prickling at his brow and the stimulation of so many people in a relatively small space is beginning to make him feel sick.
The words are so quiet and slowly formed from John’s mouth that he barely hears them. But they are resolute.
The centre of his vision begins to crackle and darken, the machine next to him hisses gently and lulls Sherlock back into unconsciousness. The ghost beside him disappears, and he succumbs to sleep.
Most of the time John is sad, so Sherlock stays on his side of the living room and picks up Rosie only when she crawls towards him.
of Sherlock’s lungs. Every bit of his own fear is suddenly trivial, as he crawls his fingers out to one side until he reaches Sherlock’s bare arm. The skin there is wet, and tacky, the residue thick between John’s fingertips as he rolls them together.
John curses in between kisses, doing his best to keep every part of his torso off Sherlock’s chest, appearing as if doing so is the most difficult task he’s ever faced. And Sherlock knows the feeling, wants John’s lips on every part of him, scars included. The fresh desecration below his ribs does not agree though, protesting with every small movement. John finally finishes work on his shirt buttons, gently parting the cotton with the softest of touches.
John’s about to lose his actual mind. Not only is he finding out after all this time that their taxi bills could have been cut in half, but now ‘shepherd’ has been added to the list of potential careers the man could have had. Pirate was bad enough.
Not too far away John can hear voices, families and friends emerging from the warmth of the building behind them. Sherlock suddenly squeezes John’s shoulder enough to hurt, he winces with the pressure of it but does not let up his pace, the movement of his hand fast and slick along Sherlock’s length. Fingers pull his chin up and Sherlock meets his gaze –
Her apparition starts to fade away, blonde curls becoming transparent. Sherlock struggles in the confines of his broken body and groans, searching for something that simply isn’t there.
They’d been so close to leaving the warehouse unseen. Mere steps away from the exit before the security brute had turned back and caught them pressed against the concrete wall. John can’t quite remember what happened after that, the thrum of pain on his forehead carrying the imprint of a boot, no doubt. An undertow of dread begins to creep through John’s veins, the very real and immediate danger they’re in becoming painfully apparent.
John shakes his head but laughs a little regardless, tongue in his cheek as he replies.
“It seems I misjudged the situation,” Sherlock continues, prompted by the long stretch of quiet. “I thought it best to give you some time. It was my mistake, to assume –“
And then, as the look on John’s face pales to instant panic –
There are many reasons John should not lift himself from the floor to the bed, and he ignores them all. Obvious things that the both of them are aware of and wilfully ignorant of, have actually been carefully stepping around for months now, trying not to tip the dominos for fear they will fall the wrong way. It’s Sherlock’s fault this time though, offering something he knows John doesn’t have the strength to refuse. John takes the other side of the bed, keeping his limbs as tight to his torso as he can.
Small fists open and close in front of his face, asking to be lifted into Sherlock’s embrace. The hospital bed is too high for her short frame, and the pain crackling through Sherlock’s side prevents him from bending any further. John rises from his chair and circles to her side of the bed, picks her up in his arms so she can at least be level with her favourite person.
“You got him a little bit” Sherlock shrugs, offering a small smile.
Oh, and
Sherlock’s eyes blink back open again with the sound of the kettle coming to a boil. John pours their drinks and doesn’t wait long enough for it to brew, adds a splash of milk to something that now resembles dish water more than tea. Not that it matters much. He hands one to Sherlock who puts it down immediately, just as John settles his own onto the side table and sinks down into his armchair.
Sherlock looks up at him like he’s not really there. As if his eyes are an open door into memories that have long been locked away. For the longest time Sherlock doesn’t speak, his face glazing over while he flits through dusty files in his mind. John doesn’t disturb the tension. Doesn’t reach for his weak tea or allow himself to breathe too loudly. Just waits.
“My brother thinks he’s funny, that’s the problem” Sherlock huffs, gesturing at the still closed door.
Sherlock obliges immediately, greedily moving his hand to a steady rhythm, attempting to appear less desperate than he is. He can feel John’s smile against his skin, small and knowing and it’s driving Sherlock mad as he tries not to buck up into his own hand.
The cursive silver sign above the door reads
“You absolute child” John laughs, as Sherlock climbs in with his trousers and shirt still on, displaced water spilling over the rim and onto the lino.
He doesn’t need to look at the man to tell he’s tightly wound, can feel it like delayed static bouncing off his shoulders, reverberating off the walls and against his own buzzing skin. There’s only so much room for such electricity though, and Sherlock snaps, lobs a teaspoon across the counter and kicks it for good measure, the clattering of steel on lino makes John’s teeth clench.
Sherlock lets his eyes flutter closed as the path John is drawing along his jaw reaches his neck, thumb dancing over his pulse point and to his open shirt collar.
“That isn’t what we need at all” Exhaled, as Sherlock takes two strides to stand before him, chest heaving and eyes darting between here and some far away space, and drops to the floor.
They stay in each other’s arms for a little longer, John massaging the embossed skin at Sherlock’s wrists while he simply watches, unable to look away from the man he would so easily give his life for.
“There must be another exit,” John says, removing himself carefully from Sherlock’s lap all too easily. “Let’s go”
With that, the fingers at the small of his back press Sherlock in the direction of a free booth to their right, thankfully well placed enough that they can view most of the other tables without having to look too suspicious. Similarly, the men seated around them can also stare in return, something John is seemingly aware of, as he sits as close to Sherlock as possible.
Sherlock can’t even remember what the antagonist is supposed to be doing or has done, now. Case details have dropped from his mind and all he’s concerned with is the slowly building fire in his belly, the churning in his stomach that nearly makes him want to throw up.
The ride back felt long and empty. Greg didn’t press them for official statements, so they didn’t give any. Ducked into the nearest police car and left Musgrave in a blur, exhausted and unconscious to the world outside.
In the kitchen, the dishes have been done and the surfaces around Sherlock’s microscope wiped clean. They must have had takeaway without him, there are only two plates and a plastic cup drying on the rack. At the thought of food Sherlock’s stomach growls, and he realises it’s been several hours since he last ingested anything but nicotine.
“It’s a straight shot across that field, should only take thirty, forty minutes at your pace” Mr Holmes gestures. “You can’t go wrong”
The words bite at John’s face before Sherlock can stop them, his need for pain relief now outweighing any sense of social politeness. Immediately he regrets his choice of words though, as the man in front of him finally meets his eyes, and Sherlock flinches at the naked hurt there.
Patience pays off, and John moves his hand around to undo Sherlock’s trousers. They shift awkwardly, John anchoring Sherlock’s hips up so he can ease them down his legs. Water sloshes over the edge of the bath, but neither give it any attention. His feet are now trapped in tangled cotton. All at once he feels embarrassingly exposed, naked and obviously wanting between John’s legs.
for so long he can’t remember and Sherlock deserves it, now more than he ever has.
Though the words leave his lips they get a bit lost in the stitch of Sherlock’s shirt, get weakened and sound almost like he’s asking to believe it, a poor excuse for something that he could never be acquitted for.
to the list of shitty things in his head.
that -
“What was he like –” John pauses, wonders if he should even speak at all. “Do you remember him, at all?”
so, bruise bearing fists to the sternum, all black and hot over his face, a trickle of delicate dark pooling in the shell of his ear - but he is, this time. And no, he can barely move when they’re done, yet he will live, and John still manages to grip his arm tightly shaking, somehow guides him away from the brightly open doors of an ambulance and into a cab; the bitter London air tainted with the alcoholic breath of its previous passengers, the
“Shit,” John whispers into his ear. “Right, hang on”
“Right” John sighs, arms static by his sides, hand suddenly missing the empty bottle of whisky.
The sweet vibrations of a whimper from breathy throat to the shell of John’s ear and he does - he does drown, swallows gallons of dark water; comes in Sherlock’s hand and shakes and shakes, reaches a palm to the solid door behind to anchor himself, keep him conscious as he works Sherlock harder - “
Rosie is likely asleep, so he treads lightly on the stairs, taking them two at a time. Their door is ajar, but when Sherlock gently pushes it open the living room is empty, the only light coming from the kitchen. Warm yellow spills across the carpet, picking out the debris. An empty mug, newspaper neatly folded next to it. Several of Rosie’s toys strewn about the floor, a smear of porridge on the arm of Sherlock’s chair from their particularly messy breakfast that morning. John had told them off for playing, but he was only half serious, smile creeping into the edges of his stern eyes.
him - it can’t be like this. Sometimes they still can’t even stand to be in the same room for more than twenty minutes. How then would they redeem themselves after this, both taking advantage of the other for a few moments of relief. This isn’t how it’s supposed to be, bathed in hurt and torment.
Fuck, because somehow those inches have been forgotten and Sherlock is pressing against him, the fine cotton of his shirt sticking to the damp of John’s back. The plane of skin his mouth has been travelling has ended, and once again he's stuck trying to find his reflection in John’s eyes. They are more opaque than ever. He falters, halted by the invisible line between their lips. Once he’s tasted them, there’s no going back to pretending he hasn’t. All pretence and years of friendship will be over.
He gives in, a little. Allows his chin to dip and find the crown of Sherlock’s head. The cushion of it brushes against John’s three-day shave. At his chest, Sherlock flattens out his hands, releases the bundles of cotton between his knuckles and brackets the plane of John’s ribs instead. Each exhale sounds loud now. John lets his own puff out into Sherlock’s hair, open mouthed breaths and lips against soft inky black.
“I’ve had Stanley make preparations for you both on the west wing” He announces, looking over their shoulders to the burgeoning storm outside.
“Well what’s the truth then”
“Did we at least solve the case?” Sherlock offers, attempting to break the quiet.
Until he saw Sherlock there. Silhouetted against the full moon of the well mouth, waiting for him to climb back out again.
“I think I’ll turn in for the night, actually” Sherlock decides, pushing the iPhone back into his pocket and straightening slightly.
memory stick so what am I supposed to do with all that, hm?"
“Been...” Sherlock gestures to the table with the length of his hand, gaze still fixed on John. “...busy”
“Mm. You, too.”
The heat from the fire is overwhelming as he stands in front of her, and John wishes he were anywhere else but here. Mary smiles, a hand on her pregnant belly. John takes a breath and begins.
There’s no real use in protesting so John follows, vaguely familiar with the layout of the place from the last time they were here together. No out of work actors lurking in the shadows this time, just doors leading to unused rooms and stuffy collections of relics that never leave their display cases. It still hangs between them all, secrets and childhood traumas in the darkness of a well. Sherlock goes to Sherringford and returns, and John does his best not to ask too many questions. Simple, and like most things between them, not at all okay.
Turns out, he doesn’t have to decide. The darkened window of a flashy car rolls down as it pulls up to the kerb, and John doesn’t hesitate to yank the passenger door open.
The fingers twisting in that Belstaff tighten as he takes more of Sherlock’s thumb into him, oxygen forcing from his lips as his muscles get used to the intrusion. Breathy curses are tumbling into the nape of his neck as Sherlock works, and John realises he must be watching himself, that digit disappearing inside of John with more ease now. The control of the other man not to be touching himself is enviable, John can almost taste the want vibrating from Sherlock’s bones, expletives turning to moans as the tight ring of muscle lets him in.
The moment is broken as Sherlock stands, somehow strong and together even though John can feel everything fracturing apart around them. Immediately there’s a hand at his jaw, framing his face and pulling him forwards, bumping chests and a second of imbalance until John finds Sherlock’s hip. Tugs and braces the other at his lower back, shirt sticky from exertion and wrinkling from John’s desperate fingers.
Before he knows it, the blurry figure of Sherlock comes into view, unmistakable curls getting caught by the soft winter breeze. Snow has fallen here, it sticks to the grass in odd patches, the crunch of it jolting as John makes his way to the summit.
have a child and though the foundations are already rotten, there’s no ounce of John’s soul that could ruin the fragile family he’s built around himself. Even if it means losing his heart again.
John jolts out of the black hole of sleep that had been gently dragging him down, immediately alert out of habit. Sherlock is suddenly very close and leaning over the edge of the bed, looking down at him with knitted eyebrows.
As Sherlock rises up a little John meets him, pushes forward through the opaque air and wraps a sure hand around his neck, waits for nothing but the smallest nod of the man’s chin before he presses their mouths together; pushes through tongue first because he needs to taste every part of this, taste buds hungry and teeth aching for something substantial. Sherlock replies in kind, hands rooted to the crease where John’s thighs meet his pelvis, the tremble of them vibrating straight to John’s cock.
Instinct, then, is his only weapon. That inch or two of distance between them now is critical. If he so wanted, Sherlock could close it with his hips and push until John’s pelvis meets the table. Tempting, but too much. Settles instead, for playing his fingertips along tarnished ribs until they come to rest on John’s thinned out waist. He’s not been eating enough, in between running around after Rosie and following Sherlock’s fast pace. For a moment he’s side-tracked by recalling each time he’s seen John have a meal over the last few weeks, not many at all. And then he remembers where he is and what he’s doing and how one wrong move could bring down the hollow foundations they’ve been building under themselves.
Yeah, he’s irritated now. The situation is beyond uncomfortable and Mycroft has a knack of making his blood boil even on a good day. All he wants to do is find Sherlock and make things right and he doesn’t want help from the jumped up idiot next to him, but. He has to admit, his clues so far as to Sherlock’s location amount to a resounding zero.
“No, no I didn’t” The man denies, clenching and unclenching his fists one finger at a time, back hunched with regret. “I watched you die, for the third time”
The stolen wallet somehow ended up under the bed. Sherlock finds it after a few seconds of John frantically trying to remember what he did with it. They manage to straighten out the bedsheets and smooth out their hair just before the sound of footsteps echo outside. Mycroft and Greg undo the latch, stepping into the room flanked by three other officers, clearly expecting to find the suspect apprehended.
Yet again they’re balanced on the edge. Sherlock is atop Bart’s, one step away from the street below. John is sat in his kitchen, a note, glass of whisky and his gun on the table. Fragmented men trying to piece the other back together, breaking more parts as they go. The truth has rarely appeared between the two of them. How can it, when they spend most of their time constructing impenetrable mazes around themselves, dead ends of guilt and memory, until they’re both so boxed in neither can remember the way out. They’ve both lied and been lied to so much, it’s hard to face the possibility that truth may be the only thing left.
Not really comforting, but better than nothing. John follows Sherlock up the stairs as he takes them two at a time, struggling as always to keep up with the man’s lithe frame. A row of what he assumes are original paintings line the corridor, and John stops momentarily to study them a little closer. They’re all relatives he’s sure, generations of Holmes immortalised in oil. He doesn’t stall too long though, because Sherlock and his guiding light are drifting out of sight.
Before Sherlock can form a sentence, John’s gathering the first aid off the table and takes his bloodied shirt from the counter where it lies atop drying dinner plates. The cold between them is instant and vast. Sherlock wants to grab his arm and stop him, say he was wrong, they’re both wrong, they can do this even if it’s only for tonight. But he doesn’t. Instead he watches his heart walk towards the bathroom. John doesn’t look back as he closes the door behind him.
“This is for you” Are the words whispered in the shell of Sherlock’s ear, hot and breathy and bringing moans from his own lips.
He’s so ridiculously tall, even folded nearly in two, that John has to tip his chin up a little to reach Sherlock’s eyes. Really he should let go, but like most moments in his life he can’t seem to. The needle is stuck and the edges of the room are starting to splinter like static. Whatever is coursing down his spine only intensifies as Sherlock meets his gaze.
“Mycroft won’t miss it, he has two more of the same vintage”
“As much as I want to stay here,” John begins, pulling his body away from the pillow of Sherlock’s shoulder. “I don’t really fancy being stark naked when Greg and your brother show up”
John doesn’t waste a breath before he replies, words shaking out on the tails of an exhale. Maybe it’s the truly ridiculous surroundings, or the intimacy of sharing a bed with a storm shouting against the manor walls, but he can’t quite stop himself. Can’t find the energy to, anymore.
John steps through and keeps their eyes locked because he can’t look down past Sherlock’s chest just yet. Years he’s spent telling himself he doesn’t want any of this – not this kind of body, lean and muscular – and John doesn’t have a clue what to do. Can’t find any hidden part of himself that knows how to deal with the knowledge he’s been wrong all this time. He’s been lying to himself, because he certainly does fucking want this. Has said so, out loud, like it was easy. And now in the fresh light of the bathroom, it seems more difficult than it ever has.
“Do it ourselves?” He repeats. Sherlock hates repeating things.
The drop into the cellar is a little deeper than it first appears, but eventually John reaches the bottom. Almost darkness gives way to a dull light, an old-fashioned oil lamp perched on the wall to his left. The warm yellow ebbs across a large cellar, dancing over barrels of whisky John is sure are worth ten times his pension, bottles of wine stacked in neat rows from floor to ceiling the length of the opposite wall. It must be at least the size of Baker Street’s living room, if not bigger. Sometimes John forgets just how much money the Holmes family has. Sherlock lives a humble life considering.
“Leave the child with your landlady” Mycroft drawls, looking Rosie up and down as if she’s a particularly undesirable dog.
is on its way; speeding here in the wires of a defibrillator, in the drip of an IV, in the form of all the things that Sherlock cannot provide.
He is empty, though. John’s mouth can’t form any words that haven’t already been said, that wouldn’t be meaningless against the tirade of hurt and betrayal and heartache currently churning inside the man in front of him.
Sherlock can see why not. Can feel it, tremble once along the muscle of his arms as he brackets his hips in consideration. They’re good, right now. Finally. After months of apologies and clipped words, John treading carefully in his shadow like Sherlock could disappear again at any moment. He explained, giving as many truths as he could without telling him everything, and John still hated him for a bit. For a good while longer than Sherlock had predicted. Then eventually, on an unsuspecting Tuesday, things shifted again. Hunched over a microscope, he’d only noticed John’s presence in the lab at Bart’s when a box of noodles was shoved under his nose. It nearly ruined his experiment but John was there, willingly, in the building he thought he’d watched his friend jump from. Not smiling, but not looking like he wanted to run, either.
, curses as the blade edge of it cuts into the fine layer of skin on his forefinger.
He could probably phone Molly or ask Mrs Hudson to take care of Rosie, but the time apart seems too critical in that moment. John needs the stability his daughter offers, the reassurance of her small smile that means everything is okay and he’s doing the right thing. Because he’s not sure if he is, actually. John has no idea what he’s going to say, or do, or how he’s going to explain what a complete dick he’s been. Again.
Sherlock’s throat is hoarse and deep and rumbles straight to John’s belly as he laughs low against him, hooks thumbs over the waistband he’s been toying with for the last few minutes. John feels the tug as Sherlock pulls open the first button, has to abandon wrestling with his own shirt collar to steady himself on Sherlock’s biceps.
“I never have” Sherlock confesses, swallowing against the sudden dryness in his mouth.
When he wakes once during the early hours, John finds his world tilted sideways, his head somehow on Sherlock’s chest. It’s uncomfortable and his abdominals hurt but he finds he can’t move, too caught by the heat of the body beneath his own.
For a second, he worries if maybe that’s the wrong question.
John has the foresight to angle the cock in his hand against his own still clothed chest, as Sherlock comes undone, staining the cotton there with his eyes burning into the ceiling and his mouth parted. Sherlock takes in each throe of pain that bursts alongside his pleasure, drowning in the onslaught of feeling. He dances in it for a few moments, resting his chin on the head nestled carefully into the plane of his neck, John’s torso still hovering centimetres above Sherlock’s battered chest.
“Ow, Jesus Christ” John hisses as a particularly lively arm of needles springs back into his face.
Darkness is falling too, which doesn’t help. They had all been a bit too involved in hearing the case details, crowding around a laptop while the elder Holmes recounted the sordid tale. Time had been lost. This one had all the hallmarks of a good nine though – jealous ex-wife, missing mistress and another member of the Royal Family up to no good. Certainly the level of juice needed to generate a few thousand hits on the website, even if John had to change some details here and there. The lure of it had been enough that they had dropped everything else back in London, and John had called in another favour from Molly, who was fast becoming Rosie’s favourite person on Earth.
because it would somehow make it easier if Sherlock was broken, just a little, too.
Sherlock’s shaking against him, his whole body pushed so close to his own that John fears if he listened hard enough he could hear his own name threading through Sherlock’s tendons, could note the sound of heat and desire it makes as it courses through his blood.
And he would know. Sherlock would
He settles for, finding that it’s not a question at all, that his voice fills the room quite suddenly with a tension that wasn’t there seconds ago.
Sherlock takes the hint, removes his shirt in the time it takes John to sit back an inch and blink, then returns the favour; opens John up like he does every day, slow, one measure of self-control being peeled away with each loosened button. Baker Street is cold, raises the hairs on his arms, but that’s okay because Sherlock’s eyes are dancing over his exposed flesh like he doesn’t know where to look, and
“This is – incredible”
Somehow, impossibly, Sherlock moves his hips and John feels the proof of everything he’s been wanting grind into his pelvis. John bites his lip and shifts, grips his hands either side of Sherlock’s ribs and angles him down again, until their foreheads touch and their zips meet and both are left fighting for the same oxygen.
“Let’s steal and run then” He says through the pounding in his ears, grabbing a bottle of whisky for good measure as he heads back to the staircase.
“You can’t be serious, John” Sherlock snaps, as John opens his mouth to suggest the gigantic mass of needles to his left.
John doesn’t know what to say. Sherlock takes his hand and this time cleans it on his trouser leg, takes each individual finger and wipes the evidence off. His eyes are blurry and hurt, and all he can do is watch Sherlock do up both their trousers. John’s still pressed into him, forehead in the crook of his neck and clutching at sweat dampened chest like he’s about to disappear.
“I’m just trying to –“
“Cheeky,” John smiles, laughing a bit too, even though his mind is buzzing and crashing and still not quite believing where he’s stood. “I’m using your fancy body wash”
“Sherlock –“ John calls, pressing his hand to the rough stone wall for balance as he climbs slowly down into the shadow.
The sheets are crisp and white, they feel like snow beneath Sherlock’s cold cheek. Everywhere is quiet, dead. John is here, with his hair so clean and his smile so warm.
And there’s nowhere to hide from this blunt desire. He won’t blame it on adrenaline or anger or some kind of sick revenge for the deceit of his wife, because he’d be lying to himself and what exactly is the point of that? John’s here to escape, here because he wants Sherlock and he always has, and somehow they’ve grown so far apart that he can barely remember the smell of Sherlock’s sweat and he should - god damn, he should.
“Here, take these”
“Sorry” He winces, noticing Sherlock’s patient face. “Haven’t, um – shared a bed, for a long time”
Maybe Sherlock will move and it will be another moment of intimacy they’ll pretend is normal. Their closeness recently has been like an old worn jacket, comfortable and familiar, and John has been wearing the skin of their friendship like a shield against everything else. That back and forth was incredibly easy to pick up again, lingering ghosts slowly fading like the scars on Sherlock’s cheek from his misplaced anger.
One of them should say something, John thinks again, but that’s as far as it gets. Just a thought, because Sherlock is still fucking kissing him, making small panting noises that John wishes he’d never heard and also wants to hear for the rest of time. Maddening sounds that make his hands pull the shirt from Sherlock’s trousers, seeking contact, skin beneath his palms as he slides them up and beneath cotton.
“There’s time” Sherlock settles on, one last flick of his eyes up and down John’s torso before he drinks.
“What were you thinking” He starts, a fist against the kitchen table taking the brunt of his restrained anger.
“Nope, just something about picking up a last minute gift”
The memory stick in his pocket feels heavy. John heads downstairs to his wife, not yet knowing what decisions he has made. Whatever happens, it will never be the same as it was.
When he breaks over it, Sherlock moans with him, echoes every breath panting from John’s lips. His palms are still resting either side of Sherlock’s wet face, thumbs tracing the cut of his cheekbones. John kisses him, the tip of his nose and the space above his cupid’s bow, soft eyelashes that have fluttered closed with exertion.
“The hunter, um, strong and intelligent, he um” John shifts, a whispering squeak of damp grass against his jacket, attempting to move the numb from his bones, arms tight at his shivering sides.
“You live with me” Sherlock interrupts, throwing his arms wide so their elbows bump softly together.
of the killer’s wrist, of the bullet that’s now lodged between John’s fragile, barely breathing ribs.
John’s grip slips from Sherlock as he finishes behind him, lips pressed to his shoulder. That hand moves instead to squeeze the edge of the bathtub, the sound of his fingers slipping against the porcelain loud in the small bathroom. Sherlock feels him peak and wane through the pleasure, drinking in the breathy moans coming from John’s mouth.
When he can resist sleep no longer, John slips away with Sherlock’s breaths puffing against his face. Nothing paints his unconscious but space, a black emptiness that swallows almost everything. The only light comes from the man he now knows is his, a chaos of cosmos and elements that somehow gives John hope. There’s no order or predictable path he can follow, but there’s gravity. A force he can depend on. John can orbit around the fixed point sleeping next to him, and that is all he needs.
“Sherlock?” He calls into the suddenly never-ending shadow.
The teetering pile of stuff he’s been trying to ignore is so high he can’t see a way over it anymore. Sherlock came back from his grave, so long ago now that the stabs of pain have turned into a steady dull ebb, clinging to John’s bones like dying marrow. But then he nearly fell right back into it again, actually flat-lined into unimportant nothingness for whole minutes that John still can’t quite comprehend, hasn’t yet transferred the seconds from hazy memory into reality. He’s given his name to a wife he cannot touch without flinching, her face and body still warm and soft and inviting yet utterly repulsive; with lies seeping from the pores of her skin and the imprint of a gun in her palm and they’re having a
He managed to swallow it though. Just like everything else.
–She commands, arms folded and eyes cold –

this year, and generally that involves being around for your daughter instead of chasing the coattails of a consulting detective. John hadn’t bargained on the weather, though. The stuffy looking man on TV this morning had promised a shower of delightfully seasonal snowflakes, not a full-on wintery blizzard. John had sworn to be back for tea time.
The smooth weave of Sherlock’s cotton shirt is warm and real as John presses his forehead against it. Has to, really, because looking up means finding that face all open and raw and full of things that fit there so ironically; lines of hurt and joy and what John now recognises as love (love most of all) creasing Sherlock’s eyes and forehead, parting wordless lips. John can feel the sharp of a collar bone beneath his brow and he digs it in harder, tries to remind himself who he is and why this was never a good idea (not then, when everything was honeyed adrenaline and simple, and certainly not now with everything so tangled and sticky with web that neither of them can find the right path out).
“You need to keep still, Sherlock” John instructs him, carefully placing one firm hand on Sherlock’s hip.
He’s never heard Sherlock speak French before. Bit of German here and there, Russian surprisingly often, but never a language so soft and delicate that it makes John’s pulse skip. Perhaps it’s the lack of oxygen down here and the fact he’s spent more time around Sherlock recently than he has for years, but a shiver trembles treacherously across the back of his neck. It reminds John of that first case all those years ago, the same feeling he had when Sherlock read the dead body in front of them both and deduced her entire life in a single breath. Beautiful and thrilling and eerie at the same time, full of possibility. A welcome ghost of appreciation John had almost forgotten he was capable of. He swallows.
They head back inside, Sherlock’s arm thrown around Rosie’s shoulders as he directs her to the kitchen. The two of them finish off preparing the banquet while John entertains their new family member, tempting him away from the overly decorated Christmas tree with one of Sherlock’s slippers.
because his doctor is flitting in and out of consciousness; his doctor is someplace far, far away whispering things to Sherlock that Sherlock can’t hear, can’t understand right now, he cannot reach, cannot pull him back - and he is worth nothing, Sherlock’s mind is worth
John moves his hand to the pen, turns it around in his fingers once or twice. Leaving a note means leaving a bit of himself behind, a clue in case he needs to find his way home. With a deep breath that reaches his shoulders, John picks the sticky paper from the fridge, he flattens it and -
so Sherlock does, and they spend the night in the silent spaces between time and darkness. In some other dimension they talk about old cases, relive private jokes they will no longer share, discuss the past and the memories and anything but the now; the present and the future than John can’t distinguish or fathom in the sheets of Sherlock’s bed. They don’t touch, though. Not again. Not even when night is becoming morning and he can’t quite keep his eyes open anymore. Not even when he’s asleep and Sherlock is still bright as day, and could do whatever he so pleased. Never again, because they’re addicts and quitting cold is the only way.
“I thought I could carry on, without this,” He continues, as any composure Sherlock has left rapidly falls away. “But I can’t, I need you too much. Need to touch you, and taste you –“
He’s about to open his mouth and profess the triviality of the dried blood there, but Sherlock’s words crumble yet again in his throat. John cups a palm under his chin and presses lightly to the wound with the pad of his thumb, watching for any signs of pain on Sherlock’s face. He shows none, only blinks at the sudden touch.
John feels the wet salt from his eyes only when Sherlock's cheek brushes his, the hot of it terribly loud against his skin. Lips and deft hands go still against him in the half-light and for the first time he feels like a stranger, some other person who doesn't belong in London or Baker Street, and certainly not in Sherlock's open and willing heart.
“Tell me if it’s too much” John whispers into his ear.
Tenderness bleeds from his lips to John’s, gratitude and relief all pressing to soft flesh. Never had Sherlock imagined it would be like this and so quickly, and he sees the same disbelief in John’s eyes too. Really though it shouldn’t be so surprising, they’ve been building towards this for years and the missing days Bart’s rooftop stole from them have only served as a painful interlude in a journey that was already mapped out.
They escape the cellar and Sherlock takes them to the other side of the mansion, far away from Mycroft and his office. Snow flurries outside, collecting on the corners of the window panes in small mountains. Definitely no chance of getting back to London, then. If not for the foreboding presence of Mycroft lurking somewhere and the bitter draught running through the place, it would be quite festive. Beyond the pale vista John can pick out hills and a line of forest, little lights where families are settling down for the night, cosy in their picturesque surroundings. Sherlock leads them through several rooms, walking so quickly John barely has chance to taken them in. Just as he thinks there can’t possibly be any more, the other man stops. Sherlock reaches for a key behind a dead looking houseplant and opens the door to what should be the outside.
“He’s leaving,” Sherlock breathes, swallowing the heart threatening to burst from his chest. “We need to follow him”
, how can he do that when he’s so torn; when he’s now realised his choice to move on from Sherlock in his absence was not a choice at all, he never made it and never let any part of him go, and now everything he grieved for could be a reality - except there’s a child, he
“I was going alphabetical” John replies, clearing his throat as Sherlock has a second mouthful.
But he can’t. Sherlock can’t turn the needle over between his fingers, can’t tighten and loosen his belt around his bicep repeatedly until the temptation evaporates. There can be none of that, because John and Rosie are there.
Sherlock looks more relaxed than John has seen him for a good while. His collar is open and he’s moved both socked feet onto the sofa, eyes closed as John walks back into the living room. From the back of an armchair he grabs a couple of woollen throws, places one softly over Sherlock’s outstretched body.
“Sherlock –”
Sherlock knows he’s fallen asleep, because everything is too easy.
“I’ll be long gone by then,” The blonde man sings, closing the door behind him. “Tell Mister Townsend it was fun, but I’m onto bigger and better things”
“What exactly do you think this is?” He asks, trying to keep his tone light around the rock in his belly.
So he waits. He waits with John’s blood everywhere, with John’s very being cradled in his lap and veins pulsing faintly. Sherlock wants to say so many things, right now, so, so many, but John is not here to listen to them, may not
Sherlock finally says, though John decodes it through the vibrations in his chest, the low shake of his skin.
He’s cheating on his wife. Mary and their baby.
John wants to say
“He was my best friend, John”
Perhaps a slight buzz in John’s system will ease the mild anxiety he’s failing to hide. The assertiveness he’d displayed back at Baker Street a few days ago seems to have faded away now the situation is upon them. Sherlock hums his agreement and gestures towards the entrance to the club, the bright purple neon glow beckoning them in.
John’s breath huffs out of his nose in short bursts, bringing his heart rate back down as he relaxes a a little in Sherlock’s grip. He nods his compliance, and the hand slips from his mouth.
Only he’s holding on firmly this time. John’s hands are bloodied and burned from twisting the rope in his grip – but he’s got it. He’s found it again. In the sure press of Sherlock’s lips, and the truth birthing from his mouth to John’s own.
Sherlock’s head slides away eventually and comes to rest on the wall above John’s shoulder, hands curling around his back. They stay like that for a while, John puffing air across the horizon of Sherlock’s collarbone, fingertips dancing across the raised skin patterning the back of his ribs.
When he catches up to him around the next corner, Sherlock is rattling a door handle, irritation itching at the shadows of his face. The adjacent room is open, so John peers in. A large four poster bed sits in the middle of what appears to be a fairly sizable bedroom, the rest of the furnishings swallowed by the darkness.
When they hit the early morning light of London everything came swimming back and John almost, very nearly, emptied his guts onto cold pavement.
The steam is beginning to disappear, and Sherlock recaps where he is – mostly naked in the bathtub, John bare and slick with wet and pre-come behind him, his cock needy and hard merely from Sherlock’s presence. That knowledge alone, that John is so easily undone just by Sherlock’s body against him, that perhaps he has sat in this bath tub many times before thinking about him, getting himself off, is almost enough to make Sherlock break.
Instead, it leads them into a small circular room, the walls lined with books. It’s one of the turrets then, converted into a makeshift library. Just big enough for a small Chesterfield sofa placed in the centre of the room, and a wood-burner tucked against the curved window overlooking the grounds. Cosy and far enough away from Mycroft that they can probably drink both bottles before he finds them. Perfect.
Sherlock’s very empty chair.
They've not done this yet. Not even during those few hazy hours of too much drink and not enough oxygen (one hand on Sherlock's knee and it could have been so easy then). Even though there's a few fingers of whisky buzzing John's teeth it's not nearly enough to warrant this conversation, these words that could easily lead to whole sentences and confessions of desperation and longing and everything that he's been holding in the creases of his worn soul.
“If you want an award, you may need to appear as if you’re enjoying yourself, John”
Instantly the strain on his wrists to stay upright is immense. John tries to catch his breath, presses his lips to Sherlock’s jaw a few times before shifting off him, onto his back on the mattress. They lie there, side by side, swimming in the fading pool of ecstasy.
“I can be a good listener, is all” John finishes, looking down to the bottle in his hand as if it has answers to questions he doesn’t know how to ask.
More words and questions they can’t address right now, though.
John doesn’t reply because his palm has found Sherlock’s cock and is wrapping around him before he even has chance to think about it. Sherlock’s neck arches up from the pillow as he pushes his head back into it further, so John sucks at his pulse point too, moving his palm up and down once. That seems to work, the noises from Sherlock’s lips become more guttural, and John does it again, testing the smooth of his thumb across the wet head. It’s new and a bit thrilling to get such sharp reactions from so little, John can’t help the smile pressed against the man’s collarbone now, settling into a rhythm.
it) -
Quietness falls over them, sharing the amber liquid until it’s half gone. Not an entirely uncomfortable stretch of silence, but a contemplative one. The offer is there and Sherlock will take it if he wants to, John’s made it clear there’s no expiry date and he’s not about to prod the man unless he asks to be. They watch the early evening turn to nightfall outside, the landscape slowly disappearing into the inky black of darkness. Eventually they filter out the past and discuss the case instead, going over the days revelations.
Terrified.
Yet this isn’t entirely right, not their surroundings or the threat of potential danger now walking towards another door at the edge of the room. As much as the voyeuristic element is thrilling, Sherlock wants this moment for himself, if it’s to happen at all. With great effort, Sherlock brings his hand to John’s cheek and guides it up until their eyes meet. If he had any oxygen left, the desperation in those irises would have taken it away. All the things normally hidden in the shadows of John’s pupils are blown and bright, obvious as he attempts to compose himself in Sherlock’s lap.
“You’re definitely his type”
“Because this is all my fault, yes?” John nods himself because it’s not really a question at all. “I’ve married an assassin and she shot you, just like that - I have her life on a
The sensation of a palm that isn’t his own is new and
Salt sweat from John’s jaw still lingers on his lips. Not today, he thinks.
“I certainly wouldn’t cross her” The man replies quietly, and then, softer – “I’m sorry I couldn’t get you back to her tonight”
“John!“
"I can't -"
“Much,” Sherlock confirms, taking a sip of his own drink (which is apparently eighty percent sugar). “I haven’t spotted our friend yet”
“We know where he’s going, at least”
“Every part,” John clarifies, drifting his touch down Sherlock’s side and to the towel hanging on his hips. “I want every part, too”
“Got him” John says, following Sherlock’s gaze just as their criminal slips through into the next room.
“It seems we are a bit out of place, John”
They don’t talk, though. Sherlock moves onto his side and takes John’s hand in his own. Turns it in his palm and kisses the knuckles there, eyes already closing. John can’t find the strength to move, despite the odd angle of his bent elbow aching softly. So he stays there, takes in the smallness of his own palm in Sherlock’s long slender fingers, wonders how the night ended here and how it didn’t end here sooner.
“For fu –“ John almost swears, blinking at the beam of light shining directly into his eyes. “Sherlock, phone please”
The sound of wind whistling through the walls of what can only really be called a castle (even if Mycroft calls it a house) turns his head. Everything is stonework and tapestries and turrets, a large portrait of the man himself hanging over the grand staircase. It’s an actual museum, a pompous and musty illustration of the man’s ego, a telling contrast to the tiny flat Sherlock chose for himself in London.
And he keeps looking, watches as Sherlock puts his shirt back on with his eyes full of everything he can’t articulate and never leaving John’s, runs a hand through his hair and straightens his watch and does not say a word. He’s holding back, this genius, this remarkable man that John just wants to have and keep and live for; Sherlock’s let part of himself go only to snatch it back again, because he knows what’s coming,
exactly didn’t Sherlock tell him from the hospital bed that it was his wife’s bullet in his chest, two centimetres too close to be only a near-miss and how the hell does that mean she saved his life, and when the fuck did it become normal and acceptable and
, Sherlock had said, and now this –
Sherlock takes the bottle from him as he offers it, rolls his eyes as John steals his shampoo too, squeezes an overly large amount of it into his palms and then through his hair. Hot water soothes his scalp and back, the length of his neck now more sensitive than it was before. John stretches it out, knows Sherlock’s teeth are there, the imprint of his lips where the muscle connects to his shoulder.
“I want to watch you” He confesses, focuses his gaze on John’s blown pupils for as long as he can with the hurt prickling his eyelids. “Touch yourself, for me”
Water cascading in rivets down his back, Sherlock traces his fingers over the ghost of John’s on his ribcage. He bites his lip and wraps a hand around himself, thinking of that brief but sure grip on his waist, and the man sat in his kitchen shoving toast into his mouth. When he comes, Sherlock has to press his forehead against the tile, screwing his eyes shut until tiny stars prickle in the darkness.
“The one person who means
The bed sheets are unmade. John can see the imprint of Sherlock there, the wrinkles where his body has been and moved throughout the night, the dip in the dark grey pillow where he has lain, no doubt wide awake.
“This is more like it” John grins, immediately heading for the worn looking emerald leather couch, sighing as it moulds to his body.
, why did he wait so fucking long. If he had enough time or drive to do so, he could probably map every callus of John’s hand on him, the rough of it beginning a slow torturous rhythm. Sherlock watches the pure gratification on John’s face, the way his eyes are captivated by the sight of Sherlock’s cock in his hand. He wants so very much to move, just be able to keen his hips up into John’s fingers, greedily speed up the pace of them. John shifts back up Sherlock’s body again, pushes his tongue in his mouth and moans into him.
When he finally gives up on telekinesis and joins Sherlock in the vacant bedroom, the man is already coatless and shoeless, lying on the bed. With apparently zero concerns at all, Sherlock has propped himself up with a pillow, legs stretched out in front of him and crossed at his ankles, seemingly occupied with his phone.
The height advantage is instantly appealing and John uses it, controls the way their mouths meet, teases at Sherlock’s bottom lip with his teeth. All at once he wants everything, each part of Sherlock he’s denied himself from the very beginning, those carefully concealed truths that have been waiting here all this time, in the arch of Sherlock’s body as he strains hopelessly beneath him.
Suddenly his head spins a bit, and Sherlock has to screw his eyes closed in order to stay vertical. Seeking stability, he presses his forehead between John’s shoulder blades and breathes out through his mouth. That serotonin is pinching his veins again. His hands tighten and white spots bloom in the pitch black behind his eyelids.
Mary Watson watches the plane turn, tightens her grip on her husband’s forearm and doesn’t let go. Digs her nails in hard until she can feel her own pulse in her fingertips, and tries to hold on as the wind brings Sherlock Holmes back to life again.
When Sherlock wakes for the fifth time since dying, John is still there, as he always has been. Quiet snores puff against the short hairs at his neck, comforting in their irritation. His body is raging again but it’s definitely not time to get up. Shadows still creep in the room around them, darkening the furniture and Sherlock’s hand, still pressed to John’s thigh. There’s still so much he wants to say to the sleeping man beside him, but he cannot bring himself to wake him. Maybe it’s not important anymore, words long overshadowed by touch, years of breaking down finally enough to start anew.
They reach the security cabin and pick up the tree, Sherlock paying in cash for what looks like the best of the bunch. Obviously. If the guard notices their overly pink cheeks and John’s ruffled hair he doesn’t say anything, putting it down to the weather rather than the dirty escapade that just went on in the trees behind him. John lets Sherlock drive them back, trying not to fall asleep after the exertion and wondering if he’ll be forever turned on by the smell of pine.
So Sherlock waits, and John continues to die -
He feels John wrap a hand around himself again, the other curling around Sherlock’s own, speeding up the pace of his wrist. They move together, the same pattern of touch as they both fall towards the rolling heat of climax. Expletives drip from Sherlock’s lips almost silently as he spills over their joined hands.
And Sherlock doesn’t want him to stop, despite the many eyes watching them and the ache in his gut from sugary alcohol and stress. Would like nothing more than to give his consent for John to open his shirt buttons, lay hands on him like no one else has, taste his mouth as he so often has thought about.
John doesn’t know what Sherlock wants, what he needs or thinks about in the dark of night. But he wants to ask, now. He wants to spend every second trying to find those answers, discover them with the touch of his hands and the patience of a slowly mending heart.
He slams the glass down without meaning to, really, but it gets his point across - Sherlock’s eyes blink at the noise and it’s the little things that give him away.
What Sherlock produces in the end is nothing short of the best Christmas dinner John has ever had. They eat until they can’t move, Loki sneaking one of Sherlock’s bacon wrapped sausages from his plate as he pours another glass of fizz for Rosie. She regales them with tales from college, how she painted and then proceeded to lift up the floorboards in the art room, presenting them as her final piece. It was a typically risky move, but she had walked away with top marks and a new respect (and perhaps fear, John thinks) from her tutors.
Pain prickles in John’s chest and he swears under his breath, shakes his head and bites the inside of his cheek. Before he really knows what he’s doing, John is standing, bridging the small gap between their chairs with his hands clenched at his sides. Wanting to help and offer comfort, and not quite recalling how to do either.
Rolling out his shoulder, John steps towards him and lets Sherlock wrap two hands around the back of his neck. He kisses him, slow and purposeful, the comfort of such a simple act instantly easing the pain away. John makes a pleased sound in the back of his throat and lets his forehead fall to Sherlock’s collarbone. They stand like that for a few moments, resting and savouring the safety of each other’s presence.
Sharing his bed every night is less of an inconvenience than he first thought. It’s surprising. More often nowadays Sherlock finds himself doing things that are just not very
“Are we –“ John begins, swallowing the instant panic rising in his stomach.
Christ knows he’s never been a wordsmith, and Sherlock smiles a little.
“I suppose he can stay” Loki closes his eyes and nestles into John’s lap as if making his case.
“It’s –”
John. The only man he trusts completely. The only touch he has ever truly craved. The only person he would allow to do this; straddle him while he’s completely helpless, willingly submissive.
“Think you’re clever?” John asks, his breath hot across Sherlock’s cheekbone.
Unfortunately, he has little choice in the matter. John shifts and takes a pillow out of its case, using it to clean the mess on their stomachs. Then he reaches up to the restraints, clicking open the cuffs again and gently lowering Sherlock’s arms to the bed as if he’s not capable of doing it himself. Of course he is, but Sherlock lets him anyway. Allows John this gentle reassurance, a display of affection to counter the intense burst of power he just held over the man below him.
“He made me laugh”
There never seems to be an opportune moment to ask about Eurus. John’s not certain Sherlock even expects him to. Now would be a good time, yet he can’t quite form the words in his mouth. That way there be monsters, and though more than a year has passed, John still can’t quite open that door. Those paths lead to the version of himself that nearly broke them apart completely, and he’s not yet made peace with that particular demon.
“Would you like me to step away?” Sherlock asks, low and miles away from the controlled man John knows.
Sherlock asks, pulls back his cheek and lets his fingers drop from John’s chin - and John can’t help but look into his eyes for confirmation of his own existence reflected back in them; that this is actually happening, this iridescent version of reality where his own palm has drifted to the dull bullet hole on Sherlock’s chest, and his teeth are aching with the need to drag them along the exposed plane of skin just in front of him.
A small strangled sound comes from Sherlock’s throat and then his hand is at the back of John’s neck, pulling him until their mouths meet again. This time the angle is right and so sure that John almost feels dizzy, not enough and also too much, as Sherlock darts his tongue out to taste him. Every seemingly sane thought dissipates like the space between them, John shifting up onto one elbow over Sherlock now on his back, the other hand thumbing the line of the man’s jaw as they move against each other.
The Holmes’ kitchen looks like a bomb of white flour has exploded over it, and John reckons it probably has. Rosie’s hair is powdery and her nose too, smile so big he isn’t even mad about the mess. The smell of cookies is particularly enticing, so John takes one as they’re offered to him, while Rosie throws herself into Sherlock’s arms.
He’s so sick of talking. He’s so beyond hearing why he can’t have the things he wants to have, why they can’t just be simple and right and his without complication. For a few dammed minutes, all John wants is to feel good.
“Room for two more?” John asks, the suggestiveness to the edge of his voice making Sherlock swallow.
John settles on his back again, blows out an exasperated sigh.
“It’s Christmas Eve tomorrow” He says under his breath almost desperately.
“I’m sorry” Sherlock offers, barely audible across the top of John’s hair. “John, I –“
“All this time –”
There are a few horrible, painful moments where they each re-arrange their own clothing and smooth out their hair. John rubs what he can of the mess on the bottom of his shirt against the wall, and tucks it back into his waistband.
A red velvet curtain hangs just beyond the first door, and as soon as John pushes it back, it feels like they’re in a different place entirely. The grip around Sherlock’s waist relaxes and John’s palm moves to the small of his back instead, both of them stilled for a moment by the scene before them.
Sherlock shifts a little in his seat, hoping the movement will shake the interference from his head, but all it does is slips John’s hand further up his leg, drifting to the plane of his thigh. If John even realises the path his hand has taken, he doesn’t say anything or move it back again, all his attention apparently on his own breathing, as it puffs rapidly now from his mouth.
Sleeping Sherlock is fighting demons now, ghosts that want to take John and hide him somewhere unknown, somewhere unreal; there are no clues so it’s unfair, Sherlock is blind and there’s no science, and none of John’s brightness to guide him.
“You’ll always come back” John echoes, forms with his mouth though it barely registers.
“Yes,
John cuts himself off with two fingers pressed to his own lips, reassessing his choice of words and rearranging them. There’s so much he needs to say but it’s not all necessarily legible in his brain yet.
“Here you go” John says, or rather, Sherlock reads his lips, unable to distinguish words over the heavy thrum of the next song.
“Move your hand, I’ve got you”
“I know” Sherlock replies, voice slightly strained as he reaches for a bottle on the highest row, stretching on his tip toes. “It’s a wonder Mycroft is so boring when he has half of the world’s wine reserves down here”
Sherlock tries to smile, but his face feels strange and tight and then he recollects why – hard knuckles at his jaw, his forehead meeting concrete, sharp hot pain beneath his ribs and lips, lips on his own in the darkness.
Somehow John manages to bend down one last time and kiss him, arching his body over Sherlock as he comes, unintelligible curses groaning between their mouths. This time John rolls onto his back next to Sherlock straight away, finally letting his overworked muscles relax. Minutes of satisfied silence settle over them, the blanket of relief like coming home after the longest time away.
John maps his way up the man’s chest, his cock wrapped in those clever fingers, tries to breathe the entirety of him into his lungs so every exhale from now on will be Sherlock. There’s no response, so he begins to push into Sherlock’s cold grip, careening against him almost desperately. His breaths puff out in little clouds between them, melting against wool as he presses his forehead to Sherlock’s coat lapel.
, and John’s world collapses into the few inches around them and between them. Tips of Semtex fingernails at his calves, testing, making muscle dance, and it takes all of his will to keep his breath steady; then more pressure to the inside of his knees, the line of his thighs as Sherlock smoothes the heels of his palms along them, ice fire through denim.
“I suppose there are worse places to be trapped” John comments – then, catching Sherlock’s raised brow – “I just mean, it’s comfortable, is all”
It really is the only way.
John bites his own lip and doesn’t break the contact of their eyes, rising to the challenge as the power shifts and Sherlock’s hand moves from his hip to the swell of his buttocks. As in all things, the man below him has already deduced the exact way to drive John completely insane, knows that denial of what he wants most is part of the appeal. There’s only so much he can take though, and as if having Sherlock beneath him isn’t already enough, fingernails dig into the muscle of his arse and the sensation of momentary pain combined with the palm around his cock is just too much. Incoherent words trip from his tongue as he squeezes his eyes shut and finishes, Sherlock gasping below him as he witnesses the release.
“I’m sorry, John” Sherlock admits, tugging the Belstaff he’s somehow still wearing tighter across his body.
First John feels the rough of Sherlock’s hand on his face then the back of his neck, because somehow he’s managed to close his own eyes as if doing so will keep in the line he just spoke; and then there’s the blood pumping in his own ears and through his body like a building storm, gathering momentum and such tight need that it’s almost painful.
The mood only gets worse as John laughs darkly, shaking his head. Raindrops fall from his neck line, tripping over the goosebumps that have started to rise from his skin. He’s prepping wipes and stitches and Sherlock is thirteen seconds away from turning him around by the shoulder if he’s ignored any longer –
“So, what do you really think of our new friend?” Sherlock asks, gently swirling the brandy in his glass.
“No, we don’t” Sherlock concedes. “But I need to”
“Not yet” John says to the curve of skin his forehead is pressed against.
Hurriedly John turns onto his back again, struggles in the lack of light and space to take his own shirt off. Eventually he manages, bundling it into a tight ball before turning back over to Sherlock again. Not ideal but it’ll do, will at least be more effective than the flat of Sherlock’s weakening palm.
Not exactly the comment he’d expected, but fair. John can’t help the small smile that tugs his lips, looking down at his own comic appearance, drowned in crimson polyester, the fur of the hood nearly consuming his face entirely.
John peels away from his body, slips off the bed and stands beside him. Sherlock is left bare and straining, deprived in the emptiness around him. For a few moments John simply looks, dragging his gaze over Sherlock as if he wants to consume every part of him. It’s a stare that prickles tiny bumps across Sherlock’s skin and makes him keen his hips towards the now vacant space between them. He watches the muscles in John’s arms and torso as he pulls white cotton over his head, a hushed curse spilling from his own lips as jeans follow the t-shirt to the floor. John wraps a hand around himself and begins to pull at his needy cock, eyes still flicking across Sherlock’s aching body.
In that quiet space of time, Sherlock lets the agony overtake his body and attempts to ride it out. More than anything, he does not want to move, or have John move away from him. Nothing can break this moment in case it is forever undone, not even his own crippling hurt as it chases through his veins.
“I assumed as much” Sherlock says with a smirk, flicking his gaze once across John’s form.
So Sherlock allows himself to continue sleeping, gives into the push and pull of his own consciousness, the lull of drowsiness lapping at his skin like ocean waves.
“Sherlock,” John says again, as his hand finds a curved shoulder. “Come here”
“I still need a shower” John says, breaking the silence.
“Inventive,” Sherlock quips, voice breathier than he intended. “I think he’s just at the next –“
John cocks an eyebrow at the name – God of mischief, indeed – and crouches down beside Sherlock to receive his own face wash. He can’t help smiling, despite the unexpectedness of being given a live and very energetic Christmas present. Glancing at Sherlock, he realises it may be her best surprise yet. The younger man’s eyes look glassy and joyful as if years have been taken off them.
“Shit,” John pulls away, oxygen failing to reach his lungs as everything constricts in panic. “Shit, Sherlock, I’m sorry – “
But now he simply stands there because he doesn’t know what to say. Instead, he observes just like he’s been taught, does his best to keep his expression blank and unforgiving as he takes in the face before him. It’s a far cry from the tight translucency that had pinched Sherlock’s skin over his bones with the effort of staying alive; the blotchy dead pink has left his tear ducts and the red veins in the whites of his eyes are less prominent, fading with the passing of time and the memory of a singular bursting bullet hole. Now, instead, where the light glances and ebbs at the harsh angles of Sherlock’s chin and cheeks, he looks years younger; the dark remains of night disguising the grey circles around his eyes, innocent, bare as the first page of a book  - and what would John write there, if he could?
“You are –“
But he’s passive, he’s boiling in his own goddamn skin, and he will not,
The artist retires shortly before midnight, tired from her journey and the busy few weeks previous. She hugs them both goodnight, cheeks pink from the warming fire and festive booze. Loki stirs from his spot on the rug and decides John’s knee is a much better pillow. He helps the puppy up and into his lap, ignoring the smirk on Sherlock’s face as he regards the man who swore he’d never get a dog.
Sherlock chuckles, that double bass laugh he does only when he’s particularly pleased with himself. It’s more endearing than it should be. It’s been so long since John’s heard it that he can’t help but smile, too. Sherlock still functions like he always has, yet sometimes, hidden between the cracks, there’s a sadness. It pulls at the edges of his mouth when John pretends not to look, is plain and raw in the red spidery veins of his eyes when he returns from Sherringford.
Anger is such an easy thing for him. It’s like putting on an old coat and finding a fiver in the pocket -it always gives him something, never fails to turn up when he needs it. Words are easier when they’re said in irritation, provoked with an easy alibi. There’s probably some kind of childhood psychological bullshit to explain his reliance on it, but anger makes his words stone and sharp as glass when in truth they’re brittle, just compacted bitter sand. Something in Sherlock’s eyes flashes and John’s sure it’s not just a reflection of the Bunsen in low light, is sure, actually, that there’s a bit of resentment in there somewhere. Interesting. Maybe he can get
he needs, not just yet.
Perhaps that revelation was a step too far. John falters for a moment, his eyes suddenly painted with sadness like he’s grieving for something that never happened. Sherlock brings the knuckles of his closed fist to John’s knee, presses them there for a moment before opening his palm against the patella, tentatively letting his fingers slide upwards.
It’s January outside so he prepares the fire an hour in advance. The flat is so warm when the two of them arrive, that the doctor is sweating by the time he’s been up and down the stairs twice.
, strangely mirroring.
“Orion, the hunter”
“Why are you here, John?”
Sherlock’s irises are saturated and framed with red, bursting veins as he holds John’s gaze and really looks this time.
“Sherlock” John breathes, his head crammed into the space below Sherlock’s neck. “
And it’s not as if either of them have never been inches from death before - in fact, it’s a fairly regular occurrence - but this is different, as it always inevitably is. Something John can’t place his static fingers on, right now, but there’s no doubt he will soon, and when it’s achingly far too late.
When John wakes in the morning to find he has actually slept, Sherlock is gone. He quickly showers, pulls on clothes he will later store in a box under his bed, and goes to leave. The fridge he hours ago had his back to is still there and still normal. The only addition is a bright yellow sticky note, loud and lonely, and a black marker on the table.
“It wasn’t a mistake, Sherlock”
Before John can voice this realisation, Sherlock steps away. Moves into the bedroom – into
The tension cracks and lightning bolts down Sherlock’s spine. It’s been nearly a year since they’ve even come close to sharing their grief. One solitary embrace and John closed right back up again, both of them stubborn in their complacency for repression. Even now with the good days outweighing the bad, there are things that are off limits.
“See, I may wander around sometimes” Sherlock admits, quieter now, taking the bottle back again from John’s loosened grip. “But I’ve never done that”
Many, many problems. Somehow though they’re all quickly disappearing like the white clouds of breath forming from his lips. There’s no one else around, and the security cabin is that far away now they can’t even see the light from it. The risk is minimal, but it’s enough to add an extra element of heat to the situation, warming the depths of John’s belly as Sherlock tugs his shirt out from his jeans.
“Save me the lie, John”
John tries, but Sherlock’s mouth is there again, touching gently this time, feathering kisses along damaged skin. He closes his eyes, the waterfall of heat and Sherlock’s body being so close again making him forget what language is. What words are and what he was about to use them for.
“I mean, I’m no stranger to odd men wandering around in the middle of the night –“ He continues, turning in his seat to raise an eyebrow at his drinking companion.
Something in John’s shoe dislodges as they cross the threshold into Baker Street. He squeezes his eyes shut and prays for it to be some insignificant detritus he missed emptying out – a tiny pebble, maybe, some bit of vegetation completely innocent in nature – and not a fragment of bone, not the remains of a small child.
“I don’t have mine, either” Sherlock confirms, words bouncing back off the dampening wood.
John shakes off the memory of slippery bones and follows Sherlock’s footsteps through a door to the right of the staircase. Almost immediately there are steps leading down to a cellar, narrow and worn, probably an original feature made for the slim feet of their ancestors.
John’s right sleeve is dirty, a ley line of water stain across deep blue. He notices it right before he closes his eyes, Sherlock’s palm reaching down into his parted jeans and cupping him, fingers long and warm and for a second everything goes dark.
“Those security cameras work then, right?” John asks, beginning to wonder whether he should have taken his chances on the road.
Sherlock adjusts his gaze to quickly sweep over the pair himself, and John’s right. They’re kissing, quite passionately, pushing into each other’s space with no concern for any onlookers. In fact, now he’s had chance to take in the room, most of its occupants seem to be doing the same. They are perhaps the only two in the entire club not touching in some way, several couples on the verge of what would be deemed public indecency.
The sound of the shower is finally louder than John’s heart, the pulse in his ears settling somewhat as he watches Sherlock tilt his head back into the stream. Water vines down his face, past his strong nose and cheekbones, flattening his curls and wetting his eyelashes. John is caught for a moment. Follows the movement of tiny rivers across Sherlock’s collarbone and down his marred chest, over the jut of his hipbones and then beneath, to a dark spattering of pubic hair.
Eyes crawl down John’s frame as Sherlock moves out of the way, hums as if he doesn’t give a shit if John uses the entire bottle. With anyone else he might feel uneasy, but John matches the gaze turned his way while he steps back under the hot stream of water. Uses both hands to scrape the hair from his face and watches Sherlock looking – rolling his lips together in consideration, taking in every detail, slowly, as if he may never get another chance.
'Sherlock doesn’t quite understand why, never really has, but he knows that there are words John simply cannot say to him in public. He accepts this, the pain of doing so more brutal than any knife.'
“I like a challenge” John counters, his voice so low Sherlock cannot be sure he’s spoken at all.
“I’m joking” He confirms quickly. “He’s that old detective who follows us around sometimes”
John claims the space between them and once again feels his entire body hum with a current of energy that lights his skin on fire. No caramel or stray crumbs this time, just Sherlock and his honest mouth moving against John’s own, sure and unwavering. The absurdity of being atop a hill in the almost-Christmas snow, pushing his tongue past Sherlock’s teeth is laughable, but he doesn’t care. For once John forgets what he should do and instead takes what he wants, what he knows has been his for a while, now.
But he’s not stepping away - Sherlock’s giving him the question yet seems unable to even slightly pretend he’s capable of fulfilling it; has his hands on John’s waist and his mouth somehow ghosting the stretched line of his neck, lips still for awful seconds before they touch again to the skin there, close and slow and because they are magnets, pulling towards each other from opposite poles.
Fuck it’s awkward, but it wouldn’t be them if it was easy - and John finds his tongue in Sherlock’s open mouth again because he can’t bear to leave it, sucks and pushes and takes until they almost mould into one another, become whole and filthy together. Sherlock’s fly is undone but that’s about as far as they’ve made it, cannot break apart for fear of losing this, of it being taken away.
Then, delicate fingers find his own. They rest lightly over John’s strong digits, knotted tightly in the shirt pressed against Sherlock’s ribs. For a few seconds he focuses on that touch, the slow circle of Sherlock’s thumb on the back of his hand.
“I don’t mind” Sherlock counters, because it’s true.
A lot of things had apparently happened that way. Like his lips finding Sherlock’s, his palm aching to slide further up his thigh.
This close John notices the red, the rawness under Sherlock’s eyes and remembers how little rest they’ve had. That they haven’t slept properly for days, not eaten for forty-eight hours and haven’t had much better than some dish water tea for nearly a day.
“Did you shrink?”
Desperately he tries again with his left, ignoring John’s protests. He manages a couple more inches of success but still nowhere near his desired destination. John grabs his wrist this time, pinning it forcibly to the mattress.
“There’s one more thing,” She starts, biting her lip in anticipation. “I really hope you like it, because it’s none-refundable I’m afraid”
He’s so close, and Sherlock knows it, brings his other hand to grip John’s hip tightly and slow his movements. John whimpers breathlessly, the edges of it breaking over his lips before he has a chance to quell it. The dangerous look that shadows over Sherlock’s face nearly snaps him in two but he holds out, breathing short bursts through his nose as that hand slows down a bit and the pull on his cock becomes more purposeful, measured.
Silence threatens the space between them. John watches as Sherlock opens and closes his mouth again carefully, leaving him bereft in its emptiness. He’s read something that wasn’t there then, imagined words where there were none, fictions they dance around that never become reality.
Thank you for the encouraging comments on the previous chapter, they are definitely what spurred me on to get this out so promptly. I hope it's not a disappointment!
No words are spoken the whole ride back, and that’s really just fine; John doesn’t think he can handle anything other than silence right now, and even if he could, he’s pretty sure if he were to open his mouth only emptiness would come drifting out of it. There’s a lot to process, and the sound of Sherlock’s brain opening and closing its filing cabinets is the only one breaking the monotony of tires on London road.
Ridiculous.
And there it is again, a tightening of John’s airways as his body forgets how to breathe, a sensation he can now only equate to something he doesn’t want to admit but has long known. Always growing there, the layers of self-denial beginning to gently peel off like old wallpaper with each new day. John has to look away, puff out a couple of sharp breaths through his nose to level his head out again.
John doesn’t know what to say, so he doesn’t speak at all.
Sherlock huffs and suddenly moves forwards, stretching across John’s body for the remote control sitting on his arm of the sofa. All at once his slender frame is the only thing John can see, nose centimetres from the man’s shoulders. Instinctively John reaches out, vacant hand coming to rest against Sherlock’s angled chest. The torso beneath stills, John can feel the circulation of oxygen pushing in and out of Sherlock’s lungs under his touch. Fingers tighten of their own accord, twisting into the soft royal blue cotton there. Canned laughter echoes from the television, as John’s grip refuses to ease.
“You’re being stubborn” Sherlock counters, moving his body back onto the mattress in one fluid motion.
“I managed to text Lestrade before they knocked us out,” Sherlock shifts next to him, groaning softly with the movement. “But I’ve no idea if it sent”
There’s a second where Sherlock thinks maybe John will let his wanderings fall further down, to the jut of his hip or his shirt buttons even. He doesn’t though, just rests there a little longer, regarding Sherlock with a small smile warming across his face.
Nothing happens for an indistinguishable time. John’s head hums and replays through a thousand things and can’t pull out anything singular to focus on, nothing to distract him from the rise and fall of Sherlock’s lungs, the heat radiating from his struggling body.
When Sherlock flicks his eyes up finally, he finds John’s own are closed. Lips pressed thin, he’s breathing through his nose with his brows set low. There are so many things he wants to say and scream at him, all of which seem pointless now. Wounds and skin and bones take precedent. Sherlock commits each touch to memory, keeps them for his own selfish pleasure.
“John – “ He speaks, but it’s nothing but a breath in the sticky air between them.
The man obviously answers his own question and immediately turns on his heels, sprinting down the corridor as Sherlock and John follow suit. It’s surprisingly difficult to run in such stupidly tight trousers but they eventually catch up to him, John overtaking at the last minute to throw himself at the suspect. They both tumble to the floor but John hits it first, knocking his head against the wall with a sickeningly loud thump. Sherlock grabs the assailant from behind, hooking his arms around the man’s torso in an attempt to drag him off John’s unconscious body.
Well, at least they don’t have to spend the entire evening making conversation or playing boardgames with Mycroft. Could be worse. Scrabble is bad enough with Sherlock, who threatened to melt the tiny plastic tiles one by one the last time they played. John quickly thumbs out a text to Molly, his apology sincere yet predictable.
They’d left Rosie at home, mostly due to the cold temperatures and fading winter light, but also because the task at hand would be completed much quicker just the two of them. Or so John had thought. What Sherlock had failed to mention was that he’d never picked out a Christmas tree before, and he also had very very specific parameters that said tree had to fulfil.
John would have him against the wall. Right there next to the bookcase where they can shake the photo frames from their nails and knock the collection of dead things from the shelves. He would, but he also wants nothing more than to be in Sherlock’s bed, be invited there, to a room he has only ever been a visitor in.
Goosebumps prickle John’s skin, the steam warm yet not enough to quell the chill that shakes through him, the stark reality that is now theirs. The low light picks up the hairs on John’s arms and the sight of Sherlock’s naked body, trembling slightly where his forehead meets John’s shoulder. Whatever regret John should feel – that the world and his own self sabotaging mind has told him he should feel – does not come. He’s still hard and full of all the things he was moments ago, wants it even more now the spell of trauma is dissipating.
“Neither have I” John agrees, seeming to relax a little as he sweeps the room again.
It’s clear now that John does in fact want him, his hands insistent as they work on Sherlock’s shirt buttons with surprising ease. He can’t breathe, and though it may be an after effect of his injury, Sherlock’s sure it has something to do with John’s teeth at his collarbone too, marring and then soothing the skin there with his lips. With every bit of energy he can muster, Sherlock brings his right hand up to John’s hair, the muscles in his arm screaming as he threads his fingers through it, tugging slightly to bring the man’s tongue back into his mouth.
John watches as Sherlock arranges kindling, practised fingers striking a match. His gaze falls from the blackening tinder as the fire begins to take, to the contrast of dark wool against Sherlock’s pale wrist then upwards, the shadow of failing light outside deepening the hollow of his cheeks and thinly set mouth. They don’t talk as much as they should, both veterans of repressing everything they find difficult. Yet they’re trapped here now, nowhere to run but the maze of Mycroft’s endless house, and John’s already unscrewed the whisky, so.
Without considering the alternative, John steps to the foot of the bed, removes his jacket and folds it into a square. He places the makeshift pillow on the floor, wincing as his body protests at the gravity pulling him down to follow it. Oh, he’s going to ache in the morning, even with the cushion of alcohol numbing his bones somewhat. Ever the soldier, he folds his arms across his chest and closes his eyes, Sherlock’s tapping like a metronome in the night. Perhaps only minutes have passed, the comforting keyboard sound lulling John into an easy slumber despite the hard floor beneath him.
Of course. The look on John’s face is incredulous but he can’t be mad. Sherlock basically just dragged them into the middle of a makeshift forest to get him off, another experiment into their sexual limitations that John doesn’t mind playing guinea pig for.
suddenly feels hyper real and inside out and Jesus -
Sherlock manages to discharge himself two evenings later, much to everyone’s chagrin. The sun is failing and John’s hands are cold when they grip Sherlock’s own, steadying him as they climb into the back of a cab.
“Don’t” John asks, almost begging as he pushes his forehead into the sharp edge of bone in front of him. “Don’t say that”
“Forgive her”
John takes a defiant step forwards and allows himself to breathe as Sherlock remains where he is, rooted to the spot by the admission.
The two men share a knowing look that only irritates Sherlock further. As ever, the worst thing about being stabbed or shot or maimed in some serious way, is sitting in a hospital bed having other people act as if he’s received brain surgery, not stitches. Sherlock huffs as much as his lungs allow, and itches for the pain relief to kick in.
“Perfect” John says, rolling his eyes as he prises open the passenger door again.
“Ugh, fine” Sherlock sighs dramatically, finally shaking off his coat and jacket.
“You can lip read better than me,” John confesses. “I’ll – you know, and you see if you can work out what they’re saying?”
It would be embarrassing, with anyone else, both in trousers still and not nearly close enough - but close is even
His own hips keen against Sherlock’s inner thigh, pushing into the dip of space there, shamelessly trying to catch any friction he can. One hand reaches down between them and Sherlock circles fingers around him finally, their wrists bumping with the movement as he copies John’s touch. John curses against Sherlock’s chest and kisses the plane of skin there, tries to breathe and move and give everything he can whilst also pushing into Sherlock’s palm. It’s been so long since he’s had someone else, since he’s wanted someone else, and for it to be the man beneath him is nearly too much for his body to handle.
It takes a moment for John to agree because everything is so tight and close. He’s hard beneath Sherlock’s touch and moving away from that now seems near impossible. Eventually he does though, groans as the contact is stolen. John wastes no time in stepping out of his jeans and boxers, removes his grimy shirt, all while watching Sherlock’s fall from his shoulders, suit trousers quickly following into a pool on the floor. The scars that run across the mountain of Sherlock’s back, down his spine and all the way to his bare arse, make John’s breath hitch.
They’re closer now, John can feel a brush of cotton against the tip of his nose, Sherlock’s shoulder radiating warmth in the confined space. The head above him must be turned his way, the apology followed by shaking breaths tickling his eyebrows.
Not only did he not care that John so ardently wiped out the line they’ve kept between themselves, but he wanted more. Wants more, now, while John is still willing to offer it. And he is, the desire in his steady gaze is formidable, whether the man realises it or not.
“I live with you, exactly“ John agrees, pointing at him accusatorily. “But I swear, if I wake up and he’s at the bottom of my bed…”
John watches as Sherlock narrows his eyes, contemplating the specimen before them. This is the eleventh Christmas tree they’ve stopped to look at, Sherlock rejecting each one based on factors John isn’t privy to. And to be honest, really doesn’t care about.
These moments have been more frequent of late. Since packing up their lives in London and moving to Sussex, Sherlock’s heart has bloomed like the crown of roses over their front door. It’s the little things John knew were always there but are now bold and obvious, proclaimed without hesitation. His own icy exterior has melted, too. Those difficult years are so far behind them that they only serve as a distant reminder of just how good things are now, how thankful he is for peace.
“I really, really don’t want to stay here, Sherlock” John continues, trying to do his best
She laughs, finally dissipating into nothingness.
bedroom, with his unmade sheets and ghost of his form, there, singular on the mattress.
“Yeah well,” He says, rolling his eyes. “Didn’t expect to find you up a hill in the snow”
“Yes,” John breathes, and pushes back slightly until he feels resistance. “
That voice, lukewarm and familiar, breaks through the persistent buzz in his head. Sherlock rolls his neck to the right and finds John, tired and small in the seat next to his bed.
Silence again, for a moment. Then John watches. Observes the small parting of Sherlock’s lips, the pinching between his eyebrows as that exhale happens, as the oxygen is released – except Sherlock does not break like he should. Keeps hold of whatever so desperately wants to exit his body, until his entire torso shakes.
“I did solve the case, though”
John worries his lip and does a final sweep of the flat. He’s no genius and Sherlock knows it. John won’t find any obvious clues to his whereabouts unless he’s meant to.
The music is so loud Sherlock can feel the bass of it in his chest, hammering alongside his own pulse. John’s shouting over it to order their drinks, both of them being jostled by sweaty inebriated men, all trying to make accidental contact with someone willing. Sherlock does his best to stay as close to John as possible, side swiped by his own overwhelmed senses.
“Well, maybe if this whole detective thing doesn’t work out” Sherlock smirks, turning back to face the locked door. “The inspector seems to be taking his time”
The doctor only rolls his eyes in response, crossing his arms defensively as he waits for instructions.
The man they’ve been stalking all night is saying something in the booth next to them and neither of them pay it any attention. Sherlock finds his head tipping back against the leather backrest, eyes fluttering closed as the hand in his curls falls to his own fist, twisted in John’s shirt. Fingers loosen his own and pull his wrist down to the seat instead, pinning it there as John finds his balance and presses into him, the other hand falling from Sherlock’s shoulder to his chest.
“Sherlock, you can’t –“
John thinks of as Sherlock’s hands finally work his belt open, as Sherlock takes his own gloves off with his teeth, leaving them in the snow and wrapping a naked palm around him.
Yeah, he should just turn back. Bury everything like he’s so good at doing, forgive and forget and smile tightly like everything is okay. And perhaps if he were a better man - a
Sometimes though, John only sees what he wants to, and so he fetches some water and some paper towel that Sherlock didn’t even know existed outside the aisle in Tesco that he has passed once or twice, sets it all down on the table neat and in line, produces a first aid kit - John is the first aid kit, he is Sherlock’s aid - and performs like Sherlock is simply a patient, albeit a patient with shallow knife wounds and the imprint of a boot, probably, on his ribs.
Sherlock’s eyes are closed again. Fingers curled around the edges of his armchair, brow furrowed and lips tight.
“I’m fine” John tries for anyway, hoping he can convince himself.
The emphasis on that last word brings a moan from John’s mouth, the sound something Sherlock wants to keep and replay over and over again. John crawls back onto the bed and pulls Sherlock’s zip through metallic teeth, tugs his trousers and boxers off with efficiency. They’re both naked and laid bare now, and Sherlock finds it isn’t as strange as it probably should be, any trepidation he’d imagined this moment would bring is non-existent.
The foundations of his heart begin to collapse and John wishes the walls around him would, too. He wishes for a redo, some relief from the impossible wrong that has happened so easily. If he had foreseen this when he woke up this morning, John would have taken Sherlock and hidden him away, locked them both in Baker Street and professed that no one else matters; not the crime, or the lives of other people. Just them.
Rosie has always had a knack for knowing what they need, even if they don’t realise it themselves. A new challenge will be good for them, and John’s already a little bit in love, though he’d never admit it. He strokes the sleeping pup’s ears absentmindedly, letting his eyes close as the comfort of home seeps into his bones.
Sherlock stills suddenly under the kiss, and every ounce of relief John had felt seconds before suddenly turns to a sickness in his stomach, a sharp stab of pain that he has perhaps made the wrong choice. A devastating choice, that cannot be taken back. One he knew could well end like this, with remorse at his own vulnerability.
Loki attempts to stick his tongue up John’s nose and though he’s never been one for pets, he finds himself laughing and accepting the onslaught, not noticing the protest from his shoulder as the bundle of energy puts both paws up on him.
“Sherlock – “ He begins, abruptly aware of his vulnerable position.
Sherlock’s next circulation of oxygen sounds weak and excruciating, almost a whimper trembling from his lips. John swears under his breath, fights the deep ache in his gut that threatens to spill from his eyes.
“John”
No. Nope, that’s not what he came here for. Sherlock has nothing to apologise for yet John’s still letting him, can’t seem to make his lips form anything but a thin line of stagnation. Ice continues to drift slowly down from the sky, white stars in Sherlock’s curls settling and then dissolving into black.
And Rosie, blooming like a bright supernova, pointing them both in the right direction.
“No,” John replies. “But we need to sit down, people are starting to look at us”
Sherlock makes a satisfied sound, fingers gently stroking the hair at the nape of John’s neck. He touches John like he’s disappearing, nowadays. John supposes he is in some ways. They both are. Parts of themselves dissolving into memory to make room for the next season of their lives. Sitting by the fire, with the man he cannot live without, and the daughter he doesn’t deserve sleeping in the next room, it’s undeniable that things are changing. Slowing down, becoming settled and predictable.
- and presses his nose into sweaty curls as warm mess spills into his fingers.
John looks mildly disappointed, still clutching both cups in front of him like he isn’t sure if he wants to let Sherlock go. Sherlock doesn’t give him a choice though, ignoring the protests of his body as he heads towards the bedroom. When he reaches out to take his tea from John in passing, the other man pulls it back, some sloshing over the rim.
And he still feels a little sick, but the fingertips playing at his abdominals are encouraging and direct. The centring pressure of a forehead against his own is enough to ease the skip of adrenaline through John’s veins, as he grinds against Sherlock again. Those fears begin to fade away, slip from his mind like the leather of Sherlock’s belt, as John feeds it through the loops of the man’s waistband.
