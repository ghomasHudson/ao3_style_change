The lump of bark could be mistaken for a plant, if he squints. A plant with memory issues, since it’s apparently forgotten that most plants are stationary and don’t go in for the whole attacking-strangers-on-the-road sort of thing.
Castiel kissed him again, just to feel the trembling of his lips against his own. Then he trailed down to his jaw, his throat, the vulnerable bob of his Adam’s apple. He began undoing the buttons of Sam’s white blouse. He wasn’t wearing anything else. Castiel had many fiefdoms under his domain, now joined to the Winchester name, but the planes of pale skin beneath his fingers trumped them all. All his. Unless…
“The vessel is functional,” Cas tells him. “It is me who is malfunctioning.” His skin turns a brilliant shade of purple, then orange.
“Dean,” he slurs. Dean loves his name when Cas says it like that. Dean could listen to his name in Cas’s wet-open mouth forever.
“Hoo boy,” Dean says, wondering where in the fresh hell he’s going to start. He looks at the angel blade. “Firstly,” he says, “where in God’s name were you hiding

Very light on his toes, isn’t he, Ves? Which is surprising given he weighs as much as a horse and eats like one, too. Biceps to the gods, honestly. He once carried an injured soldier eight miles, did you know that? The guy was probably twice my weight, but Geralt’s never carried
And that’s how Dean ends up riding Cas like a two-bit bronco, fisting himself roughly at the same time, so overcome with how stupid-in-love he is that he can barely string a sentence together, forming scrambled half-words to tell Cas how good he feels, and how perfect he is, and how much he loves this.

Dean’s crying, of course he is. All the weeks of blood and dirt and grime are nothing in the face of this. One last apocalypse to see them through. Sam kisses his knee. “Say it,” he begs. There’s time for this. There’s time for this.

“You,” he tells Cas, “are going to… you’re going to sit there and… do the thing. You know. And then you are going to thank me for being a

Cas makes an odd noise, and actually, oh, it wasn’t Cas, it was him.
He doesn’t start at the wings themselves. He gets himself comfy on the back of Cas’s thighs and puts Brooklyn-99 on to play quietly in the background, and when he puts his hands on his boyfriend he ends up starting at Cas’s shoulders first. He’s not a masseuse or anything. He doesn’t really know what he’s doing. But the expensive feather oil warms up quickly in his hands and Cas makes a pleased sound when Dean rubs circles over the muscles on either side of his shoulder blades.

Will’s bloodlust wasn’t like Hannibal’s. Hannibal liked the craft of it, the stink of it. The part when he was knuckles-deep in someone’s body and the organ in his hand was still throbbing, twitching. The part when the body belonged more to him than it had ever belonged to the original owner.

“I should have let it resolve its purpose on my vessel,” Cas says, “instead of absorbing it.” He wrinkles his nose, except his nose keeps going back until it’s flat against his face. Like he’s Volde-fucking-mort. Not cool. “It is—” he says, hiccups, “—contaminating me.”
Honestly he’d kind of figured that sex was off the cards, maybe because the last (only) time Cas had ever had sex had been with that April chick, and that had gone down like a lead balloon, so maybe Cas would never want
“Could you… help… yourself… with the—” Dean waves vaguely at the direction of Cas’s crotch. He realises Cas probably can’t see him, but is incapable of adding any more context to his suggestion.

And he kisses Dean.

“He’s fine, he’s doing something, I didn’t really understand, said he had to realign the planes, I don’t know.” He jerks his thumb over his shoulder and Cas is laid out in the backseat, eyes half-closed and breathing evenly, and Dean thinks, no, not that Cas, the

No luck.
And he’s so shocked by the fact that he had touched Cas’s
“Did you enjoy that?” Hannibal asked. He slid two gloved fingers into Will’s mouth so Will couldn’t respond, only follow the motion of Hannibal’s hand to nod. Hannibal dug fingertips into the soft fleshy part beneath Will’s tongue, then put his thumb on the outside and squeezed, trying to make the fingers meet. Will coughed and drooled but didn’t move. Usually Hannibal despised human fluids, the pervasive drip of anything that wasn’t blood. But Will was different. His tears. His spit. His come. All set to a dial that only Hannibal controlled.

The give is like snow at the top of a mountain. It lands slow, intoxicating. And then it builds, and Lucifer presses down against it and there’s resistance for only a heartbeat that could be years, but then the snow piles up and it breaks in an avalanche, taking the resistance with it.
Being human sucks, so he might as well, too.
“Okay,” Dean agrees, because it’s easier to agree. “It hasn’t killed me.” He tries to cough again but he can’t clench anything below his neck and he ends up sort of choking on blood instead, until Cas helps him roll onto his side so the whole fucking mess—his liquefied internal organs, no doubt—can dribble out. Cas uses the opportunity to start shredding his shirt. Well, what remains of his shirt, anyway. He’s doing the thing where he talks Dean through every step

Cas puts the angel blade in Dean’s hand and closes Dean’s fingers around it. “The post-coital ritual,” he agrees solemnly.
“Cas?!”
Sam doesn’t answer, just curves his body around the shape of her and puts his hand around her waist and leaves the rest of the bed empty as though someone else will come to claim the vacant space.
"You're so pretty down there," Geralt tells him. "Using your mouth for something useful, finally."
“You get out,” Dean snaps at him, viciously rubbing himself, barely even feeling the pleasure over the sound of Cas collapsing all around him. He claws at the feathers with his left hand, fingers spasming through the pain of burning alive. Grabs whatever’s closest and hauls it in tight, surrounds himself in whatever he can reach. Right hand busy on his dick, doing what he can to make this good. Tight at the base, then all the way up. He rubs callouses into the underside, gets feathers soft and electric against his balls and realises in a distant sort of way that it’s

Dean’s brought the crop with him. He puts one foot on either side of Sam’s bent legs so Sam’s head is practically resting against his crotch. He touches one of Sam’s shoulder’s with the folded leather head, and Sam just breathes, not moving an inch. Not like when they first did this, when Sam had to be fully clothed, upright, towering over Dean and whatever other demons–both real and imagined–he was fighting.
“YOU BETTER NOT BE DYING,” he bellows. How dare the universe make him realise he was in-fucking-love and then ruin it all by letting Cas die.

and not in the way the waterfall was too much. It’s good but it’s like there’s something else in it too. His poor confused body wants more—he’s already Pavloved himself into enjoying Cas like that. So he’s reaching for the next feather with his other hand before he even fully registers that this might be too much for him to live through. The electricity that follows is like licking the mains at a power plant. His dick reacts instinctually, already accustomed to

Dean only ever says please when he’s got Sam underneath him. At least that’s what it’s like here, when they’re together like this. Dean shapes the word against Sam’s skin and it’s nothing like the last time, it’s nothing like Dean clutching at his jacket, trying to get him to stay.

“Well, if you insist.” He puts a hand on Jaskier’s hip and Jaskier flinches up into him, his hips stuttering towards Geralt like his body already knows exactly who it belongs to. His cock bounces in the air between them, obscene and desperate. The vines aren’t stimulating him at all, just holding him tight. That must be infuriating.

Little flexible sprigs begin to curl around his nipples, his toes, his balls. The inquisitive ones begin to probe at the tip of his cock and down to his ass and Jaskier starts thrashing against them.
Cas didn’t stop. More and more tentacles kept pouring out of the place where his wings used to be, until all Dean could see was black. They plugged up his nose, his ears. They covered his eyes in thick, oozing tendrils, so the only thing he had left was the weight of Sam against him. The heavy thickening of his cock against Dean’s belly.

His forehead is pressed against the back of the front seat and Dean grinds it into place one-handed while he fishes himself out of his jeans with the other.

“Drop,” Hannibal told him, and Will dropped. His hands went wide. His knees even wider. A perfectly trained doll, though of course no doll was quite like him. Hannibal tucked a foot under Will’s crotch, between his body and the corpse’s. It didn’t matter if Will was hard or not, it rarely mattered. A fine tremor ran over his body and he stayed where he was, splayed out and waiting for the command.
He gets his hands in the downy coverts at the top of Sam’s wings, and yanks the wings back and down, so they’re cradling his dick. The tingle-spark of Sam’s not-quite-grace flushing him hot all over.

He’s feeling good right up to the point where Cas turns his face into Dean’s neck and says, all whisper-quiet, “I won’t fight, Dean.”
And it’s so so easy to just… let himself feel it. The pleasure ratchets up and every stroke of his hand feels like the

Cas is saying something, not even in English, might be Enochian or might not be anything at all. Dean’s name. Dean’s name again. He’s begging. Apologising. He spills over Dean in waves that burn too bright, and he fills Dean too full, but keeps going, surging through him. Dean, he says again, with Dean’s mouth, and he lurches impossibly further in. Dean can’t feel his hand working anymore but he doesn’t have to, Cas fills him there, too, from the inside, Dean’s cock bursting with it, his balls cradled in it, Cas singing through all of him all at once, his mouth, his belly, his ass, his cock, from the root right to the tip in a sweep of energy that makes him want to scream, and again, and again, and for a moment it feels so blindingly good that he’s sure the feeling’s about to get sucked right out of him like all the other times before, but Cas presses in again, shifting, pooling, speaking to him from the inside, letting him closer than he’s been before, the high higher than he’s been before, a cliff face he’s hurtling towards—

“Work with me here,” he snarls at Cas’s placid face, something weird happening inside him as he drop-kicks his brain into another dimension for even thinking about what sounds Cas

Better than anything he’s ever experienced in his life. What’s Cas doing walking around with this inside him? He shoves his face in, and the water jams up into his nostrils, his mouth, takes his breath away except it doesn’t feel like suffocating, it feels like flying, it feels like a thousand things and nothing at all, like he’s overflowing with it. He wants to tear his skin off, get that feeling in his blood, get it under his ribs, let it eat him alive. It’s not just pleasure, it’s more, it’s everything, it’s, it’s
Cas opens his mouth…
Bad news first, you know the rule.
“None of that,” Cas tells him. He’s holding a blood-soaked rag against the place where Dean’s belly button might have been. “No goodbyes, Dean.” He leans down over him. “No goodbyes, because you’re not going anywhere.”
and Cas’s clothes disappear.
Cas is handing him the angel blade.
"Step back through," Cas breathes, feathers crowding out everything else. "I won’t let you lose yourself again."
The expensive feather oil warms up quickly in his hands and Cas makes a pleased sound when Dean rubs circles over the muscles on either side of his shoulder blades.
“Oh,” Jaskier says, aiming for nonchalance and arriving instead at breathless. “Do you? I had no idea.”

“That was a great yell,” Sam screamed from two branches up. He clambered along his branch and then down the trunk to join Cas on his branch.
He’s so close to being Lucifer’s. Just one more push.

His whole arm lights up, sensation so strong it fills him like good whiskey, the best whiskey, better than whiskey, better than

Cas looks up at him with the kicked puppy expression. Not the expression that a kicked puppy would wear, but the expression that would literally make puppies kick themselves out of sheer misery.

Sam goes glaze-eyed and panting, halfway to that other place where he’s more angel than human, without really being either. “Dean,” he slurs. His eyes are open but he’s staring at things that aren’t here, no doubt centered entirely in the plane where Dean’s cock is ruffling him up something awful, making a mess out of him, making him
Sam pokes him with the handle of the broom Dean had used earlier, and Dean swats it away. Oh, wow, his head feels like gravy. Like packet-mix gravy.

Sam writhes in place, trying to reach over his shoulder to get to Dean. Dean catches his hands and puts them back on the leather in front of him.
He kissed back down Sam’s cock and used just the barely-there press of his fingertips to ease Sam’s foreskin down, revealing the pretty pink head beneath. Sam’s breath hitched and his thighs flinched together for just a moment before easing back down, even further apart than before, guided by Cas’s gentle hands.
Cas’s lips twitch up a bit, as though he can hear him.
Sam scratches Dean’s scalp while Dean messily does his best to suck Sam off, all while he desperately tries to chase his own pleasure.
“ENGLISH, SAM!”
Geralt unbottens his trousers.
“My feet hurt if I spend too long on them. My eyes hurt if I spend too long researching. My penis hurts every morning. My back hurts if I—”
He rolls up his sleeves.

But Dean won’t let that happen, screams agony, holy words, tongue of the gods, and the contamination lets go all at once, relinquished at the last second, and he collapses in on himself, flung loose, and he’s not Cas, he’s Dean, mostly, maybe, he thinks, he thinks, his body just one form, and the poison is gone and the second finally ends and he blinks and he’s Dean again, properly, or what’s left of Dean, and Sam’s voice cuts through the pain just long enough for him to turn towards it—inwards, again, Cas-wards,
But he wasn’t good. He wasn’t even all that ashamed. Especially when Sam had basically been served up to him on a silver platter.

that’s him.
Cas urges against his skin, and Dean lets the feathers tremble through him, lets the electricity shake him from the inside out as he wraps his hand back into place and closes his eyes so he can better feel the way he’s just so… smothered. Covered completely in Cas. He can’t even feel the wooden beam beneath him, or whatever it is that he’s teetering on top of now. It’s just the silky feeling of feathers that aren’t actually feathers. It’s the silky feeling of
He’s above the spinning waterfall, now, he’s pretty sure he’s on a roof, pretty sure Cas is saying something, maybe, his voice sounds so good, as good as the water, and he clambers—downwards, maybe, Cas-wards, through the roof, coming out of the ceiling, more in the Cas plane than out of it, and the wing catches him again, lifts him up, sweeps through him again, even while he fights it, desperate not to get taken away, desperate for more, desperate to drown in it, he feels the tiny remnant traces get cleaned out of his insides and he’s—

He peeled Sam out of his shoes and jacket, and let him collapse backwards onto the couch. He was so long that his feet stuck out at one end and his head stuck out at the other. There was so much of him, and though he hadn’t grown into all that loose-limbed awkwardness yet, Cas wouldn’t want him any other way.

“So, if that’s everything, then, I guess I’d better get back to rawing an angel, huh?”
Awake, Sam was shy, inquisitive. Big-eyed and bigger-bodied, taking up too much room despite his best attempts at curling into his own centre of mass. Asleep, however… Cas could see how handsome he would one day be, though he wasn’t quite there yet. For now he was…

“I like my dick TOO!”
“That’s nice,” Dean tells him stoically, then calls over his shoulder without taking his eyes of Cas. “Sam? What the hell was in those bags?”
Castiel bit savagely into the meat of Sam’s pectoral muscle, then soothed the bite with his tongue. Before this wedding had been arranged, Sam had been destined for a life as a knight. He was thick, strong. No part of him was soft.

Dean tells him, but he lifts his hand barely an inch before the feathers pile high and push it back down, and he wraps his fingers around himself with feathers in the way, pressing the Cas-ness of them into the skin of his dick while Cas makes a sound like air, billowing around him. He stops trying to fight the feathers, then, and lets his knees fall to each side to give himself more room. He wraps more feathers in his fist and strokes very carefully, just once, which doesn’t feel like anything he’s ever done in his life, unless he’s ever jerked off while smothered beneath a mountain of pillows that were slowly electrocuting him into the best kind of insanity.

They try to get him into the backseat with as little movement as possible but he blacks out again anyway, wakes with his head in Cas’s lap.

Nothing’s coming out right, even though this is

It gets worse the higher he gets. The feathers burn on contact, as good as the waterfall was but as though they’re made of fire instead, so the good and the bad get all mixed up and he can barely see through it. He gets as high as he can, until he feels like his skin’s about to get sucked right off his bones, and then he clenches his eyes shut and wraps a hand around himself and forces it to happen—forces himself to move.
“Oh, here we go.”

loud enough that Jaskier knows there’s going to be a dark bruise there tomorrow. Jaskier tries to draw him back in but Geralt never goes anywhere he doesn’t want to go, preferring to push Jaskier into place instead. Which is why one firm hand on Jaskier’s shoulder has his knees colliding with the floor.

“You flirt,” Dean says as the skin heals. He kisses the inside of Sam’s knee, and then higher. Sam takes a fistful of his hair and drags him up on his knees to kiss him properly. Dean licks into Sam’s mouth and Sam bites him for the insolence, sucking the blood straight off Dean’s tongue. Dean just grins and opens wider, grinding his hips into the base of Sam’s throne while Sam sucks on his tongue. His hands creep down; one towards Sam’s cock and one towards his own.

Cas tells him, and he’s trying to sound all intimidating but really he just sounds desperate. Dean hasn’t even gotten to the good bit yet.
And at the last possible second Dean closes his eyes and shoves his hand up above his head, straight into the pulsing poisonous contamination, and it sucks him in like a void as he comes hard, finally, Cas rocketing through his veins, spreading from his cock outwards while the void spreads down his arm in counterpoint. He gets torn in half, diagonally through the chest, his ribcage splintering under the dual pressure but he’s still coming, somehow, all that Cas-ness inside him surging out, and everywhere Cas touches the contamination pulls back and Dean roars at it, feels his eyes blister in their sockets as Cas bursts free from there, too, burning everything in his path, and the curse is finally getting what it wants but it’s going to take Dean with it.

“I am unable to remove the foreign element.”
Sam waves his hand at Cas. “I dunno, wherever he is?”
“Oh, God,” he says, turning his head towards where he heard the sound Jack made. Sam kisses him again, and when Dean doesn’t immediately turn back into it Sam grabs his cheeks and makes him, digs fingers in so he can lick into Dean’s mouth.
They’re not teasing.
“What’s so wrong with being human?” he finally asks.
“Hoo-kay!” Dean laughs, a little shrill. “Back it up there, buddy, or I’m not going to be able to help you out at all!”
They had… made sense, kind of. This is… this is something else. There are feathers popping into existence mid-air, and things exploding in the distance, and one of the wheels is crashing into the other.

He grabs fistfuls of them, rough, and uses the leverage to pull himself upright, only to get immediately shoved back down by another mountain of them. He lands on his knees, which would hurt except he’s cushioned by—surprise, surprise—
“I’m not losing you,” Sam tells him. He checks his watch. Still ten minutes left. That’s a long goodbye, for them. But this one will be the last one. There’ll be no coming back. He kneels next to Dean’s chair, puts his forehead on Dean’s knee.
Which, okay. Rude. But still... He gets his hands on Geralt’s hips and tries to yank him in deeper, faster, but Geralt slows right down, barely even concerned though Jaskier’s using all his strength. If Geralt wanted to sheath himself in Jaskier’s throat and fuck him until he passed out there’s nothing Jaskier could do about it. He moans because yes, actually, Geralt’s done that before and he could do it now if he wants. Jaskier

He extends his hand into the mass of feathers, and just like the harp strings they bend around him and then push back. His fingers tingle, and he flexes them, crooks around one enormous feather—the flight feather?—which slides through his hand like smoke. It shoots a wave of tingles up his arm, almost
Geralt obligingly reroutes them south, and he’s undressed already so Jaskier’s wrapping his fingers around Geralt’s cock before his head’s even stopped spinning. He’s only just finished playing for the drunkards downstairs, and this is the exact reward he was hoping for.

They barely make it out of the town before Dean’s throwing the car into the first semi-private off-road he can see and grabbing for Sam like he’s a drowning man. Sam’s just as grabby, all clenching hands and teeth in Dean’s neck; the way he always gets when a hunt’s gone well and they’re both still running high on adrenaline. Dean’s always hot for Sam but like this, God, like this he’d do anything in the world to get to him.
In the barn. His body is still in the barn. “Oh, you’ve got to be kidding.” He fumbles around the damn beam, distantly aware that if anyone walked in they’d see him in his birthday suit blindly blundering around like a lunatic. How come Cas’s wheels and shit can go through walls and he can’t?

“Spit it out!”
Cas says, almost gone, but his mouth fills with water, and even though it’s boiling and hissing steam he swallows quick, feels Cas go down this time, properly, fill him up from the inside. And Cas says his name again but from his belly this time, or wherever his belly is in this plane, and Dean opens wide again and it hurts, the inside of his mouth is blister-burnt, or at least it feels that way, but he opens wide all the same and gets another mouthful of Cas, another mouthful that turns to water as soon as it’s in him and he swallows that down, too, his poor throat working around the pain. And he’s finally feeling Cas again, finally getting some of that good electricity, the kind that makes his toes curl, makes him fall face-first into whatever’s left of Cas’s body and gulp him down, his hand working feverishly between his legs.
“You aren’t cheap whiskey,” he tells the wing, stupid with it, and opens wide to try again. He’s too close to the contamination and his teeth feel like they’re going to crack under the pressure but he digs into Cas anyway, drags him in, swallows dry because there’s nothing actually in his mouth, he can’t swallow

His cock isn’t human anymore but Dean’s just as hungry for it, licking the hard ridges and sucking urgently at the pointed head.

Sam spreads his legs a little and Dean falls into him, slotting up right where he belongs.

The feeling of getting interdimensionally electrocuted is… It’s something, alright. Like sticking a fork into a toaster except the toaster only operates at the lowest frequency available. He’s grateful that he isn’t choking to death in the pleasure waterfall thing, but getting very slowly tortured by pleasure zaps is going to kill him just as surely.
“These better not blink at me,” Dean says warily, and pokes one.
“Give in,” Lucifer tells him gently, and Sam hiccoughs on a silent sob, desperate in his misery because he thinks he’s already given in. He thinks that a muffled
tries to say Sam’s name again and there’s his body after all, jeans and a tee and his belt too tight, oh, oops, and he says, “It’s okay, Sam, I have him,” which is, odd, that’s odd, and then Sam’s hands are over
“What?” Dean asks, nervous. He resists the urge to slap Cas out of whatever trance he’s in. “What’s wrong with your vessel?”
Dean slides the crop down the back of Sam’s shoulder, then over each bump of his vertebrae. Sam’s breath is hot even through the denim. He’s calm, meditative. Dean circles around to his other shoulder, then follows the same path back down, except this time at the top of the arc he taps the crop right in the center of Sam’s back.

A wing tries to shepherd him backwards, but it goes grey and splinters apart even as he’s watching.
Maybe the vines are telepathic or something, because they wind further down Jaskier’s legs to pull at his ankles, stretching them out wide enough that the strain must be surpassing discomfort and heading straight for pain. Geralt grabs for the silver sword because watching Jaskier get stripped is one thing but watching him get dismembered isn’t quite as sexy.
he could think about the barn and make all this disappear and then it would stop hurting. The fires are splintering his bones, pooling through his arm so slowly, and he could leave, he could, he could.
Cas’s wings flared out behind him except they weren’t wings anymore, they were dark, oozing masses of malevolent intent.
The wing peels away from him, trembling, feathers spilling off it like autumn leaves, tumbling Cas-wards. He gets a moment to look around him: the wheels are spinning faster than before, and he tries not to stare longingly at the ring of water, which is slowly solidifying to become the same as the other spinning wheels. The huge wing suspended in the centre of the barn has curled in on itself, pulsing, and he wonders if he’s going to get to jack himself off inside of
At least he’s mostly back in the right plane or dimension or whatever. The place where things go down because of gravity, not any which way they damn please.

Sam was already sucking his dick. Wow, that was fast. Aren’t bats cool?
“Oh no,” he says out loud.
like. He thinks about Lisa, and then Cassie, and that girl at the diner last month who’s lips tasted like coffee. He’s thinking about how she kissed—and where she’d kissed—and then he lurches suddenly as the feathers he’s leaning against fall apart and he almost goes straight through the other side of the wing. Christ, ah fuck, fuck,
“Nope!” he yells.

it hurts so bad, but the poison slinks away beneath his hands, his voice thundering, he’s more Cas than not. He can feel his whole decayed body—the enormity of it in this plane, and all the other planes. All the parts that aren’t in any plane at all. All the parts that take a whole plane to themselves. And the fragile human, more important than all of it, ripping himself apart right in the centre to try to save him. He crashes, burns, tears the poison from the crevices, catches Dean around the waist and shields him as best as he can, even while he uses Dean’s hands to rain holy fire down on the contamination, the rest of him splintering like light across a horizon, rupturing from the outside in, his body, his real one, sustained by strings that are all being held in the fleshy weak cradle of a human. Let it die, he thinks, let it all die if only Dean survives.
“Cas,” Dean warned.
“Say that again,” he threatens, voice pitched way down in the dark where it’s never had any right being. Especially not when this is
he’d said,
“Yeah, I can—I can see that.” Cas’s eyes appear to have three pupils each. Though it doesn’t stop him from continuing to stare calmly ahead, still expressionless.
“It’s just a hex, right? He just has to… wait it out.”
Dean sniggers, then jumps when a waterfall bursts to life beside him, flowing skywards. A perfect mirror flows on the other side of the barn, cascading downwards, and even as he watches another springs above him, and another below. He’s a little unsure how he’s seeing things through the actual
This time it’s Dean’s turn to pause. A perfectly formed sphere floats past before splitting into several new spheres. The new spheres blink at him, and then pop in slow motion.

“Rivia,” Jaskier says, being cheeky because he knows what’s got Geralt in a mood and he’s the one who caused it. He rubs his fingertips along the base of Geralt’s cock, picking out the pattern of veins that are as familiar as his lute strings. He could probably play them just as effectively. Make Geralt sing. He hums the opening lines of a song that doesn’t exist yet. “And to what do I owe this pleas–a

he wants to cry with it, he’s never felt so right, can’t believe he could have had this and didn’t, can’t imagine a world without it, doesn’t want to, wants to open himself up to it forever—feels himself step forward on trembling legs and then his whole body is in the waterfall and it spins him off the ground, backwards, up into the air, back down, flowing around his legs and arms and in between every hair on his head and filling him up, up, up, and he spins down with the waterfall, into the earth, back up through the barn, his body passing effortlessly through the walls now, can’t imagine how he couldn’t go through them before, not when he’s like this, so full of Cas, almost a part of him, filled by—Cas, specifically, of course, it’s finding his insides and making everything—more, the Casness, the—everything, the water propelling him, getting up between his legs, in him there, too, so good he’s sure he’s coming, must be, except even coming doesn’t feel as good as this, just one eternal orgasm while he—

“Did anyone prepare you?” he asked, a dark jealousy twisting in his gut. Sometimes boys were fucked before marriage, so they weren’t as likely to bleed out on their wedding bed.

He trailed his kisses lower. He opened his mouth wide to breathe warmth over where Sam’s cock lay soft and sleepy, a direct mirror of its owner. He kissed it directly on the tip, and kitten-licked up to Sam’s belly, trying not to go too fast, trying to enjoy this while it lasted. He wondered if his son had ever done this before. Or if Sam had ever done this for his son. Is that what they were to each other? Or would he be the first to taste Sam here?

Jack makes the tiniest noise. A startled, excited
There are golden strings connecting the spinning wheels to the place where Cas’s body is still sitting peacefully on the barn floor. Tentatively, Dean touches one of the strings. It doesn’t immediately explode or anything so he presses a little harder. It bends slightly, and then bends back into place, giving the impression that it’s pushing back against Dean as it does.
“Do the thing,” Dean begs of him. “The wings, Sam, show me the—”
“Did you at least find a cure?”
He tried to ignore it, but his own cock was filling, too. Dozens of searching, sucking tentacles had plastered to his balls and the sensitive insides of his thighs. Another was exploring the head of his dick, dipping into his slit. He tried to shake his head, but the tentacle around his neck thickened and tightened, forcing him to arch backwards. Tendrils wrapped around and around his sack, stretching it past the point of pleasure, until his balls felt crushed and vulnerable. He wrenched against the things holding him but there wasn’t any give

“Apologies,” Cas says, in the exact same tone. “Can you hear me now?”
They came at the same time, and it was glorious, it was wonderful, it was very
“King,” Dean greets, the word dripping thick from between his red-dyed lips.
Dean shudders and presses even closer forward, clenching and rocking to try and get the pressure deeper, right where he wants it. He lays flat over Sam’s lap and nuzzles into Sam’s crotch, trying to get to his cock with nothing but his mouth.
“What exactly do you think I’m going to be able to help with here, Cas?”
The tentacle rammed home.
He uses his free hand to reach around and cup Sam through his jeans.
did he—
“Why’d you stop?” he asks the back of Sam’s head, because he’s sitting in the backseat now, how odd, and Sam spins to face him with his eyes open wide, and for a moment Dean worries that Sam heard him tell Cas he loves him, but that can’t be right because surely Sam already knew, that’s why he left Dean with Cas, and he’s about to ask Sam again but Sam says—
Oops, bye Ves. Doesn’t matter, I’ll cut that scene later. Okay, where was I? Where are my notes… Blah blah fighting skills blah blah monster killing blah blah witcher witcher blah blah… Ah! Okay, here we go, from the top… [
And then the tentacles went for their dicks.
Finally, someone who appreciates my writing talents.
That… is not what he expected.
Very good thinking, by the way; giving the name of your location right at the beginning. I’m sure that’ll make it much easier for Sir Witcher to find you. If he’s still listening in, that is.
He hooks it under Dean’s chin, and with a thought it begins to retract into the ceiling, forcing Dean’s head higher and higher.
Steve leans in, tilts his head. He closes his eyes at the last second, and there’s a faint
“Sucker,” he sniggers, then, “Now where were we?” He looks around, but Cas doesn’t magically re-materialise. He flaps his hands a bit, hoping he’ll feel some goddamn feathers or something, but it’s just… air.
Third question: could you tell us any stories from Geralt’s youth?
a what now?
“Say it,” he say again, voice wet, face wet, heart wet. Each thudding pulse is for Dean. He could count the remaining heartbeats on both hands.
Final question: are witchers naturally noncommunicative or is it just me?
Cas goes from hard to
I’M NOT GOING ON YOUR DAMN SHOW, BARD
“Being human sucks,” Cas says. Dean looks up at him but Cas isn’t really doing anything, just miserably staring down at his sandwich like it’s just developed sentience to tell him he has a bad haircut.
Being in love is unfamiliar territory that he can panic about later, but giving someone a good time in the sack is something he can do right now. And he’s historically been very good at it. He’s definitely not going to let a couple of thousand extra limbs get in his way.
Will’s bloodlust wasn’t like Hannibal’s.
Sam didn’t so much as twitch when Cas finally made contact. Cas lifted his shirt further out of the way and spread his palms flat on all that wonderful golden skin. He kissed Sam’s stomach. Nipped him gently with his teeth. The tiniest furrow appeared between Sam’s brows but was gone a moment later. He snuffled in his sleep, toes curling in his socks. But the rest of him stayed loose and warm and welcoming.
“Did you just come?” he gapes, while the answer is still throbbing beneath his fingers, very evidently continuing to do exactly that. “Cas,
This is
Dean grabs Cas’s coat and shakes it a bit. “He’s just making sounds! He’s not—Cas, you’re freaking me out, man.”
“Ouch,” Jaskier says, but his hands are making their way to Geralt before they even know which way Geralt is.
(See the end of the chapter for
The enormous wing in the centre of Cas’s body pops and churns, shadows arcing off it like eruptions.
“Stay,” he orders. “You know what to do.”
“Hi!” Sam bellowed back.

he manages, trying to sound accusatory but landing somewhere in the realm of an overcooked Thanksgiving turkey.
It isn’t—good. It isn’t. It’s barely even okay. The wing is… it’s too much. Touching it is
Cas demands, which isn’t an answer at all, and then one of the weird floaty bubble things bumps his shoulder and splits into ten more bubbles, which each split into ten
The wing disintegrates on impact, turning into a cloud of ash.
Dean fights. “I’m right here, I’m not going anywhere.” His hands twist beneath the knots, searching for a loose thread. But Sam learned how to restrain someone from Dean, who learned from John, and there’s nothing to grab. No leeway. No second chances.
“Is this, like, a kink thing?”
like the waterfall except (mercifully) milder. He doesn’t think he could survive another encounter with the full force of Cas’s…
Cas makes another affirmative-ish sound which is more of a hum than any actual word. Dean drags his thumbs down the sides of his spine, bumping almost lazily over each vertebrae. He reaches the place where Cas’s skin starts to prickle a bit; where the plane that Cas’s wings are on meets the plane that Dean’s on. There’s no definitive line between one and the other, at least, not one that Dean can tell. There’s just Cas’s soft, relaxed body and then his enormous, shifting wings.
“Kneel,” Cas said, with utmost calm.

“I know it’s me,” Geralt snaps, tearing into Jaskier’s clothes. “Everyone with a pair of eyes and ears knows it’s me.” He gives up on Jaskier’s belt and simply shoves Jaskier’s trousers down around his knees. Ow,
It doesn’t take long after that. A couple more well-timed remarks, a casual comment over dinner, and then Sam’s leading Jack into the bedroom where he’s already got Dean all strung out and wanting.
“His wavelengths are—” Dean tells him, flapping his hand to indicate where Cas is blowing a steady stream of bubbles out of both nostrils.
Dean crops him until he’s gone from pink to cherry red, and Sam takes it so well, making small cries at the hardest hits but staying right where he is, staying right here with Dean where the pain is only temporary and it’s being overseen by someone he trusts.
The feathers wrap around each of his arms, small ones twisting in between his fingers, skimming under his skin in electric little waves. He grits his teeth against the glide of pleasure, trying to remind his dick that he’s supposed to be here for
“Then I’ll make you.”
then Jaskier misses it entirely.
