William sighed, “You ask him, I am  working very hard to delete this memory.”
Mycroft and Ella separated and went to their own side of the strip.
“John, I can’t seem to find my pants or my trousers,” said Sherlock, bursting out into a greater wave of laughter.
John sighed, “exactly what you thought would happen.”
John shrugged, "I mean I think Sherlock has something he wants to talk about but I am not sure if he wants me in on the conversation."
Mycroft and Andrea emerged onto the roof, Ella stood next to a group of teenagers in the middle of the strip. "Mycroft, are you fine with us just using the jackets, I mean I think we both are in fairly decent clothes for the rest of this task."
John closed his eyes and took a deep breath, he knew that Sherlock wasn’t doing it on purpose, but his proximity to his cock and  his groaning was making him feel feelings he trying to crush at the moment, because just earlier that day physical intimacy was definitely one of those topics on the table for therapy. He tried to will away the slowly developing stiffness, he hoped Sherlock couldn’t feel it. Sherlock wiggled a bit more in John’s lap, and the movement made John gasp, because it felt really good. He forced himself to look down at Sherlock.
Jesus christ this is long... but it was fun.
“Wait you went home with him!” Said Irene with a little jump, clapping her hands together, she was rather excited to see Sherlock in such a manner.
Sherlock leaned against John’s chest as John held on to him. He felt John’s cock still hard in him, and it was getting a little bit uncomfortable, so he rolled off John and delivered a quick kiss to John’s lips before getting off the bed, John was about to say something before Sherlock grabbed John by his legs and positionsd him to sitting at the edge of the bed. He dropped to his knees and proceeded to start licking his cum off of John’s boots. Sherlock moaned as John started running his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. He started to untie John’s boots and reached up to pull down John’s trousers and pants. Sherlock grabbed another condom off the bedside table and quickly removed John’s condom and rolled the second one on with his mouth.
"I can do that, I'll have to leave him a bit tied up if you know what I mean," said Crystal with a smile.
Sherlock was again lost in thought he wasn’t sure what exactly wanted and things weren’t really about him unless things were going wrong and he couldn’t for the life of him think what was wrong. He didn’t know why John pushed him off. Maybe John thought the punishment wasn’t enough. Maybe he didn’t actually want Sherlock and was having second thoughts on what he wanted and maybe Sherlock wasn’t what he wanted. Maybe...
"You've really gotten much more annoying since you've started taking your therapy seriously. It's amusing you almost act like this will make you be able to live amongst the goldfish," snapped back Mycroft.
Molly cocked her head to the side as she looked at John and Sherlock, “you know what Sherlock you have been full of surprises tonight, look at you all smiling and apologizing, I don’t know what to make of it.”
"I almost think Mycroft is your trigger," said Siger as he stared down his eldest son.
John laughed as he washed his hands and exited the bathroom.
"And Mycroft can go fuck off," tossed in Sherlock.
Sherlock pulled off John’s cock with an audible pop, he winked at John as he took a step way to his bedroom.
“John I haven’t had enough brain cells to spare to even think where I knew this man,” Replied Sherlock with a shrug.
He pulled out a device that looked like GPS, with some random bright lights on top, it was a cloaking device, that created a blind spot on all the CCTV devices as he passed by, the bright blinking lights made sure that any cameras that were still on, couldn’t get a clear look. It also had the capability of turning all the lights ahead of him green. He pulled on a hoodie and a baseball cap.  And with that he tore down the road, he didn’t really care where he was going as long as he didn’t kill anyone or did any property damage he was going to be okay.
“And nice to see you Mr. Holmes,” replied John.
"Of course, that would be ideal," replied Kayla.
“Na-ah,” snapped one of the teens. He brought his computer over and showed Andrea the screen. The scoring system had computer capabilities, and it showed that Ella did indeed strike one second faster than Mycroft.
"What Sherlock are you at a loss for words? That rarely happens, oh I am just going to have to cherish this moment,” said Mycroft with a slight smile. Mycroft noticed his eyes and they were flickering, he didn’t pay much mind to it. Sherlock looked like he was chewing on something, but him eating was too damn rare. "Chewing on your words aren't you, don't worry they'll come eventually. Can you shut that hound up?"
“John, Moriarty had snipers trained on you, Lestrade, and Mrs. Hudson, if I didn’t jump you would all be dead,” explained Sherlock as he measured John’s inseam. He cursed himself when he started to feel a slight blush spread across his face as he accidentally brushed the back of his hand across John’s cock. “I didn’t want to leave you, but I would do anything to keep you safe.” He gasped when he felt John touch the side of his face.
"Nah, I bet his brother would give me hell and I don't need that in my life. Still don't really get how he graduated with honors. He was also really fucking good with paying rent, but we over charged him and used the money to pay for things for our less fortunate housemates. I'm so glad he never took up meth, because the smell of that is just super annoying," said Blaze. "Oh g-d I was so glad he never took to making drugs in his home lab. I am just surprised it took so long for him to snap, unfortunately he busted the wrong computer. Definitely going to knock him out should I ever see him again."
“Oh, did you get the data you needed?” Asked Mrs. Hudson.
Sherlock took the offered drink and started to take small sips of the electrolyte water John offered him.” He smiled at John, curious of what he had in store for him. He let himself get wrapped around by John’s arms. He felt safe, which wasn’t always a feeling he had access to, but he had it now and that’s all that matters.
Violet's eyes narrowed at Mycroft, "we went to visit all the neighbors and not one of them had a bug, we used an anti surveillance device to sweep it, nothing was found. Sure there was plenty of CCTV cameras lying on public property but none of them was in their houses. We are dealing with more surveillance than the normal  family."
“What do people usually say?” Said John.
“Okay well see you later,” replied Crystal.
Siger shifted uncomfortably, "but what if we didn't? Why did we trust Ruddy, none of us knew what the hell he was doing, and Mycroft was 18 when Ruddy had him inform us that Eurus was supposedly dead. I mean Mycroft seems to have sucked into whatever secret world Ruddy had at a pretty young age. Like why did we put so much on Mycroft? And like Sherlock was always going on about how Mycroft was always watching him and interfering with his social life when he left for school, I mean if it wasn't for Mycroft being so set on making sure Sherlock met the right people to the point that he blew up and started to spend time with only the worst of people. I mean do you think he would've had that rough spot? I know you have found just as many hidden cameras as I have. I think that changes how people act, and as much as I have tried to think that this is how every family experiences CCTV, I am starting to think it isn't. I mean I am sure if Mycroft left his post the government would fall and it is a rather precarious time to fall apart. But what if we just gave Sherlock or John an incentive to just leave for a place with a lot less surveillance especially surveillance run by his literal big brother. Do you think he would be different?"
Mycroft was sitting on another chair tapping his umbrella against his leg. His terms were written with speed, so he had to wait for the rest of his family to finish.
Mycroft nodded his head in acknowledgment. His parents got up and exited for the second time today. Mycroft called out to his parents, "also I am going to have to charge you for the door."
In the early day of William’s transition, he tried out different names. Sometimes, Papa and Dad would take him to different restaurants and cafes to see how it felt to react to the name. But sometimes his Dad would say something that made him think twice about a name.
John smiled against Sherlock’s neck, “love you too.” He pressed a few soft kisses along his jawline. He rolled Sherlock onto his back.
“Yeah I am on my way to a warehouse party, the DJ set has an interesting mix of post modern jazz and breakbeat DJs,” replied Wiggins with a slight shrug.
"My name is not Anthea, you've been calling me the wrong name for the past 8 years, and you never bothered to call me my actual name," said Andrea, who was standing on the landing of the stairs next to the front door. "You are the only one who calls me Anthea, and for the first 2 years I kept trying to correct you, but it never stuck. You're literally the only one in the entire department who does it and we aren't sure if you are doing it because you are just obtuse or you are being so consumed in whatever head game you are currently playing to notice."
Kayla looked at Sherlock, "okay crowded, how does being crowded make you feel and what makes those feelings more tolerable."
Sherlock stared at Kayla, "not at all, she has been a well behaved dog this entire time."
John smiled and kissed Sherlock's shoulder, "thanks for putting up with my moods and being such a good parent for Rosie."
“Do you think he used the poppers with him?” Inquired Irene laughing even harder.
John nodded, “um I know this is awkward but out of the usual types to come through the RV what kind is he?”
Sherlock was bored, bored, bored out of his mind and yet things were so overwhelming, the sounds of London seeping through his window and try as he, he paced back and forth in his flat occasionally dramatically flopping down onto the couch. He decided that he needed to get out of the flat and get in the thick of the all the stimuli that is London.
"What is it boss?" Came a breathless Crystal. "You don't page unless it is an absolute emergency. Woah three spots available, I can see how that can be a conundrum. I mean we got to pick three people who can stand each other who can also stand the other 12 people here. I..."
John stood still clenching his fists, he wanted to say something but he knew Harry was not in a state to be talked to at this moment. But deep down he knew she was right, he didn’t have the army, he couldn’t even perform what he was trained to do because of the damn hand tremor. He couldn’t find a fucking job to stay in fucking London, he knew that moving back to the village with his aunt would mean he would save money, but he would be bored to death. He would be better off dead and given that spectacularly great fuck he just had, it might just be better on a high note, he didn’t need to infect Sherlock with all the misery that seems to follow him. Sherlock was an attractive man, he wouldn’t have any trouble finding a new person. He decided that he was just going to to go back to his bedsit and use the pistol, he had been thinking about perpetually ever since he came back and now was a good as ever a time to do it. He sighed and walked away with resignation his shoulder dropped and looking downward, he headed towards the exit.
“Sherlock, it doesn’t have to be perfect,” said John as he flopped onto the only available chair, which was the couch. “Ugh Sherlock you need to be more careful with your smoking patches, they aren’t a thing you want stuck on you when you never smoked.”
Siger winced, “no John please feel free to call me Siger, I’d want you to see me as a friend, not a teacher.”
John smirked at how easily he made Sherlock make all sorts of sounds, almost like he was as playable as a piano. John looked at Sherlock’s hands and thought maybe Sherlock played it himself. He chuckled when Sherlock bucked when he covered his mouth and nose. “Okay Sherlock, be a good boy and breath when I tell you to.”
John took a deep breath and rolled into Sherlock's hug, he looked into Sherlock’s eyes, “thanks Sherlock.”
Sherlock nodded, "I also prefer text message."
Sherlock smiled he didn't really expect himself to ever experience this level of intimacy and to have these sorts of bonds but here he was and he felt that he really couldn't go back to before all this happened.
Sherlock looked down at Toby, "you did a good job today, let's head up to your new home."
Ella laughed.
Ella laughed, "oh, hmm let him come, I can spring a session on him, maybe he can work on the control issues he has because between him monopolizing your time and him sticking his nose in everyone's business I think he needs to get in a fight, it would be good for him.
Sherlock laughed, "I mean obviously the body didn't have any bite marks, I can't believe the cops didn't notice. I guess they just saw this big pup and had to assume it was him."
John shook his head, “No Sherlock, it’s fine I just need to get a better grip on myself.” He shuddered, realizing the double entendre in that phrase. “I mean not a better grip on myself…I just need to control myself better, I mean I know you don’t want that now, but I don’t want to scare you off either, because again, I am here for long haul.”
John came up to Sherlock and looked down at Sherlock’s phone. “Oh that is a lot of photos... who knew you were recognizable without the coat.”
The older man took one more firm thrust against Sherlock’s ass while gripping at the outline of Sherlock’s cock through his trousers, “show me the way.” He whispered to Sherlock as he loosened his grip on Sherlock.
Sherlock tensed up, and took a deep breath, "oh hello Sebastian, how is your affair going?"
“I am trying..”stammered out Sherlock.
“But yeah Francis and Scott were getting ready to go to boarding school which was the same for the oldest Holmes kid, Mycroft. They didn’t get along, but you can tell Mycroft was the kind of oldest sibling who was left with all the responsibilities of being a third parent. But that doesn’t excuse him from being the fucking asshole he was. But yeah I think he is probably still going to be an asshole, but probably a broken one, all the conversations I got, makes me think his parents are pissed at him, and he probably was so full of familial duty, he seems like there isn't much else in his life. Well he was a bit rough and made fun of Francis when he had to read something out loud for a game and proceeded to tell Scott to shut up every time he got chatty, basically you know being a damn fucking asshole,” a timer goes off, Aithne looks at her phone and makes her way for the door.  “I’ll be back, it’s a good story but it isn’t worth pissing at the dinner table, i’ll be back from the loo in like 5.”
Sherlock realized what was happening and he started moaning rather loudly. He always loved John’s piss but they never tried this before. He fucked John’s fist again while he worked his hole to tighten around the tip of John’s cock. He felt like his hole was ready for another round. “Daddy, it’s so warm! I want you to do this all the time.”
Francis looked at Joey, “well for me, Johnny W And Jamie S would be the definite guys for me since Johnny is why I am still alive and Jamie did provide a lot of support for me in spots of trouble. Ma...ma... Many of the men I served with didn’t make it back and the ones who came back really don’t approve of our relationship, be it because we’re a gay couple or he’s uhh... err... oh fuck.”
“Oh g-d he is so dramatic, I fucking love it,” said Rica, one of the med intern volunteers. She was doubled over in laughter. “Well if you excuse me, I now need to join the other half of that duo in the morning after clinic.”
"Why would you need a raise?" Asked Mycroft staring at Andrea.
Sherlock nodded, he stretched out his arms for John.
"Okay Sherlock what was it that you wanted to share?" Inquired Ella.
“It isn’t,” said Mycroft, “this person is coming in to see if you are a fit for a re-entry program. You finish this program you are considered ready for a life amongst the world. So really don’t play around too much with the evaluator.”
Sherlock took a closer look at John’s phone. “Well you have that hand tremor. My phone doesn’t have the scratches.” He handed John his phone.
Sherlock was still blank. His finger twitches.
“That’s new, makes sense cocaine seems to drop off the street since you came back. But like a lot of the plugs have seemed to going away lately. I mean Irene and Kate will be on their way to San Francisco in a few days. Irene somehow at the last minute got a summer intensive at SF Opera and she is probably going to stay there for grad school because she suddenly has the choice of CREGS at San Francisco State or the Kinsey Institute in Bloomington, Indiana, and won’t have to pay for a thing. So it looks like we won’t be seeing that couple for quite some time, but yeah they should be around here tonight. Irene might be holding but who knows,” said Janine with a shrug as she poured heavy handed splashed of liquor into a cocktail glass. There was barely any space for cola by the time she was done with the liquor, she tossed a bunch of cherries. “Oh and speak of the devil.”
“Oh come on William, why you being so cold?” Said the man leaning into Sherlock’s personal space. “Oh right you are using that sissy as fuck name, Cher was it.”
He really didn't like the idea. He looked at her approach to care and scoffed, "trauma informed care with emphasis on harm reduction."  He thought that just meant she was going to be an especially easy target for Eurus to turn. And the thought of having her in a facility full of people who could be just as easy to turn, really didn't feel right. He really didn't like going to deal with a program in a city where he didn't exactly have great access to surveillance. Also he just didn't like the idea of harm reduction, he didn't like it mainly because sure Sherlock took all the precautions to minimize the personal damage the drugs would do to him, but he felt that Sherlock was a little too confident in what her thought he could manage. He never liked showing the list to medical providers when Sherlock needed further care than just a couple shots of Narcan. He really didn't like that Sherlock was the kind of user who was self aware enough to administer Narcan on himself. So he at times didn't even call for help when he needed it. Also there wasn't any Narcan for stimulants, so there wasn't even an easy to administer aid when he was ODing on his drug of choice.
Buckle up for some domestic fluff.
John tensed up as he felt his orgasm hit him like a truck. “That was brilliant!”
Aithne rolled her eyes at her dad, “I promise I won’t set any fires or maim anyone after seeing Eurus. And I do indeed hope to keep my hair this time, but with undercut it will take a whole lot of effort to loose my hair these days.”
“Well yes, that would be ideal, I can’t have you getting me kicked out of there,” said John staring at Sherlock.
"Yeah, I think I just like making you feel some guilt, but hey you apologized. And I do believe you do run an ethical project and honestly I am not a person who can use that threat, because lord knows my way of running our company raises more eyebrows than your program.  But for real though it's true if you weren't so off your kilter, mother probably would've had the chance to spread all her irrational shit on to all of us, you definitely took on the brunt of her control issues." Smirked Blaze, "I mean dad signed my paper for hormones and surgery without her even noticing and could you imagine how much she would've tried to stop it, if she wasn't focused on you, because of the flasher incident. Oh and when Francis joined the Army, she didn't even have a chance to stop him, because she was busy arguing with the school because they were trying to expel you for breaking the jaw of Up-Skirt Seb. And when she found out at his freaking college graduation, Scott wasn't an English Lit major with a minor in the physical sciences, but rather a pharmacology degree with a minor in lit, she was about to lash out so badly at him, but the call came in that you pushed that kidnapper into the path of a train. Too bad you calmed your ass down before Athina could do what she wanted completely unfettered."
“You mister posh pants use a wireless charger! Rosie’s phone doesn’t have wireless charging capabilities and I just don’t like them,” snapped John.
Wolf turned back to Blaze, “what do you think is going to happen if you keep skipping your Invega?”
“They got nothing to be ashamed of, they’re interesting,” replied William, as they both ducked down at the last second as Asa, tried to make one last dive at them.
Sherlock looked at John with a bit of surprise, “that’s a new reaction, never had that happen before.”
We don't have a central place to keep track of it all.
Sherlock screamed as he finally orgasmed. He realized that the warmth dripping down his legs wasn’t just cum, but he guessed the amount of water and tea he consumed finally caught up with him. It made sense, it was always hard for him to cum on a full bladder. He felt a small bit of shame at the fact that he lost control like that, and even had a bit more shame as his cock gave a twitch at the situation as a whole. Sherlock felt John release his mouth from his shoulder and was amused at feather light kiss John delivered on the mark.
Mycroft sighed, "okay I will from here on out remember that Andrea is Andrea not Anthea." He paused for a slight beat and started laughing, "that is the code to the safe isn't it. You used some basic child plays crypto code, and made a password to a safe full of sentimental knickknacks."
A flash of purple comes running out of the Speedy's, it's Kayla, "hey Sherlock, Solomon just realized as soon as you left, that we actually need to train you to get to you to pass the test. I mean yeah we get that PTSD dogs are really helpful but the current governing bodies don't cover them. There are pilot programs for it, and we are working on it. Ugh I mean where I am from it was acceptable, to just let you go and we come and train you. But, blah, blah, blah we don't want you getting in trouble. So yeah we need to remember not to assume that you are going to be all good, especially since you don't have an ID booklet. Yeah right, before I forget," She pulls out a patch that says "in training" and she pats it onto the Toby's vest. "Well at least it was good to see that you managed a cab just fine. Did the cabby give you any trouble? Was Toby able to maneuver the taxi even with all of you in there?
Rosie started crying.
Yup... this is a happy world of Sherlock where Moriarty barely has a chance to exist and that's okay.
“Yes, William is old enough to understand and practice safety. So of course it is a great idea,” replied Sherlock, as he taught William how to clean the metal before starting a weld. Sherlock looked on with great affection as William managed to make a very clean close of the vehicle and prove that it was back in playable condition.
“Oh Sherlock, no lab clothes in bed,” reminded John.
John relieved the pressure as soon as Sherlock stopped wiggling and he went back to running gentle circles into Sherlock’s ass. “Okay Boy, we are half way through your punishment, if you get through the second half of the punishment without any wiggling, I’ll let you cum immediately after. But if you wiggle, I am going to leave you on the edge of cumming until I am done with all of your holes.”
Joey looked around, “so you know the scene that Moira caused at your wedding,” he gave a look at Josephine and Scott.
"And you seemed to have a seizure while trying to get out, you couldn't help it, I am okay, you are okay. There is no permanent damage. Like I said it's all okay, we are fine, and I'll get a non-slip mat for the tub as soon as possible. Better we find out we need one with us than with Rosie right," said John as he stretched out his arms inviting Sherlock into a cuddle.
All the volunteers broke out into giggles.
“Well. see. you. soon.” said Mycroft in clipped down tone that caught the total lack of enthusiasm for the situation.
John stood in the middle of the kitchen, he felt a thrill vibrate through him, he shook himself out. This past 12 hours he felt more than he had the past 6 months since returning to London. He looked through his bag and decided against using Another impact toys. But he decided to change, he noticed that Sherlock was very enthusiastic when he called himself “Captain” so maybe he would love to see John in his uniform. He was going to save the formal uniform for a special occasion but he still had a casual set somewhere in his bag. He changed and made sure to have his dog tags showing, he even changed into a pair of boots. He checked himself in the mirror of the sitting room. He smiled, he could do this.
"Yeah that is the only regrettable part of that situation, it okay though, Wolfie gave me my punishment for that, my ass wouldn't let me forget about that for weeks after that," said Blaze frowning slightly, but perked right back up, "but sorry they got a fragile sense of masculinity."
"Ella, you'll probably want to stop with the comments, he isn't fun to deal with when he is angry," said Andrea keeping an uneasy eye on the two of them.
“The Red one” they all announced.
“Well you were actually quite good with your hands,” Said Sherlock as he reached out to John and held onto his hand.
Someone eventually spoke up, he could tell from the markings on her hands and the drawings and plans she had laid in front of her, this woman was a materials scientist. “Mr. Holmes, are you trying to determine if constant alcohol use can be determined by scratches caused by the phone owner’s ability to plug in their phone with minimal scratching of the surface?”
Sherlock shifted his weight to his knees and held his hands behind his head. He looked up at John and opened his mouth, he even stuck out his tongue a little bit.
John looked at Sherlock, “Okay what’s your solution?” He watched as Sherlock dramatically got up and left the flat.
They walked Mycroft to the door. Mycroft silently offered his hand out to Ella, "it was interesting meeting you at long last."
Aithne was on the floor staring at her brother rather confused as to why she was on the floor. “What the fuck man?”
Mycroft took a few steps back, "I'd apologize but I really wouldn't be sorry.” He tried to keep his composer even though that really isn’t the best way to open a meeting like this. An awkward silence filled the air, in moments like this it was like a silent battle, because being first talk would loose.
"You worked at multiple universities, you would think you can just ask someone," snipped back Mycroft.
Yeah also turns out that the UK doesn't allow service dogs for PTSD, but it is currently under evaluation. Welp... I guess, I think I added some adjustments that allows for the Toby to still stay with 221B.
Sherlock was sitting on top some crates with his legs spread, he was stroking the inside of his thighs just waiting for John to make a move, he carefully avoided his cock.
John nodded, okay Mike new the person from the lab, so that can’t be too bad. “Okay, i’ll meet him. Is he part of the testing team? I thought I met everyone already.”
John chuckled and grabbed a plush velvet chair and turned it towards the kitchen, he flopped down onto it. He opened his trousers and pulled out his cock, “hey Boy, the sooner you’re finished the faster you can treat yourself to my cock.” He smiled as Sherlock picked up his speed. He slowly started to stroke his cock, occasionally toying with his foreskin. He was at half mast when Sherlock was about to finish off picking up all the trash.
Solomon looked disgusted at the idea that someone would poison animals over something so petty.
Sherlock's mind decided to pause, he gritted his teeth, and nervously drummed his fingers. Toby barked and pawed at Sherlock's hand. Sherlock snapped back into the moment.
Aithne looked at Crystal, “that would be nice but remember I have lecture on Wednesday and Fridays and we have interns to supervise on Mondays and Thursdays.."
"Ten Seconds, and Mycroft, Toby doesn't bark unless she senses a seizure and if this is what I think it is, Toby will make it a whole lot easier for Sherlock to go out unsupervised" said John, he pulled out his phone and took note of the time, length, and what was happening at the time of the seizure. John turned to Sherlock's parents, "did anyone ever approach you about Sherlock potentially having seizures when he was younger? I just want to know if this is a new thing or an untreated thing that came back with recent changes."
The door opened and Mrs. Hudson looked at John and Sherlock. “What’s this about dearie?”
“Well we both have reputations to hold, but can we just go without the sack,” Said Billy as he stepped into the trunk.
He chuckled against Sherlock’s mouth and took a more active role in the kissing, he swept his tongue against Sherlock’s who took a sharp breath, when it first happened, but Sherlock enjoyed it, so Sherlock tried it as well timing it with grinding further into John’s crotch. John who was now sporting an incredibly hard cock, was enjoying Sherlock’s efforts. He wished for more, but at the same time he enjoyed everything given to him so far. Sherlock grabbed John’s hands and laid them on his hips, John grabbed on this hips and held Sherlock firmly in his lap, John started thrusting his trouser covered erection against Sherlock’s fully clothed ass. He didn’t do something like this in years, and it made him feel young, but Sherlock wasn’t exactly stopping him. He felt the pressure building up, and soon he was quickly approaching orgasm. He was moaning against Sherlock’s mouth, Sherlock was still sloppily kissing John, but now meeting John’s thrusts which made John moan even more. Suddenly Sherlock tightly gripped John’s hair pulling his head back, and revealing John neck. Sherlock pulled away from the kiss and buried his face into John’s neck, changing between gentle kisses and playful nips, with occasional long strokes with his tongue. John felt even more pressure building up and he was now on the very edge of an orgasm. Sherlock suddenly pulled back, John was absolutely breathless and missing the contact, when just as suddenly as sherlock pulled off, Sherlock delivered a sharp bite into the part of the neck where it meets the shoulder, John moaned and thrashed as he felt his orgasm hit him. John opened his eyes and caught his breath, and saw Sherlock looking down at him with a look on his face as if he was absolutely satisfied with himself.
he wants that he wants John to reach him that way. He moaned loudly as John continued to fuck him enthusiastically. He placed a hand on John’s shoulder and John paused and their eyes met. “I want you in me John,” Said Sherlock as he wrapped his legs around John’s waist and he pulled John in for a kiss.
The leather daddy relaxed, “fuck you,” he flipped Sherlock off as he walked away.
“Papa, dad is doing it again!” yelled William.
Jeanine came up to Sherlock, with two paper cups full of water. “I take it you had a good time,” she said amused at how Sherlock managed each cup with a large gulps not even lowering the cup between gulps. She refilled both cups when he dropped them to the bar top. She raised an eyebrow at Sherlock as they repeated this process of gulping and refilling the water six times. Jeanine did the math and figured that Sherlock was well on his way of drinking two cups of water for every unit of alcohol he drank earlier. “Okay Sherlock you are either trying to delay answering me or you are trying to prevent a hangover.”
Solomon went to his office to get the paperwork, he passed a young woman exiting the office as he went on, "oh hey Kayla, Sherlock is going to be taking home Toby, can you prepare Toby's stuff so that she can go home with them today. Also you are the closest volunteer to his flat, you think you are ready to do your first solo on site training?"
"No, thank you," replied Mycroft.
Sherlock leaned into the older man’s grip, which was firm but it also felt like, “uh... my name.... uh.” He was lost in the sensation, he had been touched by so many people, but there was always something about being touched like this that was rare for Sherlock. He enjoyed it.
Just a silly little update to celebrate the fact that NHS has finally joined the rest of the world and covering PrEP. So yup.... enjoy.
Sherlock smiled, "sometimes but I do have a trust fund that helps patch things up quite nicely, ultimately I have found the barter system has worked for me and ultimately it opens up a route for people who can't afford an investigator a chance. But really the barter system has been good to me." He gestured at Mrs Hudson.
Sherlock lifted his head to make room for John’s hands. He watched as John took off his shirt and saw for the first time John completely naked. He noticed the scar on John’s shoulder. “I was trying to deduce what sent you back.” He leaned closer to take In more detail, “there was an infection wasn’t there, so what was originally a clean shot had turned into something unmanageable, and it affects your ability to work as a surgeon.”
"Well okay next time, brother, I'll just let you stew in your discomfort," replied Sherlock.
back straight and his knees af at 90 degree angle. The grit of the ground dug into his knees, it in a way kept him grounded, the pain stopped him from his mind wandering. He kept his mouth open, because he really truly was going to take whatever John gave him, also it had been proven that in general water sports and consumption on urine was fairly safe. He did always like sex to be on the filthier, rougher side, but he saw the current regiment of HIV medications and he had no intention of going down that path. So while he couldn’t enjoy the feeling of someone’s release dripping out of him, which was pretty much one of the odd things he missed about sex while high; that lack of inner voice that would tell him not to risk seroconversion.
“Well you can always make exceptions,” Replied Sherlock he said with a wink.
Sherlock laid on top of John, unable to move easily because of John’s tight grip and also because he was thoroughly impaled on John’s rather large cock. He smirked as he squeezed down on John’s cock, and moaned because it only added more pressure against all the right places. He moaned as he firmly planted his feet against the bed and tried to move up and down John’s cock the best he could, but he couldn’t move too far in John’s form grip.
"My dad broke our stuff in arguments, it was never his stuff. I hated it when he would punch the wall as well. Arguments happened really easily when I was growing up. And no matter how small the argument, the results was always the same," said John, he was rather stiff when he talked about his dad.
Ella shrugged, "I think I can trust the two of you to be responsible with a gun."
"Yes that does seem to be the theme of the evening," said Sherlock.
“I’m not going to lie, I really don’t know much of his backstory other than the fact that he solves crimes, does weird kinds of experiments that at times gets questionable, and has a poor grasp on social mores. Some of the volunteers call him ‘BFD’ but what that stands for depends on who you are asking. Personally I find him to be okay, he is just rude, I don’t think he was socialized well growing up or even now, I’m sure the right person can be great friends with him. Also to be honest his family is a big sponsor for the program, and you know what people assume about sponsors of medical programs,” said Mike with a slight sigh.
“Good boy, come here, and do crawl,” Said John motioning him over, he smiled as Sherlock crawled up to him and was a bit surprised to see Sherlock rest his head on his knee. He ran a finger through Sherlock’s hair and smirked because even more pre-cum came drizzling out. “One of these days I am going to have to see if it is possible to get you to cum just by stroking your hair.”
Kayla laughed, "aww I can already tell y'all a hella fun bunch, this is going to be a great couple of weeks." She turned to Mrs. Hudson, "I like you, you remind me of my mom, she always be  trying to get my big brother and his husband to admit they were a couple, but like they were like best friends since childhood, and you know toxic masculinity is a thing, so like they were 30 by they time they got cuffed. And they kept saying they weren't like that, but mom kept finding them doing couple stuff like all the time. She one time got out her camera phone and took pictures of them napping because they feel asleep cuddling. Like half their wedding slide show was pics taken by our mom. She also has a soft spot for lotto scratchers, like the car is always filled with that scratcher dust." She smiled to herself, "ugh sorry for the overshare."
Sherlock opened the door, and Toby got up and gently padded out. And the rest of them followed. Sherlock noticed his phone which was full of texts messages from Kayla.
“Okay, i’ll stop,” said Danny. “But please don’t do that,
Mycroft made an exaggerated effort to straighten himself up, his umbrella was next to the knocked over end table. He hoped that everyone would assume it was an accident but he felt that he needed to show his parents that things weren't alright, and if triggering his brother and John was what it took, he might as well take it.
“Oh she is in her mind office,” exclaimed Athina as she took a closer looked at her sister, “she does this when she has gone into auto pilot when she has to keep repeating herself. She probably working on billing codes.”
The two of them paused when they heard a thud against their floor, “SHERLOCK! JOHN!
"Oh we're fine as fine as one can be given the situation," said Violet.
Sherlock has quite the talented mouth even when he is asleep.
"You're why Moriarty had the info needed to ruin your brother and was implicit on continuing the isolation of your sister in a secret high security jail, one that I am pretty sure shouldn’t exist! Especially when it comes to a ten year old!” Snapped Violet, she looked like she was about to jump out of her seat.
Terribly sorry, but let me just remind everyone that the consent model John and Sherlock follow is Risk Aware Consensual Kink and the navigate things in the “yes until no” kind of way. Trust me it isn’t for everyone and it is fairly unrealistic for many people to double back flip into this from being a virgin, but yeah this is my imagination... my filthy, terrible, some what questionable imagination
“Good boy,” John’s hand in Sherlock hair suddenly went from the gentle carding to the twisting tug. John shoved a knee between Sherlock’s legs to knock him off balance slightly. “On your knees with your hands behind your head, dropping your hands is the same as a red. Do you hear me?”
Ella looked at Sherlock with a bit of amusement, "okay how about this John you see that silk screen over there? Yeah I just use it to cover up the xerox machine. If you feel comfortable just stand behind it. Will that work for you, Sherlock?"
"Thank you very much," said John relieved.
“Excuse me,” said John shocked at Sherlock’s offer.
John laughed, "oh it had's it's ups and downs but yes I have to admit it was a pretty good day." He pressed a kiss into the back of Sherlock's neck.
John laughed, "thanks, I mean I can handle one dog, Rosie, and Sherlock. The idea of two dogs suddenly struck me as daunting. Anyway what goes into getting a service dog?"
Sherlock looked at John puzzled, “what do you mean cut?”
Veteran Marine, First Sergeant Joey Mendoza was an odd man who was overly enthusiastic about working as a social security administration agent, he took a lot of pride in making sure that the Social Security Branch he was in charge of was working at maximum proficiency he knew the POMS with deadly accuracy and it was to the point that people specifically traveled to his branch for it. But initially he was prepared to be a lifer for the Marines, but he lost a leg when he hit by a large piece of shrapnel from an IED, luckily it was a below the knee cut. He had his black, wavy hair cut high and tight, he had dark brown eyes and was tan. He had scattering of visible scars that came from the attack that retired him, but also had some from his youth. He was short in comparison to his fellow marines, but he more than made up for it in strength, he was certainly bulky in muscle but he was still soft in some parts.
I mean for real like the claim denial process, is wild the person making the decisions isn't even required to look at the person's medical records before making a decision.
"Ooh Sherlock, doesn't that sound nice, we still have a couple bolts of that fabric your favorite scarf is made from, maybe we can use one of the bolts for that blanket," said Violet as she also wrote her terms onto her scraps of paper.
John smiled, “okay how about this I am going to lie still, and you can explore whatever you want within reason, I’m not in the mood for any vivisection,” he paused as Sherlock laughed. “I know you wouldn’t do that, but at the same time I just feels like it needs to be stated.”
“Okay can we get to the task at hand,” said Mike, a touch exasperated at Bryson's habit of hitting on all the cops who came their way, and he really wouldn’t like Lestrade getting scared away because since Lestrade started allowing Sherlock to work cases his risk assessments was showing positive behavior changes. And that was exciting.
“Ooh do you think it was that guy from last night,” Said Irene with a slight squeal of delight. “And hopefully that kills off her little crush on Sherlock.”
John quickly placed his hands on the table, and Sherlock picked up some utensils and grabbed the plates of food. He started cutting the sausages and other other items into bite size pieces.
“Good,” John throttled him one last time before throwing him to the ground. John got up and started rummaging through Sherlock’s discarded clothing.  “Okay someone carrying condoms usually carries like lube, because I really do want to fuck you as hard as you want to be fucked boy.”
“At this point I decided that this was the US, so it would take a hell of a time to find my sealed records, so I gave it one more time, and she managed to grab me by my hair and hurled me into a fucking Our Lady of Guadalupe statue,” said Aithne. “Which gave way to her bursting through the doors of the church.”
Some time around when he was seven after yet another fight where he knocked out yet another boy telling him what he could and couldn’t do, his fathers took him to a psychiatrist. The lady told them about how a lot of Williams behavior issues didn’t come from a lack of mother in his life or some trauma he couldn’t remember; she said that it was a pretty obvious case of gender dysphoria. She suggested to Papa and Dad that he start living his life in a way that fit him. He got a hair cut, dad helped him paint his room a color he wanted, papa took him shopping for new clothes and even got him a custom suit. Untie Harry introduced him to some ladies they knew from a long time ago who were sort of like him, and those ladies introduced him to some other kids who were just like him. He liked hanging out with those kids, Papa and Dad did not have fun with cleaning the slime out of his pants and trousers when he tried packing with a home made packer and it exploded (Papa at the last minute remembered that salt could break apart polymers and thus the clothing was saved). Papa ended up teaching all of the kids in the Trans Youth Program how to work with silicone, and there was no more slime explosions after that. When the silicone packers got a little too stiff and unwieldy, Mama Hudson knitted him a packer that provided just the right amount of bulge with no stiffness problem
Sherlock swallowed and awkwardly got out of his underwear, it was almost like he forgot how to move gracefully and now he remembered the issue with leather underwear, like sure the fact that it was a jockstrap meant that things had a chance to air out but it was always a bit of a shock of cold hitting the gathered sweat when it was finally removed. He took a deep breath and crawled over to John stopping just a few inches away.
John smiled but also started looking around, "so where is Toby supposed to stay anyways?"
"Yes, John, I like it! Can you touch me please? Maybe just start with my hair and shoulders," said Sherlock gasping as he continued thrusting against the sheets.
Mycroft sighed, "yes I agree to that deadline."
| Incest
He laughed at the fact that Sherlock’s reaction to that was a ridiculous smile. He adjusted Sherlock’s position on his lap so that Sherlock’s cock was receiving more friction. He smirked at Sherlock’s obvious effort to prevent himself from squirming.
John grabs the ruined cake and puts in the cart while grabbing another cake so that they could at least have a good cake.
William Watson loves his dads but sometimes they get a little embarrassing.
Sherlock shrugged, “we both are.”
“Why you stay in Sherlock’s room?
Ella turned around, "thanks for willing to put up with that, we do appreciate it."
Hey kudos and comments give me life.
Sherlock cracked a small smile at John’s words before descending deeper into his mind palace to re-examine his observations and how changes in built materials have rendered some of the observations obsolete.
Sherlock maneuvered John into his bed, he took the time to strip off the rest of his clothes, he was amused that John didn’t ask the same level as nudity of him during the encounter, but that was probably because Sherlock didn’t give him permission to, next time he would have to remember to allow John to strip him as well. He got into bed and held John in his arms. He observed John as John drifted off into sleep, he saved all of John’s details from the length of time it took for John to shift into a comfortable position, to how he smelled of tea, sweat, and hospital antiseptic, to how their naked bodies slid together. He pressed a kiss into the back of John’s neck and whispered against John’s skin, “mine.”
Sherlock blurted out, "you can hold onto the dog and Rosie and I'll walk ahead of you because you usually are following me anyways, but I'll slow my pace to make sure you can keep up. Or in other settings both of us hold Rosie and we take turns with the dog. Or we get one of those really well trained dogs that keep to their owner's side and the dog becomes a non factor in hand issue... wait a service dog needs to have its leash held at all times."
John turned around and saw Sherlock, his teeth was grinding, and fingers were twitching, a cake dropped next to him. "Shit," John pressed the start button on his watch."
"Jesus Christ, how bad was the visit?" Asked Paul, his voice full of concern.
John’s face softened at Sherlock’s explanation and he smiled, “a round two doesn’t sound too bad now that you talk about it.”
Mycroft laughed, "ooh an apology and being told I was right, well this makes up for you always forgetting my birthday."
Sherlock nodded and let his son drag him to the lab in basement, it was put in while they had to rebuild all of 221 Baker Street. Sherlock enjoyed having his own personal lab, and John enjoyed not risking getting poisoned while doing his activities of daily living.
"Mycroft I know we can't change the past but we can change how we are now. And I hope you can try and let us attempt a change," pleaded Violet. She reached out to try and gently pat Mycroft on his shoulder but he maneuver out of the way quite vehemently, and Violet quickly withdrew her hand.
Sherlock was flopped over on his stomach taking in the feelings caused by his cock being pinned between him and the bed and he gave a tentative thrust, which he enjoyed it wasn't a sensation that overwhelmed one part or another but was rather even in pressure. It was closer to his earlier activities with John.
Mycroft was amused to see someone who actually wanted to be friends with Eurus.
Wolf barked out a short laugh.
Sherlock and John nodded in acknowledgment of Rudy’s statement.
"Wow that Weill Institute donation really made you have a ton of bank," Blaze said with a chuckle.
Sherlock smirked, "indeed very not good behavior, but sometimes you just have to be a bit petty."
John breath a relieved sigh.
Sherlock jumped up to his feet, "that's not fair Mycroft..." Sherlock just stared off into space, his finger gently twitched, his eyes fluttered. Toby who was napping by the fire runs up the Sherlock and starts barking and pawing at Sherlock.
John opened the door.
Scott shuddered, “at least you had the sense to not date him.”
"'My, how long has it been since we were last in danger?" Asked Violet.
John leaned over Sherlock, “Hey love, back in 2010 that observation was amazing. Things change and that’s okay. Let’s just make sure Rosie never finds out that you were concerned that she was a 7 year old with a drinking problem.” He kissed Sherlock on the forehead and went back to cleaning the kitchen.
“John the sheets are water proof,” Said Sherlock.
Sherlock looked at John, “oh, but that’s only one data point, let’s get three.” He darted out of the flat and started knocking on the door of 221a. “Mrs. Hudson, we must ask you a question!” Yelled Sherlock.
Sherlock, John, Rosie, and Mrs, Hudson all waved good bye and exited the animal center.
“Yeah we’re here to see what kind of man can get you to act just a bit more civil. Molly from the
John didn't come out.
Rimming/Analingus | Costume
Crystal took a breath, "why do you need a sabbatical did some project come up?"
“Babe we don’t got brandy. Also Sherlock, I know you drink to go totally off your tits and dance, so I am just going to call it a draw and make you two Long Island Iced Teas, because I remember your whole blue drinks are easier to drug conversation. We might as well save you the trip to the bar,” said the bartender with a smile.
you when you have known each other for less than a day,” Said Sherlock as he leaned into John’s touch. “How about you?”
Kayla looked at Toby, wondering why she barked.
Sherlock pups out and John finds him and things move from there.
“Okay Boy, for every thing I find dirty, will count as one slap, is that clear?” Said John as he ran his hands through Sherlock’s hair.
John pointed at an aisle, "Sherlock, the tea is down that aisle."
"Okay given that we did kind of cock it up with sending you home with Toby right away, let's pretend that didn't happen and do this properly. So ultimately until you and Toby pass the Public Access Test, you can't bring Toby around vested without me or Solomon or any of the other trainers with PAWS. Again I am only 20 minutes away by bus, so if I am free and you really need me to be around with you, I can do that. Just a heads up, try not to call me in for any cases. I am not particularly screamish but I also don't have much luck with cops. I really don't like being around cops," said Kayla.
Rosie nodded.
Blaze smiled, "of course you did, you were always an act first, think later kind of girl. I'm not going to stop you, but I am so not digging you out of any hole you build with this one. I am guessing you can't keep her at Russo though, would she be staying with you?"
“Afghanistan, how did you know?” Replied John, he was growing more and more interested in the man the more he talked.
John looked at Sherlock, “Sherlock, I am in the long haul for this if you are.” He handed Sherlock Rosie’s pajamas. “And I know you have a hard time believing this is even happening, but know that I do love you, and I will keep working to make sure you can be sure that this is actually happening and will keep happening.” He helped Sherlock get Rosie into her pajamas.
Andrea laughed, "maybe I should just give him our address, and knowing how impulsive he has been lately, he'll just show up. And do this like an intervention."
Josephine started laughing, “yeah what was the diversion plan for that one because it failed spectacularly.” She turned to Hiram.
“Yes, I did, I am coming over, I currently don’t have set travel time, but I can make the time to do it, if you give me coordinates to know where to come. I’ll tell you when things are set up,” replied Aithne.
Her brother Francis, was in the Army and for some odd reason she really couldn’t remember much of his service history. He didn’t really talk much about it other than the fact that he was sent home after his unit got ambushed, then again talking was just difficult for him them these days. Francis currently worked as a security guard and did some odd jobs for Geneticorp Science and Labs, which was the company ran by his twin Scott and her twin Blaze. It wasn’t exactly fulfilling work in his opinion, but at least this way he was able to be around people he actually liked and be with his boyfriend, the idea of staying in England using his pension and inheritance did not seem appealing especially given the chance that he most likely would be the new focus of their mother’s intense hovering. He was tall, fair skinned, freckled with light brown hair and emerald eyes. His hair was cut into a crew cut and his posture was bolt straight, much like one would expect from the army, but it had a certain unevenness, that unevenness popped up in all sorts of places on him, ranging from his lopsided smile to the shaky grip in his right hand.
“Sherlock you surprised me by bringing out your old bar back uniform from when you went undercover to ensure that my ex went down for his crimes. Which was funny because I just saw Mickey, you know him that one terrible man who wouldn’t stop hitting on you and the other boys. He was always flashing his money around too, but I am sure he was full of shit,” Said Mrs. Hudson. She turned to John and Sherlock at their chairs, “oh... oh dear were you two still going at it. I’ll just show my way out.” She placed the tray of cake on the table near them and made a quick dash for the exit. “You boys have fun,” she yelled as she descended the stairs. “Just remember your parents are going to be dropping Rosie off at 9pm, so I am sure you can get another round in before they come over, but just have fun, I’ll leave you alone.”
Eurus stood there in mild shock, that was unexpected, nice to see some surprising things, that was indeed rare.  She smiled at the idea of getting out, but where would they be sending her. It had been quite some time since she was allowed near a computer and the last time she had unfettered access was when she was given access to Twitter for her brother. The IT man was spectacularly unpersuasive, he was not pleasant to everyone. Most of the times the solutions he barked out without even looking at the computer was correct. Apparently he was autistic from what he told his co-workers when they made fun of him for not understanding a lot of stuff people apparently just know. She had some what she guessed was empathy for him because she understood that on some level. Also go Mycroft for hiring a bunch of disabled people, she laughed she wondered where he snatched all these folks from, was all the deaf and Hard of Hearing folks like that since birth or are they former soldiers who acquired the hearing deficits, they never interacted with her long enough for her to glean the info.
Sherlock with a smirk said, "what's next?"
Sherlock turned onto his knees slightly spread out with his ass resting on his ankles, his hands resting on his thighs. He looked up at John.
"Okay how about Danny gets a raise because you are really pushing "other duties as assigned" for him as well, and we both get one week long vacation guaranteed a year," replied Andrea.
Mycroft took two breaths, angrily picked up the phone, it rung twice before getting picked up. "Sherlock you cried to mummy?"
But one year, Harry deviated from the usual and went with an raspberry pi computer for William, but continued with the pajamas for John and Sherlock. They knew that despite the fact that John and Sherlock were in a queer relationship that the pair did skip over cruising culture. Harry knew that lack of knowledge would make for a hilarious moment. They took a stab at it and assumed that Sherlock had bottom tendencies while John had some Top energy, they were cackling when they found the pajamas a few years back at a boutique owned by their friend Kate, back in San Francisco, so they decided to start playing the long game of getting them used to receiving pajama for Christmas and Harry insisting in taking a photo of them in the pajamas. So they finally had John and Sherlock, right how they want them.They giggled as they took the photo, they sent it to a group chat of theirs which had all of their queer friends who loved talking about the wild shit their siblings got into. Shortly after Harry was confused to hear a moaning sound.
Violet and Siger laughed as they went down the hall, "deduct it from your trust fund."
Sherlock nodded and pulled his wallet out and tossed a small wad of bills down and hopped out of the bench and made quick exit through the side door.
Blaze flipped them all off and swished away dramatically into the kitchen.
Mike replied, “no on Sherlock, how about we get Val the volunteer coordinator to play matchmaker she always makes solid choices. Hasn’t been a couple she made where they don’t end up happy. Not going to lie there is a good shot that if she sees a match she’ll conconct a way to make it happen. She was the one who managed to rearrange five different carpools to the point that my wife and I were the only ones in the car other than Grant, you know the deaf guy from medical coding. We had nothing to do but talk to each other, it worked out well until we all realized that Grant lived in the total and opposite different side of the city from us. In exchange she set him up with Kyle, the pediatric EENT specialist who is always yelling at parents who try to force cochlear implants, she did that by forcing them to be a charades team during the holiday party. Trust me she is good at matchmaking, there hasn't been a wedding i’ve been to in the past 3 years where Val hasn't had a touch in it.” Mike swiveled around to make sure John wasn't able to hear too much, “also that man will ruin you, you really wouldn't be able to deal with half his issues,” he whispered to Molly. “Actually just take him on in the mobile lab and that should smash any crush you have, you’ll see.”
"Boys stop arguing before you start to escalate and Mycroft, Rosie was only trying to help. She wasn't singling you out for anything," interceded Siger.
John started moaning rather loudly against Sherlock’s mouth and his pace started to quicken. He drifted over from Sherlock’s mouth down to a rather sensitive part of Sherlock’s neck which made Sherlock release some rather amusing sounds. “Sherlock, where do you want me to cum?” He continued to deliver long hard strokes into Sherlock at a rather fast pace, he was licking and sucking on Sherlock’s neck and would occasionally drift over to a nipple which would cause Sherlock to flail, he let a small laugh when he went to stroke Sherlock’s cock only for his hand to be swatted away.
Phineas reached out to William’s hand, “William, it wasn’t that bad, it is just really cool to see parents who still goof around and still like each other.”
“Sebastian, I am obviously alone in here. So mind your own fucking business,” Said John hoping that Sebastian didn’t lean on the curtain, which Sherlock some how managed to wrap himself in successfully.
“Do I get to actually sit in the car or is it back into the trunk?”replied Wiggins.
William scowled at his dad, he knew in that moment that Dylan just wasn’t going to work.
“Boy is my attention not enough for you?” Said John as he started to add more fingers alongside his tongue. He tugged and was pleased to see that his boy was able to open up his pretty rosebud just for Daddy.
“You saw the usual example of what happens just a few minutes ago,” said Sherlock, “do try to keep up. How do you feel about the violin? I play it to help me think, I figure flatmates should know the worst part of each other first.”
Ella looked at the two of them, "okay we get the dog idea is probably a go, and hopefully it works out? Is there any other issues you are dealing with?"
Violet and Siger leaned a bit back at the look, they were concerned for Mycroft because he seemed to have some barely contained emotions lurking under his composure. They weren't entirely sure if they wanted to dig deeper.
"Oh are you having a client, Sherlock?" Asked Mrs. Hudson.
Sherlock nodded against the sheets.
Sherlock threw himself forward, holding John tightly, wrapping himself around John’s waist, his face embarrassingly close to John’s private areas, he made an undignified sound as John fell backwards and his shin grazed across Sherlock’s rapidly stiffening cock. Sherlock let off a little moan.
He turned to Sherlock who was staring at John absolutely speechless. John laughed and pressed a soft kiss to his open mouth.
Sherlock stared at his mother, shocked and open mouthed for a second. Toby nudged Sherlock and he snapped back to the moment, "nice to see you have a sense of humor, mummy."
John assumed this is what it Feels like to be a body at a crime scene
Sherlock smiled, “just because a person is trained for a task doesn't mean they are able to perform the task.” He jotted down his signature quickly and snatched the envelope out of molly’s hand, “but Molly do know  I think you can do your job adequately but I am a bored person who does these tedious tests to get my brother off my back because he doesn't think highly of my precautions, so if he is coming for blood I might as well get some scientific gratification out of it.” He scanned the crowd looking for the doctor whose phone he was currently in possession of. He saw him still in conversation with Mike. He started walking up to them. Molly laughed as she processed what was said to her.
“That was John, he is great, I want him to be my flatmate. Sorry Jennifer. I need to stop something terrible,” Said Sherlock as he watched John leave.
John was embarrassed, “sorry Sherlock, I know you were having a good time, but my cock just had to cock it up. I know that this really isn’t you area, and you probably unwelcome it, so I am just going to make my way out. I’m sorry.
John offered Sherlock his hand. Sherlock took it,  John placed his other hand over Sherlock's, and gave him a look. Sherlock sat up on the couch and John sat next to him, still holding onto Sherlock. "Sherlock I want you know, I won't ever leave you. And you mean so much to me, I'd rather not have sex ever again that go on without you. But if you want to have sex, we can work up to that together. And I know you have a hard time believing me when I say I am going to stay, but you are an important part of my life and Rosie's life. I am going to stay."  Sherlock pulled John closer to him on the couch, and John looked at Sherlock before leaning his head on Sherlock's shoulder. Sherlock placed his head on top of his.
Mycroft tried to twist and flip John but John managed to wrap his legs around his head, and kept him pinned down.
Mycroft has a plan which is shaky at best and wager is made.
Solomon opened the letter and read it. "Hmm okay every thing should be order with this letter, and I can call Dr. Thompson for final confirmation latter. Is there a size consideration?" Asked Solomon.
"Exactly," replied Solomon. He whistled four times, and all the dogs lined up. He bends down and removes the work vests off bosco and bopper. "Hey Sherlock, you can walk Toby back. Rosie and Mrs. Hudson , can you walk Bosco? he should be manageable for you both. John, can you take care of Bopper? Okay, looks like we are all set." He presses the clicker, "home." Golem lines up next to Solomon, and he grabs Golem's harness. They all start walking back down the street. Sometimes Solomon would spread up but golem would slow him down enough to stay with the flow of foot traffic. They reached the door of the kennel, and entered.  "Okay let's get the papers started. I mean you got the vest, and the lead. And I'll give you all of Toby's toys and her bed. And you'll get a bag of dog food as well that way you know what to feed her. Otherwise, she is all up to date with shots, she has been spayed and chipped. And there isn't any fee for her dog license since she is a service animal. If you come to our clinic, the vet fees are waved for the first 5 years, but otherwise you can always pick your own clinic, I mean I am sure there is a vet out there who owes you a favor."
“Tell me where you want me to cum Sherlock? On you or in you?” He said with a hard thrust into Sherlock, causing Sherlock to gasp, and grab onto the sheets, his cock dribbling out even more fluid.
Sherlock smiled as he stripped off all his clothes but his underwear and slipped into the bath between John's legs. "It was a long day, but you have to admit it was a good one."
Scott and Francis both started laughing, Blaze joined in the laughter too.
He reached over to the end table and grabbed some lube. He drizzled it over his fingers and let some drip all over Sherlock’s ass. He started to work open Sherlock’s hole and was pleased at how much Sherlock’s body was willing to take him in, he looked forward to plunging his cock into Sherlock’s warmth. He shoved Sherlock off his lap and on to the floor, he paused for a moment and was about to be very concerned when he realized he made a miscalculation on how high they were off the ground. And was slightly embarrassed that he pushed the lanky man who was essentially a human puddle at that point off a rather tall bed, er maybe he didn’t even try to brace his fall sometimes that helps. He peered over the edge of the bed at Sherlock. And mildly panicked at how still Sherlock was on the ground.
John chuckled, "looks like we are going to have to move this to where you are lying down and not going to topple us over. But I do love your enthusiasm."
John looked off in the distance, realizing what he had just done. He knew he would have to be careful, because this was the year William decided to really up the ante with the contract. It wasn’t something spectacularly terrible, it would just be inconvenient. William wanted a dog, and not just any dog, no he had to want a corgi basset, and he wanted it to be a puppy, because apparently he had plans. Plans that he would not share with his parents. John and Sherlock also agreed that William was little too young for a dog especially one that was known to be stubborn and incredibly intelligent. Also John wasn’t quite sure just how much of the combo of stubborn and intelligent can be added to their household.
"You got kicked out of the Old Guard society because you refused to stop wearing tutus with your leathers, and to top it off when it came to a formal leather event you paired your leathers with a vintage 1950's cocktail dress," said Aithne, "and with that you seriously tossed your primary partner's credibility as a good Dom down the drain."
Aithne read his expression as concern, and that didn't bother her, "I mean you can tag along, we got a private jet."
"Your posture and the rest of your body language just screams sad, sir," said the third teen.
3 months later.
“It was easy once you see where the ligaments met the joints, it was all a matter of picking the right pressure points after that,” said Eurus with a bit of a smile, “but I mean I can’t possible be the first person to do it.”
Siger thoughtfully wrote down as many terms he wanted, but was planning to pick the top 3 after he thought out all possibilities.
The man in a suit frowned, was he being that obvious, “okay fine, you are rather correct on the big brother thing.” He sighed, “the name is Mycroft, and I would really like you to accept the offer.”
Ella's neutral expression once again cracked a small smile, "just all is not loss, together we can work on looking at what was loss and what can be regained, and I am sure you can live a better life on your terms."
“Okay all done, that wasn’t too bad was it?” Said John, watching Sherlock’s reaction In the mirror he looked incredibly relaxed. “How do you want to cum?”
The cabby turned around and said, "sorry sir but no dogs."
“We are definitely changing to a different set of pajamas before your parents and Mycroft come,” said John. “I mean we can never be sure about who knows what, and for all we know you parents or Mycroft knows what the eggplant and peaches mean.” He pat Harry on his shoulder, “It’s nice to know you still have a sense of humor, but we are so going to get you when you least expect it.” Suddenly a paper ball bounced off his head and he saw William giggling like a mad man while project that William built launched various items in the air.” He glared at Harry, “we are definitely going to return the favor when you least expect.”
John laughed, "there isn't anything to be sorry about."
Sherlock nodded, but kept his eyes averted.
Sherlock looked at the bartender in a fairly practical get up of a mechanic jumpsuit with some reflective tape. “Jeanine, I guess I’ll trust your decisions on the drink if it means less trips to the counter,” replied Sherlock. “Do you got a plug on E at this venue?”
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” asked Sherlock as he pulled up his website he turned the leather daddy, “happy now, it was you!”
“I am going to ignore that comment,” said Aithne.
Mycroft got agitated and rushed at her again, Ella took a step forward and crouched below mycroft's broad swing. She quickly turned around rolled her body behind Mycroft, and did a quick tap at Mycroft's vest. A redlight flashed. Mycroft let out a frustrated groan.
John took a moment to get back into his head and turned to Mike, “is that Sherlock?” He stared at the man in the suit who was no in a bit of an argument with two men, also in line with him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock nodded, "do you take card?"
“Hey Captain, where’s the cane?” Asked Bryson, one of the young volunteers who was planning to go into public health education.
Sherlock’s visits pretty much reduced any urges she had kill any of the orderlies or care providers, the boredom was a bit manageable when she was able to know that there was something to look forward to. She really did only kill to remind people that she was still there. She knew that every person she killed meant a cover up had to be done, and people would be missed and others would feel guilty, they left huge craters on the earth when she killed, there was no ignoring her when she killed. She felt that her middle brother was absolutely singular in his attention, that and he liked puzzles so as long as you had his attention you were interesting and she wanted ever so much to be interesting. Weird is only okay when you are infesting and she didn’t just want to be weird... well weirder than she was no, there was no going back at this point. She read the books, she didn't even get a chance, she wasn’t even at the age of reason when they put her away with no hope of returning.
William just has some questions about his papa's work.
Sherlock laughed, "actually there is a few vet clinics who owe me favors, I caught a person who was running anti-freeze through the water fountains of dog parks and would stick rat poison in cheese and throw it all over the park. And the man was actually quite wealthy, so he had to pay for the damages for all the sick pets. He said he did it because he was tired of stepping in dog shit. One of the clinics who saw the worst of it, said that i was welcome to bring a pet in anytime, which works out when I need to help one of my informants from my homeless network. Sometimes vet care is more appreciated than other goods."
"Oh come on Sherlock, for once you are speechless, this is brilliant," continued Sebastian.
"Yeah I get it Blaze, the fact that we got a pill that reduces your chances of getting HIV by 99%, 20 years after the peak of the epidemic is amazing. Can't wait for the shot to hit the market, because my job would be so much easier for some patients, I mean just have them come in once a month, get their invega, depo, and PrEP in one visit, so many of my clients would be happy with that. But we really should include dad on the Google Calendar, I mean it really helped in cutting down the amount of parties we found our siblings at," replied Aithne as her laughter does down. "Maybe all of you should just keep tabs on Grindr or whatever apps you are all using to ensure you don't accidentally over lap fuck buddies."
“Six! AH Seeeeven, eighhhT, NINE, ten!” shouted Sherlock, he got tense but slumped forward against John, his cock was twitching and delivering spurt after spurt of cum. He kissed and licked John’s neck occasionally delivering a bite. He felt like he was completely spent but John still didn't let go of his cock. He groaned as John continued to stroke his cock, “eleven, tweeeelve, aaah thirtEEEN, ouch, FOURTEEN, FIFTEEN!” He wanted John to slow down because he felt the continued touch was  ramping the post orgasm high into that weird edge of panic that hits when a good thing won’t stop, because the bad that follows will be just as long. He took a deep breath.
John stepped up to Sherlock, and place a hand firmly around the back of his neck, “stop squirming and in the future I will tolerate that, but since this is our first time playing like this, I will let you be, but you are going to listen to me when I tell you when you did something wrong. And you are going to do everything in your power to never repeat it.” He guided Sherlock from his current kneeling position where he was slumped down. “When I tell you to kneel I want you to give me your fullest attention, when you allow yourself to rest like that your mind is going to wander, is that clear?”
"Of course, you don't," replied Danny who was smirking.
Aithne took another sip of wine from her glass, she thought that today was a rather full one, and she felt the weight of continuous boredom that affected her slightly lift, she smirked, things were getting interesting.
John laughed, “what does boredom have to do with a trip to the country side?”
John laughed, “Oh I can certainly keep it up.” He dropped a hand down to Sherlock’s thigh and gave it a tight squeeze. He smirked as he saw Sherlock blush from the corner of his eye.
Sherlock smiled and leaned against the wall, and sunk down. He thought, “well I am fucked, what is this sentimental shit he hasn’t even known the man for a day yet, and now they live together and this was the first time he has been with the same person more than once in purpose.” He shrugged his shoulders, maybe this won’t be too bad, a silly thought flashed across his mind, John was definitely an exceptional person and he was starting to show that he might even be able to live with. But he was definitely a bisexual given that he was indeed wearing bi-pride gear yesterday. He felt the slightly irrational thought that John would just leave him for a cis woman, so that they can have the heteronormative dream package. It wasn't even like they were exclusive to each other or anything more than fuck buddies who live together. Also he needed to box up that bi-phobia and crush it. Ugh what the hell is wrong with him, yeah the man is as close as he can get to building a perfect partner, but why was he already so attached, if he was willing to help with cases then he would be perfect. He almost wanted to accuse his brother of setting off a bizarre chain of events to get him to this point, like the fuck is his, things rarely work out for Sherlock.
John nodded and handed over Toby's leash. "Here you go Sherlock."
Aithne held her hand up, "that isn't the start of it. Do you think if we can pick the three new folks I can take the time for a sabbatical?"
Mycroft immediately felt like an asshole, he was tearing down the road of some council housing, they really didn’t need some loud as fuck car tearing down their road recklessly.  He sighed, “okay tell me the intersections and they should be there by the end of this week, i’ll even check on it personally.”
“Darling, I am sure you got enough will pow-OUCH! William you don’t bite people,” said John quite cross at the fact that his son decided to bite him just because he managed squeeze out a name pun again.
John prepares Sherlock for more fun.
Sherlock handed the money to him with an okay tip.
Why yes, I am still bored out of my mind and recovering from Top Surgery. Don't tell my office though, I think I actually want to be fully functional before starting work again.
Hiram raised an eyebrow at his daughter, curious about what kind of case she was being offered.
"Nope, not good, I think I can only take so much more writing," interrupted John.
“Yeah Wolf, I think this is more of an issue for Daddy to handle and not Dad,” said Hiram as he laughed.
“Well I was dumb enough to tell her in proximity of many ways to attempt to break one’s hand, and you know how I am trying to be a surgeon,” said Athina with clenched fists and a twitch of her jaw.
Mrs. Hudson smiled at Kayla, "oh believe me Kayla I may not have pictures, but I do have stories. They are going to have to fear me approaching the mic."
Solomon nodded, "would it be okay if Bopper gave it another try?"
And things felt great at least at home, school was taking a while to adjust and at times he was convinced that the school just wasn’t going to help. Eventually after an argument where Papa tore the school administration apart with his deductions, he moved to a new school, and it was great until one day, the teacher accidentally called out William’s old name, and unfortunately after that came out no one would forget. Not that he minded he knew he couldn’t change that fact about him, he just wished that people were better after they learned the info. Papa and Dad worked very hard to see how the teacher found out William’s birth name, and found that it was connected to his permanent record as a student. The school administration said that they couldn’t do anything about it until, William got a name and gender change, much to their frustration because they couldn’t change his documents until he was 18 and underwent gender affirmation surgery. Papa promised William that if they couldn’t get him on hormone blockers, they would sign the paperwork to get him top surgery at 16, and even promised that they would travel to the US fo medical treatment should he face anymore roadblocks to the hormone blockers; which made William worry about the cost. But uncle Mycroft and grandpa and grandma all said, that the money was there and that he didn’t have to worry about such things.
