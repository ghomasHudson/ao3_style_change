My own cock throbbed, aching for attention. With one hand on Holmes, I loosened my buttons and let my prick poke out of my trousers. It hung heavy as I leaned over him, my bollocks full, and as I sucked Holmes I pictured our union when the case was over: naked and slick and open. I imagined opening him up on my fingers until he was begging, and then pressing myself inside his hot passage. I imagined sinking down onto his lap, pierced to the core. I couldn’t help stroking myself as I stoppered my mouth with his stiff offering, as his fingers carded through my hair.
My reply is to pull back, wet my lips, and take him in a little deeper. I bob my head, working him inch by inch, until my mouth meets the side of my hand. Then I retreat and begin again.
"Harry's gay, and has a lot of gay friends. Wait, did you look her up while I was gone? How do you know what she looks like?"
Watson was still watching me when I looked back up, a smirk on his face. "They're figured us out," he said.
was at turns playful and electric. Smoking in the evening on either side of the fire had a layer of intimacy it hadn't before.
"This molecular gastronomy business," John said. "That thing with the pesto. That's going to be the main draw of our restaurant, isn't it?"
John followed as Sherlock gave Greg a tour, blatantly eavesdropping on their conversation. It was his business too, he reasoned. Sherlock was gesticulating with enthusiasm, explaining how they were going to lay the place out.
kitchen," Sherlock said firmly. He took his hand off John's knee, leaving a weird cool spot in his wake, and got up. He stood in front of John, nearly toe-to-toe with him, and offered John both of his hands. "Get up. We'll clean up the risotto and send everyone home."
"Well," I said, peering still closer, "there are a few minor details to be cleared up, purely for my own curiosity, but, yes, I am confident in my conclusions."
"Gentle," he gasped, and I let up. Blood had begun to rise to the surface: speckled evidence beneath his skin. I never marked him where it would be seen above his collar, but I liked to leave them where he might spot them during his morning toilet. My prick twitched, encouraged by the imagining.
I looked over at him, prone on the bed with his head under the pillow, unconvinced. Holmes had hidden a lot of things over the years, but a yearning desire for me was unlikely.
I spilled my load into the hood of his prick, coming against his tip, and he moaned loudly. I jerked his prick clumsily; our foreheads bumped together. The pleasure, the wickedness of it, spun my climax out into a long series of spasms.
The water was starting to cool when he finally turned it off and got out. It was past midnight. He dried off and slipped into the bedroom. John stirred as he found his pajamas and dressed, and lifted the corner of the duvet for him. Sherlock couldn't hear the traffic noise from Baker Street; instead, John was breathing quietly beside him, his head propped up on his folded elbow. Sherlock turned to face him. He could see John's eyes gleaming in the dark, open but unfocused.
Watson kept a foot on Williams’s thigh until I had finished and straightened up, and then we both stood there in the grass, awaiting the arrival of Scotland Yard.
John, open-mouthed with shock, found the coat hanging where Sherlock had said it was. It was the same white coat that the rest of the cooks were wearing, and it had his name on the front.
John nuzzled into his hair, breathing in the salt-and-smoke smell of him. Sherlock panted, clinging to John. His prick softened slowly in John's sticky hand, and if they weren't careful they were going to end up glued together in unpleasant ways.
"All right, Sherlock?" Greg asked, peering at his list upside down. "Oh, not the 2005 Castelle sauvignon?"
Sherlock's hand tightened on John's knee briefly. "You will," he said. "You'll have to fill in for me sometime, I'm sure."
We caught a cab home at Aldgate, and all the way Holmes sat uncomfortably upright, not slouching into the corner as was his wont. I wanted to ask if his laces were too tight, as I suspected they were, but the two-wheeler was still too public a place to have such a conversation, even at a whisper. I kept my mouth shut, though I ached to ease his discomfort.
"Oh, certainly," he agreed, giving my hand a little squeeze. I felt it zip through my body like an electric shock. "The persistent sort can go days without water, although it isn't any fun."
My hand not holding the book had drifted, and now lay on my thigh. My pulse throbbed between my legs, and as I read I found myself rubbing my thumb up and down along the seam of my trousers. It pressed the fabric of my trousers and drawers against the swelling head of my prick.
He squeezed the valve again, Sherlock moaned louder and closed his eyes, gasping for air as his hips banged the bed with every single thrust. John was holding Sherlock by the hip as he was about to come. He felt so hot from the inside, his body irradiating warmth as John’s drips of sweat fell on Sherlock’s neglected prick.
After two more hours of sketching, Mycroft realized with regret he was just another human as he noticed how much his hand began to hurt; it was time to turn to mundane remedies for cramps.
However, he always found at least a spare second to ask himself (and of course, self-flagellate) - Why?! - Why did he have to find any valid reason to put a name to something indescribable? How could he name the urge to suppress the utter joy of Sherlock holding him by the wrist knowing perfectly that Mycroft, in an instant, would lose the battle against his better judgment; he would give in sliding his hand up so their fingers could entwine.
“Perhaps we can come to an arrangement; I'm thinking about getting something more complex than any of these pieces ... would you be willing to talk about my vision and other payment methods?” Greg sniggered, “please say yes; I don’t know how long I can keep talking like I have a stick up my arse.”
His knees hit the ground, and it was like watching specks of dust surrender to the wind and gravity. Sherlock didn't stop his eyelids from dropping.
A beautiful yet macabre dance of fire sparks, ash and smoke, reached the night sky. But it was all right.
The recall of previous encounters made John twice as cautious with Sherlock; he took an extra couple of minutes to secure his waist to the chair, leaving him in a fully vulnerable and exposed position. Sherlock growled as both men worked in silence while Lestrade paced around the room. Greg approached an anxious Sherlock Holmes, who couldn’t help being hard and leaking already.
– he could’ve going on and on with the list, but a very unamused Sherlock just pushed the door and it opened.
There is a moment in the life of every man in which he must suppress an erection for two hours (or more) to not distract the attention from what is really important. That night, Sherlock was that person. He was dying to tear off Watson's clothes every time he mentioned how they had spent seventy-two hours without sleeping, taking care of the wounded ones, pulling out bullets with his own hands and fighting not to pass out due to fatigue.
Okay, I should have written and finished this about a year ago, but I had a crisis; I almost died ... but I lived! It is finally finished.
“You know what, I’ll make all these less traumatic for you, how about I clean your wardrobe and you clean mine? That way you can finally get rid of my hideous jumpers, deal?”
. But if Mycroft here insists in conducting surveys then so be it. Gregory, what would you say is my best feature?”
“Surely, but I meant you haven’t taken a shower in the past four days and haven’t eaten more than half an apple, cold tea, two aspirins, a bar of expired chocolate and cheap scotch”.
They decided to take a cab to Baker Street for the sake of their safety and to pick up a few things John still hadn’t retrieved. As they got to the flat, a very drunk Sherlock Holmes tried miserably to hit the key in the lock, until a very exasperated John snatched it and opened it himself.
John, who had spent the best part of his life behind Sherlock (sometimes literally) only in his dreams and cold nights, would have managed to conceive what until that moment seemed like a dream; the sound of each whimper escaping from the second most stoic man in the world. Officially, his self-control had threw-itself out the window.
There was no response from the frowning figure in front of the telly. John wasn’t looking at it, his blank stare wandered to the pouring rain hitting the window, “John, get up”.
Sherlock's body gave its last spams as he fell limp onto his back, arching involuntarily at the leverage provided by John's still tied hands.
He held John’s hand harder and speed the pace at his own rhythm; John arched his back to Sherlock, gasping for sweet culmination. Sherlock pressed his forehead against John’s back and groaned in pleasure as he kept pleasuring John.
“Mother used to leave for a fortnight, specifically during school break, to visit Uncle Rudy. Feared, his tendencies for transvestism and
“Almost there, we wouldn’t need to walk this much at midnight if your pompous arse didn’t insist on living in Chelsea, surrounded by emptiness and marble…”
“Mrs. Hudson; it’s not going to make any difference if we take the boxes tomorrow, yes! We’re on it … turns out he has more coats than I expected! … yes, tomorrow morning, yes 8:00 a.m.; I’ll bring you biscuits!”
After Greg went chasing Mycroft, John and Sherlock glided gracefully to the floor, soaking in postcoital glory. Any other time would have been the perfect occasion to take a nap; at the moment, it seemed a bit odd with the
But today, it was six in the morning, and he was sure John hadn’t slept a bit. It was very much to say coming from Sherlock, who considered himself a self-imposed nocturnal creature, but even for his standards, John was beginning to look like an actual living dead, pale as fuck, emaciated, sick and sad.
"Oh! Mycroft's been sculpting a replica of your cock for the past two months, he can't get it right because he can't do it by memory, that's one of the few disadvantages of so many years sticking to facts and harsh reality, you forget to let your imagination fly away … that's why he needs models, he doesn't have the muscle memory for … the touch; he even had clay poisoning from trying to deepthroat it while still fresh and failing miserably … which could only be entirely possible if he already had said ginormous dick in his mouth prior to it, so stop being hypocritical and prude."
“Nothing; just … cleaning and making sure you don’t get rid of something … very valuable, like these” – said Sherlock lifting one of the notebooks.
, last time”, he laughs at the absurdity of that phrase, of course it couldn’t be their last time, they had had at least thirty “
Lestrade kept walking toward the building while giving him a middle finger. He didn’t turn back. Both men had to admit they hadn’t had much fun in ages.
“I told her, stupidly, about how I seemed more logical to share a room with Mycroft if I practically spent every night with him… I don’t think there are enough words in the entire existence of language to explain the look on her face that horrific day she just … opened the door.”
Greg almost loses balance as his legs gave in with each of Mycroft's licks. Just as he was ready to fall on his knees admitting defeat, the cold air hit him. Between gasps, he saw Mycroft cleaning the corner of his mouth, smiling.
“At some point, Mycroft squeezed my shoulder almost unnoticeable. Just a hint to trust and don’t do anything stupid… more stupid. Obviously, Mother’s sobs only made Father suspicious of something going horribly wrong. We heard his steps just a few seconds before the shouting started again; she snatched me away from Mycroft as much as the small room allowed.”
“I don’t think you realize that Sherlock might look sculpted in marble, but you are the hand that knows how to hold the chisel.”
John's fierce countenance, unable to contain his frenzy, made Greg decide to take the reins and align their cocks so that little by little, they were introduced into the cavity in front of them. And what a delicious feeling it was; so much better than anything they could've imagined. At first, it was just the tip, painfully slow.
and marched holding Sherlock by the arm. They began to circle the store until John confirmed his suspicions; all gas stations in the middle of nowhere must have a warehouse.
Naked, he felt John carefully lift him on his chest so he could have better access to the nape of his long neck, nuzzling and inhaling.
"Being your little doctor one, Greg two and–" Mycroft's hand groped Sherlock without warning, long fingers closing on tight flesh and fabric one by one, delighting on the sound of surprise coming out his sibling "–of course, you. What was your initial question? Oh yeah, cheekbones or arse … unlike you, I delight myself on thinking about Dr Watson delight expression as you shut the fuck up and please him or Greg's muscles contracting, dutifully filling your beautiful lean, taut entrance while licking your back … do we have a deal?" he released the hold on Sherlock's groin.
He couldn’t do anything. This time he truly couldn’t fix everything, especially Sherlock’s broken heart.
John pushed him against the wall, his shorter height would not stop him from showing off in front of his flatmate. He rubbed Sherlock’s torso under his shirt, never breaking the feral kiss they were sharing, feeling every muscle in his slim but ripped abdomen. How on Earth was this man so gorgeous if there were days when he saw Sherlock ate a single piece of toast and took a sip of water along with copious amount of tea?
– said John Watson while putting a small polyurethane cup in front of Sherlock’s face for him to hold. He bent down with difficulty to sit on the sidewalk in front of the gas station shop where they were stuck, for the moment.
John held his head between his hands and kiss down Sherlock’s pain away, preventing him to keep up with the speech but letting him get his much sought-after release.
He took a bit of Sherlock’s saliva with his index finger and rub it against it and his thumb, proceeding to mix it, tenderly, with the pre-come coming out Sherlock’s glans.
– pleaded John, and Sherlock slid in another finger and couldn’t help to pull John’s hair a bit as he took a rougher rhythm bouncing on John’s lap, near to come as well.
Sherlock’s eyes were full of tears; not by fear of sadness, merely by his body responding to the urge of breathing and releasing … much more to the “releasing” part. Who the fucked needed oxygen when you were that aroused?
“This is what you signed for!”, he spat, “The fact that you think so great of yourself as a self-sacrificed prick who thinks can save everyone around you is …”, he visibly was struggling to avoid stuttering, failing miserably, “… why do you keep having this need … this … this….
John slowly reached for Sherlock’s trousers and started to unbutton them, sliding them slowly down his ankles and taking them off. He left him just wearing a tight pair of black pants; being extra careful on not to mention the small wet shadow that was peeking in Sherlock’s front.
Soon one digit became two, this time in a faster dance, brushing with more force and incremental rhythm to the growls that John could not help but making, remembering that he still shouldn’t spill a drop.
“Neither will I, I'll certainly be waiting to mention it at the right time” – Sherlock smiled – “Good night, John” – and headed to the living room.
Sherlock whispered in John’s ear, “Did you hear that, John? If you behave, you can ejaculate all over Mycroft’s 800 string sheets of Egyptian cotton threaded by virgin Cambodian hands.”
He would never be sure what did the trick. If it was the sudden discovery of how good a kisser Lestrade was, the taste of Sherlock still present in his mouth, how the channel of muscles around his penis contracted or Mycroft's gasp of surprise. Whichever it was, John came with a force never felt before.
John was surely ready, like so fucking ready, to just thrust himself up Sherlock's prostate until he was begging him to please stop scrambling his intestines.
– and slid his fingers into Sherlocks hole, a mere and minimal consideration before sliding his own pumping prick inside him.
“It’s fucking marble, Mycroft. You almost left me one-eyed for something that is impossible to get stained so I’m asking you again … are you ok?”
Mycroft endured the pain of Sherlocks clutch, rocking him trying to ease away the pain. Once again, he was twelve and Sherlock five, crying over how his knee hurt because he fell riding his bike, only this time Mycroft couldn’t do anything to stop the pain.
– and held him by the hair with both hands, knowing how his Adam’s apple bounced every time he swallowed at John’s touch. Pulling with one hand and caressing his forehead with the other –
and Sherlock sprinted up the flat almost making John stumble down the stairs, running to lock himself in their old joined bathroom.
John pulled down his trousers and pants enough to extract his member, gave him a few strokes before putting a condom and spitting right into Sherlock’s hole. He put himself in position and aligned the tip of his cock to Sherlock’s entrance, but before doing anything, he took the little valve of the blood pressure meter and squeezed it twice. Sherlock’s eye popped at the realization of what John’s was about to do, he gulped and puffed, repeatedly.
After a deserved moment to catch his breath, Sherlock finally spoke, wrapping his arms around his lover’s torso.
By this point, they hadn't noticed they were close enough for John to lean in and give Sherlock a little kiss on the shoulder.
– said Sherlock in a sensual whisper, while strapping his legs around John’s torso letting the doctor carrying him wherever he wanted.
– said deeply and trailed John’s hand to his leaking manhood, helping him set the pace he was pleased with.
"Irrefutable statement, fantastic. Now John, same as Greg; slow firm strokes, I need to see how the veins stick to the membrane… oh, lovely! lovely colour and already leaking a bit, may I?"
"Then call Anthea, tell her a family thing arose and you will need to be off-duty, completely unbothered for a whole month while taking care of blah blah insert excuse of your preference blah blah, sincere regards and affection. Do it."
The luck was thrown; the four men looked at each other as the youngest among them tried to run away; somewhat for the thrill of the chase as part of the game, and because he realized he had talked too much and too soon… a very recurring mistake in his life. They caught and pinned him against the wall. Sherlock grunted as his face was smacked repeatedly against the cold concrete forcing him to calm down and cooperate. John grabbed him by back of his neck, almost spraining his arm until he was knees down on the floor. He was let go until an irritated huff left his mouth letting the rest know he was willing to cooperate.
John's mouth began to water from the enticing scent but mostly from the dramatic beauty of a work of art of flesh and blood—a sinful dammed soul. The sound of Sherlock's shallow breaths did not match the fierce lust within John. A strange and irrational ferocity took hold of him, making him bite Sherlock's shoulder shamelessly, delighted when he finally emitted a gasp that turned his guts.
The session could have declared its conclusion, at least called off for the day. Everything has a limit, even outbursts of repressed unbridled lust.
Now that he thought about it, it perfectly explained Sherlock's new devotion to only accept cases on working days and, if absolutely necessary, on weekends with nothing less than something involving rotten corpses.
Still in his four, Sherlock complied. His lips parted in anticipation at Mycroft’s next move. His thoughts were interrupted by a cold piece of cloth being wrapped around his eyes. Sherlock was sure he would’ve come in that instant by the touch of Mycroft’s fingers tying the blindfold, tracing all over his scalp, if hadn’t been for that damn cock ring. Fuck that damn ring.
“No, you already are a hoarder; actually, you should go and clean every biological sample in the fridge if you do me the favor!”
Probably because it helps avoid the insisting gaze of his partner silently asking him to pull himself together. Clock’s ticking and Sherlock Holmes’ is not well known for his patience.
It was 3:55 am; they were in the middle of nowhere. Freezing cold. They made each other’s company in silence. Sherlock stared absently at the small waves the breeze was forming on his coffee’s surface; he was sitting in his signature pose, grabbing himself by the knees as much as his great height allowed. Being side by side with John gave him an unsettling sense of comfort. He sank deeper in his coat protecting his face from the wind. Their silence was only broken by the distant sound of passing cars, the chirping sound of the gas station light flicking, John’s careful chew and Sherlock’s occasional sips.
"Nope, use your imagination; I'm not your submissive altar boy. Besides, you've done it before … would feel rather disappointed if I didn't leave a sufficiently lasting impression. Should we start checking that big fat brain of yours for degenerative signs?"
John helped Sherlock to sit up while quickly taking off his jacket and coat. He began undoing his shirt and pulling it off, working fast to avoid Sherlock to be exposed to the cold much longer. John was sure the warehouse was getting warmer, not sure if because of it being properly insulated or just because both men were irradiating lustful heat.
“Mycroft took all the blame… and I agreed; I started crying just because I could and seemed logical. All theatrical tragedies include tears. But in doing so, of course, I broke his heart. It was the right thing to do; it was what he told me to do.”
“If I recall correctly, perhaps I was under copious amounts of stress," Mycroft responded and realized that statement could apply for any time period from kindergarten till nowadays.
– and gently brushed his cheek while kissing him softly. Sherlock’s breathing was coming back to normal, tired but pleased.
John was still holding Sherlock, who kept trying to move his hips enough to create friction with John's hand.
Few times did Sherlock feel the need not to fight what was happening around him; he blindly trusted the hands that ran through while the cold touched his skin. He recognized the familiar and timeless smell of Lestrade's low tar cigarettes, cheap coffee notes and his unique, clean manliness; his touch, on the other hand, was something entirely new. The rough hands that caressed his legs slowly removing his pants and trousers, lasciviously approaching his crotch and then slowly backing down.
Each one grabbed Sherlock by one arm and headed him to the nearest chair. Both arms tied heavily behind his back entwined in a praying position. Both of his legs bent by the knee, ankles tied together just below his lower back, each to one chair leg. Thank God for this bloke’s good genes; his long and slim members made him malleable as a slug.
A symphony of crashing glass, banging tables and shouts could be heard from the street were Lestrade’s constable kept waiting for them, only 3 minutes had passed … they still got time. He nervously tried to light a cigarette but rectified after deciding that it would be a long night, in which it would be prudent not to be under the influence of more stimulants. He pulled out a pack of gum from his other pocket and waited.
You’re not your fear of what all of this may mean regarding your immediate future, nor your reluctance to look at me while I admire you… besides the look in your face each time you realise you’re not as straight as you thought is quite precious, now, would you be so kind as to keep sucking me until you gag?”
“I’m sorry about what I said, it’s not in your head… at least, not just there … sorry to belittle it.”
Talking to Greg felt effortless. Sherlock was right; they had known each other for years, but they started seeing each other more often and for less work-related reasons a couple months ago, and by the nonexistent God of Christians as a witness! Mycroft swore he tried to stay out of Sherlock's business and interact more discreetly with his "resources" when the aggressiveness caused by his impertinence became too evident!
Mycroft felt like he could sleep for a week straight, so many hours watching other men fuck left him full of great concepts, colour schemes and basically the pretentiousness of the artist filling every pore.
“No, Sherlock! Clothes! The orphans and the bums need clothes!” –  Deep down, John believed that as years passed, eventually Sherlock would make it at the first attempt. He was completely wrong.
John grabbed him by the wrist before he could get further away and pulled him until he was sitting on his lap, stroking him, guiding his hands between Sherlock's thighs to snap his attention, flustered, whispering: "You still like this, don't you?”, while tightening the grip on Sherlock's cock.
They threw Sherlock not so gently as a frankly stunned Mycroft, gripped the charcoal so tightly that it seemed about to break it. He watched his younger brother grotesquely writhe against the surface of the expensive sofa, as both Lestrade and John charged against him.
"You, in fact. Before the third time in rehab, you asked me to read you ... I'd just wiped vomit from your hair."
John’s head fell back as a blinding orgasm stroke him while his lover's mouth kept taking care of him.
Lestrade's face was steel focused on the two men above him when a small transparent bottle landed just next to his hand. He popped the lid and spread a fair amount in his hand, began teasing Sherlock.
The bottom of the abyss wasn't even the beautiful pale, naked silhouette of which he, at some point, knew every single freckle and variant flavour.
“If you must know, I used that very same coat yesterday for a meeting with Norway’s extra-official Minister of Foreign Affairs; he insisted on having a meal on the terrace.”
As Mycroft did so, Greg took the chance to peek on how good his arse looked in that black suit. The car started moving and they sat in silence for about two seconds before pulling each other into a frantic, desperate kiss.
“Youthful tricks!” Greg smile irradiated sincerity; he just had the gift of being a safe space personified in a tanned French-Brit body.
John checked and squeezed each of Sherlock’s leg muscles every time a new knot was complete. He did that with the rest of his leg until it was completely secured and bent completely from the knee; if Sherlock would’ve been sit, it would have made him fully exposed without being able to protect his manhood from whatever external threat he could encounter. It was not until John finished his Shibari masterpiece that looked up to see Sherlock’s parted lips, breathing heavily with dilated pupils and flushed cheeks.
“But I think I’ve managed all very well since I started living here; you’ve been a great distraction from my inner struggle to function normally; I’ve learned from you that being a little wacky is kindda useful … you keep my mind busy” - John smiled inadvertently while talking
Sherlock passed one arm around John’s waist and the other grabbed his hair possessively, nuzzling at his neck without breaking the embrace, sniffing every single part of the crook of John’s neck.
The memory of a nearly broken arm from underestimating John Watson's complexion sometimes still haunted him.
There was something delicious in the expectation and to see how they fought for who was going to be the lucky winner, the chosen one who would fill him. Was someone gently carrying him as a princess?
But John Watson was nothing if not a gentleman and had a sudden rush of responsibility and clearness within him that made his reptilian brain stop from raw-fuck the gorgeous specimen now nesting in his arms.
Despite the apparent chaos, everything was entirely under control as the fire truck sirens grew louder. A few curious neighbours stationed across the street were broadcasting the morbid show for enjoyment of their few Instagram followers. No casualties, only material collateral damage; for a second, it was a justifiable excuse to admire the beauty within the abstract distress. Reddish and yellowish colours danced along the melody of burning wood.
– said the older Holmes while Lestrade lit a cigarette, gave it a puff and passed it to Mycroft who gracefully accepted and did the same.
“What?! No, I’m O.K.! … look, Sherlock… seriously I” – John was interrupted by Sherlock’s silhouette approaching slowly like ghost, still holding the uniform.
Greg’s now newly slicked hands and fingers teased around John’s still loose hole. Introducing the first digit, he began a slow dance between the rest of them, the different lengths and widths forming delicious torture.
– both shouted as Sherlock pulled out a knife stabbed himself in the chest right in front of their shocked gazes.
"You're right I have enough references, and just enough patience for one brat today. Think that would be all, inspector. John?"
John scoffed at the affirmation. Sherlock approached him slowly and gently made him lift his face to meet his eyes.
Sherlock approached him slowly, John was looking down at the floor, too ashamed to look back at the penetrating gaze of the detective.
Lestrade released Sherlock’s neck from the restrain as John collapsed on his stomach, panting, exhausted. He licked Sherlock’s belly right before standing up to pull up his clothes.
John squeezed the valve one more time, at the same time Sherlock yelled from the top of his lungs (as much as he could) for him to stop. He came inside Sherlock in one delicious wave of ecstasy.
John shifted to Sherlock's other leg, bringing it up to his shoulder, engulfing his shaft in one quick movement, making Sherlock's head fall back and abandon the almost burnt cigarette.
"Lube…", the word came hoarse, as he cleared his throat, "we need lube", and looked around for anything (
“First, I need you to understand that for a great part of our lives, we only had each other, I don't even mean metaphorically; weeks really could go by without us interacting with anyone other
"I need a drink." and without stopping to think if his guests would need more than just their will to stay alive, he left the study.
And it was all too much, he kissed and swallowed; swore his tongue had life on its own and was never more eager to trace every single inch of Sherlock’s face; the feeling was mutual, Sherlock cupped John’s cheeks, pulling his short hair as best as he could; shifting forward so their cocks could be closer. He took both of them in one hand and began moving. They took a few seconds to get in perfect synchrony between their rubbing and Greg’s still deep thrusts.
Despite everything, and worst of all, John understood. He understood, however, he could not contain the knot in his chest while waiting, like a bullet in enemy land, the story's outcome.
“What are you doing? those are garbage, not for charity” – John didn’t feel the need to knock on his own room.
Two or more hours holding that pumping erection; biting his tongue, sweating cold at the idea of being with a hero.
Why was Mycroft so polite when being the most obnoxious? Sherlock wondered as his gaze flicked between John and his brother.
“Hmmm, interesting; cheekbones then. Now Mycroft, let’s move to more compelling matters; we require your skills.”
Sherlock's eyes blazed open, panting with his swollen cock throbbing. His head still rested on John's wounded shoulder.
Mycroft stopped scribbling, astonished. When did the three most scattered and seemingly self-sacrificing dramatic people in the world had turned into degenerate Neanderthals fucking on his expensive sheets? It was not a complaint, just a modest observation.
He took all of it in his mouth and couldn’t help at gasping when the car made an aggressive turn and he held on the first thing at his reach … partly to keep balance, partly because it was the perfect opportunity to do it; and Mycroft Holmes wasn’t a man who missed opportunities.
“You’re holding the bottleneck, and I don’t see a coaster or some overly pretentious glass…” Greg unwittingly became good at reading his distress signals; it wasn't like they were in short supply either.
Sherlock held on John’s arm holding his neck, while John’s other hand ventured into Sherlocks mouth to lubricate itself.
– and led John to sit in his old chair, while he sat at the floor between John legs, parting them to get a clearer view of the doctor’s need.
Sherlock took him into his mouth, and every time he felt like he was about to choke and tried to withdraw, John's hand stopped him in place, pushing himself deeper into Sherlock's throat.
”– a sad, small smirk appeared at the corner of his mouth; he coughed. His chest fell heavy and aching; didn’t sound like just a regular cold.
“I’m sorry; we don’t care, he doesn’t care, it’s nobody’s business but Mycroft, the part where we need your help ‘cause Sherlock burned down a 90-year-old man’s house is unfortunately true. We need you to finish a painting, you’ll only have a month, this poor guy took about three years, but now it’s reduced to a pile of ashes. Can you do it?”
John reached down to brush the sweaty curls away from his face and stared at him. He needed to make sure Sherlock knew he wasn’t lying. He could see his flushed cheeks, dilated pupils and increased heart-beat. He couldn’t help smiling at the sole thought of how freeing was to finally say it out loud.
"Well it makes sense to be devastated if the painting was already sold and took more than a couple years to finish; the money was meant for his only grandson's trust fund. No more family and a kinky way of working not many buyers would accept. I'd say being almost 90, abrasions on both arms, smoke poisoning and bad fortune Craig Saunders will be lucky to even making it alive; he will not have another two years to complete a new one." Sherlock's brow creased as he sipped from the paper cup.
"But not ice-cream or any other specifically conventional food intended for human consumption typically in a non-sexual context? … that's ridicule…"
“I said pure, I didn’t say virginal”, he jerked his head forward to look down at the figure now expecting between his legs,” There is an Oriental say… a man is whatever room he is in, and nothing more.
Once again, the older Holmes felt a rising sense of duty burning through his chest, the same duty that kept the damned country on its feet. He wasn't going to abandon his mission unless his hand fell off, perhaps from spending hours painting… perhaps to help keep such specimen's prick from getting cold. Did the room become suddenly hotter? It probably did.
"Smug bastard. Go get something to clean that up," he said, meaning the puddle of his seed I was attempting not to roll into. "Then let's go to sleep."
, and Sherlock was almost confident that John felt the same way he did. They weren't just getting started on this encounter, this
I gave him my best Gallic shrug then reached over and picked up the blindfold. I held it up with a question in my eyes, and he nodded. I slipped it over his face and then tugged the front down so that it settled over his eyes, positioning the padded notch at the bottom carefully over the bridge of his nose to make sure all light was blocked out.
. A bloody week! And you've been so depressed, you need my help just to manage your daily tasks." Sherlock winced, and John put his arm around Sherlock's neck, squeezing it comfortingly. "That was
"Hold on—who said anything about caroling?" Sherlock asks, looking over Eurus's head at his Mum and Dad.
Father—thats what you call a priest and John is definitly not a priest because priests dont have sex, lol!
If there's one thing I know how to do, it's flirt. I break out my biggest shit-eating grin. "Let's break out a bottle or two of wine, I'll put something together for supper, and you can tell me all about the life of Sherlock Holmes. I
, he said twenty minutes later, tears spent, held cradled in the shelter of John's arms, his short legs cupping Sherlock's thighs.
"I would've told you, but you've been avoiding me since yesterday morning after you talked to Sherrinford!" Sherlock shouts, the note of appeal gone from his voice. "If you want to know why I told my mother it was a mistake to bring you here,
"You can wrap up the crime scene," I threw over my shoulder. "I need to look into something before I can give you any answers!"
John jerked his head up off his desk where he'd fallen asleep over his last patient's chart and the crumbs of the cheese croissant he'd had for lunch. Nadia was holding a manila chart and wincing in sympathy.
"Does he know that you and I were separated for the last six months? That, you know—we were already pretty much—" she waved her hand in the air in a wordless gesture of grim humor.
I only realize I'm staring when he lifts an eyebrow, the side of his mouth quirked up. God, he knows I've been staring and probably what I've been thinking. I flush hotly, ashamed, and turn away. I can't keep my eyes off of him for long, though, and I can see a tiny bit of pink just brushing along the sides of his cheeks and jaws.
for John, too, their time together captured in almost perfect detail in his mind, the vividness not having dimmed even in the aftermath of his mother's death. For the last three and a half months, it felt like John had died, too. Grief had infected his mind, grown, spread like an invasive species of plant that puts in roots so deep, you can never unearth it, never rid yourself of it, no matter how many times you cut it down.
"What about-" John said, his voice cracking at the end—his throat was dry, and he tried to work up some spit so he could speak. "What about
She walks immediately to the kitchen and, muttering under her breath, begins straightening up the mess all over the kitchen table. There's chemistry equipment, stacks of newspapers, pens, half full mugs of cold tea, dirty plates in the sink—general disarray and untidiness. The complete opposite of how I kept my own house.
"How many fingers? Although, I'm curious to know how many men have had their fingers in your arse as well."
, but before I could draw a breath, she had come around to my side of the table, smacked me upside the head, pointed to the door, and said, "Go
a criticism. That was me pointing out why you're not in any position to think about this. But mostly, you and I always throw ourselves headlong into dangerous situations without thinking about it. We don't know how to put the brakes on. We never even bothered to learn anything about each other before we were fucking. It was fucking terrifying to fall in love with you within days of meeting you, but it was bloody
John stares at me for a minute, and, finally, he turns on his heel and flees to his room. I feel entirely too vulnerable in this moment—my skin can't contain the multitude of feelings inside me—passion, fear, anger, longing, hurt—I'm completely undone by the knowledge that I have fallen painfully in love with John Watson.
Then they're going at it, snogging properly, beginning to thrust against each other. John can feel Sherlock's growing erection against his arse, and John sets a rhythm with his body, first lifting himself to grind his erection against Sherlock's stomach, then lowering himself and writhing on top of Sherlock's lap, groaning at how quickly Sherlock's own erection is growing.
Evelyn and Eurus—with Sherlock's occasional input—guide him through the program they wrote. It has state of the art voice recognition and a dictionary of over a million words, with the ability to learn new ones.
The man he's with now is the ultimate predator and the fact that a man like Sherlock—a man with all the attributes John listed only half an hour ago—a man so beautiful and so brilliant—knowing Sherlock wants
—legs further apart, and began making quicker and more shallow thrusts. Andrew came with a whimper as he tried to keep himself quiet—they hardly needed an ASBO for public indecency.
He pushed the lid open so roughly it almost came crashing back down again. The fear I'd felt in the cab was winning by innumerable lengths. It was the only thing beating in my breast—fear at his rejection, at his anger, fear of the pain of a broken friendship.
? My devotion to John is carved on my bones, and the muscle of my heart, and underneath my skin, and I am bared to the brilliance of his star.
"Yes, yes, I know," she said, waving her hand impatiently. She tossed the used tissue in the small metal bin underneath the shelf where the Keurig machine sat. "I know it was my decision, I know you would have let me leave you for him, but Louisa was only four and I couldn't imagine uprooting her like that."
is why you must fix this. If you don't, the two of you will lose the very thing you've been worried about losing this whole time—your friendship."
to think!" John's voice was pained and dangerously close to cracking. "I've sat here for three nights trying to figure out what's going on in that big brain of yours, but nothing I came up with was flattering to me. So tell me, Sherlock. I'm man enough to take it. What brand of ordinary, of
know Louisa was close to her grandmother. Mrs. Hudson leaned close to him, close enough for him to hear her without everyone else doing so. "What Sherlock did was awful, John, and I told him so every chance I got. Poor Sherlock—he was just trying so hard not to hurt anyone."
Sherrinford's voice breaks a little on the last word. "For me—and for Mycroft as well, I believe—Sherlock will
2. The names of Sherlock's parents, Will and Violet, are the same ones I use whenever I write his parents into one of my stories. William is from BBC canon, being Sherlock's first name. As for Violet—I'm not sure where I got it, but that's what I called his mother in my very first Sherlock fanfiction,
Papa—when I wrote this down I thawt it was like someone would call their dad if they were from like history like 1980 or something. But now that I am looking at it again I think I have found the TOTALLY PERFCT name to call John!! I want to tell him RITE NOW but you know I think it will be my wedding present to him. (I'm not getting Dad a wedding present because he's already my Dad and that's enuff of a gift).
John tilted his head back and stared at the ceiling with a smile on his face. Then he pointed a finger at her and said, "You, my dear, are the
Sherlock stood in the middle of the sitting room, a dull buzz in his brain. Words and images from the past twenty-four hours whirled and twisted in his mind, but none of them slowed enough for him to grab onto and study. (
, it was clear to us from the moment he met you that you were something special. Every time we saw him it was
Sherlock looked surprised, which made John wonder just how unfair he'd been when he left that day for Sherlock to be
Before he could start up the stairs, Sherlock came thundering down them from the direction of the kitchen door, blue silk robe flying out behind him as he made the turn onto the first landing and down the last set of stairs. He looked wild, eyes flared wide, and John was instantly on alert.
Sherlock rubs his hands together and then takes a fortifying breath. "I didn't want to ever go through that again, to be so, so
"There you go," John whispers against my chin. "Feel free to touch because I intend to," and then he grabs my right hand and yanks it towards his groin where I greedily wrap it around his partially erect penis. I run a thumb over the velvety skin from midway to tip where the foreskin is still flaccid, hiding the glans. My mouth waters. I find myself barely restraining the urge to suck on this part of John, the feeling almost atavistic—something my body recognizes as
Sherlock lay on the sofa, brooding over this morning's argument with John. In addition to ruining a perfectly good after-case shag, the fight had left Sherlock with another problem—a much,
At that, John's mouth goes dry, blood roars in his ears, and he can feel his heartbeat in all four limbs.
John groaned and tried to shift himself up onto his knees, but I draped myself across his back, holding him down. I thrust myself against him so that he would feel my hardness then put my lips at his ear.
I shrugged it off and thrust it out for him to take. I marginally noted the coat leaving my hand while I tried to banish any non-case related thoughts. I needed to solve this case immediately, because having John and my brand of sex in confluence were setting off alarm bells in my head. There were things I had boxed away in the attic of my mind palace marked
"Um, hello. I guess?" John said and turned to look at Sherlock, utterly baffled. Sherlock still had him by the wrist. He pulled John closer, and whispered in his ear, "If you love me, you'll turn around and walk out the door."
"I'm going to open you up with my lips and tongue until my spit is dripping onto your balls. By the time I'm three fingers deep, you'll be begging me to come."
in scenes during which they were naked, often aroused, or even engaged in sexual intercourse, she didn't find witnessing such intimacy precluded her right to act as a mother figure for those of us she considered as belonging to her. (Which was pretty much everyone who came to her club, but those of us she'd trained were special to her. She called us
Even though I was waiting for him, I was still startled when John walked into the kitchen. His steps were slow, deliberate. He stopped near the table and pulled out a chair. I gave him his tea and sat down in the opposite chair, moving a pile of newspapers out of my way.
Seven months after leaving the doctor's care, Sherlock tried to kill himself by slitting the veins on the insides of his elbows. He'd done his right elbow first since his left hand was his non-dominant one, and he knew the knife would be slippery with blood after the first cut, so he saved the second for his dominant one. He wanted to make a proper job of it. He was sitting against a tree at the back of the estate property, utterly destroyed by the mundanity and pointlessness of life. When he looked ahead and realized he had to get through another
"I love you," I say into the sudden hush. John's eyes are so soft, so full of light. He hums in agreement, sketching a line with his thumb down my face and jaw. "Me, too," he says simply, because John knows how to focus his light, how to distill the truth. In his eyes, I see wonder and desire and love.
They grin at each other. John's too happy that Sherlock standing between his thighs is now a thing they do to be truly upset about the interruptions.
"I love you," Sherlock said. Then, quickly, before his brain caught up with his mouth. "I cleaned my room."
"No, I suppose not," Sherlock said thoughtfully in a quiet voice, looking at his and John's clasped hands.
He showers, dresses, shaves, brushes his teeth. For the previous two mornings, someone has come to wake him at seven, and the closer it gets to that time, the more his heart races and his palms sweat and his thoughts spin. Dread makes him nauseated.
"We've known Sherlock was gay since he was a boy, so if you're worried about our disapproval, don't be. We just want to see him happy."
But if this is all I can have, I'm going to taste and enjoy and store away every moment of this one chance I've been given. After all, it has to last a lifetime. He's so beautiful, and I want to tell him, but I don't want to break the spell. We touch and kiss and shed our clothes, every brush of skin on skin feeling like the edges of two storm fronts skating against each other, electricity crackling between us.
Then Evelyn comes and bends over John from behind, her long hair falling to tickle his cheek. He pushes the curtain of hair out of the way and she murmurs an apology and grabs it up in one hand, but her focus is on the laptop.
After John urged me to take off my coat, I'd handed it to him without thinking about it, knowing he would take it. And he had, even though I hadn't asked, even though I hadn't thanked him, even though it wasn't his responsibility.
and was gone. Forty-five minutes later, John had realized he'd not come back and texted Sherlock a reminder that John was still down there. After fifteen minutes without an answer, John packed up everything he'd laid out, put it to the side, and let the clerk on shift know he was done. Then he'd taken the elevator from the basement up to the homicide department. Greg's office was dark, the door shut. He didn't see anyone he knew in the bullpen and nobody he encountered knew him either.
Even if he was in his mind palace, Sherlock would never be able to ignore three knocks and multiple calls of his name. In fact, he would've shouted something like
He wrapped his arms around Sherlock's shoulders and pulled him close. He heard Sherlock muttering into his neck, and tried to make it out. Eventually he picked out something like
"You're worried I'm going to leave and not come back, aren't you?" John asked with that direct, slightly irritated way he used when Sherlock was being stupid. "You idiot. Of course, I'm coming back. I've only got to start work again, is all. Two days this week and three the next. I'm going to keep staying the night here until I've got a good bead on how that antidepressant is helping. Then I'll have to start spending the night at my own flat again, or there'll be no point in paying rent anymore."
As soon as Sherlock was out of sight, John bent at the waist, choking back tears, his fist clenched against his stomach. He tried to breathe through the agony. He needed to get moving, to walk—that was it. If he stood here any longer he would crumple to the floor, he would fall the fuck apart and then Sherlock would want to fix him, like he'd fixed his limp, like he'd fixed his loneliness, like he'd fixed the whole fucking world for John, turning it from grey to color, flat to vibrant.
I open up a second bottle of wine. Sherlock's face is suffused with a healthy pink glow. My eyes are hungry for him. The alcohol has mellowed my need a little bit, diffused it so that it sits inside me, warm and pleasant, rather than the ravaging burn from earlier. Outside, the ice storm has stopped.
Still, it takes me an unconscionably long time to force my sweaty hand to push down the door handle and leave my hotel room. My Grand Adventure is finally beginning.
"This is East Hoathly coming up," Sherlock says. He leans over with sudden urgency and says, "Look, I would not tell them too much."
Sherlock smiled weakly and shook his head. When she reached up again to kiss him, he let her, the familiarity a comfort. He could not deny her pull on him. Kissing Audrey—having
Audrey was interrupted by the sound of the street door slamming shut. Their eyes met, and Sherlock saw the set of her shoulders, the martial glint in her eyes. In a cool, measured voice, she said, "You have five minutes with him to explain before I introduce myself."
John shifted in his chair, uncomfortable with the wistfulness in Sherlock's voice. Sherlock stares at the coffee table, not avoiding John's eyes—at least not obviously—but John still feels distanced from Sherlock despite the intimacy he expected to feel when Sherlock agreed to talk about this.
"Gimme a few seconds," Andrew said—still a whisper. John began counting in his head, and when he reached fifteen, Andrew nodded.
before then. It seemed—well, it confused me. I mean, we'd agreed we wouldn't sleep together while we were separated."
Sherlock turned and regarded him with a gimlet eye. He opened his mouth, hesitated, and then said, "No. Not as such. Not a
to stick his dick in. With gentle hands he pressed her knees together and then pulled her dress down over them, covering her.
"Uh," is what John says instead, hovering on the threshold. He tries to catch Sherlock's eye, but Sherlock is too busy glaring at his brother, his upper lip curled in a sneer. "Okay," agrees John finally, creeping into the sitting room, keeping a careful eye on both brothers. He sits on the edge of the couch, puts his elbows on his knees and leans forward. "So, what's up?"
"I need your expertise as a doctor, though one never knows when knowledge of running a sheep farm will come in handy during a case!" he says excitedly. "Cancel your rented flat and live with me.
"Okay, okay, we've had our fun," Will says, making sitting motions with both hands. "Let them be, now, let them be."
John tilted his head from one side to the other, then shrugged. They were doing lots of shrugging today. "It's just—I don't really
I wanted to cry, falling deeper into the swirling conundrum of my wants, needs, fears, desires, over and over,
"No," John says harshly, horrified to hear his voice crack on the word. Despite now wearing his coat, a chill bone deep has invaded John, and he begins to shiver. "No, I can't, Sherlock."
"Nothing yet," John said, laughing, trying to slow Sherlock down. "We have time. We have plenty of time."
John's lips, when they touched mine, were slick and soft. Heat flooded my body. He laid his hands on my chest and then, with a slowness that scorched a trail on my skin he slid them up and over my shoulders before tangling his fingers in his hair. His mouth opened against mine and I groaned, deep in my throat. I tried to suppress it but that only lent it the sound of a grunt and John chuckled throatily.
Apparently, I had big chunks of this story, including this very dirty chapter, already written in October but it was lost in a parallel Dropbox universe in which it resided in the "Home" folder, rather than the "fanfic" folder, and I stumbled upon it last week when attempting to work on our tax return.
learned it the day before. He made a face and said Yes but do you think Sherlock will think it's too
to get Sherlock to make the first move, but he said there was no point. Despite appearances to the contrary, he was adamant that you were straight because
"I cried as I ran, and between the crying and the running, I ended up collapsing in the grass somewhere—I don't even remember where, if I ever did—and after my breath slowed down, I fell asleep.
"Two-two-one-bee Baker Street," Sherlock reads dutifully, his voice turning up in delight when he says
he thought, souring with disappointment. "Married?" he cried. "Why do you need a flatmate if you're married?"
Sherlock was not, at the best of times, thoughtful of other people’s needs or expectations. He wasn’t
Audrey groaned, letting her head drop forward. When she looked up, her eyes shimmered with moisture. "A last hurrah? I only meant to talk to you. You've been avoiding me for two weeks. Ever since—"
John rubbed his hands briskly over his face, and when he put them back down in his lap, Sherlock reached out and took his hand again. John looked up at him in surprise, but he could see the gratitude in John's eyes. John squeezed his hand, and Sherlock squeezed back. They kept their hands clasped together.
"Oh, fuck," Sherlock said, jumping up and lunging towards his bedroom, groaning in dismay at his nudity. He surged into the bedroom, and pawed recklessly through his drawers unable to find even a pair of pajamas. He'd only managed to pull on a pair of pants when he heard Audrey's voice call out for him. "Sherlock?" and then she was standing at the door to his bedroom, her RP accent diamond sharp, and her grin amused and pleased. "Oh, darling, you dressed for my visit. How prescient."
"I'm just—the whole idea is nerve-wracking, all right? And why does he have to be so bloody secretive?"
"Hello?" Sherlock called out. He shrugged out of his coat and hung it in the closet of the narrow hallway in which he stood, then started up the stairs. Audrey met him on the first floor, coming out of her office. She was barefoot, dressed in tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt, her hair pulled back into a haphazard ponytail. She wore no makeup, and her eyes were red and swollen. In the mirror that morning, Sherlock's had looked much the same.
A month later, John goes to Tesco's to do the shopping, and he comes home whistling. I look up from my microscope, and suck in a breath that causes him to look up. I stare at him, and his eyes slide away. He clears his throat. He looks oddly guilty.
They gather around the Christmas tree, Will and Violet sitting on a squashy couch near the tree, Mycroft perched on the coffee table, and everyone else sitting on the floor except for Sherrinford who kneels by the tree and starts dragging presents out, checking the tags, and organizing them, John assumes, according to name.
Remember that "heavy angst" and the "grief/mourning" tags? We're going to be in the thick of it for this chapter and the two following it. If you're really not up for the pain, I would suggest waiting until chapter 7 is posted to pick up the story again.
"But how do you get to know someone, to develop that deep relationship when the two of you speak separate languages? Well, that's where I come in. I’m going to teach you how to speak in a language your dog can understand."
"What? Tell me what you sometimes think—that I respect you and that you're vital to my work and my well-being? That you're my best friend? That I share everything with you, more than I've ever shared with anyone? That I care for you? Because if those are the things you sometimes think, then you are correct."
"Oh, I do," I said, my voice low as arousal started to pulse through my body at the challenge. We held each other's eyes. "John," I husked. "Come stand in front of my chair." When our staring contest continued without anyone moving, I dropped my head back and groaned. "Oh, come on, John, I just want to kiss you."
—looked straight at Sherlock and said, in a flat clipped voice, "I'll expect you tomorrow. I'll leave Louisa with my mother, and we can talk."
from 9 to 10. Whenever I outline a new work, I organize the chapters according to natural breaks in the narration. When it's time to sit down and actually write, however, some chapters end up being too long, and then we have to do some fiddling around. Even after cutting this chapter in half, it's still the longest I've posted to date. (Tia said she didn't think my readers would object to an extra chapter or two.)
in her cunt. I could smell it all over you." John's words were angry, but his voice was only sad. "Were you—have you been fucking her all along?"
Sherlock was raised to believe in God, and the idea had persisted to a greater degree than he would ever admit to, no matter how hard he worked to vanquish the idea. He'd always felt a sort of
"Excellent!" Sherlock says. Then his eyes grow hooded and he purrs, "Now. I've a year's worth of fantasies about you stored in my wank bank and I'd like to see how many we can get through before Christmas dinner." His hand reaches out and cups John's head proprietarily. "At the very least, I'd like to kiss you again."
She slid her hands up his arms, her characteristically short and unvarnished nails sliding around the nape of his neck and into his hair. She was tall for a woman, but in her practical suede flats, she still had to tip her face back to kiss him. His traitorous arms automatically slid around her waist, his hands coming to rest just below it. The index finger of his right hand rested at the bottom of the zipper that lay along her spine.
With that, John began to usher Mycroft out of his flat, but Mycroft put his hand against John's chest to stop his forward momentum towards the door, and said, "John, please, will you just consider it? I know what an absolutely selfish arsehole he is, but I know the two of you love each other and—"
"My affection for you still runs very deep," Sherlock said in a solemn voice. Audrey laughed and stood back, reaching around him for a box of tissues. She blew her nose and said, "You've been a good husband, Sherlock, and I suppose after Victor, well—it's not like I don't know what it's like to fall in love with someone when you're still married. I admit that yesterday when I saw the way you looked at him, so desperate to keep him from finding out—I was jealous. Horribly jealous that you were selfish enough to keep John when I'd given Victor up for you."
Sherlock shook his head, looked at his mother's headstone, and was helpless at the wave of grief that overwhelmed him again.
Sherlock nodded, then he was rushing through the hall towards the kitchen, taking the stairs down two at a time in an all-out attempt to head John off.
It's not that Sherlock is always in motion. After all, he could be sleeping or stretched out on the sofa, deep in his Mind Palace. But John can't help being worried. He's known Sherlock less than a year but hasn't stopped fretting over him since the day the idiot followed Jefferson Hope down the stairs and into a cab right under the nose of a group of Metropolitan police officers. In fact, Fretting Over Sherlock is a full-time job for John which explains his default state of exasperated fondness marked with occasional and brief bouts of rage. And constant exhaustion.
I got up onto the bed, straddling his thighs, and slapped my hands onto his arse cheeks—not as hard as when I was spanking him, although he still jerked and hissed in pain. Digging my thumbs into the crack of his arse, I spread him wide, exposing his pucker.
"No," he said sternly. Sherlock's face fell but John didn't see it—he'd already turned back to making his tea. Sherlock fitted himself behind John at the counter, grasping John's hips and pulling him back against Sherlock's still hopeful cock. "John," Sherlock hummed in a deep voice. "Let me at least suck you off before you go to work."
John laughed—it was an ugly laugh—and turned to Sherlock. "I suppose that makes me the mistress? Is there a masculine form of mistress? Lover, I suppose. Although that makes it sound too,
time in bed. Sherlock’s attempts to ignore his body's desire to be with John, had only left John confused and hurt when Sherlock had turned down a second go the next morning.
He grimaced, squeezing his eyes shut for a second or two before opening them and trying again, but before he could speak, a woman in the front row said, "You’re that detective!" and every pair of eyes in the room zeroed in on him.
"C'mon," John said, pulling Andrew away from the wall where he was leaning. "I'll pay for a cab and drop you off. Where to?"
Mycroft and Will sit in facing chairs in front of a hearth twice the size of the one in the Baker Street flat. The fire burns pale orange hot and occasionally John can hear the snap of exploding sap over the sound of conversation. The walls on either side of the fireplace are bookshelves that reach all the way to the ceiling. One of those fancy ladders found only in a gentleman's library is pushed in the far right corner.
"Your office is fine," he said, stuffing his hands into the pockets of his jeans. He felt ridiculously nervous, as though this was a first date, rather than the end of their marriage.
, he thought to himself, having gleaned that much from the leaflet before being accosted by Mrs. Hudson.
, repeating it over and over again. When, finally, a taxi stopped, I ushered him into the back of a taxi, and then —because of course I did—I got a lovely, straight on view of John's beautiful, tight arse. I had to strangle the noise that threatened to escape my throat.
. He waited a bit, knocked again, and called Sherlock's name. Silence. John knocked a third time, called Sherlock's name, and said, "I'm coming in!" and opened the door.
were likely to be involved. The story went thus—Sherlock was born the younger of two sons. Mycroft, the elder, went into Government when Sherlock was still in boarding school. When his parents asked what Sherlock planned to do with his life, he could only describe his future profession as something vaguely
John, looking around at them uncertainly, opens the box and slides out—yes—a brand new Apple Macbook, the most recent version. "Oh my God," he murmurs to Sherlock, then leans closer and hisses, "These things are like £2900!"
"Ah, yes," John said, his smile grown tight, and his good mood beginning to evaporate. "Well. I'm off! Thank you again." He made his way out into the employee parking lot and from there to the bus stop, where his mind immediately began turning over the problem of what to do about Sherlock.
, an observation Sherlock had always protested. Audrey, like him, knew what fitted her and whether it was designer or off the rack, she wore it all with an air of unpracticed elegance. Audrey's lack of fussiness about her appearance was one of the reasons he'd been attracted to her.
Suddenly, John was on the move through the sitting room, into the kitchen and beyond. Sherlock wasn't sure it was okay to follow him, but he couldn't stop himself from doing so. When he stepped inside the bedroom, John was sitting on the bed in the dark.
"I'm not leaving, Sherlock," John growled, finally succeeding in dislodging Sherlock's grip on his arms. "Who's up there? Did someone threaten you? A text, a phone call—did you try to call Greg?"
In the morning, Sherlock climbed out of bed, his half-hard morning erection seeking out John's presence. He found John in the kitchen making himself a cup of tea. John turned around and gave the naked and grinning Sherlock a brief, dismissive up and down glance.
"You can't spend Christmas money on anything practical," Charysa says, her face dead serious. John looks up and sees everyone else—even Mycroft—nodding their heads in the same solemn, knowing way.
John can't help his gawping. There's only two ways Sherlock dresses—straight up formal (or as formal as one gets without putting on a tuxedo) or ratty t-shirts and pajama bottoms. The only times John's seen Sherlock dress casually is when he's in disguise, but he's not
When he was eighteen, he was legally an adult and responsible for making his own medical decisions. He ended his treatment with Dr. Llewellyn. He hadn't told his parents, he'd simply called the office, and told Dr. Llewellyn's secretary that he was done. Despite multiple phone calls from the doctor himself asking Sherlock to reconsider, or urging him to seek help elsewhere, Sherlock felt no remorse and never answered a single phone call.
That had been almost two months ago. John had not heard from anyone in that time, except for Mrs. Hudson who rang him shortly after the funeral. She confessed to getting his number from Sherlock, and apologized to him for having tried to push the issue of his and Sherlock's relationship. John forgave her, his voice rather stiff. He'd never been particularly close to her and hadn't much liked the way she fussed over Sherlock as though he weren't a grown man perfectly capable of caring for himself. That, of course, was before he knew what Sherlock was like when it came to caring for himself.
It took some time for all the Holmeses to file into their pews. There were a substantial number of them, but Sherlock had explained to him in a whisper that his mother had three younger brothers who had seven children, and six grandchildren among them. That explained the large number of dark-haired, long-limbed, well-bred and gorgeous people surrounding one short, weathered army doctor. It didn't worry him in the slightest to be a bit of coal surrounded by diamonds, though, because whenever Sherlock squeezed John's hand, or whenever they caught each other's eyes, he knew—that to Sherlock—John
he said, as he reached into the box and pulled out two hanks of rope, one in each hand, then tossed them on the floor. "And
"Anything else, Mr. Holmes?" Jenny asks after she parks the cart next to the low table flanked by two leather club chairs.
. I love you. Hell, there's lots of people out there who love you, and want to help, and you keep driving them away, but you can't drive me away. Look, let's make this our daily mantra—
There are words interspersed in the savage noises John is making, mostly muffled by my arse cheeks, and I'm not sure if he intends me to hear them or if they're for him alone. Words like
that they're already in the car and crossing over the Thames on Hammersmith Bridge before John even thinks to ask where they're going.
Luckily, I'm used to naked bodies, so I can take all this in without the patient—or damsel in distress, in this case—noticing I'm eyeing his junk. Except when I glance up, I see him smirking, one eyebrow cocked suggestively. I feel my skin heat, but being busted doesn't make me pause for even a second in my ministrations. I situate him in a reclining position, crawling into the back of the Wagon after him so at least I'm out of the rain, trying not to drip any water on his now dry skin. I wrap him in a fleece blanket, crack half a dozen chemical warmers and tuck them around the trunk of his body, then overlay another fleece blanket on him. I tuck his wet hair in a towel, turban-style while he watches me with glittering, curious eyes, my skin flushing under his scrutiny. His eyes are an impossible color—like a pearl grey-green-blue. I tear my eyes away from his and finish tucking him in.
He was curled up naked in the huge Victorian-era clawfoot tub, but there was no water. His hair was greasy, skin sallow, and a patchy beard was growing along his jaw. He looked like he'd lost another ten pounds. His lips were blue and he was shaking.
juvenile?" Eurus asks the table in general then turns to face John and Sherlock, "When you two are as emotionally stunted  as twelve year old boys?"
John had realized that the absence of Greg or anyone on his team meant that they'd gotten information that made them confident they were on their way to make an arrest, and
John's just grateful the gift giving round robin has moved on, meaning he and Sherlock are no longer the center of attention. John takes the opportunity to elbow Sherlock playfully, but Sherlock leans over and says into John's ear, "The next time you elbow me, I'm going to grab your arm and haul you into my lap."
"Thank you," John says to Will and Violet, so touched by their words that he can't look them in the eyes for fear that he'll begin to bawl.
, knowing that John's naked body was in his shower, Sherlock had thrown off good sense and rushed in to join him. The case they were on at the time
From that Friday morning to Tuesday afternoon, Sherlock found himself alternating between numb apathy and manic anxiety. When it was the first, he would start something—a book, a television show—and drift away after fifteen minutes, nothing holding his interest. He ended up sleeping a lot. He didn't get dressed or leave the flat. He had no appetite and only ate in anticipation of John's return, knowing that would be the first thing John would ask about.
John's breath catches in his throat and his heart stops before lunging into a battering fist. "Uh," he mumbles, face burning. "Wow, that's—you really—wow. Getting down to brass tacks, eh?" John laughs nervously and pushes a hand through his hair. Right now he's picturing being the receptive partner in anal sex with
"Don't be silly. Of course we still need the second bedroom at home," Sherlock says absently, looking around the bedroom as though he forgot something. John's heart sinks at Sherlock's dismissal and the knowledge that their sleeping arrangements at home will remain separate.
John follows him through the shared bathroom and into the bedroom he's been using, dropping John's bag unceremoniously on the floor next to the wardrobe.
sober. Sherlock called Mycroft, Mycroft fetched him from jail, and Sherlock went back to rehab. This time it stuck."
"Shut up," Sherlock says, glowering. "You'll bring the whole lot of them running in here." His face is stained so red he looks like he might be apoplectic.
when he tilts his head all the way back to offer Sherlock more skin to lick and ends up banging his head on the cabinet behind him.
John stands there, staring at the cart. His mind is overfilled with everything he's seen and the people he's met in the last ten minutes.
to him. In a few days, should he show enough curiosity, I'll invite him along, and we can sit in on a scene and I'll see how he reacts. Harmless, really."
John allows himself to be hauled out of the car. He's overwhelmed with details—the dormer windows of the second floor, the black shutters on the windows, the grey-green of the lawn that extends just past the drive into trees and then, beyond that, a glimpse of fallow farmland. There's so much for him to take in that he barely registers the chatter of the girl holding him hostage, dragging him inexorably towards the door and the waiting group of people.
Some ibuprofen might be in order. It would hurt for him to sit for a few days. Of course, that's exactly what I'd wanted. I
Sherlock swallows visibly and sits on the edge of the chair nearest the door. Clearly, John's not the only one fighting the urge to flee.
Sherlock nods sharply once and lets out a gusty sigh. John knows exactly what he's going to ask now that it's his turn.
"John," he says with an amused half smile. "How did crying in your neighbor's sheep shed lead you to my kitchen?"
I raise my chin, and offer up the truth. "I regret that my—my overtures were unwelcome, but you'd said you would want—" I try to swallow, try to clear the thick and miserable lump that's settled there, and when I can finally work up enough saliva to continue, I say, "You said you'd want more than I would be willing to give, and I was—
I put down the crop despite John's encouragement, but only so I could clutch a globe of his arse in each hand, kneading the heated skin. I spread his cheeks apart and exposed the puckered pink kiss of his arsehole to my gaze. My breathing stuttered.
I shuffle into the sitting room, fatigue settling over me, and I make for the couch which is closer than my bed. When I manage to work up some energy, I'll call Lestrade, and demand a case. The holidays brought plenty of crime to the city, but it's late February now, and apparently all the murderers have inconveniently gone on holiday.
Sherlock had told himself that when the case was over, and they were once again ensconced in the bubble of the Baker Street flat, basking in their post-coital glow, he would finally come clean to John about the secrets he'd been keeping. Now that he'd gone and made John all quarrelsome, though, there was no way in hell Sherlock was going to open up, even though his anxiety about continuing to keep his secrets was rising daily. How could he justify waiting so long to come clean? Their first time in bed was meant to be their
"The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry." (The best laid plans of Teddy's stories always go awry, usually around the two thirds mark.)
Of course, Sherlock was torn between whether it was better to be pathetic—in which case John might start spending more time here again—or to look like he had his shit together—in which case, John might feel his duty done, and go away for good. There was another potential outcome, though. Once John saw that Sherlock was better, he'd tell Greg to let Sherlock go on cases. And once Sherlock went on cases, he could seduce John into coming along. And once he'd seduced John into coming along on cases, he might seduce John back into his bed. And then everything would be the way it was before except there would be no lies between them. A new start.
My bow skips gratingly across the strings, sour notes making me cringe, as my mind conjures the image of John's hands spreading my arse cheeks to—
"The tow truck is on its way," he says, standing awkwardly. I can't tell if it's because of his ankle or because of what happened between us.
"What?" Sherlock asks his mother, looking puzzled at her censure. He looks at John and then back at his mother.
John sighs and shakes his head. "No. When I said I wasn't gay, it wasn't exactly a lie—obviously I like women too—but I haven't really met many men I'm interested in. At least, not interested in a relationship with them. Men are easy when it comes to sex, but I guess—well, I just always pictured myself married to a woman."
"You're unhappy about going to see your family. Why? Did Mycroft invite me just to irritate you? Please tell me that's not why he invited me."
John closed his eyes and sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. "I will consider it if you promise not to contact me after this. And don't tell Sherlock we spoke."
"You have one minute," John growled, and ignored the look of dismay on Mycroft's face. But then, details he would normally not have seen before meeting Sherlock became startlingly clear. He noticed Mycroft's red and puffy eyes. His disheveled appearance, his casual clothes. He'd
Sherlock didn't immediately answer. He’d rather not recount those months after his breakup with Soren, entertaining the hope of a reconciliation every time Soren called and asked to see him.
John obediently sits, watching as Sherlock fixes his tea exactly as he likes it and hands it to him. While John gratefully sips his tea, Sherlock takes the two white porcelain plates and piles them with neatly cut triangles of sandwiches, three each of cucumber and cheese on each plate. He pours ice water from a pewter pitcher into two tall glasses.
"Sherlock!" John said, pounding on the door with one fist while the other hand wrapped around the doorknob. "If you're in there, let me know or I'm coming in without permission!"
, John thinks, but can't finish his thought because Sherlock is grunting and pumping his hips up as John pushes himself down. They're dry humping like ruddy teenagers and John thinks
Sherrinford, whose head is bent towards Charysa's, lifts it and gives him a censorious look. "Don't pretend like we don't go caroling every Christmas Eve and have done since you were a baby."
John stares moodily out at the orchard now, his hands clasped behind his back. Suddenly, Mycroft appears next to him.
"You're right. I'm jealous. I'm viciously, hatefully, irrationally jealous because I'm in love with you, John, so you'll have to forgive me if I can't bear to watch you go out with someone else," I say. "Eventually, you'll fall in love and get married, and then you'll leave anyway. I prefer to suffer the separation now, rather than later, when it will be all the more painful."
Sherlock was staring up at her, nostrils flared, angry, but a look of imploring in his eyes as well. "You said
is. Before he can discern for himself, the car is pulling into a circular driveway. He can feel as well as hear crushed gravel beneath the car's tires.
Sherlock was not immune to loneliness and want of companionship, and had even developed and maintained long-term relationships. They weren’t friendships, precisely, although they often started that way. Sherlock had the inadvisable habit of sleeping with all the men he made friends with, and for the first few months it was wonderful, and he was wonderful, and the other man thought he was wonderful and told him so constantly, and the sex was fucking brilliant and Sherlock was, for a time, completely sucked into the other person’s orbit. But gradually that keen interest began to fade, and the other person’s adoration became tainted with frustration.
John tears into the paper, revealing a picture frame collage with photos of he and Sherlock. Mouth falling open, John stares at each picture, amazed. There are five in total. There's two from crime scenes and in one of them, John and Sherlock are laughing together, their gazes caught on each other.
"Lunch?" she asked. "We can map out what to tell Louisa. She's been asking if she can stay with you. At least I know now why you haven't let her. I'm guessing you didn't want her bringing home tales of John."
Warning for awful sappy mushiness, which I actually kinda hate writing, but, you know. Louisa said, "Teddy! Teddy! Can I tell them what happened? Please, please, oh, pleeeeeez?" and I sighed and said, "Fine, but don't embarrass me. I'm a Very Serious Writer and focus my writing on Deep and Complicated Human Relationships." She said, "Yeah, yeah," and I instantly regretted giving her this chapter. But, you know. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
MOMENTOUS OCCASION! I said that I wanted to be the one to give them their gifts from each other and so I picked them up and handed them to each other at the same time. They looked at each other all funny like they were
"Please don’t be infantile," the other man said. "I'm extending an olive branch, Sherlock; surely even you can see that. This venture is utterly misguided, and you're going to need me sooner than you think."
"That's for autumn and winter," Sherlock said, shaking his head. "Honestly, John. Venison in April."
"Come on, then," John said, and pushed Sherlock's legs apart, wrapping them around his waist. Sherlock yelled, fingers slip-sliding on John's skin. He could smell John's arousal, his soap, the sharp scent of his aftershave— and felt John's rhythm begin to falter as John approached his own edge. Sherlock needed it, chased it, desperate and hungry and rubbing himself furiously, and then John's fingers found his nipple and squeezed, and he came off like a rocket. The euphoria swept through his body, curling his toes and arching his neck, and he spurted over his fist, come streaking up his belly and ribs. John moaned, riding the clench of Sherlock's body as the orgasm shook him; Sherlock felt him shudder and stiffen, and then John's hips jerked in short, sharp thrusts as he came. His head was down and his shoulders were taut, his mouth open as if in shock. Sherlock kissed him sloppily, still trembling, and John barely responded except to moan deeply.
"What's going on?" he asked, closing the door behind him. Sherlock was sitting on the desk with his laptop on his knees and his feet on the chair, glaring at a spreadsheet of liquid nitrogen calculations. "You know him, don't you?"
"Oh, my God," Sherlock said. He almost pulled away, but he looked up and saw John watching him from across the room. John met his eye and winked. Sherlock looked back down at his parents. "Yes, well," he said, "he's… good at his job."
The next night, John found himself sitting upstairs in Sherlock’s flat, looking at possible dining room furniture on Sherlock's laptop. The wine Sherlock had dug out of his cupboard was spicy on John's tongue, warming him from the pit of his stomach to the tips of his fingers. It was after six, and as the wine went to his head John said, "Show me some of what you've done."
"Yes, yes," I said, pulling his face down for another kiss. He kissed me hard, licking deep and biting my mouth; his hand around my prick moved hard and fast, slicked by my own excitement. I sank into the pleasure, letting it wind tighter and tighter between my thighs. I gripped Holmes's arm, even though that hindered his movement, and held onto the back of his neck, panting into his mouth. He held me tightly, pulling back just a little to watch my face, and rubbed his prick against my hip. I could feel my prick growing stiffer, thickening, my bollocks tightening as I neared my peak. Holmes noticed it too, for he quickened his pace further and gripped me tighter; I clutched at him, arching, my hips rising, and then all at once the spasm took me, and I spent over his fingers.
Then he leaned back, and I washed his chest: the hair, which made him sigh; his nipples, which made him hiss; his scar, which silenced him for a moment; then I dragged my flannel lower, under the water, to his abdomen. His cockstand bumped against my forearm. He caught my wrist. The rolled sleeve of my shirt was damp at my elbow. I looked up into his eyes and found them dark and intent.
I stopped to adjust my position, ignoring Holmes’s whine of disappointment, and lay on my belly between his thighs. His cock went back into my mouth, and now I could take him deep and fuck him at the same time, all the while grinding my own prick into the bed. I felt myself leaking against my belly, and couldn’t stop my hips from rolling. If Holmes wouldn’t last long, I wouldn’t be far behind.
"Harry!" John flailed, fully aware that they could be heard in the kitchen. "We're done here. Thanks for stopping by. When we're ready to open, I'll make sure you get an invitation."
"What," I began, only to realize it wasn't quite the same ring. My wedding ring was a solid yellow gold band; this ring shone brighter, with decorative engraving around the edges.
"There, Watson!" he crowed, turning me in a big half-circle, and then he pulled me to him and kissed me.
“Opening a new restaurant, eh?” she went on. “Terribly exciting stuff. Sherlock warned me you two were coming, so I’ve got a list of things on the tables you definitely ought to try, but don’t hesitate to sample anything else that catches your eye.” She winked.
Holmes lit the lamps, all of them, and fished a cigarette out of the slipper on the mantle. He offered me one, but I declined. Holmes lit his and began to pace back and forth across the hearth, smoking furiously. Cigarettes were for his nerves.
"Oh, for heaven's sake," Watson grumbled, but did as I bid. With he in his drawers and I in the altogether, it did not feel quite so ridiculous or clinical. Now I could admire his broad shoulders, the hair upon his chest and belly and arms, the starburst of his old scar. I half-sat to kiss him, and he bore me down to the bed again in his eagerness.
"Hm," Sherlock said. "Stay here for tonight, then. You're the one who said I should get more sleep."
"Chop those for me," he said, indicating the pile of food. John picked up the knife, tested its edge with his thumbnail, and began to chop. It felt good in his hand—strong, weighted correctly, and sharp as hell—and he didn't let the memory of the chicken dish make him unsteady. The motion was familiar. He could do this, with Sherlock as his witness.
"Wait," he said, as if reading my mind, "John, I beg-- let me finish you, I want you to--" He was scrabbling at my head, first holding me in place so he could push his cock into my mouth, and then holding himself rigid and urging me to move. He didn’t finish the thought, and I could feel him growing closer and closer to his peak.
"I hoped." We stopped beneath the curve of Marble Arch. He didn't usually go much further with me. "And you seem to prefer this end of the park, or so I've noticed. I didn't really expect you to be so quick off the block, but it was damned impressive."
He'd brought the wine with him. We went across the road and sat on the wall that separated the road from the garden beyond. I swung my leg over to straddle it so I could face Watson. The cool air on my face cleared my head a little, but still I found myself admiring him quite openly. He offered me the bottle of wine, still smoking his cigarette.
I exhaled, trembling with excitement. The room was warm with the fire in the grate, but the air prickled along my skin. Watson's soft brush caused a cool, tingling sensation all throughout my groin. He put the brush back in the mug and set the mug on the quilt, and took up his razor.
"They won't!" Sherlock cried, throwing up his hands. "They'll eat what I tell them to, because what I want to give them is not a meal but an
John blinked in surprise.  Sherlock was smirking at him, practically teasing him, and it wasn't subtle.
I brought my hand closer to my face to peer at it. Holmes's body was still a line of warm comfort against my arm and thigh. Our knees bumped upon the bed. We were sharing a quilt. I felt him move closer, and his breath was warm against my shoulder.
Right. Well, John was here, and not back at his horrible excuse for a flat. That had to be reassurance enough. He'd already said he wasn't going to leave Sherlock in the lurch so soon.
That made D'Arcy smile again, and he said, "I imagine it was," with a significant look at my left hand, which still lay on the table. The ring glinted.
"I daresay the Colonel will be put out that we didn’t invite him," Holmes said, his hand sliding into my hair at the base of my skull, "but I’ve never been inclined to share."
"Ladies and gentlemen," John said, "thank you for all your hard work today and over the last few weeks. This may be the only time we are all here at once together, but I hope you have seen and will see enough of one another, and us, that it feels as though we're all a unit.
He put a pot of water on to boil and began to shred the kale into manageable pieces. Sherlock didn't have the same misgivings about living over a restaurant that John did. That was understandable. John wasn't going to join him in
He slid his long fingers into my hair and cradled my head as he returned my kisses, deeping them slowly as we warmed up to the idea. I felt him twitch against my belly, and made a little noise of appreciation into his mouth.
," he murmured, crouching to pick up the magnifier. He looked up at me, his head at the level of my groin, and then rose slowly. The back of his hand brushed ever so slightly against my trouser placket. "I was just thinking of last night, when you were buggering me, how enormous it looked when you--"
"Oh piss off," John laughed, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's neck and kissing his mouth. "You're just fishing for compliments."
Mycroft didn't look at him. He was staring intently at Sherlock, trying to communicate with him without speaking. John didn't know why he bothered; Sherlock wasn't even interested in a verbal conversation, let alone a telepathic one.
He didn't really need to go back to Baker Street; Sherlock was probably sulking and would be annoyed if he turned up again unannounced. Which was why John went. He unlocked the B door— and why had he not thought Sherlock giving him a key to the flat, "just in case," was suspicious?— and went upstairs, not bothering to creep. Sherlock would have heard the street door open.
"Lestrade," I began, on the verge of rebuking him for spinning such a yarn about an interesting case (although with that much peculiarity I would have solved it in less than a week), but then I stopped myself. I looked at Lestrade, with his narrow face beaming (he thought this was the best idea he'd had all week), and at the already-raucous crowd gathered around the table (they'd been here setting up at least an hour already), and at Watson, who was blushing (amused, pleased). "Thank you," I said instead.
"Six dozen congratulatory telegrams says you didn’t have time," I countered. I dug my fingers into the muscles of his back and tried not to fuck his fist, even though I would have been entirely welcome to do so.
"I don't care, is the point," he said. "It's not going to change the way I— think about you—" That sounded awkward— "or your cooking—" Slightly better, Watson— "so long as it isn't going to interfere."
He put two fingers under my chin and kissed me to shut me up. “You’re irresistible,” he said, “and I’m a weak man. But now I’m ravenous and you’re awake and satisfied, so I insist that we go out.”
"I promised to be patient," he said. "You told me off for not courting you, for springing it on you, and now you don't even remember–" He cut himself off, covering his mouth with one hand as if to keep the words from coming out.
I wake in the night, disoriented. Light from the streets shines in stripes across the bed. Something is wrong. I listen hard, but the sounds of the city are distant. The house is silent. It wasn't a noise that awoke me; then, what?
When I found my way back to Holmes, he was standing with Inspector Richardson of H Division at the edge of a small knot of police officers. There were four men seated on the ground, manacled and surly. I could recognise a few of them from their photographs, so I knew at once that the man I'd let get away was the leader of the group, Charles Blakeley.
I carded my fingers through his hair, watching them instead of meeting his gaze. "For meddling in your affairs. Your health and well-being is paramount to me," I said, "but you are the master of your body, and I have no right to tell you how you ought to be... that is to say, you're right. You have been taking care of yourself since your adolescence, and you don't need me meddling in your comfort, or your laces. Your... your presentation of self is just as important to your well-being as your lung capacity, and I apologise for insisting on becoming involved. I just want you to be happy."
"I mean, seriously," John went on, waving his fork in the air, "that fucking sob story at the end of
I felt a sympathetic twinge in my own pelvis as he spilled, and a warmth in my chest as he gasped my name. I bent to kiss his forehead, holding him close as he shuddered; he tucked his face into my neck and I felt a dampness there. When he relaxed again, his eyelashes sparkled. I pretended not to notice.
He chewed his lower lip and then flashed me a not-entirely-convincing smile. Either he had very high hopes for this 'thread' or he had some kind of ulterior motive to get rid of me.
By ten o'clock they were finished. The last guests left, calling their farewells to the kitchen staff, and Lestrade locked the door behind them. The cooks startled Sherlock with a cheer, flicking their rags at one another, and Molly hugged John since he was standing nearest to her. He hugged back, looking surprised.
I narrowed my eyes at him. Whores shaved their nethers to discourage vermin and disease. He'd admitted to a few encounters with ladies of leisure. Inference: he'd found that particular arrangement exciting.
I laughed weakly, turning my face away. I was sticky and exhausted and all the excitement of the day (and week, and month) had caught up with me. Holmes cleaned me tenderly with his (or possibly my) discarded nightshirt, and then tucked himself into my side and lay his head upon my shoulder. He rested his hand upon my sternum, and I felt him playing absently with the hair upon my chest. Once my breathing had slowed, he picked his head up once more. I had collected myself by then.
"I was prepared to let it slide, as you'd promised us 'a real corker'," I said, "but we have a reservation for lunch."
That line of questioning also went nowhere, but Holmes was anything but discouraged. He was eliminating impossibilities and soon he would have his truth. He was marvelous in his element, and I couldn't tear my eyes away from him: he had control of the men in the chair without touching them, without  Richardson's interference or the unfortunate Lehman Street habit of corporeal persuasion. I was grateful for the eidetic memory that meant I didn't have to write anything down.
There were only so many dry runs they could do, though. The chefs had practiced every dish Sherlock had come up with. Sarah's bar was stocked and ready with all the booze and gelatine she could need. Molly had made more kinds of desserts in the last two weeks than she'd made in the previous two years, and she'd nailed all of them. She'd even gotten bored and started coming up with free-from ideas: vegan mousse, gluten-free cakes, sans-dairy ice creams. Toby had learned all of her recipes and could be counted on as a replacement for her days off. There was nothing else to be done.
Sherlock was waiting for him when he got back inside, leaning against the sill of the service window. "
The idea of becoming attached to a machine is abhorrent, but it is the strongest link I have to my old life. It sounds like Watson, and it moves like Watson, and it even jokes like Watson. Sometimes I catch myself calling it Watson, as Lestrade and Greyson do. It’s easy to slip; he was my companion for almost forty years.
Holmes, a classically-trained chef who graduated in 2004 from Ferrandi in Paris, was dismissed from the prominent new Mayfair restaurant Hedonia last autumn after a reportedly loud disagreement with Head Chef Sergio Vitoni over a risotto. His employment record includes several more quick changes over the past few years, mostly as a result of his uncontrollable temper. He does not shy away from this rocky history, and indeed seems to embrace it as the ladder to his current position. If no one will work with him, then what other choice does he have than to strike out on his own?
Sherlock bit his lip and nodded. "Good." He smoothed his hands up John's arse and gave one cheek a little smack, testing. John arched an eyebrow at him. "Sorry."
John shuddered. "Yeah, okay." Sherlock's finger sank deeper, and then John's whole body spasmed at the first brush against his prostate. It had been, he was willing to admit, a very long time since he'd had anything inside him like that, and he was almost too sensitive. "Shit, oh."
“Forgive my interruption,” he said, leaning back and spreading his arms along the back of the settee. “Please, continue as if I weren’t here.”
It was not exactly fine. The prep took too long for Sherlock's taste, even though the cooks were working with techniques some of them had never tried before. There wasn't time to teach and test, John thought, staying out of the way at the back of the kitchen with his clipboard in hand.
He didn't. He wiped me clean and draped the hot towel over me again while he rummaged in his supplies. I wanted to rut against the towel, I was so hard. Desire had flooded my body, radiating from my parted thighs out to my fingers and toes. My nipples were peaked and tender.
Not much, I thought. Just a little reset and a rest. He’d be in fighting form in the morning– when morning really came, not this ante-morning that didn’t count in real time– if only he could sleep.
as a joke, mind—and we haven't finalised the menu, so I haven't really had the chance. I mean, we've only been at it a few weeks."
"Right," John said. "I can tell that this is going to be a solid and productive working relationship."
readers… John wasn't sure what to think. If Moriarty made an appearance, they would just deal with it, like they'd dealt with everything else so far.
John glanced at Mary for back-up, suddenly uncertain. She was his employee, but she was also the host of
The years between meeting Mary and losing them both were some of the best in my life. I had everything I wanted: a wife, a career, a best friend who was always glad to see me. Now I realized perhaps those years were not so rosy to him: I had divided my time, chosen someone else over him, and only appeared on his doorstep when I needed him. How much had I given when he needed me? He had certainly dropped by to whisk me away on some puzzle or other, but I couldn't think of an instance where he had visited simply for the sake of visiting.
When Holmes first announced his intention to retire at the age of fifty and move to the coast, he neglected to invite me to come along. We were at odds for a week before we both realized whence the miscommunication had arisen, and then he begged my forgiveness very prettily and told me he’d already bought the place and decided where I was to put my writing desk. No one was surprised when I agreed.
Watson mutters, "Madman," and slips his hand down to cover my prick. I gasp, pushing up against the touch.
We had a first-class carriage to ourselves on the way home, but rather than sit across from me as he usually did, Holmes sat beside me. He made no mention of this change in behavior, nor did he seem self-conscious about it at all. He simply settled in, his elbow and thigh against mine, and read the afternoon paper he'd picked up in the station. As we rattled along in relative silence, these points of contact between us made it impossible for me to focus on the book I'd packed in my valise. I put it away and took up staring out the window instead, watching the landscape rumble by.
“Insatiable,” he said, crossing the distance between the bench and the bed in barely a step, crawling onto the blankets and pinning me beneath them. He bent to kiss me, and the smell of his soap up close made me hum with pleasure. His lips were soft and warm, and I cupped his smooth face in my hand and rubbed my thumb against the corner of his neat moustache.
"John Watson!" Mike said, reaching out and giving John's hand a friendly shake that made John's teeth rattle. "How the hell are you?"
Watson and I looked at one another in surprise, and then he reached across Lestrade and slipped his warm hand into mine. "Who indeed?" he asked, gazing into my eyes.
My mouth still hurt from being punched, but I could have devoured Holmes on the spot. I wrapped my arms around him and pulled us even closer together, if such a thing were possible. He was hard in his trousers, and much the same could have been said for me. He groaned into my mouth, and pulled back again to run his hands through my hair and say, "I was starting to think I'd got the wrong impression."
"High time," Lestrade repeated, nodding to himself. "The two of you have been… why it's been ages in the making. How long have you known one another?"
John sat down at the table with the omelet. There was a mug of tea sitting there, steaming, with a pint of milk and a bag of sugar beside it. "Was that you playing, last night?"
John woke up in a bed that felt more familiar than it ought. The morning sun slanted across the floor, and he listened to a minute to the traffic on Baker Street. He remembered perfectly what had happened. His body was heavy and languid, satisfied, but his mind was filled with dismay. He shouldn't have done it. But Sherlock needed to be told! But Sherlock hadn't handled it well. Well, he'd handled it well
, I want them to come to be entertained, and impressed, and to be told how to enjoy what's in front of them." He was flushed with emotion now, the colour rising in his face and his eyes blazing. "I'm not interested in who wants fish and who wants chicken and who can't eat celeriac; I'm interested in tricking them into thinking they’re about to eat eggs when really they're putting mango into their mouths."
"I'm hideously out of practice," John said. "I feel like I've run a marathon without doing any training."
as well, even if he did take up with Sherlock's mad restaurant idea. Sure, his flat was small and rubbish, and the kitchen could hardly be called a kitchen, and if he wanted to he could take a shower while sitting on the toilet, and the whole place smelled like mould… John had lost the thread of his argument with himself. The water boiled.
Sherlock sighed as if he had been greatly put-upon and said, "I was getting our front-of-house manager."
"Sure," John said, nudging Sherlock out of the way gently with a hand on his hip, only realising what he'd done when Sherlock shied away from the touch and turned his back on the reviewer.
John picked it up between forefinger and thumb, smelled it, and then sucked it into his mouth. It dissolved on his tongue, the tomato soup sensation and flavour striking him all at once.
My cock sprang up stiff and eager in my hand, and I stroked it slowly as I read; rather, I held my hand almost still and pushed my hips up into my grip, as if I were the one fucking the narrator. Or Watson. I wasn’t choosy in my fantasy.
He broke the kiss to move my hand for me, replacing it on his right breast and said, "Carry on, Watson."
He jerks me slowly while I writhe, and then lets go, pulling at my drawers instead. I struggle out of them and turn onto my back, where he can lean over me and kiss me. It feels real. It is real enough. I lick into his mouth and clutch at his shoulders. His mouth is wet and warm and eager, but he doesn't taste like Watson; he doesn't really taste like anything. He takes hold of my prick again and begins to stroke me off. My own eagerness slicks his grip. He rubs his thumb around my tender tip, teasing the foreskin back and rubbing my slit. Then he slides down again, forefinger and thumb circled around the root of my cock, to rub and squeeze my bollocks as they pull tight against my body. I'm squirming, heels digging into the bed, panting helplessly into his mouth.
"Watson, while your concern is most generous, it is entirely misdirected." He glared into the fire and hugged his arm across his chest more tightly. The cough resurfaced.
"I just want to try," I said. "We don't have to do it again if you don't like the result." I was pleading; I could hear it in my own voice.
"At least let me pay for the services you have provided me," I said, fishing in my pockets. He sighed and huffed, but when I produced a guinea he did not turn it down. "You are quite invaluable," I said. "Your usefulness to me cannot be overstated."
The vicar looked around, as if concerned he was being watched, but as far as I could tell– through almost a whole bottle of wine to myself a quite a bit of brandy– there was no one else inside. "Well, we usually don't perform weddings after about half-past-three in the afternoon, and it is… quite gone eight."
I embraced him, holding him as closely as the laws of nature would allow. I pressed my cheek to his hair. He murmured something into the skin of my shoulder.
He finished, wiped his mouth and cheeks, and offered me the seat. I sat, facing the mirror. He stood behind me, and his hands came down heavy on my shoulders. He bent to kiss the top of my head. I relaxed back against his middle, peering upside-down at his smiling face. He was slightly flushed from the warm water and the abrasion. He kissed my mouth and said, "Now, I'm not very practised at doing this for other people."
He waved me away. I left him prone on the bed we'd shared–as innocently as two bachelors could, though in all particulars neither of us were a bachelor any longer–and went downstairs.
you, I just want– Your company is quite agreeable to me. I find you are quite essential to my work."
"Call him." John slid off the stool. "And the next time I come over here for a chat, I expect there to be something outrageous and made of jelly waiting for me to try."
Sherlock was more embarrassed than he thought he would be. Now that John was here, Toby's enthusiastic greeting seemed like proof of Sherlock's incompetence as a dog owner and a mark against Toby himself.
John's face goes dark and cold, the way it does when he's aiming his gun at someone. His nostrils flare. He says, "I should move out because you're jealous I met someone?"
Right before noon, there's a knock on the outside doors. He's dozing on the couch, not a surprise considering his insomnia the night before. At least his headache is gone. This time it's Violet whose eager smiling face greets him when he pulls the door open.
Sherlock had grudgingly paid the astronomical fee of £3,000, but paid it all the same. It wasn’t the cost that bothered him. It was the idea that anyone would think that Toby was not already the most amazing, intelligent, brilliant, talented dog in all the world, especially after he proved it by helping Sherlock solve a kidnapping. In fact, Toby had been significantly more helpful on that case than most of the officers assigned to it, but Sherlock wisely kept those feelings to himself.
He has the sudden feeling he's being marched to his doom. He sees Mycroft, which fills him with relief (possibly the only time it will do so); a beautiful redhead who must be the older sister as she looks just like Sherlock except with Mycroft's auburn hair and turned up nose; an elderly couple who must be their parents—the woman's eyes are the exact shade of Sherlock's and it's obvious Sherlock gets his cheekbones from his father.
. When I have you restrained and laid out in a minute, I'll start with quick snaps—" I flicked my wrist and the flapper thwacked his shoulder, "—like that."
She looks back at John with a wide-eyed deviousness that suggests her words are less a rebuke of her sister than part of a script she and Eurus have written together. John gawps at them and, with an aching fondness, thinks about how very much like Sherlock they are.
? Why? What's going on Sherlock?" John looked up at the flat, waiting for some unknown threat to come flying down after Sherlock.
"Oh, god, yes, please, thank you!" I rasp desperately. "Please fuck me, please, John." I'm pushing back, using my body to beg for what I want, trying to swallow his fingers, to show that I'm
"John," Sherrinford says gently. "The two of you live together, work together, and are clearly the most important person in each other's life. If you're both attracted to each other and, and—
. My summer has started off with a barrage of doctors' visits and household projects and I haven't gotten much writing time. We're remodeling the upstairs floors and I had to displace my office and everything is now scattered in a heap of stuff pushed at the back of my bedroom and my laptop is back on the kitchen table, which I share with my very messy daughter. *sigh* Such is life.
"Now, Toby, Sherlock and I are going to sit on that sofa and I'm going to snog him senseless and I expect you to give us our privacy. No jumping up on the couch with us. Do you think you can do that, you sweet boy? I know you're happy he's home and I'm delighted to meet you, but come here—no, not for a kiss, I just want you to listen to me—" John's voice fell to a quiet murmur. "I've got a huge crush on your Sherlock, and if you and I are on our best behavior, I might get to have a bit more than a snog on the sofa, you know what I mean?"
"Anyway, he got a First in Chemistry and we thought that was the end of his troubles. Then he moved to London."
Sherlock's eyes dropped to the ground, and then, after a moment, he gave a small nod. Then he looked at John again, held his hand out between them, and softly asked, "Will you—I know this may sound silly, but would you be okay with maybe holding my hand? I just need—I know that when it's too much, if I could have your hand to squeeze—have solid proof that you're actually
"Thank you, John, thank you," Mycroft said, sounding so heartfelt and desperate, that John frowned and spared him another look. "My mother—
John took Sherlock's face in his hands and held his eyes. "Let's go back before we start worrying everyone, yeah?"
and didn't mean anything." Again, silence. John watches Sherlock and waits, throat pinching in sympathy. Sherlock sighs and rubs his eyes tiredly. "The sad truth is that it still hurts. Nearly two decades later, I can still remember exactly what it felt like
John sat as stunned as if a hand had materialized out of thin air and slapped him in the face before disappearing again. "What?" he croaked.
"Looks like it might rain," Will says as all seven of them crunch along the driveway and out to the road that leads into the village.
