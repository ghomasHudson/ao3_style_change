And that takes Tony back to a different time, far more effectively than their pillow fight had. He flops down onto the bed and chances a glance at Steve. “I have a confession.”
“Oh, yeah, that.” Steve’s half-naked in front of him and Tony’s brain can’t think of a smoother way to say,
Tony reflexively keeps talking, hoping to reright the strange mood shift he’d prefer not to examine too closely. “The compound’s lonely.”
“Plus,” Tony adds when the sounds of sirens outside begins to feel a little ominous. “Pepper would really appreciate a full report on what your deltoids feel like.”
Tony gives himself only the amount of time it takes to drop the pizza boxes and cans onto the kitchen counter before he’s in front of Steve and pulling him closer for a kiss. He walks Steve forward until he’s crowding Steve against the kitchen sink, pushing closer against his body and winding his hands through Steve’s hair.
They both turn to look at each other, but Tony’s eyes don’t stay open long enough for it to mean anything. Sleep takes him before he can even tell Steve good night.
Tony pushes himself up to his knees so he has the freedom to switch the hand around Steve’s cock and use the newly available one to swat Steve’s arm away. “Relax, I got you.” So it turns out he’s going to have to use one of his tricks anyway. That’s good. He knows this one, and likes immediately how Steve responds when he presses his knuckle to the space between Steve’s balls and his asshole so that he can apply pressure to his prostate. Steve’s back arches at the touch, and that adds even more force between Tony and Steve. “Is that good?” Tony asks, legitimately needing to know this time.
Steve gets an odd look and for a second Tony thinks he’s going to ask for something really weird or just nope-out completely. It confuses Tony, because Steve’s got a hard-on to rival a porn star and an inability to keep his hands to himself. Even as Tony waits, Steve’s hands rub up-and-down his arms. “You can keep touching me,” Steve says, but he says it like a question, as if Tony’s going to turn down a handjob he was clearly excited to perform three minutes ago.
“This plan has a higher chance of success if you aren’t wearing Captain America cosplay.” Steve releases Tony’s wrists and lets him finish unzipping the jacket and unbuckling his utility belt, while keeping watch over Tony’s head. When Steve’s down to just the white sleeveless undershirt he keeps permanently glued to his body and the ill-fitting pants, Tony slips off anything that indicates he was trying to pretend he was a SHIELD agent more than forty years into the future and rolls it all into an odd shaped ball of clothes. “None of what we’re wearing is period appropriate--” he thinks that’s the case at least, he wasn’t really alive to know “--but we’re just going to have to own it. Uh...look like you belong.”
There was a twitch in Nathan’s lip that gave Tony the impression he was only a little bit impressed. “I
“That’s why I’m doing it half the time.” Steve reaches his apartment door, but he’s still only a few steps ahead of Tony. Tony counts that as a win. Also a win: Steve seems so flustered it takes him at least four tries to figure out the right key into his apartment. “Welcome,” he tells Tony when he finally opens the door.
Steve’s face doesn’t distract the rest of the group. Natasha takes the reins of the meeting. “Let’s take a few weeks to look into possible locations and convene after that.”
It’s strange, he hasn’t been expecting anything like this, and the wrongness of it sets off alarms far stronger than what he should expect. “Shut down the lab and close off network access,” he commands the computer systems. If it’s a virus, he needs to limit the chances that anyone else will be exposed.
His fingers covered mine where I was gingerly tracing the edges of the wound. “It’s already healing. I’m going to be fine.” His face was pale and his breathing was shallow, but he was right about the wound. It already was healing. “I just need to rest for a little bit and get my strength up.”
“We could try?” Tony offers and he holds out his hand. “I’m Tony Stark, the genius billionaire playboy philanthropist. You may know me as Iron Man, or have seen me in the 2006 sex tape my publicist is still pretending is a fake.” He purposely goes broad and picks all the things he know Steve doesn’t care about.
“It’s going to be ok. You’re going to be ok,” I began to say, even though I was just sinking to my knees beside him to examine his injuries.
“I guess so.” The dresser bumps against the wall when he stands up. Tony’s eyes snap back to where he’s trying to do a halfway decent job sewing the patch on the coat. “You want some pizza?” he asks. “I’m starving, and I saw a place around the corner. I’ll pick it up.”
It’s the direction the night has been trending towards since Tony walked up the apartment steps, but it still catches him off guard for a second. “Yeah, definitely.” He leans over Steve—careful to not touch him—and picks up the condom. It rolls easy down Tony’s cock. And just because he knows Steve’s watching, he strokes himself with lube a few times. “Are you sure you can take it? Or would you like something a little...bigger?”
Steve kept smiling, light and with none of the lost-puppy look he wore so often since they found him in the ice. Post-battle was when he looked the most serene; Tony was going to bask until it dissipated into existential questioning. “Iron Man, has there been any more information regarding your employer? The news has been stipulating all sorts of crazy things.” Steve’s tone made it clear what he thought about modern journalistic standards.
This time, when Steve smiles, Tony can’t ignore the resemblance. “I didn’t think I’d be able to get in, honestly. I was sure you would have revoked my access credentials, but at least I’d have proof who I am when the alarms went off.”
Steve’s long legs help him catch up and when he does Tony has to quicken his pace to not fall behind.  “I think tonight we need to lay low and get our bearings. That means we need a place to stay. And money.” It may be 1970, but it’s still Manhattan.
Steve looked between the two and knew Tony was right. “I’m glad, I really am,” Steve said. He only wanted the best for his teammate. And the last ten minutes had been terrifying. “I’ll get going, check on the bees and stuff. Give you some time to recoup.”
Nathan nods. “I know. The timing wasn’t great, but the UN wasn’t going to reschedule a major vote just for Peggy.” He sat down on the couch by Tony’s desk. “And thank you for the flowers. They were beautiful.” The smile was back, but now it was sadder, less mischievous, so...familiar.
“Good… that’s good,” Iron Man mumbled, his words sounding like static as the voice modulator began to work completely. He lifted his hand and made a weak ‘thumbs-up’ gesture. “I’m good.”
But Steve’s just sitting there, eating like New York City diners are time’s great constant, too busy devouring his burgers to even shrug off Tony’s compliment. “I’ve been trying to research what I can,” he says, and pulls out a couple of different newspapers, all in black and white, and all with headlines about the US Military. He then sets one in particular in front of Tony. There’s a large black and white photo of a young Hank Pym explaining something to a few soldiers. “This one mentions Camp Lehigh. It looks like SHIELD’s been busy.”
surprised, how comfortable those two were together.” He was jealous, but he doesn’t say that. It was a weird emotion then, and it’s weird now.
“Is that all?” King T’Challa asks. Him, Princess Shuri, and Okoye are participating via a secure satellite connection.
Morgan pushes herself away from the table and walks out of the camera’s sight. Pepper takes her seat. “How’re you doing?” she asks.
“I guess so. Mr. Banner is very much missed.” Tony shrugged. “But we’ve survived these months without his care and have been trying to find someone else to see to our medical needs.” He wasn’t sure why, but the man gave him an uneasy feeling. It wasn’t a
, is what he should say. He gets Steve’s instinct, at least. “Can I stay here, tonight?” he asks, instead. “I’m so tired.” He’s exhausted enough that he’s leaning into Steve, using his unmovable bulk to keep himself upright.
Tony pushes himself back from the desk and stumbles onto the floor. His head crashes into a steel workbench behind him, pain expands from the point of contact, hot and disorienting. Tony closes his eyes and reminds himself he hasn't learned a single new thing.
,” Tony shouts as he buries himself as deep as he can into Steve and comes. “Fuck,” he repeats when he’s finished riding it out. Pulling out sounds just
“What about your feelings for your late sheriff?” Doctor Strange asked, his voice perfectly casual even if the connotation was clear.
Tony looked around the hallway nervously, and then leaned in so that the Steve was almost nose to nose. “You took me to a bakery down the street of where you grew up on our first date because it had the best cookies you can remember.” The hologram smiled, sheepish, nervous, not like he was concerned he had the story wrong, but that he was worried someone would overhear.
“No, you don’t,” Steve says to himself, because this will destroy Tony, break him down into all component parts, and he’ll have to rebuild himself from scratch because of it. The things the man in front of him is going to do to forget the life he’s stuck in twist in Steve’s guts. “You don’t want to know any of what’s coming.”
It had at first been odd to look into the hologram’s eyes and also see the wall behind them, but now Steve only saw Tony. “I missed you too.” And boy, did it look like he meant it.
Tony wishes he stopped talking after the first sentence. Being naked was a good excuse to stay here. “Sure…” he mumbles and is punished for his practicality by Steve taking his warm body away from his skin. He should’ve kept his mouth shut.
The bathroom door opens, and Steve walks out, wearing a US Army uniform that serendipitously fits him to a T. “How do I look?” Steve asks, a tad smug.
There was a slight delay in Tony’s response, as if he, too, needed time to process what was going on. “The one and only.”
“Wait, no--” Tony begins to say when it becomes clear that they don’t have the sort of space to make that work, “Let me, I just need to…” and he kicks the rest of the blanket out from where it’s tucked under the mattress. The whole process involves moving a lot of limbs and leads to Tony kneeing Steve’s bare thighs a couple of times, but it finishes with both of them comfortable and warm, so Steve doesn’t complain.
“Not a lot of superheroes were out, back then,” Tony says. Steve hears what he doesn’t say, what he probably isn’t even thinking: there are a lot of superheroes who aren't out,
Same blue eyes, same square jaw, same look of determination on his face. This Steve was going to get what he wants. The only difference is that this Steve wants Tony to help him save the world, and that Steve wanted…
Steve doesn’t say anything to that. Tony wonders if the younger version of the man would have a reply, a quick rejoinder, something,
He could have spent weeks upon weeks testing, but Happy and Pepper and the public were growing more and more concerned by his disappearance. This was the best way to stave off their questions. Tony--the real one, the flesh and blood--would be Iron Man, and his hologram would be Tony Stark, the billionaire playboy funder of the Avengers.
The room is big, cavernous, and disturbingly empty. When he had arrived a few weeks ago to begin preparing for today, it had felt like going to summer camp. But right now he’s just incredibly alone in this room that’s not his own, surrounded by this team he had willfully stepped away from.
One step at a time, Tony walked closer to Steve, savoring how every footfall made more and more of his features clear. The sandiness of his hair, the jut of his chin, the color of his eyes--all of it was slowly revealed to Tony.
“Yeah, cool, good idea,” Tony mutters and attempts to steady his breathing. He tries to shut off his brain, because the rustling in the bathroom just tells him Steve’s taking off his clothes and the sound of water against the tile just conjures up images of water running down his naked body.
It’s the first night they’ve been able to take a breath. Tony had been in Queens with May and Peter, helping them with their own housing issues, when he got a group text from Steve reading,
“I don’t know what you want me to say. We’re going to visit the birthplace of Captain America tomorrow, and I’m having flashbacks to when you used to be my hero.”
Tony grumbled and unsteadily walked to the computer monitor on the far side of the room before pulling up the holographic keyboard in front of him. He couldn’t ignore the heavy disappointment sitting in his chest, taking up too much room next to his ruined heart. Spending time with Steve as Tony Stark was never going to be a good idea, but he was still touched that Steve didn’t know that yet, or that he wasn't curious why Steve had taken such a liking to him.
Tony doesn’t say shit. He scoots up a little when Steve dives into the pool and watches Steve’s expertly done backstroke. Steve’s fast in the water—that’s not a surprise—and he completes each lap effortlessly. Tony’s being creepy, he knows that, but it’s nice to watch him like this. Steve has a presence and ever since Tony returned to the compound to work on the Time Heist, he hasn’t gotten a chance to just observe Steve without feeling like he’s being observed in kind.
“Really, thanks,” Tony added, and he placed a blue hand that Steve couldn’t feel on Steve’s shoulder. “Iron Man wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you.”
He turns to leave but Steve grabs him by the shoulder. “It’s fine. I wasn’t going to sleep. What do you want?”
Tony glares at the hologram in front of him. Good ol’ persistent Steve. “Where is he?” Tony asks and closes up what he’s working on. He takes a couple of deep breaths and reminds himself that this is
Tony lets out a long breath. It’s an answer to the question that’s been hanging over Tony’s head. What they have is enough. It has to be. “Me, too. It’s great.” The edge of Steve’s lips turn up a bit, the same soft smile he gave Tony when Tony told him about the Time GPS.
. Steve seems to have a throw-everything-at-the-wall approach to blowjobs because Tony’s getting an appetizer sampler of techniques. This includes licking a long, wet strip along Tony’s shaft, pressing light kisses at the head, bobbing up and down like a Hoover, and even taking Tony’s cock so far down his throat that his nose hits the dark curls at the base. Uh,
“We all agree, then?” Natasha asks the room. Everyone—whether they are in the hotel conference room or participating via hologram or video screen—nods.
“Can we get to the point of the matter?” Tony asked as he poured himself more tea. “It’s always lovely to stop by and visit you--” He looked across the table at Wong, who gave him a subtle smile in return. “--But I’m not sure why I’m here.”
It’s not that Steve doesn’t understand what Tony’s asking for. He does. He wants it, too. “You’re right,” he says, thinking about all the ways he isn’t. Not with this. “We should talk about it. Later. I think I’m going to call it a night.” He steps away and doesn’t look back at the party still happening behind him. It’s a little early to leave, but he doesn’t fit among the young people dancing in the center of the room.
One nod of Steve’s head is all Tony gets for that amazing discovery. He has the fucking gall to look sheepish.
“I’m saying this because you asked for honesty. I resent that you were able to forget how much it hurt. Now--don’t get me wrong--I’m glad I can remember it even if you can’t. I’ll always choose to have my memories. No matter what.” Steve pauses and looks out the window again. He wants to leave that rock unturned at the moment. “I guess it’s just hard to move on from something when we can’t agree what we’re moving on from.”
Maybe there’s too much friction. Tony stops his hand long enough to like a long, wide stripe across his palm. He takes the time to suck each finger while he’s at it, anything to offer some relief to Steve. Steve doesn’t hide his fascination with Tony’s actions. “Is that good?” he asks once his hand’s back to its place around Steve’s cock. Steve moans and moves his hips in a rhythm opposite Tony’s like he could speed up the whole process through an effective abdominal workout. It’s mesmerizing. Definitely worth the sore wrist Tony’s beginning to develop. “You like that, don’t you? Well, I like watching you, seeing how bad you want it. I thought nothing could be hotter than watching you on your knees swallowing my come, but no, this is better.”
“I do,” Tony responds in the smallest voice Steve knows he has. He wraps his arms around himself, and he looks small, too. “I never meant to hurt you. I need you to know that.”
“Good,” Steve agrees. He pulls out a key from his pocket, slides it across the table, and motions to the waitress on the other side of the diner. “Could I borrow a pen?” he asks her as she approaches. Seamlessly, she hands one off to him, as well as a handwritten check, and doesn’t wait for Steve to scribble something down on a scrap of newspaper. “This is where we’re staying. Let’s split up, pick up what we need, and meet there tonight.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, sounding less confident than he wants to. There is a line, a very fine, nebulous, and complicated line he’s been tiptoeing around, and it’s far easier to strike the necessary balance when he isn’t staring straight at it. “It’s just cuddling.” And Tony might touch people, and flirts all the time with others, but he always respects Pepper’s clear boundaries.
“Play it back,” Tony said as he watched the blue glowing copy of himself in front of him. The hologram was slightly transparent, like the proprietary tech Tony had been developing for his communication devices. It looked just like him if he had been wearing a simple white t-shirt instead of being trapped in his armor.
Steve crosses his arms and it appears like it grows six inches taller. “You don’t look like you’re enjoying yourself, and I’m beginning to think it’s personal.”
“We’re going to need disguises and some identification. And--” He flashes a look at the street signs at the intersection as they quickly cross the street. “--And a ride to Camp Lehigh. You couldn't have gotten us any closer?” His tone of voice holds all the Captain America energy he’s currently repressing.
“I’m flattered, I really am.” Tony doesn’t feel flattered. He’s looking at a spot on the ceiling, trying to focus on whether that crack he sees is a sign Avenger’s Mountain has structural deficiencies, and successfully avoids Steve’s eyes. “And a part of me wishes I could fight by your side again.” His eyes move to the floor, and then the walls, momentarily darting to look at Steve’s face. “I’m sorry.”
this, and Tony wants to give it to him. “I want to make you come as hard as you made me come. What can I do?”
It catches Steve off guard and puts a smile across his lips. “Let’s just see, old man.” He one-handedly catches Tony across the chest.
“I don’t have a lot of experience, but I guess I'd like to bottom,” Steve responds, like he’s as nervous as Tony. “but if it’s a—”
When he had considered all of the possible problems that could arise from this plan, he hadn’t thought that one of them could be Steve being suspicious. Tony had gotten so used to Steve’s earnest acceptance of the future that he had forgotten that the man had enough bad experiences to not take everything at face value. Even right now, Tony was sure Steve was going to look more into his disappearance and the source of the hologram, and that was definitely a problem.
He takes a walk to the communal kitchen with the excuse of getting a glass of water, but really because he wanted to see if the rest of the team was following Rhodey’s orders. It’s mostly quiet and dark and nothing like yesterday night when he walked through these halls thinking of possibilities and not the new hole in his life. An uncharitable thought jumps into his head as he searches for a cup in the cupboard: if Natasha, Steve, and Scott hadn’t convinced him to join their hairbrained scheme, she’d be here right now.
“And apparently the reason why you’re here, and not, you know, in the future, is because of an invention I created, right?” Tony’s having the strangest sense of deja vu right now. “Because apparently, in the future, we know each other well enough that you’d have access to my tech. Unless you stole it, of course.” Nathan’s doing that same eye-squinting thing Steve used to do when he was listening to you but was also too polite to insert anything to the conversation. That thing that used to either comfort Tony or infuriate him. “Which, if I’m going to believe you’re also the superhero who captured Arnim Zola in the 50’s, doesn’t seem likely.” And then, all at once, Tony connects the familiar cut of Nathan’s jaw to his birth year. “Steve?”
Stark Unlimited takes up most of his time after that, and only kind of on purpose. Tony’s become the master of building and rebuilding his companies into bigger and better and more brilliant things, and Stark Unlimited is going to be his masterpiece.
They did it. They all managed to manipulate the Gauntlet together and end Thanos. And that was after Bruce was able to bring back everyone Thanos had snapped away.
“Wow, Cap, what a lucky catch!” Tony shouted over the din of curious onlookers who were beginning to crowd them as the battle wound down. Hank had captured the last of the Masters of Evil a block away, and over by them, Janet had managed to tie up the Melter and Radioactive Man just fine while they waited for the police to take them.
“Uh…” Steve begins. Tony looks up to see him wearing a towel around his waist. Water drips down his skin and the blush spreads down his neck to his chest. “Does it matter?”
because Tony hated the idea that his teammates would move into empty rooms while he was building the compound. Steve’s neat, no surprise, and except for a pair of jeans folded across an arm chair waiting to be reworn, notes on his desk, and a cup turned upside down on the kitchenette's drying rack, there isn’t much of a sense he actually
“No,” Steve responded reflexively. He had begun to come around the possibility that the hologram was Tony Stark, but not completely. Not enough to leave his teammate alone. “I’m going to stay here.
Every single one, the damn traitors, respond affirmatively. Soon after, they file out of the room. Tony can sense Steve’s trying to meet his eyes as he stands up, but Tony ignores him. He’s too angry to focus on anything.
“Tony, you know it would mean the world to me to have you on the team,” Steve pleads, looking as if he’s seconds away from dropping to his knees.
“Yeah,” Tony says. He keeps his eyes glued to Steve as his shorts hit the floor and his hard dick feels fresh air. Steve’s got this wide-eyed fuck-yeah look as he takes an appreciative view of Tony’s body. It’s the opposite of suave, but Tony likes it anyway. He’ll take Steve’s awkward gaping over cool detached confidence any day.
“Who’re you?” Tony asks. “And why’re you here?” He should probably lower his arm, while he’s at it, but how’s he supposed to trust a guy that was able to get into the compound without triggering any alarms?
jumps, that’s not a lot of room for error.” Tony takes a deep breath and tries to explain. “I’m assuming first he goes to 1970, then 2012, then 2013, then 2014, and…” he trails off as the idea that’s been nibbling at his brain begins to come together.
He excuses himself to the workshop, feeling more motivated to solve the problem in front of him than he’s been since the day Steve arrived.
It was Tony’s opportunity to squint at him, confused and disoriented. “You cannot mean….” He trailed off without a way to finish.
That emboldens Tony to keep talking. “And I got this twinge in my back. Luckily for me, I had the foresight to include a hot tub in the compound. Somehow I’ve never used it in the last ten years.”
Steve heard a knock at the door and looked up from where he was examining a bruise under his eye in the mirror. It had already been a long day fighting and his head was still throbbing from an especially well landed punch. He hadn't even had time to get out of his Captain America regalia. “One second,” he responded. Steve opened the door just enough that he could slip his head outside. By now he’d thought there was nothing that could surprise him, yet he was looking at a blue and translucent Tony Stark. “Tony?” he asked confused and incredibly worried something ever more serious had happened.
, Tony told himself. “Let me humor you. If I freely give up my ability to lie, you’ll bring Steve back. How?”
The syringe rests on the new workshop desk, right next to Tony’s phone and his Avengers ID. It’s filled with nanobots especially made to eliminate any memories Tony has had since the battle with Carol and his coma.
“We could’ve done a lot of things.” Tony shrugs and slowly walks backward, trying to guide Steve from where he’s rooted to the sidewalk. “So, I double checked, and made sure that alley was older than you.”
“Good,” Steve replies and keeps his eyes off Tony’s rumpled tux. They share the quiet room. It’s not comfortable for Steve, he’s itching to say something or to leave, but he keeps waiting for Tony to start the battle. Except Tony doesn’t, so Steve digs in. “Do you really not remember any of it?”
“You know, I may have got that impression when I had your cock in my mouth,” Steve counters, pure exasperation in his voice. He reaches to grab the dildo away from Tony but Tony just holds it behind his back. “Tony, really, it’s not something you need to be concerned about. I’m not some sort of size queen or anything. Your dick is exactly what I want.”
, Tony is now very aware it’s been awhile since that time they fucked. So much happened that that fact had been relegated to somewhere in the back of his mind.
Steve shoots him a look. In another lifetime--or nine years ago--the look would have made Tony feel like he did something wrong; maybe back then it was supposed to. It doesn’t do that to Tony anymore. He sees an open ended question in Steve’s eyes, not judgement.  “And how did you know that alley was going to be available?”
At least, until the spell breaks. “Steve Rogers is here to see you,” FRIDAY announces, walking in and lighting up the room with a calming pink glow.
“Iron Man trusts m--” it began to say, but then it futzed, blurred, cut out like the picture of an old television before returning back to where he used to stand. “We need to help him, right now.” It was scared, Steve could see it now. It’s voice shook and warbled. Something was very, very wrong.
The intruder doesn’t shout ‘don’t shoot’. He doesn’t do much of anything except hold his hands up in the air.
A brutal silence follows. Tony fights with the impulse to deny whatever Steve’s thinking before he even says it, because anything he says in acknowledgement would just be confirmation.
--worn out by the trifecta of running a global corporation, avenging, and maintaining a secret identity. It was just too much.
I stood up and watch as the man--or most likely a man with those shoulders--slowly approached, the setting sun lighting him from behind and leaving him as only a dark silhouette. There was something off about his gait and the way he was holding his arm. He appeared to be injured and losing the struggle to stay upright fast.
Tony doesn’t suppress the desire to internally gloat. Steve’s looking at him like Tony just helped him find the light. Tony bends over the bed to pick up his robe and uses it to gently wipe off the come across Steve’s abs before throwing back on the floor. “Was that good?” he asks as he lays his body against Steve’s. He has no doubt what the answer will be, he’s just searching for praise.
Somehow, though, it breaks through to Tony what that could be. He turns around and pulls Steve into a big hug. Steve’s a good hugger, he brings Tony in closer than he already was and drops his head to Tony’s shoulder. He doesn’t hug like the rest of the big men Tony knows. It doesn’t feel like a display of strength. Instead, Tony would describe it like Steve is trying to burrow into Tony’s body and find comfort in being close.
“Did you see this view?” Steve gestures to the wall of glass separating the party from an infinite number of stars.
“Looks like it.” There was a sticky-wet spot on the front of his black turtleneck. “Is that blood?” I asked, and didn’t wait for a response before I began to tug up the wool sweater. “Not trying to feel you up, I promise,” I whispered, trying to deflect my own nerves as I discovered a gash covered in dried blood right above Steve’s belly button.
Tony decides against making a joke about Steve’s age. It would just prolong the conversation. “Ok, I’ll leave you to it, then. I’ll be in the workshop, if you need me.”
,” were the only two words that drifted out of the face plate, but Steve knew what they meant. He lifted Iron Man’s prone form into his arms. The suit was heavy and bulky, and its sharp edges dug into the fabric of the Captain America uniform, yet Steve trudged on. It was slow going across the street to the mansion as Steve was worried any quick movements would do more harm than good, and it was with great trepidation Steve opened the front door and brought him inside. He did all of it without thinking of the criminals across the street. It was just bees. It could wait.
Tony takes a long drink of the stupid glass of water he’s still holding. And because he can’t stop trying to top his own awfulness, he says, “This isn’t a booty call, by the way. I didn’t come here to sleep with you.” Tonight would be going better if Tony joined Thor’s drinking party.
His mind shuts down slowly, as if a power outage is slowly spreading across his brain, cell by cell, block by block, and when it’s all gone, he’ll be able to forget everything.
Tony tries to hit him back, but the time Steve deflects. Feathers fly across the room, falling like snow lit from the city lights outside, and Tony staggers up and onto his feet so that he’s standing on the bed.
“What can’t you do?” Steve asks and the words catch in his throat because he knows when Tony isn’t going to back down.
Tony took a deep breath in and picked up his hat from where it was sitting on the table. “Thank you,” he said, to both of them, too overwhelmed to think much about it. His thoughts were telling him to
“With pleasure,” Tony responds with a smirk. He rolls to the side of Steve so he can prop himself on his elbow and traces a line from the hollow of Steve’s collarbone to the tip of his cock, laying heavy on his stomach. Post-orgasm exhaustion is beginning to seep into his body as he finally feels the last few weeks of late nights, but he vows to power through and deliver on his promise. “How’s that?” he asks as he skims the tip of his thumb along the uncut cockhead, moving the beads of precome that sit there across the foreskin.
“Oh.” Tony pauses for a second. “I knew about the pain thing, but I never thought…” he trails off while he sorts out this new information in his head. He remembers the first time they slept together. “That’s what the prostate fixation is all about.”
The room goes burning hot white and a force emitting from the Time Gem flings Steve back. He hits the wall so hard it cracks behind him, kicking up plaster dust and paint chips that fall around him like snow. It takes a full minute to settle, and Steve needs every bit of it to gain his footing. He brushes off the debris and steps forward and is only certain of one thing--he’s not anywhere he’s supposed to be.
. Or as slow as he can manage. Steve’s breathing in this controlled and forced way and Tony just focuses on that—not the instinct buried deep within him to snap his hips further.
“How did you convince Steve to not talk about work?” Sam has genuine awe in his voice. “I’ve been trying forever.”
Tony shakes it off. The man’s disarming, dangerously so, and Tony has had enough of that. And there is no way he’s as old as he says he is. “That wouldn’t make you eighty-eight in ninety-five.”
Tony freezes, he’d been expecting any question beside that one. His mouth opens, closes, opens again, and words never come out.
Steve knows the other side of anger now, knows what it’s like to hold Tony in his arms and to feel his skin against his. Tony doesn’t deserve the future he’s hurtling towards; he doesn’t deserve the Skrulls, or Osborn, or losing his memory--
Natasha’s quiet for more than a beat as she reaches the same conclusion Tony’s made. “You don’t think he’s going to come back, do you?”
Tony answered, “We like the excuse to indulge our morbid curiosity,” except he said it without meaning to; it just tumbled out of his mouth.
“I said you’re right, so just stand there and be right, ok?” Tony responds. He’s halfway through the sentence when he realizes that he’s now almost eye level with Steve’s junk.
Steve opens his mouth a couple times, but closes it soon after. He has a lot of responses to that question. Some are half-truths. Some are down-right lies. All he thinks will distract from what was real; all would save Tony from being burdened the way Steve has been since that time.
The hand around his wrist drops like Tony’s skin burns. “Oh god, no…” gasps the Supreme Leader, no… Steve. It’s Steve in front of him, a presence powerful and menacing.
And suddenly the mission report could wait. Tony had an idea. Or better yet, a new technology to try out.
Steve nods. “Ok, I’ll begin to formulate a strategy.” He doesn’t look surprised that no one disagrees with him, or even honored that the team thinks he’s the best for the gig. This is clearly what Steve was expecting would happen when he brought this up. “In the meantime we’re going to have to rebuild our time machine. Bruce and Tony, how long do you think that would take?”
A thought pops into Steve’s brain, small but loud, and it explains everything. “Was it something I did?” he asks, because he needs to know. If he knows, he can fix it.
Steve grinds his teeth and this further cements Tony’s discomfort with the whole affair. “Tony, I’ll be fine. I have a lot of time to prepare, and we already know what to expect.”
Tony’s turned around and almost out the door when he hears Steve behind him call, “Talk to you later!”
Steve lowers his head and Tony pushes up on his toes and then they’re kissing again. It’s much, much better the second time.
There are people watching them, so many people, and not a single one is going to stop him. Tony wants to run, hide, even fight. Anything to get away from him before he has a chance to overpower him. And he will. He always does.
“You look the part better than I imagined you would.” Not that Tony would really know; he’s still months away from actually being born and his only sense of the fashion from this period is what he’s seen in sitcoms he would watch years later. It's more that...Steve looks like he belongs much better than Tony feels. Tony settled for a simple t-shirt and jeans combination that’s almost impossible to be outdated, something classic, easy. But it doesn’t feel easy, his wandering eyes keep catching detail after detail, from color palettes to hairstyles to architecture. And then there’s the cars. There are
Barnes nods in agreement, but the rest of the group falls quiet. The five year gap difference in memories between Sam and Barnes and the rest of them feel obvious. Some of the time Tony forgets about it, how half the people in his orbit were gone for so long—and how they missed so much.
He’s not going to ask for confirmation that this theory is true. He’s not sure what he wants the answer to be. He does, however, have another question about the night before the Time Heist. “Why did you sleep with me the first time?”
Doctor Strange nodded and spoke unintelligibly for a couple minutes more. With finality, he closed the book and looked to Tony. “It is done.”
He gets a pillow across the thighs as a response and he falls to his knees, dangerously straddling Steve’s hips while holding his own pillow to the ceiling. Everything goes still and quiet, leaving nothing but the sounds of both of their heavy breathing and Tony’s heartbeats thrumming in his ears. The look on Steve’s face--eyes blown, mouth slack--fuck, if Tony had thought he’d been imagining the sexual tension, he knows he wasn’t anymore.
Maybe it’s the months it’s been since Tony’s been this close to someone or maybe it’s the way Steve’s settled into his mind like an old friend or maybe it’s the knowledge that he’ll never see Steve like this, Tony just doesn’t know, but he hugs back.
Tony sits up, even though he doesn’t want to, and waits for Steve to look through his drawers. While Steve does so, Tony’s free to look around the room and actually see it. This is the first time he’s been in here in what...seven years? It doesn’t look much different now. There’s the same Captain America-adjacent newspaper clippings on the walls. He knows they’re there because he put them there, and
Steve frowns, put off by Tony’s curt question, but then his shoulder square. Tony can see another question behind his eyes and now he’s wishing he had made an excuse to leave. “Actually, I was wondering if you’d like to grab dinner with me.”
“It’s a long story, and it’s been going on for a long time, but recently it’s gotten so bad that I need the power from the Iron Man armor to keep it working.”
, is absolutely what Tony doesn’t say. It’s disingenuous; in Tony’s detailed imagination Steve is a huge fucking fan of gay sex. It’s just that Steve almost always tops in that same imagination. The fantasies where he fucked Steve were the more transgressive ones because they couldn’t possibly happen. “I don’t know. You’re a big manly-man, I guess.” Tony will give himself away if he says more than that.
“I assume the internet was involved,” Tony says. The puzzle pieces are beginning to form a coherent picture. He adds, “But you don’t have a problem getting hard.”
Tony banged the back of his head repeatedly against the backrest of the chair. “Fuck, fuck, fuck,” he chanted as he tried to get a grip. He had to do something, and fast. His head was getting lighter, his heart beating with a little more effort, and he used his armored feet to push him and the chair near the electrical outlet that held his chest plate charging device. “Pull it back up,” he ordered the room with a long sigh as he plunged himself in into the wall and felt the familiar jolt as oxygen began to move faster through his veins.
Steve chuckles, but he reciprocates and shakes Tony's hand in a firm grip. “Steve Rogers. Made famous by history books and some popular memes, including ‘so, you got detention’.” Help-him-god, he perfectly pantomimes throwing his leg over the back of a chair and making
Steve opens the door wide enough for Tony to duck in and push the door closed behind him. This leaves Tony standing with his back against the door and Steve watching him. This must go on for a little too long because Steve speaks first. “What’s the question?”
“Sleep well,” Steve says. One side of his mouth quirks up in a smile for a brief second.  “See you in the morning.”
Steve turns around to see exactly who he expects. Tony’s in a dress shirt with his tie loose around his neck and his sharp patterned socks bright against the dark grey of his suit pants. Despite being immaculately groomed, he’s still never seemed to be so much of a wreck. It’s the bags under his red eyes that betray the nights he hasn't slept and Steve hates that he has any context for how close this is to Tony’s rock bottom.
Tony looks away and up at the dark sky like he can see the stars that will never shine above Brooklyn. There have been so many stories like this since they beat Thanos and brought back everyone who was snapped away. There have also been challenges, sure, but Tony can never get enough of hearing about experiences like these. Despite the housing shortages and pending dearth of food, everyone is just so fucking happy. The empty spaces Thanos had made aren’t empty anymore.
If it bothers Steve, he doesn’t do anything about it except pull a patch from his pocket and show Tony. “I got this for you.” It’s the SHIELD logo. “Found it in a bin at the surplus store, they’re probably not even sure what it’s for. Pym had one on his jacket in the picture, I figured it’d provide an extra layer of realism.”
all the time, but Steve breaks eye contact and looks to the rest of the group. “We’ll begin putting together some plans and provide everyone else with a firmer timeline at the next meeting. Is that good?”
“I’ll be fine, really,” Steve says directly at him. Tony wants to reach across the table and shake him, tell him not everything has to be fucking
“You caught me. You’re no longer my hero, just my friend.” Tony in no way means for that to sound as corny as it is, and his first, second, and third instincts are to lampshade the comment with a self-deprecating joke, but the joke never comes to his mind and the need to deflect ebbs away to the rhythm of Steve’s breathing.
Steve rolls on top of him, trapping him against the mattress and a mass of muscle. “Mmm...nice,” Tony mumbles while he takes his time exploring all that muscle with his hands. “I love your body. I haven’t spent enough time getting to know it.”
Tony takes a deep breath and stuffs his hands deep into his pockets. “When will be the right time? It’s been
Iron Man was still, and if he was breathing, it was undetectable under the metal. Without thinking, Steve looked for latches or releases, anything he could use to tear the armor from him and help the man underneath. He was sure he found something on Iron Man’s left flank when a cold gauntlet held his wrist and kept him from doing more to open it. “No, please, no,” Steve heard, the voice so soft and odd sounding he didn’t immediately register that it belonged to Iron Man. “I’m… fine, I’ll be, I mean…” Iron Man’s voice sounded drained, barely there, like something was wrong with the way he was breathing. “Just need... uh… please…”
Steve looked around and saw it in the corner. He nodded, and picked it up. The end not plugged into the wall was oddly shaped.
“No, I don’t. Everything between Extremis and Osborn is gone.” Tony regards him. Steve sees it from the corner of his eye. “You know that.”
“Maybe, with T’Challa’s blessing,” Tony replies. Steve picks it up, and Tony doesn’t need to hear the question before he pulls out the portfolio bag he’s been storing the shield in. “Who’s it for?” he asks as Steve slips it in. It’s certainly not for this Steve.
“See you later!” Tony calls to the rest of the group. They’re already walking to their respective vehicles and don’t seem to care that Tony’s entering Steve's building.
Tony opens his mouth to say something about the obviousness of the choice, but his brain gets caught on one specific detail. “
“I imagine he’s waking up somewhere nearby and is very confused. You should go to him.” He said it with a sense of kindness Tony never expected to hear from the man.
“Plug--right--re.” A blue finger pointed at a latch on Iron Man’s chest. Steve disconnected it only to find what looked like an outlet behind it. He looked again at the hologram, scared he was going to electrocute Iron Man, but it was slowly fading out until Steve could see nothing. There was something ominous in how it fell silent and disappeared into the air, something so incredibly creepy and wrong, that time expanded. Steve needed to do something, he needed to fix this situation, he
“It’s fine. Really. I wouldn’t have trusted me either.” Steve felt another pang of guilt at Tony’s words. The man didn’t deserve to feel that way.
“No, no, no.” Tony flops into a chair next to Steve. “I think Thor fell off a table as I was leaving, but everything sounded fine.”
exactly they’ll be building them will probably cause more discord among the group, but they’re not there yet. Tony has the impression that Natasha is purposefully going slow on this project to avoid the loss of goodwill the newly formed group had been building since the universe had been restored.
Tony scowls and counters, “That’s an awful idea.” He rubs the heels of his hands into his eyes, some misguided attempt to make Steve disappear.
Tony assumed the ‘good friend’ was the strangely-attired man sitting with them. He had never met him before, but all of Timely had been talking about the new stranger since he entered the town yesterday. After a full twenty-four hours of gossip, Tony felt like he already knew the man. “You look like someone that’s seen the world. How did Wong lure you into this two-horse town?”
knew. There was no reason this man shouldn’t either. “No one told me about your past struggles,” Doctor Strange said as if he could read Tony’s mind.
Silence settles over the group. They’ve been working since the battle with Thanos ended. Steve and a group are working on building temporary shelters for everyone who came back without a home. Tony’s been coordinating with Wakanda on ways to speed up food production and transportation. Rhodey’s communicating with the US government, and Natasha’s taken over the duties of dealing with the rest of the world. Everyone else has found their niche—Thor, Carol, and the Guardians in space, the rest of the Avengers close to home.
“Yes, exactly,” Nathan responds and he has to swallow around the words. “I know we’ve never met, but--”
He’s grown slower over the last few months. It’s strange, watching him age and coming to understand what’s going to happen.
By this point he's standing at the edge of the hot tub. Tony has to crank his head up to look at him, and the combination of the angle and the light from outside draws attention right to the center of his swimwear.
“Even better. I haven’t been much of a doctor since I hurt my hands.” The man raised his gnarled fingers up for Tony to see how they tremmored at being held aloft. “But I have other skills.”
“Being stuck in an eternal dreamscape really makes you think about your priorities, and…” Steve continues to say when Tony remains quiet. “I really miss you. And I missed you before, when we were fighting, and it’s time, I guess, to say that out loud.”
“Doctor Strange, huh?” Tony avoided the impulse to huff. “What a name. You’ll fit in great in Timely. And what exactly are your skills?”
Tony glows under the praise. It ripples on his skin and amplifies that overpowering feeling of pleasure that's radiating from his dick. Steve’s so tight—it’s possible he's clenching and trying to make it even tighter—and the pressure rolls up and down Tony’s cock. “Are you going to come for me?” Tony asks. He regrets it immediately on the grounds he’s tempting fate.
“There’s nothing they could have done.” He closes his eyes, takes a couple of breaths, and starts again. “It’s really not something to worry about. I just figured you should know in case it’s a problem. I don’t want you to think you did anything wrong.”
Steve frowns. Tony had hoped that ‘fine’ sounded less like he was blowing Steve off, but clearly it doesn’t. “Should’ve just gone to that pizza place down by the mansion, the one where--”
Pepper doesn’t say ‘I hope’ even though Tony knows she wants to. She waves the webcam off instead and Tony’s left looking at the wall of his room in the compound.
With a deep breath he injects the nanobots before throwing the syringe in the workshop’s incinerator and calling for the suit. It envelops him, every piece clicks into place with finality.
Steve shifts. It puts more than a few extra inches between him and Tony and gives Tony the impression something’s being taken away from him. “I understand if it’s a problem. Like I said before, I just don’t want you to think it’s because of you if I can’t...in the future. It isn’t.”
Rocket is the first to step away from the group. Without looking back, he’s making a beeline to Quill and Groot. Tony watches him walk away with a sense of finality.
The problem was Steve wanted to. Over the last week he found that his missed Tony more than he could have ever expected. The suave billionaire was somehow one of his closest friends, and then there was the maybe-sorta-could-be-a-thing between them where somehow Tony Stark was romantically interested in him.
he tells himself while he forcefully moves his eyes upward. All the damp muscle between Steve’s swimsuit and his face is quite nice, but Tony’s a good boy and he tries hard to keep his gaze from drifting south of Steve’s neck.
Steve grimaces. “When you say ‘I wish I could fight by your side again,’ did you mean with the Avengers, or with me?”
Tony gulps, clutches onto the fabric of his dress pants, and keeps his eyes focused on something just past Steve’s head. “I don’t know why you’d think that…”
Pepper chuckles, but doesn’t look like she finds it funny. “Please give everybody my condolences. Bruce, Clint, Thor, and...Steve. I know they were close.” She even says Steve’s name without venom, that’s a first in the last seven years.
“But...I thought…the coma...” Now it’s Steve that can’t look at Tony, Tony who can’t look away. “I thought you were the only one he didn’t hurt.”
, Tony thinks when the words won’t come, and he leans forward enough that his lips land against Steve’s.
“Are you sure?” Steve’s voice breaks as he says it; he must want this so bad. After everything he’s been through, after what had to be a massive blow to his self-image, the idea of something as immutable as Avenging must be very appealing. “Please? I’ll beg if I need to.” Steve chuckles nervously.
“I have no idea where you’re getting this bullshit.” He takes a deep breath and crosses his arms. There has to be a way out of this question he has no idea how to answer. “And I don’t see how it’s relevant.”
“It’s been, what, three weeks since we started this time travel thing?” Tony thinks about the last night he spent at the lakehouse with Pepper.
“Spoons of all sizes slot together. Size doesn’t matter,” Steve explains, like he’s reading aloud a mission report.
still shows enough. Tony knows he should probably make some noise or splash around a little. That would be the honorable, above-board thing to do, at least.
Tony laughs. Steve’s sure that Tony has no idea what he’s thinking about. “Though I have to say--I feel really old right now. Kinda feels like my kids are all grown up,” Tony says. Steve knows he’s not imagining the emotion in his voice.
It was as if the world stopped. The wind stopped blowing and the crickets stopped chirping. Tony forgot there was a horse underneath him, and that there was dirt underneath that horse, and anything underneath that. He watched Steve’s face and waited for him to move his eyes just enough so that Steve can see him.  “Steve....” he prompted when Steve doesn’t.
“That’s the past though. I’m talking about time travel--not what has happened, but what’s going to happen.” Nathan’s holding his breath, possibly waiting for Tony to call him on his bullshit.
Tony nods his head and watches as Steve licks his lips and takes Tony into his mouth. His cheeks have gone slack, and in place of the vacuum-like pressure from before, Tony only feels wet warmth. “Just like that,” he says. Steve catches his eyes and holds the gaze as he slowly slides his lips up and down. “That’s so good.”
Then, they just...talk. They talk about their favorite pizza places that closed after the snap and Morgan and Steve’s support groups and helpful modifications they could make to the compound. They talk until the pizza box has been moved to the dresser and they’re brushing their teeth with the same travel sized toothbrush they bought from Duane Reade.
One and a half of the gym’s walls are made of glass, and it’s the gentle moonlight that makes it possible to see the edges of Steve’s muscle as he stretches. He’s wearing one of those tight swimshorts Olympic swimmers use. It’s not quite a Speedo, but
“No,” Doctor Strange replied, and shook his head. He turned to Wong to tell him, “Why do people always think that?” Wong only smiled and poured himself more tea.
“There you are!” Tony says. Steve turns from the window to see Tony walking his way. “I was looking for you.”
Tony’s gaze on his skin is a heavy thing and Steve has to really try to keep his eyes forward. “I’ve seen all these newspaper clippings and videos from back then. And all I can do is place my thoughts on top of the things I know I did but can’t remember. There’s so much dissonance there, so many things I keep thinking ‘why the hell did you do that?’. But I have to trust I was doing what I thought was best.” Tony’s eyes fall to his lap with a sigh. “Even if I wish what I did was different.”
He saw Steve’s head turn towards him out of his peripheral vision. “What did you say?” Steve asked, as if the wind on the dirt had spoken and not Tony.
home, wherever that was and he berated himself for not having anything planned for an emergency like this. Anonymity had made sense before this, when Iron Man had seemed so invincible. Now? Not so much.
He’s been in the hot tub so long that the water is making Tony woozy when Steve pushes himself out of the pool. Tony begins to drop back into the water to evade detection, but he must have succeeded the first time out of pure luck because Steve either sees or hears him right away. “Tony?” he says. He’s shocked-confused, not shocked-angry. Somehow Tony was able to evade his super soldier senses and it's unnerving him.
“We’re moving the workshop. Initiate a complete tear down and move the essentials to current axillary room 28.”
Tony gapes back. “I’m going to make you pay,” he confidently declares, and smacks Steve with a dramatic upswing of his pillow.
“Yeah, I do.” He wishes it was otherwise. “I think about it. Sometimes not much, but sometimes...a lot. Especially since Hydra. I was so angry while we were fighting. I kept telling myself I didn’t hate you, but I felt it--the anger, the hate--when we fought. I didn’t like it. I
>>If everything went according to plan, you won’t remember me doing it, though. And for that, I’m sorry.
Tony settles close to Steve. Not close enough to be pressed next to him, but close enough that his skin gently brushes against Steve’s. Tony’s going to have to schedule more early meetings in the city if he’s going to keep this fuckbuddy thing—
“It’ll be faster when I’m done with it.” Tony shifts in the bed, trying to find a spot that’s comfortable between all the wayward springs.
Steve grits his teeth. Tony had once told him about these Extremis-induced hallucinations while they had been laying in the safety of their bed. Steve had held him close while he listened to the perverted way Tony’s brain found to haunt him. Steve wants to do that now, but he can’t. He’s powerless, at the mercy of time and circumstance and the whim of an infinity gem.
They stand there in silence while the party continues on behind them. There’s music and dancing and all forms of interstellar alcohol flowing. It’s by every metric a celebration.
Tony had been prepared for the worst when he agreed to support the SHRA, but nothing could have prepared to him for what it’s like to sit next to Steve’s bloody, dirty,
“Clearly, we fix it, because you’re here. Unless I invented time travel just to get you out of my hair, which, yeah, actually maybe happened. Is that it?”
“I am a master of the mystical arts.” Doctor Strange somehow managed to say that with a straight face.
“In the groups I run, we talk a lot about taking it ‘one day at a time’. You just got to wake up and live the moment in front of you,” Steve explains and Tony doesn’t have to look at him to see him to know he’s staring nowhere in particular. “Doesn’t matter
“Don’t think I don’t notice the past tense in that sentence,” Steve says in faked anger. Tony can’t see his face, but it sure sounds like he’s smiling.
Steve must sense that. “It’s nothing,” he says, and he rolls over so that he’s facing the wall and away from Tony. “Just agreeing. This is nice.”
Steve nods in agreement. “I don’t want you to put your clothes back on.” He looks down Tony’s body in a way that less sex and more cherishing. “But you’re welcome to any of my clothes.”
Steve was looking right at him and Tony found he couldn’t wretch his eyes from Steve’s. It didn’t matter that it was dark--they called to him. “How?” Steve asked.
Tony thought about walking to Steve’s bedroom door, and the hologram walked out of the room. He followed the video feed that was working as Tony’s eyes as it turned the corner and crossed the (too short) distance between where the two of them lived.
“No, no, no…” Steve mutters under his breath, his body trembling, his eyes darting across the crowd of onlookers.
A big one, the kind that comes right up from the stomach and through the lungs and opens his mouth wide. Steve joins in, both of their bodies shaking with laughter. Tony laughs so hard his abdomen hurts, so hard his cheeks twinge. He’s still gasping for air when he can finally get words out and say, “We just keep falling into the same patterns, don’t we?”
“Obviously it’s a stupid stereotype that is supported by nothing,” Tony rambles in hope it will stop Steve’s ‘concerned face’. “I’ve known a lot of—”
Tony cups Steve’s check and tells him, “You should do that. I’ll wait.” Steve slinks away and Tony watches him with anticipation. He’s
“You don’t know that,” Tony counters. “What if something happens? What if you can’t finish?” Tony can feel himself getting worked up. Figurative red lights are flashing in his mind.
“You can’t,” Tony said simply. “He’s dead. I saw him die.” He tried not to think about it too much, tried not to remember what it was like to hear Steve’s lifeless body hit the dirt of the Timely’s main road.
“In my defense, I was pretty angry,” Tony begins to explain in panic. “And it was cathartic, and I didn’t think you’d ever see them--oh wait--” he pauses and squints at Steve. “You look at memes about yourself?”
Tony looks around the empty compound. This conversation is so fucking surreal. “And what makes you think I can do that?” He isn’t saying he can’t, but it just feels so impossible, so strange, so…not what he was expecting when he woke up this morning. And that’s saying a lot.
. Steve opens his mouth to say something, but he only lets out a big breath and leans into Tony’s space until they’re kissing again. Tony gets the drift and gets lost in the kiss. There’s no hurry right now, no erections and pounding hearts to keep them on task. It’s just kissing and for Tony it’s much better than getting a verbal confirmation that he’s a sex god.
“Just a couple of things.” She counts them off her fingers. “You stopped sleeping at HQ when you came into the city. Sometimes I catch you two looking at each other. Also, your feet knocked into mine while you were trying to play footsie.”
Tony gets it’s never going to be the same as last night, but he hates the awkwardness he thought they were past. The last time they had been alone—just earlier today while they prepared to jump from 1970 to 2023—they had been joking with each other. They had been
It’s only because yawns are contagious that Tony stretches his arms to the ceiling and feels the sound of his own flow through his body. The lack of anything to do in addition to Steve’s reassuring company makes sleep look like an actual possibility tonight. He flops down on the bed and rolls to a side of his own. Steve turns off the light, crawls, on his hands and knees, takes over the little free space Tony leaves behind. Tony watches him rearrange the covers from out and under him, and the sight of Steve trying to figure out how to get himself under the blanket without moving Tony is very amusing.
Steve nods and crosses his arms. “Yes, the Avengers. Now I know you’re on the fence about this, and I respect that, so I wanted to give you a chance to tell me what I could do to change your mind.”
Steve’s not sure he trusts what’s being offered. They had their chance back and it didn’t work out. “I don’t know,” he responds. If Tony really wanted this, he could have asked before.
“Did my dad know?” Tony asks because it’s the question he’s been pretending isn’t there somewhere on the edge of his brain.
That has to be why Tony doesn’t let the night fall away where it is, and opens his mouth instead. “This is nice. Been a while since I shared a bed with someone.”
“Nice, hmm? That sounds a little weak to me. Gotta up my game, apparently.” Tony doesn’t actually think that. He’s switched to pumping Steve with a demanding rhythm, and Steve looks like he’s already close. At this rate, he won’t even have to use any of the special tricks he’s been hoarding since the last time he was with a man. “Not after you sucked my brains out through my dick.” Steve squirms under his words and Tony gets the message loud and clear: dirty talk is encouraged. “The way you licked my cock? Absolutely fantastic. I could watch you do that all night. Even now I’m thinking about it.”
His gaze shifts upwards, through the concrete and floorboards and everything else separating the workshop from the penthouse, and Steve, probably sitting in the kitchen and reading the Sunday paper. There are things he knows in his past that he never wanted to think about again, and he’s seen the pictures of that period of his life to prove it. There are things from that time he can’t even explain to himself.
It’s weird to hear Steve saying the work ‘fuck’ and using it in this context. Tony always had the impression Steve was the ‘making love’ type. The weirdness is sexy, however, and Tony moans before detangling himself from Steve’s hands. “One-hundred percent, yes.” He reaches over to the nightstand to get the lube, but his eyes fall on something else and he picks up the monster dildo. “You realize I can’t compete with this, right?”
future.” Nathan’s smile falters but his gaze doesn’t change. “And hopefully not the one you’ll see.”
That settled it for Steve. He liked to think that he was a good judge of character, that he could get a sense for a person by the way they held themselves. Having seen the hologram’s exit, Steve knew that even if it wasn’t Tony, it wasn’t anything to be scared of.
“It’s closed,” Tony says, breaking Steve off before they dive too far into nostalgia. “Really, this is good. I’m sure it’s delicious.” Tony plasters on his best easy smile. “Company’s not half bad either.”
Steve breaks, then and there, in the kitchen of the penthouse apartment they share, in the home they’ve be building. “Sure doesn’t feel that way.”
The entire time Steve walks in and out of the workshop. He’s mostly quiet, except when he’s not. Then he’s all questions about the armor and Peter and what’s Tony working on at SI. He doesn’t ask about Bucky or the team or the years they spent rooting out Hydra from Tony’s own company. He does ask about Pepper, whether they’ve had a chance to talk after the accords, and encourages Tony to take her to dinner if he can.
Tony makes it out the door and across the street until a firm hand wraps around his wrist. He tries to shake it off without looking back, but he can’t, of course he can’t, the Supreme Leader is too strong, and he’s weak, he nothing,
thing, he’ll have to make it possible so that Morgan won’t miss him. Tony falls asleep thinking about the logistics of the next time he’s going to stay over
This is probably a time where one or both of them is supposed to comfort the other. Yet, they don’t. Tony doesn’t know Steve’s reasoning, but he doesn’t want to lie. Too much is riding on it.
Tony asked both it and himself. The hologram just watched back, eyebrow crooked. It wouldn’t talk until Tony wanted it to.
“Here is fine,” Steve says and looks at a spot somewhere past Tony’s shoulder. “I’ve already said my goodbyes.”
. Internally, Tony’s trying to convince himself he isn’t, and he won’t. He workshops a couple of responses to Steve, but’s interrupted by the notification sound coming from his phone. Steve’s warm and the bed is comfortable, but the message could be from Pepper. It could be about Morgan. That thought causes him to sit up and reach for his pants so that he can slip the phone from his back pocket. “It’s only Rhodey,” he says aloud, relieved that nothing’s wrong at home. “He wants to know why I’m not sleeping at HQ.” Tony can just tell him he doesn’t want to sleep on a cot in the Midtown hotel ballroom the Avengers were using to coordinate their relief efforts, but Rhodey’s just going to follow up with questions about his whereabouts.
Those words would destroy him. He couldn’t say them, so he gave a small, tight nod, and walked past Steve to the workshop.
The doctor raised an eyebrow in Wong’s direction. “Ok. Give me a few minutes to prepare and then we’ll begin.”
Fuck, Tony really hopes that the next person Steve dates likes giving blowjobs in the shower, because that’s the image Tony can’t shake out of his mind and someone, somewhere, deserves it.
“I don’t remember seeing this in your file,” Tony says and hopes Steve doesn’t call him out on reading his personal information.
“What the…?” he mutters to himself. The space around him is familiar like a ghost, he’s staring at the old Avengers headquarters in the penthouse of the tower, back when Tony and he had formed the new team before the SHRA. The decor is subtly dated--there’s too much leather and track lighting--and the paintings of past teams on the walls that show every iteration of their costumes stop conspicuously a year ago. The wall behind him has been smashed, but the rest of it looks pristine and barely touched, nothing like how it did when the Avengers were here.
“Hi, Steve,” the hologram parroted back and Tony winced. There was no way he sounded like that, so awkward and lovelorn.
Tony tries to focus on Steve’s body, from the controlled way he’s breathing to the tension he can feel everywhere. When they get home, Tony’s going to refer Steve to his massage therapist and then find creative ways to threaten Steve into making an appointment. “It feels like I’m hugging the statue of David.” He rolls onto his back. The sirens have stopped, but lights are flashing outside the window, casting shadows against the ceiling. “Are you seeing anyone?”
Tony gets to his feet and manages to take a few steps to the door. They’re difficult steps, each one heavier as it gets clearer and clearer to him what he has to do. The elevator ride up takes forever, Tony thinks about pressing the emergency stop five different times, but he does what he’s always done, and doesn’t stop himself. One final act in in his saga, one more thing to be his fault.
“Will do, Cap.” Tony tries to sound light-hearted but mostly his voice travels an octave higher than where it’s supposed to. “Gotta go, Stark Unlimited doesn’t run itself.”
The question stole Tony’s breath from his lungs. They were the sort of feelings that could lead to his ousting from Timely. They were the sort of feelings that would have driven Steve away, if he ever knew.
Tony’s slipping into a mental place where logistics matter most, his brain trying to plot out a plan so that they can continue to the main event, so he’s surprised when it’s Steve who asks, “Are you still up for fucking me?”
Everyone says their goodbyes and makes plans for the next couple of days and Tony feels completely out of it while it happens. His brain keeps pointing out strange details, and when it’s time for him to personally acknowledge Steve’s presence and tell him he’ll see him later, Tony has no idea what to do. Should he shake hands? Is that weird if you fucked? But wait, they’ve definitely shaken hands since then. And
Tony was expecting that, but still doesn’t know how to answer. He sits up and Steve rolls over to his side to give him more room to move. Now he can see the mess of come that’s smeared across his pecs, and now that he sees it, he notices that some of Steve’s come is now smeared on
good. Steve, watching you do that, yes, just like that, you’re doing so well, so fucking good.” Steve’s not smiling, that would be pretty hard with all that cock in his mouth, but his eyes get a tiny bit bigger in a way that brightens his whole face. It really compliments the line of spit that’s running down his chin. “Your hand,” Tony pleads, he’s getting close, “could you use your hand?”
He keeps telling himself that as he listens to Thor, Clint, and Rocket playing video games in the next room. He expects they’re drinking. People have a lot of ways of coping with things. Tony doesn’t want anything to do with that right now, though, so he takes his unnecessary glass of water down the hallway with everyone’s room. Every step feels ominous, like he’s marching towards something he absolutely does not want, but he can’t stop. One foot over the other until he’s in front of the door to his suite.
It’s entirely irrational. The kissing wasn’t even the thing Tony’s been thinking of when he’d led himself into this badly thought-out plan. The things he had been thinking about were the wide expanse of muscle that was Steve’s chest and the pressure of Steve’s hard-on against his thigh. These things are still there, and Tony is definitely still noticing them, but
Steve was across the room and next to Iron Man, fallen on the floor, before he even realized Iron Man was no longer wearing his helmet. “Are you ok?” he asked just when the shock hit him. He was looking at a pair of blue eyes, a pair of blue eyes he was very familiar with.
“I can’t,” Tony responds, like he’s begging, too, begging to not be put in this position, begging to let this be enough.
Tony picks up the short and fluffy robe he left nearby as well as a cold water bottle. He downs the water in a series of gulps and ties the robe tightly around himself. The cold air on his warm skin does nothing to make him more likely to sleep. Nervous energy is vibrating down his body and keeping him bouncing on the ball of his feet. He’s already disappointed in advance because rubbing one out isn’t going to fix this problem.
Steve shrugs. “That’s not true. You would have found a way. Also, thank Scott. And…” Steve pauses and looks over the battlefield. Tony knows what he’s going to say before he says it. “And Nat.”
Tony says the line in his head a few times and already knows it’s not going to come out of his mouth. “It’s not like that between us.”
Natasha swats at Steve’s shoulder. “Did they let you, or did you just slip fifty bucks over the counter when they weren’t looking?” She’s sitting only a step down from Steve and taking up her fair share of the stoop.
Steve murmurs his agreement but doesn’t commit to continuing the conversation. He’s not sure if Tony considers himself one of those closeted superheros and he’s not going to ask. He doesn’t expect Tony to ever ask him, either. He doesn’t think Tony has much interest in this part of Steve.
Tony has a feeling that the conversation from before is over for the night, so he places the phone on the bedside table. He sees his rumpled clothes on the floor and is glad he has a clean-ish suit in the car. “Good. I got a meeting with the Fed before going home.” He’d been trying to cluster all his reasons for going into the city so that he doesn’t have to waste a lot of time driving to and from home and miss opportunities to be Morgan. Unfortunately, this was one meeting he couldn’t schedule for today. Tony rolls onto his back and looks up at the man looming over him. Steve’s hair is still damp and is now falling into his eyes. “Thanks for having me,” Tony tells him. He’s vaguely aware he should be brushing his teeth or something like that at the moment.
“Fuck,” Tony responds, louder than Steve, and picks up his pace. He tries his best to keep the angle that has Steve gasping. It’s a sight to behold and he can’t take his eyes off it. “You like that.” It’s not a question. It really looks like Steve does.
There is no good way to respond to that, so Tony doesn’t even try. Instead he begins to move and hopes Steve is willing to just follow. “I can show you to the kitchen, if you’re hungry.”
Steve opened the door wide and took a step inside before giving Tony a look that invited him to come in. He hoped the privacy would give them more space to speak. From across the street he heard the voices of the Fantastic Four; the Avengers were not needed anymore. “I missed you,” Steve said once they were both inside and no one, not even Iron Man down the hall, could hear him.
Steve stands up and he’s unsteady enough on his feet Tony reflexively reaches out to help him. Steve shrugs him off. “Not really much for sleep these days.” He hobbles out of the room, not looking back. "And you’re not the one to talk.”
Tony saunters forward and stands between Steve’s open legs. Naked is a good look on the man—he wears it better than any outfit Tony’s ever seen. With a light push to the shoulders, Steve’s laying on the bed. Tony joins him with his knees on either side of Steve’s waist and his palms bracketing his head. “That was a very good blowjob,” Tony leans down to say. “How would you like me to show my appreciation?”
“As far as I’m aware” Tony says, which means that was where Steve and his band of runaways were as of the last time he checked. Which just happened to be this morning. “Have you been up all this time?”
“I know.” Pepper smiles a very sad smile. “You’ll make Natasha proud.” She looks up to the ceiling, clearly hearing something Tony can’t. “I should go tuck her in.”
“Come back to bed, then,” is what Tony thinks is an appropriate response. Steve listens, turns off the lights, and they both find a spot close to each other but
Tony shakes off the phantom sensation of the Supreme Leader’s voice against his ear. “I have to go.” He stands up so fast the table shakes and water sloshes over their cups. If Steve looked scared and confused before, it was nothing compared to how quickly he gets on his feet and follows Tony.
His first thought is Steve’s old bedroom, the one that’s been gathering dust over the last few months, and that Tony has been pointedly not looking at since he moved back in. The door’s closed, like it’s been, and Tony decides it would be weird to slip his head in and check to see if Steve’s ok. He’s about to return to the promise of coffee when he sees a sliver of light escaping from Natasha’s room down the hall.
“Yeah, you’re right,” Tony says. He lifts himself out of the hot tub and sits on the side of it so that his legs still dangle in the water. “I’m beginning to prune, anyway.”
“Have to, what, exactly?” Tony smirks as he talks and pushes Steve’s pants down from his hips. Steve’s cock is no longer a hypothetical Tony’s been constructing in his head. It’s real, it’s hard, and it’s quite big. “Do this?” He wraps his fingers around the shaft and revels in how Steve’s breaths leave his lungs with increasing frequency.
“Now I do!” Tony says, practically screeches. “I would really like to have those memories.” He’s frantically searching for something in Steve’s eyes. “Or new memories, at least.”
Tony sighs, debates switching the topic entirely, and shuts his eyes close. “I think the worst was ‘So, you lied and destroyed your found family.’ It may have been a little too on the nose to be applicable to the public at large.” He opens one eye to look at Steve and see his reaction.
It did, and it didn’t look good. With a sigh, Tony sat down heavily on his desk chair. There was one of two possible problems going on here. Either the hologram was improperly copying his actions, or Tony really was failing at being the suave man everyone expected him to be. “Remove the delay,” Tony ordered the hologram. Instantly the hologram was sitting on air, in the same position Tony was. Tony waved, it waved. Tony coughed, it coughed. Tony pulled his shoulder back to straighten his posture, the hologram did the same.
The show of charm does nothing for Steve’s frown, which holds up strong against Tony’s attempt at lightening the mood. “You don’t have to lie for me.”
“Yeah, same here,” Tony responds and he has the quell the reflex to look at the top drawer of his desk and the flip phone inside.
The fact that he wants to fuck Steve doesn’t mean he will. If anything, acknowledging it makes it less likely, ruins the mystique and the urge. Acknowledging it means acknowledging all the other things he wants. And as good as fucking Steve would be--and Tony’s sure it would be
“Respectfully, I have to disagree,” Princess Shuri begins to say. “These stones are dangerous even in the best of times. Right now, they do not belong to us and their existence in our timeline is destabilizing. Returning them as soon as possible is the correct thing to do.” King T’Challa nods his head in agreement with his sister.
Steve rolls over, too. Tony doesn’t even need the light to see it, the bed is just that bad. “I thought I already answered that question.”
“I don’t understand,” Steve said as he brought his horse to a halt. "Then why are you leaving Timely?”
. Tony has no idea what Steve, Sam, and Barnes were up to before pizza but Steve's shirt has sweat stains and his hair is flat against his head. There’s an ease to his shoulders that Tony hasn’t seen often.
“He’s right, you know,” Natasha says and Tony realizes she’s still sitting across the table from him. “We need to finish this.”
“Is it a car??” Tony asks, incredulous and happy. “I’ll have to keep it at the compound, though. I don’t have a lot of room at the lakehouse.”
“Good. Because it’s not. Anyway—” Tony flails his arm a bit for a reason he can’t comprehend and grimaces when some of the water sloshes over onto his hand. “I just came to say that. About Pepper. And to make sure you’re ok.”
"Same, too. Can't sleep. I close my eyes and think about what we're going to deal with tomorrow. I tried to find this bottle of scotch I had here from before Thanos, but no luck.”
“Ok,” is all Steve says. He’s studying one of the newspaper clippings that’s framed on the wall; it’s about Natasha’s congressional hearing a few years ago. The lines on his face are furrowed in concentration; there is a look in his eyes that Tony doesn’t like. It’s a look he’s seen on Steve too often and one he never learned how to handle without a joke.
Tony thinks, completely stunned by the surprising display of flexibility. So stunned that he misses Steve reaching down and around his leg. Steve moans, “Tony,” and that’s Tony’s cue to get back with the program and realize that Steve’s applying pressure to his own prostate via his perineum.
Steve’s heart thumps, he can hear it in the silence that follows. His hands are held in tight fists, his fingernails dig into his palm, the world is falling apart beside him. He stands his ground and refuses to be the one who leaves the room first even though he has nothing left to say.
It’s Tony’s turn to be without words. Steve’s not sure Tony will believe him. He had some letters for a while, but nothing survived when his apartment was destroyed. And Tony? He clearly had kept nothing to remind himself of those days if he had never put the pieces together after he deleted his memories.
Tony has no intention of letting him get a word in. “No, no, no, I get it, it wasn’t a big deal. Just a tiny tiff, really minor. Makes sense you would forget. It’s not like we didn’t talk for
, Steve, your asshole is a fucking masterpeice. I could fuck you until the sun rises,” Tony grunts. The last part is hyperbole: he has five minutes, tops. But he wishes it was true, and that’s what counts. He takes Steve’s cock into his hand and tries to find a way to stroke it in some way that compliments what he’s doing with his hips.
“Of course it was,” Steve says, his eyes still fixated on Tony’s hand, and despite the fact that he thinks he has a pretty good grasp on Steve’s dry sense of humor, Tony can’t tell if he’s being sarcastic.
Based on his pursed lips, it looks like Steve has an answer to that that he doesn’t share. “Just figured I’d ask,” he faux-explains instead, and finishes shimmying off his pants before lifting up the grossly colored polo so that he’s only left in his undershirt and boxers. He yawns. “I can’t believe how tired I am.”
Tony wasn’t sure exactly what that meant, but he said, “Steve Rogers,” because that’s what sounded right.
Tony’s internal monologue reacts very strongly to the situation. “My pleasure.” He pulls what little focus he can wrench away from the moaning man beneath him and puts it to use in maintaining his speed. His abdominal muscles and thighs are feeling the strain, and he’s getting closer to an orgasm than he’d like to be right now.
His hands moved swiftly across the transparent, holographic keys as he began to do his own mission report. “Wait…” he muttered, the thoughts not taking hold in sequence with his surprise. “What if…”
“FRIDAY?” Tony asks when he slips back into the workshop and sees her standing where he left her. His eyes keep finding the table Steve had been leaning against; he has an irrational thought that he should clean the spot with bleach.
Tony tries to save the conversation. “The answer could totally be ‘no’, or ‘not tonight’ or anything.”
Nathan chuckles, but it’s a subtle thing, more like a quick exhale that somehow softens his features. Tony swears he’s seen it a thousand times. “Wasn’t doing much of that back then. Kinda difficult when you’re eighty-eight.”
Steve’s about to die because Tony couldn’t keep his armor under control. Yinsen’s son, of all people, wants to prove a point and he’s going to do it with fucking Captain America’s life. It’s Tony’s fault, it’s always been his fault, and he’d give up his life it meant he could fix any of it.
Steve walks to the end of the alley, looks both ways, and says “I can do that.” His hands are on his hips and Tony sees a problem right away. Steve looks
“It’s like you’re asking me to regret undressing you,” Tony mumbles under his breath. He earns a look from Steve for that. “You’ve been a spy before. Look small and inconspicuous, and not like a construction worker from a music video.” Steve huffs, but he also turns in on himself and wraps his arms around his chest in a way that manages to hide the bulging tendons in his forearms. It’s impressive how quickly he goes from Captain America to just a tall chump on the street. “Perfect. You’re a natural. So, first things first--”
A loud crash rang from down the hall. Steve was on his feet immediately and out the door almost as fast. Privacy be damned; Iron Man had almost died, and the crash had sounded
He waits for Steve to wander into the workshop and in the meantime works on improvements to the Captain America shield. Steve eventually shows up, sometime in the early afternoon, and as he shuffles closer to Tony’s makeshift desk by the platform, Tony hopes he doesn’t fall.
Nathan nods, but also qualifies with, “it wasn’t just you. But you played a key part, and I know you can do it again.”
Tony takes it out of his hand. It could be a bomb, but he’s feeling risky. “You don’t know me at all,” he says as he studies the watch-like thing.
>>A few days ago I experienced an Extremis-induced hallucination which encouraged me to make a copy of my own memories.
He was so immersed in that thought process that he didn’t notice when Doctor Strange finished what he was doing. Tony knew because the man coughed loudly to draw his attention. “I am ready to begin.”
It’s a nice sentiment, but it doesn’t quell Tony’s jealousy. “How do you know the term ‘size queen’?”
Tony can’t keep his mouth shut, it’s that satisfying. “You’re amazing—just, amazing—it feel’s so good, so fucking good, you’re so
Everyone smiles and a few of them laugh. Steve shakes his head fondly. Tony has to give himself a ten second limit before he looks somewhere else besides Steve's eyes. He can’t be too obvious, even if Steve’s painfully attractive today.
that idea was, but he wanted it deep in his bones. “I’d be very amenable to that, despite everything that could go wrong.”
Not, you know, the whole thing about him being injured in the first place. “Don’t worry about it,” I tossed off, because now that the immediate threat of death was gone, I wasn’t comfortable admitting how much I was worrying.
Tony’s eyes dart up when he hears the door open. From his spot low in the compound's communal hot tub, he can watch as Steve walks into the gym. Steve places the towel he’s carrying onto the cement near the pool and proceeds to slip off his shirt and sweatpants. While they’re being folded into a neat pile next to the towel, Tony makes a split-second decision to slip even lower into the hot water. It’s dark and the hot tub’s jets turned off five minutes ago. Steve probably doesn’t know he’s here.
It’s so quiet Tony hears the footsteps in the hallway. It’s so quiet he hears the nanobots forming a repulser around his hand and whirring, ready to fire, as he aims.
He can still hear the shower, so he knocks on the door and enters before Steve answers. Steve’s face peeks out from behind the shower curtain, holding the rubber cloth tight against his face like he has any modestly left to conceal. “What’s wrong?” he asks.
Steve shakes himself out of whatever train of thought his brain fell into. “Tonight’s good. Are you asking, about, my...um preferences?”
Because he’s him, though, his brain slowly lets other problems filter in. Tomorrow’s mission for one. The basic mechanics of getting back to his room are another. “I don’t want to put my clothes on,” he breaks the kiss to complain. His swim shorts have been lying damp by the door and his robe is covered in sweat, spit, and semen.
Tony’s finger hovers above the y button for a second. Warning bells ring out in his head, he should shut the whole thing down, run away as fast as he can. This has to be a plot of someone like the Mandarin, it’s just too perfect of a set up, but Tony can’t let go of the thought that only, he, himself, would try to weasel into his brain on the promise of upsetting memories.
Which also means Tony’s prepared to give himself the gift of forgetting if he needs to. He’s going to need to.
Tony laughs it off. He remembers it differently. “Either way, if you weren't there, I might not be here.”
Maybe to someone else Steve would seem unconfident in his many varied attempts to make Tony moan, but Tony just sees someone earnestly trying to make him feel as good as possible. So what if it’s a little uncoordinated? So what if a string of spit hangs between Steve’s mouth and Tony’s dick? Actually, wait,
It’s dark by the time he ends up walking past the peep shows and porn shops of Time Square. He almost forgot how seedy it used to be here and it makes him feel more like a kid who got a chance to sneak away from their mom than a grown-ass man who currently owns property four blocks away. He walks past the hotel a few times before he even notices it’s there, it’s so nondescript and dingy, and the woman working the front desk doesn’t even look up from her magazine as he waltzes by and takes the rickety elevator up to the twelfth floor.
person. Let’s just say...it didn’t work out very well. I slept with a few women.” Steve shrugs. “And then a couple of men, just to be sure.”
Steve’s in the kitchen, not the bedroom, and Tony regrets he doesn’t have the couple hundred more feet to separate himself from his own demise. “Tony?” Steve asks, when he sees him, and wow, he’s perfect like this--freshly showered and ready for the day--and Tony would do anything,
Steve winces. Tony can practically feel the moment he chooses to tell the truth despite great personal cost. “That...
, but no one in this building is. Steve’s just one of the few falling back on reflexively lying about it.
Tony kisses him like he’s expecting Steve to say no. Right away it’s weird; Steve remembers all of their past kisses. It’s hard to let the past go.
Tony would do anything to protect him, and that’s why, even if his voice wobbles, he says, “I can’t do this, anymore Steve. I just...
Tony sees a duffel bag empty and crumpled up in a corner. He knows Steve kinda, sorta, lives somewhere else. It’s just that he’s been imagining Natasha and Steve taking over the compound in his absence. In his mind they’re drinking his liquor and holding sparring matches and talking about whatever they talk about. He wonders what Steve’s actual place looks like—if it’s just a place he lays his head at night while keeping dutifully clean—or if it’s actually a home. He wonders if he’d learn anything about Steve if he saw it.
Steve hums something that sounds like a response, so maybe he just said that aloud. Vibrations travel along his nerves to his brain and seem to skip so much of his body in-between. And Tony lied, it’s not just his dick he can feel, because he also has eyes. And the view from up there is
Steve’s barely breathing. It’s more like he’s gasping for air and barely getting enough in his lungs to gasp again. “I need—”
“Never thought what?” Tony asks. He has a small idea what Steve’s about to say, but he wants to hear him say it.
, even if he was confused at everyone who was coming to speak to him. From this far away, Tony could almost sense the beating of his heart and the air moving through his lungs. He wanted nothing more than to run and take Steve firmly into his arms, to
“You should see… the other… guy,” Steve panted. I took heart in the fact that his voice was coming in stronger as he spoke.
, you mean,” Tony cuts into say. He’s agitated again, Steve can hear how much he hates the idea of Steve’s death.
“It is,” Steve replies, very quick, and Tony can tell there’s more he wants to say. There’s a few moments where Tony debates himself about whether to let him continue, whether this conversation is about to get heavier than the two of them are ready to handle. Tony chooses to keep quiet and wait for Steve to fill the silence. “It’s been a while for me, too.” Steve groans, like he’s a tad ashamed for even saying that.
Tony defaults to overconfidence in the face of this confusing revelation. “What’s your review? Did it blow your mind? On a scale of one to earth-shattering, how great does it look like I am in bed?”
He was just going to need to get it over with, tell Steve that Tony Stark was laying on a beach somewhere and definitely didn’t want to be dating him, and not spending all of his time in his workshop in the basement. He had been lying to Happy and Pepper for this long, how could this be any worse?
“Tony!” Steve says and he finally manages to take the dildo away from Tony. “It’s fine. I mean it. Don't worry about it.” He throws it somewhere off the bed and reaches for the lube. “Do you want to talk about my dildo or do you want to fuck me?”
Steve opens the door and steps out, “Yes?”, and yeah, Tony was right, Steve’s body getting clean did not do the same to Tony’s thoughts.
doing and creating makes him feel more like a person than having an actual physical body to go with his consciousness.
He steps out past the kitchen island and down the hallway. The sound of the front door closing echoes all the way to Steve’s ears.
Tony feels Steve’s words all the way down to his toes. It’s a fantastic idea, dirty in a way he’d never expect from Steve and therefore even more hot. Unfortunately his phone is in his pants and
“The old fashioned way,” the man replied. He had a deep voice with an accent that sounded like he came from the East Coast but read more books than he spoke to people. “He told me about all the interesting things that have happened here since the sheriff was killed and the mayor was ousted. I wanted to see this place for myself.”
Pepper appears behind Morgan. She’s got her concerned face on. She knows, Tony messaged her about Natasha’s death soon after they returned, and she’s not doing a good job hiding her feelings. With a hand on Morgan’s shoulder, she says, “Time to go to bed. Say goodbye to your dad.”
“Wait, wait!” Tony calls before Steve has made even two steps in the other direction. It takes him only a few seconds to stand up and arrive before Steve. “What if I want it to mean something? I’ve been in love with you forever, before and since, and always, and I’m supposed to just forget it? I’m supposed to just
Tony goes all in, pulls him closer. Steve’s hands wrap around Tony’s back and cling to the fabric of his tux. The connection to Tony’s body is what does it, he’s no longer thinking about how it was back then, he’s thinking about what it’s like right now. He’s thinking about how Tony tastes and how he smells and how his mustache feels different than the goatee.
Steve’s fingers graze the top of the waistband of Tony’s swim trunks. Tony, who’s had his eyes closed while he enjoyed the feeling of Steve’s lips on his skin, looks down to see Steve staring up at him. He’s waiting for something, possibly Tony’s permission to continue, but Tony gawks at the image of Steve on one knee long enough that he misses the point. Steve breaks him out of his confusion when his fingers slip between the top of Tony’s shorts and his skin. He also raises an eyebrow as if to say:
Steve stays rooted in the spot, ignoring the impulse to go to Tony and shake the answers out of him. “Why?” There’s nothing that would satisfy him, but he needs to see Tony try to say something that comes close.
It’s a lie. There are a lot of other things he cares about. He cares that Steve’s very distressed, and has been very distressed for quite a while. He cares that no one took the time to work with Steve and try a lot of other things out. He cares that Steve doesn’t seem to think any one should have. And what he’s trying really hard
“And why would he listen to me?” Tony grimaces. “And I don’t even know what the hell you want me to say.”
“Of course,” he says, though actually telling them sounds impossibly hard at the moment. He adds it to his pile of tomorrow’s problems. “And—” he pauses, takes a deep breath, and looks Pepper right in the eye. “We’re going to win.”
“Yes. Perfect.” Tony returns to the previous position with a little more confidence. He strokes Steve’s cock a few times to show appreciation for his eagerness.  Steve’s eyes closed and his hips lightly rock in time with Tony’s hand. “You look perfect,” Tony says. He focuses on the place where the tip of his dick is nudged against Steve’s lube-slick rim. It feels impossible that he’ll be able to fit inside but Steve said he was ready, so Tony’s going to believe him.
“Why now?” Tony asks as they’re eating a frozen pizza one night. “You could stay in this timeline longer, wait until we’ve invented time travel organically.”
The last ten hours have disappeared as Tony immersed himself in taking apart the Time GPS, far more comfortable thinking about the How of Steve’s time travel and not the Why. Which is exactly the reason he’s almost finished heating up the water for the French Press when he remembers Steve is supposed to be somewhere in the building. He decides to let the water wait and check to see where exactly Steve decided to lay his head for the night.
. Tony looks over to make sure he hasn’t already fallen asleep, only to find Steve’s looking at him. “Good night, Tony,” he says, a soft and languid smile on his lips visible in the faint light illuminating from the streetlights through window. This may be the first time Tony has ever seen Steve sleepy before. It’s…unexpected.
“Yeah, ‘oh.’” Steve stands up in a motion that causes the bed to bounce. “I’m going to take a shower,” he announces, terse.
Steve tugged at my arm and I stared at him in confusion, unsure of what he was asking for and why he couldn’t just use his words. “Come down here,” he sad, soft, tired, and I reached out to where his hand circled my arm. A thin and invisible barrier separated us, made up of all the apologies we were never going to say.
“My life.” Tony didn’t believe in any of this, but certainly that was the only right answer. It was a justifiable price.
“Why the hell would I--” Tony stops his question when an orange glow begins to permeate the room, taking up the space in between them.
Tony walked closer and closer to him, causing Steve to take small steps backward until the back of his knees bumped into a desk chair. Without any grace, Steve’s butt fell into the chair and he looked up to see a blue face looking down at him, blue like Tony’s eyes. It shouldn’t have worked, and Steve couldn’t feel a thing, but Tony’s transparent form never stopped until it had climbed on top of him. “Everything’s ok, and I
Steve’s head tilts to the side but his eyes don’t narrow; he’s confused, not suspicious. “Of course,” he says, but he waits for Tony to lead them out, and for a few seconds Tony’s rooted in the spot, both surprised that Steve’s willing to listen to him, and then surprised he’s surprised. It’s Steve.
Yet...as Tony closes the door on the workshop and turns his back on Steve so he can walk a conference room down the hall, he has to fight the impulse to break into a run.
Steve leaves blissfully quick after Tony acquiesce, too happy from Tony’s answer to really question Tony’s flimsy excuse about a non-existent board meeting.
Tony slumped low in the chair, and its hinges whined at how the weight of the armor put too much pressure on the arm rests. “That was a disaster,” he said to the empty office. The room didn’t respond, because thankfully Tony had disabled the hologram and all of the commands that were built into it, but the silence was answer enough. That plan had been a dumpster-fire.
Steve makes a little noise in the back of his throat. His mouth parts, just slightly, and Tony takes that as a sign to push a little forward. That must have been the wrong impulse, though, because Steve steps back. Tony can’t read his expression. “Was that the question?” Steve asks.
