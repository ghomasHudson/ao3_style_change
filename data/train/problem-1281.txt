"Mr Lyndale had provided a magnificent buffet dinner in the adjacent drawing room, and for the next few hours I circulated between that room and the salon. There was music, conversation, cards, and so on."
Lyndale had been staring at his feet, but now he looked up at us. "No, wait, Mr Holmes, Dr Watson. I have something here I thought you might like to see."
her father has taken me to visit everyone I wish to see."
"I trust him with my life," I said firmly.
"Quite," said Holmes, neutrally. "Monsignor, was your expertise known to some of your fellow guests before your arrival?"
"They're building a railway bridge," I explained. "It will be the longest in the world, apparently."
Holmes rose from his chair and went to the safe. He drew from it the green folder in which I had filed the documents pertaining to our previous case, the Cable Street robberies and arson attacks. He spread out the papers on the table, and we both bent our heads over them.
He was a reserved, old-fashioned, proud man, much like my brother in that last respect. He had been considered a pillar of the local community: a country solicitor and a reader at the local church. He only came alive, in a quiet dry way, when he was indulging his interest in botany and zoology. I remembered him taking me for walks around our West Lothian home when I was a boy, pointing out the frogspawn and the different species of heather. My brother was already away at school by this point, though not yet at odds with our father.
"Holmes, come here."
.. .. ..
He raised an eyebrow. "Really, you agree? I was chaffing you, you know."
"You haven't ever felt the same way yourself?" I prompted.
I waited, knowing better than to address Holmes while he was deep in thought. Sometimes he would fall into a brown study and not emerge for hours. This time, however, he stirred after only a few minutes, and shook his head impatiently.
Holmes placed the jug on his dresser. "I'll just leave this here for you, shall I?" he said with brisk efficiency, and I realised that he was as nervous and uncertain as I was.
"Thank you, Watson," he murmured, still studying the paper. Surely he could not already know the map of Edinburgh well enough to be aware of that fact! On the other hand, I would not put any feat past that great brain.
We spent the evening reading by the fire. The hour was still early when Holmes caught my attention by laying aside his book and standing up to bank the fire for the night.
I hesitated. "I was rather planning on staying here tonight, if you don't mind, old chap."
He drew a small pouch from his pocket and opened it. Inside lay two cameos carved in sardonyx shell. The creamy white figures were fashioned in exquisite detail, standing out in relief against the deep, rich brown background. They were beautiful. I would certainly not have spotted the difference from the fakes as easily as Monsignor Pinet did, but now that I knew it, the true cameos were unmistakable.
.. .. .. .. .. .. ..
.. .. ..
"Thank you with all my heart, Watson," he murmured in my ear.
"Yes, here we are. JP for Lancashire, educated at Stonyhurst, residences in London and Lancashire. Married, widowed, has issue—son and two daughters." He paused for a second, clearly absorbing all the details on the page, and then closed the book with a snap. "And he wishes to see me about a theft, according to his telegram."
"Perhaps this time I might hang my coat up first," he said dryly.
Garner had managed to do that rare thing: to throw Holmes off balance. Holmes covered it very smoothly. I expect I was the only one who noticed.
This statement left me taken aback. Surely he did not mean to suggest that he intended to deviate from his habitual and time-honoured practice, and lay out the logical path of his deductions for me before the denouement of the case! His next words nonetheless confirmed this theory.
He put out a hand to pull me to his side while he went on studying the map. "It is not every day I have the opportunity to visit the town which formed my Watson," he said. "Indeed, knowing what I now do of this gruesome city, it seems I have to thank God you even managed to reach the age of eighteen, and escape with your life."
Soon, footsteps on the stairs heralded the arrival of Nicholas Lyndale.
Now, he met Garner's coolness with coolness. "And when precisely did you and your fellow friars first learn of the monsignor's interest in cameos?"
"I suppose you were raised on Foxe's Book of Martyrs?" said Holmes with a smile.
On the sheet of paper was printed just one line:
All of that was driven from my mind as warm breath fell suddenly on my face, and then Holmes was kissing me fiercely, his hands gripping my shoulders as though he would never let go. After a moment's shock I responded just as strongly, pressing myself up against him. I slid one hand inside his cape, trying to get as close as possible to the warmth of his skin. I could not tell how long we stood there, clinging to each other. Holmes was like a man who has found water after a long drought, and I am sure I appeared in much the same light to him.
"So you don't suspect any of those you've already met, then—the family and close friends?"
"Where to now?" I asked.
"I see," said Holmes, in a voice that sounded sincere to Lyndale, but that told me he didn't believe a word the man was saying. "But that doesn't explain how she committed this impossible act, the cameo theft, under the eyes of so many witnesses."
"What can I do for you, gentlemen?" he asked, smiling vaguely at both of us.
"Tomorrow, however," he added brightly, "we shall have the opportunity to speak to what I hope will be most informative witnesses yet, in Limehouse."
"I shall be as quick as I can," I whispered.
"Ah, but I did not say their purpose was burglary, did I, Watson?"
By the time he had finished, the dinner hour was approaching. Before we left, Holmes arranged with Lyndale that the latter would call for us the following morning, and take us to meet the other guests present on the night of the theft.
One small plaque said
Sherlock Holmes was far from being modest, but he spoke the exact truth, of course, in describing my relations with him as the most important part of my life.
Sherlock Holmes' hand rested on my knee, but I did not feel in the least bit slighted that his head was turned away from me and he was paying me no attention at all, for after all, it was my own city of Edinburgh which he was drinking in through the hansom cab window.
"My head hurts," I complained as we climbed the steps to our front door, Lyndale's carriage pulling away behind us. "There are too many witnesses in this case."
We took a cab as far as the Highway, and then walked down towards the river. I knew these streets around Limehouse Basin well. We had had occasion to explore them many times, including just one week previously on our most recent case.
"Precisely," I said aloud. "No one knows what the future holds. Why, one of us could be run over by a runaway horse tomorrow, God forbid. Afghanistan taught me to live in the present, and I want to spend every possible second of that present with you."
As I climbed the stairs to my own bedroom, my heart lay heavy in my chest. My little room seemed cold and quiet when I reached it, and as I set my candle down on the chest beside my bed, I could not suppress a sigh.
"Thank you, Mr Holmes, Dr Watson. It's very kind of you," said Mrs Smith, smiling at both of us.
He smiled fondly at me. "Well, my dear fellow, let me hear your deductions so far."
"And you said nothing!"
"What a wonderful organ you have," he was exclaiming when I joined them. "It's a Henry Willis, I believe?"
"No?" I wondered if he felt they were above suspicion because they were men of God, but that did not seem likely.
Father Briggs shook his head. "It was the first time I'd been in the house, so I'm not sure what was usual and what wasn't. I don't generally go to those social events. I was only roped in because another friar was ill."
I hesitated. There did not seem to be a great deal to say. "The maid, Margaret, appeared to be in quite a state. Do you think it is of any relevance?"
Holmes murmured good night without raising his head, and I quietly left the room. Under other circumstances, I might have wondered whether the possibility of sharing a bed that night was something that had crossed Holmes' mind as it crossed mine, and what that meant if it did or if it didn't. I was spared from such doubts, however, by the knowledge that Holmes would certainly stay up late into the night, deep in thought about the case.
I blinked, coming back to myself. He had been following my thoughts on my face, of course. I smiled faintly. "Old regrets, old ghosts." My words turned into a yawn.
"It is not a risk I am willing to take." He turned away from me. "This will never change, you know, Watson," he said in a low voice. "We shall never be free."
"So the cabinet maker is also in some way relevant to the case?"
My hesitant smile turned into a laugh. Yesterday his coat had ended up in a crumpled heap on the floor.
"Have you eaten?"
"Oh, a few hundred years, I think."
"They're sitting in the cellar of this very building as we speak," Lestrade confirmed. "Now what is this all about, Mr Holmes?"
Lestrade's men had arrived by now, summoned by his whistle, and they relieved us of Lyndale. Our last sight of him was as he was loaded into the police carriage, still wearing the same dazed and dumbfounded expression.
As Holmes turned over the papers, I asked, "But who was involved in the fake theft of the cameos? Not all the guests, surely?"
"You weren't looking so well this morning."
Then he bent down to kiss me, and we came together, hips pounding, striving for climax, until we both spent in one glorious moment.
"There's a soup kitchen in Limehouse, run by a Franciscan friar. Georgiana used to spend some time there, and I believe that's where she met the fellow."
Father Briggs stood in the central aisle in a cassock and Mass vestments, speaking to two ragged old men. He looked up and caught sight of us in the doorway. He frowned, but once he'd finished his conversation, he came to join us in the corridor outside the chapel.
, presumably, being the infamous railway engineer possibly called Smith.
He made an impatient noise in his throat. "Yes indeed, I am Sherlock Holmes, as you so dramatically exclaim - surely the most heedless, unintentionally cruel man you have ever known. Why, from day to day I live in dread of the possibility that one of my thoughtless comments or actions will drive you out the door. I did not even dare to hope that we would last as long as we have, in fact."
Margaret was still staring at me, clearly on the verge of tears again. I was beginning to wonder whether that were her habitual expression. She was saved from answering by the sound of the door opening.
"Of course," Holmes said smoothly. "Did you notice anything unusual that night?
I rose from the breakfast table, trying to shake off the sudden oppression that had overcome my spirit. Holmes' gaze followed the movement, and I realised I had moved more abruptly and betrayed more of my feelings than I had intended.
"Yes, indeed," he said. "And I also foresaw Mr Lyndale telling us to abandon the case." Ignoring my cry of surprise, he went on, "I must admit, however, that I didn't expect the two to be connected. I'm impressed. Lyndale took advantage of an unexpected event. A very adaptable man."
His head was tilted back, his thin lips open. I could hear his breathing, soft and urgent in the quiet room. My own heart raced at the same galloping rhythm.
For a moment we regarded each other across the space which separated us, myself still not quite sure what was going through his mind, until he spoke again, choosing his words with deliberation:
"I believe so."
"You may all come out into the yard now, if you like," Holmes told us. He waved me over to the kitchen window.
Five minutes later we were in a hansom cab, rattling across the cobblestones of Edinburgh city. We quickly left behind the imposing sweeps of beautiful sandstone town-houses, crescents and private gardens of the New Town, and plunged into the narrow, twisting, grimy streets of the Old Town. The cab left us on the Royal Mile, at Holmes' request, and we continued more discreetly on foot. I was amused to find that Holmes' anticipative study of the map of Edinburgh had been sufficiently thorough for him to be able to lead the way, and I was happy to indulge his penchant for flaunting his knowledge.
Lestrade frowned. "I don't like the sound of that."
"A lucky guess, my dear Mrs Hudson," Holmes cried. "Now let us go back inside, before we all catch our deaths in the damp night air."
I retired directly to my room, for I had slept poorly on the sleeper, one of our fellow passengers being a very noisy snorer.
I leant forward to take a closer look. "I suppose you are reading about Burke and Hare, the grave-robbers, and their ilk?"
I was astounded. "So much for his vows of poverty," I exclaimed.
"Not such a deserving case as all that," Holmes said. "Wilcott is now in gaol."
The music was building to a crescendo now, the church's vaulted interior filled with the deep, rich, almost discordant booming of the pipes, all powerful unending notes as only an organ can produce. I glanced sideways at Holmes, who had his eyes closed. He opened them only when the final, lingering echoes died away, leaving the church in silence.
"She who had been crying?"
Holmes nodded. "Last night, or rather in the early hours of this morning. He will call again this afternoon."
.. .. ..
"This cameo business again?" Briggs said impatiently. "What a fuss about nothing."
I knew that he was very well aware his father had been responsible for the theft. As he returned the cameos to his pocket, I wondered what effect that would have on a young man, to know his father was a criminal. It was a scandal that would haunt the family for the rest of their lives.
"Yes, I, ah—in fact I have some indirect interests down that way, I believe. Like I said, it's my agent who takes care of all that." He looked at his watch. "Now, if that's all, gentlemen—? Believe me, I greatly appreciate your work on my behalf. But if you don't mind, I have some business to attend to."
"Not too knocked about, I hope, constable?" Holmes enquired.
I did not join him in his armchair, but sat in my own chair opposite, on the other side of the fireplace.
"So Garner was not involved in the theft?"
"Yes, that's true." He paused. "I'm worried about her. I'd like to be reassured she's all right."
"Then what - "
He accompanied our two visitors to the front door, and returned looking extremely thoughtful.
He leant across to the bedside table and stubbed out his cigarette with a vicious jab.
We both took a seat, and Holmes gave Lyndale a succinct account of our visit to Limehouse.
"Very well." He crumpled the note up in one hand, his eyes abstracted in thought.
The younger Mr Lyndale greeted us much more quietly, shaking us each by the hand with a few murmured words. He did not blush and stammer, as Mr Willis had suggested he would, but perhaps that was because we weren't young ladies in search of a husband.
"On the contrary! He has a strong hold over her, forcing her to cooperate. Up until this point she had acquiesced to all his orders, but this time she was unwilling to, out of a sense of loyalty to her employers. She hoped, somewhat naively, to scare Brodie off by having someone lie in wait for him on the night he broke into the Gordons. That someone was her young gentleman, a respectable if not very successful plumber by the name of Lochie. Brodie was spooked, indeed, but he did not run away. He shot Lochie."
I frowned. "It's not a crime to be in love."
As we travelled further from the train station, and penetrated deeper into the neighbourhood of private squares and magnificent town-houses where the Gordons lived, I attempted to draw my friend's attention to some landmarks of interest. Holmes did not seem to be listening, however, and I surmised that the Duke of Moray's residence and birthplace of Sir Walter Scott fell into the same category of irrelevant information as facts about the Solar System.
After I'd doffed my hat and coat, I still felt keyed up after the chase, too tense to go to sleep. Restlessly, I moved to my desk, shuffling some papers into a semblance of order.
Holmes snorted.
"Not a scratch."
Mrs Hudson's eyes widened. "However did you know that, Mr Holmes?"
"Oh, no! When I think of the embarrassment and pain any further investigation would bring down on the family... her sister, her brother, myself. No, no, it is impossible. The investigation must stop."
"Certainly that. What is there to be ashamed of?"
"I merely walked past. I assure you, I didn't go inside or do anything foolish. It appears to be a perfectly ordinary establishment."
Holmes took my arm and drew me with him. We trailed the man out of the graveyard, then down into the dark, dangerous hell which was the neighbourhood in the shadow of the Castle. We followed him down a narrow flight of steps, along a grimy, unlit, stinking close, and into a passageway which led under the floors of the buildings above. All around us we could hear the teeming sounds of life: voices raised in anger, babies wailing, dishes and glasses clattering, but the back streets were deserted, and we saw no-one but the shadowy figure of the man ahead.
"O Mensch, bewein' dein' Sünde groß?" I said with a yawn, sitting up. "Bemoan thy grievous sin?"
He stirred, and his eyes flickered open. His face lit into a smile upon seeing me. "Won't you come and sit a while, Watson?"
Lyndale raised a hand in a gesture of greeting, and I realised that the organist must—perhaps through some complex set of mirrors—be able to see us from his lofty perch.
His haggard face betrayed the lie in his words, however.
"Come to bed, Watson?" he said quietly.
"I suppose this is the other room that was occupied last night?" he said, indicating the adjoining drawing room visible through an open pair of double doors. It struck me that with the doors open, the cabinet was visible from a good part of the drawing room, as well as from the entirety of the salon in which it stood.
I glanced back at the door, but it remained closed, as I had taken care to ensure after entering.
Holmes passed it to me across the breakfast table. I stared at the heavy cream-coloured envelope in surprise. I cannot deny that it also gave me a certain ridiculous feeling of pleasure to see our names written thus side-by-side: Dr. J. H. Watson and Mr. S. Holmes.
"We're together now, my love. Don't spoil it by worrying about the future."
I saw he had misunderstood me, and hastened to reassure him. "No, no! I did not mean to suggest that the future you described was unlikely in its entirety - or unappealing."
"You could come with me," I offered. "We could go to the police first, and then - "
He smiled fondly. "I see things are beginning to become clear to you, my dear. I presume you now understand why I said that the profession of the man from Windmyre Close was the key to the matter?"
This did not enlighten me any further. After all, the man in the Gordons' hallway had not been stabbed with a wood-chisel or any such instrument, but shot through the heart.
I appeared in the drawing room half an hour later, dressed for going out. Mildred Gordon was inclined to protest, reiterating that Mr Holmes had instructed her to oversee my well-being. Fortunately for me, my fellow practitioner appeared at this juncture, he who had treated me in the early hours of that morning, and pronounced me entirely fit.
I turned to face him. He was draining some sort of nasty brown liquid from a burette into a basin, and continued to speak without looking at me:
"Oh, that's very credible." His lips twisted in a sneer, but I knew it was not directed at me. "Very credible indeed. So these two men are madly in love, and have shared rooms for almost a year, but it's all perfectly innocent?"
He stiffened. "I'm sorry, I should not have assumed - how presumptuous of me. Do forgive me, Watson."
"Oh?" I looked up, interested.
She hesitated, then shook her head. "I ask you not to do so."
Holmes broke the silence first.
He rarely spoke of his family. I knew his people had been country squires on the south coast somewhere, but the estate had been lost somehow, and both he and his only brother lived in London, supporting themselves. I had never heard anything to indicate that his parents were still alive.
I hastened to reassure him. "It is true that Gordon did always insist on planning carefully for every eventuality, however remote and unlikely. I don't know that I would medically class him as a neurotic, however. In any case, he is an old friend from my Edinburgh school days, now a barrister, and quite rich, as you say - I suppose you got that from the stationery? I was his best man, as a matter of fact, when he married the Mildred he refers to. They were childhood sweethearts."
As Father Briggs had said, they weren't much use to humanity, but then the same could be said of any jewels.
I had no idea what to make of this, but was nonetheless determined to investigate. Fortunately I was already familiar with the location of the street, and lost no time in directing my way thither.
Lyndale gave us a rueful smile. "I would like him to take an interest in the family estates, investments and so on, yes. And he will do so one day, I'm sure, though just now he's speaking of touring the Continent with his friend Mr Huntington." He gave a small laugh. "I was just the same at his age, of course."
I had wondered if she had hoped her father would hold out the hand of reconciliation. It would have been my hope, under similar circumstances. But there was no hope in her voice, only wariness.
"A parcel addressed to my father arrived at the townhouse a few days ago," Lyndale explained.
He refused to say anything more on the subject.
We repaired to a small, quiet public house, where Holmes drank tea while I ordered some of the hearty Scottish fare for which I was at times nostalgic since relocating to England.
"You will never develop your eye if you persist in cheating thus," Holmes said, but mildly, since he was clearly awaiting with curiosity my exposition of the contents of the letter.
"She has—had—an allowance of her own, of course. But I suppose she felt the need for something more, to launch her married life, since she knew herself to be acting, I'm sorry to say, without the approval of her family." He shook his head, the very picture of a discarded, hurt parent. "Her, ah, prospective husband is not a particularly wealthy man. In fact, he already has a wife and two children to support."
I shot him an accusing look. "You saw all this coming, didn't you?"
"You must believe me, Watson, when I say that I do not mean to repulse you heartlessly, nor provoke unfounded judgements in you regarding my nature, which you have in the past described as unfeeling. But I do nonetheless urge you to imagine the look on the face of your upright friend, were he to witness the scene you attempted to enact."
Now we could finally look into the face of the burglar, extortioner and murderer. He was a mild-faced, middle-aged man, slightly overweight, and it was easy to see how he passed in daytime for a respectable cabinet-maker and guildhall member. Only his cold hard eyes spoke of the depths of depravity which lay behind that innocuous mask.
"What should I have said? She is twenty-three years old. In fact 'elope' was a poor choice of word on my part. She simply intends to marry without her family's approval, which is surely no one's business but her own. At least, it's certainly not mine." He took the spoon from where I'd dropped it by the butter dish, and began to spread marmalade on another slice of toast. "However, I would find it convenient were she to wait to disrupt the whole household until
Holmes abandoned the papers and sank into his nearby armchair. He lit his pipe and puffed on it as we sat in silence.
Finally we broke apart, remembering our mission in that dark place.
Lyndale seemed distracted as we left, but he pulled himself together long enough to suggest lunch before we called on the Winstons and the Armstrongs.
I stared. "Holmes, tell me what you have in mind."
Holmes fell silent. So did I, wondering what else he might have noticed that I had not. Maybe someone had secret gambling debts, or some other reason for desperately needing a large sum of money?
"They were given to my grandfather by Cardinal Montserrati in the 18th century for services rendered to the Church," Lyndale added.
He rang the bell, and the maid who had served us our tea reappeared. She was short and portly, and I thought she would have appeared quite amiable, were her eyes not red-rimmed from crying. I wondered what had happened to upset her so.
It struck me as a little odd that Lyndale was sharing so much detail with us, but Holmes did always invite confidence. It was one of the characteristics that made him so successful at his chosen profession.
Mr Nicholas Lyndale nodded. "I can't ask for more than that."
"Well, we cannot speculate any further until this Lyndale provides us with the facts of the matter," said Holmes.
I stood at the foot of the stairs, savouring the sight of him. His long gaunt face was relaxed in sleep as it never was in waking, his ever-active hands still, his body at peace. I was simply glad that we were both here together in Baker Street.
Suddenly I understood what I had already sensed to be wrong, when the shadow that should not have been there moved. I dived back towards Holmes, but not quickly enough. Pain seared through my shoulder, and the world spun around me as I sank to the ground.
"But that's all sewn up! We've arrested the man responsible, Joshua Wilcott, and there's nothing more to it." Lestrade grimaced. "The business turned out to be a great deal less mysterious than it seemed at first sight. To be frank, Dr Watson, I regretted calling Mr Holmes in."
He said it so simply it took my breath away.
After some time I opened my eyes to find Holmes looking at me the same way he had ten minutes earlier, warm and appreciative, almost wondering. I raised my eyebrows, posing a silent question.
He relaxed, and sat back in his chair, stretching out his long, lean legs. "Sometimes I dream that we could be free, one day," he said in a lighter tone. "When we have grown so old and frail that we can no longer run around after the dregs of the underworld, perhaps we shall retire to the depths of the countryside, and live quite alone, without even a housekeeper - no one at all to disturb us. You will write, and I shall - watch birds or grow prize marrows or some such thing, and we shall spend days and nights on end together, without the slightest fear of discovery."
I gritted my teeth. "He is not here, and not likely to walk in at just this moment."
Holmes shrugged. "There is no reason why he ever should know. It seems that he has an entire network composed of people like Margaret Donnelly, from whom he forces collaboration by means of threatening the disclosure of their darkest secret. It could have been any of them, or none. Indeed, the object of our plan for tonight is to capture him without necessitating the testimony of any of his victims. In any case, I already have the police's assurances that they won't prosecute Donnelly or indeed bring her into the trial at all, in gratitude for her cooperation. And being seduced out of wedlock, unlike other supposedly immoral acts, is not a criminal one. There is no reason that the story should ever reach the Gordons' ears."
He sat back, looking smug. "It's quite simple, Watson. We are confronted with an impossible crime—therefore the crime did not occur."
He frowned, but to my surprise he seemed more thoughtful than irritated. "Before Christmas, I must admit," he said slowly, "such actions on your part were what fuelled my dreams and kindled my hopes. But before Christmas, we had nothing to hide but unspoken fantasies. I do not think I am being unreasonable now in recommending caution."
This was followed by a silence. Holmes picked up his hat and gloves.
"I have no interest in learning which architect designed which particular hideous building, or how many times Her Majesty has visited," he said absently, underlining a paragraph in red ink.
"Was she musical?" I ventured.
"Watson—" he began, and then stopped.
"What a peculiar suggestion," he said mildly.
"It seems the dead do not object to us," Holmes said dryly, his hands still holding me close. "They're keeping their silence, at any rate."
I frowned. "Holmes, what is the matter? If you are in a taking because I was hurt again on one of your cases, I assure you, it's nothing serious. Why, if I had stayed here and gone on drinking whiskey, I'd probably be feeling much worse just now!" I laughed, but Holmes did not.
I was in the next chair across, having my hair cut by Mr Willis' assistant, and in the mirror I saw Holmes raise an eyebrow.
Holmes introduced us. "May we take a few moments of your time?"
I had been through the papers before when I filed them, and as far as I remembered Lyndale's name did not appear anywhere in them. Even if he were the owner of some of the warehouses, and a beneficiary of the insurance payouts, that information did not appear in the documents I had. And yet there must be something incriminating in there. Perhaps something that the trained financial experts in the Fraud Division would find.
Our visitor Gregory Lyndale arrived within the hour, accompanied by a gentleman in a cassock, who was introduced as Monsignor Pinet, recently arrived from Rome. Lyndale was a large, portly man. He had a face made to be jovial, but this morning it was cast in lines of worry. His companion appeared a great deal more sanguine, and after shaking our hands he quietly took a seat, allowing Mr Lyndale to do all the talking.
"An excellent idea," I said.
When we had left Lyndale at his home in West Eaton Place that morning, I had not expected to see him again that day, but he called to Baker Street shortly after seven that evening.
The majority of the conversation was dominated by the man, while the girl listened with her head down, her stance mulish, but at one point something seemed to needle her, and she exclaimed: "Murderer! Why should I - "
"Mrs Hudson is expecting us for lunch," I said hopefully.
We had not had a great deal of opportunity to speak alone since the night of Brodie's final burglary, what with the business of the trial, and all the social events the Gordons had wanted to hold or drag us to, in the euphoria of having the origin of the corpse in their hallway explained. I had enjoyed seeing old friends and acquaintances, of course, but I felt all the while the tension of a long-overdue conversation with Holmes ahead.
"Thank God!"
Mrs Smith did not call the housemaid, but showed us out herself.
I saw Holmes suppress a grimace. As he put it, heavy-footed, clumsy-fingered policemen were the last people he wished to see at a crime scene.
"Come, Watson. I have some more questions I wish to put to your Mr. Gordon."
"But there was certainly a crowd present at all times in both rooms," Lyndale interjected.
I was grinning, enjoying the rather incredible image of Holmes tending to something as boring as watermelons. "Do you really think that's very likely, my dear fellow?"
"What does he have to do with this?" Lestrade asked with a frown.
He winced at that. "I feel heartless, nevertheless. My reason tells me that it is wrong to risk ruining your life through my foolishness, even when I am perfectly happy to risk my own life. My reason will always win, Watson, no matter what my heart holds."
"I meant rather that the theme is in disaccord with my feelings of—of contentment, these last few days."
Holmes murmured something noncommittal. "Your son mentioned he was just down from Oxford," he added. "I suppose you'll be involving him more and more in your affairs."
"No, of course not. I had intended for both of us to stay in."
Father Garner nodded. "That is correct. However, he's certainly not an impostor, if that's what you were thinking, Mr Holmes. I met him once before in Rome."
The conversation had suddenly taken a much more profound turn than I had expected. I had simply wanted to know whether he might be inclined to carry on sharing the pleasures of the bed for the foreseeable future.
"I did expect it. When I was a young man, I assumed I would marry a charming young lady. But now..."
We crossed a wide paved yard, the sound of organ music growing stronger all the while. We stepped through the church door, and were greeted by the booming thunder of one of Bach's cantatas. Holmes' face brightened. He can be rather Baroque himself at times.
"Surely they couldn't think we wouldn't notice our things missing?" I objected.
We all trooped downstairs and along the back corridor. The back door gave onto a small yard behind the house. It was hemmed in on all four sides by buildings, but the only windows which overlooked it directly were those of 221b. A small plane tree grew in one corner, and a narrow passage connected it to the mews which ran behind the row of houses.
We had reached Ratcliff Highway on foot by now, and Holmes hailed a cab.
Holmes asked him a few more innocuous questions, but nothing interesting emerged from the answers, as far as I could tell. Holmes thanked him, and we left the soup kitchen.
"But if he doesn't have what he wanted, why stop the charade? Or—" I cast my mind back over this afternoon. "Did he feel you were getting too close to the truth?"
"I shall look forward to it," he said simply.
We had met Georgiana Lyndale only once, at the Lyndale residence the day after the cameo theft. I remembered only a rather quiet girl, and a clear antipathy between herself and her sister. And Holmes had predicted her "elopement", of course. But a thief? I was amazed.
"No," said Holmes. "Your brother did. However, I am here on my own account, not his. You need have no fear, Mrs Smith."
Out of the corner of his eye Holmes was watching Lyndale and Garner, who had drawn ahead of us. Garner was murmuring something to Lyndale, who looked taken aback.
"How horrible! But I don't quite understand. She knows who killed her young man, and kept her silence - and even went on helping his murderer?"
"I have my own reasons for wanting to speak to her. But I'm certainly not going to set her family on her tail." He reached for his hat and coat. "Come, Watson. If you are ready let us leave at once."
I was not foolish enough to let my surprise show on my face, but surprised I was. Joshua Wilcott was one of the key figures in our last case.
It was after midnight by the time we returned to Baker Street. We let ourselves in quietly, careful not to wake Mrs Hudson, and crept upstairs to the sitting room.
A man knelt by the stove in the far corner, shovelling out the grate. He climbed to his feet at our entry, brushing soot off his hands and knees.
"For Mr Nicolas Lyndale, however, it will be otherwise, I fear," Holmes added thoughtfully. "He will not escape marriage."
One did not need to be a detective or a medical doctor to deduce why the two ladies had chosen to spend the evening in such a sedentary fashion: Mrs Spencer was clearly in a condition which must have prompted her family doctor to advise her to exert herself as little as possible. I judged her confinement to be due in less than two months.
I considered this. Had my parents been happily married? I did not think so, but as a child I had never been able to tell, and it was no clearer to me now in hindsight as I looked back with the wisdom of adulthood.
I turned.
He resumed his pacing. "You know perfectly well what the problem is, Watson. On this occasion we were fortunate. The only witnesses to my shocking indiscretion were more interested in the sourcing of their next meal than in the antics of two complete strangers. Next time we shall be under the eyes of your friends the Gordons, or a Scotland Yard inspector."
Lyndale's harried expression had deepened into a frown.
"I have always loved him," she said evenly. "Ever since we met, as you say, and that was several years ago. But it was... difficult to take the final step of leaving everything I had ever known."
I had been brought up in a very plain way myself. "My father would have called them the trappings of Popery."
Once out on the street, we stood together in silence, side-by-side, the crowd swarming around us. It had been raining, and the cabs and delivery carts which passed splashed the pavement before our feet with muddy water. Over everything hung the distinctive malty smell of the city, arising from its many breweries.
"It's your decision, of course, Mr Lyndale," Holmes said.
"This is from Monsignor Pinet, in answer to a note I sent him to request he clarify one small detail."
Holmes stood in the middle of the large living room, and span round once on his heel, taking in everything from the thick new carpet to the glistening white plaster-moulding on the high ceiling.
Holmes was scowling, his dark brows drawn together in frustration. "I know everything now, and yet still the monster eludes me. It is absolutely imperative that I find some way of trapping that fiend. I cannot bear to see him walk free a day longer."
Our first port of call was the Franciscans. They had a new church and a half-built friary on the far side of Clapham Common. It was their first site in London since the Reformation and the dissolution of the monasteries, Holmes informed me on the way there. I knew nothing about friars and friaries, but I presumed Holmes had had some exposure to Catholicism on his mother's side, through his French grandmother.
.. .. .. ..
We soon came to the place I had had in mind, a boatman's hut where I had sheltered once when caught in an unexpected downpour. It was clear that no one had passed this way in months. There were no tracks in the ground before the door, and small climbing plants grew undisturbed by the threshold. Inside there was a wealth of old ropes and crates, and even some mouldering cushions on the wooden bench by the wall. I pushed these aside and sat down, as my leg had been demanding for quite some time now.
Holmes was gone from the bed when I awoke. For a second or two, I wondered whether I ought to take that as a bad sign, an indication of regret or embarrassment on his part.
Over breakfast he read through his stack of newspapers, as usual, while his toast grew cold. As usual I ate it before it was too late, and replaced it with another slice.
Holmes was already pulling on his overcoat. "I intend to get a haircut, Watson. I suggest you do the same."
"No, I must protest, Holmes! You're just playing with semantics. You wouldn't care about ruining my life if you didn't have a heart."
"Indeed. And it's an odd coincidence that a person with such knowledge as his should have been there precisely on the night of the theft." After a reflective pause, he added, "Still, for the moment there's no particular reason to suspect him of anything but an overestimation of his own worth."
"Lyndale should be here at nine. I just hope he leaves the house before his daughter's elopement is discovered."
He did not protest, and so we paid a visit to the senior members of Edinburgh's constabulary, with whom Holmes turned out to have already become quite friendly. He spent a good two hours in deep discussion with them, but finally, when they had reassured him once again that they would follow his instructions to the letter, nothing remained for us to do but wait for night to fall, and we left the station.
"Three hours is a very long time for a common burglar to spend on just one house, don't you think?"
"Yes. I had already guessed as much when Brodie referred to the child in the kirkyard. It is apparently almost a year old now. With her stout figure it was not difficult to conceal her condition from her employers, and when the child was born her sister came up from their village to take care of it. Donnelly supports her and the child in abject poverty on her wages. You can readily comprehend what a disaster it would be for all three of them, were her employers to learn of her supposedly immoral behaviour; they would dismiss her instantly from her position. I expect you can see why her mother's instinct is taking precedence over her desire for revenge on the man who killed her young suitor, although she has shed a great number of tears over him."
"Your brother is concerned about you," Holmes said as we stood on the doorstep. "Your family wonders where you are."
That was something to attract commiseration rather than condemnation, and the same was true for Lyndale and Huntington. If, indeed, Holmes was correct in his characterisation of their relationship. Some people struggled with their desires, but others, perhaps, did not feel any. For them, surely, the platonic ideal was not only a second best. As for Lyndale and Huntington, if they truly felt as Holmes said, then I felt as sorry for them as for my old friend.
He took my breath away. It was one of those rare glimpses of his soul that made up for every unconsciously cruel comment or slight his brutally honest nature inflicted on me. Indeed, they made up for everything a thousand times over, without difficulty.
"And a Protestant, no doubt?"
"I'm quite certain they are still in Lyndale's possession." He smiled at my gasp of surprise. "Lyndale thought he would fabricate a clever little 'impossible crime' to attract my attention and allow him to control our movements. He kept us away from home while his men tried to break into Baker Street, assured that we would be away with Lyndale all afternoon."
"Holmes," I said, gathering my courage. "What are
"Even when those decisions take her away from the Church?"
It was easy to understood why Margaret Donnelly's mysterious correspondent had chosen the graveyard as a meeting place, for it was dark and completely deserted. As Holmes and I installed ourselves behind a sepulchre not far from the gate, we heard a church bell strike quarter to eleven.
"Never fear, Mrs Hudson," I said. "Had they been here ten times longer, they still wouldn't have managed to get in."
"On the contrary, Watson," Holmes said jovially. "On the contrary!"
When we arrived in West Eaton Place, Father Garner was just leaving the Lyndale residence, looking eminently pleased with himself. He gave us a curt nod and swept past us, already hailing a cab.
He paused, scowling, and I knew he was brooding again on the risk we ourselves ran.
I smiled to myself, for I must admit that seeing Holmes betray a flash of jealousy was a guilty pleasure of mine. In this case, clearly, he did not appreciate my being anyone else's 'dear Watson'.
"And yet I suppose it is true."
I ventured a question. "So the maid Margaret Donnelly is deeply involved?"
"You know them, and I trust you."
Holmes folded up the note, looking pleased. "I thought I could rely on Briggs." He glanced at his watch. "Ready for a trip to Camden, Watson?"
.. .. .. .. .. .. ..
"I mean they convince themselves that what they have is not that nasty, sordid, physical kind of love as between other men, but rather something pure and noble... no doubt dressed up in some kind of hogwash about Greek ideals. Sublimating vile carnal desire into wholesome, brotherly love."
Briggs gave him a hard look. "You don't know what you're talking about. Why don't you stick to what you know, Mr Holmes?"
.. .. ..
"About ten years now. It was an endowment from a group of charitable gentlemen. Including Mr Lyndale, whom you know, of course."
He turned to me. The sharp angles of his face were softened in the firelight, his dark eyes fixed on mine. He stood looking at me for a long moment, and the breath caught in my throat.
"Lyndale?" Lestrade echoed.
Holmes raised no objection. He appeared perfectly satisfied.
"I will look for your sister," Holmes said, "but if she does not wish to see you, I won't pass on any information on her whereabouts."
"Yet not so glad to see me quite so soon?" I said, not bitterly, but in a matter-of-fact tone.
"Everything all right, my dear?" he said to his new wife, shooting us a suspicious look.
I leant in to kiss him. His lips were warm under mine, his hands firm as he cradled my head.
Taking a deep breath, I said slowly: "You must promise not to laugh when I manage to write thrilling and romanticised adventure stories of your trials and tribulations with your marrows."
At the mention of house-breaking, Holmes' gaze flickered briefly towards me. I noted the names.
Smith, a surname shared by tens of thousands of other Londoners. Very helpful. I noted it in my notebook nonetheless.
Nicholas Lyndale went red. "I don't know what you mean."
Holmes threw aside the sheets and sprang from the bed. "Come along. It's already almost seven, and I want to be in Limehouse by eight.
Holmes' eyes sparkled. "It seems poor Mr Lyndale has been the victim of two crimes in a row. What a coincidence."
He was a big burly man, and I could easily imagine him holding his own in the boxing ring against the East End toughs. He was not wearing friar's robes, but there was a dogcollar at his neck.
Holmes' lips and cheeks were still cold to the touch, but his tongue was warm as it reached for mine, and his hands on my waist pulled me closer to him.
I knew from my guidebook that this crescent of houses was the latest addition to Edinburgh's magnificent New Town, but I left it to Mr. Mackay to answer Holmes' question.
I scarcely had time to doff my coat and sit down before Mrs Hudson announced Mr Nicholas Lyndale, accompanied by Mr Huntington.
He dropped into his favourite armchair, and reached for his pipe. He did not seem quite as concerned about the matter as it would surely have warranted.
The older of the two children cast us an anxious look and piped up, "Mama, what's the matter?"
"What are you trying to say exactly, Holmes?" I asked carefully.
I decided it would not be advisable to lie there feeling miserable any longer, and determined to rise. I checked my wound cautiously, as well as I could while being the patient as well as the doctor, and gave myself permission to quit my bed.
It was early yet, but then we had gone to sleep very late the previous night.
I did so, and he continued speaking as he leafed through that heavy tome.
He looked at us curiously. "That's right."
"It is a little late for that, Mr Lyndale," Holmes said mildly, as we hauled him to his feet.
He understood the vow of commitment behind the light-hearted words, and his eyes gleamed.
confidence," Nicholas Lyndale said stoutly. "Georgiana knows William, and she knows I trust him as well as I would my own... my own brother."
"She left no note," Lyndale said.
Holmes' eyebrow flickered at that, in a tiny motion certainly perceptible only to me.
His assumption was perfectly correct. I had not voiced my true nightmare, which was that someday I would be too careless, and he would become too impatient, or too scared, and leave me.
It was almost exactly the same response he had given me two days earlier, when I asked him if he suspected any of Lyndale's other guests. I was beginning to feel Holmes thought there was a lot more to this case than the theft of two cameos.
"You look to be in better form now, I'm glad to see. Is everything all right?"
Holmes was the voice of empathy quite as often as I was, but I did not point that out. Nor did I try to prolong the conversation. I was curious about what might have made him speak so, but did not wish to push him on the subject, this fledgling thing between us still too new and raw. "We should get up," I said instead, looking at the clock on Holmes' bedside table. "Mrs Hudson will be serving dinner soon."
"It's, ah, it's about my sister." Lyndale hesitated. Fortified by an encouraging glance from Huntington, he continued, "You may have heard that she, she has left the family home."
"I cannot think of anything I would enjoy less."
"How irritating that such a supercilious man should produce such sublime music," as Holmes said later.
My own taste in music runs along different lines, and I looked around myself as we waited, enjoying the music without letting it take over my mind. The church was considerably more ornate than those I was familiar with: decorated with the trappings of Popery, as my father would have said. We could not see the organist; he was presumably hidden away somewhere up in the choir loft.
I expected Holmes to refuse. He rarely took on cases of this nature. Missing persons affairs were usually mere gruntwork. Moreover, I had formed the impression that he felt Georgiana had good riddance of her family. But to my surprise he said, "Perhaps. What can you tell me about this man she is marrying? Have you ever met him?"
"Well, the son's not married yet, but he's the only son, so he won't be too long about it, I expect." Mr Willis chuckled to himself. "He's not much of a lady's man, poor chap. Always seems to be blushing and stammering, whenever I've seen him. But the whole family is very well-heeled indeed, so I don't suppose he'll have too much trouble getting hitched."
"A fortunate coincidence for us, Mr Holmes," he exclaimed.
After a while I noticed that Holmes was reading along with me, upsidedown. He raised his head when I laid down my pen.
"Quite," said Holmes, while his gaze flickered around the room, absorbing every detail. I devoutly hoped that if he did consider my two friends as members of his list of suspects, something which was perfectly likely, then he would make no awkward comment to betray this fact to them, until such time as he had finally seen fit to clear them of suspicion.
"Yes, it's quite clear they targeted this building."
"My dear Watson! The cabinet-maker is the murderer, of course!"
I tidied the papers on my desk, and put my latest unfinished manuscript into a paper folder along with some blank sheets to write on in the train. Then I sat down in my armchair, idly flicking through an old edition of The Lancet, my mind on other things.
"Don't try to move, my love," he said in a gentler voice, seeing my return to consciousness. He was kneeling beside me, pressing something into my shoulder, which burned unbearably. It was night-time, and the ground beneath me was cold, damp, mossy stone. Slowly, memories returned to me of the late-night assignation we had spied upon in the kirkyard, and the subsequent chase through the town, culminating in my being shot in this grimy courtyard.
After dinner, Holmes wrapped himself in a blanket and took a seat by the fire, looking set to remain there for the next few hours. Despite his own rule about not theorising before he had all the facts, I was quite sure he was thinking about the case.
"It is far from true, Holmes! I believe I know you better than that - despite the evidence you have furnished to the contrary today."
. Inside, the smell of food permeated everything, over-boiled but hot and filling. A collection of handbills pasted on the wall by the door advertised everything from an under-eighteens boxing tournament to a lecture on the principles of vaccination against rabies by the Limehouse Philosophical Society.  An open door on the left of the hallway led to a large dim room filled with long wooden trestle tables. It was early yet, and the room was almost empty. Only a few men sat at the tables closest to the windows, reading old newspapers or talking quietly. On the wall hung a large crucifix, and dotted about the room were effigies of the Virgin Mary, the saints and so on.
I had hesitated too long, and the moment was past. Holmes turned away with a quiet, "Good night, Watson."
For a moment, his face softened, and he made a move as if to come to me, although he stopped himself. "I flatter myself that that is true," he said softly.
Holmes tutted his tongue at me. "Our barber is a Roman Catholic, Watson. Surely you have noticed this?"
Two nights ago we had come home at the end of a perfectly ordinary evening, and started down this path, as simply and easily as though it were always meant to be.
When he first opened his mouth after we left the house, however, it was not to speak of Lyndale, but of another subject.
Holmes clucked his tongue in irritation upon seeing the well-scrubbed hallway floor and the thoroughly beaten-out rug. He spent scarcely a minute looking around, before demanding to see where all the keys in the house were kept. One set lay in a drawer in the hallway, and Gordon indicated the key to the back door, which had been found open on the morning after the murder. Holmes examined the key closely, and to my mind it seemed that he relied far more on the sense of touch than his eyes in his examination, but whatever he was seeking he did not seem to find it.
A few moments later a man in a brown habit appeared at a small door towards the back of the church and directed his steps towards us.
"You don't wish to recover the cameos? I expect I could track down the jeweller or dealer Miss Georgiana will have sold them to."
"Most of the buildings along this wharf belong to the Lyndale family, I believe?" Holmes commented. This was news to me.
Holmes had risen and started reading long before I had, and I was still on the Times' Letters to the Editor when he laid aside his final newspaper and glanced at his watch.
"My goodness," I said, my head spinning. Now that I had overcome my initial shock, I quite agreed it was none of our business, and wished the lady well, but I could not help wishing some solution were possible with a happy ending for all parties involved. Every party suffers in family estrangements.
I thought I could be happy with Holmes—if he felt the same way.
"Mrs Smith, I'm afraid I need to ask you a personal question," Holmes said gently. "You have known Mr Smith for several years now. His children know you well, indeed are on intimate terms with you. He has proposed marriage to you before. Why have you finally decided to accept him now?"
"Well, you're certainly doing a bloody good job of driving me away." I said it gently, taking his hand in mine and kissing it.
Out on the street, Holmes turned to me. "It's time to act, Watson. Do you take those two names to Lestrade at Scotland Yard, and have him bring the men in for questioning. I have no doubt they are recidivists and well known to him."
Her brother blinked, taken aback. "I'm not. I mean, I won't. I mean—But you must see this from Father and Sarah's point of view."
"The younger sister's not married yet either, but the older one is." He moved around to the other side of Holmes' head. "She married a convert, and I expect you know what they say about converts, Mr Holmes."
"Indeed," he murmured. "And the sisters?"
He began by kneeling to examine the deadlock. I held a pocket-lantern to light his work, and watched him peer through the key-hole and scratch at its brass plate with his fingernail, before turned to the door casing to examine the striking plate. There were two other locks on the door, of different designs, which received a similarly close examination. His final objects of study were the door jamb and hinges.
"The friar who runs the place allows a philosophical society the use of an upstairs room in the building. They give talks on various secular subjects, I believe. I accompanied Georgiana there once... something about steam engines. I only went once, but I believe she went often while I was up at Oxford. She mentioned a man she had met there, by the name of Smith, or something similar. He gave a talk about railway engineering, if I remember correctly."
"I might very well have that final detail," I said, handing him the note from Margaret Donnelly.
"Then you'd have to ask my man of business, I'm afraid. But he's away at the moment, unfortunately, making a tour of my estates. He may be gone several days."
"You also have many business interests here in London, I understand," Holmes said, and though his tone was casual, something in his posture told me the question was not.
Lyndale's eyes widened. "Oh! Of course, of course. I am most anxious... Please sit down."
He went on in a low voice. "I behaved unforgivably last night. I don't know how much of it you were conscious for, but unfortunately there were many other perfectly conscious witnesses - which is the problem, of course." He began to pace up and down the room. "I lost my head completely. All I knew at the time was that you were bleeding and unconscious, and I could not bear not to cradle you in my arms. I don't even remember clearly - I only remember how terrible you looked, and how terrified I was. I'm sure I used several incriminating terms of endearment out loud, fool that I am!"
Fortunately, Lestrade was there when I arrived. I passed on Holmes' request, and saw him carry it out, then waited with him in his office for Holmes' arrival.
Later, we lay in rumpled sheets, warm and sated. After some time, Holmes sat up to light a cigarette. It seemed this was a habit of his, afterwards—or so I had observed on the previous occasions we had indulged.
I could now see the man's face. It was Lyndale.
Holmes interrupted. "Who is this fellow, Watson? Besides the obvious: that he is Scottish, fairly well off, and neurotic."
We sat in comfortable silence for a long time, wrapped in each other's arms. Notwithstanding the lack of resolution, I felt the better for our talk, although my contentment was tinged with trepidation when my thoughts turned to the deadly risk I intended to take later that night.
Finally he looked down at his watch. "I am going out now."
He stared down at me, as intently as if I were a footprint or a scribbled cipher. It was a gaze I had learnt to take as a compliment. Finally he said abruptly:
"Miss Lyndale is a twenty-four-year-old woman who can make her own decisions," Briggs said instead of answering.
So far only circumstantial evidence linked him to the Cable Street case, and there was nothing at all to link him to the attempted burglary at Baker Street.
"If you wish me to leave you alone, Holmes - "
Holmes stilled, his gaze fixed on my face.
I frowned. It seemed unsatisfactory, but there was nothing we could do.
He was already deep in the world of murderers, hangmen and hauntings again, and did not answer. I kissed the top of his head, and went to pack a small suitcase for myself, and another for Holmes. When I returned to the sitting room, he was busy in the corner of the room where his chemistry equipment was set up. I hoped that he was closing down his experiments, and making everything safe for an extended absence.
I felt him briefly and silently grip my arm in the dark, before we all settled in for the wait, the atmosphere fraught with tension.
He was still standing much too far away from me, his face whiter and more haggard than could be accounted for simply by the sleepless night he had most likely passed.
"You're asking me to testify against my own father," she said in a low voice.
The three of us ate together at the Criterion in Piccadilly Circus. Over lunch, Holmes refused to speak of the case at all. He engaged Lyndale in a conversation about the organ music of Pachelbel, and then, when Lyndale proved to have little to say on the subject, moved on to recent events in the Sudan.
He looked up sharply. "You have already been there?"
"Quite. But you may tell Lestrade it doesn't matter whether he can get them to confess to attempted burglary at Baker Street or not. That's immaterial. They simply need to be off the streets and immobilised for the next twenty-four hours."
Since we embarked on this affair a month earlier I had been holding back, unsure what Holmes wanted, and unwilling to speak unless he did. But now I saw he had been doing the same thing. One of us had to take a leap of faith. "Perhaps I've already found what I was looking for."
.. .. ..
He dropped my arm, and in a few swift steps he had caught up with the other two. I was forced to hurry after him.
The owners of the house had dared to venture onto the scene by this time, and we thanked them for their cooperation and apologised for disarranging their library and disturbing their sleep, while the police marched Brodie away.
Lyndale nodded.
Holmes nodded, seemingly satisfied.
I laughed, my cheeks heating. "I wouldn't say
I attempted to choose my words carefully, something which was not facile when all I longed for was to grasp him to me, and hold him without speaking. "Aren't you overreacting in the heat of the moment? What precisely does this change? We have always known the risk we run, after all, and I, for one, maintain that you are afraid of something that will never occur." Unable to touch him, I tried to pour all of my feelings into my words. "What's more, it is perfectly ridiculous to describe yourself as egoistical. There are two of us in this, Holmes, and I assure you, you are not risking my name and liberty, as you put it, without my heartfelt consent. Not that it is a risk that weighs heavily on my mind, when the happiness we bring each other so easily outweighs it."
The Gordons had also invited some acquaintances around, and we had a pleasant after-dinner conversation. After some time I looked about me and noticed that Holmes was nowhere to be seen. Most likely he had simply tired of making polite conversation with the bourgeoisie of the Lowlands and slipped discreetly away.
I followed him down the stairs and out onto the street, the excitement of the journey already mounting in me, and my nightmares of earlier in the evening entirely forgotten. I could not think of anything better at that moment than returning to my native city with the man who loved me by my side.
We were interrupted—fortunately or unfortunately—by a knock at the door: the return of Mrs Hudson's new girl, who'd forgotten to ask whether we'd be in for lunch and dinner. By the time I'd dealt with her, Holmes was—or appeared to be—deep in a newspaper he'd already read.
Holmes marched up the steps to the Lyndale's townhouse and rang the bell. We were shown into the drawing room. Lyndale appeared after a moment. He greeted us warmly, but there was something superficial in his welcome. He seemed bothered and distracted, and I wondered to what extent that was connected with Father Garner's visit.
.. .. ..
He unfolded it quickly, and his face lit up. "Excellent."
"Stay inside, all of you, if you please," Holmes instructed us when we reached the back door. "Watson, hold the lantern for me, will you?"
"Of course. Father Garner told me to expect you and to answer any questions you might have about that evening at Mr Lyndale's." He wiped his sooty hands on a cloth. "You'll excuse me if I don't shake hands."
Holmes shot him a long considering look. "And what role do you play in this, Mr Huntington?"
He looked surprised, as though he had not himself realised what he was unconsciously singing. "We heard the music yesterday on the organ at the Franciscan friary. What a thing to be singing under these circumstances." He gestured at the two of us, the rumpled sheets and the traces of the previous night.
"How can we help you, Mr Lyndale?" Holmes asked as soon as they were seated. "Your note was not particularly explicit."
After, I closed my eyes and stretched out luxuriously, enjoying the warmth of the bed and Holmes' favourite past-time of running his fingernails gently over my chest. After some time his fingers descended to my stomach, and their movement became slower and more exploratory. Indeed, he almost seemed to be poking and prodding me in a thoughtful, clinical fashion, reminding me that my stomach was already showing the signs of a year of peacetime living and abundant London fare.
Holmes arrived at five o'clock precisely. "Are those men behind bars?" was his first question.
As we arrived at the door that led to the soup kitchen, a crowd of people were streaming out into the street. There were all sorts: dockers, lightermen and bargemen, a handful of clerks from the nearby shipping offices, a pair of nuns, and vagabonds from the streets.
He said in a cold, even voice which was entirely at odds with his anguished eyes: "I rather think we should begin as we mean to go on, don't you?" Saying these word, he walked out.
My mind was filled rather with the details I had just heard of the case. "Isn't there a risk that Brodie will divulge her secret anyway when he knows he was betrayed by her?"
He stared at me in amazement. "You make this incredibly courageous offer, without knowing any of the details, any of the reasons that make it worthwhile - "
"My dear Watson, my theories are not yet fully formed," he demurred, with a wave of his hand. "But tomorrow will bring new developments in the matter. I guarantee it."
"We shall see in..." Holmes looked at his watch. "Three hours' time."
"But now...?" he echoed. His voice had been quiet, but in his gaze I saw the importance he accorded to my words.
"Or who was a lockpick," I put in.
I spent a pleasant day talking of old times, and returned to the Gordons' in time for dinner, arriving not long before Holmes. Our hosts seemed much happier now that Holmes was attending to their case, although if he had made any progress during the afternoon he had not shared it with the rest of us.
Holmes said in a reassuring voice, "I have not come to you today on behalf of your family. All that is none of my business. I'm here because of a case I have been working on for several weeks, concerning a series of robberies and arson attacks in Limehouse."
"And what changed your mind? What pushed you to take that final step?"
"What on earth?" I burst out as soon as we were out of earshot.
Lyndale, Armstrong and Winston were under investigation for insurance fraud. They were not currently in gaol, because people of their class generally did not suffer imprisonment, at least not while under suspicion for that type of crime. But I had faith that justice would eventually be done. Besides that, we had not received any news of the case in recent days.
He rose to his feet, and we followed suit. After Lyndale had taken his leave of us, I sat back down by the fire, shaking my head in dismay.
Mrs Spencer had told us in no uncertain terms that she did not know where her sister Georgiana was, and did not wish to discover it.
"I know a little more than you think," Holmes said quietly. "In any case, I'm not here on behalf of her family, though it's true that her brother is worried about her. I'm looking for Miss Lyndale because I have a few questions of my own to ask her."
"Why do you say that?"
.. .. ..
His glorious body was spread before me, long and pale in the soft glow of the gas lamp. I ran a hand lightly down his flank, feeling him shiver under my touch.
Holmes' eyes were bright. "A marriage has many facets," he said slowly. "You are already my trusted companion, my esteemed colleague, my right-hand man. The most gloriously handsome man I know. My deepest desire. My dearest friend. In short, everything. I want you to be everything to me."
Holmes was as white as he had been earlier, and his eyes had not left my face since I arrived. He seemed to be wondering whether I would stalk away or punch him in the face. I did neither, of course.
Lestrade offered me a chair and a cigarette. "You say this is to do with my arson case on the riverfront in Limehouse?"
"I've been out all day," she said. "And it's the maid's day off, you know."
, I thought.
"Bed," I said, swallowing around the impatience in my throat that threatened to overwhelm me.
I felt fingers on my breast and Holmes withdrew my pocket watch and held it out briefly to a patch of moonlight to read it. He swore softly. "Three minutes to eleven. That was all too brief an interval."
She did not answer immediately. Mr Smith's hand was tight on her shoulder. She put her own hand up to cover it.
Mrs Smith watched my pen move across the page. She was deathly pale now. "I cannot testify in court, Mr Holmes," she said desperately.
"The cabinet was locked at the start of the evening?" Holmes asked.
"I have something of a very delicate nature to say to you, Mr Holmes. I'm sure I can rely on your discretion."
He grinned at me. Gone was the aloof, unapproachable marble sculpture of this morning, and in its place this high-spirited, keen-edged fellow, eyes sparkling with enthusiasm.
He laid aside Who's Who, and I rose to put the book away, for I had learnt from experience that Holmes would leave it lying there untidily for days. When I turned away from the bookshelves, it was to find him watching me closely.
I noticed he did not mention what the rest of the family thought. I wondered what they made of Huntington. Nothing in particular, perhaps. There was nothing unusual in a young man having one close male friend, especially in the school and university years.
"I know," he said shortly. "It's merely a flesh wound. The doctor will certainly authorise you to leave your bed already this afternoon."
"It is the address of a cabinet maker's," I added.
My mind raced, scrabbling desperately for the words to derail his mind from these inexorable tracks, but I knew that I could not, for that would have been the equivalent of convincing him he did not love me.
He smiled bitterly. "Ah, but then you are an optimist, my dear Watson." His eyes were bright, and pain was written in every line of his rigid stance.
"Joshua Wilcott?" Lyndale echoed when Holmes asked him if he knew the name. "It doesn't ring a bell."
Constable Boyle, as requested by Holmes, was a stout fellow with broad shoulders, taller even than Holmes himself. He set off from our rooms carrying a cardboard file folder under one arm. Holmes, Lestrade and I followed him at a discreet distance.
.. .. ..
He closed his own book, and placed one hand over mine. "I want to be as close to you as humanly possible," he said simply, "and how can I be any closer than if we are reading the same page, our minds thinking the same thoughts?"
His lips were pressed together in a thin line, whether from discomfiture or merely because he was deep in thought, I could not tell. In fact, I had no idea at all what was passing through his mind.
I knew what the word 'recusant' meant, but I also knew better than to interrupt Holmes when he was in full flow.
"A reproduction of El Greco's Adoration of the Shepherds, I believe, Watson."
"Under his influence, she has become very hardline, very strict," Willis went on. "Doesn't get on with the sister and brother, I hear."
Holmes smiled. "I know. I'm looking at one such specimen now."
He turned away to swap the scrapbook he held for another from the pile balanced precariously on his bedside table.
"I see," said Holmes, mollified. "Please go on."
"You're reading my novel!" I exclaimed.
"And what about you, Watson?" he asked quietly. "Do you expect to marry someday?"
"I must admit to being somewhat mystified by your enjoyment of time spent in the company of your friends. Or should I say rather - those people you call your friends, although they know nothing whatsoever about the most important aspect of your life, and would instantly sever connections, were they ever to discover it."
"I am afraid you must think my depth of feeling is less than your own, when that is far from being the case. Indeed it could not be deeper." He had begun to pace back and forth, but now he came to a halt, and stood looking down at me, one hand pressed to his temple.
"Wait a moment," I murmured before stepping forward cautiously, my revolver in my hand, and all my senses on alert.
"One day, Watson," he said over his shoulder, "I shall take you to visit the settings of my own youth. I spent a large part of my formative years on the Continent, you know."
"Ha!" he exclaimed. "Here's a thing, Watson. Mr Gregory Lyndale will call on me at 11 o'clock this morning, if it be convenient to me." He glanced at the clock on the mantlepiece. "Well, it's ten past ten now, and I am at home and have already finished all my newspapers, so I suppose we may say it is convenient to me. Quick, Watson, hand me Who's Who."
"Dinner at Simpson's?" he asked without looking round.
"You see an attempt to loosen the bars, Watson, which Doris noticed. No attempt to saw through the bars, though, which suggests they hoped they could accomplish their purpose in as unobtrusive a manner as possible, removing the bars and replacing them on their departure, when they found they couldn't get through the door."
"Those burglars!"
Holmes smiled ruefully. "Not exactly. It is frustrating when some minor details come to pass in a different manner than one had predicted."
The Lyndales kept a townhouse on West Eaton Place. At three o'clock that afternoon we were shown into a magnificent, marble-floored entrance hall, and thence to the library, where Mr Lyndale awaited us.
He still had his back to me as he went on: "I love you, Watson, so much so that it renders me egoistical. I can no longer justify risking your liberty and good name thus, simply to gratify my own irrepressible desires. Such a scene as I enacted last night can never have the opportunity to occur again."
"I can't see anything amiss myself, Mr Holmes," Mrs Hudson said, sounding apologetic. "But Doris insisted, and what with all these burglaries recently..."
This was the first time we had spoken, even obliquely, about what we were doing here.
I had intended it as a joke to counter his. I hadn't expected to actually receive another crumb of knowledge about my friend, to add to the tiny amount of information I had hoarded up.
The expression on his face was worth putting myself in the line of fire a thousand times.
I smiled to myself at this high-handedness, hoping I would indeed find Lestrade to be available at the Yard.
Whenever I raised my head from my work I could see Holmes curled up in his chair, gazing into the fire, clearly deep in thought.
"Oh yes, they were very thorough indeed," said Lyndale, with the satisfaction of the honest citizen who sees the forces of the law in the enthusiastic performance of their duty.
"There were several other men," she said slowly. "My father's man of business employed them, but I know they were up to no good—I didn't know what exactly. They never came to the house, but I saw them at the soup kitchen, and I saw them with Joshua Wilcott. They didn't only speak of arson, but also of burglary. House-breaking. One was called Ozbitt, I believe. Another was called Parker."
It was some ten minutes short of one o'clock when I reached Wyndmire Close, which was in the Old Town, in the shadow of the looming hulk of rock from which the Castle rose. Number 5 was a perfectly innocuous cabinet maker's establishment. I walked past twice, debating whether to go inside and investigate further, but my musings were interrupted by the sound of the one o'clock gun from the Castle above, and I knew I would have to hurry to reach the Cathedral before Holmes abandoned the rendezvous.
After an hour or so, my work was done. I gathered up the papers and put them in the safebox where Holmes kept his most confidential documents.
Ten minutes more brought us to our destination. Mildred Gordon was a little plumper than I remembered, with the tired, shadowed eyes of three sleepless nights. My old school-friend Gordon himself was already grey and balding, although in his early thirties, scarcely older than I.
"Now a quick trip to see Lyndale," he said as we climbed in. "After that I suggest a quiet afternoon in."
"No. But when I asked him whether Lyndale knew in advance that Pinet had an interest in cameos, he must have put two and two together on the spot, and decided to lie to us, and go in for a spot of blackmailing instead." He folded up Pinet's letter and returned it to its envelope. "A minor point, but one always likes to tie up loose ends."
He smiled faintly. "I wholeheartedly agree. But I find it surprisingly difficult to be rational about anything when it comes to you, my dear."
His tone made me long even more than ever to take him in my arms, but I remained where I was, gazing at him helplessly.
it read. He had enclosed the address.
Holmes spoke at the same time. "I've come to apologise."
That was when Holmes surprised me by bending his head for one last kiss before he rose.
He obliged me with an answer. "I was just thinking how comfortable you are in your own skin. Uninhibited."
"Married?" Holmes prompted.
"Thank you, sir. It's very kind of you, but I'm fine." She looked down at the pile of sheets, biting her lip. "Your friend, Mr Holmes - he offered to help me too. Not with hay-fever, of course, but with - " She came to a confused halt. "He seems a good man too. Is he - can I - ?"
"You evidently have something on your mind, some matter which is related to your preference regarding this evening's plans. It's not the first time you have made such a request, with that particular tone of voice and that particular look on your face."
I presumed she did not want Mrs Spencer or her father to have her new address. I had not seen enough of Lyndale's true face to know how he would treat her, but I could well imagine Mrs Spencer's icy tirade.
"My father informed me of what happened yesterday evening, yes," she said coldly, "and of the irrevocable step Georgiana has taken. You seem to know all about our family affairs already, Mr Holmes, so I won't scruple to tell you that this business with the cameos is simply all of a piece with Georgiana's other regrettable acts. That man is clearly a horrific influence on her."
He took the cue. "I know almost all of the facts of the case. Only one detail remains to be determined before the whole matter is clear before me. That will only be the commencement of the work, however, for I still have no way at all of proving the matter satisfactorily in a court of law."
"That will be for the Financial Fraud Division to say. But I believe it's safe to say that it's insurance fraud on a large scale."
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
This earned me another smile. "I'm glad you noticed that, Watson. Not that it was very easy to miss, but nevertheless your Alistair Gordon seemed completely oblivious. Either that, or he simply does not care." He tapped out his pipe into an ashtray on the dresser and went back to frowning out the window. "As usual, Watson, I am reduced to trying to pick up the start of a trail that has already long since been washed away, dried out and tidied up. Sometimes it seems to me that my clients deliberately wait to call me, in order to make the life of a consulting detective as difficult as possible."
I didn't know what they said about converts, but Holmes nodded his head wisely.
Although I agreed, I said cautiously: "Even though she was an accessory to so many crimes?"
He started, but did not deny it. "And perfectly dreadful it is too. No wonder you cannot manage to master any skills of any use, when you are cluttering your head with such rubbish."
I began to read aloud:
"Surely the servants—" He broke off, shaking his head and looking chagrined. "Oh, I don't know what to think! All of my servants have been in my employ for several years at least, and I am extremely reluctant to point the finger at any of them."
Neither of us alluded to the events of the previous evening. The only words we exchanged were about the cameos, and I was just as reluctant as he seemed to be to change that state of affairs. It was cowardly of us, perhaps, but I was rather grateful that a case should have intervened at just this time.
Lestrade's eyes widened. "You'll have to give me more to go on than that, Mr Holmes."
How does one behave when waking for the first time in the bed of one's dearest friend?
"No, please - " He stopped. "That is, as you wish. I perfectly understand it if you would rather not be in my company at the moment."
I was relieved to see him still there when I arrived, standing on the Cathedral steps. He came down the steps towards me, his face unfathomable, but there was no mistaking the sincerity in his voice when he said:
"Cabinet makers!"
He came slowly, and sat down beside me.
I wished that he would come over and seat himself on the bed, so that I could put my arms around him, so miserable and angry he looked. "Please don't torture yourself so, my dear man! I assure you, I would have reacted in exactly the same manner."
"As for me, I have seeds of information to plant in certain ears. You may tell Lestrade I shall see him at Scotland Yard at four o'clock this afternoon to explain the plan to him."
He gave me a small, unreadable smile.
Holmes smiled. "It's quite simple. I have let it be known, through certain channels, that the papers from our Limehouse arson case will no longer be held at Baker Street. A constable will pick them up this evening and take them to be held securely at Scotland Yard."
"Yes, of course." Lyndale picked up the bottle of wine. "Another glass, Mr Holmes?"
I took a deep breath, and plunged into the gathering storm. "It's nothing, really, I assure you. It's merely - sometimes, when we're in public, and I touch your shoulder without thinking, or smile at you in a particular fashion, or - oh, a thousand other unconscious gestures! - you look at me in a way that turns me cold. And this, even though in many cases they are things I have been doing since we first met, and things to which you never objected, before Christmas."
Huntington entered first, followed by Lyndale, who looked as awkward and embarrassed as his father had the previous evening.
"After him, Watson!" Holmes cried, and we took off in hot pursuit, while Lestrade went to Boyle's aid, blowing his police whistle as he ran.
All of this was noted with the part of my brain which Holmes tried continually, with some small success, to render as observant as his, but they were mere incidentals. The central part of my attention was concentrated on the man beside me, and I knew without needing to look that the same could be said of him.
"The idea does go against the grain somewhat, Watson, but I find I cannot let you go blindly into danger tonight, without knowing precisely why."
"Watson," Holmes said softly.
Willis' eyes widened, and he looked so excited I was glad he was no longer wielding a pair of scissors around Holmes' ears.
"I've lost a lot of blood," I said vaguely.
"Yes, it is rather a puzzle, isn't it? Almost insoluble, wouldn't you say, Watson?"
Holmes remained upright in the middle of the floor. Although he must have been ruminating on what he would say throughout our walk, it nevertheless took him a few moments to begin hesitantly to speak.
We had only spent ten minutes or so in the company of Mrs Spencer and her sister, Georgiana Lyndale, but even I had had no trouble detecting that the cordiality with which they addressed each other was a very thin veneer indeed.
"Now, Watson, you should be in bed," Holmes said.
"Indeed," Lyndale said. "A man several decades older than her. A railway engineer of some kind, I believe."
"Not at all, Mr Holmes," Boyle said cheerfully.
In the cab on the way home I perused my notes, eager to complete them while the details were still fresh in my mind. I could hardly keep everyone straight in my head, so many people had we seen or heard about today. I made out a careful list of those we still had to interview tomorrow: the Winston family, the Armstrongs, and the Franciscans friars.
"I've been out in Chiswick, at the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society. My sister received two tickets for the flower show from a friend."
"Fine," he said, already turning back to the Leibig condenser he was cleaning. "As you prefer."
"No. Briggs is not involved, that much is certain. As for Garner, he is blackmailing Lyndale, and that would not make sense if he were involved in the original crime."
As he entered the room, Georgiana rose to her feet and looked at him warily. Before he could say a word, she burst out, "I'll tell you now, Nicholas, I shan't listen to anyone telling me to repent, or insulting my husband."
"Perhaps we may start in the salon where the theft occurred," Holmes suggested.
"Quite, yes. Not only religious music, of course. She played piano, and the violin."
"Who was prevented from going by some last-minute impediment?"
Suddenly Holmes' voice emerged from his corner, making me jump. "What is it, Watson?"
"Do go on," he said.
"He's in
Garner shrugged. "I cannot speak for everyone, of course, but I believe the subject first arose when we arrived at Mr Lyndale's residence."
"Watson." There was an edge to Holmes' voice I had heard only a handful of times before.
His breath was still coming in short gasps, and even as he straightened and turned towards the gate, he left his hand resting on the small of my back.
Later that evening, in fact, we had an interesting conversation about Mr Huntington and the younger Mr Lyndale—but I get ahead of myself.
"Very well." I ventured to add, "I presume you think they're the men who tried to burgle us?"
I was not sure how much she knew about the events the previous night had dealt us after her departure from the kirkyard, but she certainly seemed to have taken something to heart. A host of questions flooded into my head regarding her covert meeting the previous evening with the man who subsequently shot me. I did not quite yet feel up to giving her a coherent quizzing, however, so I instead raised myself up in bed and took in my surroundings.
"Family drama bores me, Watson, except insofar as it provides a motive for crime."
Holmes shot me a pleased smile. "Precisely, Watson. Tonight will be Lyndale's last chance to get hold of those papers, and I've made sure he knows it."
Only snippets of the conversation reached our ears, but enough to determine that it revolved around the topic of the 'two men from London' and 'that foul-up the other night.'
On the one hand, we had the breath-taking expanse which was the south side of Edinburgh's main thoroughfare, where the ground all along that side of the road fell away sharply to lush green pleasure gardens and then rose steeply to the lofty spires and towers of the university's New College, the Bank of Scotland and the imposing mass of the Castle, all posed high on the sheer volcanic cliffs which rose from the valley separating us from them.
"Father Briggs, I presume?" Holmes said.
I could not help but be hurt. Instead of pointing out my status as a qualified and experienced doctor, I said in a cold voice: "Nobody was forcing you to read it."
We arrived back at Baker Street about an hour before dinnertime. I closed the sitting room door behind me, and hung my outer clothing on the coatstand, then stepped aside to allow Holmes to do the same.
He held out his hand, in the space between our armchairs, and I reached out to clasp it in mine.
It was not until that night, when we were installed with two stout policemen in our hiding place in one of Edinburgh's most luxurious town-houses, that Holmes made an oblique reference to our earlier conversation.
I nodded.
"Precisely. He is a cabinet maker. Why, his profession is central to the entire conundrum!"
"But Watson, it is such a golden opportunity for a long-term study! Why, I could take repeated measurements over - four or five decades at least! You cannot deny me this contribution to the advancement of knowledge."
"Your position, Mr Lyndale, is that of a man who has just assaulted an officer of the law."
"We know almost nothing about the gentleman in question," Huntington put in.
He smiled and leant close to kiss me, long and slow and appreciative.
"Holmes," I said sternly. "I can promise you that is one thing that will not happen."
In the pause that followed, we both digested the other's words.
.. .. ..
After a few minutes, the mattress shifted beneath me. I heard the click of Holmes' cigarette case, and then the sound of a match being struck. I opened my eyes. Holmes was sitting up in the bed, looking down at me with an affectionate half-smile. His hair stood up in disheveled tufts, his cheeks still flushed, his collar askew. He held out his cigarette case to me, but I shook my head. I simply wanted to drink in the sight of him like that.
Holmes never seemed to notice when he had said something earth-shattering. On this occasion, he slid himself out from behind me, and stretched languidly, treating me to an excellent view of his long lean back. Still overwhelmed by his words, I reflected with regret that that night we would be sharing our second-class carriage with four others.
"That's right."
Briggs frowned, but said finally, "Very well. I shall contact Miss Lyndale myself, and if she agrees, I will send you her address."
"It's addressed to you too, Holmes," I said, rather stupidly.
"The cameos... were not stolen?"
Lyndale cleared his throat. "The fact is, my daughter Georgiana has eloped, this very afternoon. And it is now clear to me that she was behind the theft of the cameos, in order to finance her, ah, her departure from the home. She left a note explaining her actions."
"I find myself frustrated by a lack of information. I haven't yet met most of the potential suspects."
.. .. ..
"I'm turning in, Holmes," I announced.
"Oh! Of course."
Holmes raised his eyebrows. "I believe Miss Lyndale is of age, and her own mistress? I understand from your father that the marriage won't be valid in his eyes, but it is valid under English law."
Holmes seemed unperturbed by our lack of success with Mrs Spencer. He hailed a cab and directed the cabbie to Limehouse.
"The same is true for every potential thief. What sane thief would steal the cameos, instead of the silverware or jewellery?" He was seated in the armchair opposite me, and now he leant forward, his eyes intent. "Something else is behind this, Watson. Something smells. I believe a scandal is being covered up which could rock the financial fabric of London City."
"But what is in those papers?"
Before I could compose a response, he had already hailed a cab. "Go ahead, enjoy your afternoon, my dear fellow. I promise you, nothing interesting will happen until tonight, and perhaps not even then."
Before I could dwell too much on the matter, however, he appeared in the doorway, already shaved and half-dressed, and carrying a water jug.
She remained very still, but her face had turned pale, and I could see she understood the reference.
"And the case?"
"I quite agree," he said finally.
"If I can help at all - I have my medical bag with me."
He stood by the fireplace, lit only by the faint red glow of the embers. I could feel his gaze on me. I stepped forward to stand before him, and he reached out to cup my cheek in one hand.
"The mainstay of his trade, if we can put it in such terms, is burglary. But he is doing something far more cruel and horrible than merely depriving the rich of their wealth. He is at the centre of a web filled with poor trapped flies like Margaret Donnelly, who must jump at his every command, their lives no longer their own.
When the maid came to clear away the breakfast things, she also brought the post. Along with the letters was a telegram, which Holmes opened first.
Soon he too was grinning foolishly. "We're only just beginning, you and I," he said in a voice tinged with awe. Then his expression segued into into something much more earthy. "That will be an awful lot of sleepless nights," he added in his lowest voice, lowering himself down onto me and capturing my mouth with his.
As we sat by the fire that night, I wondered aloud, "Do you think Mrs Smith will be happy?"
"It seems to me to be the impossible crime! There are far too many witnesses, and even an expert lockpick cannot do his work in the blink of an eye."
That afternoon, when I returned to Baker Street with two second-class sleeper tickets in my pocket, I found Holmes pouring over an Ordnance Survey map of Edinburgh. A cheap guidebook to the city lay open on the desk beside him. I was surprised, for I had never seen my friend prepare with such thoroughness for a case whose interest he had not yet even determined, and I said as much.
Holmes looked at his watch. "Now, I hope you don't mind, Watson, but we shall have to vacate our rooms for a few hours this morning. I have offered Mrs Georgiana Smith the use of our sitting room. A neutral ground, if you will, where she can receive her brother.
"I have the fakes with me," said Lyndale. "And here is a page clipped from a collector's pamphlet depicting the originals."
Our first port of call was Miss Lyndale's married sister, Mrs Spencer. Our visit was brief, and we left the Spencers' house in Montague Square with righteous anger and bitterness ringing in our ears.
"I believe this must be Mrs Smith on the stairs now," Holmes added, at the sound of footsteps.
I watched through half-closed eyes as he settled himself back against the pillows and began to blow smoke up towards the ceiling. His gaze grew softer, and a thin line appeared between his brows. It was clear to me that his mind was back on the case again.
In the drawing room, we met the owners of some of the other names on the list. Mrs Catherine Tyndrum, a widow almost out of mourning, was clearly a particular friend of Mrs Spencer, the married daughter of the family. Mrs Spencer, her husband and her friend were sitting with Georgiana Lyndale, the unmarried daughter of the house.
Lyndale shot him a grateful look. "Mr Huntington is my closest friend."
He winced visibly. "I admit that the resolutions of whose soundness I have spent the past two hours trying to convince myself are threatened by the mere sight of your person. I should be thinking about the case, for I am at a critical juncture, and yet I cannot keep anything in my mind for more than three seconds at a time but you. Watson, I - " He stopped, making a quick, despairing gesture with one thin hand. "The high street is no place for such a conversation."
"Well, perhaps I should allow Monsignor Pinet to tell the story, since it's thanks to him that we even know there is a story to tell."
A cold feeling of dread was beginning to seep through my chest, as the inklings of what Holmes had in mind started to become clear to me.
Lyndale looked embarrassed. "I'd like to keep that private, Mr Holmes. It contains details best kept within the family... the ragings of a poor upset child against her family. I'm sure you understand."
"Oh?" I said, for I had not noticed anything of the sort between them. Indeed, I was not even quite sure if he meant what I thought he did. "You mean to say—?"
"That's how you came to play the violin?"
"I don't believe he's blackmailing Lyndale for money," Holmes said. "But nevertheless, your criticism stands."
"Three o'clock, Holmes?" I asked as soon as our visitors had left. "You have other plans for between then and now?"
Fortunately for the state of all our nerves, Brodie soon made an appearance. He recognised me the moment I stepped out of the shadows into the beam of his lantern, but he did not seem in the slightest bit ruffled. Instead he aimed coldly with the pistol which was already in his hand, and it was all I could do to dive out of the way in time, the bullet missing me by a hair's breadth. Holmes and the police then leapt on him from behind, and all was confusion and noise for a minute, a chaos of grotesque shadows cast by the lantern which was tossed from side to side in the fight.
Instead of the explosion of ire he was trying teasingly to provoke, I found myself grinning foolishly.
We had done very little talking last night; indeed, we had communicated extraordinarily well without needing any words at all. Now, however, Holmes was at the far side of the breakfast table, and looking his most inapproachable.
I leant across the table to him and said in a low voice: "If you think I am going to give you up that easily, and for such feeble reasons, you are gravely mistaken. I have not spoken my last word on the subject, but I shan't do so here. Let us talk about this cabinet maker - Brodie is his name, if we can believe the sign above his shop."
"Limehouse?" I echoed, thinking over my notes. "Father Briggs, the Franciscan we didn't see at the friary? Isn't that where he works?"
He brought his mouth to the level of my ear to murmur them. "It is not without some sacrifice on my part, I must point out, for the expression on your face upon hearing a carefully constructed string of my deductions is almost as dear to me as that which you wear in the heights of passion - and the latter, you know, is dearer to me than sight itself."
Mr Lyndale did not seem perceptive enough to notice such subtleties.
"And yet your suspicions are aroused?" I prompted.
It seemed an odd way to put it, and I raised my head to see his face more clearly. I could not read his expression.
As we stood there looking at each other, I became quite sure that Holmes' mind and mine were running along the same lines, two leaves caught up in the same current. The tension which had been sitting in the pit of my stomach all day melted away. I could see laid out before me, quite clearly, the path the next few minutes would take us on. All we had to do was work out how to begin.
Would things have been different, had my father been a different man? I might have asked the same of my brother, of course. Now it was too late. They were both gone the way of all flesh. Maybe things had been resolved between them in the next life, if not in this.
"No, no, I was merely thinking - four or five decades together."
As the constable marched down Baker Street, nothing of note occurred. We lost sight of him for a few minutes when he turned into the narrow mews which ran behind the houses on Grosvenor Square. When we caught up with him, he had been set upon by two men dressed in dark greatcoats, their hats pulled down low over their eyes. One was armed with a cudgel, and had set about Boyle, who was defending himself with his own truncheon. As we came running up, the second man wrested the folder from Boyle's grasp and took to his heels down the mews, away from us.
However, I had not forgotten his hint that afternoon that the night could hold an interesting development in the case. Excusing myself, I stepped outside, and had the good fortune to glimpse the back of Holmes' tall figure, disappearing down the steps to the kitchen. I raced after him, and finally caught up with him in the dark stable lane behind the house.
It was very astute of him, and I could not help feeling admirative, despite the obnoxious manner with which he had delivered the observation. It seemed almost purposefully designed to awake irritation and opposition in the heart of all listeners.
She turned, bending to caress his hair. "Hush, darling, nothing's the matter."
Holmes smiled ruefully, his frown softening. "You are the voice of empathy, as ever, Watson."
"How recent was the construction of this row of houses?" he demanded.
Holmes grinned at me, relishing my reaction.
I smiled back, not in the least offended. He would have found it difficult to offend me, at that moment. He disappeared into his bedroom, and I tried to return to the adventures of the plucky midshipman abandoned on a South Sea island. After a while Holmes reappeared, went to his suitcase and opened it, probably checking that I had remembered to include his lockpick's set.
I realised Holmes was provoking him, hoping to anger him into saying something of use to us.
.. .. ..
"One of the servants or even one of her siblings may have been complicit in the theft... out of misplaced loyalty to or sympathy for Georgiana, of course." He shook his head. "I am resigned to the fact that we will not soon learn the truth, nor recover the cameos. Perhaps one day, I hope and pray, there can be a reconciliation between Georgiana and her family, and she will tell us all. But for the moment, we can do nothing but stop the investigation."
Briggs frowned. "If you're looking for Miss Georgiana Lyndale on behalf of her family, you may as well save yourself the trouble," he said bluntly.
"I see," said Holmes. "My mistake."
Holmes obviously had some experience in such activities. That much had been clear from the very first night. But was it the brief, anonymous, hurried kind? And was that his preference? Or was he open to the idea of something more permanent? Something more multifaceted, for want of a better word?
I eyed Holmes warily. "The doctor's been, I suppose? Another doctor, that is to say." The answer was already obvious from my professionally bandaged shoulder, but I was merely producing sound, any utterance serving to break this odd, tense silence.
"Stop the investigation?" Holmes echoed, his tone deceptively mild.
Suddenly Holmes turned back toward me. His head bent, warm lips brushed mine, and then he was already striding to the door, grabbing his hat.
I tugged him into his room, where we shed our clothes as quickly as possible. I pushed him down onto the bed, and he pulled me with him, laughing softly as our limbs tangled and twisted in a clumsy dance. I laughed too, leaning down to kiss the smile from his lips.
Although I kept my attention concentrated on my plate, my mind still distinctly unsettled, I could feel his intense gaze on me throughout my meal.
"There are as many pickpockets here as in London, I perceive," said Holmes, in a voice which I am sorry to say must be described as satisfied. "However, it remains to be seen whether the criminals more worthy of my attention are equally as inventive as their southern counterparts."
When I woke I was lying between clean sheets, and someone was throwing open the curtains. Cold, bright sunlight flooded into the room. I blinked for a while, and finally succeeded in distinguishing Margaret Donnelly standing by the window. She gave me a wan smile, and I noted that her eyes were red-rimmed once more.
Holmes asked a few more questions about the evening, and the other guests who had been present, but I could tell he was merely providing misdirection. He had already got what he wanted from the conversation, though what that might be, I could not tell.
"Was Wilcott the only man you knew of who was involved in all of this?" Holmes prompted.
"We know only what she told her maid: that she has gone away to be married."
I knew what he meant to say without needing to hear it. "Come with me. I know a quiet place."
Marching Lyndale between us, we returned to where we had left his accomplice at the far end of the mews. Boyle was sitting on the man, while Lestrade handcuffed his hands.
"Do you have this note with you?" Holmes asked.
He twisted around to snap at a person or persons unseen. "Where's that damned doctor?"
That was frustratingly generic.
"My theory is insurance fraud on a grand scale, with several prominent businessmen and public figures involved," Holmes said. "But what exactly is in these papers that Lyndale does not want anyone to see?"
Holmes shook his head. "I did not pry into details, or try to deduce them. I do have some common decency, you know. But apparently young Lochie the plumber was aware of her family situation, and was hoping to marry her all the same, as soon as he had gained a sound financial standing himself." He shifted in his seat. "I think you can understand now why I am anxious to bring Brodie to justice without Miss Donnelly having to testify, or be involved in any way."
"Your father informed us she was to be married, yes," Holmes said. "My felicitations."
He was not in the least surprised to see me, of course. He caught my arm, and pulled me into the deepest shadows beside the wall. Following his gaze down the long shadowy lane, I saw a short stout female form disappear around the corner.
"My parents were very High Church, yes. My mother was something of an Anglo-Catholic, in fact."
In the afternoon we called on the Winstons and Armstrongs, two almost indistinguishable wealthy, middle-aged couples. The Winstons had land in Somerset, as I'd learnt by consulting Who's Who before we set out, and the Armstrongs had land in Cumbria. The Winstons were related to the late Mrs Lyndale. The Armstrongs had come over with William the Conqueror, more or less, but their wealth came via Mrs Armstrong, whose father had been in the tobacco trade.
"I have no doubt that were the police to raid his shop, they would find evidence enough to at least convict him of dealing in stolen goods. But that is not enough of a punishment to satisfy me, or to free his victims from their living hell. Only a murder charge will be enough to take him out of their lives for good, but I cannot see my way to proving his guilt in that matter, without ruining innocent lives."
"Yes indeed. This morning I managed to convince her to divulge almost everything which I had not already guessed. She held back at the last, still in fear of her life, but it seems she finally acquiesced - that address that you brought was the final detail I required."
Two members of the Franciscan congregation had been present at Lyndale's dinner, but one of them was absent from the friary when we arrived.
"Why not be comfortable with the way God made us," I said firmly. "At least in the privacy of our own beds. If we cannot be at ease there, where can we be?"
Lyndale waved a dismissive hand. "This fellow you speak of was probably some deserving case, out of work and needing a helping hand... My agent knows he can always use my name for such good causes."
"Representations of the Virgin Mary," Holmes said mildly.
He said that without very much enthusiasm. Burglary and robbery are commonplace, and usually best tackled by the police's brute force method of going through their long lists of known recidivists. Why, we'd even had a spate of burglaries in our own neighbourhood recently, including an attempt on Mrs Hudson's kitchen door, without Holmes being able to put his peculiar talents to use at all.
"I know. I'm not criticising you, Holmes. Merely trying to explain myself."
"I am a doctor," I wanted to say, but it did not seem to make a great deal of sense, given the present circumstances, so I held my tongue, and let myself slip back down into the welcoming darkness.
"Mr Gregory Lyndale, wealthy financier and owner of half the warehouses on Cable Street."
This caused me to raise my eyes sharply to him once more. Holmes rarely spoke of the future, or of what part he saw me playing in it, and now he had just done so twice in a matter of ten minutes. I did not have long to ponder on this, however, for Holmes was already throwing me my coat and donning his own.
He paused, still frowning. "There must be a solution to this conundrum, but I cannot for the life of me think of it."
"Thank you, Mr Holmes, for all the efforts you had undertaken so far. I'm only sorry it was all in vain, and that things should have turned out like this."
Having placed the pile of linens at the foot of the stairs, she took a sheet of paper from the hall table, and wrote something in a slow, careful hand. She folded up the note, and gave it to me. "Thank you sir," she said and hurried away, as if she were afraid she would change her mind.
I did precisely the same thing this morning, but I could not help glancing up at Holmes every so often. The whole world seemed turned upside down, but at its centre was the same Holmes I'd always known. I was reminded of a line, vaguely recalled, from a poem I'd once known:
"Oh?" I said, turning my attention to the painting willingly enough, though I was not familiar with the original.
"So I've heard," Briggs agreed readily. "Indirectly, in many cases, perhaps." He moved some crates off two wooden chairs and gestured to us to sit down. He himself leant up against the desk. "Now how can I help you, gentlemen?"
So I did.
"It's quite an antique, I take it?" Holmes asked, stepping back to view the cabinet in its entirety.
After a quick examination of the front door—"Nothing of interest," Holmes announced—and a half crown for Doris, Holmes and I returned upstairs. I hadn't wanted to speak in front of Mrs Hudson and alarm her unnecessarily, but as soon as the sitting room door closed behind us I said with a frown:
"Holmes - " I held out my hand to him again, but he shook his head.
He hesitated, already seeming to divine my thoughts and not finding them to his liking, but finally nodded.
He would never have said so, however. I don't believe I had a single word of praise from his lips in all the time we were both alive. My brother felt the lack more than I did, I knew.
His hand twitched, as though he longed to reach out and take mine. "You are one in a million, Watson, and I am a fool. And yet I cannot change the way I am." His hand clenched convulsively on the table, in a fierce though restrained display of anger such as I rarely saw from him.
Holmes had evidently now seen all he wished to, for he made his adieus. I followed his example, and we stepped out into the street.
I already knew all that before we arrived, and I did not feel particularly further enlightened by the time we climbed into the carriage back to Baker Street. The Winstons and Armstrongs had not been able to tell us anything of interest, except to reassure us that it seemed entirely impossible anyone should have touched the cameos, given the crowd of people who had been present in the salon the entire evening.
Holmes asked a few more questions about exact times and locations during the previous evening, and then announced that he would like to interview the servants. I ended up with a notebook full of scribbled answers, and no very clear idea of the conclusions Holmes might have reached from all of it.
She seemed to come to a sudden decision. "He said he would be at St Giles' Cathedral at one o'clock. I cannae - it's my afternoon off but I have to be elsewhere. Could you give him a note for me, sir?"
"He has a very strong hold over her, as I said. You see, he knows her secret. She has a child."
"What do you make of Monsignor Pinet, Watson?" he asked after a little while.
The following morning I went out after breakfast to run some errands.
He was still staring at me, his keen eyes fixed with intensity on my face. "That's not all, is it?"
I myself had once been involved with a fellow—another medical student—of the noble and wholesome school of thought. We were friends, and something more, for six months. Every mutually satisfactory night we spent together was followed on his part by remorse and a resolution never to succumb to temptation again. He had been dismayed when I suggested we should part amicably, but I found it difficult to go on as we were. Noble self-sacrifice and self-denial had never appealed to me. He was a very pleasant fellow to spend time with, and my heart had gone out to him, unable as he was to accept and be reconciled with his own nature.
"I speak of the younger daughter, Georgiana, of course," Holmes went on calmly. "Though it is possible she won't act today, but rather tomorrow or even Friday.
His fingers stopped moving, in a distinctly guilty fashion, and I took this as sufficient proof to justify a retaliatory leap at him. However he had been prepared, and instead of dealing some well-earned retribution with the feather-filled bolster, I found myself flat on my back, my arms pinned down and Holmes stretched at full length over me, his face the picture of feigned innocence.
I swallowed, somewhat overwhelmed by the fondness in his voice. "I'm not the slightest bit worried about my immortal soul," I said stoutly. "I refuse to believe it is in danger."
It was quite possible he was working out how to diplomatically express his regrets at having been led last night into a situation he had no desire to see repeated. On the other hand, it was equally possible he was looking to me for reassurance that I wasn't thinking precisely that.
"I trust your journey was not too uncomfortable," he fussed, while his wife poured tea and attempted the impossible task of urging biscuits on Holmes. "I find travelling to be such a stress myself. One never knows whether one will misplace one's tickets, or forget a piece of luggage on the train, or alight at the wrong station..."
"Oh." She looked taken aback. "Thank you, Mr Holmes."
"So it is," said Holmes, sounding thoughtful. "So it is. And where have you been today, Mrs Hudson, if you don't mind my asking?"
"There are rather a lot of them, aren't there?" Holmes said mildly. "One might almost think the case had been specially designed to make your head ache, my poor Watson."
She held up her hand to beckon him into the room, and he came to stand behind her chair. She turned back to Holmes. "Why are you here, Mr Holmes?"
Our eyes met. Holmes' face was grave now, with a hint of uncertainty in the lines around his eyes. I ventured a smile, and was rewarded by a twitch of Holmes' own lips.
"Precisely. Lyndale's plan was not a bad one. I'll admit the business with the cameos could have held a certain intellectual interest, had it been a true crime. But it was all in vain, since his men didn't manage to break into Baker Street, even with a whole afternoon in which to do so at their leisure."
"She never mentioned him by name again, but I got the impression she was still seeing him." Young Lyndale shrugged. "I'm afraid that's all I have to go on."
Lyndale blanched. "Oh, really?"
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
Later that night, I was pleased to discover that Holmes had not lapsed into his usual post-case languidness, but was rather in high spirits. Indeed I had occasion to be thankful for the nap I had taken earlier in the day, for otherwise I should surely have collapsed in exhaustion, such exertions did he put me through.
"I only arrived in England two days ago. I'm here professionally, you understand, on official business—auditing Church accounts. Since my arrival, I've been staying with the Franciscans in Wembley, several of whom are regular visitors to the Lyndales' home, hence my invitation. Although I knew Mr Lyndale by reputation—" Again, he bowed obsequiously towards Lyndale. "—I was not acquainted with him before last night, nor with any of the other guests, besides those Franciscans I came with."
It was clear she had been expecting the question. She did not answer, but turned her head away, her lips pressed tightly together. "It seems you already know the answer to that, Mr Holmes."
"You may have heard of the Cable Street case? A series of arson attacks and warehouse robberies."
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
"Precisely. I expect great things of him, Watson." On that cryptic note, he started up the stairs.
"Young Doris would like to see you, Mr Holmes," Mrs Hudson announced.
Holmes walked to the window and stood looking out, his back to me. "Thus, as I stated, I have come to apologise. Firstly, to apologise for my reckless behaviour, even though I know you already understand and forgive it. Secondly, to apologise in advance for something I fear you will neither understand nor forgive."
I was quite sure that was not the only explanation for her red-rimmed eyes, but there was possibly some truth in the statement. It was indeed the season for such an affliction.
A housemaid answered the door and showed us into the drawing room, where Mrs Georgiana Smith, formerly Lyndale, awaited us. As on the first time we had met, she struck me as a very reserved, self-possessed young woman. She sat with two small children, a girl and a boy, as neatly and soberly dressed as she was.
"He seems to derive a great deal of satisfaction from having his hobby be the centre of attention."
Smith winced, his hands tightening on the back of his wife's chair, but he did not speak. Mrs Smith's face was set in stone, her spine rigid.
While I was regaining my breath after this statement, Holmes went on in a more business-like tone, although I could see that he was smiling fondly at the flush in my cheeks.
I resumed reading:
"I know," she said. "That's why I—" She swallowed. "My suspicions were first awoken when I heard that Joshua Wilcott had been arrested. I knew who he was because of my work at the Franciscan soup kitchen. I knew my father was responsible for him being placed there, so close to the site of the arson attacks. And... I knew my father and his man of business were giving him direct orders. Some conversations I had overheard began to make a sort of horrifying sense."
She sniffed, still looking doubtful. "I'd rather you told me they were in gaol."
After a few hours, I noticed that Holmes was no longer turning any pages of his own book, and that his gaze was directed towards the pages of mine.
I was in the my bedroom at the Gordons', and by the light shining through the window, I estimated the hour to be close to midday.
Father Garner was a man of medium height and build, with a detached, self-contained manner that somehow made his presence more imposing than it otherwise would have been. He brought us to a small room lined with books, a cross between a library and a study, and had one of his fellow friars bring us tea and biscuits. I got the impression he occupied a senior position among his brothers.
Upon my return, Holmes greeted me with a note in his hand. "You're just in time, Watson. I'm expecting Mr Nicholas Lyndale at any moment."
I smiled at this familiar complaint, and went to put my arms about his waist, but he sprang away.
"I know I have no right to ask anything of the sort, Watson, but I wish - I would like - that is to say, I find I cannot bear the thought of letting you go into danger tonight with your last thoughts of me being that I am a heartless bastard."
"Really, Holmes, you will put me off my lunch if you keep on staring at me in that manner."
A chill ran through me. "I don't think there's any grievous sin here," I said sharply.
"It seems he was recommended by your man of business."
"I suppose I have only been out cold for one night?" I asked. "Not a whole day and a night, that is to say?"
Holmes had clearly been thinking something similar, for he said slowly: "One day, Watson, I shall be rich, and we shall travel alone together in first class, and hire whole suites of rooms at Le Meurice, and visit all the opera houses of Europe, and I shall take you out to dinner every evening."
Monsignor Pinet's eyes widened. He looked as though he were trying to decide whether the comment should be taken as some sort of subtle insinuation against himself.
To my delight, Holmes was not yet so caught up in the case that he refused to waste time on something as frivolous as regular meals. He was silent and distracted over lunch, however, eating little and saying less.
"They seem to be two extremely different people," I said more diplomatically.
"What is your opinion on the matter so far, Watson?"
Mrs Spencers' inflexible attitude reminded me of my own father, not that he would have appreciated being compared to a Roman Catholic.
Georgiana said, more gently, "I mean that God loves you too, Nicholas. And—and everyone else you love."
