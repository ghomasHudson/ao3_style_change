Dean straddles him then, hands on the older mans face now and kisses him softly. "Tell me you love me, Cas-" he whispers against rough lips. "Tell me how much-" his hips grinding now, extracting a groan from the man under him.
"I didn't know what." Dean whispers, holding onto the man in bed with him for dear life. "Why didn't you leave him right away?"
"What was that?" Castiel looks over at him.
Dean pads into the room, his hair looking extra fluffy like it's been freshly washed. "What-" he rasps, clearly having been asleep.
life and he's no
Dean nods, "Yea-" then laughs softly. "Son of a bitch is the toughest out of all of us-" and Castiel doesn't disagree because it was the truth.
After a minute of silence, "Does he know you do-" their eyes meet. "-favors for men?"
Dean is awake and lucid the entire time but he's afraid- each bump in the road, each turn has him feeling like he's on a roller coaster ride rather than a vehicle. He's laying on his back but his heart is racing and it makes him all the more nervous. "Were going to give you some oxygen buddy-" one of the paramedics says as he sticks something cool and plastic up his nose, he doesn't know what it is but it's hooked up to an oxygen tank. "You don't have a fever- " the guy says after taking his temperature. "Once we get to the hospital, they're going to take some blood- you're going to be alright." he reassures him but it's going in one ear and out the other.
Fuck, he's going to get the police called on him for real next time for doing shit like this. Dean doesn't fucking need anything, why is he even standing in the boys doorway in hopes of maybe starting something he is convincing himself can't ever happen.
"Yes, you." She looks through the notebook she has on her lap, "He's told me that you work long hours- barely have time for him. Mr. Novak, he's got a hole in his heart that's so big-he cries himself to sleep almost every night."
John shoves him on the bed, pulling off his clothes first before working on undressing himself. He didn't particularly like that Castiel was almost as hairy as he was but at least his body was slightly smaller than his own.
"Cas?" he asks again, Castiel is too busy looking at the water in the tub.
Bobby looks his way- "Taking a walk, It's good for my heart." he waves him over, "Good for yours too, join me." Dean walks quickly up the way to meet him by the wooden fence, he's jealous of how much land he's got all to himself. No neighbors nearby. "You doin' okay?"
The teen stomps loudly up the porch steps and calls out, "Hello-" right before knocking on the old front door. It doesn't take long before the tall, dark and handsome man is walking up to the screen door.
Dean needed a whole day in order to recover from how hard he fucked his step father. It wasn't the first time he's done so, but this was much more
Castiel looks at her once they're in the diners parking lot now and he feels guilty. "Right-" he looks around nervously. "Alright, follow me back to my place-" she hugs him before getting inside her car. He really shouldn't be bringing her home because Dean hates her guts and well, just
Dean wants Castiel to be his
Once alone Castiel laughs softly as he's looking at John. His unofficial ex. "You're an idiot."
The older man spanked his bottom harshly, ignoring the gasp the boy under him made. "Who said you could swear under my supervision hm?"
"At a friends house-" John goes to the kitchen and he follows.
The doctor snorts, "You have no idea what I'm going through-" and logs off his computer before quickly standing up from his chair.
He's just happy Dean hasn't gotten into any more fights at school and hopes he doesn't get called in again. These days Dean stays up late and he goes to school early, Castiel now drops him off most mornings. He has indeed received one phone call but that was more out of concern from one of his teachers who was worried about him. Why now though? Dean's been through so much- The neglect, the abuse... his Mom leaving then his Dad leaving. Dean didn't show much distress then and now all of a sudden...
"You forgot my ice cream!" Dean yells at him from the table which makes the older man turn around, "I want my ice cream, asshole."
Castiel leans in to kiss him goodbye for the day but that kiss is also rejected- he'd be a liar to say it didn't hurt. "I'll try to be home early tonight-" Dean only nods, he can't tell if he's upset with him or if he's ashamed for crying. "Don't hesitate to call me-"
The principle starts again, "I'd hate to see his good work go to waste because of his anger issues. I recommend he see a psychiatrist-"
"He's our son!" she yells.
"Good job-" Castiel chuckles nervously and makes quick work of shutting off the water and drying the boy off. "Dry that really good-" he gestures to his privates. "I'll get your pajamas ready." he turns around to grab the pajamas from the sinks counter while the boy dries his lower half off.
"Dean."
Castiel has to grab him and pull him close before he has another episode, "Shh-" then kisses him gently to distract him from the cold hard truth that would be his reality in the distant future. "So, Mexico-" he says before reaching towards the center of the bed where he placed a box of chocolates that he'd also gotten for his love. "You excited?"
"Grab those hot dogs-" he points to the hot dogs on the counter, "-and grab those too-" he looks at a package of marshmallows. "I'll be outside getting the fire started." and off he goes, into the outdoors.
" Why is there whipped cream in coffee, is this Irish coffee? " Dean looked so confused yet disgusted, it was a very childish moment for a grown ass man on his behalf.
"Yea-" Dean sulks.
So that leaves him eating in the kitchen all by himself until Dean comes inside after dark and looking all sweaty from the bike ride. He sits at the table without saying a word and bites into the almost cooled off burger before whimpering at how good it was, even if there was nothing on it but a beef patty.
Dean smiles, he can see the excitement on his face. "Can you help me get in?" Castiel nods happily, "You're the best dad in the world-" the words slip and Castiel hugs him- emotion over coming him but he does a good job of keeping it hidden.
Even though Castiel is feeling very unsteady on his feet and has a headache similar to the one he got after getting drunk for the first time, all of that is pushed aside for the moment because Dean comes first.
"Lavender helps me relax." Castiel admits, "I'll run you a bath every night if you want me to."
Dean grabs his jacket from the wall hook by the front door, "Bobby-" and peeks into the kitchen where his uncle was cleaning up. "Goin' to see Cas, you cool with that?" the older man nods, telling him to come back before midnight. "Thanks, won't be long-"
"I wish you'd let me fuck you-" the declaration is soft in the silent room. "Do you think-" hesitates. "Just tonight, can I fuck-"
He knocks on the bathroom door,"Yea." Dean replies.
Castiel and and Dean's noses rub against each other, they can smell Bobby's dinner on each others breaths. It should be unpleasant, yet somehow it's not. "You mean the world to me, Dean-" his words are whispered against his neck because Castiel is busy kissing the freckled covered skin.
That ends that conversation which Castiel is relieved for because he does not feel comfortable giving this boy the birds and the bees talk or letting him know where babies come from, if he didn't know that already. This was a topic for his father to cover, but it didn't seem like that was going to happen at any point in time because the man was rarely ever home for more than a few hours at a time.
They spend the rest of the day eating junk and watching Netflix- Castiel can't take watching any more
Castiel found himself alone on a Friday night while John was out with his mechanic buddies. He was invited to tag along as part of their path to making amends, but he wasn't exactly in the mood to be the groups punching bag for the night which he knew he would be.
"The fuck you doin' here!" he roars, "Where the fuck is he!" and stomps around the house looking for him. "Cas!"
He hadn’t seen Dea- Mr. Winchester in a few weeks and hasn’t heard from him in far longer. Sigh… He felt like cuddling and making out with someone. Dean...
"Yes-" he kisses the teens forehead lovingly. "You cried a lot, it was so unlike you-"
Castiel slows down a little bit, leaning over his back and it was the wrong thing to do because Dean begins to cry loudly for the first time in forever, "Baby, what-"
Castiel follows Dean to the bathroom, "You went to the diner. With what money?" he questions, "I sure as hell know I didn't give you any." he can't help but hiss angrily. "Who gave you money?!"
"Are you uh-into anything kinky?"
The box containing most of his past is abandoned by the fence where the trash bin was for pick up tomorrow. Maybe he'd get rid of more things. Dean wanted to start off fresh and what better way to do that than by throwing out old junk. His new boring life started weeks ago, tossing his old crap was just solidifying it.
"I'm sure that he never saw you as a burden." she reassures him, also confidently. "You must understand that he didn't have kids of his own, and suddenly he's helping to raise the son of his-"
Ash cracks open a second beer and takes a sip before handing it to the teen on his passenger seat. Dean's feeling awkward because of the song, but Ash is actually bobbing his head to the tune. It was pretty catchy but,
Bobby speaking up suddenly startles them, but from his angle it didn't look like they'd been doing anything. "Gonna head back-" he stands and stretches, "I wan't ya home soon-" his nephew nods in understanding. "If ya don't come back by nine, I'll-"
Apparently the mans education never seems to stop because every other month he's taking some kind of seminar or workshop that's obligatory by the hospital. Dean supports him furthering his career, even if it meant less time at home together but maybe that will change in the future. For now, his duty was to be as supportive as he could be because he still holds some guilt for being so much trouble the last few years.
"I fell this morning-" is all he says, monotone.
Dean looks like he had just seen a ghost- the ghost of his own father.
Of course he obeys and doesn't eat the slop on his plate. Once they've dumped their trays, they're walking behind the rest of the inmates after dinner and that's when Castiel pulls Dean into one of the guards offices. "Wait here-" and he leaves. Dean's nervous because he knows he shouldn't be in here, luckily enough Castiel comes back with a guard and he's thinking that maybe they're going to take turns raping him until the guard hands him a bag from McDonalds.
The teen goes down to his knees, his eyes pleading for it. "But I
He thinks about it as they walk down the road. "I'm enjoying the break from work." is all he can think to say because
Castiel lazily kicks his bedroom door shut while Dean waits for him on the couch or so he thinks, the boy peeks through the half inch opening and watches him push down his sweats to reveal his naked body. Castiel pulls on a pair of black briefs and fresh jeans. Dean can't look away, he's never seen another naked person before. Only Sam, during bath time when they were little but that doesn't count, Sam is like his brother. When Castiel is pulling on a shirt over his head he quickly goes to grab the backpack he dropped by the front door so he can pretend he had been waiting there all along.
written all over your body-" that's when the laughter dies down and now he's moaning in pure ecstasy. Castiel's prostate is constantly getting jabbed and manages to come a second time after another long while. "That all you got?" his tone is rough.
get along and almost wishes he hadn't ruined it by playing footsies under the table. The mans knee quickly bumps the underside of the table and is unable to concentrate on his conversation with his uncle. Eventually he grows bored of not being the center of attention so he excuses himself without too much trouble.
Dean pulled back and got on the tips of his toes to kiss Benny, he only ended up kissing his bearded chin though because Benny caught on and pulled away.
Not only where his weight and height on the lower spectrum, the boy was also
Castiel shook his head, leaning over to buckle Dean in. Dean never wanted to wear his seat belt. Why argue with him. As they drove home, after picking up some food. Dean asks, "Do you think he was cute?"
Dean keeps pacing, he's biting his fingernails when a nurse walks in. "Hello, love." She says, Castiel lights up a little bit. "Heard you were having chest pains." she sounds worried.
dinner?" the question asked seems to  make Dean happy so pizza for all of today is what they will be having.
His cellphone rings, it's Bobby.
Castiel winces at the tone, "Charming."  and he rushes down the driveway to his car without saying goodbye.
Dean blinks to get rid of what is threatening to become tears in his eyes, surely it was going to happen one day but he never thought about it. The man seems so invincible, It's hard to think of him not being there someday. Even if it was many years away.
do their best to keep it together.
"It's just so weird not sneaking around-"  he looks down at his khaki shorts, "Listen Cas-we're not gonna become one of those couples who dresses like they're going golfing all the time are we-"
"Wanting what?" It hits him that he hasn't told the guy how he was paying for the drugs. "Did he want money?" Dean shakes his head, "What did he want in exchange for the drugs Dean?"
He's licking the salt off each of his fingers when his friend snickers beside him. "What?"
"I'm worried-" Dean says when Castiel's bedroom door shuts. "I've never seen him like this."
The homemade pie is baking in the oven and Castiel is making dinner while the teen is taking a hot shower. As if on cue, as soon as the pie is taken out of the oven, the teen pads into the kitchen with freshly dried fluffy hair and pajamas. They smile warmly at each other before working together to set the table for just the two of them. Castiel's got it in the back of his mind to take some left overs to Bobby later that evening if he can and maybe apologize.
"Over there-" Dean points to a small stack of about five records on a table in the corner- this place hardly qualified as a record store.
and Castiel knows exactly in what context he uses the word, he just hadn't thought the boy could hear it.
"Cute kid." he tells John, who just shrugs.
- They would quickly change the chanel or turn off the TV.
Dean pushes him away with a pissed off look but it was that
Sam looks at the old tool shed, "He wanted to jump-"
"Relax-" Meg whispers in his ear.
After dressing in boxers and a white undershirt he goes to the kitchen, passing his uncle watching television in the living room. As he's making his sandwich, he feels eyes on him- he assumed it was Bobby watching him, suspicious all over again but it was Castiel through the window. Eventually when he sits down and bites into his sandwich he sees the familiar car drive away. He shakes his head and eats his dinner.
“ I -agh..have to-”
Castiel reaches over for the mini shampoo bottle and gets to work on lathering Dean's hair. "I love you-" he says softly, now working on washing the teens body. "-so much."
Castiel manages to pull on his boxers and a pair of dark sweatpants on in hopes that they'll hide his still present erection. The monster in his pants had nothing to do with the boy, or at least he doesn't think so.
"I'm sorry for what I did to you-" he whispers softly into the darkness and the candle relights itself almost instantly as the apology was made.
If he he gets into one more fight at school, he's out. Hell, he probably want's to get kicked out- Dean's never liked school aside from seeing his best friend Sam and he hasn't come around lately according to what he's been saying. Sam finally has a little girlfriend of his own.
"She seems nice, didn't even ask about my age." he's still surprised. "Maybe we will be able to get married-"
Bobby laughs, "Oh boy, that was a man you were doin' it with-" apparently he thought Castiel was having sex with a woman. "I heard ya havin' sex with someone and I didn't wanna go in-" his laughing continues.
His face lights up instantly and reaches inside for the burger he had mentioned wanting the previous week. "Thanks-" he grins before unwrapping the small burger and taking a large bite. The guard leaves them alone after instructing them to be back in their bunks for count in half an hour. The teen devours the beef burger and even licks his fingers when he's done because it's probably the last one he'll get in a long time.
Dean turns the page, Castiel could see pictures of cars on them. "About?" he doesn't make eye contact with his step dad. He's still sulking, he misses the guy but he's too much of a brat to let his hurt feelings slide just like that.
"So-" she says casually. "How's the little bugger?"
"Meh-" he smiles sadly. "What else am I gonna do, Cas? Cars is all I know-" there's a pause. "It's the only thing I'm good at-"
"I'm not strong enough-" their eyes meet and lock intensely. "I would die if you- if something-" and it took only a few seconds before he's breaking down in tears.
"Aww you like it-" he coos, eating his treat. "This one's a scone, wanna try?" the boy nods, "Here-" he breaks it in half so they can share. Dean likes that too. "I come here often-" Castiel volunteers the information. "I love coffee-" he sighs, half laughing. "It's the only thing keeping me alive at this point-"
"Hold on-" Dean runs after his step father, pushing people out of his way as well so he can catch up to him. Before he can go through the large wooden double doors to exit, he grabs the mans arm to hold him back. "What's wrong?" he asks, eyebrows knit together in confusion. When Castiel looks over his head with tears in his eyes it's clear to him, "She's your daughter after all, isn't she?" Dean follows his gaze. "You're really her father-"
Castiel parked sloppily when he arrived, across two spaces and not giving a damn about it and speeds walks towards Dean. It wasn't surprising at all to see that here weren't many people around, most likely because the sun was quickly beginning to set in the distance.
Castiel shakes his head, "No. You shouldn't let me stop you."
look in his eyes. "Don't ya miss me?" a nervous huff escapes him.
"Stick out your tongue, be good for me-" Castiel's nostrils flare up with desire, giving him the
Benny makes a face like he doesn't believe it, "Really, Brady smokes pot?" Dean nods, "Hard to believe, he's in the church choir." Dean rolls his eyes, "He said you owed him money for drugs, is that true?" He nods dumbly and Benny sighs, closing his file and putting his pen away. "Here's what I'm gonna do. You're young and I know you're a good kid and I thought Brady was too but apparently not. Do you know if he sells drugs to anyone else?"
John whistles, "Damn Cas, I shoulda stayed with you." he sticks out his hand, "That works. Gimme."
"Like me-" Dean smiles shyly up at him. "I'm happy."
Castiel was more curious about Dean's balls instead so he brought three fingers to his mouth to get them wet before he went to tug at them.
When Bobby comes back from his weekend getaway late on Sunday evening, he's none the wiser to anything that could have happened between the teen and his stepfather. After all he'd come back earlier than he said he would to find his nephew had been out back, working on finishing up a car so nothing rung any alarm bells.
"How'd it go?" Bobby stands up. His uncle had brought him to his appointment before going to the diner for lunch since Dean was going to quit today and figured the kid needed the extra support.
Castiel's eyes shot up to look up into annoyed green, " No! Please... " He lowered his tone to a whisper, " I'm only nineteen... I-I Don't need any trouble. "
Dean takes a few seconds to respond, "Nah-" another soft laugh as they continue to rock against each other gently. "Feels nice-"
Dean comes in and crawls on the bed next to the grumpy man, "My chest feels weird." he says, hand over his chest.
Castiel smiles warmly, regretfully. "Dean, you have no idea what I would have done just to keep you safe. You have no idea what I
Castiel sticks around until he's done eating breakfast, "Ready?" and stands up, chugging the last of his coffee before they head outside. "Cutie-" Castiel wraps an arm around the teenager as they make the walk down the road to his place. "I really miss seeing you everyday-"
"I'll think about it, I promise." Alex pulls away awkwardly, he wasn't looking to take things further or take things outside of the club.
After their meals arrive, they dig in and eat in comfortable silence. Everything is going well until the bell on the door jingles to reveal a very messy haired Castiel Novak in scrubs, most likely coming in to grab a bite after work. Dean doesn't call out to him or anything, not yet, and just observes the man approach the front counter to order. Guess he would be sitting up front, rather than taking a booth.
John refuses because of course, this isn't a date and he doesn't have that much cash on him for food- he assumes they are two men hanging out at a bar on a Friday night. It's completely and totally platonic. They chat mindlessly for a while until their beers arrive and the doctors buffalo wings.
The man pulls him close by the back of his neck, "You don't think I'm
"-horror movie marathon?" Dean grins, his little fangs making an appearance- he's always been a dork. Castiel agrees to it, Bobby does too. "Awesome."
"He knows!" Dean hisses, his face pale. "Oh my God- he threatened to shoot you didn't he- son of a bitch Bobby-"
Dean nods and waddles to his room, towel still wrapped around his waist. The boy finally figured out how to dress himself with an injured arm. Well, he mostly wore his underwear and a big shirt to bed now anyways.
Benny held him back roughly by the shoulders. “What are you doing? We can’t! I-I don’t want to!” he let the boy go and stormed off. After a few minutes his truck roared to life in the distance.
Dean stays alone waiting for his results in the room for about an hour until Castiel comes back telling him that he's going to need surgery in order to have his tonsils removed. "No!" he screams in a way that hurts his ears. "I don't want to do it-"
Castiel sips on it, "It's good."
Dean's cell suddenly rings and they both look at the table where it was.
Dean pushes down his shorts to his knees and does the same.
"I saw you!" Bobby hissed, "You were lickin' Dean's mouth like you were tryna kiss him-" C
Castiel hesitates before saying, "Fifteen-" his daughter was a tad bit younger than his new toy. "That a problem?"
The following day Dean and John get to spend some quality time at home after his first day back to school from winter break. It was out of the ordinary for them to be alone early in the day but Castiel was working a double shift at the hospital and it was the only reason he wasn't around to tuck Dean into bed that night.
Dean's fast asleep next to him and the television had been shut off, he must have done so when he'd fallen asleep at some point. He checks his cell phone first, nothing, then he checks Dean's phone. Nothing either. Something is really off, "Dean-" he shakes him awake gently. "Wake up, I'm worried about Bobby-" green eyes open halfway, peeking through lashes. "We need to go check on him-"
Bobby smiles, serving him a mountain of eggs, bacon and a few pancakes. "Dig in boy-" in the middle of breakfast his phone pings, it's a message from Castiel.
"To the point of cumming in my mouth? You didn't even warn me-" Dean looks down at the shower drain and spits,"-I had to swallow all of it."
Castiel says, "Let's just go home-" after passing the same damn mall four times already. "You forgot, it's fine-"
Dean pulled them out slowly, loving the sounds the boy was making right now. Innocent but somehow full of sin. Castiel yelped as he was grabbed by his hips and pulled back to meet Deans big hungry cock that was covered by boxer briefs. "Cas."
"Its kind of a blur-" Dean is blushing. "What the hell ever happened to it?"
Their relationship didn't end because the two grown men broke up, it ended because John
"You're really scared of me-" Dean snorts, "-wuss." and slaps the older man's meaty thigh.
"What are you doing here-" she says the second she climbs into the truck.
"Uh, yea-" Dean smiles. They watch dark clouds rolling inwards up ahead, another storm, or maybe the same one. After a while of sky gazing he asks, "Are you still sad?" Castiel looks at him, the bluntness of his question was not expected. "I mean, you were depressed, weren't you?"
Dean groans, "Okayy-" and leaves the room with the unopened bag of chips.
"Dunno, at a bar."
Right then he gets up and tries to go hang out with Castiel, but his friends quickly scatter like cockroaches when he approaches. Castiel turns around, "What's up baby?" he smiles, clearly in a better mood than yesterday. Everything that happened had seemed to be forgotten by the older man or it seemed like it.
They're on their second movie of the night and the boy is holding onto the older mans arm for safely. Every now and then, when someones head gets cut off and blood goes everywhere, he uses the older mans arm to cover his line of view. Their thighs are touching because of how close they are sitting next to each other, but it's fine, it's not a big deal. It's not weird at all, not yet anyway.
"Get dressed-" Castiel orders, they get up and start pulling on their pants- which was hard to do when they were drenched in sweat. "Damn it!" he curses the air when he looks at his phone, it was almost ten at night. "Bobby-"
Dean smiles, wiping the chip dust on his fathers shirt that he was still wearing. "Awesome, I'm in the same class as my best friend Sam. I know him since kindergarden-"
The camera ends up on the bedside table at a certain angle that should manage to catch everything they're doing in bed. Dean's nervous energy disappears once things begin to spice up again. The pace is slow which makes him moan so pretty with his beautiful eyelashes fluttering in the glow of the now late afternoon sunlight that is threatening to disappear.
Castiel keeps his eyes clothes, not wanting to look at the boy. The fear of temptation is too big right now.
Bobby finishes his last bite, "Might as well go before we head back, long drive." he follows the teen to the rest room, he hears him crying in the two stall bathroom. "Dean, you alright in there?"
"So..." Castiel clears his throat, "It's up to you what happens between us."
Dean holds back the urge to moan, "Um-" his mind is all fuzzy and clouded suddenly but he knows there's a gun down the hall that he just saw with his own two eyes. "Fuck-" his thighs spread apart, giving the large hand that was now on his inner thigh more room to grope. "Bobby-" he moans his uncles name, "I gotta go-" another weak moan. "He's waiting-"
"Lay back here-" she says, gesturing towards the twin sized hospital bed that was too high off the ground. "There we go-" she says once he's laying back- "Scoot down for me, Dean." This is humiliating.
Castiel tells the doctor, "Thank you." who he actually happened to know quite well and he was good at his job too. "We'll be leaving soon-" he tries to say, hoping to get in good with the boy.
"Passed your bed time-" John huffs, guiding the boy into his room and into bed. Dean braces himself for what comes next but it doesn't. He seems to pick up on his sons internal defiance so he reassures him by saying, "I don't need you like that anymore son-" and kisses the boys forehead with no emotion behind it at all.
"Where were you?" Castiel crosses his arms, already dressed for work- Black scrubs today.
have to take responsibility for this problem?"
Dean swallows, "We could fuck." he's mostly teasing but maybe he's trying to test the waters. See if fucking is still on the table after all this time.
Once the water begins to run clear, John helps his boy step out of the shower and towel dries his hair, then his naked body. Dean whispers, "My butt hurts-" John quickly spins to examine his rear end and begins to rub the irritated flesh. He doesn't complain until thick fingers rub between his cheeks, that's when Dean looks over his shoulder and he doesn't look upset.
Dean nibbles on his bottom lip anxiously and ignores the flattering comments, solely focusing on who the hell that man was. "Anything you wanna say?" and the tone of his statement sounds way harsher than he'd meant for it to come out. "I mean-" he leans over the table a little, "I saw you talking to some guy-"
Kevin pulls away with a pat on his shoulder, "You got me, everything's gonna be alright-"
"Shit. Jack saw us-"
When Castiel pulls away, Dean looks at his lips and kisses him. Castiel is so surprised it takes him a few seconds before he kisses back, he pulls away before they can be seen by anyone. It's much like the kiss he gave Jo, no real passion behind it. When they make eye contact, Dean nods. Castiel helps him up, this time he holds onto him for dear life.
"Dean, it's not a big deal." he states, bags in hand. "Let's go-"
" No...But that doesn't mean I suck anything. " Castiel lay back on the bed next to Dean. At least Dean was talking now unlike when he was grinding into him.
"We sure can, I came prepared-" he looks over towards the corner of the living room and they see a whole bunch of fishing gear. "Brought my rifle too, just in case we wanna go huntin'-"
Castiel sighs and gives in- he scoots over to the laying teen and plants a kiss on his mouth. A soft one. "Dean, I have to go." before he can move to get up he's pulled down for another kiss. A deeper one- Dean's wet tongue slips into his mouth and he moans softly. They french kiss for a few minutes before he pulls himself away painfully, "I have to go."
Castiel doesn't know why but he wishes Dean were here, so he could talk to him- talking to the kid always made him feel better regardless of the situation. He stays on the floor where he had been for a while until he can manage to get up and go to the bathroom to clean himself up. After looking in the mirror he sees the mess John made out of him, his nose was bleeding out and he had a bruise on his lip. Rubbing his face with a warm damp cloth did nothing for the blood so he decided on a shower.
"Bobby helped-"
Even though It's highly unlikely he will be tossed to the side like a bag of garbage as soon as he's legal, there's still some anxiety that's trying to convince him that he'll be tossed on his ass.
Benny smiles, "Don't worry about it." he crouches down on his knees so he's at eye level with the teen. "Did you hear what I said? Gordon hasn't been in his cell- since yesterday." Dean nods sadly, still refusing to make eye contact. "He's still got a few cop friends around and we think one of them helped him get out."
Dean stops running, "It's fucking hot in here and you don't have central air." he plays it cool.
Castiel catches the movement, he laughs and turns to face her as well. "Dean used to do that-" she's confused until he gestures to her legs being hidden under the shirt.
Dean gulps.
Dean's hand starts pawing roughly at the mans crotch, instantly the prize hidden inside becomes hard. "You got hard pretty friggin' fast for a guy that doesn't wanna see me-"
"So, you really do love cars-" he smiles, reaching inside his pocket for his business card. "Here-" and puts it in the teenagers hand. "My numbers on here." he laughs softly, "And If I ever have any more car troubles, I'll call you."
The man nods, "Sure was-" and it's only half a lie. "Go on and get to sleep-"
but now he was paranoid and because of this, he wasn't able to enjoy the mall trip freely.
Dean nods, smiling. "Sure." he knocks back the last of his coffee and they head out, to his appointment. Going to therapy makes Dean feel like he's got some deep seeded issues, and he knows he does but that doesn't change how he feels when he walks into the office- like he's Ted Bundy or something.
Castiel goes to wait for him by the car for a good while before Dean finally exits the Gothic looking church, sprinting up to him. "Cant go with you, Bobby-" green eyes look over at his uncle and his truck, waiting for him further down the parking lot.
Right then he told no lies because his stomach did ache in this particular way when his father was done with him. The emotional things he felt in those moments with the man was strange at best, having to lay there while treated like some kind of rag doll felt really funny to him. It made his insides burn in a very bad way and he wasn't fond of it.
Castiel pulls out a pair of handcuffs from a drawer in his dresser. "Do you trust me?" The boy nods. "Then come here-" he beckons, and grabs his desk chair- dragging it towards the center of the bedroom. "Sit." As soon as the teen sits down, he cuffs his hands behind his back and he swallows nervously. "Look at me." he orders firmly.
as Dean calls him- makes his heart melt because it's so adorable. It's times like these where he regrets not having kids or
"No!" Dean shouts, "Not until we talk-" Castiel turns around, going up the steps and unlocking the front door. "Please! Just tell me we're okay and I'll go!" the man turns around again, looking at him with utter disappointment. "Please! I need you-"
"I don't remember." Dean states coldly.
That night he slept with Dean in his bed, just to hold him through the night. Not being able to imagine leaving him alone after what they just shared. He knew he was crossing the line now.
He nods, "She couldn't accept it, guess she was mad at me-" they stop at a gas station so they can take a short break, stretch their legs. "-I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were just so young and I-"
"I know em, he's my friend."
"Thanks, the burger was amazing." Gabriel compliments, putting a few bills on the table.
Eventually he realizes that the reason the other teenagers are staring at him is because he's dressed up- while everyone was in jeans and polo shirts. Next time he's wearing jeans and a shirt from Castiel's closet, he doesn't want to stand out. As the class continues he decides maybe he should let Castiel dress him, maybe some polo shirts, some nice jeans. He wants to fit in, especially here where everyone seems too good for him.
Castiel stood, pulling Dean with him. Sam stood as well, "There's plenty of room in my house and in my heart for the both of you. " he patted Sam on the shoulder.
Dean laughs nervously, "I'm all out, I'm gonna get another. You want anything?"
She takes a sip of her water, "He looked sad when he left-" then moves on to pick at the bland food on her tray. "Is he okay?"
Dean turns the phone to show his stepfather who waves stupidly at the bearded man on the screen. "Bobby, we're hungry. Is it cool if we stay longer and eat first?"
"Tell me Cas." John clears his throat, "Does Dean crawl into your bed every night asking you for kisses too? He did the same thing to me-"
"We usually do an examination for rape-"
"Would you mind If I go take a nap?" he asks the boy while he picks up the mess on the kitchen table. "I have a headache-"
Dean smiles, "You got it, Bobby." They all have seconds, then thirds- except Dean. He nurses that root beer the rest of the night. When the fire on the grill goes out, Castiel and his uncle are pretty drunk and arguing about something- he doesn't know what the issue was but he had to pull Castiel away from Bobby before they started throwing punches.
1 New Message
Castiel bites his lip, guiding the teens hand to his crotch while he drives. "You miss me baby?" the hand on his crotch gives him bulge a hard squeeze. "Mmm, guess you do-"
Bobby looks up, "Don't think I forgot about you two-" the teens smile falls.
"Agh-" Dean winces at the breech, "Shit-" because it always hurts at first.
"Seriously?" Castiel is surprised once again, "Isn't it too soon-" if he'd known that John was only asking him to move in because he needed help with the rent he may not have agreed, even after some convincing.
"I'll bring you come candy, it's closed- we never touched it." Jack smiles sadly because he would love to have his friend join him on their traditional Easter egg hunt. "Do you like chocolate?"
John nods, not caring about this project either. Castiel is the one who takes more of an interest and asks the teacher all kinds of questions regarding Dean and his education. They stayed long enough to enjoy the free punch and snacks that were left out for the parents to take. Castiel had one cookie and John had about five of them, Dean was too shy to grab one.
"Me too." Bobby pulls him in for a big bear hug and it lasts a little longer that it was meant to. "I miss them too." Dean smiles sadly before he peels himself away from his uncle, "And boy, get to bed. Tomorrow you need to start catching up on all that school work-"
The look on Dean Winchesters sleepy face says it all, something was wrong with him and he melts into a pool of total mush. "Come here-" he opens his arms, "You okay?" his arms wrap around the boys small shoulders. "Did you have a nightmare last night?"
Dean groans because he knows he can't be a dumb kid about this, he's got to go make it right somehow. The man is the love of his freaking life, no way is he going to let his stupid issues get in the way of his happiness.
Castiel guides him by the shoulders to the back of the shop, where the boys costumes were. His eyes are quickly scanning the costumes in a hurry, "Here we go-" he pulls one out from the rack of vampire costumes, this one was sized for boys who were 10 to 13 years old. "Let's go try this on-" Dean follows him to the dressing rooms and goes in by himself with the costume. In a few minutes Dean comes out and isn't happy yet. "You don't like it?" Castiel says, looking at his face.
Castiel whispers, "We're not wrong-" green eyes look at him beautifully. "I was wrong for everything-I shouldn't have allowed things to become romantic. I just couldn't resist when you begged me for it-"
Dean bites his lip harder, "Ah-ah-Cas- fuck-" he begins to squirm on the couch until he's no longer sensitive, Castiel keeps milking him for more. "Stop-" he whines, begging. "Pleeease, stop!" he moans- another orgasm begins to build again, low in his stomach and that'ts when he stops begging for him to stop. "Mmmph-" he whines, desperately wanting to come yet again, he keeps trying to come but he can't.
"You're awesome."
"Don't tell me you've-" Dean gestures a blowjob motion with his hand, "No fucking way! who?" he asks, shoving his friend playfully.
Not long into the storm the electricity had gone out and Dean walks into the living room and finds his step dad there, looking down at his phone. He plops down heavily on the couch. "I was on the computer before the power went out, couldn't sleep."
Castiel laughs but soon guilt rises in his gut, how dare he cheat on this boy. He pulls out of the coffee shop after taking a few quick sips of his own drink in hopes of waking himself up since he was dragging today. They're almost back home when Dean says, "How else are you gonna make it up to me?"
Castiel leaves the bag that contains his costume on the bed before exiting his room without another word. He wanted to know what was bothering him but he shouldn't pry if he wants Dean to trust him, he'll wait until Dean comes to him on his own. If something was going on, he'll come to him eventually for him- or he'll go to his father.
"You!" Dean yells and the shadow runs down the dirt road- "The fuck- hey!" he takes off after it and it's probably not the smartest idea- the sun was going down for the day and It was already getting dark. "Come back here, bitch!" he screams after it and he instantly stops running when the dark figure stops right in the middle of the road. It's too quiet and his boots are glued to the ground. "This is private property-" he says, "You better leave- I have a gun."
After pie and coffee, came the actual
"What's that taste like?" Dean asks, hands on his lap. He was always extremely well behaved from what Castiel has seen so far.
It only took giving it up a single time, now he's got perks- regardless if he's sucking dick or not but Castiel will collect on his debt sooner or later.
The sound of another man jacking off in the same room as he is has him getting hard in his khakis but he doesn't dare touch himself for fear of getting caught. Day one was complete and over with, no problems so far so he doesn't want to ruin his lucky streak quite yet. When Castiel finishes he hears movement so he turns his head to face the wall and closes his eyes. Apparently the man was an early riser because he's brushing his teeth and then shaving the dark stubble that had appeared over night.
"Sweet cheeks?" she comes to him, pad in hand ready to take his order. "What's up with you?"
Sometimes he really hates the guy and he knows it's only because he's both his step father and his boyfriend and prays to the good lord above that on his birthday he will just be his boyfriend and nothing else. He hates getting scolded by the man who fucks him, it's beyond humiliating.
he wanted them apart.
Dean gets out of bed and pulls on his boots, "Bobby!" he calls as he makes his way down the hall. "Gonna go see Cas real quick."
He reaches for the can and dots some on those ever so perky nipples- down his still flattened tummy and right above his pubic area. "This is very romantic-" he licks at Dean's nipples, devouring the sweetness there. His soft sighs fill the room.
There's a lot of noise on Castiel's end of the line, he's probably in the cafeteria right now. "Well-" he chews loudly into the phone. "-took the drug test, I'm clean just like I knew I would be." he bites into something crunchy, probably a carrot since he's such a health nut. "I did the psych evaluation as well, all clear."
"Dean?" Sam awakens. Dean's drunk with sleepiness, he moans and stretches. Sam turns over to face him, "Are you awake?"
“Yeah…”
"Because he asked me-" Castiel sighs before he stands up and packs his things away into his bag. "Besides, I want to. He's a cute kid-" the nurse nods, smiling warily up at him. "Don't look at me like that-" he shakes his head before kissing her goodbye on the forehead.
"She's been my friend for a long time."
While on their romantic trip the dynamic duo spend so much one on one time together that it completely brings their relationship to a new level. Being away from all the chaos and the many distractions that come with being
Castiel stops him before Dean can leave the room, "Was your stomach really hurting?" he asks seriously. "Or did you just want me to come over?"
and yet his chest feels tight- like he's drowning. No matter how terrible of a father he had been, Dean is holding on to the one sliver of a good memory he's got- the occasional pack of plastic army men his father would give him. It's enough for him to
The mechanic completely strips the younger mans pajama pants off his body and bends him in half before pushing his way inside dry and raw. Castiel winces in pain before he moans softly, his mouth is slightly open and his eyes are looking up into dark brown.
Sam nods eagerly, giving his phone number so he can call to ask for permission. They walk outside, following the older man as he punches in the numbers.
Dean sits down and blinks his eyes to get rid of the sleepiness before he takes a bite of his sandwich. It didn't work because he's eating with his eyes half open.
"Don't do this to me-" he says aloud, softly. "John, you better go-" the lights flicker once more and actually shut off for a good half a minute before they come back on.
He rolls his eyes, "I don't have another boyfriend."
"Why do you watch straight porn?" Castiel asks, refocusing his eyes on the screen.
Dean's knees grow weak, "Hit me."
Dean laughs, "You basically just confessed that you've had sex with a lot of people." he sits down at the table, watching the man start the coffee.
The next morning they're waiting for Dean to be called in for his appointment. Dean's knee keeps bouncing up and down with nerves. "Dean, relax. Nothing to be scared of."
"No." he lies.
"Damn it, Ash!" Dean yells, "What the hell did you do that for!-" and now the prank seems like the dumbest idea in the world.
After lazily making out for a few minutes they happen to fall asleep and when they wake up in the morning, they continue their lazy kissing session until they have to get up for the day. Luckily Castiel had the day off but it wasn't something to celebrate since he wouldn't really be able to spend it all with his love because Dean had to sneak into Bobby's and pretend he'd been there the whole night.
Castiel finally looks up at him, "I miss you too-" the words are said softly. "Can I still kiss you?" his tone is insecure, but hopeful.
"Get out. I Can't believe you would try to end us because of money. Money doesn't matter! I need you. Poor or not! "
After a while of tension, John comes home and quickly peeks into the living room. "Good boy-" he mouths the compliment to his son in secret, clearly happy that the boy wasn't sitting too close to the doctor. Castiel quickly gets up and follows the mechanic to the bedroom, locking the door behind him. "If you're following me by your own free will, guess that means you wanna get fucked?"
Castiel braces himself mentally before joining him, "I fell asleep-"
Castiel runs a thumb over the teenagers jawline, he did have some light stubble- but it looked
The wrecked voice in the darkness says, "Babygirl-" and the teen closes his eyes at the name, stomach still twitching here and there while trying to catch his breath. "You did so well-"
Castiel chuckles softly, wiping his eyes. "That maybe we should be with someone our own age?" the teen nods. "It crossed my mind, but I don't care. I love you-"
"You see-" Castiel smiles, "-that alone was worth the two hundred bucks."
Castiel laughs, "I bet-" he grabs the boys workbook and looks over his answers before he leaves. "-looks good. Anyways, tell Sam your new friend says hi." and he gets up, walking towards the door and the boy trails behind him.
Castiel quickly downs the rest of his beer before joining him in their usual private room. "I have the money-" he states, handing it over to him before anything happens.
"Two sodas?" He nods. She wasn't aware he would be having company. "I'll be right back." and she's off to grab his order from the kitchen.
Castiel shrugs, Dean looks down and sees that the guy isn't hard in the least. That's a first, every time he's seen his dick it's always been hard. "What's up?" he asks him.
"He said some stuff that hurt my feelings-" Dean wills himself not to cry because it feels like it's over. Deep down he's holding onto the idea of marrying Castiel one day but maybe that's foolish, he's just a kid and turning eighteen isn't going to change that overnight.
While everyone reads and discusses every chapter, the teen sulks on the couch while sitting next to his step father. The whole ordeal must have lasted almost two hours before the women start yawning and Castiel calls it quits for the night.
As soon as Dean comes out from the building he goes to Castiel and they huddle under the umbrella before running to the car in the parking lot. Once again they start to learn new things about each other. Dean learned what Castiel's favorite color was after he told him that his was Black.
"You don't have to look older, we're fine." Castiel wraps an arm around him as they walk down to the beach- not many people were out today. The sky was dark and it was windy- it looked like a storm was coming in the distance. "But you do look cute-" he stops and they share a lingering kiss. They were both pleased to see they weren't the only same sex couple out today.
"Oooo! You said a bad word-" and the man forgets why he was mad in the first place. "You need to apologize to the ghosts, they can hear you-"
"Can't you be my boyfriend when I turn eighteen?" hes asking innocently.
Everything they've been through together in the last few years has been hell, literally. Yet, when it's for Dean Winchester, it's all
"My...neighbor, he's a few years older than us."
Bobby says, "Doin' better-" then his face falls. "Still yells about his father in the middle of the night though-"
"So fucking cute-" Castiel spanks his ass once more, then rubs the burn away.
Castiel follows him into the bathroom and he uses the urinal as well, both of them trying not to look at each others junk. After they zip up, Dean grabs a soda from the fridge and pays for it himself and Castiel didn't stop him from doing so.
Dean rolls his eyes, "Is it cool if me and Sam fix her up together?"
"Can't you wait until your uncle can't see us-" he smiles at Bobby, waving at him before they drive away from view. Dean forces him to pull over at the end of the dirt road for a few kisses. "Dean-" he's kissing his neck. "Fuck I like that-"
Before his uncle could respond or apologize for his insensitive words, the teen gets up from the table and storms off. "Dean!" he follows him outside, just in time to catch him running off next door. If he didn't have such a bad knee, maybe he would have run off after him but pissed or not he's just too old to be running after a moody teenager.
Castiel closes his newspaper and sets it down on the small table next to the rocking chair. "Come here-" his command is soft, friendly even. The boy scrambles to him and is shocked when he's lifted up onto the mans lap. "You sure you're okay?"
but just as quick as the man got horny, it all comes to a screeching halt. "Cas-" he exhales, "What's wrong?"
"My needs?" he finishes. "Dean, if this is about me watching porn-" the teen looks down at his lap. "I'm sorry, I honestly didn't think it would hurt you. I won't watch-"
His heart absolutely melts in his chest because of how sweet this kid is, "I like it-" and they both ignore their reality for just a few more moments.
Against his better judgement he begins to cry, the ugly kinda crying. He hadn't felt like crying a minute ago but the tears came nonetheless. She waits for him to calm down, handing him the box of tissues when she realized he was nowhere near done.
"What are you gonna do?" Dean asks.
Visitation day was tomorrow but he wasn't expecting his father to actually waste gas just to come see him for an hour, that thought alone has him miserable. After breakfast they get their usual hour of recreational time out in the yard which Dean spends sitting on the floor with his back towards the fence. His eyes just try to kill time by looking around and hopes that no one will get bothered by his wandering eye. It's purely innocent, since he can't watch television, he watches the other prisoners instead.
“You left me to fend for myself! Youuuuuu left for a month! Right after you asked me to move in!” Castiel roared, “You said you would take care of me!”
he's felt like this before and he's dreading going through all this again but tries his best to keep it together- a hot tear rolls down his flushed face anyway. The paramedic notices and pats him gently on the shoulder to give him some comfort but of course it doesn't- he's wearing a face mask, the driver was too- it scared him.
When he finally got a light, he inhales the smoke into his mouth- not his lungs, he learned that trick from Brady too. He's just going through the motions of smoking without trying to kill himself. That's when Castiel's car had pulled up right in front of him- he would stomp it out but the guy already saw him.
Dean nods, soon Castiel is bending him in half once again and the head of his large cock is pressing against his hole. "Cas-" it sounds nervous, so scared. "I'm-" but the cock is pushing, struggling to get in. "Aghhhh-" he groans in pain. "Aghhh-" it finally pushes in and it's so uncomfortable as it slides in deeper. He's so full, "Aghh-" and sucks in a breath, "I don't like it-" lets out a half cry, "Take it out-"
When he makes it to the kitchen, Castiel's already eaten by the looks of his empty plate and half filled coffee mug. He sits down without saying a word and begins to eat his scrambled eggs. It's not long before he's breathless- he tries his best to hide it but fails miserably. He has to settle for just drinking orange juice. Castiel watches him worriedly.
After his shower he goes straight to the bedroom, the fact that he had been helping Dean was forgotten. Castiel is still naked and wet when he lets himself fall onto the unmade bed.
The teens ears turn pink instantly and swallows before saying, "Shut up-" then takes another bite- moans. "I might just have sex with it after all-" It's meant as a joke because food tastes so damn good after a long day of work. His uncle throws a potato chip his way, it only serves to make them both laugh when he missed.
Castiel doesn't get it but says, "Okay-" anyway in a very far away tone.
so he excuses himself to go take a cold shower and head to bed.
"Don't you wanna fuck me right here?" he hops up onto the bathroom counter. "Please, I need you." he pulls him even closer, opening his legs wide so Castiel can fit between them and kisses his neck. Castiel groans again now that their crotches rub against each other creating the most delicious friction. "Daddy-"
"Thanks Bobby-" Dean slams the truck door shut and runs up to the diner.
As soon as he takes a sip, Dean perks up. "Oh my God, there's chocolate in this-" the straw is bitten down between his teeth as he sucks the straw, old habit.
"Dad uh- he would grab me, and he would hold me down." Dean coughs again, "He's take off his belt- and well you know what happens after that. He hit me with it."
"...I-I went for that beer. We became friends, John was loud and outspoken. Didn't care about anything. I was always so shy and quiet, I spent a lot of time alone." He kisses the boys head.
They're doing the walk of shame towards the patrol car when he sees
The pace is deep and hard, but slow and somehow tender. Every now and then a certain wet sound comes out of Dean but neither of them laugh because it's natural, it's normal.
Castiel breathes in his scent longingly,
Castiel wasn't an asshole, he cared about this kid but being locked up has exchanging pleasantries and playing twenty questions simmering on the back burner. Around four in the morning, he wakes up as usual- except this time there's a young teen in his arms that's clinging to him for dear life. A soft smile forms on his lips before kissing the boys hair and inhales the soft aroma of plain soap.
Dean looks to the floor and shrugs before saying, "I got scared Bobby-"
"Yes, I guess so-" his hands grip the teenagers waist possessively.
Dean sobs almost hysterically and Castiel pulls him in for a hug, hoping that it will calm him down. "Shh, please-" his voice is urgent, "Baby, please-" and he looks over his shoulder, fully expecting for the door to bust open to reveal a worried Bobby. "Please, stop crying-"
"Cas-" he doesn't know what to say.
"How do you feel?" Derek asks after a long hard day of work. They're both putting on their jackets before heading out to the Camaro in the parking out.
Dean got up, "It never matters when you actually have money. It matters to those who don't have it. I wish you the best life, Cas. " Dean smiled sadly before kissing the boys forehead, his heart breaking inside his ribcage.
Kevin says, "Dean?"
After a few seconds Dean comes up with a lie on the spot, "S'girl-" he swallows thickly, "-at the diner where I worked, kinda gave her my v card." and smiles weirdly in hopes of convincing him of the lie.
Growing up is hard and your body changing right before your eyes is no walk in the park. Of course he feels sympathetic towards him, puberty is difficult to go through. If only he knew puberty wasn't his only problem, it was the bear down the hall that wants him for dinner.
has his stomach feeling queasy since. The idea that Castiel only loves him because he's still technically a boy has his world flip flopping in uncertainty of their future.
Dean looks over to the very obviously empty swing again, "Mom said not to use bad words-" then looks up at the man towering over him. "She doesn't like it-"
"Baby girl, tell me you love me." Castiel's hands are kneading his ass cheeks like dough- it makes his boy moan like a whore.
"Bull crap." Sam snorts.
"You love when I talk to you like this baby?" Castiel coos, "My sweet girl. I love you so much and I love this pretty pink hole-" he laps at the eagerly twitching hole. "So fucking pretty, it's so pink and cute-" Dean moans louder, his hands grip the edge of the table. "I love fucking my baby girl-" he pushes inside of his boy-his saliva would have to do for lube this time, yet Dean never complains if it's forgotten. He loves Castiel's dick however it's given to him.
Dean leans in like he doesn't want anyone in the world to hear him, "I have this friend, named Charlie...I stole her panties." he covers his mouth with his hand like he just told a huge secret.
"Why?" Dean glares at him.
Tommy was sixteen years old and Castiel was about to turn thirty, of course what they had done was illegal. Obviously he didn't care, not enough to keep it in his pants because he defiled the boy. Even if he had wanted it because really, what he wants doesn't matter. According to the law- if they found out that is- he's now scum of the earth and should be burned alive.
Castiel smiles and digs into his own food, so does Bobby. When every bit of food that had been cooked has disappeared Bobby says, "What we doin', fishin' or huntin'?"
Castiel agrees instantly at the mention of his sons name. He'd been wanting to see the boy for a while now and wondered how he was doing these days. "I'll stay-" the front door slams, it was Dean getting dropped off by his friends mother once again. John quickly leaves the bedroom to go find the kid.
"They said I friggin' walk funny!" he shouts. "They were making fun of my stupid legs-"
"Get some sleep-" he kisses his forehead again, "I love you."
The younger of the two sticks out his tongue, "You taste salty-"
“I drank so much when you left.” He said sadly. “I didn’t know what to do. I felt like I was falling in love with you. Then you’re gone and I have to move on-before we really started.”
They make it back to the cabin safely, Dean didn't shoot one of them by accident and they start on dinner- they agreed upon hamburgers. This time Dean got to grill them on the fire, turning them over every few seconds or so. He wasn't much of a cook but grilling he could do, it was easy enough. Dean made two burgers for each of them and Castiel raved about them being so good- the slightly toasted bun was a nice touch.
"Fucking need you-" Dean says urgently, kissing Castiel's neck and decides to claim him. He sucks a bruise at the side of his neck where it's clearly visible. The older man moans loudly. Once his jeans and briefs are kicked off, the teen turns him around, placing a hand on his back to bend him over the table.
Castiel blinks his eyes once the door is opened to reveal him standing on his front porch. "You came-" he swallows, "Again-" In reality, he really should just be glad to see the love of his life after a hard day at work.
Dean looks up at him innocently, searching the mans blue eyes and they're telling the complete truth. "Yea, I know-" his hands are on broad shoulders before sliding down to his strong chest, groping with curiosity.
If I was older would you still treat me like that in the middle of a fight?-" he pauses, "-because I really doubt it. Bobby, like hell you would do to him what you to do me- and that's because you do respect him. Trust me, I know the difference. My dad hit me, but you hurt me with the things you say and the stuff you don't-"
Castiel leans in closer, "It probably triggered when you worried about me. It can happen during stressful times."
Dean yanks himself out of bed, "Don't wanna-" he pulls on his sweater over his basic black shirt. "-it ain't even that long."
It's midnight and he puts away his phone, unable to sleep. He can still  hear the TV in Castiels room. Dean gets up and goes to his backpack and pulls out a pair of pale pink lace panties. He stole them from his friend Charlie a while back when he was at her house for a school project. Why? he has no clue. Dean brings the panties to his nose and inhales, they're brand new. He's being a fucking perv but he could care less. He begins to pace around his room, rubbing the panties against the skin of his cheek until he gets the sudden urge to try them on.
"You drive me insane, Dean Winchester." Castiel grabs him by the hair roughly, kissing him in the mouth with such passion until his high subsides. They both lie there looking up at the motel room ceiling while their bodies recover from what they had done. "Are you okay?" Castiel asks because Dean's on the other side of the bed and hasn't said a word since he came. "Did I hurt you?"
"Bobby!" he walks in through the screen door.
Dean laughs softly, "I heard that-" and he's out the door, walking towards the large truck.
Castiel looks up at him, he was scrolling through his phone. "You can call me Cas-" he guides the boy to the couch.
Dean squeals with laughter when the swing goes way too high and eventually they're taking turns going down the slide that was only intended for children. Dean fit just fine, but Castiel had to work pretty damn hard to get through it. After a few tries, he gives up trying to fit and simply ends up catching the boy on his way down.
Dean watches the entire video in a jealous haze because he's feeling like he's not enough for the man he loves now. Sure, he watches porn too but it's not like he leaves fucking
She smiles sadly, "You're having a panic attack sweetie. You're okay, it's gonna pass."
When the movie is over, that erection had gone down and everything was right in the world once again. Dean expresses his dislike for the movie by pouting the whole walk to the car and it earned him a well deserved happy meal for sitting through some pretty scary stuff. Though after how Dean sat on his lap and clung to him so tightly, Castiel was pretty sure he would've bought him more than just a handful of chicken nuggets and a milkshake.
In the morning- Bobby and Castiel are already up and having breakfast at the kitchen table when Dean walks in with his laptop. "Morning." Castiel mumbles with his mouth full. "Where are you going?" the two men watch him put on his boots by the front door.
"Come on, you can do it-" the menacing pace continues relentlessly. "You can get there, come on baby-"
Dean laughs, "I get it, scared to see your old man huh?" Bobby smacks him on the head, it was meat to be playful but it stung. "Fuck Bobby I was just playing!"
He's pretty sure Castiel won't take care of him in this state and it'd be selfish to think he would after what he's done.
Castiel resists the urge to roll his eyes at the man, "Well, I
"That was awesome." Dean grins happily, putting the chainsaw in Bobby's truck.
She smiles, pulls out a chair and sits across from him. "Do your best, and I'll try to help. Sound good?"
Dean laughs, he loves saying things that make Castiel mad. "Do you think she'll bleed all over the bed when I pop her cherry?" his nose scrunches up.
Dean whimpers underneath him, his hands exploring up and down Castiel's strong back.  Castiel makes love to him, what started out passionately an hour earlier had turned into tender and gentle love making which had made Dean cry helplessly when it was over.
The bearded man looks up, surprisingly not pissed that his truck had gone missing for almost an hour. "Where'd ya run off to?"
"Dean-"
"That your dinner?" his eyes glance at the bag of chips as he moves around the kitchen to fix himself something to eat.
-" his voice cracks. "Hold this arm up-" he gestures to the arm with the cast.
Castiel whines tightly, "Oh my God-" because he's about come without ever touching his dick. Once again, he has a complete anal orgasm and trembles uncontrollably once it hits.
"I don't know why I'm doing this." He pulled the sheet off, cock popped out from underneath the sheet to rest against his skin. It stole a gasp from the boy. "Well now don't be shy...tell me what you think." Dean was nervous, but it didn't take from his over confident persona.
Once they make it back to his old house, Dean just stares at it while they sit in the car. He doesn't want to go in.
"No you're not."
"Don't wanna-" Dean's biting his lip too. "You're fucking sexy Cas- can't help myself." his lips find their way to Castiel's neck and he starts kissing- being mindful not to leave any marks. If Castiel wakes up with love bites, there's no one to blame it on.
The older man surprisingly opens the library door for him to walk through and it has him flushing in the face. Dean goes straight to the back where the romance novels where, they weren't the romance that was in your face, the romance was hidden somewhere in these books and he found it. He was so love sick, so touch starved that he somehow found comfort in the pages of these books.
Castiel was so shocked but happy. How could it be that he was able to change the ways of this man. The man who couldn't be bothered to remain faithful to anyone. To the man who wanted to belong to
By the time Bobby and Castiel walk inside, they find the teen siting on the couch in the living room with a blanket wrapped around himself and an open textbook on his lap. Castiel smiles, because he really looked so pretty wearing his new glasses. They make eye contact briefly, with Dean quickly looking down at his book to resume reading. He sits down next to the teen and would help him, if he understood anything about automotive mechanics.
Castiel shrugs, "No- last night meant nothing, he's a dancer." and their conversation was cut way too short after getting called in for an emergency surgery.
"Dean-"
Dean swallows the knot in his throat, "Are you breaking up with me-" and he's got to ask because to him, it sure sounds like it. "I didn't mean-" and there he goes, trying to apologize for something that is completely normal to be upset over.
Dean sighs and puts his phone on the table by his bed and does just that, sleeps. In the morning he awakens late and struggles to get ready in time for work. Bobby drops him off right up front, "Pick you up at three-"
He looks over at Dean in the kitchen, shoving half a waffle into his mouth. "I wasn't feeling that great." he lies. The sun was out and it had returned to being a normal day. Bobby ended up bringing out his chainsaw and chopping up that tree that the tornado had thrown into Castiel's window. With Dean's help of course. The kid was a maniac, laughing as he chopped up most of the tree.
Dean swallows, "Yea-" the stretch of his limbs took a short moment to get used to. "I'm okay-" he's given a quick kiss before the mans lips are going lower and lower, until they reach right underneath his balls. "Uh-" he sounds like he wants to giggle. "That tickles-" and then there's a long wet tongue pressing, lapping at his skin and it's suddenly not that funny. "
No answer.
"If you're messing with me-stop doing it." Castiel has to say because he knows how much this boy loves to push his buttons until he gets pissed. "Tell me all of this is a sick joke-"
the doctor. It's a damn threat and he's smart enough to smell it on every single of them. They
"Yes?? What the fuck." Castiel opened his mouth but closed it before he would say something he would regret.
Castiel nods, "I'm fine. You?" Dean shrugs, he leans forward so he can be closer to him. "What's wrong?"
"Yea!" his uncle calls, his heavy footsteps approaching.
Eventually there's a knock on the door and Derek Hale walks in with the biggest smile and he gulps. "Nervous?" The guy sits down on his stool and rolls it right up to where he's half laying down.
I've had the extra nightstand for years, hell since Cas fell and became human. I was so happy when he was human, but it didn't last and yeah, I was pretty upset he had sex with that April chick. I almost choked on my burrito when he told me he lost his virginity and I had to play it cool because the freaking giant of a brother was standing right there next to us in the library.
Castiel turns off the lights in his room and closes the door behind him. He's really not looking forward to sleeping next to John tonight so he makes himself comfortable on the sofa for the night and actually slept like a baby for the first time in a while. John hadn't come looking for him throughout the night either, probably a blessing in disguise- he couldn't go another round tonight, fucking or otherwise.
Dean starts crying prettily, "Daddyy-" some more whimpering. "Dad-"
to fuck you?" there's a short pause. "Because I could-"
happened, John actually gave him a hand job and was very sweet about it. The man whispered sweet nothings into his ear, making Castiel moan and melt under his touch. Everything was forgotten and forgiven, for now. "Ughh-" Castiel moans softly, watching the large hand stroke his cock lazily but firmly- just the right way to make him feel good. "Mmm-" his own hand wanders to the older mans hairy body, wrapping around his member.
While they eat breakfast the next morning- a car honks outside and Dean looks over his uncles head to see Castiel's car outside the window. "Where's he takin' ya?"
"What's all this-" Castiel says cautiously looking at a single lit candle at the center of the kitchen table. John actually pulls out his chair so he could sit. "Seriously what's all this-"
Dean says, "We came yesterday too but you were sleeping-" his fingers are playing with his IV line.
his voice cracks and he's unable to continue.
comes out of nowhere. "I'm- I'm not entertaining this with you, not until-"
Dean snorts, "Uh yea, I'm pretty friggin' sure I want him
Castiel smiles warmly, "No-" and steps closer. "Besides, you were the prettiest girl in the room tonight." his fingers brush through the teens light brown hair.
Dean's rolled onto his back now, and whimpers. "Please-" the belt is shoved into his mouth for him to bite on or maybe to gag him. "Hmmp-" his blinking, looking up hopelessly at the man above him.
"Don't you think I'm lonely too?" Castiel pulls away, his strong big hands cupping Dean's cheeks now- "I'm just as lonely."
"What happened?" Castiel comes outside and leans against the porch railing once the sun had gone down. "You've been sad all day."
Castiel's walking up the porch steps, hands on his hips and panting. "You did-"
Dean wants to keep on being upset but the look on his step dads face has him caving and going back on what he just said. "Fine, but I'm not gonna like it." They join Bobby in the car and head to the diner for some lunch.
Castiel opens the door to Dean's room, the window is still open. He'll question Dean in the morning about that.
"What's the matter Dean?" Derek walks in, smile beaming at him.
Castiel says while making his way down the ladder, "Hows it looking?" eyes squinting upwards to admire what he's done to the porch. The yellow lights were now hung up and twinkling prettily in the looming darkness of the night.
Dean is placed carefully into bed with Castiel crawling in next to him under the thick blankets. The teen is pulled against his chest for safety and the room is silent for a long time but they both are well aware that the other is awake due to some minor movements here and there. Dean's eyes peek up in the middle of the night to find the man still awake with his eyes fixed on the ceiling.
Dean mopes around the house until he manages to fall asleep. Before dinner Castiel knocks on the door and shakes a bottle of pills in the air when Bobby opens the door, "Got these for him." and walks in, heading for the teenagers room. "Dean-" he opens the door to see the boy asleep on his bed.
Just two years ago, the teen still had baby cheeks and now there's only
The teen carefully gets out of bed for a shower since what else was there to do at this ungodly hour. The shower was nice, water felt warm hitting his skin which helped him relax a little. Maybe he'd be able to get some sleep now that he was
All he knew is that he needed to find him and fast because the world is a big scary place with big scary people.
"There you are-" Bobby sighs, "-thought ya ran away on me, was lookin' for ya all over." he then chuckles, "Go on to bed, it's late. Tomorrow I need your help with-" his uncles words die off, becoming a buzzing sound in the back of his head.
Castiel begs her with his eyes,"Why won't you let me forget that we slept together?"
"I'm scared." Jo pulls away from the kiss, her hands tugging her night dress down. Dean follows the movement and his eyebrows shoot up in interest, her night gown doesn't cover nowhere near past her knees. It captures his interest.
"Let's be serious, please!" he yells at everyone. Another coach rolls in the television/vhs combo into the gym and everyone knows it's about to get good. They watch a cartoon video about the dangers of sex and all it's consequences. From teen pregnancy, to sexually transmitted diseases- all the boys groaned in disgust on that one. "So!" The coach roars once again. "Do you boys understand the horrible dangers of sex?"
"No, he doesn't know where you live." Benny pats his shoulder before getting up, he's about to head out when he stops to say- "I'd never hurt you, I've known your uncle for years." he smiles once more before closing the door behind him.
Dean can't fathom that the guy was able to resist being called
good. When his orgasm starts building low in his stomach, he pushes down his boxers to his knees so he can really work himself over.
Castiel rolls Dean over on his stomach yet again, "Do you remember when I devoured this bubble butt, hmm?" he gives one plump cheek a squeeze "Do you?"
"Cas, please."
They both enter the bathroom together but only Dean goes into an empty stall on his own. Castiel can hear him
Dean asks, "Are you back in school?"
Now they were having more fun and Dean chose a pair of panties to take home, to wear for
Dean stayed angry and drove off. The thought that he would be considered abusive in what he thought began as a tender moment infuriated him, sure he is into alot of bad things such as rough crazy sex. Hell he know's he's an adrenaline junkie and live's for hookup's and random fling's but he doesn't want that with him.
Bobby was still on the fence about Castiel, but at least punches weren't being thrown.  They spoke like they usually did, respectfully and even shared some jokes among themselves. Dean was liking this a whole lot better, it's like he had his step father and his uncle without any of the drama of sneaking around.
Meg opens the door wearing a large men's shirt that goes down to her knees and her hair is a complete mess on her head. "What are you-" she blinks up at him. "
On his way back he had gotten a little drenched in the rain that was just starting to pelt over the earth, "You better go on and take a shower, you'll get sick." Bobby says, already looking in the closet for an extra towel and a shirt that they all know will be too big for him. "Go on-"
they called his mom-" inhales sharply, talking fast. "His mom grounded him
"I was going to warn you not to eat dinner tonight-"
He's got no idea what just happened or why but now he doesn't hate John Winchester so much. If only he had known that the man was a master manipulator who would go to drastic lengths to get what he wants.
Dean props himself on his elbows, looking completely fucked out and sad. "But I wanted-" he's doesn't want to move just yet because he hates how it feels getting up with come in his ass. "
Dean sighs heavily, still twitching in some parts of his body. "Probably-" Castiel doesn't seem to have liked that comment because he doesn't say anything, just gets up from his bed and leaves the room.
"Yea. Uhm- he pulled my jeans down-" Dean looks at his clean fingernails- remembering how he clawed at the dirt and gravel as it happened-when he got home he had to scrub them clean for half an hour- he closes his eyes. "It hurt so bad." he swallows.
When no ones looking he wipes his greasy fingers on the same napkins that had their phone numbers written on them and straight to the garbage they go because he's not interested in any of the girls here. He's already taken, even if secretly. The boys notice that too and begin to gossip about him. Dean over hears them calling him gay behind his back, overhears them laugh about how he walks- he has to get out of there before he slams all of their faces into the floor or before he cries.
Castiel's panting, tossing the can aside. "You're a nightmare-" and he's not angry, he's horny and wants to fuck the teen for being a little shit.
"He sat down-he kept asking me about my parents and why I was all alone." Dean sighs heavily, wiping the last of his tears away. "He asked me if I wanted to work for some money, I said yes but I-I thought he meant work like, mowing his lawn or somethin'-I know it was stupid but I knew the fifty Bobby gave me wouldn't cover the cost of the cars-"
"Guess I'm just as blind as Cas-" and he sulks, watching his uncle eat.
The boy nodded.
"Huh?" the mans large hairy hand ends up rubbing up and down his thigh, "Oh you think I'm a-" the man nods hungrily. "Yea-" Dean laughs, "-I'm not."and he punches the guys nose hard enough to break. "Friggin' creep-" he gets out and makes a run for it. The man yells something he couldn't understand because he was already too far away.
"Because-" Castiel chuckles, "-every time I poke fun at you, it gets you all worked up." Dean pouts. "It's okay baby, some people get off on it-" he presses a kiss to his hair. "-we can have some real fun, now that I know about that little kink of yours."
Castiel leans in and before realizing, his nose is gently rubbing against Dean's in a very shy eskimo kiss that makes them both giggle. Hearing the boy laugh so prettily was fire to keep him doing it for a while longer, until it wasn't safe to do so anymore.
Surely Bobby feels guilty for keeping his mothers whereabouts from him, but he knows his nephew and he'd come back when he's had the chance to cool off.
Castiel smiles sadly, "Not really no. He was drinking as usual, I was trying to get him into bed and he sort of fell on me. Then kissed me."
Dean turns around and looks pissed, "If you really wanted to, you would've married me already-"
Dean blinks away a few tears, they fall down his cheeks and mix with the water going down the drain. Before he steps out he closes his eyes and whispers, "Please-" and he dresses himself in something comfortable to sleep in. It's not enough- he goes outside and stands on the front porch, leaning over the railing and looks up at the star filled night sky. "I need you-" he says softly. "Please help me." yet again he doesn't know who he means his words to. Maybe his mother, maybe God himself.
They eat in her bedroom like friends do and she's instantly back to her bubbly self. "Thanks, Dean-" she blushes. "I felt so bad earlier-" then there's some awkwardness between them due to this specific situation.
Dean looks over his shoulder to see that the man had fallen asleep, or was simply pretending to in order to escape the conversation. He lays in silence, unable to fall asleep when a distinct snore from behind let's him know that he really had fallen asleep.
"Oof-" he huffs before crawling under the thick covers. A quick glance at his watch lets him know that it's almost time for class, which has him punching the mattress at his side before hauling himself out of his bed.
Castiel frowned, " I left my car at the store but...I mean, I'm not tired at all and I would really like to see that Chevy Impala you claim to be working on back at your's. "
"I guess you're right."
Dean's still naked when he takes a seat on the toilet fully expecting something to happen but it never does. When he gets up he notices that he feels wet and sticky back there so once again he uses an entire roll of toilet paper to dry himself off. He didn't dare tell his father about this since the guy would probably do worse to him than dry hump him over his pajamas or feel him up with his fingers.
and get ready for bed. Castiel had been up past midnight due to having to clean the house before calling it a night.
No sign of Dean. After getting up to wash his face he decided to go exploring, he looked down the hallway and found stairs leading down to what he assumed would be the living room. "Dean?" he called out quietly,  "Dean..." right then he found him as he turned a corner into the living area. Dean, sitting naked on his couch.
"That's all I ask." He kisses the teens forehead, "I miss your laugh-" Castiel suddenly admits, "You used to laugh so much-"
Dean's smile falls, "I was supposed to graduate this year. But with everything that happened-"
Castiel smiled as if drunk. “I like you so much Dean-” After realizing his confession he stopped, his hands reaching up to rub Dean’s chest. So soapy and wet. Firm.
"Alright-alright-" Bobby shields himself just in case, "You're an attractive kid, but ya don't need to be havin' sex-"
"Love you too-" Dean looks up again, his chin resting on the mans chest. "Didn't know my dad hurt you like that-"
"Okay-" Dean says, too focused on his homework to notice the look of despair on the doctors face.
Dean shook his head, looking down at the mess as if saying
"More like you covered in bees." he winks.
Dean nods, "Yea I know-" his uncle gets up to grab a soda from the fridge, handing it to him before taking his seat. "Thanks-" he cracks it open, it pops loudly in the calmness of the home.
"You know me, I can sleep through anything." he shrugs, pouring himself a glass of juice and leaving the jug on the table as he goes back to his room. Castiel asks him what on earth he's going to do in there, he responds with- "Jack off! What else!"
"You'd make a hell of a wife, Cas-" his voice drawls.
Castiel focused on the road, "What?"
When he's out of the shower- he changes into boxers and a shirt- his own this time. After laying down he unlocks his phone to see the missed call- he's not excited. He feels abandoned. Refusing to call back- he simply falls asleep. He kept thinking- If he loves me, he'll come get me.
"You have money for beer but not for Sammy's school supplies-" he's ignored and that pisses him off. "-I had to steal a fucking pack of pencils and paper for the kid!"
"You mean I didn't do a good job, I fixed those cars-"
"Ah, right-" Castiel smiles and they eat in comfortable silence until he mentions, "It's getting pretty cold outside, wanna go pick out a jacket?" since the boy just shrugs in response he takes that as a yes. "Great, finish up your food and we'll get going-" Castiel stands up, kissing the top of his head- quickly realizing that was weird and he plays it off like he didn't just do that.
Castiel looks up for a few seconds and returns to reading, "I don't need you to suck anything."
"I'm naked!" He hissed up at him, "I wasn't expecting anyone to come in here this late and plus I was asleep!" he then realized there was no way to get to any clothing without leaving the bed and revealing himself to the teenager. Dean sighed in annoyance before dragging himself off the bed and wrapping his lower half with the thin sheet. "Take the bed, I'll sleep-"
The teen snorts, "Shut your fucking face-" and they both chuckle. "Think we can get somethin' to eat at the hotel?" he looks over his shoulder at the lovely resort in the distance, it's the one they stayed at the last time they came here.
anyway. It's not until word gets back to him that Tommy is sick or something, that he won't leave his room for anything. Apparently the school counselors were saying that it was anxiety or possibly depression, it spooked everybody because Tommy used to be such a lively boy.
He chuckles, "Longer than that-"
Castiel licks his lips and ignores his own food, focusing more on his coffee and the boy sitting in front of him. As soon as Dean's finished with his food, he hopes off the chair and shuffles to the living room for some more cartoon watching.
"Dean-" she asks nervously, looking at an angry Castiel.
Dean shoves him away and Castiel almost falls off the bed. "You hurt me today Cas- you're not gonna fix it by kissing me, I have self respect too." he wipes his mouth on the back of his hand. "Try somethin' else-" and he picks up his the magazine again, signaling to the older man that the conversation is
Dean softly says, "A little-" and he holds Castiel's hand briefly, until the man grabs a shopping cart. That also had been a first and Castiel wonders why he even held his hand in the first place. They were getting close, but they certainly weren't
He hadn't noticed that Castiel had gone back inside, he hoses off his dirty hands outside before heading in. He's almost done with his soda when Castiel calls him- "Yea?" he calls back. No response. Dean tosses the empty can in the trash and follows Castiel's voice. It's coming from his room- "Hey-" he smiles, crossing his arms at the sight before him. Castiel lays on his bed, completely nude and rock hard. "That for me?" his eyes glance down at the girth between his step fathers thighs.
After class on Thursday, the students are let out early so Dean and Ash find themselves carpooling in Ash's beat up car to the diner for something to eat. Dean ordered a ham and cheese sandwich with a large soda. It was Ash's first time at this particular diner, so he ordered the same thing as the younger teen. They chat about school, among other topics while waiting for their food.
"Maybe not right away, but when you're old-"
"Yea?" his eyes are shut so tight he's seeing stars behind his eye lids.
"Damn it, Dean." Castiel closes his eyes, willing away the large erection in his pants.
Castiel runs his fingers through the short brown hair, "Words don't mean anything in here." after a short pause. "I didn't rape you, you know that don't you?"
Castiel has been working his new job at the hospital for almost two weeks and it has Dean feeling lonely and neglected. Since he was so busy, Bobby had driven him to his next therapy session. At least he went in by himself, that was a win in his book. The last session had been way too revealing for his comfort, the things that were said in that hour long session were things he planned to take to the grave. Although it wasn't so, he couldn't help but think that was the reason Castiel seemed so distant. His anxiety has him thinking such awful things at times, when nothing makes sense, his brain finds the worse possible scenario and calls it fact.
"I didn't preheat the oven so maybe twenty minutes-" Castiel says distractedly from where he was sat the table as well, eyes glued to the computer screen.
"I wanted pie-" Dean says softly. Instead of paying- Castiel orders them all a slice of pie and some coffee. He doesn't know what's going on with Dean, he'd have to have a talk with him later. In private, without his uncle to listen in.
"Cas? um-" Dean's soft voice squeaks in the silence- the movie was over. "Is it time for bed?"
Dean gets pissed but keeps himself under control, "No, man. He's not-" after a few seconds he lies, "He's never touched me. I-I just have a crush on him, that's all-"
“Maybe he moved. “ Castiel whispered.
"Oh, hey Cas-" he smiles, "How's it going?" and sits down at the table, grabbing a slice of the pizza that was nearly gone.
Castiel was freshly showered and wearing the same sweatpants. "Dean, go home-" he orders once more and the teen says
Dean rushes into bed next to him and pulls the shirt over his legs when he catches the older man checking them out. "Stop eye raping me-" his tone is soft, shy almost.
"Agh-"
"Robin broke up with me." he says it and crosses his arms at his chest like a toddler. "She doesn't want to keep our secret anymore."
"Oh-" Dean looks down at his nearly finished sandwich before he picks it up and starts eating again. Castiel finishes first so he just watches the boy, with a smile on his face. "What-" he eventually asks.
After dinner Dean goes to the bathroom, locking the door. Once his teeth are brushed for the night, he catches a glimpse of his uncles razor and the pack of blades next to it. He thinks about it for a full minute before pulling one out of the tiny box before sitting down on the bathroom floor. Dean's leaning back against the tub before lifting the sleeve of his flannel so he could do it.
Castiel can't help himself suddenly and pulls the teen up against him, one eyebrow raising dominantly. "I love you-" the words sound erotically charged, almost nasty.
"Go to your room." Castiel demands when his door creaks open, he's sitting up in bed reading a book. "I don't want you in here tonight."
"How about this one?" he asks the indecisive teenager who shakes his head after taking a whiff of something called Lemon Pound Cake. "Then you choose one-" he puts Lemon Pound Cake back on the shelf and lets the boy decide.
He doesn't know who to choose. Brotherly bonds or
Castiel is laying in bed after a cold shower when his phone starts buzzing loudly from where it was set on the nightstand, startling him. "Dean-" he quickly sighs heavily the second the answers the call. "Is something wrong? It hasn't been more than two hours since I saw you-"
"The things I let ya get away with-" his words are spoken quietly as to not awaken the sleeping man.
"You heard me."
They hadn't intended on it but it happened since neither one of them had stopped things from escalating. What Dean will take to the grave about this encounter is that he was thinking about his step father the entire time.
Dean eats his fruit loops at the kitchen table when John stumbles out through the front door late for work. John rarely pays any attention to him and he's used to it by now. When he's done he pushes the bowl away and goes padding down the hallway barefoot- noticing their bedroom door was slightly open.
"Not gonna hurt you." He kisses the back of Dean's freckled earlobe a few times, "Been wanting to fuck you for a while-" and he struggles some more, "Come on, daddy get's to fuck you-" and that comment pisses him off so much that he headbutts Brady in the face with the back of his head and both of then groan in pain. "Fuck!"
But Dean didn't think it was funny, it worried him even more. "Why the hell would you think you were dead?" they're eating so Castiel doesn't answer right away, he just shrugs in response.
Dean looks at them, "Sure, just broth." Later that night Castiel comes in with a bowl of warm broth and a spoon- "Thanks." he takes it, "My stomach keeps giving me problems. " he deflects.
he does so anyway because he doesn't remember the last time he's had a cleaning. It's not like John cared enough about him to take him to the dentist twice a year like he's supposed to, after his mom left- all dentist and doctors appointments were a thing of the past.
, but the man already knew that.
Today is no different when Castiel walks through that door- he finds the home in complete darkness. It's one in the morning after all. There's a flickering of lights and shadows as he makes his way down the hall to their bedroom,
"Yea." Dean stops, "Bobby, if I was gay. Would you shoot me?"
Bobby comes closer, he's nervous. "I thought you were gay-" he whispers loudly.
Dean started to hum Metallica under his breath. It had always calmed him down when he was nervous.
You're
His fingertips feel so hot, they're burning his skin. They feel so hot that his back is arching up off the bed at the sensation. The teen is groaning in pain or pleasure, it was hard to tell, the whole thing is confusing. Loud painful moans escape his parted lips in the darkness of his cold room, surprisingly his uncle never hears any of this. The feel of a firm and heavy hand is sliding lower, and lower.
As soon as Dean crosses those double doors, following the guard to get himself processed. First, Dean gets his picture taken for his ID card. Next, comes the finger prints and he kept a lid on the complaining even though the guards were being a little too rough with him. Then, he's forced to strip his clothes completely in front of two other guards.
Castiel laughs, "No baby- I just changed my name to Castiel when I became christian." he looks over at the boy again. "Would you rather call me Jimmy?"
Once inside the bar, Castiel sit's down at a table near the back while John orders their beers and a basket of wings to share. His eyes look around in instant boredom, all he wants to do is go home and get to sleep. A long day awaits him tomorrow- he's got to take Dean to the library for God only knows what, he forgot to ask. Not to mention going to the store to find two different kinds of pie, if there's any left that is. Leaving things to the last minute was a mistake, surely the stores would be crowded tomorrow and the
The teen waves him off almost aggressively, still pacing back and forth. Eventually he looks up for a moment and walks back to the house. "Yea?" his voice is slightly annoyed.
Castiel swallows, "Uh- that's fine, I'm not mad." Dean looks at him again, guilt in his eyes. "You're just curious, but your dad should probably talk to you about these things though-" he shrugs. "-It's not really my place."
"What do you want?" Castiel whispers, Deans legs fall open and wrap around him. They're both crotch to crotch now. Castiel's eyes roll back in his head before he closes them.
Dean lets go, his lips are swollen and dark pink- saliva and pre come dripping down his chin. Blue eyes wipes it away with his hand. "Daddy." Dean looks up at him, he's so pretty and innocent at times. "Ruin me, come on-"
Dean watches his uncle go up the porch steps and disappear through the screen door. His eyes look up at the starless sky while thinking about everything that's happened in the last week. It's not long before he hears Castiel's car drive up next door and simply observes the guy getting out of the all to familiar vehicle, totally oblivious to him sitting on the lawn chair.
Castiel snorts, "I never loved you."
"I know you didn't eat much today-" next he pulls out a sealed pack of pop tarts from the waistband of his uniform. "These are for you."
Dean rolls his eyes, "We're all monsters here."
Dean had been in his room, flipping through the pages of an old playboy he'd stolen from the gas station a while back when his phone pings with a message. It was from Castiel, simply asking him to come over if he could manage to get away. He types up a quick response of-
Derek laughs, "Ohh!" running a hand over his face. "Pretty wild girl to give you a hickey like that-" his eyes focus on the love bite once more but really just happy that no one was abusing this kid.
Dean looks around, his hand starts ghosting over the bulge in his pants and It feels good. It's been so long since he's had sex at all, with Castiel of course and it's been so long since he's even touched himself. His fingers contemplate doing something about the erection in his pants, he decides to go for it- his eyes fixed on the front door. Last thing he needs is Castiel catching him jerking it in the car he just gave him. He unzips his jeans and pushes them down just enough for his dick to spring up, he sighs, eyes fluttering shut for a few seconds. His eyes are fixed on the door once again, he begins to stroke slowly and lazily. His eyes dart over to the larger window of the house next to the garage, he can see Castiel there. Walking around in the kitchen making something. Dean bites his lip and focuses his eyes at Castiel instead, they never leave the kitchen curtains open for this reason- you can see right in but for once he's glad they're open.
"Oh?" Castiel looks over at him briefly while he drives.
After dinner they're on the couch watching some television when Castiel says, "I'm not leaving Dean-" and gestures between them. "-this was just-"
Dean glares at him, "You're kidding-"
John Winchester was good at faking the art of seduction, manipulation too. That's how they ended up sitting down for a movie on Castiel's day off and John was he was just glad that the theatre was dark enough so they wouldn't be seen since they were in his neck of the woods.
Once the loud zipper rips through the early morning silence, John looks over his shoulder to see that it was
After he investigates each room in the house, he's now regretting having rented the large old home and is fondly missing living at Bobby's, because there's strength in numbers, three under one roof is better than one. Once he's sure the coast is clear he locks up the front door, back door and double checks that all the windows are closed. He didn't consider what Dean had said earlier, he'd already forgotten about that in his haste to finish his meal.
"Oh yea?-" he takes a large gulp of his root beer soda and does it again just to piss him off. Bobby does it too, though it wasn't as loud. "Nice try Bobby-"
Castiel shrugs, "I don't know but I don't like it-" he rubs at his sleepy tired eyes. "Fuck, that's all I need- your father visiting me from the after life." After a moment of silence in the room he asks, "Can you sleep over?"
Dean doesn't think it's funny, but perhaps he just had to be
Castiel leaves him alone. He was not like John and would never hurt Dean physically. After a long shower he finally emerged from the bathroom. Naked and wet with only a fluffy white towel wrapped around his waist. His hair was sticking out from every which way. Maybe he was a little jealous but he couldn't understand why. He didn't have the guts to say he heard him and his dad bang like bunnies all night. He couldn't tell him he had to hide in his closet, listening to music with his headphones at full blast just to keep all that moaning and groaning away. He swears he can still hear it. The ghostly moans of his dad fucking him.
Castiel exhales a shaky breath as well, "I want to make love to you-" the grip on the teens hand tightens for a second. "I want you begging me for more, I want you to get rid of that fear of being touched-"
All it says is-
Dean's feeling scared even though he doesn't know why, he's thinking Castiel is
"Alright-" the guard grabs the large plastic bag with his things, handing them off to another guard. "Follow me, we're going to medical-"
"Uh, Cas-" the man looks up at him, "You're kinda,
Dean nods, sliding off his sweatpants- not at all surprised by the sight of Castiel's cock already free underneath him. "Cas-" he whines while strong hands guide him down over that familiar thickness, it pops in- it's dry and rough but he only uses two inches to fuck his boy with. "Oh God-" it burns- but it's so good. They drown in their loud groans and sweat in the small space of the car. Their skin becomes so sweaty and sticky it quickly becomes harder and harder to grind against eachother.
"He's sick and wanted me to ask you if you could go pick up some medicine for him."
"Can ya take an extra few days off work?"
"Damn it." Castiel sighs, "Do you think-" and Dean elbows him in the ribs lightly- a cue for him to shut up. During dinner Bobby laughs and chats with Dean at the table like he didn't see anything, so maybe he really didn't.
"I'm so confused!" Dean whines, burying his face in the older man's neck and grabs at him with need. Holding on to him for dear life.
It turns out that Dean wasn't outside working, but simply wandering around the large property as if contemplating his life or something. Bobby whistles for him and the teen only waves dumbly, making no effort to come join him for work. He looks up once in a while to make sure the boy is still around, of course he was but now noticed that his lips were moving. Was he
Dean felt himself being watched, “Change your mind about another orgasm?” he started running the bar of soap all over his chest and stomach, his hair wet and sticking to his forehead. “Hmm?”
"I lied-" he swallows, "A girl didn't give me the hickey." and looks down. "It was a guy-" their eyes meet again.
"For a day's work?" he's cautious but takes it anyway, pocketing the cash in his jeans. "Bye?" he says and the man nods so he basically skips down the porch steps and runs off with his pocket full of cash. Castiel falls on the couch, cursing himself for cheating because he was smarter than that.
Dean cups the older mans face in his hands and studies him, his eyes looking at every line and crease on his face. It seems to make Castiel uncomfortable because he looks down, as if in humiliation. When Dean kisses him, that's when he looks up to meet his gaze. "Love you-" the words are whispered.
"Hmm?" he looks at her impatiently.
and it was time to get himself together.
"You okay?" John whispers. Castiel nods but no, he isn't okay. "Guess I shouldn't have you let you drink-"
"No baby that's not it-" he sits down next to him. "Why would you think that?"
Dean wants to go over to him and just fucking get married like a big boy but his feet are stuck to the floor. What he does do, is give the man a signal that he'll be right back once again- fuck, why does this man love him so much if he's like
Castiel waves him off and gets into the pool like a freaking sore loser but even so, he's got to follow
for him until he couldn't take it anymore and finally took a full bite out of him.
couldn't be his fucking problem. His stomach was growling so he stops by some burger place and grabs something on the way home. His step fathers cash was burning a hole in his pocket even if he had earned it honestly. By the time he parks in front of the house, his mood is beyond bad.
"Yea-" he smiles, "So? I'm sure she can keep a secret, plus she's friggin' hot."
Dean blushes and opens his mouth without questioning anything. "Ah-"
Castiel nods, his gloved hand comes up to rub the teens cheek a little. While he's drinking the orange juice he tells him-"So unless your appendix ever bursts or your gallbladder needs taking out, I don't want to see you in a hospital again. Got it?" the teen agrees and he pulls down his face mask to give him a quick peck on the lips. "Think you got one more infusion  left and you're free to go home-" he checks the gold watch on his wrist, "Probably by the time I'm done working today, you'll be leaving with me. How's that sound?"
Castiel looks at the teen with no emotion before nodding and leaning over to rest his head on his shoulder. It's something the man rarely does, especially not like this but there was no choice but to be vulnerable at a time like this.
because neither of them are thinking of divorce. So why not go all out for this- again, even if it was just a quick courthouse wedding.
"Cheer up-" Bobby says, "-she's just gunna help ya."
Castiel and Meg look at each other before standing up to help him, "Stand for me, Dean." Dean stands, and he feels a little more stable. "Can you hear me?" Dean nods. "As I was saying, you are experiencing anxiety but like I thought- you do have a severe Vitamin D deficiency, mild anemia and you are lacking B12." he gives the clipboard to Meg, "Are you with me?" Dean nods again but no he is not fucking with him.
Later that evening when he emerges from the shower he just has to go ask why exactly he's here now of all days. "Sam, with everything happening right now- shouldn't you be home?"
Castiel shrugs stupidly, "Meg said-"
Castiel uses his stern voice, "No."
maybe?
buzz was wearing off fast.
Dean smiles, shrugging. "I may have gone into your wallet a few times-" their eyes meet. "That piss you off?"
in the world. He doesn't have his own children but with Dean he's got the best of all possible worlds. "You have to finish high school first, or get your GED."
Dean blinked harshly as if he was awoken from a deep sleep, sunlight from outside was blinding due to the pending sunset on the horizon. " Wha? "
Getting married meant a honeymoon, no matter how cliche it sounded. Marriage meant a lifetime of what they already have.
He sees Dean and his uncle at the kitchen table- eating. There's a big sandwich in front of Dean that appears to already be half eaten- good. "Work up an appetite?" he asks smugly as he takes a seat.
on him and now he thinks that
He's stuck in his own thoughts for a while and hears Castiel asking him something- "Has Bobby said anything about me?" he shakes his head. "I knew he was suspicious of me- but he hasn't mentioned anything? Does he still think-"
"Not this again, stop." Dean gets angry, but still sips on the broth. He's hungry and he knows he could eat but he's worried- his heart felt like it was about to stop back at the diner. "Fine, you want the truth?" Castiel nods, "My chest hurt. Alright? At the diner- I got freaked out and I'm scared."
"I'll go wait-" but the girl is dragging him inside against his will, and he wants to leave but a part of him wants to browse. So he does the cliche gay best friend thing and helps her pick out a couple things to wear for that guy she's been seeing, the one she met at the diner. "So, what's this guy like-" he seems very distracted by the lingerie set in his hand, then places the dainty undergarment back in it's place on the rack.
Dean's slipping into his jeans which now fit a little baggy on him, and he's slipping on his hoodie too. Which fits him baggy as well. He says, "Sam found this dead cat near some trees by our school- we're gonna go poke it-"
Castiel hesitates, "My son." It's not like she would know if he was or not. He had to say it was his son otherwise it'd be suspicious- walking into a hotel with a minor at four in the morning.
The front door slams loudly a little before one in the morning, startling Castiel from sleep. It's not long before the messy haired teen stomps heavily into the bedroom with a poorly made sandwich in his hand.
He puts his bowl in the sink and sneaks off to his room thinking he can 'rub one out' before Castiel comes out from the shower. After sitting down he takes out his phone and googles porn. He wants to watch something, to find a video that has a guy that looks like Castiel. He feels kind of guilty but he doesn't care in that moment.
"How old she?" he asks quietly.
He shrugs, "The simple life's great Cas." he opens his eyes, looking up at his step dad. The look on his face has him saying, "You gotta chill, learn to relax." he closes his eyes again.
Castiel gulps, "Excuse me?" this woman was bold, too bold. "I wasn't-" he stutters. "I have-"
Dean sniffles, wiping under his eyes. "I guess-" they watch television for a while in silence, or pretend to at least. "It hurt-" inhales sharply. "How come it doesn't hurt when you do the
"What? No, it doesn't bother me." Castiel smiles weakly, their friendship already feels strange, strained even and not how it did when they first met up at the bar. The kiss changed things and he doesn't understand why, John wasn't gay. Surely a straight man would have already forgotten about the minor mishap in miscommunication.
pain and loss he felt over it. Would the reality be more
Castiel nods, rubbing up and down his back. "Pray for us." he whispers into his ear and the boy nods. "Look at me." he orders Dean, who peels away to look into his eyes. "I love you, do you understand me?" he nods, a tear rolling down his cheek. "No matter what happens, I will always love you." they both swallow the knot in their throats and share a passionate kiss.
They talk about things over their coffees for a while and Castiel must have been there three hours total before finally getting up from her couch. Work was a no go today and by hour two, he had already called in sick. "I should get going and you need your rest-" he smiles apologetically.
"You didn't kill Cas on the drive home-" he admits quietly. "You were so mad-"
Castiel drops his bag on the floor before rushing over to where the screams were coming from and bangs on the bathroom door. "Dean, open up! It's me!" as soon as the boy opens the door, it was evident that he was crying by how puffy and red his face was.
"That's my good boy-" he says soothingly, "You're my good boy-"
Dean smiles, he's trying so hard not to laugh. "Yeah, Um. Can I show you something?"
Castiel rolls over and pins him to the bed, "How about a game?" there's a playful threat in his voice. He leans in to whisper, "You can even call me daddy all you want for this one-" Dean bites his lip, nodding. "Good boy-" they share one brief kiss. "I love you sweetheart-"
Castiel blinked, "What?"
"Really?" Dean looks into his blue eyes, he won't admit it but it got him a little emotional. Castiel nods, "Can't live without you either, Cas."
"I said no-" Dean states with a hint of a smile because he loves to torture the guy. "But I can be convinced-"
Little did Castiel know, Claire's mother never put her up for adoption- she only told him that so he wouldn't come looking for her ever again.
Dean looks down at their joint hands and smiles because he loves holding hands with the man, though he'd never come out and just say it. "Yea-" he leans over to kiss him on the lips once before getting up to go home.
Dean nods, reaching over the table and planting one right there on his cheek.
His heart is pounding in his chest like he's just run a mile. He takes a deep breath and tries to calm himself, that's when the door slams shut. There's nowhere to hide now that the boys father is home, so he does his best to sneak into bed like he'd been there the whole time and wait for his lover to join him in the bedroom.
Derek pats him on the shoulder, all the teen can see over the bright overhead light shining in his eyes is a face mask and medical glasses. "It'll be over in no time-" he gets things ready and explains, "I'm going to use this drill first-" demonstrating so that the teen can see what's going to happen in his mouth.
"I mean, what did you think I did all day?" there's a pause. "Here, I help Bobby and there's stuff to do but back home- Jesus, Cas. I was dying before your eyes and you didn't even notice."
Dean holds his tongue for now. "Come on." he turns on the shower and moves to help the man strip off his clothes. He was all too familiar with this, having helped John in his drunk mess many times before. "Get in, you smell like shit."
Castiel speaks up when Dean won't, "Why are you fighting at school?" he asks at a red light.
Things happened to change one Sunday while they were at church for mass and Castiel couldn't seem to keep his eyes off of one of their new neighbors children. This particular boy was just a mere sixteen years old and very
The mess was instantly forgotten and he goes inside to sneak in a swig of his uncles whiskey to numb the pain. Dean gets on his tip toes in order to reach the top of the fridge where the guy always kept a bottle, hidden behind a few cereal boxes. "Agh-" he winces again before unscrewing the cap and chugging. After a while he begins to notice that a little more than he meant to drink is gone. Not the whole bottle, not even half, but it was enough for his uncle to notice.
Dean smiles sweetly, "Like for real?" and the man nods before giving him another gentle kiss. "You make me feel all soft-"
"Sure, Cas." What better way to spend an afternoon than to watch some psycho bitch holding a writer hostage in her home. Dean lets his head fall back, his arms wrapping around himself as the movie begins. Castiel is so into the movie he doesn't notice Dean watching him, he's gazing at his profile dreamily.
When the pair part ways, Dean becomes tear eyed and of course tries to hide it. The ending got to him most of all, and that's when the water works come, unable to hold it in any longer. His palms press against his wet eyes as if that would somehow stop the tears from coming.
When John sees him take out beef and a packet of corn tortillas, along with onions, tomato and lettuce from the fridge, he whistles. "Beef tacos tonight huh-" the doctor nods, drizzling oil on the sizzling pan. "You sure know what I like." They eat in comfortable silence, aside from Johns occasional crude comment about something that happened at work. "Dean!" he roars eventually, when there's only enough beef for one last taco for his son. "Here-" he makes the taco in a hurry before handing it to the small boy when he eventually appears before them. "Take this to your room and eat it."
Dean nods, "Yea-" he opens the door more, now Castiel can see his entire face.
Dean frowns again, "I had an infection once." Now Castiel's confused, taking his hand again. "When I was little I got taken to the hospital because I couldn't take a piss. Like it hurt like hell to go..dunno how I got it."
Dean clutches to the back of his uncles flannel for dear life, "No-" and then says, "Why do I have to be so fucked-" he believes something is wrong with him, for going after a grown man at such a young age. Castiel said it himself,
Castiel nods, "No one can fuck you like I can-" and pushes into the already loosened hole, slamming all the way in and the teen actually squeals for the first time since he was thirteen. "You got that?"
" Sir, Can't we work something out... I don't know what to do about this but I'm sorry, My parent's taught me better, I swear. "
"What?" Dean says, taking a step back.
"Sure-" Dean hides his face in his mug. "-I'll ask my uncle or my step dad to take me."
Dean winces at the touch, "I'm okay dad-" and finishes his cereal even though the touch still bothers him. It didn't take long before Castiel returned with a small plastic cup of hospital ice cream which surely didn't have much of a taste to it. He takes the cup in disappointment because he was sort of hoping for a sundae or something more
It's not really the men part that he's all that curious about, not really- unless they're mean to him, and there lies the issue. He gets hot every time any guy is an asshole to him, just like his own father was and maybe that's something he should bring up at his next therapy session. When he lies in bed, under the covers this time, it's when he thinks that his next appointment couldn't come soon enough.
"Witchcraft books-" he smiles nervously, "-she's also got some about how to talk to dead people and-"
They both know the truck honking in the distance was Bobby, even without looking. After another few short minutes of conversation, Castiel walks the teen to his uncles vehicle and says "Take care, Dean-"
Castiel fixes himself up as much as he can before leaving the club and makes sure to hit an ATM on the way home, preparing himself for tomorrows visit to the club. This was so exciting for him, it's the kind of thrill that he's never experienced before. He's was always been the play by the rules type of guy and something is telling him that this young dancer was about to change some things for him.
Dean just seems to want all his questions answered and doesn't understand the concept of boundaries. His next question has the older man almost coughing up a lung. "What?" his eyes are wide in shock after hearing his question.
with bad morning breath. Bobby sees him stumble into the kitchen, "Where you goin'?" he sips his coffee.
Christmas.
"No-" John squeezes his bulge playfully. "-I'm itchin' to get home and fuck you."
Dean shrugs, "I'm sorry I get in trouble so much. I just have all this anger inside of me." he sighs in frustration, "I don't know what to do with it. It's just there-"
you. You're growing up and somewhere in the middle of raising you on my own and working hard to provide for you, I forgot to grow along side you."
"Wish I could come." Dean says longingly, he yearns for a good mother and a family. "But you know-" he takes a few steps back, keeping his distance. "All this going on-" Jack also remembers and takes a few steps back himself.

Castiel's face is red, "It was an accident-"
John's still breathing heavily from having yelled, "You missed me?" he asks, unbuckling his belt and Castiel knows what that means. If he had to get fucked in order to keep the man from raging out further- he'd do it- it would mean tiring out John Winchester so that Dean can stay safe in his room and not undergo any wrath that would have come his way otherwise.
It was nearing the end of November, a deep chill lingering in the air. The dark haired boy shivered and carried the last box of his things upstairs to his bedroom that would belong to him until it was time to move on and leave Kansas behind.
Sam calls out, "Over here!" there she was, the dead kitty. She was a large gray cat.
"Dean, take the shake. You need it." Castiel puts three twenty dollar bills on the table before they get up- the waitress comes around with his shake in a to go cup and a straw.
Dean and Castiel keep it platonic for Bobby's sake because his lady friend was there so of course he didn't want to embarrass his dear uncle. Her name was Marcy and she was pretty damn nice, even brought over peach cobbler and a homemade apple pie. Dean liked her instantly, finding her just right for his uncle and kept smiling at how sweet they looked together.
"Oh, when Dean told me about you he kept calling you his dad."
"Can I come over tonight?" his eyes are begging so prettily. "Just to talk, I promise-"
"Feels good, yea-" he sighs.
Dean grabs the towel on the hook and begins to dry himself off, stepping out of the tub. "Don't worry Cas, it's not like my dick can hurt you." he laughs.
"Uh-I got one already-" and he can't help the pouty look Jack makes so he gives in. "I mean, I can have more than one best friend." Dean winks at his new best friend through the screen and instantly wants to cringe.
John turns around at the sound of a grown mans blubbering, "Really? You're really cryin' over my dick?" he laughs.
Castiel gets into bed next to Dean, "Maybe if I was just your-" Dean says
taken a few good whiffs of the man.
Sam shrugs, taking a seat next to him. "You get used to it-"
"Bobby! Please-" Dean cries, "You're not going to kill anybody!"
When Castiel walks into their home after work he hears the TV in the living room "Dean, I'm home-" and pauses when he sees Sam sitting on the sofa with Dean. "Hello, Sam. Haven't seen you around here in a long time." the boy smiles awkwardly, "Don't mind me-I'll be in my room. Have a goodnight." he says all too soon before leaving the boys alone.
Dean's far enough away from her that he can get away with cursing her under his breath. "What a fuckin' bitch-" he smiles, nodding in agreement to the ride. She waves him over to her small car, a mustang. "Nice car." he comments, getting in.
in his heart. Like when did
An hour passed and Dean was still awake, cock still hard under the sheets. He wasn't gonna say anything but the teenager next to him sighed so he knew he was still awake.
The eleven year old quickly scrambles to climb onto his lap, shocking the man completely because where the hell is he learning how to even do
"Shh-Dean-" he whispers, "Please-"
"Bed-" Dean clutches onto Castiel's arm for dear life- his eyes begin to water and Castiel sees it though he says nothing. Dean hates to appear weak. Once he's sitting up in bed- Castiel brings him his laptop. "Thanks-" he refuses to meet his gaze.
Dean get's excited to go get a tree but is forced to put on a jacket and some mittens before they head out in search of one, which earned Castiel a couple of nasty glares because aren't mittens for
"You're the best gay boyfriend ever-" she kisses him on the cheek. "-make sure you get change for singles, okay?" she winks before getting up to start on her rounds.
"Doesn't he ever take care of you when you're sick?" Castiel asks, setting a bowl of steaming hot soup in front of him. Dean was smart enough to let it cool down first, he'd been pretty self sufficient- or as self sufficient as an eleven year old can be.
"Well, are ya?" He asks again when he's gone.
Castiel hesitates before answering, "I haven't been myself lately. I've been feeling very tired, sluggish-I can't think straight." of course those aren't his only problems, but how can he tell a doctor that he thinks his ex lover is haunting him from beyond the grave- unless he really is losing his marbles. He can't tell the doctor that he hears voices and smells things that aren't there.
Bobby says, "What the hell are ya doin at his hour-" when he walks by the living room with a box hugged to his chest.
Apparently he's taking too long in the bathroom because Castiel comes to look for him, knocking lightly on the door before peeking inside to find him sitting on the toilet with his pants up. He walks in, closing the door behind him. "You okay baby?"
Meg stands up too, "Wait-" she follows closely behind him. "I drove four hours to get here and you're sending me away after spending only an hour and a half with me?"
At the hospital Dean is quickly put into a room, he's alone for what seems like a long time before Castiel reappears into the room with supplies. "You're gonna take my blood?"
Dean looked at the mess he made on Cas’ face, “ Holy shit. “ He chuckled, “ Where’d that come from huh. “
"I have guns boy, but I don't go around shooting anything that moves. Guns are for protection!" Instantly he feels bad, he's never seen his uncle angry at him.
Dean looks over at the tall brunette, "No-" then looks down at Robin. "You're a good friend, I won't forget that you helped me get my first job-" her eyes begin to water again so he changes the subject. "-bring me some pie and a milkshake will ya? I'm gonna go talk to the manager-" she nods and gets to work on his order before she goes to ask Bobby what he'll be having.
