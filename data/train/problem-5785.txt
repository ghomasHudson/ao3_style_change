After he made his bed and used the bathroom, Steve decided to go see Tony in his bedroom. Even though he was awake and should begin his morning routine, Steve wanted to go see his love, maybe cuddle the man until he woke up. Plus, being in his lingerie nightie, one Tony had never seen, might be an extra treat for the brunette.
say anything for a minute, his mind and body slowly coming down from their high…It was as if they were on two different plains, the subconscious and heart lazily falling back into synchronization with each other.
“Tony, I-I’m too heavy babe,” Steve said, sounding winded at the anticipation of what was to come.
Tony kept fucking Steve as the super soldier was milked dry, the man’s opening probably overly sensitive at this point. The blonde was breathing hard, his eyes shut as he swayed on Tony who was quick to grab him up in his arms, guiding him to the bed, lying beside him. He was still painfully hard, and he really wanted to lay Steve on his back and spill his release into him. But the man was spent, his breath mere whimpers; Tony could wait. He brushed his hands through the blonde’s hair comfortingly. Steve was beyond too good for him, and yet here they were, drowning each other in pure love.
But they’d stayed away from Steve. That was a godsend, he didn’t Hydra anywhere near Cap. Maybe, later, when they had more intel they could use Sitwell to get more info, to start to take them down. But for now…
Forcing a smile, Tony tried to backpedal, but bumped into Clint. “No, no, there’s no need for us all to play mistletoe, and Pep’s gonna have my head if we’re late, and…”
Ice flooded through him, and it was all he could do not to lose it. “I have to go,” he said, pushing past her, because
When Steve’s brow furrowed, he went further into it, telling Steve the whole story in detail. It was the first time he’d ever done so, he realized, and while he couldn’t exactly say he felt lighter after telling the tale, he did feel somewhat better. The tightness in his chest faded a bit, anyway. Steve was a good listener.
“You’re only fine because Thor threw a temper tantrum and shocked the hell out of all of them to get them to finally drop!”
The two men had clearly been there a while, if the way they relaxed into the armchairs were any indication. Tony didn’t recognize the first guy, but the second? Well. Nat was going to be madder than hell when she found out she’d let Tony into a room without sweeping it first, because there was Senator Stern, a smug smile on his stupid face, and Tony was about to correct that, immediately.
Oh yeah, and there were guys standing over him with guns.
He kept it up until his throat got hoarse, but he did succeed in getting two new guards to venture in.
Okay, the answer was familiar enough, but the lack of condescending comments on Tony’s life choices was not. “Any reason you aren’t telling me off for going to the workshop at….” he checked his watch, “four-thirty in the morning?”
Nodding, Steve took a deep breath. “When Loki and I fought after he took the Tesseract…well. You know how that ended.”
“You’re a menace,” Steve said fondly, handing him a napkin.
” Scurrying to her phone, Darcy snatched it up and aimed it at Tony. “Okay, say that again. Come on! No one will believe you’ve seen
“Five hundred feet!”
“Deal!” Keeping hold of Natasha, Clint grabbed Thor as well. “Be back in a flash! Come on, Thor, we’ll show you around.”
“I will, Tony. I promise,” Steve said, eyes blazing. Tony stared back into them, drawn in completely. Had Steve’s eyes always been so endlessly blue? How had he never noticed that before? And damn, Steve had insanely long lashes. He could be on the cover of a magazine. Actually, he’d easily outshine any other model they put on there, he was
And no one else had approached Cap about it, thank fuck.
“Right. Of course,” Steve said, and followed Tony out of the garage and up the stairs, eerily quiet.
“Because I don’t like seeing you hurt!” Tony shouted, anger and humiliation flooding through him at the outburst. “Dammit, Steve, you…”
Tightening his arm around Steve’s chest, Tony took a shaky breath. “How ya doin, Cap?”
Feeling like he was prying his eyes open with a crowbar, Tony blinked, to see Steve staring down at him, relief all over his face. Tony was in the armor, and the faceplate was off, and…huh. That was way too familiar. Did he fall through a portal again?
“Ahhhhh, yeah. Yup. Mm hmm. Just fine.”
“C’mon, Kit, you’ve got this….YES!” he shouted as Kit grabbed Alex’s ankle. It wasn’t perfect, but fuck it, it was good enough.
Besides. He’d gotten
, Tony thought, cursing his mouth and wishing he could take it back. Fucking hell, how pathetic was he? Steve didn’t need him, he’d proven that on the helicarrier, and in the workshop earlier, but…but Tony just couldn’t let the guy think he was totally alone.
Tony debated his approach for about .5 seconds. “I wanna know what’s next,” he said.
“It was
“Can’t believe what?” Tony prompted when Steve didn’t say anything further.
“Couldn’t sleep. Keep thinking about how I should have stopped Loki. So I got up, thinking I could at least be useful. I thought about going for a run to help clear my head, but…” he shook his head, glancing out the windows to the city that sprawled below. “Things are a bit of a mess right now. Didn’t think I’d get far.”
“You’d be surprised at the alien invasions Earth can handle,” Fury muttered, looking at Goose.
That surprised him enough that his symptoms dulled, and he stared at Bruce while the doctor crouched in front of him. “Me?”
Knowing it always looked better if he appeared with a date to those sorts of things, Tony sweet-talked (bribed) Natasha into going with him, as she was the only Avenger who was any good at social events — other than Steve, who had been firmly told by Bruce he had to stay home. So Tony was a little sad as he headed to his floor to get dressed, despite the cheery, twinkling lights everywhere, because he really wanted to go with Steve.
Again, not that surprising. The cell phone companies were probably going kablooey with everyone calling to check on their loved ones or to talk about how the fact that aliens were a thing now. Or to upload videos of Avengers kicking said alien ass. That was probably why. Had to be.
“What are you gonna do? You’re zip tied to a bed.”
“Okay, now that
“Friends!” Thor boomed, sauntering in, swinging Mjolnir. “You have already gathered! Splendid! Our Captain would like to speak with us, and you have made it so convenient to convene.”
they’d had because of the scepter, he hadn’t done anything to be untrustworthy, had he?
“I thought we were going back to Malibu. We weren’t supposed to stay after the clean energy launch,” she said, eyes tight, face drawn. “We’ve stuck around to get cleanup started, but I thought that was just temporary. We were going to go home, Tony.”
react to that?
Busted, Steve ducked his head sheepishly for a moment, before lifting it back up and shrugging. “No, I don’t.”
“There was a file. We were given a file on all of you, weeks ago,” Clint said, not looking at anyone. “Barnes must have been mentioned in Steve’s, I must have told Loki about him when he questioned me on all of you. I’m sorry, Cap.”
But he managed to get with the Clarksons and start smoothing ruffled feathers. Unfortunately for Natasha, that meant eventually leaving her behind, while he took the couple to the library, to go over their concerns and try to charm them into not worrying. He was pretty sure she’d taken up watch outside the damn door, but pushed it aside while he chatted with the Clarksons, and ended up convincing them to keep the merger on track.
“Nat, I’m so sorry, but I need Tony for a minute. The Clarksons are here and making noise about cancelling the merger, I need Tony to talk them out of it, for some reason they like it when he babbles and charms them endlessly….”
“No, it wasn’t.”
, he had everybody on his side down. As fast as he could, he went to Thor, and after another twenty minutes, between his repulsers and another round of Thor’s lightning, The Wrecking  Crew and their minions were down for good.
Steve’s shoulders hunched. “Pretty much.”
“Good luck with
“Steve…”
That broke through Tony’s haze of hate. Rhodey? Rhodey was there?
A strong hand gripped onto his shoulder as Steve got to his feet next to him. “Put on the suit,” Steve said, face pale and sweat dripping on his brow. But his voice was strong, and he urged Tony to the suitcase suit under his seat.
Blinking, Tony ran a hand over his face and replayed the conversation as the elevator swept to the penthouse. “J, am I hallucinating, or did he just compliment me?”
“Yeah. That going okay?”
The nightmare wasn’t surprising.
“Is it Steve?” he asked, heartbeat pounding. Only a few people knew his secure line, it had to be Steve, finally checking in, saying they were safe.
time?” Why was he always pissing people off so they wanted to kill him? Obie, Vanko, Loki, and now this Wrecking Crew? “And who gets mad at Point Break? I thought everybody loved him.”
“Patch Steve through, J,” Tony said, and then his screen blinked again and Steve was there.
“Came for you, actually.” Steve lifted a white bag in his hand and Tony instantly started to drool, stomach rumbling loudly. “JARVIS mentioned you had back to back meetings today, and I know you were up early discussing bi-frost physics with Bruce and Jane this morning and didn’t eat. Thought you might appreciate lunch.”
After a bit, Clint strode over to Tony with a bright orange drink, and plopped down next to him. Sprawling his legs out, he kicked Tony’s foot with the side of his boot, and then whacked him on the arm.
“Sir, you’re at one thousand feet!”
“We could use a little help, Tony,” Steve said, and his voice sounded strained enough that Tony put more oomph into the thrusters and bulleted down. Zooming through, Tony burst into the parking garage and felt like he was in a scene from Star Wars.
“Do you have
, not to a damn bed frame. Maybe there was a guard around that he could piss off or bribe. It hadn’t worked earlier, but if at first you don’t succeed…
“—because you’re too polite to point out that….what?”
“I’m not entirely sure. The plane had a bomb. Well, a few bombs, which is interesting as everyone led me to believe that was an impossibility these days,” Steve said.
“Well, yeah, but…Loki’s still out there, Pep. We gotta find him. I can’t let him attack us again. I won’t.” Had she really thought he would sit this out? Loki could come back any second. Like hell he wouldn’t be there if the bastard did. “The Avengers need to be ready for him.”
“And I shouldn’t ask that of you, Tony. It isn’t right. So…so I think it might be best if I went back to Malibu,” she said quietly. “I’ve got our company to run.”
Steve sighed again, but didn’t push it.
“Don’t tell me to calm down, you asshole, you’re hurt!”
“But you love me,” Tony said. His mouth was full of food, so it came out garbled.
“This has to end,” Tony whispered furiously.
She nodded. “Will you let me closer to help?”
“Goodbye, Tony.”
“We have to tell the team,” Tony said immediately. Maybe it was naive, but they’d saved the world together, came together to fight off an alien invasion. He had to believe someone that could do that wouldn’t be part of Hydra. He had to. “And then keep ourselves separate from Shield. Have you give that Hydra guy a reason the two of you can’t be around each other. You’re infiltrating the Avengers, or something. Gotta be top secret. That’s step one.”
“Well, when we get home and you’re all healed up we’ll go flying more often,” Tony said, then cleared his throat because far too many emotions were about to break through. Steve liked flying with him? No one liked flying with him. Pepper hated it, still gave him glares when he mentioned how he’d flew her to safety after the Vanko disaster. And Rhodey would also insist he liked having his own suit, he didn’t need to be carted around by Tony. “But we’re going to have a proper take off and landing, none of this jump crap, not unless we’re on a mission and I have plenty of time to make it to you in time, or there’s no choice, okay? You and Clint, I swear, you’ll be the death of me. But I will catch you, if you fall. You know that, yeah? Of course you do, that’s why you leapt out of the freaking plane. But I gotta agree, flying is something else. Maybe I’ll make a special grip on the suit’s shoulders so you’ll have somewhere to hold on. Or something. I’ll figure it out. And then we’ll be all set. We’ll go flying anytime you want, Cap. Alright?”
He started pulling up, mindful of his passengers, and out of the dive because the ground was
Well, one-night stand. And actually, that was
“Hell yeah, you do,” Rhodey agreed, pulling Tony close. “Now, come on. You need sleep, and as your family, you’re gonna let me pass out in the really nice guest room and take advantage of all your food and enormous guest bed.”
Flicking her eyes to Coulson’s photo, Natasha kept her face in that carefully neutral expression that Tony really hated. He preferred the woman who kicked his ass in Tetris and ate peanut butter sandwiches than the spy who kept everyone out of reach.
Quickly covering the family jewels, Tony swatted Clint’s foot. “Watch the goods, bird-brain, or you’ll be out on the streets before you know it.”
For now he wanted to keep them far away.
“It appears they’re rather upset that you are hoarding all the Chitauri weapons, and not sharing. So they want you to give them a ton of money, and then drop dead. I’m not sure why they hate Thor. Probably hair envy.”
“I don’t understand,” Bruce, the only still on the couch, said. Tony stared at him helplessly, wondering how their fun afternoon of napping and watching movies had soured so quickly.
Nat pulled back, green eyes full of mischief. “Not bad, Stark.”
“Steve!” Tony said, trying to get the soldier’s attention. “No napping yet, wait til Bruce gets here and can tell you if it’s safe or not, okay? Closing your eyes now is a bad idea.” Not knowing what the hell to do, Tony ran his fingers over Steve’s ribs, hoping for some sort of reaction to his pathetic attempt at tickling. But it was no good — Steve’s eyes slid shut and he didn’t open them back up. “Steve?” he asked, voice breaking. Oh, God, had he caused internal damage when he’d fired? Had he only made everything worse? “Steve. Cap. Hey. Wake up.
Oh, Tony. What have you done?
“Point taken, Legolas, I will drag my ass up from now on. Alright?”
. Completely at home. Pulse picking up wildly, Tony snapped his eyes back to Nat, hoping he didn’t look too much like a besotted idiot.
He continued for quite a while, somehow managing to keep his lips from curving or laughing out loud as Steve watched him with a huge grin on his own face, and kept the lecture going until Clint returned with Bruce, who immediately kicked Tony out, ordering him to get sleep.
Maaaaaaaaybe.
Cap, and I want some strong evidence about Hydra to bring to the team when they get back with the pizza. You’re still in their servers. Find their secrets.”
“That’s a bit harsh, Stark,” Thor said quietly. “And inaccurate.”
Letting go of his chin, Natasha sighed. “That kiss didn’t seem like disinterest to me. You should talk to him when we get back.”
“No, no, it’s okay. It’s not that.” The pained expression appeared back on his face, and Tony felt the urge to reach out and run a hand down Cap’s back. “I lost Bucky in the snow. When he fell from the train…there was cold. And snow.”
He woke choking, ripped out of sleep by terror and flashes of light exploding across his vision. For a moment, his body quivered and heaved, trying to draw in air and unable to. Sweat matted his hair and his brow, trickling down his back, while he closed his eyes and tried to get rid of the vision. Tried to get his lungs to work properly.
Pouting, Darcy folded his arms. “You’re a grouch today, Stark.”
Seeing the flashing lights ahead, Tony slowed and prepared to land. “So, what? They got a bunch of illegal alien weapons, took over a building, and are threatening to bomb it—and half the block around it — if I don’t give them my money, more alien weapons, and surrender myself  and Thor to them?”
Tony went cold. Maybe his teammates had no clue, no idea what that statement meant. But Tony did. He took in the devastated look in Spangles’ eyes, in the small hunch of his shoulders, and felt the heart he wasn’t supposed to have break for the guy, his dad’s words from a million years ago ringing through his head.
“Hi,” Tony said softly, as Steve’s eyes searched the room and landed on him. The hand he’d held non-stop since they got back to the Tower squeezed his tightly, and Tony was seriously tempted to fall to the floor in a hysterical sobbing mess. But instead of letting his desire to get a little weepy take over, Tony squeezed Steve’s hand right back. “Nice to see you awake, there, Cap. You doing okay? You alright? Ah! A little nod yes. Good, that’s good.  You’re up and not looking too confused, that’s a great sign, Bruce will be pleased. And you aren’t able to go anywhere, which is even better, because you have to listen to everything I’ve got to say. Don’t ya, Cap? So let’s start off on all the reasons I am tattling on you to Bruce and Natasha. First off, you leapt out of a plane without a parachute. Second,
“You mean…you mean metaphorically, because he betrayed you?” Steve asked quietly. But then his eyes dropped to the arc reactor shining in Tony’s chest, and he blanched, looking horrified. “Or…or do you mean…”
Natasha waited until they were in the limo and stuck in traffic before saying, “So. That was interesting.”
“Well….” Steve hesitated, then smiled. “Alright. I’m in.”
“His…who?” Steve asked, blinking.
“Come on, Tony.” Nat was at his side somehow, sliding her arms into his. “Let’s go greet your adoring public.”
How could he have done it? How could he have been so stupid as to go and fall for Steve? Was he trying to make himself the most miserable person on the planet? It was one thing to have feelings for his CEO, or a reporter, or even a teammate, but….Steve? His brain had to go and pick Steve?
Okay, I lied, a little bit more of two idiots in love before things start ramping up ;)
trust Fury, that’s the whole problem. If he’s pulling this on us, and not looping her in, it’s hurting her because she doesn’t know why. And Phil…”
At Steve’s little huff of laughter, Tony felt a small surge of triumph. It was a tiny laugh, not even a laugh, really, but it was better than the sad, ancient look in his eyes.
“I read your file, read Coulson’s and Nat’s reports. What you let Fury keep in them, anyway,” Steve said with a wry smile. “I read between the lines. Drew enough information to know that you weren’t the only Stark he gaslit, Tony.”
And then somehow found himself relaxing on the couch with his teammates, he realized, as Thor plopped on the floor in front of them, and stretched his legs out. Damned if he wasn’t quite sure how that had happened.
“They’re in an abandoned building that’s on its last leg. They have the stolen Chitauri weapons and an assortment of others. One guy seems to have a special crowbar. Another has a demolition ball on a chain. They’re calling themselves the Wrecking Crew,” Hill informed him as Tony flew her direction. Without Clint and Natasha (who were out on a mission for Fury and to see what they could find about Hydra — what it was and what they were learning, Tony wasn’t sure he wanted to know), there was no need for a jet, so Tony was currently giving Steve a piggy-back ride while he zoomed over the city. Steve clung tightly to his back, laughing when Tony swooped low to show off.
Not that the god could technically be considered people. Bulging biceps and flowing blond locks aside, the guy just radiated otherworldly power, along with a hint of ozone, and…Pop Tarts? Tony still had to wrap his head around that one. Where the hell the Norse god of lightning found Pop Tarts to snack on during an alien invasion and battle was beyond him. But he had to admit, the sugar filled treat didn’t sound too bad right now.
. And if Hydra makes a play, Fury’d know he’d have one team on his side, without a doubt. Coulson would have his back.”
It was the wince at the end of Steve’s question that made the world snap into clarity. “You’re hurt.”
“You sure? Natasha said we needed to have an immediate team meeting, but I can cover for you if you need a minute.”
This time, Steve didn’t bother hiding the grin. “You know what? I think I am. Your music is atrocious, Tony.”
“Uh, no, you lost those privileges. Besides, I’m prettier than you, Steve would rather look at me.”
And they didn’t stay down long. In moments the three of them were back on their feet, charging Thor again.
“Sir!”
Oh, right, he was supposed to be taking a break. Noticing that Anne Marie was standing up in the conference room he’d just left, and remembering he’d just lied to her and said he had Avengers business, Tony made a beeline for the elevator. “Right, yeah, we can head to my office and you can fill me in on anything new you’ve learned.”
“Of course,” Thor said brightly, though it sounded funny. Like he was trying too hard to sound cheerful. He exchanged a glance with Steve, who stayed silent, and walked back to his own stool, face dark. Tony tried to keep his nostrils from flaring, and bit his lip. Great. He had somehow managed to ruin the tentative peace he and Steve had found after the crap on the hellicarrier bridge. Fantastic.
“Just until the delivery guy gets here with a better one,” muttered Tony. He tried to shovel his eggs down faster, but he was startled by Bruce’s hand covering his.
“Oh no. No, I let that bullshit pass on Halloween and I am
“No, Tony. It means ok. If our maybes ever become yeses, I can raise our children the way you talked about. Without resentment. It may not be my first choice, but it’s worth it if it means any child of mine gets to have you as a father.”
and of course, the greatest sci-fi epic ever made,
“Why? You were right,” said Steve.
“Oh, let’s not get hung up on that, I’ve still got to show you our mini particle accelerator!” said Hammer with a fifty watt smile, although his hands were still shaking slightly.
“Yeah, I can do it,” said Tony, because at the end of the day they may not be dating, but he really would do anything for this woman.
Tony groaned and buried his face in the pillow.
“I’m sorry sir, Mr. Stark is engrossed in a project and has requested not to be disturbed.”
“I did not collapse.” Rude. How could Thor even suggest such a thing?
“Tony!” The last few weeks Steve had been slowly losing his Oscar the Grouch look, and now looked more and more like a Labrador retriever. Hydra and all he had lost still weighed heavily on him, but with Thor and Darcy around, it was hard not to look on the bright side. As he walked down the hallway, eyes lighting up, Tony couldn’t help but return the grin Steve sent him, smiling brightly.
without video footage. And the oil on your shirt and face and the terrible hair will finally prove what I’ve been saying this whole time!”
Tony though wryly, whirling around to find Fury scowling at him. “My, my, Nicky. You look might annoyed to see the guy that’s here to solve your hellicarrier problems.”
Five heads popped back out, some cheering, some cursing.
Wondering if he should ignore his fatigue and go back to the Mark 11 right away, or take the rest of the night off, Tony stood, stretched, then blinked when JARVIS said, “Sir?”
“Hey, hey, hey.” Sitting his scotch down, Tony hurried over and plopped on the couch as Steve’s voice broke and he buried his face in his hands. At a loss at what to do, Tony patted his shoulder pathetically, and said, “You still saved thousands that day, Steve. Your sacrifice saved so many people, even if some Hydra assholes managed to survive. And if they did, we’ll ferret them out. We’ll take them down for real.”
“JARVIS is helping track down Pepper. Clint and Thor are with Rhodes,” Nat said. “Killian got the Iron Patriot armor from him before we got here. Rhodey thinks he’s after the President.”
When he yanked his arm free, the glowing ripple occurred again, and the man’s hand lit up with flames. Quirking an eyebrow at Tony, he spread his palm wide, and the flames went out.
I really do not know much about the Wrecking Crew other than what I was able to Google, so please excuse me for any inaccuracies! I just they would be a fun group to grab the weapons and start causing mayhem ;)
Awkward silence stretched between them, but damned if Tony was going to be the one to back down. He’d dealt with awkward silences all his life — from the ones his father had caused by being too distracted and ignoring him, to the ones Obie would create in board meetings, in a power move to make the board toe the line. So he kept his arms crossed and his head tilted until Steve finally caved.
“Sir? I’ve found something in SHIELD’s servers. I believe it’s something you might want to see.”
Collapsing into bed, Tony flipped JARVIS off. “You’re a snarky bastard too. Why is that so appealing to me?”
“Not my finest hour, then,” Tony said, cringing. He’d been an asshole in the past, he knew that. Was it ever going to stop coming back to haunt him? “What, he wants to meet with you to whine about it or something?”
Tony flipped the face plate up. “So what are you? Helmet man, or something?”
“Hmm. Well try not to make a mess this time. Clean up takes forever, you know. We’re still working tirelessly on the Battle of New York.”
Tony had been toying with Steve, tracing his tongue over the planes in his back, and nipping at the flesh of the super soldier’s soft inner thighs. But he didn’t seem to respond the way the brunette was hoping.
The super soldier bit his lip when he felt the pad of Tony’s fingertip trace around his entrance, massaging the ring of muscle there. He felt a strong resistance when Tony attempted to push his finger into him, his opening tight and burning already.
“Tony,” Steve moaned his name, deep and throaty.
“Sorry,” Steve apologized in more of a whimper. He didn’t mean to do that to the man and make him choke. Tony merely hummed around him in response, the vibration resonating through Steve like that of a cello string. “Ah!” Steve groaned, his brows knitting up as the coil in his belly neared its breaking point. He felt Tony’s fingernails dig into the flesh where Steve’s lower back met his bum, the sweet bite of pain enhancing all that Tony was doing to him. His boyfriend was bobbing up and down on his length, his movements becoming faster and faster while pressing his fingers deeper into his back.
After Tony apologizes, he and Steve go on an unexpected trip.
“Thanks, Brayan,” Steve replied as he tried to calm down his racing heart. It shouldn’t have mattered that much to him, but it did. Time seemed to slow, the background chaos and noise sounding so distant as the two men stayed laying on the ground, Tony still hovering over Steve.
Regulating his breathing, Steve quickly stripped out of his top, finding a white t-shirt to throw on. His heart was anxious, and he knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep for a while. So, quietly, Steve padded out of the room, down the stairs and out to the wrap around porch. He didn’t bother with finding a porch swing or a rocking chair to sit on. Steve simply took a seat on the steps, his elbows resting on his knees as he looked upward towards the sky. It was a cloudless night, and the stars were in abundance, much more than New York City. He had always found solace when he looked at the stars, a comfort settling within them then. The breeze was cold and crisp, the perfect combination for autumn. It presented an invigorating chill, pleasantly giving Steve goosebumps.
Steve peered at him from over his shoulder, arms crossed under his chin. “Please, Tony,” Steve breathed out, arching back and into Tony’s hands, relishing in the brunette’s ass play.
“But, Steve’s a guy.”
It took Tony a second to realize what Steve was getting at before a salacious grin spread across his face. There was something about Steve, sweet, innocent looking Steve having such lovely kinks behind closed doors that made Tony’s heart swell…among other things, and he gave his blonde boyfriend a pat on his plush bum before hopping of the bed.
I got a girl crush, hate to admit it but
“Stark,” Fury said, his voice flowing through the room.
The article expressed a scientific reasoning of soulmates, that the energy that had been said to exist between soulmates through history could in fact be real:
“Wish I looked like that,” Tony said aloud, putting it back in the bag. He’d bring it to Steve in the morning. Hopefully the super soldier wouldn’t run away from him then. How Steve acted earlier truly caught Tony and Bruce off guard. Tony tried to ignore the disappointment he felt too when the blonde hurried away from him, barely looking the genius in the eye.
“Come on in,” she said, turning and heading inside. Tony removed himself from the suit, letting it stay out on the balcony. “I’m actually glad you stopped,” Pepper started, tossing her hair over a shoulder while she rummaged through a briefcase. “I have the business arrangement from the Japanese affiliates for you to look over.” She handed the file to Tony before heading to her kitchen to brew them both some coffee.
“I don’t care, want to feel you open me with your cock, Tony.” And before Tony could say anything else, Steve lowered himself onto Tony’s erection, biting his lip as the man’s fullness slowly started to open his body. Tony watched him, his fingers digging almost painfully into Steve’s hips as the man’s warmth surrounded him. Steve was fucking gorgeous, his mouth open, panting as the head of Tony’s penis finally slipped past the ring of muscle of Steve’s entrance.
"Steve," Natasha cooed, her pale hand resting on his shoulder. "You're alright. You're okay here." Steve looked at her with big eyes, brows furrowed with confusion and reflection. They'd must have thought he'd had a memory of the war. Sam also told him he was back on U.S. soil and with friends. Steve didn’t correct them, and he was truly grateful for their kindness and support. But he didn’t want to tell them about the vision of these past people, and his emotional connection to them. Soulmates and all its new proof still was a skeptical ideal to many folks. Steve didn’t feel the need to really tell anyone. It all didn’t mean anything anyway.
Steve could taste the minty toothpaste the man had just used, the blonde’s tongue slipping inside his warm mouth. Tony made a sweet noise of pleasure, pushing his hips down and in against Steve’s who gasped against his boyfriend’s mouth at the heavy bout of friction. Steve held Tony tighter, grasping for purchase as Tony rutted his hardened length against Steve’s. He was erect for the second time that day, the head of his cock swelling, a bit of white liquid bubbling at the top.
Tony laid against the man’s back for a moment, breathing deep and inhaling the scent of a spent Steve.
“Night, Steve,” Tony whispered.
He was content being alone tonight until he saw a shadow approach. Even with his heightened hearing, Steve never heard when Natasha entered a room. The red head sauntered up to the couch only to slide his sketching supplies over and take a seat next to him.
“Steve, baby, you gotta-” Tony said between gritted teeth before he lost every bit of self-control that was in him. Steve swallowed with Tony’s tumescent cock in his mouth, simultaneously caressing the genius’s testicles, rolling them in his hand. The blonde even stuck two fingers against Tony’s perineum, rubbing at the prostate from the outside.
"Steve," Tony breathed, sounding astounded. Steve sat up again and locked his azure gaze with Tony's.
After Steve’s novice strip tease, the genius could finally see the glimpse of the lingerie cloth. And when Steve’s sweats fell to his ankles, Tony nearly dropped his wine glass at the sight of his beloved in his pure, intimate garments. The shimmering panties were of the same navy color, with a chiffon overlay on top, giving the lingerie an almost iridescent sheen.
“I wouldn’t say that, darling,” Pepper said softly, eyes looking a bit distant. “There’s someone. And he’s been a part of your life much longer than I have.” Tony stumbled a bit in their dance when she said that.
“Mmm, keep kissing me like that and I won’t be able to speak,” Tony breathed, his brown eyes glistening from the mellow lights that surrounded them. “I did this because I’ve missed you, silly,” the brunette finally answered, grabbing the chilled wine and popping the cork before pouring each of them full glasses of sweet wine. Before handing Steve his glass though, the genius paused.
Steve eventually came out of his daze, looking around disoriented. He checked his watch, shocked that it was almost midnight. He looked at his notebook to find it partly filled with his writing, about Étienne and Antoine. The super soldier was internally freaking out, extremely worried about these visions that keep getting stronger. He pushed the notebook away as if it was a deadly substance.
“Of course,” Steve assured him, sitting on the couch and unfolding the blanket. “It was nice getting out of the city and do something entirely new,” he said with a smile. Tony smiled too, looking down at his hands. Steve saw the glow of the arc reactor through his shirt, gently lighting his face in a soft, pale blue glow. “But you know what made it really great?” He added.
He pulled away though, even when Steve sought after his lips, wanting more. “Let me see the rest of your present,” Tony encouraged, catching his breath then. “You in those sweatpants aren’t doing me any good,” he teased, grinning wildly at the super soldier.
“Tired,” Steve admitted. “But okay.”
“It wasn’t a game, Tony.”
And with that, she turned and walked to the elevator. Frozen, Tony only watched while she got in and walked out of his life. Then he sat on the couch, and stayed there for a long time.
With a small sound that was half-laugh, half-sob, she stepped away.
“So we find out the situation. Maybe Fury hid him because of Hydra. I don’t care if they are so good at hiding we’ve barely found anything or not. The guy’s the top spy in the world. He’s had to have noticed they’re around, if he’s not part of them,” Tony said.
More angst and the plot thickens ahead.....
Panting, wiping his nose because the bastard had managed to get a hit in, Tony lifted the gun and pointed it back at the first guy. Clutching his arm to his chest, he whimpered and said, “You know what? Go ahead and walk out the door. I don’t even care. They are so weird here.”
? Of all people?”
A holo-screen screen shimmered to life nearby and Tony read two lines before cursing so loud all movement in the room stopped.
“Tony, wake up. Please?”
He wasn’t surprised to be getting a call. Anne Marie had contacted him the day before — one of the
“Hey.
Snorting, Tony poured his precious coffee into two mugs and strolled over, offering one to Steve. “A bit of a mess is an understatement, Cap. But I know what you mean. I can’t sleep, either.”
“Mmmrph?” Tony mumbled around a yawn. “Time izzit?”
Wheezing, Tony watched the flashes of the nuke destroy the Chitauri ship, grateful that he had at least succeeded in that. The army that Earth couldn’t handle was at least destroyed. For now, they would be safe. For now, they would be protected. But he needed to make sure he was prepared for the next attack, needed to make sure there was a way to defend the Earth next time, and he could, he would do it, if only he could breathe…
“J-JARVIS?” he stammered, pressing a hand to the reactor. Fuck, shit, his chest was tight. It wasn’t the reactor glitching again, it was fine, but just in case… “Check the heart, check the…is it my brain?”
injuries. The ankle should heal quickly, thank goodness. And it should be okay for him to sleep with the concussion, but keep an eye on him, okay? He’s had too many concussions since Loki. It worries me.”
“It’s…tricky.”
it was Steve, he thought, and groaned, pressing the cool glass to his forehead. How could it
“S’okay,” Steve said again and Tony hiccuped and wiped at his face.
Thank God the partition was up. Tony sighed, unbuttoning his top collar button and loosening his tie a little. “What I had to, Nat.”
, it’ll hurt like hell even at a low setting, Steve, and a stun won’t cut it, are you out of your goddamned …”
“Tony?”
The jury was still out on Fury himself. Tony had a few ideas, each one as plausible as the next, but kept them to himself for the time being.
“Tony. Are you ever going to come join the team’s discussions?”
“I don’t feel like it’s something I should be applauded for, Cap. I should have realized what Obie was up to long before I did. I should have ended the weapons manufacturing long before I did.”
“And I will. As soon as…”
“Pepper. Pep, I can’t quit. Not while Loki’s free. I have to protect the Earth, I have to do everything I can…”
Maria filled Steve in while Tony tilted his head, doing his own scan. There was four of them total, spread throughout the building. Really, it should be a piece of cake. He’d let Thor take the ones on the top floor, give Steve free reign to get the guy on the lower floor, and smash his way through a window in the middle and take last guy.
“Yeah,” Tony said softly back, because, you know what? The Mark II and III did deserve some recognition. They had saved him in more ways than one, especially the Mark III. It had fixed the ice problem and saved his ass from Obie. “Although technically the first is in pieces in a desert in Afghanistan.”
The guy on the left snorted. “I think we’re good.”
“Stark.” Thor’s hand landed on his shoulder again, gently. Really gently. Surprised, Tony looked up and blinked at him. What the hell, were they going to act like he was made of glass, now? Fuck. He knew he shouldn’t show anyone new the reactor. It always happened like this, everyone always freaked out at first.
“You’re traitors all of you,” Tony pouted.
Maya had taken him back to the east coast?
“I know, because you’re a very polite person.”
But for posterity’s sake, he grumbled. “Get you…Jesus, I already gave you a place to stay rent-free, Barton, now I gotta feed your ass all the time? Wait, haven’t I already been feeding your ass this whole time? You know what, fine. Let’s get some pizza, because now I’m hungry. But you go pick it up for me, I don’t feel like going out.”
Other than be a former weapons dealer, and Merchant of Death, that is. Ugh. No wonder Cap was deliberating. Tony would have second-guessed himself, too.
“Whatever you’re thinking, don’t,” Nat warned.
“Shit,” Tony uttered, managing to avoid being flattened by the left wing. But it clipped him, hard, in the right shoulder, sending him spiraling and smacking into another chunk of the plane, this time sending pain screaming up his leg.
Sleep was overrated anyway.
“Right.” Tony unlocked the briefcase as the plane jerked and dropped again, getting it into position as the flight attendants started to shout. He jerked his head up as the suit folded around him, watching with terror in his throat as Steve bounded away from Tony and toward the sound of people needing help.
“No, you won’t. JARVIS likes me. He won’t let you.”
“I don’t know. Clint and I had that close call, but we were able to lie low and shake them off. Neither of us thought we had been made — Clint was nearly certain of it. And the equipment we left behind was in the same spot, untouched. Completely fried though, like…like it’d been hit by Thor’s lightning or something. So we don’t even have our footage to check. For whatever reason, they’re gone. There was nothing left for us to search through and lead to their next base.”
“What?”
“You don’t…oh come on, Natasha, you don’t really think…”
Sometimes.
Five bodies fell to their deaths below him. Alright, that was fine — he’d make it work. Engaging the thrusters, he got to Heather first, and adjusted his descent enough so that she could grab on as wrapped her in his arms, scanning for the next closest body. “Heather?”
So Tony kept close to Natasha, danced and laughed with her, and as the night wore on, he had to admit that it hadn’t been nearly as awful as he’d thought it would be. By the time they made their way back to Pepper (and
“Any good news on Cap?”
Three hours later, after staring at the ceiling and getting absolutely nowhere counting sheep, Tony untangled himself from Pepper and got up. Four am was close enough to being a decent time to start the day — he’d only be rising just a bit earlier than normal. Not a big deal at all. Swiftly pulling his shirt back on, (pressing his lips together to quiet any groans he might let out as his body protested), he cast one glance back at Pepper, and sighed. Her strawberry hair splayed over the pillow, and he wanted nothing more than to crawl back in with her and pass out.
Steve nodded, smiling shyly. Wishing for things he knew he could never get, Tony shifted, nudging Steve until they sat shoulder to shoulder. Then he ordered JARVIS to put on Star Wars, and relaxed, safe in the knowledge that he was with Steve, that Steve was next to him, and DUM-E and JARVIS were there to watch over them both.
Oh goody. This looked like it was gonna be a fun conversation.
“Yeah, you know what? I think I am,” he said, looking over to Bruce and Jane as they got into an argument over the bi-frost, Natasha shaking her head at Darcy and Thor next to them. If only Steve and Clint would check in, things would be right as rain. Pressing down the anxiety that crawled back up his back, he returned his attention to his phone. “So what can I do for you, Pepper-pot? Pretty sure I didn’t miss a meeting. J’s been strict, lately.”
Trying to shrug off Thor’s hand, Tony snapped, “It’s
Until he heard an all-too familiar voice.
“I can’t go through that again, Tony, you don’t understand….”
“Sure,” Tony said, feeling something twist between them that he couldn’t name. Kinship, sure, and camaraderie. But there was something else, that pulsed and beat between them, that had a dopey smile appearing on Tony’s face. “See you soon, then, Cap.”
“You’re gonna join DUM-E at the Community College,” Tony mumbled.
“It appears a group of the Wrecking Crew’s friends has surged out of a basement entrance, sir. Captain Rogers and Mr. Odinson are engaging them in the building’s parking garage.”
“They seem to want your and Thor’s heads on a platter, actually,” Hill said, and Tony let out an enormous sigh.
“I managed not to throw him through the wall. To be honest, I kinda froze up, just like I did when Loki mentioned Bucky. I think I nodded and got out of there as fast as I could. It just…it brought back too many memories. I went into the ice to stop Hydra, and now someone is wandering around Shield using their code phrase? Thinking I would say it back?” His hands clenched tighter. “I gave up
Steve groaned at the feeling, instantly pushing back against the other man’s digit, wanting to be penetrated by his love. The blonde could feel the brunette’s finger massage at the sensitive skin of his opening, the muscle quivering with sensation as Tony worked at the area in a circular motion.
Steve remembered his mother, with her arms wrapped around his delicate frame as they watched the stars glimmering in the sky. He remembered her tired eyes from double shifts at the hospital, her light hair braided over a shoulder. Still, she stayed up with him those nights till his asthma subsided or his fever broke, and he was able to sleep once more.
“Steve,” Tony said, taking a few steps forward, only for the blonde to raise a hand, shushing the brunette and stilling him.
His flagrant problem underneath his pajama pants wasn’t going away anytime soon though. So, Steve waddled to his bathroom then, standing before the toilet and lowering his pants. Taking hold of his erection, Steve closed his eyes and bit his lip, stroking himself fervently and trying to get it over as quickly as possible so that he didn’t indulge in his fantasies. He tried desperately to not think about the way Tony’s rough hands felt on his body in his dream, or the way the brunette kissed him, causing Steve to elicit sweet and sultry moans…
“Hiya,” Steve replied quietly, smiling too.
Taking a breath, Steve went to the bed, hesitating there. He looked at Tony, sound asleep, his chest rising and falling gently. And how the moonlight washed over him, Steve had felt a sense of awe and wonderment.
“Touch yourself for me?” Tony asked, head falling against the back of the couch, eyes half-lidded as he watched the blonde bobbing up and down on his length.
and Thank You to all you lovely readers! <3
“It’s for the best,” Tony said, cutting Steve off and scratching at his beard. “She deserves to be happy. I should be thankful she stuck it out with me this long.” Tony added, looking down at his hands. “I thought she was the one, though,” he whispered, his voice filled with sorrow.
Steve didn’t make a sound, save for a sharp intake of breath or a languid sigh when Tony placed a kiss to his hip bone. How he’d been so blessed to be Tony’s was beyond comprehension in Steve’s mind. The genius had women, and men throw themselves at him every time he made an appearance. Tony always played it up, lowering his sunglasses and giving the crowd a flirtatious wink.
“The guy is from the 40’s. I mean, I’m not saying he’s a prude or anything. But I’d be shocked if he was gay or bi,” Tony said, as if it was common sense.
"And hear I thought you were merely a thermo-astro-"
“Maybe if you were paying attention to Jerry instead of being on your phone, you’d know,” Steve said, walking along the creek bed toward Tony. Steve showed him then, handing the furnished pole back to the genius before walking back over to his own spot.
“Tony, I’m
“I know, it hurts, just get settled and-” Tony started, only for Steve to cut him off.
Leaning an arm against the clear glass windows, Tony looked across the multitude of skyscrapers that besieged the city. He felt so lost, his heart pinching when he thought about Steve cuddling close to him back at that Bed and Breakfast, how he thought about how much he would like waking up with Steve by his side every morning. It didn’t make sense to him then, and it didn’t really make sense to him now. But Tony had accepted his feelings for Steve, and it hurt him deeply, knowing that the man’s heart belonged to someone else.
“Yeah, baby?” Tony said, stilling his hands. Steve took that time to regulate his breathing, trying to hold himself together.
“Well I love you, even when you smell like you’ve been sweating for a week,” Steve laughed lightly, pressing another kiss to his love’s lips.
“Well, I must let you rest, good merman,” Tony started, turning for the door. “I shall be back to check in on you, as well as send a meal for you.”
“Thank you for this,” Steve mumbled against the brunette’s mouth.
“Your healing capabilities are rather extraordinary, Steve,” Tony said with a grin, his gaze moving from the merman’s magnetic blue eyes, down to his pink lips and strong chin...
“Yes. Thanks, Tony :)” Steve replied with almost shaking fingers. Steve set his phone down only to pick it up immediately when Tony responded.
He reminded himself once more that he would see Steve soon enough, when he got his shit together and stifled all of Pepper’s irrational words about his feelings towards the super soldier. Tony yawned then, carrying the plate and mug to a semi clean work station, neglecting that pesky formula for the moment. Biting into the sandwich, Tony groaned in delight at how good it was. Steve and his secret skills, like frying bacon to the perfect crispiness.
Tony fucking loved it when Steve rode him, getting to see the man’s face up close as the pleasures of love making etched upon the blonde’s face. Pressing his chest against Steve’s, feeling the man’s hard nipples brushing against his own, Tony groaned, wrapping his arms around Steve and crashing his lips against his love’s.
Thanks for reading! I hope it is still a pleasant story.
“Sorry, sir. We were just leaving,” Steve apologized coolly, eyeing Tony before slipping out of the closet and walking away. The brunette watched him go, blindly grabbing the broom and handing it to the older man.
“Yes, oh God,” Steve whimpered as his entrance clenched around the man’s large erection, the sudden tight drag pushing Steve even closer to the edge.
“It’s okay, Bruce said softly, taking a few deep breaths. “I’d hope I could manage a few jump scares here and there,” he teased. “So, was there something you needed, Steve?”
The genius watched, unmoving and enthralled while he saw Steve spread his legs, knees bent and feet propped against the mattress. The blonde continued to open the bottle of lubricant and spilled a large amount over his fingers and into his palm.
“Oh, Tony,” Steve breathed, spreading his legs and bending his knees so that his beloved had more room to touch him from within.
“Oh, I’d agree entirely. You’ve got great taste in a lot of things,” Steve responded, crawling over to Tony with a lustful gaze. “Especially with picking boyfriends,” he added, getting a boyish grin from the brunette. The super soldier was kneeling between the other man’s legs then, his hands bracketing Tony’s hips. The blonde leaned in, his warm breath ghosting across his love’s soft lips. Tony met the man the rest of the way, his mouth meshing easily with Steve’s. They’ve been together well over a year now, and Tony never tired from the way Steve’s lips felt against his own, the way his tongue glided in his mouth.
“Oh, Fuck!” Tony shouted, everything in him dissolving into euphoria. It was those noises escaping Steve’s mouth and the clench of his opening around Tony’s shaft that pushed him to climax, one hand tight in Steve’s hair, his fingernails of the other almost breaking the skin on one of the blonde’s ass cheeks.
The room filled with the heady sounds of Tony’s gasps and erotic moans while the blonde suckled the velvety head of the other man’s cock. Steve hummed around Tony’s length at one point, slowly working it back until the brunette was fully taken in, the super soldier’s nose brushing against his future husband’s well-groomed pubic hair.
Shutting the door behind him, Tony made his way through the luxury suite of the hotel, loosening his tie and tossing his suite jacket on a nearby sofa. God, he hated those damn meetings. He really didn’t need to be there, the business spectrum was all Pepper, and he trusted her more than himself when it came to that part of Stark Industries. He designed and created all their tech; he never doubted his work, he was a genius after all. He should be in New York, not spending his week sitting around a table filled with men and women who, to put frankly, he really didn’t care about; they weren’t Steve.
Another shudder rolled through Clint, and Tony wondered if he should have found a way for Thor to distract the archer, as well. “He’s our goddamn handler,” Clint hissed, eyes narrowed. “What the hell game is Fury playing?”
“He’s hurt,” Tony said, voice wobbly — and shit, when had the tears started building again, what the hell was with his emotions today? Breath hitching, he stared at Natasha, chin trembling. “Nat, he’s hurt.”
“I can’t stop wondering. I lay down, and I see Bucky fall and I hear Loki’s voice, hear my voice, saying Bucky’s alive. And…and in my heart, I wonder. I survived, Tony. What if he did, too?”
Shit. He should have known it wouldn’t have been that easy to give Nat the slip and find Stern before the night was over. “Nat. Come on.”
“Come on,” he muttered as Fire Guy wiped the foam from his face and stepped forward. Cursing, Tony tried to get out of reach, but wasn’t fast enough. Fire Guy’s hand flung out, latching onto one of the bracelets on Tony’s wrist. Intense pain, brilliant and so harsh air fled his lungs, erupted down his arm.
“So what’s next on your list?” Tony asked, figuring that was a safe conversation starter.
Tony blinked. “Did you just gesture to all of me?”
“Will you have our back if shit goes down?” Tony asked. He was skating too close to the line, he knew it. Risking tipping that they knew about Hydra, when they really didn’t know shit yet.
The Oscar the Grouch scowl returned. “Of course not! I wouldn’t…no. That’s not what happened. But I did let my guard down, just for a second. And he got the jump on me.”
“That went well,” Tony commented as Steve pressed his lips together and stared out the window.
Then again, Happy had been a little busy lately, what with recovering from getting blown up and all….
“Always,” Tony lied. He was going to see if he could dig around in Sitwell’s stuff before officially leaving. Just in case the guy had any thoughts about trying to contact Steve.
“Soundssss great.”
“Of course not, Ms. Hoag, but I’ve just been informed that I’m needed elsewhere. Avengers business, you know,” Tony lied, getting to his feet.
“You have a cat.”
“Believe me, I’m well aware,” Natasha muttered. “And the answer is still no. And if you even
One early evening, Tony dragged himself away from the workshop on his own for once, and back to the penthouse. A breeze billowed in from the hole in the window, making the tarp flutter and flap. Tony eyed it while making himself more coffee, unable to look away. Why hadn’t that been fixed yet? He should have made that a priority. He’d been flung out that fucking window like a rag doll. When they found Loki, Tony was going to fire a repulsor straight up his ass.
But even as his brain attempted to reject the very thought, his mind ran the figures, did the math, and his resolve cracked. Because as much as he didn’t want an injured Steve, a dead Steve was even worse, and if he didn’t get that wound to stop bleeding before the rest of the team found them, Steve was screwed.
“Nobody calls me Nick. And definitely not Nicky,” Fury said pointedly, his scowl deepening. “And you could have e-mailed the hellicarrier upgrades. So I’m inclined to ask, again. What are you doing here?”
“We’ll let you know when it’s pizza time,” Steve said as Tony lifted a hand in a wave goodbye and wandered to the kitchen area. Maybe he’d make another peanut butter sandwich until the pizza got there. He got things down, keeping his hands busy, while his mind buzzed. Things were looking good, the team was on track to become an actual team, but there was something off, something he couldn’t quite place….
FINALLY! A KISS!
about doing it anyway, they will never find your body,” she swore, a warning in her eyes. “So promise me this is the last of that kind of talk.”
“I do not understand. What is this group, and why do they pose such a threat?” Thor asked.
“Right now, Agent Coulson is working with part of a new team. He’s only recently joined them. He does not seem aware of what he has been through. He believes he’s been in Tahiti.”
It was his actual heart that was breaking.
“Uh huh. And I’m Batman. What’s going on?”
Her gaze softened. “I know that, Tony. I just wanted you to be prepared for it if I refuse him and we take a hit.”
The next few weeks passed in a blur of work and Avenging. The team got called out for swamp monsters, a few killer robot incidents, and one giant rat thing that gave Tony shudders for weeks. Despite the constant assembles, the mood of the team was up — they were kicking ass, and it worked. The whole thing worked. And to his complete surprise, Tony found himself in something of a routine for the first time in his life.
Which was something Tony’d always subconsciously known (pizza was delicious, the sky was blue, Steve Rogers was attractive), but now, with that determined blaze in his eyes, Tony felt Steve’s allure ramped to eleven. It wasn’t just his looks, Tony knew. It was the man himself that was so appealing. Steve was a hero, a
” Steve said. “What you do with the suit is amazing, Tony.”
I know it couldn’t have been easy to lose so much at once, and then with Loki fucking with your head about Bucky…”
“I’ll be goddamned,” Fury muttered. The glare was back, and deeper than ever. “Of course she likes you.”
“Why, so he can feel awkward and uncomfortable around me? The guy’s had enough shit to deal with since waking up, Nat, I’m not adding to that by letting him know I’ve got an inconvenient crush.”
, arrogance had no place here) Tony moved to position in front of Steve and lifted his left hand.
“I know plenty,” Tony said, then leaned forward further, pressing his lips near Stern’s ear to whisper, “Hail Hydra, you asshole. Better run to them and hide. Not that it will help. I’m taking you all down.”
Frowning, Steve looked back at Coulson’s photo. “So, what? He ushers Phil off to a new team? To do what?”
“Hmmm,” is all Fury said, placing his hands on the desk. “What do you want me to tell you, Stark? That Shield is creating a suit of armor around the world? That’s your gig, not mine. And you and Cap shut down our Tesseract operation. What do you want from me?”
Initially, Tony cringed at the sentence itself, and then his nostrils flared when he realized who the voice belonged to.  Senator Stern, the blowhard who’d dragged Tony to court, trying to get ahold of the armor, walked by Tony and Natasha, oblivious to the two Avengers as he complained to some poor man trotting along next to him. Tony’s good mood instantly plummeted as he stared after them, lips curling.
“Mr. Stark, are you listening? Surely we’re not boring you.” Anne Marie pursed her lips at him, the scolding evident to everyone in the room. Tony winced. Ever since he purchased the DoDC to keep the weapons from Shield’s clutches, he’d felt like he would never live up to the woman’s expectations.
A clang sounded, and a familiar shield boomeranged into five of them, giving him a temporary break while the rest scattered.
, Tony had no idea what that actually meant.
Tony frowned. “What are you talking about, Big Guy?”
He worked until he face-planted into the table again, and slept for a few miserable hours. When he woke, he was once again drenched in sweat, shaking, the fall from the portal replaying through his mind. Wishing there was some way to extract that fucking memory from his brain, he immediately went right back to work, until JARVIS had had enough, and cut him off until he “got some real rest.”
“So?”
“I’m fine,” Steve said, wincing again and bracing his hand on his knee. “Gimme a second.”
“Tony…”
Tony had been five the first time his dad had told him about the two best friends. Not having a best friend himself, he’d immediately wished he had a friend like Barnes or Cap. Thought it would have been incredible to have someone on your side like that, without a doubt. But now he had a best friend, and couldn’t imagine what it would have been like for Steve to lose Barnes like that. The thought of losing Rhodey, helpless to stop it, had the cold rushing through him again, making him shudder.
JARVIS spoke again. “Six thousand feet.”
He could have completely recreated the scene, and said,
” Tony said softly but forcefully, terrified as he watched Steve’s hands clench and unclench, while he practically vibrated from terror. “You can’t blame yourself for what happened to him. Whether he survived or not, what happened to him isn’t your fault, Steve. He wouldn’t want you blaming yourself.”
But who had looked so relieved, had grinned so brilliantly, after Tony woke after the battle.
“Will you let it go?” Steve ran a hand through his hair, wincing as the movement jostled his injuries.
I am not sure, but I am fairly certain there was another fic (or possibly a few?) out there somewhere, where Darcy has a Twitter account about
The words sounded like a promise. Tony found it was one he looked forward to.
“I can’t, I don’t know how to flip the screen!” Happy snarled. “Don’t talk to me like that anymore, you’re not my boss.”
“I’m actually calling regarding a meeting I have tomorrow. An Aldrich Killian has requested to meet with me.”
“What did you do?”
“I…yeah. I guess I did.” Dammit, his ears were burning at the memory. He just had to go and make an ass of himself in front of Spangles, hadn’t he?
power kicks in,” said Tony.
” Tony snarled.
“Tell me everything that’s happened since the last time we spoke.”
“Say what?”
undo all of the work he had done to come to terms with that just because he was afraid of ending the borrowed time he was already living on.
LIKELIHOOD VERDICT:
Steve, Bruce, Tony, Thor, and Natasha all look around as though something's missing and they're searching for it. There's a conspicuous spot where Clint should be.
“Hey, Tony?” said Bruce, who was standing ahead of them. “Oh! Um…”
“Yeah, I can get behind that,” says Bruce.
COMMON ROOM FLOOR
Steve tried and loved every house soda they had, and then after they’d eaten their fill it was time to head over to

“Also, double dates are way more fun than single ones," said Rhodey. "You’re still single, aren’t you Tony?”
“Only the second one from me, but I’ll respect her decision either way,” said Tony.
He’s my fucking dad!
“Then had his nose broken.”
“So we can keep dating for keeps,” said Steve.
“What’s the stupidest thing you ever did when you were thinking with your dick?” said Tony, “Hang on, let me tell you mine first. I stole an ice cream truck when I was sixteen because I thought it would get me laid.”
AN: If you're reading this with a screen reader, you should know I've configured the horizontal rule that starts this chapter, and all future horizontal rules in the story, to look like green and black stars. The look I was going for was something like magical energy. Also, the text is no longer configured to look like a paperback novel.
“This isn’t about me and Clint,” said Natasha, as she leaned forward from her seat on the adjacent love seat and took Tony’s hands between hers. “This is about you and Steve. He loves you, Tony.”
“How about dinner?”
” shouted Natasha.
By now you’ve caught up and they have no place to go except the tiny room. They all stand just in front of it, and you lunge for them. All of them move out of the way as your head goes into the small room.

“You shouldn’t have to dumb yourself down to get a date, Tony.”
Notes:
Well, this sucks.
Steve pressed his lips together and sighed.
“Your date gets handsy with someone else and you don’t say a peep?”
“Why would I tell Nat and Clint to--”
“Look,” said Tony, as he stopped to look at Steve. “I’m sorry I was acting like an asshole and I get you’re trying to be nice here, but you’re not my therapist and you’re not even my friend. So if it’s all the same to you, I think we should stick a pin in this, buy a tacky magnet for the fridge, and call this a mixed results start to Operation Capsicle Listicle.”
“What?” said Steve incredulously.

Steve chuckled and said, “If I ever go over to the dark side, who says I’m not taking you with me?”

“Listen to me, please,” said Steve. “I should’ve died seventy-five years ago, Tony. Instead I got five amazing, beautiful years with you. In a way it’s almost greedy to wish that I had more.”
Yeah, the whole plastic thing and talking to victims thing is alright, but definite room for improvement.
“Well done, Steve,” said Thor, slapping Steve on the back.

“I don’t remember that,” said Tony.
“I still can’t believe you want to leave. After only an hour of people in spandex pretending to lick their own butt holes? You can go if you want, but that’s totally my fetish.”
“You always need to try to come home."
“What the hell would I do with a car in New York City?”
Rich, white, male, and well-educated. Practically invisible to the police.
Tony didn’t have an answer for that. So he did what he always did when he didn’t have an answer. He made shit up.
“No, sugar, the point is to help the new people make a space for themselves here. Can’t say you don’t belong if you had to go through baptism by fire to get in, can you? But we’re getting off topic. Why haven’t you asked your friend out yet?”
“Leave JARVIS out of this. Besides, he’s biased. He likes you better than he likes me.”

The teenager looked up at him and realized for the first time she was talking to Tony Stark.
Steve looked, and Tony was right; someone was staring. He didn’t have his phone out yet, but it was only a matter of time.
“Even if loving someone else would be simpler?”
Two things. One, this is Ivan Petrovich. Wanted dead or alive in five states.
“When they asked,” said Steve with a sheepish smile.
There was no such assurance if Tony asked Steve out. First, Steve was almost certainly straight, but even if they lived in the hypothetical, made-up, happy-land universe where a hard enough crush on a straight boy made him like you back, a relationship with Steve was a bad idea. Tony had plenty of exes who hated him and he hated them right back. There was so much more at stake here than there’d been with Pepper, too. The Avengers were at the other end of the Big Red Phone on every world leader’s desk. People depended on them. That had been the reason they’d started this whole project in the first place; the Avengers needed stability, and two of its members constantly taking potshots at each other undermined that stability and created a potential for danger. Tony would be damned if he took all the work they had done to get where they are and threw it out the window because Steve was… kind. And earnest. And fucking
That’s not even a quarter of my chips. What do you say we make it interesting?
Tony needed to stall.
“Because it’s
“Good point, but I was going to button it on the inside of my shirt,” said Clint.
“I’m good, Steve,” said Tony, wiping his mouth with his sleeve and trying not to take in the flecks of blood that were spotting the petals now. “Now, where were we?”
wrong. I’ve got a talent for messing up.”
“Apparently the tabs have been losing their minds the past few weeks trying to figure out who Tony Stark’s red scarf knitter is, and she had a betting pool with her friends about it and wanted my insight. You see, in this video, which she played for me on her phone, someone filmed you in a yarn store having an anxious conversation with the owner about a red scarf,” said Steve.
Tony let out a small laugh despite himself.
Also, to all the readers who've taken the time to write kind comments on a made-up story about two sweet super boys in love, you are truly the bomb.
Something happened on my floor?
The cool blue light of the reactor filled the room, and Tony took in several things in quick succession:
“You know, just this once, I think Tony’s right. Ethiopian sounds really good right now,” says Steve.
, Rogers. Now I have wasted too much of my time on this high school bullshit already, and since this was Colonel Rhodes’s plan, I am going to let him take it from here.”
Well, “ok” was a bit of a lie, but it was close enough to the truth. Tony knew he wouldn’t have another panic attack when Steve finished turning him down. He’d just feel like he did now: crappy, deflated, but also a bit lighter. Because now, he and Steve were on the same page. Now he didn’t have to pretend anymore, to Steve or to himself.
Steve stood there mutely for a moment, contemplating whether he was going to get any kind of productive result from this bizarre conversation. When he realized the answer was “probably not,” he spun on his heel to leave.

“Hope you’re in position, Nat,” said Clint as the doors closed.
, just because he’s the tin man and I’m Iron Man.”
“Oh no.”
“Welcome back, big guy,” said Bruce, offering his hand to help him up.
In a moment, Nat heard the faint hum of electricity starting up around her, and saw the lasers and motion detectors come back on in the vent below her.
“Tony, having had worse days before doesn’t mean you can’t feel rotten about having a bad day now. And you did, Tony, you had a really,
Tony needed to find some new tentpoles.
“Will we know for certain when we find it?” Clint asks.
Steve paused, and said, “Are you alright?”
“Right,” says Natasha carefully.
“If we include the roof, the containment floor is in the center, but I don’t think that necessarily means it’s definitely there,” Tony continues, as he starts drawing concentric circles starting from the containment floor and working outwards. “We already know this artifact packs a kick, so it could hypothetically be anywhere.
from Doug. “Help me out with something. There were not one but two perfectly good New York teams that had been kicked out of the city but had loyal fanbases here, and instead of bringing one back they up and made the Mets. Why?”
“You’re right. If we’re going to throw down, we shouldn’t do it in the elevator. Want to go have a flame war in the comments section? Or maybe I'll get my suit and we can see what she did to the gym. But I’ll take a brawl with you any day over you running away with your tail between your legs.”
started to play through the speakers.
“That’s fair. I’m sorry.”

“Not my choice,” said Pepper through gritted teeth.
“I won’t. I will never ask you to stop inventing, Tony. I will never ask you to stop being Iron Man. Never. I just— you know how we just promised each other we’ll always try to come home? I want you to always try to come home from the lab, Tony. I want you to
“Yeah. Asgard was eager to get their escaped prisoner back. Also to figure out how she got out and who else might be missing. If the breach is as bad as they think it is, we could be busy with Thor’s enemies for a while.”
“That’s the plan,” said Natasha.
“Sure you can!” said Tony brightly, “When they ask why you let me leave with a Starkphone, tell them I was Tony fucking Stark, and then point them to the security footage to confirm.”
(to the TURBOLIFT)
“You get a lot from her, y’know,” said Steve. “Speaking as someone who’s met half of your parents. You’re less like Howard than most people think.”
“You fell in with us, didn’t you?” said Natasha with a quirk to her lip. “You must’ve done
“Nope,” said Steve with a little self-satisfied grin.
Sure enough, they hadn’t even completed one rotation of the spiral when Tony said, “Mom’s art of choice was the ballet. Which Howard thought was boring as dirt, so she took me when she went. I take after my dad as far as interest in ballet goes, but the alternative was letting her go alone, and mom spent enough time alone as it was. But paintings were Howard’s thing, which is why you didn’t see anything that even hinted she existed.”

Natasha reached over toward the debit card slot on the ATM, wrapped her fingers around the plastic protrusions, and pulled. They came away easily, revealing a second, smaller set of plastic slats underneath.
Tony clapped him on the shoulder with pride.
“Get out of there, Nat, you’ve got five seconds!” Tony shouted over the comms, and Natasha could hear he wasn’t even pretending to type anymore. With a final pull Natasha hurled herself over the edge of the vent drop.
As soon as Tony was out of sight of the front desk guards, he took out his Starkphone and started pinging for Nat’s GPS locator.
“Rhodey is out of the country on War Machine business. And even if he weren’t, the General wants you to give the presentation. God knows why, but he insisted.”
Twenty minutes later, when Tony’s coat was stained with old spaghetti sauce and something else rancid as he pawed open a box with a blue X on it, the wave had diminished to a surge. Two minutes after that, when he was out of the dumpster and snapping his SIM card into a glittery, lilac Hello Kitty flip phone, the surge was a light wake. When the phone immediately started ringing, with Rhodey’s name flashing across the front, the wake became a vortex of anxiety. Why was Rhodey calling
Thor—
Bruce straightened up and said, “I’m sorry. Childhood trauma about lightning. But I’m in control. It’s alright.”
If they don’t get a clue after this, we’re locking them in the Tingler until they bone it out.
She turns to you, her eyes sparkling with tears and starlight and firelight, and says, “How do you put it behind you? That decision you made that started all of this, putting hot sauce on your sandwich, how can you—”
Steve turned toward Tony and saw what looked like fight or flight on his face. But then it was replaced with something like resignation.
“Steve—”
His biographers are pretty sure he was gay. And he was nice to Steve.
“You know there’s more letters in LGBT than L and G, right? We added a plus and everything,” said Frank.
“Tell me what we know,” said Tony almost pleadingly.
Natasha didn’t open her eyes immediately when she regained consciousness. She was in a small, well-lit space with a polished stone floor that smelled relatively clean, most likely an elevator. Around her were two people who were shifting their weight uneasily. Her hands weren’t bound, and she wasn’t drugged. If they’d counted on her staying knocked out they were about to get quite a surprise.
“Why—”
“Yes, precisely,” says Thor.
“I think I know what’s up,” said Bruce, as walked onto the stage. “Steve thinks it’s a problem that he can’t sing.”
His last conscious thought before he passed out was of something woody and stiff coming up his throat, and Steve shouting for a doctor.
“She does seem like the type to mean it that way,” says Natasha thoughtfully. “So that rules out Thor’s floor, Bruce’s floor, and the Common Room floor, potentially.”

“When the time comes, I will strike true,” said Thor. “You have my word.”
Tony coughed, and a few more rose petals brushed past his lips onto his lap.

“Well, that’s the only way I can think of right now to stop loving you, Tony,” said Steve.
Of course it wasn’t until he was actually inside the aquarium two hours later that he realized a sparkly blue mermaid invitation to an aquarium after hours birthday party was something for your
who’s breaking promises?” said Tony.
“Or perhaps he would be more amenable to negotiation after a few days with mjölnir parked on his foot,” said Thor. “Although honestly, I don’t see why we can’t simply take it from him.”

“I’m with Tony on this one. Anybody can swing a hammer, but figuring out vegetarian chili that doesn’t taste like sad beans in sad bean water is like finding El Dorado in the vegetarian world. The fact that it’s vegan makes it even more unbelievable.” — Bruce
“What was Maria like?” asked Steve.
“Spirit Halloween.”
“Oh you know,” said Tony, waving his hand vaguely. When Steve didn’t respond, Tony sighed and mimicked, “Tony, you sure are a swell fella, but I don’t swing that way. And even if I did, you’ve got too many issues for us to make it work. And even if you didn’t, your dad was my wartime BFF and this would be too weird. And even if he weren’t, it’d be bad for the team. And even if—”
And that caught Steve off guard. He looked at the painting: a Picasso of a blonde woman seated in an armchair. Then he looked back at Tony.
“C’mon,” said Tony, as he took Steve’s hand and pulled him out of the car. “This’ll be fun.”

movies.
“And that this problem needed outside help,” said Tony.
“Better than good,” said Natasha. “Ledgers with sales to Hydra, the Sokovian Mafia, a couple of dictators... everything Homeland Security would need to put Hammer away for a very, very long time.”
Bruce pointed directly at Tony.
“Tony, I know you’re really excited about another genius coming to live with us, but if I put off what I came down here to say any longer I’m going to lose my nerve. And I really don’t want that to happen,” said Steve.
“That doesn’t count and you know it,” said Clint, who then added, “If I’d known you’d like it that much, I’d’ve prepared a whole performance about punching villains in the dick.”
“Wonder what the people at the Christmas party are thinking of this,” said José.
,” said Steve, who was starting to get fed up with this conversation, “No, Tony, I just don’t know why you’re making such a big deal out of a couple of friendly shoulder pats.”
The STRANGER lets go of her wrist, then tilts his head so he and NATASHA can both look each other in the eye. There’s shocked recognition in both of their faces, as NATASHA sees her foster father IVAN PETROVICH for the first time in years, and IVAN sees his in-universe daughter.
“I don’t want to have a kid that’s biologically related to me,” said Tony.
“Oh, that? No, you’re not, I said it. Is that why you stopped the elevator? J, you can start’er up again.”
I'd like to dedicate this chapter and the next one to the memory of Miguel Algarín, co-founder of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, who passed away yesterday (December 1st, 2020).

Steve? He wanted to melt into the seat,” said Tony. “Believe it or not Steve and I are friends outside of work and I try to watch his back when I can.”
“Sorry,” Steve said quickly, realizing Tony’s change in tone, “I didn’t mean to-” There was a clatter then, and a startled sound from underneath the car.
This was his perfect opportunity to go over and talk to the man that captured his heart and mind. Tony was his friend, his fellow avenger, and as his friend, Steve should be there trying to help comfort him, talking out whatever it was Tony had on his mind. Maybe he couldn’t be there as a lover or boyfriend, but he could at least push his romantic feelings down for the guy.
“Hi, Steve,” she said in return, crossing her arms on a smaller plane of rock and laying her head in the crook of her elbows. The rest of her body swished and swayed in the salty, languid sea. “You’re out late tonight,” Natasha remarked, her green eyes gleaming with moonlight. Steve huffed a small laugh, looking out at nothing in particular.
Tony gazed upon his lover, his eyes fixated on every little detail in the super soldier’s expression as he pumped that finger inside him. Eventually he added a second and then a third finger into the blonde, kneading the sensitive flesh of the man’s channel. Steve’s face was absolutely glorious to watch. And though he wasn’t hard just yet, the brunette could feel that heated coil in his belly begin to form. Tony’s breath caught with each small moan and gasp that spilled from the other man’s lips.
“Hey now,” Tony murmured against Steve’s mouth. “You think kissing me is gonna get you out of that comment?” Steve grinned, biting his boyfriend’s bottom lips and pulling back a bit.
“I know. But he really should focus on his meetings. Pepper made it clear how crucial they were for both Tony and Stark Industries,” Steve said with a sigh, sipping at his coffee again.
"Hello," Steve said tentatively, not sure what to do or say in that moment.
Eventually, that temporary contentment vanished as the corruption of humanity brought out the worst in S.H.I.E.L.D the parasitic legion of Hydra uprooting the holistic mission of the original S.H.I.E.L.D. Steve found himself once again without a place to call home.
Forgetting himself, Tony observed the strapping musculature of Steve’s chest and abdomen before settling on his iridescent aqua tail. Steve was a remarkable sight in the name of science and physicality. Tony wasn’t sure why he had seemed so bewitched by Steve, but he cleared his throat, and took a breath, realizing he was not clandestine in his open observations of the merman.
“It’s wonderful to see all she accomplished during a time where it was even harder for women to hold authoritative roles.” Tony could hear Steve’s voice sounding morose, and Tony just huffed an irritated sigh.
“I think we should establish a safe word,” Tony said then, resting his hands on the super soldier’s upper thighs, lovingly caressing the defined muscles that moved under soft, creamy skin. Tony could see that he caught Steve by surprise, his brows furrowing in thought.
I got a heart rush, ain’t slowin’ down
“It’s just. He’s Tony,” Steve sighed, going over to sit on his bed. “He flourishes in the spotlight,” Steve remarked. “There are bound to be countless women fighting for his attention, to link their arm with his.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, Nat,” Steve said, acting casual.
Tony stilled the super soldier’s movements though, grabbing at his arousal and lining it with the other man’s loose rim once again. The men sealed their gaze with one another, the brunette asking silently for the go ahead. Steve gave a simple yes, before sinking down on his man. The genius let out a strangled huff as he was surrounded by Steve’s wet heat. Without warning, he bucked up into the blonde, meeting Steve’s movement with his own and fully sheathing himself inside the super soldier.
“Nothing to be concerned about Nick. See ya in two hours,” Tony said.
“I truly do love you,” Steve said in a hushed tone. Eyes heavy then. He splayed his fingers on the face of the reactor then while Tony wrapped an arm around his boyfriend.
“Damn, Steve. You’re getting hard already?” Tony asked, eyeing his swelling length.
Obadiah huffed a breath and smirked. He flipped his pistol in his hand so that he gripped the barrel. “Good,” he said before hitting Steve with the butt of his gun, knocking the merman out cold.
light, rather than platonic friends. I thought the feelings would go away, that it was just Pepper’s voice echoing in my subconscious. But, Rhodes, it’s been weeks and they haven’t subsided,” Tony said. His friend just looked at him with sympathy. “I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do.” Tony sounded defeated, swirling a fry into his ketchup.
Steve had the best station in his opinion. He painted little Christmas and other holiday pictures on the kids’ chubby chapped cheeks. Seeing their faces light up when they looked at their painted cheek in the hand held mirror made Steve’s heart swell. They’d hug him goodbye, holding onto their parent’s hand and waving to Steve as they walked away. Steve would give them a soldier’s salute before security let the next child take a seat and picking out the image they wanted done.
“Would you come for me, Steve?” He whispered as his hand that was playing at his penis head wrapped around the thick heavy length, stroking it rhythmically as the anal beads slid out.
A few months after that, he and Pepper broke up. And Tony's mind continued to torture him as the little thoughts he had entertained about he and Pepper being soulmates fizzled out like suffocated ember. It wasn’t good for him to be in the mansion all alone, he knew that. He needed to just make the move to the new Avengers tower and get it all fixed up. The brunette kept dragging his feet though; he just wasn’t ready. There was a part of him that believed Pepper would come back, that they'd work things out.
,” Tony huffed, his eyes jerking open, staring at Steve wide eyed while the blonde continued to ride him, just the way the brunette wanted him to. Tony began to buck his hips, lurching into Steve with that same driven passion. The blonde sighed, allowing his head to fall back as he felt everything anew, the pain ripe from being over sensitive. His swelling erection slapped against his belly, sprinkling his abs with more glistening precome, mixing with his dried release from earlier.
Steve followed right behind him. “You just want to get a piece of cake with a giant flower on it. Don’t you?” Steve asked with a laugh.
“Well no worries. People are pretty quiet and respectful around here. Nobody should be bothering you,” Jerry said.
“Well, considering there isn’t a scrap left on my dish,” I say you did extremely well,” Steve cooed, leaning over on his chair and giving his boyfriend a loving smooch. The brunette hummed in delight, smiling into the kiss and reaching a hand up to cradle one of the blonde’s sculpted cheeks.
“You’re not wrong about that,” he agreed. “We’d end up not going anywhere. So, did you have anything in mind then?” Steve inquired.
