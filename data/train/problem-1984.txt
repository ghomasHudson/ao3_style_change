Boxing Day - Mycroft Holmes Suite at the Diogenes Club
“Yes”
Mycroft blinked, “Asked you… how?”
On their announcement by the butler, the Duke sprang to his feet.
Mrs Turner and her married ones, who had been so helpful in the re-ordering of the flat B, were the first to arrive, followed closely by Molly and Stefan. Mrs Hudson rushed to show off the poppy seed cake which had pride of place in the centre of the table surrounded by the more traditional English fare of mince pies, samosas, pakora and sausage rolls.
“And your point is?”
He went first to the library and the modern American literature section which turned out to be empty apart from a mis-shelved copy of
“Only if there is intent to robbery”
. Obviously, some incident that had incurred the teacher’s wrath.
John looked up, in order to read the information display, then suddenly had the impression he was being watched. He tried to turn his head without making it too conspicuous, and there, partially hidden behind a copy of the Evening Standard, and a pair of rather idiosyncratic sunglasses was Sherlock.
“Once, and for an experiment doesn’t count.”
“I thought you had forgotten.”
“I’m young, alive, I may be a successful woman, but I too yearn for love and companionship and someone to love me in return, and in Gregory I have found that someone. That’s why we have decided to bring our wedding forward and will be tying the knot two weeks today, I hope you will all join us on our special day.”

After Abe Garvey had finished his story, the plain clothes officer, DS Cooper, formally arrested him and led him away to be escorted to police headquarters in Norwich. DI Martin stayed behind to finish matters with Sherlock and John.
“Dinah is a magician and a brilliant one. The key to the profession of magic is misdirection, and these murders are a masterpiece of misdirection. She murdered her first husband, Manny, otherwise known as the
“Budge up then, I’m not about to freeze my bollocks off out here”
From:
“No.”
“Ransom?”
“Now, where shall I begin?”
“Richard Hilton-Cubitt fired a shot above your head to warn you, it hit the window frame. In turn you shot him through the heart. What you would have seen if you had looked back a little longer is Eddie Hilton pick up his husband’s gun and fire it at close range into his own head. How the bullet didn’t kill him outright I can only wonder.”
John protested. “But they hardly know each other.”
John saw red, he had had a miserable day, come to think of it he had had a miserable couple of weeks. He wished he had never heard of Dinah Shepherd or got dragged into Greg’s matrimonial affairs. He wanted it to go back to how it was, the cases, clients, crap telly, Chinese takeaways, experiments, tea, toast and violin solos. Just the three of them, or four if your counted Mrs H which he did, against the world.
The General Medical Council considered Dr Watson’s position in the light of this conviction but decided it did not warrant the removal of his licence to practice medicine. It was John’s own decision not to renew his licence, after all, he reasoned to Lestrade, what earthly use were his degrees in medicine, if he could not save the life of the one person who mattered most to him in the world?
Sherlock doesn’t finish the sentence. Eurus is catatonic but still he doesn’t trust her.
“James Wilder! Arthur’s kidnapper and your assailant.” Sherlock declared with a flourish.
“So, they have broken their daughter’s heart, and possibly put her off relationships for life just so they can live in her property and on her money for the rest of their naturals.”
Sherlock let her go, taking the opportunity to snaffle a fourth mince pie in her absence.
“Do you know anything about them?”
Equipped with two large torches, Aveling headed for the main door but Sherlock stopped him.
John thinks as he leaves the clinic.
Sherlock looked surprised, “Wasn’t he at school with Mycroft?”
Sherlock had spent a restless evening and a sleepless night prowling the corridor of his mind palace searching for examples of the incident with the third soldier, but he had come away empty handed. He was convinced he had never made a deduction without observed data to corroborate it. Frankly, it unnerved him.  The scientist in him concluded that the only solution was a control experiment to see if it happened again.
“You’re never too old for a kiss under the mistletoe” Mrs Hudson stated and proceeded to prove it with a bewildered Mr Chatterjee.
Sherlock immediately downloaded the attachment, it was a longer message, twenty-five characters in all, but his success with the previous messages meant that he soon had most of it translated. He looked up from the paper on his desk, and John could see the anxiety in his face.
“Failed first efforts…which by the way you were never meant to see, the point of my not inconsiderable efforts to destroy them…git!”
However, the shop appeared kosher, filled to the brim with the most beautiful blooms imaginable. There wasn’t anyone on the till, which pleased Mary, she hated being pounced on the minute she walked into a shop, and it allowed her to wander around without having to say, ‘just looking’. Mary was soon caught up with examining the various displays like they were exhibits in a museum. Apart from roses she knew nothing about flowers,
“Tea?” John asked, Sherlock shook his head. “We saved you some dim sum if you’re hungry.” Again, Sherlock shook his head.
Sherlock’s suspicious look got stronger. “Who told you that, and why this sudden interest in my family?”
******
“So the maintenance guy did it?”
The stranger looked surprised and pleased for a moment and then he sadly shook his head and said, “Unfortunately, I am married to my work.”
Except perhaps he’s not because just maybe it’s not the miniscule dance floor that’s causing John and Mr Cheekbones to be dancing in ever decreasing circles round each other.
, Mary was absently perusing the menu. This was mainly for show, she almost invariably ordered a chicken bhuna and a chapati, but it gave her time to watch the other diners and clock the exits, she never sat with her back to the door. Mary also silently assessed the newcomer, Antonia. She had a very strong suspicion that Antonia had cultivated Janine’s friendship to get close to her, Mary wasn’t put out by this, she’d done it herself many times before, in truth, her friendship with Janine had arisen from similar motives. But if it was the case, she wanted to get a handle on Antonia as quickly as possible, and the most efficient way to achieve that was to invite her in.
There will be time enough to mourn that little boy, his childhood best friend, the intrepid Redbeard with his ginger hair and eye patch, reduced to a pile of bones.
Murray is on good form, regaling John with the most entertaining snippets of Camp gossip, and it is some time before he notices how John is favouring his right hand while the left, his dominant one, is fixed firmly at his side. Murray refrains from questions but wonders just how far from being fit for work his old friend is.
“I’m sorry,” the woman said in a voice that clearly indicated she was nothing of the sort, “but you shouldn’t be in here.”
Baker Street at Night. Some months after the events of The Final Problem
“No, I really don’t think so.” Sherlock said firmly, but the others had heard the phrase ‘on the house’ and shouted him down.
“Not everything, you were speaking quite low, but I heard enough.”
“Sentimental associations,” John contributed. “Perhaps her husband made his money after they married.”
“Oh they’re never too young to enjoy Christmas, my Ronan loves it. What did you do last year?”
“It seems that the bone of contention was the use of the word ‘niece’ as the descriptor of the beneficiary, sloppy work by the solicitor who drew up the will although he compensated for that later on.  In fact, Edna Flugrath had no nieces merely two distant relatives one of whom was the daughter of a second cousin, and the other a second cousin by marriage. Our Mary Sutherland was named after her mother who was therefore also known as Mary Sutherland until her second marriage when she took her new husband’s name.
John tries again, “No, really listen. I need your help.”
“There was something else. When I had told James that he would always be provided for and have a place on the estate he had interpreted this to mean much more than a job and a home. The estate is not entailed, there is no such thing anymore, but my grandfather set up the Holderness Trust, so that the estate and the land would always follow the title.  I have very little money of my own, my wife,” here the Duke indicated the Duchess with another incline of his head, “very wisely no doubt, kept control of her fortune and, I am sure she would agree when I say, she was happy to invest heavily in maintaining and improving the estate so that it is in much better shape than it was when I inherited, however it still struggles to pay its way. Arthur will be in a better position,” Again the Duke wordlessly consulted his wife, “as he is likely to receive a substantial trust from his mother at twenty-one, and again on coming into the title. But it was a shock I believe to James, when he began to work on the estate to realise just how little actual cash is at my disposal.
However tired he was, he could not afford the luxury of sleep, not yet. At his flat Greg brewed the strongest cup of black coffee as he could possibly stand and went off to have a shower. Once he was washed and shaved and dressed in fresh clothes, he began to feel livelier. He prised two slices of bread off a frozen loaf and made toast which he washed down with another industrial strength cup of coffee. As an afterthought he brushed his teeth, checked his phone for a text message and headed back into the city.
“Decorating your flat, you can’t leave it bare for Rosie’s first Christmas, and besides I want a little festive cheer for my party”
John was taken aback, then asked hopefully, “you wouldn’t consider a divorce?”
“You’re having your party in my flat?”
Sherlock shrugged off his coat and followed John and the tray of whisky through to their sitting room. Sherlock noted that his brother was sitting in his chair but made no effort to move him, instead he went over to the table and sat there, all the while observing his sibling and deducing the state of affairs.
Alice Baker was a slightly built, dark haired young woman of around nineteen. She was obviously under a considerable amount of strain, as demonstrated by the dark shadows beneath her eyes and the way she nervously plucked at her clothes and bit her nails.

“Next time.”
A visit to Scotland Yard and a domestic interlude.
Always an early riser, the combination of army and medical training and a lively eleven month old meant that Saturday mornings were as active as any other day. He’d loaded the washing machine, and vacuumed the whole flat while waiting for his Tesco delivery. Once this had arrived and been put away he decided to treat himself to a second breakfast at the market café.
“Blimey, it’s cold in here.”
Sherlock made a disgusted noise which was so utterly familiar that it induced a pang of nostalgia in John.
“She’s wrong you know, marriage doesn’t have to change anything, you’ll still be living at 221b, you’ll have more room once I’ve left, and I’ll still be going on cases, and needing help with clients. I hope I’ll still be welcome to come round.”
It is essential that John be evacuated as a matter of priority, his old friend Murray is detailed to accompany him. The helicopter ride is torture, with John sedated but not completely unconscious; his temperature and vital signs are a cause of alarm for Bill, as are John’s incoherent ramblings.
We catch up with Greg
John would have given a great deal to lie in bed a while longer, maybe to spend an hour or so continuing his exploration of Sherlock’s body and mapping his erogenous zones, but a little sing song voice sounded over the monitor.
******
As a doctor John was satisfied with his diagnosis of the cause of Rosie’s unhappiness, the two bright red patches high on her cheek and the hard line of her gum on the upper left side heralded the arrival of another tooth. He had Calpol and teething gel, he could cope.
Didn’t he used to have a whiteboard of some kind? He supposed that it was yet something else of his past that had not survived the explosion. He turned back to his laptop, quickly googled chalk boards, and having found what he wanted, turned on ‘one click’ shopping. Problem solved.
“I saw what you didn’t, Sherlock, that afternoon in Wilvercombe… I saw the look on your face; the same look that was there when you woke up this morning. Pure terror.”
“I admit I was not happy with the idea of you marrying anyone else.”
Eddie’s (officially named the Surf Shack) was sandwiched between two such establishments, Sherlock pushed the door and went in with John following closely behind. The front of the shop was filled with brightly coloured surfboards, wetsuits and other surfing paraphernalia. Behind this was another room with a handful of tables and chairs, a counter and a half a dozen substantial looking computers along one wall. As Sherlock had predicted the café wasn’t busy, and he and John seated themselves at two adjacent computers as the proprietor came over and greeted Sherlock as if he was an old friend.
John was tempted to tease a while longer but was in fact too curious himself so produced an envelope, unopened from his back pocket. The address was clearly typed.
Sherlock thought to himself before being brought back by John saying.
Sherlock dismissed this as ridiculous, “What life? I’ve been away.”
“My dear boy, six thousand years, and I never knew you suffer from hay fever.”
Stir-Up Sunday comes from the collect (special prayer) for the last Sunday before Advent in the Church of England Book of Common Prayer and is the day traditionally Christmas puddings were made.
“What’s this?”
“Apologies,
Sherlock was in that state of overwhelming tedium where the alternatives were to shoot up or shoot the wall. As John’s gun no longer lived at Baker Street, and the idea of sending for Bill Wiggins was becoming increasingly attractive, the arrival of Lestrade with a mystery was a God send, even though the case was barely a three.
The wallpaper however was the same, John had been peculiarly insistent on that even going as far as tracking down some company in Somerset that specialised in the manufacture of one-off reproductions for film sets and the National Trust. Sherlock had even begun to wonder if John was being so particular because he intended to move back into 221b but once the first floor renovations were completed, he had gone back to his job at the clinic, part-time, and Sherlock had hardly seen him since.
The support officer made tea and toast for everyone and persuaded Mrs King to go and lie down. The SOCOs continued their examination of the premises while DI Martin was itching to know what Sherlock had put in the note, he had seen quite plainly it contained no words, and Sherlock was just as eager to show off his brilliance.
“Sometimes it’s good; sometimes it’s bad, sometimes it is fucking awful and sometimes all three at the same time. It is what it is.”
Fun had been conspicuous by its absence for most of his life. It had skipped his childhood and adolescence almost entirely, and while it had occasionally accompanied his experiments with certain class A substances during his university career and early days in London, it hadn’t hung around for long. It had arrived and given the impression it might stay around when he had moved into Baker Street with his flatmate and friend John Watson, not that Sherlock had placed too much hope in this. Correctly it seemed, all too soon fun had been banished into exile, along with Sherlock himself, in the dark days of Moriarty’s brief reign and after.
“Then you must have evidence pertinent to the events.”
“I have met the Duke.” Sherlock replied.
Crowley gave it his full attention, he studied Aziraphale at great length and in great detail. He accessed his memories of Dr Watson from the Boscombe Valley Hotel in conjunction with a variety of photographs from the popular press; (he learned a significant amount of Sherlock Holmes’ backstory from these sources as well), and came up with a look which, in Crowley’s opinion, was guaranteed to appeal.
“I think I’ll surprise John. He’ll be delighted!”
; she’s filed for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.”
Steve and Danny had left, with the promise to say nothing of the morning’s adventures until Arthur was back home. Sherlock had hoped to manage his return with John without drawing too much attention to themselves, it was lunchtime and the boys and most of the staff were engaged in the dining room. Unfortunately, this ruled out his plan to smuggle John back into the school through the kitchens and they were forced to use the main doors. Dr Huxtable flew out of rooms, closely followed by Tony Aveling, the moment they arrived at the main entrance, and was alternately fussing over John and the state he was in, and berating Sherlock for having left that morning without a word to anyone.
Sherlock was disconcerted, it was fine to masquerade as a clairvoyant to strangers in a strange town but to be exposed as such amongst people in a social setting and in the city he loved, made him feel cheap.
When his Sweetie returned from terrorising the officers at Scotland Yard, John sat him down, and told him that he wanted to try an experiment.  His beloved liked experiments so he readily agreed.
They stepped out into the rain and set off down the Promenade towards the beach, John found himself trotting a little to keep up until the taller man realised and slowed his pace.
It was probably not the most tactful question under the circumstances, particularly as the answer was patently obvious but Lestrade seemed prepared for it.
John sighed again, “You missed the norovirus, the chronic back pain and the alcoholic poisoning, it’s been a busy morning. What are you doing here?”
“John!” Sherlock exclaimed, holding up a DVD of
John could not have instigated the disappearance, that was nonsense unless… Sherlock paused, John might have actively removed Lord Saltire from the school had he suspected the child was in danger…
Sherlock laughed, “Remiss of me.”
“Tell me, was this a mere addition to the ﬁrst, or did it appear to be entirely separate?”
, “what were you thinking?”
“Where are we going?” John asked once they were level.
John made up his mind, if he was mistaken, he would deal with the consequences. He looked over to where Simon was manfully still trying to round up Molly and Mrs H,
Sherlock wondered if he was being teased but John had sat back, arms folded, with the air of having settled something.
“Do you know why Paul wouldn’t say why he argued with his father?” John asked, as Sherlock had told him.
“No you are.”
“No thank you.” Mycroft was polite but firm.
“I don’t think so, he has Dr Watson now, and humans have such little time… that’s why it is never wise to make friends with mortals, they always end up leaving you behind.”
Prone on the replacement couch, Sherlock had spent the last sixteen hours deep in his Mind Palace. He had spent most of that time raking over the old coals of the last six months and failing to reach any satisfactory conclusions about any number of problems that vexed him presently. The rest of the time he had slept.
A still smiling John Watson bids farewell to Mike Stamford, forever in his debt.
After they had finished and Lestrade had his paperwork signed he came back to where Sherlock was still crouching by the door. “Got anything for me?”
Lestrade had the grace to look embarrassed. “I’m sorry, I suppose I assume people will be shocked.”
“Night then.”
Sherlock pressed send and waited. He wondered if John had gone back to sleep but concluded that having sent such an important text, John would have stayed awake for the reply, however long it took. Sure enough, there was the sound of a faint rustling from upstairs and then the soft pad of footsteps on the stairs leading from the second floor.
Sherlock who was beginning to grow impatient, wanted to wrap the whole thing up.
“Good, she deserves everything that’s coming to her.”
Aziraphale clocked that John was watching them intently and was tempted to kiss Sherlock goodbye but instead he turned to the doctor and said, “Do enjoy your dancing lesson, Dr Watson, I hope I haven’t worn him out for you.”
Sherlock tolerated the other parents by maintaining a safe distance from their chatter but had recently deduced that Melanie, a newcomer to the group, kept an urban hive on her roof terrace, and this had improved his trips to stay and play considerably. Plus, the church served proper coffee and handmade biscuits.
, Sherlock thought, he could hardly wait to tell John about it.
John tracked Sherlock down to the kitchen, he noticed that the Tesco delivery had arrived while he was out but hadn’t been put away, somethings didn’t change after all. Sherlock was standing by the stove, wearing his safety goggles and hazmat gloves holding a thermometer in one hand and a pipette in the other as he slowly added orange juice to a pan of simmering red wine; the air was fragrant with the smell of cinnamon, cloves and star anise.
“Register, Smegister, that wasn’t the genuine article either, Mycroft got it mocked up by someone in his department. As it turned out it wasn’t necessary, due to Dieter Schäfer.”
Rosie, significantly happier now she was the proud owner of a new tooth, babbled enthusiastically, “bubububub!”
“Merry Christmas, Sherlock Holmes” John whispered pulling his fiancé closer.
The school kitchen had obviously raided the boys’ supper things to provide a meal at such short notice, there were fish fingers, chips and peas followed by jam roly-poly and custard, it was all extremely comforting.
“Whatever it is spit it out”
R Hilton-Cubitt
“And what about over there?”, Sherlock swung his torch to show a stile and a gap in the hedge opposite.
Sherlock suspected he might have deleted them earlier than that but said nothing, not when everything was going so well.
Mycroft had gone ahead, after the initial debrief, leaving Sherlock to be patched up in a military hospital in Dusseldorf before being put on the army aircraft to England. It had been a perfunctory job, a few stitches here and there, a couple of blood tests but generally Sherlock was in better shape than anyone who had endured what he had, had the right to be, and could be treated with antibiotics and some mild painkillers and then sent on his way. Sherlock was not inclined to protest; he was bone weary and just wanted it all to be over.
Turning to the consulting criminal, Crowley reared up and grabbed him by the neck, “I could make things very unpleasant for you, no more designer suits and solitary confinement, I could get you moved to the pits. Does that jog your memory?”
A big shout out to MissDavis for a great set of prompts, I'm off to do my Christmas shopping, cooking , housework and all the things I haven't got done while this fic has taken over my life.
“Do you have a chitty?” The demon asked.
“It may have escaped your notice John, but we don’t have a cat”
“No, it isn’t.”
******
John broke into the widest of smiles, gathered his Sherlock in his arms and proceeded to show him just how it was done.
Mary let him guide her over to a far wall where there was a full-length standing mirror. Mary was stood in front of it, admiring the flowers when a man came into view behind her and a voice said.
“How would she know? Mary described her day, every afternoon at four-thirty she takes the manuscript she has typed earlier to Mrs Etherege’s for correction. That gives Mrs Windibank the best part of an hour to type the letter and envelope. The next day, James Windibank goes out to wherever the PO Box is situated, posts the letter and collects those that Mary has sent to her phantom lover. He hands Mary’s letters to Mrs Etherege so she can frame a reply. Mary’s eyesight is bad, she’s unlikely to notice the similarities between the typeface, and even if she did, she would most likely take this as another indication of the total compatibility between herself and Ian Moody. The whole thing is well executed and thoroughly unpleasant.”
John explains, he explains again, he gets Harry to write it down and read it back to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Then John asked again, “Are you called Tom?”, and his Sweetie groaned again, and said, “boring! I thought we had agreed to stop this?”
Sherlock conceded defeat in regard to the interview and turned to speculating as to whether there was some possibility of blackmailing Mycroft into exerting his influence over the Hospital Trust. But even if he scuppered John’s chances with this particular post there would be other jobs, and he ran the risk that John might eventually be forced to look further afield, to countries beyond Mycroft’s jurisdiction. That didn’t bear thinking about.
He’d emerged from the basement flat, to find Madhu and his brother, Mr Chatterjee’s boys wrestling a large fir tree up the stairs to flat b. Sherlock eyed them warily, he hadn’t forgotten and certainly not forgiven their manhandling him into the boot of the Aston, although as they were fully occupied with the tree he decided he was relatively safe. From the landing Mrs Hudson was barking out instructions like a Sergeant Major, while Mark, one of the married ones, flitted around Sherlock’s sitting room with the decorations.
“You don’t have a girlfriend, then?”
John smiled at him, sadly, “I’ve watched you Sherlock, with Mary Sutherland, Ruth, with the people in the restaurant, even with me. Everything you deduce is measured and orderly, ‘I know this because of this’ you’ll say, ‘your clothes tell me this about your upbringing, your hair reveals this about your work’. You don’t throw random prophesies like hand grenades and step back and watch the explosion.
Sherlock indicated the table opposite where a party of three, a pretty fair haired woman of around forty-five, a thick set sandy haired man in his late thirties and a sallow dark-haired youth of no more than twenty were enjoying a meal and what appeared to be rather stilted conversation. The woman was doing a sterling job in trying to keep the conversation going but as soon as she relaxed her efforts silence reigned.
“If I looked terrified it was because of the strength of my feelings… the moment we met I knew I never wanted you to go anywhere without me at your side.”
Sherlock bristled, “I wouldn’t say your track record was any better.”
“What do you mean?”
“Doctor Watson!” The voice came from a ginger haired youth who began scrambling up the hillside towards him.
Unst is the northernmost inhabited island of the British Isles, the rest of the list is fiction until number 11.
“Excellent! This is far the most important of all for our purpose. It gives me hope. Now, Mr Hilton-Cubitt, please continue your most interesting story.”
“What happened after that?”
“Not here, not now. When this is over.”
“I am a servant of Her Majesty’s government of which His Grace the Duke of Holderness is a member, it is naturally a concern of mine.”
Sherlock was vexed. He had been convinced that John had trailed whatever vehicle had taken Arthur away, but it was impossible. John would not have kept up with a car and he said so. Danny agreed, “I should have hung on, you could have towed me.”
“Don’t be obvious” Sherlock snarls.
He started to recite a litany of flower names, some she recognised, chrysanthemums and dahlias, and some she didn’t, bouvardia and gypsophila. He seemed very keen on begonias, cyclamen and mock orange blossom and suggested a Biedermeier bouquet. Mary had no idea what one of those was and said so. Mr Fell produced one and held it out to her; even though the bouquet was made of silk roses it looked stunning.
“I didn’t understand at first; I know how you love to play games, and you are often cruel.  But I know you well enough to recognise when something isn’t right. I could tell by your voice.
John dozed on and off for an hour or so before getting up, he had an unpleasantly cold wash, before heading down to the restaurant for breakfast. Looking out of the windows he could see where the snow had drifted against the walls of the hotel, it looked pretty deep in places.
Mary, handed the phone by Wiggins finds her way into the empty house at Leinster Gardens. Unaccustomedly disconcerted by the projection of her face on the building’s façade, which despite the wedding finery, seems naked, exposed.
Gingerly, conscious of his head injury, John sat up. There was possibly room above his head to stand but he wasn’t quite up to that. He stretched out his left arm and touched nothing, then did the same with the right and saw a faint green light. His watch! He tapped it until it revealed the time, 9.39. John rubbed his hand across his face again, from his stubble he was almost certain that it was the evening, rather than the following day.
“Rosie adores you. You’re a good parent. You know this; you know this to be true. We’d both be lost without you… Sherlock…BREATHE!”
“No matter…” Sherlock said quickly, “Very good, Mr Fell, you intrigue me. I will help you recover your trinket.”
Sherlock didn’t bother to ask what he meant and John went on, “That’s interesting,” John had clicked back to the Wikipedia page on Patrick Hilton, “According to this Erasmus Hilton, is an elder in this church, that’s got to be Patrick’s dad.”
“It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Mrs H.”
The lights go on – everyone is there – Hudders and Mr Chatterjee
The consultation finished, Bill went out and the youngest of the men came in, paid his fee and gave his name as Chris. A bigger contrast to Bill, Sherlock could not have wished for. Chris looked like a soldier (hair cut with military precision even when on leave), he stood like a soldier too, (always on parade), but Sherlock knew that this man, in his heart was not one.
******
Sherlock heated up one of the tins of soup from John’s store cupboard and made tea for them both. Sherlock found these small domestic activities, which he had so studiously avoided during his tenure as John’s flatmate, remarkably therapeutic. It was something practical he could do for John, and kept his hands occupied, without which he might have been tempted to continually touch John to reassure himself that his friend was truly there with him. It was only now John was found that Sherlock was able to admit to himself just how afraid he had been.
He produced a pound coin from his pocket and handed it to Aziraphale, it was a concession guaranteed to cheer the angel up, but not today.
Sherlock wasn’t sure if he was glad or sad that he had missed John’s visit, on balance he decided it was for the best although John’s knowledge of American fiction might have come in handy with the Hilton-Cubitt case.
Sherlock slowly gathered his wits, locked the door and turned the sign to closed. He went through to the back, shed the cloak he wore as The Great Nostradamo, peeled off the wig and the goatee beard and lay down on the bunk, taking up his preferred thinking position.
“Flat B just isn’t big enough, Greg, not for the three of us. Rosie comes with a lot of baggage for such a small person, and for someone who lost most of their possessions eighteen months ago Sherlock’s not been slow in making up lost ground. I’m sharing a bedroom with my two-year-old daughter, who just so happens to sleep like a cat. We none of us have enough space. If Sherlock and I were sharing a room, then maybe we might have managed… but if that isn’t going to happen then I need to find somewhere bigger for the two of us, and I need to do that before Rosie gets even more attached to Sherlock than she is now.”
The best thing about a car sent by Mycroft was that his driver knew every short cut in London and the journey always gave Sherlock the opportunity to refresh his memory of some of the less familiar byways.
Reaching the corner of his road, John spotted the figure in black, folded up like a deck chair on his doorstep, and had the advantage of Sherlock who had been expecting him to come the other way. It gave John a momentary respite to prepare for their encounter before Sherlock saw him.
"Well, Sherlock’s the expert.”
“That’s only the half of it. I’m back to the old problem about what I can afford on my army pension and what I can earn at the clinic, and whether that’s a place you want to bring up a child in. That knocks out most of London.”
“He had a past, but what gay man in his thirties doesn’t have? He was quite up front about that. I remember his words – Richard, he said, I have had some very disagreeable associations in my life; I wish to forget all about them. I would rather never allude to the past, as it is very painful. If you marry me, you will marry a man who has nothing that he need be personally ashamed of; but you will have to be content with my word for it, and to allow me to be silent as to all that passed up to the time we met. If these conditions are too hard, then I will go back to France and the lonely life in which you found me – It was the very day before our wedding that he said those words to me. I told him that I was content to marry him on his own terms, and I have been as good as my word.
Sam had breached the sanctity of John’s consulting room just as his morning surgery was finishing. She did, as she reminds him, knock.
Harry stares at her phone, she feels a louse. She’s let her brother down, she’s let Clara down and she’s let herself down. This has got to stop.
It was an unremarkable tie, probably bought by the wearer’s mother in an attempt to smarten the boy up for his first day at work. The tie had apparently been worn five days a week for at least two years and now sported a number of stains, Red Bull, marinara and chilli sauce amongst others, from take-aways eaten distractedly while still at his desk using his left, non-dominant hand, while the right remained firmly attached to the computer mouse and his eyes never left the screen.
And with a wave and a wink he vanishes.
“Seemed safer, with you being married to your work… I’m not gay, Sherlock, not as such, but you probably could call me bisexual”
“Really?” Sherlock could not keep the shock from his voice. “Sentiment? At your time of life?”
The moment he walked into the foyer of the Savoy Hotel John realised he had made a mistake by not going home to change before his appointment. Not that there was anything intrinsically wrong with John’s perfectly serviceable jacket and trousers he wore for work most days, but they were old, and the smell of the surgery lingered, and to top it all, his shirt had come off worse that morning during a close encounter with a five-year-old with suspected tonsillitis. He felt distinctly shabby and out of place in the magnificence of the Savoy.
Sherlock point blank refuses. “My work is in London”
“After Eddie came out to his folks he went to New York, like I said he had some money from a book he’d sold and these people wanted him to write some more. The Hiltons didn’t cut him off but I guess they didn’t talk that much about him either, not to me anyways. It wasn’t until he’d gotten wed that I was able to pin down even what continent he was on. I wrote to him but got no answer. Then I had a chance to come over, for a conference and I told my wife I’d take a bit of a tour before coming back. I found  a room at Elrige’s on the net, I could see it was close enough by to use as a base to get near to Eddie; so I got in touch, I left the messages where he could read them. I just thought if I could speak to him, could remind him of the bond we had between us then he would come home with me, instead he begged me to go away and leave them in peace.”
Inspector Martin had the good sense to allow Sherlock a free hand, and contented himself with carefully noting the results. Another uniformed officer had spoken at length with one of the paramedics and she reported that while Patrick Hilton-Cubitt’s injuries were serious, they had no idea if they would prove fatal. The bullet had passed through the front of his brain, but the fact it had not killed him outright meant there was still hope. On the question of whether he had been shot or had shot himself the paramedic wouldn’t say. Certainly it appeared that the bullet had been discharged at very close quarters. There was only the one pistol found in the room, two barrels of which had been emptied. Richard Hilton-Cubitt had been shot through the heart. It was equally conceivable that he had shot Patrick and then himself, or that Patrick had been the instigator, as the revolver lay upon the ﬂoor midway between them.
He turned to his uncle for confirmation.
Shout Out to Ariane DeVere and the episode transcripts for John's confession in this one.
Sherlock swivel the monitor a little so that John could read the screen. It was a notice from The Times dated 21
“But with Sherlock away, and Dr Watson completely bereft, this woman had a chance to become a permanent fixture.”
, John reflected,
Sherlock surmised that five thirty in the morning was not too early to telephone a countryman like Debbie’s brother Steve. He also surmised that his sister would have told him to expect a call. He was correct on both counts.
“Miss Sutherland,” John explained, “If he had been anything other, would you have continued the correspondence?”
I haven't watched much of the Granada Sherlock so when I did watch this the other day I was a bit miffed with some of the similarities with the form this fic was taking.
When he got back, John’s bedroom was in darkness and his breathing indicated that he was asleep.
John had a sudden sensation that he might cry, ridiculous, but he never coped with kindness well. “It’s good of you to offer,” he said finally, “But I don’t think I would be very welcome.”
They took the lift to the third floor where the Inspector was waiting for them, looking rather apprehensively at Sherlock as if in anticipation of some scathing comment from the detective.
"No."
A short angry man, he noted at once, sturdy, compact rather than fat, even so the newcomer filled the room… but before Sherlock could take a name or give his usual client spiel, before he could even name his fee… words burst from him.
“Mrs Hudson, you are very dear to me, and for that reason alone I am prepared to participate in a palpably pagan ritual usurped by the Christian church in commemoration of the purported birth of a Judean insurrectionist of the first century C.E. But as for making a wish, I refuse to contemplate a gesture even more futile than offering prayers to the deity the birth of whose alleged son started the whole circus in the first place.”
“Here,” Sherlock pushed his papers towards his friend, “You have the key, work it out for yourself. I’m going outside.”
John bit his tongue, he had a fair idea who had been responsible for Dinah being out.
“Mrs H says you have a case on?”
Sherlock paused for effect. “He has a likeness to his father.”
Aziraphale snuggled a little closer to the demon, it really was quite pleasant under Crowley’s wing, despite the faintly lingering smell of sulphur.
It wouldn’t be long, Rosie’s vocabulary increased daily, there was the
“Don’t eat the sweets!”
He rings for the messenger and sends a card, partakes of elevenses, then luncheon in the hour before his visitor arrives.
Summer holidays gave people space to contemplate the future and dwell on the past, and while Sherlock might complain to himself of the trivial nature of their questions he was mostly satisfied with the accuracy of his deductions. But between readings and occasionally during, Sherlock’s mind wandered to the soldier of the evening before. He silently berated himself, while listing all the things he should have deduced about the man…
On the back seat of the car, Sherlock held out his hand to reveal the emerald brooch. Ralph went into raptures, both over the jewel and Sherlock’s ingenuity in securing its return.
“You don’t even like women!” John was irrational in his anger, it was no longer red but burning white inside him, it was all he could do to stop himself shaking.
Sherlock bowed his head slightly in acknowledgment of this largess.
“Not that I am aware, we restrict the younger boys’ access to their devices,” Dr Huxtable enunciated the word in a way that dripped distain, “we don’t allow unsupervised use.”
Greg’s plane touched down at Heathrow Airport just before one o’clock on Saturday lunchtime, he looked out onto the grey, wet tarmac and thought that he had never been so glad to see anywhere as London, for all her dismal winter plumage.
“Tell me about him, you must have got to know him better now?”
Mary had arranged to meet Antonia at her friend’s florist shop, she was a little wary, she’d never noticed a florist in this part of town before, but then she supposed she had never been one for buying flowers before.
Greg feigned innocence “How’s what going?”
Sherlock looked relieved, turned off the gas, and said “I will leave it to marinade and heat it again later before our guests arrive. There is so much to do.” He looked beyond John, “Where’s Watson?”
Satisfied that this was one thing he could cross off his list, John sent Greg a text to let him know (he had given up trying to call Greg, the phone always went unanswered, and even his emails were bouncing back). Then John made his way home, taking a short detour to collect Rosie from the nursery.
“Not that it would make any difference to the London crime rate if you were.”
He looked at his watch again and calculated that he had now been trying to find his way out of the cave for forty-eight hours and the sense of panic welled up in him again,
“Amazing”
To the untrained eye Mycroft Holmes would have appeared no different to how he usually looked, but Sherlock wasn’t fooled. Although, unlike on the occasion of his visit to Baker Street, Mycroft was impeccably turned out, there were deep shadows under his eyes and his suit hung loosely on his frame.
“Don’t say there is something you haven’t told me.”
It worked; the Duke inclined his head.
It is worse than Mycroft feared, drastic action is required. Within minutes of leaving the flat, Mycroft is speaking to his assistant, “Operation De Quincey is Go!”
“And the new will is the one that was current at the time of her death?”
Which is how, Dr John Watson, RAMC, 5th Northumberland Fusiliers, came to spend his last night before deployment… in a gay bar.
******
“Boring!”
Sherlock bit into the pastry anyway. “Ow!”
John continued “I suppose you have googled him, he’s probably got a website, or if not I expect his publisher will have a page, or Amazon, or Wikipedia.”
But Sherlock was minding Watson today, he couldn’t leave the flat without her, and he could hardly impede John’s journey in disguise with the man’s own daughter in tow.
Sherlock thought, before groaning at the appalling sentimentality of the thought and getting up to take full advantage of the luxurious shower.
“I don’t understand what’s come over you this last couple of weeks, you’ve no interest in cases, you’ve neglected your experiments, abandoned your old haunts. You spend all your time with this woman who, frankly, has a very chequered past, and what’s more is engaged to one of your only friends. Where were you? Out on her hen night?”
“I don’t know about you but I am ready for bed. I don’t expect madam will give us much of a lie in tomorrow.”
Sherlock is keeping busy.
Sherlock shook is head annoyed with himself, when he looked up he caught Molly staring at him intently.
“According to her solicitor Mrs Flugrath visited him on Tuesday 21st May 2002 at nine in the morning and insisted he draw up a new will immediately. It seems that she was an important and somewhat imperious client of the firm and not to be kept waiting. He drew up the will according to her instructions and she returned that afternoon at two-thirty to sign it.”
Mrs Hudson laughed at that.
Sherlock studied it quickly and seemed to grasp its meaning without difficulty.
“I could really eat something.”
A Private Airfield - Early January
Still Mary had been friendly enough, and invited Antonia to join them for a curry after Pilates on Monday night. So, the evening had not been entirely wasted.
The expression on John’s face was most gratifying, Aziraphale reflected as he made his way down the stairs and out into Baker Street, if looks could kill he would be most inconveniently discorporated, perhaps this plan of Crowley’s would work after all. It was certainly the most fun out of all the suggestions, he was having a great time with all the ‘dates’ he and Sherlock had been on, it was lovely to have someone to share these experiences with.
Sherlock could instantly see why his landlady had been so excited by Dr Huxtable name dropping the missing boy’s famous parents. She was a devotee of the gossip columns and reality television and the Duke of Holderness and his Duchess were regulars in the tabloids. He had already gleaned as much as he could from the Duke’s Wikipedia page while still at Baker Street, now he settled down to peruse the more salacious entries of the red tops. There was little of interest about the Duke who it seemed tried (although not always successfully) to keep a low profile in the press; the coverage tended to be of various charitable events and country pursuits. There were some photographs, from which Sherlock could see the Duke was a handsome, patrician man in his mid-fifties. The most interesting thing about him, apart from his title and estates, was his marriage. Not only had his choice of bride been considered rather eccentric but the Duke had been almost forty when he married, an event which took place about a year after his younger brother had died in a caving accident. There appeared to be no suspicious circumstances regarding the brother’s death, his interest in extreme sports was well known, and as it was over twenty years ago, Sherlock dismissed this from having any bearing on the present case. Although reading between the lines it appeared that it had been the loss of his heir that had prompted the Duke to marry, and while nothing was said overtly, the prime motivation was generally implied as the need to reproduce.
Computer programmer then, or rather, software engineer.
“You, of all people Mycroft, should have known, my loyalty to the Crown has always been without question, even when Magnussen was blackmailing my husband I never wavered. You should have seen that I was above suspicion, you should have seen it!”
Dear Mr Holmes,
“Oh, yes – we meet up every Friday for fish and chips.”
“Then suddenly, as he was speaking his face turned white and his hand gripped my shoulder. Something was moving in the shadow of the barn. I saw a dark, creeping ﬁgure which crawled round the corner and squatted in front of the door. Grabbing my pistol I started out, but Patrick threw his arms round me and held me with all his strength. I tried to throw him off, but he clung to me almost desperately. At last I got clear, but by the time I had opened the door and reached the barn the creature was gone. It was the very person I was looking for though because the same drawing of dancing men which I had seen twice already was on the barn door. There was no sign of the man anywhere, though I ran all over the grounds. And yet the amazing thing is that he must have been there all the time, because when I examined the door again just now he had scrawled some more of his pictures under the line which I had already seen.”
Just over six months after Sherlock’s death, John Watson received a letter from a solicitor informing him that his late friend had left his money to his flatmate.  Sherlock having predeceased both his brother and his parents had not died a wealthy man; his material possessions had apparently been bequeathed to Mycroft, but the letter contained a cheque for £9456.32. John tore both the letter and the cheque into tiny pieces before flushing them down the toilet and drinking himself senseless. Eight weeks later, the exact same sum appeared in his bank account. This legacy, plus his small army pension allowed John a to drift a while longer, without addressing the matter of his future.
“DI Martin from Norwich is on his way Sir, we are expecting him shortly.”
“Woo-Hoo!”
“But you are distracting me… I came to Wilvercombe in search of my fiancé and had hoped to find him here, but…” She broke off with a sob and took a hanky from her sleeve and dabbed her eyes.
This had to be the worst assignment of his life, not even taking into consideration that he was getting married in eight days’ time and he should be out with the guys from his division making the most of his last few days of freedom, instead he was marooned on an island that wasn’t even in the middle of nowhere, it was on the chuffing far edge of nowhere. Without a mobile signal 90% of the time to add insult to the injury.
“Ah Gervais, we have come to wish you joy.”
“Don’t bother waiting up tonight, it will be a late one… I hope.”
“Then go to Florida yourself”
“The frosted ones.” Sherlock replied automatically.
“Who has?” John asked.
Mycroft caved. The caller rang off still laughing.
“Whoa!” John swiftly moved round the other side of the bed and went to help his friend, supporting him with one arm while Mrs Hudson fussed with the pillows behind him.
Another long one.
Apparently impervious to John’s discomfort, Sherlock and Mary spent a little while longer over the table plan before moving on to the food and wine for the reception, from there they discussed cake, the DJ, the first dance and the evening do. John, who had gone back to his phone, ostensibly to check how their wedding budget was going, tuned out their conversation as he tried to get to grips with the fact that Sherlock had a plus one… that is… a boyfriend… that is… was gay.
Then it was just the two of them, him and Sherlock, waiting for their cab.
Crowley had the sneaky feeling that Aziraphale would not entirely approve of the plan that was slowly forming in his mind, so he quickly changed the subject by suggesting they stop for lunch.
Martha Hudson although of mature years, is further from being a sweet old lady than her predicament is from missing felines.
“Am I ever going to be happy?”
******
John might have thought so once, but in truth the jury was still out.
Sherlock held out his hands in an empty gesture.
“Gavin, it’s going to be tight, but he should reach London in time. The wedding is back on.”
The night porter’s command of English had had a sudden resurgence after Sherlock had informed him, in his own language, that the police were less likely to concern themselves with his immigration status if he sounded as if he was born and brought up in Tooting.
What was wrong with a good old fashioned English name like Ralph? Then there was the case, that was the sort of trivial problem that Sherlock wouldn’t sully his mind palace with, even in acute boredom. Missing jewels indeed? Next people would be expecting the detective to look for lost cats. John had fully expected Sherlock to send Mr Fell away with a couple of scathing deductions and a flea in his ear.
“Wouldn’t you know it.”
Sherlock blushed, and John kissed him again.
“Don’t start without me.” John said, abandoning the paper and getting up out of his chair.
Either way, John thinks, the detective has made a mistake that will cost him, cost them all, dearly.
“Dinah?”
In the strangers’ room, his visitor seemed to have made himself quite at home, sipping at a glass of some vile looking green liquid. As Mycroft entered the room Aziraphale stood up and could not resist uttering the immortal words.
Sherlock braced himself for the blow, but it never came. Instead the man turned and with the parting shot of “Well fuck you…” strode out of the cabin slamming the door behind him. The whole cabin, not the most robust of buildings, shook but Sherlock paid no attention. Outside he heard the words “fucking charlatan” and the sound of voices fading as the three men departed down the street.
Association, of the sort John has in mind with Ben, although now perfectly legal, is not exactly facilitated by the army. While entitled to some privileges due to his officer status, John in fact shares a billet with another doctor on his rotation and privacy, difficult to come by at the best of times, is almost impossible to achieve.
“You first…”
“What one can invent another can discover,” Sherlock replied with a hint of his old arrogance. “Mr Garvey, whatever you say about your part in this night’s events cannot change the fact that a man has died and another is fighting for his life. The police are going to formally arrest you and take to Norwich to be charged. Once you are there anything you say will be taken down and may be used in evidence against you. If there is anything that might help us to understand what happened here tonight you may want to share it now before you are under caution.”
“Outside?” John said in surprise, “Whatever for?”
“Neither did I,” Crowley admitted, “but then I don’t think I have been surrounded by so many flowers since… well, you know… since then.”
“Is this the palace thing?”
(See the end of the chapter for
On top of that, it didn’t even seem much of an assignment. Yes, there were bodies, or at least the remains of bodies. A comprehensive assortment of bones that certainly looked human, but where they had come from and how long they had been there was a mystery. Lestrade thought longingly of Molly Hooper who could tell at a glance that a skeleton was less than six months old. He couldn’t pin the bloke here down to a century.
“Isn’t that what you people do?”
Resigned, Sherlock made a show of examining the man’s palm.
“Well I have been applying that philosophy to our conversation of Monday.”
“Sherlock, there must be something you would like, how about a nice locked room murder?”
“Her shoes?”
“They’ll be looking for James then, heaven hope they find him, ‘t’is not a night to be out on the moors.”
“John! Johnny, having fun are we?”
John smelt a rat, picked up his mobile phone and dialed the number he was given some three years earlier, on a different danger night. He didn’t know if the number was still valid, but it turned out that it was. He downed the rest of his scotch, put on his coat, locked up the half empty flat, and went outside to await the arrival of the car.
“Marriage though.” Sherlock wondered aloud, that was a very drastic step.
“Be your own man… follow your heart, choose your own path. Go if you want to go, but for your own sake, not anyone else.”
“Gone to the casino.”
******
Greg has a special request of John
There was no mistake, John had called him sweetheart. John had asked him when he was going to divorce his work, referencing their first meal together.  After all these years. John had asked him to marry him.
Except it wasn’t Sherlock. True, he was dressed in a bespoke suit and along black coat that covered his tall, sparce frame and what John could see of his face revealed its fine bone structure, but while the hands holding the newspaper were blessed with long, elegant fingers they weren’t quite Sherlock’s. Initially the man’s hair appeared as dark as Sherlock’s although longer and straighter, John could see the way the fluorescent light in the carriage brought out the red in it. He held himself all wrong too, while Sherlock had an animal grace, this man was more sinuous than feline.
Antonia was forming her own assessment. Since Thursday Crowley had worked harder than he had in years. The requested file from head office had arrived, it showed that Mary Morstan had died thirty-five years earlier only to come to life again thirty-three years later. The sweet little one that had been Mary Elizabeth Morstan, had gone straight upstairs so there was little information about her, but she certainly wasn’t the woman who was now sat in front of him.
Sherlock filled John on his post university life including the trial of Terry Kirk, but omitting the drugs and the unhappy love affair before concluding, “I don’t have your determination to follow a direct path, mine meanders all over the place, to the concern of the parents and the bossy interference of the brother.”
“Is about the Bluebird Hotel?”
This was a bowl of a light brown mixture with various dried fruits peeking out of the mess, stood on the kitchen table.
“Three demi Coupés with arm movements, once forwards, once back, that’s right.” Aziraphale commanded Sherlock. “Open pas de bourrée to the right… excellent, now to the left… dessus, dessous…”
It had been reasonably pleasant afternoon when they had left London but by the time the train reached Reading the skies had turned grey and it was raining. The train was quiet, Sherlock was busy on his laptop, no doubt investigating everything he could find about the death of André Cloete.  Molly had tracked down the autopsy report for Sherlock who had forwarded it to John who was reading it with interest, it appeared that the deceased had been struck from behind.
November…”
“You know you say that out loud”
John nodded, that made a kind of sense. He knew that Sherlock was still tempted to fall into his old habits and had a supply of patches in the bathroom cabinet of the flat. But John also knew that Sherlock had been scrupulous about not smoking or indulging in any prohibited substances since he and Rosie had moved back to Baker Street.
, he thought as he let the dark chocolaty sweetness melt on his tongue, one eye on the film as he turned his attention to seventeen down.
“Because I am going to get dressed and then I am going to put as much distance between us as possible until I calm down or forget this conversation has taken place, whichever is soonest”
Sherlock sat up. “About that...”
*****
“We don’t have a house either I’m improvising”
“I rather think that was your job, brother mine.”
“There are lots of things you need forgiveness for Sherlock… forget tea, there’s some whisky in the cupboard in my study, let’s have some of that.”
“John, I need to see him”
Time went on, she had begun to hear rumours, that Moriarty was dead, that Sherlock had killed him before he killed himself; that Mycroft Holmes had had him killed in revenge for his brother’s death; that he had killed himself in a fit of pique once his greatest adversary was no more. Mary was sceptical, she was working at the surgery by this time, her nursing qualifications were genuine, even if her certificates were forged; it put her in the perfect place to keep an eye on John Watson.
Sherlock looked over to John who answered the man “Tragically it is true.”
Crowley scowled at the generator and it sprang into life. He glanced at his angel’s despondent face and felt the urge to do something about it.
“What made you so sure then that Mr Cloete was talking to Paul?” Sherlock asked.
The weather was suddenly unseasonably warm and one afternoon John took the first-year boys out into the grounds ostensibly to learn the difference between deciduous and evergreen trees but really to enjoy the late sunshine while collecting conkers. As John sat the class down on the grass to draw the skeletal horse chestnut leaves, a hundred and fifty miles away a military aircraft touched down at Brize Norton.
“Interesting, are all the floors like that?”
Until then it’s back to business.
Turning his days’ takings into coins Sherlock played the slots for the best part of an hour while occasionally taking a sip of his beer and all the time keeping a close eye on the soldiers. It was mainly Bill and Chris who played, their friend preferring to watch, nursing his own drink and commentating on the players performance.
“Would you…”
“Well Irene Adler offered it to you on a plate, I expect there have been plenty of women… and men who have done the same. But you’ve never…”
“Have you tried phoning again?”
“Someone else?”
Disappointed Sherlock threw the paper onto the table. This was no insight into John’s mental state merely a clue from the cryptic crossword which John had been attempting to decipher last night.
“Exactly so, and this five letter word below, which I believe to have been written by Patrick himself is his reply. Something E, Something E, Something. Of course, it is NEVER!”
“I understand that it is something of whirlwind affair.”
“In that case I should be glad to hear the evidence and to examine the premises without an instant of unnecessary delay.”
If she were being romantic, she would have said her life had changed when she met John Watson, if she were being honest, she would have said it all changed when Jim Moriarty died.
It took a while for Sherlock to understand that he had made a serious error of judgement.
John walked over to the table and picked up the next card, it was of ivory heavyweight card, embossed in silver, and written in a flamboyant italic script in violet ink. John could only just make out the name, but he recognised it immediately.
Sherlock was ready with his answer. “That is simply untrue, you yourself have endless harped on about how affected I was by my association with The Woman. It’s not so long ago that you were encouraging me to take that relationship further, ‘it would complete me as a human being’ were the words you used if I recall correctly.”
John threw another log on the fire. He checked it first, Sherlock had some kind of experiment going with the woodpile outside the back door. After John had accidentally incinerated a vital specimen a few weeks back during the sudden cold snap, and had been subjected to harsh words and reproachful looks for almost a week, he had insisted that the detective mark all logs available for burning with a splash of white paint. So far, the system was working.
Dinah frowned, “but I thought you knew, I thought everyone knew, he was killed on our wedding night.”
*if you want peace, prepare for war
“Paul told me that his father greeted him warmly but then told him to be on his way as he was due to meet someone. Paul thought it odd and said so. At that point, his father started to argue with him, and as a final blow suggested that instead of hanging round the farm, he should make the most of his unexpected visit home to settle things with Alice. Paul took objection to this and stormed off, intending to head home as he had lost his appetite for the walk, and for taking shots at the bunnies in the woods.
“Significant what?”
“And you invaded Afghanistan,” the stranger replied.
At that moment John’s phone buzzed, he took it out of his pocket and read the incoming message.
Crowley, at the wheel of the Bentley, pulled slowly out of the carpark of the Boscombe Valley Hotel, a sadly disappointed angel slumped in the passenger seat beside him. He turned the car in the direction of motorway and London, the thick carpet of snow melting before them. Two miles out of the village there was no snow at all.
“Goliath’s gate,” Steve pointed ahead, effectively changing the subject. “I would guess it gets its name due to its height, a giant wouldn’t need to duck his head. It’s like this for the first fifty metres or so before it drops down.”
“Shouldn’t you be working this afternoon?”
The context of the discovery contributed nothing to the case except to confirm that the originator must at least be temporarily resident in the area, so Sherlock quickly opened the attachment. It contained a further nine stick men and he was pleased to see that three of these were new. This meant he could now presume that he had fifteen letters which, particularly if you also excluded Q and Z, was nearly two thirds of the alphabet.
The autumn term began in early September. The weather was still fine, although John could detect a slight nip in the air in the mornings as he crossed the quad from his quarters to the dining room, and he observed a scattering of russet amid the green leaves of the surrounding trees. The new term brought a fresh crop of boys to the school. John was not fazed by these little princes, the one whose mother was a super model, or whose father played for Chelsea (although overall the parents were mainly bankers or politicians of the Sebastian Wilkes type). There was one boy, however, who elicited a special kind of deference from Dr Huxtable. John observed him too, a slender, quiet boy, small for his age, with a mop of curly dark hair and a thoughtful expression that caused John to reflect that he had never once seen a photograph of Sherlock as a child.
Mission accomplished and back in his room, he secreted the gun about his person and put the computer on to charge, he would break into that later.
Sherlock might have been about to say more but at that moment his mobile rang, he glanced at the display, smiled shyly and then said, “excuse me, I need to take this,” picking up the call. He disappeared into his bedroom and closed the door, but not before John heard the pleasant rumble of his laugh.
“I’m getting chest pains.”
“Weren’t there lots of brown things, full of sheets of paper and black squiggly lines?” Crowley asked, when he had recovered the ability to speak. “Or maybe they were red.”

“Yes, what other
He dreads the conversation and half hopes Molly isn’t in. He has some inkling of what he must have put her through, as he has come to realise, he’s not immune to unrequited love himself.
“Obviously, you are a demon it’s what you do.”
At that moment an unmarked police car arrived and a dapper little man, with a quick, alert manner and a neat moustache got out along with two SOCOs. A van pulled up behind them. The Inspector approached Sherlock, John and the uniformed officer at speed, not doubt in a hurry to discover what civilians were doing contaminating his crime scene. He was noticeably astonished when the officer introduced Sherlock and John.
“Fiancé!” John had to bite back exclaiming the word at a volume the whole restaurant would hear, “what makes you so sure?”
“The universe is rarely so lazy,” Sherlock murmured to himself before looking up and saying, “Unfortunately, John played into the hands of whoever took the boy by following them. He gifted them a perpetrator, someone from inside the school, for as long as he is missing no-one will really investigate who is really behind the kidnapping. Aside from me, that is…
******
Sherlock opened his eyes to see a pair of brilliant blue eyes looking down at him, concerned. Sherlock flicked his own eyes to the right. Nothing.
“Greg phoned, he’s on his way home.”
John wondered how Sherlock was getting on and turned to look at his companion just as he turned to look at him. Their eyes met, and it was a moment before John could look away, the back of his neck feeling hot. He coughed to hide his confusion; he had been exposed to far too much romantic drivel just by reading Hermione Etherege’s blurbs.
Mrs Hudson was persuade that that nice Mr Hilton-Cubitt was in danger and handed over the keys to the Aston Martin, but they then had to move the cot and the sleeping Rosie into 221a for the night which delayed them further and led John to reflect on how much their lives had changed.
The concert represented Sherlock’s last venture into the world of duets on and off stage, from that day on Sherlock was a confirmed soloist, in life as well as music.
John clicked on the link and was quiet as he browsed through its pages.
The seagulls were a nuisance though and Sherlock, who had soon had enough of defending his chips from the birds, began to think about returning to the cabin. It was in the evenings that he missed London most, spending the nights walking its streets, learning the city by heart. This reflection turned his thoughts again to Mary Sutherland; the only Lyon Place he knew of was just off Berkley Square, but it seemed unlikely that the family would occupy such a desirable address, not on their collective income.
“And what was your Aunt’s name?”
Magnussen however is delighted; whatever he holds on presidents and prime ministers is nothing to holding the freedom of Sherlock Holmes in the palm of his hand.
“I am.”
Sherlock gave up at half past six, locked the cabin door and put up the shutters, and went into the tiny bathroom to take a shower.
John reached the crossroads in good time, turned off his lights and waited. He was pretty certain he had beaten the pickup, and sure enough no more than five minutes later the truck came towards him, as it slowed down at the junction John impulsively grabbed hold of the tailgate and hung on for dear life with his right hand as he steered his bike with the left. As the truck accelerated, John’s cycle freewheeled alongside it, just out of sight in the darkness. John wondered how long he could keep it up, if his arm would be wrenched from its socket, or if his tyres would fail or his luck would run out some other way.
florist’s away from the diabolic flowers and their fiendish pollen. Aziraphale had considerately spirited away the worst offenders but Crowley’s eyes still stung, and he continued to feel that he was mere seconds away from another humungous sneeze.
He remained in his seat, there was no rush. After Dinah had finally returned his calls the evening before, only to inform him that the wedding was cancelled (or rather his wedding, apparently hers was still going ahead), the rest of his team had decided there was no need to join the desperate exodus out of Edinburgh but instead to wait for a flight the next morning. Decision made; they had dragged Greg to the nearest bar.
If it hadn’t been for the urgency of their mission John might have enjoyed the journey to Norfolk. Sherlock, when he put his mind to it, was an excellent driver, and it went without saying that the car was a dream, and Mrs Hudson had stored an eclectic selection of music to help to both pass the time and keep them awake. Even the sat nav was more than up to the job of negotiating the Norfolk B roads, accommodating a detour caused by localised flooding; still it was after three in the morning when they turned into the driveway of Ridling Thorpe Manor.
“Her fingerprints will be on the syringe; they may trace the box of sweets to her. Robert Beckworth’s parents have a dossier. I think there will be a case.”
More answering a question with a question.
Culverton Smith large as life and twice as ugly; the most compelling utterly repellent creature, an enigma, just not a very nice one. Relentlessly cheerful, the world is his playground and all the men and women merely players, acting out their parts for his gratification, or so it seems.
“Wait” Steve shouted, “Behind me. I know these caves and you don’t. We’ve nothing but torches so we’re not going in far. We’ll take a quick look round just in case they left your friend here.”
Sherlock focuses, he solves the case.
They sat down again while Mrs Hudson brought them more tea and tried, unsuccessfully, to induce Sherlock to eat a decent breakfast, he polished off the remaining biscuits instead. Sherlock deduced that Dr Huxtable was not entirely convinced of John’s innocence regarding his pupil’s disappearance but was reluctant express these concerns to the missing man’s friend. Sherlock used the time available to bombard the headmaster with questions. Dr Huxtable supplied the detective with as much information as he could recall (which Sherlock considered woefully inadequate) but he listened thoughtfully until they reached the part John’s bicycle had played.
They lie close but not touching, silent, each comforted by the presence of the other. Sherlock listens to John’s breathing; his own heart thumping, he imagines John’s might be the same. Rashly, (this night is extraordinary) Sherlock ventures to take hold of John’s wrist. Pulse raised!
“Shush”
The voice of Sherlock taunts her; she senses his presence seated somewhere in the shadows and scans the corridor for a faint outline. Sherlock Holmes… her friend… rival… nemesis. Which is it to be this night? She briefly regrets she didn’t finish him off when she had the chance.
Crowley jumped, “I might be able to help you there, friend of mine is a florist.”
“What?”
“And what action have the police taken?”
It's Sunday, it's cold, it's time to write casefic
“Pickup.” Danny interrupted.
John marvelled at Mycroft’s continued ability to make it appear that he had spies everywhere, even on the Derbyshire moors.
The villain springs from nowhere leaving John unconscious and bleeding. The rest of the yarders give chase while traumatised Sherlock cradles John and Lestrade secures an ambulance.
“Yes, you do, or rather her p.a. I’ve made a list for you of all the things that Dinah was taking care of… cars, licence… flowers, the wedding breakfast. I tried this morning, but I can’t get hold of anyone. You’ll have to go round to the Savoy… woah…” John put his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, just as the detective started to stand up., “After I’ve got back from the barbers.”
“You’re making this sound very personal.”
The equilibrium he had achieved, first at the school in Dorset and then at the Priory School deserted him, his limp became more pronounced and sleep eluded him. He was wary to check his private emails and put away his phone to avoid inadvertently answering a call from Mycroft, or Sherlock, or perhaps worst of all, the press. The images of the blood splattered pavement returned vividly and without warning and not just when he closed his eyes. It seemed crueller now, the suicide that Sherlock had forced him to witness, crueller because it hadn’t been real.
Goodness, Sherlock thought, having read the words through twice for the sheer awfulness to sink in, what on earth was John doing copying out doggerel like this? Was the writer planning on splitting himself in half so that he drowned in both pools at once? Sherlock couldn’t see how John’s previous experience of pools would be anything he would be keen to revisit. As for kissing for eternity, well the average human being was able to hold their breath comfortably for little over 60 seconds, while he had trained himself to hold his breath for several minutes that was at the peak of his fitness and he was by no means certain that John could do anything similar. No the whole thing was nasty, sentimental gibberish.
“I was never in danger, John.”
“Quite all right thank-you.”
John stood back and admired his friend, lovingly tending his collection of mouldy logs, which, in the wintry half-light, looked as if they were covered with fluffy white blankets.
Sherlock recognised,
Mycroft decided that politeness could take a hike. “I refuse to be coerced into making a decision at this time.”
“Different times, Sherlock, different times”
“But you only just arrived” Aziraphale protested.
“Here he is, Patrick Hilton, born Edmund Patrick Hilton, 12
“Ok, leave it,” John said, able to tell now what was real and what was dramatics. “Tell me about yourself. I can’t do the observational analysis but I’m pretty sure you didn’t lie awake at night in your little bed dreaming of telling fortunes on Wilvercombe promenade when you grew up.”
Sherlock pulled himself up a little taller, before striking the death blow.
The pilot looked askance, “I don’t want you to.”
Downstairs, Mrs Hudson and Stefan were getting along famously, helped by a liberal measure of eggnog. As Molly rescued the bewildered Pole, Mrs Hudson waved them off at the front door insisting, “You must both come to my eve of Christmas Eve party, I’ll make Poppy Seed Cake for you Stefan, so you’ll feel at home.”
As he pedalled furiously John racked his brain to see if he could remember who slept in the corner rooms in that wing of the school. He thought it was Morrison and a boy with a vivarium on the first floor, above them, Caunter and the new boy Arthur Saltire. At once, John was certain that it had been Arthur whom he had seen making his escape.
“I don’t claim to have any supernatural gift,” he said stiffly.
The thought hit him with a jolt and John turned slightly to look at his former friend, whom he had mourned for so long but now was sitting beside him, in a pickup truck in the middle of The Peak District, arguing with his brother as if he had never been away.
Take a coffin and a crib, add a journey on a bus with a flower behind an ear and you have a guilty secret that will poison the past, the present and the future.
“No, not now. That’s what Mycroft taught me to believe”
Sherlock sniffed, he did not tend to pull holes in the plot of Star Wars, he generally reserved that pleasure for Bond Nights. Aware of John’s love of the films, he had called in a few favours to secure tickets for the premiere of the new Star Wars as an early Christmas present. John, delighted, had insisted that they both watch the whole series again to bring them up to speed. Sherlock knew what John was really doing though; John was making new memories for them both because he was going away.
At sunrise came the Queen, and when she saw the gold she was astonished and rejoiced greatly, for she was very avaricious. She had the miller's brother taken into another room filled with straw, much bigger than the last, and told him that as he valued his life, he must spin it all in one night. John did not know what to do, he was beginning to be seriously naffed off with the whole situation, so he stomped around for a bit and called the Queen all the bad names he could think of, including some in Dari and Pashto for colour, and he banged over and over again on the locked door but that only meant that his leg hurt, and his fists ached, and his throat got sore until eventually he had to sit down and rest. John felt very sorry for himself and said out loud, “I could do with that tall thin man in the long black coat turning up again to help me.”
which led to cries of encore.
At least. Sherlock thinks. It can’t get any worse – prematurely as it turns out.
Sherlock glances shyly at John who shakes his head imperceptibly. This suits them both, Sherlock because he has already earmarked the room for a laboratory and John because he thinks some of Sherlock’s things can be stored there, but mainly because they belong together.
But then the doctor had also said Sherlock owed him an explanation
“You’ve got me completely wrong John.” Sherlock replied, standing up and putting Rosie down, “I think it sounds quite jolly.”
“The police,” Somersby gave a shrug at that and held out his hands as if in submission, Sherlock continued.
John watched as the Great Nostromo, or rather Sherlock as he supposed he could call him, went about putting up the shutters and locking the door of the cabin, the sign already said closed. He disappeared into the back room and reappeared minus his cloak, false beard and moustache, ruffling his hair as he did so. John registered his approval; on the whole he preferred his clairvoyants clean shaven. He was struck by a thought.
Lestrade’s convinced the suspect has a shooter and says as much. He radios for assistance and settles down to wait, except the irresponsible git of a consultant he’s been landed with is off on the chase and the DI has little choice but to follow him.
“Of course,” John replied, “penicillin”
“What war?” Mycroft repeated, “The Gulf War? Iran-Iraq?”
“That is good news”
Sherlock was having fun.
Only what appeared to be the final word was obscured beyond recognition but Sherlock could tell it was clearly designed to rhyme with the third line. What could it be? Sherlock visited the dictionary corner of his mind palace… when I think of your tum? Thumb? Ileum… he shook his head, ridiculous. Oh, Sherlock felt his face burn… when I think of your bum. Sherlock’s heart did its own flip, he didn’t like the connotations of John thinking of anyone’s derriere, he didn’t like it one bit.
John proved an able and popular addition to the school and the Headmaster was sorry that he had no permanent vacancy for him. However boarding schools tend to operate within the old boys’ network they serve to perpetuate, and he mentioned John to a fellow Head who was looking for a residential master from the Summer Term onwards. John was duly interviewed and appointed. The school was in an inhospitable part of the Derbyshire peaks and that suited John just fine.
Legwork, never his natural milieu, has been beyond him for years even if there was time between meals. Instead he deploys a small army of agents operating in a web that would rival that of any consulting criminal. Chief of these, though neither brother would care to admit it, is the younger Holmes, along with his aide-de-camp, the estimable Watson.
“Well you ask her, you’re her favourite.”
“Are you ok?”
“Not that one,” Greg said quickly, “they conspiracy to murder.”
John said his goodbyes and turned to go; it was only when heard a peal of laughter that he realised that Sherlock had lingered behind to whisper in Dinah’s ear.
“I don’t want an expert; I want a mate.”
“Would you be able to take a note to the farm?”
“Now they 'download' their holiday reading onto something called a Kind-ley or they listen to a Jane Austen that some movie star has recorded onto a cassette, and it has become harder and harder to fob them off with a PD James. It all became so dispiriting, I decided to surround myself with beautiful flowers instead.  Hence the change to the sign on the premises.”
Aziraphale was still rather bewildered as to the precise circumstances in which he had ended up with this gig but having once set his hand to the plough was not about to look back. He agreed after some debate, to lop a few inches off his height, his hair, and his waistline, but he drew the line at changing his accent.
John threw the card down on the table, for a moment everything was just white noise,
“Five minutes in London and it’s slush”
“Things to do, places to be, I’ve left my riding crop in the mortuary, see you at six”
Mary Morstan knew how to keep her cool under even the most stressful of situations, a trait that had served her well throughout her professional life. When she considered the intricacies of some of the operations she had organised, a wedding was hardly going to turn her into Bridezilla.
Sherlock said, “You don’t strike me as the kind of person to cheat me of my fee. Please do sit down, tell me your name and what has brought you all the way from London to Wilvercombe today, because it is certainly not the sea air."
“I see a future in the skies. Aim low, sell yourself cheap, look for a company where they need you more than you need them, it will pay off in the end.”
“To see Fat Eddie.”
“Something like that.” Sherlock admitted.
"We wrote to each other every day and by the end of the month we were engaged. We agreed that a quiet legal ceremony would suit us both, I didn’t want to wait and neither did Ian so he said he would get a special licence. I told Mother and Mrs Etheredge, but I didn’t want Mr Windibank to object so I suggested a date when I knew he would be away… you know the rest.”
******
“Course not, can’t wait to be rid of you. I’m going round to Janine’s to talk all things lilac over a bottle or wine… or two!”
******
“I might say the same of you, Miss Sutherland.” John spoke the truth, when had last seen the young woman, as he put her into a taxi for Wilvercombe station, she had been in a very sorry state, bedraggled, tearstained and heartbroken. Now she was rosy cheeked and smiling, radiating happiness.
Crowley contemplated this statement for a moment. He didn’t have friends, only one. He tried to imagine how he might feel if that friend suddenly took up with someone else. Not that angels, even fallen ones went in for that kind of thing, or at least he didn’t, on reflection he rather thought Aziraphale might, if the circumstances were right. It was not a comfortable thought and Crowley began to have an inkling of just what Sherlock Holmes was going through.
Sherlock couldn’t answer, he didn’t know. He’d thought he had nailed the whole fortune telling malarkey. He had a system… deduce and display, regale and reveal, ka-ching, next! He had never made a comment that hadn’t the sound base of observation cross referenced against the huge amount of data he had stored in his memory banks. He dealt in cold hard facts not idle suppositions…
******
John picked up his phone and dialled the number that he had cajoled out of Hopkins earlier, it rang a couple of times before a man with a broad Scottish accent answered, “Heart of Shetland Hotel…”
“The rivalry between myself and Lestrade provided Dinah with the suspect for my murder.”
******
He supposed the receptionist, Lilith according to her name badge, was trying to be helpful. It was hardly her fault that the rooms in the hotel’s extension were closed for renovations following a recent flood. Or that the twin room had already been commandeered by Herefordshire police, or that the booking made by Miss Baker had not mentioned that Mr Holmes would be accompanied by his partner.
John struggled with the rising tide of emotions that welled up inside when he thought about his former flatmate.  He feared if he saw Sherlock, he would beat his brains out for him, or burst into tears, or hug him and never let him go again. None of these reactions were acceptable so he did nothing to close the gap between them.
Mycroft addresses Sherlock as if he were a public meeting. “I have spoken to Mummy and Father and they agree that you may stay with them in Sussex”
“A bad business, and yet if you hadn’t been here we might never have known of Garvey’s involvement, particularly if Patrick Hilton doesn’t pull through. The evidence all pointed to a murder suicide.”
There’s something about the resurrection of James Moriarty that resonates with the detective. An investigation from a previous life or parallel universe. He recalls Watson had been spellbound, a case filled with ghosts and apparitions, messages from beyond the grave, eerie melodies, secret societies and tales from the crypt that had caused a veritable hurricane of hyperbole in the journals of his Boswell. At the centre the most magnificent maleficence, the murder of a man by a wife already dead.
“False teeth… pleurisy… only child… banker… votes conservative,” the isolated words forming pieces of a puzzle falling seamlessly into place, “Lived in Stirling… Episcopalian”
In the distance the church clock began to strike – one, two… ten, eleven, twelve.
Crowley stepped off the train and made his way out of the station, by passing both the stairs and the escalators.
Still another forty-eight hours and he was out of here, back to London, and his bride to be. Dinah was a wonderful woman, Lestrade still couldn’t quite believe she was going to be his wife, his feet hadn’t touched the ground since he’d met her.
“She’s obviously in love with the boy, so only sees his good side. Will you go?”
John placed a hand on Sherlock’s forehead to gauge his temperature,
Startled Sherlock does as he’s told; John peels back the quilt and scoots underneath.
A brief shadow passed over the duke’s face, but Sherlock had to give him credit, his Grace gave very little away.
“Need to get my head together, needed to make sure your boyfriend was off the scene.”
At Oxford the only other occupants of the compartment got out and Sherlock, who had successfully obtained the transcripts of the inquest from the police records, began to fill John in with the facts of the case.
John fetches the baby monitor, Rosie tends to sleep through the night but it wouldn’t do not to hear her wake.
“Six or seven years, thereabouts.”
Sherlock put down his phone. John was coming back to Baker Street, with Rosie, his final wish come true. It was indeed a miracle.
It was John’s turn to take a drink.
******
While his blogger’s prose often tended to romanticise their exploits during various cases, John had never shown any inclination towards any other sort of sentimental writings let alone poesy. Even the selection of readings at his ill-fated wedding had been left to Mary (and the vicar).
“May be Patrick blamed himself?”
Earlier that afternoon, while a reluctant Rosie was down for a nap and John had thought himself alone Sherlock had spied him scribbling notes on a piece of paper. John had hurriedly stuffed the paper down the side of his chair when he realised that Sherlock had come back upstairs and then hidden it more carefully when he thought Sherlock wasn’t looking. The detective had had to wait a full, and unacceptable, two hours for John to leave the flat with Rosie in order to retrieve the paper and find out what the doctor was being so mysterious about.
“Now, don’t forget to keep counting, let’s start from the basic position… your left hand…here, keep it there. I’m going to push you out and then swing you back in for the dip, then you can try it.”
John is yet to be informed that only lies have detail, he finds Harry’s story infinitely plausible. He cannot speak.
“I know, Mrs King,” Sherlock said gently, “That’s why the bullet hit the window frame.”
“The boy may not have been struggling, he may have been drugged.” Dr Huxtable caught sight of Sherlock’s face at that suggestion and continued hurriedly, “or perhaps Dr Watson was following the boy and wanted to catch up with him.”
“Added to this Mary Windibank got landed with costs after her unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the 2002 will, while James appears to have sailed very close to the wind financially for years.”
For a second, Sherlock’s face seemed to display something like regret, but then he rallied.
John did not hesitate, he answered, “I would spend my days scaling walls, running along alleyways and clambering over rooftops with you. And I would spend my nights… well I would spend my nights, exploring the depths of passion, discovering the heights of desire and making love to you.”
“Starving!”
Sherlock looked at the boy and exclaimed, “Yes, exactly! Let’s try it.”
“You are not in control of it, it’s controlling you,” Mycroft waves a hand at Sherlock’s cocaine paraphernalia on the little table, “You must see it will destroy everything you hold most dear?”
“There’s nothing wrong with your hair, it suits you a bit longer.” Sherlock argued.
“Then can’t you get rid of her… No not like that,” Crowley added quickly when he spotted the return of Aziraphale’s shocked expression, “send her out of London for some reason. I know, on a course, humans are always going on courses.”
Home he gave Watson her lunch and then settled her on his lap for a story. He worked his way through
“Excellent,” He said looking round for another bottle of the Châteauneuf du Pape, “and for good measure, I’ll throw in a power outage.”
The silence continued although the blinking abated somewhat.
“There’s a job coming up, in Selly Oak, Men’s surgical, three days a week. An old colleague of mine is the department head, he’s suggested an application from me would be looked on very favourably.”
Aveling thought for a moment. “No. I’m not even sure he could ride one,  I never saw him on one, but he is young, and it tends to be the slightly older boys who go out on bikes.”
“Well, if you are sure,” Molly didn’t sound convinced but decided to take his word for it.
His phone said unknown number but Sherlock, whose good mood continued, answered it anyway.
“I thought so.” John picked up a cut glass tumbler and polished it before putting it on a tray.
“Naturally.” The Duke replied, “The Duchess has returned to England and is presently in London liaising with her bankers, although she is expected at Holderness imminently.”
“I had my reasons, now if you will excuse me, I have work to do.” Mycroft turned away and walked over to his desk.
He returns the stolen books on famous poisoners to the library, not because of conscience, just keeping busy.
John is home on leave.
“What if they had the means to dig a grave?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock didn’t know where to begin in processing this new development. He returned swiftly to the John rooms in his Mind Palace to try to get his thoughts in order, and more importantly to see how he had missed the tell-tale signs that John was about to propose.
“I do, in fact I am banking on it. She is a fundamentally pure and honest woman, she would never cheat me, and would never believe that anyone could cheat her.”
At eight-thirty Greg reluctantly joined the rest of his team in the dining room where they were all tucking into a hearty Scottish breakfast. He sat down next to Donovan and ordered a coffee from the hovering waitress.
“What are you doing?”
But he added, “I can’t see it would have been possible with a car, nothing to hold on to.”
Mycroft recognised the reference and was even more discombobulated, if such a thing was possible, especially when the man, his guest Mycroft supposed, came forward and peered at him inquisitively.
Sherlock announced that he was ready to go to Holderness Hall and a taxi was on its way. John insisted on accompanying him, just as Sherlock had known he would.
“Ridiculous, I told you often enough,” Piecroft, despite his natural aversion to legwork has followed Sherlock down, “Caring is not an advantage.”
Greg bid them farewell and went off to the underground to take the tube back to Streatham. It was a discouraging thought, his flat was depressing at the best of times, he supposed that he would have to unpack and try to make the place liveable again, but not until he had slept at least until Boxing Day and before that there was someone he needed to see. In the distance the clock of St Mary’s stuck the quarter hour. Dinah and Sherlock would be married by now he guessed; the whole situation seemed surreal. He wondered if he should feel angry, but instead he felt relieved. Washed up, foolish and old… granted… but mostly relieved.
The two men sat in silence for a while, thinking about what they had discovered. Eddie brought them more coffee and only this interruption did John speak.
But there was something about his air of self-satisfaction as Mycroft reviewed Sherlock’s files that made him want to wipe the smug expression off his brother’s face.
“If I am to be of any assistance in discovering the whereabouts of your fiancé, I need complete disclosure. Begin with what I got right yesterday, and Dr Watson will make notes of any information you provide that might be pertinent to solving this conundrum.”
While John was in the shower, Sherlock made two short phone calls and one longer one, and made a fresh pot of tea, he was taking the nurse’s instruction to keep John well hydrated seriously. When John emerged from the shower and went to get dressed, Sherlock took himself to the guest room and changed out of his country clothes and into a suit before returning to find John, clean shaven and looking remarkably well, waiting for him.
Sherlock agreed. “Which generally means one of two things, either the affaires of the deceased were particularly complicated, or the will was contested.”
He took a large piece of cardboard and the marker pen that he occasionally used for sending books through the post, when he ran out of excuses not to sell them, and wrote a few words on it. Then, something of an afterthought, he took his usual pen and wrote a shorter note for Crowley just in case the demon returned to the shop in his absence; satisfied he had covered all bases, Aziraphale transformed himself into his Ralph Fell persona and went outside.
And so it went on, for hours and hours, round and round in Sherlock’s head, every syllable, every nuance, every tone, every expression, examined and catalogued until all other possibilities were exhausted.
“Cheer up Guv,” Sally said patting his hand, “as no one can get off or onto the island, we can keep our rooms, they’re not going throw us out into the snow.”
Crowley looked askance. “Are you sure that’s what you meant? Do you know what a bucket list is?”
“John, Dr John Watson,” the soldier helpfully supplied.
Once in the kitchen, John got busy putting away the shopping and preparing lunch for Rosie “She needs a nap” he explained “Once she’s gone down, then we’ll talk. Make yourself useful and put the kettle on”
, Sherlock laments,
“I tell you what, toss you for it.” Crowley produced a coin. “Ok, heads I win, tails you lose”
“Because the carpet isn’t wet. It’s a windy, rainy night, the windowsill has a pool of water on it and the curtains are damp but if the window had been open for any length of time the rain would have soaked the carpet beneath.”
“Exactly.” Marcus replied, looking for the waitress to signal to, “let’s get you started on that breakfast.”
“A musical?”
“He was arrested I believe?”
Sherlock assessed from the assortment of hair on the woman’s skirt and a lingering aroma and reconsidered.
Mary smiled at that thought but only briefly, things had been going fine, despite the upheaval to their relationship caused by the return of Sherlock Holmes from the dead. But just recently John had been acting strangely, she was aware of it even though she had hardly seen him. John had started staying up later and later, until after even she was asleep; apart from last night when she had got in from the gym and found him already in bed, dead to the world. Could it be that John was getting cold feet?
Sherlock didn’t reply so John went on, “I don’t trust you.”
Sherringford - later the same day
She burst into tears.
“Finally, do you own a gun?”
“I hope to conclude my investigations into the Mary Sutherland matter, the information I requested should be arriving around now.”
John demurred, but Sherlock went on, “My unforgiveable error was not to realise the extent of the danger the Hilton-Cubitts were in. I deduced that Abe Garvey was a stalker; someone from Patrick’s past playing a nasty game, but had no idea it could escalate so quickly. Even when I saw the final note, I thought it was just to put the wind up Patrick. Damn it! I knew that Richard had access to a gun, I just never thought he would use it.”
“I mean are you ok?” Sherlock tried to keep the petulance out of his voice, why was everything to do with emotions so difficult?
So, Sherlock straightened John’s tie and wished him luck as he went off to catch his train, and then took Rosie to ‘stay and play’ in the local church hall. This was not Sherlock’s natural milieu, but he had managed his occasional visits so far without incident. John had at some point told the other parents, predominantly mums, that Rosie’s godfather was very shy, and he wasn’t being rude if he didn’t talk much and this had eased Sherlock’s venture into the world of toddler groups
“Shepherd is the 3839
Rosie had woken while he was absent but seemed happy enough to bounce on Mrs Hudson’s knee while gumming on a banana.
“Will already be ruining the crime scene.” Sherlock answered morosely as the car drew up outside the Boscombe Hotel.
******
Sherlock fell into step as John lead him across the road from the surgery, down a side street and onto the leafy estate where Rosie’s minder lived. When Sherlock still showed no signs of speaking, John took the initiative himself.
John took advantage of the breathing space to take the shower he hadn’t felt comfortable taking while Mary was there. He ate the lunch Mrs Hudson had prepared for him, and then fetched a glass of water for Sherlock.
It was an agonisingly slow progress, feeling the way in front for obstacles, rocks and ledges, bat droppings and other pitfalls. In the darkness, cut off from sight and sounds he was startled to find himself thinking about Sherlock and wondering what he was doing right now. Probably blowing up the kitchen at 221b or getting under Greg’s feet, no doubt. The idea of his friend back where he belonged in London, going about his ordinary extraordinary business was immensely comforting. Yet at the same time the thought that he might die without ever seeing Sherlock again was incredibly painful.
November.”
Century?”
After a surprisingly good meal in the hotel, which even Sherlock had eaten, and a profitable discussion with Somersby (whom they had worked with before on a case concerning a donkey, £3.3 million of stolen Spanish antiquities and a drag artiste called Bertha O’Nation) over a couple of pints, John called it a day and went to bed. He left Sherlock in the residents’ lounge, firing up his computer to prove some point or other, possibly relating to the case.
“I’m sorry.”
“Go back to sleep now… unless you’d rather…”
John steers things slowly, considerate of Sherlock’s innocence and his own lack of (recent) experience, they are content and see no need for declarations of permanence.
John didn’t speak, he couldn’t, he looked at Mary and wondered how she could stand there so calmly and not understand the significance of those words.
Almost reluctantly he decided against it and settled for a half-truth instead, “I was with friends.”
“Aren’t you a lucky girl.” Mrs Hudson agreed, before sitting down and accepting the cup of tea that John offered. “John dear, I just wondered if you had plans for today.”
The two men passed through the archway into the grounds, there were lights around the perimeter, but Sherlock was immediately aware of just how dark it could be in the open country. The moon was rising, full, not as much as it would have been two nights before, but bright and would be brighter still later on.  The two men set off round the outside of the building and approached the main drive, it wasn’t long, less than half a mile but if his limp was as pronounced as Dr Huxtable made out, Sherlock could understand why John had needed to cycle.
It was getting lighter; John was sure of it. He looked up, but all was still complete darkness, the light was not coming from above. In which case… John felt giddy with relief. He wanted to stand up, to start running  towards it, but common sense prevailed. He had come too far to fall at the last hurdle.
"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"
But this situation is too delicate for Sherlock’s touch – an invisible enemy, ubiquitous, unstoppable and undetected that threatens life as it is known, and yet must not be defeated.
“What is it?” John asked, coming back into the sitting room with the mugs and recognising the look on the detective’s face.
Sherlock spent another unprofitable hour or two working on various permutations of the letters and was pretty certain that the second most frequent figure was an A, or possibly a T. He gave up and lay down on the couch. The couch was new, long and wide and ideal for thinking and occasionally sleeping, so Sherlock did both.
In truth Murray found John’s kit bag so expertly tied he knew he’d never get away with it. John looks relieved.
It is not the end of grief and guilt, or even the beginning of the end but perhaps it is the end of the beginning.
“This way” Aveling said cheerfully, “Dr Watson’s rooms are in the Western wing, most of the single residential masters live there, it is handy for the science labs and classrooms on the ground floor. You can walk through the building, but you’re less likely to get lost going round the outside, and it will give you an idea of the lay of the land. The boys have study bedrooms in the Southern and Eastern wings, the dining room and kitchens are in South too. The Northern wing has the offices and more classrooms. The Headmaster and the residential married staff have houses in the grounds.
“I checked, you didn’t say anything to the others about where we’re off to and they never said anything to you. It’s unofficial until we get there anyway. Even if you guessed we were due for deployment, it could have been Iraq, or Sierra Leone or even Bosnia. So, what made you say Afghanistan and why did you tell me not to go there? Tell me! What did you see?”
“The eighth duke died in 1993, the estate passed to his brother along with the bulk of the assets that went with it, but the eighth duke made two hefty bequests to his daughters Amanda and Isobel, and these had to be paid, so off went another couple of grand masters to auction. The ninth duke set out to circumvent inheritance taxes by transferring the estate to his son, but he died before the term of the transfer was complete and that left our present duke practically bankrupt. Despite never having lived here he had no wish to be the last Duke to do so, so he did what all impoverished aristos have been doing for centuries. He married an heiress.
“I believe that is correct. As I said, within a fortnight the boy was quite at home with us and was apparently absolutely happy.”
Mycroft didn’t move, he was scarcely breathing, his face a picture of shock, he was silent for so long Greg wondered if he should call someone. Finally, Mycroft spoke.
The sneezing had caused a salesman to appear from the back of the shop, he was a smartly dressed, pleasant, fussy man, with beautiful hands and quite obviously gayer than springtime. He introduced himself as Mr Fell, the proprietor and went into a stream of consciousness rapture over the colour of the bridesmaids’ dresses before talking nineteen to the dozen about teardrops, tussie-mussies, posies, presentations and pomanders. Mary soon found herself swept up in his enthusiasm and confessed that she knew nothing about flowers.
“Mr Holmes?”
"I see… you said the boy’s room was searched after he was discovered to be missing, there was no letter found?”
“Breakfast at seven.” He said as he left the room.
The car delivered him to Mycroft’s office, where his brother was sat behind his desk in the usual manner, face a little rounder, hair slightly thinner but otherwise unchanged. If it hadn’t been for the encounter in Serbia, Sherlock might have supposed that the man had not moved a muscle in two years.
“The steps of the British Museum. At six o’clock.”
Mycroft sighed, “I expected as much, what are your intentions?”
Mycroft glanced at his watch, “There seems no harm in telling you now. Ms Shepherd is likely to be arrested very shortly for the murder of Major Robert Beckworth, Sir Wilfred Veneering and her first husband, Emmanuel Leibowitz, and for the attempted murder of my brother Sherlock.”
“Because I know you, don’t get distracted, go on.”
“What does he look like, this man?”
“Lord Arthur?” Sherlock queried, thinking of the missing boy.
“Simple, you could have said ‘Dinah Shepherd is a serial killer, don’t marry her’.”
“I had the feeling I was being watched, it took me a while to work out who you were, but then I had long enough you must have been there over an hour. I told Chris and Bill; they couldn’t understand why I was so mad at you. They thought it was a laugh, just the usual stuff about family, and work, girlfriends and travel, none of this blurting out warnings and then standing there gawping like a fish for them.
Sherlock made a sign of enquiry to the liveried doorman and was directed, not to the strangers’ room, where speech was permitted and his interviews with his brother usually took place but to Mycroft’s private suite on the first floor. The fact that Mycroft was here, rather than his flat in Pall Mall indicated that something was very wrong indeed.
“Reuben was always a nasty piece of work,” Steve agreed, “that’s why the pub went down the drain, he was at odds with everyone in the village.”
“But she was supposed to be dead, or at least out of the country.”
John watched as Sherlock tried to assimilate all that was meant in their short conversation. He decided it might be better to show him. He stood up, took Sherlock by the hand so that he stood up too and there in the sitting room, before the fire on a winter’s night, and under the mistletoe that was still attached to the light, they shared their first kiss
“Seriously?” John sounded sceptical but Sherlock noticed he preened a little “Love at first sight and all that?”
John is incredulous, possibly dreaming because there by all that is marvellous is Mr Cheekbones; older, thinner, better dressed but unmistakable.
Richard Hilton-Cubitt turned out to be a handsome man of around forty-five who reminded Sherlock somewhat of Mycroft, but despite that seemed likeable enough. He was as tall as Sherlock but built more sturdily as a man used to working on the land. However it was clear from his clothes and his accent that he was no horny handed son of the soil, rather a gentleman who farmed his own estate, and while his speech and mannerisms could hardly be described as effete there was something about them which revealed his sexuality.
Abandoning the bedroom and ignoring the study for the moment, Sherlock went into the kitchen. It was so small it hardly earned the name, but then he supposed that John would eat most of his meals in the school dining room. The contents of the cupboards bore this out, just a sliced loaf and two types of jam, a couple of tins of soup and, on the top shelf, a huge catering size box of teabags. Teabags! John had always preferred loose leaf tea, and still did if contents of the caddy and the sprinkling of leaves in the teapot on the counter were anything to go by.
“You wrote that poem…for me?”
“Go on,” John said encouragingly, “Dazzle us!”
Although he had been back from his exile for almost five months, Sherlock was still underweight, even for someone who was as naturally slender, and the wounds on his back, that he thought John knew nothing about, although healed had hardly begun to fade. John couldn’t help a pang of guilt when he considered those scars, and the incident in the Landmark when he had knocked Sherlock to the floor. The fall had broken the stitches, John was aware of that now, but it had become just another thing that he and Sherlock didn’t talk about.
“Apparently I am busy after all.”
Knowing he wasn’t going to win Sherlock abruptly changed the subject. “And what about John Watson?”
“A visiting order, you need apply for a visiting order, in triplicate no less than fourteen days in advance of your intended visit, and have it signed by a senior demon and returned stamped, one copy for you, one for me and one for the file.”
Miss Sutherland relaxed her grip on her handbag and took a letter from the bundle inside and reluctantly handed it to Sherlock.
“Do either of you know when James Wilder’s birthday is?” Sherlock demanded.
Sherlock considers her reply carefully “It seems we are alike then you and I” he states emerging from the darkness.
As it turned out Sherlock had plenty of time, as soon as he saw his client disappear into the house, Sherlock slipped round the back under cover of darkness, hopped over the fence and forced the basement kitchen window. He stealthily climbed the back stairs and made his way along the landing to the master bedroom. The drawer of the dressing table was unlocked, it was an old piece which had no doubt lost its key years ago. Sherlock reached in and took out the jewellery box.
Sherlock nodded and they went back to sitting in silence. Around another twenty minutes passed before the Duke reappeared.
“Just for a few days?” Sherlock tried to keep the disappointment out of his voice but didn’t quite succeed. John picked up on it at once.
John looked at him then, his beloved friend, standing in front of him, a little proud, a little afraid, and the anger melted away; John loved him very much, this oddball, and he wanted what ever it took for him to be happy.
Mrs Hudson nodded, that sounded familiar. “John dear… why don’t you come home?”
Sherlock passes the time by telling John how he worked it out; deciphering Eurus’s song and the clues in the impossible gravestones. Even in the most fraught of circumstances Sherlock preens a little at John’s admiration.
What a futile exercise that was. He’d wanted to see John one last time, to say adieu even if was really goodbye. A grand gesture? Who knows?
“Absolutely brilliant, you got all that from just one word! Amazing!”
“Dinah is a wonderful woman;” Greg replied, “I’d be mad not to marry her.”
******
“I had suspected Dinah the moment I found out about her from Mycroft. To lose one husband may be unfortunate, to lose a second tragic, but three, three looks suspiciously like an inside job. I made up my mind to court her, to see if she would regard me as a better prospect than a senior policeman. Particularly when she discovered how wealthy I am. When I made a will in her favour yesterday, I effectively signed my own death warrant.”
The Duke offered to find Sherlock and John a ride back to the school. John accepted gratefully; now that the chase was over, he was feeling a bone weariness that was beyond anything he had experienced in his life since Afghanistan. It seemed that, for the moment, the police were unaware that John had become entangled with the events of Lord Saltire’s abduction and he was keen to keep it that way. He had no wish to be tied up in police procedure or drawn into any notoriety the presence of Sherlock Holmes might provoke.
“Quantum Physics or Solipsism?”
Sherlock turns to address his waiting audience, “I think you should investigate the funds missing from St Bernard’s Pence, an Episcopalian charity based in Scotland, with assets on four continents, find the other signatory on the account and you have your murderer.”
“Don’t start that again” John cut in “I’ve heard you use his real name”
The client had an answer, “Aunty keeps everything of value in a locked box, inlaid Javanese lacquer,  in her dressing table, if the emerald is in the house, it will be there.”
“It seems pretty definite.”
“John would hardly have needed a bicycle to overtake a small boy on foot!”
Mrs Hudson went to speak but John put up his hand, “And I don’t think it would be very practical.”
“What…”
could I mean?”
Miss Sutherland bent her head, blushing to the roots of her hair. “It is true, we have never met face to face, but I see Ian in my dreams every night and I know him inside and out.”

As John approached the table, he made the universal signal for a drink. Lestrade shook his head indicating the pint in front of him so John went up the bar and just ordered one for himself, before joining Greg at his table.
Mary half closed her eyes and inclined her head with a slight nod and gave her most knowing look. Crowley picked up on it immediately, message understood, she had taken the bait. Not all communication needed to be verbal.
Sherlock upgraded the case to a five, not riveting but it would do; he condescended to put on his coat and accompany Lestrade to Bart’s where the body had been taken for the post-mortem.
“When the Duke, the present duke that is, inherited he knew that most of the staff had an inkling that James Wilder was Alex’s son. His Grace told me that Alex had wanted to do the right thing by the girl and make sure she was provided for. Reuben Hayes, Julie's husband is a miserable fellow; he ran the pub into the ground and lost his licence, so the Duke brought them up here to live in the Lodge, his parents’ old house. Julie works in the Hall and Reuben does odd jobs, beating and the like. Then when James left school, the Duke took him on as his assistant, with the idea of him talking over as land agent when Rogers retires, which seemed fair enough.
Sam was like Santa’s little helper on speed, her conversation, even in passing was littered with references to Christmas from ‘done all your shopping yet?’ to ‘written your cards?’ Even Nargis, the other morning receptionist at the practice, had to graciously point out that she didn’t really celebrate Christmas, and that she was unlikely to take advantage of Tesco’s two for one offer on ‘pigs in blankets’.
“I used to say all emotions were abhorrent to me”
Greg took the tube back to his flat in Streatham, the place was already half in boxes although he and Dinah hadn’t decided where they were going to live after the wedding.
The celebrant, a tall, heavy set man in his sixties, with iron grey hair, thick horn rimmed glasses and a distinct stoop addressed the couple on the seriousness of the step they were about to take then gave them the opportunity to exchange vows, which as John expected were brief and to the point.
Perhaps Sherlock should have realised he was out of his depth when Magnussen used the fireplace as a urinal, or six months earlier when he’d chosen not to deliver Mary to the police but rather filed that information for future reference.
“I must commend you on your ability to act the jealous partner, Dinah found it very convincing, and it certainly aided me in the role I had to play.”
“Sherlock… are you still there?” A muttered curse but not so much background noise.
“Now I really must get on.” Mycroft picked up a piece of paper from the desk and began to study it carefully.
“Really John!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Between them the wrestled the bike from its resting place in the hedge. Sherlock quickly compared it to the description Aveling had given him. It was a high-end mountain bike, less than six months old – almost certainly John’s. Despite being thrown over a hedge it seemed to have come to no harm and had certainly not been in an accident.
“Speaking of your father, I understand that he was too ill to attend the inquest?”
“Because of the missing boy.” Steve supplied, “Why would a teacher be out on the road in the middle of the night unless it was to do with the missing boy. It couldn’t be a coincidence.”
John watched his sister weave her way through the club to where Clara was waiting. The night was young and he’d spied a potential tall, thin, nervy looking brunette of his own. And if not, there was always the beat.
“Oh please, like this is the worst I have done…This is an experiment. There will be rigour”
John falters and the silence causes Sherlock to turn his attention to his friend. He deduces that John is battling with another request, something far more momentous than anything he has said so far. Sherlock smiles encouragingly.
“I don’t know, you tell me”
In fact they would all have lost their money as when Greg arrived a few minutes later he was trailing a sheepish looking Mycroft.
John reacted immediately, and praying that he wasn’t horribly mistaken, and that Sherlock and Dinah hadn’t locked the door in order to have some ‘alone time’, he and Simon rushed at the door. The lock gave on their second attempt.
Sherlock had either seen the text for the prank it was, or had chosen to ignore it, or maybe he had even failed to understand it. Either way the joke had fallen flat, and that, as Lestrade reported to Mycroft, was that.
“I’ll go,” Mrs Hudson stood up after the second knock, as Sherlock still hadn’t moved, muttering “not your butler either” under her breath.
“Well, the last one is wasted on us, but ten years on and I’m still up for a snog with the hubby under the mistletoe” said Mark, as he grabbed his husband and pulled him down for a kiss.
Sherlock was stumped… except there was something he wanted, very much. It was never going to happen but as there was no scientific basis to wishing what difference would it make. Picking up both the wooden spoon and the bowl he gave the mixture another vigorous stir.
But Mr Fell,
“You didn’t photograph them?”
Crowley rather thought Antonia was going to prove extremely useful in his campaign, he’d better practice walking in heels.
Back in the bedroom, John checked Sherlock’s temperature and pulse and said. “Going in the right direction. I could do with him having his next dose of antibiotics, but it seems a shame to wake him.”
Greg looked uncomfortable, as if he was looking for an excuse but had not thought of one quickly enough.
“Dan and Laura Williams? They’re mine.”
“No Crowley, you ask too much, it was your idea, and you are the one to do it.”
Of course, she hadn’t known he was dead, not right away. He had assigned John Watson to her as her mark, told her to stay with him, and only to stand down once she heard that Sherlock Holmes was dead. This she had, it had been all over the news for days, but she had never quite believed it. So, she had continued to keep tabs on John Watson, waiting for the call from Jim, which never came.
Sherlock has some surprising news for John.
221B - John and Rosie Watson
As John sat and waited, he had a chance to reflect again on the incongruity of Lestrade’s engagement to a woman such as Dinah Shepherd. Greg was a decent enough bloke, as Sherlock had once said, he was a man, and good at it; he scrubbed up well too, but the bottom line he was a pretty ordinary guy and not someone you would associate with the glitz and glamour that accompanied the likes of Dinah or would be at home in a suite at the Savoy. Perhaps it was true when they said opposites attract, and that Dinah had meant what she had said, that after so much tragedy in her life she wanted someone that she could depend on, away from the spotlights and the newspaper columns.
“Am I?” John kept the slight query in his voice. He would much rather be involved in a case than do crafts at the church hall, but Sherlock imperious attitude to John’s timetable did annoy him.
“So it would seem,” Sherlock agreed. “Perhaps you can account also for the bullet which has so obviously struck the edge of the window?” He had turned suddenly, and his long, thin ﬁnger was pointing to a hole which had been drilled right through the frame about an inch from the top.
“Look, we’re heading off now, Clara’s got work in the morning, and we’re going to share a cab… Wish me luck, I’ll find out where she lives even if I don’t get invited in for coffee.”
Sherlock systematically began to search the room, starting with the wardrobe and under the bed, before going through the chest of drawers. The first two drawers contained a jumble of socks and underclothes, Sherlock smile ruefully, he had never been able to persuade his flatmate of the benefits of a proper index. The next drawer down contained neatly folded tee-shirts and the bottom one John’s motley collection of jumpers. He bent and picked one up, all John’s jumpers were hideous by default, but this one, the blue Christmas one with the fair isle yoke had particularly bad associations, all the same Sherlock brought it to his face and inhaled deeply…
John turned to Sherlock who was studiously looking the other way and said sotto voce.
? John’s face did a thing until he remembered that was a posh word for wedding.
“Very strict, very fair, a cold one really, never cracks his face, always looks worried to death. He was a bit more human while he was married, and when the kids came along, especially Lord Saltire, the son and heir, but since her ladyship upped and left, he’s gone back to being as moody as he ever was. No wonder she didn’t stick it out.”
Time went on, Mycroft sent a couple of his oppos to clear the Kensal Green flat, and soon all John Watson’s worldly goods were installed back at 221b. There were more of them these days and Sherlock was obliged to undertake a fair amount of rationalisation to accommodate them, but he didn’t object. They still hadn’t mentioned ‘the incident’ but Sherlock was just delighted to have John back under his roof, whatever the circumstances.
Sherlock is sprawled on the couch in Mycroft’s suite at the Diogenes, he is measuring the impact of the ankle tag, swinging his right leg gently like a pendulum. So engrossed that Mycroft’s arrival is unobserved until he speaks.
“Why have you photo taken anyway?” Sherlock muttered, he sipped his tea and looked hopefully at the toaster.
Crowley could never resist the opportunity to gloat, “I knew it!”
Somewhere in the flat a phone was ringing. It had been ringing on and off for over an hour and Sherlock was finding it increasingly difficult to ignore.
******
She reached up to plant a peck on Sherlock’s stubbly cheek, “Happy Christmas, Sherlock Holmes,” and was gone before he had a chance to reply.
Sherlock smiled fondly;
Aziraphale began to count on his fingers. “Firstly, the drug smuggling killer on the ‘Star of Brazil’… secondly, the boa constrictor in the hold…
“Your bag has been taken to a guest room on the first floor, I can take you there or you may wish to start your investigations immediately. Dr Huxtable has asked me to give you whatever assistance you require.”
“Write that down for her… Now Miss Sutherland, I need to keep hold of this letter, may I do that?”
It only occurs to John he doesn’t know Mr Cheekbones’ name when he’s already halfway to the Base.
“She was compos mentis?”
Sherlock ordered a double expresso for himself and an Americano and a ham sandwich for John, (John had reached the stage where he took it for granted that Sherlock knew his preferences, naturally he was spot on and the coffee really was superb).
Sherlock added confusion to the anxiety on his face, “We both have, we’ve known him for years… I don’t like it. It was only two days ago he was engaged to someone else.”
John was just about to tell them not to stop on his account when Greg and Dinah finally arrived.
Once upon a time there was a miller called Harry Watson who was very poor, mainly because she was not a very good miller, often too drunk to do the work, and when she did, she drank the proceeds. Harry Watson had one brother called John, he was a soldier and a healer and very handsome. But he had been injured in the war and couldn’t fight or heal anymore or stop his sister drinking.
“They might be aunt, uncle and nephew… there is something… now I look again, the older two might be related.”
“If there are, they’re down in flat C, out of sight out of mind.”
“Indeed,” Sherlock agreed.
So, it was with pleasure in early September, with his children, his mother and Mycroft all ‘otherwise engaged’, he was able to respond to John Watson’s suggestion of ‘going for a pint’ in the affirmative.
Perhaps the intensity of John’s gaze disturbed him for suddenly the stranger sat up and said, “if you could have anything at all, what would you ask for?”
So far they’ve found the sun and sand and tonight they are hitting the bars looking to complete the hat trick.
Cocooned, that was it, she made him think of a chrysalis, but one with a moth rather than a butterfly inside.
“You did it, you really did it, you got married!”
"I cannot be absolutely certain as we were not looking for a letter, but had it been lying about we would have seen it. Perhaps he had hidden it?”
Baker Street
Another trope I seem to notice in fanfiction is if a story involves the Thames either Sherlock or John will end up in it.
John said at first, “Are you called Jack?”, his Sweetie groaned and said, “dull!”.
“Yet he has organised shoots?”
******
“You brilliant creature.” John was delighted, “and you knew that how?”
After Ruth left, they ordered coffee and Chris and John started to entertain Mary with stories of life in the RAMC, while Sherlock sat back and listened, letting the words flow over him, half in the room and half deep within himself in what he like to think of as his mind palace. He reviewed every incident since he had encountered John, was it really only four days ago? It seemed like a lifetime.
Now the transformation of the second floor stunned him, instead of just one door on the landing there were two. He instinctively opened the door to his old room. At first glance it appeared no different; it was still more or less the same size, although it looked bigger, probably due to the new decoration and blinds. Then he noticed the biggest change, on the far wall there was another door.
came unbidden into John’s head, and he made a decision. He moved slightly so he was stood facing the man,
“Mary Morstan is no saint.” Mycroft spoke as if addressing a particularly backward child, or his younger brother, “the abbreviation for a saint in this country is ST, but Mary Morstan is not a saint. Remove those letters from the name Morstan and what you are left with is MORAN.”
John took their collection of takeaway menus from the fridge door, “What do you say to a takeaway, seeing that we didn’t have one on Friday? I’ve a mind for Thai this evening but I could be persuaded on Chinese, or there’s that Lebanese place where we had that Sayadieh you liked.”
“I’ll see your ten years and give you fifty” Mummy said as she pulled Father into a clinch.
“Then if it is possible we should hear their story at once.”
Mycroft makes an intervention.
******
The backroom of a shop in Soho
Sherlock turned to Mrs Hudson’s iPod and scanned through the tracks until he came to something he thought suitable.
After Hilton-Cubitt had left, Sherlock changed back into his pyjamas, put on his second best dressing gown and took up a horizontal position on his couch to spend a couple of hours in his mind palace.
The only consolation in John’s limited availability to attend cases with him, was the pleasure of knowing that John was at home,
John kept his appointments with his probation officer who made several unwelcome suggestions as to suitable activities with which his could pay his debt to society. John knew that Mycroft could make the conviction disappear with the stroke of a pen but nothing would have induced him to make such a request, instead he took great pains to demonstrate his willingness to consider anything while finding objections to everything on her list.  He had no wish to work with the homeless for fear encountering Sherlock’s former network, likewise with anything to do with drug or alcohol rehabilitation triggered more unhappy memories. The thought of hospital work under these circumstances repelled him and he had no inclination for gardening. Finally, as he was running out of time and options, he agreed to volunteer at an adult literacy and ESOL project in Tower Hamlets. With the patience instilled him by a career in medicine, military life and nannying the world’s only consulting detective he quietly discovered he had a natural aptitude for teaching.
The angel looked so sad that Crowley made a rash decision.
“I do indeed, Mrs Hudson. Got a body in a hotel in Bayswater, discovered in the cleaners’ cupboard early this morning, not a lot to go on,” Lestrade replied, addressing the final comment to Sherlock.
“No more than I deserve.”
Sherlock’s first client of the morning was an overweight man of medium height with an unhealthy colour and a wheezy cough.
“On the day of the murder André Cloete had walked up to a stretch of water known as Boscombe mere that bordered the edge of his farm with that of the estate. Crowder, that’s the gamekeeper at Boscombe Hall, was in his garden and saw Cloete walking down the lane towards the mere around three o’clock. His son Paul is a student at the Agricultural College in Cirencester, and away during term time so Crowder was surprised to see him walk past, with a rifle under his arm, just a few minutes later.
“The Sea View Hotel, Wilvercombe”
“You were used to keeping things hidden from someone living in the same house where privacy could not be assumed, not any more, though, for the past few months it’s been out on display. Conclusion you live alone now”
Removing his tweezers from his pocket he used them to pick up the paper and prise it apart. There was some writing on the page, once more in John’s hand but the water had faded the ink to the extent that it was almost completed obliterated. Almost but not quite.
Sherlock closed his eyes and shook the thought away. “No!”
Sherlock thought there was something in what she was saying but he couldn’t quite grasp it.
“Great, that’s great.”
“I think, my friends,” Sherlock whispered, “that we had better take up our position behind the door. He isn’t expecting us, but he was armed before and every precaution is necessary. Be ready with your handcuffs, inspector. You can leave the talking to me.”
“Mrs Flugrath died in May 2003 and probate was granted in January 2005, that’s over eighteen months later. Seems a long time,” John observed, thinking of the legal necessities after his own father’s death.
Lestrade opened his mouth to say something, took one look at Sherlock’s face, thought better of it and hastily finished his tea.
“DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?” he shouted.
“Can I get you anything while you are waiting?” John asked, feeling in need of a drink himself, “Tea? Something stronger? Scotch?”
John had, but only from Sherlock.
Steve handled the truck well and navigated the twists and turns in the lane without difficulty, but Sherlock noted that they rarely got above twenty miles an hour. As the truck made its way back on itself the other side of the Priory Farm, Sherlock could see how it would be much quicker to cycle over the fields, and to prove the point, as they drew close to the junction, there was Danny half obscured by the trees.
“I thought you might have.”
He found the detective by the lean-to at the side of the surgery frequented by the surprising number of patients who seemed to need a smoke while waiting for their name to be called. He was eyeing up a Marlborough Red longingly but had the grace to look guilty when John appeared.
“Quite.”
“I wish…”
Crowley agreed to come for one drink.
“But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?”
“Wasn’t Sherlock in this morning?”
Sherlock rose to his full height and began the speech he had prepared during the sleepless night.
Mary smiled, she had been subconsciously waiting for a sign, a signal, some hidden clue that Antonia was not all she appeared to be, ever since the woman had inveigled her way into their company the week before. Mary still didn’t know what Antonia wanted with her, was it a contract, a hit? Was it blackmail, was it a threat; rest assured she would find out.
The dam bursts and there sheltered in the arms of his best friend John finally allows himself to be human after all. For Sherlock, still passing blood, battered and bruised by his only friend and the extraordinary efforts to save him, there is a new understanding of the pain that humans can inflict on each other in the name of Love.
Several pleasant excursions had followed that might easily have passed for dates except it was patently obvious that Sherlock’s interest in Ralph Fell was purely professional, while Aziraphale didn’t go in for that sort of thing. His interest in the detective was compassionate concern in the face of his brittle loneliness, broken heart, and evident PTSD. Aziraphale’s goal was not to make Sherlock Holmes fall in love with him but to make Dr Watson jealous, although he would have been a saint (rather than an angel) not to concede that it did give his ego a little boost to be seen out with such a good-looking man.
After the reception the newlyweds depart on honeymoon while John vacations at their flat.
Anthea had done her utmost to dissuade Sherlock from this course of action but after the third month she had desisted and the car arrived without comment. Sherlock assumed that his brother arranged it, but he didn’t ask.
Sherlock was surprised at John’s reaction and said so, quite forcefully “John, you have written a sonnet for your girlfriend which, quite inadvertently I am sure, spells out Sherlock be mine as an acrostic. I know you tend not to prioritise intelligence in the attributes of a potential partner but the recipient of this poem could hardly miss what it says”
Mary continued, “Still waiting for the photographer to confirm, we got a cancellation…, just need John to get his finger out about the honeymoon… oh… and sort the flowers.”
Take a woman who is not a housekeeper and a man who is not a sociopath and you find the gift of a promise, that if ever there is conceit or cockiness there will be one word – Norbury.
Mycroft inclined his head, gave his usual terrifying smile and was gone, leaving the sitting room, despite the roaring fire, feeling rather chilly.
Mrs Hudson stopped in her tracks and stared at her tenant in amazement “Sherlock you made a Christmas joke, what on earth has got into you?”
“Go on.”
******
“But am I right?”
Crowley concluded that the detective was at his most attractive to Dr Watson when he was detecting, so the demon closed his computer and went out to find him a crime.
“You didn’t, rough night for me too”
“That’s what I said.”
“Chinese? I know an excellent one round here.”
coming from Mrs Hudson’s iPod, Sherlock was teaching John to waltz.
Sherlock outlined the case for the Inspector, from the first visit from Richard Hilton-Cubitt to the last email that had brought him and John to Norfolk. He explained his methods of analysing the dancing men symbols and how his knowledge of the behaviour of English vocabulary had allowed him, by a process of elimination, to decode the messages. “Of course, I was delayed by the fact I was not aware that Patrick Hilton had a different first name, Dr Watson’s discovery was key to solving the whole mystery.”
The celebrant and his clerk were setting up their paperwork. Sherlock went over and spoke to him and then came back. John glanced at his watch; it was three minutes past two. At that very moment, the doors behind them opened and the string quartet started up
“I would but I can’t speak for her,” Crowley replied. “I’m a demon, not a mystic.”
“Another one?”
Abe Garvey sank to his knees with a deep groan and bowed his head as if in prayer. For ﬁve minutes he was silent. Sherlock looked at the inspector and then at Garvey, “Shall we take this somewhere more suitable, and perhaps Inspector you should at least read him his rights.”
They watched in silence, Sherlock bolt upright, eyes fixed in concentration trying to absorb the details of the film in case John questioned him afterwards, while John, who had seen it twice before anyway relaxed on the couch. Relaxed rather too well it seemed; while the interview hadn’t been taxing the travelling and the intensity of the day had been exhausting and soon he was struggling to keep his eyes open. To the extent that at first John didn’t hear Sherlock when he said, “I thought he died,” and he had had to ask him to say it again.
Sherlock thought quickly, he knew London, he knew London very well, but he couldn’t think of a club near All Souls or the Langham.
A few minutes later, Crowley returned to their bench and sat down again.
“Well…”
Silently Sherlock let himself into the house and crept up the stairs, skilfully avoiding the creaky step. Bypassing the sitting room, he went straight into the kitchen where John was carrying out an inspection of their whisky tumblers.
They were making him want to sneeze, which he did, violently, three times in a row.
John was worried. He had so much to worry about he didn’t know what to worry about first. He needed to index his worries so that he could produce a list in degrees of urgency and importance, which would enable him to prioritise worrying over certain issues ahead of others. This kind of categorisation was not John’s strong point despite being a man of science himself. Sherlock would have been of great assistance with this task. Unfortunately, Sherlock was one of the main sources of worry.
“No time like the present,” Sherlock said, standing up and indicating that the consultation was at an end with a wave of his hand, “Off you pop”
Sherlock groaned, “there’s always something.”
“He was found badly wounded by the side of his dead husband.” Sherlock answered.
Now sex is off the menu, John realises he’s starving.
It is getting late, John was exhausted and common sense prevailed, he didn’t bat an eyelid when the car dropped him at Baker Street.
This was a departure from the previous verses Sherlock had discovered, it almost seemed as if John was writing the poetry himself. Why else would some of the words be struck out and replaced with others?
Janine has been leaving messages on Sherlock’s voicemail for the past hour, ever since she arrived at Baker Street and found him missing, so she’s caught on the hop when he finally answers.
“Weird. He told me if I was serious about being Head Receptionist I needed to finish my NVQ in business administration and to stop wearing Santa earrings in September, if that’s what you mean?”
“What if he thought he was? What if he regretted not taking Richard into his confidence, perhaps he thought he could have said something, done something, that might have prevented Richard’s death?”
John bent forward to throw another log on the fire. Sherlock though wasn’t finished.
“John, I have been courting you for eight years, it’s about time you made an honest man of me.”
Sherlock groaned, “There’s always something.” Then aware of Steve’s reluctance Sherlock said “Go on, tell us what you know”
John thought that googling a couple of names didn’t merit any compliments but he accepted the meaning behind Sherlock’s words. He had been missed.
Sherlock who was in a surprisingly good mood agreed without protest which rather took the wind out of his landlady’s sails. Privately Sherlock had already decided, however much he might hate it, he would have to venture out to the shops today.
“This must be an instruction, something Eddie; it can’t be WAIT because it ends in E so it must be…”
For an adrenaline addict, John Watson was remarkably predictable in his habits. He worked for four days a week as a G.P. in an NHS surgery in the centre of Camden, leaving Fridays free to keep on top of things at home. From the time he had moved back into Baker Street John’s Fridays had followed the same M.O., as long a lie in as Rosie allowed him, the online shop (such bliss never to have to tackle a chip and pin machine again!), followed by washing, cleaning, and some quality time with his daughter and whatever other occupant of 221 was available.
“Will I ever find my soulmate?”
Sherlock looked down. “I am going out shortly.”
He sat at the table defeated, only when his phone rang with an anxious Lestrade trying to track him down did Sherlock get moving. There was, he consoled himself, always The Work.
He fills another mug with tea, sweetened for shock and taking both drinks, taps gently on the bedroom door. Sherlock awake, wide eyed and fretful, the nightmare still colouring reality is both relieved and embarrassed to see John.
