“Depends on your view,” He admits after scooping up a potato and tasting it. The starch has gone soft and the flavor of the broth seems to have soaked into it.
They don’t say much else until well after a young man comes in to announce the transport will be arriving in one hour. Things get hectic again as Tony ignores everyone pleading for him to just sit and rest and instead sets off to insure that Yinsen will be coming along with them and have absolutely no issues remaining in the U.S. for as long as the man damn well pleases.
“No! I am not alright!” Tony shouts back, but the flinch Pepper gives in return sucks all the fight out of him. Sagging, he falls back down into his chair and lets his head loll back behind him. Pepper stays standing for a moment, face back to its bewilderment from before.
So, when it rolled along just five days post reveal, it took no time for them to notice the missing person. Steve considered going and finding Tony, but that morning Steve had left their conversation mid sentence because he couldn’t reconcile the sound of laughter with the memory of static. It seemed better to just give them both their space and try to get back to the old friendship some other day, let alone ever addressing the little thing they’d tried sparking before the secret came out.
“No.” His smile doesn’t even falter and she hates it. She wishes they could go back to ten minutes ago, both holding back smiles. She wishes they could skip ahead and be done with this entire conversation.
“Steve?” Tony finally responds, sounding distressingly out of breath, but the plea in it is unmistakable. There really was no way Steve would do anything other than reach out for that door knob, nowhere else he was going to go than this bedroom.
“He’s not hurt is he?” Steve asks, quickly setting aside the filled bottle and turning back towards his front door. He is not above going straight to Stark’s workshop to make sure himself. It may not be the most welcoming place, and he may have been kicked out of it on multiple occasions, but he is willing to put up with Stark’s snarking to make sure his best friend is alright. “He seemed pretty okay after the battle. I think we all made it out with minimal hits. He took off pretty quick though, so I might have mis–”
Her breathing begins to steady and she lets out a long heavy breath before letting her eyes drop down to the papers still in her hands. They are wrinkled from where her fingers tensed just moments ago, but otherwise seem fine. After another deep breath and Tony shutting off the water with an order for DUM-E to mop up the mess, she straightens up and tucks a loose hair behind her ear.
They make it to the restaurant without more hazy half memories flashing in Steve’s mind and he is familiar enough with Il Ghiottone’s to ignore the unreality at being seated in the familiar space. They sit at a table further to the back than where he always saw himself eating the pasta, but it feels more secluded and private. Plus, sitting in a new place helps pull him more firmly into the present moment and away from the fake past.
He pulls his hand free of Tony’s and steps out of the car because he wants their first kiss to be somewhere more comfortable then over the middle of Tony’s car. Tony is quick to follow him. He is still grumbling about Steve tricking him into their disagreement, but he slots himself into Steve’s side when they step into the elevator.
Tony could leave Steve up here and it would be fine. All the little pieces of their dysfunctional family would be enough comfort and Steve would never hold any of it against him.
When Tony gets him upright he lets the repulsors flicker on just a bit and runs them just over of Steve’s skin, thawing the ice and warming it in slow bursts. They’ll need to fly back to the one unruined building back where Tony stopped earlier and Steve needs to be warmed before Tony can take him through this storm.
She says it lightly, with a perfectly open and friendly smile. Yet, he shutters suddenly and looks away. The air grows heavy and thick and her hackles raise just as quickly as the investigator in her pushes insistently forward. There is something very important here.
“Camera. JARVIS can get in anywhere.” He cuts off, not wanting to hear the end of that question. Rogers is filling with awe and relief, like he knows Tony is calling because he knew the guy was feeling lonely, knew his recent outburst were making him nervous and wanted to lend some comfort. It may be true, but well, Pepper is still here and honestly, even if she wasn’t Tony still wouldn’t want any of that acknowledged.
“That’s what I said, isn’t it?” Steve reassures and Tony walks the rest of the way to the bed. He does not look away as he pulls his shirt off, nor when he lets his jeans fall to the floor. There is a hunger there in Steve’s eyes, but it is shadowed over by a gentle adoration that feels more intimate than anything they’ve ever done together.
That seems to finally get to Steve’s impossibly easy composure and he lets Tony go to stab at the biometric keypad with this thumb. The doors open immediately and they step inside before Steve speaks again, voice tight but not loud, not even really angry. “First off, I know for a fact Tasha invited you for a round of it yourself.” He turns to look at Tony head on then and Tony gets that the tightness is from sadness, resignation.
He set one mug on the side table for Steve. He took a sip of coffee. It had a splash of milk, just the way he liked it. The fact that Tony knew the way he liked his coffee made him feel warm, despite the severity of the situation. Tony couldn’t have known, but he did. Maybe he learned it during their mission debriefs. Still, the face that someone who didn’t have to keep track of such a trite, ordinary, fact, warmed him. It was like they were friends. Maybe they could be.
He didn’t know how long he stayed there. JARVIS sounded distressed, asking Steve to respond to simple questions and cues. But Steve was hardly breathing as he cradled Tony’s body to his chest. He kept feeling the pulse on Tony’s neck with his lips. He tasted bitterness in his tongue as he pressed a thumb to Tony’s wrist. Steve kissed his face, over and over again, cold and wet with tears.
“You got too good at being alone,” Carol said, and her voice sounded very far away. “Sometimes I wonder how you could love him when you hate yourself so much.”
“You’re the one who wanted their eggs, dear one,” Steve tuts, but there’s a smile on his face. He wipes his hands on his jeans and pulls Tony for a quick kiss. “The one day I don’t join you all into town…”
“Tony.” He flicked the switches open and close, summoning the courage to look into Tony’s eyes. Tony Stark made him nervous and restless.
They have Morgan until the following day, then, she’d be with Pepper for New Year’s. They’ve decided that they’ll alternate every year.
Steve was high with giddiness when they met the surrogate a few weeks later. They screened all potential candidates and made the selected surrogate sign an iron-cladded NDA and paid her a hefty sum.
It would do. Better to numb his brain rather than swim in the murky waters of loose images he couldn’t exactly remember.
Steve packed half of his clothes and some of them were the ones Tony purchased for him. There’s a metaphor there somewhere. Steve shucks off his shirt, then he’s helping Tony unzip his pants and pull it down to his ankles.
“I know.” Steve dipped his head, gathering his thoughts. Tony drove him insane. He was exuberant, full of energy, flying around the suit in circles. “You make me nervous.”
“God, Tony, stop trying to be strong for me.” Steve kissed his temple, not caring for the slob he’s wiping between their faces. “Are you okay?”
He was going to get up. He was going to roll out of bed and grab whatever bottle his hand landed on. Hopefully it would be tequila because he was not in the mood to be somber. He was going to wash his sobriety with the rest of his sins, and then maybe he’d forget the fact that he failed his country, failed his team, failed Steve.
His brain worked at an incredible speed, yet it only led him to these maudlin thoughts. It should be better. He should be able to compartmentalize, determine the next course of action in this pedestrian life of his. Tony laid there, paralyzed by his inability to digest the influx of information Extremis was sending him. Memories, thoughts, all ugly and jagged, like a shadowed past he was unable to hide.
“Tell him yourself. That man’s gonna come knocking down your door now he knows where you live. At least for the next few days.” Her laughter echoes down the hall. “Goodnight. If you need anything, I’ll be downstairs, but my shift is ending in an hour, so don’t bother me after.” She gives them a cheeky grin as Tony closes the door.
He still wakes too early in the morning, right as the sun rises. With the serum, he really doesn’t need much sleep. Sometimes, he’d rather be up, driving borrowed cars, drifting from one village to another, bearing witness to life after the Snap.
I think of our galaxy and the hubris of empire and  the promise of salvation. I used to be a warrior once.
Tony turns to a closet behind his desk, rests his hand on the keypad, and pulls the knob to reveal the shield.
There's nothing here but savagery. A man who wears Steve' face, who has the same arch of his back, the exact copy of the mole on Steve's forearms.
The colors of the sky turn into a hazy, pale pink hue. A patch of thick clouds interrupts the picturesque imagery, and slowly, the blue descends until the sky is black and grey, a curtain lit only by the distant stars.
“I was traveling too. Doing what I can to make up for all the things I've done. All the damage I caused. Repenting." Bruce stops and plucks a handful of rosemary. He turns them over for Steve to smell. "But for what," he continues, a crease on his face. "For being alive? I can't help what I am, but I can do something in the world, right?
Steve stares at Tony’s flushed cheeks, the dried spit on his beard. Steve wishes he could see the long lashes framing Tony’s eyes. He pulls his fingers from Tony’s hole and presses them to Tony’s mouth.
Steve’s eyes stung with pride, affection, and the pang of loss he feels every time he looks at Peter. He’s grown these last two, three years. Taller, but not by much. He might take after Tony’s stature. There’s more definition in his shoulders and his chins getting prickly with soft hairs. “Sometimes it’s hard to look at you, kid. I see him, and the knife twists. Sorry, Pete, it’s unfair to say that.”
He rolled his eyes and dropped the drinks on the table with a bang. He grabbed one and finished it off even if he couldn’t get drunk.
Steve punches my face. My shoulder. My stomach. When I’m on the ground, he kicks me repeatedly. I don’t beg. I don’t tell him to stop. Maybe I’ll die this time.
He headed back to the kitchen, scrubbed the sink, then the ground floor’s bathroom. By then, everything in the common areas were clean and there was no use in denying the inevitable.
Tony wasn’t going to think about how she got him out of a conversation with Sunset Bain and if it wasn't for Firebrands, he might have tried to hold her hand. Maybe he should have left her alone that first time, rejected her quick offer for help and the easy comfort that came with her presence.
“That’s Rogers-Stark to you,” Tony pinched Steve’s side with a mock-glare. “I’ve settled down long ago, baby, with this gorgeous man named Steve.”
Steve tries to breathe through his teeth, but it’s hard because it feels like he’s been punched in the gut with his own shield. And then he falls, falls like he’s being pushed by no enemy, no villain, no one but himself.
“We just have to go through it, Steve. We can’t predict how we’ll feel until we get to that moment.”  Natasha linked their arms and led him out of the Compound.
Tony swallows, around Steve’s fingers, and bites them as they withdraw. “Isn’t that what you wanted?”
I can’t fucking do this without you. You were the one that was supposed to be in charge. You’re the only one who could do this. I’ve tried. I really did. I committed. And shit, look where I am now.
The shirt soon follows, and then Steve’s bearing his broad chest, the painting of the Hydra symbol illustrated across his sternum. Its tails curl around Steve’s nipples.
Silence embraces them, and Steve stands there, waiting for direction. He twists his fingers, then stops, annoyed with himself. He breathes out, tries again. “Do you need help with anything? Anything I can do?”
“I’m sorry,” Steve offers, wishing he could pull Tony close and tell him everything will be alright. One day, he might. “I’m assuming that’s not the first time someone tried to put something in your drink.”
Harley followed Tony around in the workshop and around the house that Tony got into the habit of calling him Shadow.
He follows the child’s gaze back to the sea, forces on the smell of the ocean, and takes his time eating after realizing that there’s no hurry to get to the port because there’s no next mission to lead. He chews slowly, watching the child, wondering who he’s supposed to be now.
Some old fool visited me a while ago. Uatu sees the universe and all its possibilities. He showed me something. Us. What we could have been. There were so many moments we could have done better. I tried my best. I did. I did.
be more. Easter. Birthdays. Shit, even mundane things like Open House and parent-teacher conferences. Fucking parent-teacher conferences where I have to sit
“Darling, this is the West. You’re already in the frontier.” He falls back on the cushions and lies low, patting the space beside him. It lies down, and Tony can almost pretend it’s Steve. It turns, places a hand on Tony’s waist, and looks at him with Steve’s eyes. It’s nearly in tears, the poor creature. “In the west, men are brittle when the gold runs dry. It’s been gone a long time.”
They spent the entire day staring at Peter in awe. Everytime he blinked, Steve and Tony looked at each other and said, “Did you see that? So cute.”
Steve tried to follow Harley, but Peter blocked his path. “Pops, you should let him go. Just let it go, alright? The more you chase and push him, the more he’ll run away.”
They have a newborn baby and two other children waiting for them at home. Fuck, what was Steve going to tell them? Peter’s six and brilliant. Steve couldn’t explain what cancer was. They’d probably ask him about cell division and the human body as an attempt to comprehend the state of their father’s—Tony’s—life.
“It’s too presumptions of me to ask you to, yeah.” Tony eyes the strands of hair curling against Steve’s ears. That usually happens after he stripped the cowl back. Even now, Tony wants to run his fingers through it.
He stands quickly, catching himself on the side table, and he stumbles to the window. Red Wolf waves from down from the ground floor.
Tony’s knees begin to ache, but no matter, he works hard on trying to get Steve off. Steve tugs at his scalp, shifting away and popping his glistening cock out of Tony’s mouth. “Spit,” Steve heaves, abs flexing. There’s that glint of challenge in his eyes, a reminder of how just earlier, Tony spat on his face. “Spit on me.”
Condominiums, brick apartment buildings, low-cost housing in the middle of the city. Abandoned ranches and farms all across the world, with no body to tend to its dusting foyers. Nobody to turn the heat up, light a fire, and call it home.
The temptation of whiskey is elementary. Easy to walk across town and demand a couple of shots, but he won’t.
Tony sat back and mustered the courage to look at Steve. Beautiful and larger than life itself. Tony was willing to tear them apart if it meant keeping Steve alive. He’d failed that too, apparently.
Steve is smiling. “I knew coming home would calm me down. I think you’re the only one who can do that.”
“Another Sam Cooke song,” Tony observes, looking up at the ceiling and pressing his hands against the table.
“He could have called.” Clint’s mouth twisted into something sour. He perched on the edge of Natasha’s desk with a folder on one hand. “Let us know how he is, though.”
Tony follows the order, rocking his dick on Steve’s stomach. The first drop is warm, gooey, and tastes absolutely nothing, which is very much like Steve. The spit drips from Steve’s mouth unhurried, languid, and Tony groans when it hits his tongue again. Steve smiles, a little upturned curl. Tony would follow that curve anywhere. Except. Well.
Steve watches the condensation drip from the glass, like tiny tears falling. He drinks, sips, and doesn’t bother looking at the menu. He isn’t hungry, but he should eat. There’s a slight pang in his stomach, but it’s easily ignored. It’s all fuel for his body at the end of the day. He drinks until the last drop, then shortly, another beer is set, the empty glass taken away.
“Tony!” Steve pulled his hair, a reaction to Tony slipping off from his cock to bite the insides of his thighs.
“You’ve kinda been an asshole, Steve.” Carol took two of the drinks and passed one to Pepper. “No offense.”
“Uh, my head hurts.” Tony crawled into bed with a groan. “I swear, I’m gonna need prescription glasses because my left eye has gotten a lot more blurry this past year.”
Steve is happy for the teams, delighted, really, that the Compound isn’t in ruins, that it’s never seen a battle, that their home hasn’t become a warzone. But all he hears is that he isn’t needed.
“Alright, alright,” Steve nodded, catching his reflection. His eyes were bloodshot, but that’s normal for him these days. Maybe he’d never stop crying. Maybe he’d never stop mourning.
He didn’t stop the sob that escaped him. Steve could barely see. His vision was blurry with tears. He got to the showers based on muscle memory.
You’d laugh. If you were alive. The Registration. It’s all gone, washed out and dry. Osborn wants to be called Commander, like he’s worth a damn. Like he’s half the man you are. I’ve learned long ago that no one can measure up to you.
The structure of the outdoor shower is spartan but the materials they used are indulgent. Tony Stark is still Tony Stark, and he’s used to the best things in life. Steve wants nothing more than to give him that. He built a small little bridge by the entrance, which lies open to reveal the deep ivory sink. He has a variety of scrubs placed on the counter to brush off the dirt from his finger nails.
Steve didn’t want that. He could do this, dammit. Hadn’t he been doing well? He cooked for his kids every fucking morning after running ten miles. He doted on them, reminded them they were loved, and that their parents loved them. Told them stories, wished them goodnight and sweet dreams, and promised them that they’ll be alright.
“Of course, this is where I belong, baby.” Tony hummed, smiling at Steve from the mirror. They stayed there for a moment, content, before they followed their morning routine. They brushed their teeth together then Steve tossed his sweaty running shorts in the hamper. He got into the shower, and this morning, Tony slid the doors open and hugged Steve from behind.
Would Steve become anything other than his love for Tony? He didn’t realize until Tony’s death how much his life circled around this tiny universe, in the speck of it all, named Tony Stark. Maybe it was wrong to anchor your entire personhood to just two identities: father and husband—no, widower now.
“Steve.” Tony pawed at his head and pulled him for a bruising kiss. “Please, fuck me, harder, baby. I’m going to be home late. I want you to fuck me hard so I feel you all day. So, I’ll think of you all, day.”
When Steve returned from Strange's healing community in Savage Mountain, Red Wolf insisted that Steve take back the badge. Steve, decent and admirable, shook his head, gave Red Wolf a gun, and called him Sheriff.
It didn’t matter. He was beside Tony. Their shoulders touched. He could smell Tony’s hair—sweaty, bloody, with a touch of antiseptic.
Steve sat on the patch of grass and breathed in the smell of New York mixed with the carnation and the acidic taste of loss. He picked up the flower hoping more would grow as he continued to tend the garden. Once the carnations and jasmines were in bloom, he’d make another crown, drop it on the wicker chair.
Steve tells him he is catatonic, nearly unmanageable in his mania. How he tried to rip his shackles with useless fingers that wouldn’t stop shaking. How he spat on the officers, cursed the scum they are, and broke his nose trying to push off another guard. How Tony dropped to his knees and sobs, slobber and snot falling off his mouth and nose.
In the morning, Tony walks up alone in bed, and he lets out a sob. The sheets are sticky with their spit and come. His pillow is wet with tears. Then, he hears the shower turn on, the humming from the bathroom. Steve’s still here.
He opened the case and gave Tony the files he smuggled out of SHIELD. Fuck Fury and whatever he has to say, Tony deserved to know.
“Sing too. For me, if you want.” Steve says, burrowing further into the settee, abandoning the completed Irish poetry book to stare at Tony. “I sure do love hearing you hit those harmonies, even when you’re so drunk you can’t see straight.”
He pushed Morgan’s hair back, rocked her side to side until she fell asleep with tears like train tracks on her face. The team stayed quiet, engaged in soft, murmured conversations that Steve couldn’t really comprehend. He heard the voices, but he couldn’t register the words. Steve couldn’t even make sense of his current predicament.
Tony took off the knitted cap, dropping it to the floor as Steve lifted him in a bridal carry. Steve climbed the stairs to the rooftop, content to have Tony in his arms. Tony didn’t look fragile under the sun. He was still strong, sturdy even with his gaunt cheekbones and the lack of redness on his lips. His eyes were still bright and shining. That’s all that mattered.
“I do have one request. How about your arrangement of Danny Boy?” Steve gives him a small smile, almost shy. There’s no reason for sheepishness, not after everything now. There’s a patch of hair curling behind Steve’s ears. Tony had the urge to stand and push it back, twirl Steve's lock around his finger tips.
He looks at the window. The moon is high again, and how many times did they share an evening in bed wrapped around each other?
He shakes himself and works on the task of making Tony come. Steve shifts down, removing the cock ring—gentle and slow—watching the swell and bob of his cock, rock hard. For him. For
“Look, I appreciate all of you checking on me and the kids. But it’s getting to the point we’re feeling smothered.”
The sun is climbing high. The bedside clock flashes a few minutes after eight. Outside is a picturesque small town: vintage-looking shops with paint peeling on the corner posts. An antique looking mailbox sits near a bright fire hydrant. The exposed brick walls across the street have ivy weaving over the terrace across the street.
“You didn’t come here to talk about that. You don’t listen, Steve. I’m tired of trying to talk over you.”
Samuel whips out a John Players Silver. "A friend crossed through months ago and left me a carton," Samuel says by explanation. He flips the lid and offers Steve a stick.
His chest ached like getting slammed with a repulsor to the chest. He cleared his scratchy throat, smiling when Harley and Morgan scrubbed at his face. He turned to Peter with blurry vision. His head felt so heavy. “He loves you. Always remember that, please.”
“I don’t know. I’m so. I’m so sorry. I don’t know. But we will.” He kissed the top of Morgan’s head.
She’s nursing a large mug, and from the short distance between them, Steve can smell its contents. It isn’t coffee.
Tony walks back with his hands in his pockets, still wearing the same clothes from earlier. Steve smiles when he sits back, and they’re careful not to touch, even their feet don’t meet under the table.
Natasha laughs. “It’s too easy to do that. To have it easy. Why do you think we’re still here? Because we can’t live with the fact that sometimes it could be easy. We don’t know how.We just don’t.” Then, more somber, she shakes her head and confesses, “ I don’t know who I am without this family.”
“Take your time, it’s fine,” Tony replies, turning to his side. He blinks at Steve, almost like he’s stunned to see Steve still standing there.
“It wasn’t easy. Battle after battle. The Hulk inside. But maybe that monster’s just part of me, something I’m learning to live with.”
Sometimes Steve doesn’t have to explain himself, and sometimes they don’t prod. They just sit in this aged granite observing the lake from where they sit cross-legged. It’s an arresting sight.
I just poured a bottle of Black Label. It’s easy to dip a finger and run the liquid on the rim. Easy to put it on my lips too. Just a taste. Not too much. No, I won’t do it. Already did. Sorry. Sorry, goddamnit, sorry.
There’s a bedpan in the corner of the cell. No showers. Steve still fucks him even when he hasn’t been washed in days. Sometimes he relents and one of the guards enter the cell and hose Tony down like the animal he’s become.
Steve kisses Tony’s shoulder, follows the line of his neck with bruising, wet kisses, sucking and marking his husband. Tony groans, pulls Steve by the hair to press their mouths together. Their cocks are lined up, and Tony works on getting them off, squirming his hips and saying,
“How about we don’t keep it a secret? I want to tell the world that you're taking my last name.” Tony smiled so wide, his eyes were crinkled. He laughed and pulled Steve up for a kiss.
Steve swallowed, nervous that every day—every time Tony looked at him with soft eyes felt like a goodbye. “Tony. We’ll have more breakfasts like this. We will, okay?” He inched back, feeling the heat on Tony’s forehead. His temperature seemed normal, if not a little cold, but with being immuno-compromised, Steve worried. “I’m almost done, sweetheart. You alright to wait here for a few minutes?”
“The report from JARVIS stated that Mr. Stark had a seizure while in the air.” The doctor, Chang, consults her tablet and pulls out an MRI. They’re pointing at Tony’s brain, say something important, but Steve just observed his husband frown and nod at the information.
“I want dad back.” She repeated the words over and over again until she finally passed out from exhaustion. “Please.”
The room is quiet, but if he focuses, he can hear the static of the matching tv across the room. The channel is local; the news anchor talks about a festival two towns over unveiling a monument listing the names of those that disappeared from their county.
Tony is sunkissed. Steve can tell even if he doesn’t have his shirt off, even under the moonlight. His arms are tanned in an olive tone, and they’re toned, showing his hard work in the lab. Steve would know, he’s read all the articles on Tony Stark, even the ones from the gossip rag magazines. He even had his local library order articles Tony published.
He got the kill shot and the media broadcasted it live. Those damned hacks, they could have died flying their stupid helicopter out there in the line of battle. But whatever sells, right? They seized the fucking Tower, too. Osborn says that Tony Stark has been infected with a Skrull virus and all his decisions as Director are shit. Osborn tells the media that I tried to negotiate with the Skrulls. That I knew beforehand.
“What did you come here for then?” His chest grew tight and there was that feeling of bile rising up his throat again.
Steve moved again, pushing his hips up as Tony grounded down. Panting, Steve pulled at Tony’s dick until he came with a loud moan. Tony grabbed his come from Steve’s stomach and brought it to his mouth, sucking and cooing at the taste.
There were aliens and gods from other realms, yet Steve couldn’t make a deal with a fallen angel to switch places with Tony.
A finger breaches him, soaked with spit. Steve presses in and out, scissoring him open. He adds another, there’s a fumble behind him, and cold, lubed fingers pressing back in.
He gets dressed and checks out of the motel. He smokes and checks his phone. There’s his sparse exchange with Natasha that dates six months back, but other than that, there’s no new messages, no missed calls.
Riri waves her fork at Steve, mouth full of food. “Well, you’d know, if you know, called once in a while, checked in. People do that now. 21st century, you can connect in an instant, but you didn’t —“
Steve makes him drink another full glass of water before he’s satisfied. He rubs his cock through his trousers.
Steve’s mouth is sour, but I don’t complain because at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter. He’s him; I’m me; and we’ll both still be here in the morning. Steve leads the kiss and I follow him through the ride. It’s like flying. If I stop thinking, if I stop documenting his expressions, his likes and dislikes, then I’ll be fine.
Peter announced himself with a sigh. He sat on the wicker seat, all the green vines in the background climbing the walls frame him. “You should work on it again. He’d like that.”
He phoned the receptionist with shaky fingers, holding the receiver between the muscle of his neck and shoulder. His other hand was still stapled and he was learning to appreciate the way the distal phalanges curved, like a quirk of a familiar smile. Only, he didn’t remember what smiling felt like. Pride didn’t even make him smile anymore.
He made his way down the workshop and pressed his hand on the access bar. Inside the workshop, he sat on the sofa, scrubbing a hand through his head with a heavy sigh.
“But he died in the war!” Tony stops short, realization dawning into him. “Are all the dead coming back?”
Tony passes Riri and pushes her back to reach for another pan, then a plate. They all have their stations. They’re used to the movement of each other’s bodies and gauge how much space to take on the counter. It’s eerily similar to being in the battlefield with the smooth ways they work around each other, tossing fruit into each other’s awaiting mouth.
and Steve was just completely, overwhelmingly adorable. He was so different from how he usually was: the tense, disciplined alwayslookingoutforeverybodyelse Captain America. Now he seemed more like the boy Tony had seen photographs of, the boy Steve used to be before they jacked him up on Super soldier juice. He looked slightly embarrassed but happy and loose, almost relaxed; and the tears had started to dry. Victory.
Darcy sighed dreamily as the song ended and turned to put it on repeat, and Steve gritted his teeth and nearly screamed into the couch cushion.
Steve tensed for a moment, then moved his head away to peer down at him, brows furrowed; his baby blues seemingly liquid in the low light. When Tony just grinned sheepishly and shrugged Steve’s features relaxed and he gripped Tony’s chin with his thumb and index finger, nuzzling his cheek and yeah this was quickly racing up to the top on Tony’s Best Things Ever- list, right above coffee and Black Sabbath's greatest hits.
The last notes of the song rang out and another oldie started playing. Steve dragged Tony up on his feet and turned him to wrap his arms around him, and then Tony was enveloped by
He moved to usher Darcy off the floor and away from the stereo. She grunted in a way that Tony had quickly learnt in Darcinian meant basically ”Fine, but fuck you.”
he was only dimly aware of the third because it managed to rock his entire body. He opened a bleary eye to search for potential onlookers but Clint was snoring peacefully on the other couch and Darcy seemed to be too close to the speakers to hear him.
Tony tried an easy and slow mash between a modern jive and something of a waltz, sticking to basic moves and made sure to keep it as stupid and goofy as possible; and Steve, ever the elegant super-human, was infuriatingly quick to catch on, following Tony’s lead in an upsettingly graceful manner. He still had a few tears on his face and the embarrassed smiles altered with choked of sobs and tiny hiccups.
His head throbbed in time with the mulling pain in his chest, only amplified by the asgardian alcohol burning holes in his veins. It was the same pain he had felt every second of every minute of every day since he was rescued from the ice.
Steve’s laugh was quickly turning addictive and Tony felt obligated to keep the Captain laughing because yes, more of that, always more of that. He grabbed his hands and worked their arms back and forth in beat with the trumpets going
“What’s going on, J?” Tony put his visor up and his blowtorch down, drawing up a hologram feed from the common room, scanning the image with a sinking feeling in his stomach.
. But Steve was smiling, and laughing and lookingyt   soft and happy and Tony’s heart swelled at the sight.
“I’m serious, I mean the song is a bit after your time but it’s still pretty damn old.. I mean relatively.. should be right up your alley,” Tony grinned at him “and you need a dance, that much is obvious.”
“You stopped and smiled at me and asked if I cared to da-a-ance, I fell into your open aaarms,” Tony sang with the words and turned to jokingly fall against Steve’s arms looking up at him, “and I didn't stand a chance!”
Above all though is Steve’s mouth. His hot, delicious, wonderful mouth moving in rhythm with Tony’s. His teeth are biting, the fierce pressure of skin on skin bruising and breath stealing and so good, so fucking good. Everything before pales in comparison to what is happening now, doesn’t hold a fucking candle to the absolute frenzy they are composing between them.
“I’m sure, I am very very sure.” Tony promises, speaking through a throat that suddenly feels tight. This is going to be something much more than getting off together and Tony can’t understand how he ever did this with anyone but Steve. He wants Steve to see all of him, to see how his body works and how it feels good. He wants to see how Steve reacts to his touch, how his face twists when he gets close. He wants to kiss Steve through his climax and hold him after and, holy shit, it’s so powerfully amazing. “I’m so fucking sure.”
“Doctor Banner.” Steve greets, putting the name and face together once the doctor has his glasses back on his face. The man starts a little at the greeting, but manages to shakes Steve’s hand as they all go through introductions. A screen flickers on to Romanov’s left and they all turn to silently watch as Fury talks to Loki. Throughout the viewing Steve is more focused on the sensation of the casing removing itself from Stark than what Fury is saying. It’s not the first time he feels thankful for the memory advantages provided by the serum.
The real kicker of it all, though, is for all Tony is brimming over with wants, he is also so perfectly content. He could spend the next ten years doing nothing more than laughing into a kiss with Steve. They could go the rest of their lives without Steve ever daring to dip his hand lower and Tony wouldn’t mind. If he can get nothing but these happy kisses, he honestly will be satisfied.
Tony is giving him another one of those intense stares and Steve remembers the first time he sat in that Audi, remembers Tony in this same outfit picking it out for the exact reasons Steve chooses it now. He’s never been in that car before, never ridden in anything but a limousine with Tony Stark.
“Look, Cap.” Tony starts, and his hand comes up to cup Steve’s cheek. It burns and feel so sweetly perfect Steve could live in this position forever. Using the hand to guide his face up, Tony forces him to lock their gazes. He looks so wrecked, eyes brimming over and face tight in pleading sorrow. It makes Steve angry, at what he cannot be sure. “I wanted to, I did. I just–”
“It’s a hard holiday for the lonely.” Steve admits and it may not be the right secret, but it feels like a confession all the same. Without hesitation, Tony softens, lets out all his tension in a breath and resolves to be whatever Steve needs.
“Jesus Fuck,” He mutters when he clears out the ice that formed over Steve’s face and sees the blue of that perfect upper lip. Any other man would be frozen by now and Tony needs to take Steve somewhere tropical like yesterday. Needs to stop thinking about how panicked Steve must have been as the cold started to settle into his skin.
Steve takes a long swallow and coughs again before setting the mug down on the little wooden bedside table. He does not turn to look at Tony, but continues speaking. “There was a guard that caught sight and got the alert up before I could get ‘em. I managed to get about ten before I went down over the cliff. Lost my bike somewhere down there. When I woke up I was alone, no water, half the suit torn and I was freezing.” He pauses, looking down at his bare hands like somehow they will take over the story telling for him.“I could barely move.”
All his focus is on Steve’s face, on his bright sunny blue eyes, his plump rubbed red lips, his grin. God, his grin is so bright and Tony’s knees go weak. He can’t help himself, he really can’t, because Steve just looks so happy, so delighted by making out in the doorway.
“I recall something about water into wine, wine into blood or something. Am I wrong?” Tony gets a snort for that and can’t help but laugh a bit himself. The full glass gives him something to fiddle with, a nice little temptation to torture himself with instead of the bow of Steve’s top lip.
His eyes are glassy, but his smile is all warmth. Tony feels it like a bristle draggin up his throat, like a warm cup of tea in the middle of december.
“Hey,” He whispers when he stands close enough to brush the fringe of Steve’s hair off his forehead. It’s gotten long, but something about it and the new beard suit him. Tony decides not to say anything about it.“Can you eat a bit of this for me?”
“That’s only less generic than asking what I’m wearing.” And God there is that wonderful huggable embarrassment. For a wall of muscle the guy really embodies like a confused puppy.
“I thought you just wanted to kiss me.” Steve says softly, cutting Tony off mid stroke. His grin is cheeky, clearly pleased to have Tony so focused on petting his hair.
Before bed on the first day he found a sock under the couch, some thin and silky thing that looked more expensive than anything he ever wanted to own. The afternoon of the second had him looking through his nightstand for one of the bookmarks Iron Man bought him only to find a tattered and dog eared paperback. It looked vaguely familiar, but he could say with absolute certainty he did not put it in there. There is a set of miniature screwdrivers left half open and discarded in one of the kitchen drawers and two coffee mugs he’s never seen before in the cabinet above the sink.
They both flinch a little at the name and then meet eyes in some silent consoling gesture. Tony doesn’t really think he deserves to have it returned, Pepper actually spent time with the man, but the loss still hit him hard. He liked Agent–Phil. There was something nice about his straight man routine and deadman humor that clicked with Tony’s own. He regrets all the lunches and meetings he shoved off on Pepper, wishes he’d given more of his time.
“Mama!” Tony’s eyes are wide as her nails dig into the sides of his little arms to drag him fully away from the fireplace. She feels the tears rush up in her eyes, but cannot stop them as she continues to plea to any deity that will listen.
"I get it.” Tony says after a long time. Long enough that his voice feels tight and rough. Steve does not stir, continues to be a smooth weight against Tony’s arm. Perhaps he is sleeping and perhaps that is what drives Tony to continues. “I mean, there isn't a way to explain just how cold space is, it isn’t even freezing. Sometimes I wake up and I feel like there isn't any air. There isn't any water or wind or anything and I don't even feel cold. I just feel numb, like I'm spinning away without a tether because it is so cold I can't feel anything anymore."
“What?” He says without thinking, but decides the sentiment is certainly warranted. Iron Man never turns down a match while he is in the tower. Even when he’s busy he will tell Steve when they will be able to meet up. He’s never just, not been available with no explanation.
Steve knows Tony Stark for all of twenty minutes when he figures out there is something decidedly different about the man. Certainly, the idea that Stark is anything but normal occurs to him long before their less than stellar introduction. Even if the man’s file hadn’t made it quite clear how out of the box he was, the sudden jarring music vibrating through the air as a glowing suit of red and gold comes flying down upon him would have clued Steve in. Still the extent, the sheer enormity of how unique this explosion of a person is, really hits after they subdue Loki and make it onto the jet Romanov pilots.
“Something about, something… someone?” Rhodey responds, rather eloquently considering he says it around the rim of the over large coffee mug that’d been the only clean container with which to consume their box of wine. Another bit of limp neck finagling and Tony is facing him again, his eyes are squinted but it’s too unfocused to be called a glare.
"Yeah, sometimes.” Steve starts, still looking at Tony. There is a pause and then a sigh and the soldier looks away. His voice is smaller when he finally continues.“Sometimes, I wake up and I feel like I’m- I feel cold."
Steve shuffles back and lifts the edge of the three wool blankets up enough for Tony to slide in under them. The bed is larger than a normal twin, but Steve is huge and leaves little space for Tony to fill. After a moment of shuffling, the end up pressed chest to chest, face to face with Steve’s arms wrapped around Tony and Tony’s pressed up into the cavern between their bodies.
“Stark.” Steve says when he comes to stand next to the man. For all he seems to be absorbed in his reading, Stark does not startle at the interruption. Instead he simply looks up and locks there eyes together. They are the exact brown Steve pictured for Iron Man and so stunning he nearly spills the mug of coffee on himself.
Before he can even begin to come up with some method for blind lip reading an impossibly heavy object crashes into Stark's chest and Steve feels his own breath catch in sympathy. The man goes down, but jumps up quick enough only to collide with the wall again. It's when Steve lurches through the trees after unlatching from his parachute that he realizes the wall must be their jail breaker. He hops from branch to branch until finally hitting the ground with no more than a small thump. His chute is tangled in the canopy above him, but a sudden ache in Stark's hands pulls his attention away. Something is surrounding and closing in all around both of his hands, in thick lines that curl around his fist. It must be the gauntlets, somehow crushing in on themselves. Steve picks up his pace and lets the tether guide him.
Tony looks up at her then, his eyes are a little wide and it seems he’d been intent enough to not notice the drop in volume or the clack of her heels. For a moment they both stare at each other and it takes nearly all of her will power to hold back a snort, but that would ruin the game and really it’s so much better when Tony is the first to crack. Slowly, he straightens his back and moves the piece of red metal away from his crotch where he was holding it against himself with the hand not holding a blow torch. Thankfully the blowtorch is simply dormant in his hands otherwise Pepper may have decided on a more... insistent tone to her question.
When Natasha leaves the room, a quirked eyebrow and shake of the head as a farewell, he decides waiting here is getting ridiculous.
There is fear too. Real fear that takes him by surprise but feels like it has been bodily pulsing through him for ages. It feels too real, too close to home, too aware of itself for a dream.
He understands it then. Tony’s been missing this too. All those looks, all that pain and sorrow when Steve walked away from him. Tony knew what they were to each other and Steve left him alone, Steve abandoned him. It took him over a month and a half to figure it out and even then it was Tony that got them here. Tony asked him out, Tony got Steve to kiss him, Tony did it all not knowing if Steve would ever come back to him.
Part of him wants to have Jarvis pull up all surveillance available, just so he could know what on earth the man is doing. It seems unfair to be bombarded with all the conflicting and overwhelming emotions without having any clue of the causes. During the battle, it had not been so bad. In fact, knowing the sudden spikes of fear and determination actually helped them maneuver together. When Rogers felt panicked, Tony could immediately sweep in to lend a hand. When he seemed to radiate sadisfaction, Tony could fly off to pummel new targets.
“You think you can handle it?” She asks after nodding at the information. Her eyes are kind and understanding, she was the one to call him in after all.
“The change in everyone’s behavior began twenty three seconds post this recording. There was also a large energy outpouring from one of the artifacts recovered in Athens at roughly the same time. However, no other wishes were able to replicate those readings.”
“Hey, Steve?” Tony says, licking at his bottom lip before turning his eyes away and rubbing an oil stained hand up against the grain of his scalp. It makes Steve long to do the same, but he presses his hands into the spine of his sketchbook instead.
Pepper stares at him in bafflement and it takes until they are out of the conference centers parking lot for her to finally speak. “What is going on? I am more lost than I think I have ever been in all my time working for you and I was here during the Tokyo debacle.”
He follows the teather back, picks up his steps when he feels Starks whole frame tighten and puff up in something like satisfaction. Stark speaks, something with an ‘F’ sound closed off with an ‘S’ and followed by a short word ending with his mouth in the faint persed shape of an ‘O’. Steve manages to hear the sound of that little word ending and pushes through the thick door. Stark and Fury turn to him and he slams the gun down on the table with no preamble.
The hat is rather nice to have, as his morning ruminations got him running with the sun much higher in the sky than usual. When he passes the old Italian restaurant, he crosses the street and resolutely refuses to look at it.
“I’m not doing anything important.” He says to save the poor kid from his useless attempts at sentences, still huffing out breathy half laughs all the same. “Just doing my yearly quota of work for the senior center. Calling them up, making sure they aren’t lonely, that sort of thing.”
“You didn’t tell me.” Steve replies and for all it comes out a statement, he means it as a question. Tony never told him, he knows that with perfect certainty. There are no hazy memories to contradict it either. Still, he knew somehow, knew in a way that went beyond subconsciously putting together clues. For all those clues seem blatantly obvious now, he never noticed them before.
Steve blinks at him and a thread cuts, tumbling them back into the present moment. His focus shifts and he looks down at the pile on his lap, covering the feet he’s tucked up under himself. Tony finally feels free to move and starts to make a very hasty retreat, when Steve looks up and locks him in place again. "I had a nightmare."
“You’re something else, Tony.” Steve whispers into Tony’s neck, body still limp over him like the world’s most wonderful blanket.
“So good, so fucking stupid good.” Tony promises, grin so large it might just end up splitting his face in two. He can’t stop chuckling. He feels dizzy with the euphoria of being this close to Steve, of having this memory of them splayed, with pants half off, across Tony’s too expensive couch.
"Steve, just.” It takes a little maneuvering, but Tony gets himself tucked shoulder to shoulder with Steve and all the layers draped over both of them. “Just, let me, okay?"
“It was– I don’t know if it really happened.” Stark starts, spinning in his stool. His movements are fluid and nothing but the slight lilt to his words signal to his inebriation. Back to her and face staring unfocused out the ceiling to floor window, he swallows hard and continues. “But, back in that cave.” Another pause, her body tensing tight and mind ratcheting to memorize every single word. He’s never spoken to her about anything prior to the Iron Man announcement, just silently acknowledge that she knew all about it and moved on. She probably knew far more than Stark could ever imagine, but hearing about it straight from the horse's mouth had no equal substitution. SHEILD still had a long list of unanswered questions about the entire event and his survival of the fiery explosion was only the start of it all.
“He’s known you your whole life! How could he? That RAT bastard! What the hell could he possibly gain?!” The rage is underlined with a kind of pleading that Tony never wants to hear again.
Iron man examines him, head tilting a little more and glowing eyes completely turned to his face. Steve can practically see the eyes underneath scanning through every possible readout of his current vitals. He can’t really remember when he started thinking his eyes would be brown, but something about it feels true. Iron Man would have warm eyes, deep smile lines and long lashes.
His hands are red, eyes blurring. “It’s going to be fine. Rhodey is coming. Just hold on, just hold on, come on.” The belt is in place and Tony is ripping off the leather cuffs around his upper arm, dropping them and moving Yinsens leg into the cradle created by their previous curling. Again no hesitation, grunting and whimpering as he ties the makeshift gauze tight with string and old striped fabric. “We did so good. We are so close, I don’t-” Tony’s own gasping enters the fray, but he is standing and pulling off the leather around his knees. He is padding the largest plate of metal he can find and ripping at the exposed wiring at the arms of mach U2.1. “I don’t want to do this again, please Yinsen. We can, we can make it.” His voice is high and wobbly, but he ties the tangling braid of wires to the top end of the metal. “Hold on.”
A few times he considered pulling them out to pointlessly confirm the correct prediction of the ten rings’ movements. At least that was the reason he gave himself. Truthfully, he just wants some physical reminder that this is really happening. Every time he wakes in this place, his previous life seems further and further away and he sometimes starts to wonder if he actually left this cave. If the past eight years haven't actually been some torture fueled nightmare.
“Fine.” He’s not as good at keeping back the emotions in his voice and the dull edge of it still sticks into her side as she steps out of the workshop. The scales are forgotten and it’s not until long after all his other secrets finally come spilling out that she ever sees them again. They never do take the plunge, but years later she looks back and doesn’t regret much.
“Oh shit, Steve.” Tony groans out, eyes squeezing shut and hand faltering in its rhythm on him, grasping too tight and making him hiss into Tony’s forehead.
Steve feels Stark smiling in the other room, speaking easily with Banner and swallows. His shoulders roll back, his back straightens and he pulls his whole face into a flat focus. Out here, removed from the sharp cut of Stark’s stare, Steve can think clearly. And Stark may have been spouting nonsense to rile Steve up, but there is something genuine in his worry. Any other time, under other circumstances, Steve would have readily admitted just how uneasy those unanswered questions left him.
“I have an IQ of 4 billion.” Tony goes with, not one of his bests, but his haughty tone gets the joke across. The undercurrent gets lighter in Rogers anyways.
“Oh my god. How could, I can’t believe-” Her eyes are filling with tears as she stares at his exposed chest. She reaches out, but does not touch it before enveloping him in the hug he so sorely longed for this entire time. “Oh Tony, I am so sorry!” He lets her hold him for longer than is really appropriate for the type of relationship he is steadfastly determined to have with her. Still he is the one to pull away and he mentally pats himself on the back for the show of strength.
For the first several nights in this loop, he’d scribbled out page after page under the fading light of cooling embers. Eight year old memories, though sharpened by the location, are only so clear and he couldn’t let his advantage go wasted by the warping of time and human recollection. Originally, he only meant to focus on the movements and dates of his captivity, but late at night under the weight of the earth and his own mistakes, everything feels urgent. So on top of secretly building weaponized armor, he tasks himself with protecting a thick stack of smudging parchment. Risks losing a physical record of every name, date, time and location of any important thing that is and will be in his life.
"I go lay on top of one of my car's engines." It’s true, even before Pepper left, the rumble was like a heartbeat that never asked questions. Lately, he found himself up here more often, but when it got really bad, when is felt too silent and empty around him, when he woke up to JARVIS’s disembodied voice as the only noise he would start up one of his babies. Would lay on top of it and pretend it was someone breathing beneath him. Would sometimes pretend the whirling was JARVIS’s heartbeat beneath him.
“But, those aren’t even the weirdest things.” Steve says instead, remembering the apologetic way JARVIS told him the mission was classified. If Iron Man needs to talk about it, he will. They have built up a solid friendship over the last two years. He knows he can tell his Shellhead anything and knows Iron Man feels the same way.
She smiles gleefully in return before pulling him back from her chest, Jarvis aiding with the movement. “Let Mama see your hands.” And Tony responds immediately,  thrusting them forward so quickly she needs to blink a few times before they come into focus. The skin is a beautiful deep red and nothing at all like a burn. It shimmers with an underlay of gold and yellow making his hands seem somehow metallic and armored in the brilliant colors. As she stares down the shimmer mutes and the red recedes into a rich pink. Something about the display chills her in the way of old forgotten memories and she breathes deeply a few times before looking back into her son’s waiting eyes. Both boy and butler are looking at her in concern, but just as Tony’s little nose screws up as he registers the sent of wine on her breath she regains the moment and speaks. “Oh, it is not too bad.”
“I’ll get out first.” Rhodey answers immediately, unceremoniously climbing over Tony’s lap to do just that. Pepper and Happy raise their eyebrows but do not comment. Through the window Tony sees Obadiah move to open their door and bites back against the apparently still festering wound now pulsing at the sight of him. Before he can spend too much time on that though, Rhodey is stepping out and pulling Tony flush against his side with no regard for a single person looking at the display.
They both look away at the same time, eyes misty. Tony reaches out to squeeze her hand. He is not sure if it is more for him or not.
“I tried.” Steve hears Tony say, feels the way the words move his lips against the skin of his neck. “I tried over and over, but no one knew and I couldn’t say anything.” A shaky breath and Tony pulls back. His face is begging, apologetic and heartbroken. “I tried and nothing would come out.”
“Steve.” That’s it, that’s the only thing Tony can even think to say and, fuck, it comes out so whiny, so plaintive and needy, and Tony can’t bring himself to care. He wants Steve so bad and Steve wants him just as much.
“Shellhead?” He implores and drops down to his knees next to the hunched over man. His face is turned away and his breathing is fast and shallow. There is nothing that could stop Steve from reaching out and grabbing the metal shoulders of the suit. Turning him is easy, takes just a little shifting and no thought at all. There is blood dripping from his forehead and his brown eyes are dazed, blinking rapidly and unfocused. Steve presses a hand to his cheek and draws him in closer. Tony looks so fragile like this and Steve hates when the suit isn’t enough to protect him. He may be a fighter but he is so very human.
Steve opens his mouth to ask how something like that could have lead to the last terrible month and a half. Before he can voice his confusion, JARVIS speaks.
“It went well enough.” He says after another sip of his coffee, then leans forward to rest his face on his fist. “Got them to sign on without too much hassle.”
“Iron Man.” He looks at the face plate, knows his face must seem somber when the gauntlet slips off his shoulder and into Iron Man’s lap.
Carefully he stands, pulling Tony up along with him. They both smile when Steve takes Tony’s hand and weaves their fingers together. The width of his knuckles is familiar and solid between Steve’s, but he knows why now. He wants to always know.
Steve’s lips are open before Tony even gets there and there is instantly tongue, wet and slick and sliding everywhere. His hips are grinding up and that just makes Tony’s entire body light up like the Fourth of July. It’s just like he thought it would be, just exactly like he wanted it. Steve is so strong, so fierce, driving Tony to press in closer and closer until they can no longer be considered two separate bodies. His own arms are flung so securely around Steve’s neck that he can squeeze his own elbows.
“If you say so,” Tony agrees and lets himself believe it means something more, lets himself think Steve is holding him close on purpose.
He sighs, still at the same decision with nothing but more certainty and shame to show for the trouble. He slams his hammer down with a touch more force than necessary, but luckily the shin plate he is working on doesn’t warp past the intended curve. Setting aside the hammer, he takes a moment to press and rub at the heat pooling along his bicep. Although Tony has always worked with his own hands and arms, the strength he accumulated through years of fighting, building, and remarkably taking better care of himself, is sorely missed. The few years of youth do little to make up for the lack and it may be nothing more than a quicker loss of breath and louder grunts of effort, but he notices.
“Fine, fine.” Stark manages between a few more coughs, rubbing his chest and leaning a bit into Steve’s hand. “Just, down the wrong tube.”
He feels on the edge of a breakdown and completely convinced he is actually losing his mind when he finds the most insane thing. It is the morning of the fifth day, just yesterday he discovered that he now only owns about 8 pairs of socks instead of the near sixteen he remembers, and he is digging through the scarce pile in search of some running socks when his hand hits something solid tucked in the back corner. He starts a bit, but circles around the cube and pulls it out.
Steve is in and out of consciousness at this point, but the heavy wool blankets folded on the foot of the bed promise to speed up the warming process. He pulls them out and over Steve’s violently shivering form and the man manages a week and hazy smile.
Rogers seemed to anticipate these moves too, cluing in somehow to Tony’s own worries and reacting to his presence just before he made it to his star spangled side. They were a work of art together, some beautiful piece of machinery oiled and calibrated to perfection. It was exhilaration in raw form and Tony is scared shitless about it. This entire situation, this entire new sense of reality is honestly too much for him to handle.
“There is a set of little screwdrivers and these reading glasses.” They were in along side the paperback, but Steve only noticed them this morning when he opened the drawer to see if it was still there. They are thin and silver, only large enough to cover half the eye. He turns in his chair to face Iron Man straight on and throws his arm out, hoping to convey just how rattled this all is making him. “Where on earth would I get reading glasses and why don’t I remember getting them? I wouldn’t ever need them.”
Fury tries to back track, but Stark jumps right in with his screen of information and fighting a common goal, however small, feels so amazing. Steve’s skin is almost singing with it just as his entire body fills with gallons of weary disappointment. “I was wrong, Director. The world hasn’t changed a bit.”
With a jerk Steve pulls himself out of his thoughts and turns to grab the freshly filled mug from under the coffee maker. The gesture feels strange after all the, well, ogling Steve just partook in. Still, it feels like a nice enough ice breaker and Steve’s wanted to get to know the man better for years now. They started on such wrong footing and even after moving the whole team into his Tower, he still kept his distance.
“Alright.” Iron Man says, gauntlet resting on Steve’s shoulder. The contact feels too good for words. “What is the weirdest thing?”
Another pause and Pepper is staking up all their piles and sliding them evenly into her medieval torture device of an accordion folder. She keeps glancing over at Tony, observing his strange fiddling and jerky not quite spinning in his chair. He would probably be twirling the cord if such phones still existed and he wasn’t using surround sound.
“I’m right fucking here.” Rhodey insists, waving his hands to draw Tony’s attention back to him and away from remembering how dumb he’d looked when falling out of that very stool an hour ago. The waving turns out to be a horrible idea and Rhodey finds himself pitching forward and flat onto his stomach, face half on one of the gross pancakes.
She does not answer, uncertain if she wants him to continue the stories or if she wants to slip away and begin digging through the archives of every database at her disposal. There is a very old secret here, protected by some unknown person and nothing thrills her quite like a real, true mystery. They sit in silence, Stark gazing out at the black horizon of the Pacific and Natasha cataloguing every single nuance of the man before her.
“I don’t like it.” He says to the room at large and manages to suppress a shiver as he feels Stark turn towards him. There is a brief pause, a slacking of some coil in Steve’s chest as Stark steps closer to him and then something shifts in the other man's posture.
"Yeah.” The hand squeezes and Steve breathes in deeply, building up his chest and shifting Tony where he rests against the larger man’s shoulder.
“Not at the moment,” is all he gets in return and he feels a little spike of anxiety dig its way under his ribcage. Iron Man did take off pretty fast after making sure everyone was alright. Steve usually berated him into admitting at least some of his injuries, but the battle had been standard, so he’d let him go without the usual questioning. It felt like maybe that had been a huge mistake.
Tony takes a deep breath and Steve pulls himself out of his thoughts. “I thought, maybe it was for the best.” Tony whispers into the meat of his shoulder, almost too quietly for even Steve’s hearing to pick up. It chills him to his very core. “Maybe you’d be happier if you didn’t know I–”
Tony asks him to pick a car and Steve points to the Audi immediately. The seats are deep and Steve knows they’ll be enough leg room for him to feel comfortable. Plus this one has heated seats and it may only be october, but that is a luxury he really appreciates about the future.
“How does that not hurt?” Voice tight and only a hair shy of shrill, she wobbles forward feeling uncharacteristically uncertain in her five inch heels.
“You think you could cook?” Steve teases, smile spreading over his face slowly. It makes the room feel warmer than the stove ever could. It is the most natural thing in the world to tip forward, to press their lips together. The sigh Steve lets out fans all over Tony’s face and he breathes it in greedily, desperate for Steve’s air to fill his lungs. It lasts and last for all that it is chaste, like they are both reluctant to break the connection.
“Okay.” Steve tells him and his smile grows brighter, warmer. All the tension in Tony’s body just let’s go at that smile, all the embarrassment and uncertainty collapses under the weight. Then Steve steps forward and dips down to press a kiss on the tip of Tony’s nose. It flairs bright in his chest and Tony’s face splits open in a grin he’s sure looks a little dopey.
That is the real thing stopping him. Waking up to the visual of your own heart beating is something he hoped to only experience the one time.
The run is helpful for all of fifteen minutes, but he follows his usual trail without thinking and ends up at the door of Mrs. Basil’s Emporium. He pants, breath too heavy for the pace he set, and stands outside long enough to get a few looks by passers-by. It seems completely reasonable to step inside.
“I’m sorry. You can’t die yet.” A voice he remembers with startling clarity interrupts the panic enough that he thinks to wake up, but only manages to black out.
His eyes open again, into darkness and the sound of trickling water. There is something in his nose and down his throat, too horrible to tickle. He reaches with shaking hands and heavy breaths to pull it out, on instinct and a vague muscle memory. It feels not dissimilar to dry heaving on an empty stomachh. He gags as it rolls up, slithering and pulling. Pushing fiercely at his nose once it is out, he tries to hold out the air as it rushes into the raw membranes.
Belatedly, Tony remembers that his man served in the Army, so he announces himself. “Hey, Steve right?”
Tony holds up his mechanical arm against the late October sky. There lies his wedding band. “And yet.”
“Bacon!” Harley jumped up, clapping, but climbed into bed with care. He placed himself as close to Tony as possible and stuck his tongue out at his siblings. “I’m the favorite, ha.”
Steve pressed their foreheads together and his breath ghosted over Tony’s face. He was shaking, pulling Tony into his arms, a half-embrace that didn't work because Tony’s limbs were heavy and fucked and he couldn’t raise his arms anymore, because the pain was suddenly too much.
Sometimes, it roars, so much so it’s nearly white noise these days. Yet, there are moments tinged with joy, and blinding light. Sangre de Cristo Mountains, Tony had said, flying them over a peak of mountains, Blood of Christ.
Morgan was sitting on Carol’s lap getting her hair braided. No matter how many times Steve tried to get the dutch braids right, it always turned into a mess. Tony had been better at it.
Steve shook his head. Thinking about possibilities would drive him insane. He didn’t want that for the kids.
His foot is still on the break. It’s rather easy for him to turn reverse, the wheel left, and go west, away from the shining building, and back into the highway. He breathes out, stares at the distance.
He wants to see Tony’s face, nevermind that his eyes are obstructed. Nevermind that his eyes are the first that Steve seeks out after a battle. Nevermind it all.
Gum on the concrete and the smell of foul garbage in scorching New York summers. Sometimes, Tony thought that might be all he had left. This tiny corner in the world, an island full of people who either despised him so much they called for him to be hung for war crimes or to be  put in the category of a hero.
“Fuck if I know,” the man replies, wiping a line of sweat from his forehead. “Wouldn’t be out here  sweating and cursing if I knew how to fix this.”
Perhaps, he had assumed too quickly that they’ll fall back to old rhythms, after all, they’ve always done well as a team when there was a crisis. But now… but then…
Fucking Stark, stupid fucking Stark. He hears them, and he can’t find it in himself to stop listening to how this is all his fault. Just because he believed Steve, and he thought…
