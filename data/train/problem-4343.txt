The gathering in the large room attached to the church kitchens had been, at best, awkward and heavy. Kevin had watched his son gradually circle the room, not entirely fitting in with the younger grandchildren, or their cousins, even though Emma was only a year or two his junior, and he was very close with Melody and Jaime. He couldn't easily settle in with Kevin and Margaret's generation, as they were all too parental to him, even a few of the newer Singer employees closer to his age.
The assistant smirked slightly, "Low grade mainstream success?"
"Margaret, come on," Kevin said, rounding the end of the bar as he spoke, though she continued to speak over him as she got down from the stool.
"I wanna see her... She can keep living with you, but I wanna see her."
"It's a face?"
He had thought she was just comfortable with him, and after two years together, it should have been perfectly normal. She should have been able to let her guard down and be happy without it seeming suspicious.
The boy shrugged, "About like you'd expect. Anyway, I need to go tell my dad, she's... Actually, okay, I tried to tell him, and he didn't listen, but I think she's hurt worse than she said. She twisted it before, and didn't need pills. Can you talk to her, tomorrow, when she's awake?"
"You're not pissed?" Xander asked.
"What are you doing?" Alfie whispered.
"No... you're going to need your sleep." Kevin gave a quiet gasp as she hit a particularly sensitive spot.
Sheriff Mills put away the notepad, shooting a quick glance at Dean. "How much did they tell you on the phone?"
"Flip a coin?" Xander asked as Dean walked away.
"A few. After we get there."
"Sorry..." Dean mumbled.
Figuring the period was long enough for Claire's mood to have leveled out, Alfie scooted closer and leaned uncomfortably low to push Claire's hair back from her face and press a quick kiss to her lips. Her eyes popped open at once, and he tried to offer her an encouraging smile, but she squirmed closer and returned the kiss.
"How many stones?" Ben asked, pushing a rather bare branch out of the way.
Dean coughed, "Goddamn, I swear..."
"Okay, what about later on?"
Suddenly, Dean, still breathing hard from his effort, was looking right at him. "Hey, Cas. What's going on?"
"Thanks," Charlie said, "That guy smelled like burnt popcorn... Let me get you a drink?"
"Okay, so when you asked him, he asked about your mom, he didn't have to think about it. I'd guess, given history, he knows. And-... That I got killed?"
"Mom!" Alfie snapped.
"I'm sorry, Claire," Cas began, "But this is likely a non-event, and he did try to wake you, but-"
"Once they know, they're going to ask. And once they ask, I have to tell them, because I can't live with a big lie hanging over my head. Then, every time I see my mom, she's going to mention it, because she can't have a thought and not bring it up five times."
"Um... We were looking at the lights... was I drunk?"
He turned back to his daughter, briefly overwhelmed by her innocence and vulnerability, and suddenly the subject dropped from his mind completely. Once she was capable of speaking for herself, asking those questions, and having an opinion, Rachel would lose all interest. Claire was right. It was a matter of time before, like the bear, and like himself, Melody would be cast aside like trash.
"All the time?"
"Was she outside?" Claire asked, coming closer as Alfie hurried upstairs to Jaime's call.
"So... her mother doesn't know yet?"
"I need an oil change, and maybe some air in the tires."
"What?" Claire replied with a venomous snap.
"Or, maybe, I beat you down without knowing it. But, you know, that's the last thing I want to do... We both know you're never gonna file. So, I'm going to the courthouse in the morning, I'm not going to put you through this anymore. I love you enough to be the screw up, be the bad guy, here. I'm going to make sure you and the kids have everything you'll ever need, and when they're grown and gone, I don't care how far down the line, you need anything, ever, and I'm here, okay?"
"...can I check on that second one?"
"She won't have to," Xander said softly, not sitting up fully, but straightening his shoulders.
"It's your face."
Kevin checked that her father's car was in the driveway, rang the bell, and stepped back.
Julie was quiet for a bit before she spoke again, "So, they don't even know the party is happening, what if they don't want me there?"
"And Mom."
Alfie had already let go of her hips, cooperating as she moved away, careful not to make physical contact before getting her attention.
"But not the hospital?" Rachel prodded again.
"Yeah, but I didn't," Cynthia's voice cracked slightly, "And then he drags this guy out of the bar and leaves me standing there like an idiot, and this
"She cheated on him. It's all there in the letters, Dad. It ripped him apart, and Bobby told him not to tell Ben a word of it. But Ben's an adult now, and, I don't know, he should know, in case it's true-"
Nodding, but seemingly in a daze, Claire got shakily to her feet, and slipped out of the room before Dr Thompson could get up.
Ben crossed his arms at an odd angle as a chuckling bubbled up along with tears, and Cas couldn't tell if the tears were related to the laughter, or if stress had finally taken such a toll that he'd given in.
"I'm paying attention, you're talking over the words," Cas replied, gesturing to the television.
"I can't leave you here, and I can't drop you off with anyone, not without your mother figuring out what's going on, and if I drag you along, she'll kill me. Maybe even literally."
"What do you mean?"
"No, he'll think it's because... Look, just don't."
"No, I want your grandmother's exact recipe," Grace cut her off, "Can you do it?"
Cas carefully got to his feet, making for the kitchen, not noticing the text Lucas was sending, or the recipients who'd receive it.
"Uh-huh, listen, all I need is the oil and a rotation, maybe some WD-40 for the wipers. You think you can handle that, big guy?" Fred asked, looking down on Lucas' small,  unmasculine frame.
Claire snorted. "Go on, dad, tell him how I busted up your face so bad the office lady thought you'd been in a car accident, and then I nearly killed you with a crow bar because I thought you were going to let Dean hurt me."
"Um... what?... Oh. A uniform shirt and jeans, why, what are you...?"
"I can hold down the fort, work the desk and back here, and maybe we can get Blake to-"
"I just don't know if she's spry enough to go running after a kid with our kind of energy." Kevin replied, "I mean, she's great, she'll be an epic grandma, but every damn day?... And when he's ten, she'll be fifty-eight. Is that really fair to ask a woman in her sixties to raise a teenager as handsome and incredible as he's gonna be? She barely survived me."
"What do people wear to that kind of thing?
Dean was still sorting insurance emails, his first task of the day, usually, when a bright color caught his eye and drew his attention to the doorway. Cas seemed far more penitent and remorseful than hopeful, as he had the last two days, but it was beginning to pick up.
Dean was still fuming, but he dropped his voice, "Is that the truth?"
Xander scoffed, "That's my niece, so, kind of. Same way I claim the rest of my family."
"This event in Dallas, how important is it?"
His expression fell quickly, "What? You don't want to shave the whole thing?"
"What if it's not so much a weapon as a good luck charm?" Melody asked, "Maybe you don't need to use it because you have it?"
"I had to, okay? It was family stuff, I had to sign some things, don't worry about it. I'm staying home until you're sick of me this time."
"Just keep stirring," Claire said, dumping another load of chocolate chips into the bowl.
"Not nice to talk about your mother's face like that," Claire answered sarcastically.
The door opened rather abruptly, and Ben stuck his head out, "Pops, timer's going off."
"No, I'm not mad," Cas assured him, certain they'd both be asleep within minutes.
"Like it's somehow my fault that I can give as good as I get? She got her asking price. I've been watching the finances on this really close, I knew the minute I had enough in the bank to buy her out. I was just waiting for her to come down to the cut-and-run price."
"Uh,-" Jess started, turning to Sam.
Dean looked confused, "How is that funny?"
Claire ran a hand over her face, "A date, or whatever, to pretend they aren't gay."
Blake shook his head, "I didn't need to know any of that."
"There was nothing for her to be embarrassed about, that guy was awful. Of course, Grandpa told me that Pop-pop threatened to rip out the guy's intestines and replace them with the garden hose, so you know he had her back. They both did," Alfie replied, "And we've got your back, in case Donovan ever turns out to be a total asshole. I'm not saying he will, of course, but just in case."
Dean looked to be completely absorbed in his repair, so she didn't bother to check in with him before taking a keyring sized flashlight from the wall to get a better look.
"What's wrong with the bed?"
"Looks like I have a conversation happening." Margaret said quietly, getting up from her seat as Claire nodded.
Castiel quickly pinned him down to the bed, thrusting faster, harder, and releasing a few audible moans he could no longer keep hidden.
Cas nodded absently, staring at the screen as Gabe left the room.
"Okay."
Happy Early Valentine's Day! Love you all! FW)
On his way out the door, he passed three of the town busy bodies in a booth, muttering about Julie, which always seemed to pick up on days she brought her daughter in.
"Dad... Too loud... I wasn't drinking."
"Sorry... You know, you're confusing the hell out of me lately?" Alfie said softly, a spark of fear in his eyes.
"No, I'm not taking any more bitchy attitude from yo-"
Now she knew, though. He'd provided pure honesty. She wasn't his. And yet, beside him, in the passenger seat, it was still his baby with a broken heart, quietly sobbing.
"About what?" Claire's voice calm from the edge of the hallway, clear as a bell. Dean felt his stomach lurch against already sore muscles as Kip turned his attention, but thankfully not his firearm, toward Claire, "What did I lie about? Also, Lucas is calling the cops, so you should ditch, like, yesterday. Leave town, even."
She took a breath to calm the tingle of fear that shot down her spine as she heard the name, then shook her head, "Nope. I don't want to call Crowley. You can check if he left anything upstairs, though, sometimes he leaves important stuff on the desk."
"Your daddy has a big thing tonight, he might not be able to pick up right now," she reasoned.
"That's sparkly."
"Don't-"
He gave a sleepy shake of his head against her, "No way I was relaxing that night... And his hands are a lot bigger than yours, that's not... nuh-uh."
"Exactly who I was supposed to. The school counselor." Kevin answered, "Supposed to be a spot to get help confidentially, y'know?... Now, because he ignored it, this kid I was in the same class with all through middle school is dead, I got to see my mom cry, which she hasn't done since my dad left ten years ago, and Claire... shit."
Cas nodded through Don's usual greeting, and answered him, "Don, it's Cas Novak again... Yes... Language... Well, to be fair, the substitute teacher was being a bitch."
"That's right." Cas replied, "Thanks for having me."
"And they don't have a lot of dying people, so they run some of the local volunteer services out of it. I don't hang out with the dying folks. The chaplain is pretty cool, though."
"Um, yeah, I guess... Jess tried to get me to give him a talking to right then. I tried, I swear-"
"No, go ahead," Xander replied, anger flashing in his eyes, "Say it."
"That one doesn't fit, I outgrew it. You might be able to use it." Claire replied dismissively.
"Maybe in my own driveway, we'll see."
"Three." Trey corrected.
Melody wandered closer to get a better look as Claire got up, adjusting her stance for her belly, and began preparing a cup of coffee.
"Hey, Melody... Um, so, I was at the valentine's dance, but I heard you didn't go. Kamila said you stayed home, but somebody else said you went to the hospital the next morning."
He blinked, and suddenly hoped the color wasn't draining from his face, "What?"
Rachel nodded, "Well, it's not my favorite."
"I mean, jeez, if we had a dance club here, that'd be great, but we don't, because we live in a little pissant podunk, and the only other thing to do around here would be trying to make my car break the landspeed record."
"Yeah, well, I wouldn't blame you for it if you did. Brainwashing is... I dunno, hard to break."
Alfie had joined her in the paint shed, and they had, predictably, made no progress on the car.
Then again, Dean's theory that no loving God would keep any decent person out of Heaven, which Rabbi Jake had wholeheartedly told Ben was accurate as far as he knew, felt easier to deal with in his state of partial wakefulness.
TRIGGER WARNING! Cas was right, the birth is really rough for Claire, she has a mini-break-down. That could be rough for someone with past trauma to read... But at this point, you're probably okay with it.
As the door closed, Claire took the half empty bottle from Alfie's hand, setting it down, "You still need to lose a layer."
"This number, not my regular phone. I'm pretty sure my aunt's keeping it until my parents make her give it back," Caitlin replied.
"I'll head home, they're pretty much done with me anyway, they don't-"
"Nope. Water, vitamins, bed, no sodas, no caffeine, no booze, real meals, and some sunshine. Drop everything else for about three days, and you'll be good as new. But the stress has to go, so, y'know, maybe counseling again? At least finish hashing this stuff out instead of pretending you're fine and dodging his calls."
His skin was a mixture of two distinct types of pale, some areas slightly pink, two textures as well.  It formed a pattern, wide and rounded around his right shoulder, narrowing as it reached his waist, but continuing past his belt, into his jeans. His left side had less damage, but was still marred.
"It's okay, just, what the hell is going on?"
"You're old."
"Everything is fine." Claire said, her tone flat, "No, he went to bed already... Alfie's mom's old room... Yeah, like I'm gonna abduct the kid and then starve him. He ate half a pizza, then Margaret convinced him to try, um, I don't know what it was called, it was spicy... No, I didn't bring them, but after that hallucination crap, I just want to wait and make sure it's all out of my system. I'll be fine."
"Then Pops gets bumped around and you guys start feeling guilty, I heard," Cora interrupted, "But that was an accident, and Xander's not available. All hands on deck. You're just lucky the bakery is slow, and I have the time. Don't forget to unstrap it."
"No. It was definitely girl stuff, and Charlie was with me for support. But it's easier if he thinks we were out bra shopping."
The door of the limousine opened again, and Alfie climbed in awkwardly, trying to help Margaret in after him, finally moving into a seat next to Kevin as the door closed again, only to get a look at the bruises on his face and ask, nearly agape, "What happened to you?"
Thanks for reading! FW)
Cas only tilted his head, not certain he'd heard Dean correctly. Dean reached up with his free hand, shifting against Cas, and making him groan.
Dean couldn't help but laugh as Gary awkwardly hurried from the room, shutting himself in the bathroom and locking the door, "C'mon, baby, don't be like that."
Dean nodded, pulling out his phone to pull up the latest pictures of Melody, "Well, Xander's playing football, sort of, Ben's got a new girlfriend, who's younger than him, but in college, so that was a big, uh... Well, we had a misunderstanding about that."
Cas had no response, as his voice had left him, but he didn't appear catatonic, as he turned his attention back to Dean's face, where amid sallow skin, two green eyes remained half open, unseeing and motionless. Claire slowly gathered herself despite the shock that had met her, Cas' few words stammering through the phone still ringing in her ears, while now he was strangely silent. And yet, she was acutely aware, one of her fathers had passed, the other was falling apart, and somebody had to keep it together.
Naomi shrugged, "Well, men, you know, they can never really be sure, can they?"
"Yeah. She's overdoing it."
"It's good to see that kind of forgiveness in the world," he said with a small smile, "Not sure how well it would translate to business purposes, but, if this was a test, you passed... And that might be a better way for you to look at it, okay?"
"Oh, don't start that. You're not supposed to be exerting yourself." Dean objected.
"Why'd you stop the car?"
"No... No, I think... Well, I suppose maybe that would be for the best," he relented.
"Yeah."
Love you all! Thanks for reading! You're all epic! FW)
Kevin grimaced at what he was sure was an attempt to stir the pot. Xander's stature alone told Kevin he was having none of it, "Because she has a degree and knows what she's doing. I have the opposite, it's called brain damage. But I'm smart enough to know that I can trust her judgement, because I've got plenty of experience working side by side with her, and she knows how to manage people's strengths and weaknesses, and just like Dad, she can get you running at your best without pissing you off. 'Scuse me."
"Why the hell would you do that?" Rachel snapped.
"Said what? You said several things. A minute ago you were talking about Bobby."
Claire was quiet as she pulled out onto the highway, long enough that Dean was startled out of his worried thoughts as he stared out the window when she spoke again.
"Um... Is there, like, some app or something where I can learn how to do car stuff?" she asked.
"Phone call, probably Naomi, by the look on his face." Kevin replied.
Cas shrugged, "I never asked. I did overhear him tell Xander, though. He'd moved in with Bobby and Karen, they'd enrolled him at a new high school, and word got out quickly that he was, technically, in foster care, and someone insinuated something inappropriate about Bobby. Of course, Dean wasn't having it, and I'm sure you can fill in the blanks from there. Evidently, he spent that time in lock up thinking Bobby would want nothing to do with him, as he'd asked Dean to stay out of trouble, and he thought he'd be put into the system."
Cas shook his head. "No, I better not... I've never heard that before, 'grass on the field?'"
"The next time you see my brother fixing to go land his ass in jail, again, do me a favor and sit on him and call me, okay?"
"Ben, you're worrying us," Cas said quietly as Dean watched intently, unsure of how to proceed.
"I'm fine," she lied.
"Yo, Sandman? You around?" Kevin called, closing the door behind him.
"I understand... No, obviously tater tots more than twice in the same week is going to have the cafeteria menu spontaneously burst into flames, so it'll be corrected and ready for distribution on Thursday... Did you get the charity auction flyers?... No, I didn't see that one..."
"Accepted you as Claire's housewife, yeah," Cas answered, turning to look at where Sam had gone to the sink with their glasses, pouring out the rest, rinsing them, and heading back with the same glasses full of water, "This was a bad idea, Sam. We aren't even playing right, the turns and things, this has gotten out of hand."
"Hey Cas!" Dean called. He didn't have to raise his voice much to be heard, in the heavy stillness. "Come have a beer."
"I want you to know," she said as the car reached the edge of the airport drive, "I really appreciate you doing all of this for me. I had a couple of friends offer me a place to stay, but they can't really handle all of the medical stuff, you know? And the state medical stuff is just... It's hard... This is just, I don't know... Unbelievably kind of you."
"Wow... Big complement."
Cas had had mixed feelings when he'd had to wait in the hall as the x-rays of her hand were taken, he hated to see her anxious, but hearing her swear at the nurse to try to keep him in the room certainly warmed his heart, knowing she wanted him close by.
He ran into Jack at one point, who helpfully suggested he take a second day, but he pressed on.
"Yes, the married guy. But everything was transparent from the start, I know I told you about that."
"Nick! Drop it!" Ben screeched, "Drop it, now!"
"I'm more concerned about his record."
"Dean, please, it's not important now."
"Wow... I don't know what I expected, but-"
"Because you're asleep. And I'm sorry, I gotta play it safe, you know that. Are you waking up?" he asked hopefully, kissing her neck.
"Well, if you have something I can fix here at the desk... Otherwise, not much to do unless the phone rings."
"That. Yep."
Stunned, and beating back his own childhood demons, Dean watched as Mike ducked his head and used his thumb and forefinger to try to hide the act of removing tears from the inner corners of his eyes.
Claire, exasperated, turned to face him. "Yeah?"
"I got a lot better once I got here," Claire suggested.
"Right. A bright kid like this, we can't have him cracking databases for the mob or something. I'm not sure high school is much better, but we can hope she'll keep him on track," Don said with another nod.
A round of gasps caused a hush to fall over several of the surrounding tables as the crone turned a shameful shade of crimson, "She'll be alone and miserable until that brat is off to school, and you had better believe it. I've seen it a million times, you young people have no idea what you're talking about."
"Well, I spent about two and a half weeks out there going back and forth between chicken broth, holding her hair back, pushing water, and convincing her to try to sleep, and in between checking she was still breathing, I got a couple new tunes jotted down, and then, when she was doing better, her mom came out to see her... She wanted her to take over, but she wouldn't do it."
"Well, I want a tune up, and oil, and possibly the tires replaced. But Helen said you only charged for the part, so I'll pay for the oil and tires, and the filters, but-"
"Two seconds, I can fix this. Don't move." Dean said, waiting for Cas to agree before getting up.
Through the bare glass of the large window beside her as she transversed the front porch, she heard Naomi scoff, "I'm sure that was her brother."
Margaret smiled broadly as the handful of people following Naomi around this lap of the gallery didn't seem to know how to interpret the comment either, and addressed them directly, "Oh, you might be interested to know, if you've been following Samandriel's work for a while, that I also have a small photography credit in a few of his Helix pieces. The double helix design was built off of a photograph I took, and there have been a few other occasions when he's asked me to push the button on the camera when he was in the middle of something and couldn't get something to sit correctly unless he was holding it."
"You never
"Um... Not until the next morning."
A hush fell over the table as Jaime took his plate to the kitchen. Melody looked around at the adults before giving a small shrug and breaking the silence, "Mom, do you know where Principal Gabe lives?"
Nodding, Mike hurried for the door, worried that at any time he'd fall into outright blubbering and begging to go home immediately, but a weight was lifted from him, despite the tears as he finished his walk to the house. It wasn't a solid date of completion to aim for, but there was an end in sight. His parents had no desire to be rid of him, they'd simply lost their way at the same time he'd lost his, and hadn't been able to help him, the changes in him had occurred faster than they could anticipate. High school, and home, were both probabilities, rather than murky shapes in a possible future, and he had a solid routine and schedule to fall back on when the world outside became infinite and frightening in it's millions of unpredictable outcomes.
"Or how much you spent on that portrait of that high school girl that works for you." Alfie said quietly, joining in.
"I guess that's something you two have in common," Cora chimed in, despite her most recent snack regaining her interest as her brother's expression soured, "I mean, how many times have you heard that?"
"You're gonna get enough of that later." Dean replied, pulling two plastic clips and a sterile pair of scissors from the kit, and checking whether the cord was still pulsing.
Claire nodded, "So when Dean said yesterday that I should just have Bobby's old car... I don't know."
In a class on basic psychology, which he'd considered important to relate to his animal patient's owners, he'd learned several years ago that dreams were often the brain's salad of nonsensical stressors relieving itself after a long day. A guest lecturer had likened it to walking through a cactus patch all day, then plucking the needles out of one's skin, putting them all into a blender, and then dumping the resultant mush onto a plate.
Alfie nodded, which slowly devolved to a shake of his head, "Just... Okay, I can't. I was there for that phase, and he-... He's a great guy, really. But relationship stuff, that age... Privileged information, just not where I'd send Mike for advice."
"Jones was her maiden name, she never married. Well, not that I know of."
"No, you dump him. I had him first."
"It was open. I'm looking for my child. A door is not going to stop me."
Ben shrugged, but kept silent.
Cas' arms tightened around Dean's shoulders, and Dean could taste himself on Cas' lips even now, as Cas leaned heavily on the shower wall, Dean's hand continuing to move. Quiet sounds of frenzied surrender and deep pleasure echoed from the back of his throat, masked by the noise of the water.
"I fucked your ex-girlfriend, that's how I know it's mental, okay?"
Jack chuckled, "It had to be, I mean, you left town right after that, so-"
"Then maybe they sold just a little bit of the land to some business?"
"What will you be studying?"
"Yep."
Ben looked up, "The real tall guy, Sam?"
"Not as much as I love the guy who puts them in the toaster."
"Cora's good to vent to, you know," Xander jerked his head toward the glass, "'Cause, I guess, she's really direct. She'll tell you if you're just being stupid, but she's not mean about it. I mean, it sounds mean, but it's just her."
"How do you... You know, I only have boys, maybe you can get this to work?" Leslie said, attempting to pass him the elastic.
Margaret had moved to kneel on the floor, knees splayed, leaning heavily on the exercise ball, arguing with the nurse that beds were against her religion. Kevin went straight for her, and was about to tell the nurse to stop hassling her, but the door swung open again. This person he recognized, as it was her obstetrician.
"No... No, it takes about an hour per drink, it's only been half an hour, and you're not used to drinking. Also, you can't tell me this wasn't just horrible for you, so, let me drive you home." Alfie waited for her nod, and slowly let go, getting up from the bed and pulling a shirt from his dresser.
He hadn't expected Charlie. And Charlie was fuming.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm fine," Cas said quickly, hiding his thoughts carefully, "When the new stereo arrives, would you mind setting this one aside for me? I'd like to see if I can repair it."
"I don't even remember who did it. I just remember her kicking him in the leg the next time he came by. I was going to put her in her room, but Lance, the guy I was seeing, he told me to let him handle it, and I guess he took her to get some food or something. He was always worried about her getting enough to eat, I was always worried he was gonna make her fat... I should've kept him around, it would have been better for her."
"Sorry."
Alfie slowly shook his head, "No. You really should listen to him."
"Why's it matter?" Ivan asked with a chuckle.
Cora chuckled, "No, he's here for a muffin."
"Nobody's looking at me twice. Cas, however, he's got people talking wherever he goes, and I can't figure out for the life of me what you get out of it," Dean replied quietly.
Dean nodded slowly, "Okay... Well... You, um, you got your high school diploma, and a couple months of courses, so at least you can say you got in."
"Ben," Dr Thompson asked, making a note on his clipboard, "If I were to ask you who you get the most quality time with right now, who do you think that would be? And it's okay with you don't want to say."
Sitting on the counter as Claire carefully wiped blood from his chin, Alfie was somewhat surprised the boy wasn't crying. If anything, there was a certain amount of steel in his eyes that he was sure had to have come from his mother.
Alfie looked past her to where Margaret gave a small groan as she turned over, "Now what? Think we should wake her up?"
"She's fine," Naomi answered for her, rolling her eyes. She wasn't particularly interested in the house itself, but brought up the rear as she tagged along after her sister.
"As long as your flash is off as not to bother the other patrons," Naomi assured her, while silently suggesting Margaret move to stand by the wall.
Alfie got out of a long shower to find a voice-mail from Claire, and listened to it immediately.
"Of course not," Cas answered. He could hear it in his own voice as the words fell flat. His depression pressing in on him at all sides.
He pulled the dress out for her, and a light jacket, bringing them over to her, "Why wouldn't you want an epidural?"
"Is it a little better, now?" he asked her, somewhat louder than his usual speaking voice.
"It looked hungry."
"So you do remember. Okay."
Wandering over, Mike watched as Blake carefully removed the oil bottle and the fender covers that protected the paint while the hood was open. Blake began looking around for some object, checking the floor, and looking to see if it had fallen into the works at some point before he turned around and found it - the oil cap - on one of the tall tool benches.
"You were hopeful." Dean said with a soft laugh.
Dean shook his head, "It's not a normal family. But we all take care of each other, that's the important thing. Maybe it's better if you, uh, y'know, accept it, and jump in."
Claire seemed frozen to the spot where she stood, trembling and her breathing mildly panicked, and despite her age and the pain in the lower half of his face, Cas was compelled to wrap her in a protective hug, more than certain that it was needed once she had grown calm enough to return it.
"I left my keys at home, entirely too close to the person I tore into this afternoon," Cas answered dryly.
Claire chuckled as she found the tax files she needed, "And as fast as that went, it would have been fine. This time, though, they stuck a label on me, I'm high-risk until further notice. No homebirth unless the little parasite quits blocking it's own door."
With clumsy hands, Claire grappled with the door for a moment before she got it open, and stumbled out. Walking away from the car at a pace slightly quicker than shambling, she heard it easily as Alfie set the transmission in park and got out of the car, leaving the engine running. His footsteps were obvious as he caught up to her, and her anger was slowly taking the place of the sudden fear she'd experienced when the car had started to spin.
Supposing it was Melody having crawled into the bed with them during the night, as she'd been taking some time getting used to her new room, he shifted away, rolling as he went, checking to see that she hadn't managed to trap an arm or leg somewhere between them.
Claire jumped, banging her wrist against a thick piece of the frame jutting out towards the part she was trying to remove. Letting her hand crumple in toward her in mild pain, she let out a hiss before she recovered, "You aren't supposed to be in the yard, you know that. Your uncle almost died from playing out here, and he was twelve, same as you."
"It's... stuff. Stupid stuff. I don't know."
"Good enough for me, I don't know, either." Ivan replied quietly, "But I know I like that you're here."
"Is my head the only thing you want to get inside of?" Cas asked, trying to spur him on.
He felt small and frightened, and pondered his father's words more carefully. It hurt to admit it, but as he was miles from home, it struck him easily that every person in the county they'd entered, aside from Kevin, was an absolute stranger to him. His sheltered upbringing easily put him off balance, and he suddenly wished he'd stayed at Kevin's side.
"No, I've got a plate for him, you two go ahead. Just don't be late." Cas answered, gesturing for a moment before taking a bite of his oatmeal from the bowl on the counter by the stove, and turning the last slice of toast over in the pan.
"It's not," Millie insisted, "You knew kids were really unlikely, so how does it matter? It's not like we went into this with you wanting five or six kids, and me saying, 'sure, why not?' I was clear about it."
"That's not a thing."
"But you'll tell him it wasn't a fair fight, and that you're going to get help for this, right?"
"Tell me you spilled half the bottle." Dean whispered, "Because it had a lot more in it yesterday."
Giving a hard nod, Cas left the room, going back to his own office, passing the desk where the first-responder who ran the I.T. department for the district, filling in for the nurse that day, was trying to get Ben to keep an ice pack on. She patted Ben on the knee and got up, following Cas into his office and closing the door.
Alfie shrugged one shoulder, "I can make do."
"My house, my little brother, you know where this is going," Claire replied.
The books had consumed all her effort as she heard Dean call her. She'd ignored him. She'd heard him speaking to Xander, examining his hand to check it if had broken. Repeatedly, he'd used her name to try to get her attention, and absentmindedly, she'd suggested having Ben drive Xander into town instead. The manuals might have been easier sorted outside of the bookcase, and replaced a stack at a time. The pages were getting dog-eared, the covers stained, and coming loose. Pages were starting to fall out as she did everything she could to at least get the manuals, falling apart as they were, back onto the shelf in the proper order.
"Bastards," Claire replied sleepily, the pillow against her cheek muffling her voice.
"We try," Claire replied, "Sometimes I wonder, though."
"No, he's clean. Said he got busted for pot, but he might have made it up."
"He said he'll go."
Hannah brought a thick stack of paper into Cas' office, sorting through the top of the stack as she walked, "Amy Thomas is complaining about two of her students. She moved them to opposite sides of the room, but somehow it's still a distraction."
"I should go..." Alfie said quietly.
"And if you still need some noise after that, we'll get a little useless rat-sized dog that won't shut up."
"Hey-"
Dean shook his head again, "Not at this point, no."
Xander lay stretched out sideways over his bed, an ice pack on his mouth, trying to figure out where he'd gone wrong and set the guy off.
"Right. And you changed the lyrics, but you didn't have to change them by much, did you?"
"You'd better get back." Claire said, gesturing to the door.
Sure enough, Reese's brother caught sight of her and wandered over.
Dean passed her the phone.
Lucas, having no family in the state, showed up eventually, as well, and despite his apologies, had been welcomed just the same.
"Yeah, but at the same time, you don't need me here."
"You know, I'm sorry to interrupt your little date, or whatever's going on," Will said, gesturing toward Dean, "But it's scientific research, actually. Freak of nature, how one useless blonde can be a prude and a slut at the same time."
He suddenly wondered how the conversation had become far more focused on what he knew than what she did, "Yeah. Actually, Claire and your mom were in the same grade, and Claire had started her second year of college, so, probably nineteen."
"Um, yeah. I'm in it right now actually. I thought I'd wait in here, show him I'm serious about leaving, and if that didn't work, I can at least lock the doors."
"Well, he could be, but no more than we are," Alfie answered, "That was weird."
"Don't worry about it, it's almost done." Kevin replied.
"The website I sent you, are you interested?"
"Yo! Sandman!"
"Sometimes, yeah."
"Is that a challenge?" Alfie asked with a chuckle.
"Red, right?" Claire asked.
A choking sound escaped Dean's mouth as he leaned against the railing.
"You looked lonely."
"I wasn't yelling."
"I want you there."
"It's not on purpose," Melody objected, "I'm not making it happen, it just happens."
Mills nodded, "Where did the pressure washer come from?"
Cas kept his distance as Dean undressed, waiting by the sink under the guise of being ready to turn off the running water, and added the bloody washcloth to the basin. Getting into the hot spray, Dean continued to speak to him with the occasional comment, both of them aware without mentioning it that Cas had thought better of joining Dean.
Charlie rounded the end of the counter, and made a few careful strokes through the child's hair to get it into place before reaching for the elastic.
"Testing out the car. I wanted to see how fast it would go."
Margaret gave him a confused look, "What?"
"Wow... Look at you, handling this scary, hard dad-stuff like a pro. Your little girl likes a boy, and you're not losing it, you're just going with it."
"Are you serious? You're not just messing around, right? Because I have to leave early today," Dean stressed.
Kevin shook his head, "There's actually a lawyer involved already. Crowley... Okay, anymore details come out, and Margaret loses all deniability, so... No texts, no calls, if someone calls, no recording it, and if they say they're recording, which they'd have to, here, otherwise anything said becomes inadmissible, hang up. We just completely shut up about the whole thing, don't even say anything if you're in the same room with the TV or one of these-" he paused to jiggle his phone, "Because ad-targeting, apparently, recordings happen all the time, and I don't believe those settings actually turn it off, probably just a useless button to bring about a false sense of security-"
"What the hell is going on around here?" she asked, somewhat bewildered.
"Can we have waffles for breakfast?"
Dean wasn't sure what she said, but Cas pushed his beer a little closer to Dean and indicated he was going to follow her.
"What were you thinking?" Claire demanded.
With a squirm further away from him, Claire's hand fluttered a weak swat against his face as she inched away, and his hopes of a more pleasant evening were quickly shattered with the concern that he'd rightfully upset her and overstepped their boundaries.
Alfie nodded in response, and she walked away.
Ben slipped out, closing the door behind him and Uri folded his hands on his desk. "How well do you know your neighbor, Mr Winchester?"
"Stop! It's gonna fall again, don't move!" Alfie commanded.
"Look, Pops, you don't have to rush this. The Impala is here, we can set you up with another loaner if you want, and think it over, but any time you want, you know me or Claire will take you to a lot and help you find something that'll last. Or you could start just using Dad's car all the time. Makes no difference."
"Just thought I'd swing by to check on Claire." Will answered, coming closer.
"Right now, right?... Please, Cas, you had me really close!"
Alfie had been able to hear the sound of the engine well in advance of Mike's car arriving as dinner was nearly over, and was already nearly to the door when the boy knocked. Upon opening it, he was met with a heavy expression he'd seen on Kevin's face one time too many, but before he could ask what was wrong, Mike's voice came out beaten and shaky, "Can I talk to Pops?"
"You should hear what he calls me." Alfie said with a shrug. He waved toward the closed office door halfway down the hall, "Did you want me to wait?"
Dean went back to Henry, getting to the ground to get a look at his knee. A piece of shattered bone had torn through both skin and denim, and a large patch of red was forming around the wound.
In the dimmed light that managed to pierce the curtains with an off-gold glow, Claire woke gently to the feeling of delicate touches stroking her bare skin. The hands that touched her were intimately familiar with her boundaries and her desires, and carefully accommodated both in an intricate dance.
"I know I hurt you, but I also know you understand why... and it hurt me, too, but it worked... You're scared to trust me again."
"Oh, just wonderful. I can always count on Kevin to get my curls going in the right direction."
"Yeah. And Jaime's eating now. Are we gonna be late for school?" Melody asked.
"Touch me," Cas whispered, his voice hoarse as he let go of Dean's hands, "Lift your knees... And don't talk... I need this."
"Yeah, well, he does. Why does it matter?"
Dean chuckled, "No, I'm just messing with you."
Kevin nodded, pulling into the apartment complex, "Okay. Sure. I'm gonna ask that question, to somebody who's not expecting it, and I'm going to do it respectfully."
Mike nodded eagerly as Dean rested his elbows on the table to listen.
"Because he'd be an idiot not to, now that the ranch is toast, it's all as good as gone."
"That's not gonna be enough," Dean said, nodding toward the trunk, "You got anything else in there that might help keep me quiet?"
Millie nodded, "Yeah, I guess that was stupid, I was embarrassed. And, honestly, I said it to shut Jack up, and I really thought it would score you some points with the other guys, since they were kind of picking on you at that point."
"I can make decisions, I'm not the one jumping in front of a gun! Nobody's hurt, he's disarmed, tell Randy to let him leave!" Dean insisted as Claire opened the door, ducking her head out.
Hope you're all well.
"Yeah."
"They lied to me my whole life, and the guy that's-... Chaz said the guy that died, the guy who was dating Claire-"
Dean shrugged, "I'm gonna stay in this chair for a while."
"I really don't need the extra layer, Cas. It's not helping," Kevin said firmly.
Dean lost track of Cas' words, his frayed nerves soothed by the sound of Cas' voice, and at some point the call ended.
"Right... You didn't hit your head?"
"Kev, there's nothing there. That would be like me asking if you were doing that therapy stuff with Claire for fun."
"She's a grown woman in her own home, if she wants to rebuild a transmission in the upstairs bathtub, that's entirely up to her." Alfie objected.
Alfie paused on his way back to the couch, "You know that's a wine-cooler, right?"
As her voice ended in a whisper, Ivan found himself staring blankly, "Jesus Christ, Julie..."
Soon, Ben's voice came over the line, "Hello?"
Dean clicked the small device twice in a row.
Ivan chuckled, "No, forty."
"Claire, your room- that's not-... I know how important that is to you."
"We've talked about it, we just, you know, and, well, if she called it... I mean, if it's that obvious to a toddler, then maybe we're just... you know?"
Dean shrugged, "Why not? We've got some time before dinner."
"Shhhh... Je ne peux pas trouver ma pomme de terre."
"Even with this," Alfie replied, "Even if you think I've lost it, you have to trust me enough to hear me out."
"Get the hell away from me!" Claire said loudly.
"No, you haven't. But you are attracted to her."
Cas quickly passed him a mug from the cabinet just past him, and Dean went straight for the coffee pot as Ben started talking about his plans for taking Nick out into the wooded back yard to explore for the day.
Claire heard a thunk, and the hood popped up about an inch and a half.
"People like him don't change."
"Xander-" Dean started, before shifting awkwardly, and finding the right words, "Look, big picture, are you okay?"
"Claire..." Cas warned quietly.
Rachel nodded, taking a moment to consider his words, despite him slowing his speech to give her time to process his language, "I don't want the children upset. I just want to know, she was hurt, and she would not let anyone hurt her children? She seems too strong for that."
Claire crossed her arms and shrank back into her seat. "Not a good time for this."
Gabe nodded, "Sorry. Any time a kid gets hurt, that's rough. But there's a rumor one of the other kids pushed him."
"His own brother. I remember. Just remember to watch what you say," Naomi replied, reminding him gently that anyone could be listening, and certain words would draw suspicion.
"Yeah, what?" came the surly reply.
Thanks for reading! FW)
"Because I need to go to a shop we don't have in town." Margaret answered.
Dean pressed inside again, feeling him tighten reflexively and waited for it to stop.
That last one was a blast to write and all came together beautifully, unfortunately I have a bit of a plot-block in my way right now. Good thing I stay ahead.
"What the hell, mom?"
"And you and Mike considered that the theater might be full of people on dates?" Cas asked, trying to lead her gently to what he considered an obvious conclusion.
"Is she okay?"
"In fact, seeing as we both recognize it as a possibility now that we're having this discussion, I'm specifically asking you not to." Cas said firmly, "I don't want murder, however justifiable it might seem, to be a part of their lives, do you understand?"
"Just paint it back on?" the boy clarified.
"Who else knows?"
The front door opened again, and closed noisily before Lucius ran a sweeping glance over the front yard, and decided to take up the other half of the porch swing. "Man, those kids... They are really something."
Cynthia nodded, "It seems like, since it came up, any time I ask a question, I get more than I wanted to know, and then I'm left with more questions."
"Of course," Claire answered with a nod, still frozen to her seat.
"Need sleep... building a kid, here."
Ben shook his head, "She's better than that."
Cas closed his eyes, "Amelia."
"Babe, did you happen to notice how long Chance's nose has been runny?" he asked.
"Ah, no. I'll grab it. I'm up anyway. But," he looked a bit more pointedly at Cas, "I guess you filled him in on what's going on?"
He felt Cas' hand on his ribs, giving a gentle stroke, "Not exactly the worst day of my life."
"Please tell me you still trust me?" he whispered, "Obviously I knew it wasn't right if I went to someone who'd only remind me it was a terrible idea."
The glass door behind Dean swung closed after Ellen went through it, and found his quick trot had slowed to a sulk as he approached the tow truck at the back edge of the parking lot. "Dean," she called loudly as she came upon him from behind.
"Which war?"
"So much for not drinking for a while." Claire said softly. Cas had heard it, and despite her lighthearted tone, the guilty look in his eyes said everything.
Hannah turned in her chair slightly, "Where does this leave me? If I press for his acceptance, I may be letting a troublemaker loose here. What kind of child is he, if he's so very bright, and also this troubled? If he's a danger to the other students, or himself? Are the gains worth the risk?"
"Jesus," Jack breathed. He moved closer, intending to take a seat next to her, but she got to her feet, and with a glance at the kitchen window, gave a jerk of her head indicating she wished him to follow as she gained some distance from the house, and any listening ears.
Suddenly it didn't seem like such a good idea, but she seemed happy. That was all he had to offer the world at this point, keeping Claire happy. He loosened his grip and she kissed him again, her soft breasts falling against his chest as she shifted to adjust her position.
"Goodnight," Claire replied, starting for the stairs.
No less confused after the call, only slightly more resolved to find a solution, and worried what would ultimately come of the situation, Alfie began to pace, soon finding himself in the living room. He stopped by the poster Claire had put up that morning, and delicately traced a finger along the curve of a line of flame depicting a thigh.
Margaret wrapped her arms around Kevin, "Okay, after the wedding, but, just right now, is there anything else we aren't being open about? Because this was big, and we could have talked about it a whole lot sooner. I don't want to waste time on anything else."
"Yep."
After a while, he spotted her, making her way back with another glass. He'd been speaking to a woman who looked a bit younger than most of the crowd, but still older than him, and had been acting a bit too familiar.
Cas nodded, as habit brought him out of the room and toward the kitchen, "I am. I'm scared for the kids... And if they aren't scared of these changes themselves, they're even more broken than we thought, and I'm very concerned that you don't seem to see it!"
"I don't know. Probably you."
"...who's a girl?"
"I don't want to pretend this is all just going to go away, but, it could stop, right?" Claire asked, "Maybe with things settling down, becoming normal, time to grieve, she might just stop?"
He watched the expression on Matt's face as Matt stared unabashedly at the back of the angry man's head, his eyes periodically darting to Claire, who, while calmer, was matching the man point for point on why she refused to budge on policy.
"You're bugging her every ten minutes?"
"I'll wait. If you don't mind me staring at you all creepy."
"Let's try that again, buster," Dean snapped, matching his tone, "Who the hell are you?"
In the back of his mind, he was sure there was something to suggest that maybe this was too much, but, goddammit, he was busy right now.
"I guess."
"If it helps," he said softly, "They have a loving, stable home, caring parents, and a few strict rules. Melody is a very intelligent child, very sure of herself, and protective of her brother, and James is hitting milestones early, like she did."
"Yeah, but-"
"That's stupid. It's probably just left over stuff from the folks that owned the place. Who'd put a bed in a vet's office?" Ben replied.
She dumped the rest of the stack of crunchy chocolate in his lap.
Ben was choking on air as Xander's laughing had turned into a hard, silent shake, "Xander?"
"I'm as bad as my mother," Claire choked out, fighting back tears.
"Tell you what," Dean murmured against his neck, encouraging him to thrust, "Show me what you'd do if you had me bent over this thing."
"Okay, but right now, I can't say 'go talk to your husband?'"
"Don't over think it." Margaret advised, pulling his shirt up his ribs, "Any more tattoos I should know about ahead of time?"
"Yep... He has a few conditions, but you were right, he didn't say no."
"A doll?" Margaret asked.
"No, he wouldn't do that... I was having a really bad day, I felt awful, and Alfie's in Dallas, so he asked Kevin to come check on me. I haven't been sleeping much, and we took a nap."
"I graduated early." Caitlin replied with a shy smile.
Cas set the plate full of bacon down on the table next to the tall stack of french toast as he took another long draw from his coffee mug. With some scuffle, Ben and Xander managed to wolf down a large portion each while loudly discussing their schedules for the day.
"Save the sarcasm for the champagne meet and greet, Samandriel."
"All right. It came in yesterday, would you like to take a look?"
"It hurts, probably. A lot, even... But he's with us, he's not on the streets, locked up, or dead. So, y'know, she'll get him back."
Cas smiled gently as he stirred his own bowl to cool it, "I hope you'll remember that the yogurt loses some fat when it cultures. And it's the bacteria they want you get, not the fats in the milk that can cause your stomach to make extra acid."
Dean nodded as he listened, "Yeah, well, you should. That aunt of yours keeps her caged up like a dog."
Alfie shrugged, "Not drunk driving, no..."
"None of those completely failproof. I don't want another baby. I don't want to be pregnant ever again. I'm gonna be a stupid nun before letting this happen again, okay? I can't do this again!" Margaret answered, tears welling up in her eyes.
Dean dumped several pieces of ice into the dish towel and passed it to Cas, before turning back to the fridge, pulling out another beer, popping the top off quickly and setting it down in front of Cas. "How long does it usually take for her to calm down?"
Dean's lips parted softly, and Cas felt his heart wrench expecting the words to slip out and destroy his world, end everything that mattered to him,
Well, we know it wasn't forged."
"Good thing you had this laying around," Charlie said quietly as Dean lifted a partial sheet of plywood up to rest against the interior of the broken window, and passed him a nail and hammer.
Claire came to the end of the pit and dropped into a crouch, "Hey, did you run off with my ten millimeter socket?"
"That thing you've been wanting to do."
Claire scoffed, "Yeah, well, probably nothing happening anyway, since I got that pill the next day."
"Technically it was 'slut,' whores do it professionally." Ivan replied.
"Dean."
"I had a gun in my face, that's not just gonna go away, but I'm sure he learned his lesson. I mean, your mom moved to your sister's house, and hasn't been back, he's probably not even going to come back to town, not if he's smart. Not with it making the news like it did."
Melody could feel heat rising in her blood, "I guess it takes one to know one, huh?"
"He puts mustard on his burritos?" Jack interrupted.
Got some decent Crowley in this one. One blink-and-you'll-miss-it had me rolling.
Kevin, with three girls in tow, showed up a short time after Claire and Alfie arrived, and helped to fill the table they'd claimed.
Alfie lifted his hands defensively and continued to the filter tap attached to the kitchen sink, getting a glass of water, and starting back upstairs, while Cas stifled a yawn.
"You're not getting one red cent out of me, or anybody I know!" he growled.
She shut herself in the office for a brief moment intending to call her husband and insist he come to the shop and try to pitch in, leaving Lauren in Margaret's care at the desk. But no sooner had she pulled her phone from her pocket, than the sound of a knock on the door interrupted her. She spun around, ready to handle the next minor emergency, only to find her father on the other side of the small glass panel. Opening the door immediately, she assumed something had to be wrong, but Cas had evidently pulled himself together enough to look presentable, "Dad?"
"Please tell me that's not your parents." Kevin muttered.
"I didn't say a damn thing about school, did I? But hiding never fixed anything... Just come downstairs with me, and we'll give Mom a reason to restock all the junk food, and you can do what girls do best and talk until you get all squeaky and can't breathe."
"No... I don't think he'd say anything even if he walked in on something obvious." Alfie replied, "You really shouldn't have picked up that toolbox."
"Who's Bobby?"
Alfie was quiet as he slipped into the house, few lights left on, all switches directly on his path to the bedroom. He locked the door behind him, turning off the single lamp by the large living room window, made his way upstairs, flipping off the switch at the top as he went, and found the door to his bedroom by the night light that dimly lit the floor of the upstairs landing.
"There's a snake under the lid," Cas said quickly, nodding to the sandbox.
"If you throw up on me, Dad-"
Entering the living room again, Henry was doing his best to avoid looking at him until he realized Kevin had jeans on. Kevin leaned on the back of the couch, addressing Henry, who waited uncomfortably on an arm chair, "Good work leading with an apology. She's going to give you a shot."
He turned back around, facing into the room.
"Xander left a bottle of something banana flavored in the pantry."
"Yeah, well, I need you to run out early, I got a call on the way over. It seems someone's getting stupid over at the bakery, and I need a representative to throw on a monkey suit, run over, and give 'em hell," Claire said, coming closer and running a hand across the back of his shoulders.
"Sam-"
Kevin stood, still hazy with sleep and followed after her, "Is Samandriel still here?"
Alfie couldn't help grinning as he made for the door, and waited.
With a quiet laugh, Cas gave a nod of agreement and started for the bar.
"No."
"I'm very proud of you."
There seemed to be more, but Xander's actions showed a nervousness that occasionally carried into his speech, and rather than expect him to continue while well aware of his difficulties, Dean stepped close and embraced him warmly, "Congratulations, kid. You're gonna do great."
"I'm working," Melody replied, "So, is there something I can get for you?"
Dean smirked, "Sure did. I don't need a brush to get your meat wet."
The phone rang this time as Claire quickly dropped one of Lauren's shirts back into the basket and snatched her phone, bringing it to her ear in irritation, "Okay, what? What can't freakin' wait?" she snapped.
"Was there a rattle?" Cas asked.
"I just want you to know, when he came in here a little while ago, he had no idea we were here. This was never planned, and he sure didn't have time to tell you, okay? I can tell from your face you know all of it, but honey, you've got nothing to worry about. I've got a lot of love for that man, we both do, but the last thing either of us would want is to shake anything between you and him. He's yours, and we respect that," she said, watching as Dean's face continued to betray him. It was with a caring hand she rubbed at his upper arm, hoping to extend some comfort, "Listen, if things calm down, if you two are okay with it, you should both come meet us at the bar later, around eight. But no pressure."
The small house was quiet until Cas shifted in place, bringing a gentle hand up to the back of Dean's shoulders, "Dean...? What did you see?"
As Julie passed her, drying her eyes and heading quickly for her car, Claire spoke up sharply, "You're wrong."
Through the glass of the door, the interior of the house being far better lit than the dark front porch, she could see Dean helping Cas carry the dishes from the dining room back to the kitchen. He had both hands full, and Cas had stopped him in passing.
"Wow, way to make this so much more comfortable." Claire muttered.
Muttering wordy equivalents of curses under her breath, she pulled the door open, and Dean pushed his way past her, having gotten a rough description of the layout of the house from Ben on the drive over. He came to a door exactly where Ben had described it, and as he'd been told, it was padlocked shut.
Dean scoffed, "Just get it done, and make sure it's done right."
"There's only one thing scarier than Dad yelling, and that's Dad not yelling," Ben said quietly, "Because that means he's cooking up something worse."
Claire nodded, still shaky, "It's still weird. What if... God, I hate this."
A distinguished looking man drew close in an awkward fashion with little regard to personal space. Alfie wasn't even sure the fellow knew he was standing there until he spoke, never looking at Alfie directly, which he found very offputting, "I'm told you're the artist."
"Someone won a free trip to Guam recently. Round trip ticket, expenses paid, all the niceties... Unfortunately, he ran into some trouble while he was there... Also, an associate of mine, one of those overly friendly types who aren't afraid of prison, for the right price, well... he's just had a mishap on his boat and lost an anchor over the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench. Bad luck, I'm sure..."
Naomi looked carefully at the display, and turned around, noting for the millionth time the locations of his other works scattered throughout the large room amid many others. "None of these are as good as the one you shut off last time. Are you sure these are the ones you want people to see?"
"Yeah."
"I regret thinking that." Cas answered.
The conversation was dropped almost as abruptly as it had started when the door of the shop swung open and someone was greeted with all the fanfare and applause Randy and Lucas could manage on their own. Curious, Claire left the bays for the dark hallway to find a familiar face.
"Whispers?" Cas asked, "Is there a reason you're being cryptic?"
"This is bullshit," Mike's voice broke, "He was fine this weekend! We were supposed to... We were going to go to the bar during the day when they let kids in so he could teach me to play pool! He promised!"
"Of course, dear," Cas replied tiredly, "Do you suppose this will have any effect on Ben's plan to get an apartment near campus with Jack?"
Margaret nodded with a grimace as a new contraction started to well up in the top of her belly, washing downward painfully, "You would, too. You're a really great friend... oh, for the love of shit..."
"You guys have a beauty school in your trade school?"
"Yeah?"
"Oh... 'kay." Alfie replied, continuing his task as Dean followed Claire further away. Alfie smirked, muttering to himself, "...she thinks I'm 'fine...'"
Still feeling far happier than Cas felt awkward, Dean immediately went in for another long, warm kiss before getting pressed back, "Sorry, yeah, dinner."
I am trying really hard to get this done by GISHWHES, and I think I can manage it! Fingers crossed!
"No," Ben replied with quiet confusion, "She's not. Not about me, not anymore. She gets more emotional over a T.V. show than... shit..."
"He's a kid. He does stupid shit, because that's what kids do. But as well as I know Claire, I have never, ever seen her look that crushed before. You went too far." Dean snapped.
"Okay, this has to be silent. If you two are going to flap your jaws, you can just go home. Freakin' useless, anyway."
"I've met your grandma," Alfie said gently, "I'm sure that's not how they wanted you to learn about this. But you're nearly an adult, even if you found out on accident, you should be able to move forward, things will settle down with your parents, and you'll get past it."
Cas gently snagged both referral slips from Paula's hand, and gestured to his office, filing in behind the boys. Jack immediately took a seat, still quiet from Ben's outburst.
Ben looked up, "I wasn't arrested, not really."
"Um..."
Alfie shrugged and looked around, "Well, um, looks like everything's settled down enough on both sides, Kevin and Margaret want to know if they can bring Mike over to meet her tonight."
"Um..." Mike shook his head, "I don't know, I guess it's never come up."
Alfie's face brightened a bit, "Turns out she's relying on the income she's getting from my work. Some bad investments drained her share of the inheritance a while ago, she's getting back on her feet financially, but she's not quite there yet."
"So, how's the new place looking?"
"Nice try, waffle-boy. I still have to go home for my books." Claire replied, following him.
"I am only trying to take care of her," Alfie said quietly, his voice strained, "Please, just go upstairs and pull her out of there for two seconds so I can get in there and sit down so she's even just a little bit more okay with this?"
"About what?"
"Any, um... you know, since, you know?" Alfie asked. She could hear Kevin objecting that there was no way to be subtle when he could easily guess what they were discussing, and Alfie loudly hushing him.
"I understand he made you uncomfortable, but-"
A sharp laugh barked from her mouth before she could stop it, "You hate her guts, but my worst qualities come from you? How the hell can you say that with a straight face?"
He'd barely finished speaking as the front door opened and subsequently slammed shut behind Jaime, seeming to shake the whole front wall of the house, and causing both of his parents to startle. Set to dash upstairs and paying little attention to his surroundings, Jaime set a foot down on a further-flung piece of laundry, and lost his balance, hitting the flood with another loud, heavy thud, "Son of a bitch!"
Confused, Randy chuckled, "How much stress? You asked me to come out here sometime this week? I went to pick up some parts at the yard and they said you were over here, so-"
"Pressure wash the shop floor," Ben said.
The woman narrowed her eyes, "Miss, are you here of your own volition?"
Thanks for reading! FW)
"Shut up."
"So, it's cute, at least. I guess. Definitely a girl's haircut. Just, um..." lost for words and trying not to stammer, he seemed a bit more panicked as Claire rose from her chair, balancing carefully against the desk as she did, and started for the door, "Wait. Okay, just remember, I couldn't hear him, okay?"
Alfie shook his head, "It's like riding a bike. I needed to talk to you about this place anyway."
"Really? That's funny, we had a guy in here the other day looking for a ring for his boyfriend, we don't see that a lot."
"Hey, so, my dad's engaged. Don't say anything, okay?" Ben whispered loudly over the sound of the bus.
"Hey... I'm gonna go handle the dogs. You turning in?"
"But I couldn't find a stick-up-your-ass in my size."
"Yeah, but we don't, since-"
"The sign is wrong, it's closer to the town."
(A/N: Omg, you reviewers are kind, and generous with your words. Kind of blasted through a couple new chapters, so I'm going to go ahead and upload another very soon... These notes are at the bottom, because I figure not everyone is as into dream interpretation as I am, so I'm going to spell out a couple of things.
"Yeah, but I can make it really easy, okay?" he said softly, turning to lay over her, nuzzling against her neck.
"How you killed him." Chaz answered, "Took me a while, but I got it. You probably knew he was out there parking behind the shop building after it closed, had your dickless little man-bitch cut his brake lines, then you went out for a drive, knowing he'd follow you. Slow down with a semi coming, he can't brake, gotta try to pass you, right? In a hurry, there was no way Will could've stopped, or noticed the eighteen-wheeler."
"Where is Mike, now?"
"She's only ten, she shouldn't..." Cas mused, failing to finish voicing his thoughts.
He was even more surprised when he heard the shop door as he was opening the bays, and Claire was clocking in.
Alfie nodded again, and this time there was a hint of regret, "I know... I know that. That's why I try so hard to bury it. But it's just thoughts. Thoughts and one small screw up, that might not even count if I didn't want it to count so badly, to have had some kind of role to play in his death... But after years of thinking about it, carrying that weight around, I realize, I can't let go, because I wanted him tortured and killed from the minute I knew... Just, cause him to scream and cry and beg for mercy... If I thought I could do that, though, if I thought I was capable of it, I would have left you. Let you find somebody else, somebody good. But I think I would chicken out, so I figured you wouldn't be in any danger from me."
"Last time?" Alfie asked, "... so good... don't want to ruin it."
"It'll be fine. I'm sure you'll be able to use this to talk me down when Ben gets this bad." Dean replied.
"Not that it's any of my business, but who're you seeing for your diabetes?"
"It's okay... You're safe right now, right here..." Alfie kissed her forehead, "I'm right here, whatever you need..."
The gaggle of old hens had returned in force. This time, their numbers were too large for the booth next to his, and they were seated at a freestanding table.
Caitlin cringed, fighting back tears, "I was-... I was getting ready to tell Ben, I was gonna talk to him about it, and, just, now there's nothing to tell, or if I tell him, I don't know if I should, this is... This is all my fault!"
"Ever the optimist," Cas groused. He raised his hand to vaguely indicate the smaller house close by, "I may not be
"I'm good. Where are you at?"
"Well, the first time, he had helped me study for my math test and I got an A."
"That's irresponsible, and would get us closed down, not to mention be harmful for the whole town-"
When Javier entered the shop, he'd almost expected the building to be locked, but Claire, having been told by her husband that one of her fathers was unwell, had proceeded to open the building in advance of working hours, sending Lucas a text to warn him of the situation without requiring he change his morning plans drastically.
Much to his annoyance, Kayla chuckled, "He can't even read yet!"
Cas put an arm around Alfie's shoulders as everyone moved through the living room, "Now, en ce qui vous concerne... du musst hier unten bleiben... Du kannst auf dem Sofa schlafen, weil ... well, because Dean's a prude."
"I'm your bitch." Alfie answered with a chuckle.
A medium sized dog, possibly some kind of underfed Labrador mix, got to its feet in a hurry. It had been curled around a litter of very new puppies with its back to him, and began to growl, ducking her head low in an aggressive gesture.
Somehow, the conversation had turned to whether golf was a legitimate sport, or a distraction for old men with nothing better to do, and the tone had become far more relaxed.
Alfie nodded and steadied himself, "They won't live forever. My father is really starting to have that sink in, he's trying to meet me half way on this. I know what he's up to, and if I play his game by my own rules, then when he's gone, his way of doing things ends. He's pulling the strings for now, but I think, if I can just cut one string at a time, like a marionette, pulling each one over to another hand, I can step in, do things my way, and he'll either be too old or too dead to do anything about it. My biggest condition was that he's changing his focus, this is between me and him, and he has to leave you out of this. I said I'd-"
"... So, that wiggling in there is my kid... That's insane." Kevin muttered.
Dean pulled the black Impala up to the curb at the front doors of the middle school. The passenger side window was open, and Dean leaned low over the middle seat as Cas approached from the door.
"Yeah, but you did."
Also, not much tissue warning here, but about two thirds in, don't blink.
"Better than the coveralls, then?"
"Is your creep-ass uncle still visiting?" Kevin asked.
"Might be time for you to disown her again."
Claire was still in a bit of a haze, and settled the baby to nurse on the other side, and found it fall easier to lay down, "She needs a name. I'm not sleeping until she gets a name."
"How can you sit there and tell me there's a chance, however small, that my daughter could go to sleep, have her baby kick the placenta a little too hard, and bleed to death before she ever wakes up, and-"
"Don't you start... Are you gonna make a speech?"
Claire nodded, wiping at one eye with the back of her hand as Cas stepped closer to give her a hug, "Damn good thing this is the last one. Stupid pregnancy hormones..."
Claire came in and immediately looked concerned, "What's wrong? Why are you crying?... Is that a gardening show?"
"I'm not even mad that you're under there, but I can't just leave you there all day, buddy... I know I said we weren't having sugar before lunch on weekends, but, you know, if you come out, just this once, I'll get you a cookie, okay?"
"Where'd you learn to fight?" Alfie asked.
"Me. He learned the hard way by giving Dean that Impala. Right, Dean?" Alfie asked.
"But, this isn't my fault!" Ben protested, "I didn't do this! And I'm sorry if they're messing with you, but it's not going to get any better from just letting them push you around until you snap, okay? So, I'll stay out of it, but don't try to blame this on me, and I really hope you tell somebody and let somebody help you... I gotta go."
"Having you? We can't get you to shut up." Don Lytton replied with a chuckle, "What've you got for us?"
Cas wet two fingers in his mouth, and met Dean's eyes with amusement as Dean gave a small shiver, watching Cas, and taking in the feeling of Cas' hand barely grazing the skin as it went up his thigh, "Are you going to keep staring?"
"The oil and filter don't just disappear when we remove them from the car, pal."
"Why doesn't she just date a college guy?" Xander asked, turning the radio down.
"You realize, he's nothing like the man you met. He would never-"
"Harker!" Carl called, "Get your brother in law a beer, and quit being rude!"
Claire shook her head, moving to sit on one of the chairs close by, "I don't what I thought... Which is really stupid, I mean, I've had, what? Three? Four days to think about it?"
"Hey," Alfie said quietly, pushing past between Kevin's back and the wall, "Gonna go get my ass kicked, if I'm not back in a little while, come check the dumpsters."
"Can you blame me, though? It's hard when I'm not there, I don't want to set you off."
"Clear a few trees to expand the backyard," Ben replied.
"I don't care what she wants... Even you see her as a spoiled child, the only difference between you two is you can be reasoned with... Again, don't care. You say you don't have my number, you can't give her what you don't have," Alfie answered, using the voice that only came out when speaking to Naomi. He still had his gloves on, and held the phone with one hand, and his helmet with the other.
"Uh, pretty much," he answered, "There's really only a couple of guys that seem a little sketchy and I don't really hang around with them."
"We've been through this a million times. And any time I don't wind up with a fist in my face, it's a win. I'll go calm her down, I don't think Jaime or Lauren woke up."
Margaret started giggling, "Right, like you're going to be doing anything tomorrow."
"Jump! No, you gotta jump and hit-"
"I swear to god," Dean muttered, as Mike quickly covered the distance, "Garth, good to see you, thanks for the advance notice, but my day probably just got busy, so..."
"A kindergartner? ...Uh-huh. ...Well, if you think you have that part under control, that's fine, but when things settle down here, I'll speak to her about it... Yeah, just call him like he wants and give him the update. He doesn't need to know I called."
He was certain she was crying when she answered, "Just be here, okay?"
Dean was waiting when the bus came to a stop at the corner, and took Ben's backpack for him. "How'd it go today?"
"Um, yeah. It was a phoenix. Alfie made it of me."
Ivan leaned in and kissed her softly, rubbing her back gently before stepping away and heading for his truck, parked down the block.
Alfie nodded, "Yeah, okay. I'll pull up some papers off the web, just give me a couple hours after work to set it up."
Mike chuckled, "Cut-throat bingo? Does that count?"
"I think I'm gonna go upstairs anyway." Ben said quietly, "It's kinda getting weird."
"She's got a lot coming to her." Claire muttered.
"What's going on?" Cas asked loudly enough to be heard.
Kevin whispered against her lips as his touch increased in firmness, "I love you, Margaret... Vous êtes si belle. Nous devrions sortir."
Millie, who had been slowly building up a small catering business for select clientele, or, as she joked, people who'd bribe her, planned to use an experimental batch of a new cupcake recipe to teach Emma and Melody a few methods to decorate them.
"Okay, good, because I have this rule, y'know, I don't go out with guys who look prettier than me. So..."
"What?" he asked.
"This shit is why he hates doing portraits. I heard part of it from Kevin, part of it from Linda, and part of it from Alfie, but basically, he worked on this for weeks, like, every free minute he had, as a mothers day gift for her, and probably a good idea, too, since she's so self-absorbed. But she thought it was some kind of joke, said it made her look ugly and old, and she laughed, ripped it, and asked what he really got her."
Henry looked taken aback, "I thought you were kidding."
Cas came back to the car, and got in as the Lyttons went back inside. He was quiet, but he didn't start the car right away, "Ben... what were you doing in that alley?"
"Don't care. I'm tired, and I'm going to bed," Claire replied, gently attempting to push past him with Melody in her arms.
"Why didn't we go by that year to year and a half for planning standard?" Kevin asked.
"Shut up," Margaret chuckled, "We're going to wait a bit before we put an announcement in the paper and see who notices. It'll be fun. Nobody would expect any of it at this point, so people are going to be talking. Do you want us to wait until after your birthday?"
Nodding, Claire continued, "Well, Alfie would have been out of lockup in an hour with more lawyers than the courthouse could fit. Ivan, if he got locked up again in a tiny town like this, even for a couple days, everybody would know, and he basically would have had to move, or be at risk the whole time, being seen as a troublemaker. I heard later he'd planned to just take the beating and shut Chaz up-"
"No," Dean replied strongly, which had been echoed by Xander on his way to the back yard.
"What?"
The door he'd meant to enter popped open a short distance behind him as Xander's voice called to him, "Ben, get your ass in the car already!"
"Yeah? It's okay, honey, you can come in."
"That's for little kids," Melody replied with a slightly less embarrassed tone than she had before.
"That was weird." Margaret said quietly.
"Who's turn?" Sam asked.
"Oh my god, are you taking her in the shop?" Margaret asked in a scolding tone.
Taking a deep breath, and wishing for the cigarettes he was continuing to hide, Cas cast his gaze around the former clearing that had become reclaimed by nature, "Right... okay, she... she had a tendency to share her drugs. I'm sure you're aware of that. Her own misguided version of generosity, while your own generosity is much healthier... Where she would manipulate, and lie to get her way, you have a way of getting others to follow you, you use that charisma to lead. The same my-way-or-the-highway attitude that kept me from pressing for custody, you use it to stand up to impudent customers, and health insurance companies that want to cut your employees' benefits... Honestly, every one of your worst traits, you inherited from me."
"Hey, uh, Mr Peters is here, wants some info on the insurance decision?" Randy shrugged anxiously, "Complaint department?"
Ivan nodded, and continued to watch as Julie tried to take it all in, "Do you really want to be here? In this town, I mean? Because everything is opening up, all kinds of options, small towns, small cities, middle of nowhere, or stuff that's right in the middle of everything. Just, as long as the kids are happy and safe, we can go anywhere, do whatever you want to do."
"I can suck. I can prove it... Were you serious?"
"She could have been angry, or thrown a fit, and I could deal with that, but when she said she'd run away, she was just, I don't know, stone cold."
"Oh, honey, you don't know me," her voice seemed more emotional now, "But I prayed for you for a long time. You don't know how glad I was to hear that you found your way home. Cas and I go way back."
"Did you find it?"
"What, you don't think he'd come after you, personally? You reproduced, providing him with alternate heirs to choose from, he's planning on Claire taking over. Hell, moving her and the kids into a penthouse so he can take care of them under lock and key, you'd probably be his first target. Don't think for a minute that he actually loves you."
"And she's not trapping you with some other guy's baby?"
"Why?"
Claire scoffed, "Okay, Blake. Randy's a really nice guy so he's not going to tell you this, and I'm guessing you haven't met Lucas yet, so let me make this really clear... The customer is not always right. In fact, sometimes they're a lying jackass, but you still have to be respectful. You're going to be very careful in the garage, because if you're not, you're going to get crushed by a car, or have half your hand ripped off. You don't want to know how I know that. No drugs, don't steal, don't throw anything that breathes."
"No, what does that mean?" Alfie asked as she started shaking her head, "C'mon, what is that about?"
As each of them were still catching their breath, wrapped in each others' arms, Margaret squirmed against him with a pant, "The wall's cold... was good a minute ago, now, not so much."
"What?" Alfie asked with a guilty look.
"Well, as long as he's doing his part. That's good they have help, though. So, boy or girl?" Gabe asked, "And when's this one starting school?"
"No?... Why?"
"Uh-..." Claire immediately stepped to the side to look into Jaime's room, "She's not down there?"
By this point, Lucas had slowly wandered in, always entertained by loud, unhappy customers, and he sat down on the arm of the couch close to the door with a bottle of water.
"Claire-"
She continued anyway, "So, he's in here at the crack of dawn, on a cold morning, getting things done for you as a favor, because we never charge extra for early or late pick-ups, and you figured since he was the only one here, you could weasel out of paying your bill? Okay, no, I'm not having this. You're paying in cash, because we can't trust you. You have until closing Monday, then we start the paperwork to press charges for fraud, which we'll recoup from the sale of your vehicle if you leave it here for two weeks, and if you're nice about it, your hubcaps won't get a mammogram courtesy of your rear wheels. But we're done with you. Call the sheriff's office if you want, but they like us, and it's a small town, so you're screwed."
"You didn't even have to think about it. You wouldn't call up Kevin, or Ben, or Cas and tell them to go sit with her and call you back when they found out whether she'd been paralyzed." It was an odd coincidence but not at all unexpected that Rachel's rental car arrived as Dean was speaking, pulling past them with a wave and heading toward the house. Alfie's breathing had changed with his new state of emotion, but he was distracted as Dean continued to speak, staring after the car, "I've wanted to tear into her for that since it happened, but it's not my place. Nothing's stopping you, though... Cas wants everybody at dinner tonight, her too, if it's not gonna stir shit up."
"All right, you have Crowley's number in case you need anything, and he'll be stopping in to check on you at least once a month. All of your expenses have been taken care of, and there's a large stipend set aside for anything else. Any medical updates, they have me listed as your next of kin, so no stress on Claire... It looks like you have everything you need. Oh, wait..."
"I think so." Cas replied, reaching to take down the ladder.
Claire woke roughly as she shifted, the underwire of her bra poking into her painfully.
Claire nodded, and gave Julie a big grin with a glare attatched, "Yeah, except, I just got orders from my boss to train you. This isn't cheerleadering camp, this is a repair shop. We work as a team, we get the cars fixed and back on the road. If you want to last here, you need to play nice. I suggest you pull up a chair."
"If he gets arrested, that would really hurt his chances of getting me back, right?"
"She's responsible... She has an odd sense of humor, but it's very amusing. She even volunteers at the elementary school where I work."
Cas buried his face in his hands. "So, basically, you had a good time, as safely as can be expected."
"Asshole." Xander muttered.
"Knock yourself out. He's on my shitlist, too."
"Any luck with the box?" Cas asked as he came around the corner.
Claire glanced at her bedroom window where she was sure her husband was still sleeping off the unpleasantness that followed the celebration the night before, "What's the worst thing he's ever done? I mean, that you know of?"
Dean shrugged.
owe you for that." Alfie said.
"Got it on camera?"
"The few times I've watched you stand up to my daughter, it's always because of the children, not ever for yourself. And she-"
Dean squeezed Cas' shoulder hard, "Yeah... I know what you mean."
"Yeah," Margaret answered, keeping her voice low, "But that's what she keeps bringing, stuff that needs them."
Jack scoffed, "You have no idea how good you've got it being an only child. Just keep them from moving in together until she's out of the way, and you're golden."
"Don't drink any more of that," Sam replied, "You want some more water?"
"He has no idea. Otherwise he would have called me, freaking out, probably three times before I got home, and-"
Xander picked up the phone and hit the autodial for the shop outside of town.
Cas took a deep breath. His voice shook. "She said... that her mother pimped her out."
At Xander's insistence, supposedly due to cramping muscles, Claire had agreed to sit at the desk for a few hours while he had a turn in the garage. They were busy enough that Javier had been borrowed from the flagship location for a few days, which had given her time to go over his child support paperwork with him to begin an automatic withdrawal from his paychecks, and Chance was slowly beginning to succumb to a nap on her lap as she read through a file on the screen before her.
"Okay, when did you get them done before? How old were you?" Janelle asked, sitting down on a rolling stool as Claire carefully eased into the chair.
"Waiting for you to run out of writing space and see if you cross it out the last time, you knob."
Ben sat at Claire's kitchen table, a place any member of the extended family was content to locate themselves, and bounced Chance gently on his knee while Claire continued on her warpath of paperwork and planning.
"Mike Tran, parents Kevin and Margaret, yeah. He's fourteen, and he's supposed to be at the shop right now."
Now he just needed to worry about minding his own manners for the rest of the evening.
Cas sputtered, attempting to piece together a few words to calm her down, but as she stormed off in the wake of his silence, he put it together. Self blame, which she got from Dean, and surliness, which he assumed had been picked up from both Dean and Bobby.
"Right..."
Cas sat cross-legged with Ben in the small walk-in closet again, working through a rematch on the video game, but with a different motive.
"Porn?" Dean offered, "I think we can both agree it was porn, and drop the subject."
"The girl from Dean's shop? Her and her dad live up the road, the guy that stayed with Ben while Dean had to bury the dogs? Her mother is a fucked up piece of work, and she's trying to take this kid across state lines. The guy can't find the restraining order, this woman was in the house and probably took it." Sam shrugged, "This girl punched Dean in front of a cop car to get them to take her to jail to keep her safe. She's sixteen, and she's sitting in a cell right now rather than go with her mom... I can help."
"Yeah... that was..." Alfie's laughter calmed, "I miss Bobby, he was great."
"And you lost her! You drove her away, and now you're pissed because it worked! So, what do you want? Does she owe you anything? She chose her child over you, so you're throwing a temper tantrum?"
She wrapped an arm around the bottom of his ribs snuggly, and with the other hand, took a firm grasp in his hair, just above the back of his neck.
Claire shrugged, "I don't know, I just know I don't have a better plan."
"Claire, goddammit! ... You can't tickle me! I'm almost somebody's dad! Stop!"
His brother had checked in, there was nothing to be too concerned about. He had picked up a fresh amethyst, smoky quartz, and serpentine from a hippie-dippie gift shop a while back, knowing roughly how long it took for the concoction to wear off. Salt, he always had. Vetivert oil was a little harder to find, but stashed away, wrapped in a red rag in the trunk was a supply that had served him well since he'd run out of John's old bottle five years back.
"If that's how old the little one is. I thought she might like a nice simple dolly," Lucius bounced the bag slightly, "Provided these two are willing to put up with me. I also wanted to say, I'm very sorry to hear about Dean, I'm sure it was a shock. He seemed like a real picture of health."
There were other people to look into, and he genuinely regretted upsetting Margaret, as he'd had no intention of getting on anyone's nerves. He was doing his job as best he knew how, and hoped he wouldn't soon be facing a retaliatory report regarding giving Mike a ride from the high school to meet Margaret half way across town. He'd had Mike call from the car, and was now kicking himself.
"He was at his buddy's house," Kevin murmured, "He was supposed to be up to his ass in chips and XBox... This deviates from the plan."
Claire nodded, and Charlie quickly ushered her into the small room next to the stage to wait with the other three surprise presenters.
Claire let loose a laugh before it dawned on her, "Oh... you heard me through the phone-"
"Mike's asking to see him, Kevin wants to know if that's really a good idea. Any chance we should bring some dinner over? Or that he'd come over here with Sam?" Alfie asked.
He turned off the screen, resting his chin on the back of his hand, stunned, and unsure exactly what he'd seen.
Winchester... Euthanize anything small and furry lately?" she replied.
"I can call him," Mike offered, "If he's having a slow day, he, or one of the guys from the shop might be able to bring it to wherever you need it."
"Claire, you've got to want something bigger! This picket fence life? Sure, it's good for right now, keeps the kids humble. Well, maybe not Melody, she's too much like her grandma-"
Melody quickly had the doors to each of the three boxes open, and began attempting to pass him envelopes and sale ads.
"I would have liked it if you'd stayed," Cas said softly.
Ben nodded, "Yeah, but pissing off Pops and then having Dad step in is the worst it ever gets."
He watched as Henry moved through the parking lot, looking around carefully, and spotting Linda's vehicle, hurried toward it.
Claire shrugged, "It was way in the back."
She toyed at his hair gently for a few minutes, eventually stroking a wide swath of it back from his face, working her nails in to soft scratch against his scalp, "Kev?"
"To be fair, I didn't say they wouldn't care,-"
She answered him with a nod of her own and he stood to leave the room and guide her back to the lobby.
"Bro?"
"Okay, but in all serious-"
"Thanks." Claire said, accepting the plate, making space for him as he moved past her to sit down, "I mean, it was a big freaking wedding, even his dad showed up. You'd think his mom.... Right?"
"It's a studio," Alfie corrected her, "He's setting up his own label, but on the side, and I actually mean on the side, as in, next property over, a tiny little hush-hush rehab with a private airstrip. He wants a facility set up where people can fly in, dry out, work on the sort of projects that give them reason to keep going in their free time, and fly back out."
"Can I get you a soda?" Ivan asked, gesturing to the kitchen.
"Damn," Ivan said quietly, comparing the image to the pencil drawing in his hand, "And then you drew this one off of that?"
"You're not weirded out, are you?"
"Not much in a while."
Leaving his case and making a direct path for the back door, Crowley now noticed several shed articles of clothing. He found the dim outdoor light was already on, and fear crept in as he spotted a form in the water.
Claire gave him a hazy, tear-streaked and hormone laden look as his jostling had started a sharp cry from the child.
Shortly, the passenger door swung open, and Ben climbed in carrying his backpack and the strong scent of glass cleaner.
"... I see... Take me off speaker and give the phone to Dean."
"They're attached!" Kevin insisted, "So, no, not you, and not calling you that, just saying, please, let us treat you like a lady for once, and get the hell out? For us? Our primitive caveman brains have a girl-problem, and your adorable presence is going to make it harder to fix, especially if we have to stop and translate from our native language of grunts for you."
"I'm only the boss of one of them, and only at work, so, good luck with that."
Dean cast an angry glance over his shoulder, "You're literally being a dick."
"Head home. I'll be there in a bit."
"I want to try again." he whispered.
"Airbags. Old cars don't have airbags, sometimes they don't even have seat belts. There's safety ratings, and you know, that red car? Claire rolled it over. The windshield was just gone. I don't know what she was doing, or why she bothered to fix it, it was a pile of trash, okay? I'm not even sure it's the same car."
"So sit on the porch swing." Dean answered, picking up his phone from the nightstand.
Dean waited downstairs anxiously, as Cas accompanied the social worker around the upstairs, answering questions when asked. The process had been far less difficult than most families would have had it, as Mrs Stansfield had been able to keep conservatorship of Xander, and chose to place him with people she trusted rather than lose custody all together.
Cas chuckled, "Not very... I picked them up after you brought me flowers."
Claire nodded, clearly more in acknowledgment rather than agreement, "Okay... And what about the rest of it? What was she yelling at you when you dragged her out of here?"
Outside, Lucas ran up behind the car the man was headed toward, and took a close photo of his license plate. The man froze in his tracks, "What the hell do you think you're doing?"
"I have no idea."
Waiting on her cup to brew, Claire pulled her phone from her pocket, opened her photo gallery, and passed it to him before she went back to the coffee station in the tiny waiting area.
"That doesn't sound like better, that sounds like ditching your problems."
"It doesn't seem
"Yeah? Because you've been doing this since Grandma moved away, and I'm just wondering-"
Ben took his choice of a rather large cheesecake dripping strawberry    sauce, and took a prime spot in front of the door, trying to stay clear of Jack and Trey's aim.
"Right, well," Dean said quietly, shifting Melody's sleeping form to carry her upstairs, "Be honored quietly, you know she's got a lot to adjust to, no need to make it any harder."
Kevin shrugged, "Maybe."
"Husband. Cas and I have been married for years."
"What the hell is going on?" Sam asked, closing the laptop.
"You won't get like that."
"Think that's still about the rumor?" Dean asked.
It had been a trying and emotional day the day before, not only did she feel as though everything was the worst type of wrong, but logistically bound in place, there was no form of defense should anyone walk in downstairs and walk out with her child.
Pulling back, likely considering leaving the bed for the bath, Dean looked down and began to chuckle.
Dean settled, taking in his last inch, his hands on Cas' ribs, breathing slowly against the burn and stretch of the thickness inside him. He carefully moved to lay on Cas' chest, kissing him tenderly with soft, submissive motions as his body began to adjust. Dean slowly started with small motions in a grind against him, carefully feeling his way into a slow, gentle rhythm as he pressed kisses along Cas' jawline and throat, threading his fingers through Cas' hair, "Mm... love you... so much..."
"But... you're not Japanese."
Alfie shook his head, "I'm not."
Alfie was scrolling on his phone the next time Ivan glanced over.
"All right, I got it, lean back." Kevin said, holding Claire's hair with one hand and a towel to her neck with the other.
"Anyway, it just seems like maybe that's a sign that the mental side of things is still healing," she finished somewhat weakly as he lowered her into the bath.
"Why did he leave this with you?" Claire asked quietly.
Okay, so, new chapter! Let's do this! Still building things up! Not hugely exciting, somebody has a personal secret revealed in a manner that was as loving and respectful as a concerned set of parents can manage['omg, you're ruining my life!' - teenager]
Alfie smirked, "Hey, I just showed you I can keep my mouth shut, but if you want to try again..."
In Claire's dream, the bedroom is an allegory for her body/physical contact, however (!) the nightmares and ptsd related nightmares and flashbacks that take place in the same location you actually sleep in are the most horrifying because you question yourself as you're waking up [unfortunate enough to have had this experience].
"I'm not getting in there."
Cas brought the plate and soda can to the bedside table, and hugged her gently, "I can. I've known for years that you were a force to be reckoned with. That little girl couldn't ask for a better mother, or an example of a stronger woman. I'm very proud of you."
"Yeah, sure." Claire answered, shoving her book into her purse and making a beeline for the door.
"It's been few and far between for a very long time, sometimes years at a time, and none at all since I got married, so it's really of no concern."
"Mr Tran, sterilizing yourself is no small matter." the doctor said, sitting down on the rolling stool with his clipboard.
"Good, because I don't know how you're gonna react."
Xander turned his chair back to the keyboard as it gave a squeak under his large frame, "If that thing doesn't give up soon, she's going to leave it to her grandson. She said so when she came in."
Claire kissed him gently before wrapping her arms around his neck and settling against him once more.
"Um, there is- there's two types, the, uh, big, kind of, square one is probably going to be easiest. There's pieces that peel off and the sticky side sticks, like, into to your clothes. They kind of show that on commercials, if you ever noticed that. It works like a big bandaid... And, just, of course Millie can come talk to you when she gets back, but there's nothing to be embarrassed about, okay? I mean, every girl goes through it, it's just what happens. It's a normal body thing, just like, uh, hiccoughs, or um, deodorant. It's normal growing up stuff, you'll be okay... I think I hear the car, though, so I'm gonna go check. No hurry."
"Yeah?" came the usual answer as her music was being turned down.
"Do you hear yourself?" Kevin asked, "I mean, there's not thinking about what you're saying, and then there's talking out of your ass, like you're doing right now."
"I got nothing, so I'm just gonna say, you're a bitch." Dean said with a chuckle, picking up his glass.
"Yeah, but Jack-!" Xander started as Dean cut him off.
"Matt was right. It's bullshit," Ben gently called his brother out with a chuckle.
Cas tightened slightly, and released him.
"Oh, we don't want to make you go up and down the stairs," Rachel said gently, "That can't be comfortable."
"Oh," Jess cooed, "That's sweet."
"Mr Novak?" Ben's voice suddenly came from right next to them, and from the look in his eyes, he'd heard all of it. "I can wait here for you, and tell the doctor where you went, so you can go pray."
As realization struck him, he froze, and Cas had to adjust Alfie's arms around the baby.
Claire opened the door and practically shoved Julie inside.
"Actually, I'm here to speak to you, but if you want your father present, of course that's not a problem."
"Hey, thank
Dean picked up the black backpack containing Alfie's laptop and followed closely behind him out the door.
"He lied on his application," Bobby said quietly, as though he hadn't just listened to his supposed friend causally acknowledge that his child hadn't been shot, having been forced out of his family, rendered homeless, and now desperate enough to steal from someone he trusted. He leaned slightly to one side and pulled folded papers from his back pocket, "I guess he thought I wouldn't notice, said he was sixteen. Even so, I can't have him working for me without him keeping up enrollment in school. He can transfer to the one around the corner from me, I told him if he got his act together he'd have a roof over his head, but if all this comes to light because he tries to emancipate, John, you're gonna be in deep shit."
Margaret went quiet. "Reese had an idea... I told her I was cool with it."
"Kev, why are there rainbow daisies in my face?"
"Bikini?"
"Maybe. But if he decided you were leaving, there's a bunch of people who'd be here in a heartbeat to help him out with that. "
"Hey, Mom, why aren't you home? I thought you were taking Liam in for a check up?" Jack said, loading washer, which made his voice choppy.
"Really?" Dean asked, still fuming, "That's it?"
He was a bit surprised to hear fairly violent sounding vomiting coming from the attached bathroom, broken with the occasional whimper.
"No," Kevin answered, pulling her close, "You're not her, not at-"
Alfie turned around, closing the door after her, unaware that her heart was pounding at being shut inside the small room. Alfie didn't approach her, but she could hear his whisper in the stillness, "This guy is a complete jerk, just... Gimme a minute, okay?"
Keller looked over the monitor, "Garrison...? What the hell is this?"
"Strong opener, yeah."
"Yeah, I know, son, you're doing a great job keeping her comfortable, but, um, Henry just showed up in the waiting room. Now, I know she's been talking to her Uncle Henry again, but did she want him here?"
Rita nodded dumbly.
"You're not even my real dad, are you?" Cynthia asked loudly, making him stop in his tracks to look her in the eye.
Cas scoffed, "Parenting and marriage regularly bump into each other, but they are completely separate issues."
"Yeah, they go places, huh?.. But if they sound like that, you need to bring them to the shop so I can fix it."
Monitoring the situation closely since Dean had arrived, Sheriff Mills closed the door of the patrol car and moved to intercept Dean, who was moving at an aggressive pace, putting a hand out toward his chest and setting the other on her sidearm, "Mr Winchester, you need to step back!"
"Is Claire here?" Lucas asked, taking the time to second guess his phrasing.
"She broke his heart, how the hell can you defend her?"
"Somebody wrote on Claire's locker... I saw part of it before the custodian was done..." Margaret shrugged, "You know there's going to be a bunch of notes, maybe you should get her combo and get them out before she goes back."
It should have taken me maybe ten minutes to patch this together, flesh it out a bit and post it, instead it's taken several days. Why? Because there's a lot to process. In re-reading it to try to be certain it's not just a wandering jumbled blob of words, I've found reading it slow and really taking it in, at least for most paragraphs, was the best way to 'get it.' Also going to put some stuff about some of the unintended symbolism at the end in case you missed it. Goodness knows I missed it the first three or four times! LOL)
"Don't you have a damn casserole to make or something?" Dean snapped, standing up.
"You'll be okay," Mike assured her, "Here, you want the rest of my drink? At least you can wash your mouth out."
Alfie fell over, landing against the side of the Miata as it quickly sank onto all four wheels.
Kevin wrapped an arm around her before raising his hips, rolling onto his other elbow, and reversing their positions as though her weight was nothing.
Marc nodded, "And that would be your, uh... step-mom?"
"She does, she's just... She's really rude, is all. And she doesn't get it that guys have feelings too, so she'll really get on his case, but she's like that."
"I gotta break things off with this girl I'm not really seeing, and she's kind of an ex, but not really, and... And it's killing me," Ben spilled in a quiet voice.
"He said he is. He left his class early. Just try to relax." Claire replied, anxiously checking Margaret's phone again below the level of the bench-like bed, "Deep breaths, think about good stuff, right?"
"That's all I need," Cas replied, "Dean, you're the one I want to spend the rest of my life with, and I would never do anything to jeopardize that."
"I have a solid plan. I'm going to drift through life one adventure at a time. I'm gonna start by becoming private detective, then I'll be a call-girl. Then I'll use proceeds from the book about both to explore the jungles of southern Nevada."
"Can you call her?" Lila fussed.
"We, what?" Dean asked, watching as Cas eyed his left arm once again, and started for the stairs, thankful his clothes were still in place, saving him the trouble of redressing.
"Um, this seems like a family thing, maybe I should-"
"Hey!-" Dean started, but Alfie had already turned around, shooting a pointed look at Claire as he did.
Cas nodded again, and looked at her bag sitting on a chair, "On second thought, maybe I should have gotten you a taser."
