And yet, despite his patchy attendance record and his arrogance and his tendency to piss off both the teachers and his peers, John found himself fascinated by the new boy. He'd wondered about the school Sherlock had been at before (posh, no doubt), what he did in his free time (more chemistry?), where he lived, if he liked sports (unlikely), who he hung out with after the last bell on a Friday afternoon.
'Love'. It is impossible for me not to assign some meaning to his utterance of the word, socially conditioned as even I am to associate significance to its effects in this context. I almost want to stop John doing what he is doing to ask him about it but there is such strong pleasure building within me now that I am unable to focus on the concept for more than a few seconds.
Sherlock pushed John to lie on his back and teased his nipple again, barely breaking the kiss. He leaned up on one arm, hovering over John so their bare chests brushed. Their tongues met and Sherlock hummed in delight. John licked into Sherlock's mouth, causing him to moan. The heat was building now as John's hand moved from Sherlock's hair to the back of his neck, carding through the curls at his nape and tugging lightly. Sweet shocks of pleasure sparked in Sherlock's veins and he broke the kiss to rub his face over John's chest, capturing his nipple gently between his teeth. Sherlock released it and licked, lapping like a cat.
“I want to see you,” John panted as he slotted himself into the space between Sherlock’s thighs, lying on top of him, his weight pressing Sherlock into the mattress. Sherlock nodded, panted a “yes, John”, and groaned. When their erections finally came into contact they both gasped loudly. John steadied his weight on one arm and brought his other hand up to Sherlock’s face.
"So," I reply. I study him for a moment. He bears my scrutiny as he has always done, head high, eager and waiting.
Sherlock walks briskly through the crowds of laughing students, crossing the campus and making for the little restaurant. His stomach was tying itself in such knots that, even though he likely wouldn’t have eaten much anyway, he's not sure he'll manage a single bite. The butterflies are back in full force and he feels like he's swallowed a lepidopterist, collection and all.
Annoyed that he can deduce nothing further and elated that this means he has to go inside the coffee shop to actually speak to John and gather more data up close, Sherlock (unsuccessfully) squashes the butterflies in his stomach and marches into the coffee shop.
John eventually pulls away and strokes my face again. "All right?" he asks nervously. I am more than all right, John. I brush my hand through his hair and pull him down by the neck for another kiss. Now he has given me one kiss he can never stop bestowing them on me. I will not allow it. I am certain I am doing this all wrong but John doesn't seem to object to my apparent lack of technique. He giggles and kisses me harder. We lose ourselves in each other, and soon become desperate and part, gasping into each other's mouths. There is such hunger in John's eyes.
He turns his head slightly but doesn’t acknowledge me. His eyes are fixed in the middle distance and his hands are clenched at his sides. I tell him I am sorry. It feels like an empty platitude, it doesn’t matter that it’s true. He says he needs time. I nod.
"Yes, and? I'm here now, aren't I?" he said. Half of the class snickered and the other half looked at each other worriedly at this display of impertinence. Dr Bradstreet sighed.
Oh yes, this was definitely a Sherlock room, he thought. The clutter strewn chaotically all over every surface still seemed to have some form of order; there were papers and books, glassware obviously nicked from the school labs, an ant farm, a fencing trophy, a wooden model of a Spitfire - “My cousin’s,” Sherlock said, shrugging.
The figure, dressed all in black, turns, and the gun is pointing right at me. At my chest. At my heart. (No, that’s wrong. Well, technically it’s right. But my heart hasn’t been mine for a long time.) And I see a face I have grown to love, a face I know John loves, looking back at me coldly. A face I have to have grown to love, because it’s a face John loves. Everything is grinding to a halt and racing to full speed all at once.
Sherlock sits down and takes off his coat, reaching for the hot coffee. John was right; it’s bloody baltic outside. He’s just raising the cup to his lips when he notices John has gone very quiet. He glances at him over the rim of the cup and almost pours the steaming liquid into his lap at what he sees.
'You certainly proved stubborn, as did the coffee stains I see you tried unsuccessfully to remove from the surface on the far side here. I told you to stop drinking that swill from the cafeteria.'
John’s eyes are wide, his pupils dilated and he’s licking his lips. Sherlock guesses he’s staring at the exposed skin of Sherlock’s throat, and at the buttons of the stupidly tight shirt pulling across his chest as he reaches for his drink. Sherlock congratulates himself internally; this shirt was definitely the right choice. He makes a bit of a show of swallowing his mouthful of coffee, then sets the drink down on the table and cups his hands around it.
“Don’t,” he said warningly. For once Sherlock’s minimal sense of self-preservation kicked in and he shut his mouth with a click. John shut his eyes, prayed for patience, snorted and stood up.
"John, more," he moaned, lost in his desire. John obliged, adding another finger and licking away the pre come gathering at Sherlock's slit. Sherlock's breath was coming in great gasps now, his pulse racing and unsteady. Then John curled his fingers just so and sparks went off in Sherlock's mind, his blood thrumming in his veins. He arched his back, squirming as the intense pleasure swept through him. As soon as it had passed he felt his eyes suddenly fill with tears, chest heaving with heavy sobs. John's hand moved away and he gathered Sherlock's shuddering body into his arms. He murmured soothingly as Sherlock trembled, overcome and furious at himself.  His face flushed flushed with shame. He had ruined this, spoiled it before they'd even got very far. It was just too much, after waiting so long and wanting so badly, the feeling of John's fingers inside him so perfect and it was just too much.
He told me once that he couldn’t go back. He said it so quietly that I almost missed it, lost in the feel of his hands on my skin as he changed the dressing on my chest. It was the closest we’d come to speaking about anything more than the weather or my health or tea or any number of hideously mundane subjects. I don’t love her anymore, he’d said. I’m not going back. I knew he would, in the end. He is too good a man to not to. He said he didn’t love her anymore, but he could not punish a child.
Sherlock sighs as he makes his way back to the library. One more complaint to the Head of School, he supposes. He's almost finished though, he just needs to complete his dissertation and his final exams then they'll be rid of him. He'll go to London for his PhD - with his marks (not to mention his age and his background) they'll accept him in a heartbeat. Then he can-
Sherlock spends the next few minutes deducing the student waiting for her macchiato (literature postgrad, owns a cat, shares a flat with her male best friend), then moves to the first year walking by the window (engineering, failed his exams last year and had to repeat them over summer, lives in a shared house and hates it). At every 'amazing' and 'brilliant' from John, Sherlock's confidence grows and he relaxes little by little. His verbosity and hesitant attempts at playfulness seem to inexplicably delight John.
Contrary as always, John walks in and sits down next to me on the bed. His hands are wound tightly together in his lap. I shut my eyes and resolve to ignore him until he leaves.
Well. He’s obviously just arrived, despite Sherlock’s own lateness. His cheeks are still a bit pink from the cold and he’s warming his hands on the mug, so he hasn’t had time to drink much of it yet. Why was he late? Did he go home to change too? Unlikely. He looks perfect. He always looks perfect. So what delayed him?
The ellipsis indicating John is typing pops up, then disappears, and then pops up again. Sherlock bites his lip and stares at his phone, willing John's reply to come through before his heart can burst out of his chest with anticipation.
But the thought of listening to someone, someone interesting, and having them listen to him in return, holds more appeal that he'd care to admit. It isn't that he wants some insipid, vacuous moron to moon over his every word, of course not. It's more the ebb and flow of debate, someone to question his assumptions and ask him how he arrived at that conclusion, someone who I'll want to hear the process of his deductions and how he came to see all of that information. Someone who isn't predictable, who doesn't shy away from the 'freak' who sees more than he ought and isn't afraid to share his observations. Someone who just... Someone who listens. And maybe... Smiles at him. Just a little smile. A tiny grin. Friendly, a-and warm. That would be... That could be... Nice.
“I don’t care, Mycroft!” he yelled suddenly. John smirked to himself. Sherlock was pacing again, listening to his brother’s no doubt slimy tones.
"Come on, Jean," Mike teased, "we 'aff to get to ze French class. Zere are many words we must learn if we are to be, 'ow you say, seducing ze girls?"
John sniffs, once. Lestrade meets my eye over John's shoulder. I struggle to my feet and forgo the opportunity to scold Lestrade for the goofy and adorable comments. I opt to eviscerate the thief instead.
"You certainly made an impression," John murmurs. Sherlock clears his throat and turns away towards Molly to hide the flush of pleasure creeping onto his cheeks.
John inhaled sharply. Sherlock closed his eyes and waited, feeling close to tears and horribly vulnerable. He didn’t dare move or speak. Despite his pyjamas, he felt exposed, and even though he couldn’t see John he could deduce the thoughts chasing themselves around John’s mind. Please, Sherlock thought helplessly.
His hiccups however were threatening to derail the entire endeavour. John quickly snapped the incriminating photos as Norwood paused in his typing, head cocked to one side. He was listening intently for the tiny squawking sounds for which Sherlock had been responsible. Desperately trying to stay still and silent, Sherlock held his breath. John watched through the gap in the doors and they both breathed small sighs of relief (Sherlock internally for fear of squawking again) when Norwood resumed typing at an even more hurried pace than before.
Sherlock slams the bedroom door shut and drops his bag beside the scruffy bed. His room is the cleanest in the flat but that's not really saying much. There are journals and research papers strewn over every flat surface, books piled high in the corners, filched glassware and pipettes in a box below the window. The skull, given to him as a gift by Mrs Hudson in his first year, sits proudly on the tiny, crappy IKEA desk he bought to replace the one which mysteriously caught fire that first week. Odds and ends, scattered throughout the room, make this impersonal space feel more like his own, giving personality to the cookie cutter rooms which make up the shared student hall flats. Were it not for his obnoxious flatmates Sherlock might spend more time here.
"He'll meet you in the library, he has a free period just now, same as you. Might as well get started, if you're going to be prepared for the prelim. Off you pop!" With that, she gestured to the door and John was dismissed. He stood up, grabbing his bag and closing the door behind him. He huffed a laugh to himself as he headed for the library.
“What?” John snapped. Sherlock just sat there, frowning. Watching. Always bloody watching. Fine. John would just ignore him. Clearly he was thinking about something, deducing how crap John’s day had been. Well, fine. John had tried to explain to Sherlock before why this particular thing pissed him off so much, but it seemed Sherlock had deleted it.
John snorted. “That may be so, unlikely, but it might be true. Still, not having that kind of offensive, homophobic stupidity on
John seems determined to drive Sherlock completely mad as he employs everything he knows about how to draw out the most pleasure. He licks and sucks and kisses and swallows until Sherlock is a panting, moaning mess, propped up only by John's hands on his arse and his shoulder against the wall. Sherlock long since stopped caring about the sounds he's making, and John's muffled moans around his cock echo in the changing room, mixed with the slurps and groans from Will and Greg across from them.
John broke the kiss and they rested their foreheads together, Sherlock panting and gripping John's shoulders probably too tightly. John stroked up and down his sides beneath his coat as if he were gentling a startled horse.
"I want you too," he replied, trailing kisses down Sherlock's chest. For a moment Sherlock was lost in the sensations but then he recovered himself to stop John's descent. Oh, how he loved the feel of John's mouth on him, but he was getting too wound up and he knew if John were to swallow him down as he had last night, Sherlock would come too quickly. No, he wanted more this time and he needed John to know.
Sherlock snorts. He isn't especially interested in who's getting off with whom among the student body. He isn't lonely, he tells himself. He has his work, his research, his plans for postgrad studies and maybe his doctorate. He isn't lonely.
Drawing a breath and squaring his shoulders, determined not to make a total arse of himself with this amazing, gorgeous boy, John rounded the shelf and practically marched over to the table Sherlock was occupying, settling himself into the chair opposite.
Need and urgency were beginning to take over, and Sherlock gasped when John rolled them over and proceeded to press filthy kisses over any part of Sherlock he could see.
"Fellas, there's someone I'd like you to meet," John announces, pulling Sherlock into the humid room behind him. Sherlock adopts his best indifferent mask as the faces all turn towards them standing in the doorway. He clears his throat and tries to ignore his heart pounding in his ears.
The lunch bell interrupted Sherlock mid-flow and he stood abruptly, gathering his textbook into his leather satchel.
John got out his own book and flicked to the page they’d been studying. He looked back up to see Sherlock watching him closely again. Undaunted, John stuck out his hand. A tiny line appeared between Sherlock’s brows as he frowned slightly, his eyes drawn down to John’s outstretched hand.
Sherlock sat up, nose wrinkling at the tacky, dried sweat and come on his chest and stomach. “I need a shower,” he announced, getting out of bed and stretching. He walked to the bathroom door and stopped, turning to look over his shoulder shyly. He extended his arm to John, who was looking a little lost among the rumpled sheets.
“Join me?” Sherlock asked softly. “I’ll rub your sore shoulder and… any other parts of you that ache?” John’s grin could have lit all of London.
His nerves soothed by John's gentle breathing and occasional snuffles into the pillow, Sherlock turned back into the bathroom and picked up the lube he had chosen. He padded quietly back through to the bedroom and slipped between the sheets, tucking the lube under his pillow and curling himself around John's sleeping form. He had intended to fully prepare himself in the bathroom and wake John slowly, turning John towards him to present himself, ready and open, a gift for his lover. Now though he wanted to share everything about this with John, to feel everything. This would hopefully be their last first time.
"You alright?" John asked innocently. Sherlock frowned. He wasn't sure. Was he? What was that? Had John just kissed him to shut him up? Oh God, had John noticed Sherlock's arousal? What if... what if John knew?!
“So,” Sherlock agrees. They lapse into silence once more. Sherlock drums his fingers nervously against his cup, still deliberately not watching as John raises his to his (lovely) lips to take a sip. John catches him and Sherlock flushes, looking down and forcing his fingers to still. He can feel the smile spreading across John’s face.
Greg sniggers and mutters something under his breath to Will that sounds suspiciously like "buggering John's lovely fella". Will at least has the good grace to colour a little when he laughs.
“Sherlock,” John says warningly. Sherlock holds his hands up in mock surrender. John’s tone is still mostly playful but there’s a hint of annoyance in it too.
I stand unsteadily, shrug off the stupid blanket from my shoulders and wave away Lestrade’s proffered arm. I am a bit not good at this, I know. I walk over to John and sit beside him.
Well, alright, maybe he was allowing himself to become a bit distracted. But he was still doing very well. His biology and physics grades were superb, his French not so much but that was ok. It was extra credit anyway, it didn't matter as long as he passed. His maths and English were as good as they'd always been.
A lead weight settles in Sherlock’s gut. Oh. He’s ruined this already. John is about to tell him he was going to ask Sherlock to lose his number. Coffee once was enough, now John has lost interest. Unsurprising, really. How Sherlock had ever managed to convince himself that John would enjoy his company enough to want to repeat the exercise, he has no idea. He isn’t normally susceptible to self-delusion but apparently when it comes to John Watson he is as much an idiot as the rest of the world’s population. That kiss on the cheek? The one that Sherlock has been treasuring for the last day or so, working up the courage to initiate a conversation with John again? That was clearly just bestowed out of pity. Pity for the awkward, too-intelligent, arrogant chemistry geek who would otherwise never experience a kiss of any sort. That makes sense; John is nothing if not kind and caring and sincere and all that is good in the world, it would be just like him to want Sherlock to have something small to-
John catches Sherlock looking at Greg. He raises an amused eyebrow but there's a flicker of vulnerability in his eyes. Sherlock blushes even harder and averts his eyes from Greg and his nice arse. It's nothing compared to John's arse though, Sherlock thinks. He bites his lip and risks a glance at John as John walks forward to grab his towel out of his locker. John winks at him again and gestures towards a bench attached to the wall.
John's presence had from that very first day been a steady guide for Sherlock, and in return Sherlock provided John with a renewed sense of purpose. Even as they explored this new facet of their relationship Sherlock couldn't help but feel as though in some way things had always been like this.  True, it hadn't been easy. They still squabbled and sniped and bickered; John still lost his temper and stormed out; Sherlock still got lost in his head and too focused on his experiments. But now as well as awkward apologies there were kisses, each full of promise to do a little bit better next time.
He stops, certain that John has absolutely no interest in his bloody green carnation-tiled fireplace. John sits there, that same lovely, soft smile on his face. Sherlock swallows and takes the plunge.
“Look, I don’t care,” Sherlock was saying, “just do it! I know you can, so get off your lazy arse, out of that cake-induced coma and make yourself useful!”
"Take a seat, now, you're being disruptive," she pointed to where the rest of the class were sitting and waiting to see what came next, "and turn to page 394." The boy merely smirked and started towards the desks to take his seat. John was briefly startled to see the boy walking towards him. The boy took the only empty place directly in front of John, pulled out his textbook and immediately bent forward over it. And that's when John noticed.
Sherlock lets his eyes fall closed and ignores the tiny ache in his chest until sleep finds him and drags him under its soothing blanket of nothingness.
But no, I know I am all the better for allowing myself to love. And I do. So wholly that I often fear I will consume everything and leave nothing behind but an empty shell. It drives me both into John's arms and to reject them coldly, as I did tonight.
He’d taken half a step towards the sofa before he clocked it, and suddenly Sherlock’s eyes snapped open.
Their little bubble was broken, however, when John looked up and saw Phil passing their table. John nodded his head and said hello as he normally would, but he couldn’t fail to notice how Sherlock’s fingers had tensed at the edge of the book. Phil looked at Sherlock in undisguised contempt. John felt the hairs on the back of his neck prick up and he unconsciously clenched his fist, waiting for whatever Phil had to say.
A warm smile broke across John’s face at Sherlock’s touch and he let Sherlock pull him down for a proper kiss. Their mouths met, lips bruising, tongues stroking, for long minutes. The urgent desire between them was banked for now, in its place a fierce adoration.
“Obvious,” Sherlock retorted, not looking up. John didn’t miss the tiny smile he tried to hide, and was inwardly delighted.
“Thanks for telling me,” John said gratefully, then swiftly changed the subject, his mind already on what he was going to say to Sherlock when he next saw him.
I shudder and move my hips, tilting them to relieve some of the pressure on my now straining erection. I groan and lean up into his gentle kisses in my hair. It's blissful and wonderful and I never want him to stop.
But their slow and steady pace was driving Sherlock utterly mindless. So far they had fumbled their way through several admittedly satisfying sexual encounters, hands in each other's pants like teenagers. But Sherlock was desperate to give himself fully to John, to let John see him at his most vulnerable, to allow John to be part of him and to feel their bodies connected. Sherlock's previous experiences had been brief and forgettable,; he ached to be taken and claimed by John.
I was trying to smile at John, be reassuring and confident, but apparently my face is showing far too much. I hastily get my expression under control. I let cold distance cross my features and throw my sharpest glare at Lestrade and the thief.
Luckily the place is empty when they arrive. Molly greets them cheerily as she struggles with an enormous bag of beans and tells them she'll just be a moment. John chuckles and goes over to help while Sherlock stands there, feeling out of place and a bit lost. John heaves the bag onto the counter for Molly and returns to Sherlock's side.
"No, no, let me hear you love," John pleaded, "let me hear you!" Sherlock acquiesced with a shy glance then closed his eyes and focused on what his body was feeling. A litany of "oh" and "John" poured form his throat as he chased his climax.
Grunting in frustration, Sherlock pushed back from his microscope and placed his hands on either side of it, flat to the table. The smooth wood beneath his palms was cool to the touch, and he closed his eyes.
"Hey, you okay?" John says quietly. I sniff and berate myself for my weakness. Stupid, stupid, stupid, you always were so stupid Sherlock! I turn away from his careful hands, standing up and trying to gather the scraps of my dignity. I pull up my trousers and fasten them. John does the same. Then we are standing in my bedroom on opposite sides of the bed, not looking at each other. This feels wrong, somehow. He should be here, in my arms. I hate it.
“He’s different,” Greg said quietly, “and he doesn’t make any effort to hide it.” He saw John’s expression and hurried on.
“What are your plans after graduation then?” John asks. Sherlock tells him about moving to London for his PhD, maybe setting up his business.
Right. Refocus. He throws his phone down again and goes back to his latest experiment, intending to concentrate on work for a while, to let his brain come up with a solution. But his mind refuses to play along. It keeps wandering back to John. John's voice. John's smile. John's kiss against his cheek. Sherlock frets with his experiment for all of three minutes before grabbing his phone, typing a message to John and sending it before he can overthink the whole thing. Again.
“Yeah,” Mike agreed, somewhat breathlessly. “I’ve been talking to Sherlock myself actually, he’s great!”
“Aw, c’mon Cap!” Vic said, elbowing Seb who in turn caught the attention of the rest of the rugby team. Expectant faces turned in John’s direction, and he fought the urge to look for that head of dark curls just one more time.
"Oh God, Sherlock," John mumbled. Sherlock opened his eyes to see John staring up at him, undisguised adoration on his face. He tried lifting up a little and sinking back down and they groaned in unison.
"Sherlock? I need to check on you," John says quietly through the door. I don't answer. Just go, John. Don't bother.
“Yeah, course I do,” John said warmly. “In fact,” he continued feeling suddenly rather shy, “you’re my best friend.”
Awareness crept back in slowly. Sherlock squeezed his eyes closed and tried for a moment to claim back the restful peace a couple hours’ sleep had brought. Twisting his mouth in annoyance, he resigned himself to waking fully and began to take stock of where he was.
"S'nice," he mumbled, "love your touch." Sherlock's nerves melted away completely with that simple statement, and he cupped John's face with his palm, tilting John's head up for a languid kiss.
It's the latter which has brought him here today, on a blustery Saturday evening, with his laptop and notebooks spilling out of his bag. He had to grab them in a hurry to avoid his flatmates, dashing out of the door before they came back from lectures to get ready for a night out drinking. He would dearly love to move out of halls altogether but he can't afford a flat by himself, not with bloody Mycroft holding onto his trust funds until his degree is completed. Bloody Mycroft. Bloody Seb, and Philip, and Victor. Sherlock has shared with them for nearly a year now and every Saturday is the same. They go out, get drunk, try to pull, fail, come home, interrupt whatever Sherlock is doing, make fun of him, get more drunk, eventually pass out in the kitchen/living room/bathroom. Seb and Philip are worse than Victor, who at least looks vaguely apologetic the next day. The most annoying thing is that, for all their stupid bravado and idiotic comments, Sherlock can't help but feel a small stab of hurt at every joke, every jibe at his expense. He's long since given up bothering to deduce them; there's just no challenge in it anymore. So instead he spends his evenings in his favourite spot, reading journals, devising new experiments, or just simply sitting quietly to think.
From that Monday morning, John kept catching himself not paying the slightest bit of attention in chemistry. He'd gone from being nearly top of the class to barely scraping through. All because of the boy in front of him.
John clapped a hand over Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock tried not to shudder as John pressed his body weight against him. They were squashed together from chest to knee, the long, gangly lines of Sherlock's frame fitting perfectly around John's gorgeously strong shorter one. His throat was starting to ache from the annoying hiccups but he wanted more than anything for John to stay exactly where he was. The situation was becoming increasingly precarious and utterly intolerable.
I felt its familiar pull when I took the call. Mycroft’s smooth tones informing me that the plan had been put into motion. The plan he had devised to prevent me from returning to an assignment I would be unable to complete. I do so hate to leave things unfinished. But we didn’t know then what we know now. And now it’s too late.
We sit together in silence after that. It’s only when I hear distant chimes marking the time that I realise it is six hours into my birthday.
Sherlock looked vaguely embarrassed and shrugged. He rubbed his upper arm self-consciously and gestured for John to follow him. John was still staring up at all of the windows and fancy brickwork, but he didn’t fail to notice just the tiniest hint of discomfort on Sherlock’s part as he carried on distractedly rubbing his arm. Dismissing the thought for now, John followed his friend around to a side door and into the house.
Well, that last one was easy enough to answer. Despite having been at the school for a couple of months now, Sherlock didn't seem to have made any friends. John often wondered how lonely it must be, not to have anyone to talk to, to muck about with, to tease about girls. And maybe... Boys too?
John sat on the edge of the bed and tried to keep his eyes from drifting to Sherlock’s mouth as he talked, but it was a bit of a lost cause. He just had a very expressive way of talking, John told himself. It was natural to watch him as he explained things, hands waving about, lovely lips forming long words… Sherlock suddenly stopped in the middle of his sentence and looked up from his book. “John?” he asked.
It’s when he gets to the coffee shop that the nerves really set in. John is sitting at the table in the window, sipping for a frankly huge mug of macchiato, no hot chocolate, and looking…
Sherlock leans back in his chair, a mock serious expression on his face as he steeples his fingers beneath his chin. John gleefully waits to be wowed.
Foolish, Sherlock scolds himself, such thoughts are pointless and foolish. He only has two more semesters to get through then he can move straight into his postgrad. By then he'll be of age to access his trust fund; Mycroft can't hold onto the purse strings once he turns 21, it's in his parents' will.  Then he can get a flat to himself, focus on his research and maybe, once he has his PhD, maybe then he can start his consulting business, like he'd dreamed of when he was little. Independent, self-sufficient, admired for his talents and his mind. Alone.
John smirks at Greg and nods as if to say, see, anything you can do... Sherlock glances at Will, who is flushed to his ears and panting slightly. Greg grins back at John and before any of them can react, drops to his knees in front of Will and whips off Will's towel. Sherlock can't help the tiny gasp that escapes his throat. Will's erection bobs in the air in front of Greg's face and when Greg looks up to Will, tilting his head for permission, Will can only plead in a whisper.
They sip their drinks in silence for a moment, each not wanting to give away their nerves. Sherlock sets down his cup and tries not to stare at John. For his part, John looks as though he is trying equally hard not stare. John cracks first.
"Yeah mate, nothing at all, except nick a priceless bloody book," Lestrade counters. "Let him up John, I'll take it from here."
"God, Sherlock," John breathes, "I've been dreaming about this, about you. So gorgeous, just look at you." Sherlock moans, low in his chest, surprising himself with his reaction to John's words. John's praises turn into pleas.
I have a plan, or rather, I had a plan. Simple really; lure in the shark, remove its teeth, let the family go live in peace. It’s Christmas, after all. Time of cheer and goodwill to all men. Time of forgiveness, even for those who have done unspeakable things to those whom they love. Is there such a thing as the unforgivable? I fear if there is, I have at the very least come closest to it. Unforgivably stupid, that’s certain.
It isn’t my fault, I know that intellectually. This is not my fault. And yet my mind cannot seem to help but trace everything back to my most fatal error. My grossest miscalculation. John always pays for my mistakes.
Sherlock got up from his chair, experiment forgotten. John was wriggling around with his duvet, trying to find the optimum position in which to sleep. Sherlock snorted as he grabbed the corner of the duvet and yanked. The optimum position for John to sleep was clearly in Sherlock’s bed. Obvious.
This library, the old library, is housed in one of the older buildings that will eventually either have to be completely renovated or knocked down. It's drafty, smells funny and is managed by possibly the smallest and fiercest librarian ever employed at a university. Ever. Mrs Hudson has a reputation amongst the students as warm, funny and always good to talk to, but she takes no shit from them either. She'll help you when you're upset about something, offering tea and biscuits in her little office just along from Sherlock's spot, but if she thinks you're being a twat she'll tell you so. Sherlock of course adores her, and she dotes on him in return, letting him get away with all manner of minor infractions for which she'd give any other student a proper bollocking.
John twitched irritably. “I told you, it doesn’t matter what they said, they’re just homophobic twats and I was sick of it.”
In his mind he pictured them, entwined as one beneath the sheets, their bodies moving in perfect synchronicity, slow and deep, reverent touch and delicate kisses. Sherlock imagined the feel of John's sun-dappled skin under his palms, the taste of John's kisses on his tongue, the weight of his body pressing down on Sherlock as he entered him carefully, oh so carefully, the feeling of John inside him. The thought of being so intimately joined with the man he loved made him shudder in the doorway as he watched John sleep in the early morning light of the bedroom.
The boy was new, he'd just transferred to John's school right at the beginning of term. Some kind of genius, so the whispers went, and it must've been true because even though he was a couple of years younger the boy had started straight into the advanced classes. It'd only been a week but it seemed this new boy wasn't much for making friends. John felt a little guilty at that; he didn't even know the boy's name. Something posh though, from what he'd heard in the hallways. He'd glimpsed the boy before but it was a big school with lots of kids and he'd never really paid a lot of attention. His own group of friends was quite small; just Mike, who shared his ambition of becoming a doctor and incidentally, his desk in chemistry. And Greg, who he'd known since they were four. Then there was Phil, Carl, Vic, Seb and Tim from the rugby team, but he wasn't really close to any of them.
John's mouth against his certainly did the trick of cutting off the hiccups mid-flow. Sherlock almost brained himself jerking back in surprise at the sensation of John's lips pressing onto his own. Once the initial shock wore off Sherlock's battle became not holding in hiccups but not collapsing under the heady waves of desire and arousal and
Sherlock preens and blushes. “Yes, well,” he says, “that and decent coffee have clearly improved your abilities.” John smirks.
“Mmm,” John sighed, tightening his arm around Sherlock’s waist and pulling him back even closer to John’s body. A groan escaped Sherlock’s lips before he could stop it. John began slowly, maddeningly, grinding his hips into Sherlock’s arse. The heat of John’s erection pushing and sliding between his cheeks through his pajama bottoms was intoxicating and Sherlock struggled not to reach down under the waistband to touch himself. He could feel the pleasure building in his belly and groin as John huffed and rutted into his arse, humming low in his throat. It was impossible to resist, and biting his lip to muffle any sounds he might make, Sherlock snaked a hand down into his pajamas. He shuddered in John’s arms as he began to stroke, whimpering when John started to press sleepy kisses into his curls.
“Alright then,” John said softly, and without warning, stepped forward. His swing was perfect and his left fist collided with Vic’s nose, making the other boy shriek in pain and stumble backwards. He felt a blow to his middle and moved to return it, but another punch caught him in the face. He staggered, pain blooming in his cheek, and spat a bloody mouthful onto the lino floor when yet another fist crashed into his mouth. In the ensuing scuffle, John couldn’t really tell if Seb had run off or joined in. After that, it was all a bit of a blur.
"No John, I want you. I want you inside me. I want to feel you, I want you to feel me." Sherlock felt his face flush as he spoke and forced himself to hold John's gaze. It was worth his blushes to see the darkening of John's eyes on hearing his words. Licking his lips, John nodded.
John nodded and lapsed into silence again. He neither needed nor wanted his chemistry teacher's help. They sat for a moment and John avoided his teacher's eyes. She sighed and leaned forward, her voice going soft as she spoke.
John stops and buries a hand in my hair, stroking through the curls and tugging lightly. I moan again; how can he immediately know all of the buttons to press to reduce me to a quivering wreck?! It is both a welcome development and a terrifying one. John is shushing me as I tremble, stretched out beneath him with my bottom as far in the air as it can go with his weight settled pleasantly on my legs.
Not yet, not yet...he tried to tell his body. The intense pleasure sweeping through him was becoming too much and he tried desperately to hang on. He couldn’t come first, not yet…”John!”
Sherlock stands dumbly gaping at the grinning face of John Watson. He blinks and tries to process. Just what the hell is going on here?!
It turned out that the rugby team’s bullying didn’t come up the next time John saw Sherlock. He found himself huddled over an enormous book about serial killers in the lunch break, listening to Sherlock’s hushed voice telling him all about H.H. Holmes in Chicago. Sherlock seemed fascinated, and John was happy just to listen. It was a really interesting topic anyway; how he’d gone so long without being caught. John didn’t think anything of it as they leaned over the book together, heads almost touching as Sherlock traced the drawings with his fingertips and explained the limited forensic methods of the time.
'Please. Dregs in the cups you leave behind, one of which had a phone number written on the side of it. Either you're not interested in 'Sarah' or you're not reusing the same cup. Simple. That and the fresh grass you traipsed in on your shoes, indicating you'd come here directly from rugby practice, via the cafeteria in the Wilson building, which is the nearest one to the sports facilities. Conclusion: you have no idea what good coffee is. Or where to find it.'
I drop to my knees. My coat swirls behind me with the gusts of the helicopter blades. Dimly I hear Mycroft’s voice but I barely register what he’s saying. I stay there, on my knees, rigid in the spotlights as the men surround us, weapons drawn. I try to school my face but I feel lost, untethered. And then I am pulled to my feet. I am dragged away. I hear John’s voice, or I think I do. I can’t tell anymore. All I can hear is the echo of the gunshot, the report reverberating in my ears. It all seems distant somehow. No matter. I will accept the consequences of my actions. Whatever the cost, I had told myself. Whatever it costs, keep him safe, keep him happy. I cannot fail him again.
"John?" My voice is muffled but I'm certain he hears my confusion. My heart beats wildly in my chest and a dangerous shard of hope lodges itself firmly in my throat.
Oh John. You, always you. Only you. More, I always need more. Please, John. I need to know we have more, there is more to come, there is more time for us. And he knows, he gives as he takes, every piece of me is his. The wave crests with his caresses and I let it all wash over me. As it recedes he is still murmuring, his words as warm as his embrace.
He sticks the note to the desk, underneath his laptop and looks up a few journals he's been meaning to read for the past week or so. His dissertation is almost finished and it's nice and quiet here. What's the harm in spending a little time catching up on his reading before he has to go back to his horrid flat?
Soooo.... turns out I couldn't just leave it where I left it. Here, have some gratuitously daft smutfluffing.
'There. Tidied up for you. Nobody else comes up here anyway and it's a nice quiet place to study so I will not piss off. Kindly or otherwise.'
I nod and lead him out of the building. We don't say another word to each other as I summon a taxi. Lestrade calls to John as it arrives and I stand and watch the scene as they talk for a moment. I start deducing the assembled officers and John hurries back over. He still says nothing, just looks at me with an odd expression I can't place. Then he gets in and we leave. Lestrade's paperwork can wait for John tomorrow.
'Damn, busted. Yeah you did tell me. And you also told me I clearly didn't know good coffee. You were right. Care to show me where to find the good stuff? ;)'
“Your brother’s a bit of a twat, then,” John said matter-of-factly. He turned to look at Sherlock, who was rubbing his arm, his cheeks pinkened again. John raised one eyebrow in mockery and then they were doubled over, giggling.
John’s vision went red and he turned on his heel to storm off. Greg and Mike hurried to catch up as he marched across the pitch. Greg grabbed John’s arm and halted him in his tracks.
Greg raises his hands in mock surrender and laughs as he backs away. "Well for what it's worth, I'm glad to see you so happy John," he says. John's smile gets impossibly wider and he nods, seemingly wholly in agreement with Greg's assessment of his emotional state.
I go back to my violin. I’m thinking about raising it when I hear it. Footsteps on the stairs. Then John, in the doorway, duffel bag in one hand, unspoken question in his eyes.
pouring into his veins as endorphins flooded his system. John smiled where they were connected and a dart of tongue dashed across Sherlock's lips. His mouth dropped open in a silent gasp of appreciation and John pressed his advantage. He licked his way inside, teasing and gentle, and it was all Sherlock could do to stay upright. He swallowed back a groan of pleasure as finally John pulled away.
Sherlock frowns a bit and blinks. He's starting to feel a bit nervous again. Will chuckles and claps a friendly hand on Sherlock's knee briefly. He leans in and whispers Sherlock's ear.
We argued earlier tonight. I remember every word, spoken and unspoken, that passed between us. It's my fault, probably. Usually is. He was trying to help, I think, but I was upset and I lashed out. I haven't done that in a while. Not sure why I did it this time, not even sure why I was really upset. He understands these things so much better than me. These tangled thoughts. Sometimes I wonder.
"Thank you, sweetheart," John said. He plucked a packet from the drawer and dropped it beside them on the bed. "Now, where was I? Oh yes."
John grinned, giving in the the impulse to reach over and stroke his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. Soft, like he’d always thought it’d be. Sherlock arched his back and nudged his head up into John’s hand.
"I-" he starts, then stops. John waits patiently. "I really enjoyed this," Sherlock says in a rush, not meeting John's gaze. When he finally does look up John is smiling again. Always with that damn smile, Sherlock thinks dazedly.
Sherlock slumps in his seat at the back of the lecture theatre. The professor is droning on and on and it's insufferable. Seb and Philip had stumbled in around 2am, disrupting Sherlock's napping. The few hours' sleep he'd gotten in between getting home from the library and his rowdy flatmates' drunken singing were a distant memory, as he'd failed to get back to sleep. Instead he'd spent the remaining hours before this appalling lecture poring over a new article on his laptop. His eyes felt dry and his brain sluggish. Coffee. He needed coffee. Then he would go over to the old library and work on his dissertation for a while.
“So, I had my biochem exam today,” he says casually. Sherlock raises a questioning eyebrow. “I think it went really well,” John goes on, “but then, it would. I had some rather excellent pointers on the bits I was struggling with from a brilliant genius, after all.”
"Oh, now John, now!" He tried to not to sound desperate but the breathlessness of his voice betrayed him. Fortunately John was in a similar state. "Okay, shush love," John whispered, turning onto his back. Sherlock frowned in confusion as John moved him, lifting his legs so Sherlock was straddling his lap.
Sherlock let out a soft cry when John's finger breached him and his hips jerked off the bed as John sucked the very tip of Sherlock's prick into his mouth. Heat pooled in his belly as John lifted his head and kissed down his shaft, slowly moving his finger in and out, circling and stroking. Soon Sherlock was keening, begging for more.
He kisses my hair softly, then my closed eyes, my cheeks, my jaw, my neck. His hands on my sides, his arms under and around me, his legs entwined with mine. I want, no, I need him, to take me apart, slowly, then put me back together. Sweetly, with such care, he does.
Sherlock tumbled over the edge, crying out in ecstasy and spurting hotly over John’s hand and their bellies.
John, to seeing his face again, there in front of me, right there, instead of in my mind’s eye. Hearing his voice again, his fond admonishments, his grumpy cursing, his laugh. God, his laugh. The sound of his laugh echoing in my ears had been all that I had, once upon a time. And now I was coming back, I would make him laugh again. Laugh at me, if you want John, I don’t care. Part of me still doesn’t, if it means he is with me. Just the two of us, against the rest of the world.
"It'll be easier for you, this way," John said encouragingly. Biting his lip, Sherlock gently grasped John's cock and gave it a couple of long pulls. Beneath him, John groaned and closed his eyes, pleasure written across his face. Smiling in satisfaction to himself, Sherlock guided the tip of John's cock to his hole and slowly began to lower his weight, taking his time and bearing down until John was fully inside him.
I sit in the open window, idly blowing smoke up into the night sky. John will be angry with me for the cigarettes but I need them, tonight of all nights. He's angry with me anyway so might as well do something, anything to make it stop.
"William Holmes, he's going to tutor you," she said easily, as if John's stomach hadn't just fallen out of his arse.
"Is everything alright, John?" Dr Bradstreet asked. "Only, you were doing reasonably well in this class until recently and I can't help but notice that you seem to be having a hard time concentrating."
He huffs a laugh and I frown into the pillow. The bed suddenly creaks again as John gets up on his knees beside me.
The minutes ticked away as Norwood finished gathering dirt on his wealthy superiors, and Sherlock and John impatiently waited for him to get the fuck on with it. Thinking that once Norwood left, he would text Lestrade (or have John do it, he had Sherlock's phone already anyway) and they could finally get out of the bloody cupboard, Sherlock was caught off guard by a furious attack of burps.
Hands entwined, they made their way to the bathroom, kissing between giggles. The roof repairs could definitely wait.
“Still amazing though,” John says, still grinning as he finishes his coffee. “Go on, I know there’s more!” Encouraged by the genuine smile in John’s eyes, Sherlock narrows his own and concentrates.
'That is amazing. You knew all that from my coffee cup and grass on the floor?! See, told you. Genius. ;)'
“John,” Tim said quietly. John’s patience was running out. He shrugged restlessly as Tim shuffled his feet.
Sherlock feels featherlight caresses in his hair and opens his eyes to find himself snuggled up next to John's thigh in their bed. John is carding his fingers through Sherlock's curls, a smile playing on his face as he drinks his morning coffee from a battered travel mug. Sherlock cuddles in closer, his wonderful dream fading slowly as he wakes.
"Please Sherlock, let me touch you, let me please you," John begs, hands pulling gently at his arms to encourage Sherlock up into his lap. Sherlock barely needs any invitation and gets up unsteadily so he can move to straddle John. John lets go of his arms and leans back on his elbows to gaze up at Sherlock hovering over his groin. Sherlock immediately commits the picture of John beneath him to memory.
But it wasn’t to be. I tried, and I failed. I failed miserably, I got it all wrong. He was so angry, I anticipated that. I didn’t anticipate much else though. And then, it was all I could do not to push. Not to make it worse. Not to give him any (more) reasons to shut me out. I would take what little of him he could give me and be content. I promised myself. I promised them (him). And now look where we are.
“Yes, I had a shit day. Yes, it’s that twat I told you about. No, I’m not surprised you deleted it. Christ Sherlock, it’s a wonder you even bothered to listen in the first place, it’s so dull,” John said brusquely.
“I mean, he’s blunt sometimes,” Mike carried on, then coughed. “All the time.” Greg laughed. “He’s so bloody clever though,” he said and Mike hummed and smiled at John. He didn’t quite hide his grin, and John felt his anger simmer down somewhat. Even if some of the rugby lads were total prats, these two were good friends.
"I want you," Sherlock said, his voice dropped low and rough. "Oh, I want you." John smiled and looked up, meeting his eyes.
I sigh at the self-pitying turn my thoughts are taking, stub out my cigarette and light a fresh one. I'm mostly sheltered from the rain and my coat keeps me warm enough. I don't really need the cigarettes but at the same time I do. Crutch; not the aluminium kind. I can smell the fallen leaves starting to rot beneath my feet, the fresh, clean scent of autumnal rainfall, and him. He's not here of course, he's in the house, but funny thing, olfactory memory. I can also see his silhouette through the window, he really should close the curtains. He's drinking again, I note glumly. Every night since it happened he drinks; not enough, too much. Every night since it happened I stand in the garden and watch the house.
John snorted. “Yeah well, I only just found out I had a tutor, so…” He said. Sherlock didn’t reply, just fixed John with a look of bored contempt. He flipped open his textbook and looked pointedly at John.
There are crumbs and bits of paper on the desk. Again. Again! Sherlock grumbles to himself as he crosses over to it and stares down at the mess. He lifts an arm to sweep the mess into the bin again when a slip of paper catches his eye. There's writing on it and, curiosity getting the better of him as usual, he picks it up as he sits down.
He stops when he feels something stuck in his pocket. He pulls it out and unfurls it in his hand. It's another post it.
“Don't stay here all night,” John said warmly as he headed for his bedroom upstairs. “You’ll get a neck cramp or something.”
“S’ok, just a bit thirsty,” John said, reaching into his bag to pull out his sports bottle and successfully hiding his blush. Sherlock seemed to frown at himself, and John wondered if he had noticed John’s staring. He was about to say who knows what to Sherlock when, twisting to put the bottle on the bedside table, he noticed something black and yellow peeking out from beneath the pillows. His hand automatically stretched out towards it when a sharp yelp from Sherlock arrested the movement. Too late - John’s fingers had already clasped the soft toy and he was cradling it in his hands.
John glanced around his shelf to see Sherlock gazing out of the window to his right. His tangled hair was catching the sunlight again, the coppery hints in the curls glowing warmly. His eyes were bright but somehow sad, and his mouth. His mouth looked soft but almost wistful. His profile was striking and unusual, with those sculpted cheekbones, and he had an overall air of effortless elegance to him, even just sitting looking out of a school library window. John wondered how he’d never noticed just how beautiful Sherlock was. Too busy only thinking about his hair, his brain supplied helpfully. Fuck off, he told it.
Sherlock was waiting for him in the library. It was quiet, not many students having a free period right before lunch on a Wednesday. John spotted his (gorgeous) curls on the far side of the room and ducked behind the nearest shelf to compose himself for a moment.
John looks.... perfect. He's wearing a deep navy cashmere jumper and dark jeans, his blonde hair and golden skin glowing in the low light of the restaurant's candles. His face crinkles with delight when Sherlock approaches and Sherlock finds himself smiling shyly back. The waiter takes Sherlock's coat to hang up at the door and they sit down. Nervously Sherlock picks up the wine list, just to give his fidgety hands something to do. There's nothing he can do about his whirling mind, as his cheeks flush under the weight of John staring at him.
Sherlock scoffs as John curses and sets his bag on his now empty chair to play hunt-the-wallet among the rugby kit in the bag. Sherlock takes advantage of John’s distraction and pays for their drinks.
John chuckles and heaves him off to the side. Must've said that last out loud then. Cold air rushes in as John gets up and leaves the bed. Icy disappointment and rejection instantly replace the warmth of John's touch and kisses and Sherlock tries not to do anything pathetic like curl into a ball and cry. No matter how much he feels like doing exactly that, he'll preserve a modicum of dignity if he can.
Suddenly Vic stood up and snarled angrily. “It’s disgusting,” he spat, “that dirty fucking queer in our school!”
This is precisely why Mycroft avoids all feelings. Emotions are so unseemly, messy and unpredictable. He is lonely. I know what lonely is. I know it when I see it. I tried to tell him once. Goldfish. He raises his eyebrows at me. Apparently I said that word out loud.
Before they've realised the time the afternoon has passed and John reluctantly stands up to leave. Sherlock pays for their drinks, ignoring John's protests, and gives Molly a large tip. She winks at him in return.
I realise I am staring at his hand on my ankle. The telly switches off. I look up in surprise. John is watching me. His eyes are intense with something I can’t place and I bite my lip nervously. His gaze flicks to my mouth, then back to my eyes, then away. Then back again.
“What is it this time, freak?” Phil sneered. “Watch it, John, he’s probably getting himself off under that table!”
"Here," John whispers, reaching up and deftly flicking Sherlock's trousers open as he reaches in to pull him free. Sherlock sighs with relief, then figures out what John has in mind. He leans down and lets go of John's cock to bring his hand up to John's face. John takes the hint with a smirk and licks Sherlock's palm wetly, lavishing it with his tongue. Sherlock has to close his eyes again. If sex with John is like this every- He cuts that thought off. There's no guarantee of a next time, he warns himself.
"Always wanted to do that," John sighed, "feels lovely." Sherlock nodded and pushed his head up a little into the contact. They lay there a while, just enjoying the simple closeness of being in one another's arms. The hum of arousal that simmered between them was still present but had lulled.  John seemed content to doze, so Sherlock took up exploring what he could reach of John's lovely body.
“Don’t do anything stupid, John,” he pleaded. “Sherlock doesn’t want you to know, or he’d have told you, right? We’ll speak to the lads again and put a proper stop to it, ok?”
"Y-you-?" Sherlock squeaks, internally screaming at his own brain to get a bloody grip! John laughs again, but strangely it doesn't feel like he's laughing at Sherlock, despite his apparent lack of comprehension.
“Wait, no,” John says. Sherlock’s heart sinks to his feet and he looks away. He’s been revelling in John’s attention but he’s sure he’s come across as too freakish. And now, John will stop smiling at him and telling him he’s brilliant and-
Tim caught up with him just as he reached the door and stopped him with a hand on his arm. John startled and stepped back to let the other kids into the classroom, curious as to what Tim wanted.
Sherlock kicks aside a pile of dirty laundry in the hallway as he makes for his room. He hardly spends any time here, only dropping by when he has to sleep. Most of his time he splits between the old library and the labs, researching and conducting experiments into the wee hours. The janitorial staff in the labs have gotten used to seeing him there, hunched over a microscope or scribbling in his notebooks. A few kind words in the ear of the head janitor from Mrs Hudson and they mostly leave him alone. He doesn't conduct anything dangerous in there; after several small and one or two... More significant explosions at school prior to be accepted at university, he learned to keep his more destructive experiments to his makeshift lab at home. Besides, it's more fun to destroy expensive ugly furnishings of Mycroft's choosing, however accidentally, than to potentially lose another of his favourite spots on campus.
Sherlock stands in the alley, mind swirling, face burning with a bright blush, cheek tickling from the feel of John's lips. He shakes himself and starts off back towards his flat, cramming his hands further into his pockets and fighting back an enormous happy grin.
"Should you what, John?" I snap. I don't mean to snap, I just cannot stand these moments where emotion dictates, rather than logic. Everything is so messy and so imprecise! But I cannot stop thinking about his calling me 'love', it repeats and repeats in my mind, endless echoes in my ears.
The smoke curls up into the faded orange light of the streetlamps. Giving away my position, I think dimly, should really know better. Should really know better than to be standing here in the first place. But then, I never was one to do what's best. Even when I try to do what's best, I fail miserably. That's how I lost John. How I keep losing John.
He sets down the wine list and glances up through his lashes, not trying to be coy but doing it anyway. John is watching him, and his eyes flick from Sherlock's open collar, to his mouth, and back up to his eyes again. He smiles approvingly and Sherlock flushes anew.
John chuckled to himself for a moment, then something clicked. He sat bolt upright. Sherlock twitched but didn’t otherwise react.
“Alright, they started it,” he said wearily. Sherlock looked triumphant for a moment then seemed to remember what they were discussing. “They said some pretty nasty things about a very good friend of mine,” John admitted, “and I wasn’t going to stand by and let them say stuff like that.” Sherlock just waited.
John sighed. “Yeah, well that what friends do,” he countered, “they stick up for each other, rainbow drag or not!”
"My flat is old," he suddenly blurts. John seems unfazed by the complete non-sequitur and merely raises an eyebrow. Sherlock blushes and looks away from John's gaze so he can try and regain some control of the link between his mind and his mouth.
“Hello John,” Sherlock replies quietly. John leans up and presses a surprisingly soft kiss to Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock melts into the brief contact and blushes anew as a hot spike of arousal shoots through his gut and pools in his groin. John reluctantly steps back and it’s all Sherlock can do not to fall forward into John’s body, hungry for more. The scents of grass, sweat and John mingle in his nose and for a moment he thinks he actually sways on his feet. Ridiculous.
John cut him off with a heavy sigh. “Look, it doesn’t really matter why, they’re just arseholes,” he said. “Well, some of them, at least.”
Sherlock forces himself not to just toss his violin aside carelessly as he grabs for his phone. He reaches it and fumbles, dropping it twice before eventually managing to swipe open the reply.
Outside of school, John was happier and more settled than he’d ever felt. But in school, he and Sherlock hardly spoke. A fair bit of John’s time was taken up with classes and rugby practice, and Sherlock seemed to make a point of avoiding John whenever he was with his rugby mates. John tried not to be hurt by this apparent rejection; he wanted Sherlock to feel welcomed as much as possible, and yeah alright, part of him wanted to show off his incredible friend, show the other lads how much fun Sherlock could be, how amazing his endless curiosity and surprisingly silly sense of humour were. A few of the lads had made some odd comments, but John just shrugged them off. He didn’t really know Vic and Seb and Phil all that well, and Tim had been keeping himself to himself a lot. If Mike and Greg had noticed anything, they certainly hadn’t said so. It was all just a bit… odd.
“What? I can’t hear you, love,” John said, barely even noticing the endearment until Sherlock blushed to the roots of his curls.
“Only one in the world,” Sherlock replies. A complex series of expressions chase themselves across John’s face and Sherlock has barely had time to parse them when they vanish.
Before he realises, the waiter is clearing their plates and offering them dessert menus. John says something polite and the waiter retreats again. It's just as well John steps in when Sherlock is lost in examining the pattern of hairs on John's lovely forearms, because Sherlock is sure if left to him he would've been considerably less than polite.
John is not gay. He may have been attracted to me at one time, back at the very beginning, but I rejected him clumsily and anyway, I would never now be able to know John that way just once. I've been aware for a long time just how deeply, wholly in love with John I am. And one throwaway thought, mumbled loudly enough to be heard by John and two others, will destroy everything.
"Now, if you'll excuse me," Greg says cheekily, whipping off his towel as he saunters away. Shouts of "cover it up Lestrade!" and "these bloody Frenchmen!" join John's giggles in the air as he shakes his head at his friend's bare, retreating arse. Sherlock takes a very brief moment to reflect that, purely aesthetically speaking, it's a rather plush, attractive arse.
“Hi Sherlock!” He greets cheerfully, gesturing to the seat and cup opposite him. “I got you a cappuccino.”
"When I can try that on you?" I ask. He collapses into giggles, looks at what he calls my 'John this is a serious experiment' face, and grins widely. "Because the average refractory period for a man over 40-"
That was a mistake, I realise it now. He shouldn't have pushed me but I shouldn't have pushed back. When will I stop getting it wrong? I cannot afford to keep messing things up like this; John assures me that it happens in all relationships and part of being successful at it is recognising when you are in the wrong and apologising, compromising for each other. I try but I still fumble and it's infuriating.
“How’s your revision going?” John asks, leaning back in his seat and sipping at his hot chocolate again. As he shifts in his chair his knee presses into Sherlock’s, just a light pressure against his leg, and Sherlock is certain John will be able to see his pulse shooting dangerously high as his heart tries once again to escape his ribcage. Focus, he tells himself.
The flat is suspiciously quiet when Sherlock gets back. He glances around, taking in the mess caused by four young men living together in a relatively small space, and remembers - ah, the athletic union ball, that's where his flatmates (if one can call them that) will be. Trying to get off with the girls on the hockey team, no doubt, or trying to keep up with the rugby team's drinking. Sherlock's mouth twists into a gleeful smirk. Seb in particular is going to feel that in the morning, if the rugby team's reputation is anything to go by.
The ride back to Baker Street is equally silent. I leap out of the taxi as soon as it pulls up and retreat to my bedroom, discarding my coat and suit jacket on the way. I lie down on the far side of my bed in the dark on my front and try to stop my thoughts circling in despair.
"Sit down, John" the teacher said kindly, gesturing to the chair beside her desk. John sat down carefully and waited.
Sherlock throws on his coat and scrambles into his shoes, before realising he’s still dressed in his pyjamas. Cursing himself under his breath, he shrugs out of his coat and flings his wardrobe open to find a shirt and trousers. He refuses to overthink any of this and selects his favourite plum-coloured shirt and a pair of black suit trousers tailored just so to hug his behind. He forgoes the suit jacket. Too formal. A thought suddenly occurs. Is he overdressed? Does he have time to find those dark jeans? They’re not as flattering as the tailored trousers, but he doesn't want to go overboard, just for coffee. But John is waiting. He can’t keep John waiting. What if John gets fed up waiting for him, and leaves?!
"Alright love?" John asked again. Sherlock's mind stuttered to a halt for a moment at the endearment. He pulled back, opening his eyes. John's smile was soft and joyful. "Alright?" asked John again, and he took one of Sherlock's hands in his, twining their fingers together. Sherlock nodded and stared in amazement at their joined hands, revelling in the feel of John's palms against his own.
"Oh what the hell?! They're gay?! That's even worse, now you have to arrest him! He assaulted me, that poofter assaulted me!" the thief puts in.
The tutorial is a disaster, of course. The PhD student teaching them is an idiot, and a pompous one at that. Sherlock had to correct his fallacious assumptions, for the benefit of other members of the class as well as to prevent his brain from rotting in boredom. Still, probably shouldn't have brought the haircut into it. He hadn't intended to out both the teacher and the student he's been sleeping with by mentioning it. One more deduction that he'd been expecting, there.
My face is wet and suddenly I am sobbing silently in his arms. He rolls me over and I bury my face in his neck. He strokes my hair and says nothing. His touch tells me all. I don't say it but he knows. I will say it tomorrow, I promise myself. Eventually I subside and we settle, wrapped around one another. This is how I wish to spend the rest of my days, exactly like this. Seven years is not enough yet. There is nowhere else for me, here is where I belong.
“Roof’s leaked upstairs,” John said wearily. “All over my bed. Mattress is sodden, so I’m sleeping down here tonight. I’ll call a roofer in the morning.”
Sherlock blinked a little and glanced away in a manner John might almost have deemed shy. Too quickly the openness John had glimpsed was shuttered away and an unwelcome aloofness draped itself over the features John was now admiring up close. His voice, when Sherlock spoke, was resonant and deeper than John felt any kid of their age had a right to.
Gradually Sherlock's thighs protested his body's position and he lifted himself up and off, stifling a ludicrous giggle as John's softening cock slipped free of him. John sniggered and rolled onto his side, stripping off the condom, tying a neat knot in it and unceremoniously dropping it to the floor. He wiped Sherlock's come from his chest and neck with a corner of the sheet, looking at Sherlock over his shoulder with a cheeky wink. Sherlock blushed inexplicably and picked at his side of the sheet a little sheepishly. John took pity on him and rolled back over, arm outstretched, beckoning. Sherlock shuffled in close, resting his head on John's chest as John played with his curls. All was quiet and peaceful, utterly blissful.
made John look like that. The swell of pride he feels at this realisation is only dampened by the ache between his own legs, his erection pressing uncomfortably into the fastening of his trousers.
Sherlock resisted the urge to stick out his tongue. He cleared his throat and gestured down the hall to his bedroom.
John is still smiling. “I was going to say that if I ask you to tell me how you know all that stuff it might make you seem ordinary, when really, you couldn’t be ordinary if you tried.”
“You’ve played rugby since primary school and though you initially took it up to please your father, you did actually enjoy playing. You became captain very quickly, most likely due to the respect you command from your teammates. You like to win, as you like most sportsmen, have a highly competitive streak, and you often competed with your older sibling when you were younger,” Sherlock says, in something of a rush. John sits back and looks up at the ceiling as he pretends to consider this. He tilts his head cheekily.
'Stop drinking the cafeteria coffee and you might be better able to retain what little knowledge your lecturers impart.'
Just as I open my mouth however Lestrade shoves the man roughly towards the end of the hallway and growls something about incitement charges and abusive language in the presence of police officers. The hallway falls silent as the heavy door bangs behind them.
Sherlock reached under the pillow and produced the bottle. John grinned and kissed him again, taking the bottle from him and opening the cap with a small snick.
Sherlock flounders. What now? Can he ask John if he wants to get coffee again? Should he ask how his revision is going for the biochem exam? See if John would like to come over and kiss him, properly this time? Can one just ask that? In a text message?
“Hi love,” John says, reaching up to brush Sherlock’s hair away from his forehead. The spark of joy in John’s eyes makes Sherlock blush.
So why is John Watson smiling at him? The best that Sherlock can figure, it's because they inexplicably keep running into each other and John can't help but be friendly, even knowing what Sherlock is like. Sherlock tries to pretend that the couple of times he has accidentally let himself catch John's eye as they pass, the smile he receives does not warm his heart and make him want to do anything he can to make it happen again. He absolutely refuses to let himself blush with pleasure at a simple smile from a gorgeous boy. Unfortunately this has happened once or twice, resulting in Sherlock hiding in his coat collar, curls flopping over his brow so that only his eyes are visible and cursing his pale complexion under his breath, until the heat leaves his cheeks. His lower lip is sore from biting it to stop an answering smile spreading across his face.
Sherlock waves a hand dismissively. “No, I do,” John says, the flirty tone dampened into a more serious one for a moment. “I honestly was having a tough time with that module and without it I would have an even tougher time getting into the postgrad research programme I told you about. You really helped, Sherlock. More than my tutorials and my professor.”
I am aware that one of the main reasons for my refusal is that I don’t want to disappoint John. Not that he would notice if I did relapse at the moment, but the thought of him somehow finding out at an undetermined point in the future keeps me from reaching for the little box beneath the floorboards in my bedroom. The box with its smooth wood surface and velvet interior, offering blissful oblivion. Tempting. Very tempting.
The man himself was lying on the sofa, eyes closed, one hand resting on his chest, mouth slightly open as he dozed. John couldn’t help the wave of fondness coursing through him at the sight. One of these days, he was going to just reach out, ruffle those curls and kiss that bloody man awake.
Greg has nothing but mischief in his eyes as he reaches forward and tugs Sherlock to his feet. He strokes Sherlock's arm and shoots a cheeky grin at John, who is now rapidly turning a fetching shade of pink. The sight of John's lizard brain making itself known makes Sherlock swoon and want to beg on his knees for John to mark him and claim his body as only for John. The heady feeling makes Sherlock's head swim as John moves to push Greg's hand away (not as gently as John perhaps thinks) and wrap an arm around Sherlock's waist, angling his body so Sherlock is almost behind him and John is firmly placed between Sherlock and Greg. Will watches this display with widening eyes, licking his lips and grinning. His pupils are almost completely blown and Sherlock is certain that his own are in a matching state. Greg concedes gracefully and casually shrugs. He smirks at John, issuing an unspoken challenge, before turning to pull Will close to him and kissing him fiercely.
'You're welcome. I'm glad to see that you are no longer cluttering up my workspace with your crumbs. You may continue to use this desk in future. And I do not know it all. Though I will concede that I know rather a lot.'
Lestrade comes over to me and says something, but I’m not listening. I’m looking at John. John is a few feet away, staring unseeing into the distance. The blues of the vehicle lights and the red of the blood on his face mingle into a ghastly pattern, a tableau of horror I know was intended just for me. In death there is so seldom the peace many might wish for. So I have found. Cruelty is in its nature.
The room was dim but cozy, and John looked around before stepping in behind Sherlock. Sherlock tugged off his long coat and tossed it carelessly over a chair, then stood in the centre of the soft carpet, hands on his hips and his eyes on John. John turned in a circle, a slow smile creeping over his face.
“You’re just too clever for your own good,” John says warmly. Sherlock looks away, remembering the last time someone told him that. Their tone was considerably more Arctic than John’s, and there followed a rather painful connection between the boy’s fist and Sherlock’s face. The memory of Mycroft’s expression when he’d arrived home from school with tears in his eyes and yet another note from the headmaster swims before him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and managed to cover his blush as John sauntered past and shut the bedroom door. Sherlock stayed in the hall for a moment, listening as John shifted in the sheets, making himself comfortable. Sherlock’s bed was much bigger, firmer, and warmer than John’s, his bedclothes soft and light. His sensitive skin could not bear rough textiles in slumber and Sherlock preferred to sleep naked so as to better regulate his temperature. Sherlock flushed anew at the thought of John curled up in sheets that had sheltered his nude body.
"Hey, you alright Sherlock?" John asked softly, his other hand coming up to cup Sherlock's face. "Look, I know I-," John started. Sherlock blinked and stayed silent, trying to squash the ember of hope flickering in his stomach at John's touch to his cheek.
"Wha-?" was all Sherlock managed to reply. John snorted and pushed the cupboard doors open with his good shoulder, stepping out and catching Sherlock around the waist when he followed. Sherlock's legs had lost their rigid form and turned to liquid at some point in the last few minutes. He tottered for a moment before his muscles and bones solidified once more and he was able to stand again.
The reaction was immediate. Vic’s face went an ugly shade of red and he scowled in what he must’ve thought was a menacing way at John. John stood his ground.
John looked for Sherlock at lunchtime but he was nowhere to be seen. He wasn't really paying attention to Mike and Greg and the other lads as they sat down at their usual table, laughing and ribbing each other. He was thinking about his chemistry tutor; the way Sherlock’s eyes had lit up as he wrote down formulas and laid out the key concepts they’d been working on in class for John to absorb. He was terse, blunt and spoke at a ridiculous pace but John felt more confident in his knowledge after just that one 45 minute session. John was looking forward to spending more time with Sherlock, even if it was only to talk about chemistry.
“That was brilliant,” John told him, “I don’t know what Sally sees in that twat though. How did you know?”
Sherlock closes his eyes, forcing himself not to curl into the space beside him that John has vacated. He hears John searching for something, then a scratching noise that seems like... that could be...?
I am thinking about this when I notice that John’s hand has dropped to my ankle and he’s rubbing it absently as he watches the film. I try not to focus on it too much in case he stops. I don’t want him to stop. Ever. If it were up to me he would always touch me like this, casually, calmly, as if it were completely normal. Which it is. I think.
“Jesus, Sherlock, your mouth,” he grunted. John withdrew his hand and wrapped it around their cocks, sliding up and down steadily. Together they gasped and grunted, Sherlock’s mouth dropping open at the sensation, breathless gasps spilling from his lips. John kept up a steady pace and Sherlock felt his orgasm building quickly, rushing him towards completion.
The sensation of being connected with John in this way was indescribable. Sherlock closed his eyes and struggled not to come straightaway. He felt so full, so deliciously full. He moaned as John ran his hands up and down his thighs.
Outside, John shuffles on his feet a bit, looking at Sherlock with an odd expression. Sherlock stands with his hands jammed in his pockets, unsure of what he should do next. He really wants to spend more time with John, but how does one ask that?
"I know it's fine," he says, a little more clipped than he'd intended. He rushes to clarify. "I mean, I-I'd like that, if you- that is, I'd be happy to show you, i-if you- it's fine with me, if you-"
“Hey, wait a second!” John called, frantically picking up his things so he could follow Sherlock out of the library.
Sherlock vows to collect all of the many different colours and shapes of post-it as exist in the world, just for John.
Sherlock tried, he really did. But there was no stopping it now. Norwood would hear them and make a run for it, and John would have to chase him down because Sherlock would be bent double, tears streaming down his face, as his guts made a valiant attempt at escaping the confines of his ribcage through his nose and mouth.
The notes get progressively friendlier, and more than a little flirty, and Sherlock soon gets a swoop of anticipation in his tummy every time he enters the library. He keeps each of the notes tucked away safely in his oldest notebook. He'd never admit to it, but he likes that someone is taking the time to leave them, just for him.
Sherlock scrunched up his nose and tried to hide his face. His voice was muffled by the sofa cushions.
Sherlock reads John's response with a completely goofy grin on his face. Then his phone goes off again.
John had heard enough. He stepped into the room and cleared his throat. The boys all turned to look at him in the doorway. Seb and Phil at least had the decency to look a little sheepish at being caught out, but Vic stared back at John in challenge.
I’ve already made my choice. I made my decision almost instantly. He has to die. There is no other way. I will be the one to do it. I have made John carry too many of my burdens, he will not carry this one. This mistake is mine, and mine alone.
The waiter brings a jug of water and menus, then retreats. It’s not awkward, Sherlock is thrilled to discover. It’s just like it was in the coffee shop; pleasant and soothing and calming and delightful just being with John, sitting here, together. The silence between them is full of promise (or at least Sherlock hopes he’s interpreting that correctly) but it’s no less sweet for the appreciative glances they exchange. Finally John clears his throat and leans forward.
He realises that he's been sitting staring into space, fingers poised above his keyboard, a soppy expression on his face, for the last five minutes. All because of John Watson and his damn smile. The pleasant warmth in his body leaves him quickly as he scowls at himself, getting up and stuffing his things into his bag. He's late for a tutorial. Not one he ever goes to, but still. Anything to stop his mind simpering over John Watson. Or mooning over the note-leaving sporty medic who makes a mess and annoys him.
