“Thank you,” Dean sighs. Benny stops his movements and looks at Dean over the flames. Dean closes his eyes and lets himself feel tired for the first time in a few days. Sleeping isn’t exactly something you get to enjoy in Purgatory but since Benny, he’s gotten to enjoy it a little more than when he first arrived.
“I have some clothes you can borrow if you get an interview,” Dean offers. He stares at the hands in Cas’s hair. Dean doesn’t miss the way that Benny grabs a handful of Cas’s hair and pulls on it gently. Cas closes his eyes again and Benny gives Dean a shit-eating grin like he knows something that Dean doesn’t.
“Of course. Follow me. I have a few forms for you to sign. After that, I’ll get you the boxes you’ll need.”
He opens the door after a few moments and my nose is assaulted by the smell of weed and incense. He smiles at me and then runs his teeth over his bottom lip while looking me up and down as if I’m a piece of meat. I can feel my face reddening under his gaze.
“They’re so beautiful.” Cas says. Dean reaches down and grabs his friends hand and squeezes it. Watching Cas look at the stars is like looking at the world from space. It’s like hearing a baby take its first breath or seeing a bird take flight for the first time.
"When I went to look for him, I had this weird feeling. Then, I saw him through the window. He was sitting there with the damn knife in his hands and he had this look. I knew something was wrong. So, I called out. He looked up and saw me and it was like he went back to normal. He was upset, but that look was gone. Like it had never happened. I feel haunted by that look." Cas explains. There are tears in his eyes, but they don't fall.
“Andy?” Gabe gives Dean a knowing look and points to a small tent towards the back of the area. Dean knows that tent. He’s been in there more times than he wants to admit. That’s where you go when you have nothing left. That’s where you go when you’re willing to do anything to get money to eat or even have warm socks.
Dean nods in acknowledgment. He gets up and walks down the hall in a haze. He doesn’t know what to think. He doesn’t know what to do. Only thing resonates in his head.
The drive takes a little longer than usual, but he makes it to the diner with a few minutes to spare. He doesn’t know who he’s looking for so he takes a booth in the back and orders a slice of pie and a coffee. The waitress is cute and he makes sure to wink at her more than once.
“As much as I’d love round two, I need food and bed. It’s been quite the last few weeks.” Dean says, “I’m exhausted.”
Thank you so much for reading! Things are going to get a little bit bumpy in the next few chapters. Also, a few characters have been added and a new relationship.
“Well, I’m going to tell you after you put down that knife and agree to get me outta here,” Dean stares at Benny. There was no way out of Purgatory that Dean had heard of and there was no way he was going to let Benny get top side. He was a vampire for crying out loud. Did this vampire think he was stupid? No way he’s helping this asshole do anything.
“You’re so beautiful, Dean.” Cas says. If anyone else would have said that he would have laughed at them, but he knows that Cas means it. Dean places a hand on either side of Cas’s face and pulls away to look into his eyes. If he’s going to do this, he needs to do it now. In the moment.
“I love you too, Cas.” Dean says. He can’t help but look at Cas’ mouth. Cas smiles and leans in until their lips are touching. They turn towards eachvother so they're pressed up together. Cas’s hand finds the side of Dean’s face and wanders to the back of his head pushing their heads together more. The kiss deepens and Dean moves his hips against his friend. Cas lets out a moan and Dean wants to hear him do it again. He hooks and leg over Cas’s body and ends up sitting on top of him. Cas’s hands move to Dean’s waist and then move up his back pulling him down into another kiss.
I can see his stubble in the light from the flickering flames. His eyes are darker than I have ever seen them. His right hand is flat on the table and the other is holding his beer bottle to his lips. He’s relaxed and leaning back in his chair casually. His eyes burn into me as he takes a sip and licks his lips slowly as if he’s teasing me. I can’t look away. I know he knows that I’m looking and my pulse quickens.
“I’ve been looking for you. Where have you been? Are you okay?” Dean’s words come out in a rush as he looks his friend over. He sees a lot of dirt and dried blood, but nothing is broken so he’s happy.
Sam’s angry. Maybe angry isn’t the right word. Disappointed? That sounds better, but still not right. There’s something at the edge of his voice that makes Dean feel like he’s failed at protecting Sam from the evil in the world.
“Cas?” Dean’s voice falters and it makes him feel insignificant and small. He stands there staring. He blinks a few times just to make sure what’s he’s seeing his real. It sure feels real.
Cas looks at him for a moment and then starts walking again. They make it to the edge of the park and Cas holds a branch back and waits for Dean to pass. If he’s totally honest with himself he’s kind of terrified about what he’s going to see. He doesn’t like the thought of people suffering or being hungry.
“I was going to ask him to marry me today,” Cas admits and again the weight of the ring in his pocket is distracting. He pulls out the box and drops it down on the desk. The box pops open and his future is sitting there. It’s black and silver and shines, even in the fluorescent light.
“Seven new ones,” Cas says and Dean can’t help but smile. He cracks an eye open and Cas is leaning over him with a look of concentration on his face.
“I shut down,” Dean says truthfully. He’s worried that he’s going to backslide and things will get bad again and he won’t care about himself anymore. Depression isn’t always so white and black. It comes and goes. The pills help, but it doesn’t make it stop. He still gets pretty dark sometimes and it takes him a while to work through it.
“I...know…,” a deep breath, “I know that you don’t understand why I looked for you. I know you were trying to protect me, but I wish you would have just told me. We could have come up with a plan. Together.”
“What? Cas, no. I’ve been looking for you for a damn year!” Dean looks to Benny who walks up to Dean and stands shoulder to shoulder with him.
“Meg. She might come up for a few days,” The conversation is too casual. He knows that she’s hiding something. She turns back around and busies herself with a few dishes in the sink. They had sworn that they wouldn’t keep anything from each other. Lies had ruined his mother and father’s marriage. He didn’t want to end up like them.
Okay, maybe Charlie hadn’t told him anything. He looks at her and she looks guilty. Cas follows his gaze and he scoots his chair back from the table.
“I didn’t know you were...so...dominant,” He whispers and I let out a small laugh. His expression changes from unsure to excited and expectant. I place my hands on his belt buckle and start undoing it. My lips are close to his but not touching. When he tries to kiss me again I move just out of his reach. He groans in frustration at his failed attempts to kiss me.
After that Cas changed. Something was different about him. He was much more affectionate and touchy-feely. Not in a creepy way, and it wasn’t enough of a change that an outsider would have noticed, but Dean noticed. The first time Cas held his hand under the table at family dinner Dean wanted to jump up and run away, but something in Cas’s eyes kept him there. By the time dinner was over he didn’t even care anymore.
"Cool," Dean says. That means Dean can have the title. The two boys are sitting at the end of the dock. Castiel is staring off into the distance while Dean leans back onto his elbows with his feet dangling in the water. The sun is hanging in just the right spot and Dean feels relaxed and comfortable. He closes his eyes.
“No, I don’t think you steal. Just curious,” Dean stands and looks at some of the books on the bookshelves. He hasn’t read any of the titles, but some of them look interesting. He takes one off the shelf and turns it over in his hands. “I loan books out to the others. I guess it’s kind of like a library,” Cas says. Dean turns to look at him. He’s holding the tray of bagels and there are now a few muffins on top.
“Dean-o! What are you doing here?” A voice asks. He turns around and see’s Gabe handing out some soap and toothbrushes to some of the people sitting on the street. Gabe isn’t from C Street, but he hangs out there a lot. He brings food and toiletries to people. Gabe brings hope to those who have lost it.
“I bother you?” He asks quickly. His face is very serious. Dean takes a step back and puts his hands up in defense.
“Uh..Cas- He’s been...he’s been staying at my place,” Charlie’s eyes go wide, but she doesn’t say anything. She just kinda looks at him waiting for him to go on. “Something happened to him when he was walking back to the camp. I think there is more to the story, but he doesn’t really want to talk about it and I don’t want to push.”
“I love you, Dean.” Cas says into Dean’s ear and sucks the lobe into his mouth. Dean lets out a moan and can’t stop himself from thrusting into Cas’s hand. Cas takes his and Dean’s erections into his hand and starts stroking faster. Dean doesn’t know how long he can last, it probably won’t be long, but God he feels so good. It was never like this with anyone else. Ever.
The man doesn’t even turn towards Dean or put out a hand. Dean quickly realizes why the man’s voice is unsettling. He sounds like a snake or something. His words containing an ‘s’ sound drag out in almost a comical way. His voice is nasally and strange and it makes the hairs on the back of Dean’s neck stand up.
“When the time is right open this bottle and let my grace in. It’s going to hurt. It’s going to feel like the fires of Hell are alive inside your ribs. It won’t last forever. Find Dean and get him out.” The angel crouches down in front of Benny and looks into his eyes for a few moments before standing and taking a few steps back. Benny’s teeth receded back into his gums and he takes a few head clearing breaths before he tests his muscles to see if he can move again.
“Did you know him?” Dean asks. He doesn’t know how much he should or shouldn’t say, but the energy in the room feels okay.
“You coming?” Cas asks and Dean has to force himself towards the bed. Is this okay? Is this what Cas wants? To lay with Dean practically naked?
“Bring him back.” Sam says. His voice is too calm. It’s too even and it makes Dean worry. He’s clearly keeping something from him. Dean stares at Cas’ lifeless body and he regrets ignoring him. What if this had been the last time that he got to see him? What if this was it? He looks down at his hand. It doesn’t burn anymore but it’s warm to the touch. It reminds him of the time Cas healed him. His wounds had disappeared but his skin had been warm where the wounds had been. He closes his phone and turns the car around and heads back to the bunker.
He had something to help him this time, though. He had what Andy had sent. He didn’t expect the package to show up in just a few days. It took him a week to open it and then a few more days to look inside it. It sat on his table for days mocking him. He wanted to know what was inside, but it also scared him to know that it could be something awful.
"If that is what you want." Cas has that look in his eyes. That look of not understanding what is happening but dealing with it however it is that angels deal with things they don't understand. Part of Dean wants to tell him to stay but that part of him couldn't win. Not today.
“Sam! Something is wrong with Cas,“ He slaps Cas’ face lightly, again his fingers are burned by his skin, “He just passed out. He’s not waking up.”
“I used to work for him,” Dean says. Cas doesn’t move. It’s as if he’s waiting for more information, but Dean can’t give anymore. Charlie freezes where she's crouched over him and her hands drop. He can feel her eyes on him. They’re going to leave. They’re going to leave and he’s going to have to move on again. Maybe it’s for the best. Maybe he should go.
“You sure?” Dean asks. He doesn’t want to go near it, but he doesn’t have a choice if he wants to keep his job. He sure as hell doesn’t want to end up back here against his will.
They don’t go anywhere specific. He just drives and lets Sam work through his thoughts. He sees a turn off for the lake and takes it. They hadn’t been there since they were kids, but it had always been a place of joy.
I’m totally useless to do anything but give him more access to my neck. He pushes me back up to the counter and presses into me until I hop up on the counter and wrap my legs around his waist. His mouth sucks hard into the tender flesh below my ear and I tip my head back and let out another moan. His kisses travel down my neck and to my now exposed collarbone as I make sense of what he had just said.
Cas kneels between my legs and runs his hands up my thighs touching and kissing me everywhere except where I want him to. I know that he won’t.
This is the first chapter of Dean's past. Things are going to get very dark. Please read the warnings before each chapter.
He parks his car in the alley a block away from where the man sits and walks over to him. He’s reading again, but he doesn’t look up. Dean grips the bag a little tighter. Maybe this was a mistake. What if this guy was a serial killer or something? Even with his heart beating a million miles a second and his sweating palms, he walks up to the guy and clears his throat. The man looks up and Dean’s looking into the most amazing blue eyes he has ever seen. They shine in a way that he has never seen before. They almost look un-human.
“I don’t know. Our last face to face was pretty awkward.” Apparently everyone in this damn town is good at making Dean talk when he doesn’t want to.
“It’s so easy, Dean. It’s so easy to get you people to do what I want. Your other little friend didn’t have any problems until you got involved. You nearly got him killed, or do you not remember?” Dean stops moving then. The comment is sobering. He’s right. He had nearly gotten someone killed. He takes a few steps back and grabs Charlie and pulls her away roughly. He knows he’s being too rough, but he can’t lose another friend to this asshole. “Tell Castiel, I’ll see him soon.”
He forgets that Halloween is getting close. A woman dressed as sexy corn keeps giving him sex eyes. Charlie shows up a little before eight dressed in a cape and flower crown. Dean tries not to laugh he really does, but he can’t stop himself. He stops when she looks at him like she might stab him in the face and leave him for dead.
“I told you, I want to get outta here,” Benny throws the head down a nearby hill and wipes his blade on the leg of his pants.
“I want you to fuck me,” He says carefully and I can’t believe that this is happening. I have dreamed about this a hundred times and he’s telling me the words I want to hear.
“You have done plenty to protect the ones you love. You’ve given so much that you can’t even see what you mean to those around you. You’re-you’re special, Dean. You’re- amazing and if it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t be here. I wouldn’t be here and
“Shut up, Dean!” Sam rushes into the room and tugs his father off of his brother and the man falls to the floor with a loud thud. “He fucking hit you!”
“Are you leaving?” Dean asks. There is a panic in his voice that even shocks him. Cas can’t go not now. Not just because he wants him to stay, but because it’s not safe. Cas doesn’t have anywhere to go. Alistair will find him.
I wonder if he knows the effect he has on me? Does he know he’s all I think about, even when I’m with my girlfriend? He might be ruining my life and I don’t care. I can’t think about anything except him and his stupid blue eyes and sex hair. Not to mention his mouth. His glorious, sent from heaven, mouth.
“Okay. What did you do?” He doesn’t want to think about what she might have done. The first thing that comes to mind is that she filed for divorce. He wouldn’t blame her if that’s what’s going on. He’s thought about it a few times himself just to save her from the heartache of everything.
He opens his eyes and Cas is standing there with a mug of coffee in his hand. He sets it down on Dean’s side table and then sits down next to him. He places a hand on Dean’s face and leans in close and places a kiss on his forehead.
Cas nods and starts walking again leaving Dean thinking about just telling Cas everything. He catches up and they walk across the park toward the lot where Dean is parked in silence.
“Gabe,” Dean whispers as Gabe walks back towards the front of the house. He can hear voices. One of which he knows well. Crowley. They really were coming for him. Dean opens the back door as quietly as he can and slips out. He hopes that Gabe will be okay, but right now he has to get away from there. He can’t be found if Alistair has sent Crowley after him. He ducks down around the side of the house and then feels a hand come around his mouth and another wrapping around his body.
I feel hands on my body, but I don’t open my eyes. This is the best part. The touching. The feeling without seeing. He pulls my hand and guides me through the small space until I’m standing freely in the living room of his apartment. I feel his torso on my back and I lean my head back onto his shoulder. His fingers are moving in circles up and down my sides. I let out a moan when he starts kissing my neck. It feels so good.
“So, tell me about this place,” Dean says and turns in a slow circle taking in the views of tents and people all lining up where Benny is setting up his station.
“Fuck,” he moans and that’s all the fuel I need. Taking control is something that I have wanted to do for so long. He doesn’t even know what he’s gotten himself into and I feel giddy with anticipation of seeing his face and hearing the sounds he makes while I take him apart and put him back together again.
He stops at a motel in a small town with a ridiculously low population. The town consists of a few buildings and lots of farmland. There’s a grocery store, a motel, and and liquor store. He checks in around two in the morning, but not before stopping at the liquor store for a large bottle of cheap whiskey. He feels guilty for buying it but he doesn’t care enough to stop himself.
Before you read this last chapter, I want to say thank you to every single one of you who has taken the time to read this story. It's the first one I have ever finished and I feel really good about it.
A moment passes before he realizes he’s staring at the man, “Sorry, I, uh, a few weeks ago you dropped your sandwich. I mean, it was my fault,” He’s rambling. “But anyway, I got these for you.”
“Dean I know this is shocking. I know that I should have told you, I just didn’t think anything like this was going to happen.”
He looks like heaven. His hair messed up like he’s been fucking all day. He’s barefoot wearing a pair of tan cotton drawstring pants and a sky blue lightweight cotton button up. The sleeves rolled up to his elbows and a large part of his neck and collarbone are visible. I stare at the exposed skin. I can’t wait to taste it.
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have come unannounced,” Castiel stops and looks at his brother, his mouth opening and closing as if he’s going to say something. He doesn’t. His eyes fill with tears. What could he say even if he wanted to? The truth? It’s been ten years. What could he say right now that would make this less awkward?
“I need to take a break. I’m going to get some wood.” Dean throws his blade on the ground in front of himself and stalks off in the other direction. His absence leaves Cas and Benny alone.
“No,” Dean gets up and heads to his bedroom. He doesn’t want to think about Sam knowing about the things he did for food and money. He doesn’t want Sam to see him differently and he doesn’t want to realize that Sam probably already knew. It wasn’t hard to figure out and Sam was so smart. He could probably tell the second Dean came in smelling like sex and cigarettes and sometimes pot. He could probably tell when Dean walked a little funny after a particularly rough night. Sam probably knew it all, but Dean wasn’t going to admit to anything.
“But no one else did. I mean there was Gabe, but he could only do so much. He never pushes past the point of making you think about your life.”
He can hear Sam’s voice, it’s comforting, in the same way, putting on your favorite sweatshirt would be. But this is okay. Passing out is better than having to hear them talk about him like he isn’t sitting in the same room.
“I’m sorry, did you miss that part where I said I can’t sleep?” Sam pushes himself upright in the seat and pushes his hair off of his face,” I know what you’re thinking about.” Dean glances at his brother for a moment before looking back to the road. Dean knows he knows but he’s not going to deny or confirm anything so he keeps his mouth shut.
As he approaches Castiel again he sees he’s putting things into the backpack Dean had left. Dean shoves his hands into his pockets and leans up against the dumpster next to him.
They get dressed enough to eat and then head to bed. They don’t talk, they just lay in eachothers arms and let sleep take them over.
Cas turns and walks down the hall. He slams the bathroom door and Dean can hear cabinets opening and closing. The door opens and Cas has his hands full of his things. He grabs his backpack and shoves the items inside. He starts to put on his shoes before Dean has time to process what’s happening.
“I want to see you,” I say. He walks over and straddles my lap and kisses my shoulder. I close my eyes and let the feeling of his mouth and body wash over me.
Cas moves towards Dean with an outstretched hand and gets up on his knees and gently touches a hand to Dean's thigh. he tenses as Cas' other hand makes it's way to Dean's face. He feels peace immediately. His skin tingles and burns where Cas’ hand rests and he’s no longer able to hold in the tears that he was trying so hard to make go away. He closes his eyes and focuses on the feelings Cas is sending through him. It feels warm and peaceful and just as quickly as the feelings come they are gone.
Cas takes a few careful steps to the couch and sits down on the other side of Dean. He stares as if he’s trying to convey some kind of secret message. Dean feels like the whole world is moving in slow motion as Cas’s arms come up and wrap around him again. This feels different. This feels like something he hasn’t felt in a long time.
I will have an update next Sunday (possibly before) but there won't be one the following Sunday because I'll be at Disneyland! So, I'll post when I get home!
“Sit down, we can talk about it,” His brother motions to the chair across from the desk. Castiel sits but he doesn’t know where to start. How do you explain that the man you love is killing you and you wouldn’t have it any other way? How do you explain that you are in constant agony and feed on it like it’s your only lifeline?
Dean is sick of the hospital. He’s sick of being treated like a baby and he’s sick of being put to sleep. He’s sick of the medication. It makes his brain fuzzy. He wants to get up and walk out but he can’t. He doesn’t even know why he’s here. He hasn’t seen his brother and no one has mentioned his dad.
you want,”  The way he emphasizes the word anything sends a new wave of want through me, but I’m not going to make the first move. He takes another step towards me and I can hear my heartbeat in my ears. I lick my lips in anticipation of a reply, but something changes. His gaze is on my mouth and it looks like he’s struggling.
“I’m sure. He’s a new kid. Just got here a few weeks ago. He’s nice.” Gabe says sadly. Dean knows what that means. Dean was nice once too. They like it when you’re nice.
“Sam, what is it that you think your brother and I have?” Cas asks. Dean can’t help but hold his breath. He’s not sure if he wants to know what Sam thinks. What if it’s not what Dean thinks? What if it’s something he’s not quite ready to face?
“Dean, I think we should back off,” Benny stands just behind Dean placing a hand on his elbow to pull him back. Cas walks past the two men and stands at the edge of the water, eyes seemingly focused on nothing.
They settle on a small diner a few blocks from Sams new place. It looks like something straight out of the fifties. Red vinyl seats and chrome fixtures. There is even a little jukebox at each table.
“Who are you?” Benny asks quietly pulling himself into a more comfortable position. The man looks to the glowing ball and then back to Benny. The man’s gaze is intense and makes the hairs on the back his his back stand on end. He can see that he’s not being threatened but his body is reacting like he is.
It was Dean who had to get Sam to go back home and face his wife because love was love and they could adopt. It was Dean who told him that it didn’t matter and that he still had his beautiful wife and a wonderful life to live. It was Dean who helped him out of the depression and sadness at not being about to be a father.
"Dean, I'd like to talk to you…" Cas' voice is still so different. He doesn’t sound like himself. It was like listening to an echo of what Cas once was, "about what happened in Purgatory."
“I swear to God himself, Dean Winchester. You better tell me what’s going on right now.” Dean knows he probably looks pathetic, but he can’t stop the tears that spring to his eyes as he wraps his arms around the older man. He tells him about his bad week. He tells him about missing home and Cas, he talks about Sammy and his dad, he tells him about how much he hates school and doesn’t want to be there. The older man listens and lets Dean get it all out. He feels better after it's over, but there’s something in his uncle’s eyes that say,
“Dean,” It wasn’t a question. It was more like a warning. The way Cas said his name sent a shiver down Dean’s spine. Cas’ eyes leave Dean’s face and land on Benny. Dean recoils his hand on his friends shoulder when he sees the look on Cas’ face. Anger. He stands and backs up to where Benny is standing. Cas slowly sits up and stands as well.
“Please,” I pant. I know I sound pathetic, but I want to be taken apart and put back together again. He stands behind me and taps my shoulder. I stand and face him and he gives me a quick kiss on the side of my head.
“I think that’s a great idea.” Dean says and takes a glance at Cas, “Alistair is a dick and usually gets what he wants.”
He walks by Marv, but this time, the man is less friendly and just leads him to Alistair's office and leaves. Dean sits in the chair and waits for the man to arrive. He looks around the space. It’s pretty bare. There isn’t much on the walls and there is only one row of what looks to be large notebooks on the bookshelves behind the desk. Next to that is a window that overlooks the woods behind the building. Dean doesn’t even hear when Alistair comes in.
Neither boy says anything else so Dean makes his way to the bathroom and closes the door loud enough to let them know he’s awake.
“Save me?” Dean laughs, “ You let me slaughter one of the only friends I’ve ever had. You let me think you were dead! I didn’t need to feel guilt about that. I thought I let you down. I mourned your death, you son of a bitch!”
“No problem. I’ve had a few panic attacks myself. Military,” Benny says. Dean doesn’t need an explanation. He gets it. Cas is at his other side and looks like he’s seen a dead body or something. Benny picks up his pack and takes off in the other direction after Dean’s assured him that he’s alright.
He tells Sam but Sam doesn’t say anything. He just looks at Dean for a moment and then goes back to making his lunch. Dean feels guilty as his brother slides the brown bag into his backpack. He should have made his lunch for him.
“What’s going on?” He asks. He doesn’t want to know. He can hear his dad gulping down a beer. He slams the can on the counter and lets out a deafening belch. Dean rolls his eyes waiting for the inevitable.
Dean’s second delivery is to a grocery store. He drops off the boxes at exactly 9 AM and leaves. He takes the long way home. It should only take him about three weeks of work to send Sam off with a good chunk of money and then a few more weeks to get himself a place away from their dad.
Could it be true? Is there a way for him to get back to a real life? Is there a way for him to find his creator and make him pay for ruining his life? He had been a just a guy with a life before he had been turned. Was it really possible to get out of Purgatory? Did he want to get out? Life in Purgatory isn’t a walk in the park, but it’s uncomplicated and he knows what to expect. Kill or be killed. What if he can’t contain his thirst for blood? He swore he’d never take an innocent life again.
He bites his lip and starts stroking himself again and I can’t keep my eyes off of his hands as they move across his body. I know he’s teasing me but I don’t care. It’s what I want.
The drive to the nearest store that has all the items they need will take thirty minutes. Dean rolls down the windows and turns on the radio to drown out the silence. It’s painful to be this close to Cas and not talk to him. He wants to find out what’s going on. He wants to ask Cas about Purgatory. They were totally alone and nothing could stop him from getting the information that he wanted. He also wanted to ask why he wasn’t healing like he should be. Now would be the time to ask these questions but instead he turns up the radio a little more and hums along to the music.
Dean glares at Sam, shoving a stack of papers to the side. He sits opposite his brother at the table,
Cas? Dean feels something clawing in the pit of his stomach. Something he can't afford to let grow in a place like this. Why had he been looking for Cas all this time? Sure, Cas was his friend, but why was he willing to nearly kill himself to find him? Why did he pray to him every night hoping he would just show up and tell him he was okay? He could admit that he loved Cas. He could admit that. He was friend, hell, he was his family.
“You’re gonna have to be quiet,” I say and move away from him just enough to look him in the eye. He looks like he doesn't know what to do. He looks unsure. “Are you okay? Is this okay?”
“Don’t fucking call me that.” Sam turns and leaves right out the front door. The slam of the door shakes the whole house. Dean looks down to their father who has passed out in the middle of the floor. Dean’s nose is still dripping blood down the front of his shirt and onto the floor.
It was one thing if only Hell was after you, but for Cas it was Heaven and Hell, and Dean isn’t sure if he will be able to stop it or protect Cas the way that he wants to. He needs his friend there when shit hits the fan and he needs him around so that can can at least try to keep him safe.
I lie about where I’m going for the second time this month and I leave her angry and confused. I know she knows that something else is going on and the truth is, I haven’t wanted to be with her for a long time. I don’t have the balls to break it off.
“What do you do for fun?” She asks. It’s a simple question, but it really makes him think. There isn’t anything that he does in his spare time that means anything. He usually just goes home after work and watches tv. I mean there is the whole thing with Cas, but he wouldn’t say semi stalking a homeless man was a hobby he could brag about.
Just as Dean is going to dismiss himself from the conversation his hears a noise coming from behind him. He knows he can’t move. What if this had been a trap the whole time? He had a vampire not five feet from him and he knew if he turned Benny wouldn’t hesitate to kill him despite the deal he had just tried to make.
Sleep comes a littler easier now that he’s not in the hospital. He’s only able to sleep a few hours at a time because of all the dreams. He’s not exactly sure what they mean, but he’s sure it has something to do what happened with his dad. Andy and Gabe have both tried to explain it to him, but he thinks he maybe doesn’t want to hear about it. At least, his body doesn’t. It rejects the idea that his own father could do something so hurtful and hateful.
The three men walk for days looking for the portal. Dean never strays too far from Cas and Benny is never too far from Dean. None of them talked other than when there was a threat to the trio and no one brought up the fact that Dean had confessed his love to Cas. He tried to bury it deep down with the memories of his mom and his past life with Lisa and Ben.
Before Sam fell asleep he had explained to Dean a large portion of what the tablet said. There was a way to close Hell. There would be no more demons top side. It’s a relief but it’s also terrifying. There are a few trials that must be done in order to close the gates forever. Driving 600 miles is giving Dean lots of time to think about the trials and how he’s going to complete them without anyone knowing. Kevin has already translated the first trial and Dean’s already thinking of ways to accomplish it.
Dean jumps back from Cas and bites his lip to keep himself from crying out. His eyes fill with tears and he shakes his head in confusion, “I’ve been looking for you.”
Hunting is a job that guarantees death. It guarantees pain and suffering and it also guarantees losing people. It meant losing a battle that shouldn’t have ever been started. Sure, there had been some good times. There were small victories, but they were quickly pushed to the side when something bigger came along. They never had a day off. There was no time for celebration of birthdays or holidays. There was no time for mourning loved ones who were ripped from the world too soon.
“Cas?” Dean says. Cas’ eyes flick to Dean and then to Benny and he takes another step back. His face stays the same. He doesn’t look scared, or happy, or sad. He just looks blank.
Saturday started out just as bad. He spilled coffee all over himself because someone had left their shoes in the middle of the kitchen floor. There was no hot water left for his shower, and he had forgotten to check the windows on his truck before he went to bed. He was now walking into work with a soaked left ass cheek and thigh.
Dean doesn’t sleep much. He’s tormented by dreams of Purgatory and Cas’ broken and unfamiliar face. He is awake, showered, and ready to make himself breakfast by 5AM.  After eating, he heads to the library to see if Sam had left any research out that he can look at and and try to piece together. There isn’t much there but he pours himself into the paperwork for hours waiting for Sam to come help him. It’s almost ten before he finally hears some movement from the dorms.
"That Cas kid fell in the water and I jumped in to save him. Wasn't fast enough though," Dean says as he takes off his wet clothes and changes into dry ones. He places his shoes in front of the window in the sun.
He stands behind me and pushes me down onto my knees. His hands are in my hair roughly pulling my head back exposing my neck. I let out a contented sigh and close my eyes. I can feel him smiling as he kisses down the side of my neck. He kneels behind me and presses his erection into my back. He lets go of my hair and runs his hands up and down my body. My breathing shallows and his fingers brush my right nipple. My hips thrust forward and I bite my lip to keep my moan to myself.
Dean walks in the side door and starts stripping off his clothes. Cas looks anywhere but his boyfriend.
“I know and I know I haven’t been what you needed recently. The whole thing with Ruby is just...I mean, it fucked me up. Gabe says I’m going through the steps of grief with flying colors. I’m currently at acceptance with a touch of anger. I’m also pretty sure I skipped a few steps.”
He takes a few steps down the stairs and Cas looks up at him again. He looks okay. He doesn’t look like he’s missed any meals or forgotten to shower or take his pills. He looks like he might be taking care of himself and he doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry.
“You’re not alone, Dean and you are needed. He will come around. Just give him time. Divorces aren’t easy and neither is death.”
“Wha-oh. Yeah. I’m fine, Cas.” Dean sets the book down on the bed. He watches as Cas walks over to a hanging bag. He unzips it and pulls out a dark zipper hoodie and puts it on. He’s putting his arms through the sleeves when Dean stands and decides it’s time for him to go and starts towards the exit of the tent. The hoodie is bringing back memories of his past and this isn’t exactly the place he wants them to come up.
The grip on his face and body loosen and he turns around to come face to face with Andy. He’s bruised and bloodied.
“Dad!” He cries as water fills his mouth. He hopes that his voice is loud enough for someone to hear him and keeps pulling the kid towards the dock, kicking as hard as he can. They are moving so slowly he starts to realize he can’t hold the boy up. They are only a few feet from the dock when they both start to go under the water. In one last attempt not to let the kid drown, he shoves him as hard as he can towards the dock, but the force pushes himself under the water.
He finally looks at Dean and blinks a few times. His expression softens. Dean takes a few steps forward and before he can stop himself wraps the angel in his arms holding him tightly against his chest. Cas doesn’t hug him back but he’s okay with that. He has dreamed of this moment for so long he can’t believe that’s it’s happening. He pulls away and notices the look of confusion on Cas’ face who has his gaze locked on Benny again.
Sadness fills Sam’s eyes. Dean can see the tears forming as he turns to walk away. He takes a few steps and then stops. Dean stands staring at the back of Sam’s head hope and wishing he doesn’t say what he think’s he’s going to say. He's going to tell him how different he is and how useless he is. He wishes with everything inside of himself. The tears are too big to keep away now and they fall freely down his face.
“A little uncontrolled today?” He asks. The sound of his voice enters my ears and goes straight to my dick. He lets go of my hair and pushes my jacket from my shoulders and lets it fall to the ground. He’s careful not to touch me too much and it makes me want to wrap myself around him and never let go. He walks around me like a hunter about to devour his prey. I know better than to move. If I move I won’t get what I want.
This particular day something feels off. There is nothing right about Purgatory, but when something is wrong or different everything in Purgatory can feel it. It’s like the air feels cooler and electric and has a sweetness to it. Benny checks his pockets for the few things he does own in Purgatory and heads out to search for the disruption.
Benny has been in Purgatory longer than he wants to remember. Time isn’t the same here as it is topside. He had tried to stop keeping track of time after the first few years but somehow he still knew that he had been in Purgatory for fifty. Fifty long, awful, haunting years.
Dean drives for nearly two days. He knows he hasn’t made a smart choice but being out here in the open is better than being in the bunker watching Cas give up his life for some half assed vengeance mission he and his brother started 8 years ago.
“Cas?” Dean’s standing at the top of the stairs looking down at Cas. He’s smiling, but it doesn’t reach his eyes.
“He wouldn’t tell them where you had gone and they shot him. He’s...he’s okay. For the most part. He doesn’t remember a whole lot from the last few years, but he’s getting better. I already sent him what I needed to send him.”
“Good. That’s really good,” She says. He takes a quick peek at her face and she looks genuinely happy for him, but there is a hint of sadness in her voice that makes Dean wonder what the story behind the sadness is.
Benny slowly reaches out a hand towards the angel. He hasn’t moved in a good five minutes and was just staring at the water in front of him.
Monday comes and Sam still won’t talk to Dean. He’s tried everything including making Sam his favorite meal. His father won't look at him because the bruises under each eye is a reminder that he drinks too much. His father leaves for a business trip as soon as the boys leave for school.
“Gabe,” Dean says, again. He can’t change the tone yet. He wishes that his stupid hands would stop feeling so weak so he could give the guy a high five or something.
“Where are you going?” Sam asks closing his laptop lid half way and leaning back in his chair. He’s clearly annoyed at Dean’s lack of faith in Cas being able to fend for himself.
It’s around noon and near the end of his route when Dean takes a break and parks the truck for lunch. His lunch isn’t much, but he enjoys his turkey sandwich and chips. He doesn’t usually eat in the truck, but he’s running a little late due to the horrific traffic. Summer is nearly over and everyone is coming back to town to get ready for winter and the school year. When he’s finished with his sandwich and chips he opens his water and takes a few sips to wash it all down. He’s screwing the cap back on when his phone rings.
“I just...I guess, I just…” He looks over at Cas who has agreed to sit in for this appointment. He nods at Dean in understanding and encouragement, “I feel like living. Even the little stuff is starting to get exciting to me. Planning things and then doing them. It feels...really good.”
I don’t break eye contact as my hand slides down the front of his boxes, “There’s a lot you don’t know about me, Mr. Winchester.”
“When did you figure it out?” Dean asks. Castiel doesn’t say anything. Cas sits down in the chair and looks up at Dean.
Dean takes a few steps away from Cas and frowns before his face changes to something else entirely. His father had warned him about situations like this. The hunt can make you feel things that aren’t real. He couldn’t afford to love anyone or anything except Sam,  “You’re right. It’s this place,” he says quietly and backs away a little more.
“Your boss? Is he big? I could use a good fucking,” Andy says and Dean can’t stop himself from looking over at the guy to see if he’s serious. Dean looks back to the road and continues to drive to Roman Enterprises where Crowley and Alistair wait for him.
By the time Dean has made it to the end of the dock, he doesn't care that he's still wearing his shorts, socks, and new shoes. He takes a deep breath and launches himself into the water. As he gets closer to the person, he sees it’s not his brother. It’s the quiet boy from next door.
Dean stands quickly and rushes out the door. He’s not sure, but Marv has a smug look on his face when he passes by. He goes home and makes the decision that he isn’t going to take the watch off unless he’s showering. He can’t have a repeat of today.
“Dean, you’ve endured so much. Not just from the church, but dad, probably even the world. And you’re still here. You’re doing it and you’re putting the work in. And me and Cas? We see you, Dean. You’re still here and I think that’s longer than anyone could have.”
“Sammy, I’m sorry,” Dean says. Tears blurred his vision before he could even finish his apology. He can’t stop the sob that claws its way out of his throat. He cries and cries and doesn’t stop until he hears Sam sniffling on the line. He quiets himself and wipes his eyes on the backs of his hands and gathers himself the best he can. He takes in a shaky breath and listens to his brother cry on the line.
"Cas, is there something you want to add?" Ava asks. Cas stares at her for a moment before turning to Dean.
“Cas?” Dean asks confused. Cas doesn’t say anything. He just strips off his clothes, leaving only his boxers on, and climbs into Dean’s bed.
Dean bends down and picks up the items he dropped at his feet. He stands and places the things inside his open duffle. He doesn’t know what to say. There’s so much to talk about and he can’t think of a single damn thing to say. How do you tell your best friend that things are different? How do you tell them that you don't want to just be friends or that you feel something you know you shouldn't?
“Benny,” Dean eyes Benny from where he sits, his back up against a tree, “Do you think we’re going to find him?”
Dean takes a few steps back. He can feel the tension. He knows that something is wrong. Something doesn’t feel right. He was sure that his father had been drinking. He was so sure, but his eyes are clear and his body language says otherwise. Something feels wrong. His dad pushes past him bumping him on the way out and walks up the stairs. Dean can hear him moving things around upstairs. He hears slamming and cursing and then his father is downstairs again holding a large stack of pictures.
He takes Dean by the hips and leads him towards the spare room. Dean pauses for a moment outside the door but then enters letting his jeans fall to the floor. His black boxers close behind. Cas takes a moment to drink Dean in. His body, even the scars, are beautiful. Everything about him is beautiful. Dean turns and goes to the bathroom and turns on the shower. He leans in the doorway and lets Cas stare.
“Do you have it?” I ask. I know he does. I don’t need to ask. He places a hand on my waist and pushes me until my back hits the ledge of the counter. I hear a sound and I’m sure he placed the container on the counter behind me. His hands find their way to my back. His fingers play with the hem of my shirt as his lips kiss up my collarbone and neck. I let out a breath that I didn’t realize I was holding.
“Cas, can we talk?” Dean finally asks. Cas nods and they walk a few yards away leaving Benny to stare after them near the small fire he had built to keep Dean warm. Dean stops walking and Cas stands with his back to him. He doesn’t like the way this feels. It feels wrong.
“We don’t get days off, darling.” Dean rolls his eyes and stands up in all his naked glory. Crowley doesn’t even hide that he’s looking Dean over, “Maybe put some pants on.” Crowley stands and exits the room leaving Dean to get dressed.
When he’s with Ava they talk about things that Dean has never been able to talk about openly before. His dad, the conversion therapy, the early days with Cas and how awful Dean had been to him, and how scared he’s been to openly love Cas in public. He feels a little lighter after each appointment. They discuss upping his antidepressant dosage and he agrees. He keeps his routine without complaint, but the last appointment is looming over his head. Cas and Sam will both be attending and Dean feels weird about it. He doesn’t know what’s going to be said and he doesn’t know how to prepare mentally.
“I don't know, Sammy,” Dean says and scrubs a hand across his face. The truth is, there is no way in Hell he’s going back home for Thanksgiving. He knows full well his father did not ask if he was coming home.
“I...uh. I don’t think I do. I try too, of course,” he says. He takes a deep breath and then lets it out forcefully. “I think that’s what’s holding me back from actually getting better. What happened to me, it left a mark. And no matter what I do, I can’t get rid of it. I think when it first started happening, I was just confused and then confusion turned to fear, fear turned to anger. What they did to me...when I think about it, I just… I shut down.”
“Oh Sammy, you’ve come to the right place! What do you want to know?” Dean knows he sounds like smug sonofabitch. He smiles and relaxes in his chair. He leans back and throws his feet up on the dashboard.
“You ready to go?” Cas asks and zips up the sweatshirt. It’s like the piece of clothing is mocking him. “I’ll walk you to your car. I’m gonna pick up an application at the bakery.” Cas smiles.
He walks up the driveway and pulls out his keys and slides them in the lock. The door unlocks and he opens it. He knows he shouldn’t be nervous about this, but he is. He doesn’t know what Dean’s going to look like. He doesn’t know how he’s going to react to seeing Cas for the first time in two weeks. It has taken him 6 days just to text him and they had talked briefly once but it was awkward and strained.
“Hello,” Dean calls, he turns to look around the other dumpsters in the area, but he can’t find the guy anywhere. He looks again near the usual spot and sees the guy’s bag stuffed under the stairs that lead up the side of the building. He knows better than to touch the bag, but he can’t help the feeling of panic rising up in his chest. What if the guy got sick out here? Got hurt? Or worse?
The two men exit the bookstore and walk towards the center of town. They don’t really talk a whole lot and when they do it’s not about anything important. Cas talks about the weather and bees while he picks up litter on the sidewalk. He also talks about the mating cycles of deer and rabbits and other various animals. Dean talks about cars and work. Neither of them talks about family or anything too personal. It’s not as awkward as Dean thinks it should be.
Is he really getting hired without an interview? He doesn't even know what the whole job entails. Who just hires someone without an interview? Maybe Chuck had talked to the guy beforehand and made sure he got the job. He was aware of the fact that Sam was going to school. Maybe he would have a trial period and then give him a formal interview later.
“Bedroom,” I say and he slowly untangles himself from me and pulls me into his room. I can feel my heartbeat in my ears and it reminds me how alive I am. I’m so alive and I’m here. I’m here and I’m about to have the best sex of my life because sex with Cas is always mind-blowingly good. He sits on the edge of the large bed and starts to unbuckle my pants and I slip off my shoes and kick them under the bed.
“Look, Benny,” Dean turns to Benny, “It’s alight. It’s over. We found him. Lets get outta here. I’m sure Cas has a good reason for what happened.”
“What are we going to do about Alistair?” Cas asks. Charlie has long gone home and Dean and Cas are on the couch. They are sitting so close that Dean can smell Cas’s toothpaste and face wash.
The whiskey burns as it goes down. He’s only been drunk twice and both times were with Castiel. First time, they were 12 and stole Cas’s moms wine coolers. They both threw up and had awful headaches the next day. Lucky for them, it was on a weekend and they didn’t have school.
“No,” he finally says. The answer seems forced and strange. It doesn’t sound like he means it at all. It makes him feel like Cas can see right through him and that he can see what Dean’s up to, but wants him to make the right choice for himself.
The reason I stopped this story so suddenly is that someone kept messaging me about how horrible it was. I’m not going to get into details, but it was pretty awful. I feel awful, even now.
“Yes,” Cas moans and closes his eyes. I slowly press a finger into him and his hips rise up off the bed and I push them back down with my free hand. Holding him down, I move my index finger in and out slowly to open him up.
“That explains the peach fuzz, Cas,” Dean says and reaches out a hand to touch Cas’ face before he can stop himself. It’s too late. He’s already done it. He just touched Cas’s face. He thinks he can see Cas blush, but he ignores it.
“Please don’t fire me!” Dean blurts. He needs this job. He can’t go back to what he was doing before. He needs it bad and he can’t pass up this kind of money. He feels safer here than out there. He’ll do better.
“Good?” I ask. I know he likes it cause he can’t stop moving and gasping for breath. After a few moments, I slide in another finger.
He bought his dad’s car from him and fixed it up. It was beautiful. He revamped the whole inside and painted the outside. All chrome and black. She was the most important thing Dean owned and kept her pristine. He couldn’t help but notice the way that people stared when would drive up. Some were scared, cause they knew who he was, but others looked like they wanted to be sprawled in the backseat naked. He couldn’t deny that he liked the attention.
Sam’s right. He failed him, again, he let him down and broken another promise. He failed Cas too. He needed to tell someone what happened in Purgatory so that he could move on. He needed to tell someone about what happened to him and how he and Cas had changed. He wants to talk about it but the thought makes his stomach tie up in knots. He doesn’t know what to say so he just stands there staring, willing his tears not to fall, but they leave a warm wet betrayal on his face.
“I’ll get my things.” He says and closes the door to the car. Dean doesn’t know what else to do, so he drives off leaving Cas in the rearview mirror. He just needs to drive like he used to. Driving always cleared his mind when there was too much going on.
“Fuck!” he mutters, realizing that he had left it on the kitchen table. If his dad sees it he will never see the damn thing again. So, he makes a decision. He speeds all the way home to grab the watch. He puts it in his pocket and rushes to the bakery. He carries the three boxes to the door in one trip and sets them down on the counter. He’s ten minutes late the guy behind the counter looks pissed.
“You stayed on purpose? You let me...you...” Dean stands forgetting that he’s weak from the angels power over his memories. Cas stands and reaches out a hand to steady Dean, but he flinches away from it, “Don’t touch me.”
Dean watches as the man slowly and carefully walks over and bends down in front of Crowley to pick up the discarded pastry. It all happens so fast, but Garth is on the floor holding his face. There is blood dripping from behind his hands and he’s groaning in pain. Crowley steps over the man and walks out the door leaving Dean to stare at the man on the floor. His nose is broken for sure. He looks up at Dean. It’s almost like he’s pleading for Dean to help him, but he can’t move.
“I have nowhere to go, Dean,” there’s a shift in the room and it makes Dean tense up, ”I tried to go home.” Hearing those words out of Cas’ mouth feels like a slap to the face. Dean had been thinking of Cas as home for a long time and it crushes him that Cas doesn’t feel the same way. When Cas isn’t around he feels like a lost child crying for it’s mother or a lost puppy following strangers home. He feels like he’s in a one man cult chasing a belief that everyone else thinks is crazy.
"I know you are, but you are also growing and changing and I see it and I think that maybe I can be a little more supportive in letting you know when I notice things. You are wonderful."
The drive home takes too long and it leaves Dean in a sour mood. He feels like an asshole and it makes him think about the months before he had left home. He himself had been more or less homeless. He had been practically living in the Impala for a few weeks before a friend stepped in and helped him get back on his feet.
“I know, but...I promise it will all make sense. I just need an address. Any address. I don’t care where it goes, I just need it to get to you. Okay?”
“It’s for my brother. He’s into this kinda stuff,” He replies and closes the book. Dean looks down at his watch. Is he late? He didn’t really pay much attention to time once he entered the store.
“Really? That’s amazing. You must be very proud. My oldest brother went to Stanford. He’s a civil rights lawyer, which is funny because-” Cas stops and looks up at Dean. He just stares at him.
Dean makes it to the school in record time. He’s not sure why, but he feels like something is wrong. Just to be sure he has the time he looks down at his watch. It’s not there.
," He thinks, standing to walk back to his room. He was almost to his door when he hears Cas call out to him.
“We’re just sitting here with our thumbs up our asses thinking that we’re being polite by leaving him alone,” Dean snaps. He knows he’s said too much and he hopes that Sam doesn’t ask any questions. Questions lead to confessions about Purgatory and how when he finally had found Cas it ripped his heart open leaving a Cas sized hole in his chest.
Dean is 11 years old when he sees Castiel for the first time. He is walking along the edge of the lake, trying not to get his new shoes wet like his dad had asked when he sees something out of the corner of his eye. There's movement in the water. A duck, probably. He’s going to keep walking, but he hears a small cry and realizes it’s human and not a bird. He had promised to teach Sam how to swim this summer and had been putting it off. Dread fills his chest as he takes off down the beach.
Cas nods. The two get dressed and make their way to Benny's shop. The sheriff's car is outside and Dean feels like he's going to be sick. Something must have happened. They park and head inside. Benny can be seen talking with the sheriff and what looks to be an FBI agent in his office and Charlie is sitting in one of the stylist chairs pulling at a thread on her jeans.
It’s a little past midday when they make it to the edge of the woods. There is a large opening that leads to the edge of the water. Dean scans the area quickly before continuing down the path to the water. He kneels down and scoops up the water by the handfuls and drinks until he feels full.
“Mr. Winchester?” The man says and reaches out a hand, setting his book down. This isn’t the man that he’s been talking to. This man's voice is cheerful and bright. Too bright.
“I’ve been working on something and I need you to read it. I need you to understand and I want you to know that I’m sorry, Dean. I didn’t know the full extent of what Alistair’s plan was. I didn’t know he was going to go after you until it was too late and by then I had to play along.”
Castiel takes a seat in one of the chairs in front of his brother's desk. While his brother’s reaction isn’t unpleasant Cas still feels like throwing up. Coming out as an adult was never in the cards. He was just going to go on with his life and pretend like no one else existed.
Dean makes his way to Crowley’s office passing lots of ladies on his way. They all look him over like he’s a piece of meat. Awhile ago it would have excited him, not he just wants to take them all to breakfast and drop them all off at college. He’s slept with a few of them and even though it’s small, he feels like he has a connection to them.
“Dean, I think something is wrong,” Benny whispers and puts up a protective arm up in front of Dean to stop him from taking anymore steps towards Cas. Dean looks back to Cas who has now taken a few steps back and stands just in the line of trees. He didn’t look like Cas. His eyes weren’t as blue, he’s dirty, bloody, and bruised. He looks soulless. Like his grace has been ripped out of him. He looks like one of the souls he used to torture in Hell. He looks empty.
Cas looks up at him and Dean finally meets his gaze. He notices his eyes are watering like he’s about to start crying. Angels don’t cry. The thought makes Dean’s skin crawl and he feels guilty for ever being angry with Cas. Tears prick in his own eyes and he looks back to the floor in front of Cas.
“I know what it’s about and you should too,” Dean accuses. Cas does know and he’s been avoiding it. He doesn’t want Dean to backslide and if there was a time for it, it would be right about now.
“Are you going to get up anytime soon?” Dean sits up quickly and looks at the man sitting across from the bed he’s lying in.
Dean wakes up again and knows that Cas is awake. He can feel him staring. He’s probably counted his freckles twenty times by now. He keeps his eyes closed and lets the feeling of calmness and familiarity wash over him.
Charlie leaves mumbling about being a queen and Dean relaxes again when he can hear her in the back room moving things around. He doesn’t say anything he just lets Benny work.
The end of his route seems like it takes forever. He just wants to get to the guy and give him the stuff. It’s freezing today. The sun is out but there is a cold breeze and it makes Dean’s cheeks and nose feel like they are on fire. He stops the truck and gets out to walk over to where the guy usually sits.
He’s happy and feels content with Cas by his side. It’s like Lisa or Cassie, but better. It’s like running and running and looking for water and finally finding it. It’s refreshing to be with Cas. It’s waking up happy and going to bed happy. It’s too much happy. He’s too happy. Dean doesn’t get to be happy and he knows that something is coming.
“I heard...what you said,” Cas looks different. He looks like someone who has lost something and has nothing left to lose. He has lost the look of celestial being and looks more like a man. A normal, broken down man.
“I think I might be coming down with something. I’m not feeling so well.” He licks his lips again, damn my eyes for betraying me. I can’t stop myself from looking at his stupid perfect mouth.
He pulls into a parking spot, checks his hair and teeth before getting out, and makes his way to the front doors. There is a guard reading a book at the desk with his back to Dean. He doesn’t know what to do or say, so he just walks up and clears his throat. The man turns around and greets Dean with a huge smile. His name tag says, Marv.
His morning is like all his mornings except, it’s Tuesday. He has the downtown route on Tuesday. It’s not that the route is hard or anything, but he hates having to fight with traffic. Residential areas are easier because it’s easier to maneuver around cars, toys, and other things people leave lying around. People are terrible drivers downtown. He just doesn’t have the time or energy to deal with them most of the time.
He feels a little sad that he’s been living in this town for a little over a year and he still feels like a stranger. Maybe that’s his fault, though. He doesn’t go out much and so far the only friend he’s made is a homeless guy who he may or may not find attractive.
A week passes before the trio find the portal. Its late in the evening and the sun is setting. Dean's tired and feels sick. He just wants to stop. He and Cas haven't talked since he had found him and he thinks it’s because of something having to do with Benny. Whenever he looks at either of the men they look away from him, almost like they pity him.
“C Street.” Dean was not expecting that. C Street was full of homeless drug addicts and prostitutes who were willing to do anything for money. He sits up in the chair and looks at Crowley to see if the older man is joking. Dean had nearly lived on C Street before this job to keep food on the table, pay rent, and put clothes on Sam’s back.
“Yeah, Cas. We can do that,” I reply and watch as he falls asleep. I watch him for I don’t know how long before I’m coming down from my high and I’m finally able to sleep. He’s warm next to me and while I know that this could be the end of Cas and I, I can’t help but feel like this is where I’m supposed to be. In his arms, in his bed, content, and feeling happy.
“It’s been too long. I’m ready. In fact, I’m pretty sure this will cure a helluva lot of my issues right now.” That’s the consent Cas is looking for. Enthusiastic, willing, and wanting.
The second time he was drunk sticks out in his mind. They had snuck some drinks from a party that Cas’s older brother, Gabe, was having. He suspected Gabe knew, but he clearly never said anything to anyone. Dean had been talking about how he had been kissing Lisa and Cas confessed that he had never kissed anyone besides family before. Not thinking Dean had leaned in and planted a kiss to his friend's lips. Most kids would freak out if their same-sex best friend had kissed them, but not Cas.
“Right. I...we better get back.” Dean says, looking over his shoulder at Benny who’s sharpening his weapon. Dean takes one more glance and Cas and then takes off towards Benny. He thinks Cas might have looked disappointed but it doesn’t matter. He’s getting them out of Purgatory tomorrow and nothing is going to stop him.

“I’ve never seen him like this,” Dean says quietly. Benny nods and takes another step forward. Benny steals a glance and Dean and his fingers touch the fabric of the angeles coat. Cas turns around, his eyes are glowing a bright and vibrant blue. Cas raises a hand and both men are sent flying back towards the tree line.
“How do you know? You don’t even know me, Dean!” Cas’s tone has taken a raw edge and it makes Dean want reach out and grab Cas’s hand to calm him. He knows the other man is fighting back his emotions.
"Goodbye, Dean," Castiel turns back around and walks away clutching the backpack to his body as if it’s going to protect him. Dean scrubs and hand over his face and watches as Cas rounds the corner.
“Andy?” Dean says quietly. He can hear movement and muffled crying. He doesn’t want to open the tent. He doesn’t want to know or see what’s inside but he does it anyway. Inside he sees a guy about the same age as him bound and gagged. He’s lying face down on the filthy blankets. His face streaked with tears. His pants and down around his thighs and Dean can’t help but rip the tent door open and get in there to help the guy. The man cries silently while Dean unties him and gets his clothes together.
“Are you okay?” He asks. There is a playful tone to his voice and my heart races. I can almost feel the heat from his gaze in my veins.
There is a lull in their conversation and Dean accepts it. Sam is still fidgeting. His eyebrows are knit together in worry. But Dean will wait until Sam’s ready. He’s not going to push.
“I’ve already left my whole life behind. I thought we were friends, Andy. What do you want from me? I thought…” He doesn’t finish his sentence. He doesn’t want to admit that he might have loved the other man.
The photo had been taken a few years ago at the fair. It was one of the best days he and Dean had ever had, and luckily Sam had snapped a photo. Dean had been so happy. He acted like he didn’t have a care in the world, ate too many corn dogs, and puked all over Cas on the Ferris wheel because he was terrified of heights. Cas smiles at the memory and looks up to see Dean standing there watching him.
Just a warning that the next chapter will EXTREMELY SHORT so if you want to wait until the following week to catch up, you can.
The name alone in the Supernatural world is enough to make any ghost, vampire, or supernatural being second guess sticking around. Dean is known for being ruthless, strong, and being unafraid of killing first and asking questions later. He is, before anything else, a hunter and there is no telling anyone otherwise.
Dean drives for a few days before his head starts to clear and he’s ready and eager to get back to Sammy. He knows that figuring out the last two trials and closing up Hell is sealing Cas’ fate. He hates that place more than anyone will ever know. He hates it because of what he did there, all the souls he sliced up. Their screams will forever be stuck in his mind.
Dean sat in the local sheriff’s office waiting for Agent Mills. He would be lying if he said he wasn’t nervous that his past had truly finally caught up to him. The fact that all the chaos in his life hadn’t found him sooner kinda shocks him. He looks around the small room and sighs. His fingers tapping on the desk in front of him over and over. He can hear every time someone passes by the door, but no one enters. He feels guilty. Cas is waiting in the lobby.
He knows something changed in Purgatory. He knows the feeling that he has whenever he thinks of Cas is a feeling he hasn’t felt in a long time and he knows that he can’t afford to feel it. He can’t afford to let his feelings get in the way of this battle that he’s losing little by little. He needs his best friend to help him but he needs the Cas from before Purgatory.
They walk through the back area of the shop. The walls are lined with boxes of cake toppers, sugar, flour, and various other things. There is music coming from the area that Dean assumes is the kitchen. Crowley just walks right in and turns off the radio. A man a little younger than Dean turns around and looks at Crowley. The sheer fear on the man’s face makes Dean want to turn around and run.
“Dean,” Sam asks, his voice quiet and low, “what’s a faggot?” Dean turns to face his brother in response and remembers the first time he had ever heard that word. He had been seven. He was playing with some kid who had two dads and some older kids were walking by who yelled the word at the kid. Dean’s not sure what it means entirely but he thinks it means gay and he also knows it’s not nice because the kid ran off crying.
Sam is waiting outside the bunker with Kevin when he pulls up. Sam opens Cas’ door and lifts him up and out of the car and into the building. Dean sits there staring at the door until Kevin is standing by his window telling him that Sam needs him. He doesn’t remember driving back to the bunker and he doesn’t remember walking in to talk to Sam. All he can see is Cas’ lifeless body lying on the table behind where Sam is standing.
“Where?” This sounds fun. It’s too easy to charm people into doing what he wants. He leans back in his chair and waits for the information he wants. Something about the way Crowley is smiling at him makes him feel unsettled.
He’s back in a matter of moments carrying a little black box. Goosebumps break out over my skin at the sight of it and he smirks at me.
The drive to the lake is calming. There’s no traffic, the sun is shining, and no one is going to be out today due to it being Monday. He can spend the whole day there if he wanted. He probably will.
“What?” Dean’s head starts spinning. He’s not sure if it’s from the hangover or the fact that his brother has told him the first piece of good news he’s heard in a long time. He rubs a hand over his face and tries to focus on Sam’s words and not his pounding headache.
Dean’s promotion had not been a surprise, but the amount of money he was making was. He saved as much as he could but it was hard not to want to spend it all on drinking and sex. It wasn’t like he was able to date. So, he found himself drunk and slightly satisfied at Crowley’s personal brothel nearly every night. It was never enough. He wanted more. He needed more. It was too easy to walk in and get what he wanted.
Dean had barely made it out of Purgatory alive. Yes, Purgatory was uncomplicated and brought out the primal side of himself, but it also made him realize that Cas was important to him. He spent so much time trying to find Cas and thinking about him that he could think of nothing else. He spent months looking for him, praying to him, and crying for him. He was weak but also strong because Cas was his reason for fighting. He was lucky to have found help in Purgatory.
"Dean would be correct about that. Stay after and we can have a little chat and possibly schedule something?"
He makes his way West towards Sam. Sam calls a lot and Dean lies and tells him everything is fine. He doesn’t tell him that he was in the hospital and he doesn’t tell him that he’s on the run and hiding. He hopes that Alistair doesn’t try to find Sam. He hadn’t mentioned anything.
“For what?” Dean asks. It comes out harsher than he means, but Cas has nothing to be sorry for. Cas isn’t the one who had nearly gotten his brother killed. He wasn’t the one who lied. He wasn’t the one who created chaos wherever he went.
Saturday Sam can sense his brothers mood and goes to his friends house for the night. Cas must sense it too because he sits extra close and holds Dean’s hand while they watching Star Wars for the millionth time. The credits are just starting to roll and Cas pulls him up and leads him to his bedroom.
“We have to get back. Sam found Metatron,” Dean says. He pushes himself from the wall and starts to gather his things and clean up the hotel room. Cas doesn’t move. He just stands there watching. Maybe waiting for something.
As soon as he’s safely in the hotel room he opens the bottle and gulps down the golden liquid. He keeps drinking until his throat is burning and there are drops dripping from his chin. He slams the bottle down and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. The whiskey burns all the way down to his belly leaving a warm sensation running through his veins. He quietly walks to the bathroom, strips his clothes off, and turns on the water. As he steps in he catches his reflection in the mirror. The scar is faint but he can just make out where Cas’ fingertips had been. He roughly pulls back the shower curtain and steps under the warm spray and lets it wash away two days worth of sweat and grime.
Friday Dean wakes up too early to someone beside him. He sits up and sees dark hair sticking out of his blankets in the dim light. His heart feels like it’s going to burst right out of his chest.
“How much do you want to cut today?” Benny asks, but his gaze doesn’t leave Dean’s face. It feels like he’s trying to get inside Dean’s head and see the darkest corners of his mind.
“I’m worried that with everything going on, Sam is going to make some really dumb decisions just like I did. I want to be strong for him, but I’m barely strong enough for myself. And I shouldn’t have talked about your brother like that. I should be thankful that Sam has someone to talk to. Even if it’s not me.”
“How do you want me?” He asks and licks his lips. I think about my answer before I say anything. I know what I want to say right away, but I should weigh my options before I decide because this could be the first and last time that this happens.
“Shame. He hasn’t paid for his products in quite some time. It would be a quite a disaster if something happened to his precious cupcakes.” Crowley says. Dean watches as Crowley walks over the the back of the display and takes a red velvet cupcake out and takes a bite.
“Are you going to sit down?” Cas asks and Dean shrugs off his jacket and sits down. Cas hands him one of the drinks and picks at the muffin in front of him.
He could have done anything with his life after his father died but he convinced himself that he needed to be a hunter. A hunter over anything that he had actually wanted for himself. He had had a taste of normal life with Lisa and Ben and he was forced to end it because he couldn't let the hunter in him just die. He had had a family and responsibilities and a job that was going to guarantee some kind of security for himself.
“I had my interview on Monday. I had asked the owner if I could come in after hours for the interview and he agreed.” Cas takes a deep breath and continues, “I was leaving and I heard these men talking a few doors down. There’s a bar there called Gordon’s. I tried to avoid them, but they saw me. One of them asked me for the time. I didn’t know so I ignored him and took off towards the park,” Cas looks up at Dean. “I’m not weak, but there were three of them. They just kept hitting me and yelling obscenities. I just...I don’t know. I stopped fighting.”
“Don’t fucking touch me!” The older man yells. His hands are moving wildly knocking things off the counter. Dean doesn’t move fast enough and the back of his father's hand slams into his face. Dean gasps and grabs his nose in pain. There is already blood dripping down his lip and into his mouth.
“This isn’t what you think it is, dad,” Dean says. John stares at him and then takes a few steps forward. The two men are toe to toe in the kitchen and it’s the first time Dean has truly been afraid of his father.
It doesn’t take long to climb the ledge where the light flashes and pulses. Benny stops a few feet in front of it trying to stare into the center. It looks as if he can see a forest. Not like the forest here, but real forest. Green trees and living things. He slowly reaches out a hand to touch the light and is flung backwards into the side of the hill, his head hitting a large rock. He feels the blood leak from his head but he’s too dizzy to move. Whatever that thing is its powerful and it wants nothing to do with him.
"I didn't have any clothes of my own. Sam gave these to me last night. I'll give them back as soon as my things are done washing," Cas takes a small step forward but then stops. Staring at Dean, he seems to be waiting for some kind of instruction or command. Dean tries his best to ignore him and gives him a nod before he goes back to looking at the papers in front of him. He hears a small sigh come from Cas' direction and then some shuffling in the kitchen.
He knows that sound of a gun when it goes off. Andy looks scared. Genuinely scared and Dean can’t help but start running. He runs hard and he runs fast. He doesn’t want to know who was shot. He doesn’t want to care. His lungs burn as he runs, but he knows he can’t stop. Not if he wants to live. It will only be a matter of time before they catch up. He takes a turn down his own street before he slows. He has to get home and get more things together. He had cash stashed all over his room. He could get away.
They had made it halfway to the store when Dean steals a look at Cas and realizes something is wrong. Cas’ eyes are closed but it doesn’t look like he’s sleeping. He looks lifeless.
“Dean,” Cas says and turns to face him. Dean doesn’t like what he sees. He can see him and he doesn’t like it. He doesn’t look like himself. He looks like someone else.
They don’t sleep. They just lay there staring at eachother like a bunch of idiots. Dean can’t stop smiling and Cas can’t stop kissing Dean every few minutes.
Clearly, Crowley had found out about the demon tablet being stolen, and with that came an overwhelming amount of demon activity. There are more possessions and more humans being marked up and tortured for information that Dean is sure they never had. He knows Crowley is mocking them, trying to draw them out to get the tablet back. He also knows there is a price on the head of anyone or anything currently helping or who had helped them in the past, Cas being at the top of that list.
“Yes, Sir,”  Dean replies and follows behind his dad. As he gets to the end of the dock, he takes Sam by the hand and leads him back to the house.
Gabriel takes his brother’s hand and holds it for a long time. He doesn’t want to let it go ever again. He knows there is more to this story, but he doesn’t know if he can listen right now. Right now, he wants to go to his mother's house and burn it down.
Dean strips down to his underwear and crawls in next to Cas. They both lay on their backs staring up at the ceiling. It was Cas’s last night.
He looks down and see’s his phone buzzing on the coffee table. He picks it up and stares at it for a moment before he finally answers.
“I don’t know about that,” He says. He eyes Benny while he mixes the shaving cream in the small bowl he’s holding. He sits down and Charlie follows.
“Dean, I can hear you thinking. You’re making it impossible to sleep.” Sam turns his head towards his brother and cracks a small smile.
“What’s going on?” Dean asks trying to assess the situation. His brother, Sam, is standing in the living room and his father is standing in the kitchen, both red-faced and angry.
“Gotcha!” Dean jumps out from behind the tree. Castiel falls to the ground covering his head. Dean can’t stop the laughter that erupts from his mouth. He walks over to the boy in the middle of his laughing fit and stands over him. The giggles quickly subside when the kid looks up at Dean with tears in his eyes. He kneels on the ground in front of the boy and reaches out a hand. Castiel shies away, “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you that bad.”
“You are. You’re sulking,” Cas places a hand on Dean’s shoulder and directs him to the curb. They both sit, their shoulders touching.
Sam grabs Dean’s hands and pulls them away from himself roughly, ”Have you been drinking?” Sam asks. Dean lets out a breath he doesn’t realize he’s holding. He swore he would stop drinking. He swore it and he lied. He was useless drunk and Sam knew it. He was just like his dad, “You promised, Dean.”
“Oh, ol’ blue eyes, huh?” She laughs. Dean realizes there’s a story there, but doesn’t ask any questions.
“I hate Tuesday,” He mumbles, sitting up and wiping the sleep from his eyes. It’s barely light out and it feels cooler than usual. A shiver runs down his spine as his skin breaks out in goosebumps. He reaches out to grab his phone and nearly blinds himself trying to disable the alarm. He can already tell that it’s going to be a long day. He groans as he makes his way to the shower. The warm water helps him wake up a little, but it’s coffee he really wants.
"I feel okay, I guess. He's allowed to worry. I would be worried if it had been the other way around. But, I just- I'm not just going through the motions. I know that it may seem like it right now, but I'm doing this and making an effort." Dean replies. He looks at Sam and gives him a small smile. He looks over to Cas who seems to be in another world.
“I swear to God himself, Alistair. If you touch one hair on his head, I will kill you. You know I can and I will,” At that Dean turns and starts walking back to his car. He has to get out of there. He can’t breathe. He feels like his lungs are on fire. His legs are shaking, but he makes it just in time to sit down in the front seat of the Impala and go into a full-blown panic attack.
Dean looks up at the question. Cas has brought his knees up to his chin and wrapped his arms around them. He looks scared and Dean knows that he can’t be comfortable sitting with bruised ribs like that.
"You love him don’t you?” Benny asks. Dean’s eyes snap open and his body tenses, “No need for dramatics, Winchester. I’m not here to judge you. You know? I actually feel a little bit jealous of you. You’ve got something to live for. Even in a place like this.”
“I’m glad you’re back,” She says. He can tell that she means it but her voice is so small it’s hard for him to imagine that she’s the spunky outspoken woman that he’s become so attached to.
Cas takes a step closer to Dean and looks at the floor, “I thought I was doing the right thing. I didn’t understand.”
Dean’s heart clenches and he hates what he’s about to do, but it’s better him than some creep, “I don’t do this. But, I have a couch if you’d like to get off the street for a bit. My apartment is small, but it’s warm and you can shower and whatever.”
Day two is pretty much the same as the first. Cas doesn’t really talk much, but he doesn’t seem as angry as before. Dean makes him his famous ‘Dean Winchester BBQ Burger’ and he feels a swell of pride when Cas bounces in his chair at the excitement of taking his first bite.
Benny looks at the glowing light again and everything starts to make sense. That’s why Purgatory felt so off. There is someone there who wasn’t supposed to be. A human. He looks again to the man in front of him and is slightly shocked to see the man pulling a bright blue light from his self inflicted wound.
The line goes dead and Dean looks over at his dresser. The watch is still sitting in the box. He only wore it for a short time. Something about it made him feel uneasy. The whole situation made him feel uneasy. He shouldn't take the job, but making seven hundred bucks per delivery was too good to pass up. Besides, he didn’t have to work for this guy forever. Just a few months to get things going for Sam.
Dean takes a few of the photos and looks at him. In them, he’s about 17 and he’s definitely at C Street. The further into the stack he gets the more explicit they get. Photo after photo of Dean doing unspeakable things for money. Photos of Dean looking broken and sad. Photos of Dean with his head thrown back in pleasure. Dean on his knees. Dean on his back. Dean on all fours. Dean bloody. Dean crying.
Cas smiles and walks into the larger man's arms and they embrace quickly. The man reaches out a hand to Dean and nods at him. Dean takes his hand and nods in return.
“Cas, I’m gonna come.” Dean says and kisses Cas’s shoulder and neck. Cas squeezes a little harder but keeps up the pace and Dean can feel his orgasm wash over him. His hips start moving on their own and his breath his caught in his throat. “Fuck!”
“Benny works at the barber shop downtown. He comes out here twice a month for free haircuts and shaves.” Cas absently rubs the scruff on his face.
“I don’t need your help!” Cas snaps, pushing Dean’s hand out of the way. He forces himself to stand and it’s clear he’s in a lot of pain, but Dean lets him hobble to the bathroom. He still won’t talk about what happened and Dean doesn’t want to push it.
He’s now face down under the kid’s body pushing the kid as hard as he can, his lungs burning. The need for air is too much. His mouth opens and breathes in a mouthful of water. Before he loses consciousness he thinks he made it to the dock but he’s not sure. He doesn’t care as long as the kid is alright.
