Clearly, Tony should not be putting much faith on the power of love that he bears for other people, because it certainly isn’t getting him anywhere.
That night, Steve comes to bed, and Tony is already lying under the covers, pulled up to his waist, while he swipes across the tablet in his lap with the pad of a single thumb.
Steve shakes his head. “I’m still getting this wrong. What I meant to say is that I find you attractive-”
“I’m fine, I don’t need anyone to stay with me, I’m fine,” he stresses, something like acid churning around in his gut. “I’m fine,
Steve throws his hands up in the air. “It’s two in the morning, and you want to have this argument right now?” he demands.
“Her name’s not Natasha Romanoff,” James tells him, almost delighted to throw this secret out into the open. “Her real name is Natalia Alianovna Romanova. She was part of a secret KGB program called the
His stomach tapers in, and he still has a flat belly, even if it isn’t as taut as it once was. If he sits down, though, there will be rolls of fat against his stomach as well, but all he can think is that it’s not as flat as it was before, when Steve and him first met, first made love.
“You really fucking think that your girlfriend gave you those photos out of the goodness of her own heart?” Tony taunts. “She did that because she wanted me out of the way, you fucking moron, because she had the information that would tank me as a threat, because she knew you’d never have the balls to get rid of me yourself; she knew she had to go nuclear to get what she wanted, to take my place, and she picked the perfect accusation to go with.”
Tony shrugs, mouth pinched into a taut line. “I have a pretty shitty view of myself,” he says, honestly. “It wasn’t just… I mean, my father contributed to that. An abusive ex contributed to that, and I was like that, I had that bad view of myself, even when I met Steve. It wasn’t something that just sort of happened in the last few years or anything. So, I imagine, if Steve had told me about Bucky, I probably would have reacted badly.”
Grant erupts in a gale of laughter. “Well spoken, my lord,” he drawls. “You are everything that I was expecting and more.”
Steve’s eyes lift to catch his. Tony forces himself to not look away, to not shy away in shame, because Steve will only believe this is nothing to be embarrassed about if Tony himself is not embarrassed by it.
“Stop thanking me.” Wanda rolls her eyes. She flings a soft smile at the children, who have managed to get distracted by Dora again. “They remind me of Pietro and me. To be a twin is a special thing,” she murmurs, her eyes glazing over.
Then, Tony remembers the way that Steve had spoken to him when they were having sex last night, the possessive diatribe that he’d been dealt.
Natasha’s entire form turns lax. “Fine, Steve was busy that night, and I offered to bring you dinner because I wanted to know more about you. You were… well, you were hostile to say the least; you didn’t want me in your house, and you definitely didn’t want me around your kids, but I guess I just wanted to see you in your element, you know? Your house and your kids, and I know that Steve was really busy, and he seemed really tired, and I was concerned about him,” she says, defensively.
When no such visit comes, no such accusation is made, Tony breathes a sigh of relief, but his lungs don’t drop from his throat (he doubts they ever will, not until he dies and he doesn’t have some fleshy, earthly body to stow his worries as a parent in).
“Why don’t you two get washed up? And get your jammies on,” Tony tells the twins, and they rush off towards their bedroom.
“I knew that you’d come back through my door one day, and it meant that I couldn’t put you out of my head the way that I wanted to.” He looks up at him. “Why are you here now? Tonight?”
Bhim’s eyes slide over Tony’s shoulder to fixate on Steve lingering behind him, awkwardly. “I can see that.”
“Because he was scary,” Tony says, quietly. “I could feel… this knot in my belly, and I’ve… I’ve been scared before, but nothing like that.”
James’ hand tightens like a band around Tony’s throat, not to the point of pain or even discomfort, but enough that drives him closer towards an edge, throws a spanner in the words, but not a terrible spanner, a fucking amazing spanner, because he didn’t even know breathplay was one of his things.
“This is a really complicated thing to talk about, okay,” Tony says, softly. “You should know that I will never lie to you, and whatever happens between Daddy and me, we both love you very, very much.”
“You have never cared what I did with myself this whole time,” Tony points out. “I might have gotten mugged or bashed a thousand times over when I tried to pick up the kids. I might have been carjacked or shot at when picking up the fucking dry cleaning. You didn’t care. You only cared when you chose to come home at a normal time instead of the middle of the night like normal. Well, guess what, I don’t exist to be your doll, Steve. You don’t get to pull me out of the box whenever you want to play with me. That’s not how this works. I have my own fucking life, and I am entitled to leave this house whenever I fucking want.”
“Yeah, I’m fine,” Tony says, keeping his voice purposefully low. “Just had a little dream. I’m falling right back to sleep.” He pauses. “How did you even hear me?”
Steve tilts his head. “And what, you didn’t know, then? You didn’t know about me being SHIELD? Or Natasha?”
“It is the Syamantaka gem, if it is there, in Dwārakā, it is not something man was meant to disturb. God made sure that it would not be touched when Dwārakā was submerged. Death has always surrounded it. It is not of this earth.”
“Whether or not I like him is irrelevant. What did you do to him, and how soon can you turn him back?”
Tony doesn’t realise that he’s said the words aloud until he sees Steve shaking his head, vehemently.
“It’s quite alright,” Tony cuts him off. He turns on his feet, as a pretty omega nurse approaches. “Now,
His shoulders are broad, but narrow, bony with lean muscle, muscle that he hasn’t lost after all these years, the benefit of being a veritable blacksmith in this day and age, even if engineer is the more appropriate term.
“And you know what really fucking galls me, Steve? All these times you’ve accused me of screwing around on you, I could’ve,” he snarls, suddenly, baring his teeth. “I could’ve slept with someone else, Steve. I could’ve slept with a thousand other people if cheap, hot sex was all I wanted. There are a million people in this world who would kill to sleep with me, who would
Steve is in the lounge room of the penthouse, and the lights are on, cutting across his handsome face in shards, when he rounds on Tony.
“No,” Tony says, fiercely, taking Steve’s flinch in stride, “but it wasn’t about that. I didn’t help him because I’m in love with him. I helped him because I thought he deserved my help. They’re two different things.”
A resident shows up in the room, stares at the situation, and then, proceeds to round on the nurse. “Why is he still up for God’s sake?”
He takes a deep breath, thinks of Natasha Romanoff’s dark auburn hair, her sly, plump smile, and he shakes his head.
It must be the fat, Tony decides. That must be the reason why Steve doesn’t want to have sex with him anymore.
Both men are tall, with golden hair, pale skin like milk, so much darker than Tony’s, and blue eyes, like the sea before a storm in the middle of summer. There’s a sly tilt to the brother’s mouth, while Lord Steve’s lips are turned down at the corners, as though he would rather be elsewhere.
Tony runs his hand through his hair, fisting his hand there just for a moment before he releases the strands. “Because the guy saw the picture of me, James got scared that he’d come after me, so he returned to the States to find me, to make sure that I was okay, and I suppose, watch over me from afar to make sure that I continued to stay okay. He didn’t expect to find me married with kids, I don’t think. But, uh, because he came back, well, James is fairly well known in his industry, I guess, is the neatest, most wholesome way of putting it, and his return flagged a certain organisation’s attention.”
Bucky and Steve had proposed – well, calling it a proposal would be overselling it, frankly, because it happened, while they were fucking, and Bucky’s hands tightened on her hips, a sign if anything that he was about to come, and his mouth was a slack, wet smear against the bare curve of her shoulder, and then, he said it, he said, “let’s get married.”
“It’s SHIELD, Tony. They’re following me right now. I’m a little worried that they’ve managed to bug my apartment. I need your help.”
No matter how hard Tony shouts, bangs on the screen, Natasha never once looks at the window; she just pulls the twisted covers around her shoulders and succumbs once more to sleep.
“We met when I was sixteen. You killed a guy at a frat party I was at, because he was, what, dragging this drunk girl up to a room and she was completely out of it, right?”
His pulse is wild and skittering, and his body is hot all over, even if the set to his shoulders suggests ease outward.
It seems somehow too personal to say this, too problematic to confess that James had asked Tony to run away with him, to bring the kids, and that he would happily raise the twins as his own and hadn’t even flinched when saying so, as if it were absolute truth that any child of Tony’s was his child as well.
“I will, as long as you promise to take care of yourself as well,” Tony retorts. “Between the two of us,
He manages to work his body around so that he’s on the side of the pillar away from Tony. The pillar moves, showering dust. Steve looks at the chamber wall five feet away, takes a breath, and swings his legs up against it, now braced between the pillar and wall.
, doll. I know. I just… I had to leave,” he says, pathetically earnest. “I had to leave because… because it was safer for you if I did. They were coming after me, Tony. They were coming after me, and I… I was just trying to protect you from them. I didn’t want you to get into the middle of it all.”
“Right, yeah, I’ll go and see what’s going on. No, just some neighbours having a fight, I guess. I’m fine, I’m fine! Call you in the morning!”
Stone doesn’t even realise that Steve’s in the elevator with him; he’s busy muttering to himself, singing, even, and he’s still completely oblivious when the elevator doors slide open into the penthouse apartment and Steve walks out with him.
Steve sighs and tilts Tony to the side, so that Tony can reach out with one hand and grab the wine glass.
Bhim returns in moments, and in his once-free hand, is a tall, golden pole, like a scepter, with a little hatch at the top. With a sound of triumph, he manages to put the medallion and the scepter together. They fit perfectly.
, I love you. I loved you when I was a boy, and I’m not… I’m not the kind of person that falls out of love with people, even after they hurt me, and you fucking
Tony plasters a faux smile on his face. “Hi, Wanda. Thanks for taking care of the kids last night. I just came to take them off your hands.”
Pepper purses her lips. “He scraped his fingernails along things.” She cuts herself short. “Actually, they were more like finger-knives or something, like he'd made them himself?” She shakes her head, visibly discomfited. “Anyway, they made this horrible noise–”
Tony’s shared a life with this man in front of him for years, for over a decade, and he thought, above all else, that he knew him, knew him like he knew himself and now, all he thinks when he looks at him, is that maybe he doesn’t, maybe he didn’t, because if someone had come to him three years ago and told him that Steve was the type to cheat on him, to have an affair behind his back and not even just a one-night stand when he was feeling drunk and sad, well, Tony would have laughed in their faces.
His mother had borne it, quietly, her mouth a thin, pinched line, noting how they were all white women, younger, brighter, happier, unburdened by being Howard Stark’s wife and the mother of his child.
“Sorry, I’m late for class,” Pepper replies, her voice apologetic, and rushes off without another word.
Tony nods, rubs the heels of his hands over his eyes. “Yeah, um, a couple of weeks ago, James showed up at my face, just before I was going to drop the kids off at school. I hadn’t seen him in…
Steve runs his tongue over his lower lip, nodding to himself, and then, he rolls off Tony, perching on the edge of the bed. He runs his hand over his face and through his hair, fisting his fingers in the strands.
James sits forward and scours his pale, intent gaze on every inch of the park that he can see, and then, he shakes his head.
Steve kisses his forehead, his eyes, his cheeks, his nose, his jaw, before finally taking his sweat-shiny mouth with his own, with bruising force until Tony is whining low in his throat, clenching around Steve desperately.
. I love you, and I love our kids, and maybe, just maybe when I’m in a better place and you’re in a better place, and
wanted you. You’re… you’re beautiful and intelligent and fierce, and you’re strong and full of pride, and I wanted you that very first moment that I saw you in that courtyard,” Steve says, with a passion that borders on madness. “But I’m… I’m eight and ten, and you are six and ten, and yes, two years doesn’t seem like that much of a difference, but it is to me, and you had never even left your lands before–”
Steve clears his throat and pads forward, his knees bumping against the edge of the bed. He’s wearing new pyjamas, Tony observes, a thin short-sleeved shirt and lounge pants – clearly Natasha’s doing, if Tony knows anything.
Lord Steven looks up, sees the hand on the sheets, and the way that Tony has stretched his body out, and something shadows over his expression.
Realisation dawns in Steve’s eyes, and then, his expression shadows – the expression feels like a blade angling upwards so that it slides in just under Tony’s ribs.
overreacting, that he wasn’t being silly, just knowing that his children still love him and think the world of him, and hearing it from someone else, a veritable stranger, is more comforting than even Steve saying it to him.
“Tony, Tony, you know I think the world of you, but you’re an engineer, and sure, you’ve got more muscle mass than most people and you’ve got some self-defence training, but these guys are in my realm of skill,” James tells him, with a certain bone-deep weariness.
Peter frowns. “I think so,” he says, carefully. “Do they, are they doing this because they love me?”
Steve’s rhythm is just as hard as his, and Tony can feel it, feel it like an echo of all the motion from Steve’s hips right into him, like Steve, through James, is fucking him, like they’re all joined together in a perfect synchrony.
Tony slides to his feet, and he removes his coat, throwing it onto a nearby settee, gesturing with a few fingers for Steve to do the same. He removes it a little haphazardly, like he’s feeling too many things to be wholly present of simple actions like removing a coat.
“No!” Tony says, his voice sliding high and punching out. “No, really, I'm fine. I'll go straight home. I'm okay.”
Tony’s throat flexes, and instead of dread, it’s rage that’s opening up in his belly. “Oh?” he says, his voice thin and taut.
He looks back at him, stonily, this man that Tony loves still so desperately, loves like he can’t help himself, loves like he’d still die for him, put himself between a bullet and James gladly and happily and have no regrets except leaving his children so early.
One night, he climbs out of his bed, dons his robe, much like the first night with Grant, but this time, there is a confidence to his steps that wasn’t there that other night, a freedom that came with the fact that he’d killed Grant himself, felt his lifeblood pour out all over his body, and watched him choke up his last breath.
The door slides open when he unlocks it, and his family, Howard and Maushmi and Ana and Jarvis, are all in the living room when he walks in.
For someone who’s tied to a chair, Tiberius Stone does manage to dredge up an unreasonable amount of scorn for someone who he thinks is below him.
Maybe it would have been better if he died with Tony; maybe they should have died together; maybe Steve wasn’t supposed to live without him.
“That wasn’t the dream,” he says, dully, his throat flexing. “That wasn’t the dream I had. It wasn’t about Pepper, not really. It was… I saw her body bag in the hall.”
Grant slides his fingers inside Tony’s body, still finding him dry – Tony is determined to never be wet for him; he can only ever be wet for his alpha (that’s a lie; sometimes, he’s wet, and he promises himself that it’s just his body failing him, that there is no sin on his part, that there is no part of him that wants Grant or his violence; it’s just his stupid, pathetic body).
“Are you two fucking done?” he asks, his voice breaking messily. “Because you’re acting like a bunch of fucking animals, and I don’t want the kids to come down here and see you both like this; they might start to think that this is how civilised human beings act and solve all their problems.”
It starts with Clint, and then, there’s T’Challa, and Shuri and Okoye, and Wanda and Sam, and all of the original Avengers, the five of them that had watched Tony take a nuclear bomb into a wormhole into space and then, watched as he came tumbling out, against all odds, and so does Steve, so does Pepper, so does Peter.
“Let me just get my phone. I don’t want to miss a moment of this,” Steve tells him, grappling for his phone that’s lying on the sheets towards the end of the moment.
It’s easy to do that, to treat Steve like he’s one of Tony’s children than his husband, his husband in a marriage with all those problems that need to be resolved.
“I’d never walk away from you,” Steve says, firmly, his voice blunt. “I know I’ve made my fair share of mistakes, and I know I’ve lied, and I hate myself for lying to you, but… I don’t know, maybe this is my fault.”
James nods, briskly. “Yeah, and one of them got away before I killed him, and I know that he came back here. So, I followed him. I… I wasn’t intending on making contact with Tony, especially when I found out that he was married and that he had kids. But then-”
Ms Lewis returns after a moment with two xeroxed sheets of paper, which she hands over to him. He folds them into neat little rectangles and places them into his wallet.
Jarvis purses his lips, a furrow appearing in his brow, like he doesn’t trust what Tony’s saying. “Alright, then, off to bed with you,” he says, sternly.
Tony ganders a look at Steve’s face, and his expression is strained and reverential, something that fills Tony with the strongest emotion he’s felt in a long time, and Tony kisses him, buries his nose where Steve’s scent is the strongest, until it floods all of his senses. Steve thrusts inside him, dragging the air out of his lungs, furious and clumsy and familiar, and Tony moans, moans like a cheap whore, and holding onto him as tight as she possibly can.
“Krishna then returned to Dwārakā with the Syamantaka gem and his new bride. Krishna returned the gem to its rightful owner, Satrajit, who by then was ashamed of accusing Krishna. In order to make up for his accusations and show his goodwill towards Krishna, Satrajit offered his daughter Satyabhama to Krishna.”
“She showed me these drawings that the kids made, of their families. You want to see them, because I have copies? They’re… they’re fucking stupendous, really, they are.”
James smiles, crookedly, and runs his knuckles over Tony’s sharp cheekbone. “You’re too good for this world, Anthony Stark. You deserve better than all of us.”
Tony leans forward, laying the glass down on the edge of the coffee table. “I don’t know, darling; what was your comment about the drinking supposed to mean?”
That night, he returns to Toni’s penthouse. She’s on the couch, in lounge wear, a shirt that he’s fairly certain is one of his, and a pair of black sweatpants. Her hair is up in a high bun, exposing the long, lean line of her throat.
Tony hesitates for an agonising moment, and it’s the final nail in his coffin, because Steve’s face contorts, warps in anger.
Wanda narrows her eyes. “Come on, Tony, we’re friends,” she cajoles. “You can tell me; it’s not like I would make fun of you for it.”
on my own. Not that you ever responded to anything that I did,” Tony mutters under his breath. “And then, shit spiralled out of control, and I was trying desperately to keep you in the house let alone in my fucking bed every night, so it didn’t really work out well. And then, fucking Natasha,” he spits. “Fucking Natasha and her stupid smiles and the stupid way that she touched you and the fucking nerve of her to show up at my door and give me marriage advice, and I was so sure that you were fucking her.”
Suddenly, as they are walking, there is such a starburst of light, splitting through the stone walls, as if nothing on this plane could possibly contain it. Zola hisses, covering his face, and the grip around Tony’s wrists slip. Tony’s eyes are burning under the light, but he’s using the temporary discombobulation of his captors to make quick work of them, punching them in the head and praying for brain damage when they go down like they are made of a bag of bricks.
When he turns around, he sees a wall of dirty canvas sheets, and someone tearing through them, a shoulder jutting through the slit. Long curved fingernails, like knives attached to a hand, punch through the sheet, glinting in the red light that hangs overhead, like a knife through skin.
Steve struggles with it, of course, with the sudden onset of a daily routine with medication and surgeries that require bedrest and recovery, and it doesn’t help that he can’t sequester himself in the gym and beat the shit out of a couple of punching bags, which leads him to therapy.
He lunges, and Tony shouts in surprise and pulls back, dodging out of the way, as Steve knocks James to the ground with all of that muscle, and both men start rolling around on the floor like a pair of animals, and Tony, Tony is so fucking tired with all of this.
“You hurt Toni; you hurt the woman I love, and I’m gonna kill you, and I can’t think of anythin’ more reasonable than that. I love her, I love her more than anythin’ else in this fuckin’ world, and I would burn the whole world to the ground if it means protectin’ her. As long as you’re alive, I can’t protect her. You’ll haunt her as long as you’re here, and she deserves better than that. She deserves someone who would kill
“I know I shouldn’t be making this about myself, not when this is clearly so traumatic for the two of you, but I can’t help but think that,” Tony breaks off, lamely, looking away.
“If that’s what you want me to do,” Tony says, demurely, staring up at him through the dip of his long, thick lashes.
“So, why–” Pepper bites off whatever she was about to say (he wonders if she blames him; between the two of them, Tony was the breakable one in so many ways; maybe if he’d grabbed the stones, used them instead of Tony, Tony would be alive, they would be together; maybe, if Pepper does blame, she’s right to). “Why did it have to be
“I hate them, Hitler, the Reich, the Nazis, all of them,” Tony says, so venomously, so hatefully that it surprises him. “But that doesn’t that we’re ready for this kind of power either. You didn’t see it, Colonel Fury. You didn’t see what it did. It was not made for us, and frankly, I object on a purely selfish basis. If this gem is going somewhere, it’s going back to Dvārakā, where it belongs. It doesn’t belong anywhere else. Too much has been taken from us. The Nazis took a symbol that meant
“Natasha is my friend; she’s a good friend, but you are more important to me. And I… I don’t know, I guess this falls on whether you trust me, whether you trust what I’m saying about me not being interested in Natasha, not sleeping with her, not touching her, not
Peter looks at him with those dark, analysing eyes. Both of their children look like Tony, with their dark hair and their dark skin and their dark eyes, but sometimes, when he’s sleeping, Peter smiles and it’s like Tony is seeing Steve right in front of him. But other than that, the children look like him. In behaviour, though, Peter is Tony’s son, and Maushmi is Steve’s daughter. Peter carries himself in a way that is beyond his years, more sensitive, more cautious, very aware, even if Tony has tried very hard to shield both of them from this, that there are people in this world that would hurt them if they got the chance.
“Yeah, James, turns out being dumped has negative effects on a person’s self-esteem and mental health issues, so they turn to self-medicating so they can get out of bed every day!” Tony retorts, his voice turning into the edge of a blade with every word that passes out of his mouth.
Tony rocks back on his heels. “Colonel, Rogers is only on loan to the USO,” he points out. “Officially, he is still SSR.”
“I’m horny, and you’re not helping. You don’t even seem like you want to have sex with me, not tonight and probably not ever either,” Tony retorts.
James drags a hand over his face, brittle and fierce. “Because you’re all I have in this world,” he tells him.
He rocks his hips, sending his cock deeper into Steve’s throat, and he can feel it, Steve’s throat convulsing around him, the sensation making him even harder than he already is, as he quickly approaches his first orgasm of the night. He can see his cock pulsing in Steve’s throat, and he comes just like that with a soft grunt, spilling in his mouth, thick and slow, shuddering as his nerves are wrung dry by the orgasm.
,” Steve murmurs, and his voice is so unbearably soft that it makes his chest hurt. “I love you too, not more, not less… just… I love you.”
“No!” Rumlow snarls from the altar, his voice echoing through the subterranean chamber. “Not in the presence of the gem! Take him outside.”
This isn’t the place for that, and despite the relief, the stupid, nonsensical love that he’d felt for Steve in that tent, just by looking at what the thought of Tony’s death had done to him, he hasn’t forgotten how they ended.
Before him is a SHIELD agent and the Winter Soldier, and suddenly, the air is anchoring tight in his chest.
Steve takes a step forward, closes the door behind him, so that it’s just him and Tony, with a dead body lying beside them.
Tony leans into Abraham. “What’s the document? They all look like they’re going to piss themselves with fear,” he mutters.
That morning, Tony wakes up in his normal manner; FRIDAY tells him the time and then, she tells him the date, and it’s like a rush of cold water over his head, because Tony had forgotten.
He’s hot, he knows that, and there’s a reason he was voted Sexiest Man Alive for years and years and years, but he’s not
go, though, and Sharon’s diner is saved, and Pepper makes a horrified noise when Clint and Nat and Thor return in the middle of the Hindu ceremony, covered in blood, but Toni just waves her hand, dismissively, because Steve doesn’t have a sister and Bucky doesn’t have a sister but Natasha is his cousin-sister, and Toni needs someone to finish the last knot on her
He looks over his shoulder and walks over to the door, making sure that it’s suitably locked so that they won’t be walked in on. When he turns back around, Steve is already through her window and planted on his bed, stretching out like a cat. Tony throws himself on top, so that he can drape his arms and legs all over Steve.
, you lied straight to our faces about some crisis at the company, so you could go, what, gallivanting with this guy? You’ve just told me that you’ve been spending time with a guy that you’ve had sex with in the past, and you deliberately kept that from me, and what, I’m not supposed to get suspicious? I’m supposed to take it in fucking stride, believe you when you say that nothing happened?”
Tony’s sitting on a chair in a tent, with his hands tied painfully behind his back, and a gag in his mouth. He struggles, but all that it serves to do is make his shoulders ache even more than they already do.
?” Steve stumbles over his words, the red clear in his face now, spreading into his throat. “I don’t want… it’s not that I don’t want, it’s just that I want
“No, no,” Natasha says, hurriedly. “I was just… I don’t know, I guess I just wanted to be sure what kind of person you were.”
“No, you don’t know.” Tony bares his teeth at him. “You said that he told you that if we stayed together, he would disown me, that he would withdraw any and all support that he was giving me, that he would ruin my life. What makes you think that he didn’t do that after you were gone?”
hard for me. I… I remember that fucking video every day, so it’s hard for me, and I… I was hurt for a long time, but I forgave you in the end, Steve. You loved him, and he’s dead now–”
Steve grins at him, boyish and unencumbered, before showing him the shield strapped to his back. “It’s got to be good for something.”
Grant looks up at him at the sound of the door opening, and this is where he should stop, where he should withdraw immediately, maybe even blush a little, and the boy should leave, should run out of the room, terrified of the possibility that Tony will throw him out of the castle for his obscene behaviour.
“The last surveillance flight is back,” she explains. She lays down aerial pictures of the disintegrated HYDRA camp. “No sign of activity.”
Steve pulls Peter away, his hands gentle on the young man’s shoulders. Peter is sobbing just like Pepper is, and Pepper opens her arms up to him (maybe it’s the developing romance that was brewing between Pepper and May before she dusted that allows Peter to fall into her arms easily, but in any case, whatever receding thought that he continues to have is thankful for it).
The other nail is, of course, the fact that Steve and Tony are seemingly incapable of communicating with each other.
Tony doesn’t know how to tell his alpha that he doesn’t get along with Grant at all, that the look that Grant gets in his eyes sometimes when he looks at Tony, that violent, resentful look, terrifies him, features in the nightmares that he has when he closes his eyes for the day.
A shock of dark auburn hair, big, green eyes, sly and cat-like, figure slender, hips wide, and breasts heavy (clearly, she didn’t spend her days running after two children), and the knowing look in her eyes, aware of how beautiful she is and how she can use that to her benefit.
“Well, I don’t know about the demons, but there are alien gods who have warhammers that can summon lightning and we’re friends with them, so who fucking knows?”
“Marry me,” Steve says, firmly. And then, his shoulders cave, curve inward. “I thought… I mean, I practiced how I would do this in the mirror like fifty times, and then, I realised… this is how I want to do it. I just… I want to marry you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and I guess I’m hoping that you’ll want to marry me as well.”
Steve feels like shit now, feels like a total failure, and it must be a thousand times worse because Tony knows now that he’s a SHIELD agent and for him, his civilian (more or less) husband got there first, and it wasn’t about skill or appropriateness or even resources, it was just the fact that Tony was fucking
The bile rises in his throat, sour and bitter – is this what his husband thinks of him, the man he loves, does he think that he’s some fucking weakling that will sit here and take his infidelity and keep his mouth shut and turn a fucking blind eye?
tired, but he’s absolutely not tired enough to say no to Steve. His sex drive hasn’t slowed down, even after two children and all these years he and Steve have been married. In a complete role reversal, it’s
“You see me every day,” Tony complains. “You don’t kiss me like that unless you’re imagining bending me over.”
Bucky had a poker face on, so she turned to look at Steve, who could always be trusted to spill the beans because he couldn’t lie for shit, and he had a guilty look plastered all over him.
engraved on the front. There is a small plush toy from a shooting game at a fair Tony and Steve had visited when they moved to New York. There’s the first sonograph photos that they were given for Peter and Maushmi, even the little tags they got for their wrists when they were born.
Steve sucks in a breath like he wants to say something, but his shoulders slump instead. “Nothing, it’s nothing,” he mutters and starts canting his hips forward.
Steve crawls through mud beneath a barbed-wire net, and Hodge kicks out the support, which results in the net fall on top of Steve. He grapples with it for a moment, before managing to shift onto his belly, plodding along.
When Steve sees him, he drops his bag by the door, as he always does, and moves over to Tony, loping like a wolf, with all that grace and strength, and seizes him up in an embrace, kissing him swift and deep and hard, the sort of kiss that sucks the air right out of his lungs, makes him want to tangle his hands in Steve’s hair and purr like a kitten, let him stroke his hands all over Tony’s body like he’s coming.
“Quill, Star Lord, he was… he was from Earth, half-human or whatever; he found out that Thanos had killed the woman he loved – that was Nebula’s sister, Gamora, and we… we almost had him. Mantis had him under, and Peter and I,” the lump swells fully in the pit of his throat, “Peter and I, we almost had the gauntlet off, and then, Quill realised that the only reason that Thanos came back alone from getting the soul stone was because he killed Gamora. So, he freaked out, attacked Thanos, bashed him over the head with his ray-gun-blaster thingy, and it pulled him out of whatever spell Mantis had him under, and he… he won that fight. He won, and he won because Quill loved someone so much that he couldn’t keep his shit together, and I was pulling him back, because I knew… I knew what that was like. I knew what it was like to lose my shit because I loved someone so much and they were dead and the person that killed them was standing right in front of me, and I… I tried to stop him. It didn’t work. We failed.”
“Yeah, JARVIS?” Tony asks, absentmindedly, his fingers deftly twisting a screw into the leg braces he’s currently working on.
James groans, as the head of Steve’s cock pushes at his rim, and his hands fall onto the mattress, as Tony crawls forward, taking his mouth with his, hand sliding into his hair. He pours lube onto James’ fingers and shoves them between his legs, running his tongue over his lower lip as James fingers him, stretching open his body for his cock.
Natasha lifts her eyebrow. “You do remember that you are a veritable maths genius, right? Couldn’t you just help him with the test?”
Rhodey looks up from his half-full glass of champagne. “I have to admit that I’m not exactly the kind of guy that knows anything about wedding dresses,” he points out.
His father had affairs, had fucked his way through Manhattan, brought drunk, giggling girls half his age home to where his wife and son slept, and gave them defiant, furious looks, as if daring them to protest.
He’d spent the whole morning, drawing up sketches for tactical armour and blending materials together before he’d desperately wanted to rake his nails across his bare arm until he bled, so he’d abandoned the project and found something else to do.
you with your own brother, but also to killing him. What more do you want from me? What else will it take for you to run me through with that sword of yours?” His lips flatten. “What else will it take?”
James grits his teeth. “I had no other choice. You would never have answered my calls. You wouldn’t have seen me any other way. What else was I supposed to do? I need you, Tony.”
“You didn’t do it on purpose. In hindsight, I suppose, I wish I’d probed further on what we were talking about earlier, but I don’t blame you.” Her voice hardens. “I blame the people that did this to me and stole the children. They’re okay?”
Tony stares at him, the light having faded from his eyes. “I don't know who he is. But he's burned, he wears a weird hat, a red and yellow sweater, real dirty, and he uses some sort of knives he’s got made into a sort of... glove. Like giant fingernails.”
Tony, though, is more like his sire than he would like to admit, and he has always preferred machine to man.
“Fuck you,” Tony says, venom creeping into his voice. “Did you think I was pathetic, inadequate, a fucking waste of space this morning when you were the literal standard for human perfection, when I’m old and brown and hairy and pudgy around the belly and broken on the inside and the outside, physically and metaphysically?”
“But… but how else would you know that James is the Winter Soldier; how would you…” Tony frowns. “Did you put the bugs in his apartment?”
. With one final, brutal thrust, Steve comes in a shout, and Tony can feel the change in James’ body above him, as Steve’s orgasm ripples through his body, his ears full of the wet, obscene noise of him continuing to fuck James through the mess of lube and his come, the hot-slick-messy-slide that makes his cock spurt out pre-come onto his belly.
He leans over the side of the bed, eyes on Steve and James, especially as Steve looks like he’s going to maul him with his mouth alone. He fishes his hand inside the bedside table, pulling out a small bottle of lube with a soft growl of glee. He spills a copious moment onto his fingers, just as Steve’s hand finds James’ cock, and Tony watches in amazement, as James slowly starts to stiffen between Steve’s pale fingers.
A scowl edges up over his mouth. “Okay, fine, do I think that sometimes Tony puts himself in bad situations and that means that he’s in danger and he needs help, sure. Do I think he’s an idiot? Of course not. No, this has to do with the fact that I think he doesn’t realise how important he is to people, how much we love him, how much we’d hurt if something happened to him.”
Steve leans down and kisses him with lazy ease. “It’s okay, honey. I’m here, I’ll protect you,” he teases. “I won’t leave your side. Hell, I’ll, uh, even throw my body over yours.”
“Actually,” Steve hesitated for an agonising moment, “that’s something else that we wanted to talk to you about?”
“He’s not leaving, is he?” Peter looks up at James, horrified. “You’re not going anywhere, are you? Don’t go.
His voice is softer than any male alpha that Tony has ever heard before, and he swallows past the knot burning in his throat.
“In fact, I’m pretty sure that the same reason why you’re, uh, struggling with, well, you’re struggling right now is very similar to what I’ve been struggling with since I came back from Afghanistan,” Tony says, quietly.
“I was insecure,” Tony says, his voice matching Steve’s. “I… and I tried, Steve. I tried really fucking hard. I made moves on you. I dressed up like a whore to get you going, and then, after a while, I stopped because I do have some fucking pride, Steve. I was so convinced that you were having an affair, that you were getting your rocks off somewhere else, and I’m sorry about that, I am, I shouldn’t have… I shouldn’t have thought you were capable of something like that, but I wasn’t about to
“Anthony, do you take Steven to be your husband? Do you promise to be faithful to him in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, to love him and to honour him all the days of your life?”
“Even the slightest attention from you means so much more than what Tony does because they know, when the chips are down, Tony is there. You are… to them, unfortunately, a flight risk, so they take as much from you as they possibly can while you’re there.” She turns back to Tony. “That doesn’t mean that they love you any less. It just means that you’re stable and
Steve pulls back, his hands still on Tony’s hips. “What are you talking about?” he asks, confusion marring his brow.
For a second, there’s dull, dead calm, and then, something, a feeling tries to claw its way out of him.
The killer is on top of him, and he’s fighting, struggling, kicking out with his arms and legs with an attempt to dislodge him. His fist flies out, comes into contact with the killer, who’s knocked back flying. The killer staggers for him again, and then, he feels something sharp in his arm.
“Tony?” he says, uncertainly, making a smacking noise with his mouth, suggesting that he was in the throes of sleep when Tony had knocked on the door.
James shrugs. “Am I happy that you’re married? Of course not. But I’d never begrudge you those kids. You… you were always going to be a great father.”
“You don’t know what sort of man James is. Tony, even you don’t. The two of you know halves of a man that hasn’t been made whole. You might not even like the man he is when he’s whole. James… is in a very peculiar circumstance, something which I doubt I will see again in the rest of my career, but I do think that things will change between the three of you as the time passes. I’m not saying that to mean that I think that the three of you won’t go forward with this relationship, but parts of that relationship will change. James needs to be whole, and the two of you need to love that man he is going to become before anything can happen between the three of you. He needs to know what he wants as a person before he can be a part of this relationship. He needs to be his own person, have a life, some stability, before you can be three people in a relationship. And, I hate to say this, but he has to be prepared to love and help you raise your children before you get serious. And I’m saying this because I know you’re both good parents and that you love your children, and I know you would never do anything that would put them in harm’s way, emotionally or otherwise.”
He’s splayed on his back, breathing hard and heavy, his chest rising and falling, as he gasps for air that is thick with things that will possibly and probably ruin his lungs from the inside-out. He turns onto his side, his muscles aching with the movement (he’s not made to be an adventurer like Steve is; he’s not made to do the things that Steve does, that Steve has done, saving people from burning buildings and killer Nazis and fighting villains in front of airplane rotors), and he grips the bayonet that he’d grabbed off the corpse, lifting it onto his shoulder, eyeing the Nazi that had shot at him and firing.
Grant smiles. “Good. That’s good. We belong together, Tony, we really do. I know the things have been hard with us apart these last few moons, but they will be better now, now that Natasha is gone, and you can be all mine.”
“But to them, I am,” Tony points out. “They’ll never see me as anything else. If you go over there and fight with them over it, well, that’s not going to help. They won’t stop making those comments. They’ll just think that we’re sleeping together, and the comments will get worse.”
“I don’t know what it means, and I’m not going to ask you any personal questions. It’s not my place, but…” Ms Lewis hesitates. “It does look like something’s… formed in their minds, about their family. I just thought you should know.”
One night that Steve comes home from one of his ‘conferences’, they all sit down for dinner. The children are ecstatic that Steve is home and is actually present to have a meal with them, and Tony, Tony plasters joy across his face like cement and hopes, prays, that no one realises, especially the kids.
“You’re not in any condition to drive, Tony. You’re shaking. Let me drive you, and you can pick up your car from here when you’re feeling better. You’ve had a shit day, let me help.”
Barnes’ grin spreads wide across his face, showing a row of straight, white teeth. “Then what are we waiting for?” he teases.
Agent Carter folds her arms across her chest. “Are you familiar with the art of Jiu Jitsu, wherein your opponent’s size and momentum are used against him?”
And then, Tony grudgingly pulls himself away, as he slowly starts to notice the sweat sticking uncomfortably to his skin, the come that’s dried on his thighs, even his face from the first blowjob.
The TV newscaster goes on: “Police say the victim, fifteen-year-old Virginia Potts, had quarrelled earlier with her girlfriend, Natasha Romanoff, a Russian immigrant with a history of delinquency. Romanoff is now the subject of a city-wide manhunt.”
The killer approaches him, slow, like he’s mocking him, his scalpel claws gleaming in the streetlight. Just as the knives come for him, he manages to get away, fleeing again. His stomach begins to ache, along with his chest, a burn spreading up into his throat, so he’s at a stagger rather than a full-blown run.
“Darling, it’s two in the morning, you’ve only just come home right now, and the first thing you said to me was whether I thought it was a really good idea to be drinking a single glass of wine in the dark,” Tony drawls. “Look who’s calling the kettle black over here.”
“No, they’ve gone out for date night.” Tony pauses. “Wait, did you make that noise, the fingernail one?”
Steve had been ridiculously turned on by how good of a shot Tony was (conveniently forgetting that Tony’s father made weapons for a living, and Tony was involved heavily in designing and testing them), and they’d fucked behind one of the stalls, and when they were done, he’d put the necklace around Steve’s throat.
Tony removes it the rest of the way, off his head, and does the same for Steve’s jacket and shirt, before letting his hands trail down the ridged planes of Steve’s chest, all that milk-smooth skin, before landing on the buckle of his belt. He undoes it, the clink of the metal making his cock harden in his own pants, drawing it out of the loops, and throwing it into the corner of the room. He slides his hand into Steve’s slacks, under the band of his underwear, finding his half-hard cock and wrapping his fingers around the base, stroking until it fully hardens in his grip.
“God, look at you,” Steve rasps, dragging his eyes from his hairline down to his toes, centring on the way that his cock curves against his belly, flushed and weeping, all lean, dark muscle and gleaming skin.
“You know what I mean,” Steve says, waving the spatula around. “I love you, you know that I love you, but we are combative as fuck in our relationship. We fight a lot, and it’s good because our fights are usually about stupid shit, but I guess I thought that was just
James just stares at him for a moment, unblinking, quiet. “What?” he says, after a long moment, with an unsure tongue, like he’d been expecting a fight, another slap, but not these words.
He doesn’t mention that he and Ty used to fight a lot, because those fights usually ended with Tony taking a punch to the face or the gut.
“And you fell for it,” Tony says, voice lined with disgust. “You fucking fell for it, and instead of thinking about this and acting rationally for a moment, you flew off the handle and decided to throw it in my face, demand an apology for my perceived sins against you. I don’t know why I ever thought you were different,” he muses, something vicious and defensive in his face. “I don’t know why I ever thought you were different to my father, to Ty; you’re all the same. You can fuck whomever you want, but the second, the fucking moment that you think that your lover, your husband, your wife, they’re stepping out on
“I was rich, and then, my father decided to blow all of his money on some stupid dig, and then, he died and he took my mother along with him, and then, I was broke. So, everything that you were supposedly protecting me from – poverty, homelessness, helplessness, hopelessness – all became an eventuality anyway. So, what did you save me from, exactly?”
The chase is short and pitifully unmatched. Natasha is put in handcuffs, escorted to the nearest police car. One of the police officers holds up a knife they’d clearly snatched off Natasha’s person in the air for Coulson to see.
“And this has nothing to do with the fact that the two of you are clearly in a romantic relationship?” Fury prods.
. There was no way I could’ve known that he was going to pick up the kids. Hell, when Ms Lewis told me that it was Steve, I had to actually confirm with her that it was Steve because for a second I genuinely thought that some stranger might have actually picked up the kids. But it wasn’t, and by the time I got home, Steve and the twins were already there. And you should have seen the way he looked at me,” he finishes with a bitter edge to his voice.
“One move from any of you, and I will burn this place to the ground, including that chest,” Tony threatens.
to the twins yet, and frankly, as much as it makes him a coward, he’s glad he hasn’t had the opportunity to have that conversation with them.
“Betty,” Peter chimes in. “Betty said that her parents stopped talking to each other and then, they started sleeping without each other, and then, they got a divorce. Appa, what’s a divorce?”
He crawls under the covers and settles beside Maushmi and Steve, leaving a space for Tony to take at the edge of the mattress. The bed is just big enough for all four of them, with Steve’s shoulders’ width being what it is, and he turns onto his side once he’s under the quilt, making sure that the twins are adequately tucked in.
“If something happens to them,” Tony says, quietly, his throat tightening around the words as his chest begins to burn. “If something happens to our children, Steve, if there’s even a hair out of place on their heads when we see them, I swear, above all else, I will kill myself, and I’m not joking. I’m not joking at all.”
“I’m not just a pretty face that makes killer peanut butter and jelly sandwiches; I also bring home the bacon,” Tony says, flawlessly. “Now, if you don’t mind, Caroline, I’d like to say goodbye to my children. I’m sure you have your own goodbyes to make.”
Steve sighs. “Okay. Five thousand. That’s all I can give you now. I can get you more when you land in the States.”
“Yeah, that sounds like a good idea,” he says, softly. He frowns. “It’s a little chilly outside. I can always take off–”
When Steve hands them over, the twins start foraging inside the pack and they exclaim when they finally get their hands on what they’re looking for.
slept with him, and you didn’t tell me that. You’ve been running out of here to meet this guy, so how the fuck do I know that you two haven’t rekindled whatever it is that you had before-”
He reaches forward, closing his mouth around the tendon in Steve’s throat, connecting his neck and his shoulder, setting his teeth there. Steve’s head falls onto his shoulder, and Tony can see the strands of Steve’s hair sticking to his neck, damp with sweat.
“But you look like gods,” Tony complains, throwing his arm over his eyes and keeping his gaze fixed on the ceiling.
“Why didn’t you say anything?” she asks, quietly, in the stifling, shuddering stillness of the room. “You could have, you could have
“I think you’ll find that I can and I am,” Tony says, breezily, over his shoulders, backpacks over each shoulder, one black and mint-green with dinosaurs, and another bright pink with unicorns.
that you’re here for them, that you’d do anything for them, that you’d protect them from anything. I don’t think it’s fair to pick that apart. They’ve given you no reason to.”
Tony flings a glower his way. “Considering you were partly the reason why he’s broken, I don’t think you should be talking right now.”
Yes, if someone had come to him a year ago and told him that his husband was having an affair, he would’ve thought it unbelievable, impossible as well.
,” Steve insists. “I haven’t given you many reasons to trust me, Tony, and if what I fear has happened here, you owe me nothing, but take this, take my sword, and if I judge you, if I treat you unkindly after you have told me the whole story, run
“And he started interrogating him, and I couldn’t tell him about James because I knew what he would say, and then, we got into a fight. And then, we had sex, and it wasn’t just…” he flutters his hand in the air as if trying to use his fingers to explain some of the story. “It wasn’t just sex. It was him proving a point. He was feeling jealous and he was feeling possessive and he wanted me to know that it was only him who could do that to me, make me feel that way. He got a kick out of it, seeing me like that; he’d never… he’d never done that to me, used me and what I was like in bed to make a point. I felt…”
The emotion spreads through his body like a floodgate breaking, and he feels it in his throat, a little, hopeful knot forming there, something which he doesn’t know how to quite define, and before he can do something so stupid like cry, he clears his throat and pats the bed beside him.
Pepper and Tony exchange a look, and Pepper makes her way forward, a short blade in her hands. She flattens her free hand against the door.
Again and again, he just barely manages to elude the killer, leaping from his reach by inches each time. He makes it to his street, to the high, shadowing figure of the Stark Manor, and he tears across his front law, into the open front door of the manor, slamming it with all of his might.
?” Stone sighs. “It’s really not your fault. This is who Toni is. She fucks with people, makes them think like you’re the only one in the world, but you’re not. With wealth, comes a certain understanding of how Toni is, what she’s like, how to deal with her. But you don’t have that, Steve. I’m sorry, but she’ll never love you the way you love her, because she can never love you, not really. Like loves like, and you, my man, are
“Tony, the wine I used to buy when I was a teenager and because I was trying really fucking hard to get arrested came in really dark bottles and brown paper bags from the bottle shop after I paid off some homeless guy to buy it for us. Believe me, I wouldn’t know good wine if it bit me on the ass. I leave that to you. I’ll just be glad for the buzz. Now, do we want to get an appetizer?” he murmurs, thoughtfully.
Tony carefully turns the lid to the jar, lifting it away and slipping his hands inside. His fingertips come into contact with the insulation foam, and he fishes inside until his fingers close around the slim, smooth objects, pulling them out carefully.
“Well, in that case, they’re reading at a third-grade level and way ahead of what they would normally be in kindergarten. That’s an immense accomplishment for how old they are,” Ms Lewis says, earnestly. She peers down at her log. “Well, they can answer comprehension questions; they can identify and write their numbers and count sets. They’re good with their shapes. They follow all the class rules. They listen attentively. They stay on their task; they don’t get distracted, and they can work independently. Look, I’d say they’re completely on track, even flourishing.”
Tony aches to open his mouth, to tell someone how uncomfortable this makes him, this unwanted attention by a man who should be family to him, but he has no friends here, no Rhodey, no Pepper, no one that he can trust – Natasha is there, and sometimes, when they speak about household things, he thinks she knows there is something going on, that there is something that he wants to talk about, but he’s too scared to bring it up, in case she thinks that he invited this sort of behaviour on himself, that he himself had acted improperly with his goodbrother, which led to Grant believing that he could behave this way and his attentions would be welcome.
“You think I hadn’t realised that you weren’t staying in the fucking Four Seasons everywhere you go?” Tony demands. “You do remember that I came to your place constantly back then. I knew where you lived, what your means were. I was
Tony knees him hard in the stomach; the man grunts, and Tony scrambles away, scrambles backward. The man’s hand closes around Tony’s ankle, hauling him back. Tony flips back onto his back, and the knives come down again.
Tony struggles, and Natasha is on top of him, still caked with blood, her dark auburn hair matted across her skull, her green eyes wild.
Maushmi and Jarvis disappear with the resident and the nurses, leaving him alone. While they’re gone, Tony finds the strength to get off the bed, holding his arm gingerly. He goes to the door and pulls, cursing when he finds it locked. He turns around, starting to look for another way out, when the door opens.
“Your children are young, which is good. The divorce comparison is show you exactly how this might go, if you and Steve and James decide to engage in a serious relationship with all three being equal partners. Now, in a divorce situation, parents often break the news of a relationship with someone else to their children very carefully, only after the initial stages of the relationship have passed and there is some security to that relationship. This is doubly so for children who are young, so that they don’t get attached to new people and have those people leave when the relationship falls apart.  Also because like I said, children get attached to their parents being together and they don’t like the idea of their parents being with someone else, and so when parents introduce their children to their new partner, and that relationship is secure, it cements the idea that the situation is not changing, that their parents aren’t getting back together, so they don’t start hoping for things that are likely not going to happen. From what you’ve told me, your children are already very attached to the two of you being together and they don’t like any sign of dysfunction, am I correct?”
“And you decided that you knew better than Tony on that front? That he wasn’t capable of judging the danger for himself and making according decisions?” Eshe asks, curiously.
Tony gapes at him in disbelief. His heart is fluttering in his ears, and the dark slash of his brow is drawn together.
Tony stares at him and licks his lips. “You know what’s in there,” he says, heavily. “You’ve seen the pictures, all of you.”
He pushes the boy’s head back into the table and stares straight at Tony, with a smirk curling the edge of his mouth, as he finishes, three thrusts later, letting out a low groan with his release.
Steve tells her about the kids, how impotent he’d been, how he’d managed to not do anything other than follow Tony’s lead.
“Now, look, Tony,” Coulson sounds sharper, colder, “don’t push it. You’ve already engaged in sex, drugs and violence. If you throw in insanity, who knows if your dad’s money will be able to protect you?”
“No one’s marriage is as perfect as others think,” Wanda says, solemnly, a strained quality to her face.
“I should go,” Steve says, his mouth a flat, unwavering line. “But I don’t want to. Not because I,” he sighs, “not because I’m scared or something; it’s just…” he looks at the kids, and the longing opens up in his gaze, “I’ve spent so much time away from them.”
“I’m sorry I kept the secret from you, Tony,” he says, roughly. “I’m sorry I hurt you. I’m sorry that I put you in a position where Zemo could hurt you. If I could take it back, I would. If I could do things differently, I would. I just… I love you. I want to… if you’ll let me, I want to… I want to try and fix this. I want, I want us to be happy again; I want us to be together, and if you’ll let me, I want to spend the rest of our lives proving to you that you
Tony nods. “Yeah, uh, the twins… when we fought after that night, the night where we had sex and I objected to his form of dirty talk-”
Instead, he lays a hand on her shoulder, gives her the smile that he’s been giving to the press and all of the rich, pampered, gelatinous blue bloods he comes into contact with, and says, “Thank you, Natasha. I’m so glad that I know you.”
Tony stares down at the tiny slip of paper that James had handed him that morning and looks up at the decrepit walk-up in Flatiron.
Tony flashes him the edge of a smile. “I love you too,” he says, effusive with emotion, his voice warbling, feeling something soft like cotton candy spread in his chest. “I love you too.”
“Do you accept that there are reasons why you married him and why he married you, and that those reasons have to do with your love for each other and not because of worth?”
He hears what the castle says, of course; they think that he’s lonely, that he misses Steve so much that the loss of his alpha is finally withering his body.
“No, it’s fine,” Tony tells him, giving him a half-smile that he hopes helps. “I should… I should go to the hospital and see how Wanda’s doing.”
“Yes, I do,” Abraham says, vaguely. “Besides, I did not think you would be so quick to discount him. You have a few of those problems yourself.”
James closes his eyes for a moment, as if he wants to linger in this moment, linger in the weight of their small bodies in his arms, and he knows that look, that feeling, because he’s done it half a thousand times before.
Steve had just raised one of his eyebrows and picked the guy bodily up by the collar, the muscles in his bicep flexing against his leather jacket, and by this time, Tony had raised his head from where he’d been drowning in his sorrows in tequila, intrigued, watching the alpha-male anthropological study in front of him.
“Look, I’m not saying that married couples shouldn’t keep secrets from one another. I don’t think that’s realistic at all,” Eshe tells him, her voice kind. “I think you both have kept secrets from each other, and those secrets have to do with formative parts of your life, which is where I see problems happening. The secrets about who didn’t do the dishes the last night, or who ruined the bedspread with coffee, those don’t matter. You get angry, you fight for a few minutes, and then, you move on. These ones, though, the secrets that you kept from each other – Steve, your secrets with SHIELD and Natasha and Bucky; Tony, your secrets with James and what you did at MIT – these are the ones that have the power to end relationships. These are the secrets that are so central to your existence, to your identity, your relationship, that you
And then, the passageway disappears, becoming a boiler room, the kind that you find in some old-timey ship or a decaying building that no one has any use for anymore.
, I can see you,” Toni says, fondly, pressing a swift kiss to the corner of Steve’s mouth, and then, to Bucky’s as well.
“Oh, I’ve always respected your wealth; I just don’t want to be like all the other assholes that you’ve been with, who’ve used you as a convenient ATM and made you feel like shit when they didn’t return your feelings because they were incapable of returning your feelings,” Steve declares.
you lied about, because you lied to me today about where you were going? Did you go to him? Was it a fucking booty call? Did you leave me and our kids in that café so that you could fuck some
“Says the man who’s been having it since he was fourteen. It’s easy to go without something when you’ve had a lifetime and everyone else’s lifetimes of fucking,” Steve retorts.
He makes his way into the lounge, and his pale eyes catch the gun in Steve’s hand. James goes straight for Tony, touching his shoulder with the tips of his fingers.
Eshe shakes her head. “It’s not about you fucking up,” she says, firmly. “It’s about what you do from now on. Your kids are young. They’ll grow from this, and you have the opportunity to change things, to make yourself look much, much better in their eyes.” She pauses. “Might I suggest you take some leave from SHIELD, spend some time with your family, the four of you, get to know each other again. Go on a holiday, play board games, watch movies, build memories, find your comfort zone, the four of you. You don’t know how much it will help.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, am I annoying you with all my worrying?” Tony demands, his voice rising high and thin. “Because of your
Steve pulls back with a scowl. “You know, that isn’t helping moving this night along,” he says, darkly.
“Hi,” Steve replies, softly, and then, they’re kissing, and Tony is surging up against Steve’s mouth, draping his arms around his shoulders.
“I can imagine. One of our friends died last night, and another one of our friends was arrested for her murder. The fucking dreams we’re going to have–” Steve shakes his head, scrubbing his hand over his jaw.
Tony falls onto the bed, and the knife rolls across the unmade sheets. He grapples for it, but Grant is on top of him before he can think, hands around his throat, choking him. Tony fights back as best as he can, kicking out. Grant is momentarily stunned when Tony’s foot catches him in the ribs, but he manages to climb full on top of him, knees pinning Tony’s legs down, hand over Tony’s wrists, pinning them above his head.
,” Tony says in a rush, “but I just… I don’t even want to say that I wanted something more, because I didn’t. I just wanted something
Steve just smiles, pretending like there isn’t something crumpling in his chest at the heavy weight that his wedding band leaves on his hand.
“And what purposes are those?” Tony asks, coming back to the reason why he’d come here in the first place.
me. I loved you, and I know you loved me, and I knew you would hate me for it, but I walked away because I loved you and I wanted what’s best for you. That couldn’t be me, not when your father was dangling me over your head like a fucking noose.”
They make their way towards the master bedroom, and Steve sits up in bed, when he hears their footsteps, his face shining with hope, and then, it falls, when he sees Tony holding onto their children. And then, in the span of a second, his face warps into an expression of cheer.
Tony can hear the thready, faltering beat of his pulse in his ears when he says, “your brother raped me, and this is not the first time he has raped me.”
Finally, it’s too much for Steve to bear, and he bats Tony’s hand away, leaning down to mouth at Tony’s cock himself. Tony moans and lets his head tip back, hand working its way into Steve’s hair for purchase, unable to keep the lust off his face, flushed and panting and writhing. First, there’s a little sigh of air over the length of his cock, nuzzling at the join of his thigh, just shy of his cock, and then, Steve licks at the head, where the pre-come is beading vociferously, tasting the earthiness.
It takes a moment, and then, the expression of joy contorts into one of agony, and the Nazi starts screaming, a terrible sound that makes Tony cringe, and he tries to shake the red-hot medallion from his skin.
Steve’s hand cracks down on his ass, and Tony yelps, tightening up around him almost instinctively, and Steve groans in response, with dirty little grinds like he’s trying to prolong everything so when he comes, it’ll be magnificent.
“I just thought… the kids already met you; the only one who hadn’t was Steve, and if I told him, told him everything, he could lay off with those stupid fucking judgy eyes of his.”
There’s a bright laugh coming from the gaggle of omegas, who pass them by, fluttering their eyelashes at Howard, and Howard shifts, the rage bleeding out of him in an instant.
“Her name’s Natasha. I’ve met her a couple of times. She’s the receptionist at the insurance company,” Tony explains. “She’s beautiful,” he feels the need to say, “she has red hair, brighter than yours, and she’s… she’s very pretty,” he finishes, lamely.
Steve groans as he sinks into Tony, inch by inch, and it doesn’t feel the way it did during Tony’s heat, that all-encompassing fever being soothed by Steve’s cock; it feels clearer, with Tony fully aware of everything, the sensation of being split open and filled.
“And their performance? It’s on track, they’re doing their best? Do they need any extra help in any area?”
He grabs a tea towel out of the drawer, finds the first aid kit under the sink, and runs the towel under the water.
Steve smiles when he sees Tony coming towards him, but he straightens, directing a look of solemnity towards Phillips.
“I came back,” James agrees. “A couple of months ago, the HYDRA guys that were on my tail cornered me in Bucharest, the same guys that HYDRA that I was trying to protect Tony from, and they saw a photo.”
A guard exists, pushing a card of food trays. Tony and Steve wait until he’s gone, before they look at Natasha, who looks a lot duller than she did this morning, her red hair pulled back away from her face in a braid, her face devoid of any make-up, her eyes having lost their shine.
Between Bucky and Steve, they gather up the body on the floor, and Natasha wanders into the side room where Tony is hiding. She remains silent, as she helps him to his feet.
Tony has the sudden urge to throttle him. “You don’t know anything about him,” he hisses. “You don’t… you have no fucking clue.”
The rage burns through him hot and fast, as he imagines his own children, his sweet, kind babies, who like Dora the Explorer, at the hand of someone like the man that James had killed the first night that they met.
“That won’t happen,” James says, savagely. “He won’t come near you or near your kids. I won’t let him.”
He turns on his side, and Steve hums, eyes still shut, dragging him in closer. Steve buries his face in Tony’s shoulder, a puff of air exhaling against his skin.
“Won’t you, won’t you love that baby more than you love me?” Peter asks, blinking up at him, and there’s a sheen to his eyes.
Steve’s brow furrows. “But you’ve been with so many people-” he stumbles over his words, turning bright red. “Shit, I didn’t mean to imply that-”
“To your left, the bathroom is three doors down,” Tony explains and gets to cleaning up the mess on his kitchen counter, while James is gone.
James lifts an eyebrow. “So, the guy that leaves the house at six in the morning, doesn’t come home until midnight, goes on company retreats and conferences constantly and leaves you alone with two little kids doesn’t like that you weren’t at home one fucking afternoon to wait on him hand and foot?” he demands.
“Lovely,” Steve sighs. “You’re so good for me, Tony. You’re such a good boy.” He leans down and presses his mouth to Tony’s, sliding his tongue inside his mouth. “I think…” he says, thoughtfully, mulling each option over carefully. “I think I’m gonna fuck you.”
Steve pads his way over to him, naked and rippling with muscle, and Tony forces himself to not drag his eyes lower than Steve’s throat. Steve’s big hands cup the spurs of his hips, and Tony doesn’t fight him off, doesn’t bat his hands away, something inside him squirming, hungry, wanting. There’s a part of him that wants to let his head fall forward, knocking against Steve’s chest, and feel that indomitable grasp of his arms around Tony, the two of them fitting neatly against each other like the most perfect puzzle pieces.
“No, asking an omega to dance always seemed terrifying, and the past few years, didn’t seem to matter too much. Figured I’d wait.”
It’s past midnight, with Tony watching an episode of Tiny Pretty Things on his laptop. He yawns, and then, shakes himself violently. He sits up straighter, forcing himself to concentrate on the show.
