John stretches out his left hand, fingers gently curled toward his palm. His eyes never leave Sherlock’s face. Sherlock spreads the lube over three fingers, drops the packet next to him on the bed. He grips John’s wrist and lowers his hand between his thighs. John exhales heavily, strokes the crease of Sherlock’s arse with two fingers.
Harry’s gone and John’s asleep when he gets back to the hospital. There's a note scrawled on a brown canteen napkin taped to the door with a plaster.
I should tell you. I should talk to you. But this,having you coiled around me like this, soft and sleep-drunk and
“You realise it’s probably a disgruntled tourist or a deer poacher or something terrifically mundane? I know that genius brain is clicking through brilliantly violent and bloody scenarios already, but it’s likely nothing at all interesting.”
“My parents are Muggles, so Apparition isn’t really an issue for family travel,” Sherlock says dryly, wondering when exactly it was that he’d invited Molly to have coffee with him.
would notice. You can tell if someone’s committed a murder by the colour of their trainers, for godssake,” John’s voice rises, agitated. He’s chewing the inside of his lip hard enough to break skin. His eyes flick up to Sherlock’s, black rimmed with indigo, rough as a storm tossed ocean. “But. You never saw
“More or less.” John pauses as he contemplates which angle is best to begin his attack on the camera. “Alright, now listen. Malvo is a sneaky fuck. He’s got a face like tinned corned beef, ugly as all hell, you’d think people would remember him...but somehow. Somehow he manages to fade, to fit in. He’s in London, just waiting for his fucking moment. And he’s coming for me. I’m not giving up this thing, this
“You said you’d behave.” Sherlock murmured against his lips as John arched his hips up as much as he was able.
One sore eyelid at a time, John pries his eyes open, and immediately squints against the glare. It’s much brighter than it should be. Their bedroom is always a lovely cosy yellow, the curtains drawn, Sherlock’s bedside lamp tumbling warm homey light through the small space.
When Harry had gone to throw their wrappers away in the hallway bin, John clasped Sherlock's hand urgently.
that I couldn’t let you go, but. I think in the end, it was the only thing I could hang on to and remember I had something good once.”
,” Sherlock murmurs into his sweat damp hair, apparently incapable of saying anything else. He grazes his teeth along the ridge of John’s scapula, darts his tongue out to taste his salty skin.
"Then you tell me. Because you always have the fucking answers." Every nerve in his body is sparking. He can't stop shaking. He will not hit Sherlock, as much as he wants to. He hit him twice in anger, and he swore he would never again do that.  His muscles are twitching for it, though. To pound his fists, to push and twist and hurt. "Because you're so much fucking smarter than I am. Right? You're the clever one. You tell me what this is about, because I swear to God, Sherlock, I have no fucking clue what's happening between us right now. I really don't."
“I was thinking, this morning, before you were awake. About when we met.” John finds Sherlock’s hand on his belly, twines their fingers together.
John's tongue darted out and he pulled on his lower lip with his teeth, his eyes dancing with amusement. "I'm not even going to bother asking why."
"Sherlock. Did you - ? You brought my clothes out of your bedroom." John pulled a towel over his hair, averted his eyes as Sherlock kicked off his wet trousers.
"Yes, I'm coming." John opens the door. Sherlock's standing there, his eyes dark in the dim hallway light, his hair haloed around his head the way it gets when he's had his fingers in it too much, a slight stain of red wine on his lips. He looks beautiful. The words are out of John's mouth before he can stop them. "You look lovely. Oh. I'm sorry. I probably shouldn't have. Not yet."
"Sherlock. Get out." Jim lifts the remote and lazily changes the channel, not even bothering to glance in Sherlock's direction.
laugh, which is good and comforting, and the feeling that she’s intruding slowly disintegrates in the crisp autumn night.
Thus, the amount of petroleum jelly we went through in a month’s time was high enough to raise eyebrows, should it become known. We were careful to shop at different chemists each time, and I often used one of my many disguises in order to not be recognised. John particularly liked the times when I had dressed up as a young lady, bodice, stockings, and the whole kit; his hands sneaking indelicately up my skirts in the cab on the way home, his face pressing against my powdered throat as he whispered
John swallowed and tilted his head, looking at her with what he knew was a predatory smile. She actually blushed. Well, he was still attractive on the outside, even if the inside was desiccated and foul. “I’m not interested in girls.”
“I wanted you - before, you know - before everything, I wanted you. I thought I couldn’t ever want anyone more than I wanted you back then - god, you fucking tormented me. With those tight shirts and your perfectly tailored trousers. That round little arse just begging to be smacked.” John slaps Sherlock’s hip, and looks at Sherlock like he’s something edible. His eyes are deep indigo blue - waves crashing, summer thunderstorms - beautiful and dangerous. “But
“Okay.” John rubs a thumb over the hard bump of Sherlock’s sacrum and sighs, drowsy and contented. Sherlock says he always falls asleep after sex, and that’s true. The rush of dopamine is as powerful as a narcotic. He just can’t stay awake.
He twirls another cigarette between his fingers but doesn't light it. It's going on three now. In five hours they'll be at Diogenes with Mycroft, and reality will intrude on these last few days of relative happiness. Yesterday was both exhilarating and exhausting. Today will be more of latter and not much of the former. The briefing with Mycroft will probably last hours. It’s likely they’ll end up having to eat lunch at the Diogenes and continue through the afternoon. Mycroft will grill John like he’s a suspect. It’s going to be arduous, and Sherlock will have very little say in how it goes. John will
“That goes for you as well, John. Part of what I like, what makes me submissive to you, is that you come first. What you need. What you want. So if what you want is to not be dominant, if what you want is for me to take control and let you rest for a bit, I want to give that to you. Even if it's difficult for me sometimes.” Sherlock kissed him, just a sweet sleepy press of lips.
Sherlock nuzzled into the nape of John's neck, mouthed at his hairline. "I want to see sheep. Let's rent a cottage out in the middle of nowhere."
Boys in sweaty rugby gear are leaving the park in packs, balls tucked under their arms, laughing and pushing each other. Mother with small children are wrestling them into prams, looking weary and worn down. No one looks at Sherlock, skinny, bedraggled, tight dirty tee shirt and raccoon eyes. He’s invisible. Everyone’s headed home, warm lights, fireplaces crackling in sitting rooms lined with bookshelves. Mycroft, light the fire, will you? Sherlock’s chilly.  Nope. Won’t think of home, of them. Delete it.
Sherlock licked up to the head with a wide flat tongue, flicked at the slit and tasted salt and bitterness. John was dehydrated from all the drinking, his come would be thick and pungent. Sherlock shuddered at the thought. John’s come on his tongue was a treasure, however strong and bitter it was.
"Oh god, okay, yeah," John says, restless, rubbing his hips in little circles while the tension pulls his bollocks up tight to his body and he has to remember how to talk without any air in his lungs. "I was on Sarah's sofa and I kept - kept thinking of you on
Ministry, then. Has to be. Mycroft’s asked Sherlock to assist him on Ministry business before - unofficially, of course - but it’s never been anything urgent. Never been anything Mycroft couldn’t have worked out on his own if he’d chosen to. This feels...different.
"I won't. I won't come, I promise." Sherlock snivels, stilling the roll of his hips and sobbing quietly as John runs his hands all over Sherlock's  reddened skin.
“You’re devastatingly charming, you know that? You ridiculous creature.” John swoops down and places a kiss between Sherlock’s raised eyebrows. "You know that's a compliment, sweetheart."
“I only have a thirty minute break,” He pants, slipping a hand past Sherlock’s cheek and caresses down his own flat stomach, palms himself through his shorts. He pushes up into his own grasp with a sharp grunt, and it's the goddamned sexiest thing Sherlock's ever seen.
John just gazes at him with lust-drenched eyes, tucking himself clumsily back into his jeans, and Sherlock can't stop staring at him. It must actually possible to love someone too much, because he loves John so much he knows he'll never really be able to be angry at him for more than a passing moment. He rolls his eyes in surrender and yanks his jeans back up.
He woke up to Sherlock gently washing the cut on his arm with disinfectant soap. Sherlock looked up and saw him awake, smiled that disarming grin that made his eyes sparkle. “Hello again.”
Sherlock rocks up on his knees as well as he can with his arms bound, moans and pushes his arse back. John gives him a hard slap across his left cheek, leaving a deep pink handprint and making Sherlock whimper and close his eyes. "Don't be greedy. You'll get fucked good and hard soon enough. And I told you to keep your eyes open."
, given enough time. He will earn the right to John’s love, starting today, by getting this monster out of their lives for good.
Sherlock realises he doesn’t mean the money, not really. He means where they’re going together, what’s happening between them. It’s about Sherlock not sleeping with anyone for money anymore. It’s about them being a team, just the two of them against the world. It’s about
“Oh. Um. Yes.” Sherlock finally steps over the threshold and makes to hoist his trunk up to the rack. It hits the lip of the shelf and he fumbles it, nearly knocking himself in the teeth with the metal corner. Alchemy’s claws scrabble at his shoulder blades.
“I will, I will, shhhh. Put your hands in my hair.” John moves down Sherlock’s body again, helpless against the urge to kiss every stretch of soft white skin he can reach. Sherlock’s fingers flex and tighten against his scalp as John’s mouth falls on him again and again, his own desire building within him, making his chest grow tight and his breathing ragged.
John had been growing it for about two weeks. It was raggedy and scratchy. He fussed with it all the time, rubbing his hand over his face and digging at his cheeks. He seemed determined to keep it, though, and never complained about it itching, even though Sherlock could see it was driving him mental.
delectable about John grumpy and sleep-drunk. Sherlock wriggled up beside him and tossed a leg over the backs of John's thighs, snaked a hand into the back of his shirt. "John. Mmmm. Please. You don't have to be completely awake, you know..."
“It was perfect. It was -- it was perfect, Sherlock.” John needed more. He needed Sherlock close to him. “I don’t want to talk anymore tonight. Everything fucking hurts, and I’m on morphine, I can barely fucking think. Just, can you?”
Sherlock shook his head and let his eyes fall shut. He pushed his nose into the crease of John’s groin and drew in a long breath. John’s hand fell roughly into his hair, fingers twining around tangled curls.
John doesn't even think of arguing, instead just gasps out a quiet whimper of concession. He's already hard, shivering against Sherlock's hand pressed between his shoulder blades. He nods against the rough bricks and Sherlock grunts in acknowledgement. Then Sherlock's deft fingers are at his flies, while with the other hand, he twists John's arms together at the small of his back. Low and dangerous, Sherlock's voice growls in his ear. "Don't make one sound. Not one." John bites into his tongue to keep from moaning, his breath shuddering loudly through his nostrils. His arms ache, but this is new and just this side of frightening, and he dares not say anything.
“I’m sorry.” John doesn’t probe any further, but sets the barrette down gently on top of the papers and hands the box back to Sherlock with gentle hands. “I didn’t mean to pry.”
John laughed ruefully, and Sherlock felt it reverberating through his hands, pressed tight against John’s jaw. “You’ve no idea how true that is, Sherlock.”
John sits down at the kitchen table across from Sherlock with his own sandwich, slathered in mayonnaise, and pushes a tumbler of ice water at Sherlock. “You’re dehydrated, Sherlock. Drink the water.”
“I don’t want to hear her name in our bed.” Sherlock says fiercely, his fingers stopping their lazy stroking.
Now he was upside down on the couch, his long feet resting against the evidence wall, dressing gown floating round his ears, thinking to test how long one could stand on one's head without passing out.
Now. Now, it couldn't be anyone but Sherlock. John’s as far from a blushing virgin as it’s possible to get. He’s not bothered keeping track of his conquests, but the number is high enough to teeter on the edge between prideful and embarrassing. But never, never in all his life has he been with anyone who affects him the way Sherlock does. He shines like a white winter moon, glittering and blindingly bright. He takes up John’s whole horizon. There’s no one else, there could never again be anyone else.
“I’m not trying to save you.” John looks down at the sheets, plucks at his hospital gown. “I love you. It’s not the same.”
“Baby, does it hurt?” John wasn’t sure whether he wanted Sherlock to say yes or no. All he knew was he was clinging to some vestige of control, his skin shivering with desire, and he could barely contain the need to run his tongue along the edge of that cut, feel Sherlock’s skin split open in his mouth.
John’s shaking, his whole body quivering. Sherlock presses his closed lips to John’s, whisperingly soft, and John sighs, pushes his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and grips his head between his hands. Sherlock kisses him again, just slightly harder, pulls John’s lower lip between his own and sucks tenderly. He leans back, runs his fingers over John’s brow and down the side of his face, John’s eyes fixed on him.
Sherlock jerks the door open harshly as he’s still zipping his jeans, and skids into the sitting room. Lestrade and John are standing in the doorway, and behind Lestrade is -
John gets the hint, scrambles back to kneel between Sherlock's legs and tear the box of condoms open. His need is urgent and close now, John's blood coursing through him lava hot, the most primal part of his brain and body taking over.
, Sherlock.” John smiles, shifts and rolls so he can tuck his knee between Sherlock’s thighs and nibbles at Sherlock’s lower lip. Sherlock sighs and sinks into him, his hand petting gently between John’s shoulder blades.
“I’ve got you.” John wraps his right arm around Sherlock’s side and pulls him close, whispering brokenly against the nape of his neck, “I’ve always got you, love. I’ve got you.”
Before he can react, Sherlock whirls and backs him up against the stairway wall, capturing his mouth in a ravenous kiss. John arches up into it, twining his hand into Sherlock’s hair, and they’re biting at each other’s mouths, the tension from the cab ride breaking over them in this brutal crush of teeth and tongues. Sherlock yanks John’s jacket over his shoulders, pinning his arms to his sides for just long enough for John to register that he rather likes his arms restrained while Sherlock’s licking frantically at his throat, and then Sherlock shuffles back and pulls and the jacket crumples to the floor at their feet.
This one, though, has a presence. He has stature, if not height. He looks every single person in the eye, even when their exploring fingers are wiggling against his hipbones, hands unabashedly cupping his taut arse as he slips away to move onto the next group. Fit, but not overly muscled, his body looks solid in a way that reminds Sherlock of a spring loaded pistol - carefully contained energy ready to unleash itself at the slightest application of pressure.
“We’re always in trouble. That we know how to deal with. We’ll sort it out.” Sherlock kissed his temple and John pressed into him, seeking more. More comfort, more Sherlock, more confirmation that he wasn’t a figment of morphine and a concussion.
Sherlock nods, his eyes glittering black in the late evening shadows. “More than okay. I know what we need to do to draw Malvo out. I know what we need to do, John.”
John nudges Sherlock's face with his nose. "I'll be right back, okay? I'm going to start us a shower."
John throws the window open and a burst of icy air soars into the kitchen and nearly puts the burner out under the kettle. "Let's smoke. Come on."
John slides his hand up and out from under the blankets, fingers splayed and palm raised, and Sherlock grasps it tightly. John’s hand is calloused in places - his thumb, the tip of his middle finger - but his palm is soft and hot, a bit damp from the warmth of the heavy blankets. Sherlock rubs at his knuckles, feeling the tiny bones moving under his touch, and tries to breathe in this moment. He wants to remember every second of this, every gasp, the feel of John’s body on top of his, the smell of their sweat. He shuts his eyes and lets his consciousness spread, casting round in his memory for a space in which to keep this.
“Fuck yes,” John grits out, his upper lip curled almost in a snarl, and pushes Sherlock hard up against the nearest wall, his muscular thigh insinuating between both of Sherlock’s and nudging at his balls. Sherlock jerks and curls forward, gasping at the sudden rush of pleasure coursing through him. John flexes his leg, grinds his hips against Sherlock's, and licks a stripe up the side of his neck.
John slides his fingers out of Sherlock’s mouth, and Sherlock lays his face against the warm plane of John's belly, too overcome to do much except lean against him and pant. His hand is still between John's hot trembling thighs, his index finger pressed between his arse cheeks. He wiggles his finger experimentally and John breathes out raggedly, smoothes his hand over Sherlock's sticky face.
Unaccountably irritated by the utter lack of reception by the two I cherished most in this world, I dropped my bags at the bottom of the staircase and stomped up them rather loudly enough to wake anyone who might be home.
. He thinks about it for a scant moment, discovering to his shock that he actually very much wants to. Not for the sodding Quidditch of course, but the chance to see John again, maybe to talk to him like a normal person.
Things had recently changed, though, and John wasn’t entirely sure where the lines in this relationship were now, or if there even were any anymore. In the beginning, there’d been no formal agreements, just them being them, mostly as they’d always been, with the addition of sex and snuggling and over-the-breakfast-table forehead kisses that made Mrs Hudson giggle delightedly and clasp her hands over her mouth.
“Greg hasn’t rung.” John says carefully as Sherlock drags the end of the blanket inside and shuts the window behind him. John is so
“Thanks, Sherlock.” Her voice is softer than usual as she reaches down and puts her hand on his hair, just briefly. “I’ll see you round.”
Sherlock curls over him, licks his lips, bites John's jaw and rubs his arse up and down along John's cock like he's a rutting animal, and John has trouble remembering how breathing works, then Sherlock says in a ragged hush, "This feels so good, John, so good. Put your fingers in me now, or I'll have to do it for you."
How could Sherlock have survived? John watched him jump, followed with terrified disbelieving eyes as his body fell. True, he hadn’t seen the actual impact, but he’d seen him just seconds later, blood and brain matter everywhere. He’d taken his fucking pulse. He didn’t have one.
“Here. Let me.” John murmurs gently. He pushes Sherlock’s fingers away from his buttons and begins undoing them one by one, without even looking. His eyes roam over Sherlock’s face, a crooked smile just barely visible under his moustache.
“Oh. We were in Whitechapel, tailing that suspect in the Sussex case. And he shot at us, remember? You went after him, and I - I wasn’t - you told me to wait - not that it was your fault, I’m not saying that - I just. He hit you. With his gun. You’ve got a concussion, perhaps a skull fracture. They’ve not done the CT scan yet. You don’t remember any of that, John?” Sherlock’s thumbs are rubbing comforting little circles against the insides of John’s wrist, pressing into the heel of his hand, rhythmic and instinctive.
Something about voicing it. Though they'd both known it, something shifts between them, saying it aloud. A promise, more concrete than what they've already said, even though it's three words as meaningless as any others, there's a weight attached to these. They stare at each other a moment, John holding Sherlock in his eyes
This morning felt different. Different in its normalcy. They were comfortable and warm against each other and John was making lovely throaty noises that meant he wasn’t getting out of bed any time soon. This moment of opportunity couldn’t be missed. Head swimming in a rushing tide of hormones, he opened his mouth against John’s throat and kissed him softly, dragging his lips along the line of his tendon. John squirmed and made an assenting noise, bent one leg up and let it fall against Sherlock’s hipbone.
Everyone else from the stadium is walking in one big group, a gaggle of cloaks and broomsticks, laughter and chatter ringing out across the grounds. They turn toward the long stone stairway built into the side of the hill, and Sherlock makes to follow. But John keeps walking straight, away from the rest of the crowd, and Sherlock has to swerve to catch up with him.
.” John’s fingers slid into him as he took the head of Sherlock’s cock between his hot swollen lips. Sherlock arched and cried out, grasping at the strong curve of John’s shoulder as his fingers brushed against Sherlock’s prostate with practiced expertise, exerting gentle but steady pressure against the nub of pure sensation. He pulled off, licked across the slit and circled the glans with the tensed tip of his tongue. "God, I love how you taste, how you feel inside. So soft. Is it good when I touch you there, sweetheart?"
Oh, I guess there’s the obvious things. The coat and the violin and the phone. But those are the things everyone sees. Anyone could say those remind them of you. This is about
John slowly comes back to himself, his limbs heavy, the adrenaline dissipating, and he realises they’re in an alley with their cocks out, after having some spectacularly loud sex. This is a recipe for disaster, and possibly arrest. “Sherlock, we need to pull up our fucking trousers and go home. Right now.”
The only reason Sherlock hadn't openly contacted him is because he was still outside the distinctly long arm of Mycroft's influence, and both he and John would be almost immediately targeted if they had traceable contact.
John reached down and hiked Sherlock’s leg higher on his waist, the tartan bunching between his bent knee and John’s overheated skin. He licked at Sherlock’s Adam’s apple and his breath hitched. “Beautiful. You’re beautiful.”
“Brilliant. Still need your contact information.” Ginger’s radio crackled to life, the voice indecipherable to Sherlock. He held up one finger to them as he listened.
It was about six weeks into John’s beard experiment. The gaps and sparse patches had been filled in, and it was much darker than at the start. A deep auburn red in the thickest places, thinning to gingery light brown on John’s cheekbones and Adam’s apple. John washed it with his shampoo, which smelled of Irish moss and heather, and the thicker beard hairs held the scent longer and more strongly than the hair on his head. Sherlock liked rubbing the tip of his nose in it and breathing deep, which elicited one of three reactions from John. 1. If John was blogging, reading, or trying to sleep, he would push Sherlock’s head away in mild irritation. 2. If he was in a foul mood, or if Sherlock didn't stop the first time he asked, he would threaten to shave it off if Sherlock didn’t stop sniffing at him like a stray dog. 3. If he was in a good mood, he would turn his head and slip his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth, push him backwards on the sofa, and snog him breathless, letting Sherlock run his tongue all over the beard and laughing,
“I do. I’ve always known them. Even before - everything. Now it's elevated, it's enhanced by this, what we do. You tell me I've got you, and I believe it. I don't have to do anything. I can just be, and I know you I know you've got me, always." Sherlock breathes out in a rush.
you’ve had a proper meal and some more sleep. I swear, I don’t know how anyone gets well in hospital, with that wretched food and nurses coming in at all hours to wake you, prod at you with everything under the sun. It’s absurd -”
wrong? I've tried to make you feel at home here, to make you as happy here as you had been with Mary, before..."
John shook his head, and Sherlock could see the ripple of tension travel up the back of his neck. He was always on alert, always ready to be offended on their behalf. He loathed the assumptions people made, and he’d gotten into more than one verbal altercation with complete strangers.
, Sherlock, yes. Come here.” John swoops down, bracing himself on the back of the chair with his right hand and cupping his left alongside Sherlock’s jaw. He doesn’t have words at his disposal the way Sherlock does, he can’t say these agonisingly beautiful things. All he can do is
“Oh god, oh god, oh god,” John’s voice rises, quickening, as he goes shakingly tense and clenches down hard all around Sherlock.
"That's as modest as you get, isn't it?" John's hands skim down Sherlock's arm, fingers tracing fading track marks and sinewy veins. Even in the pulsing dim light, Sherlock sees the softness illuminating John's eyes. He leans forward and presses his lips achingly gently to the crook of Sherlock's elbow.
John sits up and tilts his head back obediently, his eyes watching the lazy movement of a single cobweb in the corner of the shower stall. Sherlock begins pouring water over his hair.
"I'm not the one throwing mugs and having a bloody temper tantrum, Sherlock." They've never been this angry at each other. The realisation settles in John's stomach like a boulder, immoveable. Is this it? The moment that breaks them?
John reached down between us with his left hand and curled his hand lightly around my cock, stroking just enough to tease, his right hand pushing at my hip to rock me slowly back and forth. I braced my hands against his strong shoulders, digging my fingertips into the tendons as he guided me to ride him how he liked it best. I began a rhythm of my own, rubbing the wet heads of our cocks together and dropping my gaze to watch our bodies moving, the sight of us pressed together tip to bollocks sending a thudding pulse of pleasure through me. I shook with it, my shoulders rounding, stomach contracting.
The smell of Sherlock is intoxicatingly good, good enough to send a little thrill of desire singing up John’s spine and he’s suddenly aware of how long it’s been since they’ve made love. He’s been in hospital three days, and the two days before that were nothing but cold coffee and piles of evidence photos and paperwork at Scotland Yard, takeaway at midnight and John falling asleep sitting up in his chair.
"I think I would too. Tramp around in the heather with you. My rugged Scotsman." Sherlock squeezed John's shoulder, trying to be comforting.
John slides his mouth along Sherlock's jaw, feeling weightless and helpless as Sherlock's tongue curls around his own.
"Yes, you should have.” John's thumb passes over the helix of Sherlock's ear, silky smooth and cool from being outside.
"I love you, too." Sherlock pulls John's face to his, rubbing his open mouth over John's, running his hands down over the taut muscles of John's torso. Yes. Just one last time. Before everything could go horribly wrong.
. Tight must be a good thing, a very good thing, judging from John’s rumbling groans, the way his breath trembles and catches, the hunger of his kisses. John rubs his thumbs in circles at the back of Sherlock’s scalp, mouth roaming messily across Sherlock’s shoulders and throat. Sherlock tries to reciprocate through a cloud of desire, turning his head and kissing at John’s hair, pressing his fingertips into John’s neck and running them down his spine.
“Alright.” John sucks in a breath and closes his eyes. “Can I ask you something first? Since you read the journal, and you already have an idea about how I feel?”
“No.” Sherlock huffs a laugh, despite the gravity of the moment. He imagines the look on Molly’s face if someone suggested they were dating; she’d laugh and punch his arm.
They come at the same time, Sherlock’s body completely given over to it, his eyes rolling back as he keens and twists against the pillows. His arse muscles contract around John’s cock, and he can feel - god he can actually
"Tell me. Tell me what you wanted me to do that night." There's a perfect dark brown freckle under Sherlock's Adam's apple. John always liked to watch it move when Sherlock talked, could never keep his eyes from drifting down over Sherlock's mouth, down to his neck. He puts his mouth over it and licks.
"Are you hungry?" John turns those eyes on Sherlock, bright and Mediterranean blue in the morning light. They're devastating.
Tommy started singing some bawdy rugby song that John vaguely remembered the lyrics to, and he fumblingly joined in as everyone raised their glasses. He reached for another pint, untouched in the middle of the table, and took a long sip. He was going to
"Nope, you're more than tipsy. You never call me husband unless you're drunk or sick." John tightened his arm around Sherlock's chest. "I love it, you know."
Sherlock clawed, trying to anchor himself, trying to find something to hold on to, his head spun so wide open with pleasure that it was like flying, like falling. He found the nape of John’s neck, dug his fingers in, feeling the thick muscles undulating under his hands, and he held on. John found one of his hands and pulled it away from his neck, pinned it above his head and interlaced their fingers. “I’ve got you, love.
That was nearly three years ago now, and the affections that overtook us that night had grown ever stronger, the bonds between us both tender and unbreakable. I could not imagine a world in which John Watson was not forever at my side. But we had made no promises to each other, exchanged no vows - though we could obviously never do so publicly, I knew other men in our situation had exchanged private vows. We had not done so, nor even discussed the possibility of it.
Even in the middle of their urgency, the air between them throbbing with want, Sherlock smiles softly, his cheeks going round and dimpled, eyes half closed, and runs his hands over John's trembling stomach, his ribs, slow and lingering over his nipples, and murmurs, "You.
Sherlock's fingers unfurl over John's hips, his hands so large they wrap easily around John's narrow frame. He fiddles with the edge of his jumper, pushes a thumb inside, against a patch of smooth bare skin. He looks up at John, eyes luminous and dark, his nose pink at the tip from the wool.
"Yes, I know, I know. Please go on. Please. Hit me, please. Please, I want it." Sherlock's blubbering, begging. The sound of it is magnificent, stoking the fire of need in John's lower belly, his cock twitching. He resists the instinct to touch himself, instead lands a harder blow than before on the curve where back meets hip, and Sherlock sobs louder, grinds his cock into the bed and grabs desperately at the sheets.
They’re both silent as Sherlock opens the door, perhaps both overwhelmed with everything that’s happened today. Sherlock’s back is to John as he hangs his coat on the rack beside the door. He looks stiff, the line of his shoulders tight.
“Okay. Alright.” Sherlock closes his eyes and scratches at John’s scalp with his fingernails. “You have me. You
"No-no. It's so good. I feel like...it's like I'm floating. I've never felt like this...Please don't stop."
John has already passed the point of no return. Just say it. "Sherlock. If you had left me again, I would never have survived it."
He lit the cigarette and pulled hard at the filter, bent down and poked his head in the window of one of the cabs. “You in service?”
“Shhhhh. I’ve got you. I just - I want to - “ John’s eyes are half closed as he shimmies down, his mouth open against Sherlock’s collarbone, tonguing at his nipples. Sherlock’s fingers slide through his hair, tug on it just the slightest bit and John answers with a satisfyingly deep groan. He pushes the heel of his hand against the soft fleshy part of Sherlock’s thigh, “Open your legs, there we go. Oh, god, you are
“Oh, shit, I forgot the bread.” Sherlock breaks in, squeezing John’s fingers briefly before leaving the table and retrieving a loaf of bread from the oven. “Not homemade, I’m afraid. Just frozen garlic bread.”
"Not even a chance. I'm sorry for Mike though. There." John's second boot fell to the floor with a thump, and Sherlock absently rubbed the arch of John's socked foot with his thumb.
“Not last time I was here. It’s a family home, been owned by a MacDougal since, god I don’t even know when. Sixteenth century or so, I’d guess.” John scratched at his eyebrow and grimaced as they entered the house. “Smells like blood.”
Slowly John crawls his fingers over Sherlock's hand resting on his thigh, threading all four of his stubby fingers in between Sherlock's long ones.
Sherlock sniffles and nods, reaches up tentatively to touch John's face. John allows him a moment of gentle kisses as Sherlock plays with the short hairs around John's ears. He nudges at Sherlock's nose with his own and sits up. "Give me your hands again."
John’s tears finally slowed, and he breathed shakily into Sherlock’s now wet shirt. Sherlock curled a hand into John’s hair, his wrist at an odd angle, but he didn’t care.
The taste of it, earthy and plain, just this side of too salty, reminds him of home. He hasn't tasted anything like this since the last night he spent at his mother's table. They had beef and mashed potatoes, and Sherlock ate barely two bites. He had been high, trying to hide it. His father told him to eat or it would upset his mother, Sherlock threw a plate, and it all ended in a spectacular row. He hasn't seen them since.
“Honestly, I just don’t believe it.” It shouldn’t mean this much to him. It’s just a hunk of metal, made to hurt, made for killing. But somehow, everything that was John Watson is embedded in its scarred surface. The army doctor, the soldier, the muscle in the operation, Sherlock’s protector - everything that made him who he used to be, it’s right here, heavy in his palm.
Downy blonde hair over his sternum, barely anywhere else. Tight hard stomach, but no six pack, no evidence of more working out than just running round a rugby pitch. His navel a perfect nubby whorl. Sherlock licks into it, and John arches sharply off the bed, moans deep. Sherlock grins wolfishly against his belly, rubs his mouth and nose zigzag across John’s skin, down to the edge of his jeans, grabs the waistband with his teeth.
"I don't want to talk about her." John kisses Sherlock's hair. "You were dead and I was lonely. That's all. It's always been you, love. Since the second I walked into that lab. Always."
“Why didn’t you ever - “ Sherlock bites into his throat, the rest of his sentence muted by John’s skin between his teeth.
“I know, John,” Sherlock breathes out, too honest. It feels like an admission of guilt, and he doesn’t know why.
Finally Sherlock pulls back with tingling lips and looks at John, sloe eyed and stubble burned, his mouth chapped and swollen from sucking Sherlock off, from kissing for twenty minutes solid. He’s absolutely gorgeous, the most beautiful thing Sherlock’s ever seen or will ever see, and he belongs to Sherlock. Sherlock belongs to him.
“Hmmm.” John sounds content. He pulls back and smiles at Sherlock. His cheeks are very pink. “You stayed here with me. The whole time."
“Three,” he chokes out, his open mouth rubbing all over John’s lips, John’s cheeks, John’s jaw, as he jerks John off in the scant space between their bodies, his forearm cramping over top of John’s forearm between his legs. They’re all tangled up, just how they’re meant to be.
"You aren't, you little liar." John says fondly, tucking his chin over Sherlock's shoulder and peering at the screen. "You were at that same page when I fell asleep."
. You take my breath away.” It’s the wine, probably, loosening his tongue, allowing these frighteningly honest words to spill from his lips. Or maybe it’s just that now, having heard the infinite depths of Sherlock’s love for him, he can voice these vague insecurities he’s always had, because he knows there’s no reason for them anymore. He can let go of them now.
Winter sunlight drifts down through the part in the curtains, wavering and cool, caressing the back of John's golden hair with silver. The radiator under the window has been broken for a week now, never shuts off, making the bedroom July hot. The windows are cracked just enough to let a thin stream of cool air in, but the panes are steamy, the heat of the room a strange juxtaposition with the wintry light and white sky outside.
Just as he’s drifting off, he hears footsteps into the room and his eyes fly open, half expecting Jim to be standing there. Instead, it’s a tall red headed girl, tight jeans and a bright yellow sweater that doesn’t quite cover her flat stomach. Her eyes are huge and blue -
Sherlock pulls his hand from John’s grasp, murmuring, “That’s enough, John, that’s - I just want to, to touch you, please,” and curls his wet palm around them again. His touch is the most incredible thing John’s ever felt. No lover has
“And I’ll put on some coffee,” Watson smiled fondly at me, his eyes full of regret at our sudden lack of privacy, and winked as he turned away to build the fire.
I squirmed and let out a pleased noise, going loose against him and allowing him to fuck me as hard as he could manage in the confined space of the chair. He swore and then went rigid, straightening up and away from me as he reached his peak, his hips stuttering out of rhythm as I felt the sweet hot rush of his release.
“Yes, you’re right. Oh.” Sherlock arches against him, hipbones poking into John's thighs, and gasps as John works his fingers deeper and twirls a fingertip lightly over the sensitive nub of flesh inside. "Oh oh oh, John, don't stop, right there, oh god."
Sherlock’s hand is sliding up his chest, the side of his thumb rubbing over his nipples. Those lips move up over his shoulder blades, caress the edges of his scar, drop butterfly light kisses up the side of his throat.
Sherlock’s hair. That’s all he could see. Black and mahogany curls, tumbled over each other, mussed and windblown, the way he’d seen them a thousand times standing on some random street corner, police lights flashing a halo behind. The same curls he saw frizzled and damp, just out of the shower, standing in the kitchen eating toast together, sunlight cutting shards through the chemistry equipment. The same curls he’d been trying to replicate on every male hooker he’d been able to find for the last year.
If he'd never met me, this would never have happened to him." Sherlock drags hard on the cigarette, smoke pluming around his face as he lets his head drop into his hand. He feels wrung out, hollow. Like he did all the time before John swept in, all golden smiles and warm skin and laughter. "I'm a fucking curse."
"Are our lives here now? Does it feel like home yet?" John's eyes are dancing with amusement, but there's a genuine concern in the depths of those complicated denim blue irises.
John’s mouth is thick, his neck aches from being crooked against the chair. He rubs at his eyes and sits up. “Oh yes, I feel very dashing right now. What time is it?”
"I'm fine." He sits back in his chair, away from the intensity of Sherlock's gaze. Sips his coffee to occupy his hands and face. "I thought we had a case to discuss, yeah? I'm fine, Sherlock. Leave it."
"Yes, we will, Mrs Hudson." Sherlock turns toward her, lips twitching, horrible at this sort of thing. "Listen. I just wanted to say..."
Sherlock scoops a hand under John’s arse, strokes a line down the seam of his jeans, and John cries out, even with the fabric between Sherlock’s fingers and his his skin. A hard dark thrill crackles through Sherlock at the sound, but it’s too loud, they’re going to get a very unwelcome knock on the door. “Shhhhh...so sensitive, aren’t you, my god.”
The grounds are warm and bright, brimming with hot late summer sunshine, as Mike and Sherlock make their way down to the Quidditch pitch. The three weather-blackened metal hoops on each end of the stadium stand out against a jewel blue sky, and Sherlock can easily make out the silhouettes of the players on their brooms, in jeans and tee shirts with numbers pinned to their backs.
“Yes, thanks. Just for a few minutes though, and then I have to -” John begins, not wanting to end up spending the entire evening trapped on Mrs Hudson’s overly springy sofa watching talk shows.
in love like this, had this kind of giddy elation coursing through him every second of every day, coexisting uncomfortably with the nervous terror that it will all fall away. That Sherlock will get hurt, that one day John won’t be there to protect him, that because of the nature of who they are and what they do, this kind of happiness is a desperately fragile thing. He’s already almost lost Sherlock twice. The thought always lurks darkly in the back of his mind that each casual
John blinks against the glare of early morning winter sunshine and shuts his eyes again. It can't be more than half seven. His head hurts. A result of too much wine the night before and a frigidly cold bedroom. His
- push me?” Sherlock rasps, John greedily lapping at the hollow between his neck and his collarbone.
Sherlock wakes up enough, after some nudging, to accept the bites of cheese and banana that John slips between his lips. John makes him drink half a tumbler of water, and then sets the tray on the floor. They shift down until they're both lying flat, and Sherlock adheres himself to John's side, head on John's bare chest. He throws an arm over John's hips and tucks his hand down into the waistband of his pyjamas.
Sherlock sucks in a hard breath and huffs out through his nose, helpless to hold back the whimpering, gasping, desperate noises that are coming out of him as John sinks slowly deeper. His hips arch up instinctively, pulling John deeper and deeper, and John groans and drops his face into Sherlock’s neck.
It’s unhurried, the way they move together, the whole of Sherlock’s body covering the whole of John’s body, their knees pressed together, Sherlock with one foot tensed and pushing against the corner of the mattress, rocking them both down and forward, making the ancient bed frame creak ominously. Sherlock kisses John’s shoulder, and his neck, and the sweet tender place behind his ear. John moans and strains cursorily against Sherlock’s hands, finally stops trying to hold himself up even the least bit, letting his knees slide apart and laying flat on his stomach against the mattress while Sherlock fucks him slow.
Sherlock rubbed against his hand and sighed. He looked exhilarated, breathing through his mouth, eyes wide and sparkling. John especially loved him like this. Alight from the inside, glimmering with an almost childlike excitement. Even after seven years of friendship and over a year of being together, that look in Sherlock's eyes still made John's stomach flutter just as it had at the first crime scene, when he knew he was hopelessly lost.
"You can't, I can't...it's not fair to you...I have to..." As much as it's the last thing he wants to do, he pushes John's hand off of him. "I need..."
Sherlock’s neck is still pink from John’s mouth. His hair standing up in tangled bunches from John’s fingers. A shiver of possessiveness crawls across John’s shoulders and down his back. Sherlock’s the only person that’s ever stirred these emotions in him - complicated and aching and so marrow deep that he’ll never be free of him, even if he wanted to be.
Eventually their laughter fades, and John twists underneath him, works one arm back to brush at Sherlock’s hair. “I hate to - but I really do - “
Sherlock swiveled upright too quickly, and wobbled to the side as all the blood rushed from his head. "I don't know. He's never mentioned anyone in Scotland."
"Sherlock." John pulls back enough to look at that beautiful face, now even more so for the reddened cheeks and kiss swollen mouth. He looks twenty years old, eyes wide and black, lips parted. "We don't have to if you --"
“Have all afternoon. But every time I look -” John shakes his head, leans forward and quietly sips his beer. His neck prickles with the creeping sensation of being watched, and he lowers his body as much as possible, slumping down until his knees bump Sherlock’s.
Sherlock climbs in first, turns off the kettle, and reaches for the mugs in the cabinet. John shuts and locks the window, gets the tea bags. They move in sync with each other, John getting the sugar, Sherlock getting the milk. John doesn't realise he's actually made a cup of tea for Sherlock instead of himself until he's stirring in the second spoonful of sugar.
"I have no fucking idea what's happening with me, Sherlock." He didn't think that was what he'd meant to say, but he wasn't sure.
“Good.” John grins and doesn’t let go of Sherlock’s hand as he crawls over him to lie down. He spoons up beside Sherlock without hesitation and sighs. “This is - ”
He pulled the door shut and made sure it was locked. Lit a cigarette, shielding it from the wind with a curved hand, and took a deep drag. Okay. Play time was over.
“You’re going to let me come all over that beautiful mouth, aren’t you?” John’s thumb dips between Sherlock’s lips, dragging along the side of his own cock, feeling where their bodies are joined together.
“Are you alright?” Becoming a bit concerned now, John massages the back of Sherlock’s sleep-warm neck gently. “Sherlock?”
“No, love. They -- have someone in custody. Apprehended him during the night. Greg said the evidence is airtight. It’s done.”
I obeyed, sliding up the smooth curved front of the monstrous chair and settling myself along Watson’s right side, our bodies clicking into place as a key does into its lock. He turned his body toward mine, his arm falling immediately around my shoulders, fingertips stroking lightly up and down my bicep. Tension I had not even been conscious of possessing abandoned me at his touch. He was such a comfort to me. My singular comfort, if I was honest. The only true place I have ever felt - or shall ever feel - at home was wherever John Watson was, though I had never laid my feelings out so plainly to him.
John ran the pad of his thumb over Sherlock’s lower lip, that dangerously pouty lip that worked some sort of spell on John, made him prone to forgiving nearly any transgression. He let his thumb dip slightly into Sherlock’s mouth, wetting the tip with Sherlock’s saliva. Sherlock automatically closed his lips and sucked, licking gently at John’s thumb and looking up at him with huge round eyes.
"I know." Sherlock rocked up and put his mouth to John's briefly, and then stood up. "This is difficult. Coming home. It's difficult for me too. So just...please don't apologise. We promised we weren't going to do that anymore, remember? I'm going to get you some dry clothes now. Don't move."
Sherlock watched the swing of the kilt against the backs of John's knees as he walked out of the sitting room, and he couldn't stop himself from reaching down and giving his prick a few hard pulls. He moaned in relief, the coil of arousal that was tight in his belly loosening just for a moment. He exhaled hard and put his hands above his head, trying to calm his uneven breathing, the staccato of his heartbeat. They'd role played before, but there was always an element of silliness to it, both of them fully aware of the artifice of the scene. This didn't feel the same. This time, Sherlock felt utterly transported. He did feel like a swooning maiden, he did feel like one of the characters in one of Mrs Hudson's ridiculous romance novels
"No. Stay with me." He couldn't bear the thought of sleeping alone, waking without Sherlock right next to him. He hadn't slept alone since Sherlock came back.
“We must arise, my dear. Mrs Hudson will be back from church soon.” John makes no move to get up, however, instead yawning and scratching at his tangled hair.
“You okay?” John’s voice so tender it was painful, so full of love it was incomprehensible. He slipped his fingers out and rubbed his hand up and down Sherlock’s side. “You need a minute?”
and then hummed and sighed as every muscle went slack and he nearly fell asleep between John’s legs. He’s dropped miserable tears on the scars that Sherlock suffered while they were apart, laid his cheek against ruined skin and wished he could make it all go away. He’s spent a thousand nights watching the rise and fall of this back, Sherlock sprawled diagonally across the sheets with one foot hanging off the bed.
“I’m sorry.” John whispers, turning in the cradle of Sherlock’s body, twisting his head back to press a kiss against the wet edge of his jaw.
“Oh god, yes, yes, John,” Sherlock sounds on the edge of crying, his voice reedy and strangled, as he hooks three long fingers over the waist of John’s jeans and yanks them awkwardly down to his mid thigh. "I'm yours."
“Perfect,” Sherlock finishes, snuggling down into John’s warm body, relishing the weight of John leaning against him.
Sherlock is waiting for it. His eyes watchful and eager, Adam's apple moving as he swallows hard in anticipation.
John shook his head and pulled his bottom lip between his teeth. “Just - the air, the water, the dirt - it all smells so different here. I remember this smell. I
John gropes for the lube, buried in tangled sheets, fills his palm with it and first slicks himself,  then closes his hand around Sherlock's terribly neglected cock. Sherlock arcs shakily up off the bed, thighs rigid, shouting hoarsely and clutching at John's hips. John pumps him firmly, pulling his foreskin over the head and back, thumbing through the copious precome slick at the head. Sherlock fucks up hard into John's fist, writhing and groaning as he gets close to orgasm after just a few strokes.
Sherlock doesn't say anything, just bends forward and lays his head on John’s knee. John’s fingers reflexively card through soft black curls, scratching at his scalp. Sherlock hums and wraps his arms around John’s thighs.
“In control?” John smoothed Sherlock’s fringe back as he nodded. “And I’ve let you be in control this week and it’s gotten to be a bit much. Too much.”
“Just had a bad feeling. Followed you here. Come on, then.” John’s face softens, his lips curl at the corner, offers his hand to pull Sherlock up to standing.
The next morning, Sherlock puts the bone pipe on mantel, right in the centre. John smiles when he sees it, but doesn’t ask. They never talk about its origins again - where it came from, how it could possibly have gotten Sherlock’s initials on it. Occasionally Sherlock takes it from the mantel and chews on the end, his teeth fitting perfectly into the grooves already there. Some nights, especially those nights, after he's held the pipe, touched it, he dreams of a sooty fireplace in the bedroom, the flickering light of oil lamps, and a tweed waistcoat smooth against his cheek.
The first rays of sunlight begin to burn at edges of the round windows, the feet of robins and little martins jumping round outside the in the dirt, pulling up worms for their breakfast. Shit, it’s six am. Sherlock stretches and stands, joints creaking, muscles tight, and stumbles exhaustedly down the hall. He crawls back into bed, not even bothering to turn back the bedclothes,  his head pounding. He’s got to get a bit more sleep before he meets John at nine to walk down to Hogsmeade.
“Go back to sleep, John.” Sherlock kissed at his throat languidly, breathing him in, letting the soft curls of John’s beard tickle his nose, and pulled the blankets back up over them both. “I’ll be right here when you wake up.”
And Sherlock alive and well and in the sitting room. He swallows down a sudden lump in his throat, though he’s smiling.
It was a punch to the gut, a blooming ache through his stomach and chest, to hear that name. Another person. Another life. A life spent trying to do things right, and do the right things. Pressed uniforms and laughter in windswept tents filled with sand, heavy guns rested on sunburned shoulders. Blood and death in the name of Queen and country.
“I - I think maybe we should stop.” John kisses Sherlock’s hip and finally opens his eyes. “I’m - um. I think we need to. I think
"There's no need to curse at me, man. Just, you know...it's early." His voice betrayed his nervousness, quavering pathetically.
John glides his hand up over Sherlock’s smooth concave stomach, soothing him, staying him, and slows the movement of his tongue against the sensitive underside of his cock. Sherlock’s hand leaves his hair, finding John’s and entwining their fingers. John squeezes his hand as he pulls off and presses a kiss to Sherlock’s trembling thigh.
John goes to refill the coffees and Harry pushes him back to sitting. “No, you sit there. You’re still recuperating.” She climbs in the flat and returns five minutes later, handing them hot coffees and the blanket from their bed. “Getting cold out here.”
“I want to be angry, Sherlock. I can’t make it this easy for you.” John shook his head, even as Sherlock’s face looming closer. John seemed to be pulling him. “You owe me. You completely fucked up my life. And I don’t even know why. I don’t even know what all this was for.”
“Good, baby?” John can’t help the smirk on his face as he soothes over the love bite with his tongue. “You love when I mark you up a bit, yeah?”
“Sherlock, stop thinking about the case. You’re too tired to make any headway, you’re just making yourself mental.” John doesn’t turn around. Doesn’t have to.
“Voldemort. Which, of course, isn’t possible, but. There have always been lingering Death Eaters among us, those who renounced Voldemort before the end and thus escaped punishment, or those who claimed they were not acting of their own free will. It’s quite possible someone is trying to replicate the circumstances of Voldemort’s original rise to power.”
“You sound very pleased about that.” John smiled as he sat up. He pointed at Sherlock’s arm, which he’d obviously wiped clean, but hadn’t been dressed yet. “Okay, now you.”
When Sherlock was alive, it was most often with lust, his hot breath coming in short gasps over his own chest as he ground his hips into the bed and tried not to call out Sherlock’s name. The shame would creep over him as he tiptoed down the steps to clean up, far too aware of Sherlock’s presence in the sitting room. He would see Sherlock’s silhouette against the dim lamplight as he left the loo, all pouted lips and aquiline nose, and fall asleep thinking of that beautiful face nuzzling between his shoulder blades.
"Christ, you're a fucking vision, you know that?" John husks out, slapping Sherlock's back and arse until his own palm is tingling and half numb, until there's not a single patch of unmarked skin beneath him. "That pale skin pinks up like a ripe peach when I hit you. Listen to you, crying and begging for it, fucking yourself against the mattress like a cheap slut. Don't you dare come, or I'll stop. You won't get anything else today."
“Ta. I’ll go wait outside.” John drew on his cigarette, ambled out the door. The neighborhood was nothing but cracked sidewalks, weeds erupting from every split, boarded up windows, and neglect. It was a place to disappear.
"Yeah," Sherlock whispers back, and unscrews the cap, squeezes a bit of the stuff onto his fingertips and rocks up - somewhat unsteadily - onto his feet. He braces himself against the wall with his left arm, and John’s arm slides naturally around his waist, like it was meant to be there.
“Why not? Fuck them. Fuck anyone who looks at you like that.” Sherlock’s twisting backwards, watching them walk away.
Sherlock bucks up as John’s fingers close around his erection through his trousers. The bruise on his neck is blossoming purple and red, blood spreading hot under his skin.
I apologise profusely for giving you all this insanely long chapter and no sex. I'm really sorry. The boys just need to wait for the right moment. It's coming, I promise.
John lifts the covers and spoons up along Sherlock’s back, knees and ankles and every knobby bony part of them aligned, John’s arm casually tossed over the indentation of Sherlock’s waist. He slides his hand up until he finds Sherlock’s hand, and threads their fingers together.
He closes his eyes, ready to acquiesce, begins to try to blank out his mind...and then all at once he’s tumbling backwards out of the car, smacking his head hard on the asphalt, legs flipping backwards in a somersault. Gravel grinds into his shoulder as he struggles to understand what just happened.
John hasn’t done this for quite a while either, but it’s natural, and his body remembers how this goes, so he licks a long stripe down the underside of Sherlock’s cock as he backs his head away and then sinks down again. Sherlock bucks his hips, his fingers tight in John’s hair, and makes a hiccuping noise in his throat. John pulls off completely and looks up at Sherlock, whose eyes are shut and his mouth is hanging open and he already looks completely destroyed, which is the most brilliant thing John has ever seen.
Sherlock teased his hand under the elastic waistband and traced his fingertips through soft hair until he found velvet skin, blood hot and half hard. He trailed two fingers down John's length, then over the inside of his thigh, the slightly damp crease of his groin. John moaned low in his chest, the vibration rumbling through his sternum and into Sherlock's palm.
"Oh Jesus, John, do you even know how hot that is?" The pressure of John's hot wet mouth around his fingers is overwhelming; he needs something, anything. John hasn't even touched him yet. His cock is throbbing with need. He rocks against John's leg and nearly comes right then, a tingling shudder overtaking him, the feeling of John's body against his aching flesh nearly too much.
“Why aren’t you angrier?” That wasn’t at all the question he’d wanted to ask, but it seemed more pertinent.
Sherlock can't answer, just turns his head and captures John's mouth, licking warm against his tongue. John's firm pulls gentle into a soft caress, matching the movements of his hand to the tender dance of their lips and tongues. Sherlock twists his hand up into John's hair, cradling the back of his head and pulling them impossibly close together. He can't ever get John close enough. He wants to take him into his body, fuse them at a molecular level, make it physically impossible for them to be apart.
John’s sucking a bruise on his neck, sweet and burning, his capillaries popping against John’s hungry lips. It makes him squirm, and want to do something with his hands, but he can’t because John’s holding them down against the mattress. He bucks and makes a desperate whimpering noise in his throat as his cock drags against John’s thigh.
There he is again, blonde head bobbing in a sea of arms reaching for shots and tucking £5 notes in the waist of his tiny gold shorts. Sherlock almost breathes a sigh of relief. This feeling is completely foreign, this sharp, bright want sparking down his nerve endings, raising gooseflesh on the nape of his neck. It’s more than just wanting to fuck him, though, he does definitely want that. This is something deeper, more confusing than wanting a quick fuck and no phone number, thanks anyway. This is something that makes him pull his phone from the pocket of his jeans and toss off a text to Lestrade before he can think himself out of it.
“You look - “ John pulls Sherlock down until their mouths are touching again, pulling that lip out of Sherlock’s mouth and into his own. Sherlock groans into his mouth, his hips jerking against John’s stomach. “You look like you’re
this album. I used to listen to it every day.” John rapped his knuckles against the door, watching the moor blur past them, green and grey and endless.
“Sorry, sorry,” he slurred against my mouth, and gripped my hip with a sticky hand. “Did I hurt you?”
“Only about forty five minutes.” Sherlock patted his arm dry with a gauze pad and placed a large rectangular adhesive bandage over it. “You’re absolutely
, nose buried in the humid pheromone laden juncture of John’s neck and shoulder, cock buried deep inside the warmth of John’s body, intoxicated by the way their bodies fit together as though they were made to do just this.
"John, are you alright?" Sherlock's voice was sharper than subspace normal, the inflection more crisp. He was concerned enough to be emerging from the safety of his subspace.
“I love you, too.” Sherlock murmurs, bringing a hand up tight around the back of John’s neck. His fingers dig into the hollow at the base of John’s skull, holding him there.
you liked those. Have to remember that the next time you're busy fussing with mould spores or something." John's lips played over his left shoulder blade, moving his nose in circles, brushing the bristles on his upper lip up along Sherlock's hair line.
You always remind me of a barn owl the way you blink at me when you’re trying to process something. I’m not making fun, love, I promise.
John rucked up Sherlock's shirt and pressed kisses along his spine, worked one hand between his thighs and brushed his thumb lightly in circles, said fondly, "You bloody gorgeous bastard. You make me crazy.”
." John's whimpers turned into a long low groan as his cock thickened and pulsed in Sherlock's hand. He thrashed and arched backward, sweaty fingers scrabbling uselessly at the sheets and then bending forward to clutch at Sherlock's shoulders. He was right on the edge, shivering from head to toe, breathing in short little gasps. He stilled completely as he came, every muscle contracting tightly as he spilled hot into the caress of Sherlock's hand, and over it, long stripes of translucent white slipping across Sherlock's belly.
Sherlock claws at one of the arms squeezing into John, but gets dragged back himself, huge ham hock arms across his own chest, sour garlicky breath hot on the side of his face.
“I still don’t even know who we’re talking about.” Mike says, shrugging, and tucks into a Yorkshire pudding with gusto.
The sight of that beautiful face lost in pleasure pushes John past his breaking point, and his orgasm spirals suddenly down his spine, bright and intense. He shakes silently as he spills hot all over their hastily pulled down trousers, their mingled semen sliding in viscous rivulets down their pressed together thighs. Sherlock slows his hand, uncoils his fingers and grips John’s hipbone instead. Coming doesn't abate any of their frantic need. Barely a second passes before John's biting anew at Sherlock's neck, and Sherlock's gasping, pawing at John's back and writhing, pulling John’s face against his in a vicious kiss.
This John held himself completely differently. There was no softness left in him. His John was always so soft; jumpers and warm tea and the layer of pudge over muscle. This man wasn’t his John. Sherlock couldn’t stop himself from trailing a fingertip over John’s face. He laid back on the cot in the tiny wood shack he was currently calling home, and clutched the phone screen down to his chest. He couldn’t look at this beautiful stranger for one more second.
“I believe you.” John nudges Sherlock’s face up to his, and their mouths meet in a tumult of need, biting and pulling at each other’s lips. The sensation of kissing Sherlock has always been overwhelming, but this. It’s like finding each other all over again. John’s head is buzzing with electricity, one long droning note in his ears, blocking out everything except Sherlock’s lips enveloping his own, Sherlock’s wine-sour tongue in his mouth, Sherlock’s nose bumping his as they tilt their heads to deepen the kiss.
at the match every now and then. Sherlock watches her, instead of the match, takes in how her nose is just like John’s, the speckling of freckles over her nose and cheeks, her long reddish eyelashes, chipped black nail varnish and soft leather engineer boots. Her intelligence radiates off her. Sherlock can almost smell it. She's got the self confidence of someone who truly doesn't care if anyone likes them, doesn't care what other people think. He likes her. He never likes people right off, never.
, you’re so...are you really mine? Forever, no matter what happens? Mine?" Oh, so he’s definitely still drunk, because he knows he wouldn’t say such a silly thing if he weren’t. Even though it’s true, so true, he feels it in his bones, John is the only person he’s ever needed to possess this way, to be possessed by.
"Oh, yeah." John fumbles the first packet he pulls out, drops it on the floor. "Fuck," he mutters, tearing open the second one and rolling it slowly down over his leaking prick, making sure not to allow any precome to get on the outside, though there's probably some small amount on Sherlock's stomach and hip, and John knows the chances of him having something are very slim because he always took precautions, he can't, he absolutely
“For me, yes?” Sherlock reaches for it, but doesn’t touch it until the bird rolls his large eyes as if to say
Molly grins as they slide into the benches at the Hufflepuff table and start loading their plates. “Sherlock
“Alright, love. Let’s go home, then. I just wish I had my…” John trails off, fingers instinctively reaching into the waistband of his jeans.
to do, I haven't." He looks bashful, those thick blonde lashes half covering his irises, colour on his cheeks, holding his lip in his teeth. "Is that okay?"
John laughing and singing in a pub, his teammates arms around him - the image was ridiculously easy for Sherlock to conjure up. That kind of easy camaraderie didn’t come easily to either of them, but John had a lot more experience at pretending it did. Sherlock
Sherlock's never been one to do the right thing. He deftly undoes John's jeans and shoves his hand down the front, pulls John's cock out of the top. It looks crude, and gorgeous. John's head rolls back, his face and neck flushed maroon, white blotches all over his cheeks.
“I want you inside me,” I said in a hush, finally able to verbalise the ache within me, how my body longed to be filled by him.
. John smiled against the window glass, let his leg inch over until it was resting against Sherlock's.
with me like that, after all we’ve - I’ve - been through?! How could you do that to me?” John roars, tears suddenly streaming down his face, and he’s not even sure why. He wants to laugh and to cry and to punch something, all at once. He settles for punching one of the seat cushions, even though the sting of it across his knuckles isn’t nearly painful enough to be satisfying. “Jesus, what is
Sherlock smiles, takes hold of John's wrist and presses his lips to his finger, then his palm, and lays his cheek into John's hand. "So you're never going to die? That's ambitious."
“Oh John.” There’s a tide of emotion rising in him. He kisses John’s neck, his spine, his shoulder, his hair. Any part of him he can reach with his mouth. Thrusts his hips forward, the intensity of this making him feel faint. All the blood rushes from his brain, sweeping hot through his veins.
“Get down here and kiss me.” John’s hand left my hip, and drifted up to the back of my neck, tugging me down to meet his mouth with mine own.
I let my eyes fall shut as I breathed him in, turned my face and kissed at the hollow of muscle above his knee. I felt more than half intoxicated, by the masculine smell of John’s arousal, by the feeling of his soft skin under my lips. His hand fell gently into my hair, scratching at my scalp with his short nails, and I rubbed up into his touch like a cat would to his master.
John watched him go, striding methodically out of the diner. He was the kind of man who was never in a hurry. The kind of man who wouldn’t shake committing the most vile murder, would never fear the police showing up.
"You like that?" Sherlock looks up at him, eyes half moons, lashes dark and lowered, lips against John's wrist.
John looks down, digs the toe of his trainer into the ground. Here it comes. Why did he ever say anything, why did he bother --
, and they’ve shown each other with their mouths and their hands and in everything they’ve done for each other. But there’s something different about the words
Sherlock’s lips are silky soft and warm as they slide against John’s. They part automatically, a gasp of surprise and pleasure escaping into John’s mouth as Sherlock’s hand curls around the back of his neck and holds him there. They’ve kissed thousands of times - deep and hungry, tangled together in sweaty sheets, quick pecks on the cheek before they part for the day, John’s lips pressed hard against Sherlock’s forehead, snuggled on the sofa half asleep - but there’s something new in this one.
John's grin is unadulterated sex, his eyes on fire. “Oh, did I surprise you? I may be short and pretty, but I was also an army sergeant. I'm no delicate little flower.”
Sherlock nodded, his frontal lobe hitting his skull, feeling with painful clarity the movement of every hair on his body, every nerve ending. His skin was on fire. His skin was made of ice. His head pounded and he writhed in pain, muscles cramping and convulsing.
“Save it altogether, love, if you’d be so kind.” John stands up from where he’s been sitting on the closed toilet lid and lets his towel drop to the floor. “Alright then, into the bath with you.”
this shit out loud in a public place. Fuck, but you’re stupid as shit sometimes.” John bit back an urge to smack him. “But, you know, well done, I guess.”
But Sherlock's knees are giving out, and every other muscle is too. Warmth rushes through his body like a tide and he's falling, falling through air through time out of himself and into John.
Rose looks perplexed, and perhaps a bit hurt, but she recovers quickly. “Sure. And then I really have to get to some homework.”
They don’t talk about themselves much, or what’s changed between them. Sherlock’s trying to heal, which is both consuming and tiring, and John’s comfortable in his natural role as the caretaker. Once, Sherlock awakens to John’s mouth pressed against his hair, whispering something sweetly but unintelligibly. Sherlock pretends he’s still asleep, strains to try and discern what John’s saying. He thinks he hears a
“I’m real. I’m real, and so very sorry, John. I should have told you from the beginning. I listened to the wrong people, I should have...” Sherlock’s lower lip quivered, and John was overcome with the need to touch it, to comfort him, the caretaker in him reemerging.
Molly isn’t stupid. A flicker of suspicion lights her eyes, but then she smiles and nods, lifting the chessboard off the floor and putting it on the little chest beside the hearth. “Alright. After breakfast. Night, Sherlock.”
"No. We just have to get you somewhere to lie down." Sherlock started climbing the steps slowly. Every creak resounded through John's head, thunderously painful. He felt sick again. Sick and humiliated and furious. "Just fifteen steps. Surely soldiers carry injured comrades more than fifteen steps, yes? Nothing to be ashamed of. Now hold on to my neck, alright?"
“I agree.” John tucks his fingertips into the hollow of Sherlock’s jaw and pulls him forward, brushes their mouths together frightfully gently, barely a kiss. “One caveat,” He murmurs against Sherlock’s parted lips.
John pulls back with a nibble at Sherlock's lower lip, breathing hard. He thumbs across Sherlock’s cheekbone, “Okay?”
“Oh fuck, baby. Oh god, that feels good. It hurts. It hurts and it’s so good, don’t stop, don’t stop.” John’s other hand was still holding the blade to Sherlock’s arm. He’d been so lost in his own bliss that he’d forgotten Sherlock.
“And what can I get you both?” He turned a curious smile on John. A smile he recognised. It was Greg’s when he was interrogating someone. This guy was a cop, or had been. Tread carefully, John.
" Sherlock breathes out. He can't comprehend this. How everything has changed, how it all feels - romantic, suddenly. Like they're in a film where the ending is predetermined, the boy gets the boy, things aren't complicated and messy and confusing. He knows it’s false, it can’t last like this. Maybe even just...just for a few days. To pretend. For them both.
He starts moving before he’s even realised he’s doing it, twitching his shoulders, rolling his hips a little. John presses up behind him, a hand possessively wrapped around his waist. Lips against his ear, “Sherlock. You know I can’t fucking dance at all, right?”
Now that he's begun, it's as if a dam has broken. The words spill from him without eloquence or logic, "Sherlock, breathe. Breathe and listen to me. I should have said something before, I know. I should have said it better, and more -- something -- fiercely, I guess. I should have made sure you knew, instead of assuming and guessing and. Shit. I should have done so many things differently and I should have just had the bollocks to speak up but god -- I don't know. The words just never came and I was afraid, I was so fucking afraid, Sherlock. That you'd say I was mad, that it wasn't like that, that you just didn't see me like that, and then I knew, after the wedding I knew that you did, that it wasn't just me, but it was too late and fuck I thought about leaving Mary all the time, but there was the baby and I felt like a shit doing that and then you wouldn't return my calls and I thought maybe I was completely delusional. And then -- when she -- when I thought I was going to lose you again, I just. Couldn't say anything. I wanted you any way I could have you, didn't seem as important anymore, as long as you were alive and here and with me."
