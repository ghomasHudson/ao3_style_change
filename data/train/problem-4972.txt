He was about half hour into his class when he almost doubled over in pain. His back was turned from the class. One young girl spoke up and said, “Professor Winchester, are you okay?” Sam tried to compose himself. “Yeah. Yes, I’m fine. You know, I think you guys are good. I’m gonna dismiss class early.” Some students protested but most we’re more than happy to get out of class early. The young girl who was worried about Sam hesitated before leaving, but ultimately her friends excitingly dragged her out of the classroom.
“Thank you,” he breathed. “Oh, and one other thing, if you could not tell the other angels where I am.”
“I have a question. Where the hell have you been?” Dean asked, with his arms crossed over his chest. He could feel his arms resting on top of his stomach which was a very odd sensation for him. He pushed on. “I’ve called you plenty of times!” Dean shouted.
Cas understood. “That’s fine, Dean. It’s going to take me a while to propose the idea to Heaven anyway, so we have plenty of time,” he grinned.
“Not particularly…”
“I heard my little girl crying,” she said with her arms out. Sam carefully gave her Charlotte to hold. When she got her in arms, she tickled her tummy and blew raspberries on it. Charlotte went into a laughing fit. It was music to their ears.
“And when you say ‘we’, did you approach him about this or did he approach you?” she asked.
“Doesn’t mean I enjoyed it,” he mumbled. “Alright, I’m gonna shower.” Dean braced himself by placing a hand on his back to stand up. Sam rushed to him to help him up when Dean waved him off. “I’m fine,” he grunted.
“Who are you?” Dean asked him, very shocked to see someone who wasn’t in their inner circle speaking to him about his pregnancy.
“I’m taking you to the hospital,” she stated firmly.
Dean looked Jody in the eye and said, “If I tell you who it is, do you promise not to tell anybody.”
Sam took a seat on the edge of his bed. “About Cas.”
Dean took it and downed it gratefully. “Thanks,” he cleared his throat again. “Ugh, what is with my voice.”
It was too early for Sam. Around 4am he heard his son wailing through the baby monitor. It was his turn to check on the twins. He knew their cries like the back of his hand. Ethan was hungry. He groggily got out of bed and padded his way to the nursery. The hallway to the bunker was dimly lit, causing him to bump into a side table that he didn’t remember being there. He cursed quietly cursed at his throbbing toe as he made his way to the sounds of his crying son.
“Calm? What the hell are you--,” Dean got a glance of his reflection from a picture of him and his mom on his nightstand. He grabbed the frame and could just make out his face, where he saw his womanly features.  He got up and ran into the bathroom to get a better look. Sam ran after him and stood at the door. His jawline was softer but still angled nicely. His hair was short like usual but cut in a way that would flatter a woman. He also had boobs. Nothing huge, but they were definitely there. He turned to his brother. “WHAT HAPPENED?!” he yelled.
Dean shook his head. “No, Cas. I’ve been planning this meal for weeks. It has to be perfect. Plus, I don’t want Sam and Becky to know that something is wrong.”
Sam couldn’t get over the fight they had about hunting. It was a hard decision that he made, but it was his decision at the end of the day. And he shouldn’t be judged for it by his brother, who had wanted the same thing in the past. Dean was aware that Sam was pissed at him, but he didn’t care. Given the chance, he wouldn’t take back what he said.
Sam opened his laptop to send a mass email to his students that he would be cancelling the remainder of his classes that day. He felt bad because many students expressed their excitement in the review class before the final. He hit send and then impatiently waited for his brother. It was the longest ten minutes, ever. The pain was just getting worse and the bleeding wasn’t slowing down.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Oh, Sam your son is fine. We kept things PG-13.”
“I take it that he’s upset,” Cas said as he rubbed at his sore cheek.
Dean was glad Cas was holding him because it felt as if the floor beneath him was being ripped away. “No, Cas, you can’t. I
Cas looked around his surroundings. “Is Sam around?” he asked.
“We can fight,” Cas grabbed his hand. “But you can’t,” he tells him.
Dean threw his hands in the air. “Because it’s Becky and she has a track record with these kinds of things!”
Dean was relieved to see that the angel wasn’t dead. “I’m asking for your help.”
“You know, Dean, if you want to talk about your sexuali--,”
“Well, well, well,” Dean teased as he sauntered into the kitchen.
Sam squinted at it. “Is that her diary?” he asked with anger in his voice.
“Becky, I need you to come back to the bunker. I think Sam is in labor. His contractions are 10 minutes apart,” Dean said.
“I do!” Cas spat back.
Dean had to remind himself to stay calm. “I heard Cas is under some kind of trial because of the Nephilim.”
Sam thought he was going to regret this. “Fine. 5 minutes,” he said. He told her to meet him at a local coffee shop. So, she abandoned her work out and met him there. Neither one of them actually got something to drink. It somehow didn’t seem appropriate. Sam crossed his arms as he sat across from her. “Your 5 minutes start now.”
Focused on the road Claire asked, “And what exactly do you plan on doing? Demand the angel to break your boyfriend out of jail?” She trusted Dean with her life, but this sounded insane even for her.
Jody raised her eyebrows. “20 weeks,” she said unbelievably. “And Sam told me that your pregnant with a Nephilim? Like Jack?”
Sam waited in the room with Dean so he didn’t discover on his own that he was a woman. When he eventually woke, he winced at his growing migraine. Getting thrown into bookshelves will do that to you. “Ah, my head.” Dean cleared his throat. It sounded higher than usual.
“I do know her. She’s an angel and I trust her. She’s one of the good ones. If she needs help then I’m going to help her. I trust her,” Castiel told her.
Dean interrupted him. “Okay, that enough. We’re not going to have that conversation. It’s not a big deal that Cas is here. I’m more worried about you and that kid in there.”
of whiskey.”
“I bought it last night,” he said with a mouthful of cake. “I had every intention just to grab some fruits and veggies for my green juice, but then I saw the chocolate cake in the bakery section. Taunting me,” Sam recounts. He sighed, “I’ve lost all control, Dean, and I don’t even care anymore.” He took another bite of his cake. “There’s a pie in the fridge,” he told him.
“I see,” Sam said. “Well, you can’t keep this a secret from him. You need to tell him, sooner than later.”
She took that as her cue to begin. He lifted his shirt to reveal his modest round belly that lay hidden under his black t-shirt. She squirted the gel on his stomach and began to guide the transducer across his belly. All eyes were fixated on the black and white monitor that displayed the baby that existed inside of Dean. It was the first time he’d seen his baby and he wanted to be happy about it but all he could think about was how badly he wanted Cas to be there with him. Sharing this beautiful moment. Hold each other’s hands as they watch their baby blissfully move around inside of Dean. Holding back tears he asked, “How does everything look?”
Dean quickly got to work and began setting up the spell to summon Gabriel. He made a rather large circle with holy oil that he took from one of their old supply rooms. Then he got to work on the spell itself. In a large bowl, he threw the ingredients in with precision and determination. The last ingredient was some of his blood. He grabbed his silver blade and hesitantly sliced into his palm, most likely opening an old wound. Dean closed his hand into a fist, encouraging the blood to drip on top of the ingredients. A rather large spark followed by a puff of smoke emerged from the bowl. Dean backed up a bit and waved his hand blowing the smoke away from his direction, trying not to breathe it in.
“You can’t even think of the turkey without wanting to get sick. Let me help, Dean,” Cas said, almost pleading. “I can pick up the turkey and cook dinner while you rest.”
“Because the angles have a compelling case. Young Nephilim’s can be extremely dangerous.
—I don’t want to start---what we can’t finish,” she panted. “Y—yo-your brother is—downstairs,” she said giving another excuse. It took everything in her body not to tear off her clothes and have sex in the little alcove, but she also had to get to work. “And—I have work,” she said as her last-ditch offense.
Castiel slammed him up against the side of the Impala and kissed him back. Hard. Castiel opened the back seat where Castiel tumbled on top of him. Dean struggled to get his bra off. He was used to taking them off of women but doing it as a woman was more difficult. Luckily Castiel gave him an assist. He also helped him take off his pants. He looked Dean in the eye. “Are you sure that you want to do this?”
Sam weakly turned around to face his brother. “Lore books? Dean, it’s just a virus. It’s not like this is supernatural or something.”
When Dean pulled away Becky noticed wetness in Dean’s eyes. He sheepishly looked away and cleared his throat to mask his wavery voice. “Have—uh—have you shown Cas?”
Becky interrupted Sam, “I know. I know. I know. I won’t keep it from him much longer. I promise.”
Sam pointed at the door. “Get out. Just leave me alone.”
Dean brought Cas’s hand underneath his black t-shirt to his bare stomach. They waited patiently until Cas could feel a distinctive foot hit his palm. Cas quietly gasped which was followed by a soft laugh. His eyes fixated on Dean’s baby bump. “Wow…,” he trailed. “such a miracle.”
He took a rather large swig of his coffee before he said, “I asked her to move in with me.”
“I don’t know…it didn’t seem relevant I guess.”
Cas liked the sound of that, but he also didn’t want to abandon his brothers and sisters. He knew that they wouldn’t understand his love for the elder Winchester or his child. Dean was right, he had to lay low if he was ever going to be respected by the garrison. “Okay, I’ll stay,” he told Dean, sealing it with a kiss. Dean took off his sweatshirt to reveal him wearing a tight grey t-shirt. “Wow, you’re bigger than I thought you were,” Cas comments, staring at Dean’s stomach.
Dean stared at the test. “Or maybe I’m just stressed. Can’t periods be late because women are stressed? I’m stressed, Sam,” he said, trying to stall.
“Not exactly,” Cas responded. “I had my wings clipped.”
Jocelyn tightly pursed her lips. “Yeah. Totally. I got to go,” she said and then turned on her heels in a huff.
“Let them!” Dean threw his hands up in the air as if he was egging the angels on.
She opened her eyes a little to see Dean trying to escape. “Dean? Is everything okay?”
“No, it’s not fine. You’re not fine. I know that you have got this guilt about the pregnancy but that doesn’t mean that you can’t have feelings or that you have to avoid me.” She looked up from her stew to see Sam starring back at her. “Don’t think I didn’t notice you deliberately leaving a room when I walked in.” He then cracked a smile, which made her do the same. “We’re partners in this right?”
“Yes, I was pretty disappointed that he would lie to the angels about this.”
The nausea was beginning to come back. Before he spilled his guts, he felt Cas grab his hands, anchoring him. “I have to stay in Heaven while the trial is proceeding.”
“Oh, don’t worry I will,” she said, and then pulled her phone out of her clutch for emphasis.
Dean smiled at the angel. He missed him terribly and it felt good to see him again. “Hi, ya Cas. It’s good to see you. You want a beer?”
Sam took his coffee to go. His brother may right but that didn’t mean he had to listen to it. Dean then cursed at himself because now that Sam walked away, he had to pry himself from his chair to get his breakfast started.
“And what does that mean?”
After a few minutes of Dean icing his hand he had some time to think. He didn’t want to go back to the bunker with his brother. Being in an enclosed space with Becky and Sam seemed suffocating. Sam stopped the bleeding from his nose and once he did, he entered the house to grab the twins and put them in the car. Dean watched him go in and out of the house as he packed the car. The last item to grab was Dean. “You coming or what?” Sam asked him as he slung the diaper bag over his shoulder.
Dean was at his breaking point. Here was his last morsel of hope and it was slipping away from him. The fire crackled filling in the silence between the two. He wasn’t going to release Gabriel until he had some sort of plan worked out. He closed his eyes and took a cleansing breath in an attempt to keep his emotions under control. “Cas and I need you, Gabriel. You are my only hope at getting him out of that jail and back to me. Not to mention to the threat looming over my child.”
Cas turned to Sam who didn’t look as surprised by Dean’s actions. After all, he had watched Dean come to terms with everything going on, and that included his complicated feelings towards Cas.
His brother twisted the top off his beer. “You ever get that feeling that someone is watching you?”
Christmas morning was pretty calm. Sam made breakfast in the morning and they all exchanged gifts. There was one last gift under the tree that Cas insisted Sam and Becky open ilast. They waited until it was the only gift left. Becky was seated on the floor with Charlotte in-between her legs. She was the closest to the gift and grabbed it from under the tree. It was a medium sized box, wrapped in gold wrapping paper. She tore it open and saw that in the box contained two onesies. “Thanks, Dean! The twins could always use more clothes!” she thanked.
Dean took a seat on her super comfortable couch. “Good, you know considering I’ve been sick the past few weeks.”
Dean rose his eyebrows. He eyed the mason jar with slight disgust. “You want me to drink your grace and whatever else is in that jar?” he asked as he pointed to what looked like a stick floating around in a mystery liquid.
Sam wasn’t going to argue with him. “I’ll be fine,” he said with a stifled yawn. “I’m gonna finish my coffee, check the security cameras, finish building the crib--,”
Dean opened the sliding door to the deck which overlooked the modest backyard that Jody had. Sam had migrated from the deck into the backyard facing the woods.
Dean cut him off speaking very low and as calmly as he could. “You know, when you told me that the angels were okay with us having our baby, I was fucking terrified. I saw what Sam went through and I wasn’t sure if I could go through with that. But you convinced me that I could do it. You told me that I was going to be okay because you were going to be there with me, every step of the way. But you lied,” Dean said. He closed his book and placed it on his nightstand.
She had ordered some pizza for everyone but Dean was too tired to eat. He was asleep before 10 pm. Sam had a slice, fed the twins, and then passed out on the couch.
“Okay, then we won’t let it get out.”
His mind was clouded. He then he heard fast footsteps approaching. Around the corner he saw Becky running towards him. “Where is Sam? Is he okay? Is the baby okay?”
Dean frowned and then shrugged. “No. Why, do you?”
Dean nodded. “Course we have. She keeps ignoring our calls. Red headed bitch,” he said right before guzzling his beer and ordering another one.
“This guy I met on Tinder. We’ve been texting for a while now, so he suggested we meet up.”
Sam opened his mouth to rebuttal but a groan came out instead. He put a hand to his stomach as he slowly breathed out.
“Yeah, Noah is taking me to Roussillon,” she said as she touched up her blush.
It was as good a time as any to break the news that Sam wanted to leave the bunker. So, he thought he should rip the band aid off. “Well I was thinking of moving--,”
Sam shook his head. “This has been a thing for weeks. I highly doubt that it’s virus. If it is a virus it’s certainly not a normal one.” Sam had finally come to terms that whatever he was sick with wasn’t normal.
“Considering?” Dean raised an eyebrow.
As Dean went through the bags, he found the pregnancy test in a white carton at the bottom of a bag. He discreetly held it up. “Should I take it now?” he asked with uncertainty.
throw it up,” Castiel warned him.
She clicked her tongue. “I see. And Dean had sex with a guy?”
“In the dungeon. We got to get to him before the angels do.”
“I’m pregnant,” Dean revealed quietly.
“Is this Sam Winchester?”, the woman on the other line asked.
“It is! I love him too. And as someone who loves him, I need to tell him the whole truth about my life which scares the living shit out of me,” she said as she looked over her children. “What if he hates me? What if he’s freaked out by it all and wants nothing to do with me?”
“Hey, don’t put that kind of pressure on yourself. I’m sure it’ll be fine.” He flashed a reassuring smile at her.
“So that’s why you were humming earlier,” he smirked. Another thought came to Sam. “Hold on, did you have sex with him?”
“No, you’re not,” Gabriel said. They all look in Gabriel's direction, thinking that he knows something they don’t. “What? It doesn’t take an archangel to know that you’re suffering.”
Castiel couldn’t get his brain around summoning Jack. There are spells to summon God but very few worked and he doubted that Jack was going to come down willfully. “How will you summon Jack?” Castiel asked.
Cas looked past Dean, not looking him in the eye. “It’s just work-- it’s not important,” Dean didn’t believe him and told him to continue with his eyes. “With Jack being the new God, there is a lot go chaos up there and I needed to be there,” he lied.
“Why not?” Sam asked.
Sam gave off a frustrated sigh. “I didn’t give up. But there are worse things than being a woman, Dean. You can still do what you love best and hunt. Speaking of , I found us case.”
Dean bent over and groaned, wrapping an arm around his middle.
She gazed into Sam’s helpful eyes. He was her perfect guy. Strong, sensitive, sweet…everything she’s ever wanted in a husband. But she was glad to have him as her friend for now. Maybe things would change, but she needed to learn how to create healthy relationships. “What about you? Do you want kids anytime soon?”
“Why did you have say all of that crap to Jocelyn? I’ve lied enough to her already don’t you think? Now she’s gonna go back to my class and tell everyone that I’m still married to you when I’m not!” she yelled fuming.
Dean wasn’t expecting a straight answer so soon. “Oh, good to know. So, just to clarify…the angel can’t insert the baby into himself, right?”
Dean screamed after his brother but it was useless. He was now a sitting duck, with his boyfriend bleeding out on a table, alone. He then felt a something wet trickling down his leg. His water broke.
“No. Have you had sex while you were a woman?” he clarified.
Dean stormed out of the bathroom looking very panicked. “What do I do? What the hell do I do?! How did this happen?” he asked the room, but Jody and Sam couldn’t think of answers fast of enough for Dean. “Well???!!!”
Gabriel scoffed. “Asking?” He then pointed to the fire around him. “Because with the holy oil and the fire it doesn’t seem like you’re asking. It looks like more of a demand.” The fire illuminated Gabriel in the most sinister way.
Dean gasped the moment Cas put his mouth around his dick. He almost orgasmed at that alone, but he didn’t want it to end too soon. At the edge of cumming Dean grasped Cas’ hair and pulled him into a kiss. “I want you inside of me,” he growled.
“Hi, Dean.” They heard Jack appear behind them. Sam and Dean whirled around to see their old friend, now God, standing in their library. “I heard your prayers.”
Dean had the girl twin in his hands and Cas had the boy twin in his hands, both feeding them a bottle in their new nursery. “Did Sam or Becky ever mention a name?” Cas asked.
Becky.”
“I know but things change. I can’t really explain it.”
The question hung in the air. The angel looked away from Dean as if she couldn’t bear to see the disappointment. “I don’t believe he does; which means your baby’s time is limited.”
Castiel was shocked that she found him. She must of have been honing in on his grace to be able to zero in on him. He reminded himself that he needed to pretend as if things are normal. “I’ve been helping with the Winchesters with a very difficult case,” he lied.
The boys had been hunting the same pair of witches for weeks. They were sisters who enjoyed going from town to town messing with the town folk and killing anyone who gets in the way of their fun. They were hard to catch because they would change their appearance often. But they left the same bloody trail. Sam and Dean were in the third town where they got wind of their presence.
She leaned in the car and kissed him on the cheek and waved goodbye as he continued to pull out of the driveway.
“And he hasn’t told you why?”
Sam thanked Jody and the girls and then got Dean in the car. For the most part, it was a rather quiet ride back to Kansas. Sam saw that Becky had called him a few times, but he figured it was because he forgot to call her to tell her that he had left Sioux Falls. She tended to worry when Sam travelled long distances. He figured he’d call her when they got closer to town or when Dean woke up from his nap. Whatever came first. Except Dean never did wake up from his nap and Sam completely forgot about calling Becky on the way home.
Sam looked at the bar and she had 4 empty shot glasses in front of her. With her small frame, he was sure the alcohol was going straight her head. He brought her in for a much-needed hug. “The guy was a dick. You do deserve to have a family.” He rubbed her back to try and soothe her. When he pulled back, she locked eyes with him. She planted a soft kiss on him. Sam looked away awkwardly clearing his throat. “Um…Becky, I’m sorry but I don’t think of you like that.”
At first Dean thought it was a dumb question, until he realized that he hadn’t tried praying to him. With all of the prayers, Jack hears a day, he doubted that he would hear Dean’s, especially since he was pissed off at him. He thought he would give it a try anyway. Dean bowed his head and closed his eyes. “God—Jack? It’s Dean Winchester. I need to talk to you.” He opened his eyes and waited a moment for him to appear. Nothing. He tried again. “Jack,” he began with a rigid voice. “I need you to talk to me. You took Cas and I just want to chat about it.” Nothing. “Dammit, Jack! Get your ass down here!”
Gabrielle waved his hand dismissively. “Nah, it’ll be fine.”
Dean gestured to the bed. “You’re looking at it,” he said with barely any emotion in his voice.
Dean placed the beer on the wound. “Nah, I’ll be okay.”
She frowned and gave off a pout. “That’s boring. I thought you could at least sit in a car or something. Drive somewhere so you’re not staring at these depressing four walls.” She eyed the floral wallpaper that surrounded them.
“Did I wake you up from your beauty rest? I’m sorry; I know how much you need it.” Dean said. “Where’s Sammy?” Gabriel grumbled and stood back to let them in.
“Fuck, Cas, yes.” Dean said, and he lifted his hips without thinking, in search of friction. The angel’s hands captured the hunter’s hips and pinned them to the bed.
lord, I can handle it. Fuck me!” Cas cried out. Dean nodded and withdrew his fingers, spitting in his palm and lubing up his dick before pressing forward into Cas.
“Of course it was.”
"Sorry, there's not an extra bed with both Jo and Sam home. You can have mine, though - I'm good with the air mattress." Dean said, even if he knew that it would wreck his back. He wasn’t going to make Castiel sleep in the floor.
in that way but oh, God he wanted to be. He wanted the gentle touches and the loving kisses even if he didn’t deserve them. “Cas, please.” he whimpered. He was already hard underneath the angel’s careful ministrations, and he was starting to get desperate for friction. Cas lifted his head and surveyed Dean with a soft smile before he started to move his hands again. He kissed Dean’s chest once more before covering the man’s mouth with his own in a sweet kiss that Dean enthusiastically reciprocated. Cas hummed happily and moved his hands to cradle Dean’s face while simultaneously bringing their hips together.
Well, chalk that up for another one of Dean’s kinks he hadn’t discovered until now. He sauntered onto the stage, tipping his hat to the crowd on either side, but with the lights, Dean couldn’t really see his face. He could see his body, though, and it was perfect. Long and lithe, no abs but his stomach was toned and tan and
going to make Sam pay for this the next time they had sex when Sam decided to push in.
Dean sighed in defeat and went over to his bag, fishing out a pair of jeans and a faded Zeppelin T-shirt. He threw on a red plaid button up over it and voila, he was ready for the day. He turned back to Cas, unsurprised to find that the angel was watching him.
Ugh. He hadn’t felt this useless in a few millennia. It was definitely before he left Heaven. That stupid witch must have had some sort of insight to the best way to punish Gabriel was.
Dean was having a hard time focusing between the assault of Cas’ mouth on his neck and his hands working his shirt open. Women? Why in the hell would Cas be asking about women?
When he walked back into the room he caught what looked like the end of an argument between Sam and Gabriel. They shut up as soon as Dean entered the room. Dean didn’t say anything, just watched them closely as he sat down at the table. He took a bite of the burger and started to chew slowly, his eyes still on the pair of them. Gabriel looked irritated and Sam looked…scared? What the hell was up with that shit? Dean swallowed.
“Can’t sleep?” he whispered and Castiel shook his head. Ever since Cas had been turned into a human baby by Casmiria, the angel had kept certain aspects of being human. He didn’t really need to sleep, but if he wanted to, he could. The angel seemed to enjoy sleeping, especially when it meant that he could curl up with Dean for the night.
again, announcing their arrival on the second floor. “Not like it matters, really. Between Gabe and Sammy, we are never going to live this down.” Dean sighed, and walked straight to the room and unlocked the door, entering to find Gabriel and Sam sitting at the table, both poring over Sam’s laptop and what he presumed to be the ‘White Thorn’ website. He ignored both of them and walked to one of the two queen beds and began the process of changing Cas’ diaper. Gabriel cleared his throat and disappeared. Before Dean had even finished changing the tiny angel, Gabriel was back with a huge bag of what appeared to be burgers. Dean quickly finished what he was doing and washed his hands before making his way towards the bag of food. Unfortunately, he had forgotten to pick Cas up and the little angel started to cry. Dean sighed, but nevertheless he walked back over to the angel and picked him up before returning to his abandoned food. Gabriel smiled.
“It…well it just kinda happened. Sorry I didn’t tell you, I wasn’t sure what was going on myself.” Dean just smiled.
Castiel made a decision then. Wordlessly, he flew over to stand behind Lindsey, pressing two fingers to her forehead and catching her before she fell. Even though the girl was undoubtedly behind some of this, he didn’t doubt that she had been lied to and coerced into doing many, if not all of the things she did. If Casmiria was anything, she was a skilled manipulator, and Lindsey probably wasn’t that hard to convince. A girl that had never had anything, was suddenly offered to have infinite power and control? Castiel understood better than anyone the pull of that offer.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel fell to the side, pulling out gingerly as he did so. He waved his hand and suddenly both of them were clean. Castiel sighed and pulled Dean into his arms.
Damn, he was in this deep. Deeper than he’d ever thought. He knew he loved Cas, but he hadn’t known that he loved him this much. Enough that Dean was positive he wouldn’t be able to make it if the angel wasn’t in the picture anymore.
“Yeah, but we aren’t even sure if he’s an angel anymore, Dean!” Sam said in a harsh whisper. “Cas wasn’t!”
“Don’t worry.” Dean said as he unbuckled the baby. “I promise I won’t anything hurt you.” Cas ignored him and continued to stare up at the building. It had a sense of foreboding to it, even with its cheery exterior. Cas shivered slightly and clung to Dean, who turned to face the other two.
“Well, if that’s all.” he said, and leaned down to kiss his angel. Castiel responded by tangling his hands in Dean’s hair and opening his mouth. Dean couldn’t help but smile as the angel rolled further into Dean. He sighed and brought his hips up to meet Dean’s. Luckily, neither of them had worn anything to bed the night before (why would they? Their sex life was very healthy) so when Cas rolled his hips up against Dean’s their half hardened cocks brushed. Dean sighed and ran his hands down Cas side to grip his. He started to jerk him off slowly, watching the angel slowly come apart beneath his hands.
Dean could already feel his orgasm building. He’d been close before, when Cas was blowing him, and now he could feel his thighs shaking with the effort of holding back. He let go of Cas’ hips with one hand and grabbed the angel by the back of the head and pulled him down for a sloppy, wet, passionate kiss. Dean planted his feet onto the bed so he could continue to thrust into the angel as they kissed. Cas didn’t seem to mind, if the way he kept breaking away from the kisses to moan was any indication. Dean felt Cas move to sit up and he dropped his legs again, letting Cas set the pace again. The angel rocked on his lap with his head thrown back in ecstasy. All at once, Cas stopped moving, leaving Dean trembling and on the edge. Dean almost cried out when the sensations stopped. He opened his eyes and looked up at Cas. The angel’s eyes were hard and blazing, like a mixture of fire and ice.
Dean quickly washed the rest of him and rinsed him off gently. When Cas was clean Dean looked down.
“It’s not your fault.” Gabriel said, sitting down beside him. Sam scoffed and sat up.
“Cas?” Dean asked, not looking up at his lover.
“What?” he asked, feeling self-conscious.
“Hey, Cas. Wake up, babe.” Dean said, reaching out to shake him. Castiel didn’t respond, so Dean shook him harder. “Cas!?” he called, worry building in his stomach again. He moved closer the bed, and that was when he saw the pill bottle on the floor. “Oh, no, Cas. Cas!” Dean shook him, but there wasn’t a response. He fumbled for his phone, dialing 911 as he checked Castiel’s neck for a pulse.
“Cas, this Bobby, Sam and Jo. Sam’s adopted, but don’t bring it up. He’s really sensitive about it.”
He was prepping himself. For Dean. Dean groaned and ran his hands over Cas’ shoulders and down his back. Cas breathing stuttered and he arched into Dean’s touch. Cas started kissing all over Dean’s chest as he stretched himself, and pushing his hips down into Dean’s stomach in search of friction. Dean could see Cas unraveling under his own ministrations and was struck with a bitter feeling that it wasn’t
“I don’t have any clothes, Dean. The ones you bought me will not fit me now that I am not an infant.” Cas turned and looked at himself in the mirror. He had never noticed, but he had a very nice vessel. Jimmy Novak was a very attractive man, even to an angel’s eye.
“No, but…” he trailed off and brought Cas’ hand up to his lips, grinning as he dropped it back. Sam groaned and rolled his eyes.
“No! Well…not exactly. He just made me feel bad about it. So I’m apologizing for being a crappy person.” Sam sighed.
“’Night.” he said, taking Cas’ hand and pulling him along, after the angel had said his goodnights. They don’t talk as they make their way to their room, taking comfort in other’s presence. Before too long, Dean was opening the door and letting Castiel in.
"I love you, Cas." Dean said, and Castiel closed his eyes, holding back the tears he didn't even know were there until they threatened to spill over.
“He seems fairly confident in his abilities.” Castiel pointed out.
“Side-effects?” he growled and she nodded.
“You…you…” she said, and suddenly Dean was flying off of her and onto the couch. Dean hit, but it was a relatively soft landing. He was on his feet again immediately. Sam stood protectively in front of Andrew, who was working feverishly to get the circle cast. Casmiria’s eyes flashed as she realized what they were doing.
“Like what?” Cas asked, and Dean knew if he were to look at him, the angel would be wearing his head-tilted confused puppy expression.
Eventually, the anticipation became too much to bear. Dean stood up, crumbling up his wrapper and tossing it into the trashcan. “Let’s just go and get this over with.” he said. Surprisingly, everyone else at the table stood, following his lead.
about doing this to a baby. But it was sure as hell weird for Cas. Thankfully, it was over rather quickly and he was bundled into Dean’s arms again. Dean started to talk in a low voice, gently rocking him back and forth. The combination of Dean’s voice and the gentle rocking motion were making him….tired. Sleepy. He yawned once, and then snuggled into the hunter’s jacket and was asleep within minutes.
“You just gonna keep staring, or are you gonna…?” Gabriel broke off in a moan as Sam’s finger slid slowly inside of him. He could practically hear the smile on Sam’s face.
“Yeah.” He said. Then he leaned closer and whispered. “My hero.” Sam rolled his eyes but smiled.
“Uh, yeah, I’m just watching him for a few days so they can go on their honeymoon.” Sam pointed towards Dean. “He’s actually theirs.”
“Yeah, yeah, you’re hilarious.” Dean said. “Let’s pay for this and get out of here.” Sam grinned as Dean turned around and headed for the cart. Sam shook his head and smiled down at Gabriel as he followed Dean.
“I’m going to take care of you, Dean.” he whispered, and Dean felt Castiel push his jeans the rest of the way off. “I’m going to make love to you in a way no one else ever will.” he said. Dean whined a little as Cas’ hand gave his dick a cursory stroke in passing before running his hand down to Dean’s puckered entrance.
“I guess that’s our cue.” He glanced back at Castiel, who nodded. They both said goodnight to Andrew and made their way back to their own motel room. Dean sighed and immediately flopped down onto the bed.
Castiel’s mouth moved down and he was nipping and licking at Dean’s torso, down to his waistline. He sucked little marks into the skin there and kissed his way back up the other side. Once Castiel’s mouth found its way to his other nipple, any control that Dean had snapped.
There was something almost desperate about the kiss, as if Cas thought that he might not have many other chances to kiss Dean again. Dean flipped over, his head still on Cas’ leg and returned the kiss with equal fervor. He brought one hand to the back of Castiel’s head so that he couldn’t pull away.
So what’s the point?”
“Cas.” he knelt down and put his hand on the angel’s chest. He couldn’t detect any breathing. “No, no, c’mon, Cas, no you can’t have…no.” He put his fingers to the angel’s pulse point and could feel a faint heartbeat, but he still wasn’t breathing. “Cas, come on buddy, you have to breathe. Come on, Cas.” The heartbeat was getting fainter and Dean could tell. Gabriel and Andrew had gotten Sam up and they were all standing there watching. Dean was oblivious to them. Dean put his head on the angel’s chest. “Don’t die, Cas, please. I can’t do this without you. Please, Cas, I love you.” Silence. Gabriel and Sam exchanged a look. Dean was almost sobbing, clutching at the angel’s trench coat. Dean felt Cas’ chest rise suddenly.
had just looked at him and said,
“I’m not used to people disappearing.”
“I’m glad it worked. Now tell me why you’re here at…” he looked at the clock. “7:00 in the morning?” he asked, as Gabriel clapped his hands.
Dean shook his head. “I was just thinking too hard.” he said honestly.
“Better, I guess? I’m still having trouble with the fact that a witch named Casmiria took my baby girl to get back at you guys because you bound her powers, and that apparently she got them back by making a deal with a demon. Oh, and you aren’t actually FBI agents, you just use fake badges to get you access to the information you need to hunt down various monsters that I’ve heard my entire life are fake! Did I miss anything?” She said loudly, and then buried her face in her hands. “You know how crazy all of that sounds?” she muttered, her voice muffled by her hands. Castiel reached out and gripped her shoulder.
. And as much as he hated to admit it, he was starting to miss the angel.
“Would it hurt to hear what he has to say?” Sam asked, trying (and failing) to use a reasonable tone. Dean glared.
“What about the interviews?” Dean just shook his head.
“Think we should let them cool off for a bit?” he asked, and Cas shrugs.
“It’s alright, Dean. It’s not that I didn’t enjoy it, but we have work to do.” Dean nodded, and sighed, putting his arms around Cas and hugging him briefly.
“Andrew.” Sam said sharply.
“Why haven’t you done it before now?” he questioned Andrew. “You say you can do it, but you haven’t yet. So why not?” he raised an eyebrow. Everyone in the room turned to look at Andrew, waiting. He swallowed nervously.
They get Andrew safely out of the door and about halfway to the exit point before someone notices that they are carrying a body.
From: Castiel
Ah! It was weak, but it was there.
“I already have wings, Dean.” He said, as Dean reached to brush his hand over them.
“Hello again. Trying to get away from your friends?” Dean smiled.
saving my own ass, dimwit! What exactly do you think Casmiria will do to me if she gets me?” he yelled. “If we can do this, then she’ll be forced to leave me alone. I’ll be more powerful than her.” Sam spoke up.
“I’m going to take my time, Dean.” Cas said. “So you may as well just lie there and take it, because no amount of pleading is going to change my mind.” The angel let go of both of their cocks and leaned down to kiss Dean’s stomach. He scooted down and kissed Dean’s happy trail and then ran his tongue along the ‘v’ of Dean’s hips. Dean groaned and tried to thrust again, to no avail. Cas moved to down and started leaving light butterfly kisses on Dean’s thighs. Dean couldn’t keep still, writhing on the bed and silently willing Cas to take his talented mouth to more interesting parts of his anatomy. He wasn’t going to ask, though. He knew when Cas made up his mind there was really no changing it.
“Let me.” he said. Cas whimpered and nodded, apparently too far gone to really care. He withdrew his fingers (How had he already gotten to two?) and dropped his head to rest on Dean’s shoulder. Dean smiled to himself and dipped one finger inside of Cas, kissing the angel’s neck as he added another. Soon he was up to three and Cas was panting against his neck, seemingly fighting whether to push backwards onto Dean’s fingers or forward so he could grind against Dean’s stomach. Dean kept pressing kisses onto Cas’ shoulders and neck before he added his forth finger. Cas groaned and Dean felt sharp, neat teeth in the juncture between his neck and shoulder. Dean groaned happily, rolling his hips to get a little friction against Cas’ thigh.
Finally,
“In the days before your daughter disappeared, did you notice anything strange?” he asked. Amanda blinked.
“Did it work?” Cas asked after a while. Dean looked at him.
“What the hell?” he asked, as he climbed out of the bed. Cas started to cry, but Dean plucked him up before he had a chance to really start. Gabriel and Sam exchanged looks before turning their eyes to Dean.
“Hmm?” The angel was still caught up in the bliss of their activities. He ran his hands lazily over the hunter’s back. Dean almost lost his nerve, but he’d been holding on to this for too long already.
“Cas.” he whined, and was soothed by a kiss.
"Hey, Cas." he said. "You ready?"
“It’s a symbol from a coven in Wisconsin. They call themselves ‘White Thorn.’” Sam said, showing Dean. “I have their website pulled up.” Dean smiled and clapped his brother on the back.
Chapter 17: Andrew Williams
"Am I going to have to drive back?" Castiel asked, smiling at Dean as he sat back in the seat. Dean just smiled at him as he struggled to sit up and put himself back in his pants.
They must be there.
Chapter 5: Witnesses
“You two aren’t any less gross to me as a toddler.” Gabriel commented. Dean stuck his tongue out at him (because it would have felt wrong to flip a toddler off) and Gabriel laughed and made a kissy face at him. (Yet another expression that toddlers shouldn’t make.)  Dean pulled away from Cas with a final squeeze and went to stand beside Sam again.
He hated how it felt to have his grace dampened.
“We are, but they said to meet here first yesterday.” Sam said, looking at his watch. “We’re about an hour early. We should use this time to look around.” Dean nodded. Clutching Cas tightly, Dean set off to the other side of the house the others could call him back. He peeked in the windows and crouched down to shift through the flower bed. Standard garden (at least for a witch) : sage, black-seeded poppy, belladonna, foxglove,  monkshood, and mandrake.
“But what if I need it?” Gabriel pouted, and yeah, okay, it was kind of adorable. Gabriel’s huge toddler eyes got big and his little toddler face frowned and wow, Dean thought that Sam’s puppy-dog eyes were irresistible, but Gabriel’s toddler puppy eyes brought all of that to shame.
“The light hurts. Why are you here? Shouldn’t you be at home?” Castiel asked, confused. He’d told Dean not to come over.
“Sorry.” he said. Cas stepped forward and kissed Dean chastely.
“Sure, defend him.” Sam said, kicking the beer bottle beside him (thank god, it was empty) and going over to the little fridge and getting another one. “God, you sound like Cas. So far stuck up his ass…” Gabriel raised his eyebrow. Now Sam was trying to pick a fight.
“Ohhhh, Dean.” he moaned breathlessly, closing his eyes again. Dean pulled off and licked his head, causing the other man to thrust forward, seeking the heat of Dean’s mouth. Dean complied, swirling his tongue around the head and swallowing Cas down until he could feel him at the back of his throat. He hollowed out his cheeks and sucked gently, bobbing his head. He felt hands in his hair and Cas started to thrust shallowly into his mouth, moaning the entire time. Dean took a breath and then took all of Cas that he could at once. He started to hum, and Cas awarded him by gasping and tightening his hands into Dean’s hair.
“It doesn’t take me long to get dressed, Dean.” Cas said, and Dean could hear the smile in his voice even if he couldn’t see it.
“Thanks.” Sam said, his eyes warm. The archangel smiled.
"Oh, baby, you know I love it when you get all sarcastic on me." Dean teased right back. Castiel was silent, knowing that it would goad Dean into talking. "Fine. I left my jacket over at your house. Do you think you could bring it to work tomorrow?"
Yep, there was no denying it. Gabriel was a toddler.
“I had it. You didn’t have to go all angel mojo on him.” Cas cocked his head.
“Sometimes. But I love it.” Dean pressed another kiss to Cas’ lips. God, he didn’t think he’d ever get tired of having the liberty to do that. Cas huffed a little but kissed him back.
“You found it?” he clarified, moving to look over Sam’s shoulder. Cas leaned a little so he could see, as well. Sam nodded.
It was also nothing like the altar they had seen at Casmiria’s house. That one had been white marble. He cursed to himself. Witches were creatures of habit; they used the same ingredients, the same spells, all of it. So either Casmiria had drastically changed or it wasn’t her. God dammit.
Cas was his favorite, hell, half the time he liked the wayward angel more than he liked his own brother. But knowing that himself and admitting it to said angel were two very different things. He opened his mouth.
“Is subpar at best.” he said. “I’m guessing whoever gave you the sigils were using outdated information.” He said, not flinching at the hate in her expression. “When you changed the sigils that would allow me to enter the house, you must have removed more than you thought.” He gestured to the candle holder on the wall. “And now, I’ve eliminated they rest of your warding that was dampening my grace.” For the first time, Casmiria looked fearful. Castiel couldn’t help his smile. “And you aren’t at full power. I’m assuming it was because Bael wanted you to hold up your end of the bargin.” He said, taking a step closer. “How does it feel to be insignificant? To be the least powerful creature in this room?”
“You’re mine.” Dean said, as he pushed the unbuttoned shirt off Cas’ shoulders. Cas sat up quickly to let him pull it off and fling it to the side. Cas grabbed the hem of Dean’s shirt and pulled it off as well, so they were both bare-chested against each other.
“No.” Cas said, shaking his head. Everyone looked at him incredulously and he realized that he had just said a word. He got excited and tried to say a sentence, but much to his disappointment all that came out was babble.
Castiel hadn’t even blinked when he’d been describing it to Dean.
witch had ever used to find the
It wasn’t as smooth as the first tackle. In fact, he barely managed to grab onto her and pull her with him to the ground. She screeched in rage when she felt herself going down again. Dean landed hard, on his shoulder, and rolled away, immediately onto his feet. He glanced at Cas. The poor angel was still unmoving on the ground. What if he had acted too late?
“Oh…you were like that when I woke up. I guess the whole ‘changing back’ deal didn’t include clothes.” Dean said. Cas looked down and Dean almost swore. Morning wood? Really? As if it wasn’t awkward enough.  He turned around and pointed towards the bathroom.
“I’ll change you when we get to the room. Oh and….” He trailed off, cleared his throat, and started again. “Once you are back to…y’know, you…we never speak of this again. Okay?” Little Cas nodded and hid in Dean’s jacket again as the elevator
“I’m glad.” he said. Dean smiled, and let out a contented sigh, leaning in for one final kiss, closed his eyes. He was drifting, almost out when he remembered something that he had him snapping his eyes open.
“Cas? But..how…why is he a baby?” Dean said, staring at the child.
Dean didn't know what to say to that, so he took his duffle and put it on the bed, but not before sneaking a glance at the gorgeous tattoo that adorned Castiel's body. He wanted to look longer, but that was creepy and Castiel was pulling on a loose t-shirt and changing into plaid pajama bottoms, so Dean turned away to change into his own pajamas.
“It’s okay. We all understand.” Sam said. She nodded and grabbed a napkin from the bag and dabbed at her eyes. Dean cleared his throat and swallowed the bite of biscuit he was eating.
“Yeah, Dean?” Sam looked up from putting the baby supplies away.
Gabriel tried to roll away from Sam, but the man wasn’t having it. He pulled him flush against his chest, as if he could sense that he was trying to leave.  Gabriel sighed and went limp, knowing it was useless to try and get away from his sasquatch-esque hunter.
“You’ll be the first to know.” Dean answered. She cleared her throat and grabbed a pen.
“Seriously, Sam? I think it’s pretty clear who did this! Casmiria’s back, and somehow she’s got her powers back, or she’s got another witch doing her bidding, or she’s just kidnapping and killing people for the hell of it, who knows!”
“No.” he said, almost growling. Dean’s breath hitched at the angel’s tone and he let his hand rest where Castiel had placed it. Suddenly, the angel was moving, climbing over Dean and straddling his thighs, conveying without words that Dean should stay still.
“What…uhh…what do you want us to do for you?” he asked nervously. Gabriel was behind him, close enough that Sam could feel his body heat and the presence of the archangel (although he had just held Sam down against his will) was enough to give him strength to sit up and face her. She turned towards Sam a smiled at him.
“I don’t know. It’s sealed; we’ll have to get Sam to hack into it whenever he gets done screwing your brother.”
“Alright, ladies, and the few gentlemen that remain in the audience, I want to clap your hands and welcome to the stage our very own Gadreel. A pretty man with soft brown hair made his way onto the stage to numerous cheers. He was wearing a stained wife beater and a pair of blue jeans that slung low on his hips. He had on boots and what looked like a sledgehammer was slung over his shoulder. Well. Construction worker was a new thing, but he couldn’t deny that he liked what this man was selling. When he started to dance, Dean scooted up closer to the stage, dollar bills in hand. Maybe a man had been exactly what he needed. He tucked the money into Gadreel’s G-string, flushing when the man winked at him. He leaned down close, to whisper into his ear. “You’re in for a treat, sitting there.” He said. “Jimmy is doing something special tonight.” He stood back up and winked again, going to the other side of the stage to collect the tips from the girls waving the money at him, leaving Dean a little turned on and a lot confused.
“No, of course not. After 4 weeks you can take a pregnancy test to find out.”
“It went rather well. They approved of the pregnancy, which is why I have this,” Castiel beamed as he pointed to the mason jar. It had a floating blue fog inside of it with some other herbs.
Dean crossed his arms. “Why did it take you 4 1/2 months to tell me, then?”
“You think?” Sam deadpanned.
It took Dean about an hour to scrub the floors clean and put the herbs back in the cabinet as he found them. It was well into the night before he treaded to his bedroom. He touched the handle to his door, thinking he was home free when he heard his brother call his name in the darkness. “Dean?”
“Yeah the sweatshirt hides a lot.”
Dean thought, but he had to be smart about this. He couldn’t walk up to the angel demanded answers he had to be level-headed about it. He didn’t want Jack to hear about him snooping around and coercing his angels. “No, don’t worry about it. I’ve got a plan,” he assured her.
Eventually, Dean entered the kitchen, dressed for work. His attire was a greasy grey t-shirt with the name of the shop faded across the front. Sam had prepared him a travel mug of ginger tea to drink throughout the morning. He passed it off to him. “Here. This should help with the nausea.”
She was really happy with Noah, and Sam didn’t want to ruin that, even though it wasn’t helping ease his fears about abandonment with the twins.
“That’s okay, I can be such a klutz.” Sam heard a
the angels decide to clip Cas’ wings and kill your baby then and
“Good. Sam do you think you’ll be able to handle this on your own?”
“And what about the twins? Don’t you think he’ll be a little concerned when you suddenly have kids?”
Sam shrugged. “He could be busy. Just give it time, he’ll show.”
Sam sighed, heavily. “I get it. But just know that I don’t blame you.”
Dean nodded. “Thanks.” He walked over to the crib and touched the angel wings that were painted on the wall. He couldn’t believe that his baby would be half-angel. Will probably be just as stubborn as his dad. Both of his dads. As he thought about his angelic child, it gave Dean a pretty swift kick to the ribs. “Ooof,” he groaned softly.
“For now, but they’ll be back,” Cas said. “We gotta get you somewhere else.”
Castiel grabbed a wobbly Dean, for he was about to fall over. “Woah, there. Let’s get you in the car, okay?”
“I’m pretty sure watching your pregnant brother while he is on bed rest isn’t in the brother manual,” Dean joked.
“We’re going to find out. Let’s go.”
When they got to the bunker Sam parked in the garage and entered through the back entrance. It was fewer steps for Dean and an easier route to his bedroom.
Sam thought that was kinda strange but if Dean wasn’t worried then he wasn’t going to say anything.
Sam huffed a laugh. “It’s okay.”
“Yeah, come here.” Dean patted the bed.
“That’s not going to happen” Dean said, reassuringly. “She may have…issues…but she’s not a flake. She really cares for those babies and obviously cares for you. There is no way that she is going to abandon her family.”
Cas nodded. “Yes, I’ll be here. But Dean, we need to talk…”
“I—uh—I want to have a baby with you,” Cas repeated, this time a little more hesitantly.
“Where are you going?”
She heard him but decided to stay anyway. They stayed up and talked about Dean until Cas finally came home. “Cas!” Sam exclaimed. “Did you not hear our prayers?”
“My friend is in trouble, so I’m gonna help her.”
Dean continued putting mustard on his turkey sandwich. “I think I saw her carrying some clothes to the laundry room earlier.”
What Sam was saying was beginning to resonate with Dean. Breaking into Heaven with no plan was not the smartest thing to do, especially in his condition.
“I didn’t give you much of a choice.”
“Yeah they are,” he said mid yawn.
Dean enjoyed the casual conversation with the girls as he ate his breakfast. It wasn’t the worst thing he’d had but he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t jealous of everyone enjoying their greasy breakfast. He salivated every time Claire ate a piece of bacon or bit into a buttered croissant. His baby wasn’t even born yet and he was pissed at it.
Dean took a breath. “Cas, listen to what I’m saying to you. I’m pregnant with our baby. I don’t care if it’s a Nephilim or a demon or whatever. It’s ours and dammit I love you!” Dean was now inches away from Cas’s face breathing heavily. Cas could feel the Dean’s stomach in between them. He looked down at it and touched it. Dean could see a slight smile twinge across Cas’s lips. “You are right about one thing,” Dean whispered. “I should’ve told you sooner. But I want you in this with me.”
Jody took a seat in the library while Sam gave her a beer. “He’s really going through it, isn’t he?” she commented. She couldn’t stop thinking about how vulnerable Dean was. She wasn’t use to seeing the elder Winchester so miserable and helpless.
“I can’t reverse spells. As long as you’re not hurt, then there is nothing I can do about it. The witch that did this to you must have been a very powerful one.”
“I bet you wish that piece of toast was a sausage egg and cheese sandwich,” Claire smirked at Dean’s door.  She plopped herself down at the foot of the bed, just where Jody sat minutes before. She then stole his piece of toast from his plate since as she figured he wasn’t going to eat it. She too grimaced at the flavorless bread but continued nibbling on it. “So, what are your plans for today?”
“Hi-ya kid,” Gabriel smirked at Jack. “I was hoping we could talk. Archangel to God. Hope you don’t mind if I don’t call you Dad,” he joked
Castiel opened up the fridge to grab some milk when he heard Dean suck in his breath. He turned around and Dean’s face was twisted. He had a hand on his bump. “Are you okay?” Cas asked concerned.
Becky let it all register and then turned to Sam. “Why did you wait so long?” she asked Sam.
“A pregnancy test, I could’ve sworn I saw one when we had all of those hunters living with us,” Sam said as he dumped contents of one cabinet in the sink. “Found it!” It was hiding far in the back behind a large bottle of mouth wash.
Sam continued to worry about Becky’s new boyfriend. After their first date, they hit it off right away. His name was Noah, and he was a young pediatrician, who just received his doctorate. He was fairly new to town and was eager to meet new people. After their coffee shop date, Noah texted her immediately to make plans to see her again.
“Very funny, where’s your other offspring?”
Dean shook his head. “Doesn’t matter. What does it matter?”
She then remembered all of the blood that was still on her bathroom floor right now. She lost an immense amount of blood. She was sure it probably looked like a crime scene in there. “Right…,” she trailed off.
Dean touched his hand. “Hey, it’s okay. You’ll have plenty of chances to connect with the baby. Any type of movement or flutter I feel, I’ll make sure you feel it too,” Dean told him as he leaned in to kiss him.
“I didn’t,” he said as he yawned. The dark circles around his eyes seemed more prominent than last night.
“Because we don’t know what we’re getting ourselves into. If angels want her dead, I’m sure demons aren’t too far off. I’m trying to learn as much as I can so I’m prepared,” he explained to him.
The clock was ticking and Dean needed to find answers before it was too late. The problem was that he could feel his baby getting more and more agitated the longer he was stressed. He couldn’t even pick up a book about angels without feeling like his baby had it out for him. With that being in the case Sam did a lot of the heavy lifting. They agreed that they needed to locate Gabriel so he could keep up with his side of the deal.
“I can’t imagine he’s going to be thrilled with the idea of us dating or whatever we’re doing.”
Sam looked over to Dean who was leaning on the door frame. “Eileen and I had a scare once,” he said sheepishly. Deep in the cabinet was the box that held the second pregnancy test. “Here, take the test.”
She quickly looked up from playing with her daughter a little perplexed. “What?”
“But this is a date,” Becky said plainly.
Castiel couldn’t take his eyes off Sam’s son who was slowly drifting asleep after being fed. “I can’t wait until we have our own baby.”
“Yeah, and if it’s okay, I think you should come home to the bunker,” Sam piped up.
“Who?”
She quickened her step to keep up with him. “Wait! I’ve changed! I’m not the same Becky. I’ve been working on myself and I would love it if you just gave me one more chance.”
Becky and Sam began to see each other a lot more. He would see her at the gym, so they would typically go to a coffee shop or bar afterwards to chat. Sam was surprised at how much they had in common. They both loved literature. Often, they gabbed about some the greats as well as some of newer authors on the market. Becky would give him insider information about upcoming books coming from her publishing company. Exotic cuisine was also a topic they talked about frequently. As someone who would eat in diners and cheap restaurants, exotic cuisine was always something Sam craved. Dean was pretty content with his cheeseburgers, pie and American fare. His idea of eating exotic was Americanized Chinese food.
Dean ignored Sam’s questions and asked one of his own. “Do you remember how we summoned, Chuck a few years back?”
Dean licked his lips and looked away from the former angel. He shook his head and then reared his hand back and slapped him across the face. Becky was heard gasping at the sound of his hand hitting Cas’ cheek. Cas touched his cheek and it was searing with pain. There was hurt behind his eyes but not as much as Dean’s. Without any words spoken, Dean turned on his heels and left the library.
Sam smiled down at his son as he picked him up. “Hey little buddy!” he gave him a kiss on the forehead. “How did you sleep?” Ethan perked up slightly at the sight of his dad but was mostly half asleep. Sam continued to rock him as he looked over at his daughter who was being fussy while being changed. “Someone doesn’t want their diaper changed.”
“I’m sorry.” She said, pulling away. Cas looked relieved. “It’s just…I’m so scared. I just want my daughter back, and to forget this ever happened.” She sniffed and wiped at her eyes.
“From being human. He will still have some…human traits. Such as eating, sleeping, using the bathroom. Things like that.” She wiped her hands off on her long skirt. “I’ll show you out. And remember, Dean Winchester,” She turned to him and raised her finger. “Keep your word, otherwise being an infant will be the last of your worries.” Dean rolled his eyes.
“Well, we are going to have to take you back anyway. See, she turned our friend.” Dean nodded at Cas. “Into a baby and in order to change him back we had to agree to come and get you.” Dean explained. Andrew laughed.
“I- I got a note…from whoever took Katie.” She took a deep breath.
“I said, much better than a Doctor Sexy marathon. Don’t you agree?” Dean laughed sleepily.
Castiel had a tattoo that covered up the scars from his insubordination. He’d shown it to Dean once, soon after they’d met. The first time Dean had invited him over for the holidays. He hadn’t even noticed the scars at first, due to the huge pair of black wings that dominated most of the skin. It was one of the most detailed tattoos that Dean had ever seen. He could see the attention that the artist had paid to making sure that every feather laid perfectly. Dean hadn’t been able to look away.
Dean’s expression changed to one of disbelief. “Seriously?” he asked. They were alone and Castiel wanted to watch Doctor Sexy?
Castiel pulls Dean closer, stretching out on the bed and pulling the hunter until he was hovering, their lips still connected even as Dean ran his hands over Castiel’s stomach, untucking his shirt to get at the skin underneath. Castiel’s own hands wind tight around his hunter, one hand tangled in his short hair and the other clutching at the soft, vintage t-shirt that he was fond of wearing to sleep in. (Vaguely, Castiel was aware that this was one of Dean’s favorite bands, but he couldn’t remember the name.)
“I think he stayed up all night and just…crashed when Amanda woke up.” Sam shrugged, apparently not very worried. Dean shrugged and took another bite.
It showed in the way he clung to Castiel as they moved together; it showed in the soft moans the angel swallowed with softer kisses; In the breathy sighs that fell across each other’s skin and in the sweet words that hovered in the air between them.
“What the hell?” he asked, gathering up his little angel and moving to open the back door.
“I know. But women were all you were with for so long, Dean. And I know I can’t…” Dean shut him up with a kiss.
Chapter 20: Witches and Rituals
“You really think I would put Cas in danger?” Dean growled, stepping close to the archangel. Gabriel stood his ground.
“Now then.” She said. “It’s simple. I want you to find this man and bring him back here.” She said, handing Dean the piece of paper. He looked down and saw the name Andrew Williams written, along with an address.
“Yeah, the room got a little stuffy. I just stepped out for a minute.” Dean said. The elevator came and they climbed aboard. The woman was obviously interested, and if it hadn’t been for Cas, Dean would have probably gone for it. She got off first, winking at him, saying “Room 132” as she stepped off. Dean shook his head.
“You do deserve us, Dean.” Cas murmured, leaning down to kiss Dean again. “One way or another, I’m going to make you believe that.” Dean shivered in anticipation as Cas’ teeth grazed his earlobe.
Castiel, as promised, was leaning against Dean's car. He looked up as Dean rounded the corner, a smile playing on his lips.
“Can we do that now?” he asked, looking up at Dean. The hunter laughed and pulled Cas close to him.
that was making the angel feel like that. The hunter found the abandoned bottle of lube on the bed and spread a little over his own fingers, then moved his hand to join Cas’ at the angel’s entrance.
Gabriel eating candy?)
“Find anything interesting?” Dean asked. Sam shrugged.
“Th-there’s th-this spell. I-It’s c-called the Black Cord Binding Spell.” His eyes flickered to Sam, then back to Dean. “It’s only supposed to be used if you have no other choice; it’s incredibly powerful and disastrous to get wrong. It requires a very powerful witch. But I can do it.” Sam and Dean exchanged looks. Binding Casmiria’s powers…that was almost as good as killing her. “As long as the knots stayed tied, the binding spell holds.” Sam spoke.
“I hope this isn’t becoming a habit.” He said, his voice muffled by the pillow. Dean smiled and silently agreed. He was tired of Sam waking him up after glorious sex. Until this case, it hadn’t really been a problem.
“That gives us…what 48 hours in which he could’ve been turned? Not a huge time period but its witches so we don’t know for sure when the spell was cast. It could have just taken this long to work.” Sam shook his head. “God, I hate witches.” Dean came out of the bathroom.
Needless to say, Sam’s first reaction upon discovering that his archangel boyfriend had become a toddler was to go and tell Dean. Sam had barely had time to be thankful that he and Gabriel hadn’t done anything to warrant falling asleep naked before he was out of the door, intent on waking up his brother. It was an emergency, after all. Cas had popped in on them earlier and relayed that Dean, while upset, was perfectly fine. And after such an action-packed (or lack thereof) day, Sam and Gabriel had went to bed after sharing nothing but a long goodnight kiss.
“It’s just…that guy didn’t know what hit him. You were great, babe.” Dean nuzzled into the angel’s neck.
“I asked…” he growled, his hands working to unbutton Dean’s shirt.  “If you miss women.”
that it made him see stars.
"Hello, Dean." Castiel said, unable to hide the smile in his voice. God, he was absolutely pathetic.
“Come on , Cas. You’ve got to be hungry!” Dean said, exasperated. But little Cas was adamant about not taking that bottle.
“He’s still going to help us! I just don’t think that going out and getting drunk is going to help this situation much! We should act
He found it. Behind the couch, out of initial sight, was a black stone altar. It was draped in purple silk and was covered in black candles. It practically screamed ‘evil’.
It took a little bit of work (along with some angelic help), but finally they managed to gather all the components of what Dean had helpfully named the ‘Witch Molotov’. Finally, they had a solid plan to get Casmiria off the map for good.
“So, if I say no, where are you going to go?” Castiel asked. Dean looked afraid, and shrugged.
“Thank you, Dean.” Cas beamed. He pursed his lips, seeming to think for a minute and then his brow furrows. “That was sarcasm, wasn’t it?” Dean nodded, even though the quilt was still surging through his body. Cas’ face fell slightly.
“Come on. Sammy’s got a case.”
“Dean, did I do something to upset you?” He asked.
Just then, the snapping of a twig alerted Dean to the presence of someone else. He whipped around, pulling his gun from his holster in the same moment, pointing it at the intruder.
“Cas? Come on, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it, I was just mad.” Silence. Dean rested his head against the door.
He knew he was in so far over his head.
He didn’t have time to think beyond that because at that moment, he flew across the room towards Andrew, who had just managed to get the circle cast. He was met by invisible force acting from the opposite way and looked around to see that it was none other than Gabriel that had kept him from crashing into the man. Dean fell straight to the floor, landing on his ass. He struggled to stand because the only two left standing were him and Gabriel, as Sam and Cas were both unconscious. Gabriel eye’s flashed as he threw Casmiria back using his angel mojo.
“Don’t go all scientist-y on being naked, Cas.” Dean said. Gabriel rolled his eyes at the two of them. Just then the bathroom door opened, revealing a wet-haired Sam with a towel around his waist. The two brothers locked eyes for a minute and then Dean looked away, unable to hide the shame on his face.
“Yeah, Dean only it’s not exactly easy to kill an angel.” Dean opened his mouth to remark but Sam cut him off. “What do you think, Gabriel?” Gabriel shrugged.
From: Castiel
“Oh, Dean.” he moaned into the hunter’s ear. Dean groaned and started to work his hand faster, using the other to push the slacks the rest of the way down. Castiel lifted his legs and let them slide off onto the floor. Dean adjusted his hand position and started to work Cas in earnest, riding the wave of moans that Cas was pouring into his ear. Suddenly, Cas put his hand on Dean’s and pulled him away.
“It’s just an expression, Cas.” The angel nodded slowly.
“Already taken care of.” A voice behind them said. Simultaneously, they all turned towards the door. Sam was standing there, a fast-food bag in his hand. “We woke up, figured everyone would be hungry.” he said, walking up and putting the bag down on the table. Gabriel was behind him, sucking on a cherry sucker. He didn’t greet them other than a small wave before climbing onto Sam’s lap.
his body with his mouth and hands and Dean didn’t deserve it, he didn’t deserve any of it. He was a fuck-up. A selfish prick who was moody and reckless and he wasn’t worthy of the way Cas was touching him right now. The angel leaned down and kissed Dean soundly, tilting his head slightly to deepen it before he moved his head to Dean’s ear.
“Cas.” he said, breathlessly, his hand going to cup his face.
“Not really. You?” Dean shook his head.
“I didn’t know how you would take it.” She explained, sitting the tray on the table.
“Dean. Please.” Castiel whimpers. “I need you. Now.” At night, Dean had found out Cas wanted to take his time. But morning sex was always rough and quick and passionate. Dean nodded and moved to grab his bottle of lube and a condom from his bag. He spread the lube across his fingers and rubbed it to warm it up before spreading it around Cas’ entrance. He felt Castiel take a deep breath as he pushed one finger in slowly. Cas groaned and pushed against the finger.
“Ditch them. Let’s get out of here.” She said, leaning forward again. Dean used his grip on her hips to keep her away.
“Bye, Bitch.”
“Right. No, I can do this.” He said, twisting his hands together.
“Yeah, Cas. Some toddler-friendly food, too. He can’t just eat what we do. He’s a growing boy.” Dean grinned at Gabriel and received a middle finger in return. “Now, that’s no way to talk to a grown up.”
“That’s why I came here.  I hoped you two would know.” Dean pursed his lips, thinking. Sam spoke up.
Gabriel knocked gently before he opened the door to their shared room. He didn’t want to scare Sam by just barging in. Sam was seated on one of the beds with his head between his hands and a beer bottle beside his foot. Gabriel sighed and walked over to him, placing a hand on his ginormous shoulder. Sam looked up and then leaned his head over to trap Gabriel’s hand.
“How long did it take you to find her?” Cas asked, startling Dean. He had almost forgotten he was back there, even though Cas was still touching him. Andrew glanced over Dean’s shoulder at the angel and then looked back down.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean.” he whispered. Dean ignored him. It was going to happen, they were going to get her and stop all of it.
“Shut up.” He attempted to extract himself from the still-sleeping angel, but Cas was having none of it. When Dean tried to pull his hand away, Cas clung to it harder, rolling slightly and mumbling incoherent words. The more Dean pulled, the more Cas held on. Sam and Gabriel were watching the confrontation and trying their best not to laugh. (they were totally laughing) Dean knew to get away he was going have to wake the sleeping angel.
“I’d love to see what happened when you get jealous.” Cas hummed, still riding the high from his recent orgasm. Dean sighed.
“My pleasure.” He said, and curled in closer to Dean.
“You’re trying to distract me. Like you always do when you’re feeling insecure.” Dean tells him, rolling his hips so that Castiel could feel the hunter’s hardness against his stomach - Castiel’s grip tightened on Dean’s hips in response. “But since you don’t like to talk about it…” Dean leans down, capturing Castiel’s nipple in his mouth and sucking - Castiel arches his back, crying out in surprise – “I thought I’d show you instead. How much you mean to me.”
“Hello, again, boys. My name is Casmiria. How can I help you?”
“Dean, we aren’t even sure if it is her.” Cas kissed Dean’s hair. “And if it is, then we will find some way to stop her.” He sounded so confident, so sure, that Dean believed him. They had always found a way before, hadn’t they? This time wouldn’t be any different. The bad guys would lose. They always did. Dean sighed and let his head rest against Cas’ chest.
that. Castiel started to work his fingers faster, hitting that spot each time he pushed in.
“I’m not willing to risk our lives to save that sap.” Dean hissed in a very final way. He turned and walked away from them, signaling that the conversation was over. He heard Sam sigh and say something to Gabriel, but he didn’t quite catch it. He turned around to see that Cas had followed him, and was suddenly very, very close.
“Come here, baby. Let me hold you.” Dean said, and Cas scooted closer. “No, turn around. Put your back against my chest.” Castiel complied, and turned around, leaning back against Dean. The man wrapped his arms around Cas and rested his head on the other man’s shoulder, sighing contentedly. Cas leaned his head back and nuzzled Dean’s cheek and put his hands on Dean’s, lacing their fingers together. They sat in silence for a few minutes, just enjoying being close to each other. Castiel raised their interlaced hands to his mouth and kissed him.
“Go to hell.” he muttered, and then looked at Amanda. “I thought you left.” he said. She smiled, looking a little nervous.
“Agents Coulson and Fury. We’re here about your daughter’s disappearance.” Dean said, flashing her a smile. She blinked in surprise.
“Alright.” he smiled. Cas sighed contentedly and Dean kissed his head. He felt sleep tugging at him and he surrendered to it, falling asleep blissfully with his fiancé in his arms.
Dean highly doubted it, but anything was possible, right?
It wasn’t
“How do you know who I am?” She asked quietly.
“What?” Dean asked, blinking in confusion. Castiel threaded his hand through Dean’s hair and pulled it back sharply, not enough to hurt, but Dean gasped anyway as the angel started to attack his neck with nips and kisses.
“He was trying to pick a fight.” Gabriel said. “He wanted you to rise to bait. He didn’t really mean what he said. How could he? The man drinks whiskey like its water.” Gabriel started stroking his hand down Sam’s back. “He only said it because he knew you would grab the bait.” Sam stood up so quickly the change in the mattress almost threw Gabriel.
He starts the car and revs the engine, counting on the others to take the hint. Sam is first, climbing into the back without a word. Cas glances over at him and then follows suit. That leaves Gabriel and Dean is fully prepared to leave him here.
“Find Andrew. Now.” Cas nodded and was gone, leaving nothing but the sounds of wings.
"Of course." Castiel went around to the passenger side of the Impala, climbing inside. Dean would never get over just how good Castiel looked in his passenger seat. Dean followed suit, starting up the car and driving away without a second thought.
“And all the perks that come with it.” Dean said. So Gabriel was most likely going to have to eat and sleep and poop and they would have to put up with him. He was going to be insufferable, Dean knew that. He was already insufferable as a fully-grown angel – Dean wasn’t entirely prepared to experience him as a toddler-angel. Even if he did have ability to understand them, that didn’t mean he was going to listen to them. Dean was pulled out of his own thoughts by a loud, sad sigh from Sam. Dean put a hand on his shoulder.
Becky sat up in her bed as she thought about her answer. “I guess I wasn’t. It’s no secret that I like your brother. He’s just been so great to me…especially lately. But I knew that I couldn’t have him, that’s why I went on that date. I was really trying to have that same feeling with someone new.” She clicked her tongue. “Then he had to say what he said—and I felt hopeless. That I would never feel that unless I took control of the situation. Unfortunately, there wasn’t much control since I was super drunk,” she chuckled. “I thought if I could have Sam’s baby—a family--then my life wouldn’t be that bad. That was until I woke up the next morning and realized what I did was idiotic. I honestly was relieved after I took the pregnancy test and it was negative. It wasn’t until I found Sam getting sick at the gym that I realized the spell did in fact work. But you have to understand, this is something I’ve been working on for years. Just because I can do something doesn’t mean I should.”
“It doesn’t matter,” Dean mumbled. “It’s not like this baby is going to live much longer?” He said glumly.
“Let me guess, he had a blowout last night?” Dean chuckled.
Sam winced as he swallowed. His throat was sore from the stomach acid passing through his esophagus. “Uh, dizziness and nausea mostly,” he told her. “Started about a week or two after I last spoke to you.”
“Sure, you can, but we still need to talk about Cas.”
Becky politely smiled back and shared the same energy. “Thank you!” she said as he walked past her desk and into Dr. Char’s office. The room was always freezing! Becky wasn’t sure if she purposely kept it this way as some sort of therapist tactic or if the heat was broken. Either way, Dr. Char had blankets in the room which Becky always took it upon herself to use.
“Hey, it could be worse,” she said.
Sam waited until she fell asleep for him to leave. He made a note to come back first thing in the morning to spend time with her. When he got back to the bunker, Dean was pacing in the library, anxiously waiting for his brother to come home. The second he heard the door open, he rushed to the bottom of the staircase. “Hey! What happened? Is she okay?”
“I also think it would be great idea if you moved in with me,” Sam told her. She was speechless and simply stared at Sam. “I mean with us having 2 kids, I think it would be best to have us living under the same roof. We can tag team them,” he joked.
Dean closed his eyes. He could feel is heart thumping inside of him, as if it was about to explode. He firmly placed his hands down on the counter as if he was bracing himself. “I’m in love with you, too,” Dean heard himself admit. “I guess I’ve always been in love with you and I was afraid to admit to myself. I’m sorry, Cas.”
Dean was stubborn. He was a fighter. If there was a threat, he was trained to go after it and kill it. He was not use to sitting on the sidelines. His baby was kicking up a storm inside him. It was a not so gentle reminder that he had more than just him that he needed to take care of.
“Dean! You’re awake!” She got out her penlight and began to look into his eyes.
“It’s fine,” she said dismissively.
The bunker was in need of day to day supplies like cereal, meat and veggies for the kitchen. But Sam had personally ran out of shampoo and conditioner. He also told Becky to go and get some snacks she would like to have in the bunker. With that they went their separate ways and told they would meet up at the register when they were done. Becky was fond of this plan to spend some time away from Sam.
“What?” Dean asked confused.
“Please sit next to me.”
Dean examined the box. “Hmm, I don’t think I’ll need them.”
As she perused snack aisle, she heard a familiar shrill voice call out her name. “Becky?! Becky Rosen, is that you?” When she turned around a tall brunette was making her way to her with a baffled look. It was Jocelyn Caruso, a former classmate of Becky’s, of who she never got along with. “What are you doing here?” She brought her in for a forced hug. “I haven’t seen you since the reunion in Vegas. What are you doing here in Kansas?” She then took a beat and scoffed. “Don’t tell me you’re living here.”
He lowered himself in the chair in the library with a grunt. “Because, I didn’t want you think that I wasn’t supportive of your new boyfriend,” he panted. With all of the pain he was in, he found himself out of breath, as if he ran a marathon. “I wasn’t exactly on board with you getting a boyfriend so close to my due date and I thought that you would get so fixated on your new boyfriend that you would abandon us.”
He wrapped up at Becky’s apartment and head back to the bunker. When he entered the library, Sam was sitting there with his laptop out. He looked up at his brother who was heavy breathing. “You good?”
Sam repeated his actions with each contraction he felt. Eventually, his first baby slid out of him and into Cas’ arms. He was prepared with a towel and dried him off and placed him on Sam’s chest. Instantly, Becky and Sam cried at their beautiful baby boy. He had gorgeous brown hair and brown eyes. Wailing in the new world, Becky shushed her son. “It’s okay. You’re okay,” she cooed.
Sam raised his eyebrows and blinked slowly. He then looked at Becky in a way that he hadn’t in a long time. Disgusted. “So, you did this? And the spell…you tried to have a baby with me?” he began to slowly back away.
Sam looked back to the store where Dean disappeared to use the restroom. He was still nowhere to be seen. “Not great. He keeps talking about these pains that he’s having. I’m not sure what it is but it can’t be good.”
Alex stepped out to run the tests. Sam had stepped out as well to change and feed the twins and Jody joined him to help.
“Fine.”
“You just care about protecting the relationship, right?”
“It’s not impossible if you’ve had unprotected sex as a woman.” Sam walked out of kitchen and Dean followed.
“Please don’t tell me you punched your pregnant brother.”
It made sense, so Dean placed the test back in the bag and made a note to hide it in his room later. “Alright, where’s the turkey?”
“We’ll protect her at all costs,” she said with a smile.
Becky put her hands up, surrendering to show she had no weapons on her. “I’m just here to see Sam.”
“So then how do you feel?”
Sam never looked at it that way. He was sad that he didn’t think he was going to have the traditional apple pie life that he longed for, but Becky was right. It may not be what he envisioned, but that doesn’t mean it still couldn’t be his.
Jody took the wand and glided it over Dean’s bump. “Are you sure you know what you’re doing?” he asked her while she looked intently at the monitor. More confused than knowledgeable.
Instantly, Jocelyn got offended. She was head of the committee. “I mean they only gave me $500, there wasn’t much I could do.”
Dean swallowed hard before answering. “Yeah, this room is as much yours as it is mine.”
That was all Cas needed to hear. He inserted himself into Dean and Dean instantly moaned with pleasure. He had never been on the receiving end of sex, and he was loving every minute of it. And hearing Castiel enjoying this too was driving Dean mad. After a few thrusts and ear biting Castiel exploded inside of Dean.
Dean couldn’t help but chuckle at that. “Is that so? And who made that order?” he asked but she didn’t answer his question. “I just wanna talk, that’s it. And then me and friend will be on our merry way.”
“You were lightyears away, weren’t you? Do you wanna talk about it?”
Now Cas understood. He took a seat on the edge of the bed. “Dean, I did what I had to--,”
Cas toyed with the crust on his sandwich. He wasn’t a fan of crust. He learned this the first time he was human when he made himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. He furrowed his brow. “I’m not sure I like us working with an archangel.”
She groaned, “That’s what I’m afraid of.”
“Rightfully so! She impregnated you without your consent!”
Becky returned the smile but her attention soon went to her phone, which she had the intention of putting screen side down, but wanted to see any texts or calls from that came in.
“You’re going straight to bed. Cas can do all of those things,” Dean said. “If you’re going to fight these angels then you need your rest. We need you sharp,” Dean said from one hunter to another.
“I think the whole point of bed rest is to literally rest in bed.” Dean was suddenly struck by an idea. “But I could rest in a car,” he said with a sly grin.
“Yeah, I’m not too keen on right now either, but can’t we come to some kind of resolution? There’s no need for a trial or anything,” Dean tried. “Right?”
Sam gently put his arm around Becky and brought her closer to his hip. He cleared his throat, “Oh, we’re still going strong,” he said with a broad smile.
That next morning Dean woke feeling a million times better than he had been. He had virtually no back pain. When he turned over in bed Castiel was lying next to him. Because Cas is an angel, he doesn’t sleep, but he does enjoy resting next to Dean and watching him sleep. “Morning,” Dean whispers to him. “I see you healed my back. Thanks for that.”
“But good luck to you! I’m sure the right guy is out there,” he encouraged.
Eagerly Dean said, “So? Is he going to be okay?”
“Is the baby ours?” he asked her.
Dean was not amused. “How long?”
Dean’s back was giving him more trouble than they all anticipated. He was 30 weeks pregnant and his lower back was not letting up. No matter if he was lying in the bed or sitting down he could not get comfortable. Jody did a check up on the baby and explained that she wouldn’t be able to steal any pain medication for him since he was pregnant. Cas offered to take his pain away everyday but he was too stubborn to accept help.
“Fuck it,” he said, as he took the test out and peed on it.
That brought him back to reality. Where was Cas? He fished in his pajama pants pocket and looked at his phone. There was an unread text message from him:
Dean picked up on the struggle and without asking, grabbed Ethan. Sam thanked him with his eyes and started to rock Charlotte on his shoulder, calmly shushing her. “It’s okay, Char. What’s wrong?” he said as he bounced her up and down. His palm cradled her diaper and he felt a slight dampness. “I think she needs to be changed,” he told Dean. “Do you mind watching Ethan for a second?”
Breathing heavily Dean said, “Wow, that was better than I expected.”
“If that’ll make you more comfortable then that’s what we’ll do,” he told her. He then reached across the table and rubbed small circles with his thumb across her hand. The butterflies in her stomach came back.
Sam pointed his fork at his brother. “Not a word,” he warned.
Gabriel tsked before answering. “When the trial is over and
Castiel, confused, looked him up and down. “Uhh, sure. But where is Dean?”
Sam asked Cas to run to the store to grab some of the necessities that they were missing. Dean had also begged him to pick up an apple pie. He was about to walk into the bunker when he was approached by a friend of his, Ruth. She was an angel who cared about Castiel. She began to worry about him when she hadn’t heard from him in a while. “Castiel! I found you!” she said relieved. “Where have you been?”
“Wait, you don’t have your wings anymore?” Cas didn’t even have to say anything for Dean to know the answer. Dean pinched the bridge of his nose and heaved a heavy sigh “You’ve got to be kidding me. So, if something happens to our kid, we can’t even rely on you to heal them or me.”
“It isn’t.”
Claire looked over to him every time he made the slightest movement or groan. Getting him back to Jody’s wasn’t the solution. There was something very wrong with him and he needed to seek medical attention. She passed the exit to Jody’s house. Dean noticed. “Woah, where are you going? Jody’s place is-,”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Whatever. I don’t have any clothes.” All of Dean’s clothes were too big on his new slimmer figure. His pants were more difficult and was constantly hiking them up. Hardly the best way to hunt.
“Exactly, best to go to the top,” Dean said with the slightest bit of optimism.
Cas refused to sit down. “What’s going on, Dean?”
“Now.” Sam took a seat across from his brother at long the library table.
Without thinking, Dean grabbed Castiel’s hand and said, “Nothing is going to happy to our baby. I can promise you that.”
Sam had taken the opportunity while his kids were sleeping to fold laundry in the kitchen. He had one eye on the baby monitor and the other on his delicates. He was hoping the twins would sleep a little longer than normal to give him the chance to take a nap himself. He felt like he was running on fumes nowadays. He longed for when he got to go back to work to get a break from the twins and just get out of the bunker. Sam’s thoughts were interrupted when he saw his brother walk through the kitchen. He was sluggish and walked as if he was in a daze. Hair was spiked in every different direction and skin had lost its usual glow.
For the life of Dean, he couldn’t understand how he could be so mad at Cas and miss him so much. As if he was a part of him that he couldn’t function without him. Being in Cas’ arms felt right. It felt like home. Their lips met a little clumsily, but Cas grabbed Dean’s face to steady it. “I love you, Dean.”
“You sure you don’t want to take a sick day?”
“Is that what I have to look forward to?” Dean joked.
“Why not stay here for a few years while you get your funds in order and then you can think about moving out. Our kids aren’t going to remember the first 2 years of their lives. Hunting and monsters can still be nonexistent to them,” Becky thoughtfully pointed out.
“How long do you expect me to stay there?” she asked.
There were too many voices trying to get his attention. He put his hand up at Dean. “Shut up for a second, Dean. Becky, what’s wrong?”
Dean looked into Cas’s blue eyes. He leaned in to kiss him and Cas lightly kissed him back. But Dean could feel Cas’s hesitation. “What’s wrong?” he asked him.
“You remembered my name!” she said, giggling loudly. “You’re hot.” She whispered, and Dean could smell the mixture of alcohols on her breath. She wrapped her hands around his neck and leaned in, trying to kiss him. Dean turned his head and her lips fell clumsily onto his neck instead. Dean grabbed her hips and held her away.
. At least in the Impala he could listen to music and hold Cas’ hand and maybe even cuddle a little while they waited for something interesting to happen. Not that he would
“So what do you think?” Sam asked Dean. Dean just shrugged.
Dean laughed quietly to himself, putting his phone back in his pocket as he turned back to his computer. As wrong as his relationship with Castiel was, he couldn't help but feel better when the other man was around. They clicked in a way he and Lisa never had. It didn't mean he wasn't a piece of shit for cheating on her, but he couldn't give up what he had with Castiel.
“Yeah, Dean. I have.” And with that, he opened the door and walked out. Sam groaned and slumped against the wall against the wall.
“Unless…what if we surprise her early? Tomorrow, maybe?” Dean said. He started to pace. “I mean, just because she gave us until Friday doesn’t mean we have to wait, right? We could always go early. If we catch her off guard…”
“It’s called a car seat, Dean. It’s what we put babies in so they can ride.” Gabriel answered sarcastically. Cas looked down at the little seat. It had all sorts of knobs and straps to it. It looked more like a torture device, if you asked him. A torture device that happened to be covered in flowers. Cas rolled his eyes. Of course Gabriel had to get one with flowers on it.
The book was just beginning to capture his attention when his cellphone rang, playing some stupid pop song that Dean had changed his ringtone to as a joke. Ignoring the swooping sensation in his stomach, Castiel swiped his thumb across the screen, anticipaton curling in his gut. "Hello?"
“Okay.” he said, to his collective audience. (Honestly, he would never get used to so many people looking actually paying attention to him.) “It’s about a mile and a half in that direction.” Dean pointed. “Be quiet, keep your gun up.” He was saying this mostly for Andrew’s benefit. The others already knew what they were doing. “We aren’t entirely sure if it’s a witch or not, so just be on guard.”
Comments? Kudos? I love it all.
“You know, we are going to need a hotel.” He said, raising one eyebrow. Gabriel shook his head and pointed across the road to a fancy building.
“Okay.” Dean said. “So what, you think she just got a demon to put it back together?”
That had been a good night. The only thing he vaguely remember was taking a body shot off of Cas, but he pushed that thought away with a smile and settle down into the bed. He was surprised when Castiel immediately scooted closer and tucked into his chest. At Dean raised eyebrow, Castiel huffed.
“No, they like how you perceive me to be. Your perception of me is vastly different from how I actually am.” Castiel said. “You see the best in people, Dean, and you always have. The version of me that you’ve built in your mind is the one that your family likes, they won’t actually like who I am…”
“We, well, Sammy and I, are going to take turns hunting for the witch and staying here with you, Dean-o.” Gabriel said, finishing the sentence. Dean scowled.
He caught his angel’s eye from across the table and it told him that Castiel was thinking along the same lines as Dean. Wordlessly, he stood up.
“No point. She’d just track us down again. Might as well get this crap over with.” Dean said, and turned to follow the witch into the house.
The last thing he’d heard from Cas was that he was canceling their plans tonight. No explanation, no nothing, and he wasn’t answering Dean’s calls or his texts. Then Lisa had come home, and told him what happened. He should probably still be there. Trying to make things up to her. To promise her he’d be a better husband. To beg her not to leave him and take Ben.
“Oh!” He said in surprise, and felt Cas chuckle.
“Then sleep.” he said, running his hand through Dean’s hair.
To say that he was afraid didn’t quite cover it. He was terrified. But not for himself. All he could think about was all the times he had been able to save the Winchesters because of his powers. What if they needed him today and he couldn’t help? Castiel didn’t think he would be able to take it if something happened just because he was powerless. Not to mention, that Gabriel was currently a toddler and without any of his powers – which was another chunk out of their armor, considering it had mostly been Gabriel that defeated her in the first place.
“What does she want?” he asked. Dean handed him the note. Andrew read it over quickly and then made a noise of disgust. Dean took it back and then re-read it. It was actually pretty simple.
“What did this woman look like?” Dean asked. Amanda cleared her throat.
“Soon, Dean, I promise.” he said, and Dean nodded. He spread his legs in invitation, causing Cas to inhale sharply. Suddenly there was a bottle of lube in one hand and the other was running over Dean’s thighs. “You’re beautiful.” he said, leaning in and kissing Dean gently. He heard the pop that meant Cas had opened the lube, and soon, sure enough, he felt slick fingers teasing at his entrance. He took a deep breath, forcing himself to relax as Cas gently pushed one finger inside of him.
“You’re Lindsey Donovan.” he said, making the girl stiffen. She looked back at him with impossibly wide eyes.
“Uh, now, I guess.” Dean said. Andrew just nodded and stood up, brushing away at his tattered, filthy clothes. They were just as (if not more so) dirty as the man himself was. Dean immediately resolved to take him back to the motel and let him take a shower once they had checked out the cabin.
Dean winced slightly as Castiel pulled out, finding one of their discarded t-shirts and wiping both of them clean. Once this was accomplished, he stretched out beside Dean, cupping his face and pulling him in for a soft kiss.
“Gabriel? What the hell?” Dean said, wiping his hands on a dish towel. Instead of answering, Gabriel held out a black-haired, blue-eyed baby.  Dean took one step closer to examine the kid. Then he yelled to his brother.
It was still early, though. Castiel still had more than enough time to show. Dean went over to his bed and stretched out, electing to watch some crappy television until his…whatever Castiel was, showed.
“You don’t have tell me how you feel, Dean. I’m well-versed in the way you use your body to speak.” he said. “You speak more clearly through actions than you ever have with words.” Dean laughed, and pulled him in for another kiss.
Dean led the way into the house. He probably should have let one of the other two go first, considering he had Cas, but he didn’t think. Luckily, the witch (Casmiria?) had disappeared for the time being, leaving Dean, Sam, Gabriel, and Cas with ample time to take in their surroundings.It was actually charming on the inside. The entryway fell straight into a living room, which was clearly open to the kitchen. The walls were painted an off-white color and the floor was nothing but darkly stained hardwood. There was a cheerful looking fireplace in the living room and what (to the untrained eye) looked like a marble coffee table. Dean knew, however that this ‘coffee table’ was in fact an altar. It was one of the more elaborate he had seen, white marble, candles, the works, but nonetheless it was what it was. Casmiria returned carrying a tray with a teapot, cups, and tiny sandwiches on it. She immediately noticed their interest in her most interesting piece of furniture.
“Look at him go.” Dean said, nudging Sam. Sam nodded. He looked a little relieved now that Gabriel had woken up.
“You already have me forever, Dean. But, yes, I’ll marry you.” Dean smiled and kissed Cas again before pulling the man into his arms, sighing happily. Dean buried his face into Cas’ hair.
“Sammy? What’s wrong?” Dean demanded. Behind him, he heard Cas get out of the bed but he was too preoccupied with his brother’s expression.
he is. It’s the kind of bored that use to make him whisk Sam away for untold hours of fun. Of course, he can’t exactly do that now because 1) he’s a toddler, and Sam is not a pedophile and 2) he’s without any of his powers, which means he is without his ability to whisk.
That’s why Dean was in the Impala, driving towards Cas’ apartment. He was most likely just ignoring Dean, upset about everything that Lisa had said to him today. Maybe he just didn’t want to talk to Dean.
“Oh, Dean.” Castiel’s voice was wrecked as he slowly pushed into Dean. He bottomed out and stayed there for a moment, letting Dean get used to his girth.
He pushed another finger in and Cas thrust himself down hard onto Dean’s hand. Dean bent his fingers, searching for the bundle of nerves he knew would send his boyfriend over the edge. He found the spot and pressed against it, Cas arched up and cried out his name. Dean eased his third finger in and began to scissor them, stretching Cas and opening him up carefully.
The archangel thought.
You pronounce her name Caz-mir-uh, by the way. Comments and Kudos are greatly apprecitaed and promise I will answer you eventually!
Casmiria. She’d turned Cas into a baby, so it just made sense that she would be behind turning Gabriel into a toddler. And they had proof that she was in town, they had seen her earlier that day, after all. And Sam had known that Casmiria was particularly put out with Gabriel for having been one of the main components in her defeat.
“Why don’t we just find the bitch and gank it?” Dean spoke softly, but there was no denying the venom in his voice. It seemed that the hunter had taken it as a personal insult that someone would dare to turn his best friend-angel into a baby. Gabriel sighed.
“She just said that you owed her something.” Andrew laughed.
It was strange. Toddler Gabriel actually looked a lot like regular Gabriel. Sure, he was a little chubbier (baby fat?), and, of course, everything was smaller, but it was like he had been shrunk rather than aged down. Dean looked up at Sam.
“Three by three, I bind you, Casmiria!” The witch fell to her knees and started to sob.
"Goodnight, baby."
“Get dressed, angel. We have work to do.”
“Good. So how about we go to Wisconsin, we get a hotel, and we stake the place out for a couple of days? We can do the whole FBI thing and see if we can’t find out more about what we’re up against.” Dean nodded.
“Looks like you’re gonna have to lay down with him, Dean-o.” Gabriel said. Dean rolled his eyes, kicked of his boots and touched Cas.
“Dean is not the easiest person to get along with, but I love him. He does not have the easiest life, either, so why should I make it more difficult when he needs to vent? I don’t mind listening.” Cas turned towards Gabriel. “Besides, I’ve seen you with Sam. You have no room to talk. It’s obvious you think the sun shines out of his ass.” Cas said, matter-of-factly. Gabriel eyes went wide and then he started to laugh. He doubled over and grabbed his stomach, struggling to breathe with the force of his laughter. Cas moved forward, slightly alarmed, but Gabriel waved him back. Finally, he stood, wiping his eyes with the tears that had settled there.
“Why can’t you do it? You have his address.” Dean asked. The witch rolled her eyes.
The entire world was fuzzy. His ears were buzzing and he couldn’t remember where he was. He opened his eyes and immediately shut them. Lights hurt, too. And what was that noise? That beeping. He wished he could cut it off. It was hurting his head. He opened his eyes and tried to sit up, only to realize that he was tethered to the bed. He reached up, feeling a tube in his nose. What in the hell?
He handed the second coffee to Dean. “Here. What time did you get in last night? And dude, please tell me you didn’t drive home last night.”
Cas arched his brow. “The archangel, Gabriel? Isn’t he dead?”
, Dean thought. He wrapped his arms around her neck and gave her a big hug. “Thank you,” he whispered in her ear.
The loud sound inevitably woke Charlotte with a start. Sam glared at his brother. “Seriously, Dean? I almost had her down.” Dean rush past his brother and beelined for the library. He began to grab a bunch of books and set them down at the table. “What are you doing? Why are you home from work so soon?”
Sam eventually returned from the farmers market with bags filled with fresh produce. He was in the kitchen putting away the vegetables when Castiel ran into him in his underwear. “Cas!” Sam exclaimed. He bashfully turned away. “I guess you’ve already spoken to Dean about his pregnancy.”
Cas raced over to his pregnant boyfriend. He got to the floor to be on his level. “Are you in labor?”
Dean was in the middle of lightly bouncing his niece. “No, not yet. If he has, he hasn’t told me.” He remembered Sam and Becky researching baby names, but he didn’t believe they ever came to a conclusion.
She wanted to respond, but was interrupted by her phone vibrating. It was a text message from Noah.
It was late in the night and everyone in the bunker was sound asleep, except for Cas and Dean. Since Dean and Cas began their relationship, Dean wasn’t always super comfortable with showing affection to Cas with his brother in the room. Castiel understood, considering this was a big change for him, but once night fell and everyone was asleep, Dean took every opportunity he had to touch his boyfriend and explore his body.
They finished up their drinks and left the bar. When Becky got back to her small apartment, she couldn’t stop thinking about Sam. The way he smelled, how he looked at her. She had been chasing this for years. To have Sam Winchester like her. It may not be romantically, but they have a real connection. She was determined not to mess this up. She then saw the dress she was going to wear on her date resting on top of her dresser. This made her excited for her date. Things were finally looking up for her.
Dean grabbed Cas’ hand. “Then protect me. Stay with me.”
Then Dean noticed the mason jar that Castiel had in his hand. It all looked familiar to him but he couldn’t put his finger on it. Until it hit him. “Is-is that your grace?” he asked the angel.
Dean cleared his throat. “Um, ye-yes.”
“Sammy, you’re doing it!” Dean cheered as he kept brothers leg steady.
“Dean!” Sam shouted as he made his way up the stairs. He then grabbed Dean’s gun and lowered it. “Stop.” He looked at Becky. “What are you doing here?” Sam asked her, seeming concerned for her. She looked lost. He also wondered how he found him because he knew he didn’t give her his address.
Dean read the title, ‘The Power of a Young Nephilim, Volume I’. I’ve been looking for this thing.”
Breathing heavily Cas kissed the nape of Dean’s neck. “I love you,” he whispered.
“I’m not in labor. It’s Braxton Hicks contractions. Essentially, false labor pains. Most pregnant women get them. It’s just the body getting ready. I’ve been having them all week,” Sam explained.
“Good. Just hungry. Do you want to stop and get some food?” Ethan just finished his bottle and Sam tossed the empty bottle into the diaper bag and began to hook Ethan into his car seat.
Dean stopped himself because he could feel his stomach beginning to cramp. He put a hand to his middle, clenched his teeth, and groaned. Cas immediately jumped over to Dean to help him but Dean put his hand up to stop him. “Cas, stop. Just stop.”
Dean pulled Cas in for a steamy kiss. “I’ve never wanted anything more.”
At first Becky was devastated, which worried Sam and Dean. They already saw how one bad date affected her. They didn’t want history to repeat itself. But Becky had come a long way since then. She handled this breakup in a healthy way. Of course, she was sad, which she had every right to be, but what helped her the most was to talk out her feelings. And Sam was a great listener.
Dean wanted to push past his brother, but that only make things worse. Somehow, he felt trapped within his own emotions. “I think that I’m bisexual,” he blurted. Sam just stared at his brother, speechless. “I am bisexual,” he said definitively. “and the baby’s father is Castiel,” he finally told his brother. “Cas and I had sex and I am pregnant with our baby,” he further explained.
Rowena stifled a laugh. “I’m sorry. A witch turned you into a woman. Remind me to thank her later.”
Sam had his hand out in front, centimeters from touching Cas’ white button-down. “I’m not sure that’s the best idea.”
Cas was quick to tear his pants and shirt off. He then had Dean bend over the dresser and slowly entered inside of Dean with his erect penis. They both moaned once he was fully in. Cas expertly ground into Dean, pumping his body and hold Dean’s widening hips for support.
“Sure, what about?”
lie to me again,” Dean gritted.
Sam took a breath before saying, “Hey, so I was wondering if you wanted to get dinner tomorrow?”
“I guess you’ll be a pro once you feel the real thing.” She turned to face Sam and displayed her arms out. “How do I look?”
Sam didn’t want to get into it. He knew once he started rambling about phantom people, he thought he saw in a parking lot, Dean would never let it go. He didn’t need his brother to put him under a microscope. He’d been down that road before when he kept seeing Lucifer everywhere. He didn’t need that again. “Yeah, I’m sure.”
“But I don’t understand. I did everything I could to come back,” Cas said.
Dean quickly raised and then lowered his eyebrows and then scoffed. “How am I feeling?” Dean repeated the question letting out a cynical laugh. “I’m 7 months pregnant. How do you think I’m feeling? But is that what you really want to talk about right now?”
“I had a Twinkie about 3 hours ago,” he recalled.
“No, you’re not. Just let me help you,” Sam offered. Dean rolled his eyes and eventually got himself up. “I don’t know why you won’t let Cas heal your back. There is no use to put yourself through all of this pain.”
Sam continued to walk her out and waited until they ascended the stairs and hidden behind the door to push her up against the wall and give her a hard kiss. She dropped her purse and caressed Sam’s large frame, barely able to grasp at his arm muscles. He grounded his body into her, she could feel he was beginning to get hard. “W-we-uh-we gotta stop,” she said breathlessly while Sam kissed her neck, causing her eyes to practically roll behind her head in pure ecstasy. It was all so titillating. Both of them practically vibrating off each other.
The next day was very much like the day before. After he finished class, he went straight to the gym to do his rigorous work out. He always started out doing 30 minutes on the treadmill, then he would follow it up with weights and then finish with 10 minutes of stretching. He was walking to his car when he bumped into a woman causing her gym bag and phone to fall to the ground. Sam apologized profusely as he bent over to pick up her phone.
She turned them over and immediately gasped. It read, “New Baby Cousin, Coming Soon!”
Sam emerged from the darkness of the hallway. He had Ethan in his arms who was drifting off to sleep. “What are you doing?” he whispered, careful not to wake up his son.
“It’s complicated…,” he told him.
“Well you’re going to have to try because this left untreated can result in going into early labor or placental abruption or worse,” she said sternly. “Which is why I highly recommend that you stay on bed rest for the next couple of weeks—” Dean was about to protest but she continued. “—just until you can get your blood pressure and cholesterol down.”
“I didn’t think you were--,”
“We kinda approached each other at the same time,” she recalled.
“If you say witches, so help me God…”
She looked around the room in annoyance. “What do you want?”
Dean snorted at that last bit. “I don’t know about that stress part.”
“Okay…is that a bad thing? I thought you wanted kids.”
Sam twisted to his brother and asked, “What are you talking about?” Dean wouldn’t look him in the eye and knew he wouldn’t talk with the majority of people they knew hanging out in his hospital room. He turned to the crew, “Can we have the room, please?”
“What about Cas? Doesn’t he deserve better?” Dean challenged.
Sam narrowed his eyes. “A ride? You let someone drive, baby?”
“He’s been healed.” Cas sighed and sat heavily at the long table.
Becky struggled to put the key in her door. The doorknob kept swaying on her. When she finally got in, she threw her keys on her counter and grabbed a bottle of whiskey she had on her bar cart. She didn’t even bother to get a glass. She was tired of feeling sad for herself. The old Becky would take matters into her own hands. If she wanted a family then was going to get one, dammit! She heard her therapist in her head, ‘Don’t do anything rash, Becky. Count to 3 before making any life altering decisions.’ No more counting! No more thinking rationally. In the back of her closet she kept her old spell books that Chuck got her when they were dating. She had meant to throw them away, but she could never bring herself to do it.
“Becky?” He entered the room cautiously. “Can we talk?”
“I don’t know about you, Dean, but I feel like we’ve been in this relationship for years. I’ve loved you for a very long time. I thought maybe we would be ready for this,” Cas said solemnly.
Dean heaved a rather large sigh, “Yeah, I guess. I’m just not ready for it right now. I want to enjoy what I have with Cas before we have kids running around.”
?” Claire shrieked. “You’re asking me to drive you to Heaven? Are you out of your mind?”
Dean had a hard time viewing himself as gay but he couldn’t deny how he felt after kissing Cas last night. He was the happiest he’s been in a very long time.
Dean woke with a start. He could hear Claire and Alex arguing in the living room. He wondered how Jody got any sleep in her house. The walls were incredibly thin. The past two nights he listened to Alex gab with her boyfriend till past midnight from her bedroom. And on the other side of his room, he could hear Jody scrutinizing her subordinates. She also brought a lot of her paperwork home and would listen to music while she worked. Apparently, she was a Pat Benatar fan.
“That’s okay, I’ll do it, thank you.” He insisted. She had done so much for him and he appreciated her efforts.
He was talking about the last town where Dean got too eager and almost got them both killed.
“No, not yet. I thought—given your situation—that you’d probably want to see it without him.”
“Something tells me this ain’t the stomach flu. If I’m pregnant, I want to wait to tell Sam and Becky. At least until we’re past the dangerous stage,” Dean explained.
Sam rushed to find his keys when he passed his brother walking out of the library. “Where’s the fire?” Dean asked.
Sam raised his eyebrow. “Arguing? About what?”
Dean nodded. “I’m good. I’ve just been having these pains for the past few hours. Braxton Hicks contractions I think they’re called.”
Dean chucked. “Yeah, you did a great job, Cas.” Dean was then caught off guard by a yawn. He politely put his fist to his mouth. “Sorry,” he said mid-yawn.
“Relax, it’s not like I’m using it for porn…this time…,” he smirked.
Once Dean got settled in his bed he said “Thank you,” to his brother.
Dean remained in the hospital for 2 days as Dr. Nelson conducted a few more tests on him and the baby to be sure they were both okay. Before discharging them, he had another stern conversation about the seriousness of his condition. Dean seemed to understand. He was looking to get out of the hospital and rest in the bunker. He would never admit it, but he missed the smell that the old books gave off in the library and even the faint cries of Sam’s kids. He even missed Becky.
“Suicide? Is she okay?”
She sighed and looked away from Sam, guiltily. “Not exactly.”
“No, I’m taking you to the bunker. I got someone in mind to help you out.”
Castiel chuckled. “Well I guess we’re just going to have to wait and see,” he said as he pulled his boyfriend in for a tender kiss. He then not so subtly placed his hand on Dean’s stomach and it didn’t take much for Dean to notice. He decided not to bring attention to it while they kissed. He might have even liked it. It was as if Cas could already feel their baby growing inside of Dean.
Dean put his weight on his back foot and nodded to the angel, impressed. “Well, alright.”
Dean waddled his way over to the kitchen where Sam was making a fresh pot of coffee. Poor Sam stayed up all night waiting for the angels. Between Jody, Sam and Castiel, they have shifts where they stand guard in the war room. Sam set up security cameras to catch any movement around the perimeter of the bunker. So far, the most they’ve seen is a rather large crow that set the alarm off.
Sam took a pull from his beer. “You have no idea. This whole Nephilim thing has gotten out of hand and Cas is now barely here. We can’t even get a hold of him half the time.”
Sam rolled his eyes. “Cas is checking to see if he can sense the gender.”
Sam couldn’t believe what he was hearing. There was this wild energy radiating through his brother that he needed to tame. “Dean, stop! We are not going to get archangels involved in this! I meant it when I said that I wanted to step away from hunting for the sake of my family and I’d like to keep that promise,” Sam said as he continued to soothe his crying daughter.
“Not very creative, if you ask me,” he frowned.
“I needed you here, Cas!” Dean exclaimed. “I needed you with me.”
Jack barely reacted. He flashed Dean a small smile. “Well then I hope it doesn’t come to that.” Then he disappeared from the bunker, leaving Dean, Sam and Charlotte in the library, devastated.
“Not to mention that I’m probably pregnant,” Dean murmured, half asleep.
“I’m fine. There’s no need to worry him. You all have too much on your plate. Plus, that kid needs some rest.”
“I’m not either, but it’s not like we had much guidance on the matter,” Sam said as a sort of dig to Cas. Instead of responding, Cas continued to eat his sandwich in silence.
“Yeah, I bet you do! Did you not learn your lesson the last time? Sam doesn’t want you. Get that through your fuc—”
“He did it so that we could have a baby,” Dean reasoned.
Dean gave Cas a quick kiss on the cheek. “I’ll think about it, okay?” he said, still unsure of himself.
He asked himself.
“I don’t know if I’m ready to talk about that, yet.”
Dean laughed. “You expect me to go on a case? Like this?” he said gesturing to his body.
Sam sighed. “Because I didn’t feel like going through
Dean had his arms wrapped around the toilet, as if he was holding on for dear life. He spat into the toilet. “Do I look okay, Sammy?” he snapped.
He got out of the car and into his motel room. When he looked back to his car Castiel disappeared from the driver’s seat. Sam was asleep when he came into the room. He got undressed and passed out in his bed, letting the evening wash away.
For the first time, Dean looked up at his brother with tears in his eyes. “How could you even say that after what I said to you?”
Sam rolled his eyes. He thought Dean was being absurd but he didn’t want to fight anymore. “Fine. Whatever,” he said dismissively and then shut the front door to Jody’s house.
It didn’t take long for Dean to come up with an answer. “Never.”
“We were going to but after we checked in and saw what it looked like, we decided not to stay.” The reunion was at an old bar restaurant that had seen better days.
Made sense, since she probably dying to know what happened with Dean.
Sam shot him daggers but Dean ignored him. “Have you’ve been staying hydrated at all?” Sam attempted to take Dean’s pulse when Dean pushed him away.
“Just shut up and kiss me,” Dean said impatiently before locking lips with his boyfriend.
Gabriel clapped his hands together. “Lets! So, the plan is to summon Jack and talk to him,” Gabriel revealed.
At first Becky was a little offended that he would even think something like that, but she then realized that it wasn’t his fault. Becky knew how obsessive she can get when she likes someone. For a while, her sole attention was on Noah. That’s all she could ever talk about it. She couldn’t get enough of him. She carefully touched Sam’s shoulder. “You and these babies come first. Always.”
Eventually they got him into the infirmary and stripped down. There were old hospital gowns equipped in the room, which Dean helped him get dressed in. Once he was fully dressed, Cas had Sam get on the hospital bed and bend his legs, so he could check him. “You’re at 10 centimeters, Sam,” Cas announced. “I can see the head.”
It was rough to watch his brother yak up his guts most mornings in the beginning and then there was the miscarriage… It was just too much for Dean to handle.
“Like my nose is broken,” he said, pinching at the bridge of his nose. “Were you cooking your tomato bisque earlier? I could’ve sworn that I smelt it when I came in.”
He skipped the greasy breakfast Dean made him and just grabbed a tea and muffin at the campus coffee shop. He drank half of his tea and couldn’t stomach the muffin. As the class began to file in, he started feel slight cramping in his stomach and his pelvis. It started as a dull ache which he could ignore but it increasingly got worse as his class continued.
That next morning Dean and Cas gave the new parents a break and took care of the twins. Sam was in desperate need of a shower and a nap in his own bed. The twins did not sleep through  the night, causing Becky and Sam to be up half the night.
Sam was very proud of his improv moment. He looked at Becky who was still wrapped around him and she was not very pleased. She pushed Sam out of the way and walked out the store. Sam tried to chase after her but he didn’t want to cause a scene. He quickly paid for his items and met her at the car. She was leaning on the door waiting for Sam to unlock it. “What was that about? Why did you run out?” Sam asked her as he pulled up with his cart of bagged groceries.
Sam loved the sight of this. She was such an amazing mom. And even while she was wearing her oversized grey t-shirt that had stains and holes on it, he thought she looked gorgeous. For a while, he had noticed another side of Becky. A more romantic side.
“I do want them, in the traditional sense. If I have kids with Cas, then he’s going to do some angelic crap that will allow me to carry the kid.
Chapter 16: Nudity at its Finest.
The final few miles to Casmiria’s place were tense, to say the least. Everyone was on edge, and Andrew looked downright scared. The rest of them, having done similar stuff before, were a little more calm. Andrew kept rustling his hands, which were tied with a black cord (the one, ironically enough, that would be used to bind Casmiria). Sam was staring out the window, Gabriel was staring at Sam (or out the window, Dean wasn’t really sure) and Cas and himself were both focused on the blacktop directly in front of them. Finally, they pulled to the side of the road at Casmiria’s house. Wordlessly, they all climbed out of the car. They stood there for a moment, just looking at the house.
After this it's only the epilogue, my babies.
taking people and so I started to warn people. In hindsight, not the best idea I’ve ever had. Most of them thought I was just a raving drunk.”
“The note said to come to you. It even told me where you were.” She put her hand in her pocket and shakily removed a folded piece of paper. “H-here it is. It said I should tell you that I should tell t-to c-come to the cabin if you w-wanted Katie to live.” The last words were a horrified whisper, as if she thought that they may not have cared if her daughter lived or died. Sam came to stand by Dean.
“Dean, we are going to have to scope the place out first. We don’t know what we are up against. You don’t really want to go in blind with guns blazing, do you?” Dean didn’t speak because yes, that was exactly what he wanted. He wanted to get his best friend back and that was the quickest way to do it.
“What are you saying, Dean?” Castiel asked, his heart starting to beat faster.
Dean sighed, and let go of Cas. “Research.”
“We are sorry to intrude on your grief, Mrs. Wilson. I promise we will be quick.” Amanda smiled wryly.
“Definitely a witch’s garden...” Dean muttered. He stood up and brushed off his jeans, continuing to walk around the house. He met Sam at the back door.
Casmiria screamed as she went up in flames, and everyone in the room was staring, flabbergasted at the figure in the doorway.
“I can find him, if you wish.” Cas said, as if he was reading Dean’s mind. (This was entirely plausible, if he really thought about it). The angel was giving Dean an out, one that he was absolutely willing to take. If he hadn’t been driving, Dean would’ve kissed him.
Andrew was clearly uncomfortable having all of the attention on him. He cleared his throat and started to twist his hands together.
“I know what you mean.” he murmured into Cas’ hair. Cas sighed contentedly and nuzzled into his neck. They stood there for a moment, just enjoying being close to each other. Then Dean sighed and pulled back.
“Look, you’re gorgeous, but I’m here with someone.” he said. Natalie frowned at that but then she smiled again.
that Dean couldn’t help but to moan along with him. It was too soon for him to get hard again but his dick sure was giving a valiant effort. Cas shuddered above him.
and not just needed.
are you doing here?”
“So what is it? Bottle or food?” Cas pursed his lips, thinking. Food would fill him up faster but a bottle would be easier for Dean. Cas looked up and Dean and concentrated
“You’ve bested me for the last time, angel.” She held her hand out and immediately Cas started to glow slightly, he clutched at his chest and fell to his knees. Dean had pulled out his gun, but after seeing Casmiria unaffected by a shotgun shell to the heart he didn’t have much hope it would do anything. But he had to do something, she was killing Cas. He didn’t know how exactly she was doing it but his angel was in a lot of pain and Dean just knew if she didn’t stop he would die. The only thing he could think of to do was to tackle her and break her concentration. So that was exactly what he did.
“You’ve been known to act rashly, Dean. Sometimes people get hurt.” Dean winced slightly.
Gabriel had long since gone back to sleep, curled up on Sam’s lap. It reminded Dean of how Cas slept on him when he had been a baby, with one hand fisted in his shirt. Sam had his laptop open in front them. He looked as tired as Dean felt.
Dean stepped opened the door to his bedroom and walked inside. He was alone for the moment, Sam having run off to chase down some new lead on Metatron that would ultimately turn out to be nothing. Not that Dean was upset about it. There was so much tension between him and his brother recently, sometimes it was a relief to not be around each other for a while. And also…well, he was hoping maybe Cas would be by tonight. It was a long shot, and Dean knew it, but hey, a guy could dream, right? It had been weeks since he had last seen Castiel.
“No. They can’t…” he’s cut off as Castiel slips his hand into the slit of Dean’s boxers.
“We should go to Sam and Gabriel’s room. We have a case after all.” he said with a little resentment in his voice.
"C'mon, Cas, please." Dean begged, his hips twitching up. Castiel finally took pity on him, closing his lips around Dean's cock and took him down all in one motion. The noise Dean made was almost inhuman, even as Dean's hands came to tangle in his hair. He looked up at Dean, making eye contact as he swallowed.
“Come on, Samsquatch. It’s my turn, and you know this ass isn’t gonna wait forever.”
“Why aren’t they gone? Shouldn’t they have healed by now?” Dean asked, tearing his eyes away from the mirror to look at Castiel.
“Did I do something wrong, Dean?” he asked. Dean sighed.
“This is useless.” Dean muttered, slamming his book shut. Sam jumped, and Castiel looked up in surprise. “Come on – we’ve been at this for
"I saw you." She said. "Driving that old Continental that's parked outside." She glanced towards the door. "Dean's jacket, he forgot it in the backseat. He told me he left it at the office, but I knew better."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Gabe…” Sam said, but the look intensified. Finally, Sam rolled his eyes. “Fine.” Gabriel grinned and grabbed Sam’s face, leaned in and gave him a chaste kiss.  Sam made a face but allowed it.
The next few days passed in an endless cycle. Wake up, coffee, shower, work, lunch with Dean, more work, then home. Castiel moved through it like a robot. Dean hadn't been able to come over any in that time, but he'd promised he'd be over tonight. Which is why Castiel was standing in a bakery, looking at the different pies they had on display. He wanted to suprise Dean with one of them, though he didn't know which one. Apple was always a good go-to, but nothing could beat a good cherry pie either. It was definitely a dilemma, even though Castiel knew that Dean wouldn't care. Pie was pie to him. He loved all of it.
He knows.
“It-It’s C-Cas! B-but I don’t know what happened to him!” Gabriel said. He still had the baby held out, as if he was scared it would bite him. Dean looked shocked.
It was early the next morning when Dean woke up. He was surprised at how much more entwined him and Cas had become during the night. Cas’ hand was on top of his, their fingers curled together and he was flush up against the angel, with one of his legs between Cas’.  He doesn’t want to wake the angel, and he’s incredibly comfortable, but he knows that he needs to get up. Sam would
Not that Dean minded that at all. He sent off one more text to his boyfriend.
“Are you threatening me, hunter?” She asked. There was a trace of anger in her voice. Dean opened his mouth but Sam cut him off.
Damn. He really wanted to make Gabriel catch up. Oh well.
“But…” What? What was Dean supposed to say? ‘You made me come harder than my ex ever did?’ Jimmy just shook his head again.
He also had to put a diaper on him. Crap.
“Well, Dean told me about you, but he never did tell me that you were hot.” Jo said, coming up and elbowing Sam out of the way. “I’m Jo. It’s short for Joanna, but if you ever call me that I’ll castrate you.” She looked at him seriously for a moment and then smiled. “I’m the unofficial little sister.”
“I’m glad that’s over with.” he sighed. Dean held his hand out to him.
Dean's mouth left very little to be desired. He was always willing and eager, sucking Castiel's dick like it was his damn job. It was wonderful, everytime. Castiel could never get enough. "Jesus, Dean." he panted, looking down. Dean looked up at him and winked before he swallowed Castiel, taking him in so far that Castiel felt his nose against his stomach. He arched his back, cursing as he broke eye contact.
As he dug a little deeper, Dean found out that Lindsey had a record. He turned quickly to Cas to show him what he had found.
“Sam. Pick me up. I wanna walk.” Gabriel said, tugging at his shirt sleeve. Sam rolled his eyes and plucked Gabriel out of cart and carefully sat him down. Now that he was over the shock of seeing the archangel as a toddler, he was rather annoyed by it.
“I’m glad you found someone, man. Just…be careful. You know what happened to all of your other hook-ups.” Sam rolled his eyes.
Castiel’s eyes were already closed, his breathing deep and even.
Hell, if Cas decided to up and leave he’d deserve it. He was a rotten human being and wasn’t worthy of such a caring boyfriend. He tried one more time.
Dean climbed out of his car and ran up the steps. He slowed down slightly as he pulled open the door. As much as he wanted to, he knew he couldn’t run straight up the stairs to his boyfriend. No, the anticipation was almost as good as the actual sex. So he goes to the kitchen and heats up whatever Cas had for dinner and ate it quickly. (He loved it when Cas cooked for him, but at the moment, he was really rather preoccupied with the fact that said boyfriend was naked and waiting for him upstairs) When he was finished, he washed the dishes and then slowly climbed the stairs.
Castiel broke away with a moan when he bottomed out. “Dean, you feel so good.” he whispered, peppering the hunter’s neck with light kisses.
“Dean?” he heard, and his heart stopped. Both he and Natalie turned around and he saw Cas standing there, two bottles of beer in his hand and what Dean knew as his ‘smite-y’ expression on his face. Dean let go of the girl in front of him like he’d been shocked.
“I want you to say it, Dean.” Cas said, his voice even rougher than normal with arousal. Dean blinked and tried to think around the need to come singing through his body.
“Me? Don’t blame me. I had to beat him off with a stick.” he grinned sweetly at Sam and popped a piece of what looked like butterscotch in his mouth. Sam rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything.
“Because now I have something I care about, Dean. I have someone I care about other than you.” Sam said, surprising everyone in the room. Dean took a step back, almost falling over Cas. Even Gabriel looked mildly surprised. Sam whirled around and looked at Gabriel, then turned on his heel and exited the room, slamming the door so hard it bounced back open. Dean was able to see Sam stalk in the direction of his room before he finally succeeded in wrenching his elbow out of Cas’ grasp. Without a word, he followed Sam out, heading in the opposite direction. Gabriel let out a low whistle and Cas turned his head to look at him.
“A hotel, I guess. It wasn’t fair of me to keep up this farce of a marriage with Lisa. She deserves better.” Castiel nodded.
“Forgive me if I’m wrong but…aren’t we supposed to go inside now?” Cas asked after a minute, causing everyone but Andrew to laugh. Dean clapped him on the shoulder.
“So are we all going to go to this ritual?” he asked, pulling out a chair and sitting down, somehow producing a lollipop from nowhere. Sam shrugged.
“Did you hear anything I said?” he asked, and Dean raised his eyebrows. Had Cas been talking? Was he really freaking out that much? Dean shook his head, and Castiel sighed.
“Alright, give me one more round of applause for the lovely Meg!” The cheers were deafening, but Dean didn’t mind. He was starting to get into this now. Bela was hardly even on his mind. He didn’t even care about her. A spike of feedback made Dean look up, wondering what he’d missed during his revelation.
It was late afternoon by the time they got back. The sunlight was filtering down through the trees, bathing everything in a beautiful, golden light. Dean pulled up to the curb and climbed out of the car, going to the backseat immediately to get Cas out. The tiny angel was yawning when Dean finally pulled him from the car seat. Dean gently laid Cas against his chest and started to soothe him quietly. Sam and Gabriel exchanged grins but Dean ignored them. Sam, Gabriel and Dean all walked into the lobby and got into an elevator. Cas wasn’t quite asleep yet, (as far as Dean could tell) but he knew the angel was close to it. As quietly as possible, Dean slipped out of the elevator and unlocked their room. Sam reached past him to open the door and the four of them entered the room. Dean immediately walked over to the bed he had previously slept on and laid Cas down. He thought he was going to get away until Cas began to sniffle.
To quiet his boyfriend, Cas kissed Dean and rested his hand on his cheek. “We’ll figure it out.” Cas looked down at Dean’s stomach. He had the smallest bump forming under his shirt. He gently touched it. “Take care of our baby.” He then looked into Dean’s eyes. “And take care of yourself, okay? I’m going to need you healthy if I plan on marrying you,” he smiled behind wet eyes.
“Well then when?” Cas asked with anger in his voice. “It’s been 2 years, Dean. How much more time do you need?”
Becky was stunned in embarrassment. Becky knew she looked like total crap. She hadn’t brushed her hair in 3 days. She was out wearing sweatpants and an oversized wrinkled t-shirt with stains on it. On the other hand, she felt that Jocelyn hadn’t looked better. As if somehow, she got a glow-up since the reunion. There was no use in lying. She did that already to Jocelyn in Vegas and she couldn’t even show Sam off at the reunion. “Yeah, I moved here for work. I’ve been here for a few months. What about you? What are you doing here?”
Dean was pretty out of it when he heard her speak so it startled him a little. “Hmm? I guess a little bit of both if I’m being honest.”
That brought Castiel out of his trance. “Yeah, she did. Quite the artist,” he said, gesturing towards the mural. “I wasn’t aware that she could paint.”
It was late in the afternoon and the sun was beginning to set. Sam loved this time of day because both his twins were typically their afternoon nap and he could use this time to get some housework done. It was usually quiet which allowed Sam to think clearly and calmly. Becky had called Sam earlier to let him know that she had a last-minute meeting to attend to and to not wait up for her.
“Well, with the vote results coming in less than 48 hours, we should try and summon him. Do you know his game plan?” Cas asked.
Anger rose inside of Dean. If he could he would tear Heaven apart to find Castiel. Then it hit him, why doesn’t he? He turned to Sam, “I’m going to Heaven,” he said.
“According to Cas, Jack doesn’t give a shit. So, I’d like to have a little chat with him.”
“His morning sickness woke him up,” Sam told her.
By 4:30 pm Dean had everything on the table. Not to mention his nausea stayed at bay pretty much the entire time. The turkey was a beautiful golden brown that he had always seen in magazines but never imagined he would be able to do himself. Everything on the table looked delectable. It was perfect. Except it wasn’t. Dean took a glance at his phone to see if Cas reached out and there was nothing. He prayed to him as well and he didn’t show. So, Dean thought it best to start dinner without him. There was no reason to have all of his good food get cold.
With the tray in his hands, Cas asked, “That’s it? I thought there would be more.”
“Um…actually…,” Sam trailed. “You’re not wrong.”
“I know, but I just couldn’t resist,” she said, kissing her daughters’ cheeks over and over again.
“Great, we better find a cure fast!”
“I think you’re the last person that she wants to see,” he said with little emotion, and then walked out the door.
“Angels have been able to insert children into people for ages. It takes a lot of grace and permission from Heaven, but it is doable,” Castiel explained.
“Well, I think it’s a little, juvenile, don’t you?” Castiel questioned.
Dean didn’t say anything but give his brother a death glare. “Okay… I also found these books.” He hoisted some occult books on the table as well. “Were you aware that she dabbled into black magic?”
Castiel simply nodded.
Dean nodded. “Yeah, Sam and the baby are doing just fine.” Dean got on the floor across from her.
“You’re pregnant. You won’t be able to fight the angels in your condition.”
“We’re going to be fine…”
Sam’s contraction finally ended and he looked over to Becky, who still looked horrified. “Becky, why are you back so soon? I thought you were planning on sleeping over Noah’s.”
“No, even if I wanted you to, you wouldn’t be able to last long without throwing up. I can do this. What do I do with the mac and cheese?”
“Okay. Dinner it is,” she said, tucking her hair behind her ear. “Is this a date?” she asked.
Tears began to build up behind Becky’s eyes. She thought that her and Dean were on good terms. She didn’t think he would say such hurtful things to her. “Um, okay…just let me know if he wakes up,” she said as she rushed past Dean.
fine,” Dean said, trying to convince his brother and himself. He brushed past his brother and retreated to bed, leaving Sam speechless in the hallway. It took everything in his body not to run after his brother and have him talk out his problems, but Sam was exhausted. He made the walk back to his room and crashed.
“Yeah, and?” Jody said unfazed. “Get a grip, Dean. You’re going to be fine.” The oven alarm went off. She retreated to the kitchen to take out the chicken.
“For now. But if I know the angels, they’ll find a way to--, well you know,” Cas couldn’t bring himself to say it.
Castiel nodded enthusiastically. “Yes, I agree.” He took a step forward filling the space in between them.
“Don’t mention it,” Sam replied with a half-smile. “We’re brothers, this is what we do.”
“Yes,” Cas said. “On your next contraction, I need you push.”
When she got off the elevator, Dr. Char’s secretary was just taking off her coat and putting it on the back of her chair. “Becky!” she beamed at her. She a was a young lady who was still in school getting her masters in Psychology. While waiting for Dr. Char, they had struck up some friendly conversations. “You can go right in. Dr. Char is waiting for you.”
Castiel noticed Dean’s discomfort based on his facial expression. Castiel frowned. “Would that be a problem?”
“Okay, I have been going to some much-needed therapy after I did what I did to you. And I learned a lot in these past few years. A lot about myself. Sam, I was in a real bad place when I-,”
“Excuse me?” Dean asked in a low warning tone.
Dean groaned as he swirled the concoction. “How we will know if it took? Do we just wait until I have morning sickness?” he joked.
Without thinking, Dean left work to get to the bunker as soon as he could.
“Can’t I be having a good morning?”
“—the nausea, the headaches, the weight gain. All of this would be in line with a woman in her 4
“Stop asking me that question. How’s the kid?” Dean nodded towards his nephew.
Cas rose from his seat to compose himself. “Dean, Nephilim’s are an abomination in heaven. The second other angels find out that your pregnant with one, they will try and come after you,” Cas said calmly.
Sam grinned. “You look beautiful.”
“I am Dean. A witch did this to me and we need you to fix it,” Dean told him.
Dean looked around the room. “Why did you choose to come in here?”
He chuckled. “Thanks Dean. Your eyes are very green. Especially in the light. More of an emerald.”
Sam rubbed his tired eyes. “She’s fine. She slit her wrists but right before, she called the Suicide Hotline. Luckily, they called the authorities when she hung up and they found her just in time.”
This was the first time Dean and Cas had been alone in the same room since they had broken up. Castiel stared at Dean, with loving eyes, not sure what to say to him. There was so much tension in the air that Castiel found it hard to breathe. He wanted to hug him and kiss him and hold him and erase his memory of all the dumb shit he’d done. But instead, Cas kept staring at him, never breaking eye contact with him.  “Becky really did a great job,” Dean said, breaking the silence.
“I don’t think so…maybe I just don’t have one.”
“Worried about what?”
“I don’t know…he’s been doing that a lot lately,” Dean revealed to Sam.
The thought of one baby was daunting enough, but now that he knew he was having two, he couldn’t wrap his brain around it. He put a brave face for Becky and Dean, but he was freaking out internally. Becky obviously jumpstarted any sort of a parental life that Sam had in mind, and he’s forgiven her for it. He was actually getting excited to have a child of his own where he would get the chance to be a better parent than his father. But that dream only included one child. He wasn’t even sure if he could afford a second kid. The bunker had plenty of room for another baby, which got him thinking about buying a home. Raising his children in a 1950’s bunker wasn’t ideal.
