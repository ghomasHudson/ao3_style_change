"Think about it. You could buy all kinds of frames for all kinds of occasions, couldn't you? I always used to tell myself that if I ever needed glasses I'd buy a half dozen pair and change them depending on my mood." The stranger cocked his head and a bit of fringe fell into his bright blue eyes. Five. Sherlock counted five sorts of blond. "'Course I was ten-years-old then and didn't know that some fucking frames cost as much as a Knightsbridge flat but there you go."
But there's only one thing that'll stop the fire in his shoulder, and it sounds just like an Afghan viper when he turns the bottle slowly in his hands, the pills whispering with that snake’s soft
I like learning the little things, like how that awful coffee in the cafeteria actually brings out the subtle cherry and almond notes in Dr Singh's home-made biscuits.
Bethany Reeder looked at her very best friend. Then at her own phone. Then at her friend. She murmured softly, as if her heart were breaking, "That's right when the battery died."
By the time John was placing the last pin in his patient, Sherlock was wiggling back and forth on his bum, anxious and grabby. The moment John held Rosie up Sherlock clutched her and squeezed her. "Thank you!" he shouted into her belly and John grinned a big
"Heeeeey there, y'know what? You're right and I'm sorry, sincerely. I don't know hardly anything about ropes or knots. My, uh, my sister taught me some of that years ago and I guess it was me making stuff up. That doesn't matter though, what matters is we wanna get loose, yeah?"
Still there also is the 5-star Savoy Hotel, which came into being around the time Sherlock Holmes did, too, in the 1880s. I highly recommend exploring both inside the hotel – you can get chocolate treats there, no expensive hotel-stay required! – and behind it, with its strange little tucked-away streets.
At almost eight-years-old John was a much better crier than Sherlock. It took two seconds tops before he went from uncertain sniffles to great walrus-sized sobs.
He may not yet be the legend he will become, but Sherlock's already got every gift he will need to embody that legend and he put those fine deductive skills to flawless use now, knowing when to lick, when to push his tongue inside, when to moan "more," as if he didn't already have everything John could give.
What should have spurred Sherlock to crawling up and clamouring on, well it didn't. It slowed him down and Sherlock
But Sherlock was talking so fast he might soon create a sonic boom. He was also moving. So fast. Not that that was easy to see. On account of how fast he was moving. All this because of all the coffee. He'd ingested. Quite quickly.
Sherlock wants to say things right now. A dozen things about helping, about trying to help and how they
and he couldn't tell if John wanted to beat the shit out of him or screw him and it didn't matter, the guy dropped the damn bat and flew like one down that alley and—hosanna!—right into the brace of waiting coppers.
Sherlock is afraid that if he looks up the man—that John will be gone. And Sherlock doesn't look up because he's afraid John won't be gone. Instead Sherlock turns each napkin over. He writes.
John sits down beside the bed and for a moment he reaches for Sherlock's hand and then shyly he doesn't, just rests it on the bed.
She's heard every single possible thing—yesterday a thief called to report a thief in the house he was robbing—and before a minute is up, help is dispatched.
Sherlock reads those two dozen words a half dozen times, snaps his laptop closed, texts the tech who'd done the tox screen on the dead child. The next day the father is cleared of the poisoning charge.
Sherlock's stiff-backed silence said more than words. Mike chuffed out a breath, nodded at nothing. "Well it was good, the McCann case. Everyone at Bart's was glad to help.
Sherlock watches the man nod, a quick bob of the head, and turn away awkwardly, his cane in the way of a woman pressing past.
That green bit next to it is a cafe but I personally think Greg is heartily sick and tired of their offerings and if he has one more
They've talked about this. A lot. For years. Because John thinks he shouldn't even though he constantly does, while Sherlock knows a well-placed curse most certainly has its uses.
And maybe I'll sort of back you up on all this because let me be honest: I've not had any locum work in a month and I sit in this coffee shop four hours a day sometimes and this would be the most stimulating thing I've done in weeks."
Lestrade closed his eyes. If he didn't see what happened next he couldn't be called on as a witness.
"What's this white one with the little bells and how about this one is it also gonna make me deaded also my grampa grows tomatoes and they're called
"You said 'oh dear god no this will never work I absolutely can not wear glasses so help me.' I'm just asking why."
It was at this point that John realising the painfully obvious: this well-dressed man was not the sex store clerk for which he took him...
"I thought it was an accident, that someone made a mistake. They didn't. They got it perfectly." John squatted, laid his fist over the inlay.
From that pretty spot Sherlock helps to remind John of the beauty of his beautiful city. And of the ever-abiding love of his Sherlock.
Yes, that, the hand-holding, it's one of their things. One of the seeds that grew into the beauty of ritual.
Symbols matter, which is why humans make them, and anything can be a symbol. As a scientist Sherlock believed in formulas, but as a human being he'd just learned he believed in signs and portents, in the rightness of a man because that man bore a scar like his own. And though those scars weren't alike, not really—the bullet that got Sherlock wounded only muscle and flesh, not bone—it was still a symbol, one that meant they were alike right where it mattered.
If it's weird that remembering the children they were makes the men they are become horny, they don't really care. They've never cared about things like that.
Sherlock had stood solemnly in front of John's mum and asked if he could help and John's mum looked at Sherlock's dad, who nodded yes.
So since that would happen to everybody, obviously it wasn't John's fault when getting bored happened to him.
He knocked on that tatty downstairs door in an over-familiar fashion, didn't realise it wasn't even half seven and the tenant—
time. John was on a long weekend's leave in London and the world was only them inside Sherlock's tiny bedsit.
The man is hot and cold, sweating but John can feel it prickling his skin with goosebumps. He's still pushing, trying to crawl away from the pain but there's nowhere to go but deeper into John's arms. Wrapping one across the man's chest, dialing 999 with the other hand, John holds the man fast but the man keeps fidgeting so John keeps dropping the phone and now he's moaning in deep hurt again, so John dips his head, presses his mouth to the man's ear and murmurs low low low, "Hush, love, be still. Shhh."
Dance with a man long enough—it may take precisely six weeks and twelve lessons—and you may learn that you can love him. And that he can love you.
Sherlock pulls the duvet to their chins, then wriggles a long arm out as his husband settles. He brushes his palm over John's fresh crew-cut.
Another beep soon calls John to another donor's couch. There he fusses over the machine while making polite conversation. It's a slow morning, with just three donors and John the only one on the floor. Becca's on her break, Tariku won't be in until the lunch surge, and–
Meanwhile, at the other end of the supermarket aisle the dark-haired four-year-old beg-shouting at volume is every inch a Holmes, so he clearly belongs to Maureen Vernet Holmes. Maureen's second son was right now holding a spiky bit of over-priced produce hollering, "Yeth mummy, yeth! Dwagon fwoot! We can get it becauth it roarth!"
The man Sherlock turns to face is short, serious-looking, and gesturing to the bartender. "Wallace…uh, he told me you're the one who, who was…" The man frowns. "These were…you never answered…" He hands Sherlock a small stack of cocktail napkins.
Dance with a man long enough, your hand on his shoulder or arm or hip and, if you're quiet like John Watson, if you're observant like Sherlock Holmes, over time you'll see things, learn things.
It takes a few more blinks, a glance at his own feet, then turning down his upturned collar, but finally Sherlock Holmes steps forward, and into John Watson's arms.
For example, the Eye may go green for St. Patrick's Day and all over red for Valentine's. During the Olympics in 2012 it was red-white-and-blue all at once. During London Pride it may have all the colours of the rainbow flag. One time it was yellow and neither of them could figure out what holiday that was for but it did make for a nice change. Usually the London Eye is one colour and that colour represents whatever company currently sponsors it. When EDF Energy sponsored the Eye, the large Ferris wheel was blue most times. Now that Coca-Cola sponsors it, the lights are usually red.
But John didn't. Some instinct told him instead to whisper and so John did, not knowing until three weeks from now that whispers are kryptonite for Sherlock's libido. "What's the second thing?"
find them. There's no other way but forward and I've not come this far only to lose sight of the objective.
Be that as it may, when you go to a doctor whose treatments focus on organs of a sexual nature, such physicians need to know the range of things you may do with those organs. So there were checkboxes, so many checkboxes on so many forms, including those that said gay, straight, and bisexual. While everyone currently living knows there are more sexual orientations than that, what was
Sherlock could have hastily removed his hands from their non-professional pausing place. He could've castigated himself for his poor portrayal of a spa employee. Instead Sherlock did something else. When John Watson—who indeed isn't an idiot—said…
Another nod at nothing and John takes hold of the humidor's brushed silver door handle, tugs, feels the soft whoosh of cool shop air.
"Or you can buy the detective inspector's next drink and socialise like a civilised person, what do you say Mr.…?"
By the way, if they don't feel like going to the park, John and Sherlock may walk along Regent's Canal, which flows through a large part of London and lies between Regent's Park and Primrose Hill Park. It's a pedestrian path that weaves by the hectic commercialism of Camden Town, through the fussy charms of Little Venice, and on past new and lovely flats built right up to the water.
As if in immediate proof John Watson frowns, sighs. Then with a rueful smile he presses a palm to his belly. "You deduced about the diet, didn't you?"
Then, as now, John didn't agree. He needs…danger's not the right word, it never has been…he needs…exhilaration. John needs stimulation, anticipation.
Standing in St. Bart's courtyard, Stamford chaffed his hands warm. "Well this old pile is lucky to have you, John. I'm glad you're here."
The bartender groans, stumble-trips away and to his knees, and he looks for all the world as if he's about to crawl under the bar and hide in shadow like a wounded cat.
"It's very hot," John said and held it further out so Sherlock could feel. Sherlock did, touching quite gingerly. He peered close, tongue out the corner of his mouth, and said, "It was a bee, wasn't it?"
The limping man with the quiet eyes turns back, already looking down, so familiar with helping strangers, so lost now there are no strangers to help, and he goes carefully to one knee in an over-bright sandwich shop and says, "My name's John. How long ago was the injury? Can I take off the sock? Ah, this is a bit not good. Does it—"
The moment they start waltzing the DI wishes he hadn't drunk so much. He didn't think he was going to do anything but wear a suit and sit about telling Sherlock what to do, for once. "I'm Greg, John. Uh, no, just Greg. Lestrade. I'm Greg Lestrade."
It was good Sherlock went away though, and it was good that John followed in his footsteps, first with the army and then his own stint at college, studying medicine.
Sherlock started picking at the skull-and-crossbones plasters laddered up his shin, leaned close and whispered, "Tell me."
The boy with the pretty name blink-blinks and then switches teary-defensive for stern-determined, poking his lispy tongue around in his mouth until he seems satisfied it will do his bidding.
The driver gives up, begins inching his big truck forward, and that's when John Watson slides fingers around the away man's wrist, skin on skin on sweat-slick skin…and the tall man keens.
Sherlock looks over the well-dressed bureaucrats in their fancy clothes. The air reeks of politics, perfume, and ministerial intrigue. Yet the longer the music plays the happier everyone seems. Sherlock frowns, confused.
The autumn day was warm, John was walking past St. Paul's, and there was Mike, waving from an outdoor cafe table.
He'd collected nine pins from a teacher and three other kids, and with them John carefully stitched Rosie's belly together while Sherlock leaned close, huffing mucusy little wheezes against the side of John's face.
Maiko grinned, leaned forward in her chair. "A waltz at a wedding, I do love them. I have just the instructor for you, John. Unique. I think you'll get along. Tomorrow, six pm?"
While he spoke Sherlock had watched John's reflection in cafe glass and only when that reflection went wide-eyed with dismay did Sherlock realise what John's expression had been
That would have been that except when John and his mum were called in to see the doctor John went into a bit of a panic.
A sensitive boy who can see hurt and sadness in another, will soon learn to hide those things in himself when he's called
Oblivious to the approaching storm, John Watson continued chatting up the vampire. When she was busy, he let the werewolf chat
The man doesn't know he's banging his head against the window, John's sure of that. John's less sure of himself as he comes alongside the stranger and says in what he hopes is a pleasant voice, "Bad day?"
Tongue suddenly busy lick-licking his lips, John crossed his legs, placed the bear across them, and John Watson proceeded to perform safety pin surgery.
John Watson doesn't wait, simply reaches for Sherlock's hand, murmurs, "Hold tight," pulls and swings behind his guest.
The man doesn't know he's banging his head against the window, John's sure of that. John's less sure of himself as he comes alongside the stranger and says in what he hopes is a pleasant voice, "Bad day?"
Apologising as he stepped on a woman's foot, begging pardon as he elbowed a man in the ribs, John turned forty-five degrees in the crowded—
Sherlock doesn't care that it's Remembrance Day. And he doesn't care that the mud's wrecked his expensive shoes. What Sherlock does care about is the short man standing at 'his' grave. Strangely annoyed, affronted, he's about to turn away when the man sees him and says gently, "She was so young. Was she your friend?"
He frowned, pretty sure that that was only supposed to happen after kissing things and other things. Then he remembered he was drunk and therefore probably listing to the left again and so he took hold of the wall very casually with both hands.
Since he was about eight years old Sherlock's known what to say to get what he wants. Most of the things he has to say are by necessity lies but that's fine, if they get him what he wants he'll lie all day. And this doctor knows the Scotland Yard detective inspector, the one who
They both glanced away then, suddenly shy. John looked at all the eyeglass frames. He thought about disguises. Sherlock looked at the white Perspex walls. He thought how easily blood would clean from them.
To state it more plainly, eating out John's arse will be one of Sherlock's many pleasures in life, as will sucking John, bathing John, cuddling John, bickering with John, being married to John.
A blonde little boy who sees hurt and sadness in another will learn he wants to fix those things, but isn't always sure how.
One day in Regent's park nearly eight-year-old John learned that he was a dab shot with a flower head. This led to learning he was even better with a Sig Sauer P226R.
The desert taught John how to be the kind of doctor he wanted most to be. Taught him about the part of the Hippocratic oath that said warmth and sympathy were as important as the surgeon's knife, the chemist's drug…or his own damned ego.
He looked down at his brand new diary. "I don't even know why I'm doing this." Still and all, DI Greg Lestrade is a completist and so he completed.
Which is why Sherlock sometimes comes to Abney Park cemetery, slow-wanders its muddy paths, stops in front of an old monument—one made new with the addition of the young woman's ashes—and he shows his gratitude to her with a moment's pause and a silent
Some tones of voice halt even those disinclined to obedience. Even when slurred John Watson’s was such a voice.
John stands just inside the cafe door and realises he never said that to the hospital administrator, the one who seems to love just three things: Healthcare, opera, and matchmaking. No, John hadn't said anything because it never occurred to him that it would occur to her he was gay.
This wee park is surrounded by other buildings, so it feels sort of tucked away, still, and quiet. In the park there's a tiny fountain in the middle of a little pond with goldfish in it. Anomalously there's also a half dozen banana trees and, dotted behind them and at the edges of the park—which used to be a graveyard—are headstones.
So right then, instead of answering the doctor with a lie that would get him what he wants, Sherlock answers the man with a truth that'll get him what he needs.
Maureen was the worst. She never said anything to the people who came to teach Sherlock biology, English, and history, not one word. She simply sat in on each lesson, usually thinking about some abstruse detail vis-à-vis combustion, yet her mental distance was not at all evident to the tutors, each of whom believed themselves weighed, measured, and found wanting.
Sherlock stumbled back, slid down the wall. "He's dead, Lestrade. Frozen to death by the time we get to him. Just…"
A massage therapist touched her elbow. Dr. Clare Sussex startled. Then, smiling ruefully, she decamped with speed.
"There is," said Sherlock looking down, skin all prickly and hot, "six sorts of blond in your fringe."
and he really likes both those things and so, that's the whole reason little John Watson—"I'm not little I'm six!"—did what he did and so obviously he is blameless.
Drawn to an earthy scent and the amber and russet glow of open cigar boxes, John enters the tobacconist's humidor and—
Sherlock made eye contact with the short man. He'd been planning on grinning smugly and saying something like, "Well he
he is. The other thing the man behind him did was apologise. Sincerely. And the third thing the man behind him did was to do all that in a kind and gentle voice.
Long minutes later the small man shifts, sits back on his heels. "Good job," he murmurs. "Good. Thank you. Thank you, that's good. I'm John."
"It was by a rock," John said in explanation, while Sherlock nodded as if he understood. "It doesn't hurt any more," John said happily, and Sherlock nodded again, as if he understood.
Not that Sherlock would say that to the man himself, because Sherlock is in this biker bar as a preliminary for a case, one that'll be far more 'intriguing' than Lestrade's sewer strangler. That this case has required the purchase of shiny latex trousers and seven inch heels is beside the point, and
These two things led to a couple other things: Sherlock immediately trusted the boy and so Sherlock answered him.
And in the end the TV producer who had been the real target of the dastardly deed was unharmed. She would go on to have an extensive and busy career producing a great many sitcoms, too much reality TV, and a long-running night-time soap.
That's what Mycroft always answers when John asks, "No, but really, when did you and Greg actually leave that day?" but John knows that that answer's bollocks because John's positive he didn't start moaning until
He did something else entirely, as if it explained everything. "My name is Sherlock Holmes. I'm a consulting detective. I solve murders."
Three months later the little boy—his name was Amadeo—came with his dad to 221B. Sherlock gave the child electron microscope scans of bees. John gave him one of his military medals.
John didn't say that, wouldn't say it any of the times his colleagues complained about a patient. Neither of them had served, neither had put a soldier back together to a soundtrack of moaning because the morphine was running out and most of the oxycodone had again "disappeared."
Ha! I just noticed my own pun! But mutiny is very appropriate here because this is about Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes. I know you're a brand new diary for 2021, so you won't have heard of him, but he's a big deal in dead body circles, and I used to have a crush on him.
This is his city still and she has known good and she has known bad, and London town, she has survived it all.
This time Sherlock's waiting for it, and sure enough, John shoves him with a shoulder again, only lighter…and for longer. Eventually Sherlock says, "Did I pass?"
If Sherlock's lesson took place in the back garden the tutor inevitably found Altamont's thin face peering alertly from the window overlooking the picnic tables on which books were spread.
Maiko Mayfair, third generation owner of Blue Crane Dance Studio, nodded sympathetically. Dance with people long enough, hold them close, your hand on their shoulder or arm or waist, and if you are quiet and attentive and very like Maiko, you'll learn to see. Observe. To hear the meaningful places where people pause. There was something her client was not saying. She patiently waited for him to say it.
"Yes, well she still wants to dance with you. You can tell by the little swaying motions and the fact that she
John doesn't know their story, he doesn't know why the brothers show their obvious love for one another with bickering and eye rolling, but John's a healer, right down to his bones. If this is what his patient—well, ex-patient—needs, then John doesn't see what harm saying yes can do.
before Mycroft realised that the foul effluvium coming from his little brother's butt had been…planned.
Sherlock was given pause. Over the years many sobriquets have been applied to him. He's been called a dick, a prick, an annoying bastard, an arrogant shit and, most memorably, a freaky little fuck. However, until today no epithet has included the word
Where most people would lean away from such a nugget of not-quite-right, John leaned toward. "In their bedroom?"
Sherlock pushed into the auditorium. Scowled. Humans milling everywhere. Almost every seat taken. And people were
A sensitive little boy who tries to give another boy a big bunch of Valentine's Day carnations will learn that his teacher thinks that's wrong when the man tells him, "No John, no. Take those back. Boys don't give other boys flowers, that's not okay."
"—since Friday." Mrs. Hudson handed Sherlock his post, placed one remaining item on the hall table. "Mrs. Turner's daughter served with him and when I told her—"
If you've wondered what biscuits, tea, jam, or honey John and Sherlock rub onto one another, eat, or otherwise experiment with, wonder no more!
This was fine actually, as Altamont discovered a tutor who would pop in on demand, coming over when Maureen was teaching somewhere, burning something, or otherwise physically occupied elsewhere.
The man gestured to one thousand styles of eyeglass frames, nodding his head briskly. An ordinary person just then would have looked at that man, then looked around them, wondering:
The second that chaos of dark hair peeped over the rim of the roof John Watson lost his shit again. Not even thinking that dogs don't climb ladders, he saw that big mess of blackness and started shrieking "Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck, fuck, fuck
One person in the crowd is the small, uniformed man Sherlock convinced to dance with Greg. Even with a ball-gowned woman between them Sherlock can smell the rare scotch that was the price the man asked for his matchmaking aid.
It is at this time that both men drop their gazes. It is at this time both become acutely aware that neither of them is, well,
Because his neighbor's correct. John lets Johnny buy his beers because John's flat fucking broke, but if he doesn't get out of that bedsit now and again he's going to open his desk drawer one night and he's—
In the morning John says little while Mycroft says even less but with far too many awkward words. In his rarified occupation the elder Holmes is used to expressing a certain stiff-backed gratitude, but so rarely for himself. How do you thank a man for your life?
Harriet Watson blinked, blasé. "A high-class rent boy? I have no clue. Maybe. Probably? I've seen others here."
John turns to his bombastic workmate. "You're right! And now you mention it, I think I'm craving chips Tari, a big pile of chips. From the chippy. Across the way. Yes, that's where I'll go for lunch today."
Sherlock Holmes does not allow himself to be 'set up.' Sex, love, romance—they're pursuits for the terminally
Finally John turned, could still only see in peripheral vision…a black curl? He wanted to holler at the man behind him And?
When he's had a good day there's no one who's a bigger fan. Those days you'll hear Sherlock praise himself for stunning deductions, spotting obscure clues, or for phrases turned just so.
Near the station are cafes, restaurants, and the Landmark (where you might recall Sherlock briefly became a French waiter), as well as supermarkets, businesses, and Western Eye Hospital, but even with all that there is, in truth, not much reason for the boys to wander over to that part of town often, unless they're craving those pasties again.
What he actually does is study him, as if Sherlock can't see him doing it. He looks at Sherlock's slicked-back hair, his tight black button-down shirt and shiny trousers. When Sherlock turns sideways, as if that will somehow make him invisible, the man's gaze drops to the ripe curve of Sherlock's arse and then, grinning close-lipped, the man looks away.
Yet other times it's one holding the other's hand against his chest as they slump on the sofa and watch TV, a finger idly tracing love lines they don't really believe in, yet still smiling soft when they see that those lines are etched deep.
The man was tall and dark-haired and gesturing at his left leg. "It was a stumble against a kerb. Nothing at all. It's fine."
Sherlock licked his lips for the eighth—no, there he went again—ninth time, then pursed the elaborate bow of them. "Oh that's amusing coming from a man who can't—"
Anyway, now I'm lost somewhere in Wandsworth because all the street signs use some sort of indecipherable Celtic font, I can't find the driving college, and I feel it's unfair for John to expect me to wander aimlessly. That is why I'm sitting here with my coffee and a muffin and in a minute I'll tell the barista I know she's having an affair with the town librarian. I'm sure this will lead to a lively conversation and that I can then— [Sherlock, we've talked about this.]
Eighty seven minutes later the drugged child was removed from what would have been his tomb, three feet below that tell-tale heart.
Unlike 'last time,' this time Sherlock Holmes slicked up good and found John Watson's arsehole on the first go. He set to friskily pounding his way toward orgasm as he read case notes over John's shoulder.
In lieu of a reply Sherlock Holmes lay back down and serenely opened his legs, his arms, and his mouth.
Sherlock grinned wider. He poured his tablemate some very good plum wine. And flick-flick-flick, his gaze meeting the gaze of a man who reflected back to him
Hands and knees pressed together, John Watson's body language was not just closed, it was locked down tight.
"I, uh, don't understand why they did them all at once either, but I do understand that it's led to a bit of a traffic jam for the one room left and I'm sorry, but we've had to institute a time limit for—"
"If you were a woman would you wear these?" John Watson blinked earnestly at the six-foot man with the fine coat, then blushed and looked away. "Uh, never mind, that was a stupid question."
And there, among a thousand disguises, John Watson and Sherlock Holmes began falling in love. They'd spend the rest of their forever there, decrepitude be damned.
I’m hoping that a peek at the inside and outside some of the more famous (and pretty) railway stations will help you give verisimilitude to your
It was easy enough to see there were none on John's left arse cheek. There were also none on his right. That didn't mean there weren't any to be found in the
"Mother fucking fuck," John muttered, and then after a good minute and a half of getting out of each other's way they'd got themselves situated right way round and John drove an entire quarter mile around the parking lot without anything going wrong and then, for no good reason whatsoever, Mr. Perfect held his clipboard to his chest and his thighs eased open and John was so distracted he drove right up onto the nearest kerb, which was a good twenty feet away at the time.
And every home in which I've been there was only an electric kettle, never one on the stove top. Electric kettles are always plugged in and must merely be switched on at the base and then turn themselves off when the water boils.
Now, the thing is, if you ever wanted to write your own version of that scene but wanted to use a different setting, you could do that. Because though Arthur Conan Doyle chose for the boys to meet at St. Bartholomew's hospital, there are other hospitals at which they could have met, ones as old, and at least one far more beautiful.
The two start…something…in those comments. Sherlock pretends he's ignoring it. Pretends he always checks his comments twice an hour. He pretends he doesn't look up "that funky cafe near Waterloo station; you know, the one with the French clock outside?" And he pretends a case brought him to that same cafe the day the two men meet.
Hands and knees pressed together, John Watson's body language was not just closed, it was locked down tight.
Sherlock waved his hands frantically, as if surrounded by chalkboards on which he was hastily erasing his accusation of
It started with the sergeant's complaint—"You'll only be in the way!"—it continued inside and at volume.
John Watson took a few moments to review the data. Shortly he deemed it sound. He'd just spent many years getting through med school with Mike, he knew the man was not only a great surgeon but a matchmaker through and through. John also deemed the voice of the man behind him
Even if all you're feeding your coronation chicken to the birds, the girl who's sweet on you at the sandwich shop gave you a nice little
This time John saw who was yelling because the man was holding his arms out and turning in circles, very clearly clearing the space around him.
Sherlock Holmes reached across the shoe-strewn table, plucked the heel from the short man's hand and said, "Describe her in three words."
Sherlock's ready now, would be on tip-toe, rising to meet the next word, if he weren't purposely keeping himself still. "Yes," he murmurs.
Greg squints owlishly at the dance floor. He breaks into a cold sweat. "Dance? With you? I'm…we're…"
The twelfth kiss was a long time coming and that's one reason John knew who the kisser was. Again, John has made himself fairly available to a fairly wide array of people on this earth and you learn a few things being so easy—uh, so experienced. You learn that sometimes people pick fights because they want your attention, and sometimes even tall know-it-alls are too shy or awkward to go about it in the regular way.
"—insulting." The short-haired biker is standing up and looking down. "So why don't you just take your bad attitude, mister, and go fuc—"
It's not something John does often in actual fact, but sometimes, when Sherlock's worked too hard or not hard enough, when he's depressed or the joints of his soul are out of true, John'll wake himself early and he'll creep down beneath the duvet, then slowly and carefully he'll lick and suck until Sherlock's cock stirs itself awake, hard, wet.
and so long as you set it in East London there probably won't be a single person to question you. To see a great many more signs, and much larger,
Slow fingers running down a shower-damp belly, Sherlock watched a skitter of goosebumps form exactly where those fingers touched. He was fascinated by that comet trail, so he lipped then laughed when new gooseflesh tightened John's nipples into dark, pink buds.
"If you're, uh, finished there, we could get a pint. Grouse about women. Or the rain. Or who did those stitches at the back of your wrist because that's just criminal."
Lestrade stood still, so much more weary now than he was just minutes ago, his body already rounded with defeat.
John reached another corner. Tapped his toe onto another dark starburst. Watched a grey-haired man tiredly usher his crime scene crew from the room.
Smart, certainly. Smarter than his tutors, his brother, nearly as smart as mummy. With a bit more time Mycroft is reasonably certain he'll match the sharpness of his mother's mind if not exceed it.
John never finished the thing he was going to say, the thing that went something like, "Uh no, I meant why don't you loudly and inappropriately say how inappropriate their behaviour is? You could even make it more uncomfortable for them by tugging at your trousers suggestively and say their behaviour is making you
Now, every few years, one of them remembers something from that first time they met. Every few years, usually when they're lazily spooned in bed at night, staring at the rain on the bedroom windowpane, one will say, "Remember…?"
There was something about the man's sass and decrepit knees and that too-long fringe that had Sherlock staring at him myopically.
Though he knew what wet dreams, masturbation, and orgasms were, Sherlock had been convinced he was above them. Then he woke from the first because he was doing the second which led to the third.
Be that as it may, all Sherlock knows is that if he wants to continue not caring about something as dishwater dull as
But here's the thing: The man behind Sherlock had just done three extraordinary things, three things
So as he does with all the donors who find themselves no longer capable of giving a good scratch to a sudden itch, John has a tissue draped over his index finger, and is holding it right in front of Mr Holmes' nose. Mr Holmes leans every-so-slightly forward and scratches himself against John's finger. His sigh is mighty.
They've played the game since they were children and let's be honest, they'll never be grown men, not with each other. So the game is ever on, the one where a bored Sherlock follows a busy Mycroft, trailing him from one dull embassy to another, from Downing Street, to the Diogenes, to Scotland Yard (the only place of
Within five minutes of that first date John Watson had shown Sherlock Holmes his pretty rope collection, then how to make a rainbow-coloured surgeon's knot, a chain sinnet, and a lark's head. They then proceeded to run around the Watson back garden screaming for no reason whatsoever for the next two hours.
In peripheral vision Sherlock Holmes watched two women hesitate, then pause on their way through the kitchen.
Writing Sherlock fan fiction is made easier for me because I now live in London. I can literally peer over the side of a bridge to see if it's feasible John would jump from it to go after a *&^%$# cache of evidence dropped in the river, I can say with conviction how unlikely they are to take a cab past Harrods on their way to Brixton (I'm looking at you Moftiss).
What Sherlock loved especially this morning was the jeans that had made their way in a bunch to the foot of the bed. He barely remembered kicking them off last night, falling into bed half-drunk and giddy. Right now they were a perfect mound of soft roughness between his legs, so Sherlock humped and squirmed and huffed.
"They should tell the whole story. The papers," John says, fingers now whispering gentle and light over Sherlock's arms as he withdraws this, swabs that, sets to placing plasters. How John knows that Sherlock knows what he means he can't say, but he does.
Then one day, about three months ago, a man appeared there and he acted like those others, the ones Sherlock ignores. And then he did more. He…helped. He asked for nothing back, not Sherlock's acknowledgement, not his praise, and not his dignity.
As if they already had between them a history of trust given and trust earned, Sherlock Holmes gave John Watson his poorly little bear.
On the ground John strokes the gelding's soft side. "Mike belongs to an old army friend of mine. Now and again I get to take him out for a bit of a bareback stroll through the park." The man smiles. "I'm John."
* Go back to the map of the park and where you see the words "The Regent's Park" you'll see what looks like an ant hill, a bump, right below an orange/white circle inside which are the words The Hub. That because right there is The Hub the
So just as John's thinking he'll come back to this pub tomorrow, just about the time he's thinking he's found a comfortable place where he can settle in with a whisky and self-pity, well right about that bloody time the damn bartender leans on the bar, bends at the waist and he
The thing to do with fools is ignore them, and so at first everyone does, tourist, trader, and the man motionless in their midst.
I can't say I know of any particular honey as being particularly well-loved here and maybe this is because I haven't seen lots of honey in British kitchens. I'm sure it's there, but it doesn't seem a product heavily used in my limited experience. About a third of the folks I know do seem to sugar their tea, but I can't recall anyone putting honey in it.
John asks if World Cup preparations have bunged up everything in London, if the Lance is done yet, if city hall is still ugly.
John holds Sherlock tighter and rocks him gently, "Tell me why you're sick sweetie, do you know? Can you tell me?"
So people leave him alone, he leaves them alone, and if it's a rainy Tuesday and the only bodies in the pub are himself and the barkeep, all the better.
John knows when people will hear. Yet even when he knows they won't, he talks anyway…because sometimes it's he who needs to hear.
"What a pretty name. It sounds like a mystery, doesn't it? Mine's John. That sounds…that sounds…hmmm…"
A dark-haired little boy who seems too long in some places and much too big in others, will learn to reflexively respond when kids shout, "Hey bobble head!"
He came to this conclusion when he visited a urologist recently, a visit necessary after a case Lestrade had promised was "intriguing!"
* The first image in this wee series of photos needs no introduction and if it does I think perhaps you’ve wandered over here by mistake. The Doctor Who fandom is to your left behind that blue door, Supernatural is behind those wings, Avengers behind that green door, and Kingsmen through that interesting wardrobe. For those that remain, Our Boys need no introduction and so we move to image two.
And now this stranger, on bad knees of which they must not speak, squinting far-sightedly at him and grinning a mouthful of nice teeth.
No one does that any more, do they? Cutting in? Except maybe a man who always carries an umbrella? Except a man whose equally stiff-backed brother says mating mores?
Maureen turned too and blink-blinked quickly to somehow clear the ringing from her ears. "Yes actually. He taught himself; just like his brother did. They both have two library cards."
stories, whether you write the boys ducking inside one to take cover from the rain, or have them running to catch a dawn train to Cardiff or Oxford.
Sometimes John likes waiting. He can rest then. When there's nothing happening there's nothing against which to rail.
But the driver's not really such a fool. Before long he begins cajoling the crowd, joking, teasing, complimenting, and in slow degrees shoppers clear the road, make way for the man with a van full of Bond Street knock-offs.

Marylebone Railway Station is the closest railway station to John and Sherlock. From here you can catch trains across the UK, while beneath the railway station is the Marylebone Underground (the tube) which takes you across London.
Even though he is only just six, some part of John Watson already recognises defensiveness, understands shouting at a bully before they can shout at you. Except John isn't a bully even a little bit so he says, "Therlock is a pretty name."
Because on a summer evening Greg loves to sit outside the pub with a pint and watch the foot traffic and the market and just…just appreciate the city he loves. When he has time to stop. And think. And see.
This behaviour of course drew most eyes. When Sherlock began shouting about evidence—the phrases diamond-embedded false eye, conjunctiva, and
Eventually most people settle down. As fluids flow into the machine from one arm and are returned, minus platelets, through the other, some daydream, some watch the bustle around them.
"I was right. What happened to you was awful. But it didn't happen the night you were shot in the alley. It was a long time before that, when you decided you're not enough. And what you're afraid of now, more than anything, is that you'll never be enough, not for anyone, and so every day you go about the busy business of making sure that that's true."
But John and Sherlock were polite, they waited until the boy was long gone before laughing themselves sillier still.
His resolve lasts six days. Five if you count walking past twelve times. Three if you count the discarded replies he writes on a stack of old post. Not even one if you include his repeated rereadings of the man's note.
Sherlock showed up at the cafe forty-five minutes early. He fidgeted with his hair until it was a finger-twirled nest of curls. And he wondered if strange men kiss other strange men on first dates and was coffee in a park cafe even a date and…
Back late my arse. Both were home a few hours later because you can't have a stakeout when you smell of sex urine. I did try to tell him.
detective. Right away that man went and said a few fateful words as he walked into John's tiny office. Those words were these:
Greg Lestrade made embarrassed noises. "Sherlock Holmes isn't my…he's… After he fell he didn't want to stay. Let's just say I've learned to take precautions."
Sherlock then chatters about how that grey-dusted fuzz feels against his flushed nipples and his neck, how it makes the one pebble up and the other tickle.
I've not written one of these since I moved away from London in 2017, but I lived there five years, I've been back during covid, and no matter how much she changes, London remains pretty much the same.
John Watson placed his empty glass upon the kitchen table. He hitched up his jeans and lifted his chin. He hadn't gained a three continents moniker by being shy, retiring, or disinclined to say yes. While he hadn't precisely been sweetheart to the regiment, even he admits it was a close thing.
Sherlock sighed, as if at the end of an exhaustive lecture. "They put together profiles, perform case studies, but of course they don't know because they don't see."
"That turned out to be harder than I'd anticipated, which was why I came to this very boring party—although I figured out who's leaking all the best bits of ongoing cases to the press—and got extremely drunk. So. There. Now you can kiss me. Which means you put
Then it was Al's turn to tickle Fate with his reply. "Well, why don't you bring him with you? Surely it can't hurt."
The train lurched because that's what trains do, and Sherlock let the motion press him against the ill-tempered man with the sweet-smelling mouth, and yes, oh yes Sherlock saw. Saw the little man flush to his hair line at the unexpected press of an expensively-clad
Sherlock Holmes will deduce anyone, any time. He'll deduce you before he's met you, he'll deduce you after three words, he'll damn well deduce you from the teeth marks you leave in your toast.
This time Sherlock was not given pause. Because Sherlock will do anything for a thing he wants and he long ago ceased being on speaking terms with embarrassment, shame, or self-consciousness. So the good detective clasped his hands behind his back, he bowed at the waist, and he inclined his shaggy head and he said soft and sweet and low, "Please, Dr. Watson?"
But that summer day Sherlock taught John something as important: He taught him that sometimes appropriate isn't. And polite? Polite is just another name for starvation.
he must get something sperm-like into this cup. And there's the…rub. Due to long years of abstinence and despite quite a bit of effort, Sherlock finds himself devoid of a certain critical necessity: An erection.
"I missed you," John said again, only it wasn't about a trip to the loo, it never was. "All my life, I missed you."
always take pains to ensure these two meet no matter their when-or-where, heaved itself a sigh of relief.
Sherlock could feel his cheeks flaring red and before he let himself notice the same flush on John's cheeks Sherlock sat up straight and, looking out the window, said, "Which was ridiculous of course. On her mating flight the queen rarely flies higher than twenty feet. She has sex with up to a dozen drones, who do not feed her honey while they mate. After he has sex with the queen, the drone's penis is ripped out of his body and so he dies on—"
"I will kill your little brother and hide his body," whispered Lestrade into his sweetie's ear, to which Mycroft Holmes replied in such ribald detail that Greg giggled like a hormone-addled schoolboy.
John liked to do that, to think about things. It was interesting and it gave him something to do and John very much liked to be busy, being a naturally sorting-out sort of boy.
Which isn't often enough, really. Oh he's trying. He hangs around the morgue downstairs, or up here in the cafeteria, waiting for that DI to come by again—he's here often enough, and sometimes he listens to what Sherlock says. That last time…Sherlock knows something clicked behind the DI's eyes. That maybe he realised Sherlock could be of use.
Sherlock looked up at a little boy at the same time as he hastily scrubbed the back of his hand on the grass. "Um, no." Sherlock sniffled again, wiped with the back of his hand again. He looked at this mess too, made a face, then scrubbed his hand on the earth again.
There are six regular posters to The Science of Deduction forum. Most leave comments nitpicking Sherlock's methods or conclusions, his morals or his manners. Of course Sherlock replies to these. In detail. The day they're posted.
And so it went, for months, and then for a year, until Sherlock finally found his footing in school. Even so Maddy stayed on awhile, until Maureen was asked to write a book and the whole clan moved closer to Harrow, where the professor would have more ready access to the only fireproof lab in London.
It may have been intriguing to Greg Lestrade, but it was raw sewage to Sherlock. Literally raw sewage, in a tunnel beneath Charing Cross, and through which Sherlock waded hip-deep for a quarter mile. While he got the garrotter at the end, Sherlock also got a spectacular urinary tract infection because, well,
when he did the first best thing he ever did, according to the John two years hence. Sherlock leaned over the small table and whispered so softly John had to come close, close enough to feel warm-as-summer breath against his skin. "Then again, I suppose mating for hours and hours…with…with one single drone…I suppose that's a lot more romantic." Then Sherlock smiled.
At that first lesson John saw Sherlock looking longer than necessary each time John stood straight-backed and not-quite-tall.
Then John waited until they had been talking for a half hour, until they had made each other laugh again, and until the woman at the table behind their table had left before he finally leaned over and whispered, "Did you really have a dream where you were…you know…and then you…you know?"
"You want to know a thing you can do to get back at your brother? I did it to my sister once and she hasn't come into my room for a
After recovering that priceless emerald vase Holmes was on every other front page. A day later, after finding the two tiny kidnapped heirs to whom that vase belonged,
When John asks why Sherlock's asking they spend part of those seven hours talking about the cases Sherlock's had (well, almost—but he leaves that part out), the deductions he's made, the experiments he's done.
"See? There?" Sherlock pointed. "The lecturer. His posture, that chin-down gaze, the hands clenched tight behind his back? He's recently entered into a sexually satisfying relationship. Finally getting all those submissive tendencies tended to. But he's worried his ex-partner will find out…she's the director over there, trying to figure out what's different about him."
And didn't look away. Or move. He just kept looking at John, one big hand holding the sofa, and John didn't ordinarily think thoughts like
Of course Sherlock can read the man's story in his posture, his haircut, his coat, which is why his apparent sentiment is surprising. Intrigued Sherlock doesn't turn away, instead he steps near and asks, "What's a friend?"
John opened his mouth to say something but what Sherlock had said was a little bit true so he closed it again.
Eleven seconds where Sherlock side-eyed his student, mesmerised by the pugnacious lift of his chin, the way his chest moved as he hyperventilated, the pretty whiteness of his bulging knuckles, and it was only when John licked his lips that Sherlock groaned and by that time they were up the back end of the battered prop car put in the parking lot for just such instructive instances as this.
No, Sherlock's mind isn't on a case that doesn't even rate a number. It's on the three-sentence note in his hand, the one he found tucked in the antique card catalogue just inside the pub's front door.
After decamping to the sitting room—the kitchen could no longer contain the interested parties—Sherlock paced the small space left and laid down ground rules.
Sherlock now knows exactly how far this will go…all the way up his street if he lets it. He is emphatically going to let it. By denying it entirely.
Sherlock rose. "Though perhaps you won't need to be. I've got my eye on a nice little place in central London. Together we should be able to afford it."
As they'd been doing for the last hour, everyone in the therapy group turned toward Sherlock. The newest in their small group of five, most kind of welcomed his annoying interruptions. Because sometimes you lose patience with your own misery, and foisting your pique onto an irritating stranger? It does make for a nice change.
Sherlock does like running, but he doesn't like being confused and his new friend is talking so fast Sherlock can't hear a single, solitary word.
By the time Lestrade got to the actor and the anesthesiologist there wasn't even disdain on Sherlock's part or much interest left on Greg's.
So, those are the best bits about Primrose Hill Park really, but you can see lots of the city from your perch on this pretty hill and over the years Sherlock will take John there quite often, both mornings and nights.
Chin to chest, still smiling, the man sips his drink and gazes up at Sherlock. That's when Sherlock decides to gather evidence.
"Holy smokes that's even prettier!" John grins toothily at his own words because they are true, the truest true of all the true things John knows. John also knows that he really likes how happy his words made Sherlock. Finally, he knows how happy it made
"Oh that thing's just for show," the owner had said when he'd started checking each white cubby for clues.
Sherlock Holmes narrowed his eyes. Of all the things in all the world the soldier could have said just then, that word was the only one which would have intrigued. Because Sherlock belatedly observed the obvious: the soldier was interested in him.
So John points out the bright red or blue or rainbow colours on the London Eye off to the right. They both like the Eye best when there's some sort of event going on and the colours of the lights ringing the Eye reflect the event.
* As has been mentioned, St. Mary's rooftop is suitably high for fic that may want to keep with certain BBC-canon facts. I will say no more about this. *breathes into paper bag even more* *is woozy*
Madam did not move for many moments. Madam was busy pawing through her mental Rolodex, wondering which friend could be bribed to call her with a sudden surgical 'emergency.'
And though he knew many things did Mycroft, he would never know what brewed within Sherlock such a ferocious stench that day, one so foul Mycroft was rendered actually kind of stupid. He did know that the rest of the lesson passed in a shallow-breathing haze. He knew that Sherlock acted as if nothing at all was amiss. Mycroft also knew that he did not go into Sherlock's room for…well for maybe a whole
They stop and smooth as you please the small man dismounts. Before either of them has time to school his expression to placidity Sherlock is hopefully looking down at John hopefully looking up.
Suddenly Sherlock was bored of being bored. He was bored of being inexpertly probed by a young man who only thought to become a sex therapist because he could make his girlfriend come just by talking to her and somehow they'd both thought that would be a really popular skill for a sex therapist. But that was neither here nor there.
realised he was, like some old codger, aiming his ear at the man to better hear him amongst the bar noise.
Both men looked up from Sherlock's gory scrape. Both sat upright. Neither said a word. Then John made a long arm and grabbed his patient's file. He didn't look at it though.
"I know! But Mycroft doesn't! He says it's stupid and derivative and scientifically inaccurate and since I'm studying for my GCSEs I wasn't supposed to even be at the cinema and so he told on me and daddy came to fetch me."
This would be a big bug-bear for Sherlock Holmes in his adult years and without any provocation whatsoever he'll often launch into a nearly-Shakespearean monologue about the elegance of
"—right here." Sherlock then opened his mouth and sort of dragged his finger down his own bottom lip.
John never did learn that his mother went to see Mr. Reder, tearing so many strips off him that Reder ducked his head and apologised every time he saw her afterward. Even twenty years later.
"Who told you—" John shook his head to clear it of spiked eggnog and annoyance. He would not be diverted. "I don't know who you think you are, mister, marching around telling me about me, but I'm positive I can and do you want to know why?"
While the biscuits thing is no surprise, you'd really think that, as a medical examiner in London, I'd have seen so many murder victims that I'd be incapable of even thinking mildly mutinous thoughts much less homicidal ones, but there you go.
Another crisp turn, this time back toward the table. "How did you…did my boss…uh. Yes. Please. But it's actually a mocha latte."
as loud as he possibly could and for good measure threw two empty cola cans and a rock, striking home with all three. He was rewarded when the black hair went away.
He was always pleased with himself after, when the pretty plants all had their nice border lined up again. Grandmum said all that shifting was going to give him big muscles one day, and John always crooked his arm then and made a muscle-y face.
This is a strange, bitter-sweet, easy-to-miss park in London but it is wonderfully well worth visiting. I think John and Sherlock know this place. I think the first time John went there he felt like he'd found something precious, because indeed he had.
"Then there's your careful shave, the tuck of your shirt, the expensive wine but the cheap cheese: You have a date with…your boss?…which means
Sherlock glanced at the expensive Oxfords. "My brother needed a new pair anyway, those have a scratch. And I like these better, don't you?"
Right there, in an over-bright store somewhere north along Regent Street, neither man could possibly know that seventeen weeks and several minutes from this moment the only things getting
The day after that Sherlock starts to reply to John's comment with a thank you. Then Sherlock deletes it. Instead he types out a terse:
Sauntering over, sitting by the man, matching his smile precisely, he gestures vaguely to himself. "Gay or straight?
Sometimes the boys nip inside and get themselves a pasty. John usually pats his stomach and says “I shouldn’t,” then John does—if Sherlock agrees to share one of the cheese and onion. Somehow John never complains when Sherlock then buys them sweets from the chocolate shop just left of the pasty vendor.
But not knowing isn't the same as not being sad, so even though he wasn't supposed to stop in the park on his way home John stopped. He didn't realise he was pulling the bouquet apart and he certainly didn't realise he was hitting ducks with a marksman's precision each time he chucked a flower into the water.
St. Thomas' hospital is also closer to 221B than St. Bart's, but only just a bit. Though again the journey to this hospital is more interesting, what with the need to go through downtown London and cross the River Thames.
No one stops John from roaming, grinning reminiscent, touching pricey lighters, deep-bowled pipes, shiny wooden boxes.
and how to say "—you'll need much more than that to prove I'm an insensitive arsehole detective inspector," but Sherlock did not know how to say
Yet John Watson's many things, and one of them is dutiful. Which is why, on this long autumn day every November, the captain and doctor does his duty: He visits a London cemetery—never the same one; it would be impossible to know the resting place of each of those he served with, cared for, or simply once knew—and John puts a poppy wreath on the saddest grave.
After several silent seconds John nods again, rises. "Right. Good. You should—" He stops. Starts again. "I'd—" No. Never mind. He knows when people will hear.
As the group clattered off John checked his watch. "Damn, I'm due in outpatients." Stamford nodded. "And I'm late for a lecture. We'll get a pint soon."
So over the next weeks and months the boys worried one another well of their little hurts, then over the months and the years they worried one another well of their big hurts, even when they were the reason for the hurts.
For four seconds Sherlock Holmes blinked his way through a half dozen separate trains of thought. Then he wrote
John Watson is now nowhere near Sherlock Holmes' nipples. Instead he is nestled snug-tight in the divot of Mr Holmes' belly button, giving it a good rummage. They are both pink cheeked as Sherlock moans his relief, and at this point John is beginning to have suspicions. John is hoping his suspicions are correct.
There were at least three scientific fallacies in that, but Sherlock didn't point out even one. Instead he leaned forward again. John met him halfway and they had their third kiss. Then their fourth.
Except when the loonies rang up. Or loony, because he just had one, a deep-voiced git who wanted pints of blood, or eyes, or left thumbs for Christ's sake.
You let them move the killer's corpse, Lestrade." Sherlock bent over, hands on knees. "I could have found the boy, but you let them touch
This meant that the first few times John Watson and Sherlock Holmes had sex they were twenty-years-old, keen, and on a schedule.
knows which sandwich Greg wants. Last month he'd bought them both soup and a grape pot because Greg was again thinking he wanted to lose weight, but today—yeah, Mycroft's there today—the British Government's got them both a ham and cheese toasty and Greg is so happy he thinks he'll kiss him.
"My mum wore glasses when I was a kid, got contact lenses later, but until she did I always went with her to pick out new frames. She called these sorts of places—" John gestured to the one thousand frames around them, "Imagination rooms. Isn't that wonderful? Maybe you can just think of it that way. Each pair of eyeglass frames is like a new disguise."
"I was a queen bee," Sherlock Holmes said to the studious psychology student. And then, because he does not much truck with psychological interpretations that are not his own, he added, "I'm sure you'll say that means something important."
Right about this point John should have tugged his shirt back up, hidden his scars away again, but he didn't. And that? That more than anything is what changed everything.
Sitting in that waiting room, tongue shoved out the side of his mouth, Sherlock wrote that in by hand so carefully it appeared typed. And then he checked the box.
When frustrated, Greg Lestrade doesn't vent his spleen, clench fists, or grind teeth. He doesn't roll his eyes or make a moue.
And so everything went back to normal, where normal is broadly defined as Sherlock being brilliant and annoying, Lestrade being long-suffering and grateful, and winter turning into spring turning into summer turning into a very lovely autumn evening.
Instead fourteen-year-old Mycroft Holmes had weaved his fingers into the bench's iron lace and made himself still by holding tight. Because courage is something we teach ourselves, Mycroft knew. So he held tight. And tight. And tight.
It's not that the man's particularly pretty. He's all right in a compact, loose-jointed way. He moves comfortable in his skin. And it's not as if the man's easily-overheard repartee is all that winning. Oh, he gets on, makes people laugh, but anyone can do that. Even Sherlock can pretend to be nice.
A couple days after that day in the park John learned that his mother knew many swear words, so, so many, when she learned what John's teacher had told him.
Lemon curd isn't jam, it's rather like a very thick pudding in consistency and it's lemony and custardy and quite good. I don't see it used a lot on toast but it must get used somewhere since it's usually sold by the jams.
Sherlock hissed, "Thirty-eight police. Thirty-eight police touching everything, papers, clothes, evidence,
Sherlock did not mention the deerstalker had been a gag gift from several of the assembled officers. Instead he channeled his inner dick—no real costume for that—and said, "Constable Singh, the vampire? She's married I'm afraid, to the werewolf actually. But constable Ketty, the cowboy? I hear he's quite free.
When they arrive in London neither is met at the airport, and for approximately ten seconds both are sure this is over.
So when Beth R. asked me on Facebook what the shore of the Thames was really like, saying that when they found the dead body in
When finally the grass had seen quite a bit more of Sherlock's fluids, and John had found a rather doubtfully-hygienic tissue to give Sherlock for wiping, they sat there and just breathed themselves calm.
When I am near Mr Gentle Hands Quiet he makes very loud mouth noises that Mr Fast Talk Biscuits calls 'sneezing.' If you are a young pup and don't know what sneezing is, it is when a human's mouth does not like your fur and so does a loud explosion to keep it away from them.
Though why John, well past thirty, had had the childish expectation that he'd be running down dark alleys with police, he wasn't sure. In the end he was on rotation between a half-dozen city boroughs, where he gave flu jabs to detectives and constables at the end of their shifts, and he explained the difference between a virus and bacteria vis-à-vis antibiotics.
John went wide-eyed with shock. He looked at his hands. At the tatty flowers slapped down to bridge slats. At Sherlock. And then
Is a friend someone who nods when passing you in the shops? Do friends pick up your post when you're away? Do they notice you skirting crime scene after crime scene and one day tilt their head in your direction until a distracted detective inspector looks up, looks over, then finally
John Watson says it softly, a mantra muttered through pressed-thin lips, but it does not stop the pain.
The fly in Sherlock's analytical ointment was that people can't just decide to fall in love. Though they certainly can
The sixth time wasn't at all planned and maybe that's why they both came so fast that they this time actually had time for lunch.
A few asides that have appeared true from where I'm sitting: British folks don't seem to dunk biscuits in their tea. They
So when that final kiss came John did what he had not done for any of the others. He leaned into it, he opened his mouth to it. And when he heard the faint baritone moan in reply, John licked into Sherlock's mouth and whispered, "I win."
Hearing these few highly unusual words in a sinful baritone so surprised the good doctor that he reflexively turned to gape at the man who'd purred them. His movement was so sudden his coffee cup swirled round and round on its saucer in a sort of ballet. John watched it do this in the slow-motion way of one who has enough time to realise something bad is going to happen but does not have time to stop the badness.
Sherlock's not sure. He is sure of one obvious thing: constable Willa Tyler helped him when she had no reason to help him, and she changed his life in the doing of it.
The patient—sitting up in bed, eyes closed, both hands elegantly gesturing as if placing small things just so—stopped what he was doing, opened his eyes, and then his mouth.
One stride across the tiny room and John's got his hand on the gasping man's belly, whispering in his ear. "Breathe here, right here. Breathe deep until you feel it here."
John Watson spent many years in the military. John's dealt with his fair share of big gits desperate for attention. He's learned the best way to shut them up is to feign deafness.
Lurking and listening for ten long minutes, Sherlock heard nothing. Not a single footfall, not one shifted tea mug.
Sherlock stops writing and Sherlock doesn't look up. He wants more than anything to look up. He wants more than anything for John to come back, to be the brave one.
It wasn't that the other children on the playground had said anything mean. No, they hadn't said one single thing at all, and that was the
Dr. Clare Sussex straightened her tipping turban. She stood up. She gazed down at her beau of eleven weeks. Semi-reclined in a chair that looked half torture device, half sex-aid, her boyfriend was manicured, pedicured, coiffed, polished, and scrubbed. He was in the final phase of having his most personal of personal places artistically barbered. And how she had missed his leap from their agreed-upon casual dating to
So for the next twenty minutes John offered the warmth of his attention and the sympathy of his regard. An hour later, he shared a spare five minutes. Then later another ten. And when John was off for the night he pulled a chair up beside the man's bed and listened to him talk, and sometimes John said "amazing," and sometimes "incredible," and when John said, "I need a flatmate," the man was unsurprised to hear himself say yes.
The dozens of drawers had been empty—except one. A folded serviette, on it ten words, the scent of ink still clinging.
He doesn't know how to do this right, he doesn't know how to use the fire to make light, he desperately wants to illuminate, instead he turns everything to ash.
Shoving hands in his pockets, John frowns, and reflects that this is the very quickest a blind date's ever gone sour. Except is it a date? If the person you're supposed to date is the entirely wrong gender then—
Montague Street is a one-block street, at one end of which is the British Museum, while the other end turns into Russell Square because, interestingly, that's where Russell Square is. Yes, the site of Sherlock's youthful accommodation ends at the park where in BBC canon John Watson meets Mike Stamford.
First thing you want to know about New Scotland Yard (NSY) is that it's supposed to be moving from where it is on Victoria Street, heading closer to the city, nearer where it was born actually, if I understand correctly.
This is a strange, bitter-sweet, easy-to-miss park in London but it is wonderfully well worth visiting. I think John and Sherlock know this place. I think the first time John went there he felt like he’d found something precious, because indeed he had.
This was when John responded on instinct. Watching Sherlock nurse (that was the only word for it) filled his mouth with moans, made him want, and so he turned onto his belly, spread his legs, and whispered "Sh-Sherlock,
I'd like to talk about one of London's gorgeous old hospitals, one you can put in your Sherlockian fics and though I don't want to start with this I'll start with this. *breathes into a paper bag*
moan. By this point John's so completely visualising what's going on behind him that some fast-beating, butterfly-winged bit of him is giddy, flattered, and suddenly empathetically horny. He's thinking a whole range of sexy things and he's about to maybe say something when there's a knock on the door and—
then goes on to say because Sherlock has no reticence at all about anything ever is that John was so excited after their dangerous little escapade concluded twenty-six hours later he clapped both hands over Sherlock’s ripe behind, snogged him senseless, and
John stands, but doesn't take the billfold. Instead he frowns up at the man and for long, awkward seconds he knows something's peculiar, knows he's overlooked a vital clue, misread the—
To be honest, Sherlock didn't think it could be, but just in case he said, "My brother stares really, really good and he can make dogs run away and also—" Sherlock still clutched John's hand super tight, but with the other he picked up a rock. "—I'll hold you and you can hold this. You throw really good."
a six-and-a-half warranted the risk of permanent disability, but Sherlock was not a giver-upper about things on which he should emphatically give up, and so Sherlock used his deepest, soothingest voice to calm Mr. Sexy—uh, Mr. Stroppy down, but that just made the tiny man more sweary for some reason and so everyone shut up and got back into the car and everything was good for an entire eleven seconds while a preoccupied John drove resolutely toward a parked car.
They met again the next day and then over the next years, doing lots of things together and then things apart. They moved to different schools, then different colleges, then, for awhile, different cities. But they always came back to London for visits, they always emailed each other and IRCed, and so neither was surprised when their friendship blossomed into romance, not too long after John returned from Afghanistan.
The words come with a sneer, then the man remembers himself, smiles with his eyes but not his mouth. "Uh, sorry. You surprised me. How do you do Mr. Holmes?" The man stands, offers his hand.
Both men leaned over the plump corpse and peered. "See the slight swelling around that puncture by his wing? Easy to miss but it looks like a bee sting. May have been allergic."
The two boys got along like fire and fuel. At the top of their lungs they shared with each other everything Maddy taught them, then everything they learned on their own. Including the highest mountains in the world, coffee drinks—
Which is to say that is why six-year-old John Watson was sitting half under a shade umbrella in this little cafe in the middle of the park, watching his mum talk to some teacher she used to work with over there by the hydrangea, and John's bored, bored,
By the time they're ready to board John's nearly one hour past his next pain pill and Sherlock's dumped his down an airport loo.
Clutching his jeans with sweaty hands, sitting alone at the airport gate and seven hours early for a flight that'll finally take him back to England, John rocks in his plastic chair and whispers
That first kiss was ridiculously soft, which made John think it was a man trying to kiss the way he thought a woman would. He was wrong. And right. It was a woman trying to kiss the way she thought a man would kiss if he was trying to pretend he was a woman (yes, she was overthinking it).
Sherlock now knows exactly how far this will go…all the way up his street if he lets it. He is emphatically going to let it. By denying it entirely.
By the punch bowl Gregory Lestrade was deep in conversation with a St. Bart's toxicologist. Off under one of the ridiculously bright lights Bengamen Haddad was showing off the ring his wife had bought him for his birthday. And Dimmock—John still didn't know the man's Christian name—was sidling up to the buffet and pretending this was not his fourth go at the Christmas biscuits.
Reflexively John Watson began picking at the moustache bandage on his elbow, leaned even closer and said, "I'm John." What he said after, he said right up close to Sherlock's ear, soft and whispery, evil and
The game has no set hours because Mycroft keeps to no clock. While London sleeps, Sydney, Shanghai, and New York scheme and then too does Mycroft. So it isn't odd for Sherlock to again pick up his brother's trail as he glides down the Duke of York Memorial steps near midnight, and it isn't odd for Mycroft to see Sherlock's shadow shifting near those wide and lonesome stairs.
The DI closed his eyes. "He didn't kill this one, Sherlock. The boy's still out there somewhere. We can find him."
of words and images bunched up in his head, fire trapped behind a door. He's tired of opening the door and watching everything
…and John said yes, sure, and then oh really, and they went and they ate, and they talked. Oh how they talked.
It had to do with how a friendship that will last a lifetime began, how two children together grew into men.
a sort-of meta (okayed by AO3!) which I'll publish on Tumblr too (link below so that you can see more and larger photos). Without further ado...
His umbrella contains a concealed sword, his Italian shoes are steel-toed, and he knows three martial arts, including one of which no one's ever heard. Even so, some god-forsaken little terrorist got to him just a few dozen feet from the Diogenes.
goosebumps skittering frisky along his skin but he sure felt them. He turned, in peripheral vision could still only see a bit of straight, sandy hair. He whispered back, "Mike did this not on a drunken dare since he hardly drinks. He did this because he wants us to meet each other."
Sherlock smiled right back. Accepting that wordless challenge, he stood, stepped up onto his own seat, then armrest-walked a dozen rows down, until he at last jumped onto the raised stage.
And another thing that wasn't his fault is that nobody told him there would be whipped cream and chocolate
John could almost actually hear the man thinking through the various permutations of this. And he saw the moment the man arrived at the exact wrong one. Mostly because the man was suddenly panting sexily in his face.
Like a mutual love of great big dogs and a hatred of cola. There's also the thing where they get crepes up in Crouch End every other month, and the one where they throw rocks on the water in the park's boating lake.
John was drunk, drunk, drunk. But somewhere deep inside John Watson was quite sober, somewhere that mattered. So he whispered back, very carefully, very sweet. "Imagine I said that other part. The nice part. Let's leave that in, all right?"
John'll keep going on dates he can't afford, and he'll buy rounds at the pub on too many nights, and because John's a betting man he knows it's just a matter of odds: The more he tries, the more chances he takes, the more likely he is to win, right?
"It hurts, it hurts," he kept saying, clutching his hand to his chest, hot tears running down his cheeks.
* St. Mary's is beautiful in a way I find eerie and old-fashioned. With its two-toned brickwork, its wrought iron fencing, its plethora of arches and its walkway joining old and new, it seems a very suitable haunt for a troubled ex-soldier doctor to meet a pale man in well-fitting suits and with a head of Byronesque curls.
Oh, and the big man standing motionless in the middle of the room? Gaze judgmental and posture imperious? Not one hot
Sherlock watches John's careful hands awhile, then shrugs. "They want the dramatics, not the…not the detective," he says softly. Then he raises his chin as if to take a punch, but all John does is hold out the tray full of a dozen colours of surgical tape. Sherlock says nothing, but John knows what he means anyway. So John picks.
"Just out for a fuck then are you? Have enough friends you can't imagine making more? Well bully for you, mister, what a tender world yours must be."
A half hour later and Sherlock seemed more than happy to accept the magazine. After the brief moment of bonding they, as always, stretched out on Sherlock's floor in deference to the dozen books they were using and they were a mere half hour into the lesson before Mycroft realised that Sherlock had had absolutely no interest in being pacified.
Sherlock reached, grabbed the first frames his fingers fell on, donned them. He barked a startled breath and stepped back. Dear god he looked like his year one teacher. He looked exactly like Mrs. Kleoette.
ask," with a tip of the head toward Cesare. Then Sherlock had planned to follow that up by chuckling in an appealingly genius-like way.
But the man doesn't hush and it's not all right, not until John gets it, flash-quick and clear as day, so he presses his temple against the man's and he whispers close, so his breath is warm right on down the man's neck, "Be still little love, be still."
Sherlock's eyes did that thing again, the opening wide thing. People didn't usually offer to help him. So yes, he wanted that. Very much so.
thing Harry brings out in him, along with too many inconvenient truths—when the man with the thighs that
The burly man blinked. He released the slim man. The slim man started to say something strident. John belched and began to say you’re welcome. The burly man punched John in the face.
Fortunately Sherlock Holmes doesn't understand appropriate and he's even less familiar with polite, so when John lets him go, when John starts to step away, Sherlock wraps his arms around the man's shoulders and, sweetly, strangely, he rocks John and whispers, "Shhh."
Sherlock drops an apple. It's the only green one in the batch. He feels briefly bad about that. Now the man won't have any green apples.
It's noon on a summer day and Portobello Road is full of bodies, a shoulder-to-shoulder crowd surging slow along a meandering mile of this, that, and the over-priced other thing.
John Watson squinched his eyes closed, but this failed to shut his ears. The baritone rumbling to his right
John grabs Sherlock's chin, turns him so they look right in each other's eyes. He makes a hissing sound through pursed lips and nods
…and then there he was, all straight-backed and small and smiling. And unequivocally, plainly, obviously
And what he wanted was to stare down at his sandy-haired seat mate and flick-flick-flick past the obvious—military, doctor, alone—to observe the less obvious: This small, silent man thrived under fire. Oh how interesting.
Clad in a thin and faded t-shirt he's the rock around which these human rapids flow, and because this is high noon on a hot London day, the bodies pressing against him are as bare as he. Their sweat-slick arms rub at his, they are so many strangers and they push past him, skin against skin against skin.
No, John didn't say any of that. Instead he made a big manly sniffing noise to show that he was straight, and he tilted his chin up to give the pretty man's mouth better access to his mouth, and he waited.
Marks & Spencer's food is well-made and nice. Their sandwiches are nice. Everything they sell is nice. Pricier than Tesco by about 30%, but very
Sherlock wriggled some more, until he had his trousers and pants pushed down to his thighs. He started to rut against John's jeans and John half-wondered if half-page articles in
John Watson blinked. Coughed on his surprise. He blinked some more, until his vision cleared and he finally saw a woman, not a wall.
His little round face was such a hectic red he looked like a rocket ready to launch or about to blow.
Hooper is calling me in for dinner. Ordinarily I'd finish my vital work for my brain rebels at stagnation, but tonight it's Devon crab as we enjoy another episode of Murdoch Mysteries.
The point is gay bikers. Or straight bikers. Or actually one biker that could also be anything, everything, or nothing, there were no checkboxes for what the man seems to be, except jaw-dropping.
Professor Maureen Vernet Holmes taught mathematics at both Harrow and Westminster, performed experiments in the labs she had at each institution, and wrote a half dozen academic papers a year. And yet…and yet the professor still somehow managed to be at home whenever a tutor was in the house.
John had no idea what Sherlock was saying and Captain John Hamish Watson has heard the whispers of enfeebled patients while their encampment was under enemy fire. John Watson has superhero-level hearing when the need is sharp.
This became relevant twenty-one years later as Sherlock Holmes stood in the sterile confines of a sperm bank wanking room. (They have not called the room that. They have not called it anything except busy. "It's busy," the receptionist said, "because of the remodel. Hurry on.")
seems rude. John's not sure what he's about to say when he glances at Mycroft Holmes but when he does, John knows. Because Mycroft's eyes are pleading now in a way they weren't last night.
What John doesn't know is how to stop trying. Because if he doesn't ask the coffee shop barista out, or chat up the woman queuing behind him, or get the number of his psychiatrist's secretary
The man perched, tugged up his trouser leg, bared his shin bone. It was inflamed and scraped bloody. "Ah, that's your tibia by the way. Looks like it took—"
I've followed his instructions to the letter, and I can see the spot where I buried them even bears signs of my paw prints, exactly where each of the rotting thumbs should b–
The big man in the good coat put his purple strand down and belatedly administered aid by patting John on the back, continuing to elucidate. "For those that do, milking can lead to quite intense orgasms. Which, as a doctor, I'm sure you know."
John rolled right back and wondered how Daniel knew this giant git. All of Daniel's friends were nice. Gay and
Sherlock's not holding John's hand, nor John his. Their hands are resting together, side by side on the bed, close enough to feel the warmth from each other's skin. Sherlock looks at their hands and says, "Yes."
"When we went to the bear shop to make her they had all these things you could pick for eyes and heads and clothes and stuff and they also had these hearts you put inside with your secrets..."
all the way to the end of the aisle, then the good doctor joined Sherlock on the stage before he'd even asked himself why.
Sherlock leaned sideways, squinted at his own reflection in one of the big, shiny shop mirrors. Despite being barely two feet from the glass, he couldn't actually make out his own face all that well, what with the need for glasses, so he raised his eyebrows the better to see. His eyes went wide and—
Sherlock opens his mouth, closes it, then, eyes still trained on John's reflection, Sherlock says softly, "That man is lonely. He feels invisible. He tries too hard. But it doesn't make any difference. He's still invisible."
"When I first came up to London I had rooms in Montague Street, just round the corner from the British Museum, and there I waited, filling in my too abundant leisure time by studying all those branches of science which might make me more efficient."
"Actually," Sherlock said, his voice a full octave lower than the one he was using three minutes previous, "I was wondering—"
Another long minute, two. Sherlock releases the hand on his chest. The one on his belly withdraws. Sherlock sits up, looks around.
Sherlock opens his mouth to relay what he thinks of shadows and justices when Greg, tipsy and happy about it, talks right over him, "Now see here, I didn't ask to come to your brother's black-tie embassy do.
Taller of course, what with their seven year age difference, though Sherlock's recent growth spurt speaks of a height to match Mycroft's eventually. Mycroft looked forward to that.
He did not reflect on the fact that this somehow caused him to again hit the car he'd already hit. He didn't think about the fact that he never even wanted to learn how to drive a mother-fucking car. He gave not one moment of thought to the fact that Harry could just get herself around town by tube as she's been doing
Any questions do please let me know and, as always, read the comments for these wee chapters because it seems someone is always adding useful data!
The smell of chocolate is stronger now (John doesn't know the words mocha, or latte yet; he does know the words
Another duck got it right in the noggin with a heavy red carnation. It flew away with an indignant quack and Sherlock danced on his toes in agitation. "Don't! You'll kill them!"
Standing in the tobacconist's glass-walled humidor, Sherlock opens his mouth wider, takes a ragged breath, then does it again, again, againagainagain
"Oh for god's sake don't be tiresome. You can't betray your ex-lover. Besides, if this was a betrayal to her, then you did that six weeks ago when you had your long, emotional," here Sherlock Holmes tried employing air quotes but succeeded only in poking himself in the eye, "'talk' at Starbucks."
"Does it hurt? Where does it hurt? It's not supposed to hurt. When I booked this spa day I absolutely asked them if it would—"
The lop-sided grin he returns to each bar patron who buys him a drink, his casual acceptance when a few of the men touch his hip or back? Well these say he's gay. The combination hints toward an easy bisexuality, and it isn't until Sherlock's mind veers friskily toward the word
him. To his voice. Instantly John's voice drops half an octave of its own accord. Sherlock doesn't bother to mute his moan.
Another flick, another, and with each one John moaned, "Sher…lock, Sher…lock," and when he pushed his hand down between his legs and started humping, that's when wonderful became
John faded off, frowned, looked right into the pale eyes of the man looking at him. And then he said something brilliant, so brilliant as a matter of fact that Sherlock's brows lofted as high as they could go.
They smiled at each other then. And right after they did that, they did something else. They stared. Into each other's eyes. Except it didn't feel like staring now, it felt like diving deep, no need for air.
Sherlock narrows his eyes and finds he's waiting for another shove of that sturdy shoulder. Instead John points with his chin again, and says, "That man there. What can you tell me about him?"
"—and I did these absurd things so that I could show you how smart I am. On Guy Fawkes night the only reason I showed up at the Yard's bonfire thing was so I could show you that I could make a bigger more burny bonfire."
For his part Dr. Watson would spend the next six days, three hours, and twenty minutes—John didn't count, he just happened to, uh, know—thinking about the pretty bowing fool with the fluffy hair and the big coat. While he was thinking about him he'd think about things he'd been meaning to think through for awhile now, things about himself he wasn't sure about. Things he was pretty sure he was now pretty sure about. By the time Sherlock came back with the skull six days, three hours, and twenty minutes later John was sure and John was ready.
Countless times John's seen this silent cry for comfort: Hospitalised children clutching unfamiliar nurses, old men and women in care homes reaching out to any passerby. People die from this sort of starvation, John knows that, it kills as sure as accident or disease.
Sherlock squinted at Rosie, then at John, and did then what he will pretty much never do for anyone ever except John. He kept his mouth shut and waited.
Sherlock's never understood the rare commenters who wander briefly onto his blog praising him, calling themselves 'fans.' He always ignores them, certain that hidden in their words are jokes in which he is the punchline.
And then Harry was there, handing him a double of something brown and expensive and exactly one hour later Harry was chatting someone up at the bar, and John was drunk, slouched in a back booth, and—
John knows the date's not going well because she doesn't stop smiling, and he knows it's not going well because she hasn't looked at the menu, and she pushed the little candle away, and because she's been gone awhile.
Compact. Arms and legs held close. Flyer folded neatly on his lap. Not fidgeting, not looking around, not doing anything but sitting quiet, focused, inward.
So instead Sherlock calls himself terrible names and in window glass watches, and when the woman gets up with a smile, Sherlock does, too.
any of those times, they just wandered off after he sighed a lot and do you know what? It was fine, it was a-a-all…
To completely compound his error, the good doctor made an earnest face at his girlfriend. She made some sort of face back but he couldn't tell what it was through her mud mask. Not content with making a bad thing worse, John opened his mouth to make a worse thing awful when the dark-haired depilatory technician murmured, "I believe it's time for madam's massage."
"But despite these peacock displays you appeared unmoved. Eventually your ex-girlfriend—who, by the way, is smarter than half the Yard put together but that's not saying a lot except it is—told me that I should just tell you that I fancy you."
his cauliflower facts. This by virtue of a baby-sitting auntie who fed him "rice" made of the stuff, tricking John's tiny tastebuds so cruelly that it will be twenty years before he gets over his distrust of all brassica.
"Overheard you say you're looking for a flatshare. I've got my eye on a nice little place in central London. Interested?"
is probably where they buy the lube. Also I’m sure I went to a Boots that stocked vibrators. And not the kind that soothes sore muscles.
The third time Sherlock panted, "Wait, wait," and tried to get his mouth on John as he came. He ended up with as much come in his eye as in his mouth.
Detective Singh had only just left and John hadn't even had a chance to look at his new patient's paperwork, so instead John looked at his patient.
John finds one of his edges occupied by tall shadow. "Take off the coat," he says. Realising it sounds like a command, John grins to show it's not. "It'll make you look more approachable."
and that's about the time Sherlock told John to remove his hands from the wheel and that's when all the tussling started and the swearing, the fogging and the failing too, and by the time John finally took his foot off the brake and the stalled car lurched and hit the other car
James was impressed. "I'm impressed! My boy's more the hands-on type I guess. He taught himself forty different kinds of knots and hitches. And we don't even have a boat."
Though it turns out Sai triple-crosses everyone again, evading capture for many more years, John keeps the short hair until London gets cold once more. By that time his ears are erogenous zones.
John Watson chuffs out a laugh. Yeah, it's easy to read people at these things. Then again, that's probably the point. Here men and women are stripped to their basics, artifice almost impossible to maintain as they try speed dating their way to love.
While Cesare gathered his abashed thought, Sherlock decided to deduce the short, finger-drumming man with the appalling taste in coffee.
Sneering at the shoe as if it were someone else's opinion, Sherlock said, "Then no, if I were that woman I would not wear these. Wrong colour, the heel's too low, and they're positively
They reach to shake hands. John Watson sticks out his left because he's a lefty. Sherlock pokes out his right. Their limbs clash. For a moment they're holding hands.
They'd grown used to easy consults, deferential families, to nurses smart enough to protect their egos. They'd forgotten that when people were hurt they lashed out and
Sherlock smiled, told himself this could be good for his case, that with a little help from a doctor he could more quickly answer questions that had plagued him for weeks.
It is always fun to smell things, but it is especially fun when I find something the people want, too. Today I sniffed out an old glove in the marshes, and Mr Fast Talk yelled, "I told you the hide-out would be in Hackney John!" We kept sniffing all around the trees until I found a small cave. It was warm inside and had a lot of good smells, but my friends are bigger than me, so they kept hitting their heads and making weird barking noises.
Sherlock's about to do the expected: offer a marginal nod and turn away, when the small man does the unexpected: He plucks up a little round soup container and puts it in Sherlock's trembling hands.
and am happy for questions that may prompt future entries. Until then I hope this wee chapter and those already written offer bits of information about London and where the boys might go or places they might know will help you craft your glorious Sherlock (and other) fics!
The dark-haired boy looking at John seemed simultaneously murderous and terrified. John was besotted instantly.
That's the best I can do right now, just…eye stuff. Whatever you think you want to see in an optometry museum it's there. It's tiny, full to its rafters, and I think it's worth every effort to find time to see it. You gotta contact them on their website and who knows, since covid, how easy it'll be to visit, yet I can just say that me and my friend were the only two people inside pre-covid so…*shrug* Give it a go. It's barely even behind Charing Cross station, more to the left and a smudge up.
are what the boys would see entering the park from the entrance closest to their home. The middle image is the path they'd take, the left image is what they'd see if they looked left, the right image is what they'd see if they looked right.
The man takes a breath. Sherlock says nothing. The man takes another. Sherlock says more nothing. The man leaves.
John looked down at the man's motionless hands. Littered with small scars, not nearly as soft as they should be, they rested warmly and very
Sherlock's cheeks flush noticeably. He has the almost irresistible urge to cover them with his hands.
Walking across the lot, he looked so annoyingly GQ what with that thick hair curling perfectly against his collar, suit flawlessly pressed, light eyes slanting up just-so, voluptuous lips that—
and setting him up "with that cutie at the bank next time since the lawyer didn't work out," was no longer going to cut it as a John-learns-to-drive bribe.
Trafalgar Square's less than a quarter mile from the memorial steps—closer than any hospital or ambulance. Never quiet, the great square rumbles ever with taxis, tourists, night buses.
Sherlock threw John's trousers, with his brown brogues still trapped inside the legs, over his shoulder. The slightly-lethal package hit a new lamp that quickly became a broken, old lamp.
"I mean it mate, you tell her you're sorry or…" John closed his eyes, counted to five, unfisted his hands. Unfortunately these did not help, no matter how often the therapist said they would. "…or I'll tell everyone what you're so afraid of."
Charing Cross station has been there one and a half centuries, it'll continue on. And yes, Simpson's, as mentioned in ACD's canon, it's still there. As is "the rushing stream of life in the Strand," where this central station sits.
Reflexively John Watson began picking at the moustache bandage on his elbow, leaned even closer and said, "I'm John." What he said after that he said right up close to Sherlock's ear, soft and whispery, evil and
That's the one I think which saddens John the most. For Sherlock it's the plaque to Henry James Bristow, an eight-year-old boy, who in 1890 saved his little sister's life by removing her flaming clothes but himself caught fire. Oh but there are more plaques to solemnly see, including Alice Ayres who, in 1885, saved three children from a burning building at the cost "of her own young life," there's a plaque for Frederick Alfred Croft, a 31-year-old inspector who, in 1878, saved a woman from being hit by a train but himself was run over. There are several dozen more.
The lift doors open. Four people who were going to get off stay on. Sherlock's cheeks go a deeper red.
He'll be here in ten minutes John. We only have ten minutes to solve this case and you know how you get when we don't have time for—"
John crossed the room, held out his hand. Sherlock reached back. John tugged the tall man tall and all three people in that massive, empty room walked across it and to John's special corner. He tapped a toe onto the crooked…not starburst.
Sherlock opened his mouth but John placed a single finger across it. Sherlock left his mouth open but nothing came out of it.
The point is that the biker, the short-haired man with the big boots, the white vest, the black leather waistcoat and tight trousers, is…he is…Sherlock keeps staring at him because he doesn't know what the man is, except distracting.
John started to say something, but the tall man handed him a box, flicked out coat tails, and settled on a bench, imperious. John went to his knees in front of him, as if this were the most natural thing in the world.
John could do with more of these sorts of jobs. Just as with the locum work, the good doctor had Mike to thank for this, and
Not quite twenty-four hours later John Watson was neck-deep in the Thames, dragging under a thug who was holding Sherlock beneath the water. Six weeks after that he was sleeping with his neighbor. Three months after that he moved in with the man who would be his life-long friend. Ten months after that they were engaged.
"No," he says to no one. Splitting the controlled-release pill will just rush the drug into his system. He's seen soldiers get addicted that way, quick as…as…
Tonight's a danger night. After being shut out of another case—why can't he find the words to make them
When Mr Gentle Hands found a bag in the back, back, back of the cave, he yelled "Sherlock!" and made such excited noises I thought he had found cat poop. It was only lots of coloured glass called ruby that smelled like the old glove.
"Okay. Well you got it pretty bad with that cricket bat and I know you hurt like a bastard right now. Is there a way I can help with the pain?"
Still, on his way home from the library Mycroft picked up a cinema magazine with that ridiculous space pirate on the cover. How Sherlock thought she was—never mind. It was a peace offering, he didn't
I've also shared below a few wee things I have learned about these items. P.S. The prices you see on the photos were as of mid-2015...
And somewhere in those months between then and now Sherlock Holmes became something he would never stop being: He became John Watson's biggest fan.
"Good, that's good, because I'd really like to get back to the snogging, as you call it. First, I know that Grace doesn't care. Grace is the one who told you to talk to me, remember?"
But a bright, strange little boy can learn that he doesn't want to learn some things. If it's not okay to give Andy—who falls down a lot and always has plasters on his knees or his elbows or his chin—something pretty to make him smile, then John doesn't want to know
The man steps close and John realises he's a good half foot taller and smells… Christ, he smells like sex.
However, sometimes John makes exceptions. Oh my yes. If his last nerve is trod on, John Watson's quite willing to give big gits all the attention they so desperately crave. Only not necessarily in the way that they crave it.
Sherlock didn't look twice at the guy with the four science degrees. He talked over the gregarious ginger with the lisp. He actively insulted the banker and the writer, and when the coroner saw Sherlock again a week later, well frankly Lestrade's not surprised the man tried punching him. Twice.
221C has seen better days. The damp's mildewed walls, ruined carpet, rusted hinges. And yet the small man who couldn't possibly have lived below Sherlock
"Do you know who that was? That was the Shadow Secretary of State for Justice and Kicking Your Arse. She could've probably made you illegal. Just say no with a nod next time."
Or it was better, it was damn brilliant for awhile, because the bartender was even more spiky than John, who had said thanks after getting his drink and had received a withering glance in reply.
Maureen extended a hand; James shook it. Each then looked at the other's child. Each had ideas. Fortunately they had the same sort of ideas and within three minutes they'd made four summer playdates for their sons.
you said. Yes, well just remember, you did the asking and in the goodness of my tired heart I did the yessing. Now stop arguing each time I teach. And fetch me some more of this delightful wine."
crepe he'd try next time, since they came back to this tiny Crouch End bakery every other month because everyone in
This turned out to be lucky for Madeleine Hamlyn Watson, John Hamish Watson, and Sherlock Holmes, in that order.
Listen to me. I love these so much that if it were possible I'd fucking shag every last fucking one of them,
Though the boys don’t often catch a train from the Marylebone Station, preferring Paddington or Euston Railway stations, as they tend to offer more trains at more times…well, still, on summer evenings they like strolling past Marylebone—it’s quite literally around the corner, being barely a quarter mile away from 221B.
The man in the expensive suit with the pink socks and slick-backed hair was standing beside the good doctor's table.
John snorted in disgust and, not one to follow his own directives, squirmed in the chair to which he was bound. "Now you're just making shit up." John looked around for agreement but instead realised no one else was in the back garden. Apparently the entire party, meant to celebrate him and Mike graduating from med school, had moved indoors. This meant John was alone and roped back-to-back with an argumentative drunken idiot he'd not so much as set eyes on.
After a boneless little while, Sherlock oozed himself to the mattress with a contented sigh. John looked down, made a pleased noise at the gooey mess on his trousers. He has long had a thing for Sherlock's…fluids.
was a damn sight easier than giving two dozen kids their booster jabs, being puked on by two of them, and berated by the parents of three.
This time John stumbled to his feet, instinctually waiting for bombs or shouts, ready to command or be commanded.
Absolutely at the end of his ever-short tether, Sherlock Holmes stood up noisily, took three steps left, and sat down clamourously on an already-occupied sofa.
The gowned woman and a man exit the lift. There is silence. Everyone descends a few more floors. "Why did you pick me?"
And because Sherlock Holmes is the sort who will outlive god trying to have the last word, he glares at his coffee cup and says, "Why on earth do you care who or what I am. I'm
Though it doesn't much snow in London any longer, when it last did…that was 2012 as well…Primrose Hill Park was full to bursting with families climbing the tiny hill so kids could sled down. It was positively frantically full and so if you decide to write some mysterious thing happening in a story and you need a crowd, it'd be a bit original to set it in Primrose Hill Park during a surprise snowfall. I'm serious, the whole place was just packed.
(And where Atlin is about to finish her BA!) University College London (UCL) is also right there, as is the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).
It was then Sherlock did absolutely the best thing he'd ever do, according to a short speech John Watson would make at their wedding, two years from now.
"That's it, just like that. Can you get it down here?" John rubs at a suit coat-covered belly. "Right on down, deep and slow and…"
So when Sherlock did come back he was pleased to see he'd correctly deduced that John had deduced the things he'd needed to deduce. Though right then and for a good couple years after Sherlock
UL, UCL, and SOAS all buttress right up against one another and are right behind the British Museum, so it is barely any time at all to go from one to the other and if nothing else Sherlock could probably have skulked about attending classes as the mood struck.
If it was raining and the lesson took place inside, the tutor found themselves inundated with homemade eccles cakes, spiced rhubarb pie, and silky lattes made with Altamont's own La Cimbali M39 TE Dosatron.
Through valiant effort John eventually stopped coughing on his own embarrassment. In part this was because he's a battle-hardened veteran—hell he was once so close to extended rifle fire he was deaf for six hours—the other reason John finally got his shit together was because he was so fucking horny that two pats on the back had already left him half hard.
Sherlock knew that Greg knew that Sherlock would follow him down Strutton Ground to the pub just up from the Yard. There were seven questions he still had for the DI and Greg knew that Sherlock knew that Greg would grudgingly answer them in between downing the first of Friday's pints.
me?" John makes a noise that would be a growl if he were that sort, but he's not so it's just a big, cranky noise out of a little, cranky man.
The good doctor shifts so he's in Sherlock's line-of-vision. "No I didn't know you were a man, but you know what? I did have hopes for
Seven years older than Sherlock, Mycroft was taller, smarter, more stubborn and, most grievous of all, he thought it was wrong that Sherlock had gone to the cinema to see—
John opened his mouth to reply but a drunken, pontificating Sherlock did not notice. (To be fair, an abstemious, pontificating Sherlock also would not notice.) "I assure you that your ex-lover does not care that you are…that you're…" Sherlock's mouth was fairly sober but the part of his brain sparsely stocked with idiom was still pretty hammered. "…snogging me."
John took his finger away from Herlo—Sherlock's mouth. Automatically Sherlock reached for John's finger. He clutched that single digit in a sweaty fist ("It was not." "Yes it was. You were all nervous and turned on and
Half naked, bare legs spread in front of a man he did not know, John watched her go, cleared his throat, and said, "Well that went well."
John looked back down when he reached a corner. He tapped his toe onto the pretty starburst inlay there, continued pacing.
Both men shut up. Both wait because, though they may indeed be idiots, they are idiots who are aware that they find the other quite a little bit of all right.
However, sometimes Sherlock makes exceptions. Listening carefully, he carefully enters the code for one apple.
When a flash of sequins sparked in the doorway the good doctor registered nothing more than their gleam.
In a movie this would be the point where John stomps off, never to be seen again. John's also not the sort to let idiots off lightly, so he doesn't.
