Without thinking about it, Tony dropped his head all the way down, curling his shoulders forward. The motion triggered the helmet, which folded gently around his ears, and then down over his face. In a rush of light, the HUD came up. He curled his paws, and a display came up. Two fast blinks activated the jets. Tony hovered a foot off the ground, and then dropped back down. He looked over at Steve.
“Can’t have your paycheck falling overboard?” Tony tried to joke as the captain firmly sealed Tony’s hand to the rail, holding it there until he felt Tony grip it.
It wasn’t until the day they were set to leave that Steve realized how much he was going to miss it when they were back to their two-legged bodies. He didn’t imagine that Tony was going to want to curl up with him back at the Tower, or help him clean his face in the morning, or knead at his chest while they were falling asleep. For one insane moment he considered telling Riverstones that they didn’t want to leave after all. They obviously weren’t the first humans to wind up in this universe, or Riverstones wouldn’t have even known what a Two-Legs was, and Redskull could have survived the rat attack. For all he knew, dozens of human villains could be lurking in this peaceful animal world, causing problems. They could stay.
Tony fell into helpless babbling, and was only vaguely aware of what he was doing – apologizing, confessing, spilling out every secret, and every regret, and begging Steve to just let him come.
Riverstones suggested when Steve shoved himself out of the hole in a flurry of panicky whines and the scrape of his shield on the stones.
Tony replied. Steve sensed that he’d meant to it to be sarcastic and cutting, but he was obviously too sleepy to put much effort into in it. Instead, he sounded blithely unconcerned, and so comfortable that Steve found himself inching closer to the rock, though what he planned to do when he got there was beyond him.
The tunnel built out in front of them as they moved, and closed off behind them, keeping any kittens from getting lost. A few of them learned that they could get a free ride by standing at the back of the tunnel and letting it push them forward. Steve had more than a dozen of the tiny furballs clinging to his back, Riverstones had his own share of little limpets, and Tony traded off carrying one kitten or the other every few minutes.
“I did just say,” Thor pointed out with a wide grin, instantly breaking out of whatever mood he’d fallen into. He gave Steve a friendly jostle, and then chucked him hard enough on the shoulder to bruise. “Fear not! We have some of the best minds in this realm gathering here as we speak.”
“If this is how we’re going to do be doing team meetings from now on,” he said finally, forcing the tight line of his lips to soften, “You can probably just conference call me.”
from the depths of his dreams. Breathing in the steam, Tony set his forehead against the shower stall door and let the water beat down on his back.
Palpable relief ran through the crowd. Moonlight’s mate relaxed immediately. He sat back on his haunches and let his tongue lull out of his mouth. Sunlight hopped over to get in between his front legs and stared up at Steve with a kind of smug look, like he deserved credit for Steve and Tony’s presence in the village.
, Tony thought snidely. (Forest somewhere in Germany, the trees shattering around them, watching Thor on a digital display with data flickering in the corners of his eyes.
“I asked you to stay!” The words thundered in the lab space in sharp cracks. Tony realized he’d yelled and snapped his teeth shut. He didn’t yell. Ever. He took a few breaths – it was just because he was tired.
He redesigned Rhodey’s targeting system the next night and increased the efficiency of his thrusters by eleven percent.
“You’re in the lab.” Tony closed his eyes and tried to make his stomach stop twisting. “That way is the medical bay.”
He snapped his jaw shut and met Steve’s eyes. “Run, please, run. You’re so much stronger than this asshole, Steve. Please.” The tears traced worn paths through the grime on his cheeks. His eyes flickered down. Steve followed his gaze. He couldn’t see the bullet in any of the four exposed chambers. It was either ready to fire, or in the chamber directly opposite, three clicks away.
he demanded, but he held carefully still while Tony nuzzled against him. Entirely without his permission, his tail started wagging. Trying to make it stop just resulted in a weird series of jerking motions that set his teeth on edge.
Yawning hugely, Tony sat upright. He took a moment to pat at the armor plating on either arm, resettling some of the overlapping sheets, and then descended gracefully down the rock face with his tail up. He stretched luxuriously down at the bottom, upper body completely disappearing into the grass so that only his armor-plated ass and tail were visible.
When the slabs of still bloody meat were dropped into a wide, shallow box that seemed to serve as something like a table, Tony had only very reluctantly climbed down from his perch to join Riverstones and Steve on the worn cushions. He had found himself patting at the cooked meat like he wanted it to move, and he really
“Pull the trigger,” Kilgrave snapped, obviously and immediately angry that they’d taken their attention away from him.
Before Tony could say a word in his own defense, or even get his hands up to push Steve back, Steve was pressed tightly against him. Their mouths met with a sharp crack of teeth, and Tony tasted blood that he barely processed over the sudden realization that Steve was kissing him. How many times had he dreamed of having Steve’s arms around him before the world had gone to shit? And now here he was in an office he hated, being all but mauled by a Steve who didn’t like him very much.
As easily as he had sprung into motion, he found stillness at the base of a thick branch. He sat down, comfortable with being motionless in a way that he hadn’t been for a long time. Stretching out along the branch, he balanced himself comfortably, and promptly went to sleep.
Letting go of Steve’s waist, Tony wedged his hands between their bodies and pushed sharply. Steve’s back hit the door, and he blinked at Tony in confusion. Tony let him have a few breaths of wondering what the hell was happening before going after him. Their bodies collided, and Steve almost caught him in the groin out of reflex. Unexpectedly charging at a trained soldier, and at a man like Steve, was never a good idea, but it was part of the thrill. Tony knew that Steve could throw him across the room if it came to that, which just made pinning him to the door all the more exciting. Their mouths met again, and Steve finally got with the program. He grabbed the back of Tony’s head hard, using his grip to move Tony’s head into a position he liked. Tony retaliated by biting his lip. He grabbed Steve’s free hand and slammed it against the wall. It was an immediate struggle to keep it there, but it felt good.
The dogs’ house was at last quiet. Getting breakfast prepared had been a study in chaos. Tony had found himself a perch up on a shelf that kept him out of the way of the puppies, and had watched the scene in claustrophobic terror. Moonlight had quickly put Steve to work hauling cuts of meat out of what Tony guessed was an underground cellar. While the puppies had chased her with increasingly shrill demands for food, Moonlight had pulled the slabs on meet onto a hot stone to cook.
“Might not be anything,” Tony said. “There’s paint so dark that it absorbs damn near 100% of light.”
. His jaw got tighter and tighter, but his hand stayed gentle on Tony’s, thumb rubbing soothingly over Tony’s knuckles, as if Tony might be offended by the doctor’s lack of faith.
“Steve,” Tony gasped, “Steve. I found you. I found you. I came back for you. Can we stop now? Can we just go home?” He slumped against the ice, pawing at the snow. He could just barely see the glint of light off a silver star. “Please, I want to go home.”
Tony woke shivering and coated in a slick layer of sweat. He ducked further into his sleeping bag and wiped clammy hands across his face. His lips were chapped and salty with sweat and his feet were both cold
. He could still feel it reverberating in his chest. Looking down, he saw the panels of the suit going down his arms, but they were at the wrong angle, and they tapered down to paws.
On the other side of it, Stephen Strange stood with his hands up. His cloak ruffled up until it could perch on his hips like an irate mother berating them for missing dinner.
With concerted exploration, he found a depressed catch on the underside of his right foreleg, and a raised catch in his groin that he was able to depress with his nose. And okay, how had it not occurred to him yet that he was now perfectly capable of licking his own dick? Once the catch had been pressed, the locks down his spine clicked open –
Thor and Hank examined the man like they didn’t immediately recognize him (neither of them had been there the other time, but they’d both been in the house with Steve in Tony’s other dreams, they should know him), and Tony just watched, trapped in his own body, head spinning agonizingly fast. His memories jumped from a sparkling tower, to a sprawling mansion, from a file projected above him in glowing blue, to the submarine, and back.
Steve stepped away and just looked down at him. His face was impossible to read, chest rising and falling steadily while Tony squirmed in an effort to get comfortable.
Despite appearing to weave through the trees at random, Tony found them a narrow road so quickly that Steve could almost believe he’d known it was there. He watched Tony’s swaying hips as they walked, frowning, trying to tease out some thought that he just couldn’t grasp. A bird flew overhead, and Steve’s spine stiffened immediately. He barked to make sure Tony knew it was there, and to make sure the bird knew that Steve knew it was there. The bird banked, but Steve kept barking, muscles quivering. If it would just fly lower, he could wrestle it right out of the air.
“You don’t even have to wait for me for five more seconds,” Tony snapped. “Enjoy your show. See you tomorrow.”
Tony pressed his thumb against the inseam of Steve’s pants and traced it upwards. Steve tumbled backwards, landing flat on his ass with a muffled
“Mr. Stark,” the captain said (why couldn’t Tony remember his name?) “I really think you should see the physician.”
The door opened with the same seeming reluctance, and Steve stepped in. The muscles in Tony’s back tightened at once. Steve was still in uniform, and he looked as tense as Tony felt. As far as Tony was aware, they weren’t currently in any new fight, but that didn’t matter. Tony looked at him, and he could still see everything they’d been Before. He wondered sometimes what Steve saw when they made eye contact. Tony couldn’t remember the war, but considering the way Steve looked like he’d bitten into a lemon most of the time he was around Tony, it didn’t take much guessing. Tony would give absolutely anything to take them back, to be able to joke with his friend, watch movies together, play chess. He missed Steve, and having Steve walking the halls every day just made it worse.
Moving slowly and deliberately, Steve set a hand to Tony’s left thigh. The muscle jumped up eagerly to meet his palm, and he pressed the heel in as he pushed his hand up to Tony’s waist. Tony made another one of those embarrassing sounds, but he kept still under the patient onslaught as Steve loosened his belt and slowly pulled it free. It dropped to the floor,
Tony’s feet dropped back to the floor with a dull thump that recalled the spilled coffee mug. He struggled to swallow and breathe at the same time, and ended up somewhere in between the two. He cleared his throat, becoming more and more aware of Steve’s seemingly uninterested gaze the longer the moment stretched. If he really wanted to, Tony could flip himself over the desk. The height of the desk and the lack of leverage meant he might do damage to his elbows, and would land off balance and mostly on his knees, but he could do it. He prodded at himself in a mute question to see how far Steve would have to go for Tony to make an effort at freeing himself. The answer was disturbingly grim.
). Tony hadn’t been there for that one, had only seen the images in the aftermath, but how could they both be real?
Awareness came back all at once. Tony sat up, and decided that it would probably be best for all involved if no one mentioned the fact that he and Captain America had been spooning on the forest floor. Or that Tony had cheerfully set off to stock an entire bakery with his fidgety paws. He jumped back down into the road as Steve came ambling back, great big jaws spread wide in a fearsome yawn.
“You’re the Sorcerer Supreme, aren’t you? Walker said we’d find you on the coast,” Steve said after a long silence.
Steve covered his mouth with a hand that shook faintly. “I can’t believe I – I shouldn’t be here. Please accept my apologies, this was unforgivable of me – ”
Tony demanded, rounding on him. He had his ears pressed down to his skull and his tail lashing around his feet.
, and everything about it was gut twistingly, skin searingly wrong. It made his teeth hurt and his joints ache, but he couldn’t look away.
He felt a curious mix of agitation and sorrow as he tried to make Tony understand that he was just protecting them. He was often frustrated by trying to convince Tony that he was doing what was best for them as a team, but maybe being out alone on an alien world was making him even more protective of his teammate. It was important that Tony understood.
Riverstones shouted, jumping forward as great green vines of light exploded around him. He cut a wide swathe in the advancing rats, flinging their wiry bodies away indiscriminately, carving a path through the hall.
Thor’s brows furrowed deeply over the bridge of his nose, and he crouched down to peer into it. “My brother might be able to guess the origin of this, but it is far beyond me. I only took portaling as an elective for a season, and I was never good at it,” he said, standing back up. Getting lost in his own thoughts, he crossed his arms over his chest and frowned into the darkness. “It is deeply troubling.”
” Tony clenched his teeth, his face going red with strain. Underneath him, the chair creaked and scraped along the concrete floor. The gun jumped and re-centered on Steve’s chest.
The door opened, and a woman stepped into the room. Just like the rest of the surroundings, she was subtly
As if he’d heard him, Steve looked up from his magazine, looked at Tony on the bed, and squeezed his hand. Tony felt the ghost of the pressure on his fingers and shivered. “
, with delicate bone structure and intelligent eyes. “Jane?” he asked, confused. She was Thor’s girlfriend. Except Thor wasn’t real, he was a construct of Tony’s seriously fucked up and obviously over-indulged imagination.
“No,” Tony croaked. He stepped-slid-slipped down the stairs and leaned against the wall. The corridor ended and hallways ran out left and right. The left-hand side was illuminated. MEDBAY, the sign read, blue on white, and underlined in red. The right-hand side was dark, the sign rusted over. LAB 2. It might as well have said
Tony let his breath out slowly so he wouldn’t snap at Bruce. It wasn’t Bruce’s fault that looking into that impenetrable darkness had driven Tony’s heart rate up until he could hear it thumping against his ear drums. He cleared his throat and reported all the findings he didn’t have. His own voice came out so softly from lack of air that he had to clear his throat to repeat himself. Bruce kindly did not ask how he was handling it, and Tony tried to pretend that he was handling it just fine.
Tony cursed at himself. Steve would have stayed for another minute at least if he’d just kept his mouth shut. He took a moment to push the disappointment away before straightening up and reaching for his pants. His hips ached from the position and he was getting a little too old to do the ‘bent over convenient flat surface’ thing so frequently, but this was how it worked, and it was good, and he didn’t need to rock the proverbial boat. He could hear Steve’s belt buckle clinking as he put his clothes back together, but he didn’t turn around to look at him.
tonight, Stark,” Clint told him from the vid-com, leaning way too close to the monitor in the common room. “Coming?”
“What are we going to do today?” Tony shouted over the crashing surf. He more than half expected one day the captain would catch on (and/or spontaneously grow a sense of humor) and respond,
Processes finally fell into place, and he managed to inhale and exhale in the correct sequence. The dark spots in front of his eyes faded, and he became aware of the motion of his chest, the dryness in his throat. People were moving around him, alarms were going off, there were hands everywhere, and he finally realized that he was struggling against them.
“Wait!” Wasp said, voice tiny and high-pitched and fast, “Don’t you recognize it? It’s the famous red, white, and blue garb of Captain America!”
(Had Steve carried him out of a building? He thought so, remembered in kaleidoscope fragments being insensate on the floor, the scent of smoke, Captain America’s arms supporting his knees and back. He remembered being carried down a fire escape.
It took a moment for the words to penetrate. Tony let the tension out of his muscles, easing down to the ground. He pressed his ears back and looked over his shoulder to glare at Steve.
After suckling their fill, the pups had curled up in heaps with their bellies distended and muzzles moist with milk. Moonlight had joined them at the table, wolfing down the largest helping of meat while the rest of them finished up. She’d gone back to her puppies immediately after. Tony and the tom didn’t speak. The tom had snuffled at him for a few seconds, Tony sniffed him back, and then they went their separate ways. It had been one of the most civilized and productive conversations Tony had ever had. He could get use to the cat thing.
Getting onto his back feet again, he felt across the wall where a door was most likely to be, if there was one at all. Standing upright, he guessed that he was about as tall as the kitten-napping rat in the woods had been, so if there was any kind of lever it would most likely be –
, and he wanted to burn his office down and walk away forever. He’d turned off the overhead lights hours before, and his desk was a glowing island in the middle of the darkened office. Compared to his office at SI, it was close, and cluttered, and outdated. He stared into the gloom and massaged at his neck with his fingertips. The muscles on either side of his neck were ropes of tension, and the pressure of his fingertips was simultaneously agonizing and nearly orgasmic. He groaned, and pulled gently on the back of his head to stretch his neck.
“Last time I try to help you,” Steve muttered, twisting to sniff at the wet patch on shirt. He bit at an itch on his back leg while he was there, and then dropped into the road and rolled around a bit. The shield scratched against the dirt, but he managed to more or less get the shirt dry.
Tony and Rhodey squared off in an intense stare down. Steve knew he should intervene, but his head was pounding, his legs felt shaky, and he mostly just wanted to go throw up, and then sleep. He felt Sam’s hands on him, trying to pull the bandage away, Bucky’s arm around his hips just barely keeping him upright.
Steve took in a breath, and then nodded. He gestured questioningly to a chair, and probably didn’t notice how much Tony hated that they had to be this careful around each other. The Steve Rogers that he actually remembered would have given his door a cursory knock, and then peered around the edge of it to see if he was busy. Even if Tony was on the phone, he’d have come in as long Tony didn’t wave him off. There wasn’t much that Tony hadn’t been willing to share with him, and there had been more than one occasion when Steve had hid in his workshop for most of the day while Tony conducted business.
“Can we not today?” Tony blurted out. Steve went still under him, and Tony replayed the last three seconds – yup, he’d said that out loud.
If he had two legs, he would have stomped off to break a heavy bag or two until he felt calmer. Since he had neither two legs, nor any handy heavy bags, he put his nose to the ground and explored the forest floor in the immediate area. It was hard to concentrate on all the scents with one ear twitched in Tony’s direction, but the strange new smells were slowly calming him down. He had a good sense of a smell as a human, at least he’d had a good sense of smell ever since the serum, but he’d had no idea that there were so many different scents in the world. Just ghosting his nose over a patch of disturbed dirt gave him an impression of all the animals that had passed over it since the last rain. At least two snakes, several squirrels, a powdery scent that was some kind of bird, and a musty smell of growing mushrooms.
Steve let his breath out in a gasp of relief. His spine felt liquid in the wake of that dry, sharp sound, his guts twisting. “I’m fine, it’s okay,” he stammered.
Tony chastised himself. He flung out one paw to throw a repulsor blast at the retreating rat, which just barely missed, and then activated the jets. A flash of green light shot past him, but Tony didn’t have the time to investigate. The rat tumbled over itself as it took a corner too fast, nails scraping and skidding over the rock. Tony followed, using the opposite wall as a springboard.
“You have done this before?” Tony asked, holding still while Steve made tiny, jerky motions on his finger. He obliged Steve by pressing upwards again, and enjoyed the resulting shudder.
re-engaged and he continued forward like Tony wasn’t sitting up in bed wearing nothing but a pair of tight red boxer briefs (“I feel a little foolish about keeping that secret from you till now,” he remembered saying, standing in nothing but a thong with his armor stripped away, Steve’s shocked expression as he realized that his friend Iron Man was Tony Stark, and Tony terrified that shock was bordering on anger).
Thor, his dream-memory supplied, a god – not a god, an alien with the name of a god. A hammer no one else could lift. They were on an Avenger’s mission in a submarine off the coast of Alaska. The particulars of the mission are fuzzy except for the notion of a man who swam like a fish and refused to wear anything other than underwear.
“Yeah,” Tony answered. He might be already be asleep and dreaming, but just in case… “Yes, we can do. That.”
A hard impact against his side made him gasp in a wet breath. Hard coils wrapped around his neck and waist. He flung one arm out to struggle free as he tumbled with the new weight wrapped around him, and then twisted to bring the shield to bear.
Rhodey reached over and grabbed Tony by both arms. He shook him hard enough to make Tony’s head swim. His vision went white-blue-black-blue-white-gray-white-blue. He moaned, as his stomach turned over and squeezed hard.
Steve surprised them both by coming, untouched, almost immediately, and Tony stuttered to a messy halt while Steve shuddered and clenched around him. Tony held onto Steve’s thighs and tried to think very unsexy thoughts while Steve rode through an orgasm so powerful it almost sounded like he was choking on his own breath.
She gave him a sympathetic look that made Tony cringe, her eyes flickering over to the monitors. “Captain Rogers, I know that this is hard for you to accept, but he is in a coma. He’s not responding to you consciously.”
‘Naked on my office floor?’ was not the response Steve needed, though once upon a time, it would have still been the right one. Steve would have pointed out that they weren't completely naked. Tony would have said something cheeky about rectifying his mistake as penance. Tony nodded instead. “We also can’t solve our problems by ruining all of my uniforms. Pretty sure we’re breaking a few dozen regulations here.”
as far away from that Hydra base as quickly as he could, but more and more of the babies were laying down in heaps and letting the tunnel push them along.
Bruce made an exasperated noise, but he didn’t sound surprised, or even all that annoyed. In fact, he sounded almost fond. Tony couldn’t figure out why Rage Monster was one of the nicknames he had for this unassuming, harmless-looking man, except that he had an abrupt thought that Bruce had once
Tony was back on his feet in an instant. Steve followed, but before he could vent the pressure building up in the back of his skull, Tony pointed at the original circle of darkness. It had spilled over the curb and into the street where Steve had been standing.
“Tony!” he barked again, a knot of worry tightening in his insides. What if he’d scared Tony off? What if Tony had wandered off and gotten eaten by something while Steve had been obliviously chasing small woodland creatures?
Tony opened his eyes and found his vision closed in by the eyeslits of Iron Man’s armor once more, an even older version of the armor than he’d been walking around in with Steve at his side in the mansion. It was heavier and there wasn’t even a cursory display on the inside. He looked down and found that he was standing at a helm, his hands on a wheel, dozens of controls and levers and buttons at his elbows. He looked toward the voice and found a giant of a man in a red cape and a bewinged helmet standing at a porthole. They were obviously deep under water.
“Stop pushing me, Stark.” Steve warned, catching his wrists and squeezing them just hard enough to hurt.
There was another whine from the clearing that sounded almost more frustrated than pained. Tony’s ears flattened to his head, and he did his best to make himself very small in the grass.
He fell asleep against Rhodey’s shoulder on the couch in the Avenger’s common room. It wasn’t his fault. He’d been awake for two days, and there had been slimy green lizard mutant things, and Rhodey was familiar, and warm, and smelled like Calvin Klein’s
Steve said. He looked back at Tony, who was abruptly uninterested in the preceding. He turned and aggressively groomed his fur back into place.
“What do you want me to do?” Tony shoved his chair back so hard that it banged against the wall with a loud
Steve laughed at him. “You’re putting a lot of effort into making yourself believe that,” he observed. His voice was gentle, softly chiding.
Tony woke in a bed that was at least twice as wide as he was – which was an obvious lie since his bunk onboard the ship was barely wide enough for him to lay on his back, and he’d rolled out of it more than once. He stretched his hands out looking for the wall, but he found only mattress and smooth sheets as far as he could reach on either side.
Realizing that they’d never introduced themselves amongst all the snarling and hissing and laughing, Steve said, “My name is Steve.”
“This’ll be cold,” he warned. He could have taken the time to warm it between his hands, but he didn’t. Steve gasped at the first touch of the lube – not all that cold, it had been in his pocket after all – and then held his breath as Tony pushed his middle finger slowly past the ring of muscle. Steve’s body clamped around him like a vise, so tight that Tony felt the circulation cut off to the finger. He twisted his wrist, curled his finger just right, and Steve let out an explosive breath, somehow clamping even harder around him. Steve’s hips thrust up automatically, and he threw one arm over his face.
The names punched a deep hole in him. He felt his shoulders slumping. Even if these people were tricking him, even if they meant him some kind of harm, what did it matter? Not even the shallow bond he’d had with Howard was still there. He had no one to fight for anymore.
“We’re going to get you out of here,” Tony reassured them. A brave kitten in the nearest cage pressed forward and squeaked out a pitiful meow. She had obviously meowed herself hoarse, and the noise was just barely above a whisper. Tony grabbed the latch to the cage in his teeth while the kitten’s cries degenerated into a noise closer to clicking. He tugged.
“Fine,” he said. “Fine. I’ll go see the goddamn physician.” He pushed away from the support of Steve’s arms and walked down the corridor with one hand against the wall. The ship continued to rock, knocking him gently side-to-side, Steve trailing silently at his back.
Tony had been surprised by the immediate disgust he’d felt at the scent of charring meat. He’d thought longingly of a hamburger, but in his mind, the hamburger was raw. Riverstones had joined them after a moment and took over the cooking so his mate could stretch out on a wide couch. The puppies had swarmed all over her like something out of a horror film, but she had been quiescent and relaxed as they nursed.
Unable to help himself, Tony laughed. “Yeah,” he croaked. He was surprised the sounds came out at all.
“Thank you,” Steve said against his skin. He braced his hands on Tony’s hips to move him, but Tony tightened his hold.
Tony felt his spine turning to liquid as the warmth of Steve’s body penetrated his borrowed clothing. His muscles jumped and twitched in confusion. When was the last time he’d been hugged? He tentatively brought his own arms up to wrap around Steve’s waist. He squeezed gently at first, and then found himself clinging to Steve like a drowning man. Steve shifted his grip until he could bury his hand in Tony’s hair, and turned his face until his nose was nuzzled up under Tony’s ear.
Steve nodded. “On edge,” he admitted with a gesture to the inky blackness eating the street. “You ever seen anything like this?”
It didn’t matter. Tony yanked his arms out from between their bodies, and used them to drag Steve closer. His shoulders hit the wall with a painful thump, but Tony barely felt it over the sharp sting of Steve sucking on his split lip. It was brutal, and felt like fighting more than anything, but Tony wanted it so badly he could scream.
Hopping back up to his boulder, he found a sunny spot and decided to take a break while Steve got himself loose.
Steve’s forehead landed on Tony’s shoulder, and his hands hovered around Tony’s hips like he wasn’t sure if he was allowed to touch, or maybe he’d forgotten that he had hands to begin with. Tony grabbed him by the belt buckle and towed him forward. Steve followed without protest, and, when Tony spun him around and pushed, landed on the bed with a soft huff that was almost obscured by the squeak of the springs. It had been a long time since Tony had fucked someone on a bed that squeaked, and it made him wonder how well they’d soundproofed the room, and who might be on the other side of the walls. Steve scrambled backwards up to the head of the bed, watching Tony with wide eyes.
“Steven, darling,” Tony interrupted. He tilted his head back so he could see Steve on the bed, brows furrowed and looking adorably concerned for Tony’s health. “You’ll realize very quickly that I don’t do a damn thing I don’t want to.” He fished a tube of lube and a string of four condoms out of Steve’s discarded belt pouches, and looked up to give him a playful smile. He let the condoms unroll and waved them about. “You were sure optimistic this evening.”
“It’s not my fur,” he told himself, “and I don’t get puffed up. I’m a person, not a cat. I don’t have fur. This is not a problem with my design. It’s just… like a Halloween costume. I’m going to take it off at the end of the night, and never remember to pick it from the dry cleaners ever again.”
Opening his eyes, Tony looked blankly at the stack of paperwork he still needed to review and sign, and compared it to the stack that he’d already completed. At least the ‘completed’ stack was the taller of the two. He had meant to have all of it taken care of by noon, but between emergency calls with heads of state, unplanned meetings with his staff, and mediating a fight about personnel between two of his commanders, he hadn’t even touched the paperwork until he’d been able to send the rest of the day staff home.
There was a brief pause, as though the suit were considering the request, and then he was all at once assailed with scents. Overwhelming, a thousand different messages filtering in through the vents from the unique scents of his travelling companions, to dozens of piles of animal shit in various stages of decay, vegetable matter living and dead, and a dark, dank, musty scent that was what he imagined being trapped in a coffin would smell like.
Tony’s legs opened and fell away almost before he’d decided to obey. He heard a soft whine of noise, and realized it had come from his own throat. Heat flushed up his face that had more to do with embarrassment than the lack of oxygen. Steve gave the belt a sharp tug, and then slowly pushed himself upright again. Tony tested the knot himself, and found that even when he pulled with all of his strength, he couldn’t get it to budge at all. The length of the belt kept his arms back at an uncomfortable angle, and forced his back to bow while the edge of the desk dug mercilessly into his forearms. He could already feel the steady heat of pain building in his lower back from the position.
Tony shook his head to clear out the last of the dream, and blinked at her. She wasn’t that tiny – actually she was probably 5’8” and her hair was a dishwater blond pulled back in a tail. She had hazel eyes and Jolie-lips, and a decidedly Scandinavian cast to her features. He looked around suspiciously, but he was back on the boat, standing in the echo lab. The ocean crashed against the portholes and slid away, very close to the waterline, but not under the surface.
“Mr. Stark,” the captain said from somewhere behind him. His voice was growing both weary and pleading. “Go to the medbay.”
Steve shuddered and closed his eyes.  His head dropped back against the headrest, and he pressed his hips forward, turning his face away from Tony. That was fine. He looked more like the right Steve in profile anyway. Tony pulled back enough to work him out of the rest of the suit. Steve held onto the headboard and rolled his hips by way of helping. Tony watched the way he moved, and tried to imagine Steve sliding out of the suit like that every night, brushing his hands down his body as he pushed the fabric out of the way. Maybe Tony would ask for a show sometime. He considered leaving Steve’s boots, and letting the tight fabric act as shackles, but it might get as much in his way as Steve’s. He threw the whole mess of the uniform over the side of the bed and bit his way back up Steve’s body.
up to the door. He flashed a smile at the agents who’d been chasing after him, and held the door open for Steve and Anthony while the agents glowered.
Steve let the thought die. It wasn’t like he’d thought Tony would really agree. They sat down in the center of the village, and said their goodbyes. Dozens of tiny kittens clamored all over Tony, and one girl in particular shoved herself under his belly and crouched there like it was her rightful place. When Tony tried to move away, she followed without seeming to realize that he was trying get her back to her mom. He finally had to lift up on his back legs so her mom could grab her, and she cried as she was pulled away.
That wasn’t what Tony wanted either, so he swiped the lube off the table and stepped out of his pants. Steve watched him with hungry, confused eyes, but he went willingly when Tony pushed him backwards to the couch. Steve landed hard, already naked from the waist down, and watched warily as Tony stripped off his shirt and left it in a pile on the floor. His eyes drifted over the puddle of cloth and back up to Tony’s face.
“You’re a bad liar,” Tony snapped. “We are not moving that…” His teeth bared in an ugly snarl. He drew in a breath and calmed himself. “Kilgrave could have lackeys watching this place, already in place in case he’s captured. We need all the air support we can get.”
Tony flung his arms into the air. His frustration was a physical weight under his skin, a low buzzing against the back of his neck. He felt stifled in his stupid goddamn catsuit, and tore at his collar to loosen the stranglehold. “Okay, Steve. As soon as I figure out how to fold time and space, I’ll get right on that.”
Tony automatically dropped back into the grass, heart hammering, and then made himself look up again. The dog was laying on its side, and obviously still breathing. It had a great mane of pale, fluffy fur around its neck, but the rest of its body was a darker color, and the fur was shorter. It also had a strange pattern of vertical stripes down one side.
Steve’s eyes widened briefly, and then went flinty, but he nodded. He grabbed Tony’s wrist and made quick work of looping the belt around it and pulling it tight. Tony yanked back on it just to see if Steve would let him, and Steve respond by dragging the belt sharply upward.
His head was empty. There was no note of Bucky’s steady thrum, or Peggy’s heavy drumbeat, none of the Commandos’ cacophony of tones. His bonds were all achingly, terrifyingly quiet.
Once the tom had gone, Steve and Riverstones laid down by the fireplace to take a nap, and Tony had found a sunny windowsill. After all the chaos of the morning meal, Tony was immensely grateful for the quiet. He studied the dogs while they all dozed. Steve was as big as Walker had been, and dwarfed every other dog in the village substantially, and was a moving mountain compared to all the other animals, except maybe the kangaroo.
Baring his teeth, Steve snapped out a warning bark, and followed on its heels with a vicious growl. The wolf just stared at him, head tilted slightly to one side, tail partway up in a tentatively friendly greeting.
Tony screamed into the wind. He pushed away from the captain, hard enough to send the bigger man stumbling back in the snow. Before the captain could recover, Tony hurried off as fast the snowshoes would allow. There was a hill on the horizon, somehow familiar, not quite natural. It was Steve, it had to be. Tony needed it to be Steve, needed the madness to stop.
Nodding jerkily, he followed Fury’s gesture to the vehicle and let a man in black body armor open the door for him.
At the bedside, Steve sucked in a sharp breath. He stood up to lean over the bed. “Tony, do that again. Move your foot. Squeeze my hand. Nurse!” he shouted, and then quickly lowered his voice. “Tony, just… anything, please.”
Steve had suggested that he wait in one of the anonymous examination rooms, but Tony wasn’t about to be abandoned to the tender mercies of S.H.I.E.L.D agents while Steve was most definitely debriefing his alternate self about Tony’s presence. He slipped the security placed on his room and made his way through the labyrinth of hallways until he turned a corner to see Steve escorting…well,
Before Steve could respond, a sleek golden dog with a wedge-shaped head, and alert, pointed ears ducked out of the house. The puppy spilled out after her, bouncing eagerly around her feet. In the next moment, four more puppies tumbled through the door. The last in the bunch was barely awake, and weaved on her feet as she followed her littermates.
Tony turned to see the dog glowing green once again. He leaned down to pick the kitten up and trotted out of the way. The dog let out a series of three booming barks that echoed off the tall ceiling and made Tony’s ears hurt. Green glow raced forward to pry the latches out of their housings, and then slid into the cages.
coalesced into a tangible weight in his pelvis and sent shocky pulses down his legs and up his ribs.
Riverstones said just as Steve made it the top of the hill, scrambling over the edge in a flurry of flailing limbs. Though Steve wanted to collapse on the ground and take a few seconds to breathe, he turned around to watch Riverstones make it up the last few lengths. The smaller dog got his front legs over the lip of the hill and sagged there. Steve grabbed him by the scruff and, despite Riverstone’s warning growls, helped haul him up the last stretch.
A small noise tore out of Tony’s chest, wounded and helpless. His free hand moved jerkily over the table, twitching and scrabbling at the rough wood, inching closer to his bent elbow. The gun swayed drunkenly, briefly blinding Steve with the laser. He winced and looked away, small pops of light exploding behind his eyelids. Across the table, Tony screamed, a horrible sound that was more than half rage, mixed liberally with denial and naked fear.
Turning back to the cage, Tony grabbed the lever again and yanked it hard, desperate to get the kittens out of the cages before the rats woke up from the spell. The lever clanged out of the housing, and Tony threw the door open.
Tony said, almost surprising himself with the acid in his voice. He looked over to see both of the canines with almost identical expressions of bemusement on their faces, though Steve’s was accompanied by an eye roll that was both more exasperated, and somehow fond.
Tony plucked at the frayed remains of his suit. “Maybe you can let me get dressed, and we can take this back to my place? I’m sure we can find at least one crappy street food vendor on the way.” He tried to keep his tone right, but he was painfully aware of how cautious and vulnerable he sounded. His voice was still rough from begging his way to an orgasm, and he could already feel the bruises settling in at his wrists.
He yowled, hissed, and kicked frantically to get out from under Steve’s belly, which only seemed to help Steve in his quest to sniff every individual fur on Tony’s body. When he felt Steve’s blunt nose press against his ass, Tony turned and swiped him hard on the muzzle.
Tony hopped down and sauntered in between them to interrupt what looked like a brewing, baffling fight. He intentionally smacked Steve in the face with his tail, and then sat down between his feet.
She cuddled tighter to side, her tail tucked around her feet, face hidden in his fur. Letting out a soft sigh, Tony curled over to grab her by the scruff. Her back feet came up immediately, and her tail tucked against her belly, making her a compact package. The forest looked different in the dark, and Tony had a moment’s worry that he wouldn’t be able to find his way back to the village, but his feet seemed to know the way. The kitten remained quiet as they moved, not even making a peep when he set her down for a break before picking her up again.
The water rocked him to sleep, and he dreamed of Captain America in Tony’s mansion home. Tony saw the mansion through the eyeslits of a helmet, with Steve ahead of him on the stairs. They moved together through the house, and Tony had the strangest feeling that they were having a conversation he couldn’t quite hear. It seemed like his ears weren’t working exactly right.
When they eventually separated for air, Steve was panting. His pupils had blown open so wide that there was only the thinnest rim of blue around the edges, and his erection pressed hard against the fabric of his suit. Tony boldly put a hand over it and pushed. Steve’s mouth dropped open and he curled his body like he was trying to trap Tony’s hand against him, but then pushed helplessly forward. Tony bit at his ear, and then turned his hand over to use his knuckles to massage Steve’s cock through the fabric. Judging by how little was between them, Tony guessed that he was commando under the uniform, and wasn’t that fun?
Tony drew in his breath slowly and let it out slowly so it wouldn’t sound like a sigh. “Yeah,” he answered, because
Or the universe where his weapons were responsible for thousands, hundreds of thousands of deaths, and he let it happen? Where his every effort to rectify his mistakes just compounded the problems, and his own ego knocked him off his feet again and again, where he and Steve were at each throats as often as they had each other’s backs?
Steve glanced between their still-naked bodies. He barked out a brief laugh and stretched, bumping his calf into Tony’s. “Maybe we should suggest this as negotiating tactics for the UN.”
out of touching Steve while they talked, and grinned when Anthony’s eyes narrowed in on the not-exactly-casual contact. Tony watched his pupils dilate, the bob of his Adam’s apple as he swallowed hard. Steve flushed and Anthony looked away, and it was sickening how gone they were for each other, and almost sweet how oblivious they both were. Judging from the look in Anthony’s face, Tony didn’t think he was even aware of it, and who was Tony to judge? He’d been intentionally blind to more than his fair share of things in the past.
“Let me,” he said, but that was too honest and too much like begging, so he added, “Catch my breath.”
Steve. He’d found him. After weeks (months? Years?) of searching, he’d found him. But it wasn’t… he couldn’t know who it was, didn’t know who it was, this was an accident. They hadn’t been searching for anyone except Mr. Speedo. He watched Hank seal himself into the airlock and heard the outer hatch open to pour freezing water in with him. Half of Hank’s body appeared in view of the porthole, far too large, maybe distorted by the water? Except Tony also knew that he could grow to nearly ten-feet in height, or shrink to the size of an insect (Physics didn’t work that way). He reached out of the porthole to grab the floating figure –
Gritting his teeth, Tony replied, “Bite me!” but his finger moved, slipped into the guard, and tugged.
“There is some manner of portal here,” Thor announced. “It is certainly the source of the wind.” He sighed heavily. “And smacks of my brother’s magic.”
feel better,” Steve said, but he twisted to look behind him, and then shifted his weight in anticipation of a jump.
“No.” Tony looked at the Steve who sat at his bedside. He was wearing those damn khaki pants, a midnight blue button up shirt, and white tennis shoes with bright white tube socks. His familiar brown leather bomber jacket was draped over the back of the chair. Tony gestured to him helplessly. “You’re such a dork.”
“Where Captain America would be concerned for Tony Stark? Or where Steve Rogers might return Tony Stark’s severely constipated version of affection?” Steve suggested.
“Tony?” he gasped out. He could feel his lips moving but he couldn’t hear his own voice. It was disconcerting and he tried again, screaming Tony’s name. Bucky put a hand over his mouth to stop him and Sam pointed across the room. Rhodey had Tony in a bear hug, but Tony didn’t seem to notice. He thrashed like a wildcat, face wet with tears, mouth open in a scream that Steve could feel in his chest but couldn’t hear. He was lunging at Kilgrave, feet shoved against War Machine’s thighs so his back bowed at an alarming angle, tossing his weight side-to-side in an effort to get free. Steve had seen Tony angry before. Angry Tony went quiet, cold. Angry Tony contained his rage and channeled it into controlled destruction. Angry Tony fixed things. He’d never seen Tony handle anger like this, as if he was two seconds away from his own Hulk transformation.
He expected some kind of magic blast to fly out at him, but the rat just watched him, knobby hands held up like he was welcoming Tony in for a hug. He was kind a silly creature, a giant rat that stood on his back legs like a human, draped in odd bits of jewelry. The red was a nice color, Tony liked it.
Steve hesitated. “What year is it?” he asked without wanting to know the answer. He knew that whatever year it was, it was a year that didn’t have Peggy or Bucky or his Commandos in it – did it really matter, stacked up against that? “How long?”
The kittens were sorted out, and most were returned to their parents. The ones that were left must have come from villages even further afield, and they were fostered out to grateful moms until their homes could be found.
been removed. Slugging back the last of his whiskey, he set the cup on the tiny table, and sauntered across the room. Steve’s eyes widened as he realized that Tony knew what he’d been unable to ask.
The tossing of the ship was suddenly a comfort he wasn’t ready to give up. He didn’t want to step through the door, didn’t want to put his feet on solid ground.
“Come on, Tones,” Rhodey said from behind the thick balaclava. His voice was muffled and his breath fogged the air in front of him.
Maybe the weird make-up of the village’s inhabitants wasn’t so strange. Big cities had all kinds of diversity, neighborhoods of people from all over the world living within a stone’s throw of each other. Still, how did the mice comfortably live in a village when their upstairs neighbors were cats and birds? He cleaned his paw idly, unsheathing his claws to get to the fish scale stuck in his glove.
Tony stayed up on top of the hill to watch the two wolves. They shared some sort of silent exchange in flicking ears and tilting heads. After a moment, they started making noise at each other, and then Walker leaned forward and sniffed at Steve’s muzzle. Steve went still for a moment before tilting his head to sniff at her as well. They both pulled back at the same time.
She didn’t seem to find it at all strange or distressing, so Steve let it go. At night, he slept on the heart with a rotating pile of puppies for company. Tony usually took the opportunity to wake him up at least twice in retaliation for his disturbed naps, but he normally settled down on top of Steve’s curled form by the middle of the night.
Tony’s hands clenched into fists. “I don’t have you. You’re a corpse somewhere in the Arctic Ocean, or the Bering Sea, or stuffed and mounted on some Nazis’ wall!”
He traveled some distance out of the village to find a makeshift bathroom for himself. He didn’t want to end up shitting in someone’s vegetable patch. Relieved, and mess firmly covered up with dirt and dry leaves, Tony took a meandering path back toward the village. The suit being folded up as a backpack threw his balance off, but he was reluctantly to fold it back down over his fur.
Tony asked obstinately. Steve grunted, got down on his belly, and scooted his way closer to Tony’s side.
Moonlight’s head went back, obviously startled by the suggestion, but a flash of motion grabbed her attention before she could reply. She stood up, dislodging the hopeful puppies into a pile of squirming limbs, and walked regally past Steve into the road. Steve turned to follow her progress, and found a group of mixed dogs, cats, and what looked like mice trooping into the village. A pair of birds swooped overhead, cawed, and then disappeared into the trees.
Taking a nap seemed like a better use of his time than just staring at dog butts while they frolicked in the dirt, but Tony forced himself to stay alert. He fiddled with the input/output controls until he could keep an ear on the air above, his nose out for any conniving rats, and his eyes on the dogs’ progress.
Tony got up to follow her without acknowledging Steve’s antics, which earned him a disappointed huff. Still ignoring him, Tony veered off to the left and hopped up on a fallen tree. Steve trotted along underneath him, and the wolf seemed to be ignoring them both as she ambled through the undergrowth.
To his surprise, Steve took it. He twisted the cup between his fingers, and then ducked his head to take a whiff. “I can’t get drunk,” he said finally, but then knocked it back. He winced at the sharpness of it, a shudder running through his entire frame. It wasn’t exactly top-dollar stuff. “Man, that’s awful.”
“And the crappy street food,” Steve agreed. He smiled, and for a moment, every terrible thing between them faded. Tony felt the first stirrings of hope, and thought that maybe there was a better way forward for them.
When Tony looked back up, the captain had his binoculars up again, legs spread and rocking with the motion of the boat so perfectly that he could have been fused to it. Tony shook his head, asked himself again what had possessed him to think that an arctic sea voyage was a good idea, and shouldered the door open. A heave of the boat on the waves nearly tumbled him down the short set of stairs, but he managed to catch onto the door and ended up being flung into the wall instead. He shoved the door against the wind, sealed it shut and sagged back to rest his weight on the bulkhead with his eyes closed. He was sweating again, and still freezing cold even in the comparatively toasty interior of the vessel.
“What about Loki?” Steve asked immediately, expecting that whatever magic let him hear Strange would work in reverse.
Steve twisted, saw him coming, and snarled. Tony slammed all four paws down and hopped awkwardly sideways as the snarl turned into a growl, and that turned into a deafening bark. Steve struggled again to stand, but ended up in a heap in the grass. He growled non-stop, showing his teeth in a display that made Tony’s fur stand on end and his guts get a bit wobbly.
Tony wished he could still lift one eyebrow. He tried, but all he managed was swiveling his left ear to the side. Steve obviously didn’t interpret the gesture correctly, and looked off to the left, alert for any signs of movement.
He scraped snow off of the icy console, the beam of his flashlight flickering over the solid ice. It lit up a shadow in the depths, a smudge of irregular darkness against the deeper darkness of the console. An unmistakably human-shaped shadow.
He stood to go, and Tony couldn’t suppress a snarl of frustration as he shoved himself to his feet. Steve whirled at the noise as if he expected Tony to attack him, and they ended up staring at each other like starving predators defending territory.
Before Steve could yank away from him, Tony tightened his grip. “No, darling. We certainly were not. Your counterpart would
Pressing the edge of the shield into the ground, Steve steadied himself. “Is it the covering the whole city?”
Tony’s head cocked slightly to the side, and he gave Steve a piercing look that made his hackles come up. His eyes were luminous in the sunshine, wide and unblinking, the dark slits of his pupils looking almost sinister. After a long moment, Tony blinked, and the spell was broken. He stretched again before moving toward the tree line.
Switching back to infrared, Tony crouched against the wall. He waited several tense seconds for any signs of motion, or flashes of heat in the darkness. When nothing presented itself, he turned around to examine the stone behind him. He started to hear Steve’s impatient whines within a few minutes, and then Riverstone’s grumbles as well, but he ignored them while he looked for anything that might open the door.
On his other side, Steve was sucking in rapid breaths through his nose like he couldn’t quite figure out how to engage his voice. Rhodey looked in between them and stepped away from the bedside, ostensibly to get out of the nurses’ way. In his absence, Steve leaned in close and set his forehead very gently against the side of Tony head.
Tony wanted to point out that it left them with him tied to a desk by means of Steve’s combat belt, but he couldn’t make his throat produce the words. Tears still streaked from the corners of his eyes, pouring hot over his temples, and running cold into his hair. “I don’t know.”
Holding onto Steve’s thighs for leverage and leaning back into the cradle of the calves locked tightly around him, Tony gave an experimental upwards thrust that made Steve shout. The bedsprings creaked loudly. Tony grinned, hoped someone important was in the next room (maybe even his counterpart, though that was unlikely), and set up a fast rhythm that he knew would get him off quickly.
Setting down his fork, the captain stared at him hard. “I said we’re taking an expedition out tomorrow. Do you want to go?”
He shucked off his sweaty long underwear and stepped under the spray as soon as it was warm enough not to give him frostbite. The first touch of the warm water made him convulse with shudders, and he danced in a quick circle around the chilly tile. Fog rose up against the glass door to obscure the rest of the head, and for a second Tony could believe that he was back in his dream, showering after a battle. For some reason, even looking at Steve –
Riverstones started barking. He danced around Steve and the prone human trying to stave off Death’s snapping jaws. Tony fought to his feet, realizing that the dog – wizard dog? Canizard? Wizog? – was trying to get Steve to stop. Behind the great throne chair, the kittens were crying in piteous horror.
“Why would you prefer to stay on the ship, Tony?” Steve asked when Tony didn’t respond. “Why? Because you’re miserable, and cold all the time, and alone?”
Tony frowned, remembered Steve’s body drifting past the porthole, and asked, “Why are we taking a submersible if it’s on the ice?”
The Head Rat-oncho stood, bringing him up to a truly enormous height that Tony guessed was pretty close to six feet. He glowed a malevolent red, and then pointed a gnarled finger at them. As if they were one body, the thousands of rats turned to look at them. Their eyes took on the same sickly glow.
While he had the downtime and the dogs were dozing, Tony started examining the armor for the catches. Just like with the helmet, he was worried that he wouldn’t be able to get the suit back on if he took it off, but he still wanted to know how to get out of it. In his own universe, he’d designed the suit to be a livable environment for days in case of an emergency, but he had no idea how this modified version of the suit worked, and he was going to need to relieve himself sooner rather than later.
Tony was startled by the voice, but only long after the chance for an appropriate reaction had passed. He twisted to look up the captain. Man looked bigger than ever, or Tony felt smaller than ever. His eyes were very blue against the deeply lined leather of his skin, and he had surprisingly long lashes.
He wished she would get up. Having her on her back with her belly showing was making him uncomfortable. He shifted his weight between his forepaws while she twisted to look up him, her tail swishing playfully through the undergrowth. Finally deciding to take pity on him, the shewolf rolled onto her belly, and then took her time sitting up.
, he didn’t need to keep his identity a secret. He could take off the armor (it was so heavy) and sit down, or stand at the bar, or watch Bruce slowly realize that Natasha was trying to flirt with him (No, she and Clint were together, she’d turned double agent for SHIELD against the Soviets – No, the Soviet Union didn’t exist, she was his PA – no, she was Fury’s right hand – no, Fury was dead – no, he’d faked his death. Bruce had Betty – no, Veronica.
“Dogs,” he groused as he got the last of his tail back in order, and then took off after them. They were not in sight, but he could hear them yammering at each other through the trees. Ears alert for any other sounds, Tony hopped along the sprawling root system of a massive purplish tree, and then leapt nimbly over a shallow, dry creek bed.
Steve grunted. He couldn’t, but he had a feeling it had something to do with his colors being ‘odd.’ They lay together in companionable silence for a while as the babies were all sorted out, and villagers started back down the road, eager to get the children to safe homes and full bellies. Walker, apparently reassured that all was well, gave Steve a regal bow of her head, and trotted off into the woods.
