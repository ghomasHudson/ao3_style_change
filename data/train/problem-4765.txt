, two identical plies of cowhide machine-stitched together, worn smooth in places from daily use, and heavy as a damned -horse- collar in Tony’s hand…
“I just finished,” Tony lied automatically, then corrected, “-with… what I’m doing on it tonight, I mean.”
“…What do you want?”  Hank Pym replied through the intercom on the wall, after an unusually long pause.
It was fun, and if he was hard enough to feel his own pulse inside his costume, that was okay too.  It was something… he could have.  …Something he could guide Tony’s fingers to, and probably watch the other man’s eyes darken in covetous glee.
He couldn’t put his finger on what -exactly-, but he reached down on instinct, pressed in a hidden catch beneath the breastplate’s left side seam, and pulled it forward.
Huge steel hands closed around Tony’s helmet, tightening with a deafening screech of grinding metal that drowned out the sound of both Tony’s radios…  then silenced them with a crunch and held him, pinned.
"You know Steve, I feel like doing some real violence out there today…"  Tony vented, fishing a pair of boxer shorts out of his top dresser drawer.
Steve had big hands, smoother-skinned than Tony’s, with a slightly unusual pattern of leathery callous along the fingertips of his right hand from shield-throwing.  Controlling the minute changes in speed, torque, or release angle, that made it fly instead of just fire…
“Yeah, Harry’s going to need a cover story that doesn’t involve being a major drug addict, and I mean tomorrow
He patted ineffectually at the snooze button, and accidentally hit the corner of the clock with the base of his palm.
Out of the corner of his eye, Tony spotted Norman Osborne.  He hadn’t seen the new technical director of SHIELD in years, not since a party out in the Hamptons about three months before he’d lost control of Stark Industries.  Why was- -Norman stopped to have a few words with Peter’s friend Harry, and everything clicked.  Harry
He’d been on television from time to time as Iron Man- -he was now, in fact- -but he hadn’t seen the name ‘Tony Stark’ shown on in bold white news capitals for over half a decade and he found the experience deeply unsettling.
War Machine kneed him.  The impact came hard, striking the back plates of Tony’s armor with a tooth-jarring clang, and driving him forwards.
The door yanked open abruptly, and Peter bounded into the room, complete with long-suffering blue backpack and mask-wrecked hair.
Tony clapped his free hand over Peter’s mouth through the Spider-Man mask, and gave him a weak, lopsided smile.  Then he concentrated for a moment, and his breathing eased.  Peter’s shoulders relaxed visibly.  Tony patted the side of Peter’s masked face, then braced a hand on his costumed shoulder, and stood.
“It closes doors, Peter.  The more unusual an occupation is, or the more rules of society you have to break to get into it in the first place, the better the chances are that you had to look at what you -really- wanted instead of just copying everyone else.  And costumed heroes… you follow me?”
And what if the Green Goblin sat down in his own Halloween-themed kitchen with five bucks worth of New York City newspapers, and put all this
“Come on, babe.  …I just want to see for myself that you’re really okay,” Tony explained, “…you’d do the same for me, wouldn’t you?”
That got a smile from Steve, as Tony had intended it to.  -There were very few people who couldn’t at least laugh at B-3.
“I’ve never seen my father offer somebody a job in his R&D department so fast in my life,” Harry said, with an uncomfortable smile.
It was scorched, warped in places and disjointed from what looked like something in the center blowing up and burning, but what the thing -had- been was chillingly clear.  Hover-pads on the exposed underside, manta-wing silhouette exaggerated with wickedly sharp fairings along the leading edge…
They all looked unspeakably young, Tony thought.  He -saw- kids of this age, saw them daily in and around the village, and dotting the sidewalks and public parks when he was out flying… but it was different seeing them all
They got Peter into the bathtub and turned barely lukewarm water onto him, half-frozen costume and all.  Peter bent his head under the spray of the shower and hugged his knees, thawing slowly.  After a while he peeled off his mask, took a deep breath, and rubbed his face in his hands.  Tony turned the water temperature up a few degrees and waited, watching him attentively.  There was a fleck of frostbite on the end of the young man’s nose, and two small dots high on his right cheek, but nothing serious.
“No, Colonel, they all did.  I re-distributed the members of Iron Man’s team where I felt they could do the most good for the rescue effort,” Steve explained.
Jarvis’s fond smile was quiet and contained.  He was slightly balder than when Tony had seen him last, but he’d aged well, and the solid lines of the RAF boxing champion Jarvis had once been were not altogether lost beneath the rounded corners.
Tony sat happily on the floor in boxers and Steve’s blue bathrobe, eating General Tso’s chicken out of a take-out carton by the light of his arc reactor.  The only other light in the room came from a small bulb under the range hood, ill-equipped to illuminate even the whole kitchen.  The diffuse light of the city beyond the windows was more than enough for Steve’s keen night vision though, and Tony liked watching him move in low light, a big pale shadow, light on his feet, and topped with shifting hints of reflected gold and silver.
The last drop of molten solder set into place around its copper and steel connection, and Tony studied the leftovers on his- -Steve’s desk by the hiss of the dead channel.  He’d been able to re-bend the radio-cup earpieces back into shape with his transistor-powered gauntlets, just a reverse of how he autographed aluminum baseball bats and sections of steel pipe by squeezing, really…
He saw a tall corner apartment building that lit the streets on both sides of it in crawling tangerine-yellow, and painted the upturned faces of the grim firemen.
Higher until the metal of the armor actually began to feel cold wherever it made contact with his bare skin, higher until the scattered thunderheads were left far behind, and the sky became the inside of a deep cobalt-blue bowl.
Tony shifted across Steve’s lap impatiently, and pressed his forehead against the top of the blonde’s shoulder, eyes shut.  He -hated- that he couldn’t do much yet.  If he could just concentrate, just-
Whitney laughed, and it made both of the guys smile.  Women were like that, sometimes.  Just… great ambiance.
He touched down with a crunch of tarred gravel on the roof of a defunct local nightclub, and walked out to the edge of the roof to people-watch for a while.  Some long-haired kids with an acoustic guitar spotted him from the square below, pointed, and waved.
“Well then that’s like wisshin’ for tha moon, ain’t it?”  The man replied shrewdly, closing one eye again.
“You have to know that it’s an unrepeatable experiment,” Steve continued, the corner of his cleft chin -just- scratching the back of Tony’s neck down near his shoulders.  “-And that there’s not another like it in the world.  If something happens to this shield… …it can never be replaced.”
Then why the hell did you make HIM an Avenger?!  Tony thought, frowning out at the dark bar of Central Park without really seeing it.  Steve should have been halfway to the Williamsburg Bridge by now…
“Atomic power,” Iron Man replied shortly, looking around and reading the symbols on the chemical silos around them, “-if we win, everybody here loses.”
“Yeah, so when you go off to jail this time, you might want to think about a career change,” Spider Man advised him.
His foot slipped on the white enamel of the tub a little, but Steve’s hands had him.  Tony’s entire body tensed, ecstasy and adrenaline together, playing out in a sudden flush across his face and neck as he finished.
Steve looked up from pouring a glass of milk, and saw Peter clinging miserably to the nearest window frame.  He was shivering, and his whole costume seemed a shade lighter than it was supposed to be.  There was actually a rime of ice across the lower front of his mask from the condensation of his breathing.
Saluting was a pure gesture, a sign of respect for the position, if not the man being saluted.  It was part of an essential tradition of customs and courtesies that kept men from becoming animals on the front lines, or at least helped them regain their sanity later.  It was a physical reminder that you were still in control of yourself, and that you were part of something bigger.  At worst it was a way of interacting with officers with whom you were barely on speaking terms without getting yourself court-martialed, and Steve had to wonder if that had anything to do with War Machine’s silence now…
White-hot flames.  Pale blue, and incandescent orange.  Glowing like the thin tungsten filament in a light bulb magnified a hundredfold.  Heat that would vaporize flesh almost as fast as it burned.
Iron Man smirked behind his faceplate, and finished duct-taping Unicorn’s hands and feet together.  His helmet radio crackled to life.
“No.  I put those up to over-expose the film of any camera that tries to take a picture of us through the windows,” Tony explained, “-there’s actually a UV component too… what color is the light you’re seeing?”
“Yes,” War Machine told him candidly, “-your nomination of me was too tempting, on both fronts.  The Starks wanted the prestige, and to be rid of me, and SHIELD wanted a man inside the Avengers more than they needed one watching SI full time.”
Peter scooped the textbooks on his desk into his backpack, stuffed his mask in against the spines, and tried to remember whether it was Tuesday or Wednesday.
Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair on both sides.   He kissed the top of Steve’s hair reverently just above his hairline, tasted tap water, and smelled clean shampoo.  …And himself.  Tony licked his lips for a moment, then knelt as well and nuzzled Steve’s right ear.
“No, but Daredevil said to tell you Elektra and She-Hulk are running down a lead in Washington,” Steve replied, pausing near the doorway.
Steve liked that noise, that feeling.  He liked how easy they were to draw out, with the right touches, the right codes.  He liked winning, for both of them… and then discovering that there was
Peter swung back and forth on his webline like an irritated pendulum.  He favored Tony with a dubious look, then put out his hand upside-down to the corner of the desk, and stopped himself.
“Is Iron man fightin’ the Green Goblin out there?”  One of the thugs that Danny had taken down asked, rising cautiously to his elbows for a better view.
War Machine had faded into the background as a retainer of Stark Industries, neither flashy in his style, nor much given to speechmaking.  He became a hero in his own right after thwarting an incident in London, almost to the surprise of his official employers… though they lost no time capitalizing on it.  Unlike Iron Man, War Machine often traveled outside the United States, acting as both bodyguard and implied threat.
“-Hold that thought,” Tony said, his mouth a little dry.  He strode to the record player, and started the song over.  “-
“Hm-?  Well, Power Man mentioned you ran a bike shop here in the village, or I doubt I would have,” Steve replied, guilelessly.
“Harry came back to rescue me when I fought the Green Goblin downtown the other night.  I mean, he didn’t know I was Spider-Man, he was just looking for Peter Parker, and since I was in costume at the time, of course he
employed by Morgan and Sunset Stark, but I’m also there to keep an eye on them, and act as a deterrent to… mistakes.”
“Tony said you worked for him, Peter-” Whitney unwittingly interrupted them, “-what is it that you do?”
“That was Iron Man.  He’s pretty sure he can stabilize the damage to the buildings on Wall Street, but he says he’ll need to break down the Manhattan Bridge for spare parts.”
“…You have to know where it’s been.  You have to understand that it’s saved my life.  You have to know that men have
Steve glanced over at the plugged-in arc reactor for a moment, then quickly at the back of his hand as it rested against Tony’s chest.
May came back with Peter in tow, and Tony faced the boy squarely.  Both of them seemed to draw themselves up a little.
Steve’s left arm and hand tightened, pushing Tony’s hips forwards, and he took him in deeper.  It was a swift gesture, just this side of rough…  exciting, and hard to predict, because Steve hadn’t premeditated it.
Tony connected the thick red and black cables methodically, one on the left lower socket of the arc in his chest, and one on the right.
The door opened, but it had opened for someone who had a key, and that light, almost casual booted tread was unmistakably Steve’s.  Tony kept sketching out the details of his invention- -inventions, now- on the open space left on the back of the flyer.
“There is no right answer, Peter,” Tony admitted with a sigh, “-it’s a percentages game.  I’ve held a good man while he -died- from bullets he got protecting my identity as Iron Man.”
One of Steve’s hands closed over the warm disk of the arc, and his fingers brushed the slightly uneven skin around its base.  Tony squirmed a little and caught his breath, breaking the kiss.
Relief flooded Tony’s system, dropping him.  He slumped forwards, head against his arms on Steve’s chest.  Steve was still trembling slightly, one hand uncurling to stroke Tony’s back and gather him closer as they caught their breath.
It looked as though a thunderstorm had been captured in a shallow, steel-bound glass jar, and implanted in him.  The lightning within was flickering powerfully but sporadically, and the device was clearly malfunctioning in some way…
Steve closed his fingers around the warm metal and plastic plug.  He’d seen it before, and it had always reminded him of a telephone switchboard plug from his own time, or the connector for a pilot’s radio headset, long and silver-bright.
It was basically a glorified vending machine incapable of dispensing any beverage worth paying for anyway, but it was failing at even -that- simple task.   It would humm, make promising clicks, and- -drip ineffectively.
“A conversation I had with Pietro, actually,” Steve admitted, “-you see, his room is right next to mine…”
“I… thought you might say that,” Tony sighed, and dropped his forehead against Steve’s broad shoulder, eyes closed.  “…Really would make me feel better, though…”
Tony threw his helmet across the basement parking garage in which he’d taken refuge, bouncing it once off the concrete floor and narrowly missing a Cadillac.
“Try not to step on anyone as you leave,” Hank advised pleasantly, “-they get very upset if they think you’re threatening their queen.”
The song played on, taking darker and darker turns until ‘Iron Man’ became the villain.  It was too bad, Matt reflected.  Tony liked heavy metal, and he was probably listening.  With his hand on the door, Matt’s enhanced hearing caught something else the band’s microphones were picking up that wasn’t -quite static.
His hands were everywhere, and in no hurry.  He ran them lightly across the quiet definition of Tony’s stomach, stroked them up the backs of his thighs, brushed the hard crease between Tony’s hip and thigh with his thumb…
Tony sat for long minutes, staring out at nothing.  He flexed his hands slowly within his gauntlets, and listened to the notes of the metal, the familiar felt-but-unheard clicks, the low whirr of the barely-actuating servos that he knew inside-out…  Tony’s eyes paused on the refrigerator once or twice, but they didn’t linger there.  He didn’t need a drink
“NO, goddammit, I wouldn’t have BOTCHED the job!  Now get your flag unwound and tell me what that magma dragon did ta to Wall Street!”  Fury barked.
good, and now Steve knew that it was because the man was a SHIELD agent.  Or working for them.  Or… something.
Okay, this could be worse, it was just a dummy system.  No motion-tracking hardware, and nine times out of ten the signal fed only into a videotape in the security room, wherever that was.  Or there could be an insomniac security guard who worked for the Maggia and was on the phone blowing his identity right now.  One never knew.
A shot of Tony that was mostly shadows, dominated by the cold blue-orange flame of the welding torch in his hand.
…Or in the case of the Mark VI, an outer layer of cryogenically-tempered metal, and a far lighter inner coating of
Unlike some jukeboxes, this one would change records every time a new combination was pushed regardless of whether the old song was finished or not…  -which was fortunate, because Tony played the beginnings of
Nobody was looking at him though.  Those who had noticed his presence in the hallway at all had just seen him repair the coffee machine, so he was a worker, and therefore invisible.
He set all the joints of his armor except for the ones controlling his right arm to ‘lock’ mode, and unplugged his armor’s main power connector from the right hand socket of the arc reactor.  The internal power died with a whisper, and Tony was alone.  He could hear his increasingly ragged breathing more clearly now, and his chest was really beginning to hurt…
“Have you seen that guy in black on the hover board again?”  Tony asked, getting up and starting a round of pancakes.
“Hm,” Peter drummed his fingers quickly against the countertop, then stopped.  He looked at the dishes in the sink.  He peered curiously into the skillet on the stove, where there was still a hash brown and two fried eggs.
“-‘Scuse me, I gotta take this-” Tony said, holding up a hand and keying his scrambled-channel left hand helmet-radio for real.
Not the regular phone either, but the black one just under the edge of the bed beside Tony’s emergency backup battery.
The Red Skull used the slack his sudden charge had given him to reach Steve’s shield on the bed, and throw it.  …Something in Peter’s mind
Now that they were all necessarily on the same team, the helicopter’s handling improved remarkably.  They couldn’t outrace the two fighter jets that were bearing down on them, but Hawkeye made things unpleasant for the jets with flare arrows, and Iron Man fired a canister of chaff at them.  Some of the shredded metal got sucked into the lead jet’s starboard engine, which instantly died in a stalled-out burst of thick black smoke, and forced him to abandon the chase.
“Libraries are always special,” Steve reflected, sitting back on an elbow and stroking Tony’s shoulder idly with his fingers. “-They’re like hospitals and post offices-”
Steve was walking up to them, now less than fifteen feet away.  There were a few gray-black smears on the brightly-colored mail and leather of his costume, and one longer, darker ash-mark across the face of his shield, but…
Luke caught the oncoming forklift’s rising horizontal tines with the dexterity of a seasoned bull-leaper, and halted its ramming maneuver by bracing his feet and lifting straight upwards.  The forklift’s wheels lost traction and spun, glaring headlights picking out the mahogany sweep of unbroken muscle through a wide tear in Luke’s yellow shirt, and glinting off his steel headband in the darkness.
The rich scent of turkey and stuffing was beginning to pervade the long room.  Tony poured himself a few fingers of bourbon, drank off a long swallow of the stuff with great complacency, and finished the rest as he put one of the pies together.  He’d never had much luck with side-dishes, but things that had to be mixed and
“He did?  Well, that explains a lot,” Tony said, careful to keep his smirk within bounds.  “-Listen, I don’t know when they’ll be back, and I’ve gotta get back to work here…”  Tony gestured towards the Mustang.
He remembered doing a history report in college before he’d ever dreamed of the armor, and thinking that Cap, Union Jack, and the Invaders seemed to belong to an age different than the history moving around them.  …The time of King Arthur’s round table, perhaps.
It was strange.  Both songs had been about war, yet he was hopeful this one would end differently.  Less fashionably, by having the good guys win.
In college, he had.  In the army, he’d often used his -helmet- for those things.  Avengers Tower was a bit of a puzzle, because though his room was far nicer than many of the hotels the Army had billeted him in while on stateside missions, it didn’t have a sink at -all-.  There were two bathrooms on his floor, a gents and a ladies, both (he was assuming in the case of the ladies) perfectly nice in an upscale private gym sort of way, and cleaned daily by Ms. Van Dyne’s staff.
Turning and cutting power quickly, Tony dropped heel-first onto War Machine’s still-hot unibeam lens and fired his bootjet, using his hand repulsors to keep from actually taking off.
Luke Cage lifting up a broken slab of re-barred concrete, while one firefighter reached into the space underneath for a trapped child, and another in the foreground gave orders to someone out of the frame.
Tony took off his sunglasses in a deliberate gesture, slipped them into his shirt pocket, and saluted crisply.
Tony heard Peter’s voice and felt the chill of the room simultaneously.  He hissed sharply through his teeth, and snatched the blue bathrobe off the floor.
Hank Pym was a scientist.  He didn’t -need- to work out every morning.  From what Steve had gathered, Hank had been casual about PT even as Ant-Man.
Skin had a give, a complexity of texture that no machine could fully match, even where shapes and outward geometry could be duplicated.  It held a fascination for him that he wasn’t about to try explaining out loud.  An organic singularity.
“He was waiting for me, Iron Man.  I ordered him back here after we lost the Green Goblin,” Steve explained.
“You have to know that I’ve condoned its use for a pillow, a lunch-table, an umbrella, an operating table, and a children’s sled…”
“Good.  Great.  I was just finishing something up-” he waved vaguely in the direction of the soldering iron on his desk.
“-Now then… the rest of the Avengers know damn well what you pulled because I had to divert Spider-man from helping -them- when you decided to take off.  What they don’t know is that you were working for SHIELD at the time, because Iron Man told me that part privately.  And that information will go no further unless you want it to.  The life of a SHIELD agent is short enough, from what I’ve seen.”
Tony stated at his helmet for a split-second, immobile.  Then he seized it and put it on, keying the mic.
Snatches of the gritty lyrics in question mixed strangely with the sudden warmth of Steve’s lips on his.
“Sure, why not?”  The old man shrugged, turning as he answered and messing up Steve’s drawing perspective once and for all.
How soon was it, before the string of red hole-punched Frisbees hung across the ceiling at the back of the garage began to melt, and stretch, and catch fire one by one, splashes of molten plastic vanishing in the hotter blaze below?  Had they deflected and begun to melt together first, or had they burned too fast?
Tony subconsciously heard the sound of the window opening, and went from dead asleep in Steve’s US Army sleeping bag to standing pressed up against the cold brick wall between two of the large windows in about a second and a half.
Poor Zachary.  The kid deserved better parents than those two, even if there had been a certain clannish satisfaction in watching Morgan do something right for a change, at Sunset Bain’s expense…
Something was off.  Something… cyclical.  Historical.  Some widening gyre that he couldn’t quite grasp.
Tony lay on his right side and stomach feeling warm and sleepy, right forearm tucked under his chin while his left hand played.
Tony swung aboard last, and sat in the open doorway as the chopper lifted off, one boot braced on the helicopter skid outside.
Tony rapped the knuckles of his gauntlet sharply against the side of his own faceplate, and tried the control again.  This time, the Plexiglas shields covering his eye and mouth-slits slid open with a misaligned squeak.
“What the hell happened in here…?”  Tony asked, staring around at the walls of the empty warehouse.  The red brick was scorched in some areas, and newly replaced in others.  Some of the marks on the concrete floor were burned chalk-white.  Cooked-off ammunition, maybe?
“What’s this for?”  Steve asked quickly, pointing out the black, boxy device on the floor without touching it, “-I don’t remember seeing it here before.”
Tony avoided the security cameras in the stairwells by going out a window.  He pushed it shut behind himself carefully, and magnetically re-locked it.  Then he cut power, dropped eight stories, and caught himself just in front of the garage entrance as if he’d never seen it before, dropping lightly to the ground and walking away until he could-
Steve timed his steps to open the distance between them again, and looked into Tony’s face silently as the last four lines repeated as an ending chorus.
Warmonger blew away half the empty silo Iron Man was using for cover, and it began to tip over.  Cap was thrown left towards where the Scarlet Witch was, but Iron Man and Fury were still on the same side of the platform, and had to dive for it to avoid the falling metal tower.
He stopped all the tapes, and peeled the white handwritten labels off carefully with a thin blade hidden in the index finger of his left gauntlet.  Then he swapped the labels with those on a set of tapes recorded a month ago, and put last month’s tapes into the corresponding machines, cued up to the same time.  There would be a momentary glitch, but nobody really watched these things at normal speed anyway…
Tony was no super-soldier, but he turned wrenches for a living, and the grip of his calloused fingers around the thin, strong chain held firm.
Steve set his shield down against the bedside table, pulled off his red leather gloves, and touched one of the brass curves of the headboard, grounding himself.  He pushed back the cowl of his costume, and left his gloves on the bedside table.  Tony’s eyes had half closed again, but he opened them when he felt the mattress dip, and smiled.
The Red Skull’s fingers closed reflexively around his prize, but Peter yanked the line back with his full spider-enhanced strength, and the cube lashed backwards before the Skull could remember to wish instead of grab, embedding itself in the drywall near the top of the closet door.
“Morgan…  -oh who am I kidding, this has the Queen of the Goths written all over it…  Hm.  Wonder if Sunset’s made a play for War Machine by now?”
“Listen, this road trip… you wouldn’t be planning to start it tomorrow morning, would you?”  Tony asked.
“Those were yours?”  Tony frowned.  He slipped a hand around the back of Steve’s neck in a caress without looking.
Cap, like Tony, was in civvies today.  He wore nondescript blue jeans, brown steel toed boots, a butter yellow button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and a blindingly white t-shirt underneath it.  Over one arm, he carried a brown leather bomber jacket with an eagle on the back.  Cap looked fantastic, but how he’d gotten out the door of the Avengers’ mansion looking like a refugee of the early fifties without Janet Van Dyne waylaying him for his own good, Tony had no idea.
Steve came back in from setting the table, paused, went back out and tweaked a few things, then put on a jazz record, and stared out the high windows at the darkly overcast sky for a while, arms folded across his chest.
Tony took out the tools he would have needed for a clutch adjustment to make the performance sound better, and grabbed a pencil from the coffee can by the phone.
When he pressed a small metal stud on the side of his desk-lamp though, the desk light switched to a dim, pale-violet color, and a cleanly-drawn circuit diagram appeared on the yellowed pages of the manual in thin lines of luminescent blue.
“Nice work,” Spider-Man said, approvingly.  He looked up at the way the silos towered into the twilit sky, and scampered up the back of one.
God she was beautiful, lying there under diffuse, cloud-tempered light that somehow told him they were in London…
“And so I will,”  Tony promised,  “-but I can’t have a gorgeous lady in a golden mask wandering out in her birthday suit, or Peter’ll want one too.”
of molten metal be?  Perfect unbroken contact.  Have to shield it.  Gel.  Gel from one of those heat/cold packs?  Those were -designed- to be heated, and the outer interface wires would produce the necessary-
War Machine was having a hell of a time not catching the Midnight Racer in his line of fire.  The Green Goblin was worse, though.  Targeting solution after targeting solution failed with a nugatory red blink as the villain flew, evaded, -played- him.
For one thing, a thorough airing of the Stark family’s laundry would run the risk of taking the focus
“You too,” Steve smiled, “-and I have a feeling we’ll meet again, but right now I should really be getting on the road.”
His mind wandered, and he saw other cities.  He saw a canyon with sheer walls.  A silver twin-engine fighter plane chasing clouds like a high-speed flechette round.  Tall, silent monoliths of neon, wavering in the rain.  A glowing subway map, and a hundred, a thousand fluxuations of weight and momentum sparking back along the tracks…
He reached into the main compartment of his hockey bag, barely unzipping it, and found the tool kit inside the belt-plate of his armor by feel.
Matt Murdock pulled on the red leather gloves of his Daredevil costume, and listened approvingly to an intro that sounded like the awakening growl of a robot that could stomp Tokyo.
Tony flexed around him, pushing back a bit harder, and smiled down speculatively, eyes lidded.  Should he make Steve elaborate on that statement…?
“-Just give it back to me when you’re done,” Cap smiled, coming in and pushing down his cowl one-handed.
“Oh, this is where you finally tracked them down to?”  Tony guessed, looking at the room with greater interest.
Steve watched as Harry was dragged into the huddle and introduced as well, as Peter’s best friend.  Harry’s good manners were automatic, the trained, insincere camaraderie of New York high society, overlaying a very young and nervous eagerness to please.  Jarvis handled the young man with both care and skill.  -But then, if War Machine had dropped him the first time, Harry wouldn’t have been there at all…
“This is a villain you’re going to have to learn to share,” Tony said, putting a hand on Peter’s shoulder.
“I… I’ve always gone on the theory that the less my friends and family, you know, the civilian ones, knew about my caped crusades, the safer they would be, but um… it doesn’t always work out that way.”
Tony leaned one hand against the jukebox and pushed the required buttons, his back towards Steve.  He was wearing a short sleeve collared shirt that he’d bought in Jamaica unbuttoned over one of his whiter A-lines, and a pair of clean blue jeans with a small stain of dribbled epoxy along the outside of the right knee.
Peter hugged his friend back, hesitantly.  So many things had happened in the past eighteen hours, he’d almost forgotten that Harry -knew- he was Spider-man, and he certainly hadn’t expected… what
.  He fought like a man possessed, and Tony caught a heavy red boot to the side of the head in the melee.  He stumbled momentarily, his grip loosening-
“Mm, yes and no.  It’s moved from messy and bandaged to painful and a good excuse not to do homework,” Peter explained, resisting the urge to perch, perfectly balanced, on the back of a kitchen chair.
“Fine,” Tony said curtly, making a hands-off gesture, “-I’m gone.”  His glance shifted to Steve and he added, “-I’ll be right outside.”
Steve took Tony’s gauntlet, and walked out into the center of the room, absently handing Tony around behind himself in a circle.  Looking back, he saw two small black boxes with glowing red bulbs spaced far apart on the wall, pointing so that their beams overlapped.  They looked bright enough up there, but the dull red light they cast didn’t seem to carry very well.  Steve caught Tony as he skated around again, and stopped him.
“Oh yeah,” Tony nodded, looking up again, “-they’ll milk this for as long as they can, but it’s over.  …I’m sorry,” he ran a hand back through his sleep-spiked hair.
He turned around and rummaged in one of the middle drawers of the tall tan filing cabinet, coming up with what appeared to be the manual for a commercial air conditioning unit circa 1964.
Peter clipped the last of his drying photographs to the web-line he’d strung back and forth across the bathroom ceiling, and switched out the red light bulb for a regular one to examine them.
Chuck Easton had been on shift for four and a half hours when he got the call.  He’d seen a lot in his tenure as a security guard there, and he was prepared for thieves, punks, tweakers, lost children, vagrants, irate customers, and the occasional gang-member…
Steve sat down at the table across from him, steaming coffee cup almost hidden behind the circle of his fingers.
“-Either way, the Avengers already voted to help out no matter what Colonel Fury says.  Whoever was behind Centralia was counting on the confusion of the crisis in New York to cover it, and now that-”
“-Of course,” Tony’s gaze dropped again, and he withdrew his hand from Steve’s.  “…Listen Steve, about this morning-”
He stepped down off the mound, and walked up to a pile of brittle, crumbled cinderblock at the foot of the wall where his workbench had stood.
This background was all wrong.  It just didn’t do, with primary colors.  They needed something harsh, a dividing line just as… not yellow.  Not white, or it would look French, or like a daytime sky-
No voice emerged, but one of the red-gauntleted hands seemed to be trying to pry open the armor’s breastplate.  There was no visible catch though, and it was locked fast.
.  Tony was a good man, and a complicated one.  He was also a hero in his own right, because he’d dared to imagine it so, and worked tirelessly to make it true.
Steve swallowed, and lifted the waistband of Tony’s boxers down, careful not to snag him.  That was never fun, and since he knew-
This- -this was wildfire.  This was arching, striking, quick.  This was each man taking his pleasure in the other, and
Peter found he could move again, and had to execute a quick back-flip to keep from falling over.  He bounced off the tips of his fingers, and landed lightly in front of Tony in a crouch.
“I can see you’re a busy man, so I’ll come straight to the point.  Have you worked on anything for Captain America recently?“
He’d barely begun when the door opened.  Tony came in looking windblown and carrying a full brown paper bag in each arm.   He shut the door with his back.
He raised his hands unsteadily afterwards, still catching his breath, and ran them down over Steve’s smooth, wet hair.
Tony felt the attack coming a half-second too late, and drove his left elbow back with his full strength behind it.
Tony was silent for a long moment, looking first at War Machine’s dark eye-slits, and then at the unconscious confusion on Harry’s face.  He was almost awake now…
Tony turned up the collar of the army field jacket he’d gotten that morning, and crossed the street.  The name tapes on the jacket had said ‘Kroger’ before he’d removed them, carefully cutting each olive-colored stitch with the tip of an Xacto knife.
“I can do that,” Harry nodded, looking up.  He paused a moment, “-no, screw that, I’m -buying- you lunch.  I’ll uh- -I’ll call and see if MJ wants to come out with us too,” Harry promised.
Steve smiled and shook his head, but he got two beers out of the refrigerator and handed one over.  Tony was dusted head-to-boots in fine metal shavings, and the damp fabric of his once-white A-line clung to his chest and the covered arc reactor in ways that were very difficult not to draw.
War Machine took off in a new direction, pushing his bootjets to the very outer edge of their range.
An elderly Chinese lady on a bus, her hair rolled up in a severe hairdo secured by a pair of long wooden chopsticks.
“You’re forgiven,” she smiled, and meant it.  MJ pressed his fingers with hers, then released his hand and went to open the door.
“-I don’t know,” Tony admitted, drawing his knees up and folding his arms over top of them, “-after what happened during the Tet Offensive, I don’t think there was a way to win it…”
Steve looked beautiful wet.  The heat of the shower brought out the healthy color of his skin as if he’d just finished a workout, and the water plastered his hair to his skull, darkening the blonde a shade or two.  A smooth comma the color of winter wheat straw hung down over Steve’s left eye, adding the visual impression of a lowered hat-brim to his warm, knowing glance.
From the time he was twelve to the time he was fifteen, Steve and his mother Sarah had lived in a small apartment that had a kitchen sink, but no private bathroom.  -That had been down the hall.  He’d made a point of brushing his teeth in the kitchen sink that they didn’t share with anyone though, and in a way Steve had been judging every living space he’d had since on the basis of whether or not he’d had to brush his teeth and/or shave in the kitchen sink.
, why hadn’t he seen the resemblance before?  They both had the same tall, thin build, the same large eyes and tightly-cut wavy hair that seemed to be two different shades at once when the sunlight hit it…
He’d broken up what he’d been told was a riot at a small college campus, and learned that two of the Red Skull’s henchmen had been behind the whole thing.
Steve could at least handle himself, and Tony trusted that whatever paper trail the DOD had set out behind him would hold water like the Hoover
Tony got up, forcing himself to walk steadily, and took a half-finished bottle of Jack from the second shelf.  He unscrewed the black cap with his fingers, and took a long swallow.
Steve rejoined Tony in the center of the bed, and Tony pulled the sheets up over both of them.  They lay face to face beneath, and looked at each other by slowly rippling blue-white light.
“That- that was uh…”  Tony trailed off, blinking a little as he waited for the English language to reassert itself.
The fireman because the girl was -very- pretty, and since she’d used her dress to protect her hands from the spider-web zip line, she was now in nothing but her underwear and one red high-heeled shoe…
Opening his eyes, Tony found himself in the arms of a beautiful woman.  The surface of her blonde hair flickered in the rush of wind the way the edge of a frayed flag does, and the fact that she wasn’t squinting at this speed made her seem far more than human.
“Peter, Tony, Tony’s roommate Steve, and Aunt May.  -Oh, and there was a blonde lady in a suit here earlier, but she left,” MJ listed.
As catalyzed as they were by the transistors that boosted them, Tony’s jets -were- still basically just air compressors, and point-blank they cooled instead of heated, plunging the temperature of the other suit’s unibeam’s focusing lens down fast.  It exploded in a hail of high-tempered glass and a small fountain of electrical sparks.
,” Tony insisted, “-the Goblin’s dangerous and he’s crazy, but he’s not stupid.  He went after four soft targets to spread us out, then he hit my place with enough high-temperature incendiary bombs to level this
They plowed through the top quarter of a telephone pole without pausing, and dug a shallow, thirty-foot gouge in the asphalt of the street beyond before pulverizing the far curb.
“I’m worried about Harry,”  Steve admitted,  “-Hank says there’s probably no way to reverse what he did to himself with the Green Goblin’s serum… not now that it’s- -precipitated, I think is the word.  The chemicals are spent, but they’ve already changed the way his body works.  Forever.”
Tony made his way into the kitchen, finally found the light switch, and started some coffee brewing.  …Even the first
That pretty much compounded the list of things he hadn’t meant for Steve to walk in on, but it didn’t matter now anyway…
“Aaah!”  Steve did a quick and improbable twist of his body, grabbed empty air where the shirt had been a moment earlier- and woke up.
Tony shrugged out of the shoulder straps on his second try, and Steve guided the shield the rest of the way down off of his arms.  He set the shield aside, and gathered Tony back against his chest, skin to skin.
Higher until he had to yawn to pop his ears for the third time, and the flying saucer was barely a silver speck in his field of vision.  He was losing speed fast now, until finally…
Tony removed the second retaining screw, pulled Misty’s smooth metal hand out of the wrist-joint about half an inch, and twisted the whole assembly around a hundred and eighty degrees, exposing the electrical connectors.
Steve thought of the way he’d let Bucky bum cokes off of him when he’d wanted to make sure the boy wouldn’t disappear.
Hunting and being hunted, pursuing and controlling the chase with contemptuous ease, the Goblin kept -just- out of range, intent on taking the Midnight Racer apart, slice by slice…
“You’re not okay, either,” Tony stated.  He put his keys down on the dresser, and came over.  Steve’s shield lay roughly in the middle of the bed, star upwards.
True, Spider-man was probably behind this -somehow-… but the Racer had tricked him, had made him take revenge on the wrong people -first-, like a fool…
Unlike the frost giants however, the Green Goblin had a reputation for taking hostages… temporarily.
“And Mary Jane- -thank god Harry had the sense to get her to safety first, but she was worried about me
Steve thought about sliding a hand around either side of Tony’s waist, and pressing a kiss against the back of his neck.
“I… don’t really know yet,” Peter admitted, in a voice that sounded dangerously close to cracking.  “I told him, and… at first he was just shocked, you know?  And then he was like, ‘that’s cool, man,’ and… Then I went over how that was why I kept disappearing, and why I never said anything to MJ, and- -then he got upset and said I shouldn’t have treated him like a child, and I said-” Peter broke off, and sighed.  He ran a hand back through his damp, mask-flattened hair.  “Well… Harry spent the night at his dad’s house.”
Luke sighed, took his wristband off, and delicately slid the control bar inside to a different channel.
He made it to just outside the door of Harry’s room, and leaned back against the wall, shoulders slumped.  Tony tried the coffee.  It tasted better than it smelled, but not by much.
, when Steve would feel honor-bound to stay at the garage with him anyway because of that Centralia thing?
“Whadda you think, Cap?”  Fury challenged, “-or do you gotta go talk it over with somebody -first-?”
“No, most of the bands weren’t even around when I got this,” Tony said, patting one of the jukebox’s polished fairings.
“Don’t be a hero,” she kissed him then, hands cupping his face, and rising slightly on tiptoe to meet him at eye level. “-Just
the Green Goblin’s arson spree.  Best case scenario if that happened, the bastard would get clean away, and at worst the Goblin might decide to do something
Peter wasn’t touching the hoverboard parts on the bench though, he was just gazing down at them thoughtfully.
The list went on and on, and Peter still wasn’t sure Tony was showing him the whole thing.  He’d met a lot of strange people tracking down the names on Tony’s list…
Peter opened his mouth as if to join in, closed it, then reached down and unplugged the thick black cord at the back.  The song died in mid-syllable.  Tony gave Peter a thumbs-up, and uncovered the mouthpiece.
But that wasn’t what stopped him.  Set into the center of Iron Man’s otherwise very Human-looking chest like the lens of a large magnifying glass, was a device like Steve had never seen before.
Tony’s prisoner broke the kiss when he felt the first touch of steel against his skin, but it was already too late.  Tony leapt back away from the bed, and yanked the man half off the mattress onto his face by the handcuff chain.
Tony hung back as aunt May congratulated Peter, and surreptitiously checked his watch.  All the indicator lights were still off.
He heard the slight grind of a can opener, looked up to see Peter opening a can of stewed tomatoes, and gave up.
Peter was busy with the books for about an hour, and then he got… bored.  He’d hoped he could talk to Tony about what was going on with Harry, but
“Bit by radioactive spider, remember?  And if it’s so unsafe, why do -you- keep it in there?”  Peter countered.
“…What were you saying just now about professor Yinsen?”  Steve asked, leaning back against the kitchen counter.
, you fall-!”  His enemy was on him in less than a second, chained wrists looped around Tony’s throat from behind, strangling the life out of him with a strength born of sheer, uncomplicated bloodlust.
War Machine met him eyeslit to eyeslit, using a slight power-up of the red indicator lights within his helmet to create the impression of a glare.
Together they staggered up, and ran for the exit through a pale haze of shattered marble like everyone else.  Loud over the sound of the blaring building alarms, the Green Goblin was still laughing.
“Hi.  Hi Steve.  You would not believe how late I am- …hey what’s wrong with the pancakes-?”  Peter asked, with concern.
Tony won his own victory however, because while War Machine was the officially recognized version, Iron Man had been picked up by the wave of anti-establishment zeitgeist sweeping the city.
Tony dropped his helmet onto the floor with a spinning crash and shoved the couch out of the way a little too hard, adding yet another rip to the green leather as it struck the corner of a bench-vice against the opposite wall.  His fingers fumbled with the catch of his red breastplate, and he swore, putting one armored hand against the wall as his vision tunneled momentarily.
A huge mob of dead lava-men in an intersection near the theater district, still coated and anonomized by the glistening coat of unnatural ice that had frozen them in mid-charge.
“Nothing!  I mean… nobody was hurt this time…”  Peter passed the bottle from his left hand to his right, but still didn’t drink.
“Good morning,” Steve said, padding in and filling a coffee cup from the pot Tony had brewed earlier.
Tony saw the Midnight Racer fall, and it was nothing like slow motion.  It was cancelled inertia, a moment when time stood still, then engaged again with all the subtlety and grace of an igniting afterburner.  The Green Goblin grabbed sky, and Tony went after him, and the Goblin whipped out another of his bat like blades, ripped the face-shield off of the Midnight Racer’s black motorcycle helmet, and-
“Nothing, I- -I’m sure Peter’s safe,” Tony managed, then cracked up again and added, “-I jus’ hope he remembers some advice I gave ‘im…”
The modular camera that folded into the heavy armor of his left shoulder was already recording, patiently awaiting the command to synch its precise servo-driven movements with the direction of his eyes.  If the pattern of the last few days held, his target would be passing by within an hour or so.
Steve’s back looked stiff, and he was holding his shield an inch or two up and closer to his body than he usually did.  Tony frowned mentally and slid down off the fire truck, meeting him halfway.
Tony grinned.  He jumped up, snatched his helmet off the tabletop, did a few dramatic dance moves with it, and kissed it firmly on the faceplate.
And then he saw something that looked more like the surface of the moon, a daytime image…  An irregular pile of pale gravel and ash, melted in places, surrounded on two and a half sides by a fragile-looking cinderblock shell.
An explosion rocked the mall from where Easton had been standing a moment earlier, and threw him and his rescuer skidding across the smooth-polished floor.
“Whose record is this?”  The Scarlet Witch asked, stopping the turntable of the record player in the common room that had been left playing when the mission alarm sounded.
At the time, Tony had been wiring the tower’s security system, and it had been good to talk to Jan without a lab-coated shadow…
“Shrapnel, among other things.  If you got really lucky, you might get an upgrade out of it,” Tony joked, tapping the glowing front of his arc-reactor.
-!”  Steve beamed, and leaned back against the door with Tony in his arms, shutting it harder than he’d meant to.
War Machine waited, facing the floor to ceiling windows that ran the length of the entire west wall.  A number of couches and chairs were clumped stylishly in the room behind him, but as sturdy as they looked, they hadn’t been built with eight foot tall powersuits in mind.  The sun didn’t discriminate however, hanging low along the horizon beneath a magnificent pile of red-orange clouds.
Steve put his jacket down, found a clean red rag in a bin by the small pneumatic air compressor, and started wiping down the tools in Tony’s big red roll-around toolbox.
He walked up to the neon glow of the red and yellow jukebox against the back wall in just his boxers, and pressed ‘F-11-PLAY’ on the selector keypad.
his boss was very little good to man or beast.  For one thing, the man smelled like a used bar-mat, and for another he-
Steve ducked his head under the shadow of a broken, blackened beam, and stood.  The gutted warehouse was silent yet not, the whole unsafe structure still settling with faint crunches and whispery groans.  Some sections of the roof had burned and fallen in entirely, others were bare grates of unbroken beams with the cold morning sky showing through them.
The Mark V had been in some ways a stylistic throwback to the Mark II, but he’d returned to the hinged plate rather than telescoping design to allow for the use of a hollow-ceramic microbead alloy that could take almost
Harry blacked out the canvas, killing the rest of the paint tube, then made up a palette of red, blue, white, and darkest gray.

“Mm.  Hey, Spider…”  Tony muttered, and- -paused, frowning.  “-Since when do you put your boots on the counter, and how many cups of that coffee have you had?”
Tony muttered under his breath, and dug a five and a ten out of his wallet, handing them over.  The bag changed hands.  Tony reached in, retrieved a smaller paper bag sealed with masking tape, and ripped the top off of it without ceremony.  He began matching the new electrical connector plugs inside to a series of unmarked wire bundles laid out as if for some occult ritual on the plastic drop cloth to his left.
Harry heard the door open, and looked up too quickly.  The world slid back and sideways a little.  Harry did his best to ignore that and blinked, wondering just how badly injured he was, under the drugs.
Tony had completed the Mark II Iron Man armor nearly a month and a half earlier, but in the press conference Morgan had held when he revealed War Machine’s existence, he claimed that an early version of the plans for the suit had been stolen from Stark Industries.  This had started an extremely cold-blooded conflict between Morgan and Tony that Tony officially lost in 1968, when Morgan was awarded all patents relevant to the War Machine armor.
“Oh.  Well, that would be all right,” Steve agreed, with a relieved smile.  He patted Tony’s hip one-handed.  “-Scoot.”
“Anybody you wanna bring in for a look at this stuff?  -Before- we call in the shmucks that lost it in the first place, I mean?”  Lt. Farrell asked.
“You’re just saying that because the North Vietnamese never actually invaded US soil,” Tony accused, without rancor.
Harry, slumped in the leather chair by the right hand set of glass double doors, looked up over his shoulder quickly, as if startled.
The Green Goblin wasn’t liking the way the odds were shifting.  He WANTED the Midnight Racer.  He wanted him dead in so many ways.  That sneaking, thieving, indecisive, no talent
“I sent the team in,” Fury acknowledged, “-but when I find out who was behind that bomb, I promise I’ll save ya a piece.”
“My- -I know somebody who has one of these,” Harry said, looking the car over with a fair show of interest. “-Is Peter around?”  He added, casually.
“Jarvis, you made it!”  Tony cried happily, waving his guest inside, and instantly looping an arm around his shoulders.
Tony shut his eyes tight, and breathed in the cold air of a New York winter.  Shades of damp, and clean ocean air, and overlapping layers of car exhaust.
Tony looked down at the Green Goblin.  He still half expected the villain to wake up and began fighting again…
Tony hit the Green Goblin and knocked him off his glider, slamming the villain upwards thirty feet above the skyline and catching him by the back of his tattered purple tunic…
He saw smoke in the garment district, and the soggy, charred backdrop of a museum lobby… though that
fast, leaving the ground with a startled yell on sheer momentum and wrapping himself up the web-line like a yo-yo on a string.  Spider Man managed to release the web in time to avoid being wrapped up WITH his opponent, but the hurtling man collided with him in mid-air, knocking both of them to the floor.
Two armored targets attacking, one soft target running, and this Goblin had -still- attacked the one target he could blood easily.
Five times his gun kicked in his hands, the sound of each shot clear and louder than anything else in his ears.  As his finger was tightening around the trigger a sixth time, Easton was hit with a flying tackle from the side and his shot went wide, passing through the coat-sleeve of a fleeing shopper and plowing into the wall beyond.
“Three?”  Peter guessed, “-I mean, this would be my third one.  The coffee’s really good here, you should try it.”
Steve’s half-asleep mind took a moment to translate that, but he’d memorized the jukebox’s playlist codes months ago, and D-6 was
Iron Man, meanwhile, had just duct-taped a small side-view mirror from the crooks’ getaway truck snugly to the front of Unicorn’s forehead-laser.  He kept a heavy armored boot on Unicorn’s chest, and looked up to see how Spider Man was doing.
Steve nuzzled the side of his neck drowsily, and let go of Tony’s sweat-slick hands to hug his shoulders securely, still buried deep inside.
Correcting that asymmetry would mean either re-manufacturing the plasma ionization ring, or creating another one from scratch.  Simple enough.  The real problem lay in switching out the old ring for the new, because he couldn’t disconnect the arc from his chest while it was still in operation without being reduced to a pile of carbon cinders by the resulting electrical discharge.
Tony caught his breath, but he couldn’t honestly say he was surprised that Steve had figured it out.
He could smell the oily chemical tang of the insulation foam of his armor overheating, and the points where metal touched his skin felt like they’d been left out for an afternoon under the Saharan sun.
He liked drawing things with his finger on the bathroom mirror, and going down the street for a carton of milk, and really getting to
It glowed suddenly brighter between his fingers, and Peter was flung across the room into the closet door by a bolt of crackling yellow energy.  The handcuffs simply ceased to exist, and the man surged to his feet, the glowing object held high and threateningly in his upraised hand.
War Machine had a lot more territory to cover than he’d led Steve and the others to believe when they had nominated him as an Avenger, however.
Iron Man fired his boot-jets without asking why, and narrowly missed being pile-driven through the side of the downed silo.  Warmonger turned, took the two sides of the riven steel plating in his hands, and ripped them apart, striding back through.
He thought of the strange, not-quite-acknowledged sensation he sometimes got while plugged into the city’s power grid, that supralogical instinct that he was now part of a gestalt electrical nervous system far greater than the one in his body alone…
“Aren’t you going to do anything about him?”  Peter pointed out the open doorway towards a tiny triangular shape caught in a flat spin.  Both the jet’s engines were dead.
Steve had rarely seen another man’s crotch at close range before, and never when he was allowed to stare openly.  He
the Avengers, you did keep your involvement with SHIELD from the rest of us in a deliberate and very underhanded manner, and you disobeyed my direct order to report sightings of either the Green Goblin -or- the Midnight Racer.  Worse still, you voluntarily cut off communication with the rest of the team at the start of an extremely dangerous battle so you could go off and play Lone Ranger against -two- other fliers, one of whom was our true target!  Mister, I had to find out that the Green Goblin we took down in the mall wasn’t the real one from
“…And ah- my cellmate used to bring me breakfast while I was recovering from this,” Tony added, tapping his chest just beside the arc reactor.
Peter swung comfortably in a hammock-like nest of webbing over the desk in the garage, one red and blue foot dangling tiredly over the side.  Like a loose strand of this lazily-spun web, a white phone cord looped down out of Peter’s nest to the phone jack on the wall below.
“Well…”  Steve smiled, keeping his eyes firmly on the vaulting horse across from him, “…as you were, ladies.”
He talked too much, and he was too careful, and he thought cutting off a litany of swearwords with a kiss wasn’t obvious.
Steve lay back, and gathered Tony’s head against his shoulder.  Tony scooted in a little closer, and felt the power cord pull straight against his chest.
“If you could GET it open past the dummy-locks I installed, I’d be taking you to the emergency room,” Tony admitted.
“A set of clean coveralls, one latex exam glove sized large or medium, and a soldering kit,” Tony replied, brisk and professional.
Tony’s fingers followed unhurriedly, skimming lightly across open country, sometimes stroking unapologetically into the warm, fascinating shadows her body presented him with…
Steve’s emotion translated physically into a tightening of his hands and a partial groping of Tony’s ass.  Tony braced his hands on Steve’s shoulders hard, and bit his lower lip for a moment.
Tony thought briefly of magnetizing his repulsor disks and erasing everything in the room, but that might be noticed in the morning…
Tony broke that train of thought off sharply with an unconscious sigh, hands deep in the pockets of his jacket.
Tony’s eyes flicked to the Red Skull, who was instantly encased in something like a giant iron coffin.
“We have more of what you’d call an open relationship,” Tony smirked.  “And… thanks for getting me off that missile, lady.  When I couldn’t break out of the magnetic field from Warmonger’s suit, I… that was a bad moment.”
Tony wandered in, unshaven and still stretching.  He wore a large pair of dark blue NYPD sweat pants, and nothing else.
Tony became aware of the fact that he’d leaned his ass back against Steve’s hands at some point, and that Steve was holding him from falling further backwards without apparent effort.
The kids he had stopped to talk with as Iron Man a few minutes earlier had taken their bikes and left, and the lot where his garage had been stood empty.
Luke frowned down at his wristband, and pressed the button down again, as firmly as he dared.  It was rated for a hundred and fifty pounds of pressure before keying anyway, but it was so easy to misjudge these things…
The armor plate unlocked and swung open on its left-hand hinge… just like the hood of his old friend Arnie’s father’s car.
“-Okay,” Tony nodded quickly, now not sure exactly -what- Steve’s plan was, but having deduced that it involved one or both of them getting a blowjob.
He lifted his face off of Steve’s arm carefully and sat, up, putting his feet on the floor.  Hm.  Still wearing his boxers from the day before.  Never a good sign.
how my enemies love grabbing her…  What if it’s just her and me next time?  Or if Harry-” Peter broke off, and sighed.
, letting this come to a head now could only serve as a distraction.  And they had a Goblin to catch.
Tingling, like champagne bubbles along the surface of his skin.  Heat that his body couldn’t contain.  Steve’s hands, plying him.  Stroking, and anchoring him.  Trying to help, and -fucking- their rhythm, and then
“That is a- fine idea, and it did occur to me,” Peter assured him, “-eventually.  But the problem was there was -ice- under the bridge.  And it fell off.  And I webbed, but the angle was too low.”

The exo-suit facing them was massive, at least twelve feet tall with shoulder-mounted rotary guns, and far bulkier than Tony’s Iron Man armor.  …It
…Floating high up in the nearer left-hand corner of the room in what looked like a split-second attempt to hide, were Wanda and Warbird.  …Though Steve supposed that having seen this
“Okay, -I- could ask them what it was really like back then, and maybe get some pictures of their patches.”
Tony ordered, and blasted up out of the hydrant-spray, shattering the water into a spreading nimbus lit from within.
“Uh-huh,” Tony agreed pleasantly, eyes flicking to the clear plastic ID holder clipped to the pocket of her sharp blue blazer.
, still naive enough to miss what was going on right under his nose, still as much of a target as he had been in high school, but now hunted by far stronger, far deadlier bullies, men with powers of their own, from whom Harry could no longer protect him.
“Please, please tell me that someone was Nick Fury, because I could really use the blackmail material,” Warbird grinned, one eyebrow raised.
A shadow in the smoky night sky above, Peter was swinging back and forth between the roof of the club and the roof of a high-rise across the street, bringing people across with him.  The fire department had one engine trained on the club itself, and another hosing the nearby buildings for the inevitable collapse.  Fat drops spattered and hissed across the hot metal of Tony’s faceplate as he drew back from the sealed double-doors.  The cops had taken charge of the two long, thickly-spun weblines Peter had left from the corners of the building to the ground.  The braver and more desperate of the trapped people above were wrapping their jackets or shirts around the line and sliding down the long curve to the ground that way.  The zip lines were a calculated risk, dangerous as hell to use with a mob of untrained civilians up there, but with the roof tar melting under them, there really hadn’t been any choice.
“I should have hauled him in days ago,” Tony sighed, running a hand back through his helmet-mussed hair.
- -the teeth of a SHIELD ambush.  Oh, the agents had given it the old college try… but they’d only had standard gliders, not whatever that thin, sled-looking thing was, and they hadn’t known about the multiband jamming.
Tony wasn’t watching the boy’s hands though.  He was watching Harry’s expressive eyes.  First they widened in shock, then narrowed as the pain of the movement registered, painkillers or no.  There was consternation, the wounded fear of a kicked puppy, maybe a shadow of guilt…
Tony took the receipt the cashier handed him across the counter, and barely looked at it before folding the slip of paper into his wallet.
“No you don’t, that was a new container.  I think you keep it in there to make it look like you don’t know what you’re doing, so people won’t ask you what the freezer’s really for.”
It was a long red slash, running from a hands’ breadth to the right of the center of his chest, to the outer edge of his right shoulder.  Blood didn’t show up well against black leather.  It absorbed, spread, and slid off with the wind shear of his movements.
Tony tightened his scan, and began searching under individual scales one by one, like a small animal searching under the leaves of a plant for insects.
Stealthily, he began spinning a canopy of web over the entire battlefield, thin-stranded but strong.
On the other hand he couldn’t simply let the arc run down until it was safe to disconnect, because the transistorized magnets that kept his heart from failing would run out of power at least forty thousand volts before that happened.
Steve glanced over his shoulder in Peter’s direction, then changed quickly into jeans and a clean white t-shirt.  He wasn’t used to paying attention to modesty around other men, really- -the Army had beaten out what little modesty he possessed
Iron Man stood in the rain of an open fire hydrant, boots apart on the wet concrete, arms held slightly up away from his sides.  He tipped his face up, eyes shut, and let the water rinse the caked ash off his clear (now slightly warped)  Plexiglas eye shields.  There were muffled voices all around him, but for the moment all the fires were out, and the whirr of his suit’s internal cooling fans was the sweetest sound on Earth.
“Judging from the offer Titanium Man made me the other day?”  Tony said, raising an eyebrow significantly, “-interesting.”
The Goblin’s glider didn’t look like it would hold up well against a blow from his shield, but there was something else to see here…
Tony ordered without looking up, and landed as close to the doors as he could get without getting sucked in.
Tony knew that whether the man the Avengers had found had been the real Captain America or not, the government was probably already re-writing him.
Peter clung to the warm shadowed wall beneath a nearby office building’s side ventilation duct, and watched the lurking silhouette above him silently.  Something like a small weapon on War Machine’s left shoulder had suddenly come to life, tracking.  Had he seen the Goblin?  Why wasn’t he reporting it?  Peter’s Spider-comm. remained silent… though admittedly, right across from the north tower’s massive radio antenna was not the best place to send a clear transmission…
Whitney draped herself artfully onto Tony’s half of the bed in a way that arguably counted as payback, and waggled her fingers at him.
“You didn’t get doused in Adhesive X, did you?”  Tony asked, looking down at the blanket-roll suddenly.
The tools following him didn’t know who the Midnight Racer was, but if they thought like the Avengers usually did, that wouldn’t even -matter-.
“-Experiment,”  Steve said with a blush, and caught his breath with a gasp as he felt Tony’s hand on him again, and saw the beads of cool, clear gel squeezing out through the other man’s fingers as they tightened
“You should see this,” Steve said, climbing back onto the bed and sitting up cross-legged against the headboard, newspaper in hand.
He missed Peter’s nose by a clean inch and a half, though if he’d been wearing a repulsor gauntlet, Peter would have been history.
A perfect fusion, a rising pressure-wave of liquid heat that swept through Tony’s body and -owned- him, and Steve held him down
Tony paused just inside the low-walled enclosure of where the walls had been and exhaled, his breath visible in the chilly air.
“No, you see, I don’t think the Racer knew War Machine was there, and War Machine didn’t know -I- was there, so it was like this chain- stalking- thing…  …Which makes me wonder if there was someone else behind
you got magicked down there by the Red Skull in the first place, and decided to pass tha time by trainin’ this birdman kid- -what the hell was your name again…?”
“Sure thing.  What’s wrong with it?”  Tony asked, straightening and wiping his hands on the thighs of his green coveralls.
“How are you feeling?”  MJ demanded, sitting sideways on the edge of the bed, smoothing the pleats of her skirt, and taking his hand.
Tony was out cold against Steve’s side, head heavy on his shoulder, dark hair drying flat on one side.  The muffled light of the re-synching arc reactor was nearly steady, but Steve left the plug where it was.
The Midnight Racer arced straight up along the wall, one step ahead of the Green Goblin, and finally mis-judged the physics.  Wishing alone wouldn’t stop gravity, and it was such a fine detail, so easy to forget with graphic, grisly death a fraction of a second behind him…
He took out the metal paint tube, and squeezed out a healthy portion onto his first two fingers, smooth and cool and glowing crimson.  This color had a life, a fire the others lacked.  He smeared it across the top of the canvas and down in a quick swan’s neck curve, highlighting feeling rather than form.
Peter’s webline whipped past their heads, snagged the bedside table lamp from the other side of the room, and brought it crashing back against the side of Tony’s opponent’s skull.
“Come on.  One kiss, and then I’ll leave you alone to do your caterpillar- cocoon- whatever,” Tony promised, illustrating the shape of the blankets by twirling one hand vaguely in the air.
Tony set his empty glass down, and picked up a slice of green apple.  He took a bite and walked over, still chewing.
He plugged his armor’s power connecter back in, and unlocked the joints of his suit.  Tony slumped against the wall, head down.  The whole center of his chest felt tender, like a deep-tissue sunburn.
He took in the room with a quick, cold glance, and then looked at the cube in his hand thoughtfully.
The Cosmic Cube fell from the wall, and Peter’s next hastily thrown web hit the back of the Red Skull’s hand in just enough time to yank IT away, instead of snagging the cube itself.
, suit up!”  Tony cut him off.  “-We’ve got creeps in a hijacked coast guard cutter attacking a container ship near Ellis Island…”
“-Time to go,”  Peter decided, executing a leap over the Red Skull’s head (he couldn’t stomach the idea of diving
Tony touched a pencil eraser to his lips, and frowned at the precise lines and notation he’d just added in his drafting notebook.
He grabbed the gun’s base, wrenched the weapon clean off at the swivel-point, and pistol-whipped War Machine in the faceplate with it, snapping his scratched gray helmet to the side with a noise like a wrecker’s hammer.
The pre-bombing version of Centralia, Pennsylvania is real too, and /to this day/ the coal vein under the town is still on fire.
“-It’s a lot easier to tell someone who you are when you’ve both got powers, isn’t it?”  Peter said, shrewdly.
Luke took a stride back from their captives, and looked.  The repairs to the Manhattan Bridge were nearly complete, but the part under construction was lit at night, and- …nothing.
Tony smiled, the ends of his mustache curving upwards and a new light in his eyes.  He tapped the Spider-tracer approvingly with his pencil, and turned over his drafting notebook to a fresh page.  With a speed born of decision and long premeditation, the clean, simple outlines of a new garage took shape under his hand…
“It could be…”  Hank studied a slight rust-brown precipitate in the bottom of one of the tubes, swirling it between his fingers, then put the tube back in its place on the rack.
“Regrettably, Mr. Stavros will be unavailable,” a deeply amused mechanical voice said, from on top of a mountain of shipping containers, “-and so will you.”
The Helicopter was thrown forwards by the blast, and it pin-wheeled in midair for a few seconds before the pilots’ regained control.  Hawkeye shut his eyes tight, gripped the overhead bar, and put his free hand over his mouth quickly.
He let out a breath, and reached up to unplug the power cord from his chest.  It didn’t feel any different out than it had in, which meant the synch had finished long ago.  Tony let the cord slip out of his fingers to the floor, and raised his head a little.
He reached up with his free hand, and touched a control just beneath the lower edge of his damaged red and gold helmet.
Warbird handing the Scarlet Witch a Styrofoam cup that steamed promisingly in what had been the early-morning chill, and Wanda looking up at her with a smile.
The inner layer of the chestplate came apart in eight different puzzle-like sections that had always reminded him of a tortoise shell.  He pulled the two canon plugs for the inner LTF panel out of their protective recesses, and unscrewed them.
Tony was a unique texture, at least in Steve’s experience.  Soft skin over firm muscle, sweat-slick, with a tantalizing scrape of dark body hair trapped in between, everywhere but nowhere thickly, until it-
Tony looked up from his search beneath the couch cushions with annoyance, and froze for a moment, paling visibly.
“Go,”   Cap nodded, “-Spider-Man, you’re with me.  Warbird, you’re our eyes in the sky, you and Quicksilver keep any meat-eaters from getting out into the city.  Scarlet Witch, Thor, do something about that time portal, NOW!”
hands, and Tony lost it with a shout that came back from the bricks, eyes tight shut.  His hips were still moving, he’d forgotten how to stop, or maybe it was Steve moving -him-, and it didn’t matter, he was coming and taking Steve down with him, and at the end it…
Peter threw a new line, yanked back on it, and let go as soon as he had enough forward momentum.  He webbed a second line around a flagpole on a hotel, and rode the stretching, clear thread upwards before letting go near the top of the arc, gaining twelve stories.
“I- wait, I haven’t even introduced you- -Jarvis, this is Steve Rogers, Steve, this is Edwin Jarvis, the last man in the world you should make an enemy of.”
The toast was returned.  Tony poured himself a cup of coffee from the pot Steve had been drinking, and joined them at the breakfast table.
Since the arc reactor normally operated around one point five Gigajoules anyway, that wasn’t a pressing issue… but it did mean that nothing he possessed short of the arc itself could power his armor, even if by some miracle the magnets sustaining his heart could be hooked up to a suitably powerful outside source- -
A light flashed blindingly behind Peter’s left shoulder blade, and the Red Skull’s fingers slid harmlessly
have cleaned off before the garage opened tomorrow) -looked rough.  Half-assed and compulsively repaired, with only four original frame-threads crisscrossing in the center to create a base-eight web, and a slight unevenness in the squaring of the spiral.
Tony put the plates down, and took back the plate of toast.  Steve discreetly used his longer reach to snag a piece anyway.
“-I went to art school for a while,” Steve added as a peace offering, “-I dropped out to join the US Army in forty-one.”
Tony walked up to Steve, and stopped.  He passed the scanner through the air in front of Steve’s body slowly, glaring at the readout in ferocious triumph when the indicator light on the device’s side switched from yellow to red.
Two looters, encased in web along with the color TV they were in the act of stealing, suspended from a lamppost.
“You said you had a new song for me?”  Steve asked, coming downstairs in a sky-blue T-shirt and jeans.
He cornered the Racer against the side of a building, taking a brief chance, but War Machine missed, his reversed hand repulsors tearing out the re-bar in the wall behind the Goblin, narrowly missing-
“It was right at dawn, when I was up on the roof setting up my gear.  He was just flying in a straight line, you know?  Like he had somewhere to be.  I think he was comin’ up from somewhere east of here, maybe across the river.”
“-Have you figured out why we’re here yet?”  Steve asked as they climbed the loud, metal-frame staircase.
“No idea, but I’m about to try ‘em out on Peter…”  Tony poured the first wide dollop of brown-flecked pancake batter into a skillet, and swept the edge of the mixing spoon along the side of the bowl so it wouldn’t drip.
There was a slight squelch of static, and a metallic clink from one of Ozzy’s rings as he took the mic back.
The result was… dirty.  Shadows.  Shades in shadows and scraped lines of texture, meaningless, yet speaking in a way that made him hesitate to look at it straight-on.
“Oh, yeah.  That attack only worked on Radioactive Man because- -shit!”  Iron Man dodged a mortar round, just in time.
Steve ran both hands up along Tony’s chest, thumbs dividing around the casing of the arc reactor and smoothly rubbing around the skin at its base.  Tony caught his breath suddenly, and grabbed Steve’s shoulders, eyes open.
“Exactly.  That’s why he started trailing half-burned fuel and losing altitude so fast.  The fuel mixture was spraying all over his igniter array, and
“…Oh my god…”  Warbird muttered, her voice almost lost against the soft skin of Wanda’s shoulder.  Then louder she added, “-Cap- -we didn’t mean to- -we thought the gym would be empty at this hour.  I’m not going to try and explain the rest.”
Four scales up from the lower edge of Steve’s armor and along the seam of the blue leather underneath, Tony found his bug.  He lifted the scale up and held it there with one forefinger, showing Steve the tiny transmitter hidden in a groove on the underside.
City-chlorinated water had dripped into his eyes out of dark fringe that covered his field of vision, and it stung a little.  The thought was peripheral.  Transitory.  Irrelevant.
His current Mark VII armor had included a lot of aerodynamics and articulation improvements, as well as dabbling with solar power for extended flight range.
The man in the box regarded him for a long, silent moment.  Then he grinned, opening both eyes and arching his shaggy eyebrows.
“…You made it up to me,” she whispered, touching a control stud on her mask just beneath the shadow of her smooth, black hair.
He got up, and paced a few turns.  He killed half his beer in one shot without seeming to notice, and held the neck of the bottle between his first and second fingers, forgotten.
Tony choked slightly and shivered under his hands, fingers tightening against the juncture of Steve’s neck and shoulder.
Steve exchanged a glance of complete understanding with the old man, who got up and patted Steve’s shoulder as he gathered his helmet to leave.
General Dunn’s national guardsmen saluted him, and he saluted them back.  The few SHIELD agents did not salute, but they let him pass unchallenged, and seemed to draw themselves up a little as he walked by.
, and the black one’s there for timing control.  This little white one with the red collar’s just there to record engine time, so that wasn’t important.”
Tony glanced down first, and through the hole where the Racer’s tinted visor had been, he recognized the face of Peter’s friend Harry Osborne.
“Steve-” Tony began, unarmored fingers closing with a soft metallic crunch around a thick handful of scale mail across Steve’s shoulder blade, “…please.”
“Just the ones you already know about.  Oh, and a museum, if you haven’t talked to Wanda and Pietro yet.  That was taking place across town while we were busy with the disco fire.”
best kind, the blonde had still chosen to plug him in as if doing a serious medical procedure.  Interesting.
He wrenched the fifty-cal’s gun barrel down like a licorice twist before the gunner had time to decide whether to act on the illegal order.
Tony braced his shoulders hard against the tiled wall of the shower, and lowered his head, whimpering a little in the back of his throat.  His left hand dropped to a grab-bar that had been in the shower above his garage, and slid helplessly against the smooth ceramic tiling without finding it.  Tony’s fingers clenched into a fist at his side instead.
“I had a gas mask though,” Steve continued, his voice tight, “-I thought if I fought the Skull- gave Bucky a chance to get the others clear… but the Red Skull had chained the doors from the outside, and I-I didn’t know- and it got quiet.  I thought they must have made it out, but then I stepped back and tripped over a body- his eyes were still open- and then I saw more…”
Tony reached over left-handed, unfolded Peter’s little finger into a full salute with an affectionately muttered,
“Hey!”  Tony called, striding over with barely-controlled annoyance, “-can I help you with something?”
It wasn’t a perfume nor strictly sweet, but it brought the changing room of a cabaret he’d once visited in the thirties to mind with such vivid clarity that Steve felt his face flush.
Well, there was no reason the arc reactor would fail within his lifetime, provided he kept the voltage fluctuations down by occasionally connecting it back to an ordinary AC power source, and didn’t draw off enough power at once to drop the reaction within the arc casing below 10,000 volts…
Fingers running up through the short, dark hair at the nape of his neck and not quite closing- -a hand under the back of his shirt, migrating without hurry, kneading gently but deeply, strength held back like the glow of a hot-  like the fire-
Norman dismissed Harry with a final qualified nod of approval, and approached Peter’s group eagerly.
Sliding out from under the car by the chassis, Tony stood up and glared at the back of the slim, wavy-haired kid leaning happily over the jukebox.
“Aren’t you going to open that one?”  Peter asked, pointing to the manila envelope at Tony’s elbow, perilously close to a dollop of strawberry jam.
Iron Man had apparently ripped off a major invention from a war-profiteering corporate giant, added cooler toys and a flashy red and yellow paint job, and turned what would have been the ultimate symbol of faceless establishment power into an apolitical force for good on the ground in New York City.
Tony flexed his fingers within his gauntlets, hearing the familiar sliding metallic crunch, and feeling the minute, bone-deep vibrations of actuating servos.  His targeting system picked out the sidearm of an off-duty cop in the small crowd that had gathered to watch, and identified it as a Luger.  Unusual, but there were hundreds of such statistical anomalies, if one knew where to look…
“Captain America named him that,” Tony said, pausing in mid-air to answer, “-we were all tired of calling him ‘that biker guy’ anyway…”
Steve threw the condom away in the trash by the bed, and was glad to be rid of it.  He was slightly -between- sizes for those things, but Tony insisted they were important even between men, so he dealt with them.
The clear plastic sheets were practically made-to-order for this.  Technically they’d been covering an order of furniture to his right when he’d walked in the door, but they made great drop cloths, and the one taped around the table Tony had simply left on.  Now an intricate and regular pattern of disassembled parts had spread onto three such drop cloths surrounding the base of the table, and the best part was, he could just pick up all the plastic corners and -run- if he had to.
A hero, who walked in shadow.  A great war, and troops called up.  The angels of Avalon- -why did that make him think of Spitfire?  A tyrant, whose face was red.  -Boy, did that strike home…
“Well, I just got it, and I’m not sure the adjustment on the clutch is right,” Cap said aloud, but passed Tony a handwritten note with a significant look.
“I was hoping you’d say that,”  Steve smiled,  “-and since someone clearly threatened the lives of seven citizens of New York with a force the police couldn’t have handled, the Avengers will be protecting them until SHIELD and the FBI have completed their investigation.”
War Machine crouched unmoving at the edge of the roof, scanning.  His silhouette was slight and boxy against the starry night sky, obviously just another piece of the monolithic new skyscraper’s high-tech security equipment.
… he’d seen (sometimes helped) Tony stumble in barely charged after too many missions not to…  but he still thought of it as

“I’d say you do,” Steve agreed.  -He would have felt embarrassed to ask for this half an hour ago, but after Tony had all but
“Okay,” Steve nodded.  He took a step back, and sighed.  “-Sorry about that, but I’m not sure who to trust right now.”
Peter dropped to the floor inside with less grace than usual, but kept his footing.  Steve put both hands on his shoulders, steadying him.  The fabric of his costume felt damp, and it was frozen in places.
had no idea that Tony was anything other than an unusually gifted inventor and Iron Man’s one-man pit crew…
Black.  Black and battleship gray, like an oil slick across the world.  Now the red and blue made sense.  Were contained, bordered right.  Still too much though…
Peter suddenly became aware that he was on eye level with the older man’s mouth, even though Steve was barefoot and he wasn’t.  If anything, Steve with wet hair and a clean white towel wrapped around his waist was
Tony paused outside the locked laboratory door, and glanced up at the security camera in the corner.  He shifted his feet a little, and resisted the temptation to see if his access code still worked.
Fury pinched the bridge of his nose between finger and thumb, and ground out the butt of his cigar in the unused white saucer of his coffee cup.
The steel Avenger’s distorted voice seemed to pause strangely on the word, though whether it was from shock or simply choked with anger Tony couldn’t tell.
“Plug this in for me, will ya?”  Tony said, pressing the electrical connector for the arc reactor into Steve’s hand without looking at it.
“…Can I help it if your brain is a physical probability engine?”  Tony grinned, stretching his arms up above his head and arching his back against the shield a little.
walked like a normal man, while everyone else was either skating or simply trying to remain upright.  Steve walked past them like a ghost, like some strange and terrible apparition of vengeance, to whom the principles of shear, gravity, and hydrodynamics simply did not apply.
He remembered the battle that followed- -one of his earliest as Iron Man- -and the hate and confusion in the eyes of a drug-poisoned schoolteacher when he had finally taken the madman down.
Blue.  Royal, just deeper than cobalt, more real….  a wide blue lozenge in the center, wisping purple and less knowable colors at the edges, brightening with a smear of blended white in the middle still just grainy enough to detect.
One of the things that had surprised Peter when he’d first come to work here was how many sidelines Tony maintained in addition to the motorcycle repair shop.  It was a good thing too, or Peter suspected the shop would have gone under long ago.
“More like a gelatinous ooze-” began Spider-Man, “-I think I still had some of the goop dried on my glove before that scarf guy threw me in the river…”
Tony got it, leaving Peter to read Harry the instructions for the new jukebox.  -Since he was going to tear the whole thing apart and rebuild it from the fairings up anyway, Tony figured he’d let them play.
“Exactly.  Warbird needs to learn some flexibility, and Hawkeye could stand to be taken down a peg or twelve,” Steve said, reasonably.
“I’ve been taking apart Harry’s hover-board,” Tony interrupted Steve’s train of thought without realizing it, “-and it’s fascinating.  I mean- -it’s a deathtrap that runs on ether-ethanol, but aside from that it looks a lot like the helical compression array I was working on for a hovercraft in freshman year.  -That’s what gives the board its speed.  I didn’t think to tune the helix for speed, because I’d made this bet that I could drive a Ferrari across the Charles River to Boston U., and I needed all the lift I could get to keep it off the surface of the water without the use of a-”
Tony’s song began with five individual guitar notes, a relatively slow drum score, and a complex, cascading shimmer of something light, with bells.  Underneath it was a scattering of subtle, clear sounds that Steve
Steve broke the seal on his pack of drawing pencils, and shook four of them out of the cardboard box.
Laughing triumphantly, the Red Skull wished his Captain America disguise away and his own rightful mask back in place by the power of the cube.
“…Uh… yeah!  Gotta go, thanks, bye!”  Peter said, taking the roll-up from him and vanishing back down the stairs.
chicken out at this point, the way he had once turned down a very interesting offer from Pvt. Finn in Marseilles…
“Sustained reaction…” he breathed, “-but… that’s impossible, it would take over fifty thou-” Iron Man grabbed the front of Steve’s scale-mail shirt by the star.  “-What did you just shock me with?!”
“Are you saying these were prototypes, or just modified?”  Lt. Farrell asked, crouching in the piled cinders with him.
The empty town outside the helicopter was still unchanged, ominously peaceful like the moment before a dream turned into a nightmare.
“No, but Reed said that all traces of the Venom creature are out of Peter’s system now,” Sue assured him, creating an invisible forcefield-couch across from Tony’s chair and sitting down.  “-You did the right thing by bringing him here, Tony.”
“Yeah, yeah, c’mon in, the light’s attracting moths,” Tony said, motioning him forwards impatiently.
Steve’s face hardened in a way Tony -never- wanted to see directed at him, and Steve took off both of his civilian shirts.  Underneath was a glittering expanse of blue scale-mail, with Cap’s white star displayed proudly in the center.  Steve shrugged out of the leather straps of his shield, and set the large disk down against the toolbox beside him.
“-They’re going to nail your ass to the wall for this, you know that right?”  Tony warned him, suddenly serious.
The song’s oddly new/old shimmer came and went, wrapping itself around the drums and vocals in bright, lingering bursts.  Steve delayed a back step momentarily.  Tony stepped in closer at the invitation, then maintained the new distance.  He felt the warmth of the left side of Steve’s face in the air near his, and smiled quietly.
They were looting- -or possibly exchanging- -the contents of a large wooden crate, but the moment they saw Luke come around the corner two of the five produced guns, and one was an M-14 machine gun.
Peter poured himself a glass of milk by the blinding light of the refrigerator, and slumped into one of the seats at the kitchen table.  He pulled off his mask, and drank.
Pain came and went in clenching waves throughout his chest; he could almost -see- it spreading out from the unbalanced arc reactor like the hard green rings of sonar…
Twenty one stitches on his chest and upper arm alone.  Was that lucky or unlucky?  Either way, it would leave one hell of a scar.  Chest-wounds did.  It was less a matter of flexion than it was one of overall tension.  To move, to breathe, to turn at the waist or lift an arm, all these things pulled at the skin, if not the muscles, of the chest.
The Velociraptors crept out from beneath the tree line on their left, and eyed the remaining red and blue humans with interest.  They seemed to have no visible claws or fangs, and the smaller one didn’t seem to have jaws at
Fury stared back at Steve across the table, and held his well-chewed cigar in the fingers of his right hand thoughtfully.
Tony blinked, not realizing he’d spoken aloud, then shut his eyes as he felt Steve’s fingers gently cupping the back of his neck, lowering him down the rest of the way.  Tony’s back popped twice, and he groaned softly.
Steve stroked the back of Tony’s dark hair gently, and caught one of Tony’s hands fumbling with the belt-buckle of his trench coat as if of its
He could tell Tony was using the word ‘books’ loosely, and that this was going to be one HELL of an undertaking.  He was good with math, but catching the decimal point had been a fluke, a lucky break…  Then again, if he COULD turn this place around, a little extra cash would help out aunt May a lot, and his superpowers -did- take an unreasonable amount of food to maintain…
Tony saw the cables, and then noticed that the markings on the pulled cables and the signal-light cables didn’t match, though both -were- black.  His eyes followed the pipe housing the main electrical bundle down the tracks, and fixed on a small gray building off to one side marked with a ‘Danger: high voltage’ sign.
“-That’s what I thought,” Tony snorted, unsurprised, “-not that they’re actually doing anything illegal…”
“No, I was out looking for the Green Goblin.  …Come to think of it, you window guys probably see a lot up here, don’t you?”  Tony guessed.
Okay, so it was actually half past noon, but…  at… at what -point- in history had people decided to do business in the daytime?  Seriously…  It was outmoded.  Antediluvian.  Should have gone out with corsets and Thomas Edison.  Actually, corsets could stay.  But daytime operation was ridiculous…  Even computers thought better in the cool of night, so why wouldn’t a-
Steve finished unbuttoning his coat, and managed to look both like a wet dream, and completely miserable.
Harry was in his pajamas and bathrobe, and judging from the ungelled wavy chaos of his hair he must have showered at least a few hours ago…
He drew a small oval in the center of the page freehand, and then ruler-straight radial lines out from that shape, one for each idea he had of what to do with the money from the garage.  There were still too many of them…
“It’s- -probably for the best.  My dad’s been under a lot of pressure lately,” Harry said, not quite looking her in the eye.
Tony’s eyes flicked up to meet Steve’s quickly, almost guiltily.  He took a steadying breath, then sighed and answered the question, his voice flat.
A full-length shot of Captain America, standing with one foot on the corner of a red-brick building and looking capable.
Tony turned back to Cap with a look that made Steve wonder if he was about to get punched in the face.
“Good morning, Tony,” Peter said brightly, from his perch atop a counter to Tony’s left.  He was in full costume, aside from having the bottom half of his mask pulled up.
…”  Tony told him frankly, “-but what made you decide to go looking for an apartment in the middle of a goblin-hunt?”  He added, skating closer and stopping again.
made him feel better.  He turned to sit down at the kitchen table, and stopped, staring stupidly.  Sitting in the center of the otherwise empty tabletop, there was a ring.  Tony’s thoughts flicked uneasily to Reed Richards’s book about parallel universes for a moment… and then his reawakening mind recognized it.
There was always an open space in front of the jukebox Steve noticed, no matter how many motorcycles the garage held.  He knew
Iron Man’s repulsor ray hit Unicorn dead center, and knocked him back into a stack of empty blue barrels.  A laser blast passed smoking through one ricocheting barrel, and shattered the warehouse windows above Iron Man’s head, bathing him in flying glass.
Tony set the third pancake aside and poured a fourth, using the same set of neat, automatic gestures he’d used for the previous ones.
“Political asylum and a nice datcha within driving distance of Moscow if I defected,” Tony grinned, “-I had to turn him down.”
“Come back here- -you’re wet- -share-…”  Tony let go of Steve’s dick and took hold of his wrist, fingers sliding without traction against the blonde’s skin, pulling him -down-, until they were aligned again, slick and hard, and powerful in a way that wouldn’t wait, and didn’t have to.
“…I need a longer cord,” Tony decided, frowning and moving back.  “…This’s a twelve.  Need to make a fifteen, maybe a twenty…”
Lower, and Tony felt the smooth, hard edge of the metal resting against the base of his neck, and against the muscles at the small of his back.
“Yeah, Mister Fantastic just finished checkin’ ‘im out,” Luke confirmed, “-s’all over the news.  I gotta go, man…”
“Well…”  Tony thought about the tools he had at present, and tapped thoughtfully against the steel outer casing with the handle of a small screwdriver.  “-I can get you back up to about two hundred and fifty pounds of mechanical force, but it won’t be pretty.”
Iron Man declared with what sounded like a grin, and the unibeam on his armor crackled momentarily without firing.
Tony dropped into a chair at the foot of the bed and sighed, running a hand back through his hair.  He looked at Harry and Peter for a long moment without speaking.
“Um.  Hi-”  Peter blinked, half surprised at being suddenly promoted to ‘associate’, and half trying to figure out why meeting a semi-old-guy who used to be Tony’s butler back in
, which was NOT about exploring meditation states, no matter what Danny had been told at the record store…
Luke added the forklift driver to the growing pile of semiconscious bad guys, and stood glaring down at them, hands on hips.
“-Why breakfast?”  Steve asked, leaning his hip slightly against the kitchen counter to Tony’s left, and folding his arms.
, though… too heavy for stainless steel or silver, and it didn’t hold the heat of Tony’s hand the way it should have…
the people who lived in the neighborhood, and was even cautiously warming up to the idea of living in a future where it was
“Okay, you saw the moon landing, right?  Once there’s no gravity, astronauts turn their space capsules around with maneuvering jets.  You take the top off the air horn or whatever, point it away from the direction you wanna go, and press the valve so it sprays,” Tony instructed, “-there’s
“Look, this isn’t complicated,” Tony grinned, “-you sort out my books until I can make enough of a profit on this place that I can pay you.  Until then, I’ll make you breakfast.”
A window-washer, twelve feet below his securely cabled platform and partly upside-down in an attitude of falling.
Steve stared at it for a long moment, then nodded.  Tony turned back to his scanner, programmed it to filter out the second signal, and gave Steve a thumbs-up.
against that texture…  Fingers gripping Steve’s shoulder, and Tony’s hand palming both of them in a loose circle, which would have been even better with-
Something was happening here.  Something big.  He could feel it coming like he’d felt the long shadow of the Cuban missile crisis…
A motorcycle roared to life outside, and faded away into the flow of early morning traffic.  The garage door rattled down, and Tony came back upstairs.  He dropped into his chair at the kitchen table, finished the dregs of his coffee, and sighed distractedly.
Jarvis smiled in a way that made Peter suddenly want to ask the older man for a glass of milk.  He contained the urge, and shook Jarvis’s hand.
“Maybe the Vibranium’s capable of preserving some kind of wave-harmonic record…”  Tony said thoughtfully, not sounding half as coherent as he thought he did.
“Yes, I GOT that part,” Iron Man agreed testily, squeezing together a steel ladder into a ball that he could throw like a child making a snowball.
Tony raised the plug, and held it at the entrance of the arc’s left power socket.  He took two quick deep breaths; eyes wide open and focused on the garage door, and plugged in.
“Ya know what?  I -like- that idea.  C’mere, let’s you and me go have a little ‘chat’…”  Fury growled.
“Dammit, I thought if I put them in the crisper when I went home, he wouldn’t…”  Peter muttered, choosing a banana off the bunch on the counter instead.
“Over here, Cap,” a grizzled fireman signaled him, pointing to a half-buried strip of corrugated steel on the ground.
He stared the gunner in the face, and turned up all the indicator lights in his helmet for a moment, making the eye slits in his face-plate appear to flash white.  The gunner put his hands up, and paled.
“Peter, you’re a chemist.  Silver Nitrate is terrible for you, and so is Cadmium, Potassium Hydroxide-”
Tony took a deep, unsteady breath, and felt the slight weight of Steve’s hand on his shoulder.  Then he stood, and moved back out of War Machine’s way.
“Anywhere you want, but mothers have been chucking out most of these records for decades,” Tony promised.
“-But there’s something metal inside there that would explode if I opened this door,” Peter said, tapping the front of the freezer.
Steve rolled his motorcycle into the garage, and Tony pulled the door down after him.  Tony glanced up at a small gray box he’d recently mounted on the garage wall, but the indicator light was still green.
Iron Man heard the pilot telling the door-gunner to fire over his helmet radio, and knew that he’d been right.
“It’s a guessing game, Peter.  It’s a horrible, unfair, and -deadly- crapshoot.  You just… think of all the logical contributing factors you can, think about the personalities involved, and who they are
They grappled in near-silence, a battle of wills, sinew, and oxygen.  Tony’s desperate choking, gurgling sounds as his fingers tried to claw under the chain that barred his throat, and the fetid yet recognizably human growl heating the back of his right ear in harsh, determined pants as the chain was pulled tighter…
One of Peter’s shorted-out spider-tracers was sitting like a leftover Halloween toy beside a glass jar of hoverboard screws.  Tony picked the small transmitter up, and smirked.  He set it at the center of the page he was working on, right over the oval, then doodled curved lines in between the radial lines, making the useless brainstorming exercise look like a spider web.
He’d also found the first of the bugs on the bike already, snugged up under the frame itself just beneath the Harley’s gas tank.  -It had been hard to pin down because it was using the entire frame as a transmitter.
Unlike every suit of armor Tony had built since the fateful Mark I, the Mark VIII was designed to take down one specific opponent.
where he wanted to be, until they were both spent, pooling together, breathing hard in the quiet of this new and unfamiliar room, that didn’t handle the soft echoes quite right.
The bird of prey perched on his muscular shoulder fixed it’s small, sharp eyes on the man it’s human partner didn’t like, and hunched its wings out at the stranger pointedly.
all that goddamned gel that now covered the carefully sealed connectors- -without electrocuting him outright.
The first appearance of the Stark Industries War Machine armor had been in 1967, about four months after Tony’s return to the United States.
Steve’s thighs were thick, powerful in the way a racecar’s engine was, and long only because they were built in proportion to the rest.  The lower edge of Steve’s shirt showed a tantalizing glimpse of -amazingly- good abs when he leaned back, and the scratchy-soft dusting of blonde hairs across his lightly flushed pale skin were barely half a shade darker than the forehead-curl that had so entranced Tony earlier.
When he could pick out Greenwich Village visually, Tony cut back upwards in a huge loop, gravity-braking hard enough to bring tiny black dots swimming into his peripheral vision from the G-forces.
Inside, the garage floor was covered with bright metal shavings, and a series of what looked like replacement slats for the damaged garage door lay half-finished on a folding table to Steve’s right.  Tony tugged off his gloves, and pushed his safety goggles up.
idea,” Tony snorted, deciding not to mention Natasha specifically, “-it’s the red in my armor.  They-”
“When did -you- get in?”  Peter asked, settling on a cherry pastry and tearing open the wrapper as he walked over.
When Steve drew back a second time, Tony’s face was lightly flushed, and hungry.  Tony started to sit up, but he felt Steve’s fingers tighten in his hair, -just- enough.
“Yeah, you should have seen SHIELD’s title before they made it into an acronym,” Tony snorted, “-but this is Reed Richards’s new book.”
“-This one’s from Jarvis,” Tony said, setting his coffee cup down and holding up the handwritten page in question.
“Norman Osborne can kiss my ass,”  Tony said bluntly,  “-if he tries to blackmail you with your secret identity, we’ve got the wiring you ripped out of the Goblin Glider with part of an Ostech circuit board attached, and it’s all hearsay at this point anyway.  -Keep an extra careful eye out for being tailed for the next month or so, though.”
“Steve, just- -whatever it is, do it- slow an- and I’ll tell you if I don’t like it, because if you can’t even say it it’s
…Good grief.  How had things gotten this bad?  How could the chilling, hopeless feeling that had swamped his heart at that fatal moment he’d let go… have become a modern pop song?
“Well… now that you mention it, can you call Cap?”  Tony asked.  “-I think the shockwave earlier knocked my helmet radio out, because all I can pick up is this god-awful talk show host…”
Steve decided not to mention the part about Luke telling him he was ‘doing them all a favor’.  He was quite familiar these kinds of running ‘you’re an easy lay’ jokes from traveling with the Howling Commandos during the war, and while he trusted Tony not to resort to the use of actual
An unkempt man with graying hair looked out at him suspiciously from under the edge of the cardboard boxes.  One bloodshot eye closed, and the other seemed to focus more directly on Tony.
Janet Van Dyne, the fairy princess in the blue tea dress, had become a superheroine.  She had her own organic wings the color of clean oil spreading across a pond, detailed in thin gray veins.  She had delicate black antennae, and a tall blonde linebacker of a boyfriend who thought the world of her and could actually -get- small enough to fool around at the size at which her insect wings emerged.
him, and put a hand on his shoulder.  Tony looked back at him silently, and had the strangest feeling that he was being …knighted.
“I heard about that,” Steve said, rubbing the back of Tony’s neck with the gloved fingers of his right hand.
Steve paused, hands cupped around Tony’s back just beneath his shoulder blades, fair skin painted in pale blue light and shadows.  Steve’s blonde hair fell forward a little from Tony’s angle, and the light from the arc reactor made the very edge of it glow white, like exposed fiber-optic cable.
“Screw this!”  Tony fired his bootjets and shot straight upwards until the cars in the parking lot below looked like an assortment of small glass beads.
“That’s a terrific way to start,” Tony smiled, and held out his Coke.  Steve tapped his Coke against Tony’s, and they both drank.
The furniture in the room looked modern, and most of it was distributed logically along one side or the other, leaving a wide open space down the middle that reminded her of Danny’s workout room.  There was a large bed at the end of the room, standing a few feet away from the wall at an angle, as if waiting for the pile of cardboard boxes huddled there to move.
Ghost flowers.  Maybe start over.  Do them all like that, just outlines and details, without substance.  Pour out the water and wait a day or two, and paint in the colors of what was left of the bouquet then.  Death, below an after-image of life.
at that sight.  Even the Skull’s -stance- had been correct, unsurprising in a canny villain who must have seen Captain America do it dozens of times.  Peter dodged the Red Skull’s attack at the last moment, and the shield sliced into a framed Jackson Pollack print on the wall behind him with a sudden crash of shattering glass.
Peter watched the images on the silent television screen change, saw the night before, and himself swinging from building to building, a thin fragment of flitting black silhouetted against the solid red-orange block of flames…
Tony’s eyes narrowed, and he moved.  His knees sunk into the couch on either side of Steve’s hips, and he took the blonde’s strong-jawed face in both hands to kiss him from an up-angle.
Harry started to shrug, broke off as the first preparatory tensing flared across the nerves of his chest, and settled for an apologetic smile.
“So…”  Lt. Farrell took out a cigarette and lit it with a match, “-who do you think burned out the Green Goblin?”
Steve swallowed around him, and Tony shut his eyes entirely, leaning his head back against the steam-wet tile.
Tony tore out the thick-wired red and black leads with a sob, and swore, rubbing his face with the metal fingers of the one hand he could move.
…Which worked fine, until his enemy dived sideways with both red-gloved hands outstretched, and grabbed something in the tangle of blankets trailing off the side of the bed.
Tony poured his coffee, and the underside of the gold band on his finger clinked quietly against the ceramic mug’s handle.
There was a sudden flash in the smoggy reek behind them, then half a heartbeat later a deep, shattering boom, and a bone-jarring shockwave.
He could hear the alien hum of computer banks on one hand, and the subtler, organic whirring of insects, sealed within pristine cages of Plexiglas and tightly-woven wire mesh.  They sounded very close, like the insects were staying in their enclosures voluntarily.  …Maybe they
Tony got up, fished his drafting notebook and some pencils out of the top drawer of a tan metal filing cabinet, and handed them over.
Tony paused, and glanced up quickly before looking back down into the workings of her arm and nodding.
Steve came back in with cups of hot chocolate, and handed them each one.  He remained standing in the doorway afterwards, pretty well blocking it.
“‘Conflict’, huh?”  Tony said, dryly.  “-It’s… basically a pissing match with the Red Chinese that got away from us, though you’d never guess that from what the newspapers print.  Here, just- -listen.”  Tony pressed ’D-1-PLAY’.
Tony stopped beside the stove, put a hand around the back of Steve’s neck, and kissed him firmly, eyes shut.
“Ah… yeah,” Tony admitted, “-but you didn’t give up, and you looked great doing it,” he assured him.
War Machine angled in for a touch-down beside the entrance to the mall, and noticed something strange on his radar.  Lots of blips converging in on his position, that was to be expected…  but also two moving away terribly, terribly fast.  And with Iron Man down for maintenance and Warbird within sight and coming in -towards- him, there were only two players left in this game that could -move- that fast.
“No, all of you.  Take this list, and run down to the ‘Pho Tigers Garden’.  It’s that place on- -Peter, you know.”
The battered silver-gray suit sat up with a deep whine of protesting servos, and heaved itself up out of the concrete and asphalt crater.  War Machine stood up fully, sending a slight tremor through the ground at their feet, and rising to more than two feet above the other two.  A slight rattle of broken cement and gravel landed around War Machine’s blocky gray boots, knocked loose from the chinks of his armor by the motion.
“Well, it’d be fun to see Iron Man get his can kicked, but the Goblin’s fuckin’ dangerous, ya know?”  The thug admitted, with a grin that showed a gleam of gold on the right hand side.
A firing order and hasty cross-chatter about resisting arrest and probable escape trajectories assaulted his ears.  Something exploded down and to the left of him…  and in two more heartbeats, he was well out of range.
