“I took advantage of you! You just looked so good and I was gone enough that I was going to let myself have this one selfish thing. It was stupid and wrong of me.”
Bucky was his only real friend, but he never hung out with Bucky at school. In fact, he never even acknowledged Bucky existed outside of the privacy of their homes and the occasional trip into Manhattan. When they went to Manhattan, he could leave his Steve Rogers Dumpster Fire life behind and live his Steve Rogers Potential Artist life. Bucky didn’t mind being a secret. At least Steve was pretty sure.
to Steve, because they did stupid, cheesy stuff like that now. Only when he’d gotten there, Steve wasn’t anywhere to be found. Luckily, Tony had decided he should pee before he went back to work, or he wouldn’t have found
Tony tried not to beam at the praise. Sure, he was complimented and told he was brilliant constantly. But this—Bruce,
Features my cat OCs. Riley, Champ, and Crack (who does not appear in this, tragically) creating inconveniences for Steve and Tony's morning cuddles.
Their relationship, once again, was thriving. They weren’t arguing. They were on the same(ish) sleep schedule. They had sex just for the sake of having sex—no more using it as a way to make up after a big fight. Tony was over the moon.
“It’s against policy,” Steve said. Tony’s stomach dropped. A nice letdown. Short, sweet. Tony understood that. It was the rules of whatever contract Steve had signed.
“Slow your roll,” Tony said. He got back into bed and picked up the remote, flicking on Netflix. “Put your shit in the laundry basket while I pick something.”
At this, Dum-E rolled quickly away, towards one of Tony’s many desks. This one didn’t have gadgets or tools on it. This one had a few framed pictures--one on their wedding day, a newspaper clipping after the battle of New York with the whole team, a photo of them holding Peter the day he was born--Tony’s personal computer (which had Solitaire installed on it, but he “didn’t use it”), and the baby monitor. Dum-E pointed at the little screen that showed a direct video feed of Tony in the rocking chair where they fed Peter.
The Avengers Initiative as a whole is very proud to support The Substance Dependence and Addiction Treatment Center at Stark Mansion.
“You're uncharacteristically non hyper verbal,” Pepper noted eight minutes into their 50 minute hour.
“And where are you coming from?” Tony asked. He liked bantering with dream Steve. It felt natural. As if he were really here.
“You want me to eat more vegetables?” Steve shouted. He reached into the bowl of green beans and shoving an entire handful into his mouth. “Happy?” he spoke through his full mouth.
“JARVIS sent me up here,” Bruce said, slightly out of breath. “Said it was emergencies. Tony… I’m really bad with—is that Steve?”
“No. Real Steve is in Wakanda. You’re dream Steve. I get to be with dream Steve while real Steve is off brooding over his long lost bestie.”
“Sure,” he said, even though his entire being was screaming at him to just disconnect the damn webcam and forget this happened.
Peter didn’t drink or smoke so Toni had taken to spending a lot of time with him. He wouldn’t question why she wasn’t doing anything of the sort because he’d probably assume she was doing it out of respect for him.
I don't know if I'm going to still keep writing this? There aren't a lot of comments and, idk, I feel like there's been depleted interest since the first chapter?
I have realized that not everyone has the resources that I do. Whether the roadblock is money, toxic interpersonal relationships, or something else, there is a clear lack of support for those not necessarily “well-off”
Steve licked his lips and looked down. Tony could notice a thinking face when he saw one. Steve was actually considering it. Holy shit, that had been a shot in the dark.
“Didn’t mean to be rude,” the man said. “You’re bleeding on my sidewalk so I should bring you in and clean you up. That’s what I meant to say.”
@cptsteverogers: Brush your teeth. I’ll be in with the coffee in a minute. Be prepared to drink it cold, though. I’m feeling distracting.
Steve sucked in a breath and Tony tensed. “Ex,” he said after way too long. “That’s… what we are. What you are to me. What I am to you.”
“Of course I meant it. Now kiss me. And I’m counting this one as our first kiss, not the other one, because I want to remember every part of our first kiss and I don’t remember every part of our last kiss so this is our official first kiss when people ask us years in the future about how we got together.”
“We’re all worried about you, hon,” Tony said, rubbing his hand along Steve’s back. That much was true. After the incident, when Steve was off hiding or punching things, the team had sat him down to discuss Steve’s condition. The conversation had gone in circles for almost forty-five minutes before Tony gave up and came to bed.
Things had been going well between the two. They were happy and Tony, for the first time in any of his relationships, took Steve’s word for things. Instead of ignoring or deflecting the tender
“So why'd you quit the squad?” Natasha asked, inhaling deeply before passing the joint to Toni. Toni took a drag and passed it over to Steve.
“How about we say they went in with two legs and left with one,” Tony tried. Steve could see how much pain it cause Tony to actually have to say it. “And they have a very enhanced and ingenious serum in their body that heals most wounds, but it can’t grow back limbs.” A tear fell out of the corner of Tony’s eye. “I found it and I brought it back but it was too late. The stump--” his voice caught. “It had already started healed over.”
That was an option? Tony had to think. He couldn’t think. He brain was in his cock, which was currently throbbing and wanting nothing more than to be able to feel the release of orgasm. “I… y—you choose,” Tony finally stuttered out.
“Steve, you’re getting worse.” He was tired of dancing around the subject, of trying to get Steve to work through his problems on his own or with nothing more than subtle guidance. “You act insane half the time and the other half you sulk around. If I hadn’t forced you to get up and come to dinner with me tonight, it would have marked six days since you’d even left our room.
Steve knew he deserved it. Of course he did. He’d attempted to take his own life for some foolish reason even he couldn’t pin down. Maybe because it was an option he didn’t have before. Things with Tony had been so perfect. Maybe he wanted to end his life on a high note before the inevitable failing of their relationship.
“Go back to bed. I’ll be there in two minutes. As it stands, I can still hold him for one hundred and five seconds and still have time to make it back.”
Steve cracked an eye open. “From Wakanda,” he said, his voice sounding more awake than it had a few moments before.
Steve smiled, a tiny thing tugging up the corners of his lips. “Do you remember what happened in between you sitting down and that?”
Steve nodded. It was nice, not having to be awake during surgery. Or, what he figured had been a surgery, considering they didn’t send him to the hospital for much else these days.
It would be his fault. He would have killed Captain America. His childhood hero and the love of his life.
Tony threw the wrench down on the table and turned around. From where Steve stood on the other side of the glass, he wouldn’t be able to see into the workshop. Tony, on the other hand, had a perfect view of a smartly dressed pinnacle of human perfection.
“That,” Tony managed. “That,” he gasped again. Yes, that was what he wanted. He wanted to watch Steve finger himself. He wanted Steve to tell him how much he wanted it. He
Huh. Tony hadn’t thought about that. At all. He just assumed that Steve went along with it because he was too polite not to. Now it almost sounded like Steve wanted it.
“Well, it seems that you’re seventeen weeks along. Your symptoms have evolved the way that they should. Your due date is July 17th,” Dr. Cho read off a clipboard. “You seem to be in perfect health. Keep going the way you’re going and you will have a very healthy baby.”
Steve awoke to the incessant beeping of a heart monitor. He’s not sure what they were pumping into his veins, but it was enough to sedate him and that was impressive.
“What did I tell him about sleeping with Peter in his arms?” Steve asked Dum-E, though he knew Dum-E wouldn’t be able to respond. Instead, he shook the claw which Steve took to mean
Tony clenched his eyes shut. “Rogers. Don’t act like you thought I was going to call you and beg you to come back.” Except he knew that Steve thought that. What’s more, he knew Steve was right for thinking that. Tony had been on the brink of doing it every night—fear for the possibility of Steve saying no was the only thing keeping him from doing so.
“Antonio ordered in English,” Alessandro said with his thick accent. “We all know how much you like when he does it in Italian.”
Steve was close, he felt the slow pull of his orgasm approaching. He led Tony’s hand to his cock. Tony may have been awkward about the experience up until this point, but it seemed as if he was adept at handjobs, and it wasn’t long until Steve was coming in thin strips up and down Tony’s chest.
Steve felt so good. Every move Tony made surged up along his back as a hot, electric thrill, teasing spikes of compulsive pleasure into every muscle.
“We try to keep an eye on everyone – especially when they first arrive” Belle explained, without missing a beat. “Duty of care, and all that.”
Ultimately, Zemo didn’t win because Steve tried to plan, or failed to plan... It all fell apart because Steve had tried to control

“We’re not here to start trouble, Wesley,” Tony assured him, following Steve at a more leisurely pace. “We’ve just got a few perfectly routine questions, about an investigation that doesn’t have to concern you, and if you answer them like a reasonable person, then we’ll be on our way and you’ll never have to think about either of us again, okay?”
And he knew he couldn’t go in cold. He couldn’t spontaneously apologise for a general feeling in his gut, without really knowing how Tony felt, when Tony had already said they should just ignore it and move on – but, maybe if Tony yelled at him, he could actually just apologise…for everything…
don’t want to ruin what we have, and end up disappointing someone I actually like, when I don’t really have anything to offer you,” he said, more pointedly. “When I know that everything is so hard for you right now, and you’ve been through so much, and I don’t have any answers and… I just don’t want to be something that makes it all more complicated and… worse. That’s all.”
He and Steve had been back to Anni-Vara twice since their mission at The Facility, both times related to the ongoing investigation. And anything related to
There was a brief curl of embarrassment, acknowledging that it was probably because the files were falling into their natural position - that Howard wasn’t the reason this one was already on the top of the stack… But Steve’s anger was hot enough to swallow it up, burning it into fragments that became a part of his fury.
And that had been out of place in the forties too, by the way. Steve’s few attempts to explain that point of view had been met by every reaction from baffled amusement to borderline outrage. People who assumed he was trying to excuse infidelity, when he was actually trying to explain that he’d remain faithful even if he
they were looking at him, awed and interested and animated, like they were seeing some rare, exotic creature for the very first time…
The fact that he didn’t know what a life with Steve would look like, if he was up to it, if there was any way he could make Steve happy…
this would be better in the long run. He now had actual, infallible proof that his approach in this timeline was so much better. He could finally
Hey all - I apologise if this isn't the correct fandom etiquette (and do feel free to let me know, if that's the case) But I'm told that subscribers to this fic wouldn't necessarily get a notification if it became a series, and another fic was added...
A fierce, searing pleasure rushed up through him, a wave of relief surging up from the small of his back, thousands of white-hot sparks shattering through his hips. Steve lost himself for a second, the world disappearing into the blinding intensity of this sensation-
Steve furrowed his brows and gave Tony a bewildered look, speaking slowly. "It's oatmeal." Tony was a genius, he should know that.
Steve grinned at the ground before he turned to face Iron Man. His amusement fell away when he caught sight of the long fresh cut trailing right beneath Tony’s eye, bruise already forming along his cheek bone. Steve reached out and tipped Tony’s face so he could get a better look. “I don’t know how you can get injured when you’re encased in metal. How deep is the cut anyway?”
When he arrived back, he let his body fall into the seat next to Steve, shooting him an infectious smile as he placed his hand over Steve’s where it rested on their joined arm rests.
Once they were secure in their own rental car, following close behind Mattias as he led them to the restaurant of his choosing, Steve spoke, hands gripped tightly on the wheel, “What are you thinking Tony?”
Iron Man’s repulsors fired off behind Steve, non-stop even as Steve looped his arm around Tony’s suit so they could take off, “Tony’s going to shut them down. Just hold them off as much as possible, focus on clearing the streets, getting the civilians to shelter while we get this done.”
“No, we’re playing Blindfolded Mario Kart which you did not invent.” The music for Cheep Cheep Beach began to play, the marimbas jingling. Three steady beeps and they were off.
If you're reading these, please comment. I'm working really hard on them and staying diligent with writing them every day, and I feel like I'm not getting any response.
“Just above the knee,” Tony whispered. “While you were asleep, I’ve been doing my research. I’ve invested in a few of advanced prostheses companies. I’ve also sent some of my ideas to them.”
On my morning run today I saw a mama pigeon help a one-legged baby pigeon out of the street. How can people call such wonderful creatures “rats with wings”?
“You’re not doing much to disprove that by throwing a temper tantrum over having to eat vegetables with dinner.”
He hit the gas and sped out of the cemetery, not once looking in the review mirror at what—and who—he was leaving behind.
“Tony.” Tony kneeled in front of Steve, taking one of the injured feet in his hand. Steve hissed when Tony’s finger brushed against one of the deeper cuts. “Sorry,” he mumbled. “You need stitches.”
The garage door slid into place behind him. Mounting the bike, he took off down the street. Sprinklers kept lawns green and grandchildren ran around lawns with dogs. Longing knotted in his stomach; why could he be five and jumping through sprinklers again?
On her way back to Steve’s, she pulled over and threw up in someone’s lawn. She felt bad for the family that would walk out later that day and see a mashed up pile of regurgitated food but she couldn’t be bothered to care. Besides, it wasn’t her fault. It was the stupid parasite growing inside of her.
True to the form of high school students, by second period there were several rumors circulating about Steve's black eye.
A few years back, Steve had convinced Tony to finally start taking his medication. It had made a world of difference. Their relationship thrived.
And Steve didn’t even know if it was anything to do with sex, and he didn’t know if it had anything to do with the serum – although, he had to guess the serum wasn’t
By then, Tony’s little networking tour had taken them to sleek looking bar – all silver and black, with low couches and coffee tables, and a grand piano that no one was playing. Steve had watched Tony effortlessly engage another stranger in a conversation, almost as soon as they arrived, and realised that it really wasn’t necessary for him to stand awkwardly at the back of it. He wasn’t even sure that Tony had noticed him wander over to the bar. He could probably leave the room altogether and it wouldn’t matter, he thought, somewhat bitterly…
It was the sympathy in it. Something so different to the voice that Tony usually used around him – so much so that it almost didn’t sound like him.
by the idea of making Tony happy, and spending all those years with him in a much better world - and all the things he never would have had the chance to do, if they’d actually beaten Thanos the first time.
And then he glanced down at Tony, who was looking up at him with a playful smile… And he remembered.
Partly because… well, yes, sort of. More than, even. Steve had asked him to share a far deeper commitment - and Tony had said yes.
And from the other end of the table, loud enough that everyone could hear it, Wanda gave a derisory snort.
He dug his fingertips hard into Steve’s thighs as he forced his cock deeper, until he could feel Steve grinding up against the back of his throat.
understood what the other was thinking, or they had made each other feel better. They’d never spent an hour shouting at each other about all the things they agreed on, all the principles and priorities they shared… those must’ve seemed obvious, maybe… or maybe it was never the point of the conversation they were having…
The sudden shift in his perception, the immediate burden of responsibility, the overwhelming self-recrimination as he recognised how wrong he’d gotten it so far… The fresh realisation of how very much he wanted this thing, now that there was the slightest chance that he could have it.
“So, are you going to see him again?” Nat questioned, as Steve was putting his food into the microwave. And, instinctively Steve knew – if he said yes, she’d want to know
need to be able to get through the third floor” He cut in “You need to take a drug, to be able to deal with the atmosphere in there or whatever it is, right?” But she was already nodding, and reaching into a pocket on the inside of her coat.
“Because their listed office is a few blocks from the Tower, and Steve would’ve walked…” Tony mused out loud, the details coming together faster than he could explain them.
“But, I don’t know, it’s still probably better if I keep it to as few people as possible.” Tony shrugged – which wasn’t a lie, either. “Especially if he’s going to just stand there-”
The perfect, purifying pain of it, slicing through every layer of resistance in Steve’s body, cutting him open-
There might even have been a few minutes in the middle there where Steve really was just taking an afternoon to himself, thinking about nothing deeper than the alien planet he was exploring-
thing I know right now is how much I want this – and I don’t want to fuck up again, just because I wanted it so much…”
isn’t about me wanting to control other people - it really isn’t,” Steve assured him. “I don’t want to be part of any team with the power to dictate policy to other people, I don’t want to make the world work a certain way… it’s just that I don’t want to give anyone power over us, either. And I do want to be able to intervene, to stand up for
In that one kiss, Steve could feel everything he’d spent the last few weeks trying to explain, every nameless longing that he’d ever thought of as part of this… Everything he wanted tonight to be.
And, for whatever reason, he was starting to think that maybe he could stop, for just a moment. Just for lunch.
?” Pepper exclaimed – and Tony outright ignored her. He was too busy searching for Bucky’s number. He didn’t even know if she carried on yelling at him while he listened to that dial tone…
“Oh Steve, I love you,” he gasped, just because he liked saying it. He felt Steve’s lips brush over his skin when he whispered Tony’s name, dragging his palms over Tony’s sides as he moved lower down Tony’s body. He ran the flat of his tongue over Tony’s nipple, sparking an electric shock that ran through his ribs, leaving a trail of fizzing sensitivity in his wake. Whimpering, Tony made a subconscious attempt to wriggle further up the bed, lifting his hips as Steve slowly worked his way down over Tony’s stomach. His fingers threaded roughly though Steve’s hair, tugging at it – eliciting a needy little moan that Tony took a special note of-
you thought, you know, you didn’t want Bucky to end up in a Wakandan prison, and all that… And then my response is
been angry at Tony, for what he did to Bucky. Even though he had felt so sorry for Tony, even though he knew Tony wasn’t in his right mind when he did it, even though he felt so much guilt for leading them there in the first place… There had still been nights – moments, really – when Steve thought about what would’ve happened if one of Tony’s shots had hit. When he’d wondered, a bit too bitterly, if Tony would’ve been sorry for it. If Tony would’ve accepted that he’d done something awful in a fit of rage.
That this might all be the result of the inhibited intoxication that was still flowing through him… A feeling that had only grown stronger since Steve had turned up, increasing at about the same rate as Tony was losing himself. Scientifically speaking, it was highly likely that Tony was under the influence of something right now, that his choices and thought processes were all being influenced by that…
“But would it change your mind about anything?” Tony went on, fluidly “To find that the people of Anni Vara
…Like, for example, how he never mentioned any relationships with men in his ‘salacious past’. Not that Steve cared, obviously, but just as a random example of things that he apparently didn’t know about Tony-
And that meant whatever slim chance there was of Steve sympathising with him, or trying to help him, had just gone up in smoke.
His arms were already reaching out towards him, his hands curling themselves into fists as a last-ditch attempt to resist the temptation…
“Yeah, but I didn’t want to ruin the moment,” Peter mumbled, awkwardly gesturing between Steve and Tony, apparently not as confident in his revenge mission now that he’d actually enacted it on a super soldier.
turned you in, or failed to have your back, you still didn’t stop to think you could trust me. But nothing you ever did would make people pause, for even a second, to think maybe I might have a point. That it might be worth
“Steve…” Tony heard himself whisper softly, his body leaning forward of its own accord, responding to that basic, physical pull towards him
“The chance to provide the world with an endless source of clean energy,” Nick announced, proudly. Like he was simply assuming the reaction that Tony would have to an offer like that-
seen it… and he’d mistaken it for anger, and a sense of injustice, and he’d waited for it to pass. He’d been waiting until Tony was less annoyed, thinking it’d all be easier then… Not realising it could only ever mean that Tony had stopped bothering to show him…
But, eventually, the anxiety of hiding in the bedroom was as bad as the anxiety of sitting in the living room, so Tony accepted that they’d just have to be early for a daily briefing, for the first time in his life.
But now he realised that they were here for a reason. That they had a cover story to maintain… that he really
Century social events that Steve was regularly pressured into, ‘galas’ were amongst his least favourite. Everyone had always seemed too preoccupied with how they looked, or who they were networking with, or who they were seen by, to actually have fun. Everything seemed too contrived, too controlled… too judgemental.
for health, richer and better. No one wants to deal with a debilitating illness or a family disaster, no one
It seemed such a small conclusion to draw from such an overwhelming crisis of confidence; such a minor action to mark such a big revelation… Even Steve didn’t recognise the significance of it, at the time.
This moment, standing mute and frozen in the face of an angry monologue, that knowledge that he had to control his reaction, that Captain America couldn’t have an unreasonable reaction and therefore couldn’t let himself react, at all, just in case.
“No sir, I don’t think there’s any danger of that,” JARVIS soothed. “He’s barely stirred, and has now fallen into a deep sleep. If I were pushed to make an estimate, I would say he’ll be asleep for the remainder of the night.”
tell us exactly what this place was… but when you first walk in, you don’t get that yet, and you’re just thinking that it’s kinda… different sex and drugs to what you were expecting?”
Tony looked up, right at Steve. Steve’s ribs clenched with a delighted shock as their eyes met, and then melted along with the rest of him when Tony smiled.
“Steve…” fell over his lips, his voice dazed and distant. And then he felt the bed shift beneath him, opening his eyes to see Steve looking over him…
. A physical effect, a phycological effect, possibly even a supernatural effect – a direct reaction to whatever was in Steve’s blood, and whatever physical link they shared. And that could be a calming effect, or a euphoric effect, or a focusing effect-

He allowed himself two seconds to centre himself, before he went to retrieve his bag of supplies. He slung it over his shoulder before he went back to Gary, scoping him up bridal style and carrying him back up towards the main entrance. Steve left him slumped against the wall just out of sight of the door-
Unfortunately, Bucky was trying to work this out as he was already saying it - so, he was halfway through it when he realised that what he really meant was,
At first, Steve simply assumed that Bucky was calling him a bad friend, and he felt all the unprocessed pain that came with that-
Meeting Tony had offered him an alternative to being lost and lonely, made him believe that there might be something
He really didn’t know why this whole thing bothered him so much. He’d tried to analyse his reaction, but his thoughts simply ran away from him in a thousand different directions, bouncing off of the inside of his mind like this goddamn ball. He didn’t even know what to
“...But if you’ve really managed to isolate that central equation - if you’re telling me this has actually been successfully tested millions of times…” Tony mused, “that would mean you’d essential cracked the secret of transposing space between two non-consecutive points - that would open up a whole new realm of possibility for-”
And then he saw Tony bite his bottom lip, and was briefly distracted by how much he wanted to kiss him again…
As one minute stretched into two, and then three, Steve’s mind became preoccupied by all the things he was trying
Steve shook the image away, and looked back at the computer, firmly asking himself if there was anything else he needed to do before he left. And his eyes fell on a little yellow post-it, cello-taped to the edge of the computer monitor. The word PASSWORD, and the word LOG IN, and the word SAVE, all written in a familiar, boxy handwriting… and next to each of them, a little pattern of interlocking squares.
Not that his thoughts cleared much, now that they were out of there… But there was at least the feeling that it wasn’t
get their head around a new idea, or update their ideas, or consider a unique set of circumstances, if they never felt safe enough to just ask what the hell was going on…
When he finally tried to lift his head, Tony found that everything was pleasantly heavy, the world still clouded by a heady purple mist. It took him a moment to blink through it, and when he did, he found Steve gazing down on him, looking every bit as overwhelmed as Tony felt. There was a warm stirring in the pit of Tony’s stomach, as ran his eyes over Steve’s beautiful, broad chest…
So, Steve began to flex his wrists against the restraints, pushing his arms out as subtly as he could…
kill them, you know? So, being a vampire is a bit like that. I’m not going to instantly turn to dust, like in the movies. But it’s not exactly a good idea…”
And then stared at the pinkish patch that had appeared on his forearm, and tried to force some feeling of regret. Like gabbing at a tooth you’re worried is loose – trying to make this revelation stronger by testing it, throwing every potential doubt at it.
“Yeah, everything’s fine,” Tony replied automatically, “and I’m sorry to call so late, but something’s come up, something important, and I’m going to need a ride.”
And then, like he’d just remembered that he was allowed to, Tony leaned over and kissed him very softly on the forehead.
“To ask if I want to work with SHIELD on the Tesseract Project,” Tony announced, glancing up at Steve to watch that bombshell land…
“Please,” Tony whispered again, arching up into Steve’s touch, his voice trembling as little electric shivers broke up though his hips-
There was an audible intake of breath all around him. As Clint struggled to pull his arguments into words, Thor cast Bucky a loaded glance.
.” Steve warned him, in an exasperated-but-affectionate voice. Then he turned back to the woman. “Sorry, do you mind just getting someone to help her, please?”
offered, and tried to convince himself that Steve was at least sorry about that much - that he at least felt bad for the professional disrespect towards a team mate, and that he wouldn’t do it again.
Steve decided then and there to give himself that night, to let himself just relax into Tony’s arm around him. He wouldn’t think about how he shouldn’t and he wouldn’t think about what his plans we’re for the entire situation. All of that could wait till tomorrow.
Steve breaths in and out, calming breaths to prevent himself from hyperventilating. He knows from experience that once he starts that, its hard to come back.
It used to bother him more, he mused, early on in their friendship, when Tony would talk at him, throwing out more technical jargon than Steve could rightly be expected to follow and then starring expectantly at Steve when he had no answer. The silence had always been fragile then, both still learning how to behave so that the moment wouldn’t shatter, forcing them to pick up the pieces and try again another time.
Tony’s eyes remained knitted in concern as they swept over Steve’s bandage covered body. He began to ramble again, bouncing on his toes as if the energy in his body was attempting to escape in any way possible, “You know, though I like getting to be the hero I think I’d prefer if you didn’t make yourself the damsel in distress in those scenarios because, you know, my ticker,” he tapped a hand over his chest, “is still fragile sometimes and the added stress of knowing an entire nation will hate you if you don’t manage to rescue their golden child is probably too much for it.” Tony began tugging at Steve’s blankets, pulling them up to further cover his body as he muttered, mostly under his breath, “also, maybe I’d really miss you so…”
Steve had no idea what he was supposed to do now. Was he supposed to tell Tony? That didn’t seem like the thing to do, not when he didn’t even know how Tony felt.
Natasha cut him off, “could have died. I know, we were there Steve. I know it’s different for you, but he’s fine. He’s not dead, he’s down in his workshop brooding over the fact that you haven’t spoken to him in over a week.” She poked his chest, smirking for a moment before her face sobered “ Whether you like it or not Steve, Tony made a call that you were unwilling to make, he saved everyone before it got out of hand. It sucks and it hurts but it’s in the past and it’s up to you whether you want to stay there with it or move on.”
Nothing came up for almost twenty minutes longer. It was twenty minutes spent, leg cramping where he was shot, eyes restless as they watched the scans watching the water. Steve felt himself slipping, felt cracks opening up, allowing his fears to creep in one at a time. His body began to twitch with every sound Clint or Natasha made, hands clenching and relaxing non-stop. He was falling apart and he knew it, body breaking into a cold sweat.
Its not terrible. Being here next to Tony isn't as weird as he thought it might be. They aren't friends but maybe that doesn't matter. Steve soaks in the night and the quiet and the feeling of an alive body next to his. If there's one thing Tony is, it's alive. Even now when he says nothing every part of him is thrumming with it. Its there in the way his fingers tap against the railing and the way his eyes flick around. Its there in every breath he takes and in the way his lips are quirked like he's always in on some private joke. Tony is alive in a way that Steve very rarely see's in people, In a way that he's pretty sure is systematically removed the older a person gets. He's alive in a way that Steve wishes he could feel.
and Clint threw his communicator against the furthest wall when all they managed to produce was more crackling static to add to the cacophony of explosions they could hear in the furthest parts of the station.
Often Steve found that he definitely didn’t want Tony to find out, he would get into his own head and think about it for too long, dissecting every detail. He’d be hit with all the reasons he couldn’t say anything, reasons he’d call cliché if he weren’t the one in the situation. From the strain put on their friendship, a friendship Steve just wasn’t ready to risk, to the fact that Tony has never shown much interest in him, Steve would definitely know if he had. Maybe, if the casual flirting wasn’t extended to everyone, or if Tony didn’t still bring home different girls from time to time, maybe then Steve would be willing to gamble, but it was and he did and Steve wouldn’t.
“And I told you that I’m working on a way to fix that, but in the mean time you need to cover your head before someone knocks you into next week. Then where will we be?”
Natasha stopped a few feet away and gave him a thorough once over. He didn’t know what it was she saw, but whatever it was, it had her whipping out her phone to shoot off a text. The phone was gone as fast as it appeared. “Let’s spar.”
Happy walked into the room “Sorry boss, you know how traffic is.”He waved at Steve “Captain, glad to see you made it back safe. Boss was bouncing off the walls, he—“ Tony made a slicing motion with his hand and the bubbling feeling came back full force. Happy just grinned and set the food down on the table “Glad to see you’re back” he turned to face Tony “Will that be all?”
Well, no, that wasn’t true. That award would have to go to teaming up with the Red Skull and going dark side, which, he didn’t want to think about ever again.
ringing loud and clear that he and Clint began desperately attempting to get their communicators to connect with headquarters, if only for a moment.
Sharon moved her hand to Steve’s and squeezed the warmth on her face marginally less than it previously had been. “We’re good.”
Tony had been too fast for him then, was still fast, head in the future speeding ahead of Steve, off and into the distance while Steve scrambled to keep up, make up for lost time and try not get left behind.
Tony was his friend, his best friend even, but even he knew that it wasn’t considered normal to sit with one’s friend, practically holding hands. Friends didn’t run their thumbs over their friends bottom lip, split or not, as if it were nothing.
After they were friends, it still never bothered him much beyond the fact that Steve didn’t like the risk Tony put himself in. He worried sometimes, that Tony wasn’t settling for anyone, that he was just picking out a one or two night fling. He wanted him to be happy, like he was with Pepper, and Steve just couldn’t see Tony ever being happy with any of the girls he brought home. He never thought that those girls were ever going to make him smile the way he should smile, bright and soft and so full of promises.
He passed the family off to Natasha before he took a running start, jumping on the hood of a car to propel himself up to get a hold of one of the lower flying hunks of metal. His momentum allowed him to slam it into the ground, shield descending in the next moment. The glowing blue lights flickered and then went out.
He and Clint made it through five, in hindsight, suspiciously quiet days monitoring the vastness of space all around them from the comfort of their Shield issued bunks, eating their Shield issued rations, before things turned upside down.
With that they were off. Natasha didn’t take it easy on him, she came at him right, left, sideways, under and over. Where Steve was all force, Natasha was fine toned agility and skill. It made for a fairly intense sparring session that ended with Steve pinned to the mat far more than usual.
The women let go of his arm and smiled “I know you’re leaving but-“ She thrust out her hand. “ I’m Agent Sharon Carter. You knew my aunt.”
It snapped, it was the only way to describe the feeling. All at once, everything clumping together, distorting and then fracturing.
left. “You know, it was me who broke the coffee table, not Hulk. And I’m the one who started that fire in the bathroom, I don’t know how it happened, but Natasha’s hair dryer was never the same. Spider-Mans suit being pink that one time, also me, and I’ve had a dog in my quarters for the past two weeks now. A lab pup I found when that squid thing attacked downtown, he constantly smells like Pizza and I’m not sure why, because I haven’t fed him any and I’ve bathed him twice.”
At the end, Tony shot up out of his chair, gave one final clap and started tugging Steve up. “I’m happy that I’ve managed to miss as many of these as I have. That was dreadful. Let’s not do this again, I won’t call you, you don’t call me.”
Steve frowned, continued on his way into the kitchen. When he was behind the counter he gave her another considering look. He cleared his throat quietly and smiled at her when she turned startled eyes on him “Good morning”
Then, then Tony was by him trying to help set the table and make conversation and all Steve could think about was that he had a sketchbook full of mini Tony’s hidden away in his bed side drawer because no matter how long he’d stood with the book poised over the trash can, he couldn’t bring himself to throw it out.
Steve knew what it was; he could recognize the jealousy clawing at his insides. He didn’t want those women hanging off of Tony, he didn’t want Tony to settle down with any of them. Steve hadn’t even got the chance to – he wanted to be the one who Tony wrapped his arms around, the one who he stumbled down the hall with late at night. Not just one night, he wanted, Steve wanted – Rule number three: Tony would never know.
Steve caught the hint of a full blown, toothy smile before Steve was once again staring into the cold blue stare of Iron Mans helmet. “Let’s do this Cap.”
Steve shook his head in fond exasperation and watched Tony work on his phone. When a few minutes had passed he placed his hand on Tony’s arm to regain his attention. “Thank you for finding us. I don’t think Natasha was doing too well there towards the end.”
Steve’s nose wrinkled as he forced his eyes back down to his drawing only to see Tony drawn, back turned to him with a smile thrown over his shoulder and a patch of skin at his back where his shirt was ridden up. “Oh.”
He’d managed three weeks without incident due mainly to Tony being away for business in Japan. The tower was a lot quieter without Tony there and Steve found that he missed the other man despite everything going on.
When all was said and done, the tour finally brought to a close, Mattias insisted that they both join him and a few other higher ups for dinner, their treat, which Tony accepted even as Steve covertly jabbed him in the side.
. Clint wiped his nose with his sleeve, leaving a trail of blood along his cheek, “Natasha is going to kill me. Then she’s going to tell Bobbi and she’ll kill me too. I’ll be dead three times over by next week.”
He feels instantly wary, a norm when he's around Tony. They aren't hostile with each other as they were when they first met. Its more of a shaky truce that neither seems willing to break or push forward into friendship. No, he and Tony Stark are definitely not friends.
No matter how much he told himself not to indulge Tony, Steve couldn’t help the smile that worked its way free when Tony tapped,
Steve spun Tony dutifully and then pulled him back in closer than he had been, closer than he meant to. He wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist tightly, in for a penny in for a pound and all. Tony didn’t appear to mind how close Steve held him, barely seemed to notice, “They’re going to break through eventually, and then we’ll be hard pressed to get out of here without chase and even harder pressed to get to the supply.”
Sure, he liked being around Tony. He liked hanging out with him when he could, but that was because they were best friends. Tony made him happy and warm and when he was with him he felt like he could really belong in this new world. He was smart and funny and, his brain helpfully supplied, beautiful.
Natasha frowned "You can't help the way you feel Steve. Remember that. She will be hurt but that is not something you can help because she also can’t help the way she feels. You have to be brave enough to do the right thing now because it’s not going to get any easier the longer you wait."
Steve swore he felt his heart skip once, twice, before it picked up speed, keeping him awake when moments before Steve was sure the soothing feel of Tony’s fingers working gently over his skin would lull him to sleep. What was Tony—“I’m glad it was me instead”, he blurted.
Steve grinned back and let the walls crumble around him for now. He'd get around to fixing them later. "I'm glad you like it. Go sit and eat."
Steve placed his hand over his stomach and gave it a sympathetic pat. “Okay” It was time to start his day apparently.
Tony’s full attention was on him in an instant. He leaned in, hand resting on Steve’s knee, fingers pressed lightly into his inseam in the most distracting way. “Steve, very important decision you have coming up. I would just like you to remember that I’m your best friend, you know me. If I’m forced to watch two plus hours of tech and science I will have no choice but to nitpick. You don’t want that, I don’t want that. It’ll ruin the entire night, Natasha might maim me.”
“Okay, Bruce, we’re gonna need you to get angry.” Bruce nodded, already turning green in the face. Steve turned his attention to Natasha and Clint “Black Widow and Hawkeye, I want you to head over in the Quinjet.” They both turned and climbed back on board, engines coming to life almost before Steve had opened his mouth again “Thor, lead Hulk to the site and Iron Man, give me a lift?”
She smirked and stood up “don’t you forget it.” She looked around, her smirk dropped from her face “I should go, this would work better if I left”
The only one who seemed to be taking the early morning rousing fairly well was Thor, sitting and watching Tony with rapt attention, nodding his head every now and then to show that he was indeed following.
There was a large gap between Steve’s brain and his mouth. Steve was thinking only with his cock and at that moment he wanted it in Tony’s mouth.
He was broken from his thoughts when he heard the door open to admit Rhodey, using the chair he so hated. “That’s how you wish it happened.” It wasn’t a question. Tony, frowning, switched off the Binaurally Augmented Retro Framing device, throwing the glasses on the table. The vision of Steve sitting at a desk writing the letter fell away.
“Sarah Maria Stark-Rogers.” Steve threatened. “We talked about this. James is your brother and he is family.” He got down on one knee to be at Sarah’s height. “Baby,” he said, much softer. He cupped her face with his hand. “I know it’s hard having a new baby in the house. I know it’s hard that you have to share your Daddy and me.” Sarah looked down, ashamed. “You know that we still love you with all of our hearts.”
“May I?” he asked. “I’ve always wondered what it was like. You know, being on the other side of it.”
Tony, apparently, finally decided to let go, because suddenly he started to thrust up into Steve, meeting him in the middle. He came with a moan, his eyes rolling back into his head.
He tried it and he liked it. Something about masturbating to an audience was exhilarating. He was making money. He made a tumblr. He brought people to his show. For the first time in a long time, he was happy… as long as he didn’t think about what he was doing all that much.
“You’re a straight up asshole.” Tony seemed to deflate after those words, falling into Steve. “I fucking hate you so much. You’re the best thing that ever happened to me, and you tried to leave. Not only leave me but the entire goddamned world.”
Steve groaned and turned his chair away from the glass doors. Steve could come into his space, but Tony was going to make it very clear who’s space this really ways and always would be: Tony’s.
“I love you, too, Tony. I’m so, so sorry. I’ll… start going to the therapist. And taking the medicine like I’m supposed to. I’m going to get better for you. I’m going to get better for us.”
She began to cry. Steve handed her his cone and went to get napkins to clean up. As he was doing so, he noticed a small group of early-twenties boys pointing at them. It wasn’t uncommon; people pointed and stared at him, Tony, and the kids all the time. It was part of being famous.
The group was in Toni’s basement. There was liquor and laughing. Toni was sipping at a lemon-water, no longer pretending to drink. Tonight they were going to tell everyone. It had been five days since the doctor. Every day, he excitement grew. She kept the printout of Snoot’s ultrasound on her at all times, looking at it at every chance she got. Her Snoot. Her baby.
Steve did, and it only took about four minutes before Tony was snoring again. Steve smiled, kissed Tony’s cheek, and laid down beside him. In the early morning sunlight, Steve caught a look at the gold band Tony wore around his ring finger. His wedding ring.
“Yes.” The tone of Steve’s voice led Tony to believe he was honest. It also led Tony to believe that Steve wasn’t used to being asked this sort of questions. “Is Tony yours?”
The ride back to his Nana’s was short and he knew he should be getting back before she woke up from her nap, but he was worried about gravel getting stuck in the open wounds which were starting to sting.
Tony pulled back experimentally before thrusting back into Steve. He set a slow pace and, yeah, it was good, but Steve needed more. Since it seemed Tony was having trouble letting go, Steve decided to take charge.
The moment after they reached the grave and folded the flag, Tony trekked to the orange car he’d parked a few feet away earlier that morning. He didn’t say goodbye, didn’t say where he was going; he didn’t know himself.
“My apologies, dear husband of mine,” he sassed. Steve stood and kissed the top of Tony’s head. “The massage offer lasts for about two more minutes. If you’re not back in bed by then, I’m coming and taking him away from you.”
Ten or so minutes passed and Steve came back into the room. Tony had taken his place on the inside of the bed against the wall, already changed into pajamas. “Hey handsome,” he murmured into the pillow when Steve dropped his towel to step into boxers. A naked, wet Steve was an excellent view.
The Catholic Church is sexist, homophobic, and racist. I firmly and thoroughly believe in God but do not mistake my belief in Him as an affiliation with what the Church stands for.
Steve was wringing his hands. In the past, dream Steve never looked nervous. Occasionally he’d get out of bed and they’d talk, but it was never like this.
“What if I can’t get better?” Steve asked. “What if I’m a messy roller coaster of a person for the rest of my life?”
Tony groaned and rolled over so he was facing Steve. He forced his eyes open and, even in the dark, he could still see the faintest hint of the blue in Steve’s eyes.
“Steve,” the guy said with a careless shrug. Steve could be lying about his name, but for some reason, Tony believed him. Maybe that was the point. Maybe Steve told everyone his name… or at least his name of Steve. Maybe it was all a ploy. Steve was doing this to make money. This was Steve’s job.
“Cat,” Tony informed, lazily throwing his hand over his shoulder. “She won’t get off your pillow.” Steve looked at Riley and moments later, the cat was jumping off the bed. “How come she listens to you!”
biochemist of all biochemists, complimenting his bio-chem—was pretty much the best compliment he’d received in a long time. At least in the business sense—he turned to putty every time Steve complimented his eyes or something of the like.
The first person to speak after the coffin was placed on the flower donned stand, was President Ellis, who rambled on and on about what a gift it was to have the Good Captain back and the good the Good Captain had done both in his time and our own. It dawned on Tony suddenly that the majority of the people were there to mourn Captain America, not Steve Rogers. It suddenly felt like his gut was made of lead. Did any of these people even know what Steve looked like when he wasn’t in uniform—when he was wearing a t-shirt and jeans?
“YES I AM!” Bucky shouted back. Tony looked at the two. This wasn’t how he expected this night to go. He figured capturing Zemo and trading him for Bucky’s pardon would be enough excitement.
Bucky put his arms up in surrender, dropping the gun. “I can never undo what I did. I can never take back the hurt I caused you.” He brought his wrists together, held out in front of him. “You don’t have to help me. You can bring me to Ross. Lock me up. Don’t take it out on Steve.”
He tried to push Tony off, but Tony stayed firm. Steve wasn’t sure if he hadn’t heard or if he was ignoring it, but he couldn’t wait any longer. He let himself come in Tony’s mouth.
“Boston University.” Tony pointed at the screen, indicating the banner that hung on Steve’s wall behind him. “You’re at BU.”
“That’s fine with me,” Tony said. Steve noted that Tony’s eyes were still glued to Peter as if he’d disappear if Tony so much as blinked.
“I don’t want you to leave.” Every word had to be chosen carefully. “I told you, when I thought you were dream Steve, that we needed to talk but that we’d do it after.”
“Since when can’t you lie?” Tony snarked. Then, leveled by her glare, added, “There’s nothing I can do.”
Overtired and now bordering on grumpy, Steve took the elevator back up to the penthouse. Once outside of Peter’s room, Steve could distinctly hear Tony’s soft snores and the coos Peter made when he slept.
“Ice cream, ice tream, icet eem,” Sarah babbled her hand firmly in Steve’s. Her pigtails bounced as she skipped along, trying to pull Steve faster. “Papa! Come
“Just drop the bread and walk away,” Tony said. All three knew there was no malice to the remark, but they also knew Tony meant it when he said to leave.
“Hey, Dum-E. Have you seen dad?” he asked, betting the robot’s claw for good measure. Dum-E beeped and hung it’s “head,” shaking that no, he had not seen Tony. Steve pursed his lips and squinted his dry eyes. He should have just stayed in bed--Tony would have found his way there eventually. “Any clue where he went?”
“My boyfriend is part cat, you see,” Steve said seriously. “So, I think ‘what would he like-slash-do in this situation’ and then I act accordingly.”
“I’m calling them dampeners,” Tony announced, showing the tiny tab to Bruce. “It’ll slow down his metabolism and allow the effects of medications to take route in his brain.”
His fingers brushed across Steve’s cheek. Rough. Tony abruptly registered that Steve had grown a beard. That was new. He liked it. It looked good on Steve. It fit him. He was pretty sure he preferred clean-shaven Steve, but he’d take any Steve he could get right now.
“So you want me to mess with the serum,” Steve said when Tony was finally finished. “The thing that keeps me alive. That let’s me be Captain America.” A long pause. “That let me live long enough to meet you.”
“Hey, babe.” Steve placed a quick kiss on Tony’s lips before dropping into the chair opposite him. “Sorry I’m late.”
The door swung open and Steve rushed in. Tony often forgot how quickly Steve could move. In battle, there was so much going on that he didn’t particularly pay attention to the pace of his teammates’ movements, just that they were still moving. In every other situation, Steve was poised, his body constantly in control.
She was riding Steve’s cock when someone knocked on her bedroom door. No one was home. At least they weren’t supposed to be. Howard and Maria were scheduled to return Wednesday and it was only Saturday.
“Laura and the kids are worried,” she whispered, side glancing at Tony. “I can’t keep lying to them.”
Steve sighed and tried a different tactic. “If you come to bed with me right now, I’ll rub your shoulders and neck. If you’re really good, I’ll rub your back. You’ll fall asleep for a few hours and when you wake up, he’ll be right here.”
. If he looked in the window, he’d probably be able to see the ever-present sand from spontaneous day trips to the beach.
“So, Tony, is there anything you want to watch me do?” Steve purred and Tony’s cock jerked. Why hadn’t he unbuttoned his pants yet? “Do you want me to stroke my cock for you? Do you want me to finger my asshole? Leave it wet and gaping? God, it would feel so good to have your big cock in my tight little asshole.”
Rhodey frowned. “I’m not sure. I think it’s just the thing you’re supposed to say in these situations.” Again, the smile was there and gone before it had a chance to manifest itself, but Rhodey saw it none the less. “I know, you know. You didn’t have to tell me. I don’t know how or when or how much, but I know.”
“I’m okay with it. Maybe at some point, we can give one of your customers a little show with the two of us.” Where was this coming from? Tony knew how to flirt with women but this was uncharted territory. He thought he was doing alright, judging by Steve’s face. Then again, this was his job—to make the customer happy.
Captain America, aka Steve Rogers, calls Iron Man, aka Tony Stark, his “partner.” Would “friend and teammate” not suffice? Is there more to their relationship than they let on? PLUS: Is Stark’s ex, Pepper Potts, coming between them? [link]
Toni and Steve’s first date had been awkward. The day after Steve’s grand gesture in the gym, they'd walked into town after school. Toni had only been on one other date, in middle school. His name was Henry and he tried to kiss her as soon as they sat down for the movie, not even waiting or the lights to dim.
Weakly, Tony pointed out that Steve was his most stable in battle. Wanda shot down that sentiment moments later, saying that it was just one slip up that could be life and death for all of them.
“Hardy harr,” Tony deadpanned. Steve started to run his fingers through Tony’s hair, who smiled giddily and started moving his head against Steve’s hand, desperate for the comforting touch.
He wasn’t about to start filming porn; at least not yet. He was going to get his degree first. But that didn’t mean he couldn’t play around. He looked into being a cam-girl… or boy, as the situation might be.
“After all this time, you really think that I’m going to stand you up? Or be mad when you order my food. I actually think it’s kind of hot.”
“I don’t know!” Tony gave Steve a full body shove, but nothing. “I came up to surprise him during my lunch break and he was just…” Tony fell back his legs. He couldn’t do this. His body literally could not take the stress.
Their attention was shifted when they were instructed to pick up the coffin and carry it down the aisle. Tony had hoped that the sky would break; that there would be a downpour; that the stained glass saints would look to be crying.
“Do you want me to use my fingers?” Steve asked. Tony pried his eyes open to watch as Steve sucked three fingers in his mouth and started making obscene sounds and gestures with them. “Or do you want me to use a toy?”
Steve noticed that Tony’s eyes were slowly closing, the post orgasmic haze setting in. “How about after we take a nap.”
Steve, the Steve he’d fallen in love with, was back. Not that he didn’t love Steve always, but the simplicity and routine of what they had now was perfect. He was old and, though he was loath to admit it, wanted to have a low-key relationship with a partner he loved.
“Then I told you that I like having you as a friend and that I respect you.” Steve paused. “And then I told you that I wanted to kiss you. Do you know what you did?”
Steve watched Tony’s ministrations in silence, wincing when Tony prodded at the tender flesh with tweezers as he fished out tiny pieces of gravel that had taken up residence in Steve’s feet.
so i got kicked out of my apartment and it's a long story, yadda yadda. i have a place to live and shit. it's inconvenient as fuck and my commute is 2 hours. eh, anyway. don't want to get into it.
“Oh, right,” Steve mumbled, reaching for his pants. “I didn’t think I’d make it this far, but I figured I’d be prepared.” He held up a tiny bottle of lube. “Do you know what to do with it?”
There was scattered clapping and it took Tony a moment to realize that the president had just introduced him. He once again straightened his already straight tight, and stood. Every step towards the podium felt like running in the ocean. The waves kept pushing him back but he had to keep moving forward or he would be knocked down completely.
The world had seen his body. The picture had hundreds of thousands of views. It wasn’t even his best picture—just a low angle of him holding his cock and staring into the camera. The picture showed his abs, though, so he figured that was probably a selling point.
Putting aside superheroing and donations, Tony has developed prosthetics for amputees, developed and implemented renewable clean energy throughout all of his homes and businesses…
Tony was holding the phone, doing his nightly ritual of debating on whether or not he should push the button and dial the nine-digits he’d long ago memorized when it rang. He shouted and nearly threw the phone, but recovered at the last minute.
He could practically hear Tony rolling his eyes. “It’s going to be awhile. I’ll have to get James dressed and buckled into his seat.” Steve could tell that Tony was already in motion, getting ready to come down to the police station. “Where’s Sarah?”
“How far?” He still could barely feel his limbs, the morphine still circulating through his bloodstream.
“Yes?” Tony asked, uninterested. He wasn’t really in the mood to do this tonight. Especially since it would just end in empty promises. They’d done this dance before; Steve would apologize and Tony would forgive him. It wasn’t that Tony didn’t want to forgive Steve, because he did. Things were just too fresh tonight.
Tony frowned. “I’ll still be here. It’ll be hard, but I’d do it. But I won’t resign myself to that until we’ve tried every possibility.” He slid the bottle towards Steve. “Try it. For me.”
“Twelfth?” Steve asked. Tony looked at the number and was surprised to see that Steve was not in last place.
“Your mom is going to hate me,” Toni whined. She and Steve were sitting on the couch, waiting for Sarah to get home from work. Today was the day they told her. It needed to happen and Toni wanted to rip off the band-aid. Or, at least she thought that’s what she wanted until she was on this couch, getting ready for the conversation that would change her relationship with the only decent parental figure she’d ever known.
Steve recovered from his confusion and grabbed a toy just off to his left. Tony hadn’t realized the giant pump bottle filled with what he assumed was lubricant was there until Steve started to spread it along the toy.
Joseph and Lindsi are expecting a baby. Steve finds out on Facebook. Turns out they moved to Montana. He’s going to be a big brother to a baby he’ll probably never meet. It’s okay with him.
I'm several days behind because I hurt my hand and typing was a bitch. But it's all better and I'm back :D
Tony’s thumbs were sore. They’d been at it for hours. His palms were sweating and he had a leg cramp that wouldn’t go away. He couldn’t stop, wouldn’t stop. What’s more, he didn’t want to stop.
“Well, if real Steve were here I’d be pretty pissed he didn’t come back sooner. I’d probably slap him a few times. He deserves it.” The corners of Steve’s mouth twitched up. “And then I’d tell him we need to talk.” Tony cleared his throat. He hadn’t admitted this part to himself yet. “But we’d talk after. After we held each other and we kissed. After we shared ‘I love you’s.”
Tony slowly pushed in, his eyes never leaving Steve’s face. Steve wasn’t exactly sure how he felt about this whole thing. He knew he wanted it, but Tony was being so caring. He wasn’t sure if this was going to be a one time thing or not, but if it was, he would be severely disappointed. He could only imagine Tony taking care of him like this in all aspects of their life.
“I’m going to take care of you, okay?” Tony assured. “You know how you mother-hen me whenever I get a boo-boo--”
“Nah. You already came, anyway. It’s okay. Another time. Now, my goodnight kiss?” Tony reached out and swatted blindly in an attempt to get his hands on Steve. Steve obligingly kissed Tony and crawled into the bed, flicking off the light.
Doug took a screenshot of one of Steve’s nudes and leaked it online. Steve’s not sure if his mom saw it. Once it’s out there, though, he feels a kind of freedom. It was posted anonymously to PornHub. Bucky was the one that sent him the link. Was Bucky gay, too? He’d never asked and Bucky had never offered the information. He was a really shitty friend.
The fat lump didn’t move. Unwilling to argue with (and lose to) a cat, Tony rolled onto his other side. His eyes still open, he came face to face with Champ.
“I’m going to take such good care of you. I’ll give you sponge baths and help you from room to room. I’ll give you a hand job every morning.”
Tony peeled Steve’s pants back before getting on his knees between Steve’s legs. Tony took a deep breath.
“I’ll tell you mine if you tell me yours.” He stopped stroking himself and looked straight into the camera, as if not sure if he should or not. Maybe this was against protocol. Tony had never watched a camgirl before. Hadn’t even seen the interest. What’s wrong with old-fashioned, free porn? But he wanted to know him. This man… he
Rhodey swiveled his torso, taking in the room. “Who is there to tell? The way I see it, it’s nobody’s business but yours. I just happen to know you better than anyone else and was able to figure it out.”
While in the hospital, Steve was reevaluated and diagnosed with severe PTSD, survivor’s guilt, and bipolar disorder; a lot more than his initial diagnoses of moderate depression. Tony read the paperwork before Steve came home and had the chance to lie about his level of despondency.
The Apple store did not consider drunkenly dropping a device into a hot tub to be a valid warranty claim. Needless to say, the previous night’s teenage angst didn’t qualify, either.
“Yes.” Tony’s hand was getting faster as he stroked his own cock. He couldn’t cum yet. He refused to cum yet.
Tony sighed. This wasn’t a real person. He figured he’d play along, anyway. He didn’t have anything better to do. At least if he was flirting with a computer, he wouldn’t have to think about the fact that he was having a sexual identity crisis.
“I know you're trying to take down the patriarchy or set misogynistic douche bags right, but taking off your top and yelling at people for looking isn't solving the problem,” Steve said. Their friends had left hours ago and the pair were curled up on the loveseat, ignoring the TV while they made out. “Especially when those people are our friends.” He kissed her before she had a chance to respond.
Tony didn’t have the patience to sit there and stew over what he was about to do. He needed to blurt it out and he’d rather not do it with the server standing right there.
The choir sung in Italian as the coffin was carried to the front of the church. Steve would know the name of what it was. Looking around at the stained glass windows, Tony figured that Steve knew all the saints by name and could identify each one.
“How long after sex does it take for a pregnancy test to give accurate results?” It had taken another week and a half to get up the gumption to actually ask his mom the questions he'd been meaning to ask.
“It’s not a bad weird,” Tony decided. “That was… nice. You don’t have to return the favor if you don’t wa–how the fuck are you hard again?”
Steve felt restless and heavy hearted as he tried to come up with a way to stop his thoughts from going to Tony. It was just, ever since becoming aware; all he did was think about it. He'd opened his own personal Pandora's Box and was now trying to shove everything back into a place where it no longer seemed to fit.
Watching Tony now, Steve felt nothing but a swell of pride blossoming in him for his friend, this brilliant charismatic man, the one he loved.
These people, they understood everything that came out of Tony’s mouth, they contributed to the conversation in a way that Steve, at times, struggled to do.
And Steve really hadn’t known that Tony cared enough to have hurt feelings in the first place. And now the thought that maybe he had… That maybe there had been a chance, and Steve had just let it pass…
He realised... the word Vampire wasn’t surreal, or ridiculous, or anything to do with those campy, Halloween images-
certain that Tony wouldn’t have chained him up and gagged him, ordinarily, so he figured there was a certain amount of situational leeway allowed here. But, if he
But this might be even longer that I was expecting 🙈 What can I say, I have a very detailed plan, and I know exactly what I have left to write... I just always underestimate how much more of it there's going to be 😂
There were still a lot of people walking around in robes and nightwear that covered very little, and a few couples making out more enthusiastically than would
So many different consequences - different fears, from different perspectives, that Steve was in no fit state to process-
, the skinny kid from Brooklyn, who was thinking back to that night in Tony’s workshop. The pain he felt for Tony, the anger he felt on Tony’s behalf, the deep understanding of just how many issues were layered on top of each other. It was Steve’s own voice that spoke up to admonish him,
didn’t want to have that conversation. To the point that he could feel the resistance to it as a physical force on his skin, pinning him to the chair while a thousand awful outcomes played in his head-
“So, all I’m going to do is explain what these are, and then I’m going to leave you be, and you can spend some time alone, away from the noise of The Facility – and take as much time as you need to think about it, and decide what you want.” …And as Belle was speaking, Steve’s head had grown ever heavier against Tony’s shoulder… “And, of course, there are people just outside, if you have any other questions, or if you’d like anything else.”
And, without even knowing it, Bucky had assumed an end to the sentence. He remembered that particular tone of Steve’s. That tendency he had to talk as though he was scared the mic was still live - that determination to say the correct thing, however obvious it was that he wasn’t thinking it-
He glanced up at Sam and Bucky, who were both squinting at the horizon with distaste, clearly thinking the same thing…
And, God, if Steve had just taken every hope and happiness in his life and destroyed it in a single night-
So, again, apologies for the delay in this update - I work in a care facility for people with dementia, and as you may imagine, things have been a little busy of late! Also, I expect to be picking up a lot of over time in the immediate future, so apologies if I'm a little slower in answering your comments and messages, and if future updates are a few days late - but the fic *is* mostly written, so I can promise they will go up with no considerable delay. It's just the edits that I have to find time for - but, honestly, its my escape right now, so rest assured that it's happily being worked on!
“I just… I can only tell you that I know what I want,” Steve clarified, carefully. “And… I can’t ever know if I’m being influenced by something I don’t know about. I can just tell you how I feel, that I’m sure.”
And then Tony dropped his head again to seal the wound, sending another agonising shock through Steve as he sucked far too gently against the cut,
“You know, you only have one side of that story,” Clint muttered, like he was trying to control his temper. Steve was forced to clench his jaw in a bid to control his.
“A US Air Force plane was ‘lost’ somewhere over Germany,” Nick explained. “Everyone assumed a technical issue or maybe a crash - then, when we found no evidence of
“And there were plenty of things you could’ve done differently, and still not signed The Accords, and still prioritised Bucky. You didn’t
“Well,” Tony announced decidedly, “I need a drink.” He pushed himself up on his feet, swaying for a second before he fully got his footing, and then looked back at Steve, “you want one?”
He and Clint had shared so many different lives, and so many different relationships… And, somehow, all of that made Steve less sure, now.
“Hey,” he squeaked, sounding every bit as taken aback as he was. “Are you okay? Is Steve not with you?”
Tony had no idea how much time had passed, if time was even still passing, or if everything had just
actually preferred the feeling of unwavering religious faith… but there was no getting it back, once he’d questioned it. Too late now.
And almost immediately that sickness faded… more like Tony had simply forgotten it for a moment than because it had eased. But still, the relief was helpful. The pause on his darker thoughts. A reminder that there was only so bad things could really be, wherever this train of thought led him-
To have gone on any longer, with explanations of your motives and listing all the things you knew you’d done wrong and begging for forgiveness, would’ve been considered most self-indulgent. Embarrassing for the listener. Afterall, why should anyone want to listen to you moan on about
“What’re you smiling at?” Tony grinned, not even taking his eyes off of the little vial he was holding.
be some minor effects when people first arrive in Bulsara - but I can assure you, you will soon adjust to it. In half an hour…” and he paused to consider Steve, and then Bucky… “
of all places. And they still didn’t even know what The Facility might use that distraction to do. Kidnap them. Kill them. Yes, maybe even end the world.
Hesitantly, he raised his hand. He wanted to touch Steve. To feel him for a moment. Just a moment. He could touch dream Steve, couldn’t he? What happened in his subconscious stayed there, right?
“Does it matter?” The man was still stroking his cock and Tony, well, Tony was growing impossibly harder looking at it.
Tony started to lick down the underside of his cock, all the while cupping his balls. Steve wasn’t sure what exactly Tony did, but all of a sudden his back arched and he was at a loss for breath.
I see people are reading them but there's barely any notes (tumblr) or comments here. It's kind of disheartening.
@cptsteverogers: We are *not* having this conversation (again) via Twitter DMs (again) or *any other* social media platform (again).
“So you can ride cock and moan like a fucking porn star, but you’re gonna chastise me about saying ‘Christ’?”
When Steve was fourteen, his parents got divorced. He wasn’t sure why it had taken them so long. They had nothing in common and didn’t seem to like each other very much. The process was long and annoying, but it didn’t feel like a burden on him. He was actually kind of glad that they were splitting; no more waking up at 3 am to them arguing over whose turn it was to sleep on the couch (dad’s; always dad’s).
When he was sixteen, he let Doug jerk him off in the garage. Doug asked and Steve, mad at his mom and his dad and the whole fucking world, agreed. When he came in Doug’s hand, the paunchy, balding asshole wiped it on Steve’s shirt. “If you tell your mom, it’s the end of you.” Steve managed to keep his composure until the door to the house had clicked shut behind Doug. He fell to the ground and wept.
“No,” said another voice. The three turned to see T’Challa coming around a corner, his mask in his hands. “Mr. Stark will not have to help you. I will.”
Graduation came and went. His friends dropped off the face of the earth. He had Bucky change the password to his Facebook account but didn’t delete it. He didn’t want the texts and emails going on an on, asking why he deleted. Or worse: he didn’t want it to be that no one noticed.
“I wanted you to see that he wasn’t a horrible person. That it wasn’t his fault that he did the things he did.”
Tony’s eyes locked back on Peter. “Pretty soon he’s going to be too big to pick up and then he’ll be in high school and then he’ll graduate college. We’ll be old and gray and he’ll bring home some lovely lady or lad. They’ll get married and have babies of their own.”
Opening the little white FedEx box addressed to him, Tony found a letter with only his first name, written in a familiar all-caps hand. As he read, he forced himself to hear Steve’s voice filter through the room.
“How can you say shit like that to me?” he demanded. “You’re sorry for what it could have done to our relationship? Steve. You
(2/4) Mothers, sisters, aunts, cousins, friends – I wouldn’t be where I am today if it weren’t for the support of loving, empowered women. I guarantee you wouldn’t be either.
Tony didn’t know what to say to that. He was on top of Steve before either of them realized he was still fully clothed. Steve started to strip him. He was much clumsier than Tony and didn’t work nearly as quickly, but he made it out without too much humiliation.
“Look!” The picture was now wrinkled and folded. It didn’t stop Toni from shoving it in Pepper’s face the minute the door closed behind her and their session started. “It’s my Snoot.”
He stepped down from the podium and took his seat in the front pew again, sliding the red tinted glasses onto his face.
Tony sent a CAPTCHA that said “olivesons” which… eh, it was the first one that came up when he googled it.
His roommate was out. He had the room to himself. He could do this. It wasn’t illegal. People did it all the time. And it wasn’t a
Desperate to apologize, Steve sat up and ripped the IV from his arm. It wasn’t doing anything, anyway. If his mouth was as dry as it was now, the drip was not doing its job of hydration.
When they arrived at the cemetery, Tony shed the armor and watched as it collapsed itself into a discreet suitcase. He cracked his neck, straightened his tie, and rejoined the five other pall bearers.
“Steve!” he screamed. He slapped Steve, unconscious of the bathroom floor, across the face. It did nothing, Steve didn’t budge. “Steve!” Tony repeated, slapping him again. “JARVIS, get Bruce up here.”
Steve let out a short breath of air that Tony took to be a laugh. He watched with hungry eyes as Steve turned away from him, dropped the towel, and grabbed a pair of boxers out of the drawer. There was a hickey on his ass that Tony was quite proud of. He quickly grabbed his phone and snapped a picture before Steve had the chance to cover it with the underwear. Tony knew that by the afternoon, it would be gone.
“That’s what they call me.” It was a bad line, cheesy and overused, but the other choice was to do something stupid like say I miss you. It slipped out anyway.
“I’m not jealous,” Tony assured. “When we met, on your cam show I might add, and I asked you out, you said that you would still have to cam. I said I was okay with it. I was then and I still am now.”
“That seems to stray from your opinion of their level of competence when it was me who needed psychological evaluation,” Tony reminded, pulling away from the facility.
“Not a problem.” Tony had an 8am the previous day and had woken up at 5:30 to get ready and get back to his own campus on time--it was no closing in on 1am. “Please come to bed and kiss me goodnight so I can go to sleep.” God, he was slurring. Damn Steve and his regular sleep schedule that Tony had gotten used to; he used to pull at least two all-nighters a week.
Tony shoved his hands into his pockets, then took them out again. He cracked is index finger using this thumb.
Without much hesitation, Steve breeched himself with the toy. Tony didn’t stand a chance. Far too soon he was cumming. Fuck, he wanted this to last longer. What was he supposed to do now? Was he supposed to watch Steve until he finished? Was he supposed to just hang up and let Steve have his next showing? What was the protocol for this? Why had he thought this would be a good idea?
Steve woke to an empty bed. The clock to his left read 4:56am. His husband was nowhere in sight. Groaning, Steve pushed back the covers and stumbled to the bathroom. If he was going to be on a Tony hunt, he’d rather do it on an empty bladder.
Tony nodded, his eyes not meeting Steve’s. He reached out his hand and clutched Steve’s, squeezing it tightly. Steve felt the band of his wedding ring grind into his skin as Tony clasped on even harder. Tony was crying--Steve couldn’t comprehend the situation enough to cry.
Couldn’t have said it better myself. Thanks for your never ending support, Steve! #fightthewagegap #empoweredwomenempowerwomen
Tony sputtered. “I thought, I mean, we always get the same thing we did on our first date and so I figured... oh, you’re fucking with me.”
Bruce was performing CPR, which didn’t seem to have an effect on Steve. God, no. Please, no. “Goddammit Steve,” Tony shouted. Or thought he shouted. The room was going fuzzy around the edges. His breath was caught in his chest. His hands were numb. Heart attack? Worse, a panic attack. There were medications for heart attacks but he would just have to ride this out.
Please comment on this trash chapter. The next chapter is all planned out and I promise it will be better.
