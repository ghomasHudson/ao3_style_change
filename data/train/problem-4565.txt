“Sorry about that,” Castiel apologizes and Dean takes his gaze away from the bag, “there were a few housekeeping things I had to attend to. You’re here for astronomy, right?”
Dean usually prefers the seventies and sixties, the old school shit, to that of the last decade, but it’s hard to fuck with the Boss. It’s gotta be one of his favorite records.
“Uh, yeah. Sure. I get off pretty soon. I’ll meet you there at six?” He’s off at five. Hopefully that’ll give him enough time to shower and look like a respectable person again.
Cas picks the menu up and analyzes it, and Dean watches his finger as it moves down the laminated page. He looks perplexed and baffled and completely overwhelmed. He’s still staring at it when the waitress comes out to take their order.
His grades begin to improve. It’s minimal at first— a few more points than he’d usually score here or some extra credit assignment he took on there, but it’s something. Enough to stay on the team, at least. He’s still a few chapters behind. Sometimes when he’s at home going over the chapter on his own, sitting cross-legged on the bed, he wants to throw the whole damn book at the wall. It just doesn’t make any sense. If he’d known there’d be this much math involved in learning about the stars he would’ve never taken the goddamn class in the first place.
They held tutoring in a back room in the library, a room that still had wood paneling and blue carpet from twenty years back, that smelled of dust and rust and could never keep fully quiet due to the constant hissing of the radiator.
Betty shakes her head. “Don’t thank me; just promise me it won’t be another fifteen years before I see you here again.”
Betty reaches out and straightens the crooked collar of Cas’s trench coat. “Don’t you bother with those menus now,” she tells them, plucking the old laminated menus straight off the table, “I’ll get something fixed up for you.” She gives them a wink and oh god, sometimes Dean really does love this piece of shit town.
Dean doesn’t tell him that he feels all wound up like a tight string, that he would’ve run for hours and hours in the storm if he could. Run until he aches, run until he’s crouched down and vomiting on the side of the track, rain be damned. Without it the anger has nowhere to go. He has no choice but to keep it inside of him.
He wanted to casually mention it to Castiel in tutoring that day, bring it up like it was no big deal when he’d inevitably ask him about it, but he’s so goddamn happy that he can’t keep it in.
Dean gives him a shrug. He looks through the options himself, even though he knows he’s going to order the same damn thing he always does. “I don’t know; what do you like?”
That’s what normal people say. But Cas was never normal. He contemplates the question and answers truthfully, “I don’t know.”
“Huh,” he says. Strange. He never thought Cas would come back at all; once you’ve seen that there’s a whole world outside Lawrence you rarely come back. That’s how it was with Sam, anyways. Smart kid that he was, he got a scholarship into Stanford and Dean coughed up just about every last dime he had for a one-way flight and enough cash for a year of groceries just so the kid never had to step foot in this piece of shit town ever again. He only ever comes back to visit Dean. He even had his wedding in California.
He rattles the ice sadly with his straw. “I think I might get another drink,” he says, giving Dean a pointed hundred-yard stare, “
So he gives it his all, living up to the worthiness of the gaze of these invisible eyes. He dreads his possible boredom, the possibility of him slipping out in the seventh or eighth inning when the game is all spelled out and the fancy cars of the recruiters peel out of the parking lot, or worse, feigning some excuse to leave at half time and half-heartedly apologizing for it later, asking without real interest who won the game.
When they reach the wooden sign and winding driveway it’s dark out. The stars are beginning to shine. Dean kills the engine and it dies with a sputter. They didn’t even get to finish the Zeppelin tape.
“You sure?” Dean asks. There’s still a full-on storm outside.  “Can’t have my tutor gettin’ sick on me; I’ll flunk for sure.”
Cas seems to think this over for a second, head tilted to the left. He gives Dean a smile that seems almost nervous. “Alright, then. I’ll go.”
“Hey, it’s no biggie. I get it.” He does, too. Dad’s word was always both Law and God wrapped together into one at home. Still, it doesn’t mean he can’t be disappointed.
It’s within a few minutes as they drive past empty fields, past the old barn that used to belong to Mr. O'Connor until he up and died one day, letting the place run to ruins, and past the lamppost on 164th Street that juts out just a little too far on the curve and is single-handedly the cause of at least half the car accidents in Lawrence (at least, Dean assumes that, given the number of times he’s almost wrecked his own car there) until the unmistakable white house begins to show itself amongst the trees. When they reach the wooden ‘no trespassing’ sign Cas tells him to stop. Dean kills the ignition in the opening of the driveway.
There’s about a hundred things Dean wants to say to him. In fact, there’s so many things that he doesn’t even know where to begin and so instead says nothing at all. They part with a casual handshake, Dean wishing him good luck. Not even a hug. Cas is gone the next day. Dean didn’t even leave him his phone number.
“‘Night, Cas.” It comes out like a rasp. He hears Cas close the car door. He wants to never see him again and for him to turn around and come right back. He has no fucking clue what he wants.
Despite the bitter cold he’s still lingering there on the sidewalk, by the window with weak yellow light coming through the taped-up snowflakes. The real snowflakes gather on the shoulder of his jacket.
He cruises to the sound of Zeppelin and electric guitar, windshield wipers working furiously against the rain. Up ahead he spots some kid walking up the sidewalk and he asks himself what the fuck kind of crazy person would be out in this weather. Christ, can’t he see there’s a storm outside?
“Not bad,” he says once it’s finished, handing it back to Cas, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. Cas takes the cup from his hand but he’s looking at Dean. He stares openly at him, that confused look on his face like he’s studying him, and Dean draws back in self consciousness.
Castiel says nothing, face smooth like stone and completely unreadable as he gets up to pull a book from the towering shelf behind him. He sets it down on the table, angling it halfway between Dean and himself and Dean moves closer to where he can see it better. He looks down at it; it’s called
It was a beautiful house— the most beautiful house in town. Mr. Novak had it repainted every year so the white never dulled and the wrap-around porch with the little swing and potted flowers always looked ready for a Home & Country photoshoot. A real Martha Stewart house, the kind of house you buy when you have enough money to make people wonder what the hell it was you were doing in a piece of shit small town in Kansas.
They get to the Snack Shack right as it is closing down, and with a smile and charm Dean manages to convince the tired-looking sophomore behind the register to take one more order. The bleachers are vacant, the scattered remains of snacks and wrappers left carelessly among them. The parking lot is almost empty; the cars of the losers left just as quickly as the kid got out of the shower. Dean doesn't envy them. He knows what they’re hearing.
“Hey, Betty?” He calls out in a last ditch effort to get his heart to stop doing whatever the fuck it was doing and get the red out of his face.
Dean sits down next to him and the silence is stifling. He almost introduces himself, but figures it would be a stupid thing to do when they’ve both known each other since before they could tie their own shoelaces. He just sits there, drumming his fingers on the old wooden table. The radiator hums on in the background. Castiel is glancing back and forth between a paper in front of him and a big book on his left. Dean watches his dark brow furrow as he marks something down on the sheet in front of him, his determination somewhere between ice and steel.
“That sounds nice,” Cas says. It’s so stilted and awkward but you can see it in his face, how hard he’s trying to pass as normal, like he’s just a regular kid talking to a friend.
It’s a lonely time of year. December was always his least favorite month; by then money was wearing thin and the heat always got shut off when the towering stack of unpaid bills got too high. Dad was never around to help out, and if he was it wasn’t for long. He’d stumble around drunk and fall asleep on the couch, ranting and raving or mumbling unkept promises Dean knew better than to believe. He and Sammy would spend their winter break huddled up in all the blankets they could find and watching tv until they felt numb and blank, living off pizza and the big Christmas basket the Lawrence Methodist Community Church dropped off at the door. Like scavengers they’d unwrap butterscotch candies or fight each other for the best ones in the box of chocolates, hands sticky from the caramel-covered kettle corn.
“Is the entirety of the film going to be like this, with words on the screen?” Even though Cas says it at normal volume it still jostles the hell out of Dean.
He’s not sure it’s real, like he actually got Castiel Novak from the White House on a Hill to lie to his dad just to go to a fucking movie theater with him. It feels pretty awesome, he’s not going to lie.
They sit across from each other and don’t say much. There’s not much to say. They spend more time picking at their food, sipping on the hot coffee Betty brought out for them. The jukebox is playing something old and ironically upbeat for the occasion, something by Bobby Darin, he thinks. Right now he could go for the Smiths.
He drops his hand. It’s still shaking. He’s shaking everywhere. He pulls back, sharp, throwing himself back into his seat. His seatbelt clicks tight around him; he never unbuckled it. He takes a big gulp of air. It still feels like he can’t breathe. He sits there and stares down at his lap, feeling like he’s going to be sick; he’s got a death grip on the steering wheel, like holding it tight enough will get him to calm down. It doesn’t.
“Look,” he relents, “you can pay next time.” He’s not giving out any apologies, but he’s putting enough into his words to let Cas know he’s sorry. It’s an olive branch of sorts.
“Mr. Winchester,” she smiles at him, red lipstick stuck on her teeth. She was a kind sort of southern lady, like an aged debutante, with a feminine voice underlined by the rasp that came with at least twenty years of chain-smoking. “How can I help you today, sweetheart?”
He throws all his shit onto the floor of the car when he gets to her, careful not to get the leather seats wet. He just had them detailed last week. The water runs like a river down the windshield, blurring everything in sight. For a moment there’s a bright flash of lightning. The storm’s moving in. He starts her up and there’s that cold blast of air that comes before the old heater starts to kick in. His teeth are clattering.
“Sit down.” Castiel’s voice never fails to throw Dean for a loop. It sounds old and aged, like the whiskey dad kept in the back of the cabinet or the rumbling of thunder on the plains that comes right before a storm. He doesn’t seem anything like seventeen. He couldn’t; even if it wasn’t the voice it was the way he carried himself, straight and firm but without any youth, or the way he dressed, all pressed shirts and slacks and noose-tight ties. Dean wore the same leather jacket every day, and jeans and shirts that were old when he got them but were now so worn they were dangerously close to falling apart. Across from each other they look like strangers from different planets.
“How was practice?” Cas asks, changing the subject. At least there are a few social cues he’s picked up on and Dean would thank God for that, if he believed in one.
“I, uh,” Dean stands there looking at his shoes, trying to look anywhere but her face, really, “I’d like to get a tutor for astronomy. I got a note from Mr. Johnson.”
Cas looks at his lap, a small smile spreading across his face. Dean almost wishes he wasn’t driving so he could look at it longer, the rarity that it was.
“It’s unfortunate we weren’t able to finish the tape. I would’ve liked to hear the rest.” Cas frowns into his lap, turning over the album case in his hand.
“Betty makes the best pie.” Dean is working on his own slice, though he’s taking more time with it than Cas. He’s still almost done with it by the time Cas is wiping cherry from his mouth with a napkin, though. He’s only got a bite-sized chunk left on his plate.
Dean pauses, hand on the combination lock. “Yeah, why?” He twists it to the left, to the right, and it springs open. He grabs his math textbook and replaces it by cramming in his English notes.
Bobby’s had barely changed in the last fifteen years. Hell, nothing in Lawrence ever did, not really. The coffee was still stale and bitter, the paint left on the tool cases was peeling off in chunks, and the whole place reeked of all the diesel and oil spilled across the floor over three decades. It smelled like home.
He remembers it all too well— the way the wind felt on a sunny day when they rolled the windows down, the days they decided to play nothing but their favorites just because they could. The way Cas always forgot the words to Eleanor Rigby and the way it always made him laugh, and Cas would look at him with something like embarrassment and also a little bit like he’d just won the lottery.
Cas seems slightly miffed by Dean’s amusement, like he’s laughing at him, which Dean kind of is but he doesn’t mean it to be cruel. It’s more fond than anything. “I’ll likely find the time to see one someday. In the meantime, you should be focusing on the lesson. Chapter seven homework is due tomorrow and we’ve only gotten to question fifteen.”
By the end of the session his head hurts; it always does. It’s hard work understanding all the numbers, all the AUs and the ‘to the x powers’ and what the fuck a light year is, but Castiel is patient with him. He rumbles on, voice smooth and rough in a way that feels conspiratorial, like a whisper exchanged between friends, as they go over Mercury and Saturn and the way they orbit the Sun, Dean leaning in closer towards the book, their heads almost touching as he follows Castiel’s finger move across the words on the page.
It was the only place that felt like home as a kid, tucked away in the back and tinkering away on some little assignment Bobby had given him while the grown-ups did the real work up front. He’d watch them out of the corner of his eye, note the way they’d carry a wrench or the way they’d wipe the sweat off their brows with an oil-stained rag. He’d smell the lingering sweat and coffee and could almost taste the heat of the place, even in winter when the whole town was covered in snow. Bobby’s was always a furnace, burning hot from working bodies and sizzling light bulbs, the ones that had no right being as hot as they were with the little light they gave off, making the small place seem as hot and cramped as a medieval blacksmith’s.
“I love this one,” Cas says. They played it twice over the weekend. His song of choice is “I’m on Fire”, which Dean thinks is a weird pick because it’s the shortest and slowest song on the record. It always felt like a pause, like a halftime show at a ball game to calm down the crowd before the real action picks up again. It’s so simple, Dean had said. That’s why I like it, Cas replied. It doesn’t need to be anything other than what it is.
“Nah man, I’m baseball all the way. The Royals are number one.” He and Sammy got to see a game once, back in freshman year when Dean managed to scrape up enough money for scalped tickets—  shitty ones too, the ones way up in the nosebleeds. Sammy had to lean over the railing just to see what was going on and they watched the Jumbotron more than they did the actual field. It was one of the best days of his life.
“I spent this whole semester reading about the stars and planets but never a single second looking at them.” Dean swirls a fry in his ketchup, his second batch almost gone. They’ve been sitting there for the past two hours. “I mean, what’s the point?” he adds on, mouth full of food, “Why do I gotta learn all this shit if I’m never gonna put it to use?”
Cas smiles at him. For a minute Dean almost thinks he’s going to grab his hand. “I never wanted to, either.”
In one last act of kindness the old man had left the shop to him when he died. Even in his grief it floored him, pulled the rug right out from under his feet and left him wondering what the hell it was he ever did right in his life to have known a guy like Bobby.
“Manager’s been on my ass this whole week. I think this heat is driving everyone crazy.” The humor in it is forced and also futile; Cas doesn’t even crack a smile. He stands there and it feels like they’ve run out of things to say.
Dean brewed a whole new batch of coffee. He’s not drinking that cold, grainy batch that Johnny left in the pot. Johnny was the latest new-hire, another high school dropout. He rolled up to the shop in June in an old souped-up Corvette, a real home-garage job, and asked for a job. He said he was real good with engines and could get just about any car running again, no matter how old. And he was damn good with an engine, but he lacked skill in handling the temperamental coffee machine. Every batch he’s made has come out bitter and rough. Not that Dean could do much better.
“It may seem that way at first, but with enough practice you’ll find it easier to understand. We just have to get through the essentials.” He hands Dean a pen, already aware that Dean will definitely have lost any writing utensil he had by the time free period begins. “Now let’s start at the beginning of chapter four. I’ll start reading. Whenever you don’t understand something, feel free to stop me and we’ll go over it, alright?”
Cas simply shrugs. “My father thinks it is mindless and cheap entertainment. He believes I would be better off reading a book.”
Cas, bundled up in a trench coat that must be a hand-me-down from a sibling, flicks the page of the textbook, most of his hand covered by the too-large sleeve. “No, I am not,”
Cas’s voice takes on that tone he uses when answering a question in class— the forced kind, the house-on-the-hill kind. “Fine. And you?”
Betty was right. The whole goddamn sky is glowing. It seems so big and Dean feels so small sitting there behind Mr. O’Connor’s barn, looking up above him, knowing now that he’s looking at something that is so far away that it might even be dead by the time he’s seeing this light. It’s such a rare gift, looking out into the past like this. He suddenly gets the desire to understand it, the vastness of it all and the insignificance of themselves when compared to it. Lawrence always felt small, but now it’s not even a speck in the nothingness. This is an oddly comforting idea.
He thought about sending Sammy away a lot, thinking maybe he could spend the three weeks of break with a friend, but nobody ever seemed to be home or felt like accepting a mostly unknown guest. He remembers with guilt that he always wanted them to say no because he couldn’t bear the thought of staying in that house alone. The solitude would destroy him.
“Winchester!” Danny, the manager yells out from somewhere in the back, startling them both, “get your ass to work! I don’t pay you to sit around and look pretty. Fix the goddamn display on aisle seven like I told you.”
“Good to see you, too,” he says, wiping sweat from his hands on the sides of his pants. They’re already dirty, anyway. “I heard from Benny you’re staying at the Bed & Breakfast.”
Cas squints into the sunlight as they make their way across the parking lot, his vision not quite yet adjusted either. “I’m not sure its depiction of the American West is entirely accurate, but I admired the story. It was very interesting. Almost biblical.”
“That was fifteen years ago, Cas,” he tries to reason, already knowing he’s starting an argument he’s destined to lose. Something about Cas brings out his childish antics, always makes him feel like a schoolboy with a crush.
He drives that car to this day— his pride and joy and the closest thing to love he’s ever known. He’s got it parked in the garage now that it’s December. No matter how much he fixed her she was an old car and dumping buckets of snow on her always made for more trouble than it was worth. It was always better to keep her warm and dry.
He hands it back to Dean, who sets it down on the ground next to the rest of his trash. Cas picks up his own slushie cup and extends it towards Dean.
have their moments, but they can’t compete with classics like “When the Levee Breaks” and “Going to California, ” let alone “Stairway to Heaven”.
“I should’ve kissed you that night,” Dean blurts sometime later, fork hovering in the air. Cas swallows his bite of pie (cherry, Dean’s favorite) and tilts his head. He slices off another chunk, eyes still on Dean, like he’s waiting for him to elaborate. Dean’s cheeks feel like they’re on fire.
“You have to try, Dean. It will get easier.” Castiel repeats himself for the umpteenth time, shoving the textbook back to Dean.
There's a lecture on the tip of Cas’s tongue, he can see it, but he’s holding it back. Dean almost doesn’t want him to. The grin on his face is stupidly wide, he knows. He can feel it in his cheeks.
Dean would’ve liked for him to go, too. He feels real stupid now, at the eight dollars he just blew for nothing. Besides, Cas might not have liked the movie. Maybe it’s for the best. He didn’t think about that; he just assumed he’d like it. Most people love movies, but Cas isn’t most people; he’s different, he looks at the world in ways Dean never even thought of before. Maybe he’d find the whole thing stupid, a real waste of time like his dad tells him. Still, Dean would kill to see what his face looks like in the dim light of a movie theater.
Dean feels a little pathetic. He’s sitting across from him and he’s a goddamn lawyer with a name and a life and Dean feels like he has neither. “Ah, come on now,” he brushes him off, “You know nothing in Lawrence ever changes.”
“There you are,” Cas says, handing the phone back. Dean stares down at the number, already sure that he’ll have it memorized completely by the end of the year.
“So, how’s tutoring going?” He asks two stoplights later when the silence becomes stifling. He’s come to know Cas as a bit of an odd one, the kind of guy who will sit comfortably alone in silence until someone addresses him personally. Dean thinks he could remain silent until the end of time. He probably doesn’t talk at home either, not with siblings like that. Dean pictures them sitting in the perfectly clean living room, kinda like the one from the Brandy Bunch but without the laughter, each with a book in hand and the stillness surrounding them like the waiting room in a funeral parlor. Graveyard quiet, no t.v. in sight. The ticking of an old clock on the mantle. He shivers— something eerie about the image. Unnatural. He thinks he’d go crazy living with all that quiet and acknowledges the miracle it is that Cas isn’t weirder than he already is. Jesus, what a lifetime of living in your head could do to a guy.
The diner is lonely and sad. There’s a summer storm outside and rain streaks down the window. Dean loves a summer storm, the cleanliness of it and the smell of the sidewalk afterwards, but not right now. Right now it feels like the universe is mocking him, shoving his sadness in his face in the most cliche way possible.
“I’m sure you’re much better than you imply. And besides I doubt I would even notice; I don’t know much about baseball. I’ve never watched a game.”
So he imagines. That Cas is there. That there’s somebody out there in the stands watching him, cheering him on. Someone who came just to watch him. Of their own free will, on a dreary Saturday afternoon that would be far better spent watching cartoons and Mary Tyler Moore Show reruns than at a stupid high school baseball game.
The engine is still running and the record is still playing, something upbeat but he can’t hear a damn thing. He feels frozen. He takes deep, even breaths, looking at his hands in his lap, yellow in the car light, watching them tremble.
“You know,” Cas says, finger swirling around the lip of the empty mug, “growing up I hated living here. I really did. I couldn’t wait to leave. And yet, I’ve missed this place terribly. Isn't it strange?”
His favorite booth is near the back and off to the left, and is just isolated enough for him to be left alone most of the time. On the wall above it is a framed picture of James Dean. When he was a kid Dean worshipped the guy and looked at that picture with a reverence like he was the Virgin Mary or Jesus Christ himself. He actually probably knows more about James Dean than Jesus when he thinks about it. And besides, savior or not, Jesus never wore a leather jacket and drove beautiful sports cars.
Dean got there early, right when the snow started,  grabbing his James Dean both before any of the dinner rush crowd could snag it. He wonders if this is what Cas meant when he said to meet him here. Hopefully he’s not getting snowed on out the parking lot waiting for him. He sips on a cup of hot coffee, his first decent cup of the day, hoping the cup he got for Cas won’t go cold before he gets there.
“You know something, Cas?” They’re sitting across from each other at Betty’s diner, at Dean’s favorite booth. Cas’s parents are gone for the weekend, flown off to some conference in Florida somewhere. They’ve spent these last two days in a haze of junk food and rock music on the stereo, midday drives to nowhere and late night conversations parked in the driveway, drinking gas station cokes one after the other. The only stipulation is getting Cas back home by ten, just in time to answer the phone call his dad will inevitably make.
“Jesus. Well, your dad doesn’t know shit. The movies are great, man. Me and Sammy rent stuff from Blockbuster all the time.” God, if there’s anything that can put a stupid argument to rest or simply soothe a bad day it was Blockbuster, with it’s too-bright tiles and the gumball machine in the corner, though he and Sammy regularly fight over what to rent. Sammy gets his way more times than Dean cares to admit.
But he never came back. And with that he faded into town myth and obscurity. Sometimes when Dean looks hard up at that hill, at that perfect white house that never made a sound, he thinks he understands why.
Dean orders his regular: a classic style hamburger with special recipe barbecue sauce, a coke, and a side of fries. Cas takes one last look at the menu and in defeat simply says he’ll take the same. For a guy who read
He holds his hand up to touch his face. It takes a moment. “Cas,” he whispers. God, his hand is shaking.
“Yeah,” Dean says with shaky breath. The last notes of the song fade out. He can’t even look at him. He’s still staring at his lap.
“Got something for you,” he says, handing him a Walkman, the one he spent more money and extra hours than he ought to saving up for. The one he wanted to buy as soon as he found out Cas was leaving.
“That’s good to hear.” Dean turns right at the intersection. The rain is starting to let up. “Us dumb kids aren’t causing you too much trouble?” He jokes.
Cas smiles at that. “I think I can manage a few feet in the rain,” he says while turning to look up at the hill. The rain is slamming down hard and the white house is little more than a blur in the distance. With a noticeable hesitance he steps out of the car.
, every flame dying with a sputter. He cups his hand around the flame and the wind still finds its way through. Damn. You can’t even have a cigarette with weather like this.
Dean feels his heart jump. There’s no food left on his plate to distract himself from that with. He sadly eyes his empty coke. “Oh, Good. Uh, glad you’re enjoying it.”
“Are you unhappy to miss it?” Cas is watching them too, seeming confused with their behavior. Dean wonders if he would’ve liked to go. He imagines he’d make a very interesting prom date.
God, sometimes the things Cas says make him feel stupid happy for no reason. He feels all damn dizzy, like that adrenaline rush that comes at the end of a roller coaster, the way a merry-go-round feels like as a kid.
When the waitress comes to collect their empty plates and glasses (Dean caved and bought Cas that second coke, taking a sip out of it first though for good measure when the waitress set it down. The look on Cas’s face was worth it), she drops down the dessert menu, telling them to look it over with a wink and a smile.
Dean kicks at a pebble with a downhearted disappointment. He wants time to stop right then, and he wills the universe to let the sun to never set. The universe is indifferent to these desires.
The brief break in the rain ends as quickly as it began. It’s almost instantaneous; first comes the crack of thunder, and then the torrent is back. It pounds against the windshield, the sound of it muffled inside the car, but almost loud enough to be heard above the turned-down rock station. The radio announcer is telling a story about the time he met Jimi Hendricks. It wasn’t a good story and he told it often. Still, Dean lets it play.
Paper snowflakes from the elementary school kids hang taped up in the windows. Dean can hardly see a thing through them. He peers through the safety-scissor cut holes, waiting for Cas to pull up. It’s almost impossible to see anything in the parking lot, especially with the snow coming down. It’s not sticking yet, at least. But everyone can already tell it’s going to make for a hell of a cold night.
He cranks the volume up loud when that song comes on, as it deserves to be played. Jimmy Page is on guitar and the sound of it fills the car. The first notes are sublime.
Nobody could ever figure out what the hell the Novaks were doing in Lawrence. There were always the rumors whispered amongst over-imaginative children, about mafia bosses and witness protection programs or tax evasion schemes, but the reality of whatever drew them to Nowhere, Kansas never came to light. They weren’t a talkative bunch. They kept to themselves mostly, hiding away in their white house on a hill, an old and weather-worn ‘no trespassing’ sign at the bottom of the winding driveway keeping out any neighbors or mischievous teenagers who might want a peek inside.
“I can drive you home from school,” he says. He doesn’t know why he said that or where that idea came from in the first place, but it’s out there. And he’ll stand by it. “I mean, since I get out of practice same time you’re done tutoring. It’d make it easier for you.”
Dean hates the thought of Cas in someone else’s car, as stupid of a thought as it is. He wonders if he listens to the radio on the way home, if it reminds him of Dean, even if it’s just the last thing he thinks about before he takes the keys out of the ignition, sparing only a second in the car before he goes inside.
He can’t remember who it was who told him Cas got accepted into Harvard. He thinks it was a lot of people; news spreads fast in Lawrence. It doesn’t surprise him; Cas was always the smartest guy he knew and he thought he’d fit in way better there than he ever would in Lawrence. But somehow he felt like he’d never see him again.
Dean shrugs his leather jacket off in one quick movement and hands it over to Cas, who eyes it with wariness, but takes it from his hands regardless.
He doesn’t mean it to be funny but Dean laughs, he honest to God laughs. “Dude, you weren’t even paying attention! You never noticed, not even once.”
“Do you think we’ll ever see each other again?” Dean asks, filling out the check and leaving a tip for the waitress. She was in the same year as him; she didn’t graduate either.
There’s a flush traveling up Dean’s neck now, and he’s sure there’s bright pink in his face to match. He wishes Cas talked like a normal person. “Well, great. Thanks for the help.”
Hell, Dean had been in the same grade with him for years and never gave the kid a second thought. They’d passed very few words over the years; enough that if you added up all their conversations they’d hardly amount to over ten minutes. Ten minutes over twelve years. For a town where everyone knew everyone, that was an astoundingly low number.
Dean showed up the next Tuesday, dread in his gut, wondering for a second if it’d be rude not to knock before he swung the door open anyway.
“Alright, dear; I’ll mark you down for Tuesdays and Thursdays at two. I’ll let Mr. Novak you’re comin’. Next Tuesday sound alright for you to start?”
“So, what do you think?” He asks Cas, who is eyeing his blue raspberry slushie with wariness (blue raspberry is not an actual fruit that exists in nature, Cas had informed him when Dean listed the options of flavors for him). They’re sitting on the cement curb, wet grass behind them and torn-up asphalt under their feet. Cas takes a slow, careful sip.
He’s still lonely. He’s over thirty now and with no one to come home to. It doesn’t bother him most of the time; the solitude he always dreaded has come to feel like an old friend. He's learned that with time you can get used to just about anything.
“Well, if you do find yourself in trouble again, I suppose you can call me now.” Cas swallows down the last bite of his burger. He picks a stray pickle from off his plate and eats that, too. “I’m moving back, Dean. That’s what I wanted to tell you.”
because Cas wanted to hear it again. He said he thinks he would “understand the themes better” this time around. The only “theme” Dean really cares about is a solid guitar solo, but it’s a good record and Cas insisted, so he obliged.
“Right. Fifteen years.” Damn. Has time really gone by that fast? It somehow feels like an eternity and nothing at all.
It was a stupid bar fight; the guys’s nose was barely broken and that bottle hardly caused a scratch on his head, not even anything worth getting stitches for, but he got charged with assault all the same. He spent a good six months behind bars for it in Douglas County Jail. He’d like to say it was the first time it happened, but it wasn’t. Hell, he spent more of ‘99 on probation than he did a free man. He was really hoping Cas would never find out about that, but he can never seem to keep his damn mouth shut.
Cas shuts the door, gently, like he’s already sensed how much love Dean has for his car. Dean watches him again as he walks up the driveway and without rain blocking his vision he can almost see him at the very top of the hill. Porch lights flicker on in the distance and he can make out the outline of Cas in the yellow light of an open doorway. He waits there until they switch off. The engine rumbles as he turns it over.
“What about your old man?” Dean asks, taking the paper back and shoving it into the locker with all his might, slamming the door so nothing else has the chance to spill out.
“It’s my turn to pay. You promised.” Cas has a death grip on the black checkbook. He swiped it so fast when the waitress dropped it down Dean almost didn’t notice. He immediately tried to grab it, of course, but Cas wouldn’t relent and he knew he was fighting a useless battle.
It starts raining halfway through “No Quarter”. It’s a light rain, though, just a sprinkle that will either die in a minute or last off-and-on throughout the night. Light reflects on the droplets running down the window. He turns the music down a little bit, feeling more comfortable with the sound muted, full-blast feeling a bit like an insult for the evening. He only likes playing music loud like that when he’s running away from something. Right now he wants to stay right where he is. It’s a damn shame to watch Cas wave goodbye that night.
Dean stops. He would recognize that voice anywhere. His eyes bounce around the lot until they land on him, making his way past someone’s beat to hell Camero, and he jogs to meet him halfway.
Dean sighs. He’s not sure if this intrusion is a blessing or a curse. All he knows is he doesn’t want to say goodbye to Cas, not yet.
“You still paid.” Even the puppy eyes Sammy used as a kid to get his way would be no match for Cas’s steely glare, freakishly unwavering. Dean wonders how many witnesses in court have crumbled under that stare.
The check is all on the same bill, sitting there on the table with the black checkbook open and pen next to it. Cas goes to grab it, but Dean slides it towards himself instead.
His face is silhouetted by the low beams, lined by yellow light. Dean is looking over him, able to take his time without red lights and stop signs getting in the way. It feels like he’s holding his breath.
“Where would you like to start?” Castiel flips open the cover, fingers thumbing over the pages as he moves from the index to the table of contents.
“Yes, it does bring back memories.” Cas looks around the place, smiling, mind seemingly elsewhere and blowing on his coffee. “Good ones.”
His movements were stiff and wooden and it was like his presence strangled out all the life in a room. He was quiet with a brooding intensity that always made you falter, always made you feel unassured, like you were standing on an unstable ground that could crumble at any second. And yet, somehow, he was remarkably unassuming from a distance. Moderately attractive and average in any other physical attributes, he haunted the halls like an old ghost; a presence that was always there and maybe sometimes felt but never really recognized.
Cas seems hesitant. “Are you sure that wouldn’t trouble you? I live a bit out of the way; I wouldn’t like to be a bother.”
“Thanks,” Dean says, still grinning as he throws his arm around him. “We should get something to celebrate. You eaten anything?”
The lights start to dim until the room is black with darkness, the screen widening out and Cas asks:
Cas, to his credit, seems nearly indifferent. “Perhaps I could’ve gotten you house arrest. Likely even probation,” he says with a smile. Man, he’s really missed Cas’s sense of humor; he’s never met anyone else with one just like it.
The wind rocks the dugout. The old wood groans above Dean’s head. His shoe repeatedly taps on the concrete. Outside grey clouds are blooming into the sky, a lingering threat of rain the crowd will talk idly about until the game begins between bites of lukewarm hotdogs and sticky candy.
Cas has a burger too, and he’s certainly acquired better table manners over the years, Dean thinks, watching him eat it with considerably more grace than the first time they were here. He’s still sucking barbecue sauce off his fingers, though.
Cas walks through the door, the little bell chiming above him, and brushes the snow from off the shoulder of his jacket. The snow on his leather shoes melts straightway beneath the warm lights. He looks around the diner, smiling when he catches Dean’s eye.
He wouldn’t understand it, getting early to school for breakfast, loading up with food at lunch ‘cause it’s free and having to stand in the fucking poor kid’s line for it with the rest of the trailer trash, hoping that there’s enough money left or food in the fridge at home that night. Having teammates pick up his bills, well-meaning church ladies stopping by the trailer to give out donated clothes. Kids in white houses never know goddamn degrading it all can be. The sense of shame that comes with polite courtesy. Still, Dean gets the feeling he’s done something wrong. Better said, he knows he’s done something wrong. As pissed and pitied as he felt, it was no reason to go around raising his voice and using his fist like dad on a drunken rampage, the ones that made him smaller than dust. It’s really not a wonder that Cas isn’t talking to him. He probably deserves it. But he hates it all the same.
was rather generous. He was crashing, hard. Even old hardass Mr. Johnson gave him a look of sympathy when he pulled him aside one dreary Monday to let him know that grades like this couldn’t go on if he wanted to stay on the baseball team and
Cas slips into it, the sleeves just a little too long. “Given the current weather I find that to be a highly unlikely scenario, but I appreciate the sentiment nevertheless.”
Dean hadn’t even known more than his name, really, even though they’d had several classes together. At least, until he started failing astronomy.
Dean doesn’t use the radio that night. It starts off that way, the dial turned to 99.3, until Cas casually drops the fact that he’s never even
She doesn’t even have to think about it. “There’s a field behind Mr. O’Connor’s barn,” she says straight away, “you follow the road down aways and there’s a clearing big enough to see the whole of space.” And with that she goes right back to reading her paperback. She might be hiding a smile behind it.
“Nah. It’s stupid. I don’t know why it’s gotta be some whole big deal. I mean, it’s the same old shit that goes on at every school dance, you know?”
“You got plans for Christmas?” He asks Cas, pulling the Marlboro's out of his pocket. He puts one to his lips and the lighter
Cas gives the windshield a contemplative frown. “I don’t think so. I can make up an excuse and he’ll believe it; he has no reason not to. I've never lied to him before.”
The last track on the tape is “I’m on Fire”. Dean hopes he always thinks about that night every time he hears it. God knows he does.
The engine turns over and they drift out of the parking lot, out into Lawrence again, leaving the Wild West behind them in row G of the Liberty 23 Theater.
“It’s no bother. I don’t live that far from here. ‘Sides, I can’t keep you walking in the rain.” The trailer where he and Sammy live is on the opposite side of town, all the way down past Allen Drug and the unused railroad tracks.
Cas thinks about this for a minute, Dean can tell, with the way his head is tilted to the left.  “An evening like this, I suppose.” He says eventually.
Cas is fucking fascinated. That’s the only word Dean can use to describe it; it’s a sheer amazement, like he’s some turn of the century street boy who’s stumbled his way into the circus and is seeing an elephant for the first time. He’s staring at the screen with both wonderment and awe, just the way Dean thought he would but almost better.
And it really is a good picture. Dean takes back what he thought earlier, about most movies being shit these days. This one feels special, monumental in a way he doesn’t seem to have the vocabulary to explain. It might even be one of his favorites. Leave it to Clint Eastwood to save the film industry at its darkest days, he thinks. They’re both hooked to the very end.
“No.” It matters very little to him who’s helping him out. The whole thing was stupid either way. “It don’t matter to me.”
Cas’s expression softens, turning the tape over in his hand, like it’s some sort of holy relic. “Thank you, Dean.” Even though it barely cost him a thing, it seems to be worth more than the Walkman.
Cas nods with way more seriousness than the subject merits. “Like the summary on the back of a book.”
Cas taps his fingers on his thighs when he hums along. Sometimes he closes his eyes. Dean usually believes that if you think too hard about something it will all come apart at the seams, but with Cas it’s like the more he thinks about something the more he likes it. He has this look on his face as he tries to piece the lyrics together, like “D’yer Maker” holds the meaning of the universe and he just has to decipher it, or—
“Next time?” Those words always seem to startle Cas like he’s surprised that someone who's just spent an hour with him would want to spend another one. Dean wishes he knew he’d spend just about all his hours with him if he could.
He’s grinning as he reaches into his pocket for a cigarette. He pulls out the pack, offering it to Cas, who waves him off. He shrugs and lights one up. His smoke billows out into the sky, mingling with Cas’s breath. His toes will be dead frozen by the end of the night, probably, but he doesn’t give a damn. He looks at the sky and it feels like summertime.
It’s not Castiel’s fault, of course. He was doing his best. Dean just wasn’t made out for all this shit, all these numbers and equations and formulas. He just wants to get to Bobby’s shop and under a car and do something
“Good job, Dean,” he says and Dean feels nearly as proud as he did when Bobby watched him fix his first transmission when he was fourteen.
“I am absolutely certain,” Cas says with stubborn conviction, “New York is bigger, of course, and there’s much more to be done there than in Lawrence, but I don’t belong there. It’s been almost ten years and I still feel like a stranger. All of my best memories are here: everything I know. And that’s more than enough for me.” He ducks his head down, eyes focused on the brown rings in his coffee cup. “And you’re here. Sometimes I think you’re the one thing I’ve missed most of all.”
“You know, that night at Mr. O’Connor’s barn? I should’ve kissed you then,” he says, hand on the back of his neck. God, what if Cas completely forgot about that night? What if he never feels sad or lonely or regret whenever a Springsteen song plays, never has a slushie that reminds him of matching purple mouths, never watches a Clint Eastwood movie and misses him so bad it hurts.
She’s got a full house tonight; there’s crowds of kids lounging around, looking out of place in mall-bought dresses and rented tuxedos. They’re all laughing, the tipsy kind, like they’ve pre-gamed with liquor stolen from their parents before arriving, pushing each other around for their turn on the jukebox. Dean doesn’t blame her for taking a moment away from the madness. That’s why he prefers this side of the diner himself; no one ever bothers you.
He absent-mindedly plays with the sugar packets, a habit he picked up when he was a kid. It looks like a quiet night for the diner. Some damn redneck has got that old Kitty Wells playing. Probably Tom, he thinks. He comes in at least once a week now, playing the same song on repeat ever since his wife left him in March. Sometimes Dean will catch him drinking his third beer, eyeing his plate of untouched food, mumbling along under his breath.
Work keeps him busy enough to keep his mind and hands full, and when it’s done there’s always Betty’s Diner or a six-pack and the ball game waiting for him at home. He’s reluctantly taken up watching football. It’s still not as good as baseball ever was, collecting cards as a kid in a shoebox under the bed, bought for fifty cents a pack at Walmart. He remembers combing through the parking lot for loose change until he scraped up enough dimes and nickels to buy one.
He swallowed up his pride, no matter how hard it hurt, and carried that little slip of paper all the way down to the office, down to Mrs. Smalls and those cat-eye glasses of hers she wore perched too far down the nose.
“I haven’t thought about him in years.” Benny says, roughened fingers skitting across the old shop table. Dean wonders if he ever thought about him at all. Not like he did, at least.
It’s probably only a few seconds before Cas says anything (maybe, Dean thinks, he’s still stuck on that whole Ferris Bueller thing) but it feels like a million years passing by.
They win. It wasn’t easy and by the sixth inning it became more of a bloodbath, the numbers on the scoreboard flipping back and forth, keeping the crowd as much as the team narrowed in with concentration, both sides holding their breath like the end result will determine the fate of the universe.
Dean looks around the joint, at the worn-out and beaten-down Christmas decorations and in the yellow light he wonders if Cas had somehow lost his entire fucking mind in New York. Either that, or if this was some kind of bizarre joke, like April Fool’s come too late.
He looks up at the stands and he spares a moment to scan the faces, hoping to recognize someone in the crowd. It’s impossible; they’re all blurring together and his heart is hammering too hard in his chest to concentrate.
The air in the locker room is stagnant and stiff and always smells like sweat and bleach. It makes him miss the cleanliness of the rain, the earthy smell that comes with it. Rain in Kansas isn’t the gentle kind. Storms are fierce, violent. There’s a taste in the air, like sensing the coming thunder on the tongue.
He does what Castiel says. He shows up on Tuesday with two pages, front and back, filled with questions for him. Castiel doesn’t bat an eye. He simply cracks open the textbook, turns it towards Dean, and starts to explain the concept. His patience never fails to baffle him.
“Okay.” Castiel sounds completely indifferent as he flicks the pages towards the first chapter. “Let’s go over chapter one.”
He sighs, forgetting that if Cas isn’t aware of something as simple as a movie trailer he sure as hell hasn’t been schooled in proper movie theater etiquette. “You can’t talk in movies, Cas,” he tells him, “You have to whisper.”
Dean slams on his breaks. “Shit!” They make the stop in enough time so they’re just barely crossing the white line. The click of a turn signal left on since god knows which intersection blinks on and off. Dean switches it off. He’s shaken and disoriented, waiting for the light to turn green. He should probably stop looking at Cas and look at the road. He’ll probably crash them into that stupid lamppost on 164th if he keeps this up.
It’s no better now during the holidays. Dean knows the Novaks to be a real religious bunch, but none of their kids ever seem to stop by for Thanksgiving or Christmas or any of the other days in between. It’s just Mr. Novak’s lonely old Cadillac parked at the top of that hill.
They talk mindlessly and without meaning, about the teachers they love and the classes they hate, the math homework they’ve lost sleep over and the books they read in English class that weren’t half bad. Dean finds out that Cas does talk, and quite a lot, if you bring up books. It seems he’s read every damn book on the planet. It would make him feel inadequate if it weren’t for Cas’s enthusiasm. He’s never seen him like this— actually happy for once.
Castiel cocks his head at him then, in a way Dean notices he does whenever he mentions a movie or cartoon that Castiel has never seen; it’s a look crossed between curiosity and puzzlement, like he’s standing on the outside of some joke everyone else is in on and trying to figure out how to get inside. Dean usually finds it kind of funny, but not this time. It feels almost condescending. Or maybe it’s just the reaction he was expecting; he’s still probably going to fail this class.
“They’re like, I don’t know, advertisements for movies coming up. They let you see some of the story so you can figure out whether you want to see it or not.” It feels weird to explain something as simple and banal as a movie trailer to someone. He just assumed everyone was born with that kind of knowledge.
Castiel got accepted into Havard, Dean knows that. Everybody did. At the time he was the only kid in the history of Lawrence High to get accepted into anything Ivy League, and with a full ride into pre-law at that. He was gonna be the biggest fuckin’ success story Lawrence had ever seen; he was gonna make the whole damn town proud. Hell, the principal would’ve thrown him a parade if he was able to.
Castiel shakes his head and there it is again, that ghost of a smile on his mouth. “Don’t be. I liked it.”
It’s a Thursday when it happens. He’s sitting there in the back row of Mr. Johnson’s class, feeling the slight chill that comes with sitting next to the window and staring at the white and yellow tiles on the floor as Mr. Johnson’s footsteps make their way across the room, handing out their latest graded test. The room is dead silent. Scattered raindrops make their way down the window. The last thing he wants is to see that way he nearly folds the paper in half in his hand when he hands it back to him, trying to obscure the grade from anyone’s vision. It was a useless trick; everyone knew that if you got your test handed back that way you definitely failed and were probably an idiot. At least, that’s the way it always felt to Dean.
“Thanks for coming.” He hopes he knows that he means that. Really, truly. From the look on his face it seems like he does.
“Hey, you hungry?” Dean asks, taking a left at the intersection, “‘Cause I’m starvin’. Why don’t we stop by Betty’s for something to eat?”
Dean dropped out in April. He wasn’t eighteen yet, but Sammy was getting into high school soon and someone had to pay the bills, keep the heat on and electricity running. Dad used to help cover most of it, sending money from wherever the fuck he was or more often leaving a wad on the table without so much as a goodbye, never leaving a number so they had to fend for themselves when the cash ran out.
He looks at Dean with an odd look on his face. It’s a happy kind, but somewhat faraway, somewhat removed. He looks like the old drunks at the Roadhouse reminiscing about their long-ago ‘glory days’, swapping stories they’ve heard a thousand times over and never tire of.
The snow is sticking out in the parking lot. Some of it, mostly the bits around the streetlights, is more slush than snow and Dean kicks at it, grimacing. The roads will be ice tomorrow, probably. There’s a fierce wind blowing and Dean turns his collar up against it.
He doesn’t even bother to drink the coke he made Dean buy him. He does quite literally nothing but watch the movie; it’s almost like he doesn’t even move.
The remaining cars belong to coaches and some stray players who are probably smoking weed somewhere in the far end behind the dumpster. Most of his own teammates are on their way to Betty’s Diner for a celebratory round of burgers and fries. It sounds delicious with all the hunger he has. Every game leaves him ravenous, ready to down a whole pie by himself, maybe with a milkshake added on, until he feels sick. He loves Betty’s pie no matter how many times he’s thrown it up. But right now he likes the taste of slushie and over-salted pretzel better.
“Trailers?” Cas is still wearing that trench coat. Dean warned him it would be a little cool in the theater and, Cas being Cas, he took it to heart, bringing not only the coat, but also a pair of gloves and a sweater (
The sun starts to set golden in the sky. The breeze becomes cooler, heavier. Dean is glad he didn’t take Benny up on his offer to join the rest of the team at the diner. He wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.
“You really sure this is the place you want to be?” Dean asks. He always knew he was destined to end up one of the Roadhouse drunks; hell, he even has a favorite spot and the bartender has his order memorized, but he thought Cas was destined for bigger and better things. Dean’s legacy would always be reduced to the few plaques that lined the Lawrence High hallways; Cas was supposed to conquer the world.
Cas, with a mischievous look Dean’s never seen before, reaches across the table and skewers the final bite with his fork. He’s swallowing it down before Dean can do anything about it.
“I could’ve saved it for later, Dean.” It’s hard to take him seriously with barbecue sauce on his chin.
Have a nice night, y’all,” she says with a smile. They force theirs and leave like criminals, silent and edgy as they make their way through the cool evening in the parking lot.
The whole place is covered with Christmas decorations now, all looking worse for wear, with the chipped and fading ornaments hanging from threadbare tree branches, the dust clinging to the plastic mistletoe hung above the doorway. Those moth-eaten red velvet ribbons on the booths. Even the
He steps into Dean’s line and it hits him right then, how much he misses him. He didn’t think much of him before, too busy calling the electric company for an extension or hassling with the landlord about rent to really think about much else besides getting through the day. But just seeing his face, man; the sadness dumps over him like a bucket of cold water to the face.
Castiel startles in his chair, head whipping up as the doorknob smacks into the wall. He relaxes, sees the test in Dean’s hands, and offers him what Dean thinks is pretty damn close to a smile.
Right now his heart is in his throat, which feels drier than bone, and thinks he might be close to vomiting, but he is ecstatic. He’s a goddamn winner. He watches the crowd go wild, his chest heaving in and out and smiling like it was the fucking World Series and not a small town baseball game in the middle of nowhere. He likes to think he can hear Cas cheering among the throng of voices. He feels his teammates' hands as they clap him on the back.
He holds it at an awkward angle at first, carefully trying to bite into it and avoid making a mess, but it’s futile; there’s sauce all over his mouth. There’s even a little bit on his nose. Dean thinks he can see a ketchup stain on the sleeve of the trench coat. Eventually, he gives up and just lets the mess happen. His plate is covered in the remnants: loose onion slices, mustard, and a lone pickle. When it’s gone he gets to work on his fries, downing them like it’s his last meal and draining his coke until there’s only ice left in the cup.
“I’ve never seen them so bright, not even with my telescope. They’re beautiful.” Cas is awestruck, gazing at the sky in wonderment, looking ready to reach up and grab the moon.
“This is beautiful,” Cas says near the end when the guitar takes over, the iconic riff setting the background to his voice. Dean likes the way Cas listens to music, with a seriousness akin to that of figuring out a particularly difficult math problem. It’s a complete, devoted focus. Most people don’t respect music that way anymore, but Cas does.
Benny shrugs, leaning against the work table, drinking the leftovers of this morning's coffee from a styrofoam cup. Dean grimaces. That coffee was burnt this morning; he can’t imagine what it tastes like now. Benny just tosses it back and Dean wonders if there’s any Jack in it. Wonders if he’d share.
“Dean?” Cas looks like a drowned duckling, dark hair matted down and argyle sweater dripping, and Dean would have laughed if he didn’t look so miserable.
It seems that his musical repertoire starts with Bach and ends at Gershwin. He said his dad never liked the ‘immorality of rock’n’roll’, exactly like that, like he was some old-timey Baptist preacher. The only music he listens to are church hymns or stuff with long titles that include words like ‘sonata’ and ‘concerto’. He’s never even owned a
, and turns on the radio instead. They’re playing the goddamn Doors. He switches the channel to 105.9. He’s never been so glad to hear shitty pop music in his whole life but it’s still no use; not even Vanessa Williams can get it off his mind. He feels that cool dread still, the shaky arms of unused adrenaline, heart still halfway in his throat. He swerves out of the way of that fucking lamppost on 164th, the goddamn thing popping out of nowhere and, fuck!
When the food is done and cleared out of the way, Dean grabs the present he’s been keeping next to him in the booth. It’s not wrapped but he doesn’t think Cas will care.
He’s overwhelmed then with the idea that there will be no later. That they’ll go back to courtesy ‘hello’s’ in the hallways and their tutoring sessions that are so full with concepts to learn that it leaves little time for much else.
. Cas said that every afternoon getting into his car. Dean thought it was funny, the formality of it all. It doesn’t feel funny anymore. It feels like he’s lost something invaluable, something he can never get back.
Sometimes when he’s out driving, out to Betty’s Diner or back home, he passes the Novak house on the top of the hill. It’s been stiller than a tomb since Castiel up and moved out. It seems so empty that sometimes passersby inquire whether or not it’s for sale, looming over the town like a gothic mansion from a book he once read in the tenth grade.
“Not really,” Cas replies, pulling his trench coat a little tighter around him. He must be freezing.
“Hm,” she says, setting it down and rolling around on her office chair to grab a piece of paper from the swarm that surrounded her desk, “You have a particular time you’re looking for?”
Dean uses this concentration and diverted attention to take the long way home. They loop around Mr. O’Connor’s barn twice. Cas doesn’t notice. He feels somewhat guilty for taking so long, wondering if Cas is going to get into trouble for staying out this late, but he doesn’t want to stop. He wants the road to go on forever and the tape to never run out. He wants to keep smelling the near burnt smell of the heater, those faint hints of air freshener, and the musty smell of old car. He wants to keep Zeppelin playing, maybe The Rolling Stones, maybe even the Doors. He bets Cas would like them. And Cas, most of all Cas, he wants to be there. He likes him sitting there in the passenger seat, likes looking over at him at red lights and trying to read his expressions as they change along with the music. He almost hits that damn lamppost on 164th looking at him. Cas isn’t shaken as Dean swerves the car out of its way, cursing the whole goddamn city planning committee under his breath.
“I don’t think I’ll be able to,” he says and Dean deflates, “My father is still upset with me returning late from the baseball game. I don’t think he would let me go.”
so loud his speaker might go out and this time he’s not running from a damn thing. The light at the four-way is red when “I’m On Fire” comes on, his windshield wipers swishing back and forth against the snow as he waits for the light to turn green.
The trailers are for a bunch of dumb shit Dean couldn’t care about but might end up watching later out of boredom. There’s always a comedy, a romance, and an action film, and they always look terrible. Maybe they won’t be as bad as they seem; who knows? Good entertainment is hard to come by these days.
“I’m looking forward to it. Thank you for inviting me,” he says with genuine sincerity, like Dean is the one doing him a favor.
“I’m not missing my chance this time,” he says. And with that he does what he should’ve done fifteen years ago and kisses Cas.
“So? How’s life going? No one knows what the hell you’ve been up to these last few years. You’ve been kind of radio-silence here, man.” Dean is working on a hot batch of fries. Betty brought him his favorite burger and the side of fries that come with it, crispy, just like he likes them. He traded his coke for coffee a few years back, but he’s still waiting on that pie that comes at the end of the meal. Some things are better when they don’t change at all.
Dean whips his head up so fast he almost whacks it against the side mirror of the car he was waxing— someone’s flashy red convertible taken for a joy ride gone bad with plenty of bruises to show for it. He’s got it as good as it can get now, spent so many hours on it that he’s dreading handing over the keys to that out of town rich fuck who’s son he knows will total her the moment he gets back behind the wheel.
“I’m never going to pass this class,” he says one Thursday afternoon, a headache making itself apparent as they try to cover chapter four. He pushes the textbook away from him. It’s only been ten minutes and his attention is already slipping. He feels bad about it; he can see the way Castiel is trying to hold back his irritation on his face. Still, he can’t seem to care.
