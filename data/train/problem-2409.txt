The doorbell had rung, and his wife had gone to open it. As their little girl was sleeping in her room, he had continued to work in his office and thought he had heard voices that he recognised.
“Ah-ah, don’t be
Maybe Mycroft was a dragon, too.
He broke out of it soon enough, though, berating himself for it. There were other things of greater importance to do.
John, however, had been not only in a harem for more than a few years – before Sherlock decided to play cat burglar and ended up practically drugged with Rut – he’d been in the army before that and medical school before that.
“Oh, no, not at all. In fact, you have been in my thoughts quite extensively as of late.”
It was nothing ground breaking, but it was more…emotional than the first text.
“Any particular reason that name rather than a million others, you mean? No, not really…nothing interesting, anyway. No skeletons in the closet or anything. Just a name that I liked.”
It was the doctor’s turn to stare then blink. He smiled at that, an echo of the smile that Sherlock had been hoping for, longing for.
Frowning a little, in annoyance and certainly not in alarm, Sherlock intensified his search, sifting through the throng of unimportant scents and presences faster and faster to locate the one that he’d grown so accustomed to.
How when it seemed as though there was nothing more to him to discover or be surprised by, he shifted and did something unexpected, which in turn shifted the perspective on what had come before.
There was also the scent bond and the sense of home that the flat had seemed to emanate for him from the time he’d first set foot here.
Sherlock stole a kiss.
‘Against me or them?’
Through it all, John kept an eye on Sherlock, to see how he fared. It wasn’t that he expected the Alpha to take the other down or anything like that. He just…wanted to make doubly sure. Mostly because he himself was having a hard time, a surprisingly hard time, allowing the officer to as much as touch the teddy, never mind manhandling it.
Even now, he could close his eyes and inhale and it’d be her scent that he could smell and nothing else. That scent wouldn’t be gone, however old she got, at least not to him as her birthparent. He’d recognise her on that alone if needed.
“…Some of the time.”
Thankfully, John went on speaking after another moment or two.
It was loosened yet simultaneously tightened by the next words. “It would be the height of foolishness to put yourself down merely because the issues you face might superficially resemble the problems of fusspots.”
That shut the Alpha up well and good, his jaw almost clicking. His head, which had been turned away, snapped back to look behind him.
Should he tell him? It might be a bit too odd for John, and he didn’t want to alienate him. On the other hand, it was important to him, that was really all that mattered.
One thing he did know, though, for absolutely certain, was that it was an entirely moot point one way or the other if Sherlock never regained consciousness.
He had to shift in his seat to get comfortable, for once grateful for the rubbish tables low height.
Something about hearing Mycroft utter the word ‘carnal’, fitting for the man’s vocabulary as it was, made the doctor’s insides shudder hard. Not quite as bad as the first time he’d heard Harry discuss her sex life in detail, of course, but still…
“I…no. I don’t. If he does, it will be to get to you and nothing more, and there are several other effective ways to do that. That he wrote a comment on a piece of paper with details on what could be her and nothing more is….” He trailed off for a moment. “He will get the same effect from you by just alluding to it rather than following through.”
That was how it should be. How he always hoped it would be and what he would fight to make sure it was.
Their challenge was that of every new parent.
He let the hand on the jaw slide slowly upward in a gesture he meant to be comforting and understanding. Saying something out loud would likely not be particularly appreciated. Not considering his earlier response, at least.
It didn’t squeeze or do anything else, but it touched him, intentionally, on one of those very places he’d thought about, the hand.
“Right.” John smiled. “See you a little later, then.”
How could it be anything else? It was a dragon. That was its nature. To take and to claim, anything and everything, including everyone, that it deemed worthy of its time and its claim. Then, as soon as it had it, it wanted more. Always more. Consuming and consuming.
Sherlock smiled and while it wasn’t the slightly grotesque parody it had been when he’d been in the clutches of his dragon side, it was still unsettling in its completely lack of mirth.
Good.
Whenever that later might be, if at all.
Further highlighted when the question that came then couldn’t quite manage to sound haughty and unaffected. Instead, it was demanding.
“Yeah…yeah, I’m okay with this,” he said, nodding slightly as he did so.
But this? All of this…madness, for lack of a better word that sufficiently encapsulated everything that had happened in the last however many hours had passed since he’d stormed out, that had most certainly everything to do with the Irish madman.
Hell, if Sherlock could improve and better himself at his age, over a relatively short period of time, then it should be…not easy, such things were never easy, even he knew that. But it ought to be doable, at least, and with relatively little issue afterwards.
“Other than be a nuisance?”
Not getting riled up by the other’s words and attempts to get under his skin was one thing – that he hadn’t quite managed that was something to berate himself for later, provided there was going to
Sensing something was wrong, he refrained from calling out to his wife, so as not to immediately give away his presence to the intruders – never mind the fact that they would have been perfectly aware of him, especially if they were indeed who Sherlock believed them to be – and had tiptoed his way from his office into their daughter’s room.
He had to hope, though, had to
“I want you to be part of my life, John, and to know that…that I am committed to this. To our relationship. I’m not going to get bored or reconsider this whole relationship thing, not now nor later. That I can take the initiative, too, rather than…”
suddenly feel mentally fuzzy? That didn’t make any – it wasn’t him who’d been wounded and was now suffering, not just from that but possibly something else that Mycroft wasn’t telling him about.
His voice was friendly enough, but it held a note of quiet command that expected to be obeyed.
“I never said I wasn’t a hypocrite,” Sherlock said with a sniff.
He was proven right when he walked past the nurse to the door and the man moved, almost instinctively, aside to let him through. Sherlock followed, silently, slipping past the man and closing the door behind them.
He shook the blond’s shoulder.
And what she would face if she stayed? Not a happy childhood, either.
with him, was something that he honestly hadn’t seen coming, something which, quite frankly, floored him.
And she wanted to do it right, too. You could tell in the frown on her face, the pull of her mouth that occasionally became a bitten lip, and the lost, pleading look deep in her eyes. Sherlock wondered if anyone else saw that or otherwise noticed. Perhaps they knew that instinctively whereas he had to actively notice and think about it.
“How long could you bear to wait?”
Sherlock nodded, once. Then he closed his eyes, brief but hard, before he evidently forced them back open.
Then again, he
Was that it? That seemed rather obvious, though, so could it…well, perhaps in hindsight it did look obvious, but that wasn’t to say it otherwise would.
But why would Sherlock do that?
He removed just one hand from their position still on bony cheeks to, unexpectedly, reach up and brush an errant curl from the brunet’s forehead in what, though Sherlock was not an expert, could be called a tender gesture.
Something moved at the nearest window, which of course was rather large. Despite himself, Sherlock looked in that direction and was more startled than he wanted to admit to see a familiar icy-pale eye with slitted pupil stare in at him through it. It was a whole lot larger than he would’ve imagined, had he allowed himself to imagine that kind of thing.
He might even look forward to the wedding itself.
He then said, perfectly seriously, “John, it’s either you showing me or me rummaging through the bag regardless – “
“You’re bickering with me.”
of it not only dwarfed him but sent tremors through him.
More than that, Sherlock had believed him. Once he stopped and thought about it, he realised that he still did.
Nevertheless, John went through the living room, checking once again after he’d switched the lights on, which was something of a hop and dance, what with the mishmash of light sources they’d accrued, and down the hall to the bedroom that had become theirs rather than Sherlock’s.
And yes, I do realise that his plan isn't actually expounded upon. :)
To say that that hadn’t been the case here was an understatement on the scale of calling Moriarty ‘a bit strange’ or even ‘not quite right’.
So, much as he’d like to do that, or preferably worse, he had to contend himself with merely standing, slowly and carefully, and turning around to face the Irishman, who was standing right behind him, as he’d been able to feel throughout this whole encounter.
John let himself be pulled down for another kiss but he kept it brief, mostly so that he wouldn’t get distracted. Then he trailed his lips to the side, over warm stubble that he lightly nuzzled with his lips and his own stubble before moving on up slowly along the jawline until he reached an ear which he gently nibbled the earlobe of.
They might be in the middle of the street, more or less, and it might be that they had more to do than they had time to do it in, but that didn’t matter. Or rather, it did, but this mattered more.
What I meant was, how do we plan practising? I know you’re brilliant at playing the violin and I’m not bad at the guitar, and it’s not the entire song that’s both instruments but – “
That it was a small airport they were going did help a little in that regard.
One other thing that certainly fit right in with the stereotype was the smell. Unlike with other Alphas, where that might have translated into pure cockiness, here it seemed to further emphasise the power and inherent danger of the man.
“Never mind that right now.”
As soon as the thought to propose entered his head and settled itself down, there was no getting rid of it. It was stuck, and he would always wonder until he either did it or things broke apart after all, despite what he’d wanted to accomplish by not proposing. That it wouldn’t break apart was option but not one that seemed viable. At least, not as viable as he would want it, or he’d believed it to be earlier.
This was
But exactly because of the situation they were in, it had felt rather cathartic to laugh. He did manage to hold it in, though. Somehow.
“John Watson,” the Omega offered by way of identification and password.
Shifting his belt around a little so he could have his hand on the hilt of the knife while he walked, and it would merely look like he had his hand in his pocket, he drew in a deep breath and set off.
That thought sent a frozen lump into the pit of his stomach. No. He wouldn’t – that wasn’t his intention. That had never been his intention. Not now nor when Tessa came home or when the twins were born. He would protect John from every possible thing that he could, without question or hesitation, if that was necessary, as John was more than capable of looking after himself as well. But that didn’t entail shielding him from the world.
Another crash and finally it registered in John’s mind what it had been he’d heard crashing. It wasn’t items in the room – now knowing what he was and what that entailed, the room seemed oddly spartan in its decoration – smashing to the ground because the two dragons were fighting and knocking things over.
That brought a smile out on Sherlock’s own lips; he could easily imagine the look on his brother’s face if he did indeed show up with that. But he didn’t much care for the implications of it and so his smile disappeared almost as soon as it had appeared.
He couldn’t…but he could lose John and that was why he couldn’t lose him. Couldn’t risk it.
“I’m as much to blame as you are.”
chance at getting their dreams fulfilled.
He paused to grab the bony hand again and squeeze it. “It doesn’t matter what the circumstances are, Alphas tend towards the same reactions, born out of the same instincts, especially when their partner, Omega or Beta, has been impregnated.”
“This isn’t exactly designed for twins but it’s quite the roomy, practical nappy bag that can either be worn as a backpack or be turned and clip onto the handle of the stroller,” they said as they picked it up and turned to him. “The changing mat isn’t the thickest available, but it should be more than sufficient for most needs on the go.”
Which of course made it possible that that was what John was doing, too, and he was merely too deep in denial to realise it.
The white-green eyes seemed to glint in satisfaction. Well, that was good, wasn’t it? That he was pleasing –
“Are you…?” How did he finish that sentence? He could see that he wasn’t fine or even okay, far from it. ‘Going to survive’ seemed somewhat overly dramatic. Change of question, then. “What do you need?”
They hadn’t brought it up again.
A hand on his arm hitched his breath. Then, spite prodding him yet again, he opened his eyes and looked down.
The shake of the head Sherlock gave was quick and vigorous.
His eyes didn’t outwardly widen but the surprise was still there. Both from right outside the window, tangible for the given value that it could have, and down, down where the dragon still was.
“You will tell me?” he found himself asking instead, then, quietly and just a little bit uncertainly.
“…you’re mixing up your metaphors.”
In fact, it almost felt…well, not quite normal but something approaching it. A point where the abovementioned hope could flourish.
Would he?
In any case, his focus was elsewhere. Namely on the screen which showed a rather grainy image that was almost impossible to make sense of.
He then got a look at what clothes they, or rather Sherlock, had gathered for him and immediately balked.
“Long to stay on the phone if you didn’t care at all.” The voice sounded almost hurt now, in a way that’d probably be believable, if it’d been anyone else. Then it changed, dropping to a hiss. “Do you really think the only thing I’m capable of is bombing people?”
A sight that he couldn’t make sense of.
“Me too,” he said, so quiet that it was as well they were as close as they were but no less sincere for the quietness.
She hadn’t moved, of course, but her eyes were still closed, in a way indicating proper unconsciousness rather than a feigned one, but when he held a hand over her parted mouth, the breath felt indicated she was alive, too.
It was John who made up something about there having been a call straight afterwards, which had then been sent through to them. The warm, easy smile and the aura around him right then that practically screamed ‘I’m a doctor, I am trustworthy’ was more than enough to sell it, even over his not-quite-perfect French.
Perhaps that applied to dragons, too. Even if, unlike the compound nature of ‘werewolf’, the name ‘dragon’ only applied to the shape traditionally associated with it, that didn’t entail that they were only dragons in nature when they shared the shape.
“You would if it would get you what you wanted.”
“Interference which means your bond mate is far closer than he has ever been to finding out where his daughter is!”
“But you can do it?” It was intended to be merely a question, but it came out with an edge of captain.
“Like hell it is!”
John stiffened a little further at that but didn’t otherwise react, keeping the same stance as before.
At least John didn’t bother denying it. “I’ve got it. Took when I – shit, I’m sorry. I should’ve thought about – about anything, really. I just…I needed to get away. Didn’t even think and I should’ve thought – “
Arms encircled his waist as the blond turned in his chair and somehow, the brunet found himself in the other’s lap, folded up and around the shorter figure as they kissed and just enjoyed the nearness of the other.
“As I am well aware, Doctor. However, you must understand that while my concern for both my brother is boundless and for yourself, too…I still have to be exceptionally careful.”
Easy as anything, wasn’t it?
“Somehow, I sincerely doubt that.” His voice was just as tight when it came.
They started walking again, Sherlock in the lead, but with John so close behind that they were almost side by side, despite the former’s longer legs.
“Shame you were caught by someone who sees you as a possession, and your daughter, too.”
“It’s not just Mycroft that believes that.”
What? Oh. “No, not the watch. That’s…I’ll get to that. The things you’ve taken home from cases and such.”
idea that I would change my mind, not to mention after everything I’ve bloody well said?” John snapped.
He looked horrified as he stared at the doctor, and while John would normally be incredibly offended that someone who’d kissed him had that kind of reaction, now…well, to be perfectly honest, he couldn’t deny that it did hurt quite a lot.
Pull yourself together, you ludicrous lump of a lizard. You’re supposed to be the clever one here, after all, not someone incapable of only broken sentences and someone’s name.
Even so, there was a gap so wide it was a gulf between their normal helter-skelter experiences and the associated fun, and the complete upside-down experience of discovering not just that dragons were real or that Moriarty was one – the realisation that Molly’s boyfriend was the criminal mastermind seemed almost incidental in comparison – but that he seemed genuinely interested in collecting John and that Sherlock, who was another dragon rather than just a lanky git with a penchant for nicking stuff, had an interest in laying a claim, as well.
“Don’t assume what I do and don’t want to hear, please,” the blond said, his voice more than a bit tight. Then he seemed to shake himself and visibly relaxed, even though he hadn’t looked outright tense before. “Sorry, that was…you were only trying to be understanding and considerate, I know – and please don’t say I was justified in that tone of voice.”
That was in the very back of his mind, though. The rest of his mind was occupied with the tableau in front of him, which had somehow slowed down to almost a standstill.
‘Why do you? Why does anyone play? Because I like it. It’s fun. I get to learn things, some of which are difficult, because I feel like it when I feel like it, not because someone tells me I ought to.’
“Hm. Lucky for you, then, that I’m in such a good, charitable mood right now.”
His gaze lingered, perhaps slightly pointedly, on where the bond bite was still visible above the collar of John’s t-shirt, the same not exactly well-fitted one he’d arrived at 221B in.
Once up the stairs and into the living room, the front door of the flat was closed right behind them. It didn’t sport the same array of miscellaneous locking mechanisms as the building’s front door but what it did have was slid and nudged into position, the noises audible and distinctive to the blond.
(See the end of the chapter for
What Sherlock had been about to say only to change his mind wasn’t difficult to at least hazard a guess at. Not the insult, though, the other part. John swallowed.
He frowned and narrowed his eyes, the confusion of exhaustion born by too much to do, not enough time and a stubborn refusal to take the rest that he needed making him just a little bit hazy on some of the details. Such as how much time exactly had passed. Minor things.
‘No. No, you should. I meant – never mind.’
That and it was the place where there were most of the new and otherwise uncategorised and sorted emotions and reactions to sift through, which would make it the largest and also the most fertile ground.
However, he’d lingered in the doorway and glanced back at the figure in the bed, looking…not exactly small, or weak but…and it looked wrong.
Especially not seeing as there was a man who wanted to do them harm waiting just on the other side of the street, or possibly even closer than that.
But in the end, he’d never gotten further than a few kisses and half a hand job before he’d felt the need to claim them, to sink his teeth in and make them part of his treasure for good. It had turned out that rather than circumventing the needy hunger, he’d actually only managed to stoke it and focus it on the more carnal aspects, which in turn only served to fuel said lust.
He got a bloody wonderful and prolonged snog out of it, too.
And yay...more talking...at this point, it feels redundant and like too little to apologise. Still, I do - and for probably the next chapter, too, just in advance.
Sherlock could feel the energy, which had snapped, yes, but hadn’t dissipated, trying to pull the rope apart as it ran along it, testing and challenging his willpower with that of the dragon’s, trying to push him out and make it snap.
Whether it was his words that did it or just the brunet’s body finally overcome and shutting down, John had no idea but whatever the case, Sherlock complied.
What if she took him up on them, after all?
“I meant your apologising, John. There was no need to apologise, then or before, and therefore, I’m not hearing it.”
What? Oh.
“I’ve told you that countless times, already.”
Corpses were a different thing altogether, as what was once a person became another object, which was part of the reason Moriarty’s system worked for him, for a given value of the term. It wasn’t the same solution as Mycroft’s because a body would continue to decay and rot, from a body to a rotting corpse to a skeleton to fragments.
Little blue eyes flickered up to look at Sherlock, then, more intensely and for longer than she had the first two times she had looked at him.
“Noticed what, exactly?”
“Sherlock, please…if you’re awake, would you please open your eyes and look at me?”
to do it, because my English teacher is blackmailing me about it.”
“But they are more intelligent than the everyman.”
Yes. That sounded like a plan. A good plan, even, and that was what he would do.
Even the smaller scheme of things, honestly.
“So, you’d be able to tell whether the coat is – “
Not – well, yes, he supposed, to a certain extent, that was…but not really. Sherlock still listened mostly to himself.
Then again, it was possible that it wasn’t John Sherlock was looking for, that his focus was on the possible dangers and on a lookout for Moriarty. That had to be why he was here, after all, the case and the confrontation with the one who had him so fascinated. Probably hadn’t even clocked that the blond had been kidnapped rather than having merely stormed off, so really, there’d be no reason for him to look for John, here or anywhere else.
John blinked at himself.
want to kiss
Yes, things would progress well and on track once he’d gotten this ruddy concert out of the way.
“You what? No! Why?”
The brunet shook his head. “You swear but that’s roughly the extent of it.” He paused and wet his lips, looking both excited and a little bit out of his depth, which was sweet and also, surprisingly, a little stimulating.  “And you certainly haven’t ever said any of those words in relation to
Mycroft looked at him then looked over at his brother, the shivers and the breathing that was just about visible the only indicators of life. Well, that and the continued grip on John’s wrist. His demeanour softened a little.
“Positive. Notwithstanding recent behaviour, obviously.” He meant it to come out light and joking but instead, it came out somewhat pleading.
Nor was the person Moriarty, who was, if John had expected it to be anybody else, or at least one his instincts would go on alert for, the one he’d have expected.
For a fleeting moment, John had the horrible thought that he was about to be gutted right there and then. Then the idea that the man, dragon,
Even though it would mean he had to reach inside himself, to use a hackneyed but nevertheless true phrase, and check, something he was leery of, to say the least.
‘Then I should advice you to find something else to use for the purpose.’
John started to giggle.
“John?” he asked a few moments later, his voice very low and soft. Hopeful.
John did.
“You berk,” he said, and his tone was beyond fond. “I was bloody afraid you’d been kidnapped or something when I first saw that message on the bed. Then you send me running across the entire city after things, for no good reason, apparently, and without any logic to it, either.”
“You thought so earlier,” Sherlock pointed out, voice gone quiet and more sincere. “When we got back here, after…you thought what I claimed was people, just like Moriarty does, albeit without eventually killing them. If you thought that, you would’ve walked out there and then. You were rather…adamant as well as angry that I only seemed to value you as a possession.”
It didn’t get a laugh or even a chuckle, but Sherlock suspected John wasn’t expecting it to. It was more of a band-aid, a bridging tactic more than anything.
it, now was there?
He gave a small huff of unamused laughter with another step. ”Then again, Sherlock’s taken an ashtray before now, and a tiepin, too, to add to his collection. That’s what all the kleptomania’s really been about, isn’t it? Appeasing the inner dragon.”
Sherlock did that even when it was all normal, relatively speaking, of course, but he’d started to scale down on it even in the time John had known him, possibly because this was such a new reality for both of them, and the younger brother was seeing the elder in a new light.
“Of course, I don’t, you imbe – of course, I don’t. You…I’d never want that.”
But given that, they were damned regardless and as such…no, that wasn’t it. That wasn’t the truth. The truth was that he’d give Sherlock the moment and the reassurance he needed, regardless of whether there was time for it or not.
“Sherlock? Oi, stay with me here. You’re not allowed to run out on me while staying perfectly immobile. Not right now.”
A small part of the brunet noted John’s customized insult and tucked it in with the hope that John might still stay, fuelling it.
There was no hatred to be seen there, though that might simply be as not to give the Irishman the satisfaction.
The face falling was because John was hurt but it went beyond the hurt of a friend, didn’t it? Because he had said something, hadn’t he?
“Would figure, otherwise you wouldn’t be that long-lived.”
Yet there was no doubt of his intentions towards John. Not in Sherlock’s mind, at any rate. John didn’t want to see it, not that the younger Holmes could blame him, but that didn’t mean they weren’t there.
Whichever the case, he could feel his hackles rise at the way the other looked at John, feel his instincts threatening to take over. Take control.
Growth spurts were a thing, though.
She followed his movements with her eyes but nothing else seemed to move. No, that wasn’t quite right; her lips were moving, too, but the movement was small enough to be difficult to make out from any distance.
He got a sigh. “Never mind. Point is, you’re never touching someone if you don’t have to and it isn’t accidental.”
A doctor? Sherlock’s mind, whether helpfully or more likely not, pieced together an image of how John might look some years down the line, when he’d qualified – and then one in his uniform.
It might be that he was being tricked, of course, with the nature of dragons and everything that had happened, but it didn’t feel that way. If that had been within the vocabulary, as it were, it felt likely that he’d have employed it much sooner, feral reaction or not.
It wasn’t as though he was afraid to confront or disturb them. Of course, he wasn’t. He just wasn’t stupid and really didn’t want to become part of their argument, either as a buffer or a pawn. That and he felt slightly stupid for the previous spying through keyholes, as it were.
“Experience?” Sherlock asked, sounding as though he just realised that he’d stepped into a touchy subject area.
“I have,” the doctor said and was simultaneously astonished and not surprised at all to find that he meant it, too. But he had, hadn’t he? Several times over, really, and not just through this, either.
As though I would be influenced by something as pathetic and dependent as that. Look at how he’s needed you for his life, for something to give it meaning and purpose. For you to provide him with excitement and thrill, all that he had been missing in his life since he came home a cripple, while at the same time providing him with something to fuss over and take care of.
, had they? What they’d seen, what they’d expected and wanted, that had been the unassuming yet charming doctor, who wore comfortable clothes, was safe and could be brought home to the parents for Christmas dinner.
“Know that was what you were really asking?” John asked in turn. “Whether I feel safe around you still and if you’ve done something while you’ve slept that you cannot undo? Good question. The answer is simple, though.”
That was a very important point to both.
John shook his head, lightly. “No. That’s trust.”
Then there was the issue of Moriarty. Sherlock had been right, they wouldn’t have seen the last of him, not when he’d showed such an interest in John, before his pregnancy and Sherlock, and Mycroft had promised his little brother that he’d deal with it.
He didn’t linger but moved further down, kissing his way down until he got to the curve of the belly. Here he halted so he could splay his hands across the expanse of it while he went into a crouch. Then he pressed his face into it gently.
John blinked and the corners of his lips twitched as though some muscles wanted to form a smile, but the rest adamantly refused to and so it was stuck somewhere in between.
“Whenever you’re ready to tell me, you tell me. If you’re ever ready,” he amended. “If you’re not, then that’s fine and I’m still here. Okay? I’m still here, whatever you choose.”
If he didn’t want to hear it spread about his own secondary gender, then he ought to rise above such assumptions the other way, too, especially considering how he’d behaved previously.
He looked up at the blond, blinking. “Sorry?”
But it meant that while he was capable of fighting, and at an estimate both quite good at it and quite used to it, he would’ve had to curb some of that inner brutality that came so easily to a certain type of Alpha. Not enough, possibly, but enough so that he wouldn’t lunge immediately and would be likely to use techniques that John had learned, too. There would be time to work out a better strategy, as well, all of which he could use to his advantage.
And John was full of little tics and gestures, normally, in terms of his face but also his body, giving himself away in all sorts of ways, small and big, without the smallest need to rely on his scent to get there.
But just because he
That wasn’t what stole most of his attention, however. That was reserved for the expression on his friend’s face. Or at least, it was for the split second he got to register it before his head was pulled forward swiftly and Sherlock’s lips almost crashed into his, kissing him as though his life depended upon it.
“What, you think there might be a connection?” he asked, his voice a teeny bit strangled.
“I don’t know, Sherlock,” the Omega said, his tone odd, and for a split second, the Alpha was bewildered and, more importantly, scared of what that meant, exactly.
blackmailed, though.” He sounded sincere.
Sherlock didn’t deny it. “No. I don’t believe he will, but that is not at all a certainty and I think he could, if he wanted to. Moriarty isn’t a madman, but neither is he entirely sane. He may tip one way, or he might tip the other. He is brilliant, though.”
He deleted the image with a ferocity that not even the most stubborn of thoughts and images would be able to cling on.
Only to end up with his hand grabbed and pulled forward, the grip on it not only hard but so that the joints where the carpals met the metacarpals were squeezed together.
Apropos of holes, he also found the hole the bullet had made in the membrane, running his finger gently around it rather than pushing it through, which Sherlock was grateful for. That said, it elicited another small shiver.
now, relative speaking, at least. Even the curve of his belly had yet to take on the tell-tale firm roundness of a pregnancy, at least not so much that, with a jacket over it, it couldn’t pass for a bit of a potbelly.
possibly even at the same time as well added something nauseating to the whole memory. Especially since it seemed to be a genuine one…
That said, he had no intention of letting John carry that burden. Even with just the added weight of the few extra dragon-related appendages, John, strong though the smaller body was, wouldn’t be able to carry him all the way back to Baker Street and getting a cab wasn’t an alternative, and not just because of the time issue.
who’d like as not have his arms deep in something, in someone.
“What part of this do you fail to understand? Or do you just care that little about what I say?”
What the hell did the man
But that was…if it were like that, then…but it couldn’t.
“It was triggered by an unplanned emotional reaction,” Sherlock pointed out.
To be honest, all he could feel right then was sadness for the poor Omegas who’d ended up victims of the man. There wasn’t even the hope or the fear that he’d put them in that situation because even he knew that he wouldn’t have made a blind bit of difference, especially not since he knew the Alpha would’ve used proxies to buy them. Sherlock hadn’t said, either, that they were harem Omegas, come to that.
Only, he didn’t get to pull back that far; before he’d gotten even halfway back to an upright position, he was grabbed. Not by his hands or his shoulders. Not even his throat but his face, the bony, clawed hands coming up to frame it in a way that was far gentler than anything Sherlock had done since he’d fallen comatose.
What didn’t help was Sherlock’s expression at that, just about readable even upside down.
John’s lips curved into a wry half-smile as he put a finger on cupid bow lips. “I know, I’m sorry. Just being a self-deprecating arse, really. To be honest, I’m grateful that you will, and the less risk I have of running into Moriarty, the better.”
“Not…no, I wouldn’t have said so,” Sherlock replied, unusually contemplative and reflective. “Certainly not at the time but neither would I say it now that I know what it means and entails.”
For the desired reaction and solution, then yes, it will have to be that which set it off. That which he specifically selected.”
“Right.” Another pause. “Thank you, Mycroft. Again. Seems like I can’t go five minutes without – “
Didn’t mean he wasn’t going to, of course, but that was another matter.
least, given that he’d fought with Sherlock for some time and though both had emerged in one piece, the doctor had an inkling that that had more to do with their apparent ability to withstand injury and, when they were hit, to heal faster than any human than anything else.
He, Sherlock, was going on logic and what his senses could tell him and while they were valid, there was an aspect to it all that he could not, as an adoptive – soon-to-be adoptive, at any rate – rather than biological parent, access.
“Always,” he murmured as he pulled back. “And to answer your question in a relatively concise manner, Tessa will not have been the only child who has found a new life in these parts –”
“No, that’s not it. I’m not saying we can’t, that’s the point,” Sherlock said. Or at least, that was what John assumed he said, since the words themselves came out as a somewhat unintelligible jumble, stumbling over each other in their haste to get out.
Moriarty got them into this mess, thank you very much, not him. That was quite the important distinction, he felt.
That simple action, apparently small and irrelevant though it appeared, jolted something inside of him, felt all the way down to where he was now, words whispered speeding along with it, intertwining with.
His pocket vibrated then vibrated again. Apprehensive given who had called before, he checked the number and was relieved to see it was Mycroft.
“Oh,” Sherlock said as he took them. Then, a little belatedly, “Thank you.”
It wasn’t logical. Then again, the man wasn’t quite as purely logical as he liked to think that he was.
He started to stand up, folding his legs underneath him. The grip on his hand changed accordingly and he used it to help himself up. Not that he needed it but that wasn’t really the point.
Should he not have done it all? No, he didn’t think so…he’d wanted to do it this way, quite apart from everything else, and it had seemed the most fitting for getting across what he wanted.
He almost startled as a hand enveloped his own again as best it could and looked back at John from where his gaze had…drifted. The watch was still in his other hand.
“So…is the hunger tied into you…your dragon, is that it? Is that why you didn’t come back when you woke?”
So why the bleeding hell had he not only gone in but had asked for whether there were other things he could be needing? In other circumstances, it made perfect sense for him to get several things sorted in one go. Especially when it was a multiple birth with its own set of issues, and he was a first timer in that regard.
“Yes.”
“Of course, you are, you idiot,” John replied, fondness in his voice. “As much as you like. That wasn’t what I meant.”
Sherlock’s face must’ve changed to match his hurt at the words because John’s own face contorted in a light grimace at that.
If he wasn’t alright, then he would rescue him. That was what he did. Well, part of it. If he was alright and just pulling some kind of stunt, then…
“Right. What was that all about, then?” Another indication with his head, back in the direction they’d come. “And don’t go trying to fob me off with some non-explanation. You suddenly slipped the word ‘husband’ into that whole denouement when you’d just gone on about how it was clearly the spurned fiancé from years ago that couldn’t accept that she would rather stay in a relationship with two other women than return to him.”
The Alpha thanked his ability to keep a calm face himself right then and there because he knew his face wanted to light up with slight surprise, delight and pride at John’s phrasing. None of which were technically untrue, even if they left things up to interpretation just a little. Perhaps more than a little.
Instead, it just felt sweet and touching.
be her mother.
“John…” Sherlock said eventually.
He tried to move forward again, but John held on and held him there, proving strength Sherlock had forgotten he possessed. The time spent as a rugby player hadn’t been in vain.
“John?” he queried, uncertain and hesitant, when he felt the stockier body…not exactly press up against his back but certainly move up behind him.
Even if it wouldn’t be like that, though, he wouldn’t have expected it to be this kind of a mess. Not kidnappings by Irish Alpha criminal madmen and their thuggish Alpha lackeys.
“We can do whatever you want,” he said into the ear, keeping his voice low and soft. “As much or as little as you want. There’s no rush.”
Fingers as long and bony as his brother’s reached out to touch but halted just before they made contact. Then they closed the distance, pressing into the pus in a gentle manner as they scooped some of it up. The fingers were then held up for closer visual inspection before they were sniffed at and pressed between the pads of the fingers, presumably to check for texture.
John gave an amused snort at that but again shook his head. “Tempting but no. Thank you, though.”
one? It wasn’t even as if it was a particularly clever joke or anything. It was just something that you said in the situation, trotting it out like a donkey on a pleasure beach.
Still…
As far as he knew, though, John had no one now, apart from the people he’d cared for in the harem. He certainly hadn’t mentioned anyone but that wasn’t much of a clue in itself, unfortunately. It wasn’t as though he was exactly overflowing with information about himself, especially not when it came to his life before the harem. Anecdotes and such, yes, but none of those gave any indication that he would still be in contact with any of the people he mentioned.
“That’s more lilac than pink, that.”
“Why…why would I be disgusted?” he asked.
Or maybe there was nothing wrong with the book and it was all on him. Most probably, as his mind kept superimposing the people he knew and cared about onto the various victims of the plants described.
Did that honestly count, though? Not really, much as he was loath to admit it. Yes, he’d put himself out there in terms of showing his feeling. Showing that he was vulnerable and emotional, that he was willing to be that. Willing to risk opening up and showing John he, he loved him and wanted to be in a relationship with him, and that was a legitimate trip out onto the metaphorical ice, especially for him.
have had this calm an approach to it. Had it been up to him, the tension and worry would still have laid thick and they’d…well, they would like as not be exactly where they’d been before the sleep, thus in fact rendering it all pointless.
"Good one," Sherlock nods in feigned approval. "Well done repeating the most tiresome gay slur you can possibly cough up, considering your comrade here only just spoke the exact same word not thirty seconds ago - "
Sherlock concerns himself with technique and practice and
Mike had actually laughed and John grinned.
to know.
Mike was glaring at him intently. "It's too weird. You're getting too wrapped up."
and so fucking
"You've been requested for a private meeting with Major Holmes."
Oh yes, this is going to be a delightful summer indeed.
"Are you trying to drive me mad?" John growls. "I'm trying to remain sane here but... fuck, you're not making it easy." He tugs down Sherlock's breeches and pants. Sherlock's rapidly filling cock springs free. "God, I want to suck you off," John says, taking Sherlock's shaft in hand.
John was truly not expecting that response. He had no idea how to respond. He stared at Sherlock, slack jawed, both of them seemingly trying to get their wits about them.
The raging beast of jealousy has never plagued John before. He hadn't even been sure he knew what jealousy felt like until a week ago.
"Yes, because I haven't been in London for almost ten years or anything," Sherlock mumbled purposefully, enjoying any and all attempts at irritating his insufferable brother. "I'll do my best to make it."
"What do you want, Sherlock?" John cuts him off, because this is fucking ridiculous. Sherlock is worried because he's a
"We had a deal, Sherlock," John shot back. "I'm going, so you can complain about it or you can shut up and let me help. I'm back in somewhat good health. I can be an asset."
He wraps his arms around his mother's shoulders and kisses her cheek, a swell of affection bursting through him at the sight of his mother concerned that she'd done something terrible to him by voicing an assumption that has apparently been quite obvious to everyone except Sherlock Holmes.
"To what?"
It's John's turn to roll his eyes. "Not a babysitter," he says with a glare, still a little indignant at the idea that he is dating Sherlock Holmes for any other reason besides the fact that he's head over heels.
He doesn't even know how he ended up here in the first place. He had no intentions of going. Every hour of the past two days he'd reminded himself he was in fact not going to go to the rugby game he was currently at.
"Can't get anyone to touch you while I've got two birds chasing my dick," Anderson sneers before shaking his head in mock disapproval, lingering a repulsively meaningful look along the genius boy's frame like he and Sherlock are sharing some sort of secret, like Anderson
John giggled. "But I like crossing lines with you."
"Hey freak!"
Sherlock curves his face into John's neck, inhaling the scent of his lover deeply into his lungs, wishing for it to fill every fiber of his being. "Why not here?"
"I have no idea", John laughed, tugging out an undershirt and tossing it on the bed. "What are you and your beloved Link doing this evening?"
"Another?" He just registers his chemistry partner asking and glances down to see the shot glasses filled anew.
"Oh no," Molly said, fishing her phone out of her pocket. "Here, try calling mine."
He immediately curses himself. John is gaping at him like he's never seen him before. He blinks several times, startling out of his thoughts and Sherlock winces.
"What are we going to do?" John mumbled, spinning slow circles against Sherlock's chest.
But really, how long could that last?
Mycroft narrowed his eyes skeptically.
Sherlock's heart stuttered in his chest at the memory.
Just the main one.
Sherlock huffs, fingers now curving around John's waist, brushing thumbs along the edges of his boxer shorts. "You haven't seen what it's really like. The rugby lads-"
John turned back and nodded, feeling more and more like this all had been a very bad idea.
"Because I've also seen John with Mary," Molly says sadly and Sherlock's stomach squirms. "And it didn't seem right to leave you alone on formal night."
Which obviously isn't possible.
Jesus Christ.
"They seem well," Sherlock nods in agreement.
It takes four full seconds for his foggy, lust-filled brain to process exactly what just came out his boyfriend's mouth, the words suddenly bolding and vibrating, bouncing off the walls of Sherlock's Mind Palace, snapping its fingers and demanding to be examined.
"I might need a little more than that, Sherlock," John tries to prod gently without scaring him into silence.
He's trusting someone he's already given so much to.
Sherlock, ever observant, seemed to deduce exactly what had been going on before he arrived. John opened his eyes to see Sherlock staring indifferently at his sister.
Sherlock stared at him quizzically for a moment then rolled his eyes. "Oh no, I'm not the one who needs to focus. You are. I've assisted you. Now you need to do your part. Use your brain, John. I know you can."
Holmes snorted. "Never you mind that. I have been keeping an eye out for a suitable Cadet for help. Lucky for me, you tried to sleep on my doorstep last night, so here we are."
"Oi, those are for the game," Mike cries indignantly as he pours beer into each cup.
His phone binged loudly in the quiet of the morning and Sherlock jerked slightly at the sound as though it had just woken him up. He needed to get home before he gave in to the urge to lay down right on the street and have a quick kip.
The rugby player sighs. "Seriously. It's completely-"
"Yeah?" John sounds so hopeful, as though Sherlock may not love this gift, which is so patently ridiculous, Sherlock shoots him an incredulous stare because John is truly an idiot if he doesn't realize what he's done.
Giggling and brushing a thumb along a rosy cheekbone, John can't keep the smile off his face, watching his pretty boyfriend blush heavily when confronted directly about what they are to each other so utterly precious it makes John warm all over. "The dynamic," John teases, "is that we're together. And we can bloody well text message all fucking day when we're away from each other because I hate being away from you and those short little messages I was getting from you earlier just aren't going to cut it for me."
It's fine.
The venom in his words is less about Irene's statement and more about how disappointed Sherlock is that it's not accurate.
Blue eyes narrowed at him and Sherlock had a brief moment of panic that he may have gone too far, before John huffed. "Fine," he mumbled.
"Absolutely!" Another boy calls.
But he isn't cool. Neither answer would make him any cooler.
? He was just so bloody
It would be nice to be somewhat normal.
"Now, here's what we're going to do," the man continued. "You're going to empty those pretty, bulging pockets of yours, and hand over your mobile."
Arousal seems to drown every other emotion as those glittering irises practically blacken out entirely, making John's insides flood with a lust so intense he has to bite back a moan, the beautiful boy staring heatedly up at him doing nothing to calm his throbbing erection. He thanks a higher power that the barrier pillow is still between them as his cock presses into it. "But," he manages to choke out from a dry throat, unable to look away, the intensity only heightened as he manages to murmur, "we should take things… slow. Yeah?"
John, however, is not fooled.
"I don't care," Sherlock throws his head back as the tip of a finger dips into him shallowly, rubbing along the tender nerves of his opening. "I don't
"Graduation is going to be
Still like John.
Because thoughts of John consumed Sherlock.
John's lips were just as soft as last week, warm and wet but more urgent today, more wanting. He pried Sherlock's mouth open as his fingers twisted into the lapels of his coat, yanking Sherlock forward. Sherlock didn't need an invitation, pressing John against the wall, their bodies flush against each other. Sherlock braced a hand behind John's head against the wall and grabbed John's hip as he delved his tongue into John's heated mouth, exploring every inch just to make sure he hadn't forgotten what he tasted like. But he hadn't forgotten, not for a second, because the tea and the coffee and the John spice was all there, just as he'd left it and he wanted more, so much more.
Sherlock shook his head almost violently and reprimanded himself angrily. He pushed all of those thoughts aside and forced himself to focus.
Victor has had time to prepare. Victor has been
John watches Sherlock step quick once to the left, faking a move and barreling forward, flags flapping behind him. He's surprisingly quick and agile.
But he cares now.
"Wait! John!" he gasped, looking down to find John on his knees, blue eyes staring back at him.
"Mm," is Sherlock's reply, knowing exactly where this is going. "They are fascinating creatures. Anyway, could you pass me the-"
Maybe it's for the best.
"John, please-"
"Christ, you're so soft," John murmurs against his skin, dragging his lips along Sherlock's pectoral muscle. "You taste
"So you got back from... was it Afghanistan or Iraq? Doesn't matter, point is that you got back and what? Didn't bother to call me? Let me know you were
John laughs and gives him another kiss, grinning against his lips. "Just be," he agrees. "Just be...together?"
John didn't need Sherlock to beg for it. He didn't need Sherlock to even ask.
Sherlock immediately stiffened in suspicion. "Explain," he demanded.
Slow is not just for John's benefit. Sherlock may not be a virgin but it has been a while and a little guidance from his gorgeous lover would be helpful.
Really, Sherlock can't even remember consciously deciding to come here.
What has he done?
your boy's got some skill!" Paul hollers from the opposite side of the pitch. "No way that was beginner's luck, that's for sure."
was the one that shook his head fondly at the boy genius.
For both of them.
came from that familiar mouth, and Sherlock turned to see the smaller body sliding sideways down the wall.
Because John was shaking his head.
God knows he's been trying.
Victor's hand abruptly falls away from Sherlock's shoulder at the sharpness of the voice behind them.
"Sherlock," John says breathlessly against his ear. "Please talk to me."
Greg Lestrade and his big fucking mouth.
"Your- your shoulder..." Sherlock stutters in way of protest which is becoming increasingly difficult as his bare skin slides deliciously along linen sheets beneath him and a firm sexy rugby player presses to his front.
He didn't move until he received a response. Then:
"That is exactly why I didn't tell you."
"You can jump or you can wait for me to get up there," Sherlock was muttering as he reached the first rung. "Either way, you're going in the water."
To John's astonishment, Sherlock made a small annoyed sound but went to the designated cabinet and pulled out five plates.
Swiveling around so quickly in his chair John actually takes a step back, Sherlock levels him with an incredulous outraged glare. "Excuse me?" he demands with fierce blue eyes, straightening his spine arrogantly, tugging his warn t-shirt down at the hem, furious and self-important all in one go. "I
as it is. "He's just- we just live together."
Sherlock chuckled and finished for him, then moved to do the same, John lifting his hips compliantly as Sherlock pulled the clothing from his body.
John blinked, seeming to weigh his options before dropping his eyes. "You were so unbelievably happy that day, Sherlock," he murmured to Sherlock's feet. "I've never seen you so happy."
No need to be told twice, Sherlock attempts to keep his hold on John as they stumble into the now dark house, the rest of the family apparently having gone off to bed while they've been arguing, leaving the two of them alone.
exactly? "You are being ridiculous."
A wave seemed to roll through Sherlock's body as he tugged the tank top up over his extremely defined abs, giving a little shimmy of his hips as he pulled the shirt over his head and dropped it to the floor.
"Mm," John breathes, slipping one hand around Sherlock's cock and stroking long, wet pulls under the spray of the shower. "What were you thinking about?"
That seems to soften Sherlock a bit, beautiful blue marble-like eyes peering up at John through dark lashes, worry swimming in a mix of curiosity, hope and
"Mrs. Holmes," he says winningly, "Such a pleasure to meet you."
Sherlock swallows.
"Great, because I wasn't going to tell you anyway."
? And what
But that's absolutely nothing compared to the weight of Sherlock as John wraps his fingers around the head of the genius boy's erection and
"Listen, you little fucker, that bloke is someone very
And just as he'd assumed, John's features fall slightly. "Oh," he sounds slightly disappointed and Sherlock hates it. "Right."
John glances at his plateful. "You should eat."
He's been into plenty of people before.
"That scenario is impossible," Sherlock argues, surveying his area – not
"Morning," John says.
Suddenly, John wanted to run. Get out of this conversation and away from this devastatingly handsome man. But his legs wouldn't move.
He finished cleaning himself off and rubbed his eyes, trying to shake off the dream and remember what he had in store for today. A feeling of incredible unease settled over him as he recalled his chat with his friends at the pub yesterday afternoon. The impending night out he would be dragged to by his overly confidant friends and thrust, no pun intended, into London's gay nightclub scene, expected to throw caution to the wind had him coming over a bit wobbly. He knew his friends didn't want him to do anything too crazy but he was sure they expected him to act available, show interest, and get a few phone numbers.
It's agony not to go to him. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean-"
Sherlock sniffs arrogantly, glancing away from those mesmerizing eyes and looks around the room as though in deep consideration. He needs to get out of here. Right now. "Well, I believe all of my belongings are moved in," he says coolly, "so if you don't mind, I'll be heading out to the library."
"Yes, how will you survive," Sherlock smirks, blinking down into the tube that now resembles the color of a cloudy London morning.
Really, he has.
"I need your assistance in teaching me about-oh-morning sex," John replied breathlessly as Sherlock licked his ear.
Maybe it's the two beers or the steady warmth spreading out to all of his limbs or the adrenaline pumping through him from the game but Sherlock cannot stop himself from beaming like a besotted moron at the blond boy beside him every single time a ball lands in a cup. He's certain he looks ridiculous, certain he's giving himself away entirely but he just cannot bring himself to
"Club?" John's brow raises, a grin threatening to tip his mildly shocked mouth upward as he glances between his teammates, interest piqued. "What club?"
Sherlock pants, trying to get used to the feeling. It doesn't quite hurt, but it's definitely not comfortable.
Sherlock goes from shocked to horrified in two seconds. "John!" he murmurs but the crowd is laughing and John is smirking.
John had giggled, barely remembering his grand scheme of having dinner together, mindlessly unpacking the boxed meals while eyeing his roommate with unmasked fascination. Sherlock had hardly acknowledged the food, though he did nod his thanks, and John would swear up and down twice that Sherlock's pale, sharp cheekbones had gone just slightly pink before he pushed his goggles up onto his head and turned away, busying himself with setting his plate of lamb makhani in its rightful place on his cluttered desk, which had at some point while John was away, manifested a rather expensive looking microscope, several different sized test tubes sitting along a steel-wired rack and a few rather thick textbooks.
John Watson, the romantic
John leaned forward, narrowing his eyes predatorily. Sherlock swallowed thickly. "You're an intelligent man, Sherlock. Figure it out."
"And yet he manages to text me a few times a month at least," John said. "Huh."
"You're welcome, Mum." Nora finished her toast. "I'm ready."
Mary sniffed at the hat. "No, smells fine."
Sherlock frowned. "You never knock."
"I didn't want it," Sherlock said. Nice to have an excuse to watch John's hands.
"North Korea, Holmes? A bloody bomb in Parliament? For Christ's sweet sake, if you were any sort of detective you'd have researched my family, my heritage. You'd know damned well that I'd never…I couldn't –" He broke off, gasping, and fumbled a tiny bottle out of his waistcoat pocket, extracting a pill and dry-swallowing. His face twisted, and he gasped for breath again.
For a long moment, Henry regarded Tom in silence. His brow creased a bit, but his eyes were blank. "Eventually," he said at last.
"I'll be careful."
"Five million," John said without looking up. "Give or take a few hundred thousand."
. That's rubbish."
"I've no idea. I recommend you not break contact even if you do experience discomfort."
"Yeah, the one you were on the other day, at the racecourse. Mycroft's fool's errand. Wrapped it up already?"
"Oh, who says you can't do anything with a medical licence these days?" Sherlock dropped the membrane into his biggest syringe. "Absolutely correct. And isn't it strange that the physician friend – who pronounced Petr Frolev dead, incidentally – is suddenly unavailable for questioning? On extended medical leave himself, evidently."
"So you never met her before this morning?" Lestrade folded his arms and stepped closer to the table.
, but he'd done it to himself. He was a keen golfer, you see, and had this habit of sticking the tees in his mouth after a hole. They were covered in fungicide, and you can imagine the damage it did."
"You can borrow something of mine to wear."
"Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. We've –"
Benedict let the corners of his mouth curl upward and forced himself not to dig his fingertips into the leather of his chair. "Oh, you hadn't heard? John's just been arrested on suspicion of murder. Gangland slaying, apparently."
"Come on. Bring the package." Sherlock turned and moved quickly – relatively – past the study, where a lamp glowed golden, making the room friendly and inviting, and toward the massive front door. He opened it carefully, ushered John through, and closed it as silently as he could. Hurrying down the steps, he made a beeline past the black Mercedes SUV in the circular drive and broke into a run, ignoring the protesting of his knee.
After risking a quick glance over his shoulder to ensure that Henry wasn't watching him, Sherlock lifted his head a little and rapidly catalogued his surroundings. They'd gone about five kilometres – first over a smooth municipal road, then onto an inadequately maintained single lane that branched off due northwest to what was still Henry's property, in this instance a farmhouse and stables in a sort of quasi-Normandy style. Judging by the unkempt grass and general disrepair of the structures, the place had been neglected for years, probably too much trouble for Henry to modernise for rent or repurpose. There might be running water, but in all likelihood there wasn't the comfort and convenience of Henry's house, all the little touches Henry had no doubt added over the years, if Tom's half-hysterical assertion had been correct, in order to facilitate a really satisfying kill or two or twenty.
"I'd heard, yes. An unsurprising event, but one I'd hoped to stave off for a while, at least. Miss Adler would have been a rich fount of information."
The staff at Altnagelvin had administered a very soothing dose of oxycodone and had also deemed it necessary for him to be given twilight sleep whilst they cleaned up Seb Moran's handiwork, but owing either to an error in the anaesthetist's calculations or simply to Sherlock's constitution, he didn't proceed beyond modest anxiolysis and heard their jocular chattering as the surgical team, seven men and women, commenced their work. He was perfectly amenable to listening. Could be entertaining.
Sherlock was silent for a long time. "John," he said at last.
Benedict only shrugged. He lifted the bow and inspected it.
John sighed. "Ben –"
"Yes." Mary swatted her bum and spoke to John. "I'm headed for Paris on Wednesday. Just heard, sorry."
"From the state of her flat, probably not," John said. "She'll have an inventory of the artwork somewhere, I'd bet. She kept the book, she'd have kept the list."
7 November 2013
That would be enough, she thought, to keep him alert. It was the hardest thing in the world to fight off the nihilism that threatened to creep over her, the drum tattoo of
"Listen. John, listen to me. I can fix this."
Impassively, Sherlock regarded the photograph of himself half-stumbling from a doss house. Even from a distance he looked disreputable: unkempt hair, wrinkled clothes, unshaven, eyes at half-mast. "You must have had a lot of time on your hands."
The people carrier slowed, rolled to a stop, and the side door opened. The guards beckoned John out, and he stepped out of the van onto uneven cobble. It was dark, but he smelled the fragrance of grass and water and something sweet like honeysuckle. "Where are we?"
"No, not dead. Gone. Missing."
Without another word, Jim Moriarty wriggled his fingers in farewell, and left the flat. His light tread and the hired guns' heavier steps resounded on the creaking stairway and then faded away altogether.
Moriarty laughed and stepped away. He glanced at John and laughed again, his voice spiralling upward in hysteria. John looked down and saw that the red dots had disappeared.
"I do? Well, I had a rough day at work. Lots of sick people. Happens in the winter, you know. Lots of flu, bronchitis, other respiratory trouble. There was a little girl about your age with a very nasty flu. It's worrisome. I'm glad you're so healthy and strong."
Enough:  there was nothing to be gained by constant rumination. He closed his eyes and thought about the odour of Gauloise Brunes emanating from the wrapped Ernst Wilhelm Nay painting.
Sherlock nodded thoughtfully. "I see."
"That's just it, though. You've always disappointed me, Sherlock. Always. All that do-gooder stuff, that was one thing, but you've never really made use of all your talents. It's distressing to see so much wasted potential. You know anyone who's really smart is looking after themselves, but you've never done that, have you? You live in a dump, you're a part-time smackhead, you scrabble after dreary little criminals, you choose the world's most boring companions for friends."
Benedict
"Probably. I didn't notice." Sherlock went down the hall and into the library. Hastily, he shut the laptop.
"Mr. Holmes." The man rose to his feet and extended his hand. "Good of you to come."
"Impressive, Mr Holmes."
Raw panic flooded Benedict's nervous system, and it took every drop of ability he was able to wring from the depths of his actorly soul to simply lie still and stare dead-eyed at Mycroft Holmes, sombrely attired in blue pinstriped worsted and a conservative wine-coloured tie that was more beautifully knotted than Benedict had ever been able to manage on his best day.
"Whatever you say, John."
The phone stopped before the answerphone picked up, then began to chirp again. "I'm just going to turn it off," Sherlock said, picking up the phone to do just that.
"Huh," John said. "Anyway, Irene Adler's not my type." John looked at the woman with the scuffed shoes. She was leaning toward the man across from her; her hair was dangerously close to the candle on the table. "You seemed like hers, though." God, that sounded snippy. Granted they weren't ordinary flatmates – at least Sherlock wasn't – but flatmates would rib each other, do the whole nudge-nudge-wink-wink-say-no-more thing. They wouldn't sound like jealous lovers.
John watched the lines between Mary's brows deepen. "Vaccinations? Where, exactly, are you planning to take us, Mary?"
. She reached for the bottle of kirsch and poured herself a tot.
"Only one way to find out," Sherlock said. "Well – come on, John." Sherlock dashed out of the cab, leaving John to pay the driver. He approached Moran's house briskly. "Lady FitzSimmons?"
"Okay." John went to the dining room and began to collect the soiled plates and cutlery. He finished the last of the wine in Sherlock's glass and closed his eyes, letting the taste linger on his lips.
"You're in a terrible hurry," John ventured jokingly. "The money's still going to be there, won't it?"
Moriarty offered Mycroft a modest smile. "Thanks. But hey, at least you're the
Unlikely, but perhaps not impossible. “Darling…I wish you’d say something to me. Anything at all. You know we’re here to listen to you. I’ll bring you anything you’d like; you only have to say the word. Or write it down. I….” She sighed, and Sig took her hand and squeezed it softly. “We only came to wish you a happy Christmas, darling. That’s all.”
"Hey." John took a step back and swept a hand out. "Come on in. Let me take your coat. How's your knee – feeling okay?"
"Sorry, sorry, sorry!" Molly came flying down the hall, burdened with a rolling case and two carrier bags. "Took forever to find all my stuff, and then they had to clear me upstairs. A very suspicious lot." She looked around. "Never been here before."
"Show me."
, in case you hadn't noticed."
"Yeah, I know. Can't be helped, and I can't fly commercial." She nodded at her carryall. "I need it now."
It was true that Nora wasn't wild with joy about the move, but she hadn't kicked up a fuss either. She'd asked about a new school, and had received the news of a tutor silently. She hadn't mentioned the swimming at all, and John gathered that she wouldn't miss it. But if she did, there were certainly swim clubs in Barcelona – it was on the ocean after all, surely there was lots of swimming to be had.
"I think the burgers are burning."
"Hang on a minute," Henry said. He gave Sherlock a bright smile. "Have you got a lisp?"
"Yeah, in a manner of speaking." Briefly, he relayed the events of the early afternoon. "He's all right," John said. "Just having a sleep right now. His temperature dropped, but I just checked on him and he's not shivering, so that's good."
Moran clutched the back of a chair, and his breath wheezed in and out of his chest. "No. You don't." He coughed harshly for a full minute, and straightened with dramatic effort. He pulled out his phone and dialled a number. "You're so bloody arrogant and blind, and you still don't see it."
Mycroft gave him an odd look, but nodded. “Certainly.” He led Greg into a spacious library, book-lined and fragrant with burning logs. “Please sit down. What would you like? I’m having whisky myself.”
Well, the vocabulary wasn't
"What's wrong?" Mary wanted to know.
He followed Sherlock up the stone steps. "That knee's not in good shape, is it?"
"Oh, that's funny." Some wag had found a voice recording to prank him. Dirty trick to play on a guy who'd just got a shock serious enough to knock him unconscious. "Hilarious. Look, I
"It's over, Jim," Benedict shouted. "Give yourself up!"
"Already?" John asked, disappointed.
Anyone else? Rupert? Andrew Scott? Ms Stubbs?"
"Are you okay?" John frowned down at Sherlock's leg. He'd been limping a bit the other day, but this was much worse. "Did you sprain something?"
“Jesus, Miri, it’s just a game.”
As he approached TWH's house, he saw a figure leaving and tensed. He waited in the shadows, watching. It was a young man, forgettable face, decent clothes but not the same quality as Tom's, messenger bag slung over one shoulder. Tiredness round the eyes, hands exceedingly dry from extensive handling of paper. A relative? Another secret boyfriend? His stalker? Sherlock strode forward, full of adrenaline and purpose. "Hello there."
"May I remind you that you could have had a knighthood as well? There's no need to mock mine."
Sherlock moved into the gloomy flat. If the building was a stately ruin, the flat was a decaying time capsule; faded floral wallpaper surrounded heavy, dark furniture nearly a hundred years old, the pictures on the wall were yellowed photographs and ponderous oils – except, Sherlock noted, there was a clean spot, about fifty by forty centimeters, where the Titus painting had likely once hung. The only concession to modernity was the large flat-screen television propped on a walnut credenza. Even Ms Tresler looked like a relic from a bygone era:  exceedingly thin and very tall, draped in an ancient absinthe-green silk dressing gown printed with cherry blossom branches, she had thin blonde hair – dyed, the roots were pure white – and intense blue eyes, faintly rimmed with encroaching cataracts, that watched both Sherlock and John with interest as she puffed on her cigarette.
received scary letters from fans – some of them were a little sad in their ardor (he wasn't even close to perfect, and even when he didn't make the same mistake twice he made new ones all the time, and he was sure that most of the fans who cherished him so much were perfectly sweet and reasonable, but idolising him wasn't the most practical or realistic thing to do) but most of them were just kind and generous about his performances, his looks, and so on. He couldn't believe a fan – could you call someone who hated you obsessively a fan? – was capable of such ugliness and vitriol.
Fuck's sake.
-acting, no less." Sherlock bit into the toast, crisp and buttery and perfect.
The number wasn't significant to Benedict. His own phone didn't have a passcode; he was too impatient to wait, even though his publicist and Em and Tom had all urged him to install one just in case he mislaid his phone. He wasn't in the habit of losing stuff, though, and –
"Hmm, let's see. Are you on a tropical island drinking coconut milk and dabbling your toes in the ocean?"
"Okay." John watched Benedict trudge toward Sherlock's bedroom, then got up and rushed after him. "Ben?"
thick."
Benedict nodded as far as the punishing hand would allow.
He glanced at the front of Mycroft's trousers and saw an undeniable erection.
"Thank you." John wasn't looking at her. He was watching Nora, who had opened her eyes and was watching him.
"The phone," John said, a bit impatiently. "Show him the phone."
He gave Tom a lazy smile. "You don't want to talk about the letters any longer?"
"No, thanks."
Benedict opened his eyes and instantly squeezed them shut again to block out the blinding light that induced immediate tears. Covering the upper half of his face with his arm, he cautiously groped out with his other hand. "Guys, that's really bright. Could you turn it off? I think I'm okay."
"No. Sweetheart," Mary said, turning to Nora, "why don't you go have your shower and by the time you're through, dinner will be ready."
"God, Peter, don't be such a twit!" Fiona said, displaying the first bit of backbone Sherlock had seen all evening. "Sorry, Benedict. You
"Where are we, anyway – Pindar? Seems a bit familiar."
He suspected that night had come and gone, but he couldn't be certain; the only certainty in his existence at the moment was pain. His body felt swollen and feverish; he swore he felt each stripe on his skin, and there must have been more than a hundred. His rotator cuffs were strained past endurance, his hands numb and half-frozen. His face and jaw hurt enough to wring tears from his eyes. His genitals throbbed in time with his heartbeat, and he half-remembered his bladder letting go when Moran had beaten his balls. Moran had, in fact, beaten him everywhere except the soles of his feet, and had far more finesse than his blunt, brutish Serbian torturers. He'd kept it up for hours, seemingly tireless, impervious to Sherlock's muffled pleas and screams.
"Couldn't have been that bad."
"Not a lot," Sherlock said. "One of those reclusive, anti-social tech types. Shuns publicity except for a few company dos, talks through the corporate mouthpiece. Photo…." Sherlock pulled up a picture of Dedalus on his phone, a slight blond man in his mid-thirties or thereabouts, wearing sunglasses, dark cuffed jeans and a battered tweed jacket, unsmiling but waving to the camera. "No spouse or companion, no children. Typical."
"I see. So that makes it perfectly okay?" Tom rubbed his face; there was a faint rasp of beard against skin. "Have you ever had an ordinary sexual relationship, Sherlock? Boyfriend, girlfriend?"
"Stratford." She hefted her bag a little higher on her shoulder. "You're not on a case?"
"Why would living tire anybody?" Sherlock murmured. He couldn't fathom it himself. There was a world surrounding them laden with secrets, with extraordinary thrills, enigmas just waiting to be prised apart, to yield to the correct amount of persuasion and pressure. The day he lost interest in the treasure trove presented to him would be the day he'd wind himself in a shroud and climb into a grave. And he felt that especially keenly today, with John beside him.
The evening was dark and cold, and the lights looked glorious. There were still clumps of snow here and there from the storm that had kicked up a few days before – someone had even built a snowman next to the duck pond, though it was sadly dilapidated now, its stick arms drooping forlornly toward the ground. John popped a breath mint before heading toward the house, visible through the trees. The front room light was on; Mary hadn't gone to fetch the little one yet.
difficult to keep from grinning, but Jim managed. "Is it Sherlock?" he asked, making sure that his voice brimmed with sad-nerd timidity.
"He could have done much worse," Sherlock allowed grudgingly. "He might yet."
"Charmed, actually. It's a bit…ah, ramshackle, but…yes, charming, on the whole."
"Yeah?" John turned around, and jumped when he saw that Sherlock was only a few centimetres away. "Christ, you –"
"Anyhow, no point writing that one up – it only took fifteen minutes. You're going to have to look for something more challenging."
Sherlock took the phone from John's hand to study the picture, the first time he'd really done so. He hadn't focussed on her in the Christmas snapshots. She was in a poppy-red dress with a vivid pink slash of ribbon around the dropped waist; she wore black tights and black shoes and a serious expression. Sherlock enlarged the photo. Her eyes were hazel, the same shape as Mary's, but John's DNA was there in the roundness of her face and her tiny chin and the texture of her hair.
But it is absurd to lay here pining away from your tiny mattress for someone who is literally in the room with you. Right?
"You too! Thanks for watching the game with me!"
Those sharp eyes darted to meet his and then Sherlock was speaking rapidly. "We will always need to use condoms when we have sex. You don't need to, I know I'm your first and I know you've never used needles. I can't say the same for myself, so condoms will be a must. Don't assume I'm better now. I'm not. I will forever be an addict. I still have cravings, I still go mad with boredom. I'm trying, John, I'm trying to be better for you, to be the best for you and I don't know if it will last, I don't know if I'll be enough. I don't know if what I can promise, I don't know if-"
Well, for Sherlock, it wasn't much of a deterrent but he was sure John wouldn't take to kindly to it.
It takes a monumental effort for Sherlock to reply with any semblance of comprehension or coherent response, all of this hitting him a bit hard while simultaneously not making any sense at all, but somehow he's able to cough up a shaky, "Alright," before the silence reaches a minute.
John's mouth rides down the center of Sherlock's sternum, hot breath leaving a scorching trail in its wake as it finds its way to Sherlock's left nipple.
A zip of worry had raced its way down John's spine at the sight of the Sherlock-less space, before he went about packing his overnight bag,
Sherlock gasps, legs falling open even further, eyes wide and wondrous staring up at his lover who stares right back.
That maybe they should just forget it happened.
John stole a glance at Sherlock and deflated a little at the relieved look on his face. So that was it then. Sherlock really wasn't interested in him at all like that. Then what was with his comments at the party the night they met?... No, he was not going to start spinning his wheels down this path again. It was completely useless. He shook his head.
fucking him tonight making his stomach churn unpleasantly, realization crashing over him as he takes in the boy on his porch.
. He tries to act like a hard arse but really he's just a big softy. Tell your brother that from all of us!"
The urgency in the blond boy's movements makes something pulse in the base of Sherlock's spine and he bites his lip as his jeans fall open, silently agreeing with himself that he is simply going to enjoy this. He's not going to worry about what happens later, that this is a one-time thing, that tomorrow he will see John at school and it will be like this never happened.
The party is not quite as loud as Sherlock had anticipated it being. A dull hum and quiet thump of music are filling the air certainly but he'd kind of assumed that people would be yelling drunkenly and maybe swinging from chandeliers, shouting at each other or fighting from what he'd seen in movies. He's never been to a proper party. Truth is: he's never been invited.
He avoids the awkward quiet they fall into when together.
"Aww," John teases, grinning absolutely madly up at Sherlock, and the curly-haired boy can't really find it in himself to be mad at that gorgeous smile, "You are just a big softy about Christmas, aren't you?"
John let out a long suffering sigh. This was starting to feel like a cruel and unusual punishment.
But that's not what's getting to Sherlock now. It's not that Anderson was any more brutal today than he is any other day.
Sherlock had suddenly felt self-conscious. He was fully aware that his 'little hobby', as his brother so lovingly put it, was not exactly a normal thing for a nineteen-year-old to be doing. Of course, the way he'd gotten in to all this wasn't normal either.
It's time to redefine himself.

He's staring, he knows, gaping more like, ogling like the Year 11 that he is but has never identified with.
The promise of more.
Whipping his head around toward the ground, John fixed his best friend of ten years with a rather severe glare, eyelids slitting, blurring the small, currently-striped clad figure of Sherlock Holmes. "You wouldn't," John challenged.
Sherlock actually laughs. "Yes," he says, wading further into the water to fully immerse himself.
Not even close.
John's eyes widened. Or, well, they attempted to widen but the lack of sleep only allowed them a fraction of true movement. He blinked owlishly at this Greg character.
Sherlock stares because apparently that's all Sherlock can do when in the presence of the rugby captain.
It brings on another set of harsh tears. "John," Sherlock murmurs, gazing blearily up at his husband hovering over him. He grips John's biceps. "John, please."
Blinking lazily up at his roommate, Sherlock does settle almost immediately, his roommate's proximity so soothing and nice and he's again struck by John's beauty, his short stature doing nothing to hinder the obviousness of his strong body, his powerful figure that practically carried a boy twice his size home this evening, his muscles rippling under Sherlock's hands as he'd clutched to him while attempting to hobble home.
and so before he can stop himself or overthink it or bloody well know better, the word is out of his mouth and he slams his eyes shut and freezes, the sound of his gravely voice deafeningly loud in the silent room.
The way someone looks at an acquaintance that they're certain they should know but having no idea why.
"The only reason we aren't progressing sexually in our relationship quite yet is because you haven't decided that you are ready. And no, I don't think you should tell me you're ready while we're in the middle of grinding against each other while snogging outside your flat. I want you to have a clear mind, and make an intelligent, non-lust induced decision. It's not a heat of the moment type of choice, John. Like I told you before; this is important."
"Maybe not, but I can still appreciate that she wasn't in her right mind."
It's empty.
The boy who likes him.
felt a bit sad for his friend but letting the genius boy know that would break whatever unspoken bond they'd formed over the last few weeks and John found that option entirely unacceptable.
Sherlock Holmes can bloody well take care of himself, thank you very much. He doesn't need protection or coddling or… or
Sherlock actually gasps and John grins wickedly, eyes never leaving Sherlock's as he glides back down and licks the underside of Sherlock's cock.
John is simply option three; being kind to Sherlock out of pity.
page! Come join in! XO!
"Oh Christ, we gotta get inside," John turns to find Sherlock watching the sky curiously, ignoring the chaos around him, blinking against raindrops falling into his lashes. "Sherlock? We've got to go."
"What's the matter?" the curly-haired boy ventures, still holding fast to John's shirt, unwilling to let go at this point, though a cool wave of panic is slowly rolling through him. "Do you… do you not want this? I… I mean I know last night you didn't want to… I mean you left after a pretty charged moment and…"
Sherlock fidgets slightly at any comment that hints of something more. Sherlock always looks away, never able to look John in the eye during one of these moment, and blushes - oh god, the
is. John needs to know. John
we could go back to the party and snog each other senseless in front of Victor Trevor. The choice is yours."
"I need you," Sherlock all but sobs, pulling at John's shoulders, attempting to get him closer. "Please, John, please…"
Lestrade nodded thoughtfully, seeming impressed. Then his attention snapped back sharply to John as though he just remembered something. "Actually, I'm glad you're here." He paused at the bottom of the stairs Sherlock had already ascended.
John's barely-there muscles shifted under his tattered, blood stained shirt, body tightening in on itself against Sherlock's words.
"Not yet," John grumbles, burrowing further into Sherlock's chest like he has no intention of doing anything else, especially not bathing. "Kind of difficult with a broken wing and all."
Sherlock rolls his eyes and John laughs. "Just promise."
John frowned. "Well what?"
And John was kissing him like he'd never kissed anyone in his life, and clinging to him with every inch of his body, his arms wrapped tight, fingers dug in deep into silky ringlets, legs squeezing at the thighs and hooked at the ankles, holding on for dear life, making soft little noises into Sherlock's mouth.
So he'd laid silent, pushing a hand against his heart in a weak attempt to keep it from shattering as John walked out his door.
That's when John realizes what he's
that. All damn morning he'd been avoiding the godforsaken rugby game. And they were going to go
What was even more terrifying was the possibility that another person, romantic or not, could get to know Sherlock. The way John had gotten to know him. That another person could possibly learn all the small things that made up Sherlock Holmes. Like the fact that his eyes widened when he came to a realization no one else had yet. The way a small smile played on his lips when he found something amusing. The way his sharp cheekbones tinted pink whenever John complemented his work or his deductions. The way his irises changed color with every different emotion he felt. How gentle and young he truly was while giving off the air of someone much older and much wiser.
He watches as his roommate stands from his desk and grabs his book bag, muttering about where his Chemistry textbook has gone, ruffling papers and other odd items along his desk, making more noise than either of them has all day.
"Oh, did you wanna go up against us already?" Mike blinks at him, a smirk playing along his lips. "Want an arse –kicking so early in the night, Johnny Boy?"
Trying not to giggle, John fumbles his way out of the bus and up the stairs, following Greg's feet as his eyes threaten to close, heart still beating a bit faster, hoping to find another text when he gets upstairs.
And for once, he didn't want to take this boy's innocence. He didn't want to take him to pieces in a purely animalistic way all in the name of data.
The choked sob of a response made Sherlock freeze. He pulled back slightly to find John's beautiful blue eyes shimmering with unshed tears, mouth pressed into a hard line, face pinched with effort not to cry.
. No one is paying attention to his whereabouts anyway. Well, besides the one breathing heavily down the other line of the mobile at the current moment.
John Watson, who dropped into his school last year, joining the rugby team, making captain almost immediately and making quite a name for himself in the process. The girls swoon over his pretty blue eyes and dirty blonde hair and the boys clap him on the back and call him Cap and laughed at everything he says. Everyone loves John Watson.
"Mum and dad are getting a divorce," she announced, rolling to her back to stare up at the ceiling.
? I don't... I'm not...I want you to have...Youdeserve...
"Thanks guys, really," John offers in return though it sounds mild and pathetic to his own ears, though he may have gotten away with it if it weren't for the captain of their rugby team staring intently at John, making no move to hop onto the Kill Victor Trevor conversation and instead zeroing in on his friend, gaze evaluating and quizzical, tracing every crease in John's features like some sort of silent interrogation and John knows he's in for questioning.
The touch is soft. So soft and gentle, just like his John, fingertips landing on a sharp cheekbone and caressing it smoothly, gliding along pale skin that heats under the touch. Exhaling on a shaky breath, Sherlock's eyelids threaten to fall closed as he revels in this, revels in his best friend, the one he's loved for over half of his life, finally laying intimate hands on him like this. It's exquisite, this single stroke across his cheek, the affection pouring from those five fingertips so intensely Sherlock can hardly stop his lashes from fluttering.
Because this? This right here is why he'd brought John home. Of course he'd wanted to be with John on Christmas Day and he'd wanted John to see his family's house and of course he hadn't wanted to be away from John for all of winter break.
bad at this event for John to look so torn about being involved with him for it. "I thought I'd actually-"
"Really?" he murmurs, shuffling just a bit closer. "Before... before last night?"
Mike's brow knitted in confusion for a brief moment then recovered. "You're a right prick for what you did, you know that?"
Sherlock was surprised they hadn't noticed him before. Now watching Mike make his way angrily through the crowded pub, he almost wished he had stayed under the radar.
"I-… yeah," he concedes with a nod, feeling unbelievably foolish for not realizing this in the first place. "Yeah. You guys are right."
"God, you're gorgeous," John murmured, biting his lobe and sucking it between his teeth. His fingers began trailing up Sherlock's leg. Sherlock laid his hand over top of it.
Cozy.
The second time he says it has more weight and suddenly the moment is broken as John's eyes tear themselves away and skitter across the dark floor.
John frowned. "Why? Aren't we back to my room?"
," Sherlock barks, glaring at the cement disappearing beneath his feet, feeling the heat of fury burning the back of his neck at how absolutely petulant he sounds. This is what Mycroft and his large, meddling arse does to Sherlock. He forces him to act irrational. "It's
John sniffed, murmured something intelligible, then rolled over toward Sherlock, half his body landing on top of Sherlock's.
"That's a good thing, right?" Sherlock asks cautiously. "I mean, you're funny. You'd like to date someone funny too, right?"
, maybe. But not by
Although, he has yet to have the reaction he had to John in his rugby uniform. Lord have mercy, that uniform…
as Sherlock roused from a deep slumber, stroking his curls and grinning at him. He doesn't remember going to the courthouse the very next day and signing the papers, dragging Mycroft and Lestrade along for witnesses because they were the only two that could be available on short notice.
he'd scolded himself
The thread of that last thought snakes its way back to the story about the man whose boyfriend kissed him in front of an interested party and snaps themselves together, forming a new idea altogether and Sherlock leans back in his chair, closing his eyes and steepling his fingers in front of his lips, letting the thought percolate before forming itself into somewhat of a shaky plan.
Sighing again, John nodded. "Yeah, you're right," he grumbled, pulling out his phone and typing out a text.
The knowing smile is immediately full across his face, his partner so transparent and so precious Sherlock has the impulse to clutch his phone to his chest and squeal in delight.
"I know," John said sharply, because he did. "Whatever you're going to say, I know. And I promise, for as long as I live I won't hurt him. Not purposefully and I will do my damndest not to let anything like
John all but bit his tongue in two, his jaw tightening so hard it pinched the muscle. "Excuse me?" he breathed low and dangerous.
THANK YOU FOR READING!!!!!
Maybe he decided against all this.
Sherlock grins. "Thank you for the ride, John."
"What are
The hallways have been blessedly busy today, not a single student noticing Sherlock making his way from first period to second and now to his locker, planning to stay as under the radar as he can possibly manage, misery fogging his thoughts and making him feel much smaller, much more alone than he's ever been in his young life.
"Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock answered his cell, pressing the phone to his ear and staring down at his desk, listening. John glared at him. Sherlock knew, he fucking knew, and he wasn't going to do anything about it. He'd wound him up all week, and now he was having strange meetings with random women and secret phone calls while John was raring and willing in the seclusion of his office. The fucking bastard.
the cheerleaders.
," John breathes, licking his tongue over Sherlock's. "God, I've wanted to do this all bloody summer."
"I love you."
Hips roll with every pass of John's hand along Sherlock's naval, jumping and attempting to catch the interest of that gentle touch, seeking some sort of attention accompanied by a soft hitch of breath with every twitch.
deeper than he'd even thought possible, the emptiness in his heart seeming to grow wider and enveloping him harshly, showing no mercy, not that he deserves any, feeling the pain all the way down to the tips of his toes, racking his entire body with the weight of a dead friendship.
John was on his feet before Anderson could finish, swinging his book bag over his shoulder and hurrying off, suddenly wide awake, and deliberately ignoring Anderson calling after him.
Which was when John knew good and damn well how much trouble he was truly in.
That would be Sherlock's friend Irene Adler.
Greg turned immediately to the furthest one from the man across the room and made a beeline for it, head down, hands shoved in his pockets.
Sherlock attempted to frown in confusion but John rolled his eyes.
Sherlock stopped, that excited gleam back in his eye as he turned to John. "My perceived arrogance isn't about age, John, it's about intellect. My mind is far more superior then most."
Sherlock, for his part, was still laughing, holding up his hands to fend off the water, body shaking with mirth. "There aren't any eels in here!" he giggled, swimming closer, dodging John's attempts at flicking more water at him. "Please, John, you really think I would put you in danger?"
"Okay, John," he nods, stumbling along the sidewalk as his vision wobbles slightly around the edges. He's going to be lucky if he makes it home without getting sick again.
!" Sherlock gripes, shooting her a glare and rubbing at his arm.
Something zings low in Sherlock's spine. "John," he rasps again.
He's changed his mind at least eighteen times by the time 7pm rolls around on Sunday evening, the magnitude of what's about the happen only made real two hours prior when John had text him after radio silence for 48 hours:
He mentally throws that thought away, squashing it along with all the recently conjured up images of John Watson grinning happily at him and kissing his cheek and holding his hand and holding him close the way a boyfriend would, and scrubs a hand down his face. "H-How, um-" he stutters out softly before clearing his throat and asking his question like an intelligent grown up, "how did you know?"
And in those three days, Sherlock has decided that being away from John is not only intolerable, it's unbelievably frustrating and entirely unacceptable. It
Sherlock tries to return a tight smile of his own but he's certain it's more of a grimace and turns to go to his microscope.
Jesus Christ.
"Don't be sorry," Mike replies jovially with a smack to Sherlock's back. "If I saw my partner get flipped like that, I'd be freaked too. We just wanted to make sure you were alright."
And then John Watson has the audacity to wrap an arm around his shoulder and press his lips to Sherlock's ear like the genius boy's world isn't currently tilting, stopping and then rotating in a different direction.
was the only one who enjoyed Sherlock's snarky remarks.
John's mouth
Everything hurts.
"It would have been worse if you would have gotten me naked and then realized you weren't into me," John said with a cheeky grin.
It aches to even think his name, to even hear those four letters ring in his head and before he can talk himself out of it, before he can overthink it, before he can realize how useless it will be, Sherlock's hand is diving into his pocket and retrieving his mobile, swiping it open and tapping to find the contact he needs even as his vision swims. He stabs the Call button and raises the phone to his ear, waiting only a short moment before the line clicks over and a familiar voice comes on.
"Give it time," Greg says, pulling John's attention back to him. "He'll come around."
And even as he can see it so utterly clearly, can see everything bright and obvious, can finally see his Chemistry partner for who he really is, it still doesn't stop the cruelty of Victor's words from slicing through him like a knife and cutting him down to about three inches tall, the name-calling and disgusted staring and furious glaring all too familiar from his Secondary School days.
"But you said...in your texts, you said there was someone you'd had feelings for-"
Finding Greg first, John marched right over to him, grabbed the drink he held in his hand, and threw it back, swallowing it hard with a loud exhale.
. He arches against the shorter boy, attempting to pull him impossibly closer as arousal swirls low in Sherlock's belly, making his cock swell in his trousers and grind his hips into John's, suddenly very aware of the fact that he hasn't had sex in a while and that he's wanted to have sex with John for a very long time, and those two facts collide in a solid shake of his body against John's.
No more sleepovers in the same bed.
"John," Sherlock practically sobs, rolling his body in time with John's thrusts, sounding completely wrecked. "Do it, John. Please.
"We all have shit days, John," Molly soothed, refilling his coffee mug. "We all say stupid things we don't mean. Just go apologize. It'll make you feel better, trust me."
A red-hot heat fills Sherlock's chest and creeps up his neck, staining his cheeks and face. John grins even harder and even from here Sherlock can see his shoulders rise up and down in a quiet chuckle, which makes Sherlock's blush deepen but he's grinning right back, never wanting to tear his eyes away from that beautiful boy in the center of the field. He bites at the corner of his bottom lip in a feeble attempt to quiet his smile but it does nothing to help. John shakes his head fondly just as another teammate claps a hand on his shoulder, shaking him from his reverie and dragging him back to focus on the game. John glances over and nods in agreement and Sherlock's stomach swoops in disappointment at the charged moment ending.
John snorts, chuckling as Sherlock shoots him a grin of his own.
Seeming to have read his mind, Sherlock cleared his throat and dropped his hand. "I play the violin," he said abruptly and started walking again.
He has yet to stoop that low in the last week, avoiding touching himself at all costs. Mainly because he'd believed himself better than that.
Sherlock seemed to relax under John's touch and words and let out a long breath. "Okay," he murmured as John dropped his hand. "Okay, John." He nodded once and then spoke, his voice stronger then before, more confident. "I've never been in any type of...I once told you that I do not have friends like you. That statement was true. A truer statement would be that I do not have friends at all, nor do I have relationships of any kind. Then you came along and...changed that."
"Bi," John confirms, seeming entirely at ease with answering Sherlock's half-questions.
Sherlock wants that smirk to turn into something else. Something primal and fierce.
"Are you alright?"
He checks his watch again and huffs irritably as the big hand ticks slowly along the tiny tally marks before he tugs his shirt sleeve back down and glares grumpily out the window, long fingers finding their way back to his knee and resuming their aggravated tapping, counting out the long extended beats of time clicking by slower and slower and slower.
"A round of beers would be lovely," John smiles tightly, ignoring the blood red fingernails standing out starkly against Sherlock's beautiful porcelain skin, sucking in a silent breath and blowing it out slowly. "Thank you," he says through clenched teeth, patently refusing to give into to his baser instincts and grab Sherlock back to him.
Sherlock
John pulled back to search those ever-changing eyes, trying to bite back the worry that was creeping up his chest. The look he received did feel reassuring but still, he hated the thought that Sherlock had been hurt. He lifted Sherlock's arm and bent to place a gentle kiss over the scar from the cut John had tended to all those weeks ago. It was still a dark pink, almost red, and still a bit scabbed over at one end, slowly healing itself. Sherlock let out a stuttered breath and their eyes met again as John straightened his spine. Sherlock took his face in his hands. "I'm fine," he repeated, locking John into an intense stare. "You fixed me."
John nuzzled his nose into Sherlock's hair. "Pleeeeaaassse?"
"He likes food," Sherlock shrugs. "He thinks I don't eat enough."
He was positively buzzing.
He growls in frustration, his thoughts muddled and thick and slow, his admission barely obvious to his own ears but John is taking another step closer and Sherlock's mouth shuts thankfully on its own.
"So it's just that it's new?" John tries again, filing away that precious information to examine at a later date, instead thinking slowly through everything Sherlock has said, piecing things together again. "You don't know what to expect?"
It's enough to settle his racing heart and anxious thoughts and he presses his forehead against the glass feeling a renewed sense of excitement and thrill, watching fog cloud beneath his eyes as he exhales against it, heart calming from a racing to a steady pulsing in his chest, content to thrum in time with the pull of the train car, with the knowledge that his perfect boyfriend is waiting on the other end of this long ride.
It doesn't stop the happy little bubble forming in his chest. "No, it's not," he argues half-heartedly, turning back to his desk.
John was quicker, grasping desperately at the buttons of Sherlock's shirt, clawing them open in a rush, hands scrabbling for purchase on his bare skin. Sherlock assisted with the last few, tearing his shirt from his arms just in time to catch himself on his palms as John grabbed his shoulders and pulled him down. He hovered over John's half naked form, reaching for his soldier's lips, when John's calloused fingers wrapped around each of his nipples and pulled.
"I didn't even know he was missing," Mycroft replied with an eyebrow raise. "And neither did you so you can stop it with the accusations."
That night John had gotten him home and put him to bed safe and sound.
Wriggling out of his grasp, John tosses a playful punch into his friend's ribs. "Yeah, I told you that in confidence, thanks," he attempts to scold, though his lips twitch up in a good-natured grin.
"I'm not risking it," John says. "I'm not risking
He's terrified.
He hadn't seen her since she'd gotten married and moved to the states so many years ago.
. Ugh. Not a word he enjoyed thinking if he could help it, but one that had frequented his thoughts more and more since he'd met John.
Sherlock blew out a heated breath and watched as the hot air mixed with the cold and rain and danced into smoked designs, twisting this way and that. He grinned, wholly pleased with himself after the nights events. He was becoming a bit dazed and continued his trudge home, running his hand threw wet hair, his curls wilting in the light rain. Sleep was all he wanted.
Although now as he's stared down and cornered by half the football team, he can't help cursing himself as Sally gapes at him with horrified shock, Sebastian's lips flap stupidly beside her. "What?"
Oh god.
John's hands are in his hair as he calms.
And stops dead in his tracks.
"You're high," he counters.
And finally, the last new piece of data he'd obtained he actually didn't want to file. He wanted to keep it, hang it up in a frame where he could go back and look at it every other minute of the day and smile at it: John liked The Work. He found Sherlock's detective work fascinating, even if he wasn't quite allowed to go into the crime scene the first and only time he'd gone on a case, he'd had so many bloody questions afterward. It had been fantastic.
"You are filthy, Sherlock Holmes," John murmurs, slipping his tongue into Sherlock's mouth without preamble. "Absolutely filthy."
want to meet him," Mike emphasizes, lips still twitching. "I've heard he's completely mad and I could use a little mad in my life, couldn't I, Greg?"
Sherlock chuckles. "Don't I know it," he replies to his head trainer and Mrs. Hudson beams.
He can't remember ever running like this.
And without warning, that wet, pink, delicate tongue slipped out of Sherlock's mouth, over the initial bump of his lip and grazed along John's fingers gently, sweeping along them in one soft motion before disappearing back between his teeth, lips closing over John's digits in a gentle kiss.
John resists the urge to roll his eyes. Sherlock's attempts at small talk are always the worst, but seemly necessary for the boy to get to the point he's actually trying to make.
John blinked. He'd heard rumors? What the bloody fuck was he talking about? John's vision was blurring at the sides, all this information hitting him like a ton of bricks. He was doing his best to breath silently through it, but he could feel his hands and legs shaking violently.
Well.
John blearily stared at him for a long moment. "Okay," he murmured.
Molly's phone shrieked to life, making them both jump.
Christ, John already wants to take him home. It's only been a short while and already he's aching to get Sherlock naked and writhing, wet and wanting,
," Sherlock tries to scold through the laughter bubbling over his lips. "It was just mold."
"You'll shut the fuck up if you know what's good for you," Anderson warns, stepping a pace closer but Sherlock can't seem to do as he's told as the words roll out of his mouth without a second thought.
And Sherlock had had a very small but very real panic attack.
Irene rolls her eyes. "Fuck off."
John's weight settles back against him. "Okay," he whispers, kissing Sherlock's cheek and neck. He wraps his arms under Sherlock's chest. "Okay," he says again.
"Nah, it wasn't a big deal," John says before turning a mischievous gaze on Sherlock, a playful smirk tugging on the corners of his mouth. "Which is lucky considering my attraction to you was immediate and completely obvious. I think I'd have run for the hills if I wasn't comfortable with liking blokes."
Which is how Sherlock ends up sprawled out on his back on the floor of John's room, which he's barely had a chance to fully take in before John had him pinned to the wall, then dragged him down to his current position. He moans as the blonde boy hovering over him sucks a bruise into his neck. "John," he breathes, clutching his hands into John's hair.
"Christ, look at you," John drops his gaze down to where his fingers are disappearing and reappearing between Sherlock's legs. "That's right, baby, open up for me, there you go. God, I cannot wait to feel you come with your arse around my cock."
He had involuntarily warmed to John, making a spur of the moment decision that being friends with John Watson would be all right. He could handle it. It would be fine.
Sherlock barely notices when his clothing is entirely removed.
"Skin him and eat him," another one of Seb's gang nods. "He'd be just the type."
And that's not the end of the world, right? That's not that big of a deal, is it?
?" Sherlock demands breathlessly, palms already settling on John's hips and pulling him closer. His lips flap helplessly, thoughts unable to process the absurdity in front of him; John Watson stammering and staring at Sherlock like
John had stared at her for a long moment, and then ran his hand through his hair. "Jesus. Really?"
John snorts as he takes out his books. "I take it it went well?"
There is a shift and a rustle and John finally dares to peek over at the bed across the room, only able to make out shapes in the darkness, the light of the moon spilling in through the slats of the curtain hanging against their window. He blinks into the dimly lit room, attempting to decipher what he's seeing as his vision adjusts.
And Sherlock doesn't know if this will continue or not.
It's not-
"He won't be needing them."
like Paul Dimmock. Not like Paul Dimmock
Sherlock glances up to meet ocean blue eyes staring back at him. "What?"
Thick bands wrap around Sherlock's chest and squeeze as he holds John's gaze, his ribcage throbbing as his heart seems to try to break free from the pressure and he tries to swallow around a dry throat threatening to fill itself with a lump of emotion, the moment stretching out far longer than it ought to but John Watson is staring at him like
John is quiet for a moment then blows out a breath. "That's terrible."
"Oh yeah? How?"
He has no idea where that just came from but now that he thinks about it, it's probably true. John came from a house run by a woman he clearly looked after, as well as a disaster of a sibling, brother or sister still unclear, his caregiver vibes coming off in waves with his obvious concern about where Sherlock has been. He's trying to hide the worry behind irritation but after years of stomaching Mycroft's overbearing ways and Mrs. Hudson's hand-ringing, Sherlock can spot the weight of what John presumes a burden of his roommate's safety all over his face.
Based on the broadening grin on John's face, he wasn't doing a great job of suppressing it. Sherlock looked down and shook his head. Clearly, John wasn't giving up. "Look at the course information sheet," he heard himself say and he internally cursed. What was he doing? He knew better.
And just as he's about to say all of that, to apologize profusely, to let the boy in his arms go back to his own bed and get away from stupid sodding John Watson and his uncontrollable need for Sherlock Holmes, the curly head on his chest snaps up, turns toward him and before John can catch the look on his face, Sherlock buries it in John's neck.
Sherlock's hands came to John's cheeks, desperate to warm the pink out of them and bent his head just enough to capture John's lips with his own. He pressed delicately, feeling how soft they were, exactly like John's lips should feel, brushing over them, caressing them against his own. He took a step closer, pulling John to him as he pressed his lips a bit harder now, slotting John's bottom lip between them and tugging gently. John moaned softly and Sherlock took the opportunity to pry his lips apart, running his tongue across the bottom until he could delve inside, sweeping across John's own tentative tongue and stroking against it, eliciting the softest of sounds from John's lips.
And Sherlock loves him.
"What?" John replied angrily.
He's riding next to the boy he loves.
, like sweet tea and warmth and comfort and home and Sherlock is shifting closer, pressing his barely clothed body closer to the radiating heat rolling in waves off the rugby captain's frame. He barely notices his hands wandering down that fit torso, feeling John's hard muscles beneath his fingers. God bless the sport of rugby.
John is impressive as usual, and tonight Sherlock can feel the crowd cheering his name in his bones.
Sherlock whips back toward him, shock and outrage obvious in the widening of his eyes and mouth. "
John gave himself a self-assured nod, actively turned his thoughts away from Sherlock and onto school and shut off the water.
John's shoulders relax slightly. He nods. "Okay. How did we meet?"
"Shut up," Irene whispers sharply, cutting him off as Sherlock attempts to offer their partner directions, seeing as the library is rather large and Victor isn't the brightest.
It's Sherlock, after all. Lucky is not in the cards for him.
Sherlock slams his head back against the wall, his eyes sliding shut but it doesn’t keep him from complaining that John has once again over reacted about him trying to take things a bit too far on the dance floor. To be fair, they do have rules because Sherlock is Sherlock after all and
Hurrying onto the sidewalk lining the field just far enough away to walk by unnoticed, Sherlock's sharp eyes scan the gaggle of red-clad boys, thin practice jerseys hanging off each of them overtop different colored shirts, every single one of them looking disheveled and damp and like they're having the time of their lives, all smiling and laughing and shoving each other around the muddy pitch. A soft glow blooms in Sherlock's chest at the sight of them all, the memory of the party only a few short weeks ago replaying in his head the way they'd all accepted him into their circle, joked and laughed with him, and let him feel a part of it all.
Panting and shaking his head unsteadily, Sherlock smoothes a hand through John's fringe in an attempt to soothe him as he gathers his own thoughts, never wanting John to believe he's done anything wrong because, Christ, he
And immediately regrets it as John's precious features blur harshly in his vision, seeming unable to stay in one place in his line of sight. He shuts his eyes again. "I need to go home," he mutters so quietly only John can hear. He hopes, anyway.
For an entire year, Sherlock had pretended not to notice John. Not to know exactly what John wears everyday and who John spends time with. For an entire year, Sherlock feigned ignorance to this gorgeous captain.
He felt John smile against his lips. "Yeah. Yeah, we can do it. I just…" John sighed heavily. "I just really want you."
Sherlock startled slightly. "To-...together?"
Sherlock's hand came to the base of his neck, the other on the small of his back, and ever so tenderly laid him down in the sheets.
Sherlock is staring. "And… and you want me to come?"
A small smile stretches along Sherlock's lips and a tiny, pleased little giggle emits itself from his mouth.
Hollering and cheering right at his side, slapping a hand to his shoulder or back, John is enchanting like this, deeply enthralled in the game, seeming almost proud as he stands by his roommate, grinning like a fool and commending his every score.
"Like I said," Mycroft said, losing his cool demeanor for a moment long enough to sound genuinely irritated, "I may have underestimated you."
He doesn't understand.
Tears were sliding down John's face now in silent streams, his beautiful blue eyes shimmering unable to stop the flood they were swimming in. He was not sobbing. He was not hysterical. He simply wept quietly, pursing his lips together so hard they were white, staring at his hands in his lap, shoulders hunched and tight.
"Alright, so what am I-"
Sherlock's arms dropped slowly to his sides as he eyed John in confusion. "What?"
"You don't know anything about him," John snapped before he could stop himself.
That maybe he's regretting ever kissing John Watson.
"Like a spy?" Paul's eyes widen with excitement and John laughs for the first time since this conversation started, grinning at his teammate. It's nice to not be on the outs with Paul anymore and it's nice to see Paul with some color back in his cheeks.
John tips his head in agreement. "Yeah, I'm guessing most of the stuff out there is just broad statements like 'treat him right!' Like, what does that even mean?"
It's an overwhelming feeling and John suppresses a shudder.
He's lost weight.
"Alright so you're a teenage prodigy getting a fancy degree who breaks into his brother's home to retrieve his own items. What else should I know about you?"
drink like that again and he can't picture another scenario that John would willing cuddle him so he'll take what he can get. "You're so warm." The alcohol is clearly still prevalent in Sherlock's bloodstream seeing as that little comment and this little snuggling session doesn't seem one bit odd to the boy's drunk brain.
Grinning to himself stupidly, John hurries out of the locker room and back out onto the field, eyes already scanning the small, lingering crowd, finally allowing himself to look full on. He'd only caught glimpses of his roommate throughout the game, never able to give his full attention to the stands to seek him out. He actually hadn't even been sure Sherlock was there until their before-game huddle, where Greg had gripped his shoulder and whispered, "He's here. I just saw him come in."
"Okay, I think that's all for today," Sherlock called at the front. "If you have questions, please ask someone else, I have no time for you people today. Oh and don't forget about the mixer next weekend. We're required to go and it's sure to be a miserable affair, so be sure to attend, drink copious amounts of cheap alcohol and act like complete morons. You know, the usual."
He replayed the conversation he'd had with John over and over. He should be able to file it away after the amount of times he'd gone over it. He should be able to close it and move on. But he couldn't let it go just yet. He wanted to let it percolate for just a bit longer. He'd learned so much in that short time.
"Right," John is still giggling, offering a shrug at Paul considering they obviously can't say no to a joyous Mike Stamford like this, not that he really wants to anyway. He hasn't been to a real club in ages and he's been trying to find new things to take his boyfriend out to do anyway. He has no idea if Sherlock has ever been to a club before but so what if he hasn't? It'll be a new experience for the genius. John grins at the thought and turns to Paul. "Well that sounds like fun. Why would that be weird?"
Sherlock swallows hard. "Well, I'll just leave you to it-"
Sherlock's deft fingers came to the button of his jeans and gracefully, so much more so than John ever could, pulled them open and hooked his thumbs into the band. With one swift motion, he tugged downward.
they mean. It's ridiculous.
John allowed himself to be led as Sherlock slowly made their way to the street. Sherlock was already worried that they wouldn't be able to get a taxi, seeing as they were outside a club with a bunch of inebriated individuals, but he desperately needed to get John away from here.
tell me you're not giving me the sex talk right now?"
In his experience, people go one way or the other with Sherlock Holmes. They're either afraid of him and ignore him or hate him and beat him. Those are the only two options he's ever really considered, apart from Mycroft's pitying older brother routine, always watching over Sherlock's shoulder, ever concerned for his idiotic sibling, convinced the genius was hopeless, entirely incapable of having social interactions on his own or any kind of connections with regular people or taking care of himself, always ready and waiting to save Sherlock from whatever he'd gotten himself into.
"Both. Most definitely both."
"He is," Greg nods. "Go dance."
It was a low blow. It was all low. The lowest thing Sherlock had ever done. The worst words Sherlock had ever spoken. The last thing he wanted John to feel was guilt for being in this situation, a situation for the life of him Sherlock didn't bloody understand, but he had to do this. He had to. John was far too proud to accept help or anything without being guilted into it.
And John is the one to gasp as Sherlock willingly sucks the digit into his mouth, eyes still trained on John, with difficulty as the water still sprays from above them, and drags his mouth up and down. His wet eyelashes finally close as he takes John's thumb further in.
"Alright, well did you hear anything tonight at least? Before you got inebriated?"
"There we go, that's it," that kind, soothing tenor is crooning softly into his ear, palm holding fast to his back. "There we are now. There we go," over and over, never failing to respond after every heave, assuring Sherlock that it's alright, that everything is alright, that this little episode is nothing to worry about, that it's fine, it's all fine.
at this.
Touching his hips and guiding his body against his.
By the way, who is the fourth person on this chat? I just have yours and Johnny's numbers?
This isn't about that right now.
If different means hot as all fucking hell.
And all that time, John had only been blocks away, barely surviving, never bothering to call Sherlock, to find him, to bloody ask for help. It was one thing to be hard-headed. It was a whole other thing to risk your life every day for the sake of saving face.
"Yes. Listen, John, if you don't want to go in-"
," John cuts him off, exasperated by this idiotic conversation. He grabs the flannels from where he'd dropped them on the floor and shoves them in Sherlock's direction. He's feeling a bit off-kilter at the moment and arguing with Sherlock seems to be stirring something else within him, something he can't define. "Why don't you stop running your mouth and start running these flannels over your desk?"
you!"
John nodded, lips quivering, eyes stinging at the corners, feeling so unbelievably humiliated.
Sweat sluices between them as John thrusts harder and faster, his chest vibrating with Sherlock's rumbling words, his cock wet and hard and aching against deliciously plump arsecheeks, the warmth between them making his head dizzy, narrowing his senses down to only this, only the point where skin meets skin, only Sherlock. His mouth falls open to taste the salted dampness against that long glorious neck, tongue laving lazily along hard tendons as pleasures builds rapidly, spiraling faster, coiling tighter and tighter.
Sherlock groans and hangs on tight, accepting and giving back everything he's got, hands finding their way into John's hair and holding fast, cold lips crashing against John's again and again. There is teeth and tongue and Sherlock begins to shake as the cold catches up with his brain, all thoughts of anger and fury subsiding as he finally has what he wants; John in his arms.
Anderson huffs an indignant sigh. "You don't
Scrubbing a hand down his face, Sherlock waits for Mycroft to swagger off.
John's face flamed, his eyelids fluttering slightly at the intimacy of the moment. He'd never been looked at the way Sherlock was looking at him right now and he was positively drunk on it, after so many months of wishing and wanting this. He hadn't heard himself breathing for a long time and took a big gulp of air, trying to keep himself steady. "Sherlock," was all he could breath. Was this real? Did Sherlock actually just say those things to him?
They both looked at Mike who smirked. "Hell yes. I think we all need that, yeah? Let's go."
"Come here," John barked, marching to one of the hallways off of the club. It was only a little quieter but at least John could hear himself think.
"Of course," he breathes, feeling so utterly foolish, shaking his head.
This John can't read him like his John always could.
For one thing, he doesn't even know this person. He doesn't know if he would even
"Excellent," Sherlock whirled around to the stove, grabbed the hot dish with two mittens sitting nearby and took off.
After months without, after weeks of believing this would never be something he'd have again, Sherlock shudders uncontrollably as he spurts onto his own stomach, vision blurring slightly with the effort not to blink.
"Yeah, hi," John replied distractedly. He ran a hand down his face. What the fuck was he doing here?
"Goodnight." John did his best not to sound hurt. He turned toward his door and fumbled with his keys, needing to be in the shower with his hand on his cock immediately.
Sherlock glanced up to see John's blue eyes watching him warily, bottom lip pinched between his teeth.
John glanced up at him. "No, nothing out of the ordinary."
Practically impossible.
"Ah," Sherlock nods, immediately feeling better about not knowing since there was nothing to know apparently. "Well, Sunday night it is, then."
John grins against his lips. "Oh thank god."
John clenched the drink in his hand to the point of almost breaking it as Sherlock turned his head to the crowd for the first time and tossed a saucy smirk with a small shrug over his shoulder, muscles bunching under smooth skin at the movement. John was only comprehending how defined Sherlock's arm muscles were when The Detective rose to his feet and turn to the crowd, running his hands down his black fabric-clad stomach.
Sitting up quickly, Sherlock places a somewhat unsteady hand on John's thigh, propping the other behind him and peering up at John from beneath messy curls, eyes wide and round and
And there was only one student he was interested in tutoring.
Startled slightly by familiarity, head tipping slightly to the new voice, the curly-haired boy peeks over his shoulder to find out if his theory is correct or not.
"Well that is a very important lesson indeed. I believe I'm up for the task seeing as I have such an eager student to teach." Sherlock dragged his tongue over his ear, wrapping his arms around John's body as he settled his weight, gyrating slowly against him. John's hands found purchase on Sherlock's lower back and one arse cheek, pulling him as close as possible.
What has he missed?
"Sherlock," John murmurs and suddenly he's very close, much closer than he's been all night and Sherlock revels in his nearness while simultaneously panicking that all of this is, yet again, just one giant misunderstanding. He waits.
It was oddly entertaining.
"Sorry," John laughs, pulling Sherlock a bit tighter in, wanting to lighten the mood a bit before they fall asleep, feeling a bit off-kilter and maybe needing some reassurances of his own. "But it's alright, yeah? It's alright that I want you so bloody much?"
The feeling of his phone vibrating in his hand with a text alert freezes John's thoughts in place as he scrambles to slide the locked screen open, palm sweating with anticipation, the sight of his roommate's name lighting up his cellphone such a relief.
The straightening of John's spine is sharp and immediate, body pulling taut with boiling rage at the bully's words, mouth pinning itself into a line, white, furious line. Sherlock gives his hand a squeeze.
"We're here," John announced.
"No, I'm fine."
read that, but I thought he would be back today."
"That's nice, erm…Christina," John said, squinting slightly as he read her name tag.
"Don't be glib," Moriarty said, raising his hand as if he were stopping traffic. "Not now, Sherlock, not when you're to blame for all this. Do you know how long I've been keeping tabs on you?"
Someone came into the loo and went to the urinal. Through the crack of the door, Benedict saw a broad back in a chalk-striped suit, and a messy blond head of hair. The man unzipped, pissed, shook off, and zipped up again. He left without washing his hands, and the door hissed closed.
Sherlock stalked to the table, picked the vase up, and held it in his hand lightly, as if it were a live grenade. He hesitated for an instant, then gave in to impulse and hurled it across the room, where it shattered against the wall, staining the doubtless ruinously expensive wallpaper and leaving shards of crystal and velvety petals scattered on the thick carpet.
Mycroft brought the phone back to his ear. "Yes. May I ask why you've decided to drop it?"
"So what was Lord Moran doing there?"
Gautam drew himself up in fussy indignation. “I tell you I never –”
Mycroft stared up at the house and drew a deep sigh. If he had considered this a social obligation, he'd certainly never have come, but the object of his mission had proved disturbingly elusive of late. Cornering prey in its den was the obvious but hardly ideal move; with any luck she wouldn't suspect his motives until it was too late.
Reluctantly, Sherlock wrenched his gaze from the glorious instrument, but held his ground. "You were well-acquainted with Meredith Howe."
"What did you say?" Sherlock looked horrified.
"Not to me."
The Bart’s crowd had come and gone, and Molly didn’t know why she was still sat at a table in the corner, nursing her second beer. She was out of place in her fluffy jumper and khaki trousers – the evening crowd had arrived, the women in clingy dresses, high heels, and long, glittery threads of earrings, the men in dark jeans and smart jackets. She’d never had the knack of dressing sexily and making it look effortless; she always looked wrong somehow. And it wasn’t as if she hadn’t read her share of magazines and watched fashion shows on telly, but she didn’t know how other women did it.
"Okay. Look, we've got to get you walking, get you out of here. I'll get you to hospital." She paused. If Jim came back and discovered Sherlock gone and one of his henchmen dead, that would fuck her plans up, fuck everything up. He couldn't be allowed to escape, not now, especially not with John and Nora vulnerable. But Sherlock needed medical attention.
"I sent you the guest list from the party held the same night of Meredith Howe's bash."
"Fine, thanks." Sherlock stepped over the threshold into organised chaos. Boxes sat everywhere, haphazard on the floor, sitting on furniture, stacked atop each other, numbered, colour-coded, and labelled.
Benedict smiled back. Playing Sherlock opposite Martin playing John was one thing; this was different. It wasn't that he didn't dive deeply into the role – he did, he was as immersed as a working actor could conceivably be. And yet, there was always a layer of professional distraction it wasn't possible to eliminate:  nuances of gesture, of facial expression, awareness of props, hitting marks, timing dialogue. None of it was effortless, though a good enough actor made it look that way. He hoped he did. This, though….
"God damn it, Sherlock…." Uneasily, John looked around, afraid to hammer on the door lest the hotel staff come. No, that wasn't right. Something wasn't right.
"I fail to see how that's relevant."
John chuckled. "Yeah, 'course I did." He turned away, his heart sore, and lifted the pasta from the cooker, pouring it into a colander to drain.
Benedict nodded. "Of course."
In some ways, he wished he’d never heard that Eurus was still alive. Not that he wished her dead, God no. Whatever else, she was his daughter, and he loved her. But a knot of apprehension had taken up permanent lodgings in his chest, and there were times that he wanted to flee from all familial obligation.
Mycroft scowled. "Are you going, or do you plan to stand there and waste time making a scene?"
Sherlock whipped out Cumberbatch's phone and found a residential search engine.
John flinched backward and felt a bite of pain at his wrists. Unyielding plastic, uncomfortably tight.
"You're starting to scare me, Sherlock."
"Stupid," he whispered, and lay back on the bed. So stupid, not to understand the havoc he'd wrought until it was far too late. Stupider still to carelessly burn a hundred bridges and expect the hundred and first match he'd tossed not to kindle.
Scowling, he turned over a leaf in his notebook and examined the feverishly scribbled notes he'd made a few nights ago.
"Mr. Cumberbatch, do you know why you're here?"
John clenched his fists. They weren't dead-broke; they both worked, and even though the mortgage was astronomical and he'd been spending a bit more than usual lately, they covered expenses and had money for treats now and then. Neither of their demands were grandiose, and Nora hadn't yet hit the age where material wealth mattered a lot. But in the two weeks that Mary's Aunt Trish had been in London, she and Nora had spent time with her, soaking up the unattainable atmosphere of complete luxury. Nora had come home chattering about the delights of tea at the Connaught, hampers from Fortnum and Mason, and the pretty dresses at Harrods and Harvey Nichols. And Mary had been banging on about sending Nora to St Teresa's School – more than five thousand a term in fees alone, not including room, board, uniforms, excursions – and in bloody Surrey, close but not close enough for a daily back-and-forth drive. They'd argued over it numerous times and it had come down to two points of contention:  it was far too expensive, and he didn't want Nora to leave. She was
"They can if someone's selling on the quiet," Sherlock said. "I doubt all these names are the entirety of fugitive Nazis. There were thousands, some who had enormous caches of knowledge. Picture it, John – you're on the run, and you can't take loads of art and objects with you. But you know where it is – buried in mines, under abandoned factories, in church crypts, in the cellars of great houses. Assuming many of those pieces are quite well-hidden, what would you do about it?"
“Sort of?” Janine said. “He’s not my type, really. I’m more of a Daniel Craig sort of girl. But he’s bloody interesting and smart and I reckon I was dazzled for a month or so. Wish he’d let me keep the ring, but what can you do?”
"Yeah, you love it. I'm going to douse myself in it every night now. Turn-on. Hot, hot, hot."
John blinked. "What?"
"Fine," John sighed. "You think he was dodging you, then?"
"Why's that?"
I'll be heading out of town this week and then dealing with the beginning of the semester at the university where I work, so there will be a delay before I post the next chapter. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
Sherlock looked up through a curtain of wet hair and saw Cumberbatch glaring down at him. "Oh. Hello."
"Just a headache."
"Thank you, Mary." Sherlock turned to John. "No vase, John?"
"John." Sherlock leant forward. "I've come to ask you not to leave London. Stay. Stay with me, you and Eleanor both."
He smiled apologetically at the woman across from him. "Pardon me, Madam Chancellor. Emergency line." He opened the text and read it with a sinking heart.
fucking angry. I know I should have got over it a long time ago, I know that, I
"Will do. Thanks." John beamed at her, but she'd already gone back to her phone. Funny; he'd become almost invisible at some point. He'd noticed it in the past year or so – women never gave him a second glance, or almost never. Probably Sherlock still drew attention – he was still glamorous, with the coat and hair and all.
Henry's reassuring tone gave Tom a tiny measure of hope. He pressed his lips together – it hurt to do, but better than having his mouth prised open for hours – and dared to meet Henry's gaze. "Henry," he croaked, "this is a really, really bad joke."
A limping, inadequate consolation.
"Oh, God. Molly." He fastened his arms round her waist and pulled her close.
John probably hadn't even noticed the differences between him and Cumberbatch.
"Oh, for God's sake," Mycroft intoned. "Be ready promptly at seven, Sherlock." Mycroft rang off.
"I want to see her," he said. "Please, could I just see her?"
The laughter drained out of him, leaving a knot of anger in his chest. Stupid – Christ, why was he being stupid? It wasn't as if Sherlock had done anything wrong, or even unusual. He'd been cordial, breezy even, he looked fine – his hair was shorter than John had ever seen it and his gait was a bit funny, as if he'd hurt his leg but was doing his best to play it off – and obviously he was working, so it was business as usual; they'd both got on with their lives. So what right had John to be angry? It wasn't as if he wanted Sherlock to be miserable. Much.
, John would have tutted.
"Loved you in
"Oh, he's fine. At least, I think he's fine. He was fine when I last saw him, anyhow. Of course, he'd been taken prisoner by Moriarty, and John –"
"Oh, are you my nanny now?" Sherlock returned. "Lovely." He got up, though, and followed TWH downstairs.
"An overt move – he is torturing your brother." John pulled the second photo up again and shoved the phone in Mycroft's face. "And that's your piss-poor excuse, that you were busy? Jesus Christ!"
"Mail. I'll be right there." Frowning, he opened the envelope and withdrew a large photograph, a blonde woman in a black dress lying on her back, eyes closed. John squinted and held the photo away. There was something odd about the woman's angle, her –
"Thousands?" John felt a little sick. Thousands of pounds on clothes? "Mary, did you
The moment was broken. Sherlock sat and proffered his beer. "Want to throw this one?"
A woman in a green uniform joined John in the corridor. "Mr. Holmes? Would you mind stepping out here, please? I understand you've had a bad shock."
"You've been very cloak-and-dagger about all this, Mycroft, but frankly I can't see much motivation. Was she a friend of yours? Girlfriend, maybe?" Sherlock teased.
"Are you going to fight this, John?"
John, weapon drawn, stepped into the corridor. For a split second he looked down, expecting to see red dots dancing over his chest, but there was nothing, only darkness. And then, a small bright light went on – a phone, illuminating a pale face.
pointless.
John's hand tightened on Benedict's, then let go. "Hello, Mycroft."
"Nope." Sherlock popped his P. "I'll be fine. Thanks."
Mycroft's words came rushing back, sending hot tendrils of guilt and shame into Sherlock's neural pathways. How much damage had his pride and stubbornness caused? Could he have ended all this much sooner or prevented it altogether? He could scarcely bring himself to pick up his hand and rest it on John's head; when he finally did, John's weeping intensified.
Benedict compressed his mouth into a tight line. Moriarty. Moriarty was why. Even if things weren't happening exactly according to the script, there still remained his manipulation of the justice system, elaborate false identity, manoeuvring crimes to discredit Sherlock – and Sherlock wasn't
“Why not?” Greg followed Mycroft through the house – God, wasn’t it posh! – and onto a terrace facing an elaborately manicured garden that could have held Greg’s – well, Miranda’s house. An enormous garden in the middle of London. The rain had stopped, and an almost-full moon turned the lush grass greenish-silver. Mycroft handed Greg a cigarette and clicked a silver lighter. Greg cupped his hand round the flame, briefly touching Mycroft’s fingers. “Ta.” He inhaled and blew out a plume of smoke. Mycroft lit his own fag and they smoked in companionable silence for a few moments.
"No, listen, please." Tom put a finger against Sherlock's lips. "You know this is new to me – this," he said, waving a hand between both of them, "the fire and potency of it, and the public scrutiny, all the media attention. I've never been much good at hiding, and the only reason I'm a good liar is because I'm a fair actor. I want to shout about us from every rooftop, and I can't, I know that, but sometimes it makes me a bit barmy, you know? I don't want to fuck it up. I love you." He drew Sherlock close and kissed him.
Slowly, Sherlock broke the kiss and pulled away. "I missed you as well."
Doing his utmost to control the shaking in his hands, Benedict reached for the front of Mycroft's trousers.
His hand froze. In fact, his whole body froze. Martha looked away and stifled a giggle.
"Yeah." John let out an abbreviated chuckle. "So…if you want to keep doing this, after this case I mean, then I'd be – I'd like to. If you're all right with that."
"Clippers." Benedict closed his eyes and sniffed the paper, then took a longer sniff. "Dunhill Distinct. Mm."
Fee, sixty thousand pounds. Private sale, purchaser undisclosed. Lord Moran certainly made a nice living.
meant? Surely he hadn't actually had sex with Tom? He wasn't even interested in sex, for God's sake.
There was a pause. "No reason."
"Protection," Irene replied promptly. "It's important to build a stronghold in this world, Mr. Holmes. There are so
John buttoned his trousers. "Want any help?" He held a hand out.
"Is Mycroft looking after you?"
Benedict pointed at the door.
"There. Was that so hard?" Sherlock sighed.
"It does to me."
"Yes." Mary took a deep breath. "You rest a bit. I'm going to go downstairs again – there's some useful stuff down there, I think."
"First?"
"Dr Watson."
"Damn it," Mycroft whispered, and threw the bedclothes aside. He found his phone and dialled. "Have you established a trace yet?" He listened and shook his head. "Don't stop until you've found something. Right. No, absolutely not. Not until I tell you. Yes." He rang off and pulled the message up again.
"And sometimes, funnily enough, the buyer is Lord Moran."
A strange, shivering laugh hopped out of his throat, and the driver glanced at him in the mirror. "All right, mate?"
"What if I refuse?"
"Same way I took care of Katie Thorpe."
"Mm." Sherlock settled back against the sofa so he wouldn't fall and closed his eyes, waiting.
John stared at him. "Did you get that out of a book or something?"
Sherlock managed to keep his eyes from rolling upward thanks to herculean effort. "And I was thinking it might be a nice sort of tie-in to sponsor a charity do here. For research. You could…oh, I don't know…auction off a date with me."
Sherlock frowned at Tom, who was wearing what looked like rugby shorts and nothing else, sprawling across Cumberbatch's bed as if he owned it, all legs and arms. He had a brief flashback to their short intimate encounters, and his face got warm again. "I don't think that hurting
Sherlock blinked and frowned again, and emitted a questioning grunt, hoping Henry wouldn't start on him right away. It would be difficult to fight denailed.
His phone buzzed with a text, and he frowned, picking it up. Unknown number. Annoying – as many precautions as he took to keep his number private, he couldn't prevent the odd misdial. He opened the text.
? A boyfriend? You thought we'd traipse around the world and run some sort of crime-for-hire outfit and whisper sweet nothings in each other's ear?"
"You can blame yourself until the end of time, but it won't change a bloody thing," Sherlock said bluntly. "Did you tell Nora that?"
"Ah, I see. Bit of a limp," Mary said.
"No. No, I think I'd like to walk. Doctor's instructions anyhow." Sherlock tapped his leg with the cane.
Her cries tore through him, shredding him from his throat to the pit of his belly, and he gathered her close and then picked her up. "All right, darling. All right." Tears choked off the rest of his words; he buried his face in her fragrant hair, and they wept together.
"Yeah, I know, but I've come a long way and it's late and I don't want to wake them. Can't you tell me? I swear I won't breathe a word to anybody," Sherlock wheedled.
"There you are." Sherlock kept looking, but found no other photographs resembling another young Moran male.
"No, don't move him! Where's the goddamned ambulance?"
"Oh, Sherlock –" John kissed him again, lingering, his tongue slipping into Sherlock's mouth, suckling gently. He pulled back, shuddering. "We've got to stop."
"Not to worry, Mr Cumberbatch. You'll be home in no time at all."
August 2014
"He's at home. With Nora," Mary said, battling the terror that threatened to choke her. "Should I call –"
"Well, not…I've been there, of course. Actually, it's been pretty exciting. I got to see New York and Albuquerque and Ohio –"
"Fuck," he muttered, and rubbed his eyes. Christ, didn't Mary get bored? Did the mundanity of ordinary life never back up on her? What would have happened if he'd taken the flash drive Sherlock had offered him and he'd read it? He'd known what she'd done, details wouldn't have mattered. But maybe knowing them would have helped; maybe they could have discussed them. Maybe if they had, things would be different today.
For a moment Mycroft simply watched her, cataloguing each movement. When he'd had enough, he stepped forward. "Lady Howe."
They didn't speak in the lift, or in the corridors heading back toward the street. They collected their IDs from the guard and went back outdoors. The sky had turned darker, and rain threatened.
He'd opened Sherlock's mobile with no difficulty at all – thumbed the code as if he'd always known it. Cautiously, he peered down at the phone again. A regular iPhone, black case, nothing special about it. Except he knew the code.
Sherlock closed his eyes. "Think nothing of it." He really wanted a bath, but the urge to sleep was even stronger.
"Well, here's our little hero, awake at last!"
Molly looked at Janine’s beautiful, totally open countenance. She hadn’t shagged Sherlock. And she’d fancied him, but in the end he hadn’t wanted her and it was all right, she was all right, she wasn’t nursing her memories. And John….
Tom closed and double-locked the door, then surveyed Ben up and down. "You look a little ragged."
The cloth settled softly over Sherlock's face. Christ. He thrashed, trying to wrench his head free from the punishing grip on his hair, but Two – callused hands, ground-in odour of thermite – grasped him beneath the chin and pushed his head further back, forcing it against the hard wood of the chair.
The female paramedic patted the stretcher. "Right. Shall we?"
"Did they drug him as well?"
"Did you do it, Dr Watson?"
Benedict pasted an expression of, he hoped, sultry boredom on his face. "Sherlock Holmes to see Irene Adler."
of needles."
"Well, well," Moriarty said, his dark eyes agleam in his white face. "Feeling better?"
"No, you haven't. You hardly even touched a violin until you started filming
Mary sighed. "Yeah. I thought that might be the case." A tired, mirthless smile stretched her lips. She'd thought that Sherlock had been the biggest threat to her marriage for so long – Sherlock under the shadowy grey London sky, recklessly pursuing the murderous, the larcenous, the malicious, and never once pausing to look up to examine that shadow. Poor Sherlock. She owed him an apology. "I need a few favours from you, Tim. And that's it. We're done, you and me."
"Not always, though."
It had been a while, certainly, since he'd cleaned the flat, but even Sherlock had to admit the place was looking uninviting. He couldn't carbon-date the layers of dust, but he was able to detect distinct strata – perhaps it was time for a quick tidying. Mycroft had, a few years ago, reluctantly offered the use of his cleaning service, but Sherlock hated strangers touching his things, and the idea of people shifting and displacing his perfectly ordered possessions (to him, anyhow; who cared if nobody else understood his filing systems?) was unacceptable. He opened the curtains, raised the window sashes, then rolled up his sleeves and got to work.
"That's it. That's – ah, God, yeah." Mary undulated beneath him, her thighs gripping his hips.
"Well," Mycroft said, once the young man had departed. "Have you made any progress?"
“Sorry, darling,” John murmured, but couldn’t resist a smile. If she managed to gather enough energy to howl, then she wasn’t doing too badly. He inserted the thermometer in her ear, prompting struggling and more wailing. “Hang on, just a second, it’s coming out, hang on.” The readout was a not-alarming 37.4. “Not too bad. Let’s get you a drink and get you back in bed.”
It was terrible, cheap romance-novel stuff, but Sherlock's face was hot and his cock stirred. Uneasily, he opened another story.
"Sherlock, do you have a girlfriend?"
John stared at Sherlock for a long time without speaking. Sherlock wondered what he'd said to offend John and was about to ask when John stood up. "Stay here for a second." He left the room and went upstairs, returning with a slim tablet that he opened up onto the table. Sitting down heavily, he began typing, then pushed the tablet over to Sherlock. "Have a look at that."
A silvery red haze of pure fury glazed Jim's vision; he sat perfectly still. For the first time in years he had a compulsion, almost too powerful to deny, to commit physical violence, to wrap his hands around Molly's skinny little neck and squeeze and squeeze until her face turned blue and her eyes bulged and her tongue lolled out of her mouth. He hadn't been hands-on in years and years, and now –
"More than that?" Moriarty asked brightly.
Tresler laughed again. "Dr Watson, would you be kind enough to fetch my cigarettes?"
"You didn't eat the food I ordered, even though it's your favourite."
Sherlock shook his head. "Twenty-two million. Where did it come from? You said –"
"Why in God's name would I want to do that?"
"Yeah, it was fun. We did racing dives. Janey got a new kitten."
"Ugh, don't talk about it." Molly waved a hand. "All I can eat is rice and plain chicken and this stuff. Greg does acupressure on my hands after I throw up, but it doesn't always help. The nausea usually passes after a few hours, though." She slid her ID card through the reader, and the lab door clicked open. "The powers that be gave me a respirator with organic vapour cartridges while I'm working with Formalin, so that's nice, at least. Right, you go ahead and get started – I've got to throw up again." She disappeared through another door.
"Is there any other type of fan?" Sherlock snorted and closed his eyes.
"Oh, God," Benedict sobbed. "Please don't. Please." Thrashing fruitlessly against his bonds as Mycroft moved behind him, he tried to shrink away and shouted at the top of his lungs. "Help! Someone please help me!
John smiled wryly. "Yeah, he said he knew Moriarty was alive and kicking. He tried to keep you out of kicking range."
"He didn't say what it was about?" John asked through a mouthful of pasta.
"In the wardrobe," she said, climbing slowly off the bed. John wasn't sure if that was fear he saw in her eyes, but it was something already far too adult for a nine-year-old girl.
"Yeah," John said. "I'm having fun."
Sherlock bent over the scope. "Plans? I haven't got any. Why?"
They felt their way through the leafy darkness, following the road but keeping to the wooded area, steadily pelted by rain and slipping on mud and vegetation. Sherlock's knee was beginning to ache despite John's expert bandaging, but he kept as swift a pace as he could, determined to go faster than John. This was heady stuff, and he didn't want to spoil the moment by being an invalid. He quickened his steps and slid sideways, pinwheeling his arms for balance.
Sherlock blinked. "What?"
Sherlock smiled.
Sherlock waved an impatient hand. "I told you, I'm fine." And he was. He was feeling marvellous, actually, and they'd lost far too much time already.
"What? God, of course I do. Not just because you're telling me, but because…well, I've got some stories as well."
Sherlock clasped his hands gleefully. "The do that Lord Moran attended on the night of Lady Howe's death?"
He sat up, and sure enough, there was Cumberbatch. But he….
Now all he needed to do was get home.
Tom felt a little better, and went into the kitchen to brew a pot of strong tea and make some sandwiches. Rummaging in the fridge, he found some prosciutto and cheese and lettuce and a jar of sun-dried tomatoes in oil and got to work, chopping and slicing and spreading, setting the stuff out on plates. The bell rang and he went to the door, wiping his hands on the seat of his jeans and peering into the peephole.
"Nice," John snapped. "Two of your men died, you know."
John let him go. "Sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry…." He gathered Sherlock into his arms again, embraced him gently, and held him away. "I'm sorry. I just…please, I just want you to be honest with me. Please. Did you really not trust me, or think that I couldn't keep my mouth shut?"
"Yeah, love?"
"Yeah, I suppose." Nora took the last lemon biscuit from the plate. "Can we really go to tea at the whatever?"
Sherlock opened his eyes. "You're going to sabotage your own stores."
Nora eyed the white carrier bags on the table with suspicion. "Takeaway again?"
The water trickled through his fingers and splashed onto the slightly dirty surface of the sink.
"Those things are always easier to bear with people you love, and who love you. And I do love you, John. So very much. I couldn't bear it if you left."
Lovely, lovely man. She reached for the little box on her side table and opened it to reveal a short row of bonbons. She picked one out and popped it into her mouth. Delicious. By half eight, she’d feel no pain.
"I certainly haven't got the art and objects that you do."
"It's okay. Well…you know what I mean," Tom said. "It's not okay, actually. He's always been a bully. I'm a little tired of it."
"Never mind. I'll look after her." Mycroft rose to his feet and went to the door. "I'll make the arrangements. Go speak to your daughter."
Sherlock shook his head, widening his eyes. "Not quite. Is it really bothering you?"
"Yes, I know." She smiled, displaying dazzling white teeth.
Sherlock took it.
Nora's eyes shone, and she put her little hand in Sherlock's large one. He undid her belt with one hand, scooped up her purple backpack, and drew her down the aisle, then guided her down the stairs toward the black car that waited at the end of the runway. She broke free from Sherlock's grip and ran.
"Ow." Cumberbatch examined his palm.
John saw the flash as well. "Shit,
Sherlock wanted to kick Moriarty in the teeth. He squeezed his eyes shut – God, his head ached – and concentrated. Dedalus Communications wasn't suffering financially. They were neck-and-neck with Apple, rolling out a new mobile phone, huge memory, amazing screen resolution, 3D and projection capability, cheap data plan. Launch parties, special celebrity guests, the lot. Moriarty was funnelling massive commissions and sales monies to terrorist cells in cities with Dedalus stores. Bookkeeping…there had been something incriminating in that paperwork, enough to prod Meredith Howe into confronting Moriarty.
He waited a long time, but Tom never replied.
Sherlock managed to nod his head, but it was an effort.
your type? The procession of women through the flat is so quick that it's difficult to work out any commonalities."
Not an explanation.
I must once again thank kimberlite and vilestrumpet for their amazing beta and Britpicking work. Their close attention and careful reading and encouragement were more than motivational; they were inspirational. Thank you so very much. <3
"Clearly not," Benedict spat. "Why don't you enlighten me?"
"Well, okay,
"I will, I will. You're too impatient. One of
John's frame sagged a bit. His expression changed, though, his brow knotting. "You –"
"Trying to talk some sense into you."
John had never been one to sit idly by and let other people pick up the lion's share of burden, and he especially didn't want to do that now, when Jim Moriarty was verbally sparring with an actor who looked just like Sherlock. Or had Sherlock's body, or some such bizarre rubbish. He still couldn't get it straight. At any rate, it wasn't his best friend, it was an actor, and now he couldn't believe that he'd been hoodwinked for so long. Benedict, or Ben, had done a fine job, no question, but there were so many little things that added up wrongly – that little breakdown in the loo the other day should have tipped him off, but who would have possibly guessed that something so strange was happening?
"Jeff Hope." Moriarty smiled, all but plucking an unfortunate canary's feathers from his mouth.
John turned Benedict's hand over and marvelled over the lack of injury. "You didn't do that…er, deliberately, did you, Sherlock?"
"Did you know what was going to happen?" John demanded, suddenly suspicious. Mycroft's perpetual composure was annoying at best.
"Can't imagine why," TWH murmured. "Well, I suppose it's just as well. If you'd cannoodled with anyone here –" He broke off, watching Sherlock's face.
Henry stopped. "If you're going to chunder, pal, do it now, otherwise you'll be sorry later." His voice had gone from warm and confiding to ice-cold.
"That's in the past. The way your history was.  Or so I thought." John felt fury surge again, and then diminish, leaving him with nothing but regret that burned hotter than his anger. He'd lost four years of Sherlock's friendship and love, and Sherlock had been right all along. And worse, had taken the blame for the rift.
"For a while, anyway," John said with another shrug. "Somewhere warmer for a while, somewhere not…connected with anything. Then, I don't know. We might travel for a few years."
Mycroft sighed. "I told Sherlock there would be ghosts."
In a flash he saw John's face:  disappointed.
Tresler smiled. "In a way. Some of those addresses were in England, Ireland, Wales. Eamonn's organisation needed money. I gave him some addresses. He did what he needed to do to obtain funds."
Mycroft sighed. "Do you know, for the first time in my life, you're an enigma to me?"
“But you needn’t be driven round the bend, my dear,” Gautam said. “They’re not your family. And only Mr Holmes is your tenant – as you said, Dr Watson has a house of his own. Worrying about them gains you nothing. I’m much more interested in your own lovely self.” He laid his hand on her thigh. “You’re simply delectable.”
Mary came back into the kitchen dressed in dark, form-fitting clothes and carrying a small overnight bag. She looked good. "I told her I'd be gone about a week."
"Fuck – what?" Tom got to his feet. "Moriarty? Is Ben in danger?"
"I don't
"No."
"It's all right."
The flat of someone's hand struck his cheek with enough force to cause pain. "Wake up. What did they give you?"
His complexion unflatteringly ashen against the indigo suit, Guthrie shook his head. "It's all perfectly legal."
"You might try looking for another job soon."
Ennui…well, no more than was ordinary. And the irritating Nosy Parker was right:  Sherlock hadn't anything much going on at the moment, but he would have happily spent the entire year cleaning the flat rather than listening to his brother's tiresome exhortations and ominous, yet thoroughly vague, predictions about the threat to the United Kingdom, good God. As if Mycroft didn't have enough to keep him occupied on a global level, he had to try Sherlock's already limited patience with the monotonous peregrinations of his thoughts on a near-weekly basis.
"I've got it." Tom grinned. "It's brilliant."
"Lady Howe," Sherlock prompted.
"Jesus," John whispered. "Erm, okay." He got off the bed clumsily. "I'll just – are you coming?"
"Shh." Benedict helped John to his feet.
"Now is that the movie the pair of you were in?" Henry inquired.
"No, I'm staying in town tonight. Had to run a few errands and told Graham I'd ferry his cheap arse to Jin Kichi, save him eight quid on a cab ride, but made him promise to come here first. I really –" He shifted a bit. "Really sorry about that. Bloody childish. Hope, er, Benedict's not too upset with us."
A tray was proffered by another white-toothed young man. "Champagne, sir?"
Horsehair, country complexion, past history, enough money to buy or hire what he needed, resentment or contempt poorly disguised, familiar enough that TWH wouldn't be suspicious until it was far too late.
was a sexy piece – and maybe, just maybe, his big brother. Mostly John. The look on Sherlock's face at the pool when he'd seen John strapped into the bomb – that had been priceless, but it hadn't been love. First of all, John Watson wasn't gay. He'd told the
