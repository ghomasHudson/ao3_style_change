“Mom!”  Thanos came skidding around the corner, face flushed as he excitedly began rambling, “You won’t believe it! You won’t believe it! They asked
thankful for the opportunity, and he was just saying how excited he was to work with other villains-”
that they were assigned to. He did not deem it necessary, and legally it wasn’t. Their lives were directly related to how much bullshit they were willing to deal with. The only saving grace they had was that being a social justice warrior was very popular lately, and a good amount of the public didn’t quite want child-Thanos dead yet. It’s not like he had succeeded on the whole world, or universal, domination thing.
“I personally think he’s too old for you, Petey. Don’t be embarrassed! He should be ashamed, I mean, he was supposed to be the adult in this situation.” Muttered Deadpool sulkily.
“Stop it, Charles.” Hissed Erik gently twisting out of Charles grasp, “this is ridiculous.” Erik continued to mutter irritably under his breath as Charles playfully tried to shush him. Eventually, Erik sank back into his chair and fixed a glare to anyone still looking their way. Specifically, at Thanos, who has been unable to tear his eyes from Charles Xavier since the moment he rolled up.
“Wait a minute!” Loudly interrupted Deadpool, who had long ago escaped his cocoon and was currently trying to force himself into Spiderman’s lap, “So, this
“Yeah.” Olive’s twin was Thanos’ second favorite hero, much to Olive’s annoyance. Again, the irony was not lost on her about his preferences. In truth, the original Thanos was not fond of her brother, and by the end of the altercation he probably hated him. Sage was half of the reason that Thanos was in this situation to begin with, and the reason she was in this whole mess.
Olive could hear the rustling of the men on either side of her raising their hands. Bitterly, she couldn’t bring herself to raise her hand. It isn’t fair to have the expectation that small child somehow be a “hero”. He barely stopped wetting the bed six months ago, and is struggling with a complex identity crisis. Yeah, he wasn’t a hero, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t a good person.
“Those are some of the only kids here.” Chided Sage as he noted the time on this watch, “And, aren’t you supposed to be in a meeting now?”
Olive rolled her eyes at the suggestion. His real name wasn’t even Star Lord; it was Peter Quill. Which, in her opinion, was a very, very boring name. She had met him a handful of times, and each time the meeting was more hostile than the last. The last time she saw him was while visiting her brother, and he basically screamed in her face with his hands around her neck. Peter Quill was the last person this child should be idolizing, and she hoped he never had to learn that first-hand.
“Oh! Oh!” At this point, Olive wasn’t even surprised by her rotten luck. She hasn’t caught a break since she was sixteen years old. In fact, she has long accepted that the worse possible would always be the outcome when Thanos was involved.
Steve’s flinch at Thanos’ name was subtle, but she still noticed it. Olive has endured many reactions to Thanos’ name; often, it was an angry outburst. At times Olive wondered if Thanos ever noticed the ones who got by with a subtle flinch. She could tell that Steve was always conflicted when it came to them. During the trial, he had believed her to some extent, or, at least enough to advise the world to
Bruce finally signaled for them to lower their arms and it seemed that the boys were ready for reconciliation. Both were finished crying and Steve took the lead apologizing. After all, he was much older than the young man he spent the afternoon arguing with.
It had only been two days since Pepper had come into my life, but I wanted to impress her. I did not have much to offer, besides my natural talent for woodwork and the possibility of making her quite a lot of money if she found a good enough Alpha for me.
As a child does, I threw the ring on the ground and hurtled into my bed, hugging my pillow close as I sobbed.
Two days in the back of a farmer’s cart, covered by fleece and leather and sheep skin. Heimdell told Thor at night about the unrest within the general population.
Pepper looked surprised. “No. Why do people always ask me that?” She took my hands and squeezed them. “There’s a movement taking place right under their noses. New Omega Rights Movement, but it covers everyone. You, me, Alphas who do not want well-trained objects as Omegas but instead want companions, life partners. And Tony, I have six to do right by you.”
The ceremony usually went as followed: Omegas only, besides the Match Makers, who sit in a semi-circle around a raised stage. The of Age Omegas would sit at the front, the younger ones at the back. The Omega who the ceremony was for would kneel on the stage as their Match Maker stood to the left of them, their mother on the right.
I took a fresh piece of paper and thought about what Dr. Banner had set me. Something useful in an office. I felt a little bit stuck. Useful in an office?
As she walked away, Brunnhilde took the opportunity. With a stern tug, she took Loki by the wrist. Her eyes were wide. “What are we going to do, Prince?”
The smirk fading into a thick frown that allowed the curves of the moustache to frame the downward snarl of his dry lips. Eyes widening in shock, as to process the piece of information that he had previously thought to be impossible, then closing in despair. The family name would end at him, the Omega child would require so much more maintenance and protection… the ability to feel pride died inside my father that day. Howard Stark, genius Alpha, father of an only-child Omega. How he must have wished the world pitied him that day!
“He did not place the ring on my finger! It is not a promise yet!” I cried, trying to run out of the door. Rhodey had to put it on my finger!
My father needed an heir to keep the family fortunes, the prestige that comes with being a Stark. A strong Alpha who would no doubt keep the family name and traditions and power alive. An Omega is a disgrace to the family name – worth only what extra power a marriage can bring. And that is what I became, the moment the doctor inspected by newly born nakedness and declared that I was an Omega.
I froze and the once fluffy bread in my mouth turned to led. I could feel it poisoning me as my entire body turned cold. I was about to be found in a manor full of books with no Alpha in sight, no way to explain why I was so UnOmega, why God should not punish me for my actions.
“Once more.” Tony says and Butterfingers releases another barrage of cuts, that the poor little thing couldn’t endure being mismatched in level.
To say Steve was bewildered when he woke up it was one hell of an understatement. He woke up in a bland room in Unova, the radio playing in the background, that was the first thing that confused him, the baseball game that was playing he had been to that game, before the war. The second thing that had him confused was only made more obvious when a young woman in kitten heels walked into the room. He sat up then looked around the room then at her.
“Dazzling Gleam.” Once again the prismatic light began to swirl around Voleur and the room as he shoots towards the Umbreon she jumps up slightly taking the hit but on her own terms, she lands on her paws and slides back looking unaffected, she had certainly taken damage she was obviously very good at hiding it.
“Match start!” Bruce declares, and both Tony and Steve throw their first choices into the arena having both agreed that this way no one could delay then change their mind. After all, this was a trainer battle, not a gym battle, Steve didn’t have to win this in order to prove he could fight.
“Let’s finish this with Giga Impact.” Steve says calmly, his eyes watching the movements of both Pokemon on the field, giving Tony the impression that the only reason he won as easily as he had was because Steve had been unsure of how much battling had changed over the years and was just trying finding his feet with him. He would have to battle him another time to be sure however.
“We actually came up here for a reason.” Steve started as Feya and Jammira got off their respective laps to play with Star and You. “I was doing some reading and I read that you used to be a gym leader.” He finished focusing on Tony.
“Stark’s are a weird people.” Tony shrugs again as Clint and his Aipom, Clicker came out to stand with the other men.
Natasha stands on her side of the arena, her Popplio never leaving her arms. Tony isn’t sure how aware the little guy is of the situation, being so young, but either way, he cheerily flaps a flipper at Steve who can’t help himself and waves back.
“I’ll do it.” is all he says before standing up and leaving for his workshop. He can feel the others watching him as Pepper follows behind him on silent feet to the lift that takes them both to the expansive workshop and laboratory that sat in right in the centre of gravity for the building, to account for explosions, and Hulk-outs while still keeping the building standing. Unsurprisingly, Bruce was already in there, both his Pokemon and several of Tony’s watching him with great interest as he mixed some chemicals. “You know, they’ll all go back in their balls if you order it, right?”
“So. This is some big news.” Natasha announces as she comes in, looking at Happy but not even looking surprised before she walks up to Tony and cuddles Jammira’s face as the little fox coos at the affection.
“You know, I never noticed how creepy it was with how in-sync they are until you pointed it out.” Clint remarked after the doors had closed.
“So far it looks that way. They’ve been living together for the past year and have gone on a few small missions. Luckily we haven’t had to test them in more dangerous situations just yet. Stark is the only one who really presents a problem.”
He circled around his hole again. Gently rubbing. He felt his finger softly breached it. Peter jumped and pushed Wade off of him.
“ I would like to do it again tonight too, if your body would allow it. I know that since you’re older, your body may not be able to handle as much stress as when you were younger.”
“ Mommy still dropping you off at school? I thought you were a senior, don’t they know what? What a loser. Catch you later.” Before he left he slapped Peters books and binder out of his hands, causing it to hit the floor.
“ Come on, I know it’s a hot piece of ass but he doesn’t like you. The man sent an RPG at us last week.”
Breakfast was a hectic affair with a bunch of people sitting on plush cushions that surrounded a low table.
“ He won’t intentionally kill you. If that is what you were wondering. He has developed a strange infatuation with you. Since you went off the grid he has been trying to track you down.  He has a while murder board thing going on in his office. It’s really creepy.”
I’m looking for a Tony x Steve fanfic. Steve gets teleported into another universe where Tony is locked up after being deemed a criminal. The other universes Steve doesn’t want to interacting with their Tony. Steve has to wait until his tony can open a portal to save him. At the end Steve’s Tony opens a portal and rescues him. The other universe Avengers are wary of him. Tony was able to open the portal by using the i dirt stones and with the help of Jane Foster. At the end the other universe Captain America makes amends with the other universes Tony and it can be alluded that they try to start a relationship.
James rolled his eyes but didn’t apologize as he began to eat his breakfast. Peter sighed, James has began to become a bigger pain in the ass lately and has even started to stay out late.
“ I don’t know. I’m debating to moving to Cambridge with you when you go to MIT.” Tony said without looking up from his phone.
Tony turned to look at him and gave him a salacious smile. “ Well I guess you aren’t too opposed with the idea, please continue.”
The two are in silence for a while, Tony enjoying the homemade meal. He needed to leave. Who knew what this Steve would do. The one in his universe almost killed him and they were friends. This one was a stranger and probably wouldn’t have any quarrels with offing him.
It didn’t take long for their foreplay to begin again. Steve kissed the inside of his thighs and licked his pussy ravenously.
I am also looking for a steve x Bucky fic. Bucky is the son of some politician, who happens to be his mom, that was a POW for several years and was recently brought back but has several injuries and Steve was assigned as his body guard. They then fall in love, but the his mom becomes upset. Please let me know if it sounds familiar.
Thor just shrugged and Grant walked out of the kitchen with Steve trailing behind him, plates of food stacked high.
“ Ok, so I made fried chicken, mashed potatoes, corn casserole, corn bread and sautéed green beans. . I hope everyone likes it. “ Grant said cheerily as he took his place next to
Peter whistled as he opened the front entrance of the run down apartment. He really needed to persuade Wade to invest in better housing. He really couldn’t find the appeal of living in a place where the ceiling was caving in. Peter opened the front door, the locking mechanism long since rusted away.
“No one is going to think less of you just because you didn’t show up for a meeting. Hell they porbabaly won’t blame you. Any of them would leave that meeting if they were giving to option of getting a piece of ass.”
“ I have to agree with Steve on this Tony. It’s probably not the best idea. We can do something else. I mean, we don’t mind lying for it.”
Tony looked around and saw that it was indeed. He was in his own room in the compound. He remembered this room. He noticed that he was in his bed. The one with the blue bed sheets and the soft silk sheets. It all felt so real.
Steve just rolled his eyes. He wouldn’t understand. He didn’t have his heart and soul die. He didn’t have his life crumble right in front of him. He just wanted Tony back.
“ My good bitch... my sweet little bitch... so good.... so good for me... gonna ride ya’..... gonna ride ya’ so good...”
“ Clint get your ass of the counter,” Bucky snapped, “ And Steve Schmidt told you to take him down to the lab to repair his suit. It’s obvious that he must have made it. Hell he was yelling about it when we took it away from him the first time.” Clint just stuck out his tongue at Bucky and didn’t leave his perch on the counter.
“ You know if you keep glaring like that your face is gonna stick like that. That’s what my mom used to always tell me,” Clint commented. Tony turned his glare toward him.
“ You hate Spider-Man. Everyone thinks he’s a stupid hero a-and no one likes me...” Peter kept sobbing, his face red and blotchy now.
Steve let Tony pin him. He remembered Nat telling him before that Tony hated to be pinned on his back. It had something to do with Afghanistan. Steve didn’t want to ask too much about it; it was a forbidden subject around Tony. The horrors he faced over there were better left forgotten.
“ Well I’m fine as long as the bitching has stopped.” Tony grumbled. He was tired off the pissing contest between the two.
Natasha rolled her eyes. “ I think you know the answer Clint. I’m pretty sure you were the one that helped him last night.”
“ I didn’t want to be on the team in the first place. You had an ex-Russian spy stalk me until I said yes.”
“ And then we have to make sure you have your check up. The doctor is finally back in town and just refuse to make a home visit. I swear, no one respects the crown.”
“ Peter, it’s a big thing and shouldn’t be taken lightly. It’s fine. We can try again some other time. We just got to excited and things moved a bit too fast. It’s fine.”
“ I-I hope so. Thank you.” Tony could practically hear him blushing and smiling from the praise. This was fucking nuts.
Tony didn’t even pay attention to the jibe as he stared in utter amazement at the merman who had just fainted at a little sexual innuendo.
“ Fuck!” Tony yelled and doubled over as a shrill cry pierced through the air. “ I thought you said this was going to protect me!” Strange was already in front of him hands placed in a defensive position.
“ Yeah. I’m sure you do.” War Machine states as he turned his attention to Bucky. “ All right Grunge metal if you let our boy go I won’t pummel your to a pulp.”
“ I love you Tony and I don’t want to do anything that upsets you ever. You can always talk to me.” Steve whispered as he ground his hips into him.
Tony shifted and that was when they seems to realize Tony’s lack of clothing. They both blushed and looked away. Tony smirked.
It went on like that for some time. Then I was worried that I would become pregnant one day and I didn’t want to have his kids so I ended up getting a tubal ligation. That same day, he heard about Rielly and found out that when he was alive he had been apparently sexting each other and part of it was about anal sex. We never done it and we decided not to do it because it was uncomfortable. But apparently in the texts I had been ok with it.
“ Keep fighting it feel so good once you’re under me.” Quentin said as he grabbed onto Peters crotch. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the drone move to get a better angle of his groping.
“ We heard about the fire in the kitchen and we wanted to make sure you were alright. Good thing we came because Steve was getting a little handsy. That little rat.” Howard seethed.
“ The Captain And Commander we’re indeed rigorous in their training today. Even as a god, I felt strain of their regimen.”
“ This is not funny. What type of friend are you? You are supposed to sympathize with me. And then help me solve this problem."
“ It seems so. He thought Natasha and Ms. Potts were um- a very unfriendly word. He wasn’t very kind in describing them. But he still wants to pursue a relationship with him.According to him, and these are his words, he is a ‘formidable bed partner and Tony will never be wanting.’”  Clint bursted out laughing as Tony looked flabbergasted.
Lunch was just as he could have predicted a total fucking nightmare. Steve has bumped Rhodey off a chair to sit next to Tony. Clint had threw breadsticks at Sam. Then his father had to argue with his brothers. The worst part of the meal was them senile old men decide to reminisce about earlier times.
“ They have been pretty chummy lately.” Clint said as he, Nat and Tony looked at the class conference room from their spot in front of theTV. The two were dressed quite similarly, khakis and plaid shirts. The only difference was that Grant wore red while Steve wore blue.
“ But he’s not so bad. He’s pretty nice and he cares for me. We weren’t even physical. He didn’t want to start a relationship until I turned 18.”
Steve finished cutting Tony’s food and turned to his own meal. Tony picked up his fork and began to eat. He heard a loud yawn and saw Bucky enter the kitchen.
He blockaded the door as well. This was a nightmare. This was a fucking nightmare. He was actually surrounded by Hydra.
Nat has for some reason taken a strong liking to Tony. She would usher him to sit at the breakfast table and make his breakfast, even going as far as cutting up some of his food like Steve occasionally does. She would also brush his hair, with some brush that always appeared out of thin air. She loved to ply pranks on Barton and even had prank wars with him.
“ And we have more pressing issues than your little gay exploration. Now come on.” With that she turned and walked away. Both men Groaned and followed her out.
Tony broke out of the hold and smiled at Winghead who looked a little putout. “ Hey buddy, I don’t put out on the first date. “ That was a total lie. He’ll sleep with anything, no date required. That was like his motto. But that motto didn’t apply to handsy and aggressive mermen.
“  I dare you. Return me and you will more than likely go back to celibacy. Kinda sad a king has to pay to get laid.” Tony seethed.
“ Uh-huh. I’m pretty sure he’s not the one that is uncomfortable. Are you uncomfortable Tony?” San asked him.
Grant was happy to oblige. Tony came with a silent scream and went limp in the arms holding him. Grant continued to assault his limp body until he came with a groan. Steve came on his back, dropping his head forward in Tony’s shoulder. Tony lifted his head and smiled, “ It’s your turn Steve.”
“ It’s nothing. “ Steve said hurriedly. For some reason he really didn’t want to hurt his feelings. Before he wouldn’t have cared but now, he felt guilty for the hurt look that was on his face. It was like he had some inkling of an idea as to what Steve said.
“ About a year ago when they traveled to visit one of their wolf- underlings, His friend, Bucky the one with the brown hair, bought him a whore.”
“ First of those so called school children were continually harassing the Children of Mr. Rogers and Thor’s younger brother to the of physical abuse. So these so called children were not innocent and were in fact bullying the children that Team Hydra calls family. This man protected said children and stood up for them when they were to scared to come forward to their family that something inexcusable was happening to them.”
Tony glared at Rhodey. The asshole pretty much knew how it was going. He just wanted to provoke him. Tony took a deep breath and counted to three. He wasn’t going to give in to his anger today.
And before he knew it, he was walking over there and taking up the seat next to him. Steve flagged down the bartender and asked for some whiskey. Tony had gave him a sideways looked with a perfect eyebrow raised.
. He felt two hands on his hips from behind. He turned his head slightly to see who it was. Peter didn’t really know the guy. He knew he was on the baseball team and that was about it. He didn’t mind and continued to dance.
“ Just out of curiosity when was the last time he had sex?” It was hard to believe that this guy had it often seeing as was absolutely abhorrent.
Tony felt someone grab his arm and pull him toward a muscular chest. He began to struggle. “ Get off me you prick,” He snarled.
The man with the dark hair shook his head. “We didn’t mean it as an insult. It’s just that Steve... well... he has standards I guess you can say-“
Peter quietly jumped in through the bedroom window and noticed no one there. He smiled, he was going to get him this time. He peeked at the door and looked both ways to make sure that the coast was clear. He heard someone humming a melody. He silently scaled the wall, the apartment was old and the floors often creaked  with any weight so this was the best option. A mischievous smile adorned his face when he saw the broad back in front of him,  oblivious to the trickster of a spider creeping up on him. He was so getting him this time.   He crawled up the ceiling so the he could position himself directly behind him when he landed. He let his feet dangle as he held himself with just his hands. This was going to be awesome. He them reales his hands and landed with a soft thud.
“ Peter sweetie the boy was flirting with you. He has no intent on doing schoolwork with you if you give him your number.”
Hi. It’s been a while since I’ve updated. Please leave  Your comments, I love hearing from you. Also please read my other fic The (Not So Little) Mermaid.
Natasha rolled her eyes and Was going back for the speaker when Clint bested her to it, “ Were you two sexually involved?”
“ He said you looked right at him when you did some talk and he knew you were the one. When he was talking, it sounded like he had been following you for a while. He mentioned that he saw you in Paris, I’m guessing for your conference. And then that first time we fought him you prevented him from being crushed by that bridge.”
Steve gave a low growl and pulled Tony to his chest. Tony nearly dropped his pastry as he was suddenly jostled.
“ You Better take him down there before Schmidt finds out you’ve been slacking. Skeletor is already in a pissed off mood.”
“ If you two don’t want to do it, it’s fine. But I am doing it.” Tony turned heel and began to walk away with two disgruntled super soldiers following him.
Tony had heard to the employee garage afterward and broke into a car and had set Friday up to the navigation system.
“ Bambino! You’re so thin! Why haven’t you been eating? I’ve seen skeletons with more meat than you.” Maria cooed as she looked Tony over.
Peter turned and expected to see Ned. Instead he saw Harry jogging toward him, a big smile on his face.
Steve didn’t respond as he stared at him as he reached under the band of his boxer briefs. Steve threw his head back with a soft moan at the contact. Tony takes his fingers softly along the pubic hairs until he got to the area of his final destination. Steve gently paced a hand over his.
Tony glared over his shoulder.. His face was so close. Tony could feel his soft breath tickle his cheek.
Tony was completely out of his suit, only in his black compression uniform remained on. Any other time Steve would ogle at how it hugged his curves, but now was not a good time.
“ ommf!” Rhodey grunted. Tony looked down and saw Bucky trying to wedge himself between Himself and Rhodey. And the other side he saw Steve and the baby come up on his other side before curling himself at Tony side.
Tony narrowed his eyes at him. What he wouldn’t give to punch him. He turned to blonde to say his thanks. “ Thank you, your grace.” He grounded out.
“How did you make the mirror?” Pepper asked, and this time I felt hesitant to speak the truth. How could I tell her about Rhodey, an Alpha who was four years my elder, working class and wishing to run away with me?
Things were quiet until Mother came back. I spent my time in bed, thinking about Rhodey and the events that had transpired thus far. I was the one who initiated the kiss, who made the strange moan-noise, who had gotten Rhodey into trouble. I would be punished by God for ruining my purity.
I looked down at the twentieth draft and nodded. Maybe twenty would be my lucky number? Pepper grinned at threw some clothes at me. Cords, I noted, Alpha clothing. I blushed despite myself. There was nothing wrong with not wearing a dress or skirt for once in my life. Cords would be a change. Why worry about being Un-Omega regarding clothing when clearly, I had already committed much worse sins.
“ We were able to retrieve a blood sample and do a quick scan. It’s a He. Anyway, his singing is deadly. He already killed three fishermen who were trying to catch from that alone. He can either sing a certain tune that can cause them to die or lure them in and manually kill them. “
Tony opened it and began munching on the fruit. Jesus, who did he steal this from? He really needed to reel in his klepto tendencies. He bet there was an agent out there pissed off right now since there food has gone missing.
Steve continued on with his list of updates and began the presentation with Schmidt about global updates and possible leads for current cases. It reminded him a bout of home and that in his own universe, his teammates were probably doing to same thing. Before the meeting ended he excused himself to go to his room. Steve offered to walk him there but he declined. No matter what universe, he was pretty sure where his room would be.
They were brought into the indoor gym area, which was cleared of the usual gear and clutter. Instead a circle of empty metal chairs covered the mats, and it seemed a small table was set aside for refreshments. Olive groaned as she rubbed her face in frustration, “Steve, is this where we’re meeting?”
Sabretooth attempted to raise his fist in solidarity, only to have it shoved back down by a mildly annoyed Wolverine, “Keep your fucking hand down.”
“Miss. Olive! Please come with us! He’s hurt!” Barton’s child urged Olive to follow him, “We didn’t know it was still on, and it just started shooting! He was trying to protect Morgan, and then they both fell in!”
“Good to see you too, Thor.” Olive replied with a forced smile as she slowly made her way past the duo, “If you’ll excuse me.”
“My name is Charles Xavier, and I’m here to support Erik Leshnerr.” Charles lifted an elegant hand to cup his counterparts’ face playfully, “Some of you may also know him as Magneto. While often misguided, Erik’s dream is for mutant-kind to live without fear.”
“It’s not a mixer, Steve… It’s a support group, Olive. For, what the government considers, past offenders of attempted world domination or destruction…
“Agent Colson called it Operation: Support System, Sam calls it Reformed Supervillain therapy, and Bruce calls it group psychotherapy.” Steve seemed uncomfortable
“Ugh” he replied as Olive got up to collect his toiletries, “Thanos. What a terrible name. Everyone at school calls me Thanos The Anus.”
“Shut up, dude!” Spiderman spun to Bruce desperately rambling, “I am so sorry, Mr. Banner. He does not mean that, um, I think maybe it’s just… nerves? He’s
if he never has basic human experiences. I mean, this whole situation with his class is out of control, and I have no support.”
“Please talk to him, Sage.” Olive quickly gathered her brother’s hands with her own, “Please. I think it’s been a disappointing few years from him, and he’s dead-set on returning to space. I’m just scared… I’m scared we’re funneling him right back on that same path, and no one wants to listen to me.”
Olive opened her eyes and everyone, except her, had both hands raised. This was not surprising to her; these are narcissistic people with deeply set hero complexes. It was always Olive’s opinion that all “heroes” probably needed some therapy. Or, at least, an intervention regarding minding their own business.
They looked nothing alike, barely tolerated each-other most of the time, and every day it seemed to get harder and harder. All Olive wanted to do was get this kid out the door and to school. She knew it sucked, because school inherently sucks; kids are mean.
“We’ve been through this.” Sighed Olive kneeling down to button his jacket, “I’m sorry. You can’t go to that school. We tried, and… It just didn’t work out.”
The question wasn’t fair, the set up wasn’t fair, and none of this seemed productive; for Olive’s situation, at least. Olive only raised her hand as an attempt to make this exercise go as quickly as possible. Thanos was not
therapeutic to a child. This is the type of set up you give people who are shooting up heroin on the daily, and
“Thanks for coming by.” Bruce gestured for Olive to take a seat with the other men, “I know you had some apprehensions about being, uh, checked by me… I totally agree that, uh, maybe a psychologist should be brought on-board, but I think S.H.I.E.L.D. wants to keep this project
move it? Olive bit back a bitter laugh as she flung her seat-belt off. She hadn’t been able to do any such thing for a few years now, and it was thanks to their reintroduction to Earth. After Thanos’ case, she was forced to use the Mutant Cure as a condition of being able to care for him. It was the most unpleasant part of her week, and with each injection her empathy for humanity fades away.
“Come on, Peter. Let’s go get dinner ready for the boys.” Peter jumped up in agreement and the two giddily exited the room. It must be so comforting to have a life so easily conformed to two definitions; she scoffed at them as they exited.
“When…um… wh-…” Olive watched sympathetically as Steve hung his head to hide his tears, “He was compared to the others… Bucky is a hero, and he was taken… Hydra made him like… this…”
“They should be here any minute.” Steve’s eyes lit up as he excitedly waved Sergeant Barnes over. Olive was envious of their relationship; there were clearly still best friends. She and Dr. Banner shared an expression pinched with annoyance as they watched the two unite.
“Ah, Lady Olive. How good to see you again!” Exclaimed Thor as he flung his brother forward, “We are glad to see you and your
Deadpool seemed to struggle against Spiderman’s grip as the latter held him in place by the forearm. “My name is Spiderman” cracked his voice spectacularly, “and I am here to support my friend, Way-… Deadpool. He’s a really cool guy, and I think he deserves a chance.”
“He’s having a hard time coping with the concepts of rejection and isolation.” Sighed Olive in annoyance. He was trying to blend in with children who he looks nothing like, and they are very aware of his past indiscretions thanks to a grown woman
“Get off!” growled Spiderman as he hopped out of his chair to avoid his friends’ advances, “Sorry, Mr. Banner. W-we can go next!”
After a few well-placed prods to his ribs, Deadpool finally followed his friends lead, “My name is Deadpool, and the only reason I’m here is because Spidey’s
Charles Xavier pushed his wheelchair forward to assert his turn and smiled pleasantly to the other members. That was the same polite smile Olive remembered when he reiterated that Thanos would not be appropriate for his school, and that it was his
Olive couldn’t bring herself to make eye contact with the brothers as she stiffly tiptoed past them. She desperately pressed the elevator’s buttons, and hoped the awkward conversation would not continue; it was no secret that she had no love for New Asgard or their kings. Part of Thor’s diplomatic approach to having his people assimilate with Earth was to provide S.H.I.E.L.D. with a space to conduct any “re-education” of wayward heroes. Unfortunately, it was during this time that she had returned to Earth and was transported New Asgard’s newly installed S.H.I.E.L.D. “embassy”. During the next few months she was restrained both chemically and physically, forced to watch hundreds of hours’ worth of “good Samaritan” training, and questioned using what would now be called “problematic” tactics.
Nodding passively, Olive took the seat next to Steve Rogers and quickly smiled at him. Realizing that the man at her side was doing everything in his power not to look at her, Olive quickly glanced away. His ignoring her likely had to do with his red, puffy eyes and tear-stained cheeks. Clearly the agents weren’t feeling very comfortable with his first session either.
displayed; regardless of the intention or circumstance.” Bruce gave them a brief pause before continuing, “The definition of a
“How about” began Olive as she broke the embrace, “we play hooky today, and Monday? We can have a four-day weekend, go out to the cabin, and see if we can maybe visit your uncle?”
Both men settled back into their seats with identical expressions of exasperation, and each with their arms stubbornly across their chests. Clearly communication was not open or welcome; they had both totally shut down and seemed unwilling to speak.
“Mr. Stark was there when she invited me! So, I guess he knows. He didn’t say anything. Oh! So was Spiderman! He said hi to me an everything!”
His beady little eyes welled with tears as he silently shook. Biting his lips in frustration he bitterly mumbled, “I’m not like any of the kids at my school. It’s not fair.”
Olive remembered the moment she went from a hero of mankind to their enemy. When she refused the execution of a four-year-old child to take place, and advocated for an actual investigation; rather than a witch trial.  Everyone had assumed she was a pawn of Thanos upon her return and she was locked away by S.H.I.E.L.D. for re-education. After all, they had thought their precious martyr had been hypnotized, and everyone wanted to see her “cured”.
Olive turned to face a visibly panicked Steve Rogers; his face flushed and a sheen of sweat building on his forehead. Captain America was embarrassed about his ability to decorate a makeshift group therapy room. No,
Giving her brother a hurried goodbye Olive left to see Bruce for some, as Agent West described, “much needed
“And creates maybe, like, ten more.” Moaned Olive, burying her face into her hands, “Oh god, why Stark and Barton’s kids?”
different. However, she was not at all surprised, she too had unpleasant interactions with mutant-kind.
Olive hastily made her way down the hall, and hoped she could avoid any more run-ins as she fought against the frustrated tears threatening to fall. She didn’t feel necessarily attacked or, even, offended by her conversation with Bruce. Olive was used to S.H.I.E.L.D.’s nonsense, and she noticed the various binders and cue cards lying around the office. After Banner’s return to Earth he, like the Winter Soldier, had to go into hiding after Thanos’ disappearance. So, it seemed that Bruce was still doing “odd-jobs” to continue living in peace with society; it would be no fun to return to agent Romanov if he had to stay in hiding, she supposed. Olive was just tired of the same song and dance.
“Huh.” Agent West clicked his tongue at the curt explanation, “Alright, okay, I can see where you are coming from. Counse
straight to the training center.” So much for a relaxing long weekend at the cabin. All Olive wanted as for Thanos to have a few non-traumatic experiences in his lifetime. That was one of the main points that were made in the court cases; that if rehabilitated, then he could integrate into society.
“I could have been an Anthony, or even a Sebastian. I would have accepted Steven or Stephen, both spellings would have been fine. I think Star Lord would have been the best name for me.”  He looked up longingly at the pictures of his hero littered across his walls, “One day I’ll go back to space, and we’ll go on adventures.”
their loved ones.” Bruce didn’t sound completely convinced by this plan, but he was in the same boat as Olive. Either they comply or they die protecting their counterparts.
Olive noted that he sounded more sensitive than usual today. She could imagine his cheeks flushing with anger, or that little vein that always popped up on his forehead. Ever since Agent Coulson went strictly on “Avengers duty” she has been stuck with Paranoia Agent. He constantly thinks they have some sort of doomsday device; like even at the grocery store. He didn’t tolerate any “misbehavior” from the kid. Especially if she let Thanos stay home instead of going to school. Agent West was a firm believer that if Thanos is unable to assimilate to society, then he would eventually become dangerous. “I’m just taking Thanos to see his uncle. Things have been hard at school, and I think he would do well with receiving some counsel from him.”
“Me.” Olive quickly spun around and found herself face-to-face with Bruce Banner, “They thought I was a good fit. Since the Other Guy’s didn’t exactly start off as a hero, and I guess now we are.” Bruce’s sarcastic finger quotes over the word “hero” was not lost on Olive; she knew what it was like to go from being publically loved, to being hated, to being loved again. It could drive anyone to suicidal ideation at best.
“Thank you for your input, Mr. Banner.” Replied Olive with a tight smile as she stood to leave, “This has been very helpful.”
someone actively going through childhood trauma. Olive could see Thanos needing therapy; it’s not like she’s in denial about the situation anymore. She just always assumed it would be with a
Olive had to admit that calling it a “past life” was pushing it. If one is essentially Benjamin Buttoned back to infancy in a two-minute accident does it count as a past life? If they’re memory was telepathically wiped does that make them a new person? Those were the main argument presented during the court cases that followed their return to Earth.
“Let’s go ahead, and take a seat. I think we’re all here.” Bruce ushered the last guests to their seats and took his place at the top of the circle, “Now, I know that this a very exciting to some and a little anxiety inducing to others. So, maybe, let’s start with some introductions… Um… I guess I’ll begin.”
“Oh, yeah. Does it look okay?” Steve rubbed his bicep self-consciously, “They asked me to set up the room for some reason. I thought… I thought that maybe I could make it look like the meetings I, um, go to… with Sam.”

“Everything alright?” asked Thanos from the backseat; not even bothering to look up from his doodling.
Being an Omega left a certain… feeling of dismay between my father and me. Especially since it became apparent my mother would not be able to carry any more children. I was prayed, begged, wished for by my mother and father. The maids have told me that my father would spend hours on his knees praying to the Goddess of Fertility to bless my Omega mother who until my miracle conception had been failing her one apparent purpose in life. Oh, the irony that comes with making a wish. The Gods will always punish you for committing such a sin as asking.
I thought about my own tussled, short hair and felt a little discouraged. I could grow it out if I wanted to, but I knew that I would not look after the hair and it would instead turn into a frizzy, knotted catastrophe. Pepper’s hair was down and almost flat. The locks were pretty and I hoped that she might even entrust me to brush it once we got to our destination.
“I doubt Tony has ever had wine, Thor.” Pepper laughed. I felt a blush creep up my neck. It was true; I had not. I felt uncultured despite the fact I knew there would be no true judgement from these individuals.
Thor let out a scream as Hela threw Loki off the edge, letting her youngest sibling fall into the rocks and waves below. “Why?! You’ll die for this!” He roared, struggling against his restraints.
Half an hour later, Thor was playing something merry and quick as Pepper spun me around the room. Natasha clapped and drank some sort of ale and moved her feet side to side. Dr. Banner sat in an arm chair, reading something he had bought with him. I wondered if he owned Totleigh Manor?
I fell in love with the idea of making my own wooden prince and princess and castle and horses. Dara, the maid who was with me, was young and seemed to hold the ideals most young people do, until it is beaten or married out of you. Had bought it for me and paid two teenage Alphas to carry it to the house. My mother was out, and my father was probably drunk in bed, so nobody was able to spot us and tell us what was wrong. I was eight at the time, and not particularly attractive at that age. I had grown, and my body had not caught up. I was nothing more than a strange distortion of youth and lankiness that was merely an embarrassment at that age.
I would be punished severely and father will ensure that I am given to the most destructive of Alphas, an Alpha who would crush my spirit and amputate my hands if given any reason.
And since that whole incident, eating had become particularly hard. And it was all the sun’s fault, really. The sun and it’s red sky.
He seemed stunned, and took a second before wrapping his arms around my waist. My waist, the cause of it all. My eyes closed and so did his, an eclecticism of textures and feelings and thoughts passing both of us.
Pepper put her hand on my shoulder. “If they don’t know anything else, then it’s pretty real for them.”
Dr. Banner was young in the face, but his eyes looked tired and worn out. It suggested that he read and wrote a lot, but also may have seen many things. He had a naturally nervous deposition and I wondered if, perhaps, he had a dark past, just waiting to be uncovered.
“No, not at all! I don’t want you getting into trouble, Master Stark. You gotta hide it so that he doesn’t see.” What? I was taken aback by this explanation. He had sneaked in my room to… make sure I wasn’t in trouble? This certainly was odd behaviour. “I can move it somewhere else for ya. Where he won’t go. Like… in a cupboard or a sewing room or-“
I have it tucked into my corset. The page is wrinkled and the spelling is wrong in places, and the ink has ran. But is still my first diary entry. Even if I use a cat, rather than myself. It’s hard to write about yourself when you don’t understand who exactly you are.
He always said stuff like that. It made my chest heavy, because saying stuff like that was illegal but could it really be illegal when he was an Alpha and Alphas decided what was illegal? I stroked the hem of my sleeve absently. The conversation was dead; he knew I would not respond to that and he could not say anymore, despite the list of things that he wished he would say.
“I guess so…” I tapered off, looking around. “It’s really warm in here.” I commented, earning a slight chuckle from Pepper.
“I know you are, I know. But… Things will be hard for you, Thor Odinson. For a long time. But I know you’ll find your place.”
Pepper called us in after around an hour of talking. She chided us lightly for the state of our clothes, though we knew she didn’t really mind. She herself looked tired – she had been to the city for a few days and had not quite settled back into life at the manor.
I can imagine it in my head, exactly how it would have happened. The satisfied smirk shown through the corners of an upturned lip, eyes narrowed as if calculating the amount of newly added prestige, nostrils flared from the stench of my mother’s gushing body, still in the midst of delivering the afterbirth, the fists clenched as if to punch the sky or punch the doctor. Hair a mess from the heat of the room, masses of the humid warmth swelling from my mother’s stretched belly.
“Then yes. Mother says it’s bad to rub education in the face of the less privileged.” Rhodey let out a scoff and I sudden felt a little bit foolish.
“You can say that again. Very creative, though.” Natasha added as she walked towards me. “He’s a fast learner.”
“I wish I could take you to the city Tony. There’s flowers stalls all over, run by young Omegas like yourself. And soldiers are nice, at times, and play football with children on the streets and there are open concerts where everyone dances and sings and…” She trailed off, sighing wistfully.
“They were wet and cold and tight. I struggled to breath in them. Really, today is the first day in ages I feel like…”
Arriving at Totleigh bought with it the same feeling of freedom that came with my first visit; except I knew that inside I would find the stories of Omegas like me.
When I was younger, my fifth birthday to be precise, I was made to undergo the first stages of becoming what, at the time, was expected of me. The cloth had been soaked in lavender infused stream water, sourced from the mouth of the river Fern, six miles north of my settlement. The material, a light blue I think, had been treated and stretched and wrapped and stretched again by my mother’s staff, so that they would give me the perfect waist in years to come. It was an honour, my mother had told me as I sobbed openly at the feeling of my body being squeezed and packaged into the itchy, damp confines of the cloth. An honour.
I enjoyed my evening at Totleigh Manor. Pepper had bought with her several newspapers, a range of dates. Natasha read them with great interest. I had not given it much thought at the time, but quickly learned that Natasha did not leave Totleigh.
“Because, Thor, they walk around like they own the palace. And they don’t if anything, this palace should be mine.” Thor looked around, eyes wide.
Odin tried, of course he tried. Princes, Kings, Lords, Dukes; all had been invited to the castle. All had left soon after meeting the then 6 foot Omega.
Dr. Banner didn’t look up from his work. “Good morning, Tony.” He said calmly. I placed the design on top of his work. He froze. “What?”
My legs, too, had turned to led and I felt as if though I might fall off my chair. My father would be so angry… And I would have to admit to everything!
I realise Mother is speaking to me, using the same dull tone that came to the forefront of her vocal chords mere seconds ago. “… And they shall keep you until… until Virginia has found a suitable partner.”
The carriage begins to move away and I watch as the waving image of Dara becomes hidden behind the ever thickening shrubbery that secluded my home from the village.
“I’m glad you have a friend Tony. That Alpha boy you speak of. It’s good to meet a range of people.”
“Of course he will. But, first, you must learn how to.” She looked out the carriage window, pushing the thick purple curtain out of the way. A hum quivered out of her throat – she was thinking, formulating, doing what she does and will always do best…
Dr. Banner did not attempt to remove me. Rather, he just simply stayed still, afraid to jostle me. Pepper was the one who had hoisted me off his lap.
I hugged him tightly. The fourteen-year-old smiled and ruffled my hair. He had a sack slung over his shoulder, and I gazed at him in anticipation.
He smirks and walks to the door. “Good choice. Clean yourself up, you look disgusting.” He walks out of the room.
The ceremony itself was not the reason I longed to go the event; it was the party that took place afterwards.
“Why yes… But don’t worry about that. It is the sign of well-taking to the binds.” My mother waved her hand in the air flittingly, eyes rolling in a whimsical manner with a bright smile. I watched her perform for Virginia, letting out a quiet sigh in relief as my lungs took in air that I did not I had been declining them. She petted my shoulders comfortingly.
There was a pang in my chest. Pepper didn’t live five minutes away like Rhodey did. She was a city Beta, somebody who was used to busy schedules and busy streets and a busy mind. My mother would not dare allow such influences into my life; it was the very reason she had to make Auntie Peg’s visits fleetingly short and always within her or Dara’s earshot.
“Make sure she doesn’t get on that throne, of course. Does mean you’re swearing allegiance to me, Valkyrie?”
It made sense, of course, that she would not be able to leave. But all I could think about was the terrible claustrophobia. Had she not any family? Had she not something other than a place of illegal education that existed in what seemed to be its own frame of reality? And when Pepper was busy, who else resided here in the manor, keeping her company?
He had bought me a fairy-tale book for small children, and said he wanted to teach me how to read. For some reason, I had been afraid of admitting that I could read and write to Rhodey despite him being very eager to teach me woodwork. I had not made the connection between the two Un-Omega activities, though I see now that, in most cases, it is good to hold reservations in regard to certain things.
It may have been a fantasy world, but it was a world that certainly kept Dr. Banner rich; thus keeping Totleigh Manor open.
“It’s a promise ring.” Rhodey whispered to me gently, taking it out the box. It shone in the light, as Rhodey inspected it. It looked smooth and delicate. A promise ring. I did not understand what a promise ring was at that age. Rhodey went on one knee and I felt my face flush deeper. He took a hold of my hand.
Hela was near-lethal with her moves, often landing a kick that came in hand with a sickening sound of a crunch. Loki was often too fast, but sometimes she would get the corner of his mouth, top of his knee, the tip of his big toe.
“Of course, if that is what you want to do… Tony, it is important that I understand you as a person. Yes, you will be a wife and a mother but before all that you are still Tony. As far as my aunt was concerned, you are wild and imaginative but would be good for a strict Alpha who wishes to have a challenge.”
“Dara… if you can, please hide my woodwork, my drawings and just anything that Obadiah might use to take me away from Pepper. Please, he’ll hunt the house down when he gets the opportunity. He’s a snake, Dara, a snake that’ll twist any smidgen of evidence into a prop to make me his.” I know that I was pleading, but I knew that Obadiah would go to extremes.
“I’m not anyway near less privileged than others who live in the village, Tony Stark.” He commented lightly, shaking his head at me. “I’m a good cadet, I have a good job and one day I’ll join the army.”
There was this bizarre belief that too much food made an Omega rebellious, as if the extra dollop of butter or the too-thick cut of bread suddenly burst open a flood-gate’s worth of unsuitable thoughts and feelings. Why would an Omega be thinking about the skies? Too well-fed. Of course. Natural curiosity is unbecoming of creatures like Omegas.
“There’s danger in a look, let alone a kiss.” Mother whispered, eyes cast down and face forlorn with guilt.
“Ugh, Master Stark?” I made eye contact with him. He looked friendly, with brown pools that wanted me to swim in them. “I work f-“
Secluded away in the thick foliage, it was a place that people barely ventured to unless they had a particular reason to; supplies were collected from a village a fifteen mile carriage ride away; annual inspections were made short by the never-ending façade that the residents put on; people who lived there rarely left.
Within six months, Thor had begun to develop muscle; he could easily climb trees, disarm Brunnhilde and break the masses of wooden dummies that were used for combat training.
“Tony, did you ever allow that young Alpha boy to defile you?” She asks me, bracing herself is if my words will strike her down.
“… And Loki had but a pinecone under the pillow!” Thor exclaimed, laughing loudly before taking a large bite out of his potatoes, the food virtually just a holder for half a stick of butter. “Oh, father was mortified but it was funny!”
“Whirlpool.” Tony said while it wasn’t as loud as when he called the first attack it was still clear as Happy flicked his flippers and sent a large whirlpool at Voleur sweeping him and trapping him in the water. Steve called him back and sent out Justice instead. The bird looked as powerful and free as he had in all the reels and posters, It was the weirdest nostalgia hit to see this very bird that had filled his daydreams as a child. Happy didn’t seem similarly inclined to feel nostalgic, he simply squared himself up and watched the eagle above him.
“Superpower!” Just like with Happy, Justice came at Noch, his heavy beak and mighty talons making quick work of what fight was left in Noch.
“Giga Impact!” Despite his size, Voleur was strong enough and the beam that shot out from his little key crest on his head hit Happy hard enough to knock him back several feet. As the light faded it was obvious that the Klefki was out like a light, Happy regained his composure and rolled his shoulders.
“There was a lot of damage done to the balls.” Tony starts with a business like tone. “And I almost managed to get everyone back.” Pepper opens the box to reveal five luxury balls. And one cracked Pokeball. Steve stared at the box, Sister just kept her face against his chest, she already knew and didn’t want to think about it.
“She’ll be fine.” Natasha says curtly as Feya holds onto her shoulder while nosing at Noch. “She might not be a fan of Justice for a while.” Natasha says less fiercely as Tony and Bruce approach, Steve sighs and looks over at Justice, who simply could care less.
“I’m going to have to talk to him, I think the fact your Umbreon has a really accurate Toxic upset him. He normally doesn’t hit that hard in battles.”
“I’ve called him, Feya.” She says as she sits down on the couch next to Tony, Jammira turns in Tony’s lap to get a look at him, he blows a bubble at her from his nose and as if compelled by an outside source, the Vulpix lifts a paw and pops the bubble, they both seem to find this very amusing.
“He’s a shiny Pokemon, it means he’s very rare. Just like little boys who understand car engines before they even start school. If I remember right. When he evolves into a Braviary, he’ll be blue instead of red.”
“Genetically matching the guy who helped him buff up doesn’t mean I know anything.” His response causes Natasha to give him a sly smirk.
“I forfeit!” Steve announces with a hand up in the air. “Voleur has nothing to wake him up.” Tony wasn’t going to begrudge him that, had Steve’s Shieldon been the same level as Butterfingers, then he would have been at a disadvantage, he only had brute strength left while Butterfingers was strong his attacks weren’t accurate so he was Tony’s wildcard.
Tony watched as Steve and his Audino, Sister, rebonded clinging tight to each other, he focuses on Coulson as the tears of joy and relief start to form at the corner of Steve’s eye, Tony opting to give him at least that much privacy. Coulson nods to both him and Pepper.
“Double team.” Natasha says quietly, and in seconds there are now a total of twelve Frostlass on the field all drifting around Sister, who looks like she finds the whole scene unnerving.
“Snezhinka, Avoid the snow!” Natasha calls back, a little unsure of what Steve was planning as the next move. However as fast as the Frostlass was, the Audino’s persistence seemed key and she managed to trap the Ghost and Ice Pokemon in the snow.
“Pepper!” He calls out, she looks up from a television screen that was reporting on the latest bit of Stark Technology to hit the market and huffs a noise at him to let him know he has her attention. “I’ve been looking at this wrong. I’m trying to open Pokeballs.” He points emphatically at her.
When the pair regain themselves Tony and Pepper approaches Steve, Pepper, holding a small dark would gloss box.
“You mean other than being smarter than everyone else?” He grins at his mother, who just shakes her head at him.
“It’s more fun this way.” She replies as Noch, her Umbreon appears out of the ball, looking every bit as graceful and dangerous as her owner. “Mean look.” Nock lifts her chin then looks down her black nose at the Klefki and slowly grins, the Pokemon shudders then looked helplessly at his own trainer. Tony smirked, he knew that Noch was the Pokemon was Natasha’s best Pokemon, the rest of her team helped her do her job, but Noch was with her from the start and was quick to strike. Steve frowns at the Mean Look’s blocking Voluer’s chances of being returned, the tiny Pokemon didn’t have much left in him and Natasha knew that, better to officially remove a competitor than have them come back at the wrong time. It was a good strategy.
“Happy, Yawn.” Tony announced who obeyed easily enough, the large bird put his flipper to his mouth and gave a large yawn that Voleur couldn’t help but yawn back. Steve frowned, Tony was known as an offensive player both in matches and as Iron Man, so an attack that would cause sleep quickly wasn’t expected, so Steve had to pull out the big guns early.
“Ready and willing.” Steve answers Bruce’s question, Tony rolled his eyes but was grinning with a casual ease.
“Other than keep his name a secret.” Tony gives Clint a scowl that both of them know is more flash than anything else.
“Match start!” Bruce declares and again both Natasha and Steve throw their first balls at the same time.
“But brown means he’s special.” His mother says, running well-manicured fingers through her worrying boy's hair. “He’s just like you.”
“Teleport!” Natasha calls sharply as the Klefki makes his attack, Tsvetok safely teleports herself to another part of the field, looking as relieved as her trainer. This was the most comfortable Steve had looked since moving in, it made Tony certain that Steve had only been testing the water with him.
Tony and Clint nod and leave the room, Pepper is outside waiting for them she reaches for You, but he dodges her and jumps up  on Tony’s shoulder and starts having an animated conversation with Clicker on Clint’s shoulder, the Lucario sighs and just walks in step with her trainer as they walk down the hall.
“Steel wing.” Tony commanded and immediately Steve called out for Justice to use protect which he used fast enough to block Happy’s attack.
“Not by himself, but if I can’t retrieve data from what he can do it means I have to upgrade something.”
“Audii? Audii!” Cried an Audino as she ran from where she had stood in the living room towards the super soldier, she wore a world war II nurse hat upon his head, he couldn’t help but look like he was staring at a ghost as she jumps into his arms and he catches her without any thought as she buries her face into his chest making his chest damp from her happy tears.
The history of the last seventy odd years, while objectively equally as fascinating with how fast technology exploded onto the scene and became so advanced in the blink of an eye. Emotionally it was very soul crushing.
“Rogers’ Klefki is unable to battle.” Bruce announces “This is getting really exciting, don’t you think?” He asks as an aside to Tony as Steve recalls the Klefki, then seemed to contemplate bringing Sister back out or the third Pokemon he had chosen.
“More than that, they’re fighting fit and looking forward to seeing you again. Their balls weren’t salvageable, and I thought with all they’ve been through putting them in luxury balls was the least I can do.”
“You wold say that.” Tony rolls his eyes. “How’s your egg coming along?” Coulson ignores the question.
Tony knows it’s a good move, while both Pokemon share the fairy type, Klefki is also a steel which can deal out strong attacks to fairy types. Natasha knows she has to react fast and calls out her attack, Steve also doing so at the same time.
“You guys were in one hell of a rendition of The Grey, and in order to get you back, I had to mess with your balls, and get you in new ones. Let’s get you to the buildings Pokecenter get you all fighting fit and refreshed? Got to look good for Rogers when he turns up, right?”
“I could use the change of scenery.” Is all Tony said before standing up and gesturing to You and Jammria to follow as humans and Pokemon started to head to the elevator.
“Where is she?” He asked calmly, after all, if everything was fine and normal then she should be here fussing over him.
Several of those from the 107th who fought at Steve’s side, The Howling Commandos, had passed away long ago and the few that remained were old men, either in care homes or living out their days with their families. That had been at least something to lighten Steve’s heart, everyone had had families, raised children, dogs, cats, all finding jobs in some form or another after the war not being lost to the front even when at home having no one to relate to.
“You know, you’re too into this.” Tony says quietly to Bruce who simply shushes at him eager to see who are the first picks for this battle. Tony rests an elbow on the table to cradle his face with a deliberately lazy interest. As Sister, Steve’s Audino and Natasha’s Frostlass, Snezhinka who gives Sister an aloof look.
“You’re lying.” He stands slowly, which causes her to take her own step back, the room must have been watched as the next second the doorway had armed men pour in, weapons trained on him. Steve ruled out the door as a point of exit, so he went through the wall, and ended up going much farther than he intended as the wall he went through was nothing more than painted plywood and struts. He just continued through the building, knocking down guards or taking sudden turns all the while heading down every chance he could get, he only stopped running when he got outside and saw everything around him, he knew that fountain it looked just like the one in Castelia Park before he became a part of project rebirth. But none of the buildings around it was remotely familiar, tall and nothing but steel and glass sterility.
“It was only for a few years a long time ago.” Tony said dismissively, despite being a solid challenge to trainers looking for badges, Tony hardly took the role seriously.
Since becoming a super solider information came to him easily and it took very little personal effort to not just take in the information but also store it able to recall it within seconds, in addition to his artistic soul he was also able to easily visualise and understand what went on around him with that information.
“Psyshock!” “Mirror Shot!” Tsvetok barely gets to build up her attack before the small key ring like Pokemon shines brightly forcing not only the other Pokemon but also her trainer to cover their eyes.
It was also fun to watch Maria’s jaw tighten every time he didn’t follow her orders, she couldn’t be more a part of the system if she tried, and Tony imagined that she had in fact tried.
“We are going to have a three on three single battle standard rules.” Bruce announces from the judging platform on the Pokemon level. While it was a good place for the Pokemon to relax and socialise away from their trainers the place was still easily big enough to contain a gym sized battle arena with bleachers for at least twenty people to watch. “The first person to have all three Pokemon unable to battle will end the match. Trainer Rogers, are you ready?”
“This is unexpected.” is all she says which prompts Tony to snatch the papers from Clint and read them for himself as Maria answers them.
When Tony had managed to release the Pokemon from Steve’s damaged Pokeballs, they were obviously still in their warring mindsets, making Tony glad that Dum-E, Happy and Pepper had been with him as these Pokemon's first instincts had been to strike out at the person releasing them who obviously wasn’t Steve. The Audino, was the one who got the others to stop once she had caught a proper look at Tony, she had ignored Pepper’s shouts for them all to stop once she locked eyes onto him, using protect on herself as she stared at him, tilting her head slightly.
When Tony was 4 and neck deep in engine parts and Captain Unova comics, but barely got his feet wet when it came to parental attentions. His dad gave him an egg.
“So try to keep the explosions and roughhousing to a minimum while he gets used to living here. Even I know better than to ask for more than that.”Coulson just gives them both a mild look, Tony feels a little like he didn’t in boarding school.
“Oh! A Rufflet…. How. Very Howard.” Maria said, if Tony hadn’t been so distracted he would have caught the tone she used which usually got used when she figured out someone’s plan.
“Everyone is in our Pokemon centre, we’re making sure everyone is getting first-rate care.” The woman hesitated, it was imperceivable to anyone, not a super soldier. His Pokemon were not in a Pokemon centre.
“Justice. Superpower.” It was Tony’s turn to be surprised, he had no idea that Steve would have taught the bird a fighting move, let alone one that would no doubt count Happy out of the match. The Empoleon tried his best to dodge but the Bravairy was masterful at using his talons and beak to beat on the other Pokemon until Happy fell to the ground unable to get up.
“Guessing bringing up his past is off-limits.” Bruce says after he hears the Elevator moving, Natasha nods and puts Noch in her ball before heading to the Pokemon revival station.
“Keep your focus, Sister. Disarming Voice!” Watching the Pokemon that surround her, Sister nods and inhales deeply crying out loudly as she turns, the shadow Frostlass disappear as Snezhinkahugs herself sadly at the sound. From the look of it even Feya in Natasha’s arms looks unhappy about the call.
“We’re going out.” Coulson said with a perfunctory nod and stood back from the doorway to indicate they were going now. Steve with a look of confusion stands but obeys the ungiven order and grabs his jacket from the coat hook and puts it on.
“You have, beyond flying colours I might add. Commander Fury wants you to meet a selection of new individuals. With hopes of you becoming their leader to deal with any troubles that a team with your skill sets could best overcome.” He hands steve a file as they walk, and steve looks through it.  An ex-soviet spy turned S.H.I.E.L.D agent, the agent who flipped her, a scientist with an interesting way of expressing his displeasure and an amazingly talented engineer with the last name Stark. The name obviously stuck with Steve, Howard was listed as having a son but Steve hadn’t gotten around to looking up the names of the children of those from his past just yet. The photo wasn’t any help it was just of a dark haired man with a goatee and large purple framed glasses.
“ Do you want get it over with already? I have a full schedule of staring at the wall after you leave.”
He saw his housing unit for his nano Suit. He smiled as he too it and placed it under his shirt and over his chest. He activated it and allowed it to encompass him. He was missing pieces of armor over the part where the stones had melted through.
Tony loaded his plate with food and began to eat. Tony let out a moan when he tasted the chicken. He did not expect that.
Tony looked around the penthouse. If he didn’t know better, he would say that it was his. It had the same lightning, same carpet, same paint on the walls... but is wasn’t his. It was the other Tony’s. He walked into the kitchen and ran his hand across the quartz countertop. It felt just like the one In his own tower. Everything looked immaculate, someone must have cleaned it when the real owner had passed away.
Tony wanted to roll his eyes. Maybe it was because nothing was supposed to go up that end. But he kept his opinions to himself.  No use in making the man angry.
Both super soldiers closed their mouths after that, not wanting to see if Tony would really do that. Steve aligned himself with Tony’s hole and thrusted in. As per Tony’s instructions in set a fast pace, causing him to rub roughly on Grants groin.
The minute Tony entered he was embraced by larger arms. He felt Steve nose his neck and his hard on rub up against him.
Steve began to cut Tony’s waffles for him. He didn’t comment on the fact he was an adult. “ Because you gained 10 pounds and are struggling to keep up with the workout regimen.”
Tony looked up and smiled at him. Peter smiled back. He never told him of all the bullying at school. He wasn’t exactly popular by any measure. Another thing he like about Wade. He didn’t seem to care about that.
Steve growled at the semi-insult aimed toward Tony. Tony saw the other vampire exaggeratedly roll his eyes.
Peter sighed as he saw the alpha run to his group of friends, who were laughing and pointing at him.
“ They definitely didn’t hold back. Steve threw me against a freaking wall. “ Natasha complained as she paced an ice pack on her shoulder.
Nat nodded. “ Yes, But he needs to be reminded that he doesn’t always know what best and that you will probably be happier if you had some familiar faces around.”
Tony tried very hard not to sigh as the current bane of his existence strolled in with Bucky in tow.
Bucky rolled his eyes. “ No, like regular exercise. He’s older and he’s at risk for health conditions. He also is not as flexible as younger humans. He can do some yoga with Nat to make sure he doesn’t pull or tear a muscle. And I recommend exercise. You should also watch his diet, limit like sugar and such. It can be fattening. They tend to get floppy and fat as they age. You don’t want to see anything jigging other than a a large set of tits especially  when you you are mounting him. Trust me it’s such a turn off.”
“ Did Steve Tell to you about your friends again? I know he wanted to spend some time with you after breakfast and took you away.”
She held his face in his hands and let out an exasperated sigh, “ Look at this giant little face! Does no one know how to cook you a proper meal here? Good thing I brought some food.” He roughly grabbed him by the arm and began to lead him out of the gym. For such a small woman she was incredibly strong and that scared Tony. He did not want to be on her bad side.
With that Tony shashayed out of the room, knowing that Steve was looking at his ass. Tony knew he now had him wrapped around his finger.
James gave his an assessing look. “ And exactly who are you again? Last time I checked you were not my parent and just an omega.”
He raped me the first time when I was with him for 7 months. He had just pushed me on the bed and when I began fighting him I hit him into he face. He told me to do that again if I wanted to see my family hanged. So I didn’t hit him.
“ Hardly, you are surrounded by an entourage of people who spout continuously about how great and powerful you are in their unrelenting  efforts to please you.”
Tony places his palms on Steve’s thighs and began to caress them gently. He needed him to try and want to do something else so that he could ease that monstrosity into him maybe some oral, get it nice and wet, before it goes into him. Or maybe a hand job or two. That way he will be tired out and maybe he won’t be as rough or Bette yet not put it in him at all.
Tony paled. He heard about them. Hell the Winter Solider kidnapped his parents when Howard Stark spoke against the Hydra regime. They were probably dead.
Peter wrapped his arms around Becks neck and pulled himself close to his ear. “ I can sweeten the deal for you.”
“ They promised to save Bucky. I noticed in this universe he fell off a train. I know this because I have researched everyone of you throughly. Even you. Please tell me, do you rather me  call you Natalie or Natasha?”
“ Shh... calm down. I’m pretty sure you are overthinking. You are not going to be hurt, especially in the way you are thinking.”
“ No, friend Bruce, I think Hawkeye May have a point. The Captain has always been fond of Tony.” Thor pitched in.
Then there was Steve. Oh the great Steve Rogers. He put his entire heart and soul to making Tony notice him. He tried to invite him on runs and work out sessions, which Tony huffed at. He did not need to exercise. He enticed him with home cooked meals, which Tony couldn’t refuse. They were a religious experience each time he ate them. He was very sweet and smiled at Tony happily every time he saw him. Things were going great.
One such advice that was semi-beneficial was how Tony could only have sex once a week due to his age. He said it was bad for his heart to get too excited especially with his already weakened heart and that the rough rutting if a werewolf can hurt his hips as age makes human bones fragile.
“Smack down.” Steve declared which had the Shieldon to jump up and slam You into the ground, causing his Iron Barbs to stick into both White Shield and the ground, Tony called for him to use Thunder and while it did hit White Sheild and hard he was able to shrug it off. Tony had You return to the ball, sending out Butterfingers, The Bisharp looked a little bemused at the situation but ready.
“Things have changed since you were asleep.” Steve turns and looks at the bald black clad man with the eyepatch, the only person near him in the now clearly evacuated park. Steve looks around again before focusing on the man.
“Slappy.” Steve said solemnly as Sister stroked his cheek and spoke reassurances humans couldn’t understand. “But the others are safe?”
“It is a good look on you, Steve.” Natasha adds Tony, knows this isn’t the first time they met. She had been brought in to assess how he would take on a female attacker. She was pleased to see while he was holding back, it was because he naturally seemed to hold back when sparing but it didn’t mean she left the assessment bruise free in the slightest. Steve continues to look bashful as he thanks her for the comment but managed to rein in his boy-next-door ways and looked between Natasha and Tony.
“Of course. It also means you’re smart enough to have your very own Pokemon before you’re old enough to go on your own journey.”
“There is a floor just for you all to play in, and you want to start a house party in the New Guy’s room?” Tony asks getting all the Pokemon's attention. You, Tony’s Togedemaru waved his tiny forepaws excitedly sparking at the cheeks at the idea of a party while he stood on Steve’s Shieldon's frill. Tony just picks up the sparking ball of steel wool and shakes his head. “Everyone, out of the pool. Come on.” With the exception of Steve’s Pokemon who had ever right to be there, all the others slowly filed out Even Pepper looked sad about it as she had been apparently making fast friends with Sister.
They all looked to the Audino, who after a moment nodded. While Tony had known that Justice wasn’t Steve’s first Pokemon, he obviously was part of the whole PR plan, he still found it pretty unexpected for the healer of the team to be the one everyone follows. Maybe it’s because she knew him best.
“Daddy thinks you’re ready for the responsibility of looking after your first Pokemon, honey.” His mother, Maria, said warmly to her son, watching him fondly as his fingers only just touch as his arms curl around the widest part of the egg so he doesn’t drop it as he carries it around.
“Need any more help?” Clicker holds out her little hands at the question chittering excitedly. And obviously good question, the three of them walk to the S.H.E.I.L.D staff car and peered in. Clicker jumped in wasting no time in picking up a backpack too large for her to easily carry but she was more determined than she was defeated and stumbled her way to the tower with the bag as Clint picks up both unopened pillows with a shrug of his own and Steve picks up a bag with clothes in it as Tony closes the trunk door.
Steve hadn’t been best in school, in part because he spent a solid third of his school life in a bed recovering from something. Even still history had held a certain fascination to him, the rise and falls of empires living conditions of people from a time when modern medicine wasn’t a thing and yet they still survived, created, and made thing better.
Tony shrugged as he watched Happy and Pascal pull out some flat pack boxes. While Tony had been fine with paying for Steve’s furniture as part of the moving in deal, after learning of IKEA, Steve had insisted on getting everything he wanted from there he had a feeling it would help him settle down quicker if he had more of a direct involvement with what was bought for him. Tony wasn’t going to argue.
Three days later Natasha returned to the tower. Tony was in the common area on a couch reading from his tablet, Jammira dozing his in lap as he strokes her head, they only look up when they hear a lyrical sounding bark. While Noch, her Umbreon, was by Natasha’s side more faithful to her than her own actual shadow, in her arm’s was the Pokemon she had obviously gone to pick up.
“Trainer Romanov, Are you ready?” Natasha flicks her hair away with on hand before letting it drop to one side, Feya still safe in her other arm.
“Give me a Zing Zap.” Tony said simply as You waggled his tail sparking viciously as he summoned a flood of electrical charge into the bird who let go of him instantly falling along with the electric steel type.
“Well, it was either get your own apartment and pull shift work by staying in the tower half the day like a firefighter. Or moving in and always being on call like most good doctors.” It was a big tower anyway so it’s not like Tony was worried about how much space there would be for everyone.
“Moonlight. Then Toxic.” With a roll of her shoulders, the Umbreon took on a faint pink glow as she healed half of her health, then she ran towards Voluer before spitting the toxic purple goo all over him, he immediately drooped to the ground shuttering, Steve clenches his teeth muttering to the Pokemon that he could do it. He called out an attack but the little keyring Pokemon only looked at him balefully, clearly doubting the strength it had to continue. “Noch, Shadow Ball.” The Pokemon summoned the dark sphere in front of its face then it shot towards the Klefki, knocking it to the ground where it didn’t move.
“It’s certainly something alright.” Tony replies as Steve throws out a ball, as Justice materialises. “It’s over.” He says to Bruce who looks at both Pokemon as they stare each other down.
If Tony was going to come at his flying type with an electric, he’d challenge the electric with rock.
“Another mirror shot.” He says as his Klefki once again shines brightly blinding the Gardevoir yet again. “Dazzling Gleam.” The keys hanging from Voleur rattled as the Pokemon starts to shine again, but instead of the intense white light that his Mirror Shot produced he was starting to reflect light like he was a prism, the bright rainbow moving around the arena as he did, just as the light got too bright he hurtled towards the Gardevoir knocking her to the ground.
Pascal’s psychic ability made short work of the awkward to handle flat packs as Happy and Butterfingers, Tony’s Bisharp both carried a box each also containing things from IKEA.
“Stop that. Negative results are still results.” He pats the muscular shoulder of the penguin who still looks sad about the results.
“They’re probably upstairs waiting to tell you not to upset our new septuagenarian. Or he has a job for me. Who knows.” The pair and their Pokemon get in the elevator and ride it up to the next level. “The real question is. What are you going to do with Captain?”
“Good to know you aren’t going easy on me.” As she looks at Tony smirking more, rolling his eyes Tony doesn’t say anything, he knows she’s figured out why she is proving less of a challenge to Steve than Tony was, that much is obvious, he knows it’s just to tease him.
“Because he never says her name around me, she just knows what he wants to be done and does it.” Tony replies, finding it a little too creepy.
“Noch’s already taken Dazzling Gleam.” Bruce nods, agreeing because obviously he was there and saw it. “Dark types are weak to Fairy and fighting.” Bruce blinks at the statement.
Tony almost looks disbelievingly at her, before picking up his Rufflet and heads to his computer with him, typing in shiny Braviary and the first image is a nature photograph of one such shiny Pokemon.
“Out. Where? The training fields? I thought I passed all the testing.” He asks as he follows behind the agent.
That was all Tony had needed, a small shot of confidence from his mother something that even at this young age Tony had come to rely on his mother to help him navigate his father.
“Sweetheart, most boys your age are excitedly watching Pokemon matches or chasing girls with Venepide to make them scream. They aren’t trying to build their own car engine.” She delicately takes the egg from him and hands it to her Gothitelle who examines it as she pulls her son up into her lap.
“In more ways than he’d like to admit. He has a problem with authority and thinks he’s always right. Best way to deal with him is always give him enough rope to hang himself with and he shouldn’t become too difficult.”
“That’s a Popplio.” Tony said as he looked at the excitable little water type clapped who at him for being correct.
“What’s today’s plans?” Steve asks, not wanting to acknowledge that he had clearly been so spaced out he never heard Coulson knock before coming in to get his attention.
She blinks but just stares at him. “Not making sense?” She shakes her head. “I’ve spent this whole time trying to open Pokeballs of different ages, thinking that it’s the ball I had to fix.” Pepper continues to stare causing Tony gives up on her. “Happy! Freeze three balls.” Then he turns back to the Lucario. “I need a Heal ball, a luxury ball, and a great ball… And coffee, what’s the time?” Pepper points to the time on the tv screen indicating that it’s past lunch. “And lunch?” he looks at her imploringly and she sighs as she gets up to follow his orders.
“There are worse names you could have given that Bravairy.” Coulson answers, obviously figuring out who they were talking about easily enough.
“I was four. He’s a great Pokemon but really. It’s in the history books that Dad and Steve worked together. It’s a good thing only a handful of people know his name.” Tony says as they walk out of the elevator and onto the common floor, where Phil Coulson and Lola were waiting for them by the window.
Bruce finishes reading then looks up at Happy, who is still using his ice beam on the Pokeball while slowly moving around the table to get an even freezing.
“Mr Stark implied that you weren’t one to play around.” Steve grins peaceably towards her, clearly missing who he intended target was. “But if we’re playing too rough…” His voice playfully trails off, Natasha brushes the hair out of her face before throwing her last ball into the arena.
“Thank you, Mr Stark.” He isn’t surprised that Steve knew who he was there were photos and files and news reports about him after all, he was a little curious as to why he didn’t look at him like Sister had like he was Howard. He dismisses the thought soon enough, after all, Sister probably has far more of Roger’s attention that Tony’s face does.
By the time Tony was ready to put his ideas into motion his coffee had been cold for a while and his sandwich was half eaten. He hears the chirrup of Captain as the Bravairy had come in from his flight and the combat-booted footstep of Clint but didn’t acknowledge either as he breaks open a part of the outer shell of a frozen Pokeball and hooks it up to the computer it’s very delicate work and all the Pokemon in the room are giving him the space he knows he needs, not even Dum-E tries to crowd him.
As he and Captain grew, Tony had shown he was quite adept at training Pokemon and had easily beaten every gym leader and the elite four before he had a chance to reach eleven. Though he didn’t bother hanging around long to be the country's champion, instead he studied instead, Pokemon battles might have been easy for him, but engineering was always what got his curiosity fired up. When he turned 15 he learnt all he could and earned a degree in both engineering and robotics which all got put on the backburner when the Gym Leader for Castelia city retired, his past history as the youngest challenger got him an invitation to be the next Castelia gym leader and for two years he was the leader of a steel based gym. Captain always present but not part of the challenge line up.
“Flash Cannon.” Steve calls and the Klefki spins around causing the keys it has to jingle before unleashing a strong beam of light at the Gardevoir. She cries out but holds her ground.
“Dum-E’s helpful?” Both men look at the Metagross who raises his forearms and flexed his little silver claws which he has used to prove time and again he’s useless as grabbing anything let alone something delicate and the room goes silent for a beat.
“Fire types attract attention. Water and Fairy is much more useful to me. Besides, I already have Noch, I can’t be too greedy with Eevee evolutions. And any fairy move that an Eevee can learn isn’t all that useful to me.”
“I hope nothing in that box is important.” Tony says to Steve as Dum-E hovers past him and into the building. Steve watches the Metagross stare hard at the box as he went through the automatic door.
As the pair continue to watch, Jammira, the Vulpix Tony adopted after Yinsen’s passing rubbed against his leg before reaching up to his knees, which has the desired effect  oof Tony absently picking the cuddly Pokemon up to snuggle into his chest before joining in the watching.
“Wasn’t Laurel, bringing things in too?” Tony asked, realising he hadn’t seen the Lopunny in Steve’s room.
“Well, everything I have left is important.” Steve starts as Pepper strides past with a military duffle then can be heard ordering Dum-E around inside. As strong and powerful as Dum-E was, he was a hopeless creature unless someone gave him a direct order. If simply asked he would just waft about doing things in his own time. Which Tony didn’t mind for the most part, but it was funny to see how it would grate Pepper’s nerves. “I’m sure there’s nothing in there he can break at least. Thanks. For letting me stay.”
“Shadow ball.” The Gardevoir holds out her hand to summon the shadow ball throwing it at the Klefki the steel type Pokemon doesn’t move, as the ball streams past him. The other Pokemon shakes her head and blinks hard, realising she was more affected by that mirror shot than she thought.
“Captain.” A voice came to him, bringing him out of his revelry as he sat in a chair in his small S.H.I.E.L.D supplied room as he gazed out a window, the files of his comrades splayed out on the table in front of him. He runs a hand through his hair and sees Agent Coulson standing in his doorway. A forgettable looking man with a consistently pleasant look on his face, Phil Coulson had been instrumental in helping Steve adjust to living in this new time. It had been obvious of the bat that Coulson had a strong respect and love for Captain Unova and the stories told about him, the star struck look was something Steve had seen before, but usually on twelve-year-old boys on the few times he was back in the states and before when he was nothing more than a performer stage punching a guy from Queens dressed as Hitler, it had been a strange look on a forty-year-old man, but they both got used to each other where it wasn’t so uncomfortable to be around the other man.
White Star honked happily when he saw You, who happily half rolled and half ran over to the other Pokemon to cheerfully pat his face.
“Star and Pascal aren’t fighters. At least, not at Captain Rogers’ level. They’re really only strong enough to help train Feya.” He says ruefully, but when you can turn into a creature that won’t think twice about taking on a Tyranitar or three at the same time, you didn’t really need strong Pokemon at your side it was actually their job to keep him from doing it as best they could.
“Good match.” Tony says when they meet in the middle of the arena to shake hands as Bruce declares ‘Ex-Gym Leader Stark’ the winner. “Really, if this was a full team match I might have been in trouble.”
“Could you look Captain in the eye and say that?” Tony gives her a dirty look, while his having a Bravairy isn’t a surprise, he was an unofficial mascot of Castelia City’s Gym while he was the leader, after all, however, his name was never mentioned, Tony made a point of never bringing it up. After all, a name you gave a Pokemon as a child is going to be embarrassing when you’re in your late thirties. Bruce seems a little confused but doesn’t remark on it.
“Test them later, after he’s used to this decade.” Natasha says as her Pokemon finish healing. Tony sulks at her but she is long immune to it. “We should get lunch. Give him some space. I’m thinking the Johto Resturant on 8
“Tony, you got on everyone’s uh, case when we each moved in.” Bruce fielded, looking a little shy about bringing it up. Tony would cross his arms if it wasn’t for the fact there was a Seal patting his face in them already.
“The first person to have all three Pokemon unable to battle will end the match. Trainer Rogers, are you ready?”
Steve isn’t entirely sure what to do with this information, other than store it for later and see if it works. After all, he worked with some difficult people during the war, including Howard. Tony Stark shouldn’t be too different.
“But still, your Pokemon would be a challenge.” Tony raised an eyebrow, it might have been a long time ago but Tony still new a battle request when he heard one. Then Steve looked at Natasha again. “I’d like to challenge you both to battles.” They exchanged a look with each other then Tony looked at Bruce silently asking if he was challenged too, Bruce shook his head.
Being just over five feet in height, it was unavoidable that the Empoleon towered over the 8 inches of Klefki. He blinked down at Voleur and nodded politely, the small Steel Fairy only looked determined.
“You can say that.” Tony says watching the lethal and seemingly emotionless assassin dote on his Pokemon if he hadn’t already lived with her for 6 months and seen her regularly in the company of Jammira cuddling her regularly.
Tony doesn’t hear her. He knows well enough just by reading the papers what she said, his mind was already locked onto the project they wanted him to do. Steve Rogers's Pokeballs wouldn’t open and the freezing they endured has made it hard to read the data of the balls, they could be all corrupted and unable to be accessed anymore. Tony felt a cold drop in the pit of his stomach he looks over his left shoulder knowing his Lucario, Pepper was waiting there while watching over him. She was the first Pokemon he caught as a hasty natured Rilou. In their time together she was always the least likely to deal with his nonsense, she looks at him now and tilts her head, he knows full well if she wanted to she could reach into his mind and know what he’s feeling but she knows better than that. The thought of her ball not working, corrupting her data inside felt wrong.
“No wonder they had you kissing babies, you’re strangely adorable doing it.” Tony comments which caused Steve to give a bashful smile, which looked even more appealing than being cute with a small Pokemon. Tony knew this feeling and chose to ignore it. For… Now anyway.
“Natasha’s a spy, not really a long shot to think she could have ghost and dark types.” Tony answers, with normal type Pokemon completely resistant to ghost moves Tony has a feeling it cuts out half of her move pool while also limiting any shots strategies that would take out Sisters health over time. Meaning the Frostlass could have one hell of a time against the unassuming Audino, which are a regular sight in Unova Pokemon centres as they help the nursing staff heal Pokemon.
So Tony had done his best with the egg. He had made a harness to carry the egg while he walked or worked so he could keep it warm and with him at all times and even took it to bed with him, which as well as a heating pad ended up making Tony overheat at night. But when the egg started cracking he thought it all had been worth it, he ran to his mom as it started hatching to share it with her. His dad was in Hoenn so there was no point trying to show him. They both watched eagerly, his mom’s Pokemon also watching intently.
Both he and Coulson were quiet on the way up to the elevator, and he certainly didn’t expect to hear what he did as he stepped out of the elevator.
Bruce and Steve come in after a while with Bruce’s Clefairy Star who had You on her head, they both ran to Feya when they saw him to say hello.
“I don’t ignore my Pokemon.” His sentence is punctuated by a very obvious throat clearing from Pepper. “On purpose.” She gives a disdainful sniff, crossing her arms pointedly in the corner of his eye.
You rolled around before looking up at Justice and waving. He was jolly-natured and rarely acted like he took anything seriously. Justice looked very unimpressed. Steve just looked at the Alolan Pokemon curiously, obviously unaware of the creature's ability but wasn’t afraid to make the first move.
He became a hero in his own right, having high points and low points just like characters in the comics he had read as a child.
“It’s true, Stark’s dioramas are pretty neat.” Clint’s voice filled the kitchen as he and Natasha entered, Turning the closest chair around so it’s back faced the table Clint sat next to Tony and snatched up the folder and read it. “This is a joke right?” He looked up at Hill whose expression still had yet to change since she entered. Clint’s statement had Natasha look over his shoulder and raise an eyebrow.
After three weeks of working with Pokeballs that Happy froze he still wasn’t able to open them without corrupting the test data inside. Tony let out a frustrated noise as the screen flashes a notification about data corruption and rubbed at his face, Happy makes a baleful apologetic noise.
“It’s. Brown.” Tony says exactly what’s on his mind as the happy little brown Rufflet chirupped at everyone and snuggled into Tony. Tony can only see the brown colour as his failing somewhere, he knew Rufflet were meant to be a blue colour but he was sure he had done everything right. His lip started to shake.
