I go to lean in and kiss him again when my watch starts beeping.
“Maybe. But is moriarty really crazy enough to stab himself?”
“I hate being away from you.” She murmured against his jaw, his stubble grazing her skin.
“I said no, obviously.” John quipped, grinning when Sherlock noticed he’d used his ‘catchphrase’.
“Oh, I-“
Hope you enjoy this, I tried to make it as real as possible.
“If what I do next isn’t ok, please stop me.”
“Of course.”
“Yes, fine. Just trying to work out how to not choke on your penis.”
“Hey babe.”
“Whoops.” I chuckle after a moment.
Fucking hell, he feels so good. He’s so tight around my cock. I’m buried so deep inside him, and he’s taking it so well. I don’t think he’s ever looked more alluring than he does right now with his head thrown back, eyes closed as he bounces on my dick.
“Yes. Are you going to tell me the date as well?”
We don’t need to exchange anymore words, but our lips find their way back to each other without them.
“This is so hot.” He husked. “Fooling around at school.”
Rosie sighed, then chuckled.
“Not yet.”
“Just stay here with me.”
She pressed a parting kiss on johns lips before departing.
Sherlock is even still asleep.
“Ohhhh...” Sherlock groans, throwing his head back in to the door.
“John, darling.” His mother started. “Can you manage getting on to the other sofa?”
Sherlock bit back her tears as she tried to bring John back down from his hysterical fit.
“Hello Mrs Holmes.”
“You’re in a lot of trouble.”
“You had sex, didn’t you?”
Sherlock goes shopping for a surprise for John with the girls.
I’m not sure anymore whether I’m talking to him or myself, some of my own words only resonating with myself now as I speak them aloud.
Both sisters turned to look at John. His gaze was fixed on the small baby who was kicking and screaming in her pram.
John grinned.
Sherlock’s blush deepened further, and spread down his neck.
Sherlock pulled back, his eyebrows arched.
“Thank you for tying my bow.”
“Everything hurts, but in a good way.” Sherlock quipped with a cheeky smile.
“Yes.”
Sherlock moaned at this, arching his hips off the bed.
That evening, she’d gone to her trinket box. That was were she kept all the letters from John. It was also were she kept all the gifts from him. Wrapped in a square of velvet was the telescope he’d bought her for her birthday. She’d gone up to her window, and looked out at the stars. She knew it was cliche, but she couldn’t help but wonder whether John was looking up at the same stars.
I frown at him, but close them anyway. He takes my hand, and leads me for the remainder of the walk.
"Trying to find the news channel that's talking about the murdered teacher."
John was muscular, blond, and tanned, a striking contrast to the boy now hanging off his arm.
“Alright, slowly.” John rumbled as Sherlock gingerly sank down on to his cock.
His voice is breathy and horse as I push further in to his body.
I internally roll my eyes at my gentle tone. I mustn’t show weakness, not even if what may be the most beautiful individual I’ve ever seen is standing right in front of me... No. No weakness. No... no... I clear my throat, and straighten up. When I hand him the book, my tanned fingers come in to contact with his long, pale digits. I feel my brain threatening to short circuit again, so I quickly retract my hands, and march back to the bubble as fast as I can with my limp. I am fully aware that it’s psychosomatic, but the knowledge of this doesn’t change anything. My doctor cleared me to work, saying when it came to it, it wouldn’t actually physically stop me from doing anything, but you can’t show weakness of any kind in a place like this. No, this is not the kind of job my doctor recommended, but I knew I would lose my mind in any of the places she recommended. Gardening. Really?
John stayed for tea, then left through the hole in the fence.
I’ve gotta get out of here.
“I need your cock!”
Sherlock did as he was told. His ears perked up when he heard John rustling in his bed side table. He felt John grip his hands, and pull them behind his back. He guessed what was happening, but he still jumped when the cool leather touched his wrists.
Sherlock gulped.
John grabbed Sherlock’s hand, and practically dragged him all the way back home.
She grumbled, but obliged regardless.
“Oh, John darling. Are you alright?”
“He’s handling it well.”
“Sorry, Officer.” I say with mild shock amusement.
“Please.” I say, trying as hard as I can to keep the venom out of my voice.
“That works well. I’m not quite ready either. I’ve never had a relationship before, so... Anything else?”
“John?”
John could go to prison.
Sound, lights, people, it all came back at once. Sherlock’s eyes snapped open as he left his mind palace. John was stood before him, and was thrusting a phone, his phone, at him.
John shuts Sherlock out
“The chair. Move it, please.”
Even though I’m now alone, I don’t feel lonely.
“I want to make the most of her.”
Sherlock went to leave the bed, but John grabbed him by the wrists, and pulled him back down.
Sherlock crossed his arms, and leant them against the door.
Sherlock nodded, then set off in search of a cafeteria. He passed a sobbing Mrs Watson along the way, head in hands, bag clutched to her chest behind her elbows.
Sherlock shrugged in agreement, the corners of his lips turning up ever so slightly.
“Sherlock? It’s John.”
“Alright, is everyone finished?” Mr Holmes asked.
The notion that he wasn’t the only one feeling this way seemed to provide him a sense of comfort.
“Ok.”
“I live here.”
“”Aghhhrrr... joh- John!”
“You love me anyway!” John called from the hall.
Mycroft took Lucy from her pram, and gently placed the fussing infant in John’s arms before all but collapsing in to a lawn chair. John gently rocked Lucy back and forth, making soothing sounds as he did.
It’s different than before.
She could feel his erection pressing against her abdomen with each movement.
That’s always been one of my fears.
“You can’t leave me.” She said after a long pause.
He grins at me, a glint in his eyes.
Wiley little minx.
John bit his tongue.
His cock sprung free, red and pulsing, dripping pre cum. Although Sherlock had only seen johns cock twice before, he’d already become rather accustomed to it. This time it was less awkward as he had some idea of what he was doing, and what John liked. He didn’t need to be so nervous. He took one more look at John’s throbbing member, taking time to memorise it properly this time, before gingerly placing his mouth around it.
Sherlock nodded enthusiastically, and let a breathy ‘yes’ fall from her lips. John joined their lips in a passionate kiss as he brought his hands to the apex of her thigh. He thrust his tongue in to her mouth as he gingerly stroked a finger along her dripping lower lips.
Sorry this took a while, things have been busy, and I’ve had a touch of writers block... hope you enjoy!
“I have not.”
“Indeed it was.”
“Shoes.” Is all he says before he gets sucked back in.
Sherlock nodded his head in acknowledgment.
“Where did you read that?”
“I’m fine.”
“Hey baby. The girls said they took you shopping?”
Sherlock tilted her head and looked at the ‘wilting’ baby, and decided her mother might be right.
He grins, then gets up to look for his trousers.
“Say stop at any point, Alright?”
“Yes. Home.”
After that, I’m free.
“Are you Alright? Sherlock?”
“Ok.” Sherlock grinned. “The jumper and socks are fine though. We’ll be sure to wash them.”
John still hasn’t recovered from my last relapse.
John finally comes out to his parents, who have very different reactions.
“Greg. I don’t know. I hope. I think you’ll like him Sherlock.”
“Yes.”
“I was there.”
“How would you know? I never talk to you about anything.” John hissed, his hands curling into fists.
“You know how it is.” She said, sympathetically squeezing Sherlock’s shoulder. She’d always liked Mrs Watson. She was nice to her, and always had ginger nut biscuits.
“Fuck off Harry.” John hissed, shoving a breakfast muffin in his mouth.
“Alright.” He said with an eye roll, then retreated back the way he came.
I can tell that what is perceived as arrogance by other people is really just a desperate search for approval, validation, praise. This is just how he relates to people, and it rubs them up the wrong way. Although, I will say he is a bit if a show off. That might be underplaying a little...
Sherlock wriggled off John’s lap and trekked over to the bathroom.
“What’s wrong?” Sherlock asked, finally sitting up.
“It’s 2 am, we shouldn- ooofff...” she groaned as the pain returned.
He gasps as the cold steel pushes in to his flesh, warm blood collecting on the front of his khakis.
“Sherlock! Come inside!” Mrs Hudson called.
“Jesus Christ!” John helped, jumping back half a foot.
Sherlock quirked his eyebrows.
“I know.” Sherlock gasped out before John’s lips were on his again.
“I’m gonna fuck your pretty little ass so hard that you won’t be able to sit for a week.” John growled in his ear.
What if it really hurts?
Needless to say, myself and John have separated and are stood about a foot apart.
“You’ve got chocolate sauce in your hair.” John chuckled, pressing a kiss to the sweet spot where Sherlock’s jaw met his ear.
“Sure?”
John looked at Sherlock from under his brows, and poked his tongue out to lick his lips, an action that made Sherlock weak at the knees. No, no, this was school. A place of learning. ‘Yes, learning how to best pleasure your boyfriend’ said the little voice in Sherlock’s head.
“Yeah, baby.”
“Well is he?!”
“You did indeed.” He said flatly after a moment, determined not to laugh and to keep a blank expression.
“We’re going clubbing.” Molly said with a grin.
“I know you do, but that doesn’t explain why you wanted to see me.”
Being as careful as possible, John slowly pulled out his softened cock.
He stops tousling his hair and looks up at me.
“Why? Ah!” Sherlock gasped as John briefly hit his prostate.
“Ok. Ok.” He cooed, tilting Sherlock’s chin up so he could press their lips together. “I’ll pay... attention... to you.”
He wasn’t sure what it was, but johns tone sent shiver down his spine, and his cheeks flush.
“Fuck.”
John chuckled despite himself, and held Sherlock tighter. He lay like that, just stroking Sherlock’s hair as he finished his milk, his arm going numb by the time Sherlock finally fell asleep.
“Sherlock?” He asked whilst he was able to keep his eyes open.
One didn’t have to have Sherlock’s brilliant mind to see that he wasn’t ok.
He bucks his hips again, and this time it’s not terrible. It’s not painful, more uncomfortable, like a pressure low in my abdomen and at the base of my spine.
He got himself under control before slowly pulling his fingers back out again.
“Perhaps John, would like to take you to the station?”
“Ah... oh...” Sherlock panted, his body slumping forwards.
A quiet tap on the window had her look up, her cerulean eyes flying wide in both shock and joy.
“There’s fine. Thank you.”
“What? I’m 15, I don’t need my mother to drop me at sch-“
“I started playing rugby. I got a cut on my leg. I think it’ll turn into a cool scar.”
“Mmnnghh!” Sherlock wailed, thrashing his head from side to side.
“Fast... and hard... I want you... fast and hard...” I pant against his lips. “Fuck me as hard as you can.”
“Ah- oh... Green.”
“It’s not funny John.”
Oh, Jesus.
They gazed in to each other’s eyes for a moment, the tension between them skyrocketing.
“Better than you’ll ever get Thompson.”
He made a sound of exasperation, and threw his hands up.
“Nope.” He grumbled as felt himself dozing off again.
“You have to-“
“English and chemistry.” Sherlock mumbled, staring inquisitively at his sandwich.
“Why? I don’t know anything about sportswear.”
John looked up at Sherlock from the popcorn he was pouring into a bowl.
“What’s wrong?” The brunette asked, turning to see what he was looking at.
John grinned wickedly, and turned to press a kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
“Go on then.”
“I can give it a shot. Probably won’t be as good though.”
“Oh, that. I uhh... was wondering what your plans are once you’re out of here...?”
John takes Sherlock on a date.
“Sherlock.”
“Take these, and come back to me in four hours if you’re still in pain.”
“Get your legs over my shoulders.”
“Mummy says dinner is on the table. That is of course... if you’re still hungry.”
“Nothing, Nothing. I was merely... let us say feeling rather... skeptical about this conversation. As I’m sure you know, I have very limited knowledge on the subject of carnal relations, and thusly, the conversation will be all but one sided.” He rambles, pausing only when he realises that he is indeed doing said action.
“Do you want to go upstairs?” John sighed heavily.
“Come on then. Can’t leave your mummy waiting.”
“I’ll come home. I will.” He whimpered, burring his face in her hair.
“Ok, you can open your eyes.”
And just like that, she felt like she was staring in to John’s very own gunmetal blues.
“All my underwear was longer than the skirt.”
“Ok.” John smiled.
John snapped out of his daze, and turned to look at the brunette, who was regarding him with his piercing, puppy dog eyes.
“Shall we grab a table?” Mike asked, pointing over to a few standing tables.
“I thought that this might spice up our relatively boring day. We can’t have sex, so...” John shrugged with a chuckle. “I thought I’d amuse myself by keeping this on my person for a few hours.”
“And what’s that?”
Sherlock couldn’t help the broad grin that crept on to his face as he leant in to the kiss.
I have allowed myself to be seduced by an inmate.
Sherlock pouted at John, and stuck his tongue out at him.
“Of shit.”
“He essentially is the British government, yes.” I nod, wondering why my ‘oh so successful big brother with the amazing job at only 26 years old’ has to do with anything. “Why?”
It was freshers week, and John was attending his first uni party.
“Fuck...” John sighed, and collapsed on Sherlock’s shaking body.
“I want you to scream so loud they can hear you over the music!”
“Stretch yourself for me, baby.”
“Greg.” Mycroft interrupted.
I don’t want to stop him, but I can already feel the familiar sensation of an approaching climax, threatening to shellack my inhibitions.
“I love you... but seriously, why did you ask me here?” He grins as he pulls back.
His eyes were wild and bloodshot when he met her gaze.
“You wearing any pants?”
“Thanks.”
“What?” He asked, his normally sharp mind still a little fuzzy from earlier.
He would.
I don’t say anything and continue to force myself to eat. The guards switch posts before I have a chance to go back to... observing... him. After lunch, I quickly go back to my bunk. I read for a little, a simple pass time to stop me from going mad. Mike comes back shortly after and submerges himself in a radio show. I look up at the clock. Work duty. I put on my jacket, and hightail it outside. I don’t mind working in the garden. Horticulture is something that has always peaked my interest. Of course I’d much rather something more interesting than squash, but what are you going to do? I sign out a rake, and get to turning the soil. It’s not exactly very mentally stimulating, but physical exertion is the only option I have right now. God, prison is dull.
‘Oh, oh, oh oh,
“Mother?”
It should be ‘my boyfriend and I.’
“Your guard’s back.”
“Oh?”
He flashed him his signature boyish grin, then turned on his heel, and left. He wandered down to his biology class, which he actually enjoyed, although he couldn’t stand his teacher. Mr Mitchell was a stuck up prick, who was always desperate to catch Sherlock out. So far, every attempt had been a fail. Sherlock quickly walked to the classroom, not a challenge on his long legs, and slumped down in a chair in the second row by the window. His usual logistics for where to sit to avoid getting called on thrown out the window, as he knew Mitchell would find him wherever he sat. The only way he could go undetected was if he threw himself out the window, and ran home. He also knew his stuff when it came to biology, and any opportunity to show other people that was one he grasped with both hands. He ignored the snide comments other children exchanged as he walked the halls. That’s what he’d always done. Other children filtered into the room, including his lab partner, Molly Hooper. Molly was a bouncy girl with light brown hair, hazel eyes, a pale complexion, and a gigantic crush on Sherlock, which she was terrible at hiding.
“How interesting.” I say flatly.
Even though this is completely staged, I find myself obligated to avoid my normal tendency to obstinate, and obey instead.
Sherlock age: 12
“Cum for me.” John growled by his ear.
A grin appeared on Sherlock’s face as he stepped in between John’s legs.
John supported his weight on his left arm as he leant in to kiss Sherlock.
He hit replay, and grinned to himself when he saw Sherlock lightly bobbing his head in time to the beat.
“You know your safety word. If you need me to stop...” He husked by Sherlock’s ear. “You know what to say.”
“Age is not necessarily a factor in the art of making friends, besides I neither want, nor need friends, so your logic is moot.” The teen stated matter of factually, folding her hands behind her back.
I let out a noise mixed between a moan and a shriek as I collide with his hard body.
“Thank you Lily. Be sure to have a cup yourself dear.”
“Bye babe. See ya guys.”
My older brother stares down his hook nose at me with his beady eyes, a smirk playing at his lips.
I fall back in exhaustion, a thin layer of cooling sweat coating my skin.
Her corset pushed her breast up in the most delightful way, practically spilling over the top. His hormones were raging, the sight before him somewhat maddening. The only downer was that he’d still have to figure out how to take it off. He sighed in exasperation when he realised what a task that would be.
I stand in the corner, staring at Moriarty as he does to Sherlock.
They tumbled in to their room, never breaking the kiss, not able to get enough of the other. John pinned Sherlock to the door with his hips, running his hands down his body.
"What thing?"
“You ok?”
Sherlock grinned, and pressed their lips back together.
He chuckles and presses a kiss to my lips.
“Hey.” Sherlock replied, unable to take his eyes off him.
“Bloody people!” He declared before storming upstairs.
Sherlock and John overhear more than they bargained for.
“And...”
Sherlock age: 16
John now bucked his hips with abandon, forcefully  slamming into Sherlock with each thrust.
“Are you sure you’re alright?”
Although I may not be very good at socialising with other individuals, I have a working understanding of human psychology, and know exactly how to use it.
She felt her breath hitch as she took in the sight of him. John was of average height, but he had always been broad and muscular, so it was no surprise to her that he was generously endowed. Between his legs was eight inches of thick cock. She felt all her instincts kicking in, telling her to touch him. She began forcefully kissing him before wrapping her hand around him.
Gunfire raged loudly, the humdrum roar of the tanks deafening, the smell of blood,
“John...” Sherlock moaned, breathing heavily.
John turns to playfully glare at me.
“How did you know if mike didn’t tell you?” John asked, rummaging in his back for his text book.”
John switched to suck on her other breast, lightly grazing the skin with his teeth.
She sat there in tears as John recounted his story of capture and torture to her. When he stopped answering her letters, she’d assumed the worst. She hadn’t been far off. The pair sat for a hours, swapping stories. Sherlock told John about the brief month she’d belonged to the girl guides. She’d been praised for her abilities to remember long messages, and pass them on, but she’d been dismissed after telling one of the scouts he was a simpering idiot, who made the dog who tagged along by his heels look like a genius, on the grounds that it was ‘unladylike’. He laughed as she recounted the time Mycroft got arrested. She’d joined the sufferagets, and had been carted off by a police officer after thumping him with her umbrella. That was also, no doubt, ‘unladylike’.
“Hi.”
“John!” Sherlock squealed excitedly, grabbing at the air in front of him from where he lay on his back on the floor. John walked across the floor, and helped his boyfriend to his feet.
“You’re home, John.”
“Mother and father are coming into see us. I need to borrow one of your female friends.”
Sherlock squeaked suddenly when he felt Johns hand on his inner thigh. Thankfully, no one noticed. Sherlock chewed the inside of his cheek as he tried to refrain from either giggling or moaning. John wasn’t sure. He moved his hand further up, and Sherlock closed his eyes. John could feel Sherlock hardening through his jeans as they finished off their dinner. As time went on, Sherlock was finding it harder and harder to concentrate, and John was finding it harder not to laugh. Sherlock was clenching his chair by the time his mum finally took their plates away.
“You don’t mean that. There will be a repeat next year.” Mycroft said as she tried to get up.
“You alright?”
“Well, That wasn’t exactly words, but...” John chuckled. He reached down to grasp Sherlock’s hand, and squeezed it affectionately.
The brunette raised his head, and a smile broke on to his face. He ran over to John, and halted in his path before he ran into him.
“Yes. I do.” John said with a smile.
They stared at each other for a moment, gaze flickering from the others eyes and lips. Sherlock eventually broke his gaze, only for it to fall on a number of johns fellow teammates embracing and kissing their girlfriends. John followed his gaze to the group of teens, then turned back to him with a sad smile.
“Yes.”
“Coach Magnussen asked me to bring these out to you.”
Greg had been recruited, and left the same morning as John. Mycroft had spotted Sherlock in her dark coat wandering along the platform, far too close to the edge. After she’d stopped Sherlock from jumping, she’d sat with her on the freezing ground until she stopped crying. They sat in silence on the tram ride home, and Sherlock left for her room where she had remained since.
“No, you’re going to bed.”
“Yes please.” She nodded with a smile, shuffling about in her chair to get more comfortable, an impossible task she realised as she sat with her legs sprawled.
29th of June 1915
“Nope.”
“Are you ok?” John asked after a moment, the sudden reminder that Sherlock was in pain for the majority of the encounter.
With my body, I try and tell him “There, right there, don’t you dare stop.”
That’ll work.
John and Sherlock both got up, and followed the doctor to where harry was being kept. On the bed lay a girl of about 19, same blonde hair as John, but with green eyes instead of grey. Her face was washed out, and there were remainders of makeup under her eyes, but she conformed to the desired, traditional beauty.
“I’m well aware that you won’t talk to me, but that doesn’t mean I can’t talk to you.”
Except how to stop a child from crying.
“One, You look way too happy, two, you’re sneaking back in the early hours of the morning, and three, an innocent person would have just flat out said ‘no, I didn’t.”
“Gah!”
“Why... why isn’t he here?” She wailed, finally accepting comfort from her mother as she sat down beside her.
“Yessss...”
John nodded in affirmation before slowly moving his hips forward. Sherlock shuffled his pelvis into a more comfortable position, and rearranged his legs so they locked around Johns back. He let out a small sigh of content when John moved again, the weird sensation becoming more of a pleasant one.
“I’ll be waiting right here for you.”
‘The war would be over by Christmas’ they said. ‘Our boys would be home by Christmas’ they said. ‘You’ll return war heroes’ they said. But the war was still raging, the boys were still fighting, and some of them wouldn’t be returning at all.
John reached out to tuck a loose curl behind Sherlock’s ear.
Sherlock wrapped his legs around johns waist, and flung his arms around his neck.
“Are you sure you wouldn’t rather one of us go?”
She left down the corridor leaving Sherlock to state after her. When she returned, there was a maroon dress draped over arms.
“Alright?”
“It was. Pretty pathetic for a first kiss, huh?”
That was always what he called him, never John. His father made it seem as though he was only proud of his athletic achievements. Calling him ‘champ’ almost made it seem like they had a coach/student relationship. It was so impersonal, John thought.
Upset... that she was upset...
On her way back, she noticed how tired she was. Bearing a child was becoming an ever tiering task.
His mother’s face contorted to show concern, fear even. John couldn’t blame her. Last time they had a conversation like this, it was about Harriet’s drinking, and the time before that it was about his father leaving. He supposed that compared to all that, having a boyfriend was not a big deal.
“No, you’re good.”
Sherlock turned to smile at her nanny.
“Oh. Alright.”
We manage to get all the way inside without anybody seeing us, down the corridors and in to the break room.
The dress was perfect. It was a beautiful colour, and it fit almost perfectly. Mycroft was right; John was going to love it.
He was so stiff and achy as he lay with John that he made no effort to hide the grunt of disapproval that escaped him as the athlete sat up.
“Are you sure.”
“Letter for you darling.” Her mother said enthusiastically, practically thrusting the letter out to her. They all found themselves staring at her as she took it with a shaky hand. She sliced it open with an overgrown nail, and took out the carefully folded paper. She instantly recognised the hand writing as John’s.
“Oh fuck.” John chuckled as they tried to reorganise themselves. Sherlock giggled, and buried his head in Johns neck. They eventually managed to stand up, and stumble in to Sherlock’s room.
“If you doubt that, maybe you should walk me back...”
He pressed a sleepy kiss to the corner of John’s mouth, then wrapped himself in his fluffy dressing gown. He waved at John before disappearing down the corridor.
“I’m going to see Mrs Watson. Will you come with me?”
“No, I have things to do around here.”
Sherlock stood in silence, unsure of how to respond. Before she could come up with anything, the room went quiet. Sherlock was first through the door, closely followed by Mrs Watson. John was sat bolt right up, white as a sheet, eyes wide and bloodshot. When he was like this, Sherlock wasn’t sure he could even see her in the room. Although he was awake, he was still very much lost in his own head. It took a few moments for his breathing to return to normal, and for him to start blinking again. Sherlock slowly walked over to his side, and sat down on the floor. After a moment, john reached out and slowly entangled their fingers, words unnecessary. He didn’t need to tell her he needed her. She already knew that.
Yesterday, today, and tomorrow; we are soldiers.”
Oh yes, that.
“Alright.”
“I need to get changed.” Sherlock mumbled as he pulled back.
“You ok?”
John’s POV
“I’ll let you know if we hear anything, of course. You write him a lot, don’t you?”
“Nice.” John chuckled. “I’d say crazy hot, but sure. Fucking is nice.”
“Fancy a chat?”
He always looks so studious when he does this, like it’s a complicated question on an exam, or a rubick’s cube.
“Hepatitis is going round. You need your vaccination.”
They looked up to see their roommate Rosie in the doorway.
“We’ve got about half an hour just sitting in the station now.”
This was as close as he was going to get.
“But I have a game shortly...”
“Fu- oh! Agh!” Sherlock howled, the pressure in his abdomen driving him insane.
They pulled back abruptly, their cheeks hot. Neither child could look at the other, so their gaze remained on the floor, or the ceiling, both of which had suddenly become of the upmost interest.
When we arrive at medical, I inform Molly of the conflict between Sherlock and Moriarty.
“No one knows that. And they can’t.”
“Would you umm... want to...”
“You’re not enjoying yourself, are you?”
“Sit back.”
I stand there, dumbfounded, in the corner of the library just holding a bundle of cloth... what even is this?
He’d never tasted it before, and he certainly never though the first he tried would be his own.
John stared at himself in the small mirror on the wall.
She wasn’t surprised when she found Mrs Hudson awkwardly loitering just outside the door.
💖Sherlock💖: I do indeed.
“Hello Mrs Watson.”
“Right, back to minimum.”
She crossed the floor in a pace or two, and opened the window, which thankfully, slid up instead of opening out.
“I’m here, I’m here.” She cooed as she held the small infant up to her chest.
“Yes! Oh god!”
“That felt good.”
John glared playfully at him.
He pursed his lips.
Love Sherlock xxx
“Alright. Thank you for the invitation. John will be at rugby pretty much all day anyway, so I’ll be great full for the company. When are we going?”
Sorry guys, I hit a writers block. Enjoy!
“I’m surprised you didn’t see it.” He says after a few minutes. “You are a medical student after all.”
“The war is over! We won!”
The colour drained from Sherlock’s face as he followed johns gaze to where they were still joined.
The next few sentences out of Sherlock’s mouth had John speechless.
“You know what you need to say if it gets too much, don’t you?” He asked, running a hand through Sherlock’s curls.
“It’s a shame Harriet doesn’t have a chap.”
“That’s why I’m going to a hotel.” Molly murmured, playfully glaring at the brunette across from her, who winked at her in response.
“Use a good laundry detergent, and we can keep it.” John said with a wink.
After they’d finished their coffees, they went knocking next door for Mrs Hudson.
I feel every protective instinct I have for Sherlock desperately trying to over ride the confusion, the rage, the disappointment I also feel towards him right now.
“Well...” He cooed seductively as he dragged a finger down johns chest.
Sherlock accepted johns hand, and followed him upstairs.
“Ok. If um... if anything happens... I’ll be there for you, you know that right?”
John smiled broadly, and leant in to kiss Sherlock’s lips.
He managed to shuffle the pillows out from underneath the brunette’s back, then  carefully manoeuvred Sherlock’s softening cock to the side so he could lie down again.
“Indeed.”
“Maybe that’s why she won’t look at him.” She offered.
“Carry me.” He pleaded, nuzzling his head under johns chin.
25th of December 1910
John got up from the chair, took the laptop from Sherlock, and typed into the search engine. He sat down at the edge of the bed, the laptop resting on his thighs. He clicked on the video, and turned the laptop so Sherlock could see. Said curly haired boy leaned in closer so he could see, only a few inches away from John.
“I’m going to start for real now. Is that ok?”
He held her close to his chest whilst she screamed and kicked.
“Yes.” He said softly as his fingers traced Sherlock’s cursive handwriting.
“Do you like it?”
“Lie back then.”
He bit down on Johns shoulder as his orgasm hit him, waves and waves of pleasure crashing down around him. It didn’t take very much to send Sherlock over the edge, but that didn’t make it any less rewarding. John couldn’t help but moan as well as he watched Sherlock come apart. Sherlock was in too much pleasure to pay any mind to the fact that this was now the second time John had made him cum in his underwear.
He runs his beady eyes over me, and I have to resist the urge to pull my shirt collar up to hide the hickeys I know aren’t on view.
“Oh, hey Sherlock.”
“Don’t let that ruin our evening, mmm?”
“Come here.”
A doctor appeared down the corridor, a clipboard in hand, marching towards them. Late thirties, young children, ex smoker.
“Oh fuck... How’s... how’s this?” John asked, his voice strained and husky.
Another finger, and Sherlock was thrashing about, moaning John’s name. One more, and he was on the verge of tears, desperate for release. John was rock hard, his cock throbbing between his legs.
Sherlock looked at him, questioning.
I finally cum with a low groan before collapsing against the backs of his thighs.
Sherlock looked behind johns head to see Rosie, but didn’t pull away.
“Oh!” Sherlock squealed when he felt Johns soft lips envelope his cock.
“Unlocked.” John smiled as he pulled Sherlock in after him.
“I didn’t want to help. Feels like we’re just packing you up. Don’t really want to speed that process along.” John stated sadly. “If you wanted to go, I’d keep this to myself, but...”
John’s voice is a husky purr by my ear as he nips at my skin.
“I want you to.”
Sherlock begrudgingly left Mycroft’s room, and went to get changed.
She finally let the grin break out when she left the room. Manipulating Sherlock was a skill she’d perfected when the girl was merely 2 years old.
“Photo?” Jefferson asked as he settled down in his bunk opposite John. “Sorry, I don’t mean to pry.” He said when John met him with a blank stare.
John responded by rolling his hips down on Sherlock’s, his erection poking into his creamy thigh.
“No.” John said quickly. “You’re not distracting me at all.”
Mrs Holmes said slowly, her eyes drifting down Sherlock’s form.
John chuckled.
John ducked his head, and without kissing his skin, brushed his lips against the small of Sherlock’s back.
“I’ll just get some supplies from kitchen.”
“I’m wearing this to class today.”
“Sherlock?”
“You haven’t met Lucy yet.” She said flatly.
Focus on that, focus on that.
Fuck, he really is innocent.
He falls asleep on the sofa.
“I love hearing you beg.” John rumbled, Sherlock’s pleads sending waves of pleasure down to his cock.
I reach down between us and grasp his throbbing cock.
“Was that not ok?”
“Yeah... at least, I thought so. I mean, we are hanging out.”
He swivelled round in his chair to look at her, her doe eyes questioning.
Soon, Sherlock’s trousers and underwear were gone too. He was completely naked in front of John. There was an odd sort of thrill to it as John drank him in with hungry eyes. John ducked his head, and kissed Sherlock’s hipbone. His pelvis tilted upwards, a small moan escaping him. He watched as johns lips travelled further down his body until they were at the tip of his throbbing length. Johns eyes locked with his in asking. After Sherlock’s nod, the older boy shot him a wink, then wrapped his mouth around his cock.
“I’ll be gentle.”
Sherlock did as he was told, and patiently waited for johns next instruction. He felt John right next to him, his warm, minty breath tickling his skin, and turned his head towards the sound of his voice. He yelped when he felt Johns hand on his cock.
I have enough of my own nightmares to know exactly what he’s feeling.
Sherlock’s bed as he tried to sort out the fastening on his trousers. Sherlock came back a few minutes later in a fresh pair of clothes.
He acts like I haven’t taken him on all fours whilst both his hands and ankles are cuffed.
“How...?” She murmured. “We all look half dead.”
John pressed an open mouth kiss to his lips, swiping his tongue along Sherlock’s briefly before pulling back with a grin.
It was wonderful...
Based on everything else we’ve done, I can’t imagine this would be different.
Sherlock undid the buttons of John’s shirt with haste, and pulled it down his arms before blindly throwing it behind her.
Harriet was familiar with Sherlock’s bluntness, and didn’t take offence.
“Yes sir.”
The buzzing starts again.
“Ok.”
“We’re going shopping, do you wanna come with? Buy some of your own skirts to ruin.” Rosie grinned.
“Sherlock?” Mycroft’s icy voice rumbled from the kitchen.
Bad idea, bad idea.
“John?” Sherlock drawled, gazing up at the blond from where he was resting his head on his broad chest.
I find his lips again in a hungry assault, and bring both hands up to cup his face.
“Getting yourself all worked up during work hours... tut tut tut.”
Sherlock slurred some explanation as to how she knew all this, but John wasn’t sure he would have even understood her if they were both sober. Regardless of what she’d been drinking, the girl spoke faster than a bullet train. The pair spewed nonsense to each other till they were gasping for breath from giggling.
“I’m going to get you back for that by the way.” John chuckled mirthlessly as Sherlock stripped him of his shirt.
“Noooo...” Sherlock complained, giggling softly.
The next time she awoke, she was on the sofa, and she was alone. It was now 07:30. It took her a moment to catch on, but she remembered what John had said after a moment. Johns train was at 08:00. She didn’t have time to get dressed. She pulled on her boots, threw on her coat, left the house, and ran down the street still trying to do up her buttons. She took the tram to the train station, all but throwing her fair at the poor driver. When she got to the station, she ran to the information desk, and shouted her question about johns train to the man who may have been very great full for the glass between them. He stuttered out the platform number, and she was off again. She caught sight of the blond a few feet down the platform, Harriet and his parents around him.
John pressed a kiss to sherlocks lips before reaching down to the end of the bed for the Aloe Vera.
“Later.” He said with a wink, then lead Sherlock into school.
“I need to get dressed too.” John murmured.
“Thank you for telling me... I...”
She buried her head under her pillow, a sad attempt at blocking out the noise.
His mum came bustling into the hallway, her knitting clutched in her hands, undoubtedly another scarf or hat for Harry, which would be tossed into her wardrobe, and never seen again. John’s mum was a short, blonde woman on the plump side, with bright green eyes and rosy cheeks, which were often stained with tears, his sister’s doing. Harry had been at the drink since she got her first fake ID at 15. Some days she was perfectly fine, and was relatively content. Those were the days she was sober. Then there were the days she would drink herself to sleep. She would hurl abuse, throw things, and lock herself in her room for hours on end. Then of course there were days when she wasn’t there at all. She could disappear for days, then tumble back through the door, reeking of vodka, without so much as a simple explanation. It tore his mother to pieces. It wasn’t exactly easy for him either. They used to be close. She used to look after him, and watch out for him. Now, she acted like he wasn’t even there. John quickly pushed these thoughts aside, desperate for his mother not to notice the tears brimming in his eyes.
John.
“Would you like a drink?”
“Like the ones you gave me for Christmas.”
John furrowed his brows, then looked back at the other boy. He was regarding the blond with a nervous disposition, awkwardly shuffling his feet.
“Oh he didn’t try to, he succeeded. He’s been in the system a long time... No clue how he ended up in minimum.”
They turned to look at each other, a smirk playing at the corner of Johns lips. Five minutes later, Sherlock and John were fighting down johns staircase with two wooden swords. John had a bandana tied around his head, and Sherlock had a pirates hat balanced atop his unruly curls.
“Green.”
“It’s ok.”
John allows a low groan to fall from his parted lips, his chest heaving as he comprehends my request.
“Maybe I’ll give it to you.” He growled, chewing his bottom lip between his teeth.
“You ok?” John asked in concern, cautiously pulling his finger out.
“Do you have a girlfriend?”
Sherlock smiled against John’s lips as they exchanged a kiss.
He shrugs and shakes his head.
John age: 17
“You do that on purpose?”
“Drama queen.” He chuckled in affection.
John went to stand up, but winced in pain, and sat back down.
John paused for a moment. The brilliant boy before him had such doubt about himself that he wasn’t sure any of this had really happened.
I censor myself from telling him exactly what I plan to do with them later, although surly that was his intention when he gave them to me.
She threw her head back, wailing in acute pain.
Sherlock had opted for covering up how nervous he was with allowing himself to get lost in the foreplay, but he couldn’t deny the nagging feeling in his stomach that got stronger and stronger as the moment got more real.
Sherlock turned to glare at his older brother who smirked in response.
Sherlock doubled over with a low groan as he ejaculated.
He’s breathless and eager as he grabs at my face to pull me back in for another kiss.
Quiet involuntarily, I flinch and pull my hand away from him.
“Alright, so when are we doing this to Sherlock?”
“Brother, dear.”
Back in minimum. Back with John.
He squeezes my hand, then departs down the hall.
“Oh fuck!”
He feels amazing too.
“Meet your daddy” Sherlock cooed to him as she passed the baby over to John.
Kissing him just feels... right.
About a year later, Mycroft went to finishing school, leaving Sherlock without company most of the time. She was used to just being with her mother in her earlier years, as her father had a job in a bank and was often not home. But without the older Holmes daughter, the house was painfully quiet. Although there was no one around to insult her intelligence, she’d almost begun to miss the sharp featured girl.
John moved his head down to Sherlock’s shoulder, and started placing kisses there, and dipping his tongue into his collarbone.
“Yes, well I bought it before I got pregnant, then it didn’t fit me, and now everything I wear gets spit up on it, so...”
“Your shirt is buttoned wrong.” Sherlock said, his eyes scanning johns midsection.
I just want to be able to put protective shields up around him and keep him safe. But I can’t. Not whilst he’s still in here.
Sherlock looked so hot in his little kitten ears. They were a nice, vibrant contrast to the dark curls they were nestled in. He’d put them on as soon as they’d got in, and was just floating around the room with them perched on his head. John was desperately horny, and wanted nothing more than to plow Sherlock in to tomorrow, but unfortunately he’d discovered his paper was due tomorrow, not Tuesday. So, he was buried in his work while Sherlock waited patiently. Well, he was patient up to a point. He’d been waiting now for about an hour, and he’d got bored. John didn’t notice as he slipped a CD in to the stereo, a smooth jazz CD to be precise. The blond looked up immediately, eyebrows raised as he caught sight of his boyfriend. The brunette was facing away from him as he slowly swished his hips from side to side.
“What did you do to deserve this punishment?”
“Well enough. And you?”
He cried out the name of the gorgeous blond before falling back on his bed, exhausted, and elated. He couldn’t help but marvel at how wonderful his body felt, practically buzzing with endorphins. He could only be sorry that he’d been asleep for his very first orgasm. He would have stayed there all day if his mother didn’t come knocking for him.
Sherlock and John get wasted.
“Right, That should be warm enough.” John stood back, hands on his hips as he watched the bath fill up.
“I’m gonna... oh... I- Agh!”
“Mmnnnggh!” Sherlock cried.
“What do I want to do with you?”
I roll my eyes, but follow him with a smile.
“It’s alright dear. But I’m only doing this once. Just remember, I’m not you’re childminder anymore.”
A small squeak escapes him as his back collides with the door, but I silence him by crashing our mouths together in an excited kiss that bruises our lips and causes our teeth to clack.
Sherlock faltered for a moment.
“Fuck...” he said simply when he finally came down from his high.
“You look so hot.” John breathed, darting his tongue out to lick his lips.
“Mycroft, sherlock! Come down please!” Their mother called from the hallway.
“What?”
She flung her arms around his neck, and held him tight.
“I love you too.”
“They were having sex!” Rosie hollered. She was steadying herself on Greg’s arm who must have arrived since the couple snuck off.
“Did I say I was asking you?”
“Mmmm...” He moaned happily, giggling a little as John ran his hands up his chest.
“Nowhere in particular.”
“Just asking you.”
They both turned around when they heard Mycroft appear at the door with Lucy.
“I came to the thought of you.” He blurted, shifting his gaze to John’s for a brief second. Johns lips pulled into a grin. Imagining Sherlock getting off to the thought of him turned him on even more so than he already was.
Sherlock snapped his attention back to Rosie.
Sherlock leant up on her elbows, pressed her lips to johns ears, and whispered:
“Yes.” Sherlock panted, rolling his neck.
“Sherlock Holmes. He’s a freak. He knows way more than he should. He doesn’t even need to be in this school. He could go to one of those schools for gifted kids, but he likes to freak out the kids here. Likes to think he’s better than them.”
“That’s it. Oh god... yes, just like that.”
He pulls back and searches my eyes for a moment, blinking in an attempt at comprehension.
“Yeah. Thought it might set the mood.”
The older girl looked over to Sherlock, then nodded her head.
“Yes, I’m fine.”
He sighed in defeat.
“Who did you have sex with?” Molly asked.
“More... please... anghhhh...”
1823-1909
John squeezed his thighs harder, gently grazing his milky skin with his nails as he pulled him closer. Sherlock got louder as John’s movements got faster. By this point, he was having to hold Sherlock down by his hips as they bucked off the bed at a rapid pace.
The last time she had been in this position it was Mycroft holding her whilst she screamed for John to come back.
I raise my eyebrows.
I run through this list as I gingerly wrap my mouth around the leaking head of his cock.
“Oh, sherlocks here? That’s nice darling. Does his mother know he’s here?”
“Midnight.”
That’s not a no.
Am I leading her on?
“Oh, please. He’s always been moody. Even when he was chubby. The diet just makes him worse. Who knew that was possible...” Sherlock muttered, popping an olive into his mouth.
This time, I want to taste him.
The boy jumped, a deafening note coming from the violin.
Enjoy the jam,
The age gap isn’t too noticeable because you know... Sherlock’s a genius.
“I did training with the girl guides. It was about the only useful thing they taught me. So, I can do it. If you don’t want me to-“
“I need to... I...” Sherlock gasped, reaching down between them to undo the buckle of his belt.
(See the end of the chapter for
And a yellow telegram.
John sighed, and took another puff.
Sherlock pressed a parting kiss to johns lips before sauntering off in to the bathroom. John sat himself down on
“Alright, open.”
My shoulder is brushing up against his, and our knees bump each other periodically.
John and Sherlock engage in ‘carnal activities’. Sherlock never takes the skirt off.
“This was the only thing I could attach myself to that was steady... and I knocked the keys off the bed with my knee- ah...”
“Mmmm...” John groaned low in his throat as Sherlock worked his lips, his hands finding their wait to sherlock’s slender waist, gently grazing the exposed skin where his shirt had risen.
Oh, fucking hell.
John didn’t want to make him cum yet.
“He’s in SHU, I’d imagine. They’ll take guard testimonies, then they’ll decide what to do about him.”
“No, it’s not that. I’m just unfamiliar with the formalities.”
“I know.” She grumbled as she shoved the tin somewhat unceremoniously in to her messenger bag.
John couldn’t help but smile to himself. He couldn’t believe how lucky he was. It hadn’t always been easy with Sherlock. He’d been almost skittish around John during the first few months of their relationship, always very hesitant. But it was good now, perfect even. John wouldn’t change a thing. He cleaned himself up, then joined Sherlock in the living room. He looked like the picture of innocence as he sat on the sofa with his damp hair stuck up at all angles, skin flushed pink, wrapped in fluffy white fabric, blue eyes drowsy. Of course Sherlock was a as far from innocent as possible, his voice raw from screaming, and some of john’s cum still inside him.
“What were you playing at today?” John barked, smacking Sherlock again.
“You’re not going back, are you?”
“That’s hardly ever the case. It’s like when you receive a yellow telegram. They could be missing, but they’re probably dead.”
“Ok. Have a good day at work, honey.” I tease, making him chortle.
“I bought a small one to start. Wouldn’t want to hurt my baby boy, now would I?”
With Sherlock actually beginning to enjoy himself, John felt as though he could finally allow himself to enjoy it too. He knew that once he did that though, it wouldn’t last very long, the vice like grip Sherlock’s body had on him being the most intense, euphoric sensation he’d ever felt.
John furrowed his eyebrows, and looked back up.
Mrs Hudson did her best to hide her grin as she placed the wailing infant in the girl’s arms.
Sherlock bucked in to johns hand, a small moan escaping him.
Sherlock smiled, and pressed her cold lips to his nose.
“John?”
I won’t go so far as hugging him, but i have grown to miss human contact over these last few weeks. That is just one item on the list of things I never thought I’d say, along with ‘stop hogging the corn nuts!’, because the food is terrible, and I’ve been reduced to a person who... eats corn nuts. After I’m searched, I go back to my dorm. There’s a guard in front of my cube, holding a book, my book.
Sherlock frowned, his lips pouty.
He stands up and pulls me flush against him.
They were quiet as they got cleaned up and after they got settled under the covers, but not because they had nothing to say, but because no words needed to be spoken.
John remained on the bed to catch his breath, his vision still fuzzy. He’d sat up by the time Sherlock came back.
“Sherl...”
“Jesus, you’re like a meerkat on speed.” Irene called as she walked over to them.
I finally push inside him, ripping a strangled moan from his throat.
John gets jealous on their date.
We all nod, and march off to our assigned posts. ‘The bubble’ is a room with a glass window from where a CO watches the inmates in their dorm. From what Rosie has said, it’s a lot of sitting down, but it’s up to you to stop any confrontation, and if anything happens, you are responsible, and only you. Before we all go our separate ways, Rosie hands me an energy bar and a crossword.
“Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.”
“You’re a life saver. I normally have help, but the nurse is on sick leave, and no one bothered to find me a replacement.” Dr Hooper says as she hands over a first aid kit.
“Good morning.”
She is not in my every day life.
“Fuuuuccck!” Sherlock howled, arching his hips off the bed.
“Oh, then yes please.”
And so was our rendezvous, hidden moments in staff bathrooms, cupboards, the bubble, wherein which we would converse on the day’s matters; our lives outside of here; John would encourage me to develop my repertory of music of the non classical variety; and we would exchange kisses ranging from gentle and sweet to heated and desperate.
“Well thank god you’re above that. Jumping out of alley ways...” John mumbled, determined not to show any signs of fear. He was used to people cornering him. Usually to tease him about his height. He felt his phone buzz. He took it out of his pocket, and saw a text from Sherlock. When did he get his phone number?
“Ummm... we could watch YouTube. Do you have a laptop?”
TRIGGER WARNING! ***attempted suicide*** PLEASE DONT READ IF THIS CHAPTER MAY AFFECT YOU.
“You were amazing.”
“Ok, baby.”
“JOHN!” He screamed when John hit his prostate at the new angle, his toes curling.
If you thought your boyfriend as burned down your flat, you’d do the same thing! 😆
“No, but Sherlock is far more likely to grill you than him.”
This was a lie.
Before I would falter, but now I find myself reaching down between us to rub my hand over his bulge.
“Ok... ok, but if I hurt you-“
“Alright. Thanks.”
When I enter the bubble, John regards me with a smug grin.
“That sounds resourceful. If there is an apocalypse, I’ll want you on my side.”
I manage to peel my eyes open, and take a quick glance at John, his face contorted in pleasure, eyes screwed shut.
“Here you go baby.”
“Mycroft’s back.” Sherlock mused, flinching when a door upstairs slammed shut.
“Mmmm... mmm!”
“Off to see Sherlock?”
“I was thinking.” His father started. “You’re starting sixth form soon, so that’ll mean more homework on weekends. So you and I can still spend time together, I thought I should move closer. That way, you can spend a few days a week with me after school.”
Sherlock held out a dvd, carefully watching for johns reaction.
18th of December 1917
John snapped his gaze back up to her eyes.
“Honestly, I’m fine. That’s just a little harder than I like to be choked.”
As I’ve come to understand, people in a relationship tell one another things about not only their day to day lives, but of the experiences they have encountered, both wonderful and tragic.
She was all too glad to be finished, and packed away the supplies quickly.
“Anyway, you ready?”
Instead she crossed the room, and flung her arms around his neck, holding him so tightly that maybe... just maybe... she wouldn’t have to let go.
When he returned to his bunk, Todd was leant you against the door with a smile.
“Alright. I’d quite like that.”
“Well...” John started.
“She’s been like that for five days.”
“Don’t suppose you’re close at all?” John grunted, his hips snapping forwards in an unsteady rhythm.
After some fumbling, John managed to unclip the garters. He pulled the panties down too, leaving Sherlock in only the socks. Perfect. John reached around for more whipped cream, and squirted another dollop on to Sherlock’s neck.
Flashback to when John and Sherlock first met.
Hopefully I will be home in time to meet them.
“John, tea or coffee?”
“Oh fuck!” John cried as the vibrations ran along his length.
25th of December 1916
I wish this wasn’t one of the ways our lives mirrored one another.
Enjoy!
“Yes- oh god yes, John-“ He pants, desperately trying to speed up again.
I look up and see Rosie leant against the door.
“This ok?”
“You said you wanted to talk to me?”
“Thursday.” Sherlock squeaked.
“I think he meant a movie night, not take him to a bar and get him hammered!” Molly exclaimed.
John had never seen him so flustered before. It was fair to say he was rather amused. Mycroft as usual didn’t buy their bullshit, and gave them a look half way between amusement and disapproval as he disappeared in to the living room with his dinner. When Sherlock sat down, John leant over to whisper in his ear.
/He’s knelt down between my legs, cat eyes hooded and sultry, his lips parted and wet.
Lucy’s face lit up when she gazed down at the baby’s wrinkly face.
I don’t want that for Sherlock.
“Fine. But tell him he has to buy me something pretty.”
“Did I actually have an eyelash... or were you just looking for an opening...?” I mumble against his lips.
John attached his lips to Sherlock’s neck, drawing the soft skin into his mouth, and leaving love bites all the way down to his shoulder.
“Hey.”
I understand the neurochemistry of kissing, of course, but the feel of John’s sumptuously agile tongue expertly delving in and out of my mouth makes my theory of kissing seem like saying ‘I’ve read a book on how to fly a plane, so now I’m going to commandeer this aircraft and fly us off to Madagascar.’
“It’s really... fucking sexy...”
John was staring down at his lap as he spoke.
I think I would have turned myself inside out in pleasure otherwise.
“Sherlock-“
“Nnngghhh!” Sherlock whined, pulling against the restraints.
“Ok.”
“I’m here. I’m here. I swear to you, I won’t leave your side.”
His head lols forwards in a pathetic excuse for a nod as he tries to calm himself.
“I... I was...” John gulped, his voice shaky. “I was walking... I was... I had my gun... and he was just there... pointing his gun at me...”
Oh, and I won’t, no I won’t, no I won’t be ashamed,’
John’s POV
The boy’s mother fell to the floor as the police officer explained what had happened.
“Why do you need an excuse.” Sherlock shrugged, used to just casually strolling in to places half an hour late without so much as a ‘sorry.’
“I... I...”
“AH- Christ!”
But he couldn’t bring himself to say it.
He nods slowly, then reaches for his temples, wincing as he does so.
“Yeah, I’ll check it out.” John said, with the full intention of internet stalking Sherlock extensively.
“Just a little something to keep you entertained.”
Hope you guys enjoy this.
I nod in acknowledgement before going back to reading my book. I’m opposed to new people, and new guards are no exception. After I finish my chapter, I walk down to the bathrooms. Bathrooms is a loose term. It’s primary usage appears to be a hookup spot. I advert my gaze when I notice one of the inmates from electrical with his head thrown back against the wall in pleasure. I’m always as quick as possible in here, this hell hole. In my haste I fail to notice the inmate in front of me. James Moriarty. No one is quite sure how he’s managed to land himself a place in minimum security. The rumours about what he did range from murder to petty theft. His... “creepy” persona is enough to make anyone uncomfortable. That’s not what bothers me though. What bothers me is his obsession with me.
Sherlock offered him a weak nod as he struggled in to an upright position.
I use one hand to steady myself in the wall whilst I grips his soft throat with the other.
Sherlock’s POV
Chocolate bourbons.
This has taken a long time, but I finally have another plot!
“What? Mycroft?”
Sherlock eyed John over his book, his brows raised.
I still can’t feel my legs. I’m still counting seven fingers on my right hand. I am however, aware of John tucking me up in a blanket, and holding me close to his chest.
I fixed the ages! Johns birthday is in February now.
“Do you not want to have this conversation?”
I keep talking to him for a moment whilst I struggle with a condom. Fucking slippery hands.
“Oh, John...” He moaned as they fell into a cubicle.
“Brought you a spot of lunch.” She called to him as she crosses the grass, tray of sandwiches in hand.
The next morning, John awoke first.
He pulls his lips between his teeth before reaching below the waistband of his trousers.
“JOHN!”
He felt the cord in his stomach tightening, tightening, tightening-
“I can tell.” Sherlock giggled before looking down in between them then back up in to johns eyes, a sultry grin on her face.
He made a series of unearthly noises as he began to work himself open, plunging his finger in and out. John gulped loudly as he sat in awe of the erotic scene before him. He drew a shaky breath as he watched Sherlock add another finger.
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart,
She just stood, and stared at him.
John practically beamed as he reached across the table for her hand.
She left out what had happened at the station, and that she hadn’t left her room since. She simply made up some nonsense, mentioned the weather and a few sports games, along with some gossip she’d overheard. She walked across her room, and hesitantly opened the door. She silently went down the stairs, and into the parkour. The three women all turned to look at her.
Sherlock shrugged as she fidgeted around on the ottoman before finally settling. After a moment, they heard a pair of footsteps and a girl entered the room.
He groaned loudly when john moved cube on the base of his throat. The irony of feeling on fire while you had ice cubes dragged across your skin was not one lost on Sherlock as he yanked his arms forwards in vain. He gasped when he felt Johns breath on the wet spot on his throat, keening in to the blond’s touch.
“Don’t be a prat. Now pass it to me.”
“Yes... why don’t you tell me how you know that?”
“I suppose I’d better go down. Come with me?”
“Yes.”
“I’d like that.”
The brunette felt his heart melting as he stared up at the golden athlete.
I reach for his slim wrists, and he’s all too eager in presenting them to me.
“I think we can agree on no talking.” She murmured, rubbing her temples.
John chewed the inside of his cheek. Sherlock rolled on to his front, and sunk in to the water, leaving only his eyes atop the water, watching John like a crocodile as he stripped himself of his soaked garments. John slowly sank in to the water in front of Sherlock before pulling the brunette in to his lap, his long, pale legs straddling his hips. John leant in, and pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s wet lips.
Thank you for the comments! Xxx
It was a small space, shelves lining the walls, packed with cleaning products. As Sherlock closed the door, he realised how close he and John were. As of now, his back was up against johns chest, and his ass was pressed in to johns groin. He slowly turned around, trying not to knock in to the toilet rolls by his right shoulder.
“Ok, that was more of a request. I would like you to come with me.”
“No, other way round.” I chuckle, earning myself a playful glare as John pushes his hips down.
He pulls away after a moment, and takes a deep breath. When I open my eyes, I’m met with his icy blue orbs.
John furrowed his brows as he realised he was right; other than the coffee shops they frequented, their time together was mainly spent just hanging out in one of their rooms.
John laughed, which in turn made sherlock laugh. Sherlock never made anyone laugh, besides Molly, and that didn’t count. People laughed at him, but never with him. John was well and truly impressed by the taller boy, but made sure not to show this on his face. The ‘incredible’ he’d blurted out earlier clearly a fail. Sherlock was chuffed to have astounded the new kid. He enjoyed the look of amazement on his face. Their teacher walked into the room a few moments later. He was a tall chap in his mid 20s. He was a nice guy, with endless patience for Sherlock’s bullshit. He knew the teen thought he was more clever than he was, and took any opportunity to prove it. More children pulled into the class room, a few girls all casting a glance to John, then giggling to each other. Sherlock was used to these sorts of glances. Many girls, not just Molly, were nursing a crush on him. Molly was just the only one who actually talked to him instead of just gawking at him from afar. Sherlock felt something a normal person would call jealousy. But Sherlock didn’t get jealous. Mr Lestrade taut them about the reactivity series, and had them do some experiments with sulphuric acid. John attempted to make small talk with Sherlock, which the later did his best to engage in. Class finally ended, the bell sounded, and all the students filtered out, except John and Sherlock. They walked together out to the school gates, then went their separate ways. John was stopped by a few other kids wanting to investigate the new boy, and a few who remembered him from before. He went to leave when a dark haired girl went up to him.
“I wasn’t caught by authorities, I was handed over to them. By my own brother no less.”
Oh god, this could all be over in a matter of seconds if he keeps touching me like this.
The smile on his face says he can hear all the things I want to tell him over the silence.
Sorry this is short, it is merely a filler for a larger plot. Enjoy, anyway!
“Alright.” She replied anxiously.
“Then why did you ask?”
Mrs Watson set up the sofa opposite them  with some help from the housekeeper.
The next day, the news article confirmed Sherlock had been right. No one was really surprised to be honest, but that didn’t mean John was any less impressed. He’d given Sherlock a discrete kiss on the way to school that morning, and another less discrete one after. John had been in a good mood right up until the moment he stepped into his living room. On the sofa, opposite his mother, was his farther. Johns father had left when he was five, And aside from the occasional holidays and weekends he was forced to spend with him, they spent very little time together.
Sherlock nodded.
“What was all the racket?”
John found himself chuckling as he shook his head.
“Goodnight, Sherlock.”
She chortles and takes another puff.
“Mmmm... sleepy.” He mumbled, nuzzling his face against johns cheek.
“It’s a literary term. It’s used when the weather reflects the emotion of the characters. Grey cloudy sky..” She said, pointing upwards with the unopened umbrella in her hand.
“That was intense.”
“Do YOU like it?” Rosie asked him.
I don’t think he’s realised that he’s gone in to hysterics.
Mrs Holmes and Sherlock out into the garden, where a blonde woman was sat in a swing seat.
As much as I love these moment, they simply remind me that that is all they are. Moments.
John had gone up to see his parents for the weekend, and normally, Sherlock would go with him, but he’d stayed behind to write a blog entry on the different types of tobacco. John was meant to be coming home tomorrow evening. That was definitely too long in Sherlock’s mind. He’d have to find some way to amuse himself...
He twitched when John added another finger and began a scissoring motion.
John reached for her hips, and pulled her in to his lap.
“Thank you so much, John. I really enjoyed myself.”
Sherlock felt a flush appear on his cheeks as he realised John was questioning his bathroom habits.
“Any chance you didn’t hear all that?”
“You do.”
Enjoy!
“Then there was You.”
He grinned when he felt the younger boy quiver against him. Without his sight, everything else was intensified. Johns breath in his ear, the satin on his wrists, the cotton bedsheets on his bare legs, the smell of arousal and sweat driving him mad.
He sucks on the bud itself and the soft skin around it, my body responding of its own accord as I find my pelvis tilting forwards.
“So, Irene, how long have you two been together?” Mrs Holmes asked with a smile.
“Pleeeaaase.” Sherlock pleaded, her blue eyes wide.
“It’s no trouble. I love spending time with her.”
“No.”
“I liked it.”
“I’d better be going.”
“But, when it comes to physical strength... you’re going on the floor... short arse.”
John couldn’t help but grin at the other boy’s bashfulness.
I can only imagine mine look the same as, with tentative fingers, I pull him out of his boxers.
‘Not good enough’
Once he’d recovered from his surprise, John thrust in again making Sherlock cry out in ecstasy.
“Here.”
“Come here.”
“Sherlock...” he moans as he drags his lips down my neck leaving my skin wet and warm.
“John, I’m tired.”
“Are you staying down stairs with John again?”
“What are you in here for?” He asks suddenly.
After a lot of questions, it had been squeezed out of Mycroft that she had met a chap at university. She’d caved after her mother’s persistent nagging, and had invited him over for tea. Of course Sherlock had guessed as soon as she came home. The smell of aftershave was unmistakable on her coat.
Sherlock felt a twinge of panic as he remembered he’d have to get John’s well endowed cock inside of him. He felt that panic change to arousal when he realised how good it was going to feel.
Mycroft let out a sigh, and ran a hand through his sandy blond fringe.
“Can you calm her down?” John asked, pointing over to his mother.
“Always been good with your mouth, haven’t you baby?” He husked, bucking his hips against Sherlock’s.
“Does that hurt?”
If only I could find him...
“I’m gonna take out a rake for you, so we actually look like we came in here for a legitimate reason.” He chuckles as he closes the door behind us.
“Huh. I didn’t think Mycroft was capable of making jokes.”
“So, What was it this time? Passed out in a motel? In the train station? A drinking buddies house?”
John.
She reached out to touch him again. He didn’t flinch this time.
I place one sock over my aching shaft, and the other I ball up in to my mouth.
“My mother’s exact words were ‘oh fabulous. We can order pizza.’ I’m not quite sure why she thinks we can’t have pizza if we don’t have guests...”
“I love you too.”
What was John playing at?
“It might do.” He said seductively. “You wanna try it?”
“You’ve got to turn it off... mmmm...” He whined.
Sherlock prepares for a massive change in her life.
The text back from John assured he would be there. There’s also an ‘x’ at the end. That was different. Sherlock felt his heart surge, the butterflies flapping again. If something as small as that had him swooning, his heart was in trouble of exploding.
“Sherlock, you’re 16 years old.” She said pointedly to the curly haired boy as he pulled himself back on to the chair.
He feels my eyes on him, and turns back to face me.
“Thank god.”
“Mhhh...” Sherlock hummed happily as John leant forwards to press their lips together while he worked a second finger inside him.
“It’s your sister’s special day, now tie your hair up.”
The only thing that matters is John.
I search his gunmetal blues, his pupils still blown wide with arousal.
I crawl up to kiss him, and I am positively surprised when he grabs my face in both hands and kisses me with a fierce passion.
I take a look around me, my eyes falling on  a door I hadn’t noticed before.l
Moly comes up with a rather unethical way to clear Sherlock’s name.
“Erin?”
John would always remember that day. He’d also remember today.
“They don’t know I wasn’t.”
Sherlock sat himself on the toilet lid, tapping his fingers on his knee as he waited. John came back a moment later carrying a chair which he set down beside the now three quarters filled bath.
“Do you want to stay over tonight?”
Oh god, why did I say that?
“Would you like a reward?”
Sherlock’s face lit up at John’s invitation.
Thursday, I don’t care about you, it’s Friday, i’m in love.’
“My John is nearly ten now. Shame you’re not closer in age.”
“Not like you then.” John mused.
Would you guys like a chapter where Sherlock loses his virginity? And should
“Your turn.” John husked as he slid his hands up Sherlock’s legs. As usual, he started of with slow, steady strokes, but Sherlock was already so hard and desperate for John to touch him that he was thrashing about and moaning in seconds.
“Sherlock, Sherlock, you gott- fuck- Gotta stop...” John panted as he grazed his entrance with the lubed up tip.
John age: 17
He reaches his arm out, and cups my cheek in his warm, calloused hand.
She quickly wiped her face with the heal of her hands, although it didn’t really make much of a difference.
He’s still sound asleep.
John glanced up at Sherlock, who was staring out in front of him looking mildly bemused.
“What did you say inmate?”
“Until you can’t stand.”
“Come on then.”
‘Oh yes, help me with this heavy thing, officer’. It’s cliche and degrading, but I knew it would work. An individual, no less a former soldier, will attempt to woo a potential partner by proving physical strength. My plan, simple as it may be, proved my theory that he is on some level attracted to me.
“Gah!” Sherlock gasped as John hit him with more force.
"And not just the sub teacher. You do it to everyone." Anderson barked.
I moan in response, my pelvis involuntarily bucking up.
“I have to ummm... go deal with this.” John trailed off awkwardly.
Sherlock felt himself hardening again as he stared down at John’s ‘impressive equipment’, beads of pre-cum leaking from the tip.
“Dirty boy.” He husked, pinching Sherlock’s ass.
“You dirty boy... I’ll have to punish you for that.” John rasped.
He quickly looks around him before crossing the library floor so he’s standing on one side of a bookcase, and I on the other.
Sherlock grinned, and nodded his head.
John felt himself pulsing in his boxers at Sherlock’s words, beads of moisture collecting at the tip.
“Have you done your homework?”
Hope you enjoy!
Mycroft knew everything.
“And yet I find myself liking you anyway.”
Mrs Holmes glowered at her daughter who shrugged in response.
“Sorry.”
Sherlock threw his head back in bliss as he let out strangled moans.
He stands still a moment, eyes running from my face to my shoes to back again.
John noticed the pause, and if Sherlock did, it didn’t register on his face.
“Don’t judge me, but I read fifty shades of grey.”
He felt his length throbbing at the thought.
Sherlock navigates his feelings towards John after losing his virginity to him.
“Take this to the post office. Please.” She held the letter out to Mycroft, who graciously took it from her.
“I will see you later then.” He smiles as he slips through the door.
“I haven’t gone down on you yet. I think we should change that.”
“Wait and see? Some plan, Doctor Watson(!)” Sherlock muttered with a roll of his eyes.
“Just fuck me already.”
It took Sherlock a moment, but once he was accustomed to the weird sensation of having johns cock in his mouth, he began to bob his head up and down. He had about two thirds of Johns cock in his mouth when he felt the tip hit the back of his throat. He moved his head back momentarily, not wanting to gag, but continued his rhythm after a short pause. It was becoming a rather pleasant experience him, his arousal spiking, his nerves tingling. He was achingly hard himself, but he wouldn’t allow that to distract him from John, who was defiantly finding this more than pleasant. He was in ecstasy, head thrown back, moans of pleasure racking his body.
“Oh, god. I can’t breath!” John wheezed, clapping his hand to his chest.
Hope you guys enjoy this!
"You looked peaceful."
I grumble to myself as I march down the corridors.
He grinned when he saw Sherlock shiver. They all turned their attention to Mr and Mrs Holmes as they came back to the table. They all thanked them for brunch, then went outside.
“That’s good?”
“Maybe we could listen to some music?”
“I’ll walk you to the door.”
“Oh. I... I suppose I’ll go home and deal with the drudgery of my parents, although compared to this place it’ll be like live at the Apollo...”
Sherlock age: 13
John smacked him without abandon, the little whimpers and moans from Sherlock sending waves of pleasure along his length.
Sherlock locked eyes with Mycroft for a moment, then looked down at the floor, his eyebrows furrowed. Was he in love with John? He knew he’d developed feelings for him, but love? Sherlock slowly rose to his feet, turned on his heal, and disappeared up stairs. The brunette collapsed on his bed, and fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow. Being sad really made one feel tired.
The lanky teen lifted his head to lock eyes with his teacher.
"Does it make you feel good? Do you get off on it?"
Sherlock turned her attention to the freshest looking wound on his shoulder.
“John?”
“What are you doing here?” She questioned in a hushed whisper as John scrabbled through the window.
All I want is to touch him again.
Hope you guys enjoy! Thanks so much for the encouragement with this story, it means a lot to me.
“I know, baby. Now, I now no one else knows you’re mine, but I can do this...”
“If you do intend to befriend him, I’d be more than happy to do homework assignments for you, or turn a blind eye when you get in trouble.”
He was panting heavily, his chest rising and falling rapidly as he used his ankles to pull John to him.
“Come here, and Fucking ruin me.”
Her noises of encouragement gave him the confidence to push his finger up inside her entrance.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, already?”
“Yes, there are left overs for you and harry in the fridge. If she can be bothered to come down here.” John said, trying to keep the edge out of his voice.
“Is that ok?”
“Alright, get out of here.” Coach Magnussen barked.
“He tried to blow up his school?”
Oh, well, it’s hot.
Sherlock smiled in to the kiss, and reached up to tangle his hands in johns hair. John responded by hoisting Sherlock up to straddle his waist. The brunette moaned softly as John gripped his hips and began to rock him back and forth. John tugged at the hem of Sherlock’s pyjama top before pulling it over his head, only parting their lips for a second.
Then she paused.
“Ahh! Mnngghhg!”
“Fuck, I don’t want to leave you.”
She grins at me before getting up to rummage through the medicine cabinet.
“Yeah, yeah. You ready?”
With that, John pressed their lips back together, and gently pushed the head of his cock past Sherlock’s ring of muscle.
Sherlock giggled as he fell into Johns lap.
“Then don’t jump out of alleyways. Talk to me in school, or friend me on social media like a normal person.”
“You sure you’re ready?”
He smiled softly at her, then looked up at the doorway where his mother had just entered.
He groaned softly, arching his hips up in to hers.
“Ah!”
Both John and I shrug.
Said boy had been staring at the wall in front of him long enough to beg questions.
What do I say? There is no instruction manual for when someone finds out about your prison affair!
“I wish nobody had to take me, as I wish I wasn’t going-“ Sherlock cut herself off when she saw her mother looking disapprovingly at her. “Yes, John I’d appreciate that greatly. Thank you.”
“Morning John.” Sherlock chirped back, seemingly up phased.
Sherlock whimpered as Johns velvety, husky voice lapped at his ear.
Yes, I know this isn’t what you guys were hoping for, but they will get togetherness soon. I cant have Sherlock being too young.
It’s uncomfortable, and I have to bite back a whine.
John’s POV
“You can tell her yourself.”
There is no way not to make this corny. I tried, I failed, I’m sorry.
“Ok. Stay here.”
John chortled as he leant forwards to taste Sherlock’s strawberry ice cream.
He stares at me for a little bit longer before taking a deep breath.
Sherlock thought he might cum then and there, but he forced himself to keep it together. He felt John moving him till he was over his lap at the edge of the bed. First, Johns hand just lightly grazed his ass cheeks. He ran his hand over the smooth skin, only applying a small amount of pressure. Sherlock willed himself to stay quiet, but a gentle smack had him groaning loudly, and sinking his nails into johns thigh. He could feel Johns hard cock pressing into his abdomen, exciting him even further.
“We did.” John drawled, pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead.
“I am.”
Sherlock goes in to labour.
Man, this got pretentious at the end. I do apologise.
“Yes.” I say finally. “It is. They spend time together, asking questions, swapping stories, finding out what they have in common.”
“Easy. That’s my boyfriend you’re talking about.”
The gift had come. It was a small gold locket. John had sent a letter to Mrs Watson to buy it at the Jewellers, and she’d brought it by in the afternoon. A few months back, John had sent a photo of him and his troupes. After swooning over John in full uniform, Sherlock had cut the photo to size, and put his photo in the locket. She hesitated for a moment before shoving the tin back under her mattress, and going down stairs. She tried to sit in the parlour, but her mother came bustling in, insisting she went outside.
“He has OCD. Always straightens it.”
Death pulled the trigger.
“Mmm... so what do you want to do?” John cooed as he wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist.
Sherlock felt her heart seize.
John followed her in to the hall, and took her arm as they walked down the stairs.
I want sex all the time.
221b Baker Street. Come at once if convenient.
“Sweep up.”
Sherlock turned to look at John, who smiled back.
“John...” Sherlock groaned, tangling his hair in johns hair.
“But I love you, and only you.”
Sherlock frowned at this. John would sit with him, wouldn’t he?
John, my sexy correctional officer.
“I do.” She said sadly, fiddling with the hem of her dress, trying not to think about the three unanswered letters she’d sent.
John felt himself threatening to burst already at the very thought.
“I’m close- oh fuck... mmnnghh- oh...”
“Yes...” He groans as he slips his hand in to my shirt.
“John, John, don’t stop.” Sherlock panted, leaning forwards to place a hot and hungry kiss on his lips.
I lean in, and pepper kisses all over his cheeks, tasting salt on my lips.
“The posh twat wanted to get pissed.” Irene chuckled as she tried to pull her leg out from underneath Rosie.
Sherlock flinched in his hypersensitive state when John stroked his stomach.
I most certainly haven’t, and I remind him of this by opening my eyes before swallowing around the head of his cock.
John stayed quiet for a moment, his eyes searching Sherlock’s.
Sherlock rubbed his nose against Johns in an Eskimo kiss.
John rolled his eyes.
A wide grin appears on johns face at my reaction.
“Gah!” Sherlock gasped.
“I can actually vouch for that, I could hear you guys when I tried to go to the bathroom.”
“Now.”
Finishing school. Also known as ‘obedience school’. Sherlock didn’t want to go for so many reasons. She didn’t want to leave John. She didn’t want to leave her house. She didn’t want to learn to walk with a book on her head. How was that helpful? She was currently trying to squash the contents of her suitcase down so she could close it.
He shook his head, mumbling words of reassurance that could either be directed at her or himself.
Every movement reminded her that there was actual life inside her, life that was half hers, half John’s.
The insides of my thighs are still wet with his cum.
Sherlock drew her lip in between her teeth as she stared down at him.
“Sherlock, I don’t want your first time to be in here.” I say finally, my voice low and cautioned.
“Brother mine, to what do I owe this pleasant call?” Mycroft’s mellifluous voice, licks over the phone, dripping with sarcasm.
He walked back down to his desk at the other end of the class room, leaving Sherlock to ponder his cryptic statement as the other children filtered in to the classroom.
“So, how comes you’ve ended up in this hell pit?” Rosie teases after a moment.
I can only offer him a smirk as anyone with half good eyesight would notice if I were to respond more affectionately.
John was still in between Sherlock’s legs knelt up at such an angle that he was resting his chest on the backs of Sherlock’s thighs, the other boy’s legs still draped over his shoulders.
“Oh, Sure. Here.”
He uses his free hand to cup my hard on through my uniform.
“I don’t know. But whatever it was, I don’t recommend it. Kept seeing penguins the first day I took it.” I wheeze out a pathetic chuckle before my knees go all wobbly, and I fall.
John attached their lips in a passionate kiss as he rubbed the bud, all the while bucking his hips in an increasingly unsteady rhythm.
John eyed the brunette over his teacup with a smirk playing at his lips. Sherlock was always innocent, and well behaved out and about, but at home, alone with John, he was naughty little slut. When the two crossed over, it was more than John could handle. If they weren’t in a public place, John would have him on the table, on the floor, against the wall, but for now, that would have to wait. The thought was exciting, thrilling.
“Yes.” He gasps against my lips, grinding his hips in to mine. “Fuck me.”
“So, Wilson and his imaginary girlfriend, Thompson and his left hand, and Watson and his fairy tale girl.”
Sherlock nodded with a shy smile.
Sherlock is a bit of a dick here. He likes John so much, and it doesn’t even occur to him John feels the same. Hense the ‘dickery’. That’s not a word...
“Oh, like that’s not weird(!)”
“Your photos aught to be back today.”
“Why’d you stop?” The brunette panted, raising her head to shoot him a glare.
“Yes. Why are you telling me the time?”
He couldn’t help but marvel at how surreal this all was. A few months ago, he was a loser who got beaten up, and called names, a freak with no friends. Then he met John. John, who changed his world. And now, he was in a janitors cupboard with his tongue down John’s throat.
“Me too.” He smiled nervously. “I forgive you.”
“Ah!” Sherlock squeaked somewhat indignantly.
Sherlock blushed, and drew his lips between his teeth. John brushed his nose against Sherlock’s nose and cheeks, breathing each other’s air. He pulled Sherlock’s t-shirt off slowly, grazing his ribs with his knuckles, making him shiver. He rejoined their lips in a passionate kiss, opening Sherlock’s mouth, and dipping his tongue in to his mouth. Sherlock made short work of Johns button down, which joined his t-shirt on the floor. John rolled Sherlock back down in to the pillows, pressing them both into the mattress.
Sherlock snickered, and hid his face in johns chest.
In hindsight, pleasuring himself with a vibrating plug and handcuffing himself to the bed was not a very good idea. The buzzing sensation was spreading through his body, tickling every nerve, his cock hard and leaking between his legs. As he sat there, he thought of john, blond hair slightly damp with sweat, beads of perspiration dotting his forehead, his cotton grey vest sticking to his chest, his camouflage jacket tied round his waist, matching trousers slung low on his hips-
“That was... incredible.”
Sherlock wanted to say more, but couldn’t find the words.
“I take it motherhood isn’t your favourite thing?”
“What?”
“Yes, alright then. Thank you.”
“No, I think I’ll make you ride me. I want your tight little ass bouncing up and down on my cock while I just lie here letting you do all the work.”
“No.”
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”
“Oh, mind your bump. Here, you sit, and I’ll pass her to you.”
The blond experimentally slipped a third finger in between the other two.
“Make a mess of me, John.”
I, on the other hand, find that “minion of the antichrist” works just fine.
‘And there's fire in you,
Both boys could have done with more sleep, but got up, and went downstairs regardless. Mrs Holmes wasn’t in the kitchen, presumably sleeping till a more reasonable hour. The tired teenagers sat down at the bar stools by the table, and rested their heads on their elbows. They were drifting off when Mrs Holmes came downstairs.
“John?” Sherlock asked anxiously.
She’d never heard John use this tone of voice before. She lead John into the parlour, sank down into a chair, and patted the one next to her. As John moved into the light, she got a proper glimpse of him. He hadn’t shaved, and the dark bags under his eyes suggested he hadn’t slept either.
“And how old are you?”
She was being pulled back to the safety of the platform, behind the yellow line, where she fell into a heap on the floor, along with whoever had saved her. It was only when she picked up in the familiar scent of the perfume that she recognised her saviour.
“I’m here... I’m here...” I murmur softly as I kiss him. “It’s perfectly normal to feel a little emotional.”
“So wet, aren’t you?” John teased as he brushed his fingers over the sensitive tip of Sherlock’s cock.
“He’s so small! Can I hold him?”
Her voice was horse, she’d been crying, possibly screaming.
“You don’t know what I did.”
“100%.”
“Yes. Let’s.”
“Oh.”
“Sorry. Didn’t mean to startle you.”
It was John who was making her feel good.
I will be home, Sherlock.
"What?"
“Hello, love.”
Hope you guys enjoy! Thanks for all the lovely comments!
“Teas on the table. I’m going to get washed.” He said, amusement faint in his voice.
“Definitely.” Sherlock breathed, his chest heaving.
“Don’t stand so close to me in future then.” He quips, narrowing his feline eyes at me.
The touch of his hands on her body made her feel euphoric, ecstatic, aroused.
Mycroft was stood behind him, a blank expression on her face.
"What the hell do you think you are doing?!" He yelled.
“Yes, well, l I’m sure he’ll be more thrilled than mother was.” Mycroft muttered as she eyed her younger sister. “Especially when you set fire to her lace doilies.”
There is no way of confessing love without being cliche!
“I like this skirt. Makes you look very sexy.”  He cooed, sliding his hand up Sherlock’s thigh. He was surprised when his hand came into contact with bare skin.
“You alright?” John asked as he wiped his mouth on the back of his hand.
“Yes, yes.”
“You’re already weeping.” John teased as he toyed with the damp fabric with his other hand. br />
“So... your middle name is Sherlock... how unusual.”
“Sherlock...” he groaned happily.
“CO Watson. Your fist assignment is the cafeteria. Go with CO Mary. She’ll look after you.”
“Oh god- oh- ah!”
“Oh john...” Sherlock whined, arching his back in to johns touch.
4. Affectionate
After a few more minutes, I finally creep out of bed and make my way across to the bubble. I knock quietly and John opens the door immediately. Eager.
I can’t take my eyes off of him as I utter words of agreement and take my arms up to his broad shoulders.
“That’s what you think.”
“I’m going on a date with John.”
We are both completely naked, for what I realise, is the first time.
Sherlock thought to himself as he made his way over to the kettle, and aggressively threw tea bags in to a pair of mugs.
Not good enough.
“Like you’re better than me! That I’m some stupid little girl, who doesn’t understand the consequences of what she’s doing. It’s bad enough when Mum does it, but it’s just patronising when you do it.”
“You’re more than welcome to come over for afternoon tea tomorrow.”
"Hello, Molly."
“Damn boy, look at those legs!”
“A little... strangling incident with another inmate.”
"I'll need a hand, but yes."
“So, What have you been up to?”
He leans in, but pauses right before our lips touch.
“My mother asked me to come by to tell you she’s going to telephone John this evening. She’d like to know if you wanted to talk to him.”
I imagine what would have happened if I’d continued to disobey John. Maybe he would have shouted at me, maybe he would have degraded me, maybe he would have dragged me away down the corridor to teach me a lesson.
It’s kind of hot.
Sherlock had remained uncharacteristically quiet throughout the conversation.
He tried to keep too much mirth out of his voice as he squeezed John’s bulge through his trousers. The blond’s eyes flew wide, and his hands curled into fists at his sides. John was only great full that Irene can back at that moment, and inadvertently distracted Mycroft and his parents.
I lock my ankles around his neck as he continues to push in to me.
I can’t. But if he gets caught, he’ll be back down there.
He should have seen this coming.
Rustling of blankets woke Sherlock from her slumber for the first time. She didn’t pay much attention, and swiftly drifted back off. The second time, she was awoken by mumbling. She opened her eyes, and saw John tossing and turning on the sofa across from her. He went quiet again, so she fell back to sleep. Barely minutes later, she woke for the third time. This time it was screaming. She jumped from her bed, and went to johns side.
“Here you go. The trousers are drawstring, so they’ll be ok. The sleeves on the top will be a bit long, but I’m sure you’ll cope.”
“I’ll wait for you.” She inhaled deeply. “I should probably get your mother and Harriet. They’ll want to say goodbye.”
Sherlock followed johns gaze down to the back of his skirt which was stained with sticky, white fluid.
“He called me a junky...” He finally offers up.
This was just great.
Unfortunately, I feel my legs start to cramp, so I’m forced to take them down from his shoulders, and instead wrap them around his waist.
“I don’t mind.”
“Nothing is good about this.”
“What do you want?”
“The water bill is going to skyrocket.” John chuckled as he swept Sherlock’s dripping fringe out of his face.
John got up from the floor, and sat beside Sherlock on the bed.
to the skin around the wound. John gritted his teeth, and balled the duvet in his fists.
“You’re right. I haven’t. I would like to though.”
John makes me feel things.
“Are you alright?”
“I’ll be there.”
“Oh, how lovely. Mrs Watson is out in the garden if you’d like to come through.”
It’s only about ten minutes until lunch, so I take my leave in to the garden.
“Of course I can.”
“Parliaments.” She grins as she takes a puff. “Mmm... so how’s Sherlock?”
“Fuck, you’re so tight! AGH!” John groaned, feeling his climax already approaching.
“So, who approached you?” Sherlock asked, his hands pressed together in front of his face.
John hummed.
John asks Sherlock to move in
“Ok, how’s Friday?”
When I pull out, what looks like a river of cum spills out of him and trickles on to the cushions. I quickly check him for bleeding. His rim is smarting and looks very sore, but he’s not bleeding.
Mrs Holmes smiled affectionately at the pair before going in to the kitchen.
John took his hands out from behind his back, showing that he was holding a small remote.
11th of November 1918
I can’t find the words to tell him that loving him is no arduous task, that in fact it is one of, if not the greatest joy that I have the fortune of knowing. Then I realise, I don’t need the words.
The next morning, everything hurt.
“Please, John- ah...”
I feel my previously dormant cock start to stir between my legs, awoken by not only that thought, but also the sensuous feeling of johns lips on my skin.
(See the end of the chapter for
He couldn’t help but blush like a fool.
“That is broaching so many rules... laws... all because you couldn’t keep it ‘in your pants’. I must say, of all the things I thought I’d have to tidy up under the rug, a passionate prison affair was not one of them.”
“Do you want pizza for dinner?”
“John-“
"I think you should go home, kid."
“Sherlock, I was thinking of taking Lucy down to the post office to have her photos done so I can send them to Greg. Would you like to post a thank you letter to John?” Mycorft asked as she made her way over to Sherlock.
“Oh bloody hell. Sherlock your little friend is here.”
John chuckled.
“Sherlock.”
Sherlock was both eager and nervous as she began to slowly pull down his briefs.
Enjoy! Also, help. I have no idea what to write next! 😆
“I’m kind of busy, but I’ll make it up to you, I promise.”
John begins to break.
It was a spacious tub, big enough for both of them to sit quite comfortably when the occasion called for it, and just long enough for Sherlock to stretch out his legs.
“Would you like some sandwiches?”
I feel my heart thump in my chest as we gaze at each other. Call it cheesy, call it cliche, but I feel myself falling in love with him even more with every passing second.
He takes my other hand, and sucks my middle finger in to his pretty little mouth.
“John- ah!”
“Yes. I do wish she’d shut up sometimes though. Talks about nothing all the time.” Sherlock muttered, rolling his eyes.
“Sorry. Had to ask. Wait a second, have you been planning for this?” John asked with a fiendish grin.
“Right then, promise you will do your best to stay out of trouble.” I say with mock authority.
“Yes. Please.” Sherlock moaned against his lips.
“Ooohhh...” I moan loudly when I feel his hot, wet tongue swipe across my slit.
“What you up to tonight?”
With that, the line goes dead.
“The tooth fairy isn’t real, John. Don’t be ridiculous.”
She swallowed as she felt the baby kicking about.
Sherlock prepares to say goodbye to John yet again.
“Let her have her space. We can apologise to her when she’s ready.”
I chuckle.
Molly came back into the room a few minutes later in a dressing gown with a towel wrapped round her head.
“Do you want to go to the park after school?”
“The water has gone really cold.”
Sherlock looked up at John who gestured to the basket of soft fruits.
“I want to live with you. I want to sleep in your arms every night.”
“Fucking hell, baby that was so hot.”
“You could say that.” I murmur nonchalantly.
“Light?”
John presented his spoon to Sherlock.
“I... ahh- oh fuck!”
I can feel tears in my eyes, my throat, threatening to spill over, but none run on to my cheeks, and no sound falls from my lips.
“Shit, did I hurt you?”
“I know what I’m doing! Shh... no, Hey!”
“Well, this is comfortable(!)”
“No sir.”
‘Not good enough’
Sherlock shuddered, his eyes closing momentarily.
Sherlock still hadn't come downstairs, and Mycroft and Mrs Holmes had begun to get extremely worried. Mrs Homes had telephoned Doctor, who was currently in their parlour.
I pull him in to my lap, and hold him close to my chest as he cries.
John couldn’t help but marvel at the odd sensation that enveloped his over stimulated cock as Sherlock giggled around him.
He follows my gaze to the discarded item on the floor.
The police officer was in his late thirties, with a crooked smile, beady eyes, and was clearly a dickhead.
“Shit.” Sherlock giggled breathlessly from underneath John, his cheek pressed in to the mattress.
“Hey!” He shrieked in surprise.
Sherlock appears from the kitchen folding yet another frog.
“Well, I hope you’re being safe.”
Sherlock went to decline, but Mrs Watson all but forced the £10 note in to his hand.
“Morning.”
My cerulean orbs lock with his gunmetal blues, a devious glint undeniable within their depths.
Sherlock felt her heart pounding in her chest as she looked in to his eyes.
“You can try mine though. Mine’s not a mix of coco and toothpaste.”
“Yes, yes, oh john- Yes, Yes, right there! YES, YES! YES! Aaaaggghhhh!”
“What happened?” She asked, sitting back on her heels.
There was no response for a moment, then they heard the girl shouting again.
I chew my lips between my teeth, and roll my eyes at him.
“That’s none of your business.” I chide with a snap of my hips.
“Keep your eyes on the film.”
“Oh, that cool. You’ll have to play me a tune sometime.” John grinned at her, little dimples in his cheeks appearing.
“No. He just gives me the creeps.”
Mrs Holmes breezed in to the conservatory with a squeeze to Mycroft shoulder.
John was in complete bliss, waves upon waves of pleasure hitting him with every thrust. He only wished Sherlock was enjoying it as much. As it went on, he continuously asked her if she was ok, and each question was meant with a firm, positive answer.
“What?”
“You could always go and stay with Mycroft, vanilla pod.”
John chuckled much to Mycroft’s dismay.
When his vision returned to him, he could see John sat in front of him, restraint key in hand. He felt a rush of adrenaline as his gaze landed on what was binding his wrists together. Black, leather handcuffs. Handcuffs were his favourite, closely followed by blindfolds. Both at the same time was pure heaven. He loved being tortured, completely at John’s mercy.
He tilts his head to the side in an adorable manner, not unlike the way a dog does when trying to understand what you’re saying.
That was the day I got arrested. It was a rather tedious day to be honest, as were the days that followed. It’s worse than tedious now, mind numbingly boring to be more accurate. Is it weird to find prison boring? Yes, probably. The only thing that amuses me is deducing what other people are in her for. It’s intimidating as well, of course. My first night, I’m pretty sure my roommate watched me sleep. Within a week, I’d been given a black eye for being insubordinate to one of the ‘top dogs’. I’ve been threatened, pinned against a wall, called a selection of colourful insults, and been thwacked in the ribs with a very heavy book. My counsellor says I bring it on myself.
“Ooo, Sherlock.” Wilson smirked.
Sherlock took the distraught child from Mycroft, and nestled her against her chest.
John smirked, and leant in towards his ear.
“Yep. It can get crazy on visitation day. Saying that, you might get put in the bubble, and miss all the action.”
That was the final straw. His eyes rolled in to the back of his head, all his muscles tensing as he reached his orgasm.
Sherlock’s back arched off the bed, his eyes still squeezed shut.
“Sorry.”
I don’t think I’ve ever cum as hard as I did last night.
A blush creeps on to my cheeks as the memories of what we did rise to the surface.
Sherlock blushed, and looked away.
“I’m leaving tomorrow. My train is at 08:00. I don’t know if- when I’ll be home.”
“He’s cheating with that substitute who teaches biology. What they’re up to definitely isn’t on the curriculum!” She squealed.
“I know.”
“You have some?”
Moriarty escaped.
“Honestly, I was waiting for them to shoot me during that god awful matinee of Les Miserables. If I have to listen to one more reprise of the same bloody tune with different lyrics...” He grumbled as he stalked round the house, his rich blue dressing gown twisting about in his wake.
“Hey.”
‘More, more, more’, Was all her brain told her as she rocked.
I am urged to remember a stunt my brother pulled where he used surveillance technology to track my every move after I left the lab I had been using.
“What’s that on your neck, darling?”
Sherlock began to bob his head slowly. After a moment, he hollowed his cheeks, and took about three quarters into his mouth. Normally he’d resort to his hands here, but that wasn’t really an option now. He swirled his tongue around the head, tracing the muscle along the slit, gently grazing the sensitive skin with his teeth.
“That’s better.”
Double chapter here. Enjoy!
“And you had to take matters in to your own hands?”
“Bloody hell...” she growled as the pain extended through her body. “Why aren’t you home?!”
John paused for a moment, before blurting our his next sentence.
John finally released him, and allowed him to go downstairs.
Sherlock swung the door shut with enough vigour to kick Mycroft out of the way with a yelp.
I march the few steps between us, and slam him up against the wall. He lets out a small gasp against my lips, but quickly reciprocates the kiss.
Suddenly, the pressure on my windpipe is released and I can breathe again. I collapse against the bookcase, my head spinning, my chest heaving as my body takes in all the oxygen it can. Once my eyes open again, I see a flash of blue and khaki.
I add another finger after a moment, and he lets out a whine.
“Shit, ok.”
I can’t believe someone loves me because they want to, and not just because they have to.
“Baby, look at me.”
Oh god. This was going to happen.
“Oh, Yeah, Yeah of course.” I ramble quickly, stupidly.
“I’m so glad he has someone like you to love him.”
John finally speaks again.
“What?”
“It’s umm... just below my knee.”
“He never talks to me anymore about his feelings. I never know what’s going on with him. Both my children shut me out.” She’d started crying again, quite mewls escaping her.
“Bit not good.”
Fucking hell, there’s like a thousand better ways to say that.
“Then that’s all that matters. Now go try something else!” Irene cheered.
“Next time you wear it, I want you on all fours.”
“Well, well, well. Did someone need a little  extra discipline?” She chortles as her reptilian like eyes scan the scene before her.
“If you don’t mind.” Sherlock furrowed her brows at John’s manner, but didn’t pay it much attention.
“Because,” She placed her hand on her daughters arm. “It means you haven’t given up on him.”
Fucking hell.
“How’s the tea?” Sherlock questioned as he settled on the armrest of the sofa, slowly dropping the dressing gown off his shoulders and on to the floor.
The elder looked up when her sister’s presence was made known by her slightly heavier than usual footsteps.
“So, would you be willing to do that again?”
One of the last letters she’d revived from John was his list of names.
Sherlock halted again and pouted at John who stuck his tongue out in response.
“Must do something about your hair. Martha, could you sought her out? Maybe put her in a nice frock?” Mrs Holmes said, her eyes drawn to her daughter’s curls which had already sprung up again.
John ignored his left hand as it spasmed.
“Oh shut up.” He mumbled as he slipped back in to his room to grab a T-shirt.
“What’s this got to do with us?” John asks.
"What are you here for then."
“I want you inside me, John.”
As much as I hate to say it, as much as he hates to hear it; we don’t have time.
Sherlock blushed when John kissed his cheek.
“That’s mine.” John remarks as he slips in to his jeans.
“Very much so.”
“He’s upstairs. I’ll bring you both some snacks in a little bit.”
I look down between us and back up at him.
“How’s that?” John panted against his lips.
5th of July 1917
“Fine. But you have to buy me something pretty.”
“Afternoon.”
Sherlock hastily pushed himself up the bed, then waited patiently for John to cuff him to the headboard.
With some amount of difficulty, John managed to turn the vibrator off, and pull it out with a small whimper.
Sherlock looks rather pleased as I toss the packet aside and crawl back in between his legs.
“John?”
“Yes... Yes, it’s- mmm... I won’t lie, it’s weird.”
As his dressing gown hid what he was wearing underneath, he looked exactly the same as earlier, and John failed to look up.
“John Watson.” He repeats to himself. “Former soldier.”
“Hey, you ok?”
“Alright. I bet the last place I had sex was more interesting.”
“You’ve been a very naughty boy. Teasing me like that.” He rumbled against Sherlock’s ear.
Sherlock asked, not sure whether he should drop the subject or not.
She just stood there, frozen, staring at him. This was a man who’d seen the hardships of war. Her breath hitched when he spoke.
“Fucking hell John! Was that... was that my prostate?”
All of my worries went away the first morning I woke up with him in my arms. He was still sound asleep, soft little noises escaping him on every exhale.
Mrs Hudson quirked an eyebrow, seemingly not believing him.
It was the first time he saw a man die.
“I will however, ask for a favour in return for my silence.”
She felt every nerve in her body singing as their tongues danced together.
“Don’t worry about it, baby.”
He looks positively ashamed of himself as he speaks, his eyes refusing to meet mine.
“I’m in here because of you.”
“You already have. Sit down.”
The Holmes manor was a large one, so there were plenty of rooms to be done up as a nursery, but Sherlock had insisted on keeping the baby in her room, so instead, a few necessities, a cot, a changing table, etc, had been moved in to her sizeable bedroom.
“I can’t bare to hear him cry like that.” Mrs Watson had tears in her eyes as she spoke.
“No, of course not.”
“Is that not what matters?”
“Well, you said to ask questions, swap stories, and find out what we have in common. I have microwaved a banana, and I wanted to see if you had too. All three in one go.” He explains proudly.
Sherlock and John find themselves in the familiar situation of saying goodbye to one another.
Sherlock’s body slumped forwards, his dark locks hanging over his eyes as he tried to steady his breath.
“Sticky.” Sherlock grimaced after a moment.
I slowly open it.
“Where’s Harry?”
John shot his load with a loud moan, his vision going white.
John’s POV
Lucy meets her new cousin
We haven’t had a moment alone since I came back. Well, not one that didn’t comprise of me crying and throwing up in to a bucket.
“Sherlock, breathe.”
Sherlock age: 15
“Shit!” John said suddenly.
“That’s rough.”
Sherlock was too busy enjoying the notion that John talked about him to notice the two bickering siblings. As much as he adored John, this argument was very dull, and normal, unlike the arguments he and Mycroft had. Those were usually in debate on whether or not Mycroft was hypnotising their parents to like him better, or hacking into the CIA. Sherlock maintained that he was.
He groans out my name as he shoots his load all over his stomach, coating his creamy white flesh in his release.
“So tired.”
She enters the room with a nervous disposition and closes the door behind her.
“Yes, I know.”
“Told you.” Sherlock grinned.
Sherlock shivered, his cheeks flushing.
John whispers as we make our way across the field.
“You are?”
“Nnngghh! Agh John!”
And just like that, the bubble is burst.
“What are you going all ‘gooey eyed for’?”
Sherlock bit her lip to stop herself from bursting in to tears.
“Oh!”
“I know you do.” Sherlock cooed, swiping his tongue along the shell of Johns ear.
He is right to a point, that all matters, but so much more does too, but he isn’t to know.
“Anything besides the usual?”
He stroked John one more time before the athlete gripped both his hands, and pinned his wrists to the walls.
“Am I really loud when we have sex?”
“What makes you think I was caught?”
Sherlock winked at his reflection, then went into the living space.
He looked so bashful as he searched johns eyes.
“Oh god...”
Sherlock glared playfully at him before rolling over, and sluggishly dragging himself off the bed.
“Your blood pressure is a little high. Now, just breathe normally.”
There is nothing between us now.
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have. I have to go.”
“If I’m not I’ll tell you...” He remarks with a roll of his hips.
Sherlock exhaled a shaky breath.
He didn’t seem displeased to see her, more surprised.
“No, sorry.”
“You’re very creative this time of the morning, aren’t you?”
“What do people normally say?”
“You’re gonna need to take your pants off then.” John chuckled as he trailed his fingers down Sherlock’s body.
“Dad is going to go ballistic when we go home, in fact he might even call you first in a fit... and ummm... i’m the reason why.”
John obliged, and sat down to allow Sherlock to curl up on his chest, and drink his milk. Johns theory of why Sherlock seemingly turned into an infant was because his brain was constantly whirling, never stopping for a moment, that when he was drunk, his brain went back to very basic functions. In short, his brain took a break.
Just because Sherlock isn’t attune to human nature, doesn’t mean he doesn’t know how to play hard to get.
I can almost feel him tensing on the other side of the relatively spacious cupboard.
“Well then, brother mine. How are you faring?”
“Mmm?” I force myself to look away, and turn to face Rosie.
Harriet moved to crouch down beside her.
Sherlock blushed.
Sherlock tried his best to frown, but ended up giggling. “Have a good game.”
With this thought, I wander down the corridor to find him.
“Oh- oh- oh!” Sherlock started, digging her nails in to his biceps.
Sherlock learns to comfort John.
John tugged his lips up in to a smile, and looked deep into Sherlock’s bright blue eyes.
Sherlock eventually managed to get his body to follow his head, turning completely in Johns arms, and capturing his face in his hands. When their lips connected, it was hot, and passionate. John could feel that Sherlock was also getting turned on, his erection pressing in to his hip. They were flushed together, breathing each other’s air when they pulled away from the kiss. John was pressed up against the wall, holding Sherlock to him by his hips.
“Shit...”
I have to bite my lip to resist from reminding him that he’s on duty.
Sherlock wandered around the room, picking up papers and clothes from the floor, and chucking them into a corner.
“You stole your neighbours’ turtles?”
"Umm, yes thanks. Sherlock, What are you doing?" John asked when he noticed the brunette jump up, and run into the living room.
“I’m not distracting you, am I?”
“Hello.”
The older of the two smirked at the look on the other’s face.
He continued his ministrations, working his fingers in and out.
John moved his hands down to the hem of Sherlock’s soft cotton t-shirt, and pulled it up, revealing panes of soft, porcelain skin.
Sherlock grinned in anticipation.
He thrusts his tongue in to my mouth, and fights mine for dominance, each velvety stroke eliciting sparks of pleasure.
“Yes, darling she is. Would you like to talk to her?”
Sherlock wasn’t sure what it was, but he found he felt sad at being called johns friend, but that’s what he was. That’s all he’d ever be. Sherlock cleared his thoughts, and focused on the matter at hand.
“As if that would be believable.” I chide.
Now that she’d held him, she felt as though she couldn’t hide away.
“Hold still a second.”
“Don’t be such a pedant!”
“Wait.” John called.
“Hey.”
“John...” She moaned softly as he pushed his hips to hers, pressing her in to the wall.
Its not weird, it’s not overwhelming as I thought it would be.
“Yeah, defiantly. Thanks.” John was peering over at Sherlock.
“Like a little angel. I suppose I’ll need a guardian angel to watch over me.”
Sherlock giggled and blushed as John pulled him into his lap, the blush deepening when he felt Johns hardness rubbing against him. He moaned happily when the blond connected their lips, and cupped his face. He didn’t notice when his towel fell off, leaving him completely exposed.
“Does that really matter?” Sherlock asked incredulously.
She smiled weakly at him, sniffling a little.
“Alright babe, I’m off. Enjoy your homework whilst I’m gone.”
“I believe you’re right about that. Want to try and catch a movie or something this evening?”
Sherlock whipped his head round to see a girl standing at the end of the aisle, clearly staring at his outfit.
“Hey!” Sherlock giggled, thumping johns chest.
He’s quiet for a little too long for my liking, so my instincts tell me the best way to deal with this is to continue rambling.
and afraid.’
I can’t blame him.
“I just meant that you’re not going to ditch me for some girl. Or boy. I don’t really have any other friends.”
“Fill me with your cum! Fuck!”
Sherlock is beside me.
“A soldier fights for his king.
“Oh john...”
“Oh!” The brunette yelped when he felt John take his throbbing cock into his warm, wet mouth. “Oh John... mmm!”
He paused for a moment before running his hands down her body to where her slip was tucked into her skirt. He slowly pulled it off, revealing her milky skin inch by inch. He couldn’t help himself from staring at her newly revealed breasts. They were of ample size, round and pale, tempting, with dusty rose coloured nipples on the top. He licked his lips subconsciously as he sat there, mesmerised.
A sudden buzzing comes from John’s radio, effectively ending our moment.
“Ok, go on then.”
John brought his lips down to Sherlock’s neck, and gently bit at the skin.
“Hello, Sherlock.”
Me: I almost enjoy going away for the sake of these sweet messages.
Hearing him say this lights some sort of fire within me, a fire that grows to an intense, burning inferno that powers me to continue. I jerk my wrist faster and faster till it’s aching, twinging, but all of that is overlooked by the most wondrous, salacious noises that fall from John’s lips.
“Watch yourself- oh. It’s you.”
Sherlock mumbled something unintelligible into mycroft’s chest.
“Just breathe it in.”
“Mycroft is calling you.”
“I should probably get a condom.” John noted before things could escalate further.
“Come in, I know you want to. You want to fuck me so hard. Make me your bitch.”
I don’t tell him with sentences, but I’m certain he knows this by my moans and the claw marks I am almost certainly leaving on his shoulders.
He scrunches his brows; confusion, one of the easiest expressions to read. Perhaps it’s that, or maybe I have just witnessed it more due to the number of individuals I have rendered baffled. Having said that, I have been informed that I rub people up the wrong way all the time, and the look of ‘extremely pissed off’ is still one that is lost on me.
“Yes?” He asked cautiously.
“Ooo, gingernuts!” Sherlock squealed, making a beeline for the plate of golden treats.
"Shall I check your... torso?" He asked slowly, trying to remember the word Sherlock had used.
"Where did that one come from?"
“Greg. And yeah, I should probably get going.”
“And that makes it ok?”
Sherlocks cock throbbed against johns leg, leaking unapologetically.
“Sherlock, forgive me if I’m wrong, but it sounds to me as if you’re in love with him.”
“Holmes, medical. Nothing to worry about, just a routine vaccination.” I clarify for him when he gives me a weird look.
“You know...” John cooed in Sherlock’s ear. “We’re going to have to do this again sometime.”
“Green!” Sherlock gasped as he stared at the black, leather whip.
“Where...”
“One miracle for me, John, please.”
John was taken back by this, and hesitated for a moment before answering.
“Obviously.” Sherlock stated, his lack of interest becoming apparent.
JOHN’S POV
She smiles warmly at me before exiting the room. I follow her a few paces behind down to the warden’s office.
She reached out to touch his arm, but he flinched with a yelp.
Sherlock hung up, and disregarded his phone on the table.
“Johnathan. Johnny for short.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John has been hoping she’d speak, but now that she had, he missed the silence.
“Are you Alright?”
“Is it ok for me to continue?” He husked.
"No problem. Sherlock, come eat please."
“And your leg. That’s where you were shot.” She said, again, not asking.
“I’m sorry?” John asked, surprised.
“Get your legs open. That’s a good boy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry- I- oh fuck!”
John didn’t give her time to answer before he’d marched himself out of the room.
He smiled against johns lips as they engaged in a passionate kiss. He gasped when John pulled him up to straddle his lap, pulling him as close as he could. Sherlock supported his weight on his knees as he leant forwards to catch Johns lips in another kiss. When he sat back, he could feel John’s hardening member beneath him. He couldn’t help but grin when he heard John’s breath hitch. He began experimenting rolling his hips forwards, rubbing against johns erection with every move, causing maddening friction from his jeans against his hole.
