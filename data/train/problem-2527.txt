“Probably,” John says with a shrug. He gives Sherlock a small smile. “I hope I’ll find out one of these days.”
1 lemon
The first time John verbally eviscerated Sherlock for the contents of their fridge - “Toes, Sherlock, seriously! Toes! Just lying there, between the carrots! I nearly bit into one, for fuck’s sake!” - Sherlock was hard pressed not to cry with the sheer, utter, beautiful happiness of a piece of his life he thought he’d lost forever snapping back into place.
Apprehensive without exactly knowing why, John follows Sherlock closer to the stones, carefully stepping over smaller stones and boulders that seem to have melted into the earth. “How old do you think this is?”
John gets up and prepares a bottle with as little conscious thought as he gave the tea. He goes after Mary into Rosie’s room and catches Mary unbuttoning her shirt, as if she’s were ready to breast-feed Rosie. “Don’t,” he says before he can think better of it. “I just got her used to the bottle, I’ve got no intention of going through that again the next time you…” he stops himself just in time, but he can see that Mary understood him perfectly.
“You’re back early,” Sherlock says without turning around. There’s something in his voice John can’t quite place. Tiredness, yes, but something else, too. Boredom? Loneliness? All three?
John nods, confused.
“Can we stick to the baking please?”
“I hope you’re right,” John says, the worry lines still between his eyes.
He busies himself with packing up his camera when Irene walks over to his side. “Well, you win some, you lose some.”
He doesn’t.
“You know what my favourite cake is?” Molly asks, and she sounds like she’s a bit embarrassed to admit it.
John turns around to face Mycroft. “You really want to have this conversation now? In the middle of the bloody night after I was almost burned alive?”
Generally speaking, emergency meetings at the manager’s office first thing aren’t especially encouraging signs. Two weeks to press night, you just know it’s going to be bad. So John is unsurprised to see glum faces when he walks into Mrs Hudson’s office on Monday.
He’s sipping on a cup of tea, checking his emails and waiting for the others to come in, enjoying the moment of quiet so rare in theatre. The stage is in disarray, and the auditorium isn’t much better, half the seats have headlights and spots and other lighting equipment on them, but he knows that by Friday, all this chaos will have resolved itself, and when the audience comes in next Saturday, everything will be perfect. At least as far as the audience can see.
John nods and sits down at the table. “Yes, Mrs Hudson. Thank you for suggesting it.”
“They like you,” Sherlock points out.
It’s the first week of December and London is a foggy nightmare lit by garish Christmas decorations. Tinny speakers blare poppy versions of Christmas carols, and Sherlock is awfully close to snapping at the next person wishing him happy holidays a full three weeks before Christmas.
“Gents? I don’t want to have to call security.”
Sherlock has no idea what to say to that, because he’s been on the other end of what John is describing, he’s been the addict who drove every member of his family to this exact weary exhaustion. He can’t honestly give John any comfort, because he knows how hollow any words would be. So he tightens his arms around John and cards his fingers through his hair and stays silent.
With a herculean effort, Sherlock draws back, rests their foreheads together, and they both just breathe for a while. Sherlock’s hands are still resting on John’s hips, and John’s fingers are still gently brushing over Sherlock’s back, his arms, his sides. It feels insanely good.
Silence descends in the tent. Moriarty looks around, and apparently only now becomes aware of the cameras that are still rolling and the crew standing around with looks on their faces that range from bored to annoyed to outright hostile. Molly is glaring daggers at him, while John is apparently trying to hide his amusement. Sherlock tries to keep his own mix of boredom and annoyance off his face, and just stares back at Moriarty when his eyes are drawn to Sherlock.
But then she starts vomiting, and he knows the worst is past, he can put her to bed now and she’ll sleep.
But a part of him wants nothing more than to get into a cab and go to Baker Street and see Sherlock Holmes sitting in his chair, waiting for him to sit in his. He wants to make them tea, and bicker about milk; he wants to scour the paper while Sherlock plays the violin; he wants cases and adventure and pointless danger and all the stupid, silly, unimportant things they used to argue about.
"I know, I autopsied Kitty Winters."
Sherlock swallows against an unnameable emotion clogging up his throat. “I want ...” he mutters into John’s hair. “I want you to ride me. And I want you to kiss me while you do it.”
“He just ran off mid-scene? Was it to be sick? I had this colleague once who ran off to throw up into the fire bucket, then he walked back on and finished the scene,” Irene interrupts.
He sinks down to his knees between John’s thighs and leans down to mouth at John’s cock through his clothes. John makes an absolutely divine sound, something between a moan and a growl. John’s fingers wind in Sherlock’s hair, and John pushes his hips up to meet Sherlock’s teasing exploration. “Oh god yes,” he moans, and Sherlock grins.
John wakes up when Mary walks into the green room where he slept - again, he needs to stop doing that - and drops her wedding binder onto the coffee table with unnecessary force. “Fucking wedding and fucking flowers and fucking dresses and fucking place settings. I don’t fucking care where my fucking Aunt Louise sits, and I doubly don’t fucking care where Janine’s posh work friends sit, the fucking gits.”
And the nice thing is, Sherlock honestly can’t answer that question.
It’s not a feeling he’s especially used to. His normal restless energy seems to have expended itself last night, leaving an odd sort of stillness in its wake.
“Our showstopper challenge today: Hidden design cakes.”

John shrugs. “It’s difficult to explain…” He looks away from Sherlock, down at the mossy ground down by the river bed, at lights going on behind the windows of the city, at the slowly darkening sky. “I… it’s not the war. I’m not afraid to fight.” He huffs a little laugh, then corrects himself, “Okay, actually, I’m a lot afraid, but that’s not it. I’m proud to serve my King and my country. It’s…” he sighs and runs a hand through his hair in frustration. “If I survive, and that’s a big if... “ he swallows. “I’ll never be a doctor.”
He throws his stone. It skips over the lake in beautiful arches, dipping in and creating little shock waves that ripple out over the still water. Eight.
Mary looks after Sherlock quizzically, then shrugs. “Anyway, we-”
“Not nearly enough, dear,” she says, winking at him.
John appears by his side and hands him coffee and a scone. He hands over his key to the receptionist and nods at Sherlock. “Ready?”
Sherlock nudges him with a shoulder. “Maybe it’s time to start.”
“Thousands of years, surely,” Sherlock answers.
Anything not to think of the day ahead he will be spending watching Sherlock Holmes at work.
When Sherlock asks, Mycroft says, “Oh, yes, right. Last I heard he was in Yemen. I must check whether he’s still there.”
“Hate is a strong word.” John winds his fingers into Sherlock’s hair and nudges his head up to meet his eyes. “How did you know?”
Sherlock notes that Moriarty is nowhere to be seen. Sherlock is deleting ten comments a day calling him a fraud and a shill for the BBC, some even going so far to surmise that he’s an actor just playing a baker, hired by the BBC. He’s noticed that John’s blog has had a few of those, too, but most of the vitriol has so far been directed at either him or the Bake Off social media accounts themselves, and Sherlock couldn't care less about random people on the internet yelling at him on YouTube. It’s ratcheted up his views, so if anything his channel is now even more popular than before.
He ignores Mycroft and stumbles out of the nondescript government building.
“Ask him,” Janine says, and it’s only after Neela has wailed his name and repeated the question that he realises Janine was referring to him.
Nightmare
“Please,” Sherlock says, putting as much weight into the word as he possibly can.
They get out of the car, and Sherlock takes a moment to help John straighten his suit, and drags his fingers through John’s hair to make him more presentable. John’s eyes darken with promise as Sherlock runs his fingers through John’s hair, and John pulls him in for a kiss, deep and dirty and hungry.
But Sherlock...clearly, Sherlock has a family he misses and a future he was counting on. And an unsolvable puzzle.
about your son’s disappearance. And what’s more, I know how to get him back.”
John runs a hand through his filthy hair and breathes out heavily. “Look, we’re stranded here. We can’t get home, and nobody is helping us. Everybody says it’s impossible. Do you know how we could get home?”
“Thanks, Mary,” John says with a smile, and Sherlock walks out of the room with his sandwich and a cup of tea, a complicated knot of emotions in his stomach.
John feels his heart contract as he admits to himself how much he wants that, and how sick he is of going home to an empty flat that’s nothing but six years of accumulated silence and a few fleeting affairs with both men and women who were mainly remarkable in how little they were anything like Sherlock.
“Are you sure?” Mycroft asks, scrutinising him carefully.
John seems to have read some of this off his face, because he drops his eyes to his hands and smiles a little sadly. “I should go, I haven’t been home in three days, and I can’t steal your clothes forever.”
If he continues to make good content, he can translate the surge in popularity into the increase in revenue he needs without having to go through another tedious weekend. He posted a new video today in response to the surge, about how not to use a KitchenAid, and he already has more hits and comments in a few hours than he normally gets on videos in weeks.
“Sorry. I hope I can stay, but at this point, nothing is certain.”

John shakes his head. “No. Thank you. I’ll just…” he gestures vaguely at the door.
There’s a jack-o’-lantern sitting on the back of the sofa.
“It’s a hospital, see the red cross shape on the wafer?”
“So,” John says, quietly, his breath ghosting against Sherlock’s sweat-damp skin. “That happened. Again.” He sounds equally amused and confused.
“You should join in as well, Sherlock, a little exercise wouldn’t hurt you,” Mrs Hudson says, handing Sherlock a bowl of stew, who takes it without looking, his attention still on the paper.
Molly and John are both examining the body, trying to determine time and cause of death, while Sherlock is pacing, rubbing the crystal fragment between his fingers.
The scones are an equal success. “You made your own jam, as well, I hear?” Lestrade says, and Sherlock nods.
“I’m not asking you to
Sherlock’s bedroom is oddly bare, but John doesn’t care, he starts unbuttoning Sherlock’s shirt while trying not to break the kiss, and Sherlock does the same to him. Their hands tangle, and they get in each other's way, and it would be faster to just do it themselves, but it doesn’t matter, and Sherlock’s hands on John’s belt buckle are the hottest thing ever.
John laughs against Sherlock’s lips, and Sherlock can feel the vibrations of John’s laugh in his own body. It’s incredibly arousing, and Sherlock kisses John back with renewed vigour, letting his hands roam all over John’s body.
He looks around briefly. Most bakers are either passing the time by looking at their phones or have gone to the catering tent for a cup of tea. The camera crew is filming outside with the judges, and nobody is paying them the least attention. So Sherlock beckons John over with a crook of his finger.
“Oi! Watson! Over here!” A few other boys have gathered around Mike and are waving him over. They look nice, friendly. Sherlock, on the other hand, doesn’t even look up.
John has no words. His brain is still caught between the edge of a panic attack and utter bewilderment that Sherlock kissed him.
When they finally calm down, they’re half-leaning against each other, and John can feel Sherlock’s voice more than hear it when he says, “What now?”
“... he just walked away.”
John hesitates for a second, then he parts his lips and kisses Sherlock back. John tastes of scones and tea and melted butter. One of his hands winds into the hair on the back of Sherlock’s neck, the other is gripping at his waist, teasing at the drawstrings of his pyjama pants. It’s insanely arousing and Sherlock grinds his hips into John’s instinctively.
It’s slowly getting dark, and still nothing is happening, and Sherlock is getting restless.
Except, apparently, for the top of his ears.
“This is me,” Sherlock says, feeling slightly nervous. “You want to come up?”
Now for some family history: John’s gran is based very loosely on my great-aunt, who went to England in the mid-thirties to work there as a maid for a rich family on their country estate (think Downton Abbey). When the war broke out, she returned to Austria, because the British government wanted to put her into a detention camp for Axis power citizens. The entire family was like, ‘Are you crazy? You're coming BACK to Nazi-occupied Austria?’ and agreed that she should have stayed where she was, and who knows what would have happened if she had. Maybe she would have met a handsome, charming Scot in London, and maybe she would’ve opened a bakery that leaned heavily into her Viennese heritage. Who knows…

The nurse checks the chart. “You John Watson? She said to tell you,” he reads from a piece of paper, “concussion, sprained ankle, it’s her own damned fault for getting up that ladder with Mike in the condition he was in, and you still need to fix the downstage left moving light?”
“You know, I was sceptical about you prioritising showiness over taste, but that is one good cake,” Sally says.
He gets out the lube and condoms and makes short work of getting rid of the rest of their clothing and preparing himself and Sherlock, all the while trying not to look at Sherlock, who’s staring at him with naked hunger. Finally he can’t wait anymore. He straddles Sherlock, who’s immediately running his hands up and down John’s thighs, his chest, his face, and John holds Sherlock’s erection steady and sinks down, slowly, bracing himself against Sherlock’s chest.
cake 12 hours after he said the exact opposite, and that it’s a bit not good.
“Not as bad as it could be.”
Sherlock hesitates. “John?”
“Very good.”
The only acceptable filling for Krapfen is apricot jam. Get out of here with your vanilla and Powidl and chocolate and all of that new-fangled crap. Apricot jam. Icing sugar. The end.
He reaches for his bowl. “The most common mistake in baking is reading recipes wrong. Especially when recipes are written in measuring units you’re not overly familiar with. The most common errors happen when converting pounds into kilos, or cups into grams and liters. Let me show you what happens. I’ve combined butter, sugar and flour into a simple biscuit dough, and I’m kneading it, but it won’t come together properly. That’s because I’ve added seven grams of sugar instead of 70, like the recipe calls for.”
He turns back to the first page and sees that John has written something there.
“How can you be so sure?”
“First of all, being afraid of being bombed seems reasonable to me, not cowardly,” Sherlock says, still in that neutral, academic tone, which does a lot to ease John’s embarrassment at having brought up the subject at all. “And secondly, why would you care what I think?”
The water is very loud. Sherlock didn’t consider this when he picked the location for their meeting. He picked it for its sentimental value, not its practicality, which was a mistake he would never have made if John wasn’t involved, and it’s the type of mistake he can badly afford if he wants to stay alive through all of this.
They finally wrap at around nine, and John has been in this theatre and for thirty-six hours.
Sherlock’s smile fades, leaving a lingering sadness on his face before he smooths his expression into a careful neutrality. “See you tomorrow.”
Admittedly, the flat did need a bit of cleaning after Sherlock vacated it, but every household produces dust and mould. And if the landlord didn’t wish to see Sherlock’s body parts collection in the freezer, he shouldn’t have made the police break into his flat to evict him.
voice. “Dissolve a tablespoon of this in some hot water, repeat every eight hours.”
But that's not the reason John loves that violin almost as much as Sherlock does. It’s not even that Sherlock plays beautifully, even though he does. John doesn’t care much for music, but he recognises the level of skill it takes to coax such lovely sounds from this dilapidated instrument. It’s the change that comes over Sherlock the moment the bow touches the strings. It’s like something strung to breaking point has been unwound. He’s completely absorbed, and yet entirely at peace. Thoughtful yet quiet. Raptly focused, yet relaxed. Happiness radiates from him every time he plays, and John knew then and knows now that Sherlock needs this and didn’t know how to ask for it.
She sets his mug down next to the skin samples she took from the victim of his latest murder case and nods at the microscope. “Anything?” she asks quietly, instinctively keeping her voice down, as people are wont to do in the dead of night.
That twitch of the lips again. “No need to be worried, I assure you. It was already quite dead when I found it.”
When John wakes up in the morning, Sherlock is still there, right next to him. It’s a bit cramped, but not uncomfortable. Sherlock’s staring at the beamed ceiling, obviously deep in thought.
Sherlock is still looking at him, his usual intensity amplified, like he wants to x-ray John’s skull. Once again, John feels a rush that’s not unlike jumping off a swing at its highest point. Sherlock Holmes’ undivided attention is oddly intoxicating, and John feels a little light-headed. “By the way,” John says, suddenly remembering. “In case I didn't say, that cake was really good.”
John has no words. No reaction. He’s frozen in time and space.
“Oh god, Irene, why would you say that?” Janine points her pizza slice at her accusingly. “I’m just trying to get through this week without having a nervous breakdown.”
Sherlock on an instinctive level, and it makes Sherlock feel… something. Which is highly unusual.
he doesn’t say.
He makes another sound, enjoying the way his voice vibrates through his chest and throat. It’s a wonderful sensation, a little bit like scraping over his insides with rough velvet.
“Who made them, anyway?” Molly asks.
“What are you doing tomorrow?” Molly asks, fiddling with her apron. “I think my bake might be shit.”
Sherlock looks down into the glass of whisky, sloshing the amber liquid around. The bottom of the glass is thick and heavy, there’s a drop of air trapped in the glass, an obvious design effect, not a fault. Odd, how flaws can sometimes make something more beautiful.
Janine clears her throat, and Sherlock is suddenly aware that he’s been sitting here staring at the mince pies for too long to be socially acceptable. Another thing he misses about John, his ability to let a silence sit, to leave him to his own thoughts for as long as Sherlock needs it.
“Don’t change the subject,” John says, sounding a lot more confident and a lot more like John Watson and not only his shell, “Did you or did you not just say that you love me?”
The lodestone has started spinning again, and it points directly at the gap between the two largest of the stones.
He heads for the door and is almost out of the room when she calls him back. “John?”
Then the elevator dings and they emerge into the lobby of the Savoy, looking rumpled but somewhat decent.
There’s nothing to say to that, at least nothing Sherlock would ever consider saying out loud, so he lets a comfortable silence sink and concentrates on driving them back home.
look.
The milk has gone off again, so he gets breakfast at Speedy’s next door. Mr. Chatterjee doesn’t even ask him for his order anymore, just hands him two scones and a cup of coffee on sight. The fact that every vendor in walking distance of the theatre knows his order on sight and he doesn’t even remember where the nearest Tesco from his flat is says some things about his life he isn’t that comfortable thinking about.
John nods absently. “I guess you’re right.” He follows Sherlock’s example and sits down, using his jacket as a makeshift pillow.
He turns around and John is leaning in the doorframe. “You want some punch?” he asks, clearly hesitant.
Sherlock leans forward a bit, apparently unafraid, and points his chin at the gun. “That handgun is a Browning, obviously British Army issue, so my guess is you met somebody in the service who made you an offer of gainful employment elsewhere, and you weren’t too fastidious about either telling the British Army, or returning your service weapon.”
The bedside lamp is on, casting a warm glow over the bed, leaving the rest of the room dim and dark. John is sprawled on Sherlock’s bed, completely naked, and he’s reading something on his phone and chuckling. It’s been vibrating all through their second round of sex, but John didn’t seem to even notice.
“Bakers, on your mark, get set, bake.”
Moriarty doesn't take his eyes off Sherlock, and Sherlock stares right back.
Takes place right at the end of TSoT
"I'm not crazy about this contract," Janine says as she stirs sugar into her latte.
Sentiment. Again. He needs to stop making decisions based on what John Watson
The other two agree, Lestrade enthusiastically, Donovan sceptically. They each take a plate and start tasting.
It’s Sarah, one of the other apprentices at the clinic. She’s a year older than him and very nice. She’s also blonde and pretty and smart, and curvy in all the right places in ways that John can’t help but notice. She’s also sharp as tack and John has a hard time keeping up with her academically, and he finds that even more attractive. He’s been thinking about asking her to go for a drink, his rugby mates have been ribbing him about his lack of a social life, and he thinks they might have a point. Between studying to become a medic and the equally consuming time he spends exploring the city and tracking down puzzles with Sherlock, he just hasn't had the time to think about girls. Maybe he should make time.
One does not need to hold public office to feel a sense of public responsibility. There is such a thing as a citizen’s arrest, after all.
Kitty’s flat is empty and all her things are gone. It’s like she had never lived there.
He and Sherlock both sit, and the woman they don’t know gestures at a small tray with wooden bowls on them. “Please have some refreshments. The walk must have made you thirsty.” Her voice is deep and dignified, and her English is perfect.
“It doesn’t matter,” he says, waving the argument away with an impatient hand gesture. “I’m here now. Will you come back with me?”
This seems the perfect opportunity to exit the conversation with everybody’s dignity intact, but as always, John’s curiosity wins out over his sense of self-preservation and he asks, “What did Sherlock say to you?”
Molly winces again. "Well, the good news is I think nothing's broken, but I'll bandage these anyway, at least for now. I'd recommend putting some eldritch flower ointment on it twice a day, starting tomorrow morning. And I'm also giving you some painkillers."
It’s warm inside the car, but the temperature starts to drop immediately as the heaters go out. The windshield fogs up quickly with their breaths.
“No idea. Just play it by ear,” Greg answers, then coughs.
Sherlock grins. There’s a reason he adores Martha Hudson.
through Sherlock’s body. “I do,” John says, voice trapped somewhere between tender and aroused.
He doesn’t know how he gets to the cemetery, he doesn’t know where the gun comes from, he only knows this must end right now. Right now.
“Maybe he was right,” he whispers against Sherlock’s back, pressing a kiss to a sharp shoulder blade.
Sherlock looks up at the stars and, oddly, thinks of the sofa back in Baker Street.
“How do you forgive something like that?” he asks, looking back up at Mary. “Really, deep down? How do you come back from something like that?”
He strains his ears to identify it, but for a moment, it’s quiet.
The waitress fits the place perfectly, colourless, faded, tired, sad. John orders chips and a pot of tea. Sherlock just waves her off. John tells her to bring a second cup anyway.
Sherlock turns and starts walking towards his car. He's tired and frankly not in the mood to talk to anyone. John hasn't seen him. He can just walk away. He can just get into his car and drive back to London and ignore John Watson, who's sitting there like a forgotten child who didn't get picked up from school.
Sherlock stops tattooing the dead pig - John is pretty sure he doesn’t want to know why Sherlock is doing this in the first place - and watches him with a mixture of curiosity and wariness.
“I don’t even know, to be honest. I was… I never should have gone back to her.”
He tries not to think about John.
The jury and some of the crew cheer, and John pumps his fist in the air and grins. “Told you so,” he says to Sherlock, eyes sparkling. “Gran’s recipes never fail.”
Sherlock gives her a grim, humourless smile. “In answer to your first point, Miss Winters, yes, we’re sixteen, but we’re also the only people who will believe you. So if you’re at all interested in seeing your friend’s killer brought to justice, I suggest you talk to us.”
Sherlock puts down the phone and wonders why John isn’t sleeping, whether he’s had a nightmare, whether he’s antsy and lonely like Sherlock, whether he’s also baking.
“Fine, consider me warned. Now will you help me look for my cane?”
Emma smirks and makes a gesture of locking her lips with a little key, but from her little shrug, he knows he hit the nail on the head. She leans closer and mutters, “We’ve put Watson next to you, don’t worry.”
They break apart for breath, and John looks up at Sherlock, smiling at him like he’s a winning lottery ticket, hair mussed from Sherlock’s fingers. There’s green bodypaint on his face, on his hands, all over his clothes.  It looks insanely good on him.
Sherlock is silent next to him. They’ve been walking along the river for what seems like a long time. It’s a mild day, and the sky is slowly taking on the reds and oranges of a magnificent sunset.
The boy from supper, Holmes or whatever his name was, is bent over the kitchen table that holds something furred, bloody and quite dead. He’s holding a scalpel and a pair of tweezers.
But now, apparently, John has softened somewhat. Now, maybe, John will let him explain. Now, maybe, John is prepared to try to forgive him.
When he wakes up, it's just before dawn and John is still deeply asleep. He slides out from under John’s body, gets dressed and leaves.
But if Sherlock hates one thing, it’s mornings after. Waking up first, being quiet, morning breath, using bathrooms, awkward goodbyes, painful negotiations about how to communicate that this was nice, yes, but a one-time-thing and not to be overrated, just biology, just a quick scraping over each others’ pleasure centers. There’s no difference between good sex and eating an especially good piece of cake, chemically speaking, after all. Just tickling the dopamine receptors.
Sherlock turns to John. “Let’s find out.”
(though John’s version is a bit more “rustic”)
“Mary was a life raft. She kept him from drowning, and I’m grateful for that. But that’s not a very good reason to marry someone, and I’m pretty sure that boy is going to be back at your doorstep sooner rather than later. What are you going to do when he comes back?”
Something of this must show on his face, because John’s eyes flick to his lips, then meet his gaze, darkening with implicit promise.
“What did you do with it after the photoshoot?” Irene asks.
Sherlock watches the foam slowly collapse as Janine stirs it into the coffee. His own coffee sits there, untouched, and both he and Janine waved away any offer of baked goods. They're sitting at a Costa's in central London, surrounded by tourists and university students. The air is filled with a dozen languages and a few arguments about whose turn it is to do the assignment this week.
He gets up, pours himself coffee and checks his emails. He deletes the ten obligatory slur-filled comments from Moriarty’s troll army. They’ve been more active lately since Moriarty ripped his bakery to shreds on his blog. Ironically, it’s been rather good for business, driving people to their doorstep to find out whether they’re really that bad. As always, he refuses to engage with the trolls, or with Moriarty himself. He knows it drives Moriarty nuts that Sherlock never engages with him, but Sherlock doesn’t want to reward Moriarty’s behaviour by contributing to his social media engagements. He also has better things to do with his life.
, and a street-smart, morally deeply ambiguous petty criminal like Billy isn’t likely to judge.
“Yes, Mr DeMille,” John says with an audible eye-roll. “We will both take our cakes with us on Saturday and let the remaining contestants on Bake Off decide which of the cakes is better. The video will be posted in full, with recipes and all, on Sherlock’s YouTube channel, so subscribe if you want to get notified when Sherlock posts the video. Comments and questions below.” He looks at Sherlock. “Good?”
them, and
The door opens and Molly enters, carrying two cups. From the smell, he can already tell that it’s more terrible coffee.
“I want to go to that village,” Sherlock finally says.
After the second run-through, the cast is done for, and so is Lestrade. John reminds them of rehearsal tomorrow at ten, and by ten he means start rehearsing at ten, not slink in at five past and then have a fag and a cuppa. He looks pointedly at Irene, and she smiles back sweetly and gives him a mock salute. “Yes, Captain.”
Sherlock turns his head away to hide his smile.
Sherlock rolls to face John. They aren’t touching, but Sherlock can still feel the warmth of John next to him, and he knows he won’t wash these sheets for far too long because they’ll still smell like John. John looks tired, more than anything. Tired, and sad. Unhappy.
Lya looks like she’s about to object, but she subsides when the Midnight Queen glares at her.
Everything dissolves, then, into heat and sweat and the slapping of flesh and grunts and moans traded between their lips, and when John’s hand closes around Sherlock’s erection, he comes with a loud moan that John tries to swallow from his lips. John follows closely after, then collapses half on top of Sherlock. Sherlock closes his eyes and wraps his arms around John, and they just lie there, sweat and come cooling on their skins, sticky and disgusting, and utterly perfect, for now.
He takes a sip of his mug and gives up all pretense that he isn’t watching John carefully introduce an egg yolk into the custard. John is concentrating hard on not making scrambled eggs out of his custard, and his tongue is sticking out a little between his teeth. He’s sweaty and absorbed and dusted with flour from head to toe and Sherlock wants to muss him up even more.

“Leave it,” Sherlock mutters into John’s mouth, but John draws back.
“Bakers, on your mark, get set, bake.”
“Anything,” Sherlock breathes, and the part of him that can still think is scared of the absolute nature of that statement, because he means it, right this very moment, John can have
John winces. “He’s still your agent?”
Finally, he can’t take it anymore. He goes over to John, plucks the book out of his hand and plants himself in John’s lap. John is smiling at him like he’s an especially adorable idiot, which Sherlock concedes might be true, because he can’t figure out why it’s taken him this long to get here.
Sherlock experiments with savoury and sweet scones, then decides on the cranberry-lime. For savouries he decides to do macarons, and spends a day trying out different flavour combinations.
The judges withdraw to think, and Molly walks over to John to try the turnovers. Sherlock starts cleaning up and listens with one ear as Molly praises John’s dessert, watching John as he leans against his workstation and explains the recipe to Molly. He’s wearing soft-looking jeans and a checkered button-down that Sherlock has seen him wear often enough that he considers it a favourite. It’s cotton, but the fabric is worn and soft and feels almost like flanel, and Sherlock knows this because he’s peeled John out of that shirt on several separate occasions. And he’s probably never going to do that again.
He spends time with the other boys, too, playing rugby or football, and they often tease him for being friends with the oddball Holmes, but John doesn’t care, because even listening to Sherlock complain about how John is tedious for finding another rat skull is still the most interesting conversation he’s ever had.
“They must have taken one through the Gate from this side,” Sherlock says. He looks at John intently, but John knows he's not really seeing him. “The jewelry store.... remember that robbery shortly after we got here?”
A knock on the door makes them break apart hastily. “Yes?” John says, then looks at Sherlock, brow adorably wrinkled in confusion. “Wait, is this your room or mine?” he whispers.
With that, he leaves Sherlock to gape after him in wordless surprise, and Sherlock isn’t entirely sure how they got here. He was trying to alienate John, not amuse him. He’s not sure whether he’s disappointed or relieved.
It was a grave mistake on his part, because what happened next - and he really should have seen this coming - was that a highly enraged John Watson showed up in Mycroft’s office and nearly murdered Mycroft with his bare hands.
John grimaces and looks down at his cane. “Not anymore,” he says, and the wistful regret in his voice is hard to miss.
BTW, if you want a quick dessert that will send you straight to heaven: make a crepe, fill it with Powidl, coat with the poppy seed-butter-sugar mix from above. It’s called Bohemian Palatschinke, and it’s to die for. The poppy seeds and the Powidl are divine together.
I wasn’t apologising.
Listra, the pharmacist, walks in from the store room. “What did you do to my mice?” she asks, narrowing her eyes at Sherlock, her wings snapping up, a clear sign of irritation. She’s tiny, but everybody is afraid of her, even Sherlock.
They walk away from the museum in silence.
John takes the phone and looks at it for a long moment. Then he lets out a long sigh and lowers it slightly to look at Sherlock. “I’ve never missed a show before.”
Sherlock looks at the picture for a long time. John’s grandmother looks very little like him, except for her eyes. They’re similarly shaped and seem to be the same dark blue as John’s. She’s wearing a simple house dress. Both children are in sharply pressed button-down shirts, apparently dressed up for the photo. Sherlock wonders whether there is another picture in this series, one without the grandmother, one where the children are looking into the camera and smiling formally, a picture for framing, not tucking carelessly into a recipe book. But the picture looks like it’s been handled many times, looked at many times. It looks like a peaceful moment in a hard life. It looks like something you take out and gaze at when things are tough, to remind yourself that if things were this good once, they can be this good again.
Underneath it all, dread hums under his skin.
John raises his eyebrows, but says nothing, waiting for Sherlock to get his point out.
Sherlock presses a kiss to John’s forehead and smiles. “I figured.”
“I’m not sure that was my point,” John says, rubbing a hand over his face, a tired, resigned gesture. “Of course there are objective criteria, but there are some things that can’t be measured and evaluated objectively, they are just totally and entirely subjective.”
“Why didn't you report the theft to the Watch?” Sherlock asks the obvious question.
“Let’s start with Molly.” Lestrade turns to her and gives her a warm smile. “Molly, you’ve been incredibly consistent. You haven’t always been spectacular, but I can’t recall a bad bake from you. You’ve got your own style, and you’re innovative without pushing the boat out too far. Your eclairs today were perfect, and we loved your trifle, you really elevated it to something special. So without further ado: Molly, you’re in the final!”
He turns back, but John isn’t looking at him, he’s still gazing into the courtyard. “Yes?”
“Oh god,” Sherlock groans. “Another cliche.”
Janine smirks. "Yes, and first, you're in a good financial situation right now, second, I know how banks think, and third, you can absolutely use your trust fund as collateral, because I'm pretty sure we can get your brother to give up control over it."
The crew ignore him as they set up, leisurely laying cables and fixing lights. There’s a small area with a few rows of seats for the audience, such as it is.
Because the photos, aside from revealing that John has shitty baking equipment, also demonstrate that his kitchen is not only old and ugly, but tiny.
“What did you say?” John asks, intrigued now.
Sherlock laughs, looking over at her. She grins at him, unrepentant and wicked. “How much wine did you have?” he asks.
“When? How?” he asks, voice barely audible, the hollow places inside of him where John used to fit ringing like a bell.
Sherlock gets up and walks towards the table, unable to speak around the lump in his throat.
Neither of them says anything as they both look out over the car park towards the tent and beyond. The landscape is dark, the trees, empty of leaves, weave their skeletal arms into the cloudless sky.
Sherlock picks up, glad that nobody can see how much his hands are shaking with exhaustion and nerves. "John."
The cab pulls up at the A+E entrance of St. Bart’s, and Sherlock and John get out of the car. John starts to go in, but turns around when he realises Sherlock’s not following.
“Screen test John Watson, British Bake Off, Take 1. So, John, tell us a bit about yourself.”
John shrugs. “Well. You too,” he says without looking at Sherlock. “I’m going to get a drink,” he adds, gesturing vaguely at the bar and walking away.

“You know what this is?” John asks, holding the contraption into the light, and Sherlock recognises it immediately, of course. It’s a nasal spray that’s used as first aid for opioid overdoses, and Sherlock’s seen it once too often for his taste. “I bought this after I moved into 221B five years ago. It’s now expired. Please tell me I don’t have to buy a new one.”
Sherlock grins. “New corpse?” he calls back.
He can’t remember the last time he slept more than two hours at a time. Or the last time he had a decent meal, showered, washed his hair, made tea, had an entire glass of water.
“Do what?” John asks, confused.
“We don’t understand you,” Sherlock says, and the fairies exchange a glance.
Sherlock stares at her, momentarily speechless. "How?" he asks, and if his voice isn't entirely steady, Janine pretends not to notice.
John is so tired. So very, very tired.
Sherlock actually blushes a bit, which John finds utterly charming. “Not sex...” He gestures between the two of them. “But all the rest of it, too. Remembering birthdays, and getting dinner, and asking how your day was, and all the rest of the tedious nonsense people seem to value so highly.” He looks down at where his hands are still fisted in John’s jumper. “Being honest,” he adds quietly. “Not hurting you all the time.”
John is in at eight the next morning, wishing he hadn’t had that second shot. Or the third one. Or the fourth one.
The don offered him a glass of whiskey. He drank. Then everything went black.
Only that’s not true, because he knows exactly what he was thinking.
John’s pastry is neither of these things, but he’s inspired by both.
The oven dings, and Sherlock is left alone in his kitchen with apple-poppy seed pastries and John’s jumper, flung haphazardly over the KitchenAid.
The last brings him up short. The show offers no cash prize, and he now sees his own idiocy of not having thought about the indirect profitability of the show. “I’ll think about it,” he says and hangs up.
Well, if he’s entirely honest with himself, he’s having a smoke because he wanted to stop himself from going to look for John right away. And because he’s nervous about going to look for John at all. Flirting in the tent is one thing, deliberately seeking out someone for what can only be described as a booty call is something entirely different.
Sherlock stops and turns, and John can see Sherlock's razor-sharp attention focussing on Jim. His face registers no surprise, just an alert wariness. “Good evening, Mr Moriarty.”
“No.” John pauses for a moment and then grabs at Sherlock’s arm, patting it awkwardly. “Thank you. You know. For the cake.”
The Savoy is lit up by hundreds of Christmas lights and trees. It’s already snowing lightly by the time Sherlock enters. Children are carolling in the foyer. It smells of cinnamon and Christmas punch. It’s enough to make one sick to one’s stomach.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Of course, Mrs Hudson.”
Before, he was inclined to regard John’s presence in his life as a temporary luxury, something he would soon tire of or discard or watch as it walked away, a transient comet passing through his life, unique, beautiful, but not meant to stay.
“What mistake am I going to make?” John asks, and to Sherlock’s surprise, he sounds genuinely curious, and there’s a small smile playing around his lips.
There’s an ominous pause. It’s almost half an hour before John answers.
John wonders how exactly Mrs Hudson can tell, but since he agrees, he doesn’t argue. “We’re glad we’ve got you, too,” John says, meaning every word. Mrs Hudson’s unquestioning kindness to them makes this strange place almost into a home.
John snorts. "We're way past smart at this point."
"Might as well, saves you the trouble of summoning me if it's interesting," Sherlock says, and he doesn't say thank you, doesn't show how much he appreciates Molly's quiet company, but he knows Molly sees right through his attempt to recapture some of the superior arrogance he used to have, when he took kindness for granted and still labored under the delusion that he had no friends and therefore nothing to lose.
“So what?” Sherlock asks and reaches for the book.
For a moment, disconcertingly, he looks like a stranger. A smooth, boring, good-looking stranger. Somebody Sherlock doesn’t know at all.
“And then the Fey'a blew it up to render the entire contraption useless.”
Silence falls. John’s staring at Sherlock, looking as pole-axed as Sherlock feels. The last time they talked, John was blazing with anger, but this time Sherlock can see how wary John looks, how tired, how haggard and hollow.
“I won, didn’t I?” Sherlock answers, shooting John a gleeful grin.
“You do it,” Sherlock says, faking casual boredom, and succeeding rather well.
Sherlock glares at his brother and smiles at John, who gives him an absent smile in return. It seems John brought dinner, judging from the smell of Chinese food that fills the kitchen. Sherlock sits down on the third kitchen chair and looks pointedly at Mycroft. “You do realise that I own a mobile phone?”
“Kitty,” Sherlock says, very serious and very quiet. “Can you describe the man you made the deal with?”
“I like it when you use big words.”
Sherlock is there at 7 am.
Sherlock nearly flinches as Irene seems to almost speak his thoughts aloud. “I hope you don’t have any intention to find out,” he says, trying to sound idly curious, and as if it doesn’t bother him at all, the thought of Irene touching John. He hates himself a bit for it, but the mere thought makes his hackles rise.
After what might be hours, or minutes, the trees reveal the clearing. The bronze mirrors are dark and wet with condensation, and the iron ring in the middle is barely visible.
“That’s not the point. I knew he wasn’t capable of doing it, and I shouldn’t have let him,” John points out.
“It’s biscuit week in the tent, and the technical challenge for this week: American style chocolate chip cookies. The judges want twelve indentical beautiful chocolate chip cookies, but this time, the contestants are allowed to add a bit of a personal touch, like nuts.”
“Neela’s out, any reaction to that?”
Fits well with this week’s theme, though, right? Nothing says nostalgia quite like formica worktops and brown kitchen tiles.
Sherlock is too overwhelmed to speak. He wants to say that he would die for John a million times in a heartbeat, simply because it would be easier than living with knowing he could have prevented John’s death. He wants to say that if only one of them can live, he will always, always pick John, always. He wants to lie and say, all right. I promise. But the one thing he can do for John is stop lying to him. Because John is right, this
“I don’t have
The vomiting leaves a giant mess and it’s disgusting, and they need to switch out a few props every other night or so, because the moisture of the porridge mix they use for vomit ruins them. But the run-throughs are going extremely well, and Sherlock is so much better than Jim that even Seb has made his peace with the switch. Mrs Hudson was in on Friday, and today they did a props-only run for the crew on stage, and everything went swimmingly. Lestrade even provided a much-needed laugh when he told everybody to do a “no vomit” run, which definitely goes into John’s collection of things you only hear in the theatre.
Harry shrugs. “‘course. Smoke stinging my eyes.”
“You don’t have to apologise for anything,” Sherlock answers, and he hates himself a bit for the quiver in his voice that mirrors the tremor in his knees.
There’s a long silence, and finally Sherlock looks up to see John watching him with an unreadable expression. “How did you fail?” he asks finally, and his voice isn’t any steadier than Sherlock’s.
John nods, and Sherlock feels the muscles in his shoulders move under his hands. “Me too.”
The party in the green room is in full swing. Mrs Hudson has decorated a bit, put up a small tree, some tinsel and fairy lights, so the usually drab room looks rather nice.
Her blunt honesty and the complete conviction in her voice hit Sherlock in the gut like a punch.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything, he’s not even looking at Donovan and Lestrade, he’s staring at John with cool, calculating scrutiny. “Did he break your ribs?” he asks, and there’s a cold wrath in his tone that sends a not unpleasant shiver down John’s spine.
Sherlock comes back to Baker Street after 455 days, after 354, after 546, after 539, and John is gone, gone, gone.
Molly smiles at him, probably guessing that he doesn’t know what to say, so she elaborates. “Look, we’re a small community, and Medic is a tough job. There’s few who are cut out for it. Most people get queasy or uncomfortable, but you didn’t blink yesterday. I haven’t seen promise like this in years. So here’s my offer: Until you start your apprenticeship, you’ll clean the rooms and the surgery itself, assist me or one of the other doctors with simple procedures, do paperwork. Once you’re an apprentice, you’ll do all of this, plus you’ll learn the trade of Medic. If we have money left at the end of the month, we’ll pay you a little for the cleaning and the helping out. Once you’re an apprentice, you’ll be on salary, but the position comes without room and board.”
“There
He lies down on the bed fully dressed and lets John’s soft, even breathing lull him to sleep.
John lies there, panting and shivering, obviously miserable and unwilling to admit it. He cracks an eye open and fixes Sherlock with a glare. “I hate you.”
John’s sitting on the sofa, reading a novel. Sherlock has been staring at him for about fifteen minutes.
“Like what?”
“Thank you. Your savoury scones looked delicious,” he returns the compliment, genuine as she was, because they’re professionals who respect each others’ skills, even if they’re competition.
150 grams butter
Then he turns to Sherlock, who looks…. odd. Who doesn’t seem to have moved in the last few seconds. Who isn’t even blinking.
“Cupcake challenge,” Sherlock says, then bites into his scone, mostly to stop himself from staring at John. He’s wearing well-fitting jeans and a blue button-down that brings out his eyes, and Sherlock has the ridiculous urge to touch him.
“Sherlock, don’t!” John yells and grabs Sherlock's arm, but the sound of his voice is swallowed by the ascending almost-singing, rising to a sudden cacophony of noise.
be your crowning achievement if you won against me. Since you won’t, however…” Sherlock trails off and shrugs.
, John,” Sherlock bites out. “I’ve got two months to come up with a hundred thousand pounds, otherwise this place will be
The display cases are filled with bone fragments, spearheads, arrowheads, pottery shards, barely legible scrolls, animal teeth, human skulls and dozens of other things. The maps on the walls are mostly of the area, marking burial sites and ancient settlements.
It’s a dark alley and John is unconscious, Sherlock’s hands are slick with blood and he has spent the last eighty-seven seconds breathing air into John’s lungs and willing his heart to start beating again.
Sherlock holds up the lodestone so Moriarty can see it clearly. It's spinning violently and at long last setting to point directly at the Gate.
Sherlock doesn’t deign to reply. He starts his coffee grinder, and dusts off his Italian espresso maker. The grinder makes a hideous noise that drowns out whatever Mycroft might say next, and Sherlock contemplates just recording the sound and playing it whenever Mycroft talks to him in the future.
“Open your mouth,” John says, and takes a - wholly gratuitous - step closer to Sherlock.
"What?" Sherlock asks, confused.
Lestrade, as it turns out, is sort of a magistrate, John guesses, because he’s got an office in what is clearly a municipal building.
Trembling hands reach for his phone, automatically, and his text program is open before he knows it.
“I don’t know yet,” Sherlock grates out grudgingly. “But I’ll find out.”
“I very much think we need to have this conversation now, after my brother dug you out of a fire with his bare hands,” Mycroft says, still in the same mild tone, but John hears the steel underneath, and he knows he can’t fight this.
John shifts them around a bit so he can reach the door and unlock it, and Sherlock gets another whiff of John’s hair. It smells like tea and beer and antiseptics, laundry detergent and John’s shampoo. It’s oddly nice.
John looks at him with a mixture of tired anger, exasperation and amusement. “What day is it, Sherlock?”
“Of course.”
Sherlock nods and finishes his tea. “Let’s go.”
Sherlock takes his tea to the sofa, sits down and waits. He isn’t entirely sure for what.
“Shut up, or I’ll never do it again,” Sherlock mutters.
Sherlock takes out the recipe book he brought to return to John. “Yes. Look.”
John stares at her. “The clearing exploded.”
“Charming chap,” John comments mildly, having watched the whole exchange with some interest. “Does he realise he looks like an arse in these chef whites?”
“Easily remedied,” Sherlock says and holds out his hand. John drops his phone into it, and Sherlock programs his number into John’s contacts.
“Obviously,” Sherlock says, trying for humor, but John hears the uncertainty in his voice.
His phone vibrates with a text. It’s the Bake Off group chat. Irene has posted a link to Moriarty’s blog.
“Fine, fine,” John placates her and sinks back into the sofa cushions, holding the two samples. “Am I supposed to know the difference?”
Sherlock moves away from the door, nodding at Billy. “Trust us on this, we won’t tell anyone.”
Sherlock loves this room. When John was living here alone, during the time he always thinks of as Before, he used to come up here and sit in the middle of the room on the floor, just soaking up the John Watson-ness of the room, deducing facts about John from his clothing, his aftershave, his shoes, the dearth of his personal belongings.
John smiles and catches Sherlock doing the same.
“What?” Sherlock asks again, considerably more alert now.
Greg, who’s directing the production John is currently rehearsing, rubs a hand over his face. He looks like he hasn’t slept much, if at all. “Good morning to you too, John, thanks, I’m well, would you care for a cuppa?”
“Well, don’t overwhelm me with details,” Janine mutters.
“It’s not the same,” he says, voice not entirely steady.
This is it, guys. It took me 18 + months to write this fic, and I want to thank by beta
Everybody laughs, and the cameras move on to Sherlock, who can’t be bothered to look up from where he’s stretching out his filo pastry. “Filo for mince pies, very interesting,” Mrs Turner muses. “Do you also regret your life decisions?”
Sherlock steps forward, almost like in trance, and raises an arm as if to touch the stone.
John throws his last stone. It skips, and Sherlock can tell from the first skip that he’ll reach ten.
Sherlock swallows and looks at his fingers, trying to hide the little shiver that involuntarily runs down his spine at that tone of voice.
“He’s a prat, and you’re a catch, John, and everybody agreed, even back then, that he was the lucky one.” Molly gives John an affectionate smile. “So Sherlock was quite clear about his interest, and John didn’t read the signs. The most blatant things went straight over his head. Once, we were talking about smoking, and John said kissing smokers is disgusting, and Sherlock just dropped his half-smoked cigarette and announced he was quitting, and John just… didn’t get it. Anyway, we were doing A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Sherlock was playing Puck, of course, and he wore these tiny green shorts and had his entire body painted with green glitter paint, and, well, that was John’s breaking point, and he spent the entire run covered in green paint, because Sherlock would snog John while he was still in make-up. I think he was trying to mark his property, make it obvious to everybody that John was his.”
Sherlock relented after that, because John was right.
Sherlock shrugs. “If you wanted to kill me to eliminate me from the competition, you could have gone about it a bit more subtly.”
John feels a vague sense of excitement bubbling up. “So what is it?”
Sherlock mentally chastises John, tightening his grip on John.
The others start trickling in. Sherlock pretends to ignore them while subtly watching them whether one of them will take the workstation. They all pass it by, greeting him with varying degrees of friendliness.
Then, slowly, so as to not spook Sherlock, John shifts a bit and places gentle fingers on each side of Sherlock’s temples. He gently splays his fingers along Sherlock’s scalp and starts to gently massage.
He’s about to pass when he realises there’s still light under the stage entrance door. Before he can talk himself out of it, he opens the door and passes through the dark green room to the stage manager’s office door.
John shrugs, looking back at Sherlock, who’s leaving the hall through another door that John supposes leads into the library. “It wasn’t that hard. He’s… interesting.”
Maybe that’s the problem. John gets off his chair. “Lie down on the sofa.”
“We’re low priority,” Sherlock says, shrugging out of his coat and bundling it up to make a cushion, then sitting down on the floor, leaning his back against the wall. “We’re not injured, and it’s far too much work to crank the lift manually to the ground floor to get us out. Once the power goes back on, we’ll be fine.”
John looks at her. “Can I stay with Sherlock?”
Molly pads out of the guest room in socked feet, wrapped in a fluffy blanket. She smiles at him and hugs him, and John rests his head on her shoulder for a second, letting himself be comforted by her uncomplicated affection.
John lets out a deep breath. “That was a lot more drama than I ever thought a baking show could have.”
“I have to say, I’m somewhat disappointed.”
Sherlock stops, turns to him, and then they’re both laughing, half because it’s hilarious, and half because John’s chest contains too much joy to keep it in, so it releases into gales of slightly hysterical laughter.
The world fades away as Sherlock sinks into the deep concentration he only ever experienced with baking, and sometimes when he plays the violin. Mixing, silcing, tasting, more sugar, then the crust, beautiful flaked butter kneaded into the flour, careful not to overwork it.
John smiles back, small but genuine. “Thank you.”
Sherlock huffs a laugh, and slowly, the intensity fades from his gaze, and he lets John go. John immediately misses the warmth of Sherlock so close, and shakes his head to snap himself out of it.
“I want to fuck you,” John mutters against Sherlock’s carotid, punctuating the statement with a teasing bite. “Tell me I can fuck you.”
“Yes. That was… good.”
“Well, you bloody well should have, I thought you were a bloody genius!” John says sharply. “An entire village disappeared!”
John shrugs, even though Sherlock can’t see him. “Slow night. Tea?”
Sherlock chucks the phone into a nearby river out of spite.
He tries to find something to do. He reads up on medical discoveries he’s missed on the front lines. He interviews for a few jobs. But the tremor in his left hand means he can’t operate, probably never again.
“Like the cabbie?” John asks, and Sherlock nods, reluctantly conceding John’s point, because that wasn't the best decision he ever made either.
John sighs and smiles at Sherlock a little sadly. “I can’t answer that, Sherlock.”
Sherlock separates eggs and hands the egg whites to Mr Chatterjee, who’s been watching him bake with badly concealed nostalgia. “Could you beat these? That would be very helpful.”
“Good night, John,” Sherlock says and walks away, closing the door carefully behind him.
Mike shrugs. “Been worse. What’s going on here?”
Rest in peace, Una Stubbs. 221 Baker Street will never be the same.
“Well, see you around, gents,” Billy says with a parting salute and closes the door behind him.
“You discovered that the Gate had been re-opened when we stumbled through, didn't you?” Sherlock asks, but from his tone it's clear it wasn't really a question.
Sent: 3:22 am
Surprised and trying not to show it, Sherlock asks, “Where?”
He traces John’s skull, naming the bones in his mind, wonderful names, lovely names. Occipital, Parietal, Temporal, Mandible. John hasn’t shaved this morning; Sherlock can feel the rasp of stubble when he slides his fingers over the skin of John’s face. It’s entirely fascinating.
. “What is it?” he asks, curious and concerned now, and wide awake.
John laughs and pulls the duvet over himself. Sherlock turns off the lights, and arranges himself on his side, so he’s looking at John but not touching him. John rolls so they’re facing each other.
“John. Listen to me,” Sherlock says, still gently, but with a hint of authority now. “You don’t have to see her. You have another home to go to.”
“What the…” John whispers.
John shrugs. “You want to talk about it?”
The email comes on a rainy Wednesday. Sherlock is making raspberry jam, and he’s experimenting with how much of the sugar he can replace with honey. He’s got three batches going, and he’s just measuring out the honey for batch three, spooning out the beautiful, golden syrup into the measuring glass. He adds it to the raspberries and sets the timer for the jam to simmer.
He’s experimented with several fillings for his filo pastry and yesterday he finally settled on a butternut squash-pecan-cranberry filling that his homeless network went absolutely potty over. He’s not entirely sure how much he actually likes the filling himself, but the clear majority of test subjects liked it, therefore it doesn’t much matter that it’s not entirely to his taste.
John contemplates asking what any of this is supposed to be for a moment, but he hasn’t had a lot of sleep, and decides that he doesn’t care. He goes back upstairs and is asleep again within minutes.
He turns around and glares at her. She’s stirring her coffee thoughtfully and ignores his glare. Seeing him at his worst has removed any trace of awe Molly ever had of him.
John rubs at his neck and looks at Sherlock fondly. “You make a surprisingly comfortable pillow, given how little you eat.”
“Yes, I made a stencil.”
They have a brief argument how to proceed when they actually reach the city. Sherlock is more inclined to spend a night on the street, but John points out that they don’t have any food - bread and cheese from this morning are long gone -, they’re both wearing light summer clothing, and they stick out like a sore thumb, so much so that John’s caught more than one passer-by staring at them. Their clothes, their shoes, the fact that they’re dirty, exhausted, twelve and unaccompanied, all make them extremely conspicuous. John is all for going to the authorities, because maybe the police can help them get back home. Sherlock thinks the police are idiots, but since Sherlock thinks this of 99% of the human population, the argument is short, and John wins.
He looks out at the sleeping theatre and rubs a hand over his face, tired of waiting.
Sherlock looks down into his tea. “Perfect.”
For a while they’re silent, Sherlock gazing out of the window, John is lost in his own thoughts. Mostly he thinks of his mother, and how he isn’t sure if she’ll be deeply distressed or also secretly a bit relieved when he fails to come back. His life as he knew it is over anyway, school and home and his family all gone up in smoke. So what difference does it make, really, where he’s adrift and alone?
John shrugs. “But unavoidable. You can’t be truly objective about food. You’ll always like some things better than others, for no discernable reason. It’s called taste.”
They walk along the corridor that leads to their respective bedrooms. Sherlock’s being uncharacteristically quiet, deep in thought. John tries to think of something to say that’s reassuring and still doesn’t give away the fact that he wasn’t asleep just now.
The cellar is suffocatingly close. So many people.
“Why, because I was intoxicated?” Sherlock says, and he can’t help the acid that creeps into his voice, the irritation that John can dismiss Sherlock kissing him this easily, like it’s an everyday occurrence, like it doesn’t matter, like it doesn’t
“Experiment.”
“So, Sherlock, congratulations for winning the technical.”
“You - why did you give me this?” Mycroft asks, and there’s something unsteady in his voice, something almost like emotion.
When he’s sure that everybody’s set for tomorrow, he goes backstage into the green room that serves as the stage crew’s office and helps himself to a beer from the fridge. He sits down on the decrepit sofa and takes a deep breath.
Then his pastry is ready to come out of the fridge and he loses himself in the baking again.
He tries. There are cases, and they’re great, and there’s 221B, which is still good, if only because every surface has a memory of John attached to it.
“Well, honestly, her name is Harry, how was I supposed to know?”
“Any guesses yet who will win next week?”
John thinks of the large, ancient jumper in his suitcase, the one that belonged to his dad and hangs almost down to his knees, and doesn’t say anything.
John is last, and he looks nervous and hot and miserable as the judges cut into his pie.
“None of that counts, you know,” he says, wearing that curiously patient expression he reserves for moments when he thinks Sherlock is being dense.
Sherlock looks down at the floor, and John can see the deep uncertainty, and he hates it.
Even through the darkness, John recognises her as the Fey’a who led him and Sherlock out of the woods on the day they came here. “Lya?”
“Of course you are,” Sherlock answers, shocked into speaking. “How can you even say that?”
“Not me,” Kitty says. “I don’t know about Vi. Last time I saw her was about a month ago, and she didn’t say anything.” She looks up, blushing a bit. “I hadn’t had much time for her lately, I’ve been seeing someone.” Her eyes fill with tears. “I should have made time,” she whispers.
“January sixth,” he answers, tone as nonchalant as he can make it while his heart is still stuttering. “Just after Christmas. Probably the reason we never really celebrated all that much. Everybody’s still exhausted from another arbitrarily culturally significant date that’s entirely meaningless.”
“John, you want to join us for breakfast?” Molly says from the other side of the door, and both Sherlock and John exhale in relief.
When they reach their village, the Fey’a who has a hold of his arm takes off his blindfold, and John just stares. It takes him a moment to even recognise what he’s looking at. The trees in this part of the forest are all ancient and huge, and many of them have been formed into living houses, cocoons of twigs and furs and leaves. His guard manhandles him up a ladder into one of these “houses”. It’s more like a cave inside, with rough bark and thick carpets.
“Sorry,” he says when he catches up with them. “But the curator at the museum told me you were asking about Kitty?”
When they finally move apart, Sherlock looks flushed and pleased and happy. “How was the play?” he asks against John’s lips.
John rubs a hand over his face, and suddenly he looks so very tired, like it’s two in the morning after days of little sleep, which of course it is. “What…” he stops himself, and tries again, “What did you think was going to happen tonight, when you went to meet him?”
He’s always managed somehow, but then, he’s always had help. After his mum died, the army helped. After he came back from Afghanistan, Sherlock helped. And after Sherlock, Mary helped. And now he’s going to have to be the one to help Sherlock recover from a gunshot wound to the chest, while feeling like he’s the one bleeding.
You already said
It’s already dark when he feels like a cigarette. He knows he should resist; the sudden need to smoke again isn’t a good sign. It means his brain is understimulated, and that’s never a good thing. But cigarettes are better than other things, and he’s never had a problem with smoking just one, contrary to other substances, which he can’t use recreationally.
Mrs Turner, meanwhile, has moved on to John.
“Looking back on your time on the Great British Bake Off, what’s your resume?”
Sherlock is aware that the camera is focusing on him, and that both hosts are watching him for a reaction.
Sherlock stops and turns around. “Your point?”
“Which means what, exactly?” Sherlock says, staring at Mrs Hudson like he’s trying to read her mind to figure out whether she’s lying or not.
Sherlock shrugs. “It was… well, very American, I suppose. As in everything is bigger, and they want everything done in half the time. Also, six month runs are hell.”
“Oh yes, that would be absolutely lovely.”
Mrs Turner looks at his notes, messy handwriting on paper already sprinkled with flour and butter. “This looks like a lot of work.”
“Molly won. Good for her. Now can I go?”

Millions of people out there going about their day - their night - normally, as if nothing whatsoever happened. As if hearts don’t break, lives don’t get shattered, and the future isn’t bleak and lonely and awful.
By nine, Mike’s not in and the carpenters need supplies, so John places a few orders and charges Dimmock with picking them up, then he gets to work in the rehearsal room. The pre-set is perfect, so he starts coffee and makes a pot of tea, then he sets out fresh glasses and re-fills the water, sets out the cake they’re eating in the first half of the play, and then he’s still got forty minutes before the actors are due to arrive.
"I barely know a baby's head from its feet," John points out and snuggles back into his pillow. It's 11 pm in London where John is about to go to bed, and 10 am in Sydney. Sherlock has just woken, since he rehearses in the afternoon and evening. But with an 11-hour time difference, John has gotten used to at least one of them being tired and slightly cranky on these calls.
And then Sherlock went and broke them back into individual pieces. Granted, he had no choice at the time. And John eventually forgives him, but he’s made a new whole with another person, and even though there are plenty of empty spaces where Sherlock still fits easily, it’s not the same, in fact it is so much
And to you all, who made sharing this story with you such a joy. Thank you so much for caring about these two idiot bakers as much as I do. I will never forget the feeling of having all of you yell variations of 'Sherlock, you IDIOT' in the comments.
“I brought it back in case you’re ill again.”
The killer curses and drops the gun, then rounds on John and attacks. John dodges and tries to get another hit in with the fire iron, but the killer ducks and punches John straight in the face, then follows it up with a knee to the stomach, and John drops the fire iron and goes down like a sack of bricks. He’s got enough sense left to roll into a protective ball and get his arms up to protect his head before the first kick hits him in the stomach. He takes the second and third in the ribs.
“And he didn’t even say goodbye?” Sally asks, incredulous.
And apparently, he’s the
He looks at Sherlock. He’s pale and looks almost small, wrapped in the blanket off his bed to ward off the cold. John’s pretty sure he hasn’t eaten all day and he also doesn’t know when Sherlock last got a good night’s sleep, since he fell asleep last night to Sherlock sitting in that same spot and found him there this morning.
Sherlock smiles and puts down his phone.
“You can taste it. The filling tastes more like apple strudel than a classic English pie, and I love it,” Moran says. “The bottom is too thick, but oddly enough, I don’t mind so much.”
“Well, maybe, I don’t know, ask him?” Mary suggests.
The forest gets deeper, darker and denser the longer they follow their guides. They see the occasional doe in the distance, rabbits and squirrels, even a wild boar, but it’s still eerily quiet in the woods, life has hushed and is waiting for them to pass to resume its activity. Occasionally, they see odd lights in the distance, and hear a faint whisper, like laughter, in the wind, through the trees. John feels watched by eyes that aren’t exactly hostile, but not precisely friendly either.
There’s a noticeable pause, then John says, voice kept carefully neutral, “That you know of. Don’t forget, cocaine was considered healthy just a hundred years ago. And laudanum addiction was common in the upper classes as well.”
“I almost made special brownies for my sister’s hen party, then thought better of it. Her friends are stupid enough without getting them high,” Janine says, reaching for the teapot.
“I’ve tried to make up for it,” Sherlock says, hating the catch in his voice. “But I failed.”
Sherlock is gone.
Still, some things are better not left to fester. “I hope there won’t be any awkwardness between us because I kissed you,” Sherlock says when John hands him a cup of tea with an amused expression.
“Want to get a drink?” John asks. He points at a table a little away from his mates. “Over there?”
Mycroft sighs. “I refuse to stand idly by while you throw your considerable talents away on a childish fantasy. Baking is for nannies, Sherlock. Baking is for housewives, for ordinary people with little minds and little talents. You could do anything you want. You could rule a small country, or run the Bank of England. Or, if you want to follow Mummy’s footsteps, you could earn a Nobel laureate in Chemistry. Or physics, or mathematics, philosophy. Why would you waste your time mixing sugar with flour?”
Sherlock stays on the fire escape until his fingers are numb, and he wishes the cold could numb that aching emptiness behind his breastbone as well.
"I was looking forward to the Christmas party tonight. Mrs Hudson made gingerbread," John grumbles as he settles down, burrowing into Sherlock in a way that makes Sherlock’s heart twist pleasantly.
“But you didn’t
When Sherlock arrives, he bypasses the hotel, where a few of the other contestants are already standing around waiting for check-in and heads straight to the tent.
The words sting, and Sherlock is asking himself whether he should just leave, when John speaks again. “My therapist says I’m angry with you because I’m really angry with Mary, and you’re a convenient target because you’re still around and she isn’t.”
Mrs Hudson squeezes Sherlock’s hand to get his attention, and he squeezes back but doesn’t look at her, keeps gazing out of the window. He doesn’t know what she’d see in his face, and he doesn’t want to know. “You know, dear, the sad thing is, I think you’re equally terrified of him saying yes as you are of him saying no.”
Sherlock looks at John and nods. “I did. And I’m not sure I could do it again. So best not to tempt fate.” His tone is gentle, but firm.
“And you know this how?” Molly asks, sweetly innocent but with a wicked grin.
Sherlock grabs John to steady him, and his hands linger on John’s hips for a few seconds too long. Their eyes meet, and the smile John gives him seems actually genuine.
John steps out of the ring and goes to sit down on one of the tree stumps serving as pillars for the mirrors. He feels oddly numb. There should be fear somewhere, grief, despair, but it’s like the heavy fog around them keeps his feelings dampened as well. Or maybe he’s just too tired.
, in an elevator.
Sherlock calls after him before he can stop himself. “John.”
John snorts a laugh and hands Sherlock a plate with a variety of slices. Sherlock takes the plate into the dining room, where the others have gathered around the table. Janine is passing a bottle of red wine around and most of the others fill their wine glasses at least half full.
“Um… anything else?”
“Nothing. Don’t engage, otherwise he’ll never stop. He just wants attention, and if we react, he’ll get more of it.”
Then John nods, and Sherlock feels an odd sense of relief, and wonders why relief and falling feel so very similar, the swooping intensity of it. “Yes,” John says, and the smile he gives Sherlock is small, but real, and it makes Sherlock’s lips tug up into an answer. “Yes.”
“Absolutely, Mrs Turner. Right, Sherlock?”
This is the best English recipe I could find, but if you want a truly light and fluffy filling, you should beat the egg whites and fold them into the filling. Also, add raisins to taste (hides from Sherlock).
“Be that as it may,” Lestrade says, “It doesn’t really matter how you got here, what matters is what we’ll do with you. But I think I have an idea. Follow me.”
To the best of his knowledge, he’s been here for two days.
Yes. Good plan.
John smiles at him, fond and true and finally home. "Always."
“He definitely has a concussion,” the doctor agrees. “What’s his name?”
Sherlock rubs a hand over his face and closes his eyes, just for a moment. He takes a sip of his tea and lets himself sink into his mind palace, going over all the steps of his bake. He feels absolutely rotten.
“Well, I’ll leave you to it.”
“Yes,” he whispers, tilting his head so John can bite at his neck. “Yes.”
Sherlock gets up too and helps John put away the leftovers from their midnight snack.
Unconsciously, John’s fingers drift to the watch still hanging on a chain around his neck. “Fighting Nazis isn’t a cause I don’t care about. And fighting the people who killed my dad isn’t one, either.”
And here I thought I was a control freak ;-). Now at least I know why you’ve yet to touch your KitchenAid. See you Saturday!
“Would,” Sherlock corrects, catching John grin out of the corner of his eye.
When the silence becomes too much to bear, Sherlock finally asks, “Why did you call me?”
The room is quiet, the only sounds coming from Mrs Hudson and Mrs Turner, who go from baker to baker and ask them about their bakes.
Billy saunters into the room with his usual swagger, but stops when he sees the corpse on the table. “Oh, no. No. I don’t want nothin’ to do with any of that,” Billy says, backing out of the room.
“No way out, as far as I can see,” Sherlock notes, and flexes his bound arms. “Not that I can get out of these.”
Sherlock rubs his fingers around the knotted scar tissue and says, keeping his voice low, “I started baking in rehab.”
Sherlock tries to hide his smile unsuccessfully behind his mug. “Shut up,” he says, fondness in each syllable.
Sherlock’s lips twitch, and he shrugs, trying for nonchalant. “I was bored. The chemistry master left the door to the laboratory unlocked. It was a terrible breach of safety protocol, and they should have been grateful to me for pointing it out.”
Slowly, very slowly, Sherlock blinks his eyes open and focuses on John. “What happened?” he croaks, letting John help him sit up so he can drink some water.
Sherlock goes completely still. He turns, very slowly, very deliberately, and his discerning, all seeing eyes focus on John with razor-sharp intensity. John feels that thing again, the coiling tiger, the cliff-edge feeling, and swallows.
The door opens and Sherlock rushes in. “John!”
“Don’t take it with you to the Watch, then,” John says and holds out his hand.
There’s no hesitation in his movements, no false starts, and from what little Sherlock can see of his face, he has a look of deep concentration yet deep abstraction, like he’s letting his hands perform an action he’s done a million times before without conscious thought.
John holds his gaze for a long time, then he smiles ever so slightly. “Good.”
John grins. “I lied,” he whispers.
John doesn’t move away. Sherlock doesn’t, either.
him anyway.
“Not good indeed,” Sherlock responds. Apparently he feels none of John’s reluctance, because he reaches out and grabs John’s hand, holding it tight. “We need to stay together no matter what,” he says, apparently feeling the need to justify himself.
Sent: 6:17 am
“What’s two dead girls more or less to you? Maybe I can even put in a good word for you with Jim. You boys want to go home, right? Well, Jim can make it happen.”
John can feel Sherlock nod against his shoulder. Then he says, “I think you should take the apprenticeship. Just in case.”
John grips Sherlock’s arm, staring at him in blind panic. His watch, his father’s precious watch.
“Will they need this to prosecute him?” John asks before pocketing the gun and handing Sherlock the fire iron he used to club the killer.
The black car draws up in front of the theatre, and Sherlock stubs out the cigarette and gets in.
“Attaching emotional value to food is the reason we’re all overfed,” Sherlock points out, waving his greasy, deeply unhealthy but delicious pizza around as illustration. “The food industry has found ways to ensure our food is filled with salt and sugar, the very chemicals that tickle our brain’s pleasure centres and trick us into feeling good when we eat. Therefore, we eat more to feel good more.”
Instead, John looked at him with the kind of deep, wordless anger Sherlock has only seen on him a very few, frightening times. And then John punched him in the face. And then he yelled at him, incoherently, calling him heartless and bastard and traitor and bastard again, how dare he just show up after a year, as if nothing happened, without a word, without an explanation. And then he went upstairs, packed a bag and left.
She sits down next to him on the small windowsill he’s perching against. For a moment, they smoke together in silence. Then she looks at him clinically. “So why did you really come to me last night?”
“Well.” Moran cocks his head to his side. “That’s about the best goddamned thing I’ve ever eaten in my life.”
“Of course not,” John answers automatically, but immediately after the words are out of his mouth he pauses, because honestly, he hasn’t given any thought to whether he
Sherlock swallows, and he can’t look at Victor, can’t say it without his throat closing up. “I left you there,” he finally gets out.
Sherlock carries Rosie down the stairs and right into his room, setting her down on his bed. “I think you’d better stay here tonight, Watson.”
“But why wasn’t it closed?” John says, stifling a yawn with effort.
They walk for a while in silence. They wind through the woods of Mr. Musgrave’s property and finally climb over the fencing that separates Mr. Musgrave’s woods from the neighbouring pasture.
He stares at John like his eyes are scalpels, wishes he could crack open John’s skull, and John stares right back, inscrutable, unreadable, unpredictable, and normally Sherlock likes this about John, that he’s sometimes as opaque as stone, but right now it’s infuriating, because he’s brilliant and radiant and high and John is ordinary and normal and Sherlock should be able to know what he’s thinking, but he isn’t.
Sherlock turns his head and looks at John, who’s looking back at him intently, worry lines prominent on his forehead. John swallows, and his fingers tighten on Sherlock’s arm. Some powerful emotion is wrestling for dominance over his features. Sadness, tiredness, anger, love. Or maybe Sherlock’s just projecting, because that’s how he feels right now.
“What Gate?” John asks.
He pauses briefly when the waitress deposits his coffee, then busies himself with stirring in too much sugar. Sherlock smirks a bit, because apparently, some things never change, and Victor is still trying to give himself a side of diabetes with his coffee.
“Figured it out?” John asks, smiling fondly at him.
“I was supposed to meet you, remember? You had something to do at the theatre, and I went home to get something or other. Mycroft was waiting at my flat, and he…”
Apparently, Janine picks up on his uncertainty, because her tone shifts from briskly businesslike to warmer. “Look. Whatever is going on between you, I know one thing for sure. You’re by far his favourite person in that tent.”
“So what you’re saying is I should sell a house I never use and don’t like anyway?”
“Anything,” John answers, breathless, desperate. “Anything.”
“Bakers, on your mark, get set, bake.”
They sink down on various couches and enjoy the silence for a few moments.
He spent his days in Mycroft’s basement, going over everything they had on Moriarty’s network, identifying weaknesses, preparing to destroy the spider’s web once and for all to reclaim his life for good.
Holmes looks up at John, irritated again. “I didn’t kill it, if that’s what you’re getting at!”
They both turn around to see a young man running after them. He's in his early twenties and has dark hair and dark eyes and he's very pale.
He still thinks of the room upstairs as John's, and he knows he always will. The mere thought of letting some stranger occupy John's space, sitting in his chair, drinking from his mugs... It's disgusting. And entirely irrational.
“There goes my train, I guess,” John says, checking his watch.
. I was homeschooled until I was nine, John. And I’ve been reliably informed that I’m an obnoxious, irritating know-it-all. I don’t
As soon as they’re in sight of the city gates, two guards come running towards them. They take one look at them and take Sherlock between them, half carrying him through the city streets. John has to run to keep up.
in this statement. He hears Mycroft’s voice in his memory, on a night long ago.
John grins. “So you’re here to prove to people that you don’t only know how
The two fairies exchange a few words in their odd, melodic language and then the one who spoke before says, “The Gate that brought you to Dera.” Her tone suggests that she thinks they're a bit slow.
John gets the bullet out and patches Sherlock up.
Normally, there’s a sense of controlled boredom in the room during the food porn shots.
