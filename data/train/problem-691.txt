Captain (retired) and Doctor John H. Watson-Holmes—no-nonsense adrenaline junkie, formerly of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers—was pregnant.
“Oh, fuck. Oh, John. God, yes!” Sherlock gasped, arching back into the pressure of John’s index finger completely buried inside him. He squeezed hard at the intrusion, and John’s eyes glazed over a little.
John sighed with relief and buried his nose in Sherlock’s neck, drawing in as much as he could of the lovely scent. “It aches, Sherlock.”
There was a muffled moan from the bed. John waited to see if Holmes — if that was indeed his name — would finally awaken. Instead, the man sighed and his head lolled back to one side.
John chuckled and Sherlock’s mouth turned up a little. Sherlock continued to watch him carefully, though.
John had no will to stop what was happening. Not really. He murmured his approval as Sherlock released his semi-hard cock. “Touch me. Please.”
Sherlock raised a brow. Clearly the thanks were for more than the tea. He dropped a quick kiss on John’s mouth and threw the covers back. He dragged a dressing gown over his shoulders and reached for a second to throw in John’s direction.
When they were gone, he shook his head at his own fanciful thoughts and sat down at his desk. He logged into his computer to prep for his first patient.
“Not right away, no. I was workin’ in America. Havin’ a grand old time with Magnussen’s people in New York. When I got Mam’s call about Jimmy, it took some time to sort myself out and get a job here in London. But when I did get settled, I looked up Jimmy’s old friends. That’s when I met Moran.”
Margaret departed the shrine to the Blessed Virgin, which John had confiscated for their special patient. With no papers, and with the unusual circumstances under which he had been brought to them, John’s superiors had deemed it best to keep the man separate from the rest of the ward — somewhere he could be carefully watched. The small alcove at the far end of the main sanctuary seemed the most logical spot.
The man laid the item on the velvet board on the counter between them. "Fantastic condition. The silver and inlays are immaculate. And the glass is probably the best I've seen for something like this from the 17th century."
John continued the process until Holmes was down to shirt, socks and trousers. The jittery young man had calmed considerably—had become almost subdued, if John were honest—and Ames was looking decidedly bored.
Sherlock nodded enthusiastically, watching in fascination as John shimmied up and then spun on his back until they were top to tail. “Oh! Oh, I see!”
Sherlock was casually flipping pages in an out-of-date National Geographic beside him. “Condoms—like many forms of birth control—have a limited effectiveness. They were the best option under the circumstances, but you know the numbers better than anyone.” He set the magazine on his lap, fussing with the corner of one page. “I’m…sorry. If I had noticed sooner, perhaps…” He hesitated, looking at John out of the corner of his eye. “We don’t have to do this.”
John’s other hand flattened over Sherlock’s chest under his parted shirt and then slid up along the length of his neck to cup his nape gently. Sherlock responded to the light pressure and eased down toward John. He watched with fascination as John licked his lips, and he did likewise. His heart fluttered a bit as John drew him in, and he felt as though he should close his eyes. But he didn’t want to miss a moment of the passion in John’s eyes. Passion for
John slid his hand along the inside of Sherlock’s thigh, which made Sherlock jump and instinctively clench his legs together. John’s hand froze in place, kneading the flesh gently.
Sherlock stood again, frowning, and shoved both hands in his pockets. “You’d have to ask her about the marriage, but I do think she was placed in your path for a reason.”
Sherlock set his napkin in his lap as he waited for their host to be out of earshot. “No drink?” he asked finally, watching John out of the corner of his eye.
“He was a maniac!” John shouted, clattering his teacup back onto the table beside the pot. “Was…” John repeated thoughtfully. “Was the broadcast his doing or is he dead?”
Sherlock peered over one shoulder, nostrils flared as he caught John’s scent. He spun and stalked toward the door, eyes narrowed and feral.
“Let’s wait and see,” John said softly. They all held their breath, watching as Bea’s eyelids fluttered and her little lips pursed…and then she went right on sleeping.
John kissed him, not so much to stem the tide of a tangent that had the potential to distract his young lover from more physical pursuits (though this was something John was beginning to realize might be a possibility) but because he could not resist Sherlock’s beautiful mouth when it was so full of clever, clever ideas. Sherlock bent to receive the kisses, stroking so deeply inside John’s mouth that John’s knees began to buckle. Sherlock held him firmly, with one hand clasped behind his head and one kneading his left buttock.
Every year, on the anniversary of that fateful meeting in the lab at Bart’s, a package arrives at the home of Dr. Mike Stamford.
John tugged up on Sherlock’s hips and slipped one strong hand underneath him, quickly finding Sherlock’s aching prick. John began to stroke in time with his own thrusts, nuzzling at the back of Sherlock’s neck.
John picked his head up and looked down between them…where his alpha was now smearing their merged fluids over both their bellies. John hated the sticky feeling, and he wasn’t—or at least he never had been—interested in the whole alpha territorial marking thing. But for some reason all he could do was smile fondly at Sherlock’s intensity in the task.
“Yeah, it bloody does,” John agreed. He kissed Sherlock’s cheek. “Sleep, love. I’ll take care of you.”
“Would you like that?” John asked, helping as Emily moved to climb into his lap. “For the three of us to live here together? Papa and Uncle Sherlock helping Uncle Greg, and Gran down the stairs. Would that be okay?”
“Keeping an eye on her?” Mycroft nodded soberly. “I will ensure that she is cared for and happy where she is. David had no idea about Mary’s past, if that helps. He’s suitably horrified.”
Sherlock nodded, not looking John in the eye. “I think Mary targeted you because of me. It’s my fault.”
“Uh, yeah. Really did,” John mumbled, forcing a smile. He glanced at the doctor but refused to meet Sherlock’s penetrating gaze.
John allowed himself to be settled onto the mattress. Sherlock held his hand and helped ease him back against the pillows. He rolled onto his side and shifted back against the wall to make space for his mate. He rubbed gently over the mound of his belly as he watched Sherlock quickly strip.
“Yeah,” John intoned, backing up against the closed door in an effort to put some distance between them. “Look—”
“Oh, Mary Morstan. Have I not said? She’s the new alpha sex surrogate we’ve hired for the clinic. Lovely woman.”
Sherlock’s cheeks flushed as he stared into John’s hungry eyes. He swallowed hard and nodded, and started down the stairs.
John crouched down to kiss Kit and let the boy hug his neck. “Goodbye, sweet boy. Love you. Be good for Uncle Mycroft, and for Gran and Grandad.”
John swallowed, glancing over to where Kit was entertaining Drew with his Barny Sponge Bear. “But…I’m still breastfeeding and Drew’s only nine months. I have at least six weeks before I have to start back on suppressants.”
“Oh, don’t look like that,” Sherlock groused, throwing himself back into the couch with a pout. “I’m not a psychopath.”
Sherlock had always spent considerable time on "legwork," as Mycroft had once called it. John knew that and accepted it as part of the work, and part of Sherlock's insatiable, restless curiosity. However, after the fall, Sherlock had begun to learn how important it was that John know and understand what he was up to. And where. After everything they had been through with Mary and Sherlock's weird family—particularly once they had finally come around to a romantic relationship—Sherlock had gotten better at providing John with FYIs.
“Ah, there we are,” the man said cheerfully. “All here now. If you would be so kind?” The man nodded at John’s weapon, which one of two new arrivals relieved him of.
John was mewling now; Sherlock knew his mate was close to coming. He wrapped his long fingers around John’s cock and begun to pump in rhythm with his thrusts.
“Let’s not worry about that now,” Sherlock said. “Why don’t I tell you about Victor? Though I warn you, it is the story of a romantic and sexual relationship between two men. Is that something you feel you can tolerate hearing?”
“I find you very attractive. So if you aren’t really attractive it means that my perception is flawed somehow.”
“No!” John shouted, moving to intercept as Greg took a step toward Sherlock. “No, he’s not. I promise you, Greg, he’s not on anything.”
“The game is never over, John,” Sherlock said, projecting for the cheap seats. Clearly he’d remembered the next bit. “But there may be some new players now. That’s okay. The East Wind takes us all in the end.”
“I know. I just—I can’t think about any of it right this minute. I need Sherlock to be well and home and I need some time to, I don’t know, wrap my head around everything.”
“Easy, now,” John urged. “Easy breaths. That’s it. You’re all right. I’m here, and I’m never leaving you again.”
The door to the crew room opened with a thud. A short woman in her mid-forties dressed in the standard issue uniform of the UK Border Agency slumped one shoulder against the doorjamb. John glanced up from his lunch.
John kissed the back of Sherlock’s neck. “Course not, you gorgeous thing.” He withdrew gently before thrusting back in once more.
They left the room separately and met up at the hospital’s service entrance where Mycroft had dispatched a non-descript delivery lorry. They connected with Mycroft once more and were informed that the tac team was en route. With their ground support on the way and air support on stand-by, John took the wheel to drive them the short distance west to the village of East Dean.
“Oh, god, what is it?” John cried as panic, fatigue and exasperation warred for pride of place. He stared down into the cot where his nearly six-month-old son, Christopher William, was sobbing inconsolably.
“Your phone. It’s expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player, but you’re on your way to live in Cornwall, so you wouldn’t waste money on this. It’s a gift, then. But it’s covered in scratches. Not one, many over time. It’s been in the same pocket as keys and coins. The man sitting across from me wouldn’t treat his one luxury item like this, so it’s had a previous owner. Next bit’s easy. You know it already.”
“No,” Sherlock replied, clearly considering something. “In fact…I play the violin. Sometimes I don’t talk for days. Would that bother you?”
John woke to the sound of the sitting room door creaking open. He sat up in his chair, blinking awake.
John moved one hand from behind his back to comb fingers through Sherlock’s hair. He tousled and stroked the curls, winding them around his hand and then releasing them to start again. Sherlock instinctively leaned into the caress, eyes closing with the delicious sensation of John’s hand against his scalp. Just as he was beginning to drift, the fingers tightened painfully. John held fast to a fistful of dark waves and tugged sharply, tilting Sherlock’s head back.
“I had to completely re-invent myself to survive. I turned myself into my brother to cope and yet, still—”
John moved them back toward the bed until Sherlock could feel the mattress bump against his legs. Refusing to let go of John, he scrambled backward. John followed, greedily chasing Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock stretched out dragging John down against him.
John drew back, sucking hard as the firm prick slid from his mouth. He held the crown between his lips, teasing at the fraenulum with his tongue for a few minutes before sliding back over Sherlock’s length. He began bobbing against Sherlock’s body, holding the man firmly by his thighs and massaging over the light dusting of coarse hair.
Sherlock’s chest rose with a deep breath and finally the dark head rolled on the pillow in John’s direction. John’s fingers twitched with a potent and wholly unbidden desire to run his fingers through the messy curls.
John watched, relieved and vastly amused, as Sherlock’s glower began to fade and his lips turned up into a smile. Before long, Drew and Sherlock were giggling like fiends. The music changed and Sherlock began to make funny noises along with the new tune.
Sherlock could feel sleep approaching, and he knew that neither of them were exactly comfortable (or wouldn’t be for long), but he was far too content to care.
He was whistling when he stepped out of the bedroom into the hallway. He could hear the tell-tale sounds of his family in the sitting room, and stopped in the kitchen doorway to admire the scene.
Mycroft could see the strain in his brother’s mate: the dark circles under his eyes were more pronounced and the lines around his mouth much deeper than they had been. His ever-present black jacket had tell-tale stains on the shoulder and his jeans were rumpled—he’d probably just pulled them on from the laundry pile. Hardly surprising, given…
Sherlock retreated from the kiss, heart pounding. Emily was standing right beside them, while Greg and Molly hovered in the doorway looking a little sheepish.
Sherlock hummed an acknowledgment of this information. “I am, of course, more aware of the slight traces of sweet citrus that have been growing since you joined me in your office.” Sherlock considered this. “An alpha in rut can trigger a heat, even in a suppressed omega.”
The tall man swallowed, his chin setting at a stubborn and—John thought—somewhat petulant angle. He shook his head.
“I think Drew is a beta. Granted, he could turn out to be an omega like me, but he doesn’t have the look about him. At least not now.”
John chuckled. “Do you know, I’ve never heard you use the word ‘babysitting’ to refer to looking after Drew and Kit.”
They talked for nearly five hours, closing down the wine bar and ending up walking a couple of blocks to a 24-hour coffee house. John relaxed into the evening, feeling the tension ease out of his shoulders at the comfortable rapport he still shared with Jeannette.
“Oh, yeah,” Greg said, rolling his eyes. “My sisters have been planning for weeks and this one—” he jerked his thumb in Mycroft’s direction. “Has been buying out every shop in London.”
John chuckled and leaned into Sherlock’s side, dropping his cheek to Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock revelled in the weight of John’s head against him, the subtle citrusy scent of him so close, the slightly too warm yet oddly addictive claustrophobia of their fingers twined tightly together. Sherlock wondered now how he had lived without these things.
“You know,” John began, “I have a good friend in the asthma and allergy clinic at Royal Brompton. They’re running new trials for kids and teens with asthma.”
Sherlock’s features relaxed and he nodded, immediately settling into the armchair opposite John. He crossed his legs and undid the buttons on his suit jacket. “This is fortuitous, you know, John,” Sherlock started cheerfully. “I’ve just finally been dismissed to return to town and with your address in my hand — from a friend at the War Office. I was going to come and see you tomorrow.”
Dr. Awiti took a deep breath. “John, I understand how frustrating this will be for you, but your life—and the life of your child—depends on you taking care of yourself.”
Sherlock’s cheeks took on a little more colour as he finished with the buttons and tugged the shirt from his waistband. He dragged it slowly over his shoulders and let it fall. John licked his lips as the pale flesh was revealed.
Sherlock bolted, dashing up the stairs, out into the back garden and the heavy rain that was now falling, and made for the lane. He kept running until he reached the main road and took out his phone to call a cab.
John nodded, and tugged up the bed he had brought in to sleep at Sherlock’s side. He snugged it in beside Sherlock’s bed and stretched out facing him. He took Sherlock’s hand once more and pressed it to his lips.
“I—” John swallowed hard, startled to feel his throat tightening and the tell-tale sting of tears. “Sherlock, I
“But you — you’re amazing,” John breathed. He traced a thumb over Sherlock’s mouth. “Brilliant and fearless and so very, very beautiful.”
He swiped a hand through his grey hair, which was a bit longer and shaggier than he usually kept it, and crossed the floor to sit heavily in his chair by the fire. His old man's chair, as Sherlock liked to call it.
He looked up at John, unable to conceal the raw need that spiralled out of control at the implication of the words. John still looked drug-addled; it was unlikely he would be able to make rational judgments, but — Sherlock couldn’t suppress a shiver at the thought of John taking him, taking control of him, holding him down.
“They adore you. Both of them. And I’m sure Archie’s plan to read chemistry at uni is all down to you.”
“Oh, you simply must do, Myc!” Margaret jumped in. “The baby will be about 12 months old then, when Greg goes back into his heat cycle. And we’d be happy to baby-sit, if you wanted to take Greg away on a honeymoon.”
Sherlock shook his head. “I am not enjoying your discomfort or the scent of your distress. However…well, you are beginning to smell very ripe, too. And, oh, John, you are so lovely.” Sherlock dragged an appreciative hand over John’s bared belly.
John licked his lips. “I…I need to take my stuff. Upstairs. Get settled. You know.” He gave a half smile and backed away as quickly as he could. He grabbed his bag and headed toward the stairs.
“Not that anyone could tell,” she sighed. “They need to do somethin’ about that entrance to the underground station at peak times.”
“Gregory,” Mycroft said warningly. He stepped in front of the omega and stooped to gather Kit into his arms. “Hello, Kit. Come and give Uncle Greg a kiss.”
John turned slightly, pulling his elbow from Mary’s grasp. “Mary? What’s going on here? Where is Margo?”
Sherlock pulled on his coat and dragged John to his feet. He grabbed the parcel he’d been carrying and pressed himself out of the way as John removed the spent condom and binned it, and tucked himself away.
Sherlock nodded vehemently. “They would have killed you. They had to believe I was dead or they were going to kill you and the baby.”
Lazily, he dragged one fingernail over the tip of John's nipple. He watched his lover's face carefully, but there was no response.
Sherlock groaned helplessly and ducked his head to pull one rosy brown peak between his lips. John gasped, head thrown back, at the exquisite pleasure that sparked though his body and made his cock throb.
Sherlock smiled and pressed his cheek against the side of John’s head. “Perhaps we should lie down?”
John moved in for another kiss; Sherlock met him halfway, eyes wide open. When they parted, John smiled at him.
“I suppose,” John answered. He turned through the school gate and out onto the pavement, Sherlock keeping pace beside him. “Why?”
John cocked his head as he regarded Sherlock’s expression—which Sherlock knew was probably very revealing.
“Yes, I realize it’s an inconvenience, but then so is spying on me. If you were really all that concerned, you could have intervened before I was taken for secondary inspection. Oh, if only you didn’t so disapprove of my little drug habit.”
John dragged both hands up and over Sherlock’s thighs and hips before trailing one fingertip over Sherlock’s hard prick.
“Oh, no need to look like that,” Sherlock griped. “I am aware...Anyway. Doesn’t mean I’ll ever say it again.”
Mary’s face fell ever so slightly. “I-I always hoped to have children myself one day. Give up surrogacy and settle down. I still haven’t found the right person, I guess.”
Sherlock continued to stare at the potential instrument of correction clasped in John’s hand. Almost immediately, he began to imagine the sound the leather would make against his bare flesh. He could visualize the marks; how the red welts would look on his pale skin. His cock twitched and a few beads of pre-come appeared at the tip.
“I-I want to apologize for my behaviour. Before,” Sherlock started, ignoring the question. “I am not — I have never been very good with people. I sometimes blurt things out when I notice them, without thinking. I didn’t mean to offend you.”
They were together in the back of Francine’s Rover. She was busy trying to follow the satellite navigation system’s instructions to the second house—Gutteridge’s place.
Still swimming in a wash of pheromones, John offered no resistance as he was lifted from the floor and swung up into Sherlock’s arms. Sherlock did not stumble with the additional weight; adrenaline had given him strength beyond the capacity of his slender frame. John clung to him and murmured praise of his own.
“Shhh, I know,” Sherlock soothed. He sucked at the tender flesh beneath John’s ear and his fingers brushed over John’s nipples.
“Not exactly, but that’ll do,” Sherlock mused. He kissed the boy and set him back down, leaning in then to press his lips to John’s cheek. “Do we need to do this?”
John couldn’t help but smile, even as he continued grinding his needy body into his alpha. “Fill me. I need it.”
Sherlock laughed lightly, glancing up at him from beneath his lashes. “We, uhm, we don’t have much time before we reach Reading.”
John thumbed at Sherlock’s slit, now dewy with pre-come. Sherlock emitted a high-pitched whine; his hips began to lift from the sofa. John stilled his hand.
There was no question he’d been a rubbish boyfriend, but even after all these years, the things they had in common—which had drawn them together in the first place—were still there. A love of thriller novels. Movie comedies. Pink Floyd. Rugby (The Saracens). Jeanette was still as funny and clever as she always had been. Had he not already been hopelessly in love with Sherlock back when they’d first met, he might have been able to appreciate how amazing she really was.
John reached for his mouse and started clicking through Mr. Huang's chart in the patient information system. "I'll print off the referral for you and have the front desk make the appointment. They'll ring you with the date and time."
“I-I think so. But he’s never shown any sign of wanting anything like this. And he’s never spoken about it since—my heat. He acts as though it never happened. It’s not like he’s an overly emotional sort…well, you would know. You’ve got one of your own.”
John’s brow furrowed as he selected another cheese and pickle sandwich. He took a bite, wondering at how unaccountably hungry he was for a Saturday lunchtime. “Has it? Can’t think why.”
John hesitated. Lestrade still hadn’t told Mycroft about his own pregnancy and therefore had been putting off telling anyone else. “’Kay.”
Greg waved at one of the women in uniform. She turned and sent the signal on out into the hallway. Moments later, Sherlock strode briskly into the room. He made a beeline for John, who was already reaching for him.
More than two hours later—dinner arrived and consumed and the entire case laid bare, in addition to the details of each of John's patients throughout the day—John finally rose from their comfortable position on the sofa.
“As big as I thought you were,” Sherlock growled. He arched his hips off the bed, pressing his own aching cock into John’s thigh.
By now the scuffle had drawn restaurant staff in addition to the already gawping customers at nearby tables. “Sir, I’m afraid we cannot allow this kind of territorial behaviour in our establishment,” the young woman—clearly the manager—said sternly. “I’ve been on to the police and I’m going to have to ask you to leave immediately.”
“Hmm? Oh. No, this is number three,” he said with a fond smile, glancing down at the slight swell which was only just beginning to make itself known. He rubbed his belly and sighed. “Which is part of the reason I restrict my time with the practice.”
“Unca Greg!!” Kit immediately slid to the floor from John’s arms and ran to his uncles. Greg caught him up and gave him a noisy kiss before turning him so Mycroft could peck the boy on the cheek.
Sherlock sat on the edge of the bed and pulled Drew into his lap. “I’m glad you got to have this one your way.”
He slid up once more, allowing the slicked silicone to slide almost completely free of his body before arching his hips back to take it inside once more, grunting as the knot pushed against his rim. He shivered at the glorious friction of the toy against his inner walls. He squeezed his nipples with his free hand and rubbed over the head of his cock as he established a rhythm. He slapped back against the cold tiles, speeding up the pace of his fingers over his prick as he did.
“Yes, really. He has a knack for it. He’s…weirdly patient. I don’t know why. But I don’t question it. The boys have both responded to his method and as long as I stick with the program…mostly it works.”
Kit nodded vigorously. He clasped John’s hand, nudging his baby brother to do the same. Drew mumbled something that sounded like “Dada luv” and pressed his little face into John’s chest. John let himself sink into the sofa.
Mary shook her head. “I knew you wouldn’t come without a very good reason. And you are such a good doctor—so caring and so gentle. I certainly want you to continue practicing after we bond.”
“John, please,” Mycroft began. “There are things Kit needs. Things I can help to provide for him. Please allow me to do that.”
“Well, maybe once we’ve had our tea—and a slice or two of toast—we can retire to the bedroom and you can do your best to keep me convinced.”
He was staring at his feet when the well-polished oxfords suddenly appeared beside them. A long-fingered hand—fine-boned and elegant like his own—landed on his shoulder. It was a little awkward, as it was indicative of the kind of familial sentiment neither of them had engaged in since they were children. Still, the intention was understood.
“Jesus, Sherlock!” John stood abruptly. He knew his face reflected the rib-crushing pain in his chest. “You deserve so much more than I can give you. So much more than I am.”
He arched into John’s body as John rolled on top of him. His pelvis pressed upward, aching for contact with—
As the haze cleared, Sherlock crawled to where John had fallen with an injured soldier just beginning to rouse beside him. Sherlock eased John onto his back and blanched at the amount of blood he had lost. John reached up for Sherlock.
“Sorry,” he mumbled finally, gradually easing out of William’s arms. He gave his face another going over with the hanky. “I shouldn’t have—”
John nodded firmly, handing their coats over to the hostess. “Absolutely. This is our chance for a do-over.”
“She’ll be okay, but—damn it all to hell!!” John spat. “Why must people be like this? Why can’t they just accept and love their kids the way they are?”
“No, not ‘check up on,’” Molly defended. “He just mentioned that Emily would be here with you and it might be a good chance for us to see her. That’s all.”
He wasn’t sure how he got to his feet, but he managed an enthusiastic nod (he didn’t trust himself to speak). The next thing he knew, John’s shoulder was hitting him in the gut as the captain bent double before him and slung him handily over one shoulder.
John thrust once, twice more, and Sherlock could feel the addition of John’s come all over their bellies. They held each other tight as they shook through the aftershocks.
“Good,” John called back. He checked his watch and reached for the stick. He took a deep breath and looked for the plus sign.
“But even if it wasn’t anything more than that, it helped me see that you do…feel things. From that moment, I decided to maybe find out where it might lead,” John continued with a sniffle. “But just as I was about to chuck a lifetime’s worth of conditioning, you were gone.”
Time froze; John allowed himself to drown in the feeling of Sherlock’s body so near his own, and the feel of silky dark hair against his brow.
The doctor sat and swung her chair around to face them, flipping open the file on the desk in front of her. “Well, I have some good news.”
. I’m a doctor and I have no idea how to help him. I’m useless…” John trailed off as tears welled up once more. He allowed them to come, unashamed of the noise he was making. It hurt. It hurt so badly that he couldn’t imagine how he would survive.
The corner of his mouth turned up in a half smile. He hurried inside, quickly dispensing with his coat. Up the stairs, two at a time, and then...
John nodded. Sherlock stood beside the exam table and wrapped an arm around his shoulders. John let his head fall onto his mate’s shoulder.
Sherlock sagged with relief that John was not going to make him wait. He lifted fumbling fingers to the buttons and zip of the uniform trousers, hurriedly undoing them. He struggled with John’s snug white briefs for a moment, finally pulling the clothing down enough to free John’s cock.
Sherlock stared at the painting. It was just a head, stripped bare of all of life’s masks. It had no heart.
Sherlock’s head drooped, his brow coming to rest on John’s shoulder as he melted into John’s caress. He moaned and gasped and bucked his hips as John pleasured him. John whispered endearments into his ear — all the things he’d dreamed of being able to say.
John’s cock hardened instantly and he reached for Sherlock with a moan. He clasped Sherlock by the back of the neck and dragged the man’s mouth to his own. It was sloppy and a little desperate, but Sherlock clung to him, parting his lips for John’s tongue.
John stuffed the last of his clothes in the hamper; they did far more laundry than they ever had before. Today Kit had managed to spill juice in his lap and get grubby fingerprints all over the front of his jumper. Not that he would have it any other way. Kit was happy and healthy, and John delighted in every single sticky kiss.
Sherlock was far too invested in the feeling of John’s hands on his skin to care. He moaned and pressed his own burgeoning erection into the wall.
He shifted and slid back down to the mattress, careful not to disturb John. He lay on his side and propped one arm under his head so he could study the man in his bed.
“I’ve been asked to tell you that it was a misunderstanding and to insist that you accompany me to the Holmes residence.”
John left the delivery van in the hospital’s underground parking garage and made his way to the next floor via freight elevator. The NHS pass on his jacket gave him entry to the staff change room. He let himself in and made his way to locker 458. Inside, he found a bag. He took it with him to the toilets and exchanged his delivery uniform for scrubs. There was also a moustache—John made a mental note to kick Mycroft’s arse the next time he saw him.
Mycroft strolled into his office, still studying the package of documents from his last meeting. He stopped abruptly only two steps into the room.
“Oh, I’m so glad,” Margaret said. She looked down at the man in the bed beside John. “It’s such a shame…”
John understood, of course. He knew perfectly well that Sherlock was not a sociopath—he simply lacked (or had grown used to ignoring) social filters. In the time they had been living and working together, it had become clear that Sherlock was interested in learning some of these skills from John—he trusted John to do this for him. And John, even so early in their relationship, could deny him nothing.
Sherlock came, breathing halted and eyes squeezed shut against the overwhelming data flooding his brain. John said his name.
“Yes, I realize you probably already know what’s happened, and that you pretty much know where I am and what I’m doing most of the time—except, by the by, when I’m being kidnapped by lunatics to be blown up or cremated.”
John released the button on the intercom and straightened the piles on his desk. Most of it was correspondence — which he hated dealing with — but there were some unfinished notes from his last patient. He tucked them into a drawer to be handed over for the transcriptionist at the end of the day.
“Oh, come on,” Sherlock urged. “You’re going to kill us anyway. Why not just give me the satisfaction?”
He stood as the door opened for a tall, distinguished gentleman in a conservative three-piece suit. The man walked toward John, an umbrella hooked over one arm.
Mycroft made his way to the door where an attractive beta was waiting with his coat. He turned back before stepping through the front door.
John jolted awake at the shout erupting from his patient. He mentally cursed himself for having dozed off, jumping a little when the young man’s eyes suddenly snapped open.
John hurried behind him, keeping his head down. He looked back just in time to see the weapon raised in their direction.
John stepped in close, the unmistakable bulge in his trousers nearly at Sherlock’s eye level—which was not lost on the detective.
It should be fantastic news. As a healthy, suppressed omega there was no reason not to enjoy his planned semi-annual heat—though it was not when it would have been, given the recent “reset” of his cycle. That he had spent the last few weeks preparing to make this a bonding heat, well, that was just the icing on the cake, really.
“Here we are,” Angelo said, pulling out one of the chairs at the small table. It was tucked into a nook, which would leave them just out of sight of most of the busy restaurant. The table was covered with a scarlet runner and had a small vase with two calla lilies. “Will you be needing a candle this evening?” Angelo asked cheekily.
Kit regarded her very solemnly, glancing around once to look at his daddy for some kind of reassurance. John smiled at him, willing himself to stay positive for his son’s sake. Margaret pressed her suit, grasping the baby under his arms and beginning to lift him away from John’s embrace. Kit went quietly, if not enthusiastically.
“Oh, god,” Sherlock groaned. He glared at his brother, who’d made a terribly satisfied gloating noise.
The noise Sherlock made could probably be called a whimper, if it could be called anything at all. The last barrier separating him from the tsunami of his “transport” crumbled instantly.
Shaking, Sherlock kissed a trail from John’s mouth over the plane of one craggy cheek and into the greying hairline. “Please,” he whispered.
Sherlock made what could only be described as something of a squeaking noise in the back of his throat.
The uncomfortable tightness in John’s gut settled a bit at that thought. He turned once more to deal with the misguided youth occupying his space. “He’s my mate and you’re sitting in my chair. Don’t say a word, just get up and take yourself off.”
John sighed, and dropped into his new reclining chair. “I know. And I meant it. It’s good for her. She’s a serious little thing, and she’s been raised by two workaholics. God knows she could use some perspective.”
“Oh, John,” Sherlock breathed. He tangled the fingers of one hand in John’s shirt, right over his chest.
“S’fine,” Sherlock said mildly. He waited as the machine ran through its program three times and then recorded the data.
“And you are all mine,” John echoed, digging his fingers into Sherlock’s hair and giving a gentle tug as he pulled Sherlock toward him for more kissing.
Sherlock pulled off John’s cock with a slurp. “Patience, my love.” He shifted John’s hips up, dropping John’s legs over his shoulders, and mouthed over John’s small testicles. He suckled and teased for a moment and then nosed into John’s cleft. He dragged his tongue over the saturated and swollen hole.
“Yes. Best be off,” Mycroft said. “Come along, Kit. I’ve brought your favourite building blocks. You can play with them in the car.”
“Good,” Sherlock grunted at last, clambering to his feet. He stared at John for a moment — with perhaps a trace of clarity beneath the fog of his rut — before bending to kiss him.
What seemed like ages later, he finally looked up to see his mate entering the room with a plastic shopping bag.
John smiled as he listened to his bondmate chatting with their oldest son all the way down the stairs. Like two peas in a pod. Drew whimpered a little as John manoeuvred his arms through the seat harness and fastened it snugly.
John understood immediately and shifted his hips. He gasped at the first touch of foreskins. Sherlock slid them together with a shattered breath.
John kissed Sherlock hungrily, scrabbling for some hold on his alpha from his position on his back. Sherlock grasped at the seeking hand and laced their fingers together. He pushed John’s hand back into the mattress and held it there briefly. The restraint was not forceful or painful—John could easily have broken the hold if he wished. Sherlock released his hand, but John left it where it was on the bed. If John were with a random alpha, as he had been on occasion back in the days before he was bonded, he’d have held his strength in reserve in case it was needed. But with Sherlock, the man he loved, he had no fear. He had never felt trepidation in his alpha’s arms, not from their very first heat together as near strangers.
Sherlock tugged his pants and trousers back into place and hurriedly stuffed his shirttails back in. “There is a better than good chance that I will be carrying human remains without the appropriate permits.”
“No, I’m sorry,” John sighed. He rubbed a weary hand over his brow. “I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’m acting like a prick.”
“I do, though. I don’t hate you, though perhaps I should. And I don’t want anything to happen to you. Either of you.”
John nearly fell to the ground. His eyes welled, in spite of himself. Margaret, to her credit, said nothing. She smiled at him kindly and gestured for him to follow her into the house.
“Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock started, rising. “Would you happen to have any freshly baked biscuits down in your flat?”
“Biscuits? Well, I made some last night. Why…” She trailed off as she watched the look exchanged between the two men. “Here, now, Kit, why don’t you and Drew come downstairs with Nan and we’ll have some biscuits and watch that funny program of yours, hmm?”
“Nor me,” Sherlock agreed. He placed a series of soft kisses over John’s shoulder. “We belong together.”
He checked his phone and located a hotel nearby. The Morton was just across the square. It would be expensive, but it didn't matter. He needed sanctuary.
John did not take his eyes from Sherlock as he swiftly stripped himself. As his shirt hit the floor, Sherlock could not resist reaching out. His breath caught at the feel of John’s skin beneath his fingers.
John fled, not waiting to see if anyone would follow. He managed to find his way to the washroom before the tears came. He braced himself against the sink as he fought to stifle the sobs that shook his body. His knuckles turned white where they gripped the porcelain.
“Kit’s body knows his alpha parent is still alive. Whatever you did to trick my system into thinking Sherlock was dead, it didn’t work on the baby."
Out of habit, he glanced back at the machines beeping out the cadence of Sherlock Holmes’ life — the life that had very nearly been…
“All of it: Rules, regulations, uniforms, working with simple-minded idiots…oh, don’t look like that. I didn’t mean you.”
Sherlock jumped into the passenger seat and slammed the door. He really didn’t want to discuss why he’d rescued the painting. It was illogical. Of all the things for him to have grabbed, this item made the least sense.
At the first brush of his fingertips against Sherlock’s cock, John began to tremble. He had never touched another man sexually, and — while he wanted it more than he had been able to admit, even to himself — the newness of it was nearly overwhelming.
“Well, yes,” Margaret sighed, pausing to pat Kit’s head and smile down at a still-sleeping Drew. “They had. Only Mycroft had some sort of fit yesterday and decided nothing they’d bought for Emmeline was ‘good enough.’ He’s had this poor girl on the telephone all night sorting out a new cot and other furnishings.”
John shook his head, unaware until that moment that he'd been expecting to hear Mycroft Holmes' voice. Sherlock's brother had been an omniscient omnipresence in their lives for so long that he'd almost forgotten: Mycroft had been retired for eight years.
John snorted and tried to smile. “How’s yours?” He looked at the man beside him critically. “You look like you lost a fight.”
Sherlock settled next to John and shifted as close as he could get as John's arm slipped around his shoulders. He sighed and leaned into John's side.
“Good boy,” John soothed, caressing the abused flesh with his fingers. “You can be such a good boy for me, I know it.”
As they had deliberately gone through his heat without protection, he’d felt it wise to start taking the supplements beforehand, though they had only just had their first visit with the midwife.
“Yeah, fine. Just a particularly good kick.” He grinned at John in the mirror. “I think she’s going to be a striker.”
William’s brow furrowed once more, and he looked as though he might say something. He changed his mind, though, nodding noncommittally and opening the door.
“You look great,” John promised, standing with a bit of a wobble before making his way to stand behind his friend. “They really are going to love you, Greg. The Holmes’ aren’t nearly as frightening as they seem. Remarkably normal, actually.”
He feasted his eyes on Sherlock’s familiar form—stunned that after years together, he could find his alpha as achingly attractive as he had the day they first met. Though John rarely thought about their age difference, sometimes it was brought home when he realized how much Sherlock had changed from the very young man he had been when they bonded. Age had given the boyishly lean frame some wiry tone and his limbs were taut and shapely. The dark hair on his chest, while still sparser than on many alphas, had filled in a little. The laugh lines John had once foreseen had begun to form around the changeable eyes.
“Not exactly,” Sherlock said swiftly. He turned back to Angelo. “Just water for me as well, thanks.”
“I will restrain myself,” Sherlock sighed. “Ponies, stuffed bears, those strange little block things…”
“Well, obviously I knew his intention was to get you to jump. I didn’t know…he didn’t tell me about the gun.”
“It isn’t all that serious, so they tell me. However they needed him unconscious to get at the debris from the explosion and do some stitching. It isn’t terribly deep—no risk of any brain damage—but enough for significant blood loss.”
John shifted the baby back into the crook of his arm and settled him against his exposed breast. Kit perched up on his knees so he could watch as the baby latched on and began to suckle.
“I know,” John said, winking at him. “Mine, too.” He reached over and deposited a couple of spears of cucumber onto Kit’s plate. “Mind you eat the veg as well.”
Sherlock captured John’s mouth with a whimper. He kissed him until they were both breathless. “Yes, yes, yes. I would do anything to make you happy. And this…oh, John. I’ll be here. I’ll do everything.”
Sherlock grinned, pausing to kiss him once more, and then slid back down. He wasted no time before sucking John back into his mouth. John arched off the bed at the slightly too enthusiastic approach. He writhed as Sherlock quickly settled into a perfectly wonderful rhythm—the man would undoubtedly be an expert in no time at all.
John noted that she did not bring menus as she led him toward the back of the small, dimly lit space. It had clearly been designed for intimacy. The deep booths with high backs were private—even as they passed the tables that were occupied, he could barely make out the conversations. In a secluded corner, set apart from the rest of the restaurant by an archway and an artfully draped curtain, she stopped.
“About an hour ago, when I first noticed. I went online to the Royal Omega Health Centre’s website.”
“But I want everything, John. I want to feel as intimately attached to you as it is possible to be.”
The intercom crackled and John winced at the reference to his booked time off. As of this last Friday night, Dr. Mike Stamford would be covering his practice for nine days. Mike was a good friend from medical school and an excellent doctor. He taught Gender Medicine at Bart’s these days, but was happy to provide relief for John’s patients while John was away.
John watched her leave, hating himself but unable to look away from the grace of her figure as she moved. After a few minutes, he shook of the pleasant reverie of the rare good times that had been part of his brief relationship with Jeanette and returned his focus to the task ahead: repairing his marriage.
John grabbed for Sherlock’s right hand and pressed it into his thigh. He clasped it there and tried to smile. Sherlock returned the lop-sided effort.
John praised him, told him what a good and clever and strong alpha he was. He murmured his affection and desire as his mate lavished attention on first one small mound and then the other.
Strong arms closed around him, and John shattered. He accepted the embrace gratefully, leaning into William’s familiar shape and burying his face in the comforting cardigan. The scent was all wrong, of course—omega, not alpha—but there was enough of Sherlock there that it felt like home. He clung to the older man and sobbed.
“Oh, and about the hands-on experience?” John began. “Don’t worry about it. I think you’re going to be brilliant.”
A stern-faced, older beta man at the next table jumped to his feet. “Just leave them be and get some help, for goodness’s sake!” he snapped.
“I spoke with his brother earlier. Mr. Holmes seemed to think you would be the one to bring our patient ‘round; talk him into resting and giving himself a chance to heal.”
“Honestly, how stupid would someone have to be to attempt to carry drugs through an international border?”
Sherlock sat at his desk and swivelled to stare at John. “There is nothing wrong with focusing on work.”
Sherlock kissed John once more and then removed his fingers. He turned his mate gently and bent him over the edge of the bed. John groaned into the duvet, fingers fisting into the fabric as Sherlock parted his legs, hitched up his hips and drove inside him.
“Oh, she loves us. Desperately. And she wants us to be proud of her. But she has no interest in the strange sort of life that we lead. She likes going to parties and spending time with friends. She wants to be an artist.”
“Yes, of course,” Mary breathed. She bent in and kissed John’s cheek. “You’re so clever. My lovely, clever omega. How lucky I am!”
John unlocked the door to the small en suite and took a step back to lean on the small bureau against the opposite wall. William shuffled in and closed the door behind him, leaning back against it. He extended his hand to John; there was a clean hanky in it.
“Connor—Jimmy—and I were born five years apart. Same mother; different fathers, of course.” Janine handed Sherlock his cup and then returned to her chair. John watched with some pleasure as Mary served herself and returned to the window.
It was a reminder of a brother who went to great pains for him, though Sherlock was seldom as grateful for the attention as he might be.
“I’m a middle-aged man and a wounded veteran and I’ve been sleeping on the hard floor all night,” John said ruefully. “I’ve just realized that it’s probably going to take me an hour to get moving.”
Fingers were probing the slick now dripping from his cleft and down over his thighs. John’s retreating conscious mind registered that it was too soon for that. It was too fast.
Sherlock had settled on his back and John was now hovering over him, head propped by one elbow. John was smiling, and the crinkles at the corners of his eyes made him look even more handsome. And happier. He reached out with his free hand and brushed the backs of his knuckles over Sherlock’s cheekbone.
“This was the right decision, John. I would prefer to keep the use of my legs, if I can. I am willing to chance it, though I will deeply regret it if anything happens to you on my account.”
Francine led them to a silver Land Rover and unlocked the doors. “You’ll meet with the producer and the presenter first thing in the morning. We’ve got Michael back again!”
“Something we didn’t expect. He told us about Mary’s slow turn from the CIA and about the mysterious new employer she’d found. The descriptions he gave, well…it didn’t take us long to put all the pieces together.”
His cock throbbed with need and his entire body was pliant. This was his alpha. His alpha. His own. Sherlock would mount him, and pleasure him and service him, just as he would service his alpha’s rut. They belonged to each other.
“Thank you so much,” the young man said, his voice dripping with gratitude. He dragged John behind him up the stairs. He glanced at the ticket briefly and turned to their left down the narrow corridor.
“Ye — ” John’s voice cracked. “Yes. Yeah. I’m here.” He slid forward again as the dark head turned toward him. “Sherlock.”
Sherlock held his hands up in defeat. “I admit it. This sort of thing has never been my strong suit. Fortunately, Kit is kind enough to let me play with him anyway.”
Sherlock gasped as John found a spot where the head of Sherlock’s cock was rubbing firmly into his hip.
John’s soft laughter rumbled in his chest. “I think maybe we should take a minute to, uhm…” He tugged at Sherlock’s jacket.
Sherlock’s fingers moved from where they had been firmly gripping John’s upper arms. He reached down and began fumbling with the fastening of John’s trousers.
He was lying on his side, one hand propping up his head, watching John sleep. John was lying, as usual, flat on his back with one hand beneath the duvet and one over top. He always ended up in that position, regardless of how tangled up they were when they fell asleep. Sherlock didn't mind—his own most comfortable position involved mostly sprawling over John's supine form, with one leg draped over John's thighs and his head on John's shoulder.
John was stretched out beside him, lying flat on his back, with the covers tucked neatly under his right arm and pulled over his left. His head was tipped slightly in Sherlock’s direction and his mouth was open a fraction. He wasn’t snoring, but there was a little whistling noise as he breathed in sleep. It was disturbingly adorable.
“…and when I saw you from the bar, I just had to take a chance and come over. I mean, you’re easily the best looking alpha I’ve ever seen and—” The boy stopped in the middle of his chat-up and looked at John. “Yes?”
With a firm nod, Sherlock considered his options. He elected to do the most expedient thing—which would bring him closest to John—and dropped to his knees at John’s feet.
“What’s her name?” Kit asked, reaching out one tentative finger to touch the back of the baby’s tiny hand.
“I know,” Sherlock moaned, placing kitten kisses over the side of John’s face. One hand slipped between them and smoothed reverently over John’s belly. “You smell fertile. Bred. Mmmmine.”
John peered over Sherlock’s shoulder at the short, well-dressed man before them. There were two more thugs behind him, one at each arm. The man was seated on a large piece of luggage, with his legs crossed. He was dark haired and fairly dark skinned, with a well-groomed moustache, but the accent didn’t sound South American to John.
John slumped back into his chair. His patient was smiling now — Sherlock Holmes was very, very pleased with himself.
“Well, I don’t know what’s happened between you, but as someone who’s been in the wars let me just say this: Fight hard.”
Sherlock had tilted his chin up, not wanting to impede John’s tender exploration. “Just…about the bed. Being messy. And my experiment in the kitchen. And whether I might have condoms or anything. Also what the cabbie said earlier–”
Sherlock bolted from his chair to follow John to the door. “Tomorrow? But we have to go through the emails from the Singh case!”
Sherlock’s expression was a high-speed shuffle from confusion to annoyance to desperation as the tall woman approached his bed. John had to look away. He could feel Sherlock’s eyes on him, then, as the doctor joined them. Sherlock had heard him. He must have.
It galled him to think he might have to postpone his planned gloating text to Lestrade, but it couldn’t be helped. He’d have to try again, preferably on someone else. For now, he’d have to figure out how to bring John down before sending him home.
Sherlock wet his lips with the tip of his tongue. Even thinking about them made his mouth water. It was strange to think that in the few short months they had been engaged in a sexual relationship, he had become so enamoured of this one particular feature. Fondness, he called it. Preference.
“My own recovery was not without…problems,” Sherlock admitted. “I have been in considerable pain, as you might imagine. And I had so little to think about at first — I was so desperately bored, John. I began taking more and more of the morphine to ease the way. I found, when I had mostly healed, that I could not do without it.”
“If I’m going to get through this…” John let his eyes roam over Sherlock’s figure-hugging shirt. The plum-coloured one. His very, very favourite.
It was Sherlock’s turn to murmur endearments, humming delicious words proclaiming the stoutness of John’s heart and the depth of his wisdom and the exquisite beauty of his body. “So ripe. So lush,” he murmured stroking reverently over the place where their child was growing.
?” A deep crinkle appeared above Sherlock’s nose. “John, I didn’t want you to meet my parents because I didn’t want you to…you know.”
“Easy, now. I’ll get that,” John soothed. He dragged his fingers through Sherlock’s curls—something they both loved. He worked on his jeans and was soon tugging them off.
John’s fingers twined in dark curls as he pulled Sherlock into another kiss. Sherlock tried to concentrate this time—to catalogue every sensation of John’s lips—but it was no use.
“You’re so...smooth,” Sherlock marveled, experimentally squirming against John’s naked body. He could feel the heat and girth of John’s erection against his belly and he shivered. “You really are.”
"We slowed his heart, to the point of stopping it. Sherlock was unconscious on the pavement, and for hours afterward. By the time he woke, you were out of immediate danger from the complications of the birth. To turn back then would have put you and the baby at risk..."
It was a fairly open and shut case: a kidnapping that had resulted in a standoff. The police had been unwilling to advance, as the kidnapper had been threatening his young victim, but John and Sherlock had already found their way inside the building. Sherlock had never been prouder of his mate than he was at that moment—John had drawn and fired without a second thought. His aim was extraordinary, hitting the kidnapper right between the eyes. The man had died before he could do any harm to the boy in his grasp.
“Dunno. When you saw the place was listed and cooked up this scheme, I did make sure to include specific details in our programme application that would ensure we’d get his place on our list. Unfortunately, the producers haven’t said anything about the sellers of the places we’re to look at.”
“Until this moment, I have had very little to live for, actually,” John corrected. He squeezed the fingers wrapped around his hand. “You have no idea how empty I have been, Sherlock. It’s not just the nightmares and the loneliness — my injuries mean I shall never practice again. Not really. What am I going to do? A surgeon whose hands shake? A soldier with a limp? What else am I fit for?”
“The corps will be shipped out for much-needed rest. We’re to go on ahead; most of the patients have already been evacuated as you know — it’s just the amputees and your mystery man, there.” Hastings thrust his chin in the direction of the shrine.
John shrugged, popping the last of his toast in his mouth. “Maybe someday,” he said finally. “I don’t know. What about you?”
The man had nearly raven hair, worn in Romantic waves. He was dressed in a dark suit, covered by a dramatic wool overcoat that flowed out behind him as he hurried along. His face was long, punctuated by sharp cheekbones and softened by a full mouth, which was currently drawn into a tight line.
He made his way to the Victorian hotel on Woburn Place. He checked in on autopilot, mechanically answering the cheerful night clerk's questions. Key in hand, he found his room and closed the door behind him.
, shaking his head. With Mycroft’s help, Sherlock had arranged for new furniture to be delivered and set up early that morning. A child-sized canopy bed had been made with green crushed velvet throw and dust ruffle and a garden print duvet. An antique wardrobe decorated with hand-painted Peter Rabbit sat in the corner, and a bookshelf (fully stocked with Beatrix Potter, Dr. Suess, Jean de Brunhoff, Kenneth Grahame, A.A. Milne, E.B. White, Roald Dahl, J.M. Barrie, Lewis Carroll, Maurice Sendak, C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and J.K. Rowling) had been placed by the door. A refinished antique chair upholstered in a red check sat by the bed, and the walls had been decorated with original Potter prints and willow branch wreaths. There was a soft, fluffy carpet covering the floorboards and frilly curtains over the window.
“Of course I remember a conversation we had three weeks ago,” Sherlock huffed. “I just don’t see why you’re so giddy. It’s fake. We’re just pretending.”
In fact—John mused, as he let his palm rest on Sherlock's lean abdomen and rise and fall with each slumbering breath—this was only their fourth time sharing a bed. Confessions made and desperate first kisses aside, they had decided to take things slowly. Physical intimacy was not the only kind of intimacy, and they both had some adjusting to do.
“Me, too,” John hummed happily. “We—oh wait a minute. I very nearly forgot. Janine! Did they find her body in the rubble?”
He reached across the table and took Sherlock’s hand. “Yeah. Okay. Let’s just do this the way we used to. Just you and me. Nothing else matters, just for now.”
When he finally alighted and stepped out onto the pavement, the light was beginning to fade. He ignored the encroaching dusk and began to walk. He stared up into the windows of the buildings as he passed, trying to imagine Sherlock’s face in one of them.
“Ask me for what you want,” John prompted. He rubbed his hands up and over Sherlock’s hips to massage over the lean torso.
“I know,” Mycroft agreed. “I’ve checked the paediatrician’s records as well. Kit’s doctor is concerned about his upset—the interrupted sleep patterns and decreased appetite—and his height and weight. She’s been vaguely referencing ‘failure to thrive,’ and there are some unpleasant suspicions about John’s abilities as a parent. I fear that if we cannot help John with Kit’s health we may be facing a much more serious situation.”
“Now listen, you,” Mummy hissed, tugging on the arm around which she had wound her own. “This exhibition was your father’s special request for his birthday. I won’t have you ruining it with your sulking.”
The wicked gleam in Sherlock’s eyes faded a little at John’s pleased, comfortable and accepting tone. He bit his lip again—which seemed to be the only indicator of uncertainty in the brash young detective.
John mewled a little as he tugged down his trousers and pants, now dampened by his body’s response to the alpha’s call. With the quick removal of socks and shoes, he was now naked.
“We don’t have to stay,” John offered. “We just wanted to come by to welcome Emmeline home and see if you needed anything.”
Janine shrugged her jacket on, passing her gun between hands as she did. “And when they get here, they’ll find a smolderin’ crater where this cottage used to be.” Janine beamed at Sherlock, pointing to the wires hidden along each of the ceiling beams. She winked. “I chose this place with care—I hated the beehives, but it has other amenities.”
John stopped right in front of him, their toes nearly touching. Sherlock stared down into the much-loved face of John Watson, heart aching.
“Don’t,” John warned, retreating enough so Sherlock could breath around the considerable girth in his mouth. John gave Sherlock a moment, briefly resting with his cock against the inside of Sherlock’s cheek.
Sherlock felt John guiding him—tasting, teasing, nibbling—and did his best to follow. He sighed with relief as John’s arms tightened again and eliminated the remaining space between their bodies. He could feel John’s arousal pressed into his lower abdomen; his own was slotted neatly into the cradle of John’s thigh.
way,” John growled, leaning in to place an open-mouthed kiss on the little mole beside Sherlock’s Adam’s apple. He flicked at the sensitive skin with his tongue before mouthing up to nuzzle under Sherlock’s jaw.
Sherlock brushed over the soft fuzz on John’s belly, traced winding circles around his navel before finally—CHRIST finally—slipping through the nest of dark golden brown hair to capture John’s cock. John grunted his approval. He wiggled into the delicious friction of Sherlock’s fist, pushing his cock through the circle of his alpha’s lovely long fingers. Again and again and again.
“Oh, this is great,” John quipped, moving in to smooth a hand over the Thomas the Tank Engine bedding. “Kit will love having his own bed here, even if it’s only for a few days.”
Here was the contrast. The ever-so-slightly plump evidence that John was—in every way—the ideal man. Here, on a chest that was otherwise hardened by years of activity, were two tiny pillows of perfection.
“Calm down,” John whispered, a smile plastered on his face for the benefit of the camera crew milling around them. “This is just how television works. A lot of hurry up and wait.”
John grinned at him. “Have you ever thought…I mean what you can do—have you ever considered doing something else with your talents?”
“Shhh!” Sherlock grasped John’s hand to keep him from surging forward to help. “Let him go. He’s had lots of practice.”
John backed along the aisle behind Sherlock, never taking his eyes from the two men following them. When they’d reached the relative safety of the next car transition, John stood and followed Sherlock at a run.
Sherlock slipped beneath the duvet and set his head right next to John’s on the same pillow. “But I can call my parents?” His breath was warm and sweet so close to John’s face.
John’s hands, too, had begun to wander. He slid flattened palms along Sherlock’s spine to his shoulder blades and back down. Turning his face into Sherlock’s belly, he nuzzled and huffed while his hands slid over the curve of Sherlock’s bottom.
“Where are the drugs?” John repeated solemnly. He was always frustrated seeing the incredible waste brought about by drugs use, but to see a handsome and clever young man ruining himself with heroin…it made John unreasonably angry.
John hummed his agreement as they watched the kids play. “Lunch was great, by the way. I love your housekeeper’s cooking.”
“No, you don’t,” John said, his voice still rough. He tried again to smile and this time he succeeded.
Sherlock nodded helplessly, lips parting in anticipation. He felt the smooth, blunt tip of John’s member bump damply against his face.
Sherlock grabbed for him. “John! Oh, god. No. No.” He gathered John into his arms as John scrambled to try and staunch the heavy flow of blood.
Sherlock stood, wincing with his injuries. He could see the concern on John’s face. “It’s all right. I’m fine.”
When Sherlock didn’t answer, John pressed his call button for help. He waited restlessly for the nurse to appear. When the door opened and the young man appeared, John tried to sit up.
John lifted his head from his tasty morsel and met the younger man’s dilated eyes. “I have…in my bag…”
“Never mind.” Sherlock cleared his throat, ignoring John’s teasing smile. He nodded approvingly at his son. “We can talk about that another time.”
He had stopped in front of a painting—well, Sherlock supposed it was a painting. The work was hung on the gallery’s plain white wall, which provided a vivid contrast with the work’s rich blue-green background. Sherlock cocked his head as he surveyed the piece.
“Sylvia, I have two kids and two careers,” John said. “How am I supposed to just put my feet up and do nothing?”
Finally, at length, Sherlock pressed home very deliberately and shuddered his release inside John. John clenched around him, mimicking the feel of his body milking Sherlock’s knot during heat. Sherlock groaned and held tightly to John as he rode out his orgasm.
Hello to anyone who is following this! I've just about completed the whole thing--only the epilogue to go now. So I will post a couple of chapters today. Hope you enjoy!
Sherlock toed off his shoes and set them aside, followed by his socks. Next, he reached for the closure on his bespoke trousers. When he’d dispensed with the fastenings, he eased the fabric down over his hips.
The press had run wild with Sherlock’s return from the dead. John had expected Sherlock to bask in the attention, but instead he’d insisted they take Kit to Margaret and William’s to get out of the glare. They had spent two glorious weeks there: pouring over and organizing Sherlock’s case notes, taking long walks, playing with their son and—on one delightful occasion when Mr. and Mrs. Holmes had taken Kit to the seaside for the day—making love on (and against) every surface in the cottage.
From the basement, John made his way to A&E where he knew his next contact was waiting. There, in the ward where they kept patients for transfer, he found a ginger-wigged Sherlock on a gurney. He nodded at the orderly (also one of Mycroft’s) who then unlocked the gurney and moved it toward the door. John quickly conferred with the nurse and the attending and signed the appropriate release.
“Don’t be. Some things may still be salvageable. I may be able to replace some items from the stuff I have stored at my parents’. And Mycroft may be of some use.”
Sherlock bent and scooped a puzzled Drew into his arms. He reached back for Kit. “Come on, Kit. Come and sit on the sofa with Daddy. He isn’t feeling very well.” Sherlock turned and herded John in that direction.
John closed the door and turned back to where Sherlock had been, fully prepared to quiz him on his presumptuous behaviour, but the man was already halfway up the stairs.
“No, no. It’s fine. I mean, I know all about you. Not from the thing you gave me—I know that was blank. No, Mycroft and Sherlock have seen your whole file now. The one Magnussen memorized. Your old CIA friend got hungry again. This time he went to Mycroft’s people.”
“It’s more me than you know,” Sherlock said softly. “It reminds me of some of those who mean the most to me. You most of all. A skull hides nothing. Bones laid bare.” He reached for John’s hand. “I can’t hide anything from you anymore. I don’t want to.”
The chase was exhilarating for both alpha and omega. It heightened desire and led to a much more satisfying — and more subdued — mating.
Sherlock sat perfectly still and allowed John to use his mouth. John’s pattern was generous: thrusting several times to delve as deeply as possible and then pulling back, just long enough for Sherlock to get his breath, before beginning again. Sherlock wallowed in the heat that coursed through him at being so helpless — held in place by John’s fingers tight in his hair — and yet having so much power. John’s breathing was ragged, his fingers clenching and releasing in Sherlock’s hair.
“Well, perhaps the less said about that—” Sherlock started, trying to avoid eye contact with a snickering DI Lestrade.
Sherlock was perched on the edge of his chair, one foot tapping restlessly. He checked his watch again, confirming what he already knew: Forty minutes since he’d given John the dosed biscuits. A little less than thirty minutes since the good doctor had disappeared up the stairs muttering something about needing to call Mary.
“I guess we stayed away long enough and the CID got everything they needed,” John said, glancing about the room. “Though it wouldn’t have killed them to straighten up.”
John rounded on him, feeling every minute of his long morning in the clinic. “You can’t leave them alone, Sherlock. Not even for a minute! Anything could happen!”
With a wink for old Mr. Blue Skull, Sherlock turned out the light and moved to follow the man he loved.
Sherlock hesitated in the doorway and turned to look back at John, now standing bare-arsed beside the bed, dressing gown in hand.
John snapped back in his seat, eyes wide. His mouth opened and closed twice—like a bloody carp—and then…
John obliged, easing his finger deeper within the tight heat of Sherlock’s arse while he bobbed up and back over the man’s cock.
I'm so sorry for the egregious delay. I got my head all turned around by this one. All sorted now. Just the epilogue (i.e. porn) to go! I promise it will be worth it.
John felt his heart sink. He’d have to find a way to incapacitate her, and for an omega in his condition—well, the odds were hardly in his favour. Unless…
Sherlock leaned forward and tugged at one corner of the wrapping. His brows lifted as he saw the familiar blue background. “Mr. Blue Skull.”
“I enjoyed the chance to spend the night with a friend and not think about it for a while. It’s been lovely.”
Holmes was watching him with an intense scrutiny the likes of which John had never experienced. He tried not to flinch as the man watched him and, finally, nodded. John had the strangest feeling that he had just gained some kind of approval.
He moaned as John rubbed over a deliciously sensitive spot on his penis and he tried to inch closer. John panted in his ear, thrusting gently into the fist Sherlock had made with his long fingers. They rutted together this way for a few minutes, until John grabbed Sherlock by the waist and pulled him close. He rolled them until Sherlock was sprawled on top of him, thighs draped on either side of John’s hips. Sherlock wriggled into place, settling as…
Greg guffawed through his tears, leaning forward across the desk to grasp John’s forearm. John clasped at the hand and held it there as they both struggled to regain control.
It came about on a perfectly ordinary Tuesday, following a case involving the theft of some rare manuscripts from a private collection. He'd attended the crime scene alone, as sometimes happened when John had locum work. The case hadn't been terribly trying, and so—with only a few quick texts to John—he found himself at New Scotland Yard.
Sherlock swayed into John, eyes closed and mouth frozen in an inaudible “OH,” as John sucked at one particular spot on the side of his neck. John’s hand, meanwhile had continued to creep ahead as Sherlock’s thighs relaxed and fell open. Sherlock could not control the moan that escaped him as John’s knuckles brushed over his burgeoning erection for the first time.
“Indeed. And in the garden, that spot where everything had been torn up? Traces of the Valerian plant, which is very useful as a natural sedative. Mrs. Gamble said Heatherton was a wine connoisseur, didn’t she? That he was the head of the local appreciation club?”
“God, no,” John said, leaning in. “Look, Mr. Holmes, perhaps I’m not the best medical professional to help your brother. I’m a gender medicine specialist and a sex therapist. It sounds as though your brother requires treatment for addiction.”
Sherlock was loathe to release John's nipple, but he knew it would be somewhat oversensitive now. He let it pop from his mouth with a delicious slurp and dropped his head to John's shoulder. John's hand freed itself from Sherlock's curls and one lovely strong arm curled around him to draw him close.
John chuckled. “There you go again. My god, you are sexy. And you are going the right way to get shagged.”
With the kettle boiled and some ginger tea made to settle his stomach, John was about to curl up on the sofa when the doorbell rang.
“We—we haven’t really talked about it.” John shifted in his seat. He’d tried bringing it up a few months back, but Sherlock had brushed him off, saying it was too soon to discuss it.
When they had both regained some equilibrium, John rose and padded to the bathroom. He returned with a soft flannel to wipe them both down and then helped Sherlock pull the bedding down so they could crawl beneath. Sherlock settled into the heap of soft pillows and John snuggled into his side with his head on the same pillow.
Sherlock sighed contentedly. “Got teased for it,” he mumbled into John’s bare chest. “Said I looked like a girl.”
Sherlock stumbled up onto the mattress, crawling in behind John and straddling John’s legs with his own. He hesitated there until John took each of his hands. John pulled Sherlock’s arms around his torso and drew him in until they were pressed together as they had been on the floor — not a hint of daylight between them.
“I thought about it. Especially right before Bart’s.” John sniffed. “I didn’t know what to do. I’ve never been in a relationship with a man. I experimented, when I was younger, but…well it never turned into anything. I was unsure of myself. And you.”
John’s phone rang. He pulled it out of the pocket of his dressing gown and checked the number, eyes immediately rolling.
This was not his area. This was what John did. Strong, brave, competent John was the one who cared for people. He was so good at it. So assured. He always made Sherlock feel safe.
“Is she sleeping?” John asked, shifting around so he could see her. Sherlock moved with him and pressed into his side.
“You know there isn’t enough room at 221B for all of us,” John continued evenly. “And you having a child underfoot…”
“I was beginning to wonder, because my god, he smelled like chocolate and the first drag of a cigarette and dark roast coffee and fresh cut flowers all in one. I was so wet that I had to dig my fingers into the duvet to keep from crawling across the bed to get him.”
“Shhhhh…” the taller man soothed. Sherlock bent, once more surprising John by capturing his mouth. John started, but moaned into the contact. The lovely, plump lips yielded to John’s firmer, narrower ones. John teased at the seam and was immediately met with an answering tongue. They tasted each other deeply, leisurely—as though they weren’t in danger of being caught out at any moment.
Sherlock beamed at him as he threw the door wide. “We’ll meet at seven. The address is 221B Baker Street.”
Sherlock felt colour rising to his face as he fussed with his gloves. “I'll be sure to pass along your glad tidings, then,” he said, with as much sarcasm as he could muster.
“Mhmmm,” Sherlock nodded. “And one of them is a radical who has infiltrated Argentina’s military—a sleeper who’s been biding his time, assembling his people and resources. Now you are about to hand him the means with which to threaten and hold hostage his government as the first stage of a coup d’etat.”
“Procedure,” John replied firmly. When Holmes had complied with this second request, John nodded once more. “Please remove the coat and pass it to me with one hand.”
“Gutteridge is not very popular, at least according to Mrs. Gamble. He’s lived in the area all his life, but while Heatherton—a relative newcomer—sat on committees and the parish council, always won the gardening trophy, and had his poems as the centerpiece of a local literature festival—for which he also served as a judge—Gutteridge couldn’t get a sniff.”
Sherlock frowned a little, scrunching his nose up as he struggled to understand what he’d said or which social cue he’d missed. He would ask, of course, when they got into the cab or when they reached the flat. Sometimes, if they had time, he would ask right at the time.
John’s lips pursed and he looked down and away. “No. It’s for a case, like you said. The only way to get on the programme, which is the only way to get access to the suspect’s house.” John’s head came up again. “Unless you’d rather do this with Molly or somebody?”
He started to pull himself free of the toy, his erection beginning to flag, when Sherlock’s hand settled over the small mound of John’s belly. “Don’t,” he said, his voice husky.
Janine nodded. “You are such a clever clogs,” she teased, moving in close to run a hand over Sherlock’s chest.  “I want you dead, naturally, but first I wanted to finish what Jimmy started. I wanted you to burn. I wanted you to feel your heart tearing itself to bits inside your chest with the pain you’d caused John, and ache of knowin’ that it was too late because while he might love you—DOES love you—he’d found someone else and was going to marry her. I wanted you to seethe when you discovered who Mary really was and be overcome with terror that she might hurt John…and yet be utterly helpless to do anythin’ except protect him and the life you thought he still wanted. Though Mary did panic and very nearly cut all my fun short.”
“No case,” John confirmed. “Sometimes he’s a pile of useless strop when he’s got nothing on, and other times he’s like a high-strung puppy—starts chewing the bloody furniture.”
John shook his head. “The swelling on his spine could get worse; he could be permanently paralyzed.”
There was a shuffling and the sound of a drawer opening. Sherlock was vibrating with need. His hole was still damp with John’s spit and feeling ever so slightly opened from John’s tongue, but he ached for more. He’d only ever imagined it, and now…
“I-I-I could…” Sherlock took a deep breath. “I love you and I want us to be together so you can move back here because this is your home and Emily loves it here and she has her own room because you would share mine and it would be our room because we would sleep together because I love you.”
Sherlock pulled the door wide. He was in the process of moving out into the corridor when John heard shouting. Sherlock bolted, John right behind him. He glanced behind them as they sprinted through the narrow passageway and into the next car—there were two thugs, all right. Different than the two they’d seen in London.
“Simple process of elimination,” Sherlock started, eyeing John critically. “Your scent is very neutral, but almost too chemical. An untrained nose would call it beta; post-andropause omega at very best, though given your age that is unlikely. You’re what — twenty-eight?”
“It’s fine. I know Drew was a bit fussy last night. I would have come up from the lab, but I was covered in…something not good.” He shrugged. “Anyway, I thought you could do with a bit of a lie in and a long shower.” His brow furrowed. “A suit?”
Sherlock’s head came up a little more. Mycroft watched, fascinated, as his brother and John looked at one another for the first time in six months. For all that Sherlock had changed, his eyes were unmistakable—crystal blue-green…and now filled with tears.
John held up a hand. "Kit’s craving Sherlock, Mycroft. I don’t know if he can go on much longer like this.”
He closed the distance between them to catch Sherlock’s bottom lip between both of his own. He tilted his head, angling to bring them even closer together—bumping noses once—and then…oh, god. John moaned into the kiss as Sherlock sweetly parted his lips and their tongues brushed.
“Guess I did. Not that I want to have to go around shooting serial killers on a regular basis, but it seems to me you might need saving from time to time.”
“Mmmmmmorning,” Sherlock growled. He brushed his knuckles over John’s cheek and let his gaze wander down over John’s outfit. “You look very nice.”
“It’ll all turn out well,” William said gently. “Sleep now and I’ll make us some tea when you get up.”
John released a heavy breath. Sherlock’s fingers instantly curled around his own and they shared a look. Sherlock posed the question silently; John replied in kind, his eyes reflecting his faith in Sherlock and the love they shared.
“Oh, I bet they’re right around the corner,” John said brightly. “Honestly, I had basically given up when I met Sherlock.”
More footsteps and suddenly the small space was lit up by the camera’s lights. The camera operator poked her head around the side and gave them a look.
Sherlock was facing away from the door, focussing on the window. John sidled up beside the bed and sat in the chair, patiently waiting for the man to acknowledge him. Sherlock continued to stare out into the gloomy, drizzly weather and refused to meet John’s eyes. John folded his hands in his lap and tried to be patient, though he wasn’t exactly sure where to begin.
The alpha hummed his approval and pressed his swollen shaft into John’s soft rump. “Mine,” he repeated needlessly. He licked and nuzzled at John’s neck before finally sinking his teeth into the nape.
“I’m in danger and I need your help. There are two men following me and they will kill me. Please go along with the charade. It’s a matter of national security.”
He rolled into his lover's body, tilting Sherlock's face up for more kissing. Sherlock eagerly eased back into the mattress, allowing John to weight him down and cover his body. John pressed them together from chest to hip, and kissed Sherlock until he was breathless.
“I just don’t understand,” John said, throwing his hands up. He was standing to one side of the table with William. They had decided to let Margaret try feeding the baby today, as he’d been fussy. “I don’t know what else to do. The doctors have been useless; it’s been over two weeks and his family alpha barely makes an impression. I just—”
John held up a hand. “I know. I’ve had time to think about it and I don’t blame you for that. I know what it’s like not to be able to give someone up. And the baby—” He cleared his throat. “I know I’m not—if you go into protective custody I won’t be able to see her, and I’ve made my peace with that.” There was a long pause as he allowed that to sink in. “Mycroft will allow David to go with you, if that’s what you want.”
Sherlock resumed staring at the ceiling. “Not in the sense that it will change how I feel about any of them. But it’s interesting.”
“Please,” John encouraged, weaving his fingers into Sherlock’s curls. “I need you to suck them,” he whispered against Sherlock’s brow. “It makes me so wet.”
The little girl smiled shyly and tucked her face into Mycroft’s shoulder. Her sleek, chestnut hair had been neatly trimmed to frame her face. Her eyes were the spitting image of Greg’s—round and rich chocolate brown with thick, dark lashes. She was a quiet child, but already gave every sign of being as bright and observant as Mycroft.
“What? No!” Sherlock said swiftly. “Why would I—unless you’d rather I did this with Molly or…somebody?”
“So you really didn’t know which of the researchers had betrayed the project? Their alibis were that good.”
Mycroft entered the sitting room, two of his larger dark-suited “assistants” following in his wake. He began his perusal of the room with a disdainful sniff.
John hated the deception and he’d struggled to maintain the illusion of forgiveness. Thankfully he’d been able to get away without the betrayal of physical intimacy. Mary’s pregnancy had become uncomfortable enough that she preferred sleeping alone.
He bottomed out, dropping his forehead to Sherlock’s shoulder with a moan as his balls rucked up against Sherlock’s heated, moist flesh.
Sherlock, for his part, had turned a lovely shade of pink and was now lying quite peacefully waiting for John to release him. John sighed at the sight, though he was more than aware that now was not the time. He released the straps and tugged the blanket free so Sherlock could join him on the bench seat.
Sherlock dug his teeth into the flesh at John’s nape. John was not in heat, so the bite wouldn’t trigger submission, but it made John groan helplessly as he shot his load without ever being touched. He thrust against the bed, using the mattress beneath him for friction. Sherlock picked up his pace, beginning to sweat now with exertion.
He had become very used to having Dr. John H. Watson around. Thinking of that ever changing…a heaviness settled in his chest and he snuck another look at the dark-haired woman in the kitchen.
Mary’s mouth grew pinched. “It was my birth name. Sabrina Moran. I was adopted when I was two. I decided to reclaim it when I—”
him, to boot—John was about to make his captor aware that he was not to be underestimated when a rich, honeyed voice rumbled against his ear.
John finally grasped the hand firmly, welcoming the grounding contact. He straightened his spine as Sherlock withdrew and made his way to the plane.
Michael approached them with a sheepish smile. “Sorry, chaps. Looks like the owner lost track of the time and hasn’t vacated quite yet.”
Sherlock picked up the menu. “It’s fine. We’ve eaten here before and we talk to each other all the time. Shouldn’t be too difficult.”
He was far too absorbed in his heated body’s demands to notice the sound of the bathroom door lock being picked. Or the sound of a creeping detective just outside the bath.
“Thank you for this,” John said softly, stroking over Sherlock’s back. “It’s been a lovely morning.”
There was a long, deep-throated groan and suddenly the dead weight was removed. John rolled to the side, cock releasing from Sherlock’s tight sheath with a sticky “pop,” and flopped onto Sherlock’s bed.
John’s head came up, his moistened mouth still open as he looked up at Sherlock. The man had worried his lip almost until it bled.
John trailed kisses over Sherlock’s jaw, finally arriving at his lips. He nibbled daintily at Sherlock’s still somewhat puzzled pout, gently running his tongue over the seam.
John shot him a dirty look before returning his attention to their son. “Later, pet. Once gran and granddad and Uncle Mycroft come ‘round. All right?”
John didn't think it was an unreasonable request. It wasn't that he minded Sherlock going off without him. Not really. He had his own work, too, for god's sake. It was just that he wanted to be kept in the loop so he'd know, for instance, when his presence was important to Sherlock's safety. Or even whether or not he should bother with dinner. That sort of thing.
Sherlock had been so exuberant, so animated with the excitement of having begun to see answers in the Jennifer Wilson murder. He hadn’t realized what he’d said about the stillborn baby, but he’d certainly felt the judgment of the Met’s finest as they’d stared at him in horror. He’d turned to John for some kind of guidance.
John found a switch at the bottom of the stairs and lit up the dank cellar space. They split up, each searching for some sign of a hidden room or hole in the floor. It did not take long before Sherlock found a small section of wall that looked very much like it belonged where it was, but upon careful examination made one side of the house slightly shorter than the other.
There was a gush of fluid from between his legs. John looked down and could not determine whether the blood was from Sherlock or his own body.
“Of course not,” Mary agreed. “Come on, now. Eat up. You need to think about our little one in there.”
“Come, come, Dr. Watson,” Holmes chided. “Plenty of time for that. Well, I say plenty…once the train departs we’ll have approximately 50 minutes before we reach Reading, where I am certain my pursuers will make an effort to board the train and…reacquire me.”
“Is he okay?” he asked, trying not to sound panicky as he pointed at Sherlock’s bed. “Has anyone checked his vitals? Is there a guard outside the door?”
“But, hey, you’ve got the, uhm…” Lestrade turned and peered at the painting in the back seat. “The…skull painting.”
“When I finally realized that Greg was hinting around at maybe asking me out, I decided that one of us needed to be brave. So I just sat him down and told him I liked him and wanted to take him for coffee.”
Emily’s voice cut through the intimacy of their conversation like a knife. John jerked to his feet, relaxing only when he spotted the little girl waving happily from her spot beside the statue of Ramesses II. She was now wearing a miniaturized reproduction of the statue’s headdress and looking very pleased with herself.
The rest of the morning passed in painfully boring and predictable fashion. The interview was tedious and they’d had to redo a couple of answers. Apparently he’d been a bit “unapproachable.” The first house they were taken to see was nice, but relatively forgettable: a converted Victorian coach house with a huge loft (that could be used as a laboratory), a modern kitchen, four bedrooms, a library and a small garden with a distant view of the sea.
John had never had the heart to ask if he’d ever been told Sherlock’s death wasn’t real. Greg had wept at the funeral—it felt cruel, somehow, to remind him of what he’d been put through.
"I'm terribly sorry to bother you, sir. It's just...the privacy lock was turned but there wasn't a tag on the door. We wanted to check you are all right. And, if possible, confirm when our staff might be able to enter to do the cleaning."
John dropped the bandages as though scorched himself and nearly overturned his stool in his haste to back away from Sherlock’s bed. He was breathing too fast — on the edge of hyperventilating. He blinked at Sherlock, who was now watching him with a look of genuine surprise.
“John!” Sherlock snapped, huffing with frustration. “Will you make yourself useful and get me out this?”
“And then with Magnussen and Mary and Moriarty–christ, I was so close to losing you again.” John began to tremble. “I am not good at this stuff, Sherlock. I’m not. I don’t know how…” He ducked his head once more and his shoulders began to shake.
“Come along, boys,” she prompted, prodding at her husband. “I think it’s time we stopped for a cup of tea.”
In time, Max became restless and short-tempered. She’d asked him to get help, but he refused. In the end, he’d begun lashing out violently at her and the children. She’d packed up the kids and ended up at her sister’s for a while. Fortunately, the kids were okay.
“Fascinating. Perhaps that’s why my brother was so tight-lipped about you when he informed me that I was either going to attend this appointment or be transported to rehab.” Sherlock dipped his chin. “Go on then. Aren’t you going to ask me what it was I noticed?”
“You can’t beat yourself up for what you didn’t know. You’re very healthy. I asked for a complete blood panel, and everything looks fine.” He typed another note into Greg’s electronic medical record. “I’ll have Lucy book you in with the midwife and in a couple of weeks you’ll have your first scan.”
“Sherlock, I like you.” John tugged at Sherlock’s suit jacket until Sherlock shrugged out of it, and then set to work on the buttons of his shirt. “I know that seems strange, given how we met and how recently. It’s strange to me, too. I don’t usually…that is…I don’t take to people easily. Never have. But you are different. I can’t explain to you how I know, but I just do.”
Kit and Drew both froze where they were—wooden spoons raised for another go at the pots and pans—and stared at John. John rubbed at his aching head and tried not to notice how worried his children looked. He did have a temper, but he had always tried not to raise his voice with the boys.
It took mere seconds for John to abandon a professional effort at a take down in favour of fighting techniques that were considerably dirtier. But that was not unexpected.
“Yes,” John replied, standing. There was no one else nearby to see the enormous bulge straining the front of his trousers.
The call ended and John stared at it in his hand. It never failed—just like their father had done, Harry had a gift for making John feel small and insignificant. And a failure. Always that.
“Oh, well, Mycroft will be delighted to know his nephew has taken after him in one particular.” Sherlock said sarcastically.
John stared for a moment, unable to prevent his lips from turning up. God, he had almost forgotten about that. “No, not a physical one, but damn it, it still hurts.”
Sherlock pounded his mate’s arse relentlessly, slowing only occasionally to change the rhythm and ease himself back from the edge. After a while, he released John’s hips and stretched over his mate’s body. He twined their fingers together and mouthed at the back of John’s neck.
“Greg, hi,” John replied. He swallowed hard against the wave of nausea that still threatened. It was well past noon, but of course “morning” sickness was so terribly misnamed. At least this particular treat was on time. It had kicked in right after the one-month mark—almost as though his body was rewarding him for the positive pregnancy test—and was only getting worse at eight weeks.
"Quite right, I do." Jeanette smiled at him. It was a smile that still had the power to take John's breath away. "Say, I don't suppose you'd fancy getting a coffee or something sometime? I'm back in London after a few years away and I'm still getting my bearings. It would be nice to have a friend in town."
This time John shouted. His hips arched off the bed and his hand clasped Sherlock’s nape, holding the alpha in place as he suckled.
“I’ll leave you to it,” Mycroft said quietly, feeling every inch the intruder. Sherlock’s head lifted and their eyes met, just for a moment. Sherlock nodded at his brother as Mycroft closed the door behind him.
“Come on. Take this and meet me in bed. I’ll get the glasses. There’s something I’d like to tell you.”
Only six months prior, Sherlock had completed his work to destroy Moriarty’s network. He’d returned to John and Kit once and for all, putting an end to the as-possible, clandestine meetings at Mycroft’s top secret safe house in order to keep Kit connected to his alpha father. The freedom to resume their lives together, as a family, had been a tremendous relief for all of them.
John nodded into his back, not capable of forming the words. Holmes’ fingers tangled with his own at the trouser fastenings. John nuzzled into the back of the long neck as he slid the zipper down. Holmes shifted in his arms, just enough to tug trousers—and pants—to his ankles.
Sherlock gained on John, his longer legs giving him an advantage. They raced through the kitchen, bare feet slipping some on the highly polished floor. John skidded into a cabinet narrowly avoiding Sherlock’s grasping fingers as he regained his footing. Sherlock snarled and resumed pursuit, out through the dining room and back around to the foyer. John took the stairs two at a time.
“I didn’t know, I saw. Your haircut, the way you hold yourself says military—hardly an unusual background for someone in security or law enforcement. You have a limp, though it’s barely noticeable. Still, probably would have been enough to disqualify you during the physical fitness assessment. So you were given special dispensation to obtain employment with the border service…most likely part of the government’s recent repatriation efforts for returning service men and women.”
They walked in silence then, John clutching the arm beneath his fingers for fear it would suddenly disappear. He glanced up at his companion repeatedly, still not quite able to believe that Sherlock was there. Sherlock watched him out of the corner of his eye, his mouth quirked in a crooked grin.
John snorted. “Let’s not get too fanciful, hmmm?” he teased. “It’s enough to know that you’ll be by my side and we’ll deal with everything together. That’s how I want things to be from now on. We do this together or not at all.”
John laughed a little. “No, I don’t think you do, but it’s okay.” He settled back into the sofa and let Sherlock burrow into his warmth.
Mycroft shook his head. “Oh, honestly,” he said, sounding very impatient. “Why would she? If Sherlock had died, her utility to Magnussen would be at an end—the chain of leverage leading to me would be broken, and she would be free. Magnussen could have used the information he had to blackmail her in some other way, I suppose, but at the minimum my brother’s death would have offered her a little breathing room.” Mycroft shifted in his seat. “It was Magnussen.”
John drew back from the embrace only far enough to grasp the handsome face with both hands and cry, “God, how I’ve missed you!” before covering the stranger’s lips with his own.
Sherlock groaned into the open-mouthed kiss, making quick work of the buttons on John’s shirt. He pushed the fabric wide, pulling away from John’s mouth so he could stare down with unvarnished lust at John’s developing breasts. They were small, but his nipples were a little swollen now. Sherlock was utterly enraptured.
“My sexy volcano,” John teased, chuckling. “You're just like after the explosion and the ash, with the lava just flowing up and out. I love the way you come. God, it is so fucking gorgeous.”
John grinned at him. “Oh, yes—for DI Dimmock?” John said, naming the man who was covering Greg Lestrade’s cases while he was on paternity leave. He nudged Kit back toward the door and then followed him out into the kitchen. “And what was this experiment?”
she would not be signalling her interest to a mated and pregnant omega. He’d been kind and she appreciated it. That was all. Anything else would be incredibly unprofessional. He inhaled again, noting with relief that he could not detect any scent markers. He must have imagined it. Bloody hormones.
“I wouldn’t have told you otherwise. Mary must have suspected; she requested a paternity test under an assumed name. She had the DNA tested against David’s.”
John turned his attention back to his task. Sherlock’s foreskin had almost completely retracted, but he gently slipped the last little bit back from the head. He licked at the plumped flesh and dug the tip of his tongue into the slit. There was a sharp gasp, but Sherlock didn’t move. He licked around the base of the head and paid particular attention to the fraenulum. He pumped Sherlock’s prick gently as he took his time exploring with his tongue—every salty note, every texture, every vein. He needed new memories and he intended to start tonight.
John smirked, taking a cleansing breath before he ventured too near the smell of death. “It is indeed. Wish me luck.”
“Now she’s gone and I…” He stared out into the darkness. “Why was I to blame for her? Why did she hate me?”
Between them they managed get John pulled forward nearly to the edge of the bed, with a pillow supporting his belly. Sherlock clambered over and settled in against the wall. Front to back now, Sherlock pressed in close and brushed his lips over John’s neck. He eased John’s top leg forward; John moaned as Sherlock began to stroke over his dripping entrance.
The midwife reappeared then, having dealt with the afterbirth. “Hello, everyone,” he said pleasantly. “Is it all right if I finish the clean-up now?”
Sherlock chuckled. “No, that’s farther down; past the Marylebone Road. I took rooms of my own. I wasn’t in England often during the early part of the war, but when I was I required a quiet space to retreat to — to think.” He patted John’s hand. “My landlady is a very understanding sort. I did her a service many years ago and she’s given me a substantial discount on the rent.”
He thought of Sherlock's puzzled expression when he turned to John for help during his Best Man speech. Sherlock hadn’t understood why people were crying. The poor man had no idea he'd just admitted his love for John. Some people thought it was sweet—platonic, brotherly love. Some knew better. Lestrade had worn a very satisfied expression all night...until Sherlock left alone.
