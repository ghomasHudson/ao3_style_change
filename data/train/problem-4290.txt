Cas stretches out a hand, softly puts his fingers on the wristband Dean was playing with. He makes sure not to touch the skin beneath. “You didn’t take it off.”
And Dean doesn’t like being touched when he is like this, doesn’t even like anyone seeing him like this, but he doesn’t shake Cas off. Instead he leans forward until his forehead rests against the front seat, his hands cushioning it from the bumps of the drive.
What he doesn’t say are all the other things that are eating at him. But he wants to be the best pretend husband ever and he will be. Even if he has to force Cas to take the nice things that Dean offers him.
“Bring him some coffee,” Amara barks. “Black.”
It is small and worried and breaks him out of his thoughts. He better end this call before it destroys him completely. But not before Cas hasn’t said his piece. He owes him that much. “Yeah, Cas. You’re right. You’re the one who has a right to be angry. So, you say what you need to say and I’ll listen and then we’ll hang up.” For most likely forever. But Dean doesn’t say it, just lets it hang in the air.
Well. He knows the solution to that. And maybe - maybe he can at least mitigate the consequences. Maybe, him giving in will be enough for Amara to agree to some stipulations. It won’t even be about him wanting to see Cas or Sam or any of his friends or family really. He wants them to be as far away from Amara as possible. But maybe, if he plays this right she’ll agree to seeing a Guardian every so often. To have a mediator. Maybe, he won’t have to do this completely on his own.
“Yeah,” Dean nods. “You, too. I know she’s all endearing when she wants to be but…”
“But…” But there are no words. Dean isn’t even sure there is space in his brain for this revelation, let alone RAM to compute it.
Dean chuckles a little but lapses back into silence for a while. “So, do you do this often?” He finally asks. “Picking up strays?”
“Like Homer or OJ?” Either a radioactive or a homicidal puppy, great.
Yes, he was angry and sometimes he still is, and part of it is towards Dean, but somewhere deep inside, he knows that even from the first moment, he had no one to blame but himself. For letting Dean get so close, for not being able to move on, for the words to catch him, to poison his mind and darken every good feeling. For the past to jump him without a warning.
There is a look of incredulity on Cas’ face before anger overtakes his features. “You of all people should know better, Dean. Yes, my work as a Guardian includes building up people who go through difficult times. That doesn't mean that I just say what they want to hear without caring whether it’s true. And it doesn’t mean that I see you as a client, either. You are important to
“Look, Cas, it’s not you,” Sam soothes, though he’s pretty sure that it is absolutely Cas, just in a different way than Cas thinks right now. “Dean’s not good with humans sometimes, you’re going to have to help him adapt.”
A shudder goes through Dean before he nods, “Then I will be there.” And after a moment, “I’m sorry for not asking, Cas. I thought with all of these Alphas at Crowley’s… but I shouldn’t have assumed.”
Dean swallows hard and averts his eyes. He kind of deserved that one but that doesn’t make it any better. He wants to say something, anything, but he’s too afraid of what will come out of his mouth. The words pooling on his tongue are a sure-fire way to destroy their friendship. So he can’t. He needs Cas. And he can goddamn well be happy with what he has. He just has to. He’s going to enjoy it for every moment that he gets. Before… Dean's gaze wanders to Cas’ seal in reminder of the inevitable.
“Something like that, yeah,” Dean admits. He has to clear his throat for his voice to keep steady. “Though I doubt that he’d - Cas, if I had met him before - before he had the crack in his chassis - he wouldn’t have looked at me twice.”
a time and date and
“Is it of import?” Cas answers. “It was just one dream out of many.”
do. They don’t give and give and give and never want anything in return. And it’s not like Cas hasn’t offered. He’d offered his body first, when he’d hardly known Dean, but he’d offered his heart as well, that night when he came back from Angels’ Nest. And Dean had wanted that, right? Dean still wants that. Cas can smell it. And yet, Dean doesn’t take. Instead, he brings Cas food and he helps with the dishes and he lets Cas give back even less than he was able to before. Cas growls wordlessly. It's frustrating, that’s what it is. Dean’s gotta be the most frustrating Alpha there’s ever been.
“We’re close to human settlements already. The territory is not safe. I don’t want to get too far ahead.”
“Alright then. Who would you flirt with?”
“Sam’s in a meeting, you know how it is. But we texted and agreed that I should call you if you don’t answer by noon,” Jess explains.
So Claire hasn't forgotten that she's overheard that. Ah well, luck's never been on Dean's side. "Kinda only noticed it today, weird as that sounds. But Claire," Dean grabs her hand to emphasize that he means that, "a crush means nothing. You're my priority here."
“We were talking about the historical significance of marriage,” Castiel says.
“So why can’t you find that?”
“Yeah, but Jo fights dirty.”
Half an hour later, he’s done with his coffee, has checked his email, has reached Sam’s voicemail (“Dammit, Sammy, we have nothing to go on here, give me something. Anything. I don’t care how weak the link is, give me a starting point!”) Dean’s got nothing to do anymore and is still slowly going crazy. He checks on Cas through the window, and yeah, he’s still out there, weeding the flower beds next to the fence to their neighbors’. So Dean leaves him alone. Gives him the space that is the only thing he can give him right now.
“Castiel has seen a male chest or two in his life, I assure you. He won’t be scandalized by the fact that you have skin under your shirt.”
“Don’t you need their notebook for that?”
There’s a long moment of silence after that. And yeah, there isn’t much to say to it, Dean guesses.
"Yeah, oh." Dean echos.
There’s a long moment where nothing happens. Then Bucky nods and wraps his hand around Steve’s. The real one, which is warm and holds on tight. Before Steve has a chance to get used to the feeling, Bucky leans in, quickly, and presses a soft kiss on Steve’s cheek.
“They’re good photos. I mean, I can’t judge them for their art quality or whatever. But I can see that they’ve been taken with love.”
And still. Dean can’t help but imagine Cas in Steve’s place. Holding Dean up, keeping him safe. There’s very few people Dean trusts implicitly. That he would give the reins to and feel safe doing it. Cas has always been one of them, betrayals over the years notwithstanding.
“You’ve told me that before,” Bucky answers.
Balthazar’s eyebrows rise. “Who do you think is the one maintaining the grave, huh?” He waves the flower pot he’d been carrying in front of Cas’ face.
“A motel. I stayed at a motel.” Dean says quickly.
“What?” Steve asks. “That’s what we are here for.”
He is already moving forward when a hand on his sleeve draws him back.
Talking of Cas. Dean’s been standing in the hallway for at least five minutes, and there has been no movement at all. The AC is rattling lowly, but that’s it. Everything else is quiet.
“Ah fuck,” he repeats. Defeated, this time.
Bucky shrugs, but there’s slight color in his cheeks. “Maybe?”
He puts a hand on her arm and squeezes it for a moment. “Thank you. You figured it out at 12, when I’m only figuring it out now.”
She gives him a sympathetic look. “Dean, no one has it figured out from the beginning. This,” she holds up her arm to show off her wristband of mourning, “was a hard earned lesson.”
“But Cas – why?” Dean asks because he’s pretty sure he’s done more than one thing that should be unforgivable.
“Yeah, I got that.” Dean rubs a hand over the top of his head. All of this is giving him a headache. “The system is fucked up.”
Dean kind of doesn’t want him to go to the door alone, but one look at the mess that is their kitchen, and he nods. “I’ll hurry. Dinner will be ready soon.”
Cas looks a little like a deer in the headlights again. “Whatever is easiest?” he hedges.
“What do I know?” Gabe answers. “Maybe they’re all happy with their soulmates? Maybe they’re too fucked up by society’s standards to see the option?”
Now Cas is not only confused, he looks downright suspicious and his voice is hard when he answers. “Do you plan on kicking me out again? Because if you do, you better say it outright, not set up a flimsy case to, I don’t know - train me up to be able to cope on my own? I’m still millenia old, I coped fine without the two of you.”
“Dude,” Dean answers but doesn’t have the words to express how much his muscles are not up for that right now.
It raises Dean’s hackles, his face hardening into suspicion. He’s dealt with too much similar crap before. Though he really hadn’t pegged Cas as the type. ”Kinda assumed it was the good beer and my winning personality as a bartender that kept you here,” Dean says as calmly as he can manage. “But if it’s not, I can assure you that whatever the fuck you think you have on me, you don’t. There’s no money to be made from me - or from my brother. No other favors, either.” He spits the last sentence.
“Careful, Red,” Natasha chuckles and extricates herself from under Charlie.
No, the problem isn’t Bucky. The problem is Steve. Because kissing Natasha when undercover? Piece of cake. Holding Bucky’s hand? Not so much.
He’d seen red. Literally seen red.
“Love wins,” Steve says warmly, and finally Dean averts his eyes from Cas to look at Steve, though he leaves his hand on Cas’. “I mean, being accepted for who we are… that was not something we always had. It still feels very new,” Steve continues.
"Ugh. Way to go with the guilt trip, dad."
The minor character death is in the past but it could be triggering so see chapter end notes if you want to know details.
“Obviously not a physical one, Cap. Dammit, I can’t catch that thing.”
“No way she’d been okay with that,” Bucky shakes his head.
“I’ll write the letter tonight.”
“Is that… how? What?”
Dean smiles a little, though his scent remains gloomy, “Your rare fertile Beta. It’s a shame, too, that her pup was killed. I doubt that that miracle will happen for her again.”
“You have no idea,” Steve grimaces. “They beat me up for being a fairy before I even knew I was one.” He sees the motion out of the corner of his eyes and sure enough there is the tell-tale swish of Bucky’s metal hand forming a fist. “Hey, Buck,” he immediately addresses that, “it was a long time ago. I’m good now. You can stand down.” He’s learned it the hard way that any perceived threats to Steve’s safety activate the Winter Soldier real fast.
There is a muffled laugh on the other end of the line. It’s exasperated but also – weirdly fond. “Yes, Dean. I always have.”
“What?”
Only of course, Dean shouldn’t do any of this. Wouldn’t need to do any of this, either. He’s already won Cas over. But it seems important to Dean, so Cas accepts it as it is. It isn’t the caring that has changed anyway, Dean has always cared. It is his need for affirmation, his need for his care to be seen and accepted. And Cas does both.
He nods back at them but he hardens his face, makes sure that he looks aloof and unapproachable. He doesn’t want to spill his story. Not to strangers, not to friends. Not to himself, either, if he’s totally honest with himself. There is a reason why Dean isn’t even aware that Cas has a brother.
“Well, then, I’m sorry to disturb the love fest but I think I should get going. It’ll take a few phone calls to get to the person we need for this. And no offense, but I don’t think the people I’ll call would be too happy if I did it in a room full of Guardians.”
“Yeah, yeah, now go, let me work or there won’t be any food.”
In fact, for some reason his eyes start stinging, and maybe today’s events have had an impact on him that went deeper than he thought. “Better be careful with this, Cas,” he warns, though he doesn’t move or try to block Cas’ access to his skin.
With a sigh, Cas pushes himself off the rail and sits down next to Dean after all. “If it’s any consolation, that’s not what I was going to say.”
“Are you sure?” He isn’t even sure whether he’s asking Dean or Charlie but it doesn’t make much difference, seeing how they both nod.
In fact, he doesn’t let go until Charlie kills the engine. Dean’s expected to end up in a shady part of town, automatically associating the shadiness of their business with back alleys that smell like piss and underground clubs decked in red velvet. But this isn’t that. They’ve ended up in a nondescript industrial area with warehouses and storage facilities, office buildings and a fast food chain at the intersection that leads to the highway.
He’d always known he could hurt Dean. Even before that night. But after that… After that he’d known that he could break his nose, his arm, everything and Dean wouldn't run. He would stay. Would even still love him. Still believe in him.
It brings them in contact in other places, too. As always, Cas isn’t quite sure what he feels about that. There are too many memories of pain interwoven with this for him to be able to enjoy the friction there. As always, he thinks about it for a moment and then decides to concentrate on the kiss again. To enjoy what he has instead of trying to puzzle out what will be in the future. This, at least, he can give Dean without reservations, and Dean seems to accept it in the same manner in return.
It sounds like disbelief, so obviously Dean can’t let it stand.
Only, it’s been a while since he reacted this bitchy to Sam appropriating their Dad’s tone. And yeah, they could have had more success with their case, but this is not the first hunt that drags on longer than planned. It’s not like anyone got hurt or anything, either, even if they got hacked.
Half a minute later, an upset angel joins Sam in the kitchen. “I don’t think this is a very good idea, Sam. Dean does not want to do this.”
happened.
“Sam unconditionally supports us,” Cas pipes up.
Cas’ house turns out to be a small tidy place with a well-kept front lawn. The inside is well-kept, too. It’s orderly and clean, but also colorful and homely. They come in via the kitchen door, which leads into an open living space followed by a hallway.
Especially not since the blonde guy immediately takes him up on it. “That’s a great idea,” he nods. “We’d love to come by.”
Steve should count himself lucky, he guesses, that Bucky’s reaction to him when he perceives Steve angry is to cease and desist, and wait for punishment or new orders. But he doesn’t feel lucky. In a way, it would feel better if Bucky’s first instinct was to attack him. It is that way with Stark, and even with Banner (though they have told him what a singularly bad idea that is). Banner had also been the one who had provided the hopeful view that Bucky somewhere deep down remembers that he can trust Steve no matter what. Steve is more inclined to believe Natasha’s interpretation, who has given him a shrug and a laconic, ‘Someone’s got to give the orders. Since it’s not HYDRA anymore, it might as well be you, gramps. Better get used to it.’
“Sure,” Bucky nods and gets up.
“Heya, Dean.”
For a heartbeat, it’s like everyone stops breathing, then Cas shoves himself in front of Dean again, shielding him from Rowena. “You won't lay a finger on Dean!” Cas growls.
Dean is in the living room, standing indecisively in front of his bedding, when Cas follows him. The couch goes to Sam, that much is clear. Guests don’t have to sleep on the floor, not even when they’re his own brother.
Cas sighs. “No, Dean, nothing is good. And I shouldn’t have told you.”
It’s an order, though it isn’t harsh or even very loud. Cas buries his face in his hands. Too many thoughts. Breathing too shallow.
They lock eyes for a moment, for the first time in a well-lit room and this close. Cas’ eyes are a steely blue that sends a shiver through Dean, but there’s also small crinkles around his eyes, where smiles and laughter have left their marks. He’s smiling now, too, and then he’s running a hand up Dean’s arm, a steady soothing pressure. Dean leans into the touch but makes no effort to reciprocate the gesture. Instead he just does his best to relax the tight set of his muscles.
“Sounds about right.”
“Oh, and you don’t like talking about your feelings,” Charlie smirks and points towards where he has defensively crossed his arms over his chest.
“But…”
“I like you lads. I really, really do. But, ye know? My wares are precious. You would regret making
“No,” Cas answers flatly. “I won’t accept this.”
Well, he swallows heavily. He knows an approximation of it still. The closest he ever got to having this feeling back was with Dean. Mere moments, deep at night, when they were cuddled together after an intense scene, their defenses broken down and the bond between them so palpable that Cas is sure he wouldn’t even have had to touch Dean to still feel him. Moments, when they were beyond words anyway, so it didn’t matter that they didn’t ever find them.
There is a long silence on the other end of the line. Long enough, actually, that Dean checks angelheart’s online status. But yeah, the little green dot is still there. This is getting a little ominous.
The road out to the reservation is not the best kept, gravel replacing concrete after a while. Dean drives carefully, patting Baby’s steering wheel every so often to apologize for making her deal with unpleasant road conditions. He definitely knows why most of Kaia’s family drives four-wheelers. Dean stops at the bottom of Kaia’s driveway, knowing from experience that Baby doesn’t like the deep dirt track up to the house.
“What? No! Unfair!” Claire complains from the back.
“I ordered beer and burgers for the both of us. Thought you’d appreciate it.”
“Well, no, I have no interest in that,” Castiel says but he can feel the slight flush on his face. “So you think it made people better, me telling them what to do?”
There’s a small amused smile on Steve’s face, so he’s totally noticed the gesture. Dean blushes but he also shrugs. Holding on with both hands. It seems like a good plan.
“Which part?” Dean asks. “He knows that I’m flirting with him. Kinda kept it light enough not to immediately push all of my issues on him, though. And he didn’t catch the news coverage of the trial or at least doesn’t remember it. I asked.”
The other redhead laughs. “Duh! Like I don’t know Captain America and the Winter Soldier! Dude, I might be younger than you but I wasn’t born yesterday! I’m Charlie by the way and I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t arrest me.” She adds a nervous smile to that last sentence.
“It’s possibly not the best topic to be talking about out on the street anyway?” Sam bitches and, oh yeah, Sam’s still pissed. Dean almost forgot.
Cas looks around the lot curiously. It’s ten levels shabbier than even Dean’s apartment over the bar, and the house is not much better.
And yeah, maybe Dean doesn’t even want to take the invitation back, though Cas looks at him weirdly. But having visitors over means having to pretend they’re a couple means maybe getting to hold Cas’ hand again. And Dean would do a lot for that. Even entertain the two hunks from next door.
“Is that what we are?” Cas asks. He has the urge to hug his arms around himself but he doesn’t. His frazzled state of mind is clear enough as is.
“You want to ride ahead,” Dean deducts.
Claire calls Bobby, who tells her to give the phone to Dean after she’s made her request but who unsurprisingly agrees that Cas can come after Dean confirms that Cas isn’t evil and out to hurt Claire.
Cas’ eyes blink open again at the gesture, and this time they turn wide as apparently the world crashes back in on him as well. “It’s today,” he says like it’s a surprise.
“You’re always welcome here, Castiel.”
Cas mulls that over for a second. “You want to go back in.”
It could be Sam. It’s probably Sam. Hopefully. Uneasy, he picks the phone up and swipes over the screen.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Shit. Cas,” Dean fends him off, “you can’t be here. She can’t see you with me. It’s bad enough that she saw us come in together. I tried to make her forget that. You need to go.”
that makes him a bit harsher than necessary. Might also just be that being woken up in the middle of the night thing. “Why are we talking about this with a civilian?”
It’s wonderful and exhilarating and a tiny bit frightening, having Bucky fall pliant under him, his trust holding even more weight in the knowledge that he’s starting to remember everything that’s been done to him.
Cas shakes his head but then he smirks again. “Besides, wasn’t it you who said that this was a first date? Nothing untoward is supposed to happen on a first date.”
She smiles at him like a cat who’s looking at a bowl of cream. “An Unsealing? Now….you wouldn’t even be here if I couldn’t, darling.”
“How can my life be better without a dad?”
“Dean? Are we missing an ingredient?”
“Yeah, okay, fair enough,” Charlie admits. “But what are you gonna write back???”
“Assume what?”
“Sam. And Amara.”
“What I want with you?” Cas’ eyebrows rise when he sends another glance towards Dean.
And huh, how have they already made it to the car? Reluctantly, he lets go of Castiel’s warmth to lean against the cold steel of the tiny hybrid. “Doesn’t look like a serial killer car.”
“So, you’ve told me, repeatedly. Now. An in-depth answer please.”
“No, Cas, thank
“I really hope this sorts itself soon.”
“I was not going to tell her anything!” Cas protests. “I was just going to ask her how she knew! Also, I hardly saved her day by handing her a box. She needs to have higher expectations of her life.”
Dean takes a deep breath. “Okay. I’m okay now. Let’s get this started.”
And that’s probably the truth and in the end, it doesn’t even matter when and where they got on their neighbors’ radar. What matters is, “So, what do we do now? I mean, if they’re really after us, they won’t just let us go.”
They’ve dedicated the second guest bedroom as a workout room, so that’s where Steve goes. It means he’s going to have to take another shower, but such are the luxuries of the modern age. You can shower twice a day without going broke.
Well, Dean does need Cas. Or rather, he wants him here. He wants to lean into him and listen to Cas tell him that he’s a good person, a strong person and that things will work out. Only, he’s got to get used to not having Cas here. He’s got to get used to not hearing nice things about himself anymore. They probably never were true in the first place. Not really. Not deep down. Even though he doesn’t doubt that Cas believes them.
Updates will be every other week for now. Thank you for being so understanding and for all the kind words you sent me! They are much appreciated! <3
He still hears that sound of his head connecting with the brick wall. It just echoes and echoes.
Dean groans. “Everything! It has everything to do with it! That guy is just too perfect to be real. Now give me the number.”
Cas nods. “With some luck, the police will conclude that that is what happened.”
“I needed some time to think,” he tries to give her a disarming smile. “I think best on my own.”
. “You’re still Cas, you know? You’re still the person who’s most important to me. The person I don’t want to spend my life without.” He shrugs because words are not his forte but he hopes what he wants to say comes over anyway. “That good enough for now?”
“I’ll do my best,” he promises.
“I don’t think being on time makes someone a monster.”
“Hmm,” Dean looks Cas back over and thinks about it, “you’re not a cop after all. Cops have better friends than veterinarians to get people stitched back up.”
Gabe sighs. “That I’m gonna miss you something awful, little brother. Might even miss this oaf here.” He punches Dean in the shoulder. “So hey, my tears at your funeral won’t be all fake.”
Cas had already reached a comforting hand out towards him but now he draws it back.
Dean sighs and lets go of him, holding his hands up in a peaceful gesture. “I’m sorry, Cas. I shouldn’t have joked like that.”
“Only a little,” Cas says, and he’s staring right at Dean who can’t help but stare right back. That is a tiny smirk in Cas’ eyes, isn’t it?
She puts the lead rope in Dean’s hand, salutes him lazily and turns on her heels. “You’ll find me with the wagons today, Alpha. Your brother is scouting ahead.”
He takes a deep breath and starts writing a message back
And that, that is worth fighting for.
“Because he chose to tell me. He chose to be vulnerable and he hates that more than anything. Whatever else is going on between us, I need to honor that.” He crosses his arms in front of his chest and glares challengingly at Charlie.
then between the two of us we could probably manage to bodily separate you and Amara if necessary.”
“I know,” Cas nods. “That’s also why,” he clears his throat. “I guess it seemed a good day today. To tell you. Because it’s Christmas and we’re alone and…” He tapers off.
It takes another moment and a mental exercise to replace deep lines with smooth skin and an adult body with the lanky features of youth, but then recognition dawns. The blood drains from Cas’ face and his fighting stance slackens. “Balthazar.” He clears his throat, tries to sound less spooked, “What are you doing here?”
Dean cracks up over the
“No, she won’t,” Sam replies, irritated.
Bobby’s eyes narrow. “That mean you’re not gonna tell him and instead gonna wait until he finds out on his own?” It’s clear what he thinks of that.
Dean thinks about that while kicking Princess Peach off the road with a green shell. “You can’t really practice for that whole soulmate shit, though, can you?”
“Cas.” Because it is Cas who he has to explain this to. He owes him that. And it’s the only way Cas will accept this.
Dean wants to shake his head against the words, flees into a litany of ‘he doesn’t know me’ in his head, because it feels so good, so fucking good to have someone care for him and be gentle with him and not expect him to be on top of things. Quite literally not expect him to be on top. But it can’t be. It never is, and he definitely doesn’t deserve it. Doesn’t deserve the kindness of this stranger, who is now leaning his forehead against Dean’s, careful, very careful, so as to not aggravate the stitches.
Cas shakes his head, a hard line settling around his mouth. “See, that's where you’re wrong. You
Well, let’s try this again. He wills his legs to move and this time, the result is a bit better. At least he manages to bend his knees and get his feet somewhat closer to his body. It’s a long way away from standing up, but at least it seems all the essentials are working.
A cold fear takes possession of Dean. “Cas, what - what happened to her?”
And that. That. That leaves Dean speechless.
It all goes over Steve’s head, but for a lack of better word, what she does looks like - texting. Only where Steve has trouble typing out short messages on his phone, Nat’s hands are flying over the keyboard. But there are pauses and replies and once or twice she snorts softly.
“Shit. Shit. Why did I have to meet her? Why couldn’t she live on a different fucking continent? Goddammit.”
But not clear enough for Cas to trust the words, judging by how he’s searching Dean’s face for a lie. “You mean that?”
“None of it was your fault, Buck. I’m not judging you for it.”
Unless it won’t be. He looks at his legs again. He got hit in the head alright. What else? Did anything connect with his spine? A cold fear runs down his back.
And Steve wants to help so much, but no one’s told him how hard this would be on him. How it would eat at him that he’s carrying all of their memories on his own. How hollow it feels to recount something fond and see only blankness in Bucky’s face. How the memories seem to lose color and vibrancy with it.
“I know that,” Dean answers.
Which yeah, Dean had meant it, and he also hadn’t. He’d been drunk and his Dad’s voice had been louder than his own. And yeah, he can’t guarantee that that won’t happen again. He’s trying, though. Noticeable if by nothing else then by how he’s nursing his coke and not even freaking out about Charlie figuring it out.
“Tea is ready, love,” Missouri comes in behind him and puts the tea on the low table.
Cas nods. “I agree.”
Steve nods. That’s a promise he can make. “I’ll be careful. And I’m glad that you still got my back,” he says honestly.
“I brought no overnight bag,” Cas says self-consciously.
So instead of digging himself in deeper he says, “It’s been a while. And it wasn’t - regular army or whatever. Not like you guys.”
“I’m clean, though,” Dean goes on because that’s the second thing that comes to mind. “Not dirt-wise, obviously, but, you know, health-wise.” Because he’s reasonably sure you’re not supposed to touch someone who’s bleeding without gloves.
“But SHIELD couldn’t give us names? Or a description that fit them a bit more accurately?” Bucky scoffs.
"Ah. Mass is done at the LGBT friendly church two towns over. That's their choir. I guess that's it for quiet time." Dean is actually disappointed by that, even though he's not gonna snub the Christmas profit. “Decide what you want to eat and I’ll be right back.”
“Help me with the grocery bags,
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel smiles back.
“Yes,” Bucky nods. “Yes, okay.”
“Seriously, Cas, this looks fantastic.”
“I don’t care. That there’s a lot of them doesn’t make them right. You can believe in God and in free will. In fact, I happen to believe in both and that won't change. This is your decision, Dean. And only yours.”
Dean shakes his head. “That’s not true. I remember you white as fresh snow because you expected me to punish you.”
“Ha ha,” Dean rolls his eyes. “Funny.”
It’s only when Dean makes him aware that Cas notices that his hands had been cramped in the mare’s mane to the point where she’s started to unwillingly shake her head. He makes an effort to relax and pats her neck. “I’m sorry,” he apologizes to both the horse and Dean.
“I want you to have the freaking bed and sleep in your freaking bee covers and on your green sheets, so just accept it!”
His phone rings.
Dean takes position to the left of the horse, brings his hands together to make a stable foothold and bends forward to make it easier for Cas to reach.
“Umm, I think I can do it,” Dean says before deciding, what the hell, the guy has already seen him without his shirt and this way he’s at least getting a close-up. So he amends to, “Though it would probably be easier with help. So yes, thank you.”
Dean’s fingers grip the edge of the furs and he nods. “I’m glad,” he mumbles. “I’m glad that there’s something here that brings you comfort.”
Dean laughs angrily. “I want to make it so that none of this ever happened. But I can’t get what I want, so I’m gonna go back in.”
Dean can see that. His computer looks completely normal again.
Surprisingly, that draws a chuckle out of Bucky. “Not happening, Steve. Unless you order me to go talk to him, that is. But that one responds woodenly, your all-American boy charm is going to work better than me and my Russian tricks.”
And okay, maybe that was a bit harsh. “Look,” Dean sighs and rubs the newly freed hand through his hair, “you and I both know that I’ve gotten through worse. This is nothing. I can handle it, okay?”
It’s not because he wants to see Cas. Not because he wants to get hugged hello. No, it’s just because the area Cas lives in isn’t the safest. Yeah, that’s it. Right. His phone chimes with the answering text.
“Yeah, sure,” Dean echoes.
section. Dean has to admit that he liked the Star Wars ones, but he is not 14 anymore, so no point in buying them. After 10 minutes of discussion, they decided to leave the covers behind for now and moved on to buy sheets. That shouldn’t be that hard, should it? It turns out to be much more complicated that Dean thought.
“I should have just sent her an email,” Dean grumbles low under his breath.
He gives him a fleeting smile and goes to open the door.
“She’s badass! So’s General Organa. And Han Solo, obviously.”
“What? I thought you wanted help,” Sam says innocently.
“So - Practice course?” Charlie asks him after Bowser does his little victory dance while Luigi hasn’t even made it through the second round yet.
“Yeah, I know,” Dean nods.
That’s horrible, undeniably, but try out a few decades. And then amnesia when you’ve finally found each other again.
Cas rubs his forehead. He’s got to give it to Balthazar. He has successfully managed to divert him from his impending panic attack. Consequently, Cas decides, “Coffee. We’re going to end up discussing sex lives anyway. So let’s not do that at a cemetery.”
“Good,” Amara answers sharply. Then her wide smile is back. “I’m so glad that you called me to ask me to meet with you, Dean. I’m so happy to see you!”
He doesn’t even really notice what he’s said until he feels Bucky’s gaze burning a hole through him. And yeah, he has just pretty much assumed Bucky would be willing to move in with him for real, huh?
“On me?” Dean gives him a little half-smile, more vulnerable than he wants to be.
The head tilt disappears as Cas’ smile grows the longer Dean is talking about pie, and well, yes, Dean has thought a lot about pie over the years, sue him. He breaks off with a frown because really Cas shouldn’t be making fun of him for what is a brilliant idea.
Dean’s already pretty convinced that the king of hell couldn’t devise a more exquisite torture than this and that is before Sam stops in the midst of his stream of consciousness and says, “Shit. I forgot to ask you the most important part. Dean, Jess and I thought - would you like to be the kid’s Godfather? I mean, you’re going to be the favorite Uncle anyway and - I would really love for you to be the Godfather and be as involved as you can in raising this kid.”
Hiding is very rarely an option anymore but right now, Cas really wishes it would be. Or that Dean would at least not have brought his biology into this argument. He can feel his face burn at the mention of his heat, a topic whose discussion he hates almost as much as the thing itself. To know that it is not only a public point of discussion, but an argument for their course of travel, is nauseating.
“It’s not noon yet!” Dean protests and checks the time. 11:23am. Holy shit. “Uhh, okay, I take that back.”
“Jess? What happened?” Dean asks in lieu of a hello. “Is Sam okay? Are
He reaches for his phone, makes a picture of the wristband and attaches it to a message.
“So do we know any monsters that make a habit out of being on time?” Dean asks and elicits an eye-roll and a sigh in Cas.
“Oh,” Cas says quietly. “I forgot.”
That had shut up both the woman and Cas. Long enough for Dean to drag Cas away anyway, before he had freed himself from Dean’s grasp with an indignant huff and said death glare.
“Both the omelette and the pancakes are very good, Dean,” Cas remarks, maybe trying to bring them back onto safe territory.
“Fuck the rules of conduct,” Bucky replies heatedly. “I’ve had decades of someone else’s rules telling me what I could do. You’re not taking the one thing that I know that I want away from me now.”
Dean groans, while Charlie chuckles.
She nods at the bruise on his wrist and Dean quickly rolls down his sleeve again. All of this attention on him is giving him the creeps. But then, his brother’s eyes are wide and watery and Cas still looks ready to commit murder, so Dean guesses it’s better if he stays as unemotional as he can.
“So you’re okay with this?” he asks to make sure.
That sounds like an understatement. But there’s something else that makes Cas tilt his head. “Is she the Alpha or the Omega?” Though of course it should be impossible for an Omega to have the power to decide about housing them. But with this pack, everything is possible.
“Then prove it,” Cas growls back.
“Good,” Amara nods and lets go of his hand to get out her phone. “So give me your current address. Unless you’re moving back to that hole in a wall you call an apartment?”
“What?” Dean asks dumbfounded, steam taken out of him.
Dean risks a quick glance upwards. Cas is frowning but he’s looking right through him. It’s like he’s frowning at himself.
Dean narrows his eyes. SHIELD, huh? So much for the organization not existing anymore. But then, the people standing in front of him were also not supposed to be existing. Or at least one of them. “So does that mean we can also still call you
“Dean? Dean, are you alright? Dean, look at me!” Cas is suddenly kneeling next to him, his hand cupping Dean’s face, making him look at him.
Dr. Shurley sighs. “I can see that. I can also see that the one hundred times that I have tried to tell you that a human is not an overgrown hamster have not helped.”
He finds it safer not to answer, unsure that it wouldn’t be an embarrassing squeak that makes its way out of his mouth, and instead focuses on calming his breathing. Not that it works. Because Cas observes him curiously and that does nothing for Dean’s composure, either.
“Dean?”
Bobby announces midway through that the usual Christmas emergency call from a car that needs a tow truck has come in. He waves Dean off when he asks whether he needs help, and yeah, Jo’s already getting her old overall. She’s always had a good hand for cars. Dean’s pretty sure that she’s gonna come right back here when her engineering degree is done, and that she’ll turn the whole place inside out and make it into something that’s actually profitable.
Cas shakes his head unwillingly. “I’m not showing you this because I want your pity. I would never have shown you this if not…” He turns his head away, takes a deep breath. When he looks back his face is determined. “This is from before. From before she met him. Her
“This?” Dean asks with a raised eyebrow.
Peggy? Steve had so not been thinking about marrying Peggy in, well, 70 years or so.
But Cas doesn’t seem to care either way. He takes the apron from Dean and looks it over. It’s the plain, grown-up kind and Dean for a brief moment wishes he’d gone for the
And really, this is as good as going with Amara. In fact, this is better. Because Dean’s got a feeling that his friends and family would try to keep contact with him, even if he asks them not to. They’d try to keep him safe even when it brings them into the path of danger. If he’s dead, Amara has no reason to go after them. She won’t harm them. All Dean has to do is to stay far away. And he can discuss that with Cas when they’re alone. Make him see reason. Make him see that Dean’s not worth giving your whole life up for.
“Don’t you understand what I’m saying?” Steve asks pleadingly.
“You could always just tell me,” Cas answers drily.
Still, there’s a nervous lump in Dean’s throat and he has to swallow it down before he reaches for Cas’ hand. He fumbles for a moment because he’s not brave enough to actually look at Cas while he’s doing it. There is an initial jolt of surprise and for a second Dean thinks Cas is going to shake his hand off. But then Cas’ fingers grip his and when Dean gathers enough courage to look at Cas out of the corner of his eye, there’s even a small smile on his face. Dean lets out a breath he hadn’t known he was holding.
And Dean’s pretty sure his own voice is not up to any actual words right now, so all he does is nod. Because yeah, the warmth feels good. Grounding. Like that anchor he was desperately searching for earlier.
He shakes off the snowflakes, decides to rather get rid of his whole cloak, doesn’t want to bring wetness to the furs again, that have just started drying.
It’s Cas’ turn to snort. “I’ll do my best to dissuade him. But I was being serious, Dean. My brother is not a bad person. Underneath everything. He might be able to help. And if it’s just that when he knows
But Cas pushes away, not much, but enough that he can tilt up Dean’s face so that they are looking at each other again. “Then tell me, how are you going to make sure I’m not going too far?” he asks.
“Yeah, yeah, big brother, pain in the butt. Whatever. So listen, I looked into Crowley vs Abaddon, and boy, that was one big mess. Without the Unsealing, those two would have killed each other at some point, I have no doubts.“
There’s a moment of silence, then the man starts rummaging in his pockets. Dean’s immediately back on high alert but when the man retrieves what he was looking for, it’s just a handkerchief. An honest to God old-fashioned cotton handkerchief.
“I did not say that.” Cas fidgets in his chair, his eyes suddenly not wanting to meet Dean’s.
“To be honest, I really would like that. I would love to never talk about any of this bullshit ever again. To bury it deep down and have it forgotten. But if I do that, then those assholes have a hold over me. And it’s enough that -,” he breaks off. But then, he’s come this far. “It’s enough that the thing itself still has a hold over me. I haven’t had a serious relationship since. One-night stands here and there. With girls, mostly, cause - well, cause they’re smaller than me. And cause they don’t usually get off on telling me what a slut I am and how I should get punished for it.” He grimaces. That was more info than he had wanted to let slip. “Anyway, that whole thing isn’t the only shitty thing that happened to me, but it’s kinda prominent, so - I thought you should know.”
The woman fixes Gabriel with her gaze. “Ah yes, of course. Please. Do excuse the commotion,” she gestures at their surroundings. “The import-export-business runs 24 hours a day, ah’m afraid. Let’s do find someplace quieter to talk.”
Just at that moment, Cas looks up from where he’s still taking helping very seriously. They lock eyes over the expanse of the room. Cas gives him a shy smile and Dean answers it with a small smile of his own. Then Claire asks Cas about hanging a straw star and the moment breaks.
“How long have I been leading this pack, Sam?”
“Dean, come on,” Sam finally relents. “You know as well as I do that you’re needed here. They need their Alpha. I’m expendable. I’m the one you send on missions like this.”
“I am, dude, I am. I am way more supportive than I ever thought I could stand without puking.” She groans again. “I really didn’t need to know this about you.”
“So, you’re all bluster on the outside but have a few self-worth issues on the inside.”
“No need to tell me. Would have done that anyway.”
“What? NO!” He half-shouts it and then promptly frantically checks whether his brother heard him before he remembers, oh yeah, Sam’s out with the dog. He coughs embarrassedly but Cas’ expression is still caught somewhere between fear and hope and the fear is awful to look at and Dean has to do something to make that look go away. He takes a deep breath and mans up. “The only way in which I don’t want us to be
“No, as a matter of fact, it is not,” Cas shakes his head and comes close enough to put a hand on Dean’s arm. Dean lets him, too. “Shit happens, Dean.”
“Oh great.” There is nothing much else to say to this. “Alright. I’ll ignore this for now. But this isn’t over, Sam. We’ll talk about it again.”
“Eileen,” Charlie nods. “That was the name. I think they were meeting up tonight.”
“No, no, you’re right of course, it’s a good thing. Good recon. You should report to SHIELD that he’s military. Though they really should have known that before they sent us here. And told us about it.”
“Why d’you ask? I can do what I want, I am centuries old. And yoooouu do it all the time,” Cas sing-songs.
It’s not Cas, who answers, though. “Oh Goddess, Dean, stop with the religious bullcrap. The fact that they taught you that in fucking kindergarten does not make it true,” Charlie snaps.
“Castiel, huh?” Bucky answers and is back to sounding slightly off.
“I thought so,” Missouri smiles. She busies herself with the mugs and the tea, giving him time to adjust.
He sighs. Well, if nothing else it’ll come over as honest. Because the messages are a clear mirror of his internal dialogue.
Bucky rolls his eyes, but it’s good-natured. “Not meaning what you’re implying, Steve.”
What Dean does know is that he is annoyed. Because he’s finally decided to scrounge up the courage to come out to his brother (and ugh that word alone), and now his brother isn’t even listening. The only times that he looks up from his notebook are when his cell-phone dings. As if that in itself isn’t suspicious enough, Sam lights up brighter than his phone screen every time he gets a text.
They exchange a glare that Steve can’t really decipher. There’s tension there, yeah, buckloads of it, but it doesn’t necessarily look like a
“Oh Dean,” Cas murmurs and inexplicably his voice has gone soft.
“Didn’t know you could do that,” Bucky says. He’s following each and every of Natasha’s movements. Steve has given up on that ten minutes ago. Maybe Bucky can decipher any of what’s happening here, Steve sure can’t.
But then it suddenly seems a lot easier when Cas turns around in his sleep and buries his face in the crook of Dean’s neck. Dean’s arm comes up around his boyfriend’s (boyfriend’s!) back, and with a kiss to Cas’ hair he falls back into a half-slumber as well.
“Yes, you’re probably right,” Dean agrees but he doesn’t back down. “Pyjama bottoms. Cuddling is a yes, sex is a no.” He kind of really wants Cas to hear the
” He shudders again.
Cas looks at him puzzled. “But you just told me you didn’t want to spend your life alone.”
“Yeah, but I’m an assassin, not a spy. You’re supposed to be dead by the time you notice the arm.”
“Agreed,” Charlie nods. “We hadn’t quite gotten around to that part yet. I was about to tell him that I wanted no part of that, either. I can deal with breaking the law, I can’t deal with being complicit to delivering someone to an abuser.”
Dean bites his lips because Cas has to know what he is referring to. “You know.”
Dean decides that it’s safer not to answer that one.
“I - I don’t know, man.” Dean drops back heavily in his chair. “Shit.”
Dean bites his lip. But he’d known this was coming. “Yeah, and I’m guessing hearing about all of this doesn’t make you any fonder of the thought that she’s been in my care for the past few years. I won’t hold it against you. I’m the first to agree that kids should have a chance to be kids before being confronted with the ugliness of the world. But Claire is smart and she’s resourceful, and she may be caustic and have built some walls to protect herself, but she’s also got a big heart and she knows right from wrong. And I kinda think that under the circumstances that’s the best way she could have turned out. I’m proud of her, and a little proud also of how we’ve managed the past few years. So, you know, I refuse to feel guilty. On that account, anyway.” God knows there’s enough he feels guilty about otherwise.
“Want to help us with this?” Steve asks her to steer the topic away from the abyss for now.
Dean can’t, then, even though, yes, he should test her, but “Goddammit, Charlie!” He closes his arms around her and hugs her so tight that it feels like he should be crushing her, but she hugs him back just as fiercely.
Cas doesn’t know, but he nods anyway.
“It never broke down.”
“Sorry,” Dean wheezes. “Still, not used to that.”
I want to protect you, Dean, and I will protect you from myself if I have to.
It takes effort but he turns his head. If he’s still in the alley behind the Roadhouse everything is fine. They’ll come and find him in a minute. He’s in for another lecture from Ellen of course, about not calling for help and taking on the assholes on his own. But he’s heard it before, and Ellen never stays angry too long.
By the end of that, the sky has long grown dark and their eyes are mostly fallen shut.
angry at me
Sam shrugs and mumbles, "Lawyer," at the same time that Cas says, "It's okay, Dean." Then he turns back to Sam. "I would tell you about it, but I have intentionally not checked up on any of you. So you'd have to prove the necessary security clearance to me."
“To clean up the dishes.”
“What about you?” Dean asks and breaks the eye contact with his partner abruptly, “How did you meet?”
“You - what?” Dean shakes his head to clear it but it doesn’t help with his confusion.
“You are. Everyone who knows is. And I tell you right now, it’s not necessary. I have lived fine without a soulmate so far, I’ll live fine without one for the rest of my life.”
But of course it wouldn’t be Cas if he’d listen so easily. “You have also saved so many.”
“God, no. I hate her. She always blue-shells me.”
Dean is so flabbergasted that Cas manages to turn around and stomp out of the room before Dean can get his bearings enough to follow him. Fortunately, Dean was leaning against the front door, so Cas is stomping away deeper into the house. “Cas, wait.”
And that doesn’t sound like Cas is going to throw him out, even though Dean shouted at him in his own house. That’s something. “I’m an asshole, Cas. I know it. I’m sorry.”
“That is impressive,” Bucky whistles through his teeth.
“What? Where?” Cas startles out of his thoughts.
But at least the fear is slowly melting out of Cas’ eyes, replaced by something new and shiny like hope and starlight. And yeah, Dean is a bad poet, but it’s much nicer to look at Cas when he looks like this. If only there wasn’t still the tight ball of dread in Dean’s stomach when he thinks about making this official. If only he didn’t see his father’s disapproving gaze as clearly as if his old man was still here. Hell, he probably is watching from somewhere right now.
“I’m sorry,” he apologizes again. “I can do the dishes on my own if you want away from me for a bit. Or, I don’t know, I can go find a place if you want me out of your house.”
“When you left her and her mom. Did you run?”
Hannah smiles, though it isn’t a wide smile, it’s small and contemplative. “I had hoped. But it’s good to hear it.”
“But you two seem so…,” she looks from Dean to Cas and back.
And then Dean has 170 pounds of solid human hanging from his neck, enveloping him in a hug. It takes a moment for his brain to register and then for his arms to unknot themselves and then - he shouldn’t. He should push him away. But instead, Dean’s arms come up around Cas’ back, holding him close.
“What? Sorry, Jess. Not quite awake yet,” Dean tries to cover up that he had been drifting.
When they make camp that night, the volume in their corral seems subdued compared to the nights before. They stay close to each other now, the need for shared heat larger than the need for privacy. The pack still tries to give Dean and Cas as much space as they can, to let them find moments on their own, but huddled together under the insufficient shelter of trees or the fabric and leathers they string between their wagons if no other shelter is to be found, no one has a space to themselves. In a way, Cas is glad that things came to a head before the beginning of winter. If he was still not talking to them, still not part of them, he isn’t sure he could have suffered this many humans this close.
“Not sure I can comply with that,” Dean smirks.
Cas looks at him a little bit like Dean is an exotic exhibit at the zoo or like he just spoke Martian, so Dean decides to shoo him out for now. “I’ll explain later, I promise. Now go, get out of your work clothes and find something with a loose fitting belt line. Between the burgers and the pie you’ll need it.”
“Green.” There’s no question about it. Not with Cas close enough to him that he can feel his body heat burn into his skin. It is a better pain killer than ibuprofen, and again, he has to fight the urge to reach out. To slide his hands under the annoying t-shirt now that they’ve cleared up that they both want to touch. To find out how the strong muscles that held him up feel under his hands. But he doesn’t want to fuck up already when he’s just told Cas that he’s going to do what he says. So Dean just turns his head up to look at Cas and wait where he wants to take this.
“Also, just to inform you, Simpson and I are going to make a detour on our way back to the bunker. We’re visiting Eileen. Remember her? The hunter we met at Oak Park Retirement Home? She’s kind of my girlfriend. So don’t expect us back for a few weeks at least.”
“Bucky,” his brain finally makes the connection. They’re in bed - in an actual bed -, it’s still dark out and someone just rang the doorbell.
“Good boy,” Missouri smiles.
Cas freezes. “I - no. Should we use yours?”
couple. And now they are -
Dean looks closer at the picture, but no, he’s never seen the woman before. “Who is she?” he asks.
“The what now?” Steve asks. He’s pretty sure that none of this makes any sense. He looks over to Bucky. “Do you know what they’re talking about?”
Only now, he doesn’t know.
“That would be quite illegal,” Dean finally says drily. Kevin is, after all, the other underage member of their group next to Sam.
“Nah, my boxers are just fine,” Dean answers automatically before it catches up to him that sleeping in just boxers displays a hell of a lot of skin. “Uhh, if that’s okay with you, that is.”
“Dean.” And just like that Cas is in his space again, catching his sleeve and holding onto it. “Please don’t do this, Dean.”
“With us, nothing.” Sam shifts back up on his couch with a worried frown.
Dean fidgets uncomfortably under that gaze. “Cas, I - I know it was wrong to shut you out. I won’t do it again, okay?”
“That’s me,” Bucky points to a mostly finished figure, cards held loosely in his hands, concentrated not on the game but on watching Steve. There’s an easy smirk playing on image-Bucky’s lips that has yet to make an appearance in the modern world.
Dean pats her back. "I guess that's our sign to go to bed and sleep it over. I told him I'd text him whether he can come by for Christmas but I can always do that in the morning."
Dean shrugs. They've had this argument before. It ends in a stalemate every time. "Won't stop me from helping."
"You got it." Dean takes out the pan and starts taking stuff out of the fridge.
“Umm,  you two just seem - very close,” Charlie answers and looks a little taken aback by the new information.
“To find him. Yeah, I thought that that was deliberate.” Balthazar sighs. “It’s because he trusted you to be able to take it, not because he wanted to punish you. And he knew that you knew him too well. You would have noticed, had he said goodbye. In opposition to me, you would have stopped him. And he didn’t want to be stopped.”
“But…” Only he has no actual sentence planned to follow that up with. So instead he turns to watch the others again. They’ve moved on to the other side of the tree, though Sam and Eileen seem to rather be cuddling than helping now. “You really saw him looking?” he asks Ellen.
They seem perfectly fine without him, so Steve leaves them be.
He sighs but nods. “Stone Shatter City it is. I’ll tell the others.”
Where he promptly drops down on the bed. Because all of this? A little much. In fact, there are so many thoughts swirling around his head that it’s hard to grab a hold of any of them. And his emotions? Even worse. He doesn’t have to dig deep to find the pain. Sam, Sam’s unborn child, leaving his whole life behind. There’s enough pain in this moment to cover a whole life-time.
“Oh.” Dean crumbles in a little further on himself. So maybe he has to do this on his own after all. “I see. I’m sorry for asking.”
Dean isn't sure whether he’s jealous of Chris Evans but for a brief moment he considers getting a dog. “I didn't know that you’re a dog person.”
“I will,” Steve promises, glad that Bucky seems more normal.
Problem is, he doesn’t know this alley. It’s small and dark and it smells of piss, but the tell-tale lights of the Roadhouse aren’t there. There are no real lights at all. There’s the noise of cars in the distance, and the rustling of something a lot closer. Rats going through garbage bins where he’s been dumped probably.
“Texted me. Told me you were about to do something stupid. Don’t think he meant cleaning your apartment, though,” she frowns. “So what did he mean?”
“Oh.” This renders Dean speechless for a moment. Then he asks, “What
From this close, Dean can see that he’s wearing a suit and a trench coat. Rich, then. And not a mugger. That’s good. He feels relieved until the man’s words catch up to him. “Ambulance? No way, man, don’t!” It comes out more frantic than he intends.
There is a bit more back and forth and then the smile comes back to Sam’s face and he starts nodding enthusiastically. “On the way back, yes, I can do that. I’ll tell Dean as soon as I’m back at the house. I’ll let you know, okay?” His smile gets softer at whatever follows that and then he nods again. “Yeah, I’ve been missing you, too,” he says quietly before he first points at himself, then lays his hands over his heart and finally points at the screen. “I’ll see you soon.” There’s a wistful moment after Sam ends the phone call. Then he clears his throat. “Uh, sorry for this. But thanks for holding him.”
His smile is crooked and somewhat sad. “Was already better than the blue slips. And that was better than being court-martialed. I’m glad that no one has to hide anymore, now. Legally, anyway,” Steve sighs. “What people do because of prejudices is a whole different matter.”
“What, and you are the only one who’s immune?” The sarcasm is audible.
There is a sudden break in the text of the command box that belongs to the third party. Only the original window is still the same, Natasha’s code running through it uninterrupted. Then there’s a flurry of activity. It’s all weird symbols and quickly executed commands as far as Steve can see, but Natasha smirks and then starts a new round of commands in her window, while keeping an eye on what’s happening in the other window.
Benny and Jo are already scouting ahead to see whether they find a place to camp for the night when Sam makes his way to them.
“You should offer them refreshments,” Bucky says.
“That will be all, thank you,” Amara talks over him.
He guesses it makes sense, though. Both in terms of their need to stage a suicide without a body and in terms of Dean’s history. It does have a certain symmetry, Dean going out the same way his mom did.
He’d tried to ask Gabe about that several times now, how they’re even going to work around the whole fact that there’s going to be a police investigation and everything, and they’ll hopefully not have an actual body to present to them.
Some of that El Sol promptly makes its way down the wrong pipe at the word
“Trust me, Cas, we haven’t tried holy water yet. He’s going to get upset.”
“Jesus, Cas,” Sam holds his hands up in defense and takes a few steps backward to get some space between them. Angry angel is never good, no matter how fallen. “You’re family, okay? No one is planning on throwing you out. Dean shouldn’t have done it the first time around, either. Alright?”
He adds a nervously sweating emoji to that last one.
“You were lost to her already,” Hannah says patiently. “She knew it.”
“But Dean….”
“I could never forgive myself if you got hurt.”
It’s been a wild ride from stand-alone short story (now the first chapter) over “This can’t stand! Cas is not an asshole!” via “Dean and Cas are on the right path but real life keeps us from writing” to here, where Dean and Cas are happily reunited and have the chance to build a better, healthier future. We hope you enjoyed the ride just as much as we did (minus the real life interference, that sucked). There will be one more chapter, an epilogue some time later. So keep tuned one more time!
"Okay, we're not talking about that," Dean draws a line. "As for how straight he is, well, that's a discussion you gotta have with him."
He actually says it out loud but of course the universe doesn’t answer. Unless the bland disinterest is his answer. Maybe the universe doesn’t care. Maybe mistakes like this happen all the time because the universe stopped giving a fuck a long time ago.
With Dean’s rising anger, Cas’ voice gets harder, too, resignation replaced by cold fury. “You are now, but what about tomorrow? In a year? You have left me behind before. It’s only because you needed me that you came back. One day the world won’t need saving anymore. What then? How long will it take you to forget?”
A smile ghosts over Cas’ face. “Yes, Dean. ‘Spy kind of crap.’” He uses actual finger quotes and everything.
of soulmates and bonds. This?” He pushes back his sleeve and holds his wrist under Dean’s nose. “This is a tattoo. I don’t have a seal. Not one that hasn’t found its counterpart, not one that has been broken, just none. I have
For a long moment, they sit in silence. Where talking to Castiel is easy, talking to Dean is not. It doesn’t help that Dean is suspicious of them to begin with. There just isn’t a single topic of conversation that comes to Steve’s mind. He wishes to God that Bucky and Castiel would hurry up and save them from the awkwardness.
“Of course not,” Cas scoffs, though he does it quietly.
“Will you tell me more about her?” Dean asks and points at the picture frame. “When we’re in California and have the time?”
“You, too, Cas.” Dean wiggles a little more, maximising the warmth spreading through him, and when he closes his eyes, the exhaustion of the emotional day hits him like a freight train and it’s surprisingly easy to fall asleep.
“She outranks me, Cap,” Bucky says, but there’s a small smirk attached to it.
“I can’t stay bonded with her. Don’t you understand?”
“Nah,” she waves dismissively. “Do what you normally do. Just, you know, on a horse.”
It’s a relief when the door to the gents’ falls closed behind him. He leans against it for a moment, breathing heavily and trying to regain his bearing. Then someone tries to come in. His heart hammers in his chest immediately, but he moves to the side. It’s not Amara, who comes in, though, it’s Cas.
“Yep. She came looking for a job. She’d heard the place was friendly and she was plain broke. Course she was also 14, had no place to sleep and hadn’t washed in around a week. It wasn’t that hard to needle the truth out of her. I made her a deal. She’d help out a little around the place and get her ass back into school, I’d give her a place to sleep and whatever food I’m scrunching up in the kitchen. She accepted.”
“If you say so.” Dean doesn’t even try to keep the suspicion out his voice, he just stares intently at Steve, trying not to miss any even subtle reaction.
Well, Dean understands that.
She tilts her head to the side, fixing him with a stare that’s lost much of its warmth. Not that Dean thinks the warmth had ever been real. “I don’t like being lied to, Dean.”
“I’d love to spend tonight drawing,” Steve says. “Would that be okay with you?”
“You expecting anyone?” Natasha holds him back.
“Dean,
“And that’s you?” Bucky points to the figure leaning against the tree.
Cas glares at him and one of these days the smiting is going to happen, but then the doorbell rings again and Cas turns around and shouts, “Coming!”
“You’ve never asked for my address.”
“Umm, yeah, not quite the same thing. Here. Apron.” Dean throws him the second apron he’s grabbed at the store so that Cas doesn’t ruin yet another one of his dress shirts.
are flirting with you and last I checked
Gabriel spots them even before Amara does, his eyes going wide and worried. Cas nods at him, his face more determined than ever.
“You’d have to leave.” Cas’ voice suddenly rings hollow. “You’d have to disappear.”
“You assumed I was trying to extort you just a second ago,” Cas points out.
It’s an attempt to lighten the mood but Cas’ expression stays heavy. “I’m just not - very good at this.”
“No one wants to lose their families if they still have them,” Bucky says and there is something dark in his eyes that speaks of loss.
But suddenly, Dean can’t leave it at that. He’s been less than happy when Cas made him spill the beans, but now, Dean has to know. “What is it, Cas? What have you never?” Dean turns his hand so that he can lay his palm against Cas’. Still loose. Still not a hold. Still just a connection.
Bucky thinks about it, then he shakes his head. “I’ve read the name in the old files. But no memories, sorry.”
,” Cas repeats determinedly. “We’re going to need glasses.”
And while that makes sense, the thoughtfulness and kindness from Gabe is so unexpected that it sends another shiver of foreboding through Dean. Especially when Gabe goes on to say that he’s “gonna make sure that your suicide is a good one”.
an opinion and Dean doesn’t need him interfering on his behalf anyway. Not that Cas has any right to that, either, seeing how he is the one who caused all the trouble in the first place.
“Dean? Your address?”
He takes a deep breath. “Yes. Yes, call her. I want to go through with this.” Then he turns to Charlie. “And California is fine.” At least there’s beach and it’s warm if he in fact ends up living on the street.
“We’re not endangering the whole pack when we can scout out a location first, either.”
“So you’re a grunt?” And yeah, maybe Dean is ignoring that it’s weird that Bucky doesn’t seem to know about that regulation in order to be able to be rude to him on purpose.
“What do you think, two more batches?”
Steve can’t hold onto himself anymore and rushes forward to wrap Bucky up in a bone-crushing hug. “I love you, too, Buck. Oh God, I love you so much.”
It makes Dean’s stomach queasy, dragging it out into the open like that. “Do you think…” But he breaks off.
“How does she – how does she cope with that?” He isn’t even sure whether he means the loss of the pup or the fact that the pup existed in the first place. Fertile Betas aren’t sold like Omegas, but they’re seen as freaks of nature that society generally shuns.
“What happened?” Dean is instantly on alert again.
A chortled burst of laughter finds its way out of Dean’s chest, because maybe he should just go and ask Cas instead of trying to make sense of his own feelings. Cas knows better what Dean feels than he does himself, probably.
“I don’t know. A checklist that I could check off? Remember this, do that, suddenly things are better?” He smiles a little sheepishly. “It sounds very naive, doesn’t it?”
“Don’t… don’t call me that, please. Not here. Actually, not ever. Please,” Cas stutters.
Charlie forbids them from pretty much doing anything by themselves to plan for their new life. “Let me and Fergus hammer out the details. Don’t even go looking at California webpages. There can be no trail leading from here to there. Cas needs to go do his job and be as inconspicuous as possible right until your funeral. He and Sam can make a big scene with Amara there if she shows up, and then after that Cas can disappear. Grief makes you do crazy things after all.”
Yep, concussion or no concussion, Dean can’t help himself. He grins. “You going to punish me if you don’t?”
“Cas!” Dean stops him before this can spiral out of control again. “Come home already, will ya?”
you are than
Dean doesn’t understand Cas’ answer but he sees the nods and the small smiles. So whatever Cas said, Charlie agrees with it.
“Uhh, you’re a Guardian.”
And alright, this is not getting them anywhere. Dean needs to change tack.
“Practically, she made a deal with Stark. And Maria Hill knows about it, even if she never signed off on it.”
Dean has little choice but to smile and agree with him, even though it is a good pie and maybe he’d like to eat the rest of it.
Cas notices it, too, because his head comes up from where it had been buried and then he’s looking at Dean and Dean is looking at Cas and then Cas is biting his lip and he’s looking at Dean’s lips and then back up at Dean’s eyes, question plain. So Dean wraps a hand around Cas’ neck, slowly, carefully, giving him all the time in the world to move away. Only Cas stays, and when Dean leads him closer, he follows willingly, and then Dean’s eyes fall closed and there are lips on his. They are warm and a little chapped and they taste salty still from that popcorn they’ve eaten, and the kiss is a chaste little thing, but it’s the first kiss that resonates in Dean’s heart and produces butterflies in longer than he cares to remember.
Cas makes as if to go, but then turns around again before he actually leaves the kitchen. “And Dean?”
“Ehh, I know what I’m doing,” Charlie shrugs.
“I never want to be that again, Steve. If they re-take me…”
“Hey!” Dean scoffs. “Not old!”
“You don’t trust easily, do you?” Steve says, his expression suddenly much more good-natured again.
“I - I’m fine.” There’s a pause and a stumble before the lie that hadn’t been there when he was younger. He’s gotta learn to cover that up again. The faster the better. For now, he presses on. “Listen, we gotta talk. Preferably soon.”
Cas smiles and drops the towels on the bed before coming over. He’s lost the trench coat and suit jacket on the way, but he’s still wearing the tie. Somehow, Dean’s eyes are drawn to it before he looks back up at Cas’ face.
“If he finds out from The National Enquirer, that’s gonna derail shit that much harder,” Bobby points out, not unreasonably.
“I wish it could have been.” Dean’s voice is back to being toneless. But he’s come this far. “Wish that the universe had decided differently. Wish that it had given me your mark,” he admits.
It sounds grumpy and more than a little endearing. Still, Dean isn’t convinced. He’s posted a public comment and suddenly angelheart has a tumblr? Yeah, right.
“No,” Cas shakes his head. “It’s not weird. It’s brave.”
Though Steve’s less unpredictable in his response. He predictably argues with, then yells at and finally punches anyone who tries to keep him away from Bucky. That is one thing that Tony’s had to learn the hard way. And he had needed a few repetitions before he’d gotten it. “I lost him before. I’m not doing it again.” He holds Bucky’s gaze for that, makes sure he sees the truth of that statement, all too aware that Bucky can’t know what part of their story as he’s telling it right now is told for the benefit of their audience and what part is true.
“I had backup,” Dean says indignantly.
“It was the army, Nat,” Steve chides. “In the 40s. Believe me, whatever your personal feelings, you didn’t want to get caught with - something like this.”
“Yeah, boy did well,” Dean agrees. “Eileen’s a keeper.”
“Cas, man, you okay? Is this about the bunker and…” Suddenly, the picture of him looming over a beaten down, bloodied angel is more vivid than it had been in weeks.
“Yes,” Cas nods. “Yes, I think that’s a very good plan.”
He turns off the TV and methodically checks the house. Makes sure the oven and stove are off and the lights are out and the fridge is closed. He stops for a moment when he picks up the bag with everything that’s meant for the flames. If Sam wrote him again, now is his last chance to see the message. Once he’s at the place Rowena has chosen, this bag and his fate will be out of his hands.
“Pie, dude, pie!” Dean growls and all but shoves the pie into Steve’s hands. “We brought you pie. Cause that’s the kind of awesome neighbors we are.”
There’s a heaviness about Cas’ words that makes Dean look up at him. It seems like the dark bags under Cas’ eyes have managed to multiply in the short span of the last two minutes. “Same. I mean, I want you to be happy, too, Cas. If there’s anything I can do to help with that, you let me know, right?”
Bucky repeats, “I’m sorry”, and it brings Steve back to the present.
“That might be a frikking long time,” Dean says and admits more with that than he wants to say.
Immediately, all his muscles lock up and his stomach revolts. It’s not her fault, of course. She doesn't know how often he heard that his jailers were going to pray for him right before they sent another electroshock through his body. He shudders and has to force his body still before he can grit out a “thank you.”
Dean turns slightly red at that and mutters something under his breath that is probably not completely friendly, but he doesn’t stop what he’s doing. He adjusts the length of the leathers fastening each of the stirrups to the saddle and then carefully places Cas’ legs and feet in the right position.
uncomfortable. I’m basically invading your home and who knows how long I’m going to want to stay.” Dean gives himself the answer to this:
Hey guys. It's been a while and this chapter is shorter than usual. But there's a pandemic going on (I'm gathering you've noticed 😬) and it messes up stuff quite a bit. Anyway, I hope Dean and Cas still bring you some joy!
as in
“Oh, for God’s sake,” the man huffs and takes the handkerchief from Dean again, just to lean in and press it against Dean’s forehead.
“What happened exactly?” Steve asks because he’s still completely lost.
The silence that follows it is deafening. Dean crosses his arms over his chest and keeps his eyes on his brother, the challenge clear in his stance.
Bucky nods, smile turning a bit wider. “So how’s civilian life going for you?”
“Of course,” Steve nods.
“Until yesterday,” Cas agrees.
And Cas guesses he really ought to stop doing that. “Him,” he amends.
“I love you, too, Dean,” he says and leans forward, easily capturing Dean’s lips with his own.
Ellen frowns at him. “It’s not forbidden, you know. To pursue something that makes you happy. I mean, look at Sam.”
“Yes, Cas, I do,” Dean nods and draws Cas closer so that he can hide his face against Cas’ hair. “Is that wrong of me?”
“Yeah, okay,” Dean shrugs and tries to make it sound obnoxious. “So I didn’t actually miss your stupid face, sue me. But you try sitting in the house all day, waiting for your friends and family to figure out something to do about your situation while you’re pretty much damned to twiddling your thumbs. See how you like it.”
“If they re-take me,” Bucky repeats, “I need someone to take me out. And I trust you the most.”
“Dude, you can tell me anything. In fact, I’m a bit pissed that you didn’t tell me before.”
Dean backs into the wall but Cas doesn’t let up, instead he growls right into his face, “
“Why, universe, why?”
“That’s the rest of the lemonade, in case you were wondering. Can I see what you’re drawing?”
And this is not getting them anywhere. “Please explain,” Dean asks her and pushes Cas a step to the side so that he can actually look at Rowena while talking to her. Cas literally growls at that but he gives a few inches.
“He’s not…” “I’m not…” They start at the same time.
“Right,” Dean replies sarcastically. “Anyway, the case. What do we know about Incubi?”
Dean lets it slide for now, there is no point in pressing the topic and making Steve even more defensive. Not if they still want more information from their neighbors. “Okay,” Dean says flatly.
When the tree is finished, Ellen sets off towards the kitchen to prepare the final touches of today’s dinner. Eileen and Sam stubbornly don’t let her shoo them away, even though she insists that not much work is left to be done. Claire decides that she’ll show Kaia their room, which Dean comments on with a “be safe” that has both of them blush and roll their eyes at him and gets him a side-eye from Cas.
The darkness behind his hands is too much suddenly, so he lets go, opens his eyes again. But he doesn’t have the courage to look at Cas. Doesn’t want to see whatever is on his face. So he stares at the wooden planks of the porch instead. They look solid. More solid than anything else in his life.
“I never said that!”
"He's queer?" Claire asks surprised.
“Uhh, I’m Gabriel. We have an appointment?”
Cas nods and retreats to his bedroom while Dean gets serious about the burgers. But he has everything well-prepped, his timing on burgers an automatic reflex by now.
“Cas,” Dean’s face has gone worried. “That’s not true. You know it’s not true. You know He resur-” Dean breaks off. “Umm, what I mean is, I’m pretty sure God has a protecting hand over you. Or something.”
he managed to get past all of Dean’s usual defenses with no more than a few words and touches.
Claire is standing next to Cas now, reaching up to hand Kaia one straw star at a time that Kaia diligently puts wherever the majority vote decides that it should go. She's beaming up at her, Kaia smiling back shyly, and Dean is pretty sure that if they weren't surrounded by family, they'd be sneaking kisses.
“Oh, look at you! All tall and handsome and ready to defend the country. Or the house. Better not defend Nat, she doesn’t take kindly to it. Oh God, I’m rambling. I’m sorry. But I’ve heard so much about you!” She practically bounces up and down on the spot.
“Which unit?” Steve asks, undeterred for now because for one, he’s genuinely curious, and for two, their neighbors haven’t shown any signs of recognizing them. And Steve would like to keep it that way.
He can see the heat tinge Dean’s cheeks to a darker red than the cold manages, even while Dean ducks his head, like he’s shy. “I’m glad.”
They turn towards Cas at the same time.
“Cas?” Dean croaks.
“Don’t, please,” Cas can hear the pain in his voice before the words break completely.
Dean looks at his hands, too, but there’s nothing there. He was just going to get coffee after all. “What is it?” he asks, puzzled, and takes a few steps closer to the table.
How his lips feel.
“One, two, hop.”
Cas shakes his head. “I should have expected it. They’re a close-knit community. Once you’re out, you’re out.”
“I’m glad about that. And no, I have nothing ‘disparaging’ to say.” He actually does the stupid air quotes again, like he thinks that’s really a thing people do.
Dean turns the deathband over in his hands. He still can’t fathom grieving for Amara. But since both Charlie and Cas have insisted that it’s going to happen he guesses it’s going to happen. “Okay,” he nods. “Angelina it is. It’s not like I ever want to say
That puzzles Steve. Everything that Nat has found out about the Winchesters has indicated that they are close. “Do you fear that he wouldn’t approve?”
Cas sits up fully but he doesn’t flee. His face is crinkled in a worried frown and he looks down at his hands instead of looking up at Dean. “Even if I’ll never be able to give you more than this?” he whispers.
“Ah, nothing really. But I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a gal.”
“Years don’t always make things easier. I’m glad that you are doing better now,” Hannah says.
Only, that’s not what happens. “This? This is what you’re basing your argument on?” She points at her wristband and laughs a half-hysterical laugh. Then she furiously unties the strings of the band and rips it off. “This, this
Cas’ glare is menacing at best and Dean takes an involuntary step back.
All eyes turn to him. He’s pretty sure he blushes beet-red, too.
With Cas, though, Dean doesn’t think he believes this is unmanly. Well, it’s not a category Cas thinks in anyway, what with him being a celestial wavelength and all. That thought gets stuck, somehow, as if it’s new, even though it’s as old as their friendship. But there’s flour in Cas’ hair where he’s run his hand through it and there’s bees on his apron and it’s hard to see him as anything but the dorky guy Dean is in love with. Huh.
“To save the world?”
Cas gives him a shaky smile. “Thank you.”
“What did you do anyway? You never said.”
Cas hums something that might be non-committal or it might be approval, but he doesn’t refute the ‘first date’ claim and he doesn’t object to the shortening of his name. Instead he just leads Dean towards the house.
He doesn’t protest, just tells her “thank you” and goes back to his stitching, pondering her answer silently.
“So,” Gabriel pipes up. “Decision time. Should I make contact or not?”
Cas averts his eyes. “Some Alphas like it,” he whispers. “To have their Omega cry at their hand and still have them come back begging for more because their need is so strong and that Alpha is the only option they have.”
“I just - I don’t know what to do.” There’s the sudden emptiness that’s always there when the anger leaves.
Sam. It’s not your responsibility to keep me safe. I can keep myself safe. And I will stand by you. Whether you think it’s the best course of action or not.”
“It scares you.“
“Understood,” Dean nods because discussions with stern Cas are useless anyway. He even manages a shaky smile.
“As I said, very strange. The woman who picked up the phone seemed very confused as to where I got the number,” Sam explains.
He’s not doing this for Dean. He’s doing this for himself. He needs to deal with this. He owes it to himself.
“So, I’m guessing it’s got something to do with Cas?” Charlie plonks herself down on the couch.
“And why is that so?” Dean asks, impatience giving way to annoyance.
“Hey, technically you’re older.”
Dean’s never sure whether that’s a good thing. It’s felt a few times like he was setting himself up for destruction. Cas’ power is diminished now, he couldn’t kill him with a snap of his fingers like when his angel batteries were fully charged. He’s been ready for Cas to kill him twice already. One time, a very long time ago, in a dirty alleyway during the apocalypse. The second time in a crypt looking for the angel tablet. He could have fought back. Both times. Maybe not very successfully, but he could have. He’s fought against what feels like every goddamn other angel in the garrison.
“You’re going to drive yourself home?” Cas asks incredulously.
“I was?” he frowns.
“I think I should call an ambulance,” the man nods to himself.
“Yeah, right,” Dean grouses, because that’s so not what happened. But hey, “Send me the picture, will you?” He asks instead.
‘He is courting you,’ Missouri had said and nodded approvingly. ‘As he should. And since you plan to accept him, you have to allow him to care for you.’
“I can take the backseat if Claire wants to…”
She smiles, though he can see that she’s not happy about the change of topic. “One to string and one to eat?”
“Already?” Cas asks.
Dean can feel his shoulders hunching, can feel how he is protecting himself while he watches them warily. And that - that won’t do. He can’t show them his fear. It’s bad enough what he already has shown them. So he takes a few deliberate breaths and unclenches his hands. Wills his shoulders to come down from up over his ears and his back to straighten.
Because if there’s one thing that’s reliable about Clint, it’s that he steadfastly answers any email with a picture of his dog.
The three little dots start up just to cease again. When the pause gets too long, Dean sighs and types.
Steve has a sudden flashback to the times before the war, when he’s seen Bucky with a dame, either in their apartment or because Steve didn’t want to stay home alone and found himself at the same bar Bucky went to. Now Natasha would kick his ass for calling her a
Steve looks helplessly at Bucky who looks back at him with the same expression. Then they both shrug.
“Then I’ll be the one to take care of you,” Cas says simply and lets go of his hands to let his touch wander up Dean’s arm. There are more bruises there, places where Dean got grabbed, most likely, and Cas stretches up so that he can kiss each one of them.
And oh.
“Gee, thanks Charles. Way to be a supportive best friend,” Dean grumbles.
Instead of an answer, Bucky lays a hand on Steve’s leg, just above the knee.
“But I have this,” Cas points at his tattoo. “I don’t need a cover.”
And umm, how often exactly is Cas stalking his dreams? Because yeah, this was just one dream out of many with a similar content, but… Dean tries very hard to keep from blushing. Cas is drunk and this probably doesn’t mean anything. Cas has too big a heart for his own good. He probably checks in to make sure Dean didn’t get himself killed. Which in itself is a kindness that Dean doesn’t deserve and that he shouldn’t read into. And he definitely shouldn’t make Cas uncomfortable by blurting accidental truths like ‘I miss you, man. I miss you more than you’ll ever know.’
“Only if you want to tell me,” Steve says, because from the way Bucky doesn’t look up to meet his eyes, it’s something scary.
The name means nothing to Cas, though by his sharp intake of breath Sam knows what Dean is talking about.
“Claire!” Dean jumps and drowns the last of his whiskey too fast. He shakes himself when it burns down his throat. “How’s Baby doing?”
This is unbetaed, please excuse any mistakes. But I kind of felt that you all have waited long enough for this update. :D
“And you’d,” Dean swallows heavily, “you’d prefer that over the other option?”
“What’s up?” He says trying not to sound too upset about the timing.
The epiphany leaves him dizzy. And not in a good way. Then it makes him angry. How had he not seen this before?
“Like you do?” Cas replies.
Sam laughs. “I’m sure we could rouse a dozen people or more. If we threw all of the twenty-five bucks we have to our name at it.”
"There's more," Claire grins. "But I believe it's your turn."
She keeps chatting about the pros and cons of the different characters while they install the console. Dean’s got to admit, he is still a bit thrown. He has no idea what he expected but it was more along the lines of an awkward heart to heart over a cup of coffee and less racing down Rainbow Road.
“Sure thing.”
That makes him look back at Bucky after all. “I am?”
He thinks of Cas’ bedhead while he slices apples for the pie. Of the way Cas’ hair sticks up in all directions, whether he’s fresh out of the shower or coming in from work. While making the crust, he thinks of how the crease in his forehead seems to be a permanent feature sometimes, but then they’ll watch a funny movie and Dean will laugh himself silly only to notice that Cas is looking at him with a soft smile, all the tension having bled out of him, if only for a short unguarded moment. Maybe it’s those moments, Dean thinks. Maybe those moments make up for all the other shit Dean brings with him. He’s got to hope anyway, because he hasn’t got all that much else to offer.
“Deep in thought, huh? I’m Steve, your brother’s neighbor. We’ve met?”
Nothing much else about the man is immediately familiar but that smile.
“Yup,” Gabe nods. “A waste of my potential, if you ask me.”
“It’s getting dark, you’re going to ruin your eyes.”
Dean snorts. That’s Cas’ play? The ‘
He throws on a shirt and some sweatpants, pockets the phone and leaves his room. Maybe he can make breakfast for Cas as a small thank you for putting up with him. But to his surprise, he finds Cas already clattering around the kitchen.
“Yes, Castiel, you were,” she interrupts him. “You were so before - before Naomi sent you away, and you were still strong when you got back.”
Steve thinks he knows where Bucky’s thoughts are going. It’s written in every line of his face that he wishes that things could have turned out alright for them, too. That they wouldn’t hurt quite so much. Steve’s not all that good at keeping the pain out of his voice when the memories choke him after all.
Dean shakes his head, “Nothing is wrong, per se. I’ve just, ah,” he takes a deep breath. “I’ve changed my mind.”
“And?” Charlie encourages.
“I love him, Gran, he can’t - he needs to -,” but the words desert him like the traitors they are. “I should stay away. I should stay far away,” is all that finally makes it out.
Then he notices that Cas is now in the room with him. And doesn’t seem to have any intention to leave. And Dean’s still not undressed.
“Ooookay, that’s a new level of creepy even for her. And isn’t Becky dating that Chuck guy now?” Because Superfan99 most definitely has a tumblr. That she uses to share every inappropriate detail of her life.
“It was,” Dean insists. “If only because I stopped you from explaining the whole thing to her. Because I know you wanted to.”
When they break apart this time, he finds a bit of distance, though. Not much, just enough that he can look at Cas when he asks, “So, does that mean - do you, uhh, think we could see whether our baggage might fit together? If we go slow?”
He takes a deep breath to steel himself and marches off to find the table that has a moose. Still, his steps falter when he spies his brother’s mop of brown hair. He’s lied to him so often. But he’d never thought he’d have to lie about something this big again.
“Yes,” Dean echoes dumbly. “An apology. Of course.”
Charlie fidgets at the question, looking nervously at Cas before her eyes settle back on Dean. “The official guideline tells me that I should counsel you to stay in the relationship and communicate better to make the violence decrease.” She holds her hand up when Cas opens his mouth. “I know. Believe me, Cas, I know. The problem is, there aren’t that many other options. People who have the money and connections sometimes manage to disappear. To a new continent, if they want to be safe. Others, well, others…”
“How does it - it doesn’t even matter, okay?” Dean can feel himself blush as his face heats up under Cas’ stare. “It’s not - you’re all of these things we talked about yesterday, ace and aro and - I’m still not even really clear on what that means but I, I have a psychopath to go live with, so…” He shrugs his shoulders helplessly.
He’s not even surprised when Missouri suddenly stands on the porch, leaning against the door frame and sending him a deep smile. She doesn’t seem surprised to see him here, either.
“Okay.”
The first time his phone buzzes Dean chooses to ignore it, because hell, it’s in the middle of the night and he wants to sleep. So screw whoever sends him a message right now. It’s way too early for anything.
He goes back to staring at the ceiling, because if he’s going to try to make sense of this, then it’s easier when he’s not looking at her.
“So you’re just gonna up and leave?” Dean asks.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas smiles at the thought even though he doesn’t look forward to that time of year. He smiles because Dean knows that the furs are the ones that Cas found in his chest up in Angels’ Nest, but he doesn’t know that the vest that they will be made into will be a gift for him. It might be a small way in which Cas can help to keep Dean safe, but it is still something he can do for Dean and he looks forward to it.
“It can’t be you, huh?” Dean says. Not that he really wants to be Cas’ client. But the thought of spilling his guts to a stranger is not comforting, either.
Finally, when he’s already in bed, he turns his phone back on. There are no new messages. He swallows and gathers his courage. Then he types,
Again, a word of warning. Please remember that omegas get sold the moment they present, so a few of the omegas at the club are underage. Nothing graphic is shown, but they are club pets like the rest. Also, I want to remind you of the “mentions of unwanted body modifications” tag. Unfortunately, in this world it’s very much a common thing to happen to male omegas, even more in settings like the club, so there are omegas here that have been altered (nothing very detailed is being described).
“Nah, it’s fine,” Dean shakes his head.
“Dean, they’re not…” And then the doorbell rings.
many times.”
She nods.
“Dean?” Charlie asks him.
“Uh-oh.”
“Please,” he repeats his request.
There’s something that changed at least. There are more photos than he remembers. Not as many more as he expected, but a few.
“What color do you want?” Dean asks while nodding towards the sheets.
“Bobby ain’t got nothing to do with this, love. I’ve got my own pair of eyes, thank you very much.” Ellen shakes her head at him and goes back to stitching.
“Dean,” Cas says softly, and damn Cas and his stupid way of saying Dean’s name like just saying it will make him reveal the secrets of the world.
Cas gets up, stalks over to Dean. “It’s all just empty words. Show me that I matter.”
For a long moment, Cas does just that. It’s like he’s tasting a new ice cream variety or a new food altogether. Like he’s tasting the texture and the makeup of it, like he assesses how the mix of ingredients makes him feel.
“That he hadn’t?” Cas prompts him quietly.
“You remember?” he asks, voice a whisper.
Cas still looks weirded out by Dean’s outburst, his face a few shades paler than Dean’s ever seen it since the first time Cas had come in. He’d been nervous and fidgety that day. It’s almost the same look of fear on his face now. It definitely speaks against any of Dean’s assumptions but that does nothing to clear up the situation.
Dean’s getting the feeling that Chuck is a sarcastic little shit but he doesn’t see much chance to get out of this, so he might as well get over with it. He grunts with the movement when he draws his shirt over his head even though the pain killers have kicked in already.
“By getting them to talk, obviously.”
“What?” Cas says puzzled.
There is an even conviction in his voice that leaves no doubts that he means that. It’s a stark contrast to softly he takes Dean’s hand. He turns it over and lets his thumb glide over the bruise on Dean’s wrist. He does it with the same care and the same reverence that he’d shown with his sister. Then he looks up again.
“Anything I can help you with?” Steve asks.
“You do?” Cas sounds skeptical.
“I’m aware. I became a lawyer to at least help where I could after all.”
“Yes, Dean, I’m sure,” Cas says gravely.
He stares at his phone for a long minute. There’s this empty feeling inside him that battles with the heaviness of everything else. He remembers that, too, feeling like he’s completely hollow while at the same time feeling like he’s draped in a blanket made of iron, too heavy for him to lift and leaving him no choice but to wait for the unavoidable. Somehow, he’d never expected to feel like this again.
“Oh,” Steve tracks back. “Well, in that case, no need to worry. Bucky is one of the good guys.”
“I wasn’t going to,” Cas sighs. Then he shakes his head like he knows he’s doing something stupid and fumbles in his pocket. His hand comes back out with his keys. He holds them up for Dean to see.
“Dean?” Cas asks, voice nervous, when the silence goes on too long.
“You going to tell me?” Dean asks.
Cas squints. “Why not? Sam’s always wanted a dog. I think it will be good for him.”
“The counterattack,” Nat says and sends him a look like he’s really really stupid, “it comes from - somewhere around Lebanon, Kansas. Whoa, what the hell is happening now?”
Dean watches him intently for a moment. Cas is affected by their neighbors’ display as well, he’d bet on it. Question is, did he imagine himself as Steve or Bucky? Dean’s so got to find a way to ask him.
Cas blushes but he also smiles shyly. “I may or may not have bought the whole Star Wars series while we were apart.”
a certain someone is around. So the deduction really isn’t that hard.“
There are no endearments now and her voice is stern. Cas flinches but the house smells like it did back then and Missouri smells the same as well, sounds the same, feels the same. And once upon a time she was the only person he trusted, the only good thing in his life. So he looks up.
And yeah, Cas has the luxury to do that. Cas can wait Dean’s temper tantrum out, because Cas probably has a dozen clients a week throwing tantrums and he waits all of them out, because he’s always the voice of reason.
They work in silence for a moment, every move long practiced, even if it has been a while since they last lived together or since Sam helped at the bar regularly.
won’t let her to do this to you! I won’t let you do this! I won’t let you! I won’t! I won’t lose you! I won’t let it happen! Not this time! I refuse!” He’s crying again, though this time he angrily wipes at his tears and he doesn’t stop glaring at Dean, either.
,” Cas wrinkles his nose in disgust. Then he holds up a different document. “I was married in Illinois?”
” Dean grimaced. “And it’s not even just Dad, it’s…” He shrugs because he’s run out of words.
It makes Cas come up short, though. "That's not a category I've ever applied to it."
Charlie snickers again but she tosses the reins, which she was still holding, over the mare’s neck and hands them to Cas. “For now, leave these hanging loose unless you want her to stop. Dean will teach you how to guide her, but as long as Kaz is next to her she’ll do whatever he does. Especially since,” she holds up a rope that is fastened to Bella’s bridle, “Dean’s going to lead for now.”
“We might not be able to have any direct contact but you’ve set all of this up.” Dean makes a sweeping gesture to include all the files on the table. “You really think I believe for a second that you’re not going to track our every movement?”
And Dean can’t really deny that but he doesn’t want to talk about it, either. “Shouldn’t have talked about you like you weren’t in the room earlier. Sorry ‘bout that.”
“Thanks, Charles,” Dean nods while Cas says, “It’s appreciated.”
“Yes,” Natasha nods. “And I can’t guarantee that the mooks won’t figure it out as well.”
They work side-by-side to make breakfast, Dean frying bacon and scrambling eggs while Cas makes pancakes with blueberries. In fact, they’re using up pretty much everything that Cas has as breakfast food in his fridge.
This time, Dean’s chuckle is almost real. He kind of hopes Jo will do exactly that. She’s a good mechanic, never afraid of getting her hands dirty. And she has a mind for business that she’s inherited from her mother. The garage will flourish under her hands. He knows it and Bobby knows it, too. “Yeah, well, old man, we’re both going to have to get used to being under the reign of a blonde.”
Cas shrugs.
“Hello there, neighbors,” Bucky calls out from where he’d stayed a half step behind Steve.
Charlie would frown at him for it. She wouldn’t call him outright stupid, not the same way some of his other friends would. She knows after all. Has cornered him after that night when Cas said goodbye and dragged the whole story out of him. Including an explanation of their dynamics.
Dean smiles against Cas’ skin then, pulling him into another kiss, just because he wants to and because he can.
It should do none of these things, and yet it does all of them.
“I should have worn better clothes,” Cas frowns down at himself once the beer issue is settled. “I chose them because you said loose waistline but I feel underdressed now. Should I go change?”
Dean whispers, “Yes. Yes, that’s how it was.” He draws his cloak around himself faster, as if protecting himself not only from the snow in the air but from the past itself.
“I never mentioned her more than in passing.”
“That was different. I knew you were still in there,” Dean argues.
“Can be,” Charlie shrugs as she walks back in. “Romantic attraction, sexual attraction, they are two different things. You can be attracted to people sexually but never want to cuddle with them in the morning. Or you can want to cuddle with them all night and never want to have sex. To say it in simplified terms. But you two,” she stabs a finger at the both of them, “You don’t see the way you look at each other, but it’s disgustingly obvious that whatever you were before, you’re romantically attracted now. Doesn’t mean you have to act on it, mind you. But if you ask me, think about trying that kissing thing. It’ll help clearing things up.”
“I’ve never doubted it,” Cas answers. “I just wish I could help.”
Judging by Bucky’s chuckle, the effect of his little show was not lost on him. “You should probably check on those burgers,” he says and casually gestures with his beer towards the burgers.
“There was a murder here, once.”
Dean rolls his eyes.
Dean tries very hard to ignore how his heart is beating fast.
Jo is worried, her gait stiff and her face tight. She gives him a smile when she notices his gaze, but her eyes stare right through him, as if her thoughts are already miles ahead of them. Benny is less outwardly worried, his stout frame solid and unshaken as always. But he keeps sending glances in Dean’s direction, so at the very least, he is worried about him. Charlie is doing needlework by the fire but her needle works slowly, much slower than when she is concentrated. Instead, she looks around, assessing the pack’s reaction much the same way he is, Cas thinks.
While the game reloads, Dean watches Charlie from the side. Jumping into cold water. Dean guesses that that’s the best way to go about this, too. He hits the gas for the next round and says, “Did he tell you? Cas, I mean. Did he tell you that I want an Unsealing?”
It’s an enormous effort and Castiel is carrying most of Dean’s weight, but somehow it works.
“That’s the plan, yeah.”
“Okay?”
“Come on, Cas, prove me wrong about that stick up your ass.”
Dean takes a fortifying breath. He’s never been good at lying to Cas. He’s omitted the truth plenty of times, oh yes, but outright lies? Cas tends to catch them. Still, Dean can’t put this on Cas. This is his problem. And if the only thing Dean was sure about up until about half an hour ago was that he and Cas could never be more than friends, and if even that surety is gone now and, if that knowledge leaves Dean floundering without a single anchor in this world, then that’s his problem and not Cas’. “Yeah, Cas, I’m sure. Tell Gabe to give me a time and place and I’ll be there.”
“You can’t always run away,” Cas voice is soft and sad, and it breaks Dean’s heart. He wants to turn around and hug Cas, bury himself in the other man’s arms, tell him everything and forget that he doesn’t deserve this.
“Turn it off,” Cas repeats. “I mean, answer Sam if you want to. But then turn it off. All your pictures are downloaded and safe. Charlie and Gabriel know to contact me. There is no reason to keep it on.”
"Because he might be your dad but I'm your guardian. Protecting you will always be my priority."
“DeeEan??? Why are you calling me?” Cas blares into the phone.
And last but not least, he’s certain of one more thing: This was goodbye from Sam, yes. But it was goodbye for today, not forever. It’ll take a while, years probably, before it’s safe to contact Sam again. To meet Sam’s kid that was supposed to be his Godchild. But he will. Eventually he will.
Cas @Dean: I haven’t made it to the cemetery yet. I can’t seem to get past the gates. I think I could do it if you were here.
Cas’ eyes fly up to his, trying to figure him out, but he doesn’t stop his ministrations. Instead, he takes one of Dean’s hands in his and kisses the bruised knuckles, one at a time. He smiles after each little kiss, a private little smile as if he’s fond of Dean’s knuckles and the fact that he can kiss them better. “Be careful with what?” he asks almost as an afterthought.
“Yeah,” Dean croaks out.
“Why does this feel like we’ve never done this before?” he grumbles while he climbs under the covers.
Charlie finally lets go of her. “Easy. I don’t even have to betray anyone’s confidences. Just read the books.”
Tears prickle at the corner of Dean’s eyes, but instead of letting them fall, he pours everything he feels  into the kiss, lets it go soft and slow and intimate. Lets it catch both Cas and him where they had been falling on their own.
“Life-threatening consequences,” Sam reminds him.
“The rules of conduct are there for a reason,” Natasha says carefully.
“But ready for what, Dean? Why are you doing this?” Cas asks and it is as honest a question as he’s ever asked. Dean’s already got him, what is he
Normally, it is appreciated. Right now, Dean can’t cope. He shakes Cas’ hand loose from his shoulder, heaving again.
“Dude! Dude!”
But there’s no stopping Sam when he’s on a roll. “Are you sure it’s not a Siren, though? I mean the last Siren that went after you was male, too.”
“Bull. Also, if you’re going down that road, you gotta blame me as well. I was with him almost every fucking day. He came by for a goodbye fuck, for God’s sake. You’d think I would have noticed, wouldn’t you? That that was what he was doing. Should have noticed earlier than in hindsight that he hadn’t -,” Balthazar breaks off.
Dean freezes like a deer in the headlights, Cas running into him, unable to stop his motion in time. For a moment, it’s as if the whole world goes quiet. Dean is dimly aware of the chatter in the cafe, but all that consciously registers is that Amara’s eyes are already fixed on him.
“Dean?” Cas looks worried now. More worried than he had a minute ago.
“That. How?” Dean stutters.
Dean huffs a little laugh. “That’s all you got to say to it?”
“Cas, stop! You’re drunk. And you clearly don’t remember things right when you’re drunk cause I’m the one who’s gotta apologize for the rest of his life. Okay? God, I wish I could just tell you to go sleep it off.” Dean rubs the bridge of his nose. He feels so old and useless. He tries so hard and it’s never enough. Everyone dies, or almost dies, or leaves him. Bobby and Ellen and Jo and Charlie. He’s got Sam and Cas almost killed more than once. And right now he doesn’t even know whether he wants to hug Cas close and beg his forgiveness or whether he wants him as far away from him as possible so that there is no chance he hurts him even more.
It takes a moment before understanding blooms in Sam’s eyes. “You’re not leading us South.”
“I wouldn’t go home with you if I actually thought you were an axe-murderer, you know?” Dean answers while he types a quick text to Jo. Good thing that she never changes her cell number and he knows it by heart.
. And no worries, it won’t be like Romeo and Juliet. I happen to know what I’m doing.”
“It’s nothing,” Dean bites. “Just a bruise. She didn’t like it when Gabe started flirting. Maybe tell him not to do that again.”
“You could say congrats?” Sam proposes. “Or you know, see this as a tiny ray of light in the middle of this whole clusterfuck of a situation? You know, be happy for me and all that?”
“I don’t,” Cas confesses. “I don’t believe anymore. Not like I did.”
“It’s the way she - she tried hard to make it sound casual when talking about her soulmate, who had a hard time leaving his old life behind, but I’m a lawyer. I know when someone is fishing for information. And she was.”
It makes Dean’s insides tingle in a way that he’s tried not to acknowledge whenever it happened over the two months of their acquaintance. Because Castiel was a patron. A hella attractive one who immediately struck all of Dean’s visual preferences. And one who was lonely, probably, seeing how he spent his weekend nights at the bar. Which, there was a time in his life when he would have seen that and used it. Claire isn’t wrong on that count, a lot of straight guys can be persuaded into experimenting, as long as everyone keeps their mouths shut after. And one time deals were just about as much as Dean could stand having going for the longest time. Scratch the  itch but keep the danger to calculated levels. And have his anger at the ready in case he miscalculated.
“An apology?” Dean croaks out.
Why is all of this so complicated? Why can’t it be easy? Why can’t Cas be helpful and not make trouble? Why can’t he be like everyone else? That brings the unwanted tears back to his eyes, so he rolls himself into their blankets faster.
Steve surges forward then, because seeing Bucky happy makes him happy and there’s butterflies in his stomach and he just has to. Bucky lets out a surprised
“Please, Dean. Please don’t make me lose you, too.”
So excuse him if he sees it as a good sign that Cas is A, still available and B, doesn’t ignore him completely anymore. That if nothing else, at least when they’re roughhousing Cas is not going out of his way to make sure he’s not interacting with Dean.
“I can’t well leave him alone in the bunker.” Dean can virtually see the eye-roll attached to that. “But don’t worry, he’s housebroken already.”
“Yep.”
“You’ve been with me every step of the way. It wasn’t cool of me to shut you out. I’m sorry.”  He gives Cas a guilty half-smile.
“I’m allergic to cats.” It’s random information but if Cas has a dozen kittens in his apartment, then maybe it’s better to disclose this now.
Just then, the doorbell rings.
Immediately, Dean sobers up. “Cas, man, you haven’t found your soulmate yet. You don’t know how it is. It’s fucked up to be a puppet in your own body. Especially, when someone who wants to own you like a toy pulls your strings. And you’re completely helpless against it.”
“You better be. You’re gonna give Ellen a heart-attack if something happens to you,” Bobby grumbles. Dean’s kind of grateful that he leaves out the
Posting a day early this week because I have an exhausting week ahead of me. <3
“I can still go with you, Dean,” Cas whispers urgently. “You don’t have to do this alone.”
Balthazar nods. “I still see Inias every so often. And Alfie works in a shop downtown.”
Cas looks up. “Morning. Did you sleep well?”
“An astute observation,” Cas agrees though Dean isn’t sure he’s as unaffected as he makes out to be.
This time the three dots stay. Dean chuckles. He’s a little starstruck still but he’s also kind of enjoying this.
“From Dad, yes. From assholes at school. From myself when I had to. Cause he’s - he’s important to me. You’re important to me, too, Cas.”
"The button-down, too, Cas," Dean reprimands when it looks like Cas wants to pull the sweater over it. "I can see that you're wearing a t-shirt underneath."
He closes his eyes. “About the Unsealing.” There he’s said it.
“Yeah, that would be us,” the other redhead pipes up from where she’s patiently been waiting at the door with Steve and Bucky. “Hi. You can still call me Natasha, no need to call me agent,” she smirks.
“What?”
“Natasha. I didn’t know you had keys to our house,” Steve grumbles.
“See you.”
“I’ve seen the glances he keeps sneaking you.”
She still got a smile in her voice, when she says,, “Okay, so I’d have thought you’d be more freaked. A month of radio silence and then what - a letter detailing his endless love to you?”
He obediently starts stirring. The stew is more of a molasses right now, the fresh snow water staying on top while the mass is slow in warming up. He does his best to mix the new and the old while Missouri goes through their stores to find whatever she wants to add today.
Because he knows that it is his fault and he really doesn’t know what Cas wants from him. So he gets angry and frustrated, “Goddammit, Cas, I’m offering to help here. What else do you want me to say?”
“No, man, I’m not chasing away customers, that’s just bad for business,” Dean grins and comes to a decision. He pours a light beer for himself before walking around the bar and hopping up on the stool next to Castiel. “In fact, I’m gonna enjoy that my favorite customer is here and that I have a little more time to talk to him than normal. If you want, that is. And only until the rush starts.”
“You won’t be alone,” Cas says quietly but determinedly. “I’ll be with you all the way.”
“I’ll stay here until you can accept me as real,” Cas insists stubbornly.
“An actual couple?” Cas repeats in a whisper, like he can’t believe the words.
“I didn’t mean it badly, Cas. Believe me, I didn’t. Everyone in this pack will tell you that I need arguing with. And you’ve got as much right to do that as anyone else. Okay?”
“If you haven't, I will have it for you until you find it again. You used to be so faithful, I don't think it vanished completely,” Hannah says.
“Did you order already?” Dean asks back stoically.
“Who are they from?” Dean asks, trepidation audible in his voice.
“Yeah, he updated me on the case. And apparently he has a dog now.”
“What?” Cas asks taken aback.
“How’s it like then?” Charlie asks and at least she sounds open-minded.
“Sorry,” Dean apologizes. “She yours?”
Missouri was right, he can‘t do this alone. He knows it, has probably known from the start but still wasn‘t ready to admit it. Who doesn’t manage to visit their brother’s grave? It’s ridiculous.
It’s a risk and he knows it. But it’s literally the only thing he can think of doing that might actually land him a conversation with angelheart. So he hits
“You led me into it.” Maybe it’s stating the obvious, but it baffles Dean to no end. Why Cas would do something like that for him.
But that’s not the way things turned out. Kissing Cas now would only make everything worse, no matter how much Dean wants to have that one memory to hold onto in a bleak future.
He all but flees out of Cas’ immediate space and reaches for the ingredients. He’s frantic enough that it’s only Cas’ quick reaction that keeps the flour bag from toppling over and spilling everywhere.
He waits until he hears the Impala’s engine revv before returning to work. “I’m sorry, Baby,” he apologizes vaguely in the Impala’s direction but he’s also still smiling. Tomorrow is Christmas, he’s gonna see his whole family and his not-quite-daughter is adorably in love. The world is good.
Dean glowers, gaze on the ground in front of them. He is leading his stallion by the reins, walking in front of the animal to make sure the ground is safe, no treacherous ice hidden under the fresh sheet of snow.
Dean closes his eyes for a deep breath before turning to his brother. “I can make pictures for you if you want to document it.”
“What is it?”
“Easy there,” comes the gravelly voice again. “You’ve been hurt.”
Cas. And it’s not even because he owes him, though he undoubtedly does. It’s because - if Cas is not okay, it’s Dean’s fault. And there’s a lot of shit in a lot of people’s lives that’s Dean’s fault, and there’s only very little he can do about most of it. So if there’s something he can actually do, well, then he should.
That makes Dean laugh, too. “Hey, you’re the hot shot lawyer, you’re supposed to get us through now. I’m not going back to five-finger-discounts.”
“Cas?”
“I’m sorry if you think it’s unprofessional calling him by name. But he’s not a HYDRA agent, he’s our neighbor and we’re invited to dinner at their place, so it hardly seems appropriate to call him
“Sam? Can you take over here?” Dean asks him when he's done with the vegetables. He hands him the spatula. “You,” he points at Cas. “With me.”
Sam rolls his eyes but he doesn’t comment, only asks, “Do you want me to bring personal word from you with me?”
He figures that should be enough to get Cas to respond without it being too obvious how worried Dean is and thus worrying Cas in return. Still, he can’t quite let it stand like this.
“I want to sign my code,” Natasha says evenly.
And yet, he wants Dean to take that risk. Has asked him in fact, and has stashed a red ribbon for a handfasting in his wooden chest. He lowers his eyes. It’s such a wonderful dream. Such a fairytale. But like with all fairytales, the nightmare waits close by. Sometimes, Cas isn’t sure whether the dream is worth risking the nightmare. Not for himself, obviously, he would take the risk any day. But Dean’s got a responsibility to his pack. Losing himself in grief would make them suffer.
“As well as could be expected,” Dean answers. “They won’t counter it anyway. They have no better ideas.”
“Yeah,” Dean nods. “I’m gonna do my best there, too.”
“Nah. Bruised ribs most likely. Possibly a mild concussion. But I don’t feel nauseous and I don’t see double.”
And he’s got no choice here, so he might as well go with it. Especially since the doorbell is already ringing again.
“No,” Dean shakes his head, eyes already drawn back to Amara. “No, I do.”
Cas’ face has hardened during Dean’s speech and he pulls his hands into fists at his sides. So of course, Dean pushes further into his personal space, uses the few inches he has on Cas to tower over him.
“Dean told me about it,” Cas nods. “But I didn’t have novelty clothing and not enough time to go shopping for it this morning. I brought these, though.”
Natasha cracks a small smile. “You’re not as slow on the uptake as could be expected from a 90-year-old.”
“Then I already have done that,” Cas replies harshly. He crosses his arms for good measure.
‘Not now. Wrong timing. Calm down, tiger,’ he admonishes himself. Out loud he says, “Yep. That’s how it’s like today.”
Dean nods silently. “Yeah, I figure.”
Charlie looks from one of them to the other. “Yes, I’ve heard of them before. I’ve heard of them going wrong, too. Sometimes with life-threatening consequences”
The truth of the words weighs heavy on him and he wishes he could wish them away.
be there.”
“But you have hope.”
Instantly, she becomes serious again. “It is my private truth only. It will not help him.” She nods in Dean’s direction, who is going over tomorrow’s route with Benny and Jo.
Holy shit.
“Well,” Charlie says, “no. We’ve made up someone a little more wholesome for your background story. Meet Angelina.” She searches for a file among Dean’s documents and hands it to him. “She got killed after you met but before your soulmate bond was fulfilled. Real tragic.”
“Uh, okay,” Dean says. “Didn’t check my notifs yet, sorry. It was a long night. Is Sam with you?” Because Dean can’t even remember whether Jess ever called him before. It’s always his brother.
anymore?” Cas actually fumbles with the sentence before it finally comes out, like he’s terrified to even say the words.
The woman dismisses them with a wave and rakes her eyes up and down Dean’s body before taking in the rest of their group. “OOoh! And what do we have here?”
He’s got to be more careful is all. It’s not like he’s ever outright told Cas about his feelings anyway. He just has to bury them even deeper now. Be steadfast in his support of Cas but stop all these small transgressions that he had gotten used to over the years. No more touching Cas uninvited. No more commenting on Cas’ bed-head. No more ogling his booty. Though admittedly, Dean wasn’t supposed to do that in the first place. The sour taste changes into a red hot flash of embarrassment and guilt. Because with the other shit, Dean can always say he hadn’t known any better. But this? He’d always known better. He just had never been able to stop himself.
“I just - I want to keep you safe,” Dean mumbles, voice not holding up. “This is the best way.”
“I’m sorry,” he repeats and brings the mare to a stop to let himself glide off her back.
There is a long pause on the other end of the line. “Dean, please don’t do anything stupid, okay?”
Amara regards him like he is a maggot, so far beneath her that she has to think about whether she wants to spend the energy to crush it. “This is between me and my soulmate. Get out of my way before I forcibly remove you.”
like she’d rather call him Mr. Winchester. But
“Sleep, Dean. I’ll wake you in two hours.”
“We’ve found a way to deal with the cold before, we can do it again,” Benny grumbles.
“Sorry, Dean, I have nothing new on the missing persons, but I’ve got something else. I checked up that phone number you gave me. That was kind of strange.”
“What?”
“How are you so calm about this?” Sam asks. “I mean, you go play
“Castiel Novak,” Cas says gravely.
, he thinks fondly.
“What?”
“How’s that any better? Still going to cost me a fortune.”
“Thanks for the warning,” Cas snorts. Then he lets out a long deliberate breath. “I’m glad I came out here, Dean, and that we talked. It was the right thing to do.”
“Dean, I’m - I’m still confused. You have tried, haven’t you? In the beginning, when you met her? You’ve tried whether you can work this out?”
He takes a moment to compose himself before he turns to her and goes to sit down on the couch. “You’re not - there’s not enough new photos.” His tongue feels tied into knots and it’s an enormous effort to even get out this one sentence.
“You didn’t even - I dunno, look back once? Miss me a little?”
But Cas’ face hardens to an angry mask. “Is that what you think? That following you is throwing my life away?”
“Don’t think there’s anyone better than you, Gran,” Cas whispers.
“Well, I guess you can figure out first hand whether I’m a serial killer or not,” Cas smiles wryly.
read your file?” Steve asks. Because Steve has certainly never told Bucky his reaction to reading the file but knowing what’s in it, it’s not hard to draw the conclusion that it would leave Steve shaking.
“And I’ll take any way out that I can find.”
“Yeah, I’m not going, either,” Sam shakes his head.
Cas nods bitterly. “
“Come on, DeeEEan, you know what I am talking about,” Cas whines. “I am drowning all of my feelings and it is greeeaat.”
No wonder that they’ve become a failed relationship. Neither of them has been good for the other.
“Lucky.”
“I’m doing my best, Dean,” Sam sighs. “Alright, I gotta go. I’ll keep you posted, okay?”
Claire makes a face. "Bleh. But also, if all you wanted was to fuck him, you'd have done it already."
“What’s he gonna do? Have a spray bottle and spray me every time my body decides to move too close to Amara?” Dean snorts derisively.
“Dean, please believe me. I didn’t know. Claire was a happy child. A religious child. I thought what I was doing was for her best,” Cas pleads.
“Hey, you can hold hands with me again once we’re done eating. I’m not going anywhere,” Dean tries for a light and teasing tone.
When Cas comes back up from his search, he has both arms full of blankets and pillows. He comes over to the door where Dean crosses his arms and doesn’t budge.
It’s not a photo. It’s a screenshot. Of a google docs page.
He still smacks Sam on the head when his smug smile becomes too much, but Sam instead of retaliating types something into his phone and then has the audacity to snap a picture when Dean leans in to tussle Cas’ hair.
Dean grimaces because, fuck, it’s only him who could equal
“But what, Cas?” Balthazar’s voice has taken on a hard edge. “But you don’t want him to know that your own mother put you in a conversion camp? That they tried to electroshock you into being straight? That they had to put you in foster care?”
anymore…”
“Now tell me about your talk with Sam,” Cas encourages him.
“But we’re hunters,” Dean says and now his voice is small. “Hunters don’t do that kind of shit. Definitely not with each other.” It sounds like a feeble excuse but he’s got no words to explain what he means. Apart from that every hunter he knows who ever had a partner, they got violently killed.
Castiel turns to her, stopping her retreat with a hand to her shoulder. “I don’t have a mark,” he says simply.
“You were lucky,” Cas says. “She helped you set up.”
“Nothing to worry about. Kaia’s a good girl. You might call her a good influence on Claire. Don’t do it while Claire’s around, though,” Dean snorts. “Though it’s true. I’ve actually allowed her to invite Kaia to dinner tomorrow."
“So, uhh, why don't you come by our place tomorrow? We still have your tray and glasses, and you’ve been so welcoming to us, we’d like to return the favor.” The words are out of Dean’s mouth before he can think about them. It’s probably his confusion over holding Cas’ hand speaking but once said he can’t take it back.
"Nah, Claire let me in. She's on the phone with some girl?"
Dean smiles gratefully at the use of
Steve’s carrying the stack of empty glasses and Bucky’s carrying the tray. This way they don’t have to balance anything and they don’t have to let go of each other, either. Until they get to their porch that is, where Steve wants to free himself from Bucky’s hold to dig for his keys.
They smile at each other for a moment, because Nat is Nat and she’s badass and a badass friend to have.
“’s your choice,” Dean mumbles. “I mean, obviously. It‘s just… just that I miss you terribly and I don’t know what to do to make you not angry with me anymore. Like, not even get back together, just… I hate it that you’re angry and disappointed.” Which of the two is worse, he doesn’t know. As it is, his voice is getting smaller the more he feels Cas tensing next to him, so he stops. “You didn’t want to hear that. Sorry.” He hangs his head.
Who is a control freak, yes, and likes to be dominant, yes, and has no issues inflicting wanted pain. But looking at the letter, every hesitant line, every word that was visibly shaky screams at Dean that Cas is scared.
will deal with her.
“What?” Dean rips himself out of his stupor.
Sam’s bright smile has dimmed down some by now and he shoots a worried glance or two at Steve, before shaking his head at his screen again. “I can’t, Eileen,” he says, even while he keeps signing.
“Freaked out on him. Said a few things.” Dean shrugs. “I was drunk.” That should be explanation enough.
Cas wishes with all of his heart that this were true. That not everything got destroyed in that camp, that this strange and strong feeling of belonging he had before is still somewhere hidden inside him.
It’s jarring, the abrupt change of topic, but Steve tries to take it in stride. “If you’re up for it, sure.”
But obviously, he can’t let that stand. He can’t not at least make an offer to help.
Dean takes a sip from his coffee, watching Cas leave and contemplating about how in the fuck this has become his life.
Cause in the end, that’s what happened, isn’t it? Something about Dean that night when he was drunk and saying awful shit about himself had triggered Cas. And had him spiralling down into an abyss of self-hate and guilt that he hadn’t found a way out of. Not until he left town to deal with his past, anyway.
Cas puts his folded clothes down on the chair, stacking them very neatly. To win a few seconds to think, probably. It makes Dean bite his lip, insecurity returning. It’s still a bit of a breathless moment, though, when Cas turns around, no pile of clothes to hide his muscles and the low ride of his pants on his hips. Dean swallows hard. It is fucking unfair that Cas is so distracting.
Cas reaches for his beer with a shaky hand and draws a long gulp.
There’s something about his tone that changes Cas’ expression, though Dean isn’t sure whether that’s good or bad. He takes the risk, though, and pushes back into Cas’ space. He doesn’t touch him, though. Can’t.
“Hey Sammy, please tell me you got something,” Dean huffs. The night on the couch was no better than the last and the thing with Cas is bugging him, too. So all he wants to have is something on the case to work on so that he can bury himself in that and forget, because honestly, whiskey alone doesn’t cut it right now.
“Who was that?” Amara asks in lieu of a greeting, letting him go from her gaze for a heartbeat to scowl behind him.
Anyway, there was this dude. Sleazy guy, hair grease, tattoos. And his wingmen. Yeah. Chatting up Jo. No problem so far. Jo can shut random guys down. But then Dean had gone to the back, getting a new crate of beer. And they’d had Jo backed up against a wall. And fucking hell, no one backs his little sister up against a wall.
She leads them into an office. Dean would expect stacks of papers but there aren’t any. Instead, there are shelves lining the walls that house statues and glasses full of liquids and sands and things that he’s not sure he wants to know what they are.
Cas finds Dean in the kitchen furiously cutting some tomatoes.
“Are you asking whether I’m single, or are you doubting that I can keep my hands to myself?” Cas asks.
“Steve? Can I ask you a question?” Bucky’s still staring at the picture, softly rubbing a thumb over the pastels. He stops when the colors start to smear.
Dean’s feet are moving before his brain has even caught up with the sentence. Goddamn, Cas has a sexy voice when he gets bossy.
The next morning, the space beside him isn’t empty as usual. Steve stretches, his joints creaking after the night on the hardwoods. “How long have you been up?” he asks.
The shaking in fact starts the minute he’s slumped in the backseat of Charlie’s car.
Naively, Steve expects Natasha to be waiting for them on the porch. But of course she isn’t. They find her on their couch in the living-room, texting at lightning speed.
“Lara Croft?” Dean scoffs. “You based my soulmate on
Charlie looks severely unhappy but she says, “Because there won’t be a record of her not agreeing to an Unsealing.”
Bucky’s chuckling and looking up at him through the hair that’s still partially covering his face. There is actual mirth in his winter-blue eyes, which is so much more than Steve could have hoped for this shortly after a mention of HYDRA, so when Bucky lets go of Steve’s hand in order to wrap his arm around Steve’s waist, Steve doesn’t protest. Bucky leans up to give him a quick chaste kiss. “I think I agree with her, Cap,” he mutters.
He is reminded of how bad his hearing was before the serum, he has to strain so much to understand what Bucky says next. “What were we to each other, back then?”
Dean bites his lip but he smiles. “It’s nothing, Cas. Really.”
“I could make some,” Bucky answers, not reacting to the tone at all.
Cas shrugs. “You wanted an Unsealing so to not drag her into this. A gentleman even in madness.”
That it’s Cas that he wants and that he wants to be sober because he wants what they had and he wants all the playtime and he doesn’t want his judgement to be impaired. But it’s also more than that. He doesn’t want to go back to the person he was before Cas came into his life. He’s working on his coping mechanisms and even if it doesn’t help with the lovesick puppy thing, Dean’s life isn’t falling apart because Cas isn’t in it anymore. He doesn’t
“Get into fights,” Castiel emphasizes.
“Umm, we, we gotta start with the crust,” Dean stammers, doing his very best to will away all thoughts of Cas pressed up against him and how easy it would have been to close his arms around him and how close his neck had been and how he could have sunk his teeth into the flesh there, not enough to break skin, just enough to suck a hickey and make sure every random woman in the supermarket knows that Cas is taken and –
“Hmm? Oh, they can find space for us if they take us in. I mean, don’t get me wrong, she’ll put us to work, but we’ll be warm enough.”
“Yes, Dean,” Cas agrees exasperatedly. “I’m a Guardian. Are you aware of what Guardians do, Dean?”
The name repeats itself in his mind in Dean’s voice and suddenly he can breathe again. At least a little.
“Well, so did I,” Cas says and looks bewildered, like he genuinely doesn’t understand.
“Lighten up, Dean, just snapping a pic of Simpson for Eileen.”
Though of course it isn’t. It isn’t fine at all.
Dean snorts. Yeah, Gabe doesn’t need to be encouraged.
He’d allowed himself
“They found me - or rather, my LMD-me, before Stark could collect the body.” She looks openly upset now.
"So he's gonna be alone if we don't invite him?"
Dean doesn’t ask. “We need two anyway, so is it okay if I choose the second color?”
It’s a thought that Dean has had before. Which is why he has to know. “Cas,” Dean asks hesitantly, “this, us, is that atonement, too?”
Slowly, he rolls his sleeve back down. Anything good that he’d felt, any slight elation over how Cas had let him hold his hand yesterday, it’s all gone, replaced by images of throwing Cas into a wall. Of Cas’ blood on his hands. Who is Dean kidding? He can be the best pretend boyfriend in the world, it won’t change a thing. He’ll never be able to wipe that blood off.
Cas flushes even deeper and then there’s a miniscule nod. “Sometimes,” Cas admits. “And I don’t - but sometimes.”
Dean narrows his eyes at Steve. He doesn’t like it when people make fun of his worries. But then of course, Steve is also making fun of his own worries. Because he’s been checking back towards the door as well. So Dean nods jerkily. “In my experience, when I leave him alone, bad things happen.”
They kiss again, too. It’s different than Dean expected. He’s always found Cas attractive, thought that if he ever got to kiss him, he’d make sure the kisses ramp up, get hot and heavy and lead to shedding clothes fast, because Cas’ body is gorgeous and he stands by that opinion. Only now, the kisses they share are not about that. Like their arms wrapped around each other, they are a way to be close. To hold on to each other. To find one fixed point as their lives as they know them are ending. In a way, it makes them more powerful than anything Dean’s ever known before. And it doesn’t even matter that more than once their kiss tastes salty. It doesn’t matter who of them it is that cries, either.
“Of course,” she nods and lets go of him, too. “Cas?” She opens her arms.
That actually sounds like a pretty solid plan to Dean. But before he can answer, the door to the house opens and Cas and Bucky come back out.
Dean takes his mug from him with a nod of thanks but he looks at him in challenge. “But am I? Being dramatic? That’s what Rowena told us, right? That I need to die?”
And that sounds actually sensible. It sounds doable. Dean can go meet with Gabe’s contact and listen to what they have to say. If nothing else, it gives him another half day before he has to make a decision. Before he has to leave his life behind. “Okay,” he nods. “Okay, let’s do that.”
"She's on a date tonight," Dean divulges. "God, I hope she doesn't total my car."
“I like you, too, Cas,” Dean mumbles because it is the truth. Suddenly, he’s very tired.
Dean interrupts him. “I’ll call. I promise.”
“I’m going with him,” Cas stubbornly repeats.
“Jesus Christ, Cas,” Dean pants. “Don’t do that! I could have cut my finger right off!”
“Yes,” he repeats, his voice a little steadier this time. “I’m fine. But do you have time today? In the next few hours?” Before Cas comes home.
is more common than
“You won’t have to,” Charlie interrupts. “Neither of you. You set on California?”
It still takes Charlie nudging him forward for Cas to actually consider doing this.
"Because she's funny. And brave. And she never pities me. And her lips are very kissable. And I want to get to know her better cause she's interesting. And I want to touch her and make her feel good. And it makes me happy when I can make her laugh. When I can make her happy."
Dean goes for a huff and snort, but it comes out sounding wet and like tears and instead of answering he shifts towards Cas in invitation. It’s enough permission for Cas obviously since he wraps Dean up in a tight hug.
There is the warmth of a hand on his shoulder and Cas’ calm voice. “We’ll figure it out, Dean. We always do. If you want I can also reach out to my colleagues, maybe someone can counsel you.”
And sends Dean into a coughing fit when a piece of said
Next, Dean brings up the message thread with his brother. This one is easier and harder. Easier, because Dean’s got a lot of experience lying to his brother. Harder, because Sam’s always been there, almost as long as Dean can remember. And Dean’s always protected him, but he’s never before had to take himself out of the equation to protect Sam.
Dean’s head is spinning until he enters the bedroom - and there he is.
Dean smiles, no -
“Yeah?” Dean asks, going for cocky but possibly ending up somewhere around blushing as well.
Sam drops his bag with no doubt perfectly wrapped gifts on the table, comes over, washes his hands like a good boy, then washes the vegetables and gets to chopping.
“Try rerouting your code? Come at it from two sides?” Bucky proposes.
“Yeah, well, and I’m not a slob, so I can help.” Dean makes a detour into the living room to fetch everyone’s glasses.
It’s eerie, somehow, to have his brother’s inappropriate boyfriend be all sensitive and ask him questions. But then, Cas doesn’t have anyone to talk to. His friends are all also Dean’s friends. Hell, he’s only ever met them all because he’d known Sam from work and Sam introduced him to them when they accidentally met each other at the bar some night.
