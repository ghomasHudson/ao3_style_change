Eileen’s grimace in response tells him all he needs to know, but she still mouths back,
Dean’s never seen Abaddon as anything less than utterly unflappable. Even with a fucking corpse at her feet, she did nothing but turn a vicious smile at it. This feels right, her crawling her way up from the ground and screaming in agony to do it.
“Don’t be foolish,” Crowley says, turning around to look at him for the first time in a while. The fluorescents are flickering too much now, enough that Dean’s vision gets obscured. He can still see Crowley’s eyes, though, and they’re sharp, too sharp. “They followed my
When Dean leaves the training center, he’s laughing along with Cas. But he can’t stop thinking about the atmosphere in the room when they first came in, how quiet and still and goddamn creepy it was.
, and did I mention I got kidnapped for a couple of hours and only got saved by Cas’ powers when some
“Alright?” Dean echoes, and chuckles as best he can. He’s still catching his breath. “Yeah, I’d say that was –” Talking’s overrated. He finds himself dragging Cas against him and kissing him again. His mouth’s gonna be bruised, and his own come ends up smeared all over his stomach when they rub together so close, and he doesn’t care when it’s this damn amazing.
“These gals ain’t enough?” Dean had asked, laughing, as Staraptor swooped low enough for Vaporeon to swat at her. Then he’d shifted his expression to something more serious. “I think it’s crazy. I also think your crazy ideas are the best ones.”
Today, he readies himself to keep his head down and rush past the cop like usual, when he does a double-take. A Mienshao guards the cop, the two of them looking outright bored. When Dean looks up, it’s Victor, the cop who delivered his dad’s letter and key.
“These guys can’t even bother to use a code name,” Charlie whispers from next to Dean.
It isn’t going to take very long. Castiel knows Dean’s rather rightfully considered himself an expert on masturbation since he was thirteen, and now he’s using all his
Dean knows his cheeks must flush practically neon pink at that. But when he looks around the table, not only has everyone else raised their glass, they’re all smiling at him. Not the kind of pitying-ass smiles Dean saw too many times in the past when it became too clear to other adults what his living situation was. Sure, those adults weren’t gonna
the thanks I get, Sam —”
There’s an affirmative grunt. Sam steps in, and – he certainly wasn’t expecting what he sees.
But then Dean remembers the first time he slept with Cas and the careful skim of his fingers. His mind plays over every searing kiss, but also Cas cradling the back of his neck, his skull, like he’s something precious. Like he’s amounted to more than a locker full of junk from his old man, and a brother and Pokemon that turned out alright through no effort of his own. And hell, maybe he grew up a bit. Maybe he can have this. The very least he owes himself is to try.
“Let’s go save the world,” Dean announces to the two other passengers in the Impala, before he goes to follow Anna’s embarrassment of a vehicle. It’s not a particularly special day, gray and gloomy and there are so many towns that stretch out in front of him full of nothing but death and worse, but right now, he can actually believe it.
Castiel doesn’t react at first. Once Cas starts looking at his wings, though, he grimaces. All these months together, all these conversations like teeth torn out, and Dean still can’t figure out the guy at all.
“Feels good, Cas,” Dean breathes. He angles his hips away, because he’s pretty sure the second they touch between waist and knees, he’s gonna go off like a rocket.
“Got more fun for ya, Cas.” And if he had to feel Cas’
There’s no possible reaction Dean can even think of. He can’t do anything but goggle up at the sign until the letters go blurry. When Dean does manage to wrench his eyes away, Sam’s by his side. His mouth pops open and closed again like a fish.
“Mostly over at the Desert Resort,” Cas counters. It makes Dean feel better, but not by much. Despite the fact that the place is named Desert
“Please don’t tell me you’ve been talking to Zachariah,” Cas says, a strain in his voice.
They’re quiet when Cas sits back down. “That was a precursor to having sex, yes?” Cas asks.
“No worries,” Dean cuts him off. “Training ain’t all it’s cracked up to be.”
That last remark gets an awesomely disgusted bitchface from Sam. “Gross, Dean.”
destroy what he was. The woman named Cassie was first, then Caleb. Certain hunts, certain monsters, too many days together with Sam and his father. They’re gone from Dean now.
Dean never minded the taste of himself in someone else’s mouth, but this is part of him clinging to
“You can blame me for that,” Benny’s wife Andrea says, popping her head out of the kitchen door. Her Dragonair’s been hanging out up front, the less usual customers oohing and aahing over it. “It’s what people want.”
It’s impossible to live in Opelucid City and not know Edlund University. The place is as much of an institution here as the official Pokemon League gym, but Dean lives much closer to the college so he’s far more familiar with it. The campus is huge, sprawling its way over both the modern and older parts of the city.

Pokemon,” Cas points out, not unkindly. Said Water Pokemon curls her tail against Dean’s ankles, probably in an attempt to soothe his wobbly stomach. Her tail is nice and cool in the beating sun. The attempt doesn’t really work, but he appreciates it.
He doesn’t think. He keeps reading, even if it’s just running his eyes over the same words over and over again. He’s pushing on, is the thing, because it’s the one thing he can do.
“How did you –” Dean starts. Cas puts a hand on his back, in a show of protectiveness. It makes him cut the crying, anyway.
“What?”
They don’t bother to circle each other; they just make a crazed rush toward the center, where they meet in a flurry of limbs and awful metallic sounds as their swords clash. Normally, Mary knows, elbows to the face and hard kicks from a human won’t do shit to an angel, but she’s got the wards powering them down.
“Right.” She smiles back, but it doesn’t meet her eyes; she glances back and forth between the two of them, searching.
there and goggle. Normally, Cas’ voice has a thread of insistence woven through, but it’s gone now, so Dean’s guessing it was more than just a couple of seconds.

still understand his weird manly need for weaponry.
“Look at that,” Charlie says, a few days after Dean started at the nursery.
“Shit,” Charlie says, once Tessa’s gone back into her office.
“Sarah took these pictures, and this was a while ago,” Sam says, grimly now, shoving a photo album over. Almost 2015, and they’re still using these giant clunky photo albums, the edges curling and going yellow. “She likes Polaroids, I guess. Old-fashioned over some things.”

“Good.”
“I have my friends here,” Cas says. “From my
“Icirrus City and Goldenrod.”
“Good,” Cas responds, and there’s a little smile playing at his lips at the same time his voice already sounds — well — honestly, Dean’s been trying to keep himself under control so he didn’t shoot off in his goddamn
After what seems like a very long time, Castiel speaks again. “I don’t think it was all your fault.” His voice is clipped, and his tone no different than usual. Still, Dean can’t even imagine the expression on his face when he looks back at Castiel. “You were all in impossible situations. Probably not as impossible as what’s happening in my dimension, but that you managed to form a friendship at all – I can’t imagine that would happen in many circumstances.”
look on his face. He’s got no idea how she’s aware of what’s going on, but really, there are some things a Pokemon just shouldn’t know.
One of the corners of Cas’ lips pokes up. “Besides,” he adds, “if your last boyfriend was Lucifer, wouldn’t you swear off men for a while too?”
If Cas is gonna casually chat with legendary Pokemon now, Dean thinks he might lose it. He might really crack up, here on the still-smoking battlefield.
“Cas, he, uh, he wasn’t you,” Dean says when they’re outside the door to the dungeon. All Dean has to do is push it open, but he finds he can’t, not yet. “Sometimes, just talking to him, it helped, but – he wasn’t you. Sure as hell didn’t act like you. Not even when I first met you, and you had a pretty big stick up your ass then.” He lets himself laugh, before speaking seriously again. “You gotta know that, man.”
“Caring so much it hurts,” Dean responds, quietly.
“I’ll try. They were – rather frisky.” Cas hitches up the sleeve of his black jacket. There’s a brown blotch on his arm, faded by now but still standing out. It’s the remnants of a burn from those Darumaka, one where Dean had to have Vaporeon hose down Cas’ arms over. Once Dean’s momentary worry over Cas’ injuries had subsided, he’d been left with just Vaporeon and Cas, whose forearms dripped with water and shone. Some of Vaporeon’s spray had ended up on Cas’ neck, and lone, treacherous beads of water had slid down, under his shirt collar.
“I don’t know,” Cas responds. “Only a few minutes and a month at once. Time doesn’t move in any way you would be used to here.”
Later. Later, because now, he has Cas spread out, naked, in full. Dean touches him, and if Cas notices that his hands are trembling he thankfully says nothing. His fingers find Cas’ shoulders, his nipples, the spurs of his hipbones. One hand finds Cas’ and holds on tight, fingers braided together as their palms kiss.
that reach gut-deep on him, the slowest he can go all frenzied like this too. Seriously, where’s his trophy.
A man can only take so much. Dean’s orgasm rips the breath right out of him. It’s a sudden motion, like being knocked on his ass, leaving him lightheaded and shaking. Cas is normally kind of gross about Dean’s come, wants him to mark it on his back or across his thighs, and he’ll pull away when he’s just about done blowing Dean so he can anoint his face with it. Like his skin has a damn craving. But this time, Dean’s caught too off-guard, and he finishes right in Cas’ ass.
Charlie’s eyebrows go right up to her hairline. “Maybe I should start siphoning out of
Ellen just gives them a weird look, which is totally deserved, but thankfully leaves them alone after that. They’ll let her know the truth soon, anyway.
The expression on Cas’ face has flipped over from pity to real interest, and Dean’s grateful for that. “I’ll see what I can do,” he says, and everyone returns to their meal. That part of the conversation is over, for now. Dean’s not sure if he should be grateful.

any more.”
“I worked too hard to call it that, Zach,” Lucas says. “I tapped into power unheard of before. And it was all – right inside me.”
Mary would tell the Cas she knew to
; and Staraptor next to Cas, wearing an expression like the very act of sitting is insulting to her even as she fluffs up her feathers and cuddles more deeply into his side. Sam is sawing logs off in Cas’s spare bedroom, probably keeping Amy awake, and Dean made sure everyone else found a place for the night as well.
. Those claws thud to the ground a few seconds later, and Cas has to shove the wolf carcass off him with a grunt.
“As much as Whimsicott is a delight, I would absolutely not hesitate to Flamethrower him,” Castiel says, nonchalant.
“Sucks, don’t it.” Some of the gruffness has returned to Dean’s voice. He wipes his hand off on his overshirt, balls it and tosses it to the floor, and then struggles back into the rest of his clothing. Only for a few seconds does he take his eyes off Castiel, and Castiel knows he is
Because Dean likes his job so much, it hardly ever seems like serious
Tamara’s picked up her Manectric. His coat is spiky, and almost all Electric-types have skin laced with static electricity, but she still cradles him to her. His eyes loll shut in satisfaction. “Found the sanctuary when I was looking for work.
Cas is warm in Dean’s arms, with the kind of warmth that reminds him that Cas isn’t really of this world. Or maybe it’s the kind of warmth that you can only feel around someone who – means what Cas does to him.
“Little?” Dean huffs out a laugh.
“A girl tries to promote a good time, and look what she gets!” Charlie yells after Jody, but she’s laughing, too, as she does it.
There isn’t, like, a crowd waiting with cameras in front of their cabin or whatever, at least. Good start.
Marowak approaches him. Tension locks up his thighs. When it comes to fight or flight, he’s gonna pick the latter, but in this situation he’d feel like a real dick. He feels Vaporeon ready behind him, too, and she’s a well-trained Pokemon with the type advantage. It’s going to be okay, he keeps telling himself. It’s going to be okay.
unsettling it is. It’s certainly not his dad’s awful, wicked slash of a grin; it’s the big, goofy smile of a
“The one and only.” Maybe this conversation’s getting more interesting. Just that thought sends a stupid thrill alight through his body. Stupid traitor mind,
“Yeah, you just
Dean actually full-body shudders. “No,” he agrees. The big nasties that live here might be scared shitless of the two poor lost suckers, but Dean’s seen it way too often: parents gotta protect their kids.
That’s when he remembers Cas is right behind him. Like hell Dean is going to be intimidated by someone wearing a belly shirt. “Excuse me,” he says in return, trying to sound casual and failing. He elbows through the protesters, trying not to care about the darts of their glares thrown right toward his back. The crowd thins out, eventually, and by the time he gets to the entrance to the nursery, only one person’s waved a placard in his face in the past hundred feet or so.
. “No. I don’t know.”
Then it was only Dean and Vaporeon, trying and failing to fill that entire house. The six of them, the four Winchesters and John and Mary’s Pokemon, Zebstrika’s plodding hooves and Leafeon’s softer tread, used to sound like a Thunder attack coming down the stairs. Dean might have only been ten years old when it ended, but he’ll never forget that blissfully happy cacophony. It became nothing but the empty clunk of Dean’s own boots and Vaporeon’s nearly silent padding alongside him.
“I don’t think I liked the music,” Castiel tells Dean by way of greeting this morning. “It was loud and dissonant.”
in a neutral, tinny robotic voice. The e-mails bounce back, and there’s something wrong with that, but Dean still waits for some sign from Sam, somehow. It doesn’t come. He shouldn’t be surprised by now.
Now, though, the Wynaut are asleep, collapsed across the floor of their enclosure. A couple of them have crammed into the enclosure’s cave even now. Their big mouths open and shut, almost comically, with every breath they take. “I feel bad for the little guys,” Dean says, keeping his voice low so he doesn’t wake the Wynaut up and send them scattering. “The kids that try and see ‘em – they mean well, but they’re terrorizing them just by being here.”
“You know – after he found out about the Latios thing, and what Naomi had done, he kinda freaked. I don’t think you or I would blame him for that. Some heads-up would be nice this time around.” There’s another long pause in their conversation. Vaporeon, seemingly unbothered by any of this, bounces around in a circle around Garchomp.
Cas holds out the tape to Dean. It’s nearly identical in appearance to the tape Dean gave him, now safely held in the tape deck of his truck, only the front of this tape reads
Dean can tell you this much, though:
Dean’s pretty sure Staraptor, as a species, don’t have tear ducts. But he knows that if Staraptor had them, she’d be worse off than he is. Since the moment he met her, when she saved his ass with plenty of flair, he’s been incredibly intimidated; nothing phased her, nothing even seemed to make her react in a way beyond mild to extreme annoyance. Here she is now, though, trying her best to wrap her wings around Dean and hold on.
They’ve moved on — and that’s not a bad thing. They’ve moved on to something bigger and better than what they were. Dean’s still awed by Cas, in a way, but it’s because Cas has seen all of him, knows what a moron he is and everything, and he’s sticking around. Not only that, the guy keeps coming back. Like nothing Dean’s ever known, Cas gives him faith, and he doesn’t know why the hell an angel chose him and never will, but he thinks he’s giving Cas faith too. It still shakes him to his very core, and he needs those hands tracing over his body, those lips on his own, to remind him of it, but it’s there.
Cas slips a palm onto his abs, slotting his fingers into the easy dips there. And then he goes right for tweaking a nipple, which sends a hot and unexpected shock through Dean. Not fair at all.
, Winchester, you’re not thirteen years old – and he keeps sneaking glances. There’s this weird charge in the air when he does it, like he just missed Castiel looking back at him.
“Hello, Dean,” Alastair says with a smile jagged and cold as the bottom of an iceberg. “It’s been
If Dean opened his eyes right now, he’s sure he’d see those city lights blinking in front of them. He’s so glad they did this. Just them, the night, and their patiently-waiting Pokemon.
“A Staraptor. Like my wayward brother.”
He rushes down to the dungeon in the basement. His lungs are aflame and every thought is gone from his head. When he gets there, though, he’s not at all surprised by what he finds. Most of the chains are spread out over the floor by now, their silver glinting like a rushing river in the darkness.
? Yeah, he already knows that he
as anyone could be. Why pray to the other Castiel? I don’t understand why you care so much.”
They stop back at Carver, of course, to take Nancy back with them. Most of Sam’s friends stay behind at the apartments – they’re not daring to set foot on campus – though Amy goes to help them find their way. “I grew my hair out since I went on leave,” she says, a little too cheery. She sounds like she’s trying to convince herself. “They won’t recognize me. I’ll help you find your way around campus.”
At this point, even Sam knows better than believing in that crap. He and Dean have both seen real horror anyway. It ain’t anything like a Purrloin.
, a sort of desperate thrashing with wild abandon accompanied by spilling their drinks until the floor gets sticky. Dean can spy Becky trying to dance with her Munna while that goddamn “Call Me Maybe” song plays.
Just once, Dean wants to realize he’s being an asshole when he actually is, not three days later.
There are no trees in the wide clearing, but the grass sprouts tall enough that it brushes past Dean’s ankles. Reaching up from the grass, like a particularly long stem, is another tear in the universe, humming yellow. If Dean focuses enough, he can see the charred ground beyond it.
“I just wanted to talk to you,” Sam calls back.
But all logic said she’d never set foot on earth again. All logic said Sam and Dean and Cas could never beat the Devil and save the world. All logic said she would be stuck under Toni’s conditioning for the rest of her life, her mind lost in fake paradise while her body murdered family after family all the way across the United States.
“Payback,” he tells her. She doesn’t grumble in return, just lets him keep painting across her flank.
The words send a chill through Dean’s entire body. He locks up even as he pushes away from Castiel’s leg. This is the last fucking thing he wanted, so of course it’s right here in his lap. “You – I can’t – not with you, I can’t –”
“I know,” Gabriel returns, smug. “Now we just gotta figure out what to do to stop the bastards.”
“Your tattoos.”
“Very sensitive there, yes?”
and drag Dean back.
“I might’ve thought about it too.” Dean’s got no idea how he’s forming words right now. His brain’s on a pleasure-drowned vacation.
“What?”
“With my vessel’s soul gone, there’s little separation between me and any physical sensations.” He makes a sound Dean wasn’t even sure he was capable of making, something like a gasped-out
. “They’re very strong, their powers beyond what any other Pokemon can do –”
is?” Her eyes are bright and her voice almost too steady, like it’s something reverential.
“Hey man, I’m tired, not dead.” He laughs and outright squirms against the sheets. Again, really not doin’ much for his rep, but he doesn’t care. He’s spent years building that up, but the big gorgeous hands all over him, the rumble in his ear, all of it feels a million times better than shoving any emotion he might’ve had down.
good job.
“I was planning on resting right here,” Cas returns snippily, like
without you.”
“Lots of years of old knowledge and research.” She claps a hand on his shoulder, and seriously, Dean thought Inais’ hero worship was borderline creepy with Cas; he really didn’t need to see the look on his face when Anna does that. “I’m sure you helped along the way, honestly.”
Castiel has never been so aware of the way Dean’s forehead is so close. He remembers Dean’s braying
The nearest dorm, according to the way-too-friendly students – Dean thinks of the coiled fury inside Tracy that time she whirled him around, desperate to shake him out of his apathy, and how much she’d have to whirl
When he gets dressed, he pulls his henley off well aware Cas’ eyes are on him, tracing over the broad lines of his shoulders and the twin bumps of his shoulderblades. His back isn’t as covered with tattoos as his arms are, but a couple of them are definitely visible from the back; he’s also got his dad’s dog tags tattooed over his hip, because he’s nothing if not an overly sentimental sucker, even for people who didn’t deserve it. He knows he has a cluster of freckles at the small of his back, and the idea of Cas’ eyes zeroing in on them makes a hunger rise up in him, swift and vehement.
Dean thinks, and Sam totally bites his lip like he’s trying not to laugh at that, the little bitch — “But for the last three years, I’ve been working to try and save your world in between fun little battles with demons I used to call my family, when I don’t even like it all that much. And, oh yeah, every day I get to hear it from people, even people I
“Do you think he’s dead? Or do you think he’s just
“That isn’t what
. He keeps their fingers intertwined, not wanting to let go of Cas’ long and outright elegant fingers. Both their hands press against Dean’s chest, right against his heartbeat. Dean keeps his eyes trained right on Cas’ face.
Dean thought maybe these quiet moments would be different now, with the knowledge that Cas is something strange, something other. But they remain the same. Cas still smells like his weird woodsy soap, and he’s still got that little whorl of hair growing in by his ears. Dean could never touch him again, and it’d be a screaming hurt, but if they got to lie close to each other and Dean could see his face with the lights playing against it and they could talk just like this, it’d be alright.
*****
He doesn’t say anything in return. He just squeezes Cas’ hand in return, reaches his legs out so Vaporeon’s pushed up against his calf, and lets the peace of the moment work its way through him.
Dean can’t pick any lock on the cage. In fact, the cage doesn’t seem to have a lock at all. There’s no other way out, no loose bottom  or screws to pop off. It’s probably as close to escape-proof as possible.
“Whatever you say. I’m probably a lot less fucked in the head.” He taps his temple and laughs, throaty enough to make Dean cringe. The barrel of the gun wobbles. “Some of the shit I’ve seen in here…”
here at Edlund. Barnes is cool, she’s the blind lady with a seeing-eye Octillery. Leave Cain alone, though. He just wants to practice fighting with his Doublade. Pretty awesome to see,
Dean gets back to his feet. He’s wobbly, and Vaporeon keeps looking at him in a way that’s so unbearably
“Hey, Cas?” he speaks, after a long time. He shifts his head until their eyes meet.
Cas’ eyes still light up like all of Heaven’s behind them whenever someone says
“You saying I’m keeping it together?” Dean comes up with, eventually. That broken smile is stuck on his face.
“It is. It’s home.” She’s breathing very hard.
Dean’s never gonna be friendly with Gordon. He thinks that other than Erika and Kubrick, Gordon doesn’t really do
She nods to Sam. “I think I can now.”
There is one hell of an awkward pause after that one.
“You have no idea.” Dean sounds grumpier than he wanted, but when Victor gets the whole story, he’ll understand. He slumps against Cas’ side, and makes sure one of his arms stays in direct contact with Cas even if it’d probably be more comfortable if he moved it. He makes damn sure his foot’s touching Vaporeon, too; she’s curled up by his feet in the car like she doesn’t have a care in the world.
Lucas’ only response is to start glowing purple. Neon purple, enough to throw the entire area into high relief. Black stones cut jagged lines into the expanding contour lines of color around him, until he starts changing.
Cas, though, only smiles indulgently. “I suppose he has an acquired sense of humor. And yes, my adopted brother. Both of us.” He pauses, the thoughtful sort of pause as if he’s considering what to say next. “Many more where that came from.”
He puts his hand in Cas’ hair instead. That feels better; that feels awful.
“What,” he slurs out, tossing a can of PBR – really? – into a pile with the others.
He could mean so many things. Castiel doesn’t let him think, hauling Dean against him. They kiss, one slipping into the other, and it’s so wet and noisy and good that Castiel’s baffled humans find anything else to do at all.
He’s unused to this many people, too. Most of the time, the only company he gets is Sam sitting in the backseat with him, Vaporeon and Sam’s Espeon squished too tightly next to them because Dad’s Zebstrika needs the front seat. None of them are much for talking on those rides.
On the way out that night, Dean catches Cas, who of course volunteered to stay late already, in one of the Cubone enclosures. “You’ve had a long day, I know,” Cas is saying to the Cubone, completely serious, like they’re his coworkers too. It’s completely ridiculous.
“Things in this universe,” Castiel says, interrupting his thoughts, “they’re far more complicated.”
But Cas doesn’t need to know any of this. “Sure,” is all Dean says in reply, hating the spike in his voice. Cas definitely gives him one hell of a curious look, but thankfully doesn’t press the issue.
Like, even Gabby gives him a thumbs-up and a gigantic grin and everything. “Congrats on the sex!” she even calls out, which, okay, even for Gabby that’s awkward. Even for like,
Dean suspected as much, but just hearing the words puts him in fight or flight mode. His heart thumps thickly against his ribcage; his legs ache with the need to bolt outta here. “Then why’d you stay? Why are you still here?”
He doesn’t know what to expect. He doesn’t even know why he goes, really. He just knows that his apartment is too fucking small right now, like the whole thing could get folded too neatly into the envelope if he stays sitting there with Vaporeon too long. That’s how he finds himself wandering through the streets, going not to the pier but the edge of town, with the address in the letter.
But even though Castiel was literally inside Jimmy, sinking under his skin and putting his nerves alight, Dean’s sure Cas never dug into Jimmy the way he’s dug into him. He can’t have knocked Jimmy as off-center the way he’s done to Dean; Cas punches this feeling into him like Dean ran a marathon with a hellhound at his heels and sank into a big comfy chair, the type he never owned, at once. It can’t be.
when he came. “Your stop around here?”
guy,” Dean says. “He steals. He’s violent.”
“Let’s make this easier,” Dean breathes, his voice already gone raspier than normal. He’s moving, then, all but dumping the shirt off. Castiel stares, unabashed, at the flex of muscles and the subtle shift of Dean’s skin, the pretty curve of his biceps and the easy bend of his fingers.
“Daphne,” Dean brings up one — day, night, you can’t fucking keep track in a place like this, and the sky is a swirling miasma. Cas keeps looking up at it in alarm, but he hasn’t had to bust out the wings or whatever, so it must be okay for now. “Uh, what was the deal there?”
“Shut up, Meg,” Dean grumbles, but there’s affection behind it. He kinda loves the whole goddamn world right now, even the poor suckers stuffed with corn syrup, crawling with their fat bellies on the ground. He
“Yeah?”
Dean looks up to see Cas smiling at the two of them. “The truth is,” Cas says, “I don’t even have eggs. Are you disappointed?” He’s leaning against one of the walls, arms at his sides, and Dean takes a moment to appreciate the lines of his body exhibited so starkly.
“Thanks.” Mary let herself stare at the business card. Growing up the way she did, with her dad – she would have never considered it. But, well, it’s been a weird year since she came back. Decades, if you count her time in the other universe. Amazing and awful in equal measure, sometimes.
to remembering. Leafeon were very powerful Pokemon, and Mary’s in particular had a whole shelf of trophies and droopy ribbons from tournaments decades in the past, but by the time Sam and Dean came around, Mary’s Leafeon was a docile creature who spent most of his time napping in sunspots on the lawn. Sam and Dean were usually able to poke Zebstrika into a good mood, too.
Dean pauses at that. “You don’t need to sleep, do you? I mean, you’re still an angel —”
. The motion reminds him too much of the way Jo palmed his cheek even under Osiris’ control, and Dean couldn’t stand leaning forward or away. In the end, though, just about everything feels like it.
He sputters words out, so he doesn’t have to face that. “I — look. Not to go all friggin’ Britney Spears on you here, but my life kinda sucked without you.”
“I wasn’t gonna.”
,” Mary hisses, because apparently Dean’s mouth isn’t working right now. She clenches her fist around the handle of her empty coffee mug; judging by the way her biceps flex with the force of her grip, she is more than ready to smash a ceramic mug against the skull of Lucifer’s kid. “Or give us a good explanation.”
Cas whips his head toward Dean’s in obvious alarm. “You – what?”
“You mean
“What do we do?” he asks Vaporeon, putting a finger on the envelope.
for a bit – or petting Zebstrika. She’s way less temperamental than he remembered.
“Huexkull. He went home.”
power
,” Vaporeon trills, pacing near Dean’s feet. He might’ve been pissed, but he’s got nothing on Vaporeon, who’s snarling in a way Dean’s rarely seen from her before. Vaporeon was pretty friendly with Zorua; they chased each other around while Dean and Delta were busy.
Cas nods, but he doesn’t look too happy about it. Then, because the guy’s apparently fucking evil, he swiftly unbuttons his pants and tugs them down, leaving him in just – well, Dean knows he wears boxer briefs now. They’re gray and cling to his thighs, which are thicker than Dean was expecting, the lines of muscle in them clear.
“Find some better friends.”
These little guys are practically babies. Half of them can’t really walk; they stagger around in wobbly circles until they collapse on the ground, their overly big and bone-heavy heads anchoring them there. Their arms and legs wiggle pathetically.
“Sounds great.”
“Sleep Powder!” Gabriel calls out. Whimsicott makes a damn acrobatic leap over the shifting glare, leaving a trail of powder in his wake, but the powder just dissolves right into its form with no effect at all. Halfway through his jump, Whimsicott hits some kind of invisible wall, and he spirals right into the morass of screeching white below.
“All of them, so – just in his world, or –”
Dean wants to flinch away from Cas’ touch. But every instinct he has, as always, tells him to stay right where he is and lean into it. He’s not going to fight those any more; his instincts make him a damn good hunter, and Cas’ fingers and palm are so warm. “Not much to understand.”
Gabriel arrives not long after, then all but lifts Anna up in a hug when she arrives. “
Dean doesn’t know what he was expecting, with the tension in the room practically hissing around them, but it sure as hell wasn’t that. “I – I dunno,” he responds. “We talked a lot.”
“You could talk to the guy instead of peeing in a circle around him.”
But he can’t stop his feelings, stupid as they might be. He’s here with Cas, his bed warm with their body heat. Vaporeon and Staraptor are outside their door, probably sleeping collapsed on top of each other.
“I found this room for us,” he explains, and you’d have to be looking to see the quiver in his arms against the table.
He makes Cas practice on some of the other mostly rusted trucks and cars because no way he trusts the guy with his baby. Plus, if Cas is going above, oh, forty miles per hour, that’s when he tends to start rambling on about ant mating habits and not paying attention to the road, and Dean’s real grateful for Cas’ angel powers; it’d suck to make it through Purgatory and this fucked-up brave new world only to die in a giant fiery wreck.
, but that hasn’t been my experience.” He snaps his fingers.
It’s not as if Castiel had never considered this before. He may have been a virgin in every sense of the word, but he knows it’s a way humans and angels alike convey affection. Angels cannot read minds without express permission, exactly, but they can sense louder thoughts, and that’s how he knew Dean desired this, too.
She can tell from the angel’s expression. He might still keep fighting, but his eyes have something wild and
At least Dean’s able to manage a smile in response to that, however shaky. “Then I don’t wanna hear about
“Sure. That Metatron guy.”
“I regret a lot. Everything. Sometimes I regret that we met, you know, not because – just that I must’ve screwed everything up for you. I’m sorry, okay? I’m even less for apologies than I am goodbyes, so don’t get used to it.” He laughs again.
“I –”
“What?” Dean’s sure he misheard him. Or misunderstood, either way. He’s still sleepy.
He feels one, though: the most stupidly soft kiss against the back of his neck. Dean squeezes his eyes shut at that, because no, no, no, he can’t have this, it’s going to fall apart, he’s going to destroy it, he’s gotta let it slip away while he still can. But then he’s squeezing Cas’ hand just as hard, because he hasn’t had something like this to hold on to for too long.
“Dean,” Cas interrupts, firm but kind. “Good things do happen.”
She’s about to say something to Castiel, when Sam comes rushing out of the house, gun drawn. He’s yelling, something Mary can’t make out, but she’s already holding out her arms to him.
better than the looks he gives him when Cas actually does come on the missions, and Dean pulls the angel aside to ask him some stupid question about whether his angel knowledge can help them out.
For as much as Dean’s thought of Vaporeon, Charlie, and Benny as total traitors at various points, Dean’s mind is in fact the worst traitor of all, because he thinks Cas looks good in anything.
“What are you gonna do?” Dean asks. He immediately wants to kick himself for doing so, but the question’s out there.
It couldn’t have been more than a couple of minutes when Dean hears it, an urgent hiss in the night that calls out “
Lucas, in his very large and
Dean isn’t surprised that Vaporeon all but jumps in front of him, but he gestures to her to get the hell back
Dean lets the moment linger. It swells, the two of them in the hallway, until – “So, you and Kelly – what’d you guys get up to?” Dean gets out, eventually, just to break the tension hunched over them. He could cringe at his tone.
Okay, so there’s a couch too. It’s not even all that uncomfortable; Dean spent most of the time sleeping on the twenty-four hour shifts on that same couch, because Gilda would come over for Charlie and Andrea would show up if Benny was doing the overnight too. Didn’t even wake up with a crick in his back or anything.
,” she chides, but she seems less robotic now than just a few seconds ago. “Muriel, so are those uniforms. Watch the sand attacks.” Dean lets himself breathe.
, and it’s a whole ‘nother ballgame. It isn’t about possessiveness, but settling into someone. His hands settle at Cas’ hips, like a reminder. His fingertips brush the lines of bone that stick out there, and he feels the goosebumps pimple up in response. He wishes they could sink in entirely.
for him. His flush drains away, but a small smile remains on his face.
They don’t have to walk far. On the steps leading up to Jody’s office, Vaporeon and Staraptor are curled up next to each other and fast asleep.
Sam pulls one of those faces that Dean figures is meant to express the great depths of his frustration with his stupid-ass brother, but really just makes him look like a lost puppy. As for Dean, well, he’s absolutely not having stupid puppyish feelings because Cas is pouting at the bloody, dirty, limp pile of fabric in his arms. And he’s totally not watching the way the angel’s borrowed – though, not really any more, Jimmy returned to his family after the Apocalypse and Cas given a human body all alone and griping about it sometimes – fingers trace the ugly shreds.
For once, Gabriel does. Then, a few minutes later, she mutters something again. “We’re gonna get him back,” she nearly whispers, voice dropped almost a whole register and serious. “
Dean is carefully tending to their breakfast, when he feels Cas peering over his shoulder. “It’s just eggs,” Dean says, sheepishly.
“We got the whole upper floor,” Sam tells him. “There are definitely a bunch of spare bedrooms. Shouldn’t be too much of a problem, uh, getting you and Cas your own room. If you want it.”
, he’s in public and not fifteen years old and he can control himself, thank you very much — when he sees it. “Was that not okay?” He sounds irritated, like he wants to get right back to it. Dean’s internally fist-pumping so fucking hard, even with all the eyes on him.
A while passes, but eventually, Dean gets out a “Yeah,” because that’s about all he can say. Funny, he knows every detail of Jimmy’s face, saw Castiel take his form even in Purgatory and Heaven where the angel should’ve been a screaming Chrysler-sized beam of death light or whatever, but he doesn’t know the guy at all. His face, his every expression, stopped being his own a long time ago.
my Goldeen,” Josie told the courtroom, a dark hush falling over all of them, in a tone of voice so steely Dean would have never expected it from her. Abaddon tried to protest, but Josie had excavated police reports that she’d insisted on keeping confidential at the time, so she had no argument left.
“Never,” Cas says.
“I want to meet with Hannah,” she says, still holding her fists forward. She twists her waist as inconspicuously as she can, until the gun shines on her hip. Very little in this place has that kind of brightness, and nothing else is clean; she knows they’ll notice. “I have a deal to make.”
As if on cue, that’s when Sam does say, “It’s not your fault, Dean.” Dean opens his eyes, and he’s glad Sam doesn’t meet them; Dean knows it’s not because he’s nervous, but because if he did, Dean would just glare at him until he shut the fuck up. “Just — everything’s not your fault. For your sake.” Now Dean looks at Sam, because what does his own sake matter. “For
“Got worried I wouldn’t see you again, Dean,” she trills, and it’s disturbing as Hell — ha, bad word choice — that she can look so different now, but have the exact same stride and quirk to her lips. “I’d gotten disturbingly attached.”
Dean rummages through cabinets until he finds a dusty glass bottle, and pours the contents into Bobby’s coffee. He peels the plastic covers off the last two slices of Kraft cheese and lets them melt down onto the sizzling bacon on a biscuit for Castiel. And he spends an inordinate amount of time that only Castiel sees slicing the dark and soft spots off apples and cantaloupe and peaches before he cuts them into cubes and dumps them in a bowl, for Sam’s fruit salad.
Sam’s mouth actually falls open, eyes wide and wild, but before he can say anything, Dean’s back in the room. He has a duffel bag hoisted over one shoulder, but the heft that’s clearly weighing him down is more than just a bag.
Lucas’ Hydreigon flies by him not long after. She’s counterattacking Dean’s allies in the area, sending them flying back with long tendrils of tar-black energy; there’s no doubt she’s a supremely well-trained Pokemon. But her movements are so unnatural, herky-jerky, like she’s nothing but a wind-up toy. Something’s just missing from her. Dean wishes he could find some way to give it back.
It also feels like everything Dean’s ever wanted. He doesn’t dwell on that too much.
“I need someone else to stay overnight with Cas,” Jody tells him, and even in her matter-of-fact voice, the words
He places his palms flat on the table, willing them to steady. He breathes. When he blinks, he swears it’s that same dull yellow behind his eyelids.
, her loyalty to her service greyhound Carina, her gorgeous fucking crossbow, and the very undignified squeak she makes when Claire bites her nipples.
Sam furrows his brow for a couple of seconds, clearly unsure. But then Castiel lifts his head up, so his face is visible outside of the robes. The confusion is gone in a second, as Sam’s eyes go enormous as the full moon.
Dean is starting to like crazy Cas, the one who rambles on about how honey is the most superior food of all because it doesn’t spoil, much better than the one who gazes at him with those ridiculous eyes and looks like he wants to Talk. Not talk. Capital-T Talk.
There’s nothing wrong with Nacrene. In fact, Dean’s been there enough times to say it’s a perfectly nice city, with its solid granite buildings. That’s just the thing; he’s
The years, and all those nights in jail, haven’t been kind to Alastair. He was tall and thin, yes, but not
“What the
“Your loyalty is consistent. And it’s an admirable trait.”
“You can join me here,” Cas repeats. “Or you can wander on ahead and I will find you later.” Sure, Cas is giving him the choice, but Dean looks down at the guy and his face is set in obvious disapproval of the latter option.
“Or red,” Anna adds. “I – I remember too. Not that I remember much but distracting Zachariah while I snuck out.”
But Dean knows that’s bullshit. He needed
gonna talk.”
Everything Dean does should be horrifying. Castiel should not be thinking
Cas is sitting at a nearby table, engrossed in a book. Dean absolutely does not feel a new hot jolt move through him just
“No, not the convenience,” Dean spits back in Castiel’s face. “It wasn’t ever that.”
“Thanks,” Krissy says at last. “It was Aiden’s.” She looks over her shoulder a couple of times. The too-big grin is gone. “I could use some air. Too smoky in here.” It’s a non-smoking bar. But she’s on her way out anyway.
Sam’s actually chuckling at that. Dean
“Yeah, actually.” He moves past her; Kelly tenses up for a couple of seconds, but he’s only reaching deeper into the cabinet to pick out a box of cornflakes she’d missed. “For Jack?”
and Cas isn’t strung-out and hopeless. It might be 2014, and they might all be stuck in a shitty world in Camp Chitaqua, but they can make it better this time. Sam looks older, but not beaten yet.
Before he speaks, Cas slides his hand over Dean’s forearm. It’s slow, careful, deliberate. Cas has touched him before, and God knows Dean luxuriated in the memory of those touches. God knows he’d put one hand over the spot where Cas’ fingers had warmed him just hours before while he used the other hand to frantically get himself off. But this touch, there’s something new in it, Cas’ searching fingers a seedling curling its way into the sunlight.
“Even I’m aware this is not how baseball is normally played,” Cas comments. No announcer’s on the game, either, and it’s creepy to watch the batter take a long, lazy swing at a pitch that lands ten feet in front of home plate.
They head off together, Dean following Charlie down the rows in between the enclosures. They’re twisty like a maze, and he’d easily lose his way if not for her. They pass the early afternoon swaddling some Scraggy; their skin folds constantly sag, making it impossible for them to walk, but their fingers aren’t developed enough to pull the folds up. Together, they corral all of them, and for the time being, the Scraggy can get along fine.
, where there was nothing but ease in her gait before. Ease, and viciousness, and that easy wicked laugh Dean will hear in his nightmares for decades. Her hair’s starting to come out of its tight binding, long red strands framing her face. The strands look like blood. Fitting.
Cas’ expression changes so quickly, it’s like a switch was flipped. The smile’s gone, replaced by a glare that’s like a steel-toed boot to the gut — and Dean knows exactly what that feels like, thanks.
Dean feels like he’s on one of those shaky candid camera shows he sometimes watches when there’s nothing else on. “To the left, over there,” he says, pointing.
He wasn’t panicking.
, that’s fucked up,” he continues, his voice rising. He clamps it down again. “But… I wouldn’t have Vaporeon without that. I don’t forgive him, don’t think I ever will. But it was a shitty situation for everyone, and I’m – I guess I’m at peace with it.” Dean chuckles, and a host of other Pokemon in the ranch chatter back in response to it. “At peace. Never thought I’d say that about anything.”
Alright. Let’s go save the world.
She’s the one that unites this entire ragtag group of followers. Her own kind of power.
“What about Anna?”
They’re driving in exaggerated loops around the chainlink perimeter of the camp. Dean’s laughing his ass off, basically, at the look on Cas’ face every time he works the gear shift. It helps him ignore the funny tug in his gut when he watches Cas’ fingers curl around said gear shift and
Dean, because it’s the same look
“Here in Unova?” Dean wipes away some of the sleepiness from his eyes and sits up on the sofa. “Cas, you gotta be careful. You were the one saying you didn’t want Zack or anyone else to catch you.”
. Plus, I don’t think Cas would exactly appreciate it. He’d just be all broody about it, though. You ever see Anna when she’s mad?
Whatever Cas does, the awful nightmares don’t return to him. It’s just blessed, blank sleep. When he wakes up the next day, the sun’s shining bright through the window, probably late afternoon.
Carver’s a big campus, and it takes Dean and Cas a while to get to the edge of it and into the city proper. Dean knows from everything he read – again, goddamn masochist tendencies – that Goldenrod’s very well-off. It’s one of the richest cities in the entire Pokemon world. There are many thriving trainer centers here, and with them a boon of Pokemon Centers too. The city borders the water, and they’ve got the most advanced transportation, boats and trains and planes alike. It’s the best city in the world for trade and exchange, both of goods and ideas. Or it
“Uh, going where?” Dean has to ask, even as he’s standing up and moving next to Castiel.
“Cas.” Dean levels a look at him. “
it, and Dean can feel it in his bones; he doesn’t even have a hint of worry, not with Cas, not after all they’ve been through. It’s the transport to the diner in Chicago so Dean could try the best pie in the continental US. Dean
Leaf after leaf drags itself across Giratina’s skin. Destruction by a thousand paper cuts.
“Thanks,” Dean says, trying steadfastly to ignore the little bump in his own voice. They’ve all recovered, and no one’s hurt, but the bus is still left stalled in the middle of the road.
“You think Tessa held out on us? All the knowledge, I mean.”
“You’re right,” he hears her say as she passes him, so low Dean wonders if he was meant to hear it. “Cas was right, Anna’s right –” But then she’s off into the fray, Gothitelle trailing her silently, and he can’t hear her well any more.
Castiel just pulls Dean down on top of him, again, loving the thud of denim against bare hips. He grinds up – instinct again – and has to bite back a hiss, because he wasn’t expecting it to
“Anyone else there that we know?”
,” Benny says. “But the little guys here love Herdier. Buryin’ in her fur all the time.”
“What are you gonna do?”
Dean knows Sam hurts too. He knows he’s only trying to help. It’s just some days are better than others.
the coat.
Lucas cackles, his coiling snake body lunging right toward Cas’. But Latios is too fast for that – Latios and Latias didn’t get mistaken for jets for nothin’ – so he darts out of the way and slams into Lucas’ side. The body of Giratina has too much bulk for Cas’ attack to make much of an impact, but it’s something. It’s something.
, Dean.” He can
Talking with Bobby and Rufus is always a hoot in and of itself. Bobby’s got a Growlithe, and that gal’s up there in age like Bobby himself. By now, she’s half-blind, but still tough as hell. She’s got enough training to evolve into an Arcanine for sure, if either she or Bobby wanted it, but everyone in Dean’s life is too stubborn for their own good. She’s usually up there on the Skype screen yapping, while Rufus’ Avalugg appears content to rest in the background. Sometimes Growlithe gets right up on her back and goes skidding across the long, icy surface.
Getting Cas’ pants off is easy, even if he has to watch out to lift up the waistband of his underwear to avoid his erection. And then they’re both naked, totally naked, and Dean can drink in all that skin. He kisses down, down, down, stopping over neck and collarbone and nipple and bellybutton until he reaches his destination. As it turns, out, Cas tastes good everywhere.
“Tired of scrubbing up messes,” he grumbles, and to his surprise Vaporeon turns away from the window and nods at him. “Glad you agree, girl.”
“We mostly finished up here, but you can –” Dean starts, but Krissy drops the shovel and then she’s off. She takes the canister of gasoline, makes sure she steps back a couple of paces, and then tosses the rest of it onto the roof of the house. Flames bloom, and the roof collapses instantly.
, and that’s the thing that sticks to him.
At that, the corners of Cas’ mouth lift up. “You’re right on that.”
to lose that freakish control he always had and all but rattle out of his skin. Emmanuel stuffs his fingers into his mouth – it will be a poor substitution, but he can’t stop thinking about Dean’s bottom lip shiny with wetness – and startles at the salt taste of it.
“You alright?” Sam and his stupidly puppyish face, of course.
“What?”

with its multitude of bright neon displays highlighting big, drippy burritos while he tries to ignore that he hasn’t had a decent meal in a couple of days.
“Angels don’t need to eat. How different
Of course, that’s when Giratina re-appears, and slams Latios into the wall. Dean hears Cas’ broken
, and he doesn’t know if he would prefer to think of the good times or the bad.
Those lips find his nipple and Castiel is arching up, like it’ll get him closer and this feeling will ramp up. He can’t help the ragged noise that comes out of his mouth, and it would frighten him if he wasn’t so distracted by pure sensation, nestling its way into every vein and blood vessel.
“I know what you’ve done.”
Vaporeon’s doing a lot better than him at dodging the attacks, but they keep striking closer and closer. She’s gonna run out of room soon,
A weight lifts off Dean’s shoulders, one he didn’t even know he was carrying until that moment.
Honestly, having an angel boyfriend kind of rocks.
Dean sneaks out some of Sarah’s photos. Paschal’s in the oldest vessel he’s ever seen an angel occupy by far, a portly and pale man, face weighed down in wrinkles. He’s probably old enough to be
They end up inside the car so fast Dean wonders if Cas is using his mojo to cheat. He settles his back against Baby’s seats, pulls Cas on top of him, and pushes their mouths together.
. Dean knows that’s not a luxury, not even close, but after the life he’s had, he’s amazed he knows people now like Cas and Charlie and Benny, who seem to think the shit he says has value. Cas, though, he’s the one who’s there to hold Dean at night, who will take his hand when Dean can’t go on any more.
“Did you,” Dean says, just as mock-casually. Fuck the mini-bar. He’s walking over to Cas, now, and dropping to his knees for this time around. Toys are really fucking great, but so is his mouth, thank you very much. And so are angel boyfriends, even when they’re glossy-eyed with inhuman heat. Maybe especially so.
But fuck that. He can look down and see Cas flick his pink, pink tongue against his nipples a few more times. Until he moves away, soon enough, and Dean wants to whine about it – but then Cas is easing his boxers off his body and out the door.
“Jack wanted to see you,” Cas tells Sam, very seriously, once Sam’s released the two of them from his monster death-grip.
“Starly are, uh – they’re pretty common, right?”
Dean’s brow furrows. “You didn’t –”
It’s Dean’s turn to make breakfast. Privately, as much as he owes the Winchesters and Bobby so much for their hospitality, Castiel is glad they never reached his turn; he wouldn’t have known where to begin, and everyone would have left the table still hungry and cross with him.
Sam snorts, the noise that indicates one of them is totally talking out of their ass. “Good, cuz I actually haven’t.”
Dean pulls back, grins, and slides the little egg vibrator over Cas’ nipples. Normally, the angel’s not really into this; sure, he moans when Dean carefully sucks, sometimes nibbles, them into hardness, but if Dean spends too much time there he gets huffy and starts maneuvering Dean’s hands elsewhere. (He’s not subtle about it, and Dean gets a stupid little thrill every time Cas’ hands clamp down around his wrists to very pointedly
“But not this. I’d never stop you from this.” She pauses long enough to let the words sink in. “Does Sam know?”
He’s feeling pretty debauched, which helps to explain why he’s kissing along the cleft in Cas’ ass, eagerly. Dean’s own dick presses against the fabric of his underwear, the ring around it too hard, and fuck, just that is so so good, warm and smooth and tight and
in absurd squeaky voices. It’s disgustingly adorable, and Dean knows he’s smiling way too wide at the display in front of him. He’d be self-conscious about it, if he didn’t have the gut feeling that Cas wouldn’t judge him one bit for it. If Cas wasn’t standing right there next to him, smiling too.
Dean’s torn between loudly laughing, and letting his head fall to the table and never picking it up. “Why the hell not, right,” he says, with a sideways grin to Cas. “Call in the big gun.”
At that, Dean looks up for the first time since Sam came into the room. “I was expecting – you know –”
, there’s a waiting list for volunteers, and an excess of cash flow. They’re putting as much of it as they can to making the lives of the Pokemon better.
you or something. Like when he looks at you, it’s
and tight against his dick and he almost blows it right there, until a deep throb inside his rounded lips brings him right back to Cas. He should probably do something with his hands, pump Cas until he comes, but it’s too appealing to leave them right where they are, where he can feel every breath and heartbeat. The evenness of them, even now, is a corkscrew right to his gut.
Dean’s on his hands and knees over Cas’ body, which is pressed to his from throat to just above his cock. They grind together, and it’s supposed to be a relief but really, it just makes Dean harder and more frustrated. The throb of his dick against the ring slipped snug against his cock is getting pretty fucking unbearable, already. But this isn’t about him, this is about the body under him, a taut line of
“Probably not,” Cas concedes. “But he’s – what?” Cas must be distracted by the way Sam keeps looking at the two of them, mirth tinting the expression on his face.
“Not gonna admit that was a good point.” Dean swings the car door open, grabs the weaponry he’s stored in the trunk, and tromps into the house. He opens the door and it swings off the top hinge.
Kali, trailed by her Rapidash, stands up over Gabriel and works her fingers into Gabe’s short hair. It’s still a mess, but Dean figures it wouldn’t be very true to character if Gabriel suddenly showed up looking immaculate. “Sweetheart, they’re supposed to be the ones roasting
, but not bizarro shit that takes him out of the mood. Dean chuckles. “What?”
“Have I ever,” she practically sing-songs. Her voice drops a full register. “Look, Dean, there’s some serious crap going on there. I’m pretty damn good, and I can’t even begin to make a dent in the firewalls between regions.”
The days roll into weeks and months. Dean’s got friends now; Charlie drags him out to hang out with her and Gilda more weekends than not, and even if most of the time they just go along with Cas and Victor if he’s not busy to Benny’s diner and all split some cheese fries, it’s fun. Definitely way more normal than anything Dean’s ever known before.
Dean wakes up much later, because of course Sam is snoring. They’re still on the highway, zooming by a non-descript route. Right now, Dean’d take one of the awful desert routes that gunk up the car, because at least that’d be something to look at. There’s no sign of a city or town anywhere here, nothing remotely interesting, just another long, long road to another city with no answers for anyone.
could make that noise come out of Gabriel’s mouth, but for once, his fears are misplaced. A goddamn gorgeous Rapidash with an easy gait hustles up the hill. Other Pokemon attempt to attack him, but it’s futile; his fire mane whips out and smacks them away, and he continues up the hill, completely undeterred.
. Even at that age, Dean remembers thinking that apparently giving your kid a Pokemon when he was way underage was fine, but giving him any choice in the matter was
“Sweet talker.” But Dean obliges, takes Cas’ hands in his own and coats the fingers of one of his hands with lube. “Go slow. Been a while.”
Cas, pouring orange juice now, turns back to Dean. “It is.”
“Tell ‘em I said thanks,” Dean whispers, and they’re so close, pressed against each other, that he feels rather than sees Cas’ smile in return.
“Regrettably.” Cas may not be the touchy-feely type with the baby Pokemon at the nursery, not like Dean is. But if he grew up with that asshat Zachariah, it’s amazing he has any compassion at all, nevertheless the wells of it he draws from day in and day out. “He owns most of the foster homes here in Opelucid. Don’t you know, it’s a
Cas has put the Articuno figurine down. He’s currently examining one of the Jirachi Dean didn’t sell; this one’s plain wood, most of the paint peeled off. Something about the blank face on it creeped Dean out. Cas takes a moment to smile up at Dean, though. “You have plenty of that. The good stuff, as you say.”
This is the most Dean’s ever talked about prison. A lot more than he’s said about Hell in years. And he had to talk about it with Castiel.
“Firewalls?” Not that Dean didn’t suspect otherwise, but as far as he
. “I prefer to think of myself as ruggedly handsome,” he returns, the curve of his smile wide on his face.
“It’s appreciated,” Cas chimes in, all calm like Sam told them he’d be running down to the grocery store for milk. Dean hasn’t smiled this wide in — ever, he can feel it tugging down his ears and pulling his forehead taut, it
better. There’s no one here to even see this goddamn bravado, but he pushes on with it anyway. He’s never had a real good sense of self-preservation.
Emmanuel presses palm to thigh and calmly lets the warmth seep through. He knows what this is, even if he hasn’t experienced it very much. His plain gray pants push out obscenely in the front.
There’s another. And then another. The world goes pleasantly woozy before him. Or – not pleasant, no, not a whole lot’s pleasant now. The thought should sober him up, but it whips anger through him instead, so potent he can practically feel it crackling.

it up to his elbow, like plunging his arm into a sink full of warm water in the wintertime. Odd, but comforting to him too.
