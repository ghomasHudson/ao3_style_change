-Actually, it's in two phases: being sent on earth is quite easy if you annoy the Shadow enough. So, the correct question is: what or who awaken him?"
-I already read it while you slept, to pass the time. There is nothing more in this book than what we already know."
-“No, it's ok Sam. Dean thought Michael was back. I take care of him, you can go back to bed.” He hears Castiel tell someone, probably Sam if he understands well.
For tomorrow, he has to know every scene, every role, and plan every rehearsal in only four months. Castiel as his assistant is a very, very good idea because it seems to be impossible. And it’s only because Crowley decides that.
- "Still we should come with you", Sam keeps arguing. "If it's Lucifer, we need to be prepared, and we need to be together."
-"This isn't about Michael, but about Cas. And I need to keep myself busy.
- “No, it’s me. I wasn’t looking where I was going”, he adds, followed by a few seconds of silence during which the boy keeps on avoiding to meet his eyes, and the girl – Meg he guesses – is having a good time. “Huh, okay. See you later.”
He doesn’t say anything, but this silence is different from the one with his father. He sits on the chair on his desk and takes out the last homework he has to do. For sure, Meg hasn’t done it and that’s why he waited to be with her to do them.
Time flies and when the bell rings again, he is surprised.
His body is still tense, still marked by his lack of movement for several days.
Dean takes a few steps back, looking at Cas to be sure he’s okay. It must have been him who kissed him first because when Castiel returns to do so, he seems surer of himself. He leans Dean's head back slightly, grabs him by the waist and rests him on the worktop. Dean is a little bigger than Cas, but they barely notice it.
The alarm clock is still ringing and it almost takes all dean’s willingness to reach his arm out of the bed and turn it off. He vaguely hears something coming from the right side of the bed, and he can tell something – someone – is moving. Fuck. He doesn’t even remember getting led yesterday… if only he could guess the name right just not to be the douchebag. Instead of pushing his luck, he, as silently as possible, escapes from the bed.
-"Over here, Sammy!"
He knows he should not, but he puts that on his fatigue: he shoots Cas's hand and pushes him to come to him in the bed. Cas goes by and comes to lie down with Dean, over the sheets while Dean is below. He puts his head against Cas's shoulder, while Cas manages - at first uncertainly - to kiss Dean with his arm.
In his logic, Dean is right. Knowing what Castiel wants the most in the world would then make sure not to ask him. Until the deal is no longer relevant, of course.
-« Hey. »
-“Well, I had a lot of time to do it. I’m glad you like it.”
… and professor Winchester is just here, for him alone. Fine, if it’s a dream, then sure, the teacher is waiting for him because that’s what Castiel wants but… Can he do what he wants to do? It’s just a dream and no one will ever know except him and his conscience. Yet, he can’t imagine facing the man on Thursday, not after all the thoughts in his mind. And the temptation is so tantalizing. It’s like his legs are walking on their own free-will, and here he is, standing in front of the man, very breathless for the little things the teacher has done to him: in just an intense gaze, his legs open in such a suggestive way, the way he said his name, just a few seconds ago...
He hears faintly footsteps approaching him. Dean can only curl up on himself in the corner of his room. Even if he tries to shout and call Sam, Jack or Cas, no sound can come out of his mouth.
Nick? He did that? But how did he…?
Dean looks at his brother's. He doesn't even know how to convince him without revealing what he has just thought about. Because if Lucifer is back, maybe the Shadow is for something. Anyway, going to hunt Lucifer is the only chance he has for the moment to be able to contact this thing. And some time alone with Cas is not a surplus, even if Rowena's going to be there with them, she is there for security against Lucifer by being the most powerful witch, and more importantly, she's not Sam. Telling Sam his little secrets, Dean's not ready for that. He hasn't even told Cas about him, even if Cas isn't stupid.
- “Seriously?!
-« What would you like to do, you? », Dean asks
. As simple as that.
The first plan he thought about involve meeting the shadow, punch him or do anything that will break the deal. He is not sure it would work, but he is one of the Winchesters brothers, somehow, he will have something to deal with this shadow, one way or another.
-Well, I thought I know how to do it, but if you think I'm doing it badly, I guess that means I do not know."
He is halfway to his bedroom when Cas finally speaks.
Imagining the man leaning on him, stroking their cocks together. Feeling the weight of his body on him. Licking his lips and tongue, and kissing him until they are breathless. The pressure on his cock, the tension in his belly, all of this is perfect. Restraining his moans the best he can, he empties himself in his hand, not bothering to clean it up right after.
Dean walks over to the door to hear better over the noise of the toothbrushes that are moving. Dean stops, but Cas just goes slower, so Dean opens the door. It's Sam who just spoke, and the other voice comes from a woman he's never seen, but since Sam looks comfortable with her, she must be part of the AU hunters. Dean hasn't bothered to learn their names, but after looking at her, she vaguely tells him something.
it. And he would certainly not throw it all for a stupid student.”
Dean loves these little habits they have taken so quickly, and so, without a word, they go to bed. Dean switches the tv off while Cas does the same for the light.
- “How could I not remember her. Okay, so what’s the point?”, he answers, suspicious of what could come next.
- Tomorrow?! How am I even supposed to do that?
-"Don't go telling me you hadn't stolen any books or web information from them. I said in my message it's important.
A few lessons about poetry, just one about theater. Maybe this year, if Dean had a very concrete project about leading a piece of theater with a few students, it would be great. Crowley, the principals, had never said no, but he had never said yes neither. Just something along “don’t make me waste my time”. Now, maybe if Dean had a good plan, Crowley would agree… how naïve, dean thought. A few teachers were already there and he stopped each time to say a little hello – he hopes no one can tell about his state and his hangover. What a dumbass – and asks about their vacations. Beach, kids, and husband: the perfect trio for some teachers. It was funny to him that some of them were already his teachers when he was a student. It was not so long ago, but Sammy and he have stayed for what? Two years – three maybe – in town before leaving with their father. So here he is standing, in one of his old high school where the paint on the walls is peeling, where one in five tables is almost breaking, where the canteen is still so filthy.
This year, it’s a whole new program. Dean has spent a full month to choose texts to study for his five different classes. He even succeeded to get the right to spend two days with a class for whatever he wanted. Because yes: the ceiling of the gymnasium could well crumble, Crowley allowed each of the teachers to visit a museum, an exhibition, sports game with a class of their choice. He still has a month to think about it, also the idea to go see a piece of theater has been his main idea since he heard the news. But the thing is, Dean knows he’ll choose the class to go with, but the project will remain there. If his students want to go to the beach or even go shopping in a town, he would let them. Well obviously, he would find a way to do teachers-boring kinds of stuff as to visit a museum or something along with that, but later, he would give them free time.
- “Not thanking you either”, he replies to the man who is looking at him in the mirror.
Why the hell does he have a crush on this man?! Why couldn’t it be a classmate? Someone else? Someone less gorgeous and amazing… Either way, he is sure he is about to die because of his racing heart.
- “Take off your shirt for me, Cas”, Dean whispers in his ear.
-"You just said it: "If you annoy the Shadow enough"," Dean says with a triumphant smile, "someone must be really angry out there, and it's probably visiting earth right now.
Meg hasn't wait for him so he can take his time to say goodbye to his teacher, leaving the room but stopping halfway to look at the man walking towards his office. He must look like a pervert. Or a psychopath. Not that it would bother him that much considering he is already known as the "weird guy" because of how difficult it is for him to talk to people and befriend. But it's fine. He has Meg.
-“Yes”, Dean answers when he is completely out of breath, “in a minute.”
-"You received three messages during the night," Cas told him, still unmoved.
-Then do you happen to have Castiel's phone number?", Ketch jokes through the handset. "Or maybe he is not supposed to know?
-No, I think by doing that, you will just make them run away," Dean hears Sam says. "If we make a circle with Lebanon as a center, we're just going to push Michael's monsters to the borders and they can run away in another country and come back later. You have to put hunters on the borders and shrink the circle instead of enlarging it.”
Castiel turns his head towards Dean while smiling. Still half asleep, Dean gets closer to him to lie down with Cas, but he leaves his position to lie down too. Dean can’t help but smile and rest his head against Cas's shoulder. The position is not very comfortable but it's so good to be near Cas.
He grumbles. A ray of shine lights the other side of his room. It's already morning but he doesn't want to wake up. He wishes he could go back to this dream. Maybe next time, if he can tell it's a dream he can try to control it. If he’s already feeling this way by a dream only, then what would it look like to be with the real man? Oh no!
-You're right. But Heaven without you is not Heaven, understand?”, he says and immediately found Cas’ lips on his. “Cas, these days with you, it's unbelievable, but it's not enough. And for neither of us."
-That’s not –
It was obvious that Rowena would never spend the night in a shabby motel. After a six-hour drive in almost absolute silence, Rowena finally had a fit, got out of the car as soon as Dean parked, and dropped a "no way" while looking at the shabby hotel Dean has just picked. She let out a "See you tomorrow", took her bags and headed for another hotel. What Dean and Castiel - who had remained motionless in the Impala - looked at each other in silence, not knowing what to say.
- Well, you’re the mum, someone needs to be the dad. What does he want?
Some students nod, some look at others as if they can see through clothes, looking for bruises, and some are writing. Dean doesn’t know which behavior he prefers but at least, they are reacting to what he has just said.
- "It's not going to be very comfortable for you, this position," cases whispers in Dean's ear.
The day starts badly. First, because he burnt his lips with his usual morning coffee. Second, because there is no more hot water to talk a shower. And third, because he has an appointment with the principal, Mr. Crowley, so they can go on with the piece of theater project.
-Humans are supposed to go to Heaven, Dean!
- “So, what is your problem?”, Crowley asks, elbows on his desk and his chin on his joined hands. He seems to bored already and Dean hasn’t said a word yet. But well, if the man wants to play, they can be both at this game and Dean sure knows how to be a pain in the ass. But not too much so Crowley agrees to the project.
One hand grips his shoulder, while another holds his chin. This last hand forces Dean to raise his head, and when he opens his eyes, there is only Castiel in front of him. The bedside lamp is on. Dean makes his look across the room, but no, they are alone.
- That’s great”, she murmurs yet Castiel can tell this is just one part of her thoughts. She wants to say more. He raises his eyes to meet hers and she finally spits it out. “Clarence, is it related to the note you wrote on the first day?
-"Do you feel better?"
-Not worth it”, Dean interrupts Rowena. "The shadow will take care of it", he adds as he avoids looking at Cas.
-Do you want to sleep a little longer? It's only six in the morning after all."
-"It's dangerous, Dean", and Dean stops and turns to face him. "I trust you. If you have a plan or not, you know I'm always here, but Lucifer is Lucifer and we shouldn't underestimate him.
With these words, Dean puts both his hands flat on the table, determined, and begins to get up to go prepare his bag for his little trip.
-"No, all my life is not related to him. I'm looking for pieces of information about the Empty and the shadow, it's important, and I don't find anything for now in the library of the bunker.
”, he keeps thinking but it doesn’t work. She gets closer, trying to be seductive. That’s something that could work on him but there are too many things he can’t forget, with on top of the list Cas and Michael.
Case nods with a slight smile on the lips, which allows Dean to see that Cas has some toothpaste on the corner of his mouth. Unconsciously, Dean approaches his hand and begins to wipe. Cas' skin is soft. When he looks up, he finds those of Cas. Dean clears his throat and quickly passes his towel over Castiel's mouth.
He can't finish his sentence.
He opens the door of his office only to find out many other teachers are already in the room. And making loud noises that will prevent him from thinking. So it’s a no for this room. He goes back to the corridor, heading towards his class when he suddenly bumps into someone.
Sorry it took so long, my life is a Mess (TM) right now, but it's okay!
-"You can't eat or sleep, but - and correct me if I'm wrong - it seems to me that you can still do some small human things.
-"I need to contact the shadow of the empty to make a deal, that's why I need to be prepared for every eventuality. So, you investigate everything you have, and everyone who may have pieces of information about it, and you tell them to me. That's all I'm asking for.
-"Mornin' ", Dean manages to articulate still a little asleep.
Thank you for keeping on reading this fic ! :D
-How did you ...?”
When he comes back into the living room, Charlie welcomes him like he has won a battle, him alone against an army, which makes Dean smile. While coffee is getting a little bit less scalding, he hands Charlie a glass of water to take with the drug. Surely, his head will be better in an hour or so. It has to be.
-No, of course, but to help you go to the bathroom...? I mean, if you still have a little trouble walking...
Thanks for the kudos, you all!
do it, and second because he doesn’t know
-"He said you are fine, even if your physical and mental condition is not at its best yet. I guess it takes time, like every time.", he says before adding more quietly "We'll help you. "
He hears some of the girl's yearnings after him, almost immediately followed by mean looks by some boys of the class. A usual day, Dean would say. He is used to girl’s sigh – and sometimes, even some boys.
- “First, you take aspirin, second, shower, third, get dressed and then you can eat something before being the brilliant professor every student wish they had once in their lives”, Charlie enumerates, raising a finger at each new step. “Go shower while your coffee is still hot, I’ll make breakfast.
- “Shut up”, he answers with a sigh. “Not gonna fulfill your dream of the student in love with his teacher or something along with that.”
- “Okay, calm down everyone. Anna, whatever you want to write Is fine, even if it’s about cats. If you judge it’s something that I need to know, go for it”, he answers her and she seems to be happy with it because she starts to write down. He then looks at the boy, raising an eyebrow as a silent question to ask him his name. Ash. It’s a name he has never heard, probably a new student in Laurence. “Ash, don’t interrupt me if it’s to mock someone else. So next time you want to say something clever, don’t hesitate. If it’s for anything else, I think I can answer Anna alone, thank you. And finally, yes, me knowing if you are handicapped is a plus as I can adapt the exercises in class. If you write that but you tell me you don’t want other people to know, I will not tell, it will be a secret between you and me”, he adds with a wink he almost immediately regrets. But well, being sympathetic has never killed someone.
If he is honest with Cas, Dean would tell him he could walk alone now, thanks to Cas' grace. Physically and mentally, he feels good.
- Exactly.”
Dean is breathless and lost. What could he do, now? The Shadow’s in front of him, he is terrified because he underestimated it. Trap him, he remembers saying to Cas, of course, but how exactly.
-“You're free from the deal. But when you die, angel or human, you'll go to the Empty.
Thirty minutes later, he is in his father's car. They are not speaking, and the silence is almost suffocating. Each day after school, his father comes to take him from school, so he's making sure at the same time his son is working. There is no time to lose, he guesses.
They are the first two words that come to his mind. But he doesn’t know what he was thinking: Meg is his best friend, of course, she knew about his totally-secret-crush-on-a-certain-professor. And maybe she doesn’t know she is right on the first guess. Probably think it’s a joke.
She opens her mouth a few times, unsure about what to say, and she finally relaxes but Dean doesn’t understand why at first.
- “What’s so funny, exactly?
- Fine. I, with all my generosity, allow you three guesses.
- “… with a headache. This is sooooo great… I’m not thanking you for yesterday, dumbass”, he says through clenched teeth the last part of the sentence from the bathroom, thinking about Benny.
assistant.
- Milton. My name is Anna Milton, I have a question. What do you want us to write in it?
-"You could become human!"
He keeps walking towards his car, covered by Rowena’s questions:
Maybe not everything is as bad as he thought. At least, there is no mysterious hook up from last night. A phone on the nightstand buzzes next to Charlie, immediately followed by an intense light which causes pain to strike his head and eyes. He pokes his head in his hands in pain, cursing himself for having the stupid idea of celebrating Charlie's new job the day before school starts. So stupid. He looks like the student he was: A young novice; not a man of thirty who has to deal with teenagers.
Because of the light, he hears Charlie mumble and sees her hide in the bedsheets. It is not the first time he has slept with Charlie in the same bed, not after almost twenty years of friendship. The missing member of the crew is nowhere to be found, probably gone yesterday with a new conquest, or laying on the couch.
Dean nods contentedly. Now that he is feeling better - physically, but he would have plenty of time to be aware of his trauma when he would be alone - he could see the bottle of beer in front of him, followed by a hot plate of bacon.
Dean doesn't know who initiates the kiss, but suddenly his lips are found on those of Cas. But this time is different from the last one. Two days ago, Cas had just put his lips on Dean's, but now Dean is answering. It's fiery, almost brutal. Soon, Dean's tongue found the entrance to Cas' mouth. Dean's hands find Cas' hair and he clings to it desperately. He totally lost himself in this kiss, letting Castiel to press him against him, one of his hands resting on his hip, the other in the hollow of his loins. He deepens the kiss. It's so good to kiss him. His hands, his scent, his tongue. They end up moving away to breathe. They are both breathless.
It takes five more minutes to gather up the sheets which he puts on his desk to grab some others.
Castiel is still lost in his thoughts when the sound reaches his brain, his eyes trying to find his figure in the dark. Thanks to the sound of the sheets, Castiel can know Dean is trying to reach the lamp, and when the light fills the room, Dean seems lost for a few seconds. During this short pause, Castiel had walked to be next to Dean.
-And don't go telling me you have something else more important to do, I don't believe it.
CASTIEL: Library
Instead of answering him, Rowena shows him her phone open on an image precisely. When Sam sighs and runs his hand over his face to finally leave it on his mouth, Dean grabs Rowena's arm to see the famous picture. The photo is very poorly framed because Rowena had to hide behind a wall, but Nick is there, in the middle of the shopping center, all the shops around him are devastated and most importantly, his eyes are red, and he smirks. Okay, well, Nick with red eyes and an unleashing of the elements around him, indeed, it's a pretty obvious sign that Lucifer might be back.
Dean raises his eyes, meeting Missouri's ones. Of course she knows about it. He doesn't know how she can see so well through him. Like she can read him like an open book.
Michael had just pushed Dean deep in his mind.
-"Dean! I'm happy you awaken!", Jack says happily. "I couldn't wake you up, and neither could Cas. We worried a lot."
-"Dean whatever you’re doing, you should leave that to your brother. Focus on your health instead, there's no need to hurry."
Again, thanks for the kudos :D
-« Now you know. »
Now that he thinks about it, it's probably the reason why the teacher has chosen him... To make him feel include in the class. Maybe the teacher was even scared he would not be accepted in any group for the piece of theater. He feels thinking about it. Sure, a voice in his mind tells him it's because of - or thanks to - the note but how would the teacher even know he wrote it? There is no way. Absolutely no way.
It’s only when Cas appears in the room that she finally moves, running away from Dean’s room. Cas doesn’t care about her and slowly walk towards Dean. When he gets closer, he grabs the gun, puts it away in the nearest drawer, and hugs Dean who doesn’t stop shivering.
Dean enters the bathroom again, in which Cas is still waiting for him, and Dean cleans his mouth quickly.
Little by little, he falls asleep, vaguely aware of his own heartbeat, which is fastly beating in his body. He is convinced that Cas can feel it, and all the little details to make him understand that Dean does not want to reject him are good to give to Cas.
-Dean, we should go with you", Sam starts to argue.
-“I don’t know what that means, ‘spooning’...”, Cas whispers in Dean’s ear, and a thrill of pleasure runs through his body. “Either one of us will die tomorrow because we can't be happy together, or I’ll never dare do what I want because of the deal, so just this one time, I want you to fall asleep while you’re in my arms, Dean.”
When they arrive, Cas has already told them about the morbid story. Through newspapers and the internet, he learned that an 'unknown man' entered the house of a happy family overnight and destroyed everything in his path. The only question that Cas could not answer was "why?".
Because of his remark, the Shadow looks at Dean with more interest this time.
-"I'll go try to contact all the hunters around the world," Sam announces before heading back to the war room.
Castiel sighs. He guesses it's fine to answer if he is alone. And he is scared Meg could come into the library to interrupt him and make as much noise as she can.
Dean is certainly very tired, and if someone were to fall on him at that moment, that person would surely tell him to go to sleep, but as long as he can still understand what he is reading, he continues to study Castiel's case.
That time, the phone doesn't slip from his hands. No, Castiel prefers to put it down and never watch it again for the last ten minutes. This conversation is going where it shouldn't. Dean -
-“Thought you would never come to sleep”, she says while she stands up when she sees Dean.
-"I'm sorry for your loss, my dear."
Castiel is standing awkwardly at the foot of the bed, not sure what to do. Both are staring at each other, Castiel is visibly surprised and reassured to see Dean since ... since his little trip in his mind. Cas ends up pulling the office chair to sit next to Dean, still lying in bed.
Nothing has changed and it is pleasant, peaceful.
She sits next to Dean. There are so much love and happiness in her eyes when she looks at him. She grabs his hand which is not resting on the book he's reading.
-“It’s okay. It’s not him”, he starts whispering in Dean’s ear. “If he can feel me when I’m close to him, remember that I can feel him too. I would never let him get close to you again, Dean. You’re safe.”
MEG: I know you're there. Don't ignore me, Clarence.
Dean's eyes rest on the screen to discover that Cas is doing some research on the strange phenomena of the region. These events have been going on for four days now, and Cas opens a second webpage to show Dean on one side all the strange events listed and their consequences, and on the other side, on a map, he can see Lucifer's recent travels of a certain color, and another one that might correspond to Michael.
-"Are you sure you did kill Lucifer?", she asks.
- “You sat on his legs, hmm?” she asks, not entirely serious.
- “The class could do it. If we are together, it’s better, isn’t it?
- Which one?”, Anna asks.
He is trying his best not to scream. His parents must not know about his crush and his sexuality. His parents expect him to marry a good girl, have a lot of children, have good work… Going out with a boy is definitely not on the list, even though he is pan. Meg is the only one he comes out, never daring to say it to anyone else. He takes a deep breath.
- “No. He is a teacher and he will not lose his job because one of his students is having a crush on him”, he replies but now that he has started to speak, he can’t stop. “I mean have you seen him?! He is gorgeous and the guy knows it. All the girls from the class and even the teachers are at his feet. He likes his job. He
Dean looks at his phone to find that he has received three messages from Ketch. He could share the messages with Cas and thus keep him informed of the progress of his research. But on the other hand, sharing this with him if it's just bad news would not help their situation. He would read the messages later, and act according to what's inside.
Castiel could jump on it, tell her yes as a joke, and find something else but it’s already too late and Meg is looking weird at him.
- “Ah, Sammy being the dad, here.
Castiel suddenly turns his face to look at Meg like a deer caught in the light of a car.
- Which one?”, Crowley interrupts him.
So here they are: Dean sleeping in his bed, Castiel watching for him in the same room, and Sam and Jack doing some research on the library.
As far as he can see, and by the layout of the furniture of the bedroom, he can tell it is his room. At least, he plays at home. Good thing, he supposes. He needs to make her leave his apartment before he goes to work.
He doesn't want to go back home. He has an hour left to go to the library of the school to work by himself but he doesn't want to do his homework for now. His parents will probably get mad about him but then again, it would be no different than the other days. Whatever he does, his parents are never satisfied with him. And he is getting tired of it, tired of never reaching his parents' high expectations, and thus, always fail whatever he does.
Several questions turn in his head, and he must choose the one that will keep Cas with him, a question with a long answer, a question that can not be postponed.
-Dean...
In front of him, in the shadows of the now abandoned house, stands the mother whom they had earlier suspected of being Lucifer's new vessel. The whole family of this poor woman had been massacred, and now remains only her, possessed by the shadow of the Empty. She is covered in blood, her skull smashed open.
Lunch? It's already that late? He sighs and goes back to rest his head on the table. The coldness of the metal is helping to heal his headache.
Dean nods, and the stay like that until Dean falls asleep, rocked by the breath of Castiel which strokes his neck.
Dean smiles a little and passes the door. He closes it and makes sure not to shoot the bolt. He takes the few steps that separate him from the sink to look himself in the mirror. The reflection that presents itself in it is normal. As if nothing had happened. However, if he was not aware of what Michael had done to him in his first possession – as if he was constantly underwater and could not reach the surface – this time, he remembers his meeting with Castiel and Sam. And above all, this second possession has awakened all the buried memories of the first one. Every murder, even if it was only vampires, every moment of those months to be a prisoner of himself.
The idea looks completely stupid now that he says it out loud, but he guesses it's also because Cas makes no movement to catch the toothbrush.
Sure, Michael did terrible things while he possessed him, but everything he has done consisted of killing monsters - basically a hunter's job - and then improving them with his grace and blood. Michael had just had fun owning his body. It wasn't like Gadreel who killed Kevin while possessing Sam. It wasn't like Amara who had tortured Lucifer while he possessed Cas.
Sam gives him his most beautiful bitch face, usually reserved for Dean. He is almost jealous.
On site, the house is partially burned. The other half is a miracle and Dean praises that the roof would not fall on his head as he walks into the house. Rowena has gone to inspect the floor - what's left of the floor - and Cas has gone to ask questions to the neighborhoods because with his suit he was the only one who could pretend to be an FBI member, Dean having decided the day before not to take his suit.
He can feel tears coming so he shakes his head. There is no way he cries here, in the corridor of his school. He takes some of his books and rushes into the library. The place is empty, as usual. The librarian, Mrs. Hanscum, is there, everyone. She greets him - still as usual - and he takes place at his - usual - place, ready for an hour of work. Professor Garth, as he likes to be called by his first name, has given his students a lot of math homework but it doesn't bother Castiel. He is pretty good at math. He can't tell much in literature...
Dean notices that he has no idea of what Castiel would like to do if none of them wanted to keep being hunters. Sam wouldn’t get out of this life now that he has his little hunter army, but what about Cas?
Dean looks up to meet Castiel's. Caught in flagrante delicto. He quickly looks away and the first thing his eyes land is the door. Castiel must have opened it during the night because the light from the corridor flooded his room.
- Last time I saw you, you were with Professor D so tell me what he said, now.”
Or Dean is just imagining things and Castiel will be happy not to work with an old teacher. Even if he is just thirty... Dean's problem will then be about Castiel's note. If Castiel is his assistant, then they can have moments to bond and Dean can learn to know his student better. If he can't anymore, then guess he'll just improvise, and try his best not to talk about his life and his personal experiences. A young boy 16-year-old boy sure doesn't want to listen to a 30-year-old man harp on his life like a knows-it-all.
He hesitates to grab Dean’s cock, at first because he doesn’t know if he
-Are you a therapist? », Dean jokes, unsure if the smile he is attempting to do is more of a smile than a grimace.
No, everything is quiet, peaceful even.
He tries to act as if he doesn’t know what she is talking about but he can tell it’s because of his stupid smile since… since professor Winchester talked to him.
Three days since Cas had told him his secret in order not to let Dean do anything about it, and now he has messed up everything. He really has to find a plan to break his deal because Cas would die in two days if they keep going like this.
Dean does not want to imagine how much she would be annoying if she would discover them in this kind of situation.
Dean could only smile at this. What could a small troop of hunters do against the most powerful archangels? But he needs a little hope, so he does not contradict Castiel.
Cas presses his lips on him. Dean must use all his will not to kiss him back. Because to do it would mean to admit that his feelings are reciprocal and would make him die. Because not to do it possible to perpetuate the doubt, or worse to make Castiel believe that it is not reciprocal.
- “Mr. Winchester, it is a pleasure to meet you”, the mother says, shaking Dean’s hand vigorously.
-« How do you feel? How are you?
-It’s sad, but if we want to be sure you don’t die unexpectedly, don’t you think it’s better to tell us? »
-Yeah, well just tell me what you'll found."
Dean hands Cas his phone so he can read the messages.
To have a crush on his teacher… It sounds like the beginning of a very stupid story. But stupid doesn’t mean not romantic or not interesting, does it? And Castiel may be very credulous, he is not naïve enough to think the teacher could have something else in mind.
-"What happened?", Sam asks on the defensive.
Dean doesn't know if Cas has realized that he is awake, so he takes the opportunity to look at him. He can't help smiling. Castiel is in his bed. Dressed, sure, but in his bed. His real bed in his real bedroom.
- Oh, shut up, Anna! -Ash! And besides, no, I won’t force anyone, only passion, interest, and joy.”
The further he advances; the more traces and splashes of blood became numerous. And of course, he ends up discovering three big puddles of blood, and thus the place of the murder. Dean's hunter instinct wakes up immediately. On all the pictures he could see of the family, there were four: two parents and two children. Someone is worn missing and he really does not have the heart to kill a ghost that has just been slaughtered. He is not going to finish burning the house!
-“What are you doing here?”
-Fine. Why then?"
He doesn’t even remember having eaten his breakfast or taken the bus that he is already at school. It is full of people walking towards the entrance. Meg is nowhere to be seen and it’s even more strange because they always go to school together. Another thing is the bees. Hundreds of them are flying near the school when they are usually no one.
As soon as he is done, he pulled himself out of his sheets but turning to get out of bed, his head begins to spin. He waits a few seconds while Castiel’s hand had come to rest on his forearm as if to support him. Slowly, Dean gets up and helped by Cas for the first steps, he finally reaches the bathroom door.
Even if he knows he should defend himself, catch his gun under his pillow, or his knife in the drawer of his bedside table, he can’t help but throw himself out of bed. He only thinks of running away from him, but his legs do not hold him anymore and he falls to the ground.
- I don't want to hear about it", she replies. "How is your brother doing?
- By tomorrow, I want a paper of every scenes from every pieces of theater, every student and their role – actor or not.
he thinks while trying his best not to make eye contact with the woman he barely knows.
-"They could kill a lot of humans", Sam adds, "but they can also set themselves up in the world according to Michael's plans."
But Cas had caught his eye and hurried to put his fingers on his forehead. Immediately, his headache stopped, as well as the stiffness in his body. It was magical. He sighs with relief.
-« Tell me », Dean repeats for the last time.
- You”, she says like Castiel is supposed to understand this easy statement that doesn’t mean anything.
-"Movie tonight?", he asks Cas as he grabs his bath towel to dry his mouth.
-“What are you reading?”, Dean asks, his voice deep because of his falling asleep.
- “Homework… Can’t you see it?
-« Why is it different? Last time, this didn’t happen to me. »
He stands up, shaking Crowley’s hand and going back to his office, not even carrying about the couple waiting with Missouri until he hears Crowling’s greetings.
- “Oh, and Castiel, please tell us when Meg is coming”, she says before going back to what she was doing.
He goes back to his room to put his pajamas on and finds Cas with his phone in his hands.
Ah, that is expected from the man. Even if ‘demon’ would be better to describe him.
- “Lucky girl, I guess”, Charlie says behind him, as she walks through the room to fall on a chair. She is wearing one of Dean's shirt, used as a pajamas.
He feels something leaning against his upper back, a pressure of affection. It must be Sam, but when he looks up, he can’t see the door of the room closing. The panic has subsided, he can then be aware of the breath of Cas who comes to caress his ear. He manages to pull away from his embrace to avoid making any mistake, and he leans his head against the wall behind him.
Castiel is already getting up when Dean realizes it means he's going to be alone. And it's the opposite of what he wants. He doesn’t want to be alone, not after what he just came through.
- “Fine everyone. See you tomorrow. I’ll explain the plan for the year, the books to read and the oral presentation I want you to do for the rest of the class.”
A few questions wouldn't kill him. Right? He picks his phone from the front pocket of his jeans and sends a quick message:
- "Lisa may be nice, but maybe she is not the one for you."
I know it is not perfect but I'm doing my best !
But the few words will be forever in his mind.
-Why?"
-It doesn’t matter anymore. I made a deal with the shadow of the empty to save Jack. It… It has invaded Heaven to look for Jack as he’s half angel.
-« So… A bartender?
(See the end of the chapter for
But Castiel and Sam both succeeded and now, Michael was anywhere but in Dean’s body.
-You’re the Shadow.”
"After further research, the Empty is a dimension outside our world, like Purgatory. It is not possible to go back and forth between the two worlds either you want to enter or leave it."
While reading books, he hasn't found any information in order to summon it, nothing about its figure, nothing about its powers, and nothing about the Empty. Nothing at all, and it's hopeless.
-"Dean?", he hears himself called outside of the room.
-« We couldn’t leave you without protection in a hospital, so I was using my grace almost every hour, sometimes to try to wake you up. »
-“Yeah, well maybe.
-"So that... Uh...", he hesitates before saying, "What do you think of having your own toothbrush, and to wash regularly? It will not make you human, but at least you will have the illusion... What do you think?"
-“We should stop”, Castiel manages to say between two kisses.
, he can't help thinking, but doesn't think about it too much.
-« Don’t lock the door. Just in case. »
So when he opens the door and his eyes fall on his mother, he is shocked to be only welcomed by her with a polite smile. Instead, she walks toward her husband to ask him about his day. The house is normal. In the entrance – which is more a corridor than anything else – he can see the living door through the opened door on his right. In front of him is another door that leads to his father’s office. They are many photographs on the wall, most of them being about Naomi’s and Chuck’s wedding, and Michael's and Lucifer's many wins.
The boy looks at him with surprised eyes as if he is chocked that someone is talking to him. Or maybe Dean looks like a crazy man with all the thoughts going on his mind.
-"But you want to keep yourself busy to not think about what happened. It's a feeling I can understand and know well. What are you reading?", she finally asks.
-“You know that our favorite witch can come here whenever she wants, right? If she pops in here ...”
- "No, that's fine, and then you're not going to sit all night," Dean says before adding, "Anyway, it's unlikely I'll confuse you with Michael if you're with me, Michael would never come to my bed. "
MEG: CAAAAAASSSSTIEL
- “Charlie, thank god”, he sighs in relief.
-« I’ve healed you, so you will not have any after-effect. I did try for your mental health, but I guess it’s better if we talk first… If you want, of course.
- Yes”, Dean simply answers. If Crowley wants to interrupt him so bad, he’ll lose this game. Even if Dean looks like a child, he only looks at Crowley who seems to be either waiting for Dean to go on with his explanations, or he is thinking. And as he is not used to think, it must be complicated for the man.
Castiel doesn’t seem ready for this plan, but that's all they have for the moment. Dean gets up and goes to the shower while Cas recovers his computer. It’s still early, - 5:52 AM according to his phone –, and Rowena will certainly not delay contacting them to kill Lucifer once for all.
That nickname… He is about to die. Or to come in his pants, that wouldn’t be very different. For the second time, he has the name of his teacher on his lips when suddenly, hard knocks are coming from the door.
Dean nods, still brushing his teeth, which doesn't seem to bother anyone.
-I want it”, Cas whispers so weakly that Dean thinks he has not heard well. “I miss being human. Sleeping, eating, dreaming...
He is about to call for him when he is interrupted by Dean and
-Easy. Only three steps: step 1, we find it; step 2, we trap it; step 3, we kill it. See, easy. No more Shadow”.
He had thought that this little family gathering would be tense, but fortunately, no one asked him anything about what he came through. But Dean isn't stupid: he knows this is just a matter of time. They are just enjoying the moment. Jack tells him some feats of the AU hunters while he slept. Sam corrects him sometimes, which makes Dean smiles. Castiel doesn't say anything. He is certainly regretting having kissed Dean, which is something Dean can understand: he would never have dared to do the first step. It was taking the risk of breaking their friendship, and even though he knows it's only a matter of time, Cas knows nothing about it.
-« No, save it for later. I need a shower right now. »
Sam approaches the table to sit in front of Dean.
He leaves his phone in Castiel's hands until he gets up from his bed and turns on the light in his room. Then, he goes to his dresser to take some spare clothes before going back to Castiel who hasn't moved from the bed.
He feels Castiel's hand move from his chin to his other shoulder. It is at this moment that he realizes that he does not stop shaking and that Cas tries to stabilize and reassure him.
-Actually, it's more my brother's hunters”, Dean interrupts it.
Surprised to hear Castiel's voice so close to him - and his ear - he looks up, his eyes wide open. In another situation, the sound of his deep voice could have been very erotic - and would have led Dean's mind where he definitely should not go.
- "Castiel?"
The image bursts into his mind without warning. Cas that takes a shower with him, skin against skin, his hand that strolls on the body of Cas and vice versa, then his lips - no. No, no, no, no, and no. Stop. Do not think about it.
She immediately freezes, hands in the air. Dean can tell she looks a little afraid but she manages to look confident enough to avoid being overwhelmed by panic.
But right now, this family gathering is everything he needs: his family, them being happy, and bacon and booze.
-“I want to make a deal with you. "
Castiel starts to pull away but Dean holds him back to put him back as he was.
If Castiel, Sam, and Jack are busy finding Michael to kill him and get rid of him, Dean would have to find a way to save Castiel from his stupid deal.
He doesn’t remember walking towards his first lesson, only to be
Right now, Dean just wants to ask him if Crowley actually hates him. Or what he has done to Crowley.
-However, there were no signs, right? Sam?", Cas' asks Sam, unsure. “We studied every strange phenomenon, and nothing could tell that Lucifer was back…
Dean has not stopped looking at him, even though Castiel has continued to fix the tile in the bathroom. Dean could easily see that Castiel is not comfortable.
-"Well, we all know Jack wouldn't bring him back," and while Dean says, looking at Jack for confirmation, "so we have to see how it could have happened and if it's someone or something that has managed to resurrect him.
"There is no information about the Empty in the archives of the Men of Letters."
These lips. There are no words in the world to tell how much he wants to kiss them. And they are just here, right in front of him. Instinctively, he reaches for his face, and his fingers brush the man’s lips. So red, so… open. His other hand falls on his side, accidentally touching the professor’s left leg.
He makes sure not to make a sound as he pushes the door. There is a woman who is sitting on his bed, the same woman from this morning.
Sam stares at him for a few seconds, hesitating about what to tell to Dean, but the woman answer, so the woman does it for him.
Dean nods as a silent hello and an agreement for Crowley’s excuses. He looks at the clock. Their appointment has only last five minutes…
-« Is it possible for him to start again? What can or will happen next time?
She releases his hands to grab the book he was reading and reads the title of it.
- But-
By the end of the day, he has a nice stack of papers, all of them being the information about his students he will gladly read tonight. When he takes them to put them in his bag, a small piece of paper sticks out from the stack.
- “So, got the keys, do whatever you want, see you later”, he tells her as he exits his apartment.
MEG: Where are you?
- “Go on, Cas, touch mine”.
Dean finally turns his head towards Castiel.
Dean looks at his watch, already too late to stay in the school if he doesn’t want to be locked in it. So he puts all his things in his bag and walks towards with the promise to read the note when he is in peace at home.
However, at any time, Michael can teleport into the bunker and recover Dean. Or maybe not, maybe Sam and Cas have certainly handed the Enochian symbols to protect Dean and make the bunker impervious to all possible raids.
He says before he hangs up the phone. She closes the book that Dean was reading, and she was browsing while he was talking with Ketch.
- ...I’m ‘a whack you with a spoon!", Dean completes with a chuckle, yet scared she has read her mind once again. She used to say that to him whenever he wanted to do so during detention. "I was 16, that doesn't count.
Every morning, when he wakes up, Dean turns to Cas to make sure he's still here and he's fine. And every morning, Dean finds Cas busy reading, or on his phone, or watching shows on the internet. On the other hand, every night, Castiel is still waiting patiently and in the dark as Dean falls asleep. He has never said how much Cas' presence at his side reassures him. Maybe he should, but he supposes that Cas already knows it now.
He walks in the corridor, towards his locker. It is not far from the entrance so it's freezing. At least, his trench coat is keeping him warm, even a little. He opens his locker, finding in it books, books, and even more books. And three photographs. One of Meg and him, one of Gabe and him. The last one is a photograph taken by Gabe, a  long time ago.
Dean's body is burning, and his hands wander around wherever they can cling to Cas's body, his hair, his neck, his shoulders, his biceps, his chest, all he can reach with his hands. And Dean wants more.
- “Same here, Mrs Novak”, he answers before leaving the room when the parents come in to talk to Crowley in private.
Once he has finished, and anyway, he has nothing to vomit in his stomach, he sits down against the sink cabinet, and bends his head back and close his eyes.
-"It's time to get up, lazybones", Dean said with a smile on his lips at seeing Cas's puzzled look. "Come with me.
Dean’s mouth is completely dry, and he wishes he could have something to drink, but Castiel is not holding anything, and there is no bottle of water on the nightstand. Unconsciously, Dean raises one of his hand to catch a bottle. His movements are very slow as if he hadn’t moved for a long time.
The woman is still in the hall, staring at Dean and he is about to enter the bathroom to clean his mouth but before, he asks:
- "Don’t think about it, Castiel!”, he tells himself, while rubbing his face.
- "Dean!"
- Jo could tell you precisely the date of his birth, the year and in which hospital he was born. Not joking.”
With his photocopies ready, Dean sets off towards the first class of his day. He likes his room. Probably because it feels like home, and looks like his apartment. Film posters on the walls, a small bookshelf on the right side of his desk and nice curtains.
-I’m the one who lies professionally, Cas. You can't-fool me.
Dean nods. Okay, this is unexpected.
- It’s your class, professor. I am sure you will find a way”, he adds with a smirk. “Besides, the show will happen during our opening day. Parents will be happy to watch it, don’t you think?
- “Fine”, Dean replies after a second.
His two next classes allow him to talk about the program as he already decided not to talk about his project of a piece of theater to focus on his lessons. It is already time for lunch when all his students leave his class.
Castiel nods but doesn't move for a second. And when he finally does, Dean would bet it's because Meg pushed her friend in the back rather than Castiel moving on his free will. Meg leaves them without looking at his friend, but Dean can tell she is smirking.
- “Now, let’s talk about literature. I am giving you out the plan of the lessons for the year. Ah! Now that I think of it”, he stops in the middle of the class, studying each face as he keeps talking. “I want to do a new project in high school and it’s a piece of theater (he hears a slight revolt in the class). Yes, I know, I said piece of theater, but thanks to my lessons, you will quickly be enjoying it. I am looking forward to your ideas and volunteers.
-Don't worry, Dean Winchester," she begins to say, "I do not come for the angel Castiel, even though I have often been close to come and take it," she adds with a smirk which makes Dean's heart beating faster because of the realization.
- is a teacher. Castiel is perfectly aware that such gossips could cost him his whole career. Especially in such a little town.
In the end, Sam gave him a very good idea: to do different scenes from different works so every student can separate into groups of work and thus, to choose what they want to play. An easy way to make his students take part in the project.
-"Michael's mutant monsters", she announced gravely, "we must kill them. Quickly."
-« Tell me what happened, Cas. »
Dean can't help but smile, which makes Cas frown.
-"So, I'm going", he says before turning on his heels.
Great. He looks for Ketch's phone number and calls him directly, he is not going to get rid of him so easily. Fortunately for Ketch, he answers from the first ring, because Dean is completely ready to harass him until he's dead or he helped Dean with what he knows.
Dean knows there is something wrong. This is it, a layer of a nightmare on another layer of a nightmare. It’s like a vicious circle where neither of them – Dean, Sam, and Cas – can’t be happy. Jack is still too innocent and hopeful to feel it.
Dean almost chocks while hearing this. « All your physical and humans need ». Great. Whatever that means is nothing Dean would enjoy to know.
-I know, but I think it's between us right now", Dean confesses. "Look, Rowena will take care of our backs. Jack didn't bring him back, he said it, and no one other than him has power over the Empty, so question: what brought him back on earth from eternal sleep?
- Hi Missouri", he replies as he hugs her.
Before anyone could come out with an idea, he plans everything before they could argue.
He doesn’t know if his students like it but when he is supposed to spend a whole day in the same room, he feels better watching his Pulp Fiction poster or having his “best brother of the world” cup on his bookshelf. He sits on his desk, waiting for the kids to come in. While waiting for them, he looks at the list of names. He recognizes some but is also pleased to meet new ones.
- "If you want to study or anything else, there is no problem", Dean says to Castiel. "But I would enjoy your company as my assistant for the "piece of theater project", if you don't mind."
Dean sighs and grabs his phone again as he sits up on the bed, and he opens the messages that Ketch sent him.
What the hell “you” is supposed to mean, anyway?!
He feels the bile up in his throat, and before he knows it, he is kneeling on the toilet and vomiting. It burns his throat, but the physical pain is much more tolerable than the psychological one. He wants to forget everything. He has to forget everything.
It's only forty minutes later that he receives a new message. It's probably Meg waiting for him. For sure, she is trying to distract him. However, his phone doesn't seem to stop from making light to have Castiel's full attention. He takes his phone out of his pocket, trying to stay quiet but it's not like he will disturb someone in the empty room. Even Mrs. Hanscum is out, probably eating a donut in the cafeteria with another teacher - maybe even M. Winchester. He has seen them once, by chance.
Dean straightens himself up and leans against the bedboard.
He spent Wednesday with his brother, trying to figure out which piece is better, and easier to do. If he gets to motivate his students, they can do something well; but the opposite is also correct if they don't want to do it and then... Dean is not sure he wants to see it.
can think of. And among them is kissing, flirting, touching… So no.
This is not the kiss he wished he would share with Cas. It’s chaste and it’s quick, while he wished he could have a lot of wet kisses with him. The kind that takes you to the bedroom, the kind that is just the announcement of a passionate night.
He looks at Rowena to be sure she gives him her approval. If she’s as terrified as before to face Lucifer – as Dean is with the idea to face Michael –, he wouldn’t insist to take her with him and Cas.
- "I'm coming for the Archangel Lucifer. He was not supposed to wake up and this time, and I certainly can’t leave that you and your hunters, can I? But you -
He doesn’t know how long he has been in that position, but when he opens his eyes again, Castiel is at his side, shoulder to shoulder because of the smallness of the furniture.
- … no.”
When he raises his head, he makes eye contact with his mother immediately. She looks younger, probably thanks to her happy relationship with Bobby. As Dean hasn't heard the door of the bunker making its usual sound, he guesses she is coming from the garage. Bobby must have come with her and is now looking for Sam and Jack and Castiel while Mary wants to talk with him.
Just when he says that to his mother, his phone starts to ring. At least Ketch is fast to answer.
- “At the end of this, you’ll see an empty case. If there is something I need to know about you, please feel free to write it down so I know about it. I won’t judge you for whatever you write and… Yes, Mrs…?
MEG: Too bad.
- "Dean", she welcomes him by opening the door so he can enter. "It's a pleasure to see you after such a long time.
-"Okay. Fine. Sam will stay here with Jack to keep going with the hunters to plan to kill Michael and his monsters. I go with Cas and Rowena to look for Lucifer.”
-Well, Samuel, you were wrong", Rowena interrupts him.
Dean is lying on his bed, the sheets covering his body. He only has to turn his head on the left to discover Castiel's body by his side. He has his eyes closed as if he is sleeping - if Dean forgets the fact that Cas is not moving above the sheets and that makes him look more like a corpse than a living being. Dean lets the panic invade him for two seconds before realizing that the bust of Cas moves. Maybe we should lend him pajamas for next time if next time there is.
Dean draws up a mental list of things that they must deal with. Michael. Lucifer. Castiel's deal. And the mutant monsters. And each time, he could kill two birds with the one stone. If he's working on Lucifer's case, he would probably work on the case of the Empty at the same time. Same for Michael and his monsters.
-« You fell asleep. I allowed myself to enter, as I did not hear the water flowing. Everything is fine? »
Dean sighs and stands up. He'll take a shower before going to sleep. Mary smiles to him, and before leaving the library, he drops a kiss on his mother's forehead, he grabs his beer and the book he was reading. It would be useful if he was suffering from insomnia tonight.
- He is fine. A good lawyer. Eileen is pregnant so wait a few month and he's gonna be best dad ever", he adds, his voice lost as if on a dream.
But hey, it's too late now. He knocks at the door, waiting to hear a voice from the other side. A few seconds later, the door opens on a woman. Missouri Moseley, Crowley's secretary. She was already there when Crowley took the place of the last principal, and even when Dean was a mere teenager. Needless to say that he spent a lot of time with her in detention. He remembers doing his homework or drawing stupid things while she was calling his father and then taking care of many things.
- “Strange”, the Shadow says as it walks closer to Dean, “you don’t seem to know about it. Then let me tell you. Nick prayed to Lucifer because he was so desperate without him, which bring him back.
MEG: I'm sure he wouldn't mind...
Dean rolls his eyes to heaven and prepares two cups of coffee. His head is getting even more painful by the time and it will be worse with the light. He escapes into the bathroom and picks the whole aspirin box.
- I don’t want to talk about it.
MEG: Where are you?
-Is it related to Michael?", Ketch interrupts him which makes Dean angrier.
-“The Shadow? Of the Empty? So, we can just ... Start again? Like nothing ever happened?
-"You don’t belong to the empty if you’re no more an angel, Cas.
-"And you asked why I didn't tell you anything?", he asks before answering his own question. "Because we're screwed."
-Shut up. »
A quick shower and wearing clothes instead of his old pajamas is far better. Moreover, the aspirin is working and he thanks God for creating such a miracle as this saving-life drug. He jumps when he hears knocks on the door. Charlie. He had forgotten that Charlie was waiting for him in the living room.
That little sound makes Cas laugh. And even if he doesn’t laugh long, Dean takes the time to admire him. Because – oh God – is he wonderful! He stares at him, at his lips. He could kiss him right now but at what cost? But looking up, he meets Cas' eyes. ‘When he is most happy?’ doesn’t mean kissing, right? They could do so much more than just kissing, and this could make Cas truly happy. Much happier with more than just kisses.
Dean turns quickly and too quickly given the pain he feels in his neck by moving his head towards Cas.
-I’m not really scared it ever happens, Dean. No need to tell you. »
He finds himself always absorbed in the contemplation of Cas's lips.
- “I hate your phone”, he says through clenched teeth. “For fuck’s sake, how am I supposed to go to class like this.” He achieves to walk towards the living room. No one is here. Not even benny on the couch.
When his eyes fall on the boy, he stops. Black messy hair, and very bright blue eyes. Of course.
When he wakes up, Dean knows it is about to be a long, long day. He is almost 30 and it’s not his first rodeo, yet today, everything seems… blurry. And, yeah, okay, it is probably because of his hangover but, for his defense, it was unexpected. Well, the hangover was predictable, all right… but not the little party Charlie has organized.
-That's it”, he simply confirms. "Cas, are you coming? "
Dean remembers perfectly the path it takes to get to his office, even after a few weeks without classes. There have been lessons during summer, yet nothing dean has really been invested in.
- The opening day in four months…
He can see and feel Castiel moving by his side. Alright, so he has gone too far, and now Cas will leave. He sighs with disappointment, but the moment he thinks Cas is straightening himself up to stand up, Cas is actually kneeling in front of Dean. And his face is getting closer to Dean’s. It’s slow, too slow for their mouth to meet, too slow compared to how fast Dean’s heart is beating in his chest.
And Dean knows that if he can't find any information by reading books, his best solution is to ask Cas about it.
Dean opens his eyes wide and says :
They remain silent the time Dean texts his brother back, wishing him a good day at work. That’s when Dean sees it’s time for him to go.
-« You shouldn’t drink that. It’s too early in the morning and you just wake up. I’ll pick you a drink of water if you want. »
The coldness and shape of the glass are familiar to him, but before he manages to get the bottle down to drink at the neck, Castiel is faster and catches the other bottle of Whisky that lies half full next door - which is also, unfortunately, the only other in his room.
He hears a few “hello professor” and some students come to talk to him. It’s nice, he thinks, to be able to talk to them so freely since day one. When the bell rings the class is full of faces. People talking to their friends or making new ones, people hiding in the back of the class and even student already ready to note everything he is about to say. All of this makes him smile.
to call a teacher by his first name but considering the situation they are in…
They have to stop to laugh, almost choking on their food or coffee. Now it’s Dean’s belly’s turn to ache with pain. It takes a few seconds for him to reach his phone, having a new message incoming.
- “As we are going to be together for the rest of the year, I prepared you a sheet of paper which you will happily complete”, he says while giving them out. “Name, date of birth, favorite book and author, info about you, etc. It is for me to know you better.”
Castiel hands him a cup of coffee. It is lukewarm, not quite hot, but not cold either. Anyway, Dean is not going to be choosy. He takes a long sip and finally asks the question that obsessed him the most. It’s reassuring to have Cas near him. He’ll go to see his brother as soon as he feels a little better. There is no point in playing comedy in front of Cas when he can see perfectly through Dean each time.
- Well… You know I had a “thing” for her. And she had a “thing” for you.
Right now, Dean is still sleeping, recovering from the possession. Castiel is sitting on the couch in Dean’s room in order to keep an eye on him while he is resting. It’s been a week now that Dean is sleeping, and never waking up. Sam thought about letting Dean in the hands of doctors and nurses, but if they actually did it, Castiel couldn’t do what he was doing right now. No one would have allowed him to stay while being on the hospital, all day long.
-Coffee would be a good idea. Something to eat too. »
-Do you want me to help you?"
-"Who are you texting?", he hears a voice asking.
- “Not one of your chicks, dumbass”, he hears coming from the bed.
He hasn’t noticed the man is this close to him. Dean’s other hand reaches for the bulge in his pants, slowly stroking him through the pair of jeans. Castiel is sure the pleasure could be a lot more if he could lose the pants or anything else. Anything to have Dean touching him.
Send me everything you find.

-“I prefer to be here”, she finally says when she realizes that Dean is waiting for an answer, which surprises her. “Just to be sure you don’t fail again.
But Dean can’t help smiling, and neither can Cas. Becoming a bartender, why not? He did his job by hunting supernatural creatures and by saving the world from many apocalypses. He died a lot by doing this, and Sammy too. Maybe it is time to stop. Maybe it’s time to let younger hunter shine. And he is not old, a lot of people change their jobs. Why not him? He would totally enjoy being on. Maybe even working with Cas…?
Even if he wants to make himself breakfast, he must stop by a chair in the war room to rest.
Guess the note is the final warning before he totally drowns...
He likes these words. They roll on his tongue like sweets. Well, it surely would if he could say them aloud, but guess his mind is well enough for now.
When Dean comes out of the home, Rowena is already outside, talking with Castiel. They both look at him as he walks closer, and he tries his best not to look guilty.
She takes her phone from her coat pocket and opens it on the photo application before handing it to Sam, who widens his eyes as he sees the images.
Finally, Cas catches the toothbrush and he smiles at Dean. Dean turns to grab his own toothbrush, and when he returns to Cas, he just has time to intercept the tube of toothpaste before Cas pours toothpaste directly into his mouth.
Castiel takes his shoes off, the same goes for his trench coat, ready to go upstairs and reach his bedroom when he is interrupted by his mother.
- But he was like what? fifty-five? Sixty maybe?
- “You, and that attitude of yours. Come on, don’t pretend like you’re not happy about it. It’s not like you’ve been secretly staring at him since you moved in Lawrence. So what did he do?”
It’s hard for Dean to tell if Cas is happy or not. He must be though, at least Dean’s hopping.
-I did it with my grace. I haven’t really fed you, but I used it to overcome all your physical and human needs. »
-« There is no shame to have, you know. Whatever it is.
-"About what?", Dean finally asks, interrupting their conversation.
- “Actually no”, he whispers to himself before going back to Castiel. “Do you have a lesson right now?”
For God’s sack… How much he wants this man… He shouldn’t yet it feels so good… Maybe if he’s lucky and waits for two years, until he turns 18 and is no more his student, and if the teacher is – hopefully – gay or bi… But it takes a lot of luck, and if Castiel is sure of one thing, it’s that he has never been lucky.
Dean stops talking for a drink of his third beer of the day. Sam and Cas hid all the alcohol in the bunker - even the hiding places he thought he was the only one to know - and he finds himself hydrated with beer. He has to choose his words with Ketch. He does not need to know all the details of the deal, just the necessary.
-"Yeah. I’m sorry, Cas."
She lets out a smile and starts walking to follow Sam who has already disappeared. Strange.
He perfectly remembers the moment when his brother had stepped into his room, opened the window despite the cold of winter, and took out his camera from his bag. Castiel had said nothing, just watched him silently as ever. He took a photo of the sunset, snow covering the trees and grass. Then, he smiled and went out. The scene had just happened in a minute but it felt like a pause in Castiel's whole existence. But like his family used to say, "Gabriel is Castiel's hero". At least, he "was" for them. Now, even if Gabe is dead and he lost the only person who truly cared about him, he is still Castiel's own hero.
Maybe he is going a little too far, and maybe he has to stop asking such embarrassing questions to Castiel. After all, sentimental conversations are not their forte. In fact, it’s not Dean’s, Castiel is doing pretty well, at least with Jack. But he thinks he is so close for Castiel to tell him…
-“And I got one. From Ketch.”
Castiel is the first to come off and steps back to prevent them from starting again. They are both lost in the other's eyes and finally, they seem to have resumed normal breathing.
- “Remember that girl… Jo Harvell?”, Charlie asks out of the blue while they are eating the pancakes she has just cooked.
At best, Crowley agrees and they can show their play at the end of the year, maybe in the gymnasium, with some guests, and families, and friends. In the worst case, however, Crowley is a dick and the project is wiped out before it even starts. This is even worse somehow because he has already chosen his assistant and he would have to tell him. Or maybe Castiel won't even be disappointed... After all, he was very suspicious of Dean's idea, but also quite happy about it. Dean can't tell exactly.
Michael!
He needs to think quickly. Or to call his brother. He has always been better at him for that kind of things. Dean is more the shoot then talk type of guy. That doesn’t mean it’s impossible for him to plan everything, but it would be easier for Sam…
- “No, he is going to go to the library to study as if he needs to. He is totally free”, Meg answers before Castiel can say anything.
-"Nick fled months ago. He can be wherever he wants", Sam says without being really convinced. "I mean seeing him doesn't mean it's Lucifer."
Dean looks completely lost. He remembers what has happened to him. He remembers of Castiel and of Sam while he was a prisoner of Michael. But all of a sudden, Dean has flashbacks of an event that happened several years ago. When he had seen Raphael’s vessel. Okay, maybe after the first possession, Dean did collapse on the floor; and maybe yes, he fainted for a moment on the concrete. So Dean deduced that he was at the second level: coma. Not for a long time, of course, but if he believed what Castiel had just said to him, then he had been for days in a constant vegetative state, he just slept for a week. Level three would look like Raphael's vessel. And the game would be over for him.
Dean nods. The crisis has passed. His breath is still a little erratic, but much less than earlier. If he had thought a little more, he could have understood that it could only be Castiel. And even if Michael were to invade the bunker, Castiel would have felt him approaching and intervened.
Dean teaches him how to do, which is strange because Cas has been on Earth for a very long time, has the body of an adult, but also because he wasn't alone when he was human. Okay, Dean wasn't perfect - far from it - but Cas had been with other people when he was human and no one had helped him and correctly learned him how to brush his teeth... If it's not guilt he feels, Dean does not know what it is.
- “Clarence, tell me!
- Don’t say that, it makes me want to spend more nights with you, you know”, he jokes but still obeys Charlie.
- “Shakespeare was one of the first answer, they also –
CASTIEL: You're supposed to learn them at school.
-"You will shower tonight, I will also lend you pajamas if you want ... it will not change anything, but it will at least give the illusion."
It's important. »
He walks on a few steps before stopping once again in the corridor.
When he arrives at school, everything is quiet, hopefully. Why the fuck did he got drunk the night before the first day of school ?! dean would admit it, it was totally his kind of behavior, but more in the middle of the year. Or the day before an exam so he doesn’t have to talk a lot and just wait for students to do their stuff. But the first day of school was a first.
- “I want to do a piece of theater with one of my class. Different scenes from different pieces of theater, to be more precise. And –
He turns on his feet to look at her. Looks great, maybe one participant of whatever the piece would be.
Two weeks have passed when the door of the Bunker make his usual grinding. Dean can feel Jack’s look rest on him while he, Sam and Cas all look at the door. Dean is about to stand up and catch the gun under the table of the war room, but Cas hold him back by putting his hand on his shoulder. They barely exchange a glance before Dean’s eyes looks back at the door. The red-head woman has already crossed halfway down the stairs when Sam stands up to greet her.
-With the shower?", he says in his most seductive voice without really paying attention, but when he realizes it, he just has the time to see Castiel blush a little and turn his head to look at the ceiling instead of him.
-Yeah, right. Well, your face is telling me otherwise. »
Dean is not stupid enough to really answer it. If she asks the question, it's because something very bad happened. And of course, it's linked to Lucifer. It's almost demoralizing how, even if he’s dead, he can be a pain in the ass.
They remain silent for a while. He can't even confront a mere archangel, what could he do against an entity older than God? There were things in the universe that could not be changed, even for the Winchester brothers. As long as he is an angel, Castiel would be doomed to go there. And Dean could not do anything about it.
-"A problem?"
While saying all this, Jack had reached the fridge and had picked up four beers to bring them to the table. Without thinking about it, Jack takes place next to Sam's chosen chair.
-"Better?", Cas asks.
-"No, we will demarcate a circle bigger and bigger”, says a feminine voice. “We need to be organized if we want to get rid of them faster and better.
-“You should have told me”, Cas blames him.
He needs to think about the different scenes so every student can choose a role. Yes, that’s what he has to do. He also needs to take care of every other important roles such as the costume designer, a stage manager and on and on.
I'm doing my best, hope you enjoy it :D
-"It seems that they both have found each other", she announces dramatically.
Castiel, who has only done a few steps then, turns slowly to take the time to choose his words. He has to choose what to say in case Dean does not remember everything that had happened. He opened his mouth, closed it, and finally said :
She raises an eyebrow, daring him silently to lie to her one more time. So he simply nods and hears her laugh. He doesn’t what she has in mind but it’s definitely very far from what
-« I will not judge you, you know it », Dean softly adds.
Shakespeare is the first name he hears from an unknown voice but before he can react, grimaces are seen and revolts are heard. Someone talks about writing a piece about Woolf and most of the girls agree. At the end of the little discussion, many ideas are presented – Dean wrote all of them on the blackboard – but no one seems to agree on one precise idea.
So why can't he stop hoping?
- “Fuck”, he spits it out without thinking and then he realizes. “Huh, sorry… I meant… Oh fuck it –“
Dean opened his eyes, not realizing he had closed them, and only saw Castiel's body walk out of the bathroom door.
-“You as an angel, it's not all of you. It’s only a part of you. I would be very happy to help you if you needed it.
-"I think I'm fine. I mean, Michael is out which is good enough for me right now. But..."
-« I’m waiting for you here unless you want me to go get you something to eat while waiting?
- “Ah, professor Winchester”, he hears someone coming from the right side call for him. Crowley.
They haven’t lost this habit, but compared to two weeks ago, Cas has gradually left the top sheets to lie with Dean under them. None of them had any inappropriate gestures, even if sometimes one of them could catch the eyes of the other looking at him, or their lips.
Mary gently caresses Dean's cheek before laying the palm on it. The gesture is reassuring. He knows she's right, after all, they have no more weapons to beat him, and Jack does not have as much power anymore. They can't face him anymore, all they can do against him is kill all the mutant monsters he leaves behind him.
to do it. It’s not like he has ever touched someone else so intimately.
As usual, I hope you like this new (and very short) chapter :D
I'm so proud I did it, and I'm even more proud you read my fic so thank you so much!!!!
-« Michael possessed you again. But this time, he didn’t just leave your body, he… You’ve slept for a week. Huh… you must be starving. »
MEG: Need your help with homework.
Winchester’s assistant. Professor Winchester’s assistant.
It sure isn’t Dean’s fantasy to do whatever sexual stuff to a minor, and it has never been. And even if he is used to being the center of the gossips at school – such as who he would date, how does he kiss or even his favorite position during sex and other very interesting questions about his private life – why on earth would a sixteen teenager be interested in having sex with someone as old as him. Deep down, Dean knows some of his students may be crushing over him: the insistent looks, the little messages, the way-too-tiny skirts or dresses. But it is only a fantasy. A one-lifetime hookup the girl or boy will be glad to live and tell, and for Dean, a very good vacation in jail-land. No, thank you. No cute smile could do that to Dean.
Except for tonight, Dean can feel Castiel's body moving under the sheets and snuggling up against Dean, his chest against Dean's back. He manages to put his arms around his waist to take him in his arms and puts the tip of his nose against his neck.
As promised, he took a quick shower. He doesn't have specific ideas of what he's going to do today, but it'll probably be research and long discussions with Cas about the Empty, and with Sam about Michael and the other hunters. But while showering, a new idea burst in his mind.
Dean bites his lips. Of course, if he didn't need Cas to stay with him every night, he could take care of doing something else, whatever it is. Cas is really becoming a good hunter. After saying that, he closes the computer, comes with one hand to slide it on the floor and turns fully to Dean.
But it’s not Lucifer… This one looks…Scarier? Crazier, maybe? If it’s not Lucifer who did this, maybe the woman went crazy and killed her family…?
-There are a lot of rooms, we would hear her knocking and screaming on each door”, he jokes but then, he seems to be lost in his thoughts. He finally asks, serious again: “What's the plan?
If Missouri says someone is really made for him, she better show up very soon.
Okay. Castiel is about to leave again. Why is he still leaving? Couldn’t he just stay !? So he has been there for a week, watching over him – which was strange, but also very hopeful – but now that Dean was awake, he was just leaving? Oh no, not that way, he would eat and drink later.
Well, Lisa was a first too… No! Stop! Don’t think about it, Winchester. Lisa’s gone, end of the story.
And it's useless. For now, all he has found is this sentence declined according to the book, but which can be summed up by: "The Shadow is the guardian of the Empty. Demons and Angels only go to the Empty. No one has ever come back from there." Final point. Which absolutely does not help his problem. Well actually, it’s their problem.
It is at the end of the living room, in the corridor that leads to the kitchen that he hears a noise. The kind of noise he's not supposed to hear if he's alone. He takes out his weapon. They may be just curious people who have nothing to do there.
Dean raises his head to nod. Time... What a stupid way to say you can't do anything!
MEG: I want to be damned in Hell if I don't comment how Cumberbatch is sexy each time I see him.
He drops his phone. Well, it's more like the phone slips from his hands, but the result is the same. He doesn't take his phone for a few seconds, making sure no one is behind him, overlooking his shoulders. His heart is beating too quickly and is the proof of his guilt of having such thoughts and being so transparent about it to his best friend.
And it's finally the last chapter!

- "He is busy right now, come sit down next to me", she says while going back to her desk. Her smile disappear and she suddenly seems to be very serious when she adds: "Boy, you put your foot on my coffee table -
-"No, we're just checking if this is true", he says while avoiding Rowena's gaze and immediately feels the need to justify himself, "Rowena is coming with us to prevent any problems from him. Maybe he is not so powerful, maybe he is full power. Anyway, with Rowena's powers, we'll be able to bring him back more easily."
-"Wow! No, no, Cas, Cas, what are you doing?", he says as Cas interrupts his incredulous gesture, then Dean understands. "You don't know how to brush your teeth, are you?
Fatigue is regaining Dean. Even if he is hungry - and still thirsty -, he would quickly go through the kitchen to take stocks. For now, he is too much tired. And it’s nice to be able to talk to Cas while being so close.
- “Well that, Anna, is one of the many questions we need to answer (he says as he rubs his hands with impatience). Does anyone has an idea about a play we could do?”
He looks at his reflection in the mirror. Single, thirty and a hangover like he’s a fucking teenager. Dean Winchester in all his glory.
They look like couples like that, as if they lived alone in an apartment: Castiel sitting on his bed, Dean close to him, and with a strong desire to bend over to kiss him.
… Yet, Dean diligently walks in the room, a smile still on his face, and shuts the door, meeting Missouri’s eyes as a final complain.
-"Everything is fine, Dean, it's only me, everything is fine."
But being in Dean’s mind has been a different kind of ordeal. Seeing Michael imagining him doing horrible things through Dean’s body. Having to see how Dean was broken inside his own head was something Castiel would have never expected.
-"I have to take a shower.
MEG: Library or Dean's laps?
He rolls his eyes to heaven, making her laugh.
-"Michael can go to any part of the world", Dean hears Castiel say clearly behind him. "Which tells us that mutant monsters can be in every country and that they might be ready to attack the whole world at the same time. It’s better to prevent them from fleeing the country”, Castiel continues to explain, “so we have to shrink the circle to regroup them, not to scatter them to other parts of the world.”
-“Until we find a plan against the Shadow, we should not do it again...”, Castiel says with a sad voice.
- “Then, if you have a problem at home, please let me know. I can help you. Sure, I hope you are all doing well”, he adds in order to clear the air, “But just so you know, you have a listening ear right in front of you.”
- Knowing if we’re awake. Me more than you.
It has been very complicated to pull Michael out of Dean’s body, but not as much as Castiel would have thought. The first time Dean has been his vessel – the only time he said yes to Michael –, finding Dean has required the help of a lot of people. This time, Michael hadn’t even tried to fly away. He let himself be handcuff and followed them to the bunker.
- “Hey, buddy, your coffee will get cold. Besides, I’m not sure you want to be late for the first day of school –“, she starts saying before being interrupted by Dean opening the door. “I know some girls and boys will be crushing about the beautiful professor Winchester”, she says with a smirk.
Everyone chuckles and dean is shocked for a second before he pulls himself together. No one seems to notice, hopefully. He turns to face the read-head in front of him.
(See the end of the chapter for
She sighs like some kind of drama queen, doing a bitch-face as only Sam can do. She almost has it. Almost perfect, but she can’t beat the master.
-Now that we know he's alive, we need to track him down and kill him once for all", Cas adds.
- “Jo, before you, was into one of our professors. Rufus Turner. (Hearing this, Dean almost suffocates, sharing between shock and laughter). Yes, I know”, she goes on while laughing too. “So she was there, talking all day long about her dear professor. She just wouldn’t stop and it was so funny when, one day, Turner discovered about this –
The most heartbreaking scene was certainly having to see Dean living the life he would like to have. Being a bartender, listening to the stories of drunk people, most likely hook up with the most beautiful women, calming down every fight between customers… But above all, having a life without the supernatural. A normal life.
The corridor is crowded of students when he walks towards his office.
-"Hey, I'm not just a pretty face."
-« Okay. If you don’t want to tell me, then it means it’s linked to me. But you gotta think that if I know, it’ll be better for me to avoid doing something against you.
Castiel has kept his trenchcoat, all of his thicknesses clothing actually. He had only loosed his tie a little, allowing Dean to enjoy the view of the small piece of uncovered skin. Dean had already lived it many times in his life, but it's still unbelievable to think that being able to see the beginning of Cas' neck and his collarbone can release into his mind so many hidden fantasies.
-"No, not yet. But I am about to make our lunch, what would you like? Bacon?"
For the first time since the beginning of their conversation, Dean turns his face to look at Castiel. If Dean has not changed, Castiel yes. He seems more tired, but also relieved.
Castiel nodded in agreement and added :
, he thinks but it doesn’t prevent Dean from smiling to Crowley. “Come in, I have an appointment in ten minutes”, he says, already going back to his office, expecting Dean to follow.
"I did not find any spell or potion to summon a… Shadow? I can’t do anything more, I have exhausted all my sources. "
She is close now, there is no other chair so she is just leaning on the desk, her arms crossed and just waiting.
A single note, a piece of torn paper between two sheets. And written on it, only seven words. Seven tiny words that may change a whole life. It probably belonged to either the paper before – a certain Alastair – or the next one – Kevin Tran, a student Dean had in his class last year. But the writing doesn’t match either of them.
- "Well those hunters failed killing Nick, a simple human.”
-What? Possible? Oh, dear, he did. And better, he did something because of love when you couldn’t do it for your precious angel? Are you sure you love him, because it doesn’t make sense to me. Nick can save an angel from the dead, when you can’t”
