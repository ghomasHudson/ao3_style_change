Sherlock only laughed harder, and he crawled over to the pile of his clothes and tossed John his underwear.
Kayla nodded, "yeah that sounds smart, do you already know what you want?"

Sherlock wasn’t sure what John had planned for this scene, but he trusted John. When they first started doing this they tried to negotiate every single step, but found that form of consent didn’t work out too well for him. So it caused them to be at a bit of stop because of it, and that frustrated Sherlock. He ended up trying to look for help, but found nothing that appealed to him in terms of negotiating consent. One day, Irene surprised him with a text because of all the places Sherlock had to place an order for some well made sex toys it had to be the shop Irene’s wife had to work at; and sure customer confidentiality is important in the businesses catering to certain tastes, but somethings are just too juicy to keep to themselves. Irene at first just ran commentary on Sherlock’s purchases but eventually it evolved to her giving them advice and further more it lead to Irene started playing mediator because well despite him not liking it she did have a point on John and him having a communication problem. Eventually John and him settled on their idea of Consent was “yes until it is a no,” and so far it was what worked for them.
12. Licking |
Sherlock pushed through and bent down to untangle the lead, but Toby figured it out before he had to start. Sherlock started to laugh.
"And I going to help Sherlock," added John.
“I think we will, also i think we proved that it is going to take a lot of effort for you to end me,” Replied John with a cheeky grin on his face.
(See the end of the chapter for
He decided do just overwhelm all his senses at once, and who knows maybe would be willing to share some party favors when he got there. He needed to go dancing, where every sense was just overpowered by all that lights, sounds, and exchanging of touch. Usually he didn’t like being touched but in that setting he just didn’t care. In the club he found that he couldn’t deduce every single body in the room and with a few drinks and maybe some E, it was almost like he could just be like everyone in the crowded warehouse he rarely wanted to be like them but sometimes it was nice to pass. It was a Saturday, he knew he wasn’t going to have a hard time finding a party, the problem was just finding the right one. He slipped into a pair of leather pants, and a crushed velvet shirt, he knew it was a slightly preposterous combo but he knew it would be one folks would find inviting to touch, he paired it with a belt full of all sorts of interesting textures.
John and Sherlock looked at each other, and nodded, because they both agreed with Mycroft on this topic.
“Well it is a little too easy to fall in love with someone who kills a man to save
"Damn it," said Sherlock.
Sherlock took in that info, and he though that was the contributing factor as to why he didn’t take off his shirt.
Sherlock looked at the cake, it was like the one he was just holding up for Rosie until Sebastian showed up. "I don't know, I really don't like not knowing things."
William at first was confused by his Papa’s actions, but as he learned more about hackers, he understood why his Papa gave him all the locks. So he solved them all in one afternoon and wrote the algorithm for developing the combo for each kind of lock.
"Well if I wanted help, I would've asked you," said Mycroft.
Eurus twitched, “well I don’t know why you are here brother, you aren’t due here for another 3 days. Also nice touch on making sure all the staff here for me are deaf. Who came up with that idea?”
Kayla shrugged, "maybe for one of our outings we can go to one of the farmer's markets and hopefully there are some honey folks there."
“I’d say I’d be more mindful of how I talk to you in the future, but we know that would be a lie, Sherlock,” said Mycroft quite dryly.
And as if Rosie knew the exact thing to do in that moment, she started licked the handle and rubbing her hands all over it and the handle and licking her hands.
John was roughly handling Sherlock’s hips with the force of his full body weight as he slammed into Sherlock’s body. He suddenly heard a door slam, and he stilled. He held moved a hand to the back of Sherlock’s head and he gently grabbed some of his hair, he twisted Sherlock’s head to the side and he leaned down to meet his gaze, he raised a finger to his mouth as if reminding Sherlock to stay quiet. Sherlock nodded and buried his face even more into the pillow. John returned to his punishing pace because he found that he was actually pretty close to cumming and he could feel it. When his orgasm hit, John felt the need to make some rather animalistic sounds, but ended up biting Sherlock’s shoulder which caused Sherlock to buckle in surprise but ultimately he calmed, leaned into the bite, and softly moaned into the pillow, and
John burst into laughter, “Yes one could say that may have been a factor.”
Kayla raised an eyebrow at him.
John raised an eyebrow at Sherlock, “he was five at the time, what could a five year old do that would get you banned from a Tesco?”
"Boy bye," quipped Kayla and with that she dashed off with a slight flourish.
Aithne stared at her glass not really paying attention to anything, her mind was just full of her at the moment just sorting through paper work and figuring out the billing codes that companies won't through a fit over for some of the more unusual treatment expenses for the clients. She was telling her sister the story of her and Eurus and that was pretty much autopilot at this point.
Sherlock huffed and glared at Mycroft.
John said “the bedroom” like there was only going to be one. He didn’t know what to make of it. He didn’t really do these things, the whole sharing a domestic space with people he fucked, but maybe he could learn. To be honest he did mostly pickup play and even then there was rarely ever any talking, he just took whatever was given to him. He never had anyone who talked this much to him, he never had anyone who had reasons for why he was getting punished and how the punishment was going to be executed. This was interesting. He followed John’s orders and waited. He paused as he was about to drop to his knees and ran to his end table and pulled out a plethora of lube and condoms.
"They are surprisingly peaceful people, and the folks who cause them the most trouble tends to be massive corporations, but believe me if the opportunity pops up I am going to do it, even if it is below a 5 on the interest scale," replied Sherlock with a slight smile.
"Okay you have until Wednesday to get rid of all the surveillance tools from the inside of Sherlock and John's home, otherwise I will report you to the higher ups for unauthorized surveillance on your parents, because the approval was only for Sherlock," said Andrea. "Also you are going to tell Sherlock that you are removing the surveillance, I think that could make a difference for him."
"Holy fuck, what kinda dark family secret lies there? I mean that long of a stay and the fact that you managed to get this number which just smacks of you having some connections that just hints of money or power or both. I mean I am going to have to get all case notes and do an in person interview before I give you an answer. But the house could always use more residents who pay fully out of pocket, maybe even a few trustees," Dr. Hunter laughed. "Also what's her name, I mean if you got this number than you know I was in an institution myself as a kid for almost a year, but a fire happened," she sighed. "I may have been in a place with her," asked Dr. Hunter.
"You purposely triggered John, so as to trigger Sherlock, I almost feel like you are the one who needs to slow down in this moment. Remember last week when Sherlock asked to put down some boundaries on just how involved you can be in observing him. You violating his privacy in terms of accessing his case notes is worse than just not backing down when he asked, this is crossing a boundary that doesn't need to be crossed. It isn’t even a matter of respecting your brother at this point it has become a matter of respecting the law,” said Anthea, even more worried for her boss. She hoped he would at least see this as some what wrong.
John opened the refrigerator, “what the fuck?” He pointed to the head in the fridge. “Explain!” His boner definitely wilted at that discovery.
There is some bits of homophobia and casual transphobia that occurs in this chapter, but I didn't mark them off because skipping those bits means you skip a lot of important parts of the story. It's long but it does have a happy ending full of supportive families.
“Oh was the cock that good,” said Jeanine amused at the turn of events.
“Just how much does he need that 20£?” Said John, as he turned to Mike, “I mean he looks a little too well dressed to be hurting for the 20£.”
John looked at Sherlock who shook his head "no" and they both looked at Mrs Hudson who shrugged. "No but my father is allergic but he rarely comes by," said Sherlock.
He automatically tossed the memories of getting toby and going with her to the store into a new room that was going to be dedicated to Toby and the info it took to keep her in a job. Kayla was probably going to have to share a space with Toby, but he wasn’t sure if they should differentiate just yet, he did have to see her again tomorrow, so he was sure the room for toby would be even more filled with information and maybe even toys. He felt the bed shift, something brushed up against his arm. He took a step out of the mind palace, John was asleep his hand was brushed up against Sherlock's. Sherlock smiled, and reached out to hold John's hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock turned away awkwardly, the words spoken were a bit confusing for him, he always felt like he didn’t need anyone because other people were boring but John was here making him consider giving people another chance. He suddenly felt John pull his hand away.
Sherlock still with a ridiculously wide grin, walked over to his chair nude and sat down, “well that settles it.”
John grabbed a pack of finger sandwiches that had a wide variety of sandwiches from the deli counter.
"Can you blame me no one wants to see their dad getting rawed by a train of 30 muscle bears and leather daddies. But g-d bless PrEP," blaze said through the laughter.
Solomon surprised, "yes we can." He pulled a card reader and attached it to his phone.
John sighed, and pointed down the street, "there's a Tesco that way."
“It probably does taste better, but you are already sticking your tongue into my ass, so really why complain of taste,” Replied Sherlock as he started laughing again.
They all proceeded back to the cart coral and unlocked Rosie’s stroller from the stroller parking. John and Sherlock placed all the groceries  and Rosie in the stroller and made their way back to 221 B Baker Street.
Francis laughed, “yeah I tried to explain what happened to the cops and I got arrested for ‘resisting arrest’, like the fuck was that about.”
Kayla started laughing hysterically, she went up to the machine and ran the order through with no problem. She turned to the staff member, “You know that is a stupid rule, if you ain’t got no one minding the the till.”
Ice Box Diner, said that she served you this morning and you didn’t make anyone cry, and you actually ate an entire meal. Do you realize that is the equivalent of pigs flying and cops facing consequences for their actions?” said Kate.
John sat on the floor next to Sherlock, "well most adults don't know what they are missing out on. Your set of skills are a set of skills, no one else has and you make it look easy, even when you are probably struggling, because even then we are all just trying to keep up."
“Well the message isn’t getting delivered if you can’t find the will power to will power to do what you are asking other people to do,” replied John.
"So may I ask why you are implementing the use of a therapist so much? I mean you both always got on like a house on fire front the very start, I mean you even moved in together the first day you met, but now you have to use therapists to work things out. Why the effort?" Asked Violet.
“Nah at this point I am guessing we need to add another three,” said Athina, “if you are going to take 7 years to take tell a story, the end better be a good one.
John cleared his threat, "we aren't bumping anyone down a list by getting one of the available dogs?"
Sherlock snipped back, "you are not allowed to ask that question by law, and I already got your medallion number, so if you don't want to be reported for violating the law, I suggest you just get us to 221 Baker Street, and ask no further questions."
Sherlock shook his head, “John, we still only have two data points. Mrs. Hudson can you keep an ear out for Rosie? We’re going to take a quick step in Speedy’s.” He dragged John out the door and into Speedy’s, “hey Amir, is it okay if I ask everyone a quick question and who ever answer can have their meal added to my monthly tab.”
Solomon laughed, "well mr. Trust Fund, we always appreciate donations here. It takes about £11,000 to train one of these guys."
“Danny, if you don’t stop I am going to your fan-fiction.net account and forward your most dreadful stuff to the entire office,” snapped Anthea. “And don’t deny it I’ve seen it all, you got some weird taste, nothing illegal, but oh boy do you have some weird tastes,” said Anthea trying to stay straight faced, but a slight smirk was appearing.
“Yeah Wolf, definitely do that and gag him if you have to, because last thing we need is for him to make yet another outlandish announcement of donation or declaring war on the American Healthcare Act or whatever travesty the republicans will come up to undo the Affordable Care Act. I mean yes he means well, but we really can’t afford to offend too many politicians, we want that ADAP and Ryan White funding to be as protected as possible,” said Scott with a tone that suggested joking, but his face said I am so fucking serious, gag him if you need to.
"I'm 36 years old, and I haven't really been interested in anyone who is interested in me till fairly recently. John it really is up to you." Sherlock winked.
Sherlock shrugged, "same time next week?"
Violet interrupted, “John I hope this doesn’t come along as imposing, but I think you and Sherlock are going to be together for a long time. And if Rosie considers Sherlock as second parent, we might as well treat her like we are her grand parents. We would like to give her a trust fund and a school fund, so that she doesn’t have to worry about anything. We can even put her name on the list for any public school in the country, our family has connections in pretty much all of them, so if she keeps her grades decent then you don’t have to worry about picking the best school possible for her. Luckily Sherlock and Mycroft wasn’t able to burn down any bridges to the girl schools, if you are to somehow find yourselves raising a boy, I suggest don’t let Sherlock any where near the interviews for Eton or Harrow, Sherlock graduated from Harrow, but he managed to blow up a lab before he left. He started at Eton but he was participating in a physics competition and his rocket managed to get in a major accident, I mean they didn’t expel him out right because it was obvious that one of his peers sabotaged his launch platform, but  you really can’t recover from launching a rocket that ended up to the dismay of a certain security team for a certain family proving that they indeed were not ready for every possible outcome of attack. Don’t tell Sherlock we told you that story. The university process is one Sherlock really can’t ruin because he contributed more than he destroyed so he ultimately is for the most part not someone black listed, he is just not allowed at fundraising events because his deductions caused people to leave before they wrote checks.”
Sherlock sighed and entered 221 Baker Street, he leaned against the wall, slid down into a curled up ball, and burst out into laughter. He was an absolute ball of energy, in totally new territory.
Sherlock looked at the video doorbell and saw it was his parents, “Hello mum and dad, I am just going to buzz you in. Rosie is taking her nap and we didn’t want to wake her to answer the door.”
John gently picked her up and made his way up the stairs to lay her down for her nap.
John nodded, and looked out at the crowd, “I might as well enjoy the festivities, do I need to get rid of the the company shirt?”
Sherlock found the sensation of John cumming in him to be rather interesting, and he found his mind wondering about the potential rates of absorption in the rectal lining and if it is possible in some way that with enough regularity he could have a bit of John in him for ever... or would oral digestion of John’s cum would be a more efficient route. He also wondered why John picked coconut oil as lube when there was clearly packets of surgical lube in his drawer. Maybe it reminded him too much of work, yes maybe that was why. He stopped himself from wondering any further because obviously this was a profound moment for them and John might start to panic over loosing some of his last vestiges of heterosexuality by actually kissing a man at a Pride festival and following it up with fucking that same man. He just realized his eyes were closed, he opened them and looked up at John who was still leaning over him with a look of curiosity, he could feel John softening up inside of him and the slow trickle of John’s cum coming out of him.
“Did he up a fight?” Quipped Irene, the three of them broke out into laughter.
Sherlock stood up and looked at his watch, “and you made it with two minutes to spare.” He looked at John who just broke out into a fit of giggling, and kissed him. First it was a tentative kiss, but when John returned the kiss, Sherlock deepened the kiss, providing all kinds of appealing sensations, he pulled away, and John leaned forward as if chasing after the kiss. An alarm went off, “sorry Captain looks like you’re out of time, catch you later. If I am on a case don’t wait up, if not we can get dinner and retrieve the rest of your belongings from the bedsit.” He finished that sentence off with a wink because from what he observed that was a pretty solid way of ensuring that the offer of dinner meant more.
"Okay John I won't tell you then," replied Mrs Hudson.
Mycroft took a deep breath, "why do I need to do that?"
He hit the corner with a bit of a drift, the flash of cop lights dropped. He started laughing, he veered out of the turnabout. His eyes drifted towards the rear view mirror there was already a car chasing after him. The officers was obviously trying to use their radio to report his car, he adjusted the dial on his cloaking device. The officers looked confused because it was obvious that their scanners weren’t working. They also looked dreadfully confused, but of course not only was their radios not working but also the sedan may look like a shitty car one would give their teenager, but with all cars it’s what on the inside that counts. He smirked, he spent quite a few weeks gutting this terrible nondescript sedan that looked very much at home as the car of a teenager whose wealthy parents were upset at him. Not that he was one of those kids, his grades were immaculate and the teachers loved him, his peers not so much, but did they ever truly matter. No his parents got a rather awesome car for him to use during breaks when he was a teenager. Sherlock had the terrible car, mainly because he was ridiculously impulsive and half the time he would wreck whatever car he was using in the name of science, they just kept getting him cars though because he kept all kinds of weird things in his car, and it was a lot better for him to just drive them, then it was to see Sherlock deal with the cops because they were concerned about him carrying a couple of dead animals simply because he wanted to perform an autopsy on them.
“They have been going okay mummy, we mainly just play the violin together, sometimes we play chess. She recently started talking again, but most of the time she just wants to know what growing up around other people is like, even though I don't think I am the best person to ask such questions. We do have a little debate about whether it is better to be alone and truly alone or being alone in the presence of other people," Sherlock frowned. "She was apparently in Sherringford since she was 10, and they kept her for the most part isolated. Did you know the UN consider isolation over 15 days as torture?” replied Sherlock, his face twitched slightly and he took a deep breath. "Honestly what did Uncle Ruddy do that got him the ability to do what he did to Eurus, that just seems like an awful lot of resources to put into one person."
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock smirked, and tilted his head to try reaching for the condom so that he could roll it over John’s considerable length but given that Sherlock was pinned by John weight he struggled to get more than just 2 inches rolled on.
He looked at the Holmes family, all of whom were sitting in the chairs in front of him.
Hiram stared into a blank spot on the wall, “that's it, you got 200 guests and I am sure you are going to have a giant wedding court, that is a hell of a lot more players to work with for diversion. Joey, Josephine, do you have some teenage cousins or nieces and nephews who are willing to take one for the team?  Using minors can probably lower all the legal ramifications and increase it on her end. I’m not too fond of this situation she hasn’t ever been angry at all of us at once. Usually she just pushes and pull amongst us, so this makes a rather unstable situation I mean even more unstable, I mean yes we all had our reasons for leaving and she sees that abandonment, it has just been hard to get her to consider coming here. And as much as I don’t want to divorce her, it is the only way I can regain full rights to creating trust funds because she refuses to second any of the funds I have been attempting to start.” He took a sip from his wine glass, “as for your father, we’ll cut the mic if he gets terrible, and for the rest of the night I think if we throw enough people to keep him busy he wob’t have a chance to finish what he has to say into a mic. So who wants dessert?”
Hiram laughed, “Yes, I do, and for the holidays where their mother comes over, we make a whole day of it. Working with a game plan goes a long way, in divvying up the emotional labor.”
Sherlock laughed, “I’m not that terrible, I’ll just get a cab and pay the cabbie enough to cover the clean up fee and a generous tip for the trouble.” He smoothed out his outfit to the best of his ability and walked up to John, as he adjusted himself as well.
Sebastian scoffed, and walked away.
Rosie waved enthusiastically at the two of them. "Daddy! Sherlock!” She yelled as she ran to them. She pointed at building. “Puppies!”
“Thank you Papa!” yelled William as he hugged his papa and ran back up to his room.
Sherlock smiled, "John I already know where the get the dog, a service dog trainer I proved innocent of murder owes me a favor."
John let out a load moan, and with his good arm, he pushed Sherlock into a sitting position. “Come on Boy, don’t make me do all the work, make your captain a very happy man.” He rubbed Sherlock’s ass and gave a little pat to encourage Sherlock to move.
Aithne waved her hand in the air, "you spend the most time with the clients, I think you are the one most qualified to make the decision on if they will fit in with the current residents. Also would you like to come with me to England? I find that you do keep me from making emotional knee jerk decisions."
“Papa, can the argument be made that those also count as puns,” asked William.
John tested tools he had heating and cooling to see if they had hit the desired temperatures and was satisfied. He looked at Sherlock who finally relaxed with a bit of affection. He smiled and pullled on a pair of surgical gloves. He swabbed an alcohol pad over Sherlock’s right thigh. He smirked at just how much Sherlock arched at the sensation. He was now confident that the plan would work. He pulled a scalpel out of a steri-pack and gently cut a fine line along the side of Sherlock’s hip, he was careful to adjust the pressure as Sherlock tensed and writhed against the restraints. John heard a light slap and turn to the sound. He found that Sherlock’s cock was extremely hard and making an audible slap against his stomach with each breath. He found himself with the overwhelmed need to laugh. He stepped away from the table to give himself a moment to compose himself. He was glad that Sherlock couldn’t hear him.
“When I was away, I got hurt really badly, and some injuries take time to heal,” said Sherlock, as he measured John’s shoulders and sleeve length. He knew that John was highly suggestible at the moment, he figured he could be as honest as he wanted because he could easily make John forget.
Sherlock forced a laugh, "Brother My, you are going to have to be more specific." John laughed an awkward forced laugh.
Mycroft looked at the fingerprint patterns on the key pad, it was too much info to make a consideration. He pulled out a device that could crack codes for any swipe card. The safe obviously had a key card bypass, so he swiped it.
John suddenly didn’t feel tired anymore, in fact he was the exact opposite of tired. He walked up behind Sherlock and roughly shoved a finger along side Sherlock’s. He pressed down on Sherlock’s prostate a few times to draw out some rather delightful moans from him, which just made it oh so much easier to achieve a hard on. He moved his hands
John huffed, and looked at a rather confused Rosie and then turned to Kayla, “Do you think you can do it?” He said holding back a slight laugh.
John laughed a little too loudly for the time of the night, but he kissed Sherlock on the cheek. “Well we both seemed to have missed the fact that all of Ro’s fights started off because of something involving other people’s perception of him and gender.” He pulled Sherlock in even closer, “no one ever expects to have a trans kid so it is probably very easy to not see things like that. But all that matters is that he is getting the support he needs.”
The siblings all laughed.
Daddy John tires of his pup and gets his boy back.
Sherlock was sweating and swearing as he bounced on John’s cock. He didn’t dare touch his cock because he knew the moment he touched his cock he was probably going to start cumming immediately. And he went on like that, for quite some time, because he would stop whenever he felt just on the edge of coming. He wasn’t exactly to pleased at how long he had to wear that cock ring so he might as well get John back in the best way possible. He looked back at John and smirked.
Sherlock smirked at just how easy it was for him to just open John after all the attention he paid. And he got a certain level of pleasure at watching John beg for more. He added a second finger and started to really stretch John open because Sherlock knew just how hard he wanted to push John.
“Tea, please,” Replied Sherlock.
The girls were just flocking Sherlock with all sorts of questions and he answered them. Eventually he brought out his supplies for disguise making, and all the teens gave it a go on the various techniques Sherlock had for making a disguise. William laughed as Asa tried to apply some facial hair only for it fall off as he took a picture.
Solomon sighed, "yeah that's what I get for trying to do my own garbage. Anyway what are you looking for? Service dog, therapy dog, blood hound, or just a pet? We don't do the last two options though, and if that's what you are looking for I can show you some excellent adoption groups and great trainers."
“Oh Sherlock dear, don’t worry about that, we just want you to be happy. John has been so good for you. Yes you had your rough spots with him but what relationship doesn’t have hard times. And we don’t care about the grandkids, if anything we’ll treat Rosie as a grand child if you allow us to,” said Violet.
John woke up to the lovely feeling of Sherlock rutting against him, “what’s that darling?”
Sherlock scrambled to his feet and landed next to John with a little too much force.
The phone rang twice, "mum if this is you with a new number, you know I am just going to block it like all the others. And really how the fuck did you get this number..." barked out Aithne in a fast pressured voice.
John sighed, "please don't tell me you spent our monthly rent on Scratch Cards and marijuana."
Papa  just sighed, “Jawwn, you really waited a whole year to use that one.” Papa got up dumped his dish quite haphazardly in the sink without bothering to rinse it. He flopped on the couch rather dramatically and descended into his mind palace, his face a completely blank slate.
“I’ll have a full English and a fruit salad,” Said John, staring at Sherlock, “and a cup of tea with milk and sugar”.
“Also I think you have an admirer,” Said Irene tilting her head towards a dark corner.
Harry nervously laughed as they returned their hot chocolate and made an attempt to ask Kate and Irene how they know John and Sherlock.
“I don’t know Sherlock, you do have a way of really taking control of a situation,”Said John with a slight shrug of his shoulders.  He opened his newspaper to hide the fact that he was feeling slight rush of blood to his face. He wasn’t quite sure why he was blushing, but at least the blood wasn’t rushing to a slightly more complicated to explain area.
John looked at Sherlock, unsure of what Sherlock was planning, “Depends on what you want to try,” he said with a small laugh.
“I noticed things okay... he needed someone,” muttered Sherlock.
Sherlock strained to get a better look at the dark corner because he knew he felt watched earlier, so it might be worth it to catch a glimpse at who was watching him. He saw a slightly older gentleman on the edge of being a bit too old to be in a warehouse like this, he probably wasn’t there on his own accord. But the beard made the watcher look absolutely delicious and Sherlock wasn’t afraid to admit he liked his men a bit older. He smirked and turned his body in the man’s direction, rolling his hips and smirking.
Ella looked at Sherlock with a bit of concern, well as much concern as one could have while maintaining some semblance of a neutral expression, "Sherlock you can tell me, I can even have John leave the room if you want."
Andrea smirked, “En Garde!” Mycroft and Ella took their stances.
"I was considering letting you live here for free at first, but look what charging you rent got you," said Mrs Hudson. She smiled at John.
“The one that had the bush... America! Or they could be upset that he’s American I haven’t really been able to figure it out. As for inviting people from the scene is kind of inevitable, I mean really, it is where I know the most people outside of any familial or work sense. But I am going to invite some some of my secondary school mates as well, I mean I am sure they would just love any excuse to visit San Francisco, because we all know they all probably have the free time. They’re a foppish bunch of guys with more dollars than sense, still love them though... except for Dorian, he never ages and is pretty much human teflon. At this point I think I only keep up with him to watch the inevitable train wreck to catch up with him.”
John and Sherlock felt a bit embarrassed.
He took John’s hand and pulled out a pen from his little bag of essentials. “Hurry back, it’s 221 B Baker Street, even if you aren’t kicked out; you know you want to live with me.”
He shrugged his shoulders before diving in. He did a few broad strokes with his tongue before inserting his tongue into John’s hole. He didn’t really like the texture and it was not a pleasant warmth. His mind started wandering to risk assessments about what kind of possible STIs one could acquire from rimming, he wondered if he had any dental dams to mitigate the risk, he thought of using a condom but he remembered that John didn’t use one when he rimmed Sherlock and maybe... he felt John shifting underneath him.
John stepped in to the tub. “Turn towards me, and stay in Present position for me.” He smiled as Sherlock faced him and looked him in the eye with his mouth slightly open. “Okay Boy is there any place you don’t want me to piss on you.”
John and Ella sighed. "You didn't deserve it, i should've used my words but at the time I didn't know what to say. I have been mindful ever since, and I struggle but I have to be better because it isn't just us, there is Rosie too, she doesn't need to live with that. I lived in that kind of household I about to put her through that too," said John. Ella nodded, acknowledging John's words.
Mycroft looked at them, pulled his appointment book closer to him, flipped through the pages. Stopped, pulled out another looked through the pages of the one and repeated the process for a few more books. He turned to his parents, "it has been 2 years since any credible threat came your way, otherwise for Sherlock 2 weeks, but that was more of a potential relapse episode that he avoided by changing the park he was going to take Rosie to, he saw some folks he used to use with, wisely he went in the other direction." He went to take another sip of the overly sweet tea, he got up and added more tea to his cup to dilute the syrup concoction in his cup. His parents stare at him. "I know the polite thing to do is offer you both a cup of tea, but I have learned a long time ago, not to offer people a hot cup of tea during a tense conversation in this office." He tried to laugh, but it got stuck in his throat.
“Your parents must be exhausted, having two kids who are drama queens must’ve been intense, because everyone knows, all family can only take one drama queen at a time,” added John before he broke into laughter.
Sherlock smiled, and grabbed the older man’s hand and lead him away from the main dance floor. They passed Irene, Kate, and Jeanine who were standing at the bar.  Irene winked and Kate shot a thumbs up in their direction. Jeanine did that look she did that Sherlock knew as her “I am remembering this guy just in case Sherlock goes missing,” face.  Sherlock shook his head as he guided the older man through the crowded hallway and up a stairwell and door. The night air hit both Sherlock and bearded man smiled at Sherlock as they stepped out on to the roof.
Sherlock handed out pens and paper to everyone, "also help yourself to tea and pastries, we actually went to the shops for it. I would hate for our effort to be for nothing."
Jeanine sighed, “okay true enough, but it is the Clara with the Alcoholic girlfriend who fights at the 12 step group and my usual bar gig.”
Sherlock cracked a small smile.
Solomon grabbed onto Golem's harness and pressed the clicker, "door."  Golem started pulling Solomon to the front entrance. They exited the kennel to a fairly busy street. "There is a park one block up the hill, otherwise there is a Tesco down the hill two blocks. Which one do you think is more indicative of your ADLs... wait activities of daily living?"
"Helping" said Rosie as John whisked her away to the kitchen.
“Well I hope you don’t plan on doing it again any time soon, because mummy and father have an idea and although I advise against it, they are persistent,” said Mycroft, his nose wrinkled in disdain. “There will be someone coming to talk with you soon, be as honest as you possibly can with her, and do feel free to talk about your time here.”
"Solomon, so this is my boyfriend and roommate, John, his daughter Rosie, and our land lady Mrs. Hudson. John was in the service as an army doctor and he has PTSD. I have recently been diagnosed with C-PTSD. We need a dog that can wake him up from nightmares and a dog that can help me with panic attacks, even though I don’t know what Ella is talking about, getting back on task, and isolation. Most importantly it must get along with Rosie and Mrs. Hudson," replied Sherlock.
John ran after his dad, and tackled him knocking the knife out of his hand and down a storm drain. John knew he was a smaller man than his dad and despite being a compact mass of muscles through rugby his dad was still stronger. He held on as best he could but his dad managed to pin him down and rained down on him a large amount of blows. He swore he could hear someone calling his name. But couldn't see anyone but his dad, Harry was long gone, John hoped she got to a better place. He could hear a dog bark but he didn't know where it came from, did something just lick on him... he opened his eyes.
Joey continued, “But as far as it goes for people we knew in the service, I definitely agree on inviting Johnny and Jamie, that is a fair assessment. I mean Johnny is definitely a factor as to why both of us are still alive. I can think of maybe four marines who would even be interested in attending. It is probably going to be weird inviting more people from the service because I mean DADT got removed shortly before my last tour, so a lot of the folks I served with still don’t know that I am gay, and it would probably complicate matters for some of the more uptight ones to see that I met my husband in an active war zone.”
William smiled, “if I say both does that mean you will get even more chocolate.”
“William, we don’t really do valentines, it is a little too sentimental for my taste,”said Sherlock still hugging William.
Rosie nodded, "Yes Sherlock, Daddy why?"
John looked at Sherlock, "I think a stick together approach will work best."
“No, Sherlock this is about you,” Replied John as he stroked his fingers though Sherlock’s hair. “Do you want me to list off some options for what we can do?”
“It looks wonderful, William, I’m sure who ever gets it will love it,” said Sherlock. “You put a lot of work into it. So is this for a friend or um... you know what I am not going to ask anymore.” He smiled and opened his arms for a hug, and William ran into it.
"I hope you won't be to angry at this news, but my boss is suddenly interested in your progress and case notes," said Andrea who at work went by Anthea as she  looked across the table at her wife who was sitting down and eating some take out while going over her notebook as she translated her day notes to billing codes so that she could get paid for her work.
Sherlock smiled.
John smiled, and using the same voice, "good, and if you at up for it I want you to unzip you trousers and to start feeling yourself through you underwear."
"Hello Mycroft," greeted Ella, "welcome to our home, I am sure you have all kinds of questions, and between Andrea and your brother I have so much to talk with you about. So you can keep running and we forget all about this, or we can do a little wager to set up who gets to ask the questions and who has to answer."
John looked on in pleasure as the giant bulge in his darling boy’s stomach got smaller and smaller. He smiled, “that’s okay boy, it just means I get to fill you up all over again.” He pet his boy on the head, ”you did a spectacular job with the tentacle and you have taken much wider things up your pretty boy hole. I want to do more, would you let me do more?” John bent over and started lapping at his darling boy’s abused hole, gently using his fingers to stretch him even more.
Again another under negotiated round of fucking. This time John and Sherlock share their dark fantasies with each other, and Sherlock shows John that he can play just as rough as he can.
Captain John plays with his boy and it was absolutely off the chain.
John saw what Sherlock was doing, and he was mildly mortified that Sherlock would rather pass out than ask him to stop, but he knew Sherlock was only doing this to follow the rule to stay quiet, and quite frankly John found that incredibly hot. The idea that Sherlock was willing to do that only made this situation hotter. Well he might as well speed things up to save him or maybe he should just keep that early promise to cover him in cum. He slapped Sherlock’s hand away and wrapped his hands around Sherlock’s throat but he didn’t hold down, he gave Sherlock a few seconds to recover. And when he felt Sherlock was ready for it, he quickly grasped the sides of Sherlock’s throat, compressing both carotid and jugular veins for a few short seconds while he fucked his throat rather violently, he smirked at the look of bliss on Sherlock’s face. He suddenly pulled out and let go of Sherlock’s throat.
"Not really all of them seemed pretty good, I like them all," replied John.
Andrea turned to the teens, “okay than which went off first?”
"Why does the whole Old Guard society thing bother you? You identify as a woman and  woman aren't allowed to join," Questioned Blaze.
Rosie stared at the dog wide eyed and tried to pet him, Sherlock stopped her, "hey Rosie dear, Golem is working, he is working when he has his vest and harness on, so you can't play with him at the moment unless Solomon says it is okay. The same will go for whatever dog we choose, but don't worry that's why we brought you along, we are going to pick a dog that will work for all of us. Do you understand Rosie?"
Sherlock nodded, “I’ll tell you, but can we get back to what we were doing.”
“Yes, we are quite alone,” Said Sherlock as he pushed the man against one of the heating units. Sherlock smiled as he sunk to his knees in front of the older man. Sherlock mouthed at the older man’s crotch. He pulled back, and looked up at the older man, as he reached for the man’s belt. He suddenly felt his head being held by the older man.
Mycroft nodded, “i’ll make sure it happens.” He started his car off slowly and drove away following the law perfectly. He started laughing, he may lost control of many things in his life today, but he can still put up a fucking traffic light.
John offered his hand to Sherlock he took it, and they walked up to the door of the shelter and rang the bell.
John turned to Sherlock, "so we hold out till June and we get £42,500."
Sherlock looked at John and paused for a moment, “the sensory deprivation is a green. The temperature play is a green but depending on the next experience it might move to yellow. Stabbing is now officially red because I doubt you can ever replicate that ever again.
"I. I.. I..." stammered Sherlock. His eyes started flittering back and forth and his fingers started twitching.
Solomon nodded, "Perfectly reasonable."   Solomon pressed a buzzer, "no."  Bosco leapt off the table. Solomon whistled once and clicked the clicker twice. Bosco leaped onto the table and padded up to John and licked his face while pawing at him.
"Dad, you don't have to do this!" Yelled John. John yelped as his dad grabbed him by his wrist and started twisting it. John wrenched his arm out of his dad's grip and tackled him.
“I have no idea,” Said Sherlock broke out into more laughter.
John and Sherlock followed her outside, Mrs. Hudson handed Rosie to John. He decided to pull out stroller because carrying Rosie and groceries was not going to be fun.
John closed his eyes, and enjoyed Sherlock’s efforts, sure they enjoyed sharing a bed and holding each other, but this was something all together new, and John was enjoying himself, he hoped Sherlock was enjoying himself. He gently parted his lips, in hopes that Sherlock would get the hint. He smiled against sherlock’s mouth, and enjoyed the fact that Sherlock did indeed get the hint.
Sherlock rolled onto his back, "my parents are pleasant people, I was homeschooled till I was 11 because I didn't really get along with the school kids and the teachers weren't sure what to do with me. Mycroft started boarding school as soon as he could which is probably why I saw him as tolerable as I did as a child because he wasn't around long enough for me to hate him. I think after Eurus was sent away they were afraid to let go of me,  which makes sense given the circumstances.” He took a pause and a deep breath, “I'd ask about your childhood but I think you mentioned that your dream was a flashback to childhood. That is the first one you've told me was related to your childhood. And I know you mentioned that your dad earlier when we getting the tea ready. And I know you rarely deal with your family. We have been dealing with my family a little too much lately, just remember you can always take a break when it gets to be too much. I don’t want you to suffer through them when it gets to be too much.”
“Does he have a car?” Added Kate.
John leaned over and kissed Sherlock on the mouth, gently sweeping his tongue over Sherlock's lips.
Sherlock still with the pout nodded and he ascended up the stairs.
Kayla gestured at the gate, "well let's get on with it. Let's start with tea."
John was a recently discharged army doctor, he was still in the process of getting his pension in order, and working full time just didn't seem like a possibility. Luckily one of his friends Mike Stamford, worked at St. Bart's he was lead medical specialist of a pilot program for HIV prevention in London. So occasionally they needed extra hands on deck for rapid HIV testing. John liked to do the volunteer work because put him in a medical setting where there was a mild sense of excitement. Mike’s program had them do a lot of direct community contact work, so sure it had all the standard shenanigans that comes with working in a public sexual health clinic, but throw in the young new doctors and that everyone coming through their RVs were all well on their way to getting shagged, wanting the incentives, or just looking to get out of the club for 30 minutes. It worked out fine because most of the boys coming through the RV doors were just not his type, not that he was in any way Masc4Masc or femmephobic, it is just a lot of the people stumbling through those doors called him ‘daddy’ right off the bat and that just made him feel old. It just really needled him because he didn't think he was old enough for that life just yet. Some of the volunteers joking call home ‘Captain’ and he wasn’t sure what to make about that, he was definitely one of the testing team captains, but he really didn't appreciate being the only one referred to as captain, sure it was his rank in the army but a lot of the volunteers snickered after calling him that, he really didn't really appreciate the snickering.
John smiled because he never got to touch Sherlock this way. He sat down on the bed and motioned for Sherlock to rest his head on John’s lap. Which with much his delight, Sherlock did. He went on to stroking whatever hair he reach of Sherlock as it stuck out from the hood. His other hand started to drift down Sherlock’s shoulders and occasionally Sherlock’s chest. He found the experience to be rather gratifying and he didn’t want it to end. But the proximity of Sherlock’s face to his cock might’ve stirred something up because he eventually found himself trying to force himself not to have a hard on.
“Fuck i know at least one reason why my brother likes you, your cock is ridiculous,” Said Mycroft while gasping for breath.
vigorously but the movement was impeded by the tight grip. John smiled and pulled out of Sherlock, who let out a rather pathetic whimper at the sudden emptiness. John lead Sherlock around by his hair, until he was on his knees in the middle of the alley.
“No you don’t,” was heard from a distance.
"No problem but next time I think you should go with a real duel, that guy obviously needs to be put out of his misery," said the third teen.
Violet interrupeted, “John please call me Violet.”
“I may be loyal fast, but I at least I don’t disguise my self motives for control overy sibling’s ability to make decisions for themselves,” Said John squeezing Mycroft’s head even more before releasing him.
"Robin hood?" Asked Rosie.
Sherlock also shot a smile at Molly’s direction.
"You wear your coat all the time no matter the weather and you insist on having an absurd amount of comforters on the blanket, I am pretty sure you found a way to squeeze it into your life," said John, "even if you didn't notice." John smiled at Sherlock who was giving him a mildly perplexed look.
“Oh g-d I’m fucked,” said Wiggins as he watched the agitated Sherlock walk away.
Sherlock's parents waited by the door, John and Sherlock got up with Sherlock carrying Rosie and met them at the door. "Would it be okay to hug all of you before we leave?" Asked Violet.
“Nice,” said Willow with a grin.
“I’m your dad, that’s why!” said John, still laughing. “And guess what, there’s more; but I am going the stretch them out and use it at just the right moment.”
Sherlock sighed, "okay I am going to be honest with you, I've never had sex, I don't even like most forms of physical contact. Yet, I want to do things with John and I am afraid that if we were to try and I react poorly. It will ruin things and John will eventually leave me. I mean John likes sex, like for a good chunk of the time we were living together, he had a long string of one night stands and many attempts at dating. I am not sure if that is something I can do right now or maybe even ever." Sherlock swallowed, brought his hands to his face, and curled in on himself, remained silent.
Mycroft laughed, "you at rather strange, you know."
Sherlock shook his head indicating no.
“As nice as this cuddle is, I really need to go bathroom,” Said John as he
“Sorry, John, just didn’t want to get interrupted,” he said as he tossed little bagging into the garbage and washed his hands in the kitchen sink. He turned and smiled at John. “We had quite the day didn’t we?”
Sherlock took a deep breath, John and Kayla laughed. Rosie gave a smile like she knew exactly what she was doing.
| Medical play |
John got up, and grabbed Sherlock a bottle of water from the night table. “I’m rubbish at this,” said John rather sadly.
William always had a feeling of being different all his life, he had two dads instead of a mum and a dad. To top it off no one talked about his mum, so he couldn’t even try to be sad when he talked to other kids with no mums tried to talk with him. He tried to poke around on the topic in all the places his dads store information and from what he could find, he decided he didn’t really want to know much about her. He also never found himself fitting into the categories that the teachers tried to impose of him and his peers.
“Oh a ‘no’ that’s understandable, I see how that would be frustrating. Okay, boy, I want you to lie across my lap, face the mirror so that I can see your pretty face. Since this is our first session that isn’t pick up play, I am not going to use any impact toys, just some good old fashion over the knee spanking. Remember it is 10 strikes for the mess on the floor, 1 for the greasy counters, and that is being doubled for the refrigerator incident. So 22 is the total count. Do you think that is fair?” Asked John, while watching the mirror to see if Sherlock appeared to be listening. He smiled as Sherlock nodded and scrambled to flop across John’s lap rather gracelessly. While gently rubbing lazy circles into Sherlock’s ass, he emphasized “I want you to keep count, after each stroke you are going to thank me okay. Is that clear?”
Sherlock nodded, "yes at first, but I reminded them that banning a service animal is illegal, and that I already had his cab number. And Toby was perfectly able to fit in and nobody noticed her."
Sherlock shook his head, "yes of course, I am fine."  He wasn't quite sure why he was being asked that question, he didn't like that people always asked that question out of the nowhere.
"Boy, you know my crazy terribleness saved all of your asses," said Aithne as she leaned back in her chair and raised her leg.
“I don’t really care, my place is nearby but mind you it is a bed sit with a strict no overnight visitor policy. And it is a veteran’s housing, so I don’t know how that might affect things for you,” Said John, he knew it was probably a bad idea and he was probably fueled by a touch of the urge for a bit of self sabotage, but he couldn’t bring himself to care.
He took the steps up, to his bedsit contemplating whether or not show up at 221 B with all his possessions throwing all caution to the wind or maybe just checking out 221 and deal with the uncomfortable shit that was getting over the fact that he was indeed caught with another man in his bedsit that was specifically for veterans but hey they can openly serve now... so what was veteran’s affairs office going to do about it. Okay he was probably going to have to take to showering at the gym if he was to stay, but no he thought to himself, just take the chance and move in with Sherlock even though he does feel like a figment of his imagination.
Sherlock looked at John and the two of them started giggling, “well that escalated quickly.”
“Go back to sleep, Sherlock,” huffed John.
Andrea smirked, "so do you want him to come to your office or our home?"
Violet and Siger looked personally offended.
John took a menacing step toward Sebastian, he hopes that Sebastian will just stop talking because right now he was getting the urge to fight him.
Sherlock grinned and while keeping eye contact with John, he pressed his mouth against condom and in one smooth motion, Sherlock rolled the condom on to John’s dick, he enjoyed the light burn in his jaw because it was so fucking thick, his tongue lapped at the veins. Even with the condom he can tell that John had a cock that would hit all the good parts. It was a surprisingly long but not too long, he guessed about 8 inches, but wasn’t completely sure. He has a feeling that John would be rather amenable to the of Sherlock measuring him. He took a moment to let his throat relax around John’s length. John’s cock had a slight curb, Sherlock was willing to bet that john’s cock would his all the right spots if he was to bottom for him sometime. Sherlock thought that if he was had to make the ideal cock to have a good time with, this was the dick. And with that he pulled back keeping a intense suction, he used his tongue to adjust the pressure on John’s cock, he used John’s gasps and grunts as a way to gauge how well he was doing .
"But honey aren't you the one who has to do most of the shooting to protect this man," said Ella smirking under her mask.
Sherlock shrugged, "I think that will be absolutely fine."
"I opened the newspaper, which is something I do every morning, and I guess my brain decided that the pictures in the paper was showing the ruins of places I've protected and even through the label says it was somewhere else I can't bring myself to believe it," said Paul, he buried his face in his hands. "How stupid was that?"
“Your rock bottom keeps getting lower,” hissed Mycroft.
John nodded, "I think that was pretty good, not much of a shock."
Mrs. Hudson muffled yell was heard... “Sherlock! John! The soundproofing is terrible, and I have my bridge game here.”
Sherlock shook his head, “I want you in me.” He rubbed himself more against John’s still clothed lap.
“Well that rarely happens,” said Mrs. Hudson. “I guess enjoy the feeling while it lasts.”
"Mycroft are you going to try to or do better?" Said Ella, a light smirk threatening to break across her face. She knew that the question was slightly antagonistic.
Violet and Siger stared at their eldest son, wondering what kind of life he lived for that to be a rule for him. "Mycroft, I know you are concerned, but did you know extreme surveillance and hovering behaviors can change how a person navigates the world?"
Sherlock pointed towards the foot of the bed, "that way she has the best access to assist when needed." Sherlock leaned back and closed his eyes, sleep isn’t an easy thing for Sherlock, sometimes he just spends the time sorting the events of the day into his mind palace. He knows that sometimes he can get lost in it, because it has struck him fairly recently that he wasn’t completely in control of when the walls came up. But he figures that with proper organization of it, the walls can stay under his control. He listed all the events he had in the day that gave him any strong feelings, he separated the events by what kind of strong feelings he had, whether it would serve him to hold onto or not. It was a lot of info to process.
John snapped out of his moment of slight terror and self loathing, and realized that Sherlock seemed to be very much on board with hooking up, he wasn't quite sure if he got any new info on the flat mate front. He enthusiastically joined Sherlock in the rutting against each other. It was rather thrilling to do this out in the open, should any one passing by the alley just look to their side they would see them in all their rutting like a pair of teenagers on the dance floor who would probably get pried apart by a priest any second. John grabbed Sherlock by his collar and kissed him intensely, it was pleasurable but occasionally there would be a slip and a quick jolt of pain before it ramped back up to pleasurable.
John nodded and smiled, "okay Violet, Siger, Mycroft and Sherlock, you each get three terms you want for the contract. And when we reconvene, we take a vote about whether or not the term is agreeable or not, and if there is any adjustments needed to a term to make it work, then we can tweak it to be either acceptable or scrap it completely. And none of the terms of the agreement can single out a person by name."
“What the hell is #Johnlock?” Yelled Sherlock, he was looking at his phone, he kept media alert on his and John’s names. He opened the notifications to find multiple social media accounts showing pictures of him and John kissing ranging from the parade central to their door step.
Mycroft decided that since Ella kept striking from below he might as well aim towards there.
And Sherlock leant in the older man’s thrusts, “Fuck it, let’s go find a place to have some fun, and really spend our time because I have really don’t want to get interrupted when it comes to a man like you,” and with that Sherlock reached back and stroked the older man’s inner thigh before gripping the man’s cock.  Sherlock smiled at the light gasp the man let loose, he looked around for the closest exit. Sherlock turned his head to whisper in the ear of the older man. “I know a place, it could be a little dangerous, but we will be alone.”   Sherlock felt the man smile against his skin.
John noticed Sherlock finally still, he took the kettle of water that was recently boiled and poured it into a bowl and he placed some metal tools into it, and he went to the freezer and pulled out some tools that he stuck in the freezer. At first he hated it when they first started doing all of these little experiments, hearing the tell tale moan that said Irene Adler was texting Sherlock. For some odd reason he thought Sherlock’s texting of her meant that Sherlock was also interested in learning what sex was like with a female assigned at birth body. And the jealousy did nag at him at first, but he found himself in a group text between Sherlock and Irene. Sherlock would list of a kink, Irene would explain it and ask John how he felt about it, and if he was down, she would help them navigate through what was needed to do it safely. And it was interesting because the exchange went both ways. At first John was anxious about sharing some of the things he always wanted to try, but Irene was all about promoting a conversation of no shame or guilt... which was funny given that they met her on a blackmailing case. And after Sherlock mentioned some rather risky kinks, it really wasn’t hard to make his own suggestions.
“A couple of traffic lights and timed crosswalks,” said the second officer.
Aithne huffed and quickly planted her feet on the ground, "other than the current conversation, you know I haven't done anything that warrants calling them right? I mean I don't make my colleagues edit the EHR when shit goes wrong. And I thought you said you liked your front hole too much to even consider phallo."
"Mycroft, I didn't, I, uh, i uh, I am trying to handle the things I can on my own. Why are you asking?" Asked Sherlock, visibly shaken, he dropped his phone and the leash. He is frozen mid step, he tries to fight it but the hallways start building themselves around his mind. In his mind he is trying to out run the walls but they just keep coming. He feels the earthmoving beneath him, and he is barely keeping up. Suddenly his mind goes blanks.
Sherlock strutted down the block following the map on the to warehouse. As he got closer he could feel the strong beats coming through the walls, good he thought, this is loud enough to scrabble his mind for a little bit. Sherlock pushes his way to the make shift bar. “Two corpse revivers with brandy.” He knew the warehouse pretty well, but it always felt different, maybe because the people and music was what made the place remarkable rather than the building itself.
“Oooh yes, tell me more, tell me more,” said Jeanine is a slight sing song matter.
“Amazing,” said John.
Sherlock burst through the door it had been almost 72 hours since either John or William saw him, but they knew he was working in the lab and best not be bothered in those moments. “Let me guess you did another name pun,” said Sherlock as he looked at the incredibly grumpy John. He noticed the disaster on the kitchen table and smiled, it was almost on par with what Sherlock did before the basement lab. “William, apologize to your dad and explain your problem.”  Sherlock plopped down in his chair making the face he often did when listening to a client.
“So William, did you have a good birthday?” asked John.
Sherlock enthusiastically nodded, because while he usually didn’t like playing with the possibility of getting John covered in shit. He did like John helping him get prepared. So he got off the toilet and entered the shower with John. He leaned against the wall arching his back, he let out a moan as John breached his hole with the shower shot, flooding his bowels with warm water. He sighed contently as John started to stroke his cock while tracing a finger around his hole. And he panicked a little as he realized just how  full of water John made him. He could feel some slight cramping.
Sherlock braced himself on all fours, squaring his shoulders and arching his back slightly. His moans only got louder.
“Well I could but I do need to establish that I mean business,” replied Mycroft, pulling out a handkerchief and holding it to his face. “And please don’t call me Mikey.”
“Oh honey, that just means you have things to learn about yourself,” Said John with a wide smile.
Sherlock gasped, as the fresh air hit his sweat soaked hair and face. He could see his reflection in one of the surfaces of the machinery in the shed. His hair was poofy and frizzy from the humidity in the hood. Still he was struggling from the headrush of being upside down. He took deep breaths as he could but he was so full that it almost didn’t feel like a possibility for him.  That struggle for air only got worse as his Daddy started fucking his face while firmly keeping a hand on his throat. Finally his Daddy shot his load and pulled back, Sherlock sputtered but tried to swallow his Daddy’s cum but still it hurt so much to breath, he needed to be able to breath fully. He needed the tentacle out of him. “Daddy, please…”
Ella looked at Sherlock wide eyed, "so is there any kind of business you don't have someone who owe you a favor."
Andrea sighed, “Okay we call it, Ella hit five. We can discuss the terms of the agreement now or tomorrow morning. We can meet you for breakfast or you can come in the afternoon, we don't know how your sundays look."
Sherlock nodded, “Yes, I think I want to try that.”
“If I can get a drink and dance, I don’t fucking care about the set,” snipped Sherlock.
"It is kind of irrational, and I know it is a huge risk, but I can't just leave her," replied Aithne.
Dad leaned into William’s personal space, “I bet a Dylan dollars, that you feel much better after that sandwich.” Dad laughed, “get it a Dylan dollars, like a million dollars!”
Sherlock had Rosie napping on his lap with Toby curled up on his feet.
He sighed, and noticed the passing of time, and how he was in the restroom for a suspiciously long time. He got up, washed his hands and exited the bathroom. He looked around to see if the coast was clear before swiftly turning the corner. When suddenly he was covered in confetti, and a rather rude song started playing on a speaker being held up by a testing volunteer. It was a rather large group of them.
Sherlock perfectly held the condom in his mouth until it was completely rolled onto John’s cock. He moaned as John kept fucking his mouth, he tried to stay as quiet as he could but with every thrust he couldn’t stop a little sound escaping from him. Sherlock raised a hand to the side of his throat and held down, he felt instantly lightheaded as he pressed down on the carotid vein, which temporarily shut off oxygen to his brain, but as soon as he released the vein he would quickly recover. He figured he couldn’t be making sounds if he was to pass out.
a chair to the stove, and placed a large sauce pan to heat. He gently measured out the various ingredients and set to work. it slowly became smooth paste, and eventually it became a smooth dough. He put the dough aside in a bowl.
“Yes it is Irene and her wife, Kate, asking if we want to visit them in San Francisco during September for Folsom Street Fair. She is also asking who was Top or did we switch fuck? She is also asking about your cock. I am not sure how to reply,” Said Sherlock as he read his messages. “Oh there is one from my parents asking when the wedding date is?”
Sherlock sat down next to John and smiled. He pressed a quick kiss to John’s cheek, a rare public display of affection that was initiated by Sherlock that was more than just the holding of hands.
The woman laughed, “oh honey, if we were talking about the 90’s to early 2000’s when phones were mostly plastic, yes that observation would make sense, because it would take a lot to actually scratch those phones. These days with the fight for lighter and lighter phones, material have changed to metal and glass. Those materials make your phone are easier to scratch. Henceforth what used to be a rather smart observation is no longer applicable.”
"Well I went to Oxford for college, and I was on the fencing team. I am just going to assume that you did martial arts of some form to get into the kind of work you do. And given that you carry an sword umbrella one could assume some form of fencing was one of your martial arts, because the only kind of sword that could possibly fit and umbrella unnoticed would be the ones found in the forms of fencing," continued Ella.
Sherlock smirked as he manage to get the whole thing in his mouth, he grazed the tip of John’s fingers with his tongue. He chewed and swallowed the meat stick and opened his mouth to show John that he ate it all.
“Sherlock if you can’t do it, you can either have the really dry hand job and hope things work out or I can help but take away five of your strokes,” said John taking a step forward spreading Sherlock's legs, he leaned in trapping Sherlock’s erection between the two of them.
John handed Solomon the letter from Ella. "An apartment, we live on the second floor but the apartment itself is 2 floors as well," said John.
Kate and Irene laughed.
“Yeah the outfits and location really don’t help,” Said John bursting out in laughter. A moan was heard, John raised an eyebrow,
The next time group met, Willow was over the moon, she had gotten to her appointment with the youth clinic, only to find out that her parents changed their mind with out telling her. The doctors administered the first dose of luprone immediately, since she was getting dangerously close to the cut off period. She said that she was glad, her parents changed her mind, and figured that if they didn’t tell her, then she won’t say anything about it, because she knew how her parents were. She was also glad that her parents never accompanied her to the clinic room and she could talk freely with the medical providers. William was rather pleased to hear the news.
Sherlock turned to John, “wait, you want me to have parenting rights for Rosie?
Sherlock stood at the door to his building, “so really Irene, what do you want?”
"I am not going to be one of your clients," replied Mycroft.
“No, we are going to keep you nice and whole, and I am not trying to kink shame you, but that was worrisome,” Said John, he gripped Sherlock’s thigh rather harshly. “Maybe some day I can see how far I can stretch you, I am sure that will give you the sensation of being torn apart if you want that.”
"Yes well she has a program in San Francisco in the States, and she apparently got along with Eurus that one time we tried to set you all up on a play date. And well we thought maybe we could give it a try," said Siger. "Also the program has an extremely high success rate for what it is, and well it is worth a try."
John turned to Sherlock, "why are you in on that?"
The man opened the folder revealing a blurry picture of John and Sherlock on the roof, “sir, it looks like you know him at least biblically.”
John finally stopped laughing and he picked up a frozen training knife. He knew the knife would cut Sherlock but Sherlock didn’t know it. He dragged the edge of the knife up and down his body. Finding Sherlock’s movements to be really fascinating because he was really responsive to the touch. John picked up a training knife that was in the hot water. And this time when he did the initial drag he pushed a little harder and the hot water ran down the blade. Almost on the same pattern as one would bleed from a wound and that made Sherlock practically jolt off the table. John smiled, as he dragged the hot blade up and down Sherlock’s body. He found Sherlock’s writhing to be absolutely fascinating. Sherlock’s cock was absolutely dripping, and the writhing of his body caused drops of pre-cum to fly. John forced the idea of having to clean it out of his mind temporarily. He continued dragging the training blades of different temperatures up and down Sherlock’s body in hopes that the sensory deprivation and the rapid temperatures changes would confuse Sherlock’s brain into thinking John was messing around with something significantly more dangerous.
Sherlock nodded and pressed the clicker.
Rudy nodded, “and Sherlock will never know what I do, that’s his brother’s burden. But yes I posted bail for the two of you. I mean surely you could’ve waited just a bit more to go back to your flat rather than fucking in the clinic’s fire escape. This is your only time, I’m not going to tell your brother or your parents but next time you decide to pull such a stunt I am letting Mycroft handle that mess, and you know he is going to lord over you with that for ages to come.
Sherlock gestured towards the bedside drawer, John opened it, only to be greeted with an absurd amount of stuff ranging from candy wrappers to coins to scraps of paper to a variety of small jars, he forgoed the unlabeled jars because he didn’t want to risk it, he considered the vaseline but skipped it when he came across a jar of coconut oil which John assumed Sherlock kept for his hair... or he didn’t know maybe some general moisturizer. He really couldn’t imagine Sherlock wanking. Hopefully he wouldn’t mind the use.
Sherlock smiled back and got off of John’s lap, he removed his leather jacket, and started tugging John into the direction of his bedroom, “let’s not accidentally mortify Mrs. Hudson with our ventures,”
Sherlock looked up at John with a look of satisfaction. He tried to get up but he staggered a bit but his hands never left the position John demanded it be in. His legs were shaking from the strain of being on his knees in such an uncomfortable spot, his trousers were ruined not just from rolling around in the alley but also from the blossoming wet spot on his crotch. He gasped when John poked at the wet spot, but started moaning as John started  lightly stroking his rock hard cock through his trousers. “Please Captain I want to really feel you,” begged Sherlock.
Mike nodded yes at John and smiled.
Mycroft nodded and took a mental note to narrow the search to doctors in the army with the last name Watson. “Thanks you for the information, also is the arguing a contributing factor to why Sherlock doesn’t like going to that particular group given that it seems like it would be the best match.”
Sherlock shook his head, took a deep breath, "I don't know if anything I hate repeating myself, maybe we can do a thing where I tell you but like John can hear everything but like it isn't eavesdropping because I want him to hear it?
The bedazzled twink nodded in agreement, “yes, I’m a make up artist, completed the MAC and Bobbi Brown programs at Academy of Freelance Make Up, I usually do fashion week, photography shoots, TV make up, and of course formal events if they got the coin. Go ahead touch me, this glitter is so set that it won’t move unless I want it to, but yes definitely Kyrolan. Babe, you got one hell of a set of eyes on you.”
“I don’t know John are you planning to be a total cock?” Replied Mike, “But the crossbow harness obscure the logos well enough. You know people would appreciate the chest harnesses a lot more if you don’t wear a shirt.”
Mycroft wrinkled his nose at her language usage, she didn't exactly sound smart or even polite. "Her name is Eurus Holmes."
Sherlock was moaning rather loudly, and taking in the sensation of being penetrated. He already felt rather sensitive to the point of mild discomfort because he already came but the pleasure he felt from John made the discomfort practically disappear. At the same time he could feel the coil inside him begin again but in a new way, he wasn’t exactly sure if he had a refractory period but maybe coming from penile stimulation and coming from anal stimulation are two different things.
"No, Crystal is making one of the billionaires they Fi-Doms lend them a jet," replied Aithne.
Rosie looked at Mycroft holding another biscuit.
Solomon nodded, "okay, I think all of them are fine with that, but Bosco might need a bit more play time because he can get easily bored and that's when he goes into the food, but when he is on the clock he is a good dog. Maybe we can have Sherlock be the deciding factor? Shall we go out for a walk?" Bosco, Toby, and Bopper all looked at Solomon enthusiastically.  Solomon rolled towards a closet, that Golem opened for him.  Solomon whistled and pointed at a shelf, Golem reached up and pulled down a box. He clicked the clicker four times, and Bosco, Toby, and Bopper lined up. Solomon pulled out some blue vests that said "service dog" on it and placed one on each. He fitted each dog with a vest and a lead and handed all the leads to Sherlock.
Andrea stood to the side of the strip and in the middle. "First to five touches wins, if we get a double touch that is automatically void. En garde!"
John was slightly amused at the turn of events,but he could sense a level of nervousness radiating from Sherlock. He gently pushed Sherlock back, “sherlock, please be honest with me, but are you nervous, because we can easily just take our time, if you want. Being with you is enough.” He smiled at Sherlock as he stared at John with a look of confusion.
John was walking down the hall to the emergency clinic. When he got the text, “meet me at the toilets on the 2nd floor?” He blushed, and responded, “it will take me 10 minutes to get to the clinic and probably 30 minutes to introduce myself and get to know all the staff. That leaves me with 20 minutes.”
Kayla nodded, "that's indeed correct on the cab front. And it is good to see that you and Toby work out pretty intuitively, I mean our model is a bit unusual, but ultimately we aim to train all the standards to a well trained service dog, but we specialize further when they get picked. A lot of times we get people coming in for Assistance dogs, but we get a lot of people coming in for Autism or epilepsy dogs, so we got a lot of that training as well. The one we do try to prioritize is folks with multiple diagnoses, because well we can have a lot leeway to pick out what works for people. We are trying to focus on mixes because well unless we can really trust the breeder, things happen. I mean as far as it goes we aim to have as fairly fast integration. Is it okay if I just shadow you for a little bit?"
“Sherlock you can always tell me when you don’t want to do something okay,” Said John. He stroked his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. “You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do.” He leaned down and kissed Sherlock. “Was there anything else you didn’t like?”
“Oh you think you’re so fucking great with all your fucking war hero shit and you being a fucking doctor, but guess what you are nothing you ain’t got either of that shit anymore,” yelled Harry.
John nodded, and removed his boxer briefs, his boner made a smacking sound as it hit his stomach, he hasn’t been that hard in ages. He sat up, and smiled at Sherlock who was still awkwardly kneeling on the bed. “How about you take off your underwear and come over here?”

“Ugh, you know what congrats, and Nugget, I hope you are actually hitting that, because no one could ever get William to bed in all senses of the word, the fucking tease,” the rude man stomped away.
William looked closer, at the two rings they were made from bullets and had dates engraved in them. “What are they from? The dates must have significance, especially if you keep them on you so much.”
“Okay true, selling tainted product would’ve gotten us into a lot of trouble and his creepy guardian did make us that offer we would’ve been foolish to turn down.”
“One!” Said Sherlock and he brought a bite of food to his mouth and chewed, he opened his mouth to John and showed that he swallowed the bite. “two!” Sherlock repeated the process. Somewhere around bite number 10, Sherlock slowed down as he remembered just how much this reminded him of being out in the countryside, the doctors always insisted on checking that Sherlock wasn’t cheeking the meds. Unfortunately during med time there was no way he could dispose of the meds without swallowing. He spent a week trying forcing himself to vomit, but a rather annoying doctor placed “potential bulimia” on his chart. And the staff was suggesting a feeding tube would come into play if he didn’t stop. So he stopped with the vomiting.
Sherlock reached out for John's arm, "no we tried apart and it was terrible, and as far as it goes we are both in treatment and giving it all we can, we are giving it the best possible try we can. I don't want to see you go."
Ella smiled, "you know I think you both can actually benefit from having a service dog."
Which made John feel a flash of panic but immediately pulled the hood off Sherlock and waited for him to catch his breath and stop dangerously flailing before unstrapping Sherlock and pulling him into a hug.
John started laughing, “great idea, but awful execution,” he smiled at the look Sherlock gave him, it made him look ridiculously young, he looked hopeful but also there was little bits of ‘did I do something wrong’ cracking through. John took a deep breath and rolled off Sherlock. He took a moment to put himself in the right head space and went with the voice he usually used when he was giving orders back on the base, “Private what the hell is wrong with you? What made you think you lay hands on a commanding officer, you deserve all the pain you are feeling right now, stand with your back against the wall.”
Mycroft sighed, “tell me something I don’t know, I could always just run the facial recognition but that will take ages I want something to narrow it down.”
"Oh shit, Sherlock, you went full fairy!"
"Oh wait Dr Thompson, I am no longer suicidal and have no plans for such, but you have to admit if someone needed to have a gun, we would be a reasonable candidate for such," said John.
Sherlock frowned, "I thought people are supposed to outgrow those?"
John watched him walk away with a bit of affection, “oh he is going to ruin me, and I am going to love ever moment of it. Hey, what the fuck!” John turned around to look at what hit him. It was a hose.
John smirked as he followed Sherlock out the door, he noticed that Sherlock definitely paid for the meal but also gave Molly an incredibly generous tip. John looked around and realized they were in an alley, it was lacking in light and beyond the ever present sight of cctv. John turned Sherlock, and smiled.
Sherlock grinned a rather stupid smile at John because he liked what he saw. He was struggling slightly to breath, because of the weight of John on his chest, but he would be more than glad to stop breathing if it meant he could get his mouth around that gorgeous cock. He felt around his belt for one particular keychain.
Sherlock struggled with the sensation, “yellow… Daddy the ropes slid.”
Sherlock was absolutely gleeful to be having so many dogs. He knew he probably should pick one. He handed the two of the leashes to John, and proceeded to walk with Bosco, for the walk up the block. Bosco's ear movements amused Sherlock because it was all the flop of Beagle ears trying to sweep the ground to increase the scent  but was also twitching and moving much like a corgi trying to hear everything. He thought that it would be pretty good for when he had to track someone or something down but at the same time he was compact enough to take places with little effort. The got to the park. Sherlock nodded and turned to John, "I like Bosco, I think he will be good at sniffing things out while also staying alert. But I am going to still try the others."
Sherlock sighed, “can’t you just hold me a bit longer.”
Violet looked at Mycroft with a touch of concern, "Mycroft, you have been protecting us since you were young, you had to shoulder the burden of knowing Eurus was still alive for all this time. You apparently have a huge amount of influence in global affairs. But after all that what else do you have to protect us from?"
Kayla clapped her hands, "that is the first time I've ever seen a pup go on command in front of a new owner."
“Maybe we can make things easier and just get Mycroft back into the car, that way he can meet Ella in person. Save yourself the paperwork,” joked Danny.
Sherlock sighed, “Yes William, that is a solid argument, and I grant the motion.” He gestured at the paper, which William gleefully signed.
“The answer is no,” repeated John.
Wiggins shrugged, “nah your brother made me an offer I couldn’t refused. So if you looking for a plug, I am no longer your man.  Given that all your other usual plugs for the hard stuff have disappeared I am guessing I’m lucky.”
Sherlock was curled up on the foot of his bed sleeping with a hood he recently came across in a case and that was the only thing he was wearing beside his boxer briefs. The case that lead to him finding about the hood was essentially a standard blackmail case where someone was taking photos of folks in the BDSM scene of London, in particular parents, and threatening to expose their proclivities to the school’s boards of some of the kids who attending schools that had strict moral codes for the families attending, the perpetrator of the crime was actually a set of parents who was upset that their child was expelled from multiple schools and rather than face the issue that was their own child they decided to target the other families they thought unworthy of attending the schools that their child was expelled from. One family in particular stuck out to him.
Dr. Aithne Hunter stared at her brother Blaze, as he sat across the table pouring over lab reports. "So what do you think?"
Kayla nodded and wrote more in her notebook. "Okay well I better start heading back to the college, see you tomorrow." She waved good bye at Sherlock and pet Toby on her head. "Also, you can't have her out with a vest by yourself until you past your test." She removed the vest and Toby flopped over on her side. "You did a good job today, time for belly rubs!"
John grabbed a towel and placed it in the drier to make it all warm and toasty. He went into Rosie's room and put away some of the spare toys lying on the floor. He brought out a pair of pajamas and brought it back to the bathroom, grabbing the warmed towel on the way. He walked into the bathroom to see that the bathtub was painted in many different colors. He laughed because Sherlock for the past couple of weeks was trying to figure out a way to make Rosie like baths, and this seemed to be his most outlandish effort yet. “Sherlock I don’t think baths are supposed to make kids more dirty.”
Violet and Siger approached the door and motioned for Sherlock to go back to the couch.
“It looks like I did,” replied Sherlock, “and apparently it cool that we still like each other.” He changed into some more conventional clothing.
Siger nodded his head in agreement with his wife.
Mycroft took a deep breath and took some strides to the car waiting for him. "Anthea, I do hate not having all the info, and as much as I hate doing legwork, I think I am going to have to do it. Can you give me all the info you possibly have on Dr. Ella Thompson? In particular I need to know where she is holding her case notes, because she doesn't electronically hold her case notes. She only uses ICD codes for entering it into billing. I need more info than that."
“What?!?
“Oh g-d I feel like such a teenager, I haven’t cum in my pants since I was 17. But how about you?”  John noted that Sherlock was still sporting a bit of boner himself, “I can help you with that if you want.”
“Just so you know I am not opposed the idea Sherlock, but we don’t have to rush it,” said John.
Sherlock was moaning as John swallowed him down. He couldn’t believe this was actually happening and with out the awkward conversations as well. This made Sherlock extremely happy, but he felt his orgasm quickly approaching, he attempted to push John off, but John only held his head down and swallowing Sherlock completely.
Sherlock nodded and darted straight to John’s room and quickly toweled off and got dressed as John did the same. Sherlock had to admire just how fast John managed to change, he didn’t even notice that John managed to change into a dry shirt and things rarely escaped Sherlock like that, he was starting to get very, very curious about the skin that hid underneath all layers. Sherlock let out a little gasp when John grabbed his hand and took him out of the bed sit with a ridiculous amount of speed and stealth. Sherlock almost wanted to cause a scene to speed up John getting kicked out but he knew that wasn’t good and would only cause John to be angry at him.
“You can use your hands, soldier.” Said Sherlock with a low moan.
John raised his leg and placed his foot against Sherlock’s cock, “I don’t fuck rude people.”
“Yes, but pretend I didn’t say anything,” Said Mycroft brushing himself off. “Actually just pretend this meeting never happened. Pack up, I’d offer you a ride but he would accuse me of meddling.”
John was amused at the hitched breath Sherlock took, he was so flustered, and quite frankly John found it adorable. “After we are done eating, we are going to find a nice dark little corner and each bite is going to equal a stroke. It is up to you what the definition of stroke means.”
John was close to cumming, and he picked up the speed of his thrusts chasing that release. He quickly grabbed Sherlock by the hips again and started to really pound into him, he was letting some rather undignified grunts loose, but he didn’t care it just felt too damn good, anyways Sherlock was being equally loud and it wasn’t like anyone would be able to notice them over the sound of the rave. John delivered one last final thrust into Sherlock before just stopping the ride out the tail end of his orgasm, he stroked Sherlock’s cock all the way through it but by the time he soft again, sherlock was still hard.  John didn’t want Sherlock to be left hanging. He stood up, Sherlock letting out a small whine when he slipped out.  John quickly found a second condom amongst Sherlock’s stuff. He roughly grabbed Sherlock by the ankle and flipped him on to his back.
Papa was look in at William with a small bit of frustration, but also understanding since Sherlock had done the exact same thing multiple times. “William, you need to remember to turn off the stove, every time you use it. Also what are you doing? Judging by the colors I am assuming these are all for Valentines Day. Which I still think is a little odd for 9 years olds to be celebrating in school. Also we already made those star shaped crayons for everyone in your class. I know you like school, but surely you don’t need to do more?”
John turned to Sherlock and slipped Sherlock’s jacket off, it was rather heavy and he was rather surprised how Sherlock was functioning at all with all that leather. He felt Sherlock trying to remove his trousers by gently nudging them down. He moved on to removing Sherlock’s pants which rather quickly dropped to the floor as soon as it was unbuckled. John found himself gawking at Sherlock when he realized that Sherlock was wearing a rather appealing leather jock strap. “Sherlock, that can’t possibly be comfortable.” .
"Yeah life would be boring otherwise," said Andrea as she texted Mycroft the pertinent information. She smiled as she sent off the text.
John tried out being rough with Sherlock.
Kayla stopped laughing, "Sherlock, do you notice when Toby is barking at you?"
“Thanks, see you later,” added Amir.
John nodded, "sure that would be absolutely fine, just tell me when you plan for it Sherlock."
“And for that I thank you,” said Blaze with a smile.
"It isn't when it works," replied Mycroft also getting in the starting positions.
"Your brother was right, there isn't many places that can take her, also it might be a wise idea to have her in an exceedingly different place, that way she can't slip into any old habits or patterns without making an extreme effort to make it happen," said Siger. "I mean we can visit her, maybe rent a house in the area while she is in Program there. I mean family interaction is part of the program, and we can be there the entire time, and you can make time to visit. We have a few friends in that area with access to university labs, maybe they can give you access privileges, that way to you don't get bored. Maybe if John
“Enough,” said Siger, “Mycroft, give your brother a chance. Sherlock, you try to see where he is coming from and try to talk with him to see where compromises can be made. Violet, you and I are going to have to really examine how we consider what ‘trying’ is in this family. Also nice use of “i” statements.”
"Sorry about that, I tend to slip up on non-binary terms, but I always got to keep working on that, because just because I am Trans doesn't stop me from still messing up with other trans and non-binary folks," said Blaze as he stared at the ground.
Sherlock and John settled in on their respective seats, “well at least they are comfortable,” said Sherlock.
Molly raised her hand, “Mike, I ran that person’s test, was there any errors I need to be aware of?”
John was tangled up with Bosco and Bopper. He turns around and notices Sherlock on the bench and his phone on the floor. He deduced that Sherlock had another one of his moments of uncontrolled visit to his mind palace again. He picked up the phone he caught a bit and pieces of Mycroft threatening Sherlock with more surveillance and even mentioning that he had video of him with his ex-girlfriends. John shuddered at the thought. "Ha, looks like we know which one we are taking home," said John. He picked the phone off the ground and said "Hey Mycroft, it's me John, sounds like you are busy, mind if we continuing this call some other time. But thanks for calling Sherlock almost wanted to take all the dogs, but during the call one of them really rose to the occasion. Feel free to come by for tea later, I have some words for you."
“Fuck off,” said Sherlock as he walked away flashing a two finger salute.
John looked at Mike with slight confusion and a weird slurry of emotions taking place in him, he knew Mike spoke the truth it just wasn't a truth he liked. He took a deep breath and just stared down Mike until he felt that eye contact probably should be broken, but he didn’t.
John sighed and pushed the cart away from the biscuits.
The teens added the contact points and plugged the cords in on both Mycroft and Ella and backed away.
“That really is a foolish thing to say when I am only one point away from beating you,” said Ella.
William glared at John, “Fine Dad, but it doesn’t have to be to your military standard.”
“They aren’t dangerous people, they are just people who went through trauma and they get fucking locked up because society isn’t willing to deal with the aftermaths of most of the trauma out there. Also I’m not going to lie, I already agreed to meet with Eurus to see if she is a candidate for the program," said Aithne.
Andrea and Ella watched Mycroft move around Ella's offices, they were waiting for Mycroft to crack the code, excited for what was next.
"Okay why can't Sherlock help without asking you, but you can keep spying in us god knows how long without our permission and you consider it protecting us. If we wanted protection we are more than capable of asking you for help," said John with a slight smirk on his face.
Aithne laughed, “Try that again, boy.”
“Hello this is Addi, just so you know I am no longer holding...” Said the voice on the other line.
Sherlock nodded enthusiastically into the mattress. He couldn’t decide what he wanted more, as he spent time alternating between rutting against the bed sheets or raising his hips to allow John to penetrate him even harder. He screamed into the pillow as John pinned him down completely as he slammed his cock into Sherlock continuously. The angle change combined with the force of John’s gave way to a different kind of pain, one that was rather confusing in how he was supposed to react to it; but eventually the pain gave way to pleasure and Sherlock’s screams turned to a muffled moan.
Sherlock grabbed John’s hand tightly it kept him grounded in the moment. They both took a deep breath together.
“And same for the fishnets, I always wanted a pair but I am too tall for anything I find in the shops,” said Ryver.
John looked between the head and Sherlock, “I mean I guess, do you have any one I can call to confirm that was how you acquired the head.”
His dad let off a short laugh, “William, you’re home early. I take it the movies you wanted to see were all sold out.” Thankfully his dad was dressed perfectly normal. He stepped to the side, and Sherlock tried to slyly crawl away, the teens all watched in stunned silence as William’s parents slunk away into their bed room.
John blushed as he picked up the hose and started rinsing the mess Sherlock and him caused. He knew that he was most likely on the edge of something special.
“Okay fine,” the man stood up and went toe to toe with John. “Sherlock is not a man who makes friends very easily nor do people ever like him enough to stay pass all his little observations and insults. And even though he doesn’t admit it, he does indeed fall apart when people leave him. He just got out of rehab, and he is quite elastic on building connections when he gets out. So he will forget about you if we pull the bandaid off, so give me any city in the world that isn’t London and I’ll assure you that you will have a comfortable place to live and a job I am sure you will enjoy. Take the offer, because if you cause him to relapse I am going to make sure no one finds your body and you are just going to exist as a fleeting memory of a few people.
Aithne smiled at her dad, “thanks dad.” She turned to Athina, Joey, Josephine, and Wolf and paused to try and think of a way to explain who Eurus was to them that was simple and not likely to talk about Eurus in a way that made them feel safe about her attempt to take Eurus to her program. “Okay as kids all five of us were sheltered or isolated depending on who you asked, we were raised on the family estate and given that mom’s concern that we weren’t going to get a decent education at the local school because of how dismissive they were of Francis’s need for additional help for dyslexia and Scott’s issues with ADHD and general disinterests in most subjects outside of math, science, and literature, she went with home schooling. Well she wasn't the only family who did the same thing, there was the Holmes family, our moms both worked at the same university and took leave around the same time to raise kids. So there was a chance meeting at the university library when they were both coming in to get books for teaching us. So they arranged a play date. Because they had three kids who rarely had contact with other children and there was the four of us at the time,” Aithne, she shrugged her shoulders and took a sip from her wine glass.
John offered his hand and Sherlock took it, "Sherlock I am going to stay here with you, but thanks for giving me that option."  John squeezed Sherlock's hand tightly and smiled. He turned on the kettle. Essentially setting the clock on a time to return to the awkwardness in the sitting room.
“Pretty Boy, we were just checking up on you, that’s just what friends do,” said Irene.
Solomon laughed, "yeah that tends to happen. Okay so is there a particular activity level you want out of them?"
Aithne scowled, “they’re going to do a great job their decisions haven’t failed us yet.”
“Yes sir,” Said Sherlock shifting uncomfortably as his weight came to fully rest on his knees.
John tried not to thrust even though Sherlock’s mouth was rather enticing and warm. He held himself still as he possibly could despite Sherlock lapping enthusiastically at his sensitive tip. John let out a low moan, he knew better than to wake Sherlock up when he was like this because sleep was such a rarity for Sherlock. But his self control was quickly put to the rest as Sherlock started to bob his head in a way that John found absolutely hard to resist. It wasn’t enough though, because Sherlock just wasn’t taking enough of his cock in. John gently started to tug on Sherlock’s hair to keep him still, but still Sherlock persisted on getting as much cock as possible in him. John just had to admire the effort; but he found himself longing to have Sherlock awake for this. John always loved the way Sherlock looked at him as he came, Sherlock always looked so proud at doing that, and he thought people really didn’t praise him enough when he was younger. Which is probably why he was so eager to please and show off. But suddenly he felt Sherlock push forward to suck down even more of his cock. John tightened his grip to pin Sherlock in place. He wanted to remind Sherlock he was the one in control at this moment but it was a losing battle, Sherlock kept pushing to take in even more of John’s cock and it was as if nothing was going to stop him.
The older man leaned over close enough to Sherlock that they were nose to nose, and whispered, “if it helps, my name is John. And I would really like to know the name I am going to be shouting when I cum all over your face.”
Sherlock wasn’t sure where he wanted it, he liked the idea of John’s cum mixing with his against both of their bodies, but on the other hand letting John cum in him would let John reach into him in new and absolutely intimate ways. Oh... that sounded like a great idea,
By the time they made it to 221 B, Rosie was already napping.
“Let’s be real the Captain is packing some real heat down there, I mean with those arms and thighs I bet he can really take you for one hell of a ride,” said Greyson.
“Hopefully it will but who is going to be the next gay boy is she going to crush on,” replied Kate. “The sooner she gives up on boys the sooner she’ll be happier.”
Aithne shook her head, "no. But answer me honestly, your brother if given a chance would you in good conscience get him out of his institution and bring him to your home?"
"Yeah I wouldn't want him having the info either, he has a delightful skill at picking apart people and ruining them," said Danny the driver.
"Violet, dear, what are you planning?" Said, Siger, not being quite sure if she was planning something good or something bad, and that concerned him.
“No, Sherlock, you are not measuring me again!” snapped John.
John sighed, but he quickly turned to smiles as he saw William and Sherlock proceeded to melt the seams, and taking apart the car. Sherlock showed William, how to screw the pullback motor back into place. John thought it all adorable to see William and Sherlock repair the car that was until, Sherlock taught William how to use the flint striker to light the torch and now John was terrified. “Sherlock, are you sure that is a good idea?”
Mycroft gritted his jaw for a beat before responding, "Mother, I can assure you that every citizen of the U.K. Has to live with some level of surveillance. This is perfectly normal."
Sherlock came back to the room holding Rosie, “John we’ve only been together officially as a couple for two weeks and you are already talking with my parents about marriage?”
Mycroft shrank into the chair as if to try avoiding the conversations with his parents by hiding.
John quickly pinched Sherlock’s nose, “Mrs. Hudson and Rosie are downstairs and we don’t need Rosie hearing her daddies fucking nor do we need Mrs. Hudson getting all the juicy details about our sex life together.” He was amused by the strangled sound of Sherlock trying to catch his breath but between the dildo and John’s efforts, Sherlock was not going to get enough in. The look of panic on Sherlock’s face only made John feel more aroused and he still wasn’t comfortable with the idea of just how much pleasure John got out of making Sherlock suffer. There was also something about the fact that Sherlock trusted John that much that soothes that discomfort, because it couldn’t be that bad; if the rough treatment was something Sherlock asked for, because these past couple of weeks Sherlock was getting increasingly bratty and complaining about how John just wasn’t being rough enough, but the fact was John had to make himself ready for being like that with Sherlock because he was still appalled with himself over beating him the morgue that one time.
John started licking broad strokes all over his chest. He pulled back out of Sherlock’s arms, he pulled out a set of gloves from his holster, and smirked as he put them on under Sherlock’s questioning gaze. He opened another packet of lube, and drizzled it over his hands.  He slammed Sherlock against the wall behind them, and used his knee to spread Sherlock’s legs, he reached a hand behind Sherlock’s  and started stroking that soft spot behind his balls and occasionally brushing against Sherlock's asshole. John sucked in a deep breath when he felt Sherlock pushing down on his hand. John inserted a finger slowly in, enjoying the sounds coming out of Sherlock, he was incredibly responsive and john was in awe that he was making Sherlock come apart like that. John wondered if he could be so distracted that he forgets the count. He inserted another finger into Sherlock, gently stretching him open. John laughed as Sherlock's knees buckled and Sherlock hissed at the scrape of the brick down his back. John hooked his fingers, pressing against his prostate, Sherlock gracelessly flailed pressed his weight against John.
Sherlock picked up the phone and called the morgue, “hi mike, can you please confirm to my friend John that I legally obtained the head that is currently residing in my fridge.” He squirmed uncomfortably as more pre-cum leaked from his cock.
Chapter 2
"You can, I just saw my therapist this morning," said John.
“Wait you know Irene? When I travel for work to San Francisco, I always go to her wife’s shop, they sell pajamas, lounge wear, and other appealing kinds of clothing if you know what I mean. Kate owns the shop, while Irene is a somatic therapist who and they throw parties of a certain kind. They are a rather delightful couple, they foster queer teens from a local shelter and also let folks recovering from surgery crash at their place, they got a lovely victorian home,” replied Harry, rather confused by the rather hard to read faces of John and Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded, “can I go and make the call.”
Sherlock nodded, “I’m glad we are together too, but what this is, is more than I was expecting out of my life.” He got on the sofa next to John and laid his head on John’s lap, while raising his legs on the couch.
“What do you mean by that?” Exclaimed John looking at Mike. “I think i’ve had enough adventure for an entire lifetime.”
“Thank you sir,” said Sherlock. He slowly lowered his arms shaking them to revive some circulation into them. “Well you did say no one would question if I was just in my underwear, i’m going to take that as a challenge,” added Sherlock as he unbuttoned and shrugged off his shirt.  He smiled at the hungry stare John gave him. He swallowed, almost missing the weight of John’s cock down his throat. He hissed when his cock was finally freed from his pants.
Solomon smiled, "okay is there any that is a definite no?"
“I am not about to piss the bed,” Replied John. “Why would you even invest in water proof sheets?” He felt Sherlock awkwardly shift. “Let me guess you want to see me take a piss.”
Kayla grabbed the vest and stuffed it into her backpack, "yeah I am just going to take this with me so we don't have you running around with a vested dog without passing your test."
Hiram started, “Athina and Aithne was supposed to distract her, but that was when Athena decided to mention that she was going to be going to med school and already got in. And...”
Sherlock knew he was pushing it when he asked John to not just cut him but actually stab him, he knew John was hesitant... since after all he was a doctor, and “do no harm” is what most doctors do strive for. When John carefully strapped him down he wasn’t sure what John was going to do with him, and he allowed himself to fully engage in the lack of senses, his skin was absolutely lit with the urge to get something anything to touch him. And his vision was filled with rainbow tinged static. The first swipe of something cold and damp surprised him and the cold air drying his skin could be felt it was almost like he could feel each and every single individual skin cell reacting. But when he felt then cold metal slice into him and the feeling of the warm liquid that followed he practically orgasmed on the spot. He felt himself tense up in his binds and he even felt the slap of his cock against his stomach. He has gotten hard, incredibly fast and he felt a buzzing in his head from the sudden diversion of blood. But suddenly nothing, and with just a taste, he found himself wanting more
Irene laughed, “that’s true Sherlock is a bit of a mess, and he is always sticking his nose in things that aren’t his to mind, which of course just gives him more problems than he needs.”
"Dr. Thompson moderated but she tossed in some terms she thought would benefit us, but unless we talked about it, we couldn't be sure if it was a term she put or one of us out," replied Sherlock, he tried reaching for a Ginger Nut, but he didn't want to disturb Rosie, so he tried to bring the table closer using his leg, but Toby interceded by gently tugging the table closer. Sherlock smiled and patted Toby on the head, before grabbing a ginger nut. He pulled out the clicker and eyed it as if contemplating if he could get Toby to do it again.
"Arrest! That was a double touch," said Andrea.
John squeezed Sherlock, “okay I trust you, let’s get tested.” He cleared his throat and took a deep breath. “I mean if you’ll have me,” said John, as he started to unbutton his shirt.
Violet stopped staring at Sherlock and looked at John, "I believe so, one of primary school teachers was trying to decide if he was day dreaming or having seizures. We didn't look too much into it though because he seemed fine."
Sherlock smiled against John’s neck, “on me please.”
“Yeah what’s it to you?” Replied John.
"En Garde," announced Andrea.
John pulled Sherlock into a kiss, “and I am more than fine with you trying to figure out what you like.” He pulled out two towels and handed one to
Sherlock smiled and added a twisf to his hips as he went up and John’s length, occasionally swiveling his hips to hit other angles. “Come for me soldier,” he said before biting John’s neck hard enough to bruise. He was rather satisfied with himself because it would be rather hard to hide the bite with his placement, he couldn’t wait to be out in public because it was mark that said John had someone, and Sherlock was thrilled at the idea of being his someone.
Sherlock paused and glared at the man.
The kiss wasn’t in anyway graceful, and John smiled because this reminded him of a kiss he shared with one of the girls from the field hockey team. He wasn’t expecting it, but she tackled him after his rugby practice, asked him to go with her to the spring dance, and she suddenly went shy for beat, but followed up with a sloppy kiss that took his breath away. All his rugby mates made fun of him for the rest of the season after that, but it was still a damn good kiss.
Francis sighed, “yeah too late about that, she already is all up in the social media surrounding the announcement.”
John ran his fingers along the counters and felt a little bit of grease, he clicked his tongue. “Let’s add another spanking to count.”
John took a closer look and saw that the ropes did indeed shift around and was adding pressure to places his boy shouldn’t have been experiencing it. “I’m sorry, darling boy, let me fix that.” John quickly cut some ropes allowing his boy to get immediate safety while also making sure that the lengths were still of use. He lowered his boy to the ground gently massaging his limbs to increase blood flow.
Mycroft scoffed, "I think he is doing plenty of growing just fine, did you know him and John are together as a "couple", as of two weeks ago, and today they had a couple's therapy appointment mainly because Sherlock is afraid of chasing off John. Which is funny because when they were separated John had to be put on suicide watch and Sherlock kept relapsing every couple of days. Sherlock is just being over dramatic. And they are getting a service dog, I don't know what for but I am assuming it has to do with the nightmares because John does have quite the terrifying reaction to being woken up from his nightmares, it is enough to actually shake Sherlock. I don't know much about their sessions though because Dr. Thompson keeps things hand written and only gives the bare minimum to billing. Which I guess is fine given that most of her clientele are ex-armed forces and special-ops." Mycroft took a deep breath, also amused because his earlier comment about the billing codes was a lie there is a cluster of codes that basically mean the same thing, but he glared at his parents. "Is that why you are here? Is Sherlock putting you up to this, because last week he was also in here asking for a bit of space, something about boundaries being important for healthy relationships. As if Sherlock has boundaries there isn't hiding anything from that man."
“Is this about the flat mate situation?” Asked John mildly concerned that Mike was just yanking people out of the testing line for him.
Sherlock took a cup of that Molly was setting down on the table, “thank you.”
John laughed, “well I mean there is photographic evidence of it as well.”
Sherlock, just realized what he had just done, and couldn’t stop staring at that damn Scopolamine patch still hanging off the side of his head.  He took a deep breath and in his sternest, most authoritative voice he could muster, he said, “John I want you to forget today, I want you to forget the entire contents of this Wednesday. You are going to count up to 100, take off the patch from the side of your head, and you are going to go back to Mary, and you are going to forget that this day even happened. If anyone asks, you just had a normal day okay John, you are going to forget that this day ever happened.”
John who was rather exhausted from a rather ridiculous day at the clinic walked into their bedroom only to be greeted with a sight that caused him to take pause. “What the fuck, Sherlock?”
Ella narrowed her gaze at the two of them. "Okay now you got me worried again. Otherwise how have things been? I know that you both recently started sharing a room since Rosie turned 2 and john felt like she was too old to have her dad as a roommate. Has it brought up any issues?"
Aithne smirked, "I cannot write that script but I am sure I can find someone to do it. Do you still got that friend with the private jet?"
Sherlock looked at his hands, and gave a slight nod.
“Well we can just keep that option open, maybe you’ll need it as an office, all good couples have a bit of space,” Said Mrs. Hudson as she bounced down the stairs and opened the door.
Blaze sighed, "But for real though, why the fuck does my actions reflect on you in a setting where it is super awk. Still though you  to admit this still isn't as weird as the Holmes siblings, I mean I can just imagine the kind of drama that family has to deal with."
“Yes, John, they were okay, but it can be better,” said Sherlock as he waved his hand towards the giant mood and inspiration board currently splashed all over the sitting room.  “It is so close to being perfect, it just needs just one tweak.” Sherlock knew it was more than a little tweak, he was going to have to start completely from scratch. Sure bless John for trying to be budget conscious, but it truly wasn’t the time, after all you only get married once, well it wasn’t ideal, but it made John happy, and Sherlock would do anything to make John happy.
Eventually the time came for all his friends to go, and Sherlock gave them all money to take taxis instead of the underground. The teens all said that they had a great time, and his parents made themselves disappear when it Phineas kissed him good night.
John was furiously fucking away at Sherlock’s throat when he pulled the snap on his cock ring. He was overtaken by his orgasm and was making some rather obscene sounds as he did it. He heard a knock agains the floorboards.
“Only if you want to be,” said Sherlock as he gingerly rested a hand on his shoulder. “But just so you know I’ve considered myself completely yours for quite some time.”
Sherlock shrugged and pulled Rosie a bit higher in his grip, “I am doing quite well mum, I haven’t gotten in any trouble lately and while I haven’t been doing to many cases these days I have found other ways to occupy my time.” He was still holding John’s hand.
She wanted to try different, she was going to make this evaluator believe that she was ready for the outside world no matter what it took. She almost didn’t care where they would take her, there was a lot of world to see. She was in the belly of a secret prison island, there was only looking up at this point.
“Can I touch it?” Asked Sherock looking af John rather intently.
Mrs. Hudson replied, "oh you know I do enjoy my scratch cards and herbal soothers."
John grabbed the dildo and tapped it on Sherlock’s lips which instantly parted. John watched them both in the mirror as he slowly pushed the dildo down Sherlock’s throat, he found the outline of the dildo going down Sherlock’s throat absolutely arousing and it only made him thrust into Sherlock at an even more punishing rate, John could see Sherlock’s stomach move with each thrust and he could make the outline of his cock moving through Sherlock’s body and that was fucking hot.
John turned on the shower, “I think I actually moving that into green column.” He started lathering up a sponge and started scrubbing down Sherlock as Sherlock was busy trying to wash his hair.
John and Sherlock have just finished case and they decide to indulge in some incredibly filthy pig play. John plans fo push Sherlock to his limits during this session.
"I don't want any more," said Mycroft.
Before the morning after.
"Actually John I was wondering if I could just go in with my pants on," said Sherlock with a slight grin.
Ella looked at Sherlock, "is that something that happens a lot?"
Sherlock looked at john.
“Joey, you do know what happened to Jamie right?” Said Francis slightly concerned.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Two points Ella, zero points Mycroft," announced Andrea. As Mycroft and Ella took their spots and took stance. Andrea raised her hand, "Allez!" She called out as she dropped her hand.
Sherlock was still bouncing on John’s slowly softening cock, and he was amused at how quickly John shut up at the introduction of Sherlock’s continued stimulation to John’s highly sensitive post orgasm cock. He pressed on despite the fact that John started to wiggle uncomfortably under Sherlock. He started to feel really close to orgasm at this point, he reared back and started wanking away at his cock, he enjoyed the John’s rather adoring look, and he was overcome with the need to kiss him or mark him. His started to cum and he covered John’s chest with a rather spectacular amount of spunk, some even managed to John’s face, and he knew he was going to have to cum all over that face someday. “Mine,” he said as he started smear his cum accross John’s chest. He leaned over John and started kissing him again.
“John, the patch that you managed to get stuck to the side of your head is one of my anti-nausea patches, it has an unusual side effect for those who don’t need it,” answer Sherlock as he measured John around the chest. He tried to even out his breathing despite this being the first time in a long time that he was touching John, and despite his best efforts, he did miss this. The casual touches between friends.
“Fair point, Aithne, but she seemed really interested in your program,” replied Hiram, absolutely beaming at his daughter.
"My, did your brother make a request for privacy and you just decided to steamroll right over that request?" Asked Violet, inside she was smiling to hear about John and Sherlock, but of course she is probably going to have to wait to hear it from Sherlock himself before saying anything. At the same time it was a bit distressing to see how much Mycroft knew about Sherlock's life.
Sherlock nodded, he could just feel himself blushing even more, he wasn’t sure how he felt about John taking a look.
“So Francis told me I needed to make sure she didn't get to the church, but she fucking tasered me,” said Joey. “And well the cops came by and took me away because they just assumed I tried to attack her henceforth the taser.”
Sherlock laughed around John's cock and was amused at how John reacted to the vibrations. He started bobbing his head up and down john’s considerable length. “Sir, I want you fuck my throat till I pass out.” He grabbed John’s hands and placed them on his head.
"Crap, really? I mean I though she was dead after the fire. I rather liked her. I mean I'll give it a test run, but if I can't establish boundaries with her I may have to say no, but I really want to give it an effort because I rarely ever liked people at that age. And in terms of people, she was one of my favorites when I was a kid. That liking people shit was hard as a kid. Dad was always trying to convince her parents to organize some play dates when we were kids, I really thought we could've been friends, but her parents would always dodge the question. My dad was convinced that she died in the fire, and after a while I believed him too.”
“See I told you, just make sure your brother keeps up on his half of the rent,” Said Uncle Rudy, there is a slightly chaotic back ground sounds.
“Hello Jeanine,” greeted Irene who was in a short black leather skirt with neon fishnet stockings and a crop top, she also had a large neon rainbow cluster fuck faux fur coat, her whole outfit caught the light in the most amusing way. She had dreamy smile on her face. “And hello Sherlock darling, you are looking rather well, was your trip to the countryside worthwhile.”
“Okay but where does the bodily harm and arson kick in?” Asked Athina.
Sherlock nodded enthusiastically, he delivered a light kiss to John’s cheek, which left John smiling.
Kayla laughed again, "maybe you can show us the apartment at least to put Toby's stuff away, and then we can hit up the shops so that I can see how you navigate public spaces with her. Hey Sherlock can you bring out your clicker, that way you can practice marking out where she is and isn't allowed to be in the apartment. Also since you are the second floor, Do you want the first floor to be an acceptable place for her to be?"
Kayla nodded, "okay that's great. Shall we start tomorrow? Do you want the morning or afternoon?
Mycroft and Ella took their stances.
Sherlock picked up the lead again.
“Did I leak any private info? Was I judgey in front of the client? No not at all, I think we are fine,” said Mike with a shrug of his shoulders.
John nodded, "that's fine, and thank you for pushing your comfort zone a little bit tonight. It was an enjoyable experience, I hope you enjoyed it too."
“NO YOU ARE NOT CAPABLE OF TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF! WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN,” roared Mycroft.
“Pretty Boy, I’m a bartender and it is practically unspoken but one has to be prepared to be an impromptu therapist because drunk people need to process emotions... so many, many emotions,” Said Jeanine. “Like look at that Butch at the end of the bar intensely staring down her whiskey, she’s an alcoholic, and has been one of my regulars for a couple of years now. She tends to have a self sabotage problem because she is always bemoaning to me about how lonely she feels but quickly attacks anyone who is concerned about her. So much interpersonal drama there, like I think she is on the edge of some sort of discovery, I hope it is a good one though. Her parents rejected her when she came out and they love to say she’ll never be as good as her brother, apparently he is a doctor. She finally finished emotionally vomiting all over me and the others and now she
All of them made their way to the chip card machines, Sherlock emptied out the content of the cart to the machine and started to try running it, it was almost going well, when suddenly.
Willow was telling anyone who would listen that she got on blockers, and as Papa accompanied William and some of the other kids on the under ground, he listened intently to all Willow had to say. Sherlock raised an eyebrow when he heard Willow asking William, why he asked her for her legal name and birthdate? He smiled when William quietly explained to Willow why he asked, and Willow pulled him in for a giant hug. She promised William that she wouldn’t tell a soul, but asked if she could give the names for some of the other girls in the group who needed the same help. While Sherlock was pleased to see that his son having an altruistic turn for his crimes, he knew he had a lot to teach William on the skills needed to break the law. Sherlock was very much up for the challenge, but now he was wondering if they made nitrile gloves for someone as small as William, he couldn’t have William getting caught over something as silly as fingerprints.
Mycroft stared intently at Ella, "who is andrea? Also what does this wager entail?"
Sherlock and Toby made their way to the dairy case, grabbed a milk and a cream and placed it in the cart.
Kudos and comments light up my soul.
Andrea raised her hand, both Mycroft and Ella stopped talking. Andrea threw down her hand "Allez!"
“He was proven wrong, Mrs Hudson,” replied John, he was holding back a laugh. Mainly because this was a rare occurrence, and he didn’t want to kick Sherlock while he was already down.
Sherlock nodded.
John squinted to look at who was yelling at them, he recognized him, Sebastian the man who hired them for the bank case a few years back. "Can you not?"
"Ella is someone I wouldn't want ruined," said Anthea glaring at Mycroft's house.
John and Kayla sighed. John remembered that selective memory is indeed a symptom of C-PTSD but sometimes he really wish he knew what caused him to delete stuff because sure he says it frees up space in his mind, but sometimes John wondered if there was more to the stuff that went into what he forgot. Like after the whole Eurus thing, it made sense that Sherlock forgot about how airplanes work. "Okay let's just get a box of tea, some milk, a cake, maybe some sandwiches, ginger nuts, and definitely some sugar because you burnt it all when you wanted to show Rosie ash snakes and she couldn't get enough of them."
Sherlock nodded and started walking with Toby down the aisle. He found the tea with relative little problem and placed it in the cart. "Okay what's next?"
John smirked, “well this is going to be really, really good.” He slapped Sherlock’s ass. “A posh boy like you even has the good stuff, we’re not going to be having a nasty headache with this one are we?”
William and Sherlock make some preparations for Valentine’s Day.
“You would be surprised, the right leather can be quite soft,” Said Sherlock still struggling to free John from his skin tight trousers, and dropped to his knees for a better look, and with that he finally sprung John free from his trousers and John’s rather impressive boner straining against his underwear. Sherlock wasn’t sure why but he just felt the need to press his face right against John’s junk.
“Yeah... part of me thinks the older man is giving Sherlock some sort of reward for eating and I am pretty sure it involves the fact that the older man’s hand is currently on Sherlock’s lap… excuse me but I think I am going to have to remind someone that they are in public,” replied Molly, she never liked telling couples to stop because they always got so defensive at this hour. Yet she was not in the mood to be cleaning up cum from play she had nothing to do with. It really isn’t one of those things you can ignore and leave for the next staff member, there was the concern for basic decency and sanitation. No one needs to see that while eating. She sighed and approached Sherlock and John’s table and saw that John was only holding on to Sherlock’s thigh, so not as bad as it could be. “Is everything all right here? interrupted Molly, she could hear John whispering a number into Sherlock’s ear with every bite he took.
“Well Aithne can I just join you on your trip to U.K., I mean I don’t want to to accompany you to secret psychiatric hospital and I know I won’t be allowed to see the lab, but I am sure I can find something to do,” asked Blaze.
John shook his head, "no I trust Sherlock to make terms that can benefit Rosie and me, I don't want to make it unbalanced."
"I'd ask how you are doing but you obviously look like you are working through something," said Paul. "Do you want to talk about it? I mean, mind you, I am here working through my own shit. So really I am being selfish in this offer because I want to talk to someone, and my therapist visit isn't for another 2 days." Paul shrugged his shoulders and smiled at John. "You want to go first or can i?"
Billy glared at Mycroft, “You know Mikey, you can just stop and ask me without all of this. I think it would make your car so much cleaner.”
Hiram took a breath of relief, he didn't want to be the person to ask.
Sherlock smiled, "okay what do we do in the store?"
"So are you going to give him the info?" Asked the driver with a smirk.
Sherlock nodded in acknowledgment.
“So back to Eurus?” Said Athina, “I mean so you are just going to visit her and see if you can bring her to Maureen Russo? Like don’t you have to have approval from the other staff members?”
John's hands drifted, one of them resting on Sherlock’s throat and the other caressed Sherlock's cheek, wiping away a tear. He smiled at Sherlock who still stared at him in awe, he could get used to this. And he decided to push Sherlock to the very edge, he tightened his grip around Sherlock’s throat and the hand that was caressing Sherlock’s cheek drifted over his nose and John pinched his nose shut. Effectively making it so that Sherlock had no way of breathing, he enjoyed the sensation that was of Sherlock’s body fighting to function, he finished cumming with a bit of a shout that made him dart his head around to make sure he didn't attract anyone with his shout. He kept note of the fact that Sherlock still had his hands up, he was impressed with Sherlock's ability to push himself, he thought that if he was in a more private spot and with more time just how much he can break Sherlock, because he was sure that he would be beautiful to rebuild. He softened his grip on Sherlock, his fingers ghosted over Sherlock’s neck and gently wiped away a few stray tears. “Stand up Private, you know I may work you hard, but I believe in rewarding hard work,” said John with a bit of an edge.
“The man has body glitter, this is obviously craft glitter, and judging by his hands and the way he is holding his pen, I think he would rather shoot himself than use craft glitter as body glitter, and the color blocking on his face,” said Sherlock. “He is obviously a make up artist, probably trained in MAC, but that glitter is probably Kyrolan.”
"Maybe you shouldn't sit in such a precarious spot," snapped back Mycroft. "Also nice words back there, they sounded exactly like one would say after finishing a program and now uses the program as a script when trying to construct acceptable answers for awkward situations in life. I don't know if you are being sincere with those words or are just parroting stuff so as to cover up what you have done to my brother, but know this. If you hurt my brother ever again, I will make you disappear so thoroughly that no one will ever find you. But don't worry Rosie will be fine, I'll stonewall whoever other than Sherlock tries for custody so hard they would need to have an entire team of lawyers on retainer every hour of every day to even dream of getting Rosie before she becomes of age, because while I am sure Sherlock can eventually learn live without you, I think loosing Rosie would kill him. But don't worry, I'll steer him in the right way to ensure she gets the best of care, you already know what our parents offered, so it isn't an empty promise, it's a guarantee. Rosie will want for nothing and have the best provided for her.”
Mycroft scoffed at Toby, "it was necessary, we all didn't need Mummy and Father, spreading any doubt of the red for therapy, which makes no sense because Father is friends with a bunch of psychiatric researchers and they both want me to put the other one in a program to get her out of jail."
Yeah I know the American Healthcare system is fucked up, but like a good chunk of time spent with my pen pals when they visited the US was taking them to Costco so that their parents could get them fitted for smaller profile hearing aids. I figure because there was a time in history when NHS was giving kids outdated medical equipment because it was what they had in stock. And like I’ve helped enough trans folks from the UK to know that trans health in the UK can be a bit fucked up in terms of waitlist and meeting the requirements for surgery. So those who have the money sometimes choose to come and get surgery here in the US. Many of whom are doing it while studying abroad. Yes, there are indeed methods starting recently that would allow trans kids, even those on blockers, to save options for reproduction in the future. I figure in 12 years time it will get more accessible.  Fucking hell though the last medical conference I was at, this doctor approached me and asked if I could convince her kid to undergo the treatment despite it being experimental. The kid was only 13, and very firmly against having kids; so I loudly exclaimed “you would force a 13 year old to have a child!” And I bounced because I saw a bunch of people who I knew were pediatric psychiatrists and one of the doctors who invented the methods used for preserving fertility approach her and it definitely looked like an argument broke out the next time I passed by them.
“Of course, you would say that you dirty, slutty boy, you’d do anything to get your hungry hole filled,” teased John as he only inserted a single finger to the first knuckle stroking Sherlock’s entrance before pulling out. He slapped Sherlock’s ass “you know what? I think you have been awfully spoiled today and should take a break; that way you can appreciate everything I give you.”
“Hopefully nothing happened to Rosie,” he said with a bounce out of bed, he looked around the floor and found John’s phone and throwing it to John, while he scrambled to then hallway and found his own phone.
The third teen, “Come on Doc, Andrea, just finish it, the software don’t lie and that man just looks sad, and when you fight a sad guy no one wins. So take Mr. Sadsacks off the roof and him process his shit and you use some kind of motivational interviewing to get his ass to realize whatever it is you need Mr. Sadsacks to realize.”
“Personally I don’t like the idea, but Mummy and Da wants me to at least give it a try,” said Mycroft, “have a decent day.” With that Mycroft turned around and promptly exited Eurus’ cell.
He strolled up to the front door, and made quick work of the door, he didn't hear or see any alarms, which he thought was a bit suspicious for someone who was so secretive in her billing to NHS. He shrugged his shoulders and followed the map to the safe according to Anthea's plan. He found the safe built into the side table next to a desk in what one would consider the office.
John pulled Sherlock to the bed and pushed him down, he stood over Sherlock and paused for a moment really looking at Sherlock, he found his eyes to be incredibly interesting, and he looked awfully young, but given what he knew so far, he couldn’t possibly be too young. He grabbed Sherlock’s ankle and rotated him until Sherlock’s head was hanging off the edge of the bed. He was amused at when Sherlock just let his mouth fall open, he could see that Sherlock was reaching for the condom keeper on his belt. But John wasn’t hard enough yet. He dropped his trousers and started rubbing his underwear covered cock against Sherlock’s face, and he moaned as Sherlock started sucking at his balls the fabric. He could feel the blood rushing to his cock, and he was rapidly hardening and when he was ready for the condom. He opened the condom and held it over the tip of his cock as he slowly thrusted into Sherlock’s waiting mouth.
“Well aren’t you pleasant, you and my brother will make each other soooo happy,” Said Mycroft, walking out of the door. “But really you break his heart, and I am going to end you.”
John and Sherlock burst into laughter and started holding hands.
Solomon smiled, "well I can assure you that you are going to be helping a lot of folks with this donation."
John and Sherlock spent their afternoon in the garden.
John nodded, "yeah I probably should head back too. Also Paul, don't be afraid to call me, I mean we all got each other's numbers."
“Not a problem, John, you know I love you,” said Sherlock, he looked at John and smiled. He kissed John on the top of his head.
Sherlock blushed and curled in on himself, still holding on to John's hand.
Sherlock continued, "I mean at first made it easier to lash out at folks that I just couldn't reach, but it also made it easier to get out the other thoughts I thought I couldn't say out loud because I feared that it would ruin what john and I have. Ultimately I kept all the positive letters and burned all the angry ones."
John smiled at his pet who was being such a good Pup. He fed it a shortbread biscuit after it finished its meal. He attached a leash and guide his Pup to his room and motioned for the Pup to get on the foot of the bed. “Okay Pup, you did well, so rest up, we have a full day tomorrow. If you need to piddle, the puppy pad is on the floor. And one more thing.” He stepped up to the trunk with all the toys and pulled out a sheath. He lubed the inside of it before guiding his Pup’s cock into it. He figured if he was going to be sharing the bed with a mutt, the mutt should have a knot. He smiled before petting his pup on the head and kissing it on the snoot. “Sweet dreams pup.”
"Okay so, I am giving the five minute call now, after that you take the small slips of paper write your top 3 on them and I will just put them all on the board and chuck the scraps into the fire that way the terms are randomized and no one can outright ban one a rule because they are annoyed with a person," declared John.
Sherlock’s attention suddenly peaked, he looked up and turned immediately John, “okay you have my attention but do sips count?”
John nodded, and traded leashes with Sherlock, "let's try Bopper."
John pointed to the side of Sherlock’s thigh.
Violet smiled, "see you later dear."
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can stop it if you want,” said John, slightly embarrassed, he felt a slight, blush, which just added to the embarrassment. What grown ass man blushed? He thought to himself.
Kayla smiled, and continued writing in her note book. “Hey Sherlock mind if I come up, so that we can go over the notes. I mean, you did really well today, you and Toby are a great team, she is pretty intuitive for what you need so far from what we have witnessed, but I am definitely going to have to work with you and Toby to see how she can best help you when you are facing issues in particular the suspected seizures, but we can’t know our plan of action until you know your plan of action for the seizures. Otherwise, lets try seeing if we can do a training at a place where you actually have to interact with people because that bit there with the kiosk was ridiculous. So was there anything you felt the need to improve on and do you think Toby has helped you do somethings to day that you otherwise would’ve struggled with tot the point that you would consider not going through with the task.”
“Oh come on Sherlock, I wasn’t the only one,” said John as he bent down to give Sherlock a kiss. While most Tops wouldn’t do something like that without waiting for their partner to rinse out their mouth; John was someone who wouldn’t subject their partner to anything they wouldn’t try. He looked around and realized he had no way of cleaning Sherlock off.
Sherlock looked at John with a pout, “why would you even bother with politeness? People rarely return equally.
John laughed because while the tub was free of any color, the multiple rinsing of Rosie's hair only proved that the color was going to be there for quite some time. “I think you already have a set of skills that kids will think is cool, I don’t think you have to build a whole set of new ones. Yet I have to admit I like the hair color."
Sherlock twitched, he didn’t seem to get why everyone insisted on calling him by his first name he didn’t like the name William it made him feel off like it put forward an air of normality he just wasn’t capable of sustaining henceforth the move to using his middle name. He felt it was just more fitting for him. He waved back at the scrawny man, he certainly looked a lot more healthier since he last saw him, “hello Wiggins, I’m surprised my brother didn’t scare you off.”
Also I know some people may question the safety of some of the acts performed but the precautions were there. Also I think my definition of safe is "is it consensual? Is the person aware of all the risks? Is there minimal risk of transfer of STI/STDs?" Also I think I spend so much time in sex clubs that something's don't phase me any more.

“You always say that but we know you can’t really change,” said Mycroft.
"Well as long as she doesn't lick it, i won't complain," replied Sherlock.

“Damn,” said Sherlock as he tore his gloves off and flopped dramatically into bed.
Sherlock knelt before John, willing to take whatever John was willing to give him, he never found himself so open to anyone before in his life and they had only known each other a few hours. He felt that keeping John in his life was going to be a step in the right direction. He found John so exciting, so interesting that he felt that the urge to use was just completely dampened. The gnawing boredom that usually plagued him every moment of his life was gone. He knew it stupid to say a person was the catalyst for his change this big, because he couldn’t possibly control how John would react ever, but he just knew John was going to be important to him. So he knelt on the ground absolutely adoring John. He knelt naked in the alley, in a proper kneel with his
Sherlock nodded, "yeah you can do that."
“Believe me when I say it wouldn't have worked with any one else, you’re his best shot at a successful flat mate, but don’t worry it will be fun,” said Mike, “it will give you all the adventure you need.”
He got a nice striped pattern with the tape and the rubber band was securely in place. William placed the play dough, slime, and custom spinner into a red paper bag, and tied some ribbon around it.
“No, so Afghanistan or Iraq?” Asked Sherlock, as he caught his breath from the whole altercation. The Twink was making all kinds of flirty looks at Sherlock, but Sherlock was now completely focused on John, and being on the receiving end of such singular attention was absolutely breath taking for John.
“But he had good intentions and no one innocent got hurt,” Said Kate with a slight shrug.
"Wait if you didn't need to charge us rent? What where you doing with the money?" Asked John. Almost afraid to hear the answer.
"You know I don't need this," snapped Mycroft, he really hated loosing control. He stood up and started going towards the door, "also just so you know I did call Dr. Hunter, she'll be available to come in for a consultation but she won't guarantee that Eurus will be entered into the program. And I checked the programs closer to here, but none of them seem to be prepared for a case such as Eurus, I doubt Dr. Hunter is prepared either, but given the history they share and the unique history and tactics of her staff, I think I am reluctantly willing to give the doctor a chance but that is if and only if she is able to prove that Eurus is a candidate for the program. But I emphasize that one of the three of you must be willing to take her in after her stint in the program, but if you cannot she goes back to Sherringford because I don't know anywhere else to place her."
Sherlock relaxes slightly, "yes John I know you are sorry and that you are working on it. I forgive you because what you went through to hit those moments that is my fault I deserved it."
“Why what?” asked John.
One of the teens yelled, “It’s midnight, we got church in the morning and mum and da won’t let us back in until we are sure you are all off the roof, because mum says that the homeowners insurance probably won’t cover any injuries involving the roof.”
Sherlock huffed, "they are crowded, the machines never work, and people are stupid."
“It definitely was, and... wait why am I telling you this?” Exclaimed Sherlock, a slight blush developed on his ridiculous cheekbones.
Violet laughed, "I'd  love for Eurus to come out sometimes too, but I swear to g-d if you listen to Philip you better be willing to listen to Christina, because she seems to be his better voice of reason, you know she stopped him from making that experiment from going out of hand that one time. I mean Paul could be helpful in getting a better read on her. Sherlock probably used his work, do you ever see him practice faces until he gets the right one for what he is about to do, I bet you he got it from his work. But Marsha, I like Marsha, I think she would be the most practical out of them all. But I mean Mycroft did really cock it up by isolating her this whole time. I don't know what kind of recovery there is for such an experience. Especially given how she was before this whole ordeal." Violet frowned staring into the fire.
“The rings are perfect, I am sure dad will love them,” replies William once again throwing his arms around his father. “Ooh and also some chocolate.”
John returned the smile to the best of his abilities despite being rather annoyed at being left in this situation.
Mycroft sighed, "okay I'll look more into Dr. Hunter and I'll give you call. Also i'll talk with Sherlock, otherwise, I don't know if you want to do this experiment so badly why not have him try to go take a vacation in some country where I cannot access their security." Mycroft laughed, "good luck finding a country that does that as well."
Sherlock was riding on that edge of pain and pleasure and when John bit him it just got better. He could feel John stay still letting his cock soften inside him. Sherlock felt really close to cumming, so he started to rut against the mattress despite it being a rather coarse bedding and not in any way near comfortable to get off on but he didn’t care. Sherlock eventually came all over the blanket and himself. He whined a little bit when John pulled out of him, which smeared lube all over him.
Sherlock nodded and leaned forward and started to working his way down John’s cock. As he
John smiled, “maybe we should get you out of that leather while we are at it.”
"Oh I thought his name was Dandy? And he is personally on my payroll, I'll adjust his rates immediately," said Mycroft now seriously wondering if he is underpaying all his support staff, and how should he go about correcting it. Wait was he misnamming all of them?  "That doesn't need to be part of the wager."
Okay again I don't know about NHS too well, but here in the US, unfortunately your medical record will always exists, so I am just working off that knowledge.
“I just remembered something Ro did that should’ve tipped us off on the whole trans thing, you know I hate repeating myself,” replied Sherlock as he looked at John.
John smiled and pulled out a packet of lube, from his holster pocket. He let out a small laugh at the look Sherlock gave him. “Private I said i’d help, I just didn't say how,” said John with a wink. “Also if you get the count wrong I am immediately stopping.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock kissed John back, and smiled at John, “well you are stuck with me too. And let’s say it was today, because I rather enjoyed my summer at CalTech back when I was at Cambridge, that school’s lab was a little too permissive in my experiments and I’m sure Lestrade’s daughter would enjoy herself... what is she studying because until this moment I was unaware of this daughter. And not only that we get to upset those idiots while we are at it.
Sherlock sighed and went over to the play yard to pick up Rosie, she was due for a diaper change any ways. “Don’t worry my love there isn’t much to worry about, it’s just my parents at the door.”
John rolled in a big closer to Sherlock because he knew that was usually Sherlock’s signal for cuddle me. He settled in as Sherlock wrapped his arms around John. “What does that have to do with anything?”
John turned to Sherlock "so how much money did you give?"
“Well I’ll be back with the check,” said Molly suppressing a giggle as she walked away.
"Say that now but you watch we're going to get a phone call someday saying she is violating school dress code and we are going to be stuck with an emergency color removal just to keep her on track for school. Of course kids think what I do is cool, they are kids, and as far as it goes I think most adults think I am just being annoying.” replied Sherlock, he said with a slight smile.
Irene let out a laugh, “looks like I know who you are going to be sharing that popper with.” She touched his shoulder as she walked away, “I am going to miss you, but do visit me in San Francisco.”
Sherlock nodded his head rather vigorously, “Yes, Captain I understand.” He hissed as the first slap made contact, “one, thank you Captain.” He tried to not wiggle in John’s lap, he really did but all he found himself doing was lightly thrusting against john’s leg smearing Pre cum all over John’s thigh. He only got more desperate for friction as his punishment went on.
Sherlock continued laughing, “it’s okay the mums at the playground are already judging us, apparently I am too much and too little at the exact same time, they never specify what thought. But just wait and see once little Watson goes to school, I'll have a whole set of skills that will make all the chatty mums' kids jealous of little Watson." Sherlock smiled and tossed some rubber toys into the tub, and showed Rosie how to fill the toys with water so as to spray away the bathtub paint, which came off the wall with no trouble.
Did you see another roofie being dropped? Is it one of the douchebags with frosted tips? Also my name is Jeanine!” Called out Jeanine as Sherlock started running after John. She strained to see who Sherlock was chasing and was amused to see it was the person who just got the drink to the face. “Oh g-d everything is a fucking emergency to that boy when he is giving a shit.”
“Sorry, I forgot about the uh...” Mike gestured to his own shoulder, “But nice touch with the camo pants, really drives the left hanky home, also it leaves nothing to the imagination. Some lucky boy or girl or lucky person who exists outside of the gender binary, will want to take you home tonight.”
"I had years of practicing reasoning with toddlers with your partner over there," quipped Mycroft.
John nodded in acknowledgement of Sherlock’s words, his throat suddenly getting dry, “I don’t need to do that, I don’t want anyone else, I want to help you get to whatever you want out of this, and I wasn’t lying earlier. I’d rather go there rest of my life with out sex, if it means I get to spend the rest of my life with you.”
"I mean if it makes you feel better it is in a gun safe when not in use and totally out of reach from Rosie," said John trying his best to sound responsible to Ella.
John replied, "not a problem at all, we should be back home by 3:30, but that's around Rosie's nap time, so if you want to be around while Rosie is awake and playful, I'd suggest swinging by  around 5."
"Yes Sherlock, I am doing perfectly fine, the walk helped calm me down and talking with Paul also helped. How about you, are you really doing fine? replied John, he raised a hand which ghosted over Sherlock's shoulder.
“He did commit a few crimes...” Said Irene.
Sherlock waved his hand, "no need to apologize, both of you were for the most alright, but some things are out of your control. If only some people would learn how to handle that." The doorbell rings, Sherlock hands Rosie over to John and looks at the video feed and sees Mycroft at the door, "and speak of the devil, and the devil shall appear." Sherlock turned on the intercom, "hello brother my, how are you doing?"
Jeanine, Kate. And Irene all waited outside of 221 b Baker St, they would say it was out of concern, but ultimately they wanted to see who managed to handle the sloppy twink ass that was Sherlock Holmes. When Irene got a page from Molly, that one waitress who was studying forensics, saying that she saw Sherlock in her diner actually eating food, and the only reason why he was eating was because the older man was feeding him by hand.
