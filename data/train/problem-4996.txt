Dean shakes his head, “Benny was stupid to say these were celebratory drinks. I’m not editor yet.” He can feel the blush creep up his neck.
He rolls his eyes and grips the phone tighter in his hand.
He’d give anything to go back to that night at his parents house. Falling asleep with Cas in his arms. But it seemed like that was just a bitter memory now.
“Could you whisper?” Sam begs, and lays his head on the table.
“Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, thank you so much for coming. I’ve been looking forward to our dinner all day.”
Cas huffs out a quiet snort next to him and Dean can sense the full body eyeroll without looking over. He couldn’t have been that mad if he laughed at Dean’s dumb jokes, right? What the hell was that about anyway? Replaying the last few minutes in his head, he can't begin to think what made Castiel so upset. Maybe he hadn't been as okay with Dean keeping that information from him. After all, Dean had been stressing for days that they were best friends, and best friends told each other everything. If he had been upset that Dean kept that kind of information from him, they’d just have to talk about it later.
Ellen walks over and hugs him, “You spoil us, you know?”
“I did ask you on a date, didn’t I?” Castiel smiles and pulls Dean tighter in his arms.
Was this really happening? Was Cas’s seduction technique to just lead him into a place where you have sex and hope for the best? No, that couldn’t be right, could it? He lingers in the doorway, unsure if he’s supposed to keep following Cas.
Castiel smiles as the man struggles against a lifetime of breeding and military training. He’s never been able to see Castiel as more than a superior even though they’d known each other for years and were roughly the same age.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean thinks this might be all and he’ll have to take matters back into his own hands but then Cas pushes up to his knees and reaches down behind his legs with the other hand. The one he lubed up.
“Dean,” he tries again, “you knew this was coming.”
“Not in the time I’ve known you; your um... your brother found you on Facebook a couple years ago. But that was only to tell you...” he trails off. This wasn’t fair, Cas had put all this shit behind him a long time ago and now Dean was dragging all back in his face.
Dean complies, alone in the center of the bed his other heightened senses search out for any evidence of what his Dom might be doing. He hears the quiet rustle of cloth, possibly smells the faint whiff of Castiel’s aftershave.
Benny hums thoughtfully in the phone, as Dean’s sponsor and sometimes friend, he had learned over the years to read Dean’s nonverbal cues. There were surprisingly several.
They both laugh at Castiel’s comment till they’re breathless. Eyes shining and chests heaving in tandem, knees bumping on the bench outside the comic shop. Dean couldn’t recall the last time he enjoyed someone’s company this much. Despite their shaky meeting he felt that this might be the start of something. And he wasn’t going to waste any more time being mad about something so silly.
Victor takes a breath, calmer now, “A witness who’s currently unconscious in the hospital. And we don’t know the extent of his involvement with Whickham.”
He tries his best to explode her head like Professor X with his telekinesis, but it must be on the fritz today. He inhales deeply and stands up a little straighter in the face of public humiliation.
He's just getting himself comfortable when his keen ears pick up the squeak of footsteps on the floorboards in the hall. Making one last adjustment to his posture, Dean grips his hands behind his back, takes a deep breath and lowers his eyes to the floor. At the faint inhale of breath, he knows his Dom is standing in the doorway; taking in his freckled shoulders, narrow hips, and (if his past lovers had spoken the truth) his perfectly formed ass. Pride swells through him at the thought of Castiel’s eyes raking over the hard plains and soft lines of his body. He wasn’t a vain person by any means, but Dean knew what he looked like. And it pleased him to know despite their current roles he might hold a little bit of power over his Dom in that moment.
Dean trembles under the weight of those words. Could this really be happening? Even after every awful thing Dean has done or said to Castiel, could it be he loved him? How could he let this remarkable man doubt for a second what had been in his heart all along?
They had agreed earlier in their conversation, around the time Castiel got to the section on bondage and Dean started melting into his chair, that they were going to wait till both their test results came back before engaging in a scene. Coincidentally neither of them had up to date papers and both felt more comfortable heading into a new relationship with everything squared away. Dean was beginning to regret that decision, as he was already suppressing the urge to drop under the table and suck Cas off while he finished going through the list.
Sam laughs, “We can go wherever you two want. I just need to make a couple calls first.”
He cant finish, Cas’s thrusts steal the words from his lips, turning them into another moan at the last moment. His orgasm building faster, and faster. Castiel bucks into him harder. Crying out with every thrust.
Looking up at the old subway clock above the bar he blinks in surprise to see how late in the day it was. Kevin would be here in about ten minutes for his shift, and they’d have a delivery coming in any time now. He was a few more hours away from getting to see Cas again.
Cas heads over to the door, opening it silently he turns back to Dean a final time.
“And his moving in with Vanessa?”
Those three traitorous text bubbles bounce along the screen as Dean types and then vanish. This is why Castiel hated texting. It was so much easier to get your point across while in person or on the phone. Short of hanging up on him, Dean would have to answer his questions and he wouldn’t be left wondering if the other man slammed his phone down and walked away from their conversation.
The little boy shakes his head, he pulls his knees up to his chin and hides his face in them.
With no more to say on the subject, he gets up, leaves the room, and heads back the way he came. Thinking he remembered signs for a cafeteria on the way in. Another floor down, he finds it without trouble, but he waits in line for coffee, two plain bagels, and a banana. Then there’s a line to pay and by the time he’s through with that Dean’s so frustrated he’s grateful his hands are full. He’s this close to tearing his hair out.
“Parmesan and rosemary potato cracklins, cheddar cheese, bacon crumbles, roasted red pepper sauce, served over heirloom grits with goat cheese.” he says like it's as easy as a bowl of Cookie Crunch.
“Yay!” he cheers and, thankfully, picks up the rest without complaint.
“Oh... and this is Crowley...” he trails off in confusion but the odd little man smiles with pride.
The muscles of his lower back and lats received the same treatment as his shoulders; the oil smells like vanilla and chamomile, the warmth from Castiel’s expert hands drawing more of the scent over his body. Fingertips brush the waistband of his underwear and despite being stupid relaxed, Dean’s dick twitches against the sheets he’s pressed into. But the hands quickly recede and land on his calves, a whine catches in the back of his throat.
“You’re not injured. I needed to hold you tightly to make it so far, so quickly. But we weren’t able to heal it fully, hence the scar.”
Sam blushes a little, “It's a good team. They just needed someone to take point on a bunch of stuff. They kept waiting for one of them to lead, but no one really wanted to.
“Eileen Leahy.” Dean blurts out, and Castiel snaps around.
Eileen bristles at the question, “I know him plenty. We’ve worked together for over two years.”
“Mr. Bennet you can be escorted out or leave on your own two feet.” The guard sounds like he’s right behind Dean now.
He pulls a pair of dark jeans out of the drawer and pulls them on. A little tighter than he remembers, but he only has to wiggle a little to adjust himself comfortably. He glares again at the pile and out of spite selects a black v-neck tee shirt from another drawer. He’s not going there to impress anyone. No reason to get that fancy.
“Hey! I thought the only yelling allowed on game night was if someone cheats at Trivial Pursuit. What’s going on you two?”
“Yup it is.” Dean hasn’t let go of his other hand yet. Almost like he didn’t want him to leave.
Wait he’s leaving already? Dean didn’t even get the chance to talk to him.
Smiling wickedly Castiel props up on an elbow, he doesn’t remove the finger but holds off on adding a second like he had been about to. Dean wasn’t calling for his safe word, but he was trembling with aftershocks, “I seem to remember telling you our night wasn’t finished just because you were.”
*Waves Aggressively* Hi Everybody!!
“Yup sorry right here.” Dean pulls the badge out of his shirt.
“And you need to tell him what his mother said to you. Whatever it was, you should trust your instincts that its the right thing to do. That’s our time for today, Happy New Year Castiel.”
Dean embraces him back and slots his chin into Cas’s shoulder. Hot tears soak the fabric. And he lets out a shuddering sigh.
A year? A whole year to break even. It could work, he’s been making double payments when he could. And now with Sam’s promotion he could for sure do that every month. They could get back out from under that crushing pile of interest.
“You're welcome,” Cas smiles, “now come here.”
Would they sit side by side on the couch, thighs so close to touching? Their hands brushing over the last breadstick; a shared smile, an awkward laugh. Dean hadn't known till that moment he wanted any of that. But now that the idea was planted, it would be difficult to uproot.
“Dean, you don’t have to watch everything you say. I’m a perfectly functional adult. And I should know, I’m a psychology major remember?” Cas smiles.
He waggles his brows suggestively and takes an obnoxiously large bite of pizza. Not yet wanting to tell Sam the real reason he stayed late. If Adam knew he broke his promise about the money he’d never hear the end of it. Plus, Sam was also still a little ticked off about Castiel and the surveillance. Dean needed to talk to Bobby get to the bottom of what really happened. If Adam got the whole witness for the prosecution thing wrong, maybe he got this wrong too.
The sounds of rustling papers comes through the phone, “There’s a meeting at St. Vincent’s over on Madison in 30 minutes.”
He feels a presence to his left, taking a deep breath he opens his eyes and there he is. Castiel stands still as a statue, a smile threatens to pull at his lips, the other man looks terrified.
Sam’s puppy dog eyes try their hardest to cut into Dean’s resolve, but he doubles down, clasping a hand on his arm.
Thank you so much for coming on this odd little trip with me. What started out as free verse poetry in my head took on a life of its own and became this story.
Castiel knew his status afforded him access to thing a regular person wouldn’t have. He shouldn’t have been able to get updates on Adam’s condition, but he still spoke with the head of the ICU anytime there was a change.
“I’m sorry boys, I don’t think I’m going to be good company tonight. I think it may be time to head home.” Alastair signals for the check and silently pays out their tab.
He gasps and pulls back his hand, “What the hell is that?”
He smirks, picturing his oldest friend demanding snacks at all hours of the night. Sam may very well be the patron saint of patience; he knew Eileen could be demanding even when she wasn’t expecting.
“Right, so do you need us to contact a doctor for the test or will you be handling that on your own?” Mick asks, raising his cup to his lips.
“Breathlessly.” Castiel smirks.
“Car sounds like its running better.” Which in Bobby’s language was as good a compliment as any.
Dean perks up at this, it’s been a long time since he verbally sparred with Cas and enjoyed it, “Only half a dozen? I’ll have to make up for that tonight.”
And with that one sentence, all thoughts of friendship, keeping things simple like they had always been, go floating out of Dean’s head. He'd never be able to hold back the feelings he had if Cas kept looking at him that way. But in this moment, he didn’t really care. They were going home, together.
“The Dad estimates about an hour.”
They spent the rest of the drive with the windows down, freezing their asses off. But it was better than dealing with the smell. Then they had to help clean up the car, before the driver would leave. All the while Adam was sleeping on the wet grass in front of the house. They dragged him into the house and threw him fully clothed in the shower.
“I’m fine.”
It wasn’t Cas, it had to be all Eileen
“Cas... I need...” He keens.
“Take your time.” That smug tone is back again.
Her voice no longer shrill, it’s flat and cold. “I’m here to inform you that the company The De Bourg firm represents has started negotiations with your bank. If all goes according to plan, they will be buying out your mortgage by the end of next year.”
“Cas -” Dean starts but Castiel puts a hard hand on his shoulder, and it shuts him up in a hurry. With the pressure of his fingers sinking into the meat of his bicep. Dean forgets he’s supposed to be pissed right now.
He points over the road past Dean’s shoulder and sitting right between a stationary store and a massage therapist is Blessed Tea, the shop he and Pamela told the group they owned. He’s been less than a hundred yards away from Castiel the whole time. What were the odds?
Dean’s eyes widen at the realization; did Cas really mean that? Something in his soars at the possibility, maybe he’d been wrong the whole time. Maybe he wasn’t too late.
What a great game today folks! Our MudDevil's pulled off another win despite those crummy angel's best efforts to take it from us. Tomorrow looks to be a beautiful day for baseball so we'll see you here at 4:00 for all the coverage. Get some sleep sports fans and tune in to me on WJ2M radio, Gabe Novak signing off!
Something burns and pulls under his skin – There’s an IV sticking out of his neck. The needle slides out with a quick tug.
“They tried to force you into conversion therapy. After you came out, they were going to send you to one of those... camps. That was when you ran.” He replies flatly. Tamping down on the emotions he feels bubbling up.
“I know, I know.” He sits up and rubs a hand over his face. Thankfully, it comes away dry.
Cas chuckles at that, “Intracranial hematoma aside, I also wanted some time for things to get back to normal for you. It can't be easy to have a stranger invading your personal space.”
“Dean?” he calls softly.
“I slammed my papers down, and in front of the whole class I-”, she shudders, “Dad I asked her how she was even going give a presentation with a father who abandoned her and a d-dead mom?”
“Why are you mad at me? I’m not the one who puked in the Uber.”
Benny’s business partner was more about the numbers and less about the kitchen, which suited Benny right down to the ground. The only snag was that it was sometimes hard for him to see past facts and figures.
“I’m not lonely.”
Resting his elbows on the table he covers his face with his hands under the ruse of wiping the sleep from his eyes. Fiercely ignoring the prickle of tears that he feels behind them. He breathes through the pain; the memories would fade in time. He was simply feeling the effects of a very powerful spell, nothing more.
Pushing thoughts of his past out of his mind, he fingers the edge of Castiel’s business card in his front pocket. The sharp crease of heavy paper digging into the pad of his thumb. Not enough to hurt him, just something to ground him, remind him that the gorgeous Dom would be back in a few hours, and they could start talking about what they both might be interested in. Dean feels a rush of anticipation at the prospect of learning all the kinks Castiel was into and how much they already matched his own.
He glares at her. 4th place behind a retired doctor and a 17 year old girl? He’s irked at himself for being offended.
Okay... That’s not at all what Dean was thinking.
“You don’t understand, I can’t stay. You shouldn’t want me here.” Tears fall down Cas’s cheeks and Dean pulls him in close.
“It really has... you could have called you know.” Cas sniffs.
The manage to get Cas vertical without incident. One hand on the roof Cas positions his crutches in the right spots and Dean grabs the bag. They walk slowly to the door, Dean being super mindful of any icy spots that may have stuck around despite the sunny day. They're in the lobby, Dean pretends not to notice the little bead of sweat at Castiel’s temple as he gets the door closed behind them.
Fortunately for the owners it matched the few other houses remaining at the end of the street. Three squat homes on a cracked pavement road. Each one a dirty shade of white that faded to grey in the years of New Jersey sunshine and smog.
His fists stay tight to his side and Dean can see him struggling to maintain his composure. Meanwhile, Dean’s features feel like they’ve taken on a life of their own. His eyes prickle with the prospect of tears, but at the same time a smile tugs the corners of his mouth up. His heart is fluttering, trapped like a bird, in his chest. He lets out a shaky breath and takes that step Castiel held back, closing the distance between them. The sorrow on Cas’s face melts away, his hands relax and his shoulders sag as Dean gets right in his face.
Dean blinks in surprise, it's been months since they saw each other and suddenly Castiel knows Dean well enough to make a statement like that. He’s about to correct him and offer the opportunity to get to know him much better when Cas speaks again.
The fear that he may die from this.
“Dean could you be a dear and help me with some stretches? Eileen usually does it but she’s late.” As she speaks she dials down her machine to a slow walk.
“What I'm trying to say is, when I think about your accident, about you being hurt, it’s like I can’t freaking breath man. But if you don’t want some nurse then you’ll have to settle for me. I’ll take a leave of absence or something, because you’re too important to me to take a risk like that. And I'm sorry I didn’t talk to you about it first, I owed you that curtesy.”
The man holds up a hand, “Darcy, Mr. Bennet. He’s been arrested; they’re waiting for his lawyers to arrive.”
>>>>>>>>>>>
“Yes, if I get too nervous will you help me remember not to be?”
Dean blinks at the question, “Like to
“Maybe you transfer out there?” It wasn’t a totally ridiculous idea. People moved across the county for work all the time.
“That, Adam my boy, was years of resentment boiling over in a pitiful display of superiority.” Alastair signals to the bartender and he brings them three fresh drinks.
“Aw man seriously? I wanna hear what the deal is!” Adam pouts.
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Castiel’s voice rumbles low in his ear. His lips brushing softly along the delicate skin there, “because as much as Tony might appreciate the show, what I want to do to you requires a bit of privacy.”
He grins, “Kool-Aid, you know like the juice mix?”
“No Sam, it’s not our business. And if he has anything to explain, let Darcy do it himself.”
Dean shakes his head, “No I just... I need some air; I was just going to take a walk.” And he was obviously not running away from Cas or the burning need to apologize to him.
Dean nods, “You’re right. I’ll come back tomorrow; I’ll bring some of his things from home. Maybe that will help?”
Reving the engine Baby roars to life, throwing her into drive he squeals her tires through the garage and out to the main road. It's a clear sunny afternoon, and even with the cold the interior of the car stays pleasantly warm throughout their drive. They don’t really talk, Dean clicked on the radio out of habit and his Led Zeppelin tape fills the silence. Robert Plant finishes singing about a whole lotta love around the time they pull into their own apartment complex. Pulling up to the sidewalk he puts the car in park and looks over at Cas.
“But it’s not fair, you shouldn’t have to change schools because of me! I’ll explain it to him and -”
His deep blue eyes widen. “Are you... rejecting me?”
He runs his hand back up his thigh and barely brushes Cas’s cock. Cas jerks forward, his body seeking out a deeper touch.
“Can we sit down?” Her tone is polite, but Dean knows it’s not genuine.
“Fuck! Six!”
He places his hands on either side of Dean, leans in, and presses their mouths together. Dean closes his eyes and inhales deeply through his nose.
Emma sips her drink and pulls out her tablet, “It was fine till this total bitch in my science class went all crazy about bees. Like I get it, bees are important. All I said was that I was allergic, so they freak me out. And then the bitch, Claire, said -”
“You have several close friendships but most of the time you choose to be alone.”
Cas takes another step closer. “I believed his affections to be fictitious.”
“Great, we got a bunch of nerds, and blood sucking lawyers. Is our pastor coming too?” Dean jokes as they step up to the bouncer.
“Are you lost Castiel?” She sends him a soft smile.
Sam chuckles at him. “Yup! You sure did.”
“Do you want to come back to bed?” Dean presses his lips into the delicate skin of Cas’s palm.
“Dean! Good Morning! Sorry am I early?” She aims that deranged smile at him, and he shudders.
A warmth spreads through his whole body and settles around his heart. The feelings he has for Cas run so much deeper than the physical. He’s only just beginning to understand them. But seeing him in the house he grew up in, accepted so quickly by his family, he knows sooner or later he won’t be able to keep them locked inside.
Flipping Benny off he turns his back and starts peeling. As potato number two is finished his shoulders relax and his hands find a rhythm. Staring ahead he takes a breath and holds it tight. Letting it out he knows what he wants to say. Last night he hadn't been able to do more than give Benny the high points of the accident.
Castiel reaches up and grabs Dean by the wrists, locking his warm hands around him in a vice. Tugging softly, he pulls Dean closer, releasing the hold on his hands and wrapping his arms around his shoulders. Their eyes close as their mouths meet, and to Dean, the kiss feels like coming home.
“We’ll keep it PG, no tongues.” Dean bargains, pulling back from the kiss with a small sigh, “How’s that for compromise?”
Dean bounces on the balls of his feet just outside the garden gate. Shifting his dress shoes on the gravel path. His body, full of energy both nervous and excited, feels like it can barely contain itself. He gave up pacing when Bobby knocked him upside the head and told him to sit the hell down. Which he did for all of three minutes before jumping up again when Gabe came in the upstairs parlor to fetch them.
“Okay Daddy.” he says absentmindedly from the floor.
But as his traitorous eyes make their way over to the bar for what seems like the hundredth time, he sort of wishes he was a little more inebriated. Maybe the liquid courage would have helped him work up the nerve to go say hello to Dean by now instead of just mooning over him from afar. It certainly could have given him a case of whiskey dick, so he didn’t have to worry about sporting an erection in front of his friends.
“No he wouldn’t see me either. Or his sexy uncle just wouldn’t let me in.” She sighs. “I left a message as well. That he needed to get off sulking ass and come home.”
“Take the next one.” He growls out and the doors slide closed in their shocked faces. His back is still to Dean as he swipes the card again and the elevator rumbles upward.
“Ask me again,” Castiel turns his head and bites down on the soft flesh of Dean’s earlobe, “beg me for it.”
“Now,
Looking down at his face, Castiel’s heart clenches. Jack looks so much like her, it hurt him almost as much as the memory of her. It’ll be four years this September since she passed. Everyday Castiel woke up and fought to survive for his departed wife, for the son they brought into this world. It was getting easier, but times like this, when he was reminded how alone he was, he cursed God for taking her away from him and Jack.
“Where is he?”
“Claire, talk to me.”
He’s still pressed up against the hunter, but the hot righteous anger he held on to slipped from his hands as Dean brushes his lips along his jaw. Drawing a ragged breath, Castiel fights to remain in control. They can't fall back into this trap, no matter how amazing it felt to be wrapped up in his beloved’s arms. It was still just a fantasy.
He shakes his gloved hand, “No hard feelings.”
“I think she just wants to be left alone.”
“Hopelessly good looking?” And he winks, she just rolls her eyes.
Castiel’s cheeks and chest flush pink at his teasing and it's about the sexiest damn thing he’s seen in a long time. Cas’s chest is firm and smooth, a small patch of dark hair surrounds his navel and travels further downward.
“Are we locked down?” They had protocol, missing kid, no one left the park. Something they had both agreed on when they first started working together.
As the kitchen fills with the sounds of food cooking and the three of them chatting, love blooms in his heart, he was a total goner.
“I went to the flat to get you some things, I spoke with Dean while I was there.” Ketch holds up a hand to stop the impending bum rush.
“You have a witness!” Cas is practically shouting now.
Dean searches his memory banks and comes up empty handed. He shrugs at Sam.
“But I really like you, and I don’t think we should rush this.”
Dean shakes his head, “I can barely afford to pay for Adam’s medical bills, let alone make a donation to a place like this.”
“Uh sorry, we just wanted to be... prompt.” Sam offers up the apology and the young woman blows a considerably large, pink bubble through her red painted lips. She snaps and pops her gum, assessing them closely.
It may be one dinner, but at this rate, he didn’t even know if he’d make it to tomorrow.
A small smile cracks his tear-streaked face, “You’re a friendly thing, aren't you?”
“That’s a mouthful... but who’d want to party with a bunch of suits?” Lawyer suits being in a different class than nerd suits, in Dean’s opinion. Sam’s work friends were mostly okay. If you didn’t mind that half were social disasters and the other half were arrogant super geniuses.
Dean steps further in the room and kneels next to the bed. Maybe he wasn’t as comfortable with his dad dating as Castiel had thought. But six was a little young to have the ‘what are your intentions with my dad” talk’, wasn’t it?
“Come on Cas, let’s get out of the cold!” He hollers over his shoulder, heart aching for his friend. Let me take care of you. I will never hurt you like that, I will only show you love, if you only let me.
Castiel’s eyes flash over again to the bar, instantly finding Dean in the crowd of people. He's cashing out a couple who look to care more about being wrapped up in each other than they do about paying their tab. But the other bartender is free, he’s wiping down the counter on the far side of the bar. He could run right over and pay; he’d never even have to say a word to Dean if he didn’t want to.
“No, it's not nothing. What aren’t you telling me?” An alarm bell is going off in the back of Dean’s mind.
Not to any Gods or Saints he learned as a boy.
Claire’s cup rattles on its saucer, “How, why?”
“I appreciate your apology, I'm sure it wasn’t easy. And I’m willing to agree to Ms. Moseley helping out till I show improvement. But I have some conditions.” Cas speaks slowly, every word selected with care.
It was going to be a long weekend.
“It wasn’t a sandwich. It was Salisbury steak, or possibly a reanimated liver. I didn’t eat it.” Cas grumbles.
“Adler,” Castiel returns coldly, “your flair for dramatics seems to have pulled both Dean and I away from our day. What’s going on?”
“Yes! Can we have waffles?”
“What about me?” someone says, and it takes both nurses turning to him for Dean to realize he said that out loud.
“So, we’re...” Castiel starts.
“Welcome back to the land of the living.” he smirks.
A voice, more gruff than his own, berated him for close to 20 minutes on the virtues of hard work, family, and duty. Castiel surmised that Bobby and Ellen loved Dean like a son and didn’t see this debt as a burden to themselves. He and his wife saw it as a way to help save Dean, a life preserver tossed out to him on a stormy sea. When Castiel offered to pay for the treatment himself, at first Bobby called him a idiot and tried to hang up the phone.
His mouth does pop open now; this is Dean? This stunning man is his potential sub! Castiel never felt luckier in his entire life. He was expecting far, far less from someone who felt the need to place an obscure personal ad. But Dean had just said he hadn't placed the ad in the first place. Castiel feels his luck rapidly changing. He needed to clarify right away, lest he make a bigger fool of himself than he already had.
Castiel tilts his head in confusion. “I find that hard to believe, looking the way you do.” He gestures to Dean’s face and body with his hands.
“I’m working my way through Castiel’s collection of Kurt Vonnegut. I just finished ‘Cat’s Cradle’. And yes, I enjoyed it very much.”
They speed up to the curb and Cas is out of the car before they even come to a stop. Dean slams the door and is right behind him. Bags forgotten they both run through the gate and to the front door.
“I'm here to get Ms. Collins.”
Benny rolls his eyes, “It’s just onions and garlic.”
Mouth pulled down in a grimace, Castiel’s frown seems more pronounced against the bruising as he aims his expression at the nurse in front of him. Both eyes are open; the calm clear blue tracking the motion of the light. His left eye is bloodshot, but it follows the pen without lagging.
Lydia exhales heavily on the other end, “You’re a lifesaver. Thank you so much.”
Dean fights the urge to grit his teeth; his aunt was a sneak! She knew exactly why he was out here or at least who he was running away from.
Sam Bennet - middle Bennet Sibling, Coder at Netherfield Technologies, hug machine.
“Is everything okay? I didn’t hurt you, did I?”
Thank you all for reading, I hope you stick with me through the rest of it!
Tonight was the night, he was going to ask Eileen how she felt. They’d been dancing around each other for months now.
He grits his teeth, Adam’s the only one who got himself in trouble. He’d been really quick to forget that fact. Hands fisted at his sides; Dean starts to rise out his chair.
Castiel smiles at the photo fondly, there’s a trace of sadness in his voice. But really, he just sounds like he’s speaking of someone he cares about, present tense. That she wasn’t really gone, she was still part of their lives.
He gets up to the concession area and starts making his way up and down the aisles. Over the PA system he can hear their announcer tell everyone they were looking for a missing boy. And if anyone found him to bring him to concourse A.
Completely forgetting he’s supposed to be hamming it up right now, Castiel walks dejectedly back to the dugout, hands fisted at his sides. There’s another member of the hospitality staff, Bethany or Becky, standing there and she’s waving incessantly for Castiel to go back out. The inning break is apparently not over.
Sweet Jesus on a tricycle... That guy is gorgeous! About Dean’s age, dark brows, piercing baby blues, strong jaw, and that mouth....Dean can feel his dick twitch in his jeans and he has to adjust himself under the cover of the bar.
“I guess we’re going in,” he chuckles as Cas closes the door behind them.
“I’m sorry.” He sniffs.
“They brought me back some things,” he points to a plastic bag on the counter behind Dean, “but they implied my clothes were beyond saving so I said to throw them out.”
It does look like sleep, Cas isn’t on a ventilator, chest rising and falling slowly on its own. If Dean focused on the stripe of his bluish grey hospital gown, he could pretend his best friend was taking a nap, like he did sometimes on the couch of their apartment. If he didn’t look at Cas’s face, he could pretend a little longer. So naturally his eyes wander up to the bruises and bandages. The laundry list of injuries playing like a broken record in his ears.
Without warning Dean pulls him close and wraps his arms around Cas’s body. He presses their lips together and Cas feels as though the ground shifts beneath them. Dean’s mouth is soft and yields against the pressure from Cas’s. He finds the other man’s tongue and a wave of lust crashes through him. Their bodies cling to one another and he no longer feels the cold winter night around them.
“We frequently come here to use the work out facilities, Eileen and Sam are joining us today.”
Cas let’s out a quiet chuckle, “It was very nice Dean.”
. The same one from months ago, Dean would recognize the size and shape of it anywhere. Staggering to his feet, Dean stares back at the bird as it watches him cautiously. But not like he’s something to be wary of, more that he’s something the bird is curious about.
“Long term... Doc I think you got it wrong, yeah Adam maybe parties too hard but he’s not an addict.” Dean shakes his head in disbelief, was there a mistake?
Cas opens his eyes, every time Dean looks into them, he discovers some new shade of blue there. Today, in the bright white of his living room their icy and clear. Dean’s happy he wasn’t on the receiving end of that call, Cas looks fierce.
Dean’s mouth is firm and because Cas’s mouth was open, he takes the opportunity to slip just a little tongue in. Castiel sighs and wishes, not for the first time, they had more time for him to explore all the ways Dean could kiss him. But it's over just as quickly as it started.
Cas’s knees hit the mattress and Dean nudges him down. Cas flops on his back and smiles as Dean basically dives on top of him.
“No... no.. you can’t fix it. Please Dean just let me go.” Cas tries to pull away but a Dean won’t let him. Terror is gripping his heart in its wicked claws. He can’t let Cas walk out that door. Not after this weekend. Not after he’s realizing how he truly feels.
It was going to be a long season....
He rolls it over his tongue like a bad piece of fish. It sits heavy and oily in his mouth.
“Probably not, but seriously I’ve never seen you here before and now twice in a month?”
“No it’s nnn...not. Ccc...can I come in? I’m in ttttrr....trouble and I can’t fff... feel my toes.” Cas’s teeth chatter and Mick quickly lets him in. The door closes on the bitter cold behind him.
Cas doesn’t hesitate to respond, “Of course I do. What do you want me to do?”
“That's my boss!” She hisses.
Now for one, Dean thought that was the most disgusting way to get drunk that he could think of. But secondly, he was kind of impressed by the kid's resourcefulness.
“I need those briefs Gabe; it's been a month.” Castiel’s gruff voice dissolves any thoughts of boredom Dean had felt. Every nerve ending in his body cries out at once.
Even with his body reacting physically his brain is still trying to pump the brakes. He can’t stand this woman, she’s annoying, she’s manipulative, she’s probably insane!
She sets her cup down without drinking. “Dean, it's just sex. You're getting something you want, and I'm getting something I want. It’s a transaction, a means to an end. If you can't handle it then you should go.”
“Where the hell are they?” he says aloud to no one in particular.
“What's the name?” the man asks.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“I wanted to check in on your brother, and I needed to speak with you.” Cas speaks plainly as if this were the most common way of getting in touch with someone.
Fighting back the tears that already want to prickle behind his eyes, Dean straightens up and exhales heavily, “Here goes nothing.”
Below her on the dance floor Eileen clings to Sam Bennet like a lifeline. Anna shakes her head in disgust.
“For what,” Dean replies, his hands coming up to tug on the long strands at the back of Castiel’s neck.
“I think she means embarrassing,” Cas adds, looking over at the two girls who have dissolved in a fit of giggles.
“I’m not worried about her, she gave me her personal number well before you said your colorful goodbyes.”
Dean shakes his head; the kid had a one-track mind when it came to that stuff.
“Have you plotted your exit strategy yet?” Eileen walk up, cocktail glass in hand.
He was too busy.
And I scream from the top of my lungs
The crowd roars with laughter as Castiel grabs his foam head, the bat may have been fake, but it was swung hard enough to knock his real head around on the inside.
Dean blinks at the familiar phrase they’ve shared about a thousand times since childhood. It fills him with a hope like he’s never known before. Cas was still in there, no matter how hard he cracked that thick head of his, it couldn’t erase a lifetime of memories. It couldn’t erase Dean, Cas was going to remember him, he was going to come back to him. It was only a matter of time.
Gabe flops back on the couch, “It’s a metaphor! It's not the whole meal, it's just something in between. Till you’re ready for something serious again.”
“Yes, we’ve met. Hello again.” Castiel feels a small prickle of dread. The three men look at him like you might a racehorse up for auction, or possibly the slaughterhouse.
He takes the two steps toward Dean’s bed and sits on the edge.
“Thank you, you ain’t so bad yourself. Now, listen close. When I was nineteen there was this girl named Rhonda Hurley, and she would take me down to her parent’s basement every Friday after class...”
Dean’s totally blushing now, he wants to look away from Cas’s pointed gaze, but he can't.
“Bennet.”
“One minute, you get one and then I’m showering.” Cas sighs grumpily and closes his eyes too.
Castiel clenches a fist at his side, “On what grounds?”
He shakes his head, but deep down he knows. He’s been sensing something wrong with Adam for months. Ever since the trouble with Becky started, ever since they got connected with Alastair Whickham.
“Precisely why Mick and I thought this would be a good arrangement. He doesn’t know
This is the third session at Jericho Rehabilitation Center that’s he’s participated in; and for the money it costs he was willing to suffer the two hours every Tuesday waiting for their turn to speak. Group therapy; as it turned out, was not Dean’s favorite activity.
“Eileen, is Sam coming?” Dean tears his eyes away from Anna’s clear attempt at distraction. He’s not really sure if that’s meant to torment him or Darcy, who is also staring. But right now he doesn’t care.
Dean’s eyes squeeze shut; he wants to keep watching but it's too much. He can feel Cas’s hot breath on his skin. Then he’s surrounded, in a swirl of heat as Castiel wraps his tongue around him.
Dean winces, hoping to avoid a scolding he walks over and plants a kiss on her cheek, “Sorry sweetheart, did I mention you look beautiful today?”
“Hey, watch it!”
The wind is bleeding into his thin coat; he’ll have to head inside soon. But he can’t go back to the apartment... not now anyway. Maybe not ever.
Emma struggles out of his grasp, “But I just -”
“You smell like meat and tomatoes, you’re showering.” She counters. And he discreetly sniffs his shirt. Okay he did smell like chili but who cares? It’s not like he was trying to impress anyone.
“Spit it out son.” Bobby growls.
“Oh, hello Mr. Darcy. I didn’t see you there.” Her voice hardly above a whisper, eyes casting to the floor.
“You’ve been in hermit mode for weeks. I just thought it would be fun to get fancied up. It’s only for one night.” She pouts a little and turns those big green eyes up at Dean. He can feel his resolve crumbling.
Trying to keep up with you
“Dean please, you like Cas. And Cas likes you, dummy. Before you got stupid, he was smiling at you like you were the freaking sun.” She rolls her eyes and starts to get up. “Come on, you gotta help me make the hangover cure and clean up.” She reaches down to help him to his feet.
So, it was about his employment. That was too bad, this job had come at time when he was at his lowest. Kelly had just gotten sick and the benefits with this job helped prolong her care. After she died, Castiel was able to bring Jack out of his own depression by taking him to ball games. It was the only thing that had brought a smile to his face those first few years.
“I don’t think it’s that. Because she’s been extra helpful too. Getting my team lunches, signing off on all the overtime, she’s even the one who offered to pay for the hotel I’ve been staying in.”
Dean chuckles and picks up his cards from the deck, “Ouch, that’s ruthless kid.”
Sam looks fit, tan, and so “California” it makes Dean’s teeth hurt. But more importantly, he looks happy. They're sitting in a faded red booth at their favorite diner; Dean with a mountain of bacon, scrambled eggs, and potatoes on his pate, Sam has an egg white omelet with spinach and tomato on his own. Dean shakes his head when he gave the waiter their order.
“We are stretching, while Mr. Darcy pretends to watch the news.” She says somewhat quietly to Dean. And then a little louder, “would you care to join us Castiel?”
“I don’t know.”
The garden was a mass of weeds and dead blossoms, the paint peeled along the shutters. The front door had scuff marks from various boots, having been kicked repeatedly over the years. And every single window was smudged.
“We didn’t agree to anything.”
Castiel would kill for a little bit of normal right now. He was near drowning in expense reports and had a whining six-year-old clinging to his left leg.
“But you said it was just a crush, for both of us. It wasn’t real.” She looks down at her lap as the tears threaten to fall again.
Dean starts to chuckle, but Castiel smothers the light sound with a heavy kiss. Dean’s lips are as soft and inviting as they look and Castiel falls into their embrace. His tongue lightly teasing on the seam of Dean’s lips, urging him to yield. Dean’s mouth parts on a moan and Cas slides right in.
Sam sighs, he looks behind him to where Eileen and Anna are standing. One smiling, one glaring; looking different as night an day. He turns back to Dean.
Dean spares the cuffs a brief glance, instead he’s staring at the slim vibrator Castiel holds in his other hand, his hazy green eyes going wide at the sight of the toy. Its molded silicone casing jet black and soft to the touch, the form fitting shaft and angled head designed specifically for prostate massage. It was one of Castiel’s personal favorites and while this one was brand new, he had the same one in his own nightstand back home.
“You’re going to relax for a bit and I'm going to try my best to work out the rubble you have trapped in here.”
A minute goes by and they don’t atttempt to move. Instead Dean looks down at Cas’s mouth and back up to his eyes. Cas can see the muscles in his jaw tighten. He runs his hands over Dean’s shoulders and down his bare arms.
“Dean, look at me,” Cas urges, “I’m sorry we tricked you, it was all in good fun.”
Jess tosses her head back in laughter, “You’re awfully grouchy. Long night?”
“Don’t worry Dean, we’ll figure something out.” Sam lays a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Sam was always a glass have full kind of guy. To Dean though, the glass looked full of the brackish dishwater in front of him.
“My last name is Singer, Dean and Sam’s is Winchester. Their parents died when Dean was about four and Sammy was just a baby.” She pauses and his heart sinks into her words like quicksand.
After all, a solider can't go to battle without his armor now, can he?
“Admit what Becky?”
“Hey it’s John Edwards.” Dean deadpans without lifting his head up. Annoyed to have been interrupted and by someone he hadn’t been able to get out of his head for the last few weeks.
Castiel had taken no time to prepare for the role; running on adrenaline and spite he shoved his way into the visitors' locker room and stared with malice in his eyes at the goofy imitation angel. Luckily, the locker room where he changed had been empty. There was no one around to hear his complaints and curses as he stripped down to gym shorts and a wicking t-shirt, Alfie had stressed less clothes were better. He even confided in Castiel that in the summer months, sometimes he only wore his underwear. Castiel eyed the costume suspiciously, making a mental note to check how many times it was cleaned over a season.
Massaging the spot he slapped, Castiel lets up a little on the hold he has on Dean’s back, “That’s right. Now, may I continue?”
He closes the door.
He falters, sucking in water when he should have exhaled, clawing for the surface.
Dean wants to hold on to this anger so badly, but it keeps slipping through his fingers. Sam is right, he practically forced the idea of transferring on him. With Sam gone he had been free to make all the terrible choices he wanted. Now they were all coming back to bite him in the ass.
“I can take you.” Castiel comes down off of his own machine. Everyone gaping at him as if he offered to teach them all the Macarena.
“So, I didn’t get an answer, but we can wait here a minute and I'll try again.”
Donna smiles again, “Thanks Dean!”
Castiel smiles fondly at the phone in his hands and hums the rest of the way to his car.
“She must be thrilled. It’s such a prestigious school. She certainly will fit right in.”
“Wait Becky!”
Stuffing the fake head back on his own, he jogs up and out of the bullpen. Avoiding getting in anyone's way, a security guard lets him past a small gate, and he hikes up a short set of steps to the bleachers. Eyes scanning the crowd through his mask. He wished desperately he could stow it in a locker, but it would take too long.
Her arms uncross and she fiddles with the hem of her sweater, “I said Castiel is scared too.”
“I blew it out of proportion? She’s the one who tried to seduce me in the middle of the damn gym!” He folds his arms over his chest.
“Im sorry, again, but I got a call as soon as we got back into town.” He takes a deep breath. Maybe if he just says it, it won’t be so bad.
He stares straight out the window, too ashamed to look Dean in his beautiful, hopeful, kind, eyes. I’m no good for you Dean. And one day you’ll find that out and you’ll leave too.
“She’s in Philly this weekend, Kevin’s looking at colleges there.” Dean purses his lips, as if deep in thought.
She glances over, “Mr. Darcy I believe you’re staring at me.”
Sitting on a park bench in front of the comic shop, Dean tries his best to hide his gyro from a flock of pigeons while he thumbs through his phone. In his habitual fair weather lunchbreak spot, he doesn’t have much else to do with his allotted hour, after his call to Sam got sent straight to voicemail, besides catch up on fan theories about the new Spiderman movie.
They stare at each other; the situation is more than awkward. Normally he’d be using his best lines to get his partner in the mood, but nothing about this was normal.
“Cas,” Dean whispers into the curve of Castiel’s ear, “kiss me goodnight.”
“I dunno, I'm a pretty tough guy.”
Dean chuckles at the very clever nickname he programed in his phone, knowing if she ever saw it there’d be hell to pay.
Cas tugged on his tie a little, he was nervous. He’d been there all day helping and had managed to avoid seeing Dean. He didn’t want the fact he basically forced Meg into throwing the party to get back to him.
“I’m just saying, if we had an intern...”
And he had to stay an hour late to make up the time lost.
“Of course not, I only meant as someone to keep you company.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Dean nods, “Yep, I finally got around to replacing that timing belt.”
Castiel nods absently, “It’s one of our favorites.”
It was warm inside their apartment, most of the heat from the floors below rose as heat is want to do, and half the time they didn’t need to turn on the thermostat at all. Flicking on the kitchen light he tosses his keys in the bowl and toes off his boots.
He didn't slam the door in his face. If Dean could take any consolation from this, at least he was maybe on the right track when he told Emma that Cas would hear them out. Stealing another breath, Dean fights the urge to pull Cas into his arms. This wasn’t about him, no matter what happened, it was about Emma making things right.
From this angle Dean can see some of the bruising on Cas’s left side has already turned yellowish green as it creeps into his hairline. But the eye socket is still dark purple and a little puffy. The blood in his eye has improved, but the ocean blue in there regards him warily.
Behind a heavy old door there is a bedroom. And in that bedroom a man who never had a home built a sanctuary. He put up pictures of loved ones lost, stored the few precious books and songs that shaped his personality and hid away the parts of himself he deemed too soft for the hard life he lived.
Castiel looks down at their intertwined fingers, concentrating on the light squeeze Dean sends through his hand. He looks up into those impossible green eyes. So full of expectation and want. He was a fool to think he could resist Dean for more than a moment now that they were alone. But truth be told he didn’t really want to resist anything he was feeling right now.
Now its Dean’s turn to look away. What could he tell him? He’s been having inappropriate amounts of freaky sex with the woman trying to steal their house; he’s barely said two words to their youngest brother in weeks, unless you count shouting curses back and forth; or he recently found out Castiel was falling in love with him, and Dean wanted to simultaneously bloody his perfect face and throw up from nerves. Oh, and don’t forget the guy we hired to get out of the housing crisis may or may not be a pedophile and murderer!
Sam bends down and gets Adam’s arm around his shoulder. This time the kid doesn’t protest, and Sam’s grunts a little as he pulls him up to his feet.
“So, besides scaring employees what’s new?” Dean’s appetite magically returns now that Becky is gone, and he takes a giant bite of his burger.
“Hey Becky, what can I do for you?”
Dean shakes his head, “See, it was all about the casting choices for me.”
“One moment please.” She’s full out frowning now and she turns away from him to pick up the phone.
Castiel is more than ready to wrap up the call and continue their negotiations, he gruffly speaks into the phone before the other Dom can continue, “Thank you for the invitation Cain. We’ll talk soon.”
“Sorry, I uh... know the family who owns it.”
, was enough for Castiel to wish he was the one being pampered and doted on by the owner.
Next chapter we have a time jump, mainly because I wanted to put these boys in more of an established relationship before what comes next. Things will get a little angsty for the better part of Dean's POV but I 100% assure you it gets resolved quickly. I just had to add drama because I'm a trashcan...
“And the guy raises his eyebrows and says, "No kidding? What law firm do you work for?"
She sighs heavily into the phone, “Well I guess that depends on your answer to my next question.”
She freezes and for a second Dean can see her delusional school teacher face morph into something much more sinister. But it vanishes just a quickly.
She smiles, “I would assume at home, back in the city.”
He pulls on his other boot and grabs his leather jacket from the hook in the locker. Closing it with a hearty slam he picks up his bags and heads down the hall. Up the stairs and out to the parking lot, he whistles a jaunty tune all the way to the car.
Without a word he picks up the phone and buzzes his assistant.
Dean own lips threaten to tug into a smile, but he clamps it down in fear, “Hello. Where am I? And who are you?”
“Alright, I don’t have time to get changed. Do you have a description? I’ll join the search.”
“Oh Jeez! What are you doing here?” He yelps. Cas’s eyes look tired, and his tie is undone around the collar. Was he up all night too, Dean wonders?
“I like this song” Dean says and smiles when Castiel jumps a little at the sound.
Dean feels it all and before long he’s feeling something much heavier than the physical sensations in his body. He's feeling warmth and light pouring from his open heart, wrapping the two of them up in an embrace that coats him from the inside out. And it's so consuming, he doesn’t notice the rapidly fading light outside the window or the fact that he’s forgotten all about Castiel’s mystery bag and the plans they had made for the evening.
“Are you kidding me!?” Dean shouts. Fucking 18-year-old bullshit. Dean feels like he got mauled by a bear.
“Understandable, but I did tell you that secrets would be revealed and that you would make a discovery did I not?” Castiel smiles cheekily at him, blue eyes twinkling in the sun. The tension leaving his shoulders in the process.
“No, I suppose I don’t" Castiel grits out and Gabe laughs at them both.
"I'm going to fuck you,” Castiel continues, “and when I do, you’re going to come again.”
Dean suppresses a shudder, “Yes, I would like that very much Cas.”
“How many times?”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
“Oh I see, now that you’re home and have been throughly fucked, you’re going to turn right back into a snarky bastard, aren’t you Cas?” Dean’s smirking and he knows Cas is going to retaliate. But he missed teasing him this last month. He has a lot saved up.
Ellen and Bobby exchange another look, very different than the one before.
How the hell did she know that? “Were you following me? I had dinner, with my aunt and uncle there. It was just dinner!”
They walk to the kitchen and Jack drags his helper stool out from beneath the sink. He washes his hands as Castiel takes out the wet ingredients for waffle batter. He didn’t know how to cook much, but breakfast seemed to be one of the few things he excelled at.
Dean stops and turns to where Cas is standing in the open doorway. Cas slowly steps outside and shuts the door behind him. He approaches Dean with caution like you might an animal in the wild.
“So, she’s staring at us right, like she’s about ready to call security. And I’m thinking, shit, I will do just about anything to make this girl leave right now. So, I did the only think I could think of.”
He and Adam have a shouting match so bad one night the kid leaves and doesn’t come back for two days. He called Mike, Lou, anyone he could think of in a panic till Adam came strolling in the door. He looked defiantly at Dean, daring him to ask where’d he’d been. Dean doesn’t give him the satisfaction. He unplugs the Xbox and locks it in the trunk of his car instead. Maybe that will teach the brat a little respect.
“I’m back,” he sighs.
He gets out of the car and comes around to take Cas’s things, opening the passenger door for him and stowing his belongings in the backseat. Crutches clattering to the floor of the car.
“I think they’ll just deduct it from my bill.”
“Did I... just agree to dance with Castiel?”
“No, you’re working,” Cas pauses, Dean can hear the sound of a car door closing, “I’m just going to get him out of the heat and maybe he’ll feel better.”
“That’s a pretty big word for someone your age. Where’d you hear it?”
But you could hide beside me
At the back of the room is a locker a bit larger than the others and Dean throws the door open. A huge red face grins down at him, eyes wide with manic energy. Dean pulls out the head and sets it on the bench. The body hangs limply behind where the head had been, red furry skin in a grey baseball uniform.
“Oh that’s cool,” Dean nods noncommittally, knowing Emma and her mom frequently butted heads regarding Lydia’s social life, “if you want to come back after dinner, I can pick you up.” If he had to reschedule with Castiel, it wouldn't be the end of the world. The Dom seemed more than interested to strike up a conversation and Dean felt confident that he would be seeing him again very soon.
Nodding, Dean cuts his eyes away from the other man, he probably shouldn’t have barfed all that out on Castiel, but apparently it was sharing night at the Winchester house, “Uh huh, but I can see that I was wrong.”
“I’m not really in the mood for company right now,” Castiel grumbles from somewhere in the blankets.
Adam huffs out a breath and slumps back into his chair. “What the hell was that about?”
“What are they?”
Dean kisses his hand again. Caressing the tips of Cas’s fingers along his lips. “Do you want me to stop?”
Cas scoffs in shock, but he’s smiling, “Fuck you very much!”
“Double or nothing he doesn’t last another date.”
He’s going to scream if he has to stay on the phone another minute with this psycho.
“Thank you for inviting me here Dean. I’m having the best time.” Cas’s voice is already soft with sleep and Dean can feel the heartbeat under his hand slow down.
His face falls for just a fraction of a second, “That it was all for you.”
He shivers, now that he’s alone, the night felt a lot colder than it had when Cas was curled up against him. He jogs over to the Impala and slides into the driver seat. He grips the wheel tightly, willing his nerves to settle. Blowing out a breath he starts his own car and heads the opposite way of Castiel for his house.
6/24/21 This work is on hiatus but not abandoned or orphaned.
She doesn’t take another minute to think and bolts like a rabbit into her car. Engine revving, she flies down the driveway and off into the night.
“You’re shouting, of course I can hear you.” the familiar tumble of rocks in a tin can has Dean’s eyes flying open.
“Hey Kendall Jenner, can we eat it now?”
Extracting himself from Dean’s octopus grip with an eyeroll, he pads naked to the kitchen for a snack comes back to find the other man in the same exact position he left him in. Unwrapping the chocolate bar, he waves the candy in front of Dean’s face till the other man’s head perks up.
She’s almost to the door now, tripping over her feet in the long grass.
“Where are my manners, I’m Missouri Moseley. I’ve been assigned to Mr. Novak’s at home care.”
He just nods at her, freaking traitor! He was laughing just as loud as Dean was.
Cas growls and shuts his eyes again. “I’m not cranky, I’m just tired.”
Dean may not have written in a while but he could compose verse after verse about those eyes alone.
“Hello Dean.” a gravelly voice has his eyes flying open in surprise.
But then he’d noticed all three men standing by Wickham; their eyes troubled but defiant in the face of an inevitable fight, and his white hot anger plummeted straight into icy fear.
Dean kisses him again, licking into his mouth and then he’s coming wrapped up in their joined hands. Coming with Castiel’s name on his lips and a hand in his hair. Castiel chases him right over that edge, vision whiting out as he empties himself all over their fists.
“All the way out here?”
Dean is totally confused by this sudden change in attitude from Anna. She’s barely said a dozen words to him and half of them were vaguely threatening. What does she want from him?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
He twists the head of Dean’s dick roughly in his fist, drawing another cry from his lips. Cas bites along the bolt of Dean’s jaw, sucking a mark just below his ear.
“Dean, I'm sorry... I had no idea...”
“Yes, you did some great sharing today, go head down to the common room. Dean, I'll walk you out.”
“Buddy, you need to help me with your pj’s.” Castiel murmurs.
“Very good sir.” And with a nod he’s off, to bed himself Castiel assumes.
Cas doesn’t respond right away and Dean’s stomach flip flops with dread. Maybe he was coming on too strong. He had just told Cas an hour ago they barely knew each other. Now he was texting like a teenage girl. The phone pings again and his face splits into a wide grin.
“Good Evening, I’m Kate, I'll be your server. Would you care for something from the bar?”
He may as well have been saying goodbye too, after the way Dean talked to him.
Dean closes his eyes; it wasn’t going to work. He was going to get away again. And more people would get hurt, “What about the drugs?”
“See I told ya, family. Now put me down Dean-o, this suit is French silk.” The smaller man tries to weasel his way out from Dean’s fists, which are both firmly gripping his lapels, lifting him a few inches off the ground.
“I’m fine. Just waiting for my brother to finish up.” He waves a hand behind him and his voice, concrete wrapped in velvet, sucker punches Dean right in the gut.
He excuses himself and sets his brandy on the table. The bathroom is easy enough to find, once finished with his necessities he washes up. His real reason for coming in here vibrates in his pocket. His phone’s been going off steadily for the last two hours. He pulls it out and sends up a silent prayer to any God who will listen for it to not be Becky. He just wanted this time away from her, she couldn’t get to him here. He was sure of it; she didn’t even know he was in Brighton.
The house was not what you’d call beautiful but it had been a wonderful home for many years and was loved by those who lived there. Although it looked as though the lover may have taken an interest in sadomasochism.
He's hemorrhaging from a thousand wounds to the heart, but they are all bloodless.
to do that again, but he’s more coherent with the pain than he was a minute ago without it. He takes stock of his body, knowing now he cannot magic away any injuries without his grace.
Dean puts a hand on his arm and squeezes it gently. He’s smiling but Cas can recognize the flicker of concern in his eyes. Asking an unspoken question, is everything okay?
Dean opens his mouth, ready to read him the riot act when a knock at the door stops him.
Adam’s slipper clad foot taps a dull rhythm on the linoleum floor. His hands tremble as he pulls out a folded sheet of lined paper. His lopsided scrawl visible on both the front and back, Dean adjusts his position in the faded green chair. This was going to be a long 25 minutes, and his back was not going to thank him for it anytime soon.
“Once I explained who I was he let me know you went down the path. We chatted for a few moments; I can see why you like him; he’s quite the looker.”
He looks over and standing in the lobby, wearing some very expensive looking work out gear, are Anna Bingley and Castiel Darcy.
He just needed to blow off some steam. Work was stressing him out too much. Once he did that, he was certain all thoughts of Dean Bennet would be eradicated from his mind.
“You’re kind of a nerd, aren’t you?” He shakes Dean’s hand again awkwardly. That same electric current ripples through his veins. What is that about?
“Oh, I don’t know maybe because you’re Dean freaking Winchester?”
“Sir?” Castiel looks over at Zachariah now, his brow furrowed in confusion.
“What’s the matter Dean? Darcy keeping you on a short leash?” She smirks.
The same car from last night pulls up and the driver is out the front seat to his side before Dean can even stand up. He opens the back passenger door without a word.
