Moments later, cool, spit slick fingers brushed over Cas' hole. One finger breached the tight ring of muscle and pressed inside.
"Did you gave me your blood?" Castiel asked realizing his strength the last few weeks.
A few years later Dean was offered an associate's job at Bobby's firm then
“Cassy!” Gabriel was smiling widely, a lollipop was hanging on his lips, next to him Charlie and then his eyes fell on the third person in the Hospital wing. Green eyes, freckles, and sandy hair.
"Listen here, take my car keys, and go to my apartment, the key is under the doormat. There's food on the fridge and you can sleep on my bed...Okay?" Castiel leans and whispers to Sam, his eyes full of protectiveness.
Dean should be furious, Sam let Cas come to this madness, but he knows Cas choose this, Dean doesn’t know what to do, his vision is blurry as some mutants circle him, most of them were already dead.
"Mmm..." he hummed.
Dean’s voice was steady. Cas listened to him with full focus, his lips partly open and eyes big and curious.
Cas took a small internal breath, okay,
Castiel moaned, Dean's lips were soft and hot against his own,  he kissed so hungrily yet so sweetly which made Cas see blissful white.
Both breathing hard, they looked at each other and Castiel felt so warm. Dean fucked him so good. Pulling away felt like a sin right now.
make me think of
When night fell, Cas grabbed his extra coat and another woolen blanket and sat there, watching the cute predator, he couldn't leave him alone.
Dean's breath hitched when Castiel's hand brushed through his ass.
Dean kissed his way around Cas' chest. He circled Cas' hole with the pad of one finger, and Cas tensed and whined eagerly.
“Dean—”
“Hi, how are you? How are the classes? Sick costume by the way.” she smiled unbothered and friendly. Dean started to feel some type of tension between him and Cas.
“Cas, I thought you said Gabriel was at Stanford.” Dean hissed, and Castiel thought he’ll pass out.
Kudos and comments are appreciated <3
Groaning at the fat head entering him, Castiel glanced at Dean who's whole body twitched and flexed as Castiel bottomed out, settled in his lap.
Dean is such an amazing person to take him in.
Ben frowned and hugged his dad tightly, "No, dad, don't be, papa loves you..."
Dean closed his mouth;
Dean and Castiel have some steamy moments as they missed each other so much until a phone call comes.
sake, it was just a game.
He pulled him into his chest, wrapping his strong arms around the shaking accountant. Castiel sobbed collapsing to Dean.
He crawled towards Dean, turned around, and settled his knees on either side of his chest, ass up unto his husband's face, he hissed when his now wet cock touched Dean's pecks. Castiel lifted his head and was met with Dean's rock-hard cock, it was leaking precum and he didn't lose time before diving in and swallowing the fat head.
They hit it off immediately, Castiel being an open flirt and pushing his way into Dean's heart the best possible way, with his quick and smart comebacks and that confident attitude.
Castiel almost choked on Dean's cock at the sensation,
“I love you,
He would have sworn he saw Dean’s jaw tightening when Meg rested her hands on his ass.
Especially when he talks to Castiel like he talks to his high school crush.
"I--uh, I-
The green-eyed man smiled at him and opened his mouth to say something but he didn't complete it as a small boy started jumping with
“Sam, please come into my posit—”
"Ah-Dean..."
Castiel felt his heart drop, cold blood running through his veins.
Panting, Castiel grinned and brushed his fingers on Dean's come-stained chest, swiping his thumb at the warm seed and offering it to Dean who opened his mouth like a hungry bitch. Lapping at his thumb, Dean sucked his fingers cleaning them like a good boy.
He felt his eyes water, but not for her harsh words but for what Dean is going to do tomorrow. He was going to marry this horrible woman.
Dean lifted his face and looked deep into Castiel's eyes.
Cas froze and Dean almost sobered with terror, but then his best-friend melted on him and scrambled his hands up the back of Dean's shirt, scraped his fingers up his sides, then pulled him in closer to deepen the kiss.
Dean is drunk.
After calling Sam, Cas sat next to him, he was silent and looked down on his lap, Dean couldn’t get his eyes off him, he knew he was safe, Cas’ aura was calm and nervous at the same time.
Castiel took a breath and climbed off Dean, he turned to face him and lied next to him. Dean smiled at him and pulled him into his chest, Castiel buried himself in the warmness of Dean and wrapped his arm around his panting stomach.
Dean melted into him and started crying, painful sobs burying in Castiel's neck. The green-eyed man tightened his hold on him.
Dean's hands went to his belt buckle, and Castiel couldn't hold back anymore. He stepped forward and worked Dean's pants open himself. While he worked the zipper down, Dean tugged at Castiel's shirt. They danced through undressing each other, finding each other's mouths again when they were both clear of their shirts.
Dean froze then arched up with a soft hitch of breath and flooded Castiel's mouth with come. He sucked him through it, pushing it to the edge of overstimulation before he backed off, sliding free, swallowing and sucking in oxygen.
Castiel gulps as the thick length hang in front of him waiting for his attention. Lord, it was the biggest cock he had ever seen.
As Dean worked a finger into Castiel's hole, Castiel slid his mouth down over Dean's ear lobe, biting softly. They both moaned as Dean found Castiel's prostate, he fucked him with his fingers, working him open. The pad of  Dean's thumb pressed against Castiel's perineum as he worked his prostate from the inside, Castiel sucked in a breath and let it out as a moan.
He already could feel his dick rock hard pressing on his jean's zipper quite painfully. It took seconds for Dean to start rubbing their hard clothed erections together as the bigger man sucked on his collarbone. Castiel was a whimpering mess.
"Uh, yeah, hi."
“Hey, Gabe we need to go do that thing at the library—”
"Yet, you're quite a charmer, I always had a thing for barbaric strong men," The king slid his fingers under his belly button and then went below it, brushing his fingers on the patch of golden hair that disappeared under his satin tunic. Dean couldn't help the throaty groan that escaped his damn mouth.
Dean rolled the condom on his cock and then crawled once again giving Cas a messy dirty kiss. He ran both his palms down Cas' chest and shuffled backward to settle between his legs.
"I-I De-an Winchester, t-take you..."
Sometimes it feels like a lie, such a great and hot vampire drinking from him,
"Go now in peace and live in love, sharing the most precious gifts you have the gifts of your lives united. And may your days be long on this earth. I now pronounce you husbands. You may kiss now." Missouri completed with a huge grin.
Cas stutters angrily, watery eyes flushing so much hurt.
"I'm sorry, Cas, this took a weird turn, please forgive me, I'm not trying to make you feel sorry for me-"
"...So I was thinking about painting your car a neon pink, they say it's very chic—"
"C-Cas?" Sam's voice was quiet and a bit croaked.
The green-eyed jock smiled once again and Castiel took a deep breath.
Why he was acting like that? What did Dean do?
whined, squeezing his eyes shut as Dean caught his teeth against the blue-eyed man's nipple. He squirmed on the floor, his back already sticky with sweat and catching the cover-up in a twisted mess under him. He tried to stretch his legs wider, hook Dean's hips and pull him closer in the hopes that grinding up against him would encourage him to
his consciousness tells him.
"Want you so much Cas..." he whispered sensually, his breath tickling Castiel's lips. He tried to chase his lips but the green-eyed man gave him a teasing peck before moving into his cheek and then brow and finally the corner of his lips.
"De-an, god, you insane assbutt..." Cas said between kisses, everyone around them went wild and he heard some friends shout
His eyes watered but he wouldn't cry and mess his black underliner, it hurt yes, and he wanted to scream in frustration, rage, and pain but he couldn't disappoint his fans. He worked hard to be here.
Suddenly sleep and relaxation was not very important to him. Lust and adrenaline ran through his veins as he was ready to surround himself like a bitch in heat to Dean. Which felt kind of familiar.
"Uh, Dean this is Chris..." Cas' voice is small when he introduces his date, who apparently couldn't wait for him at the lobby of the building.
“If this is a trap, I’m going to fucking kill—”
Yet, like a normal human being, he craved love and touches, and generally physical sensations.
“Go see him,” he confirms nodding to the door behind them.
Well, it isn’t Dean’s fault he was falling too easily—
Dean tried to stay still, unwillingly his cock twitched from the warm touch, cursing his brittle flesh weakness, the barbarian tried to not do anything unexpected and make the young emperor angrier, cause he damn was,
Grabbing his car keys, the young artist left his apartment in a rush, his heart clenching in fear and emotions. He hadn't seen Dean in almost 1,5 months, lots of sleepless nights of crying and overthinking about the one who broke his heart were enough to feel the dread of reuniting with
“Hope you do something about it…” Lisa gives him a small understanding smile as she presses her lips on his cheek.
“Yeah…” he smiled, not realizing Castiel’s frown.
"You being beautiful and sexy is just a bonus!"
"You bored?" Dean asked, and his breath tickled his cheek.
“I did you a favor, Lisa told me that this jerk will play you around, use you only in bed,” Dean says quietly, eyes blinking open as he glares at Cas.
Panting slower now he lifted his head to notice that the king was now towering over him, his thick thighs peeking from the cut of the transparent silk linen. Dean felt disgusted with himself. Why he suddenly felt lust circle him instead of revenge?
He dares to look at the blue-eyed man, his heart drops when he notices Cas' annoyed look he sighs disappointed with himself. Chris continues to have that stupid smile on his lips.
Guess he wasn't the only one who didn't like Carmen,
“A wolf without a pack is an omega, meaning they don’t belong anywhere until they find a pack to follow… Then there are betas who are the usual wolfs who belong in the pack and follow every rule of it…Every pack needs a leader though, someone who will look after them and protect them, that’s the Alpha Cas.”
“Hey, Anna!” Cas’ smile didn’t reach his eyes.
After Cas got up and turned to greet them, he smiled at them with his plump gorgeous lips. Today he was wearing an AC/DC t-shirt and jeans. Dean almost had heart-eyes at the sight.
The blue-eyed man staggered back a few steps.
Alcohol and sweat was the first thing Dean inhaled when they entered the frat party house. Oh, yeah and weed.
Cas should be here next to him and Sam, as he waits for...Carmen. Dean tried to ignore the ugly feeling that wrapped around him when he thought about his fiance in the past few weeks.
, he couldn't wait to spend his life with him.
Dean was moaning breathlessly biting his bottom lip, "So fucking good..."
"Will do. The auto shop is the same as always, I'm really close to getting the promotion, Bobby seems pleased with my work, maybe you're speaking with the future manager of 'King Mechanic'," Dean chuckled.
Castiel closed his eyes, he couldn't understand... and he wanted to
The thing he knows is that silver is bad for them, it weakens them.
He didn’t even anticipate answering as Cas opened the car door.
Cas turned to Balth, blushing once again and shaking his head embarrassed, the roof garden of Titania Hotel Charlie picked for the party is pretty crowded with Michael Bublé playing softly in the background.
Benny growled stepping forward but Castiel stopped him, putting his hands on the Wolf’s chest, he understood Benny, he really did, but if they start bad, their battle may develop wrong in so many ways. Bobby turned giving a knowing glare at Benny.
"Wake up, barbarian!"
“Guys? Can I have your attention?” Dean leaned to the big map desk behind him. The other pack members gathered around him, Ellen giving him a friendly pat, Jo ignored him though like always.
“Charlie!” he said and couldn’t help but smile, even if his insides were twisting, making him nauseous.
Dean snorted, licking a wet stripe on his cheek, Castiel laughed.
In a few seconds, Sam called.
As Dean was towering before him, Castiel slowly lowered himself to his knees, the green-eyed man's cock now in front of his face, hard and leaking. Reaching up, he began to stroke, staring up at Dean's face who groaned a moan and closed his eyes. Dean's hips began to thrust,  allowing Castiel to hold his hands still as the impressive cock stroked itself in his grasp.
After that night, Mick grabbed him and took them away, said enough vampire adventures for a while. However, he couldn't stop thinking and dream about those green eyes. They say when you drink vampire blood you see lustful visions in your mind. The problem was Castiel doesn't remember Dean giving him his blood at all. Everything was a haze. Although the certain memory of Dean's body on him, his scent and his fangs in him were so, real. There's no way he imagined.
The blue-eyed man, gasped in fear as he fell on his back, scared at the surprising movement.
"You have no idea how I fucking missed you..." Dean continued kissing Castiel, tongue slipping in as they sucked onto each other's lips.
, his daughter had small anger issues but she quit behaved today, usually, she's a bit difficult.
‘A deal is a deal after all.”
Castiel shivered as he couldn't remember anything except--
Sitting there in the silent woods, Cas sighed once again. It was hard being alone, but he managed. It was
When Castiel ran inside the LMH Health center, he found a nurse on the reception, her eyes met his and she smiled sympathetically after looking the condition Castiel was.
A painful ache in his chest throbbed but he pushed it away from his mind.
“What the fuck?!”
"Whatever I don't have time for this..." he said ready to get up, Cas was quicker and closed the distance pushing him back on the chair.
A loud cry of pain made him stop dead in his tracks.  Castiel’s heart was about to rip off his chest. His ears ringed and hands were trembling.
, for Balthazar.
What happened next was a
Dean leaned in and Castiel met him halfway, pressing their lips together in a close-mouthed kiss.
Dean grabbed his fist in a supernatural beat and pulled Cas closer to him, before pushing him against the wall, placing his other hand on Cas' waist.
Castiel was nervous, to say the least, he hadn't gone on a date for almost 4 years and
He didn't regret anything. Everything happened for a reason. He knew Dean was a lot more than what he showed, he practically raised Sam as their parents were dead, never arguing and never depriving away anything from his baby brother.
Except when something was upsetting him…
Dean shoots a fake smile at them and transforms again into the carefree and confident man he tries to be, offering his hand to Cas' date. Cas appears to understand this and his face hardens, blue eyes furious.
as everybody else did.
He was supposed to be here two hours ago, as he has a load of shit meetings and a freaking trial in at least one hour, but he slept like hell. The fact that he still couldn't get up to the 46th floor and face a very specific person is definitely not why he's late.
… God, those green eyes he dreamed almost every night, the heartbreak of their separation still sharp, even after all these months.
except his freaking toys. At least he's not spoiled.
“Why aren’t you mad? Why aren’t you gone?” Dean blurted, he knew he told Cas to come with him, but why he still acted so caring towards Dean? After all Dean put him through?
Gabe looked at him scared as hell, eyes so wide, his aura going crazy with emotions.
Also, his life has some adventure now, if it wasn’t threatening him or his close ones hell he’ll kinda be happy.
"What happened?"
Is he using crafts of the spirit world to have those powers? Dean had heard rumors of powerful leaders of Egypt that were gifted from Horus the divine source of sovereignty and son of Isis and Osiris. Protector of the Sun and Moon.
"I need two burgers deluxe and a pack of onion rings," she told him before disappearing towards the bar. The blue-eyed man groaned internally and wiped the sweaty drops off of his forehead. Today
Pounding him with a brutal pace now, Dean wrapped his hand around his cock, slick with his own pre-come, and stroked, twisting his palm around the head in time with every thrust.
"That's cool, man." Dean almost burked.
Dean was a
"Cas..." Dean said softly.
Dean froze dreadfully when he turned around and met with Cas’ surprised flushed face. A hint of a smile was curling into his red bitten lips.
The kiss was soft, affectionate, and calm, no rush, just a simple passion that graced their lips into a beautiful spark. The feeling of Dean's tongue making Castiel feel like he's never felt before.
He turned around to meet Dean’s other best friend, the redhead he adored so much. The dork, the legend,
“You’re so tight…” Michael hissed, touching his lips on Cas’ neck and started sucking the warm skin. He moaned and tightened his legs that were wrapped around the other male.
“When this mess stops, you own me a DnD game!”
It wasn't long before Dean pressed a kiss to his lips, soft and simple, "I may have seen a nice private cave..."
Dean shook his head, Cas was his other best friend, he meant it friendly, not that the blue-eyed man wasn’t adorable.
yourself.
The green-eyed man was about to hit the wall once again but Castiel was faster and pulled Dean into his chest, wrapping his arms around the taller man's back he started stroking his neck with assuring comfort.
depressing but he feels a part of his heart died that day, sometimes he wishes it was him instead, that
Castiel was clenching his phone so tight, his knuckles were white. Gabriel did leave a message on his phone, telling him he’ll be in Kansas for the weekend due that his classroom for some reason got on fire (his brother laughed nervously at that).
. So many years both of them hiding their feelings, so many years living with the thought of not being able to express how they both feel.
It will work,
take the bad memories and the nightmares out of his daily routine.
"Hello, gorgeous..." Dean smirked, "I see you remember me."
Castiel gasped when he saw an iron bar full of guns knives, and blades. They were hunting rifles and bullets of every kind.
and Dean is just a few inches away. The blue-eyed man gasped and stepped back a few footsteps.
he asks curling a small smile that melts Castiel’s heart right away.
Castiel couldn’t handle it, he broke up with Dean, it was too hard to be with him and watch him raising another woman’s kid.
He was in the ER.
“Well, it’s something like a secret bunker. No one knows about it, except my pack and now, you…”
Dean cleared that he didn’t do relationships and he didn’t make love. He always avoided the subject, like it was a fire. Castiel wasn’t surprised, Dean had only two emotions—at least he only showed those—
It growled angrily as from the road started appearing at least 5 big jeeps. Dean felt them about 5 minutes but tried to keep his wolf form calm, so they won’t suspect anything.
. He turned to the guys who looked at him in excitement. Balth grinning again like a fucking Cheshire cat.
Without thinking Castiel grabbed the metal fork and knife from the diner’s bag he got on lunch for tonight, he hated eating with plastics, so he always carried his own cutlery.
" he jumped from the small stage and landed on his knees dramatically pointing at Cas.
As he approached, Dean lifted his head from the phone. His eyes met with those gorgeous forest green eyes and Castiel forgot his whole existence.
Castiel checked if the field was clear before lowering his gun, his full attention on Dean ripping Gabe’s ropes carefully but fully intensely. Benny growled behind him, the grey wolf bumping him hard, Castiel shook his head and heard a sharp high-pitched cry.
They both winced as they looked at each other, "
His eyes were closing, he felt the energy of the wolf inside him trying to fight it, but the poisonous DNA made a contrast complication towards his human DNA and his animalistic one.
Castiel felt the Barbar closing his palms on his hips, holding him tight and ready to thrust.
"Cas,
Before Castiel could answer, Dean turned him around hard, pulling him close to him, their chests glued together and Castiel’s breath is caught in his throat. Dean’s hand travels on his ass.
He cannot eat eggs every night, he doesn’t even eat eggs in the morning.
“What do you mean? I’m still a bit confused…” He was confused but in the best way possible. Was Cas feeling the same as he did?
he was.
"He got into a fight at the bar, Jody brought him, warmed me if it happens again she'll will not have a choice but to arrest him...I-It's the third time in a row..."
And he obviously doesn't have feelings for Cas.
but he didn't understood why he felt like this... It's like he knew the taller man years, it felt like Dean was
Cas frowned as his eyes fell onto the taller man's ribcage, it was wounded. Like--like a bullet was there earlier. And those
It was perhaps the best for Cas not to see him leave, the blue-eyed man wouldn’t let Dean go alone, his angel was too stubborn.
Cas moaned at the soft beard which tickled his jaw in the best way possible. When Dean's hands trailed all over his body, leaving nothing untouched, Cas was burning with lust. Their lips were fighting hungrily against each other, and the blue-eyed man thought they bleed and suck the blood.
Texas was one of the few states that had almost no entertainment services or even bars for Vamps. Generally, the Texian folk was still living in the middle ages. There was zero equality towards the Vampires.
"What you want Cas?" Dean whispers, as his finger circle Cas' dry little pucker. Cas groans louder and rests his head on Dean's neck breathlessly.
“Fine, you know numbers and stuff, boring stuff…anyways, nice seeing you, uh—have f-fun.” He stuttered awkwardly before disappearing from the kitchen, Dean’s heart dropped for a second.
His beard felt unfailingly amazing.
The wolf's chest heaved in a damp, painful sounding breath, which it let out with a low whine, and then it went still again.
Cas hesitated but nodded, Sam gave him a shoulder squeeze before taking out his phone.
"I have something in mind..."
Dean took his t-shirt off with a quick smooth move, revealing his toned strong body.
Dean surely looked a lot soberer now.
"I owe you a date." Dean kissed his collarbone.
To say Dean isn’t surprised will be an understatement, but it was the only way they wouldn’t hurt the Novak kid.
“That’s why we always stayed in motels and you avoided bringing me to your place…” Cas realized, mostly talking to himself.
, he looked so good, Dean’s strong biceps, his toned muscles, and broad shoulders were to die for, his flaming pentagram tattoo making contrast into his beautiful freckled tanned skin.
Castiel turned away abruptly, he hated these sounds and the image of broken bones and blood. His stomach twisted, he felt sick shortly after.
. I am faster in my wolf form, but a jackass hunter noticed me and shot me with a silver bullet, silver is bad for me. I could have died Cas...
Castiel marked him with his intense gaze, eyes traveling all over Dean's body hungrily. When their eyes met, Castiel leaned closer, their faces just a small amount of inches apart. Dean couldn't help himself but lick his lips as his stare fell to the plush lips of the young emperor.
"I will
he could admit the scenery looked like a horror movie scene, he laughed awkwardly, ignoring the sound, it was probably his imagination, or something fell from his trunk.
And so, it went Dean with Sam, Bobby, Ellen, and Benny offering ideas at what they could do, what plan they needed to apply. Charlie took him to the library and started asking him questions about his life, she was distracting him and Castiel appreciated it so much.
"I still think I don't deserve you..."
There was a small part of him that thought about how Dean is straight and he was just being friendly, but after tonight’s stolen glances and hungry eyes, he can confirm:
“Well, my job here is done.” She said grinning and winking at him before patting his shoulder and walking away.
Cas choked on his own tongue. "
, that weird red-head, she was pretty in a very witchy way, Sammy was head over heels for her, said she's smart and sassy and so, so foxy.
“You’re a werewolf.”
"I'm sorry I overreacted..."
Castiel felt numb, he sang his heart off and danced with all of his mental and physical power. It was one of the most stressful performances, his feelings and emotions were pushed so deep on the back of his mind and gut, the multi-awarded star didn't notice the room spinning.
Everything works out, the happy ending they deserve finally comes and it's here to stay.
but who cares? God never said anything about them.
Castiel couldn’t help but grind his ass on Dean's crotch slowly as the song continued making him confident.
Castiel knows the time they missed will never come back, but they have now.
His blue-eyed angel was running, he was pointing a gun, shooting like a real fucking hunter every bastard he had on one feet distance.
"Cassy, love, I know everything is shit right now, but we need to start, the Intro track is almost finished! Do you have your earpiece on?" Balthazar came running towards him, his schedule placed tight under his armpit and his headpiece on power so he could communicate with the team.
You’re in love…
.” He blurts, voice cracking.
"I don't usually date guys, but when I saw you, man...I had instantly a crush on you..." Dean chuckled too. Castiel felt fluttered and his cheeks heated.
"Mmm..." he moaned,
"Never do that again..."
"Come on," Dean put an arm on his shoulder and led him on a cozy, two-person table.
his dick was so hard, it hurt.
Dean turned then, his eyes meeting Castiel’s. He smiled brightly and came closer once again, just a few inches away from Cas’ left side.
He’s gonna check that out later though.
Castiel felt his cheeks heating and tried not to wince when he mentioned a wife. Dean was sweet and he tried to convince himself it had nothing to do with the pair of deep, green eyes he was trying not to tumble into, but he kept losing his train of thought.
Castiel felt satisfied.
“Hey, I’ll text you, okay?”
He guesses it is meant for him to be alone. Without
"Grab the lube Dean..."
"I'll come back to you, my friend..."
Dean didn’t say anything—like he always did when he finished in Castiel—and walked towards the bathroom, flexing his muscles. After closing the door behind him Castiel closed his face with his palms letting out a shaky breath.
And Castiel hated the situation, he hated himself for falling for Dean and his stupid bad boy vibe. His stupid gorgeous eyes, and his stupid smile that made Castiel think about it all the time.
, I'm close babe..."
After Castiel cleaned the bloody pitches on his body that found him when those Barbarians' heads exploded, he ordered the servants to bring him his silk dark blue robe. Wearing it, the young and powerful king followed his way towards his chambers, where his new guest was staying.
Slipping off his leather jacket and unbuttoning the first 3 buttons of his tight dark red shirt, Dean walks towards the small stage with the mic and the small screen showing the lyrics.
If he wasn't so damn numb from anxiety he would
' and fell on his knees to grab them.
The loud ring, making him come to reality. Dean groaned silently, giving him one last peck before leaving him to get up.
"Yes!!! Gay love wins!" someone who Cas pretty sure thinks is Charlie screamed and after that applause and cheering erupted through the whole church.
Castiel smirked once again, winking at her proudly. Dean not only let go of Lindsay—or whatever her name was, but he also started walking towards them, green eyes darker than ever, fuck, he looked so good with his black Led-Zeppelin tank top which was showing his bulky biceps.
Castiel holds him tighter, Dean looks so small and so, so young, he never ever saw him this broken before, the green-eyed man always covered his deep pain into a cocky mask, always being flirty, cool and so damn calm.
"You're him?" Cas felt an odd connection between them, every word Dean said, he believed him,
Castiel saw fucking stars.
“Hey Cas, can I talk to you?” He blurts getting in between them.
His heart clenched. He loved Dean.
It isn't the end of the world, there's other guys too.
Don't show how heartbroken you are.
The green-eyed man was shocked, did Cas just checked him out? He is about to say something, but Charlie beat him up to it.
Not the Novak he wanted to fuck but whatever.
"You didn't text me that?" Castiel's voice was so small, the tears and the realization rolling down his whole body.
Dean felt Cas trying to cover him better with his trench coat, mumbling that everything’s gonna be okay, he didn’t even realize he was trembling like he was in Siberian temperature.
Sam nodded and slipped outside quickly.
Castiel furrowed his eyebrows in confusion, what exactly Dean meant? A few moments later they were already in the big bunker hall. A few members of his Alpha’s pack were there.
When Dean slipped the cloth and threw it somewhere, he didn’t even catch Castiel pushing him to sit on the bed.
Maybe he's still hesitant for now, but one night with Castiel and he'll forget his own name.
“You’re here…” Dean smiles as he breaks the silence and Castiel’s heart melts and clenches at the same time.
The knock sounds again, Dean sighs and walks towards the door, if he dies, he dies.
Some of the tension he felt dropped out, but he still couldn’t breathe easily and his heart felt heavy as hell.
He grabs his coat and wallet, fighting not to panic and scream as he doesn’t find his freaking car keys.
Castiel smiled tiredly but as happy as ever, he pulled Dean into his mouth and gave him a slow passionate kiss, running his fingers through the spiky hair, and caressing his face.
"Thank you, and uh, I-I'm actually a widower..."
Cas chuckled softly. "We are both idiots, aren't we?"
What if he never comes back? What if both Dean and Gabe are dead?
..." he admitted. Dean was scary but something in Castiel's gut told him he was safe.
“What? Charlie are you drun—”
Lord,
The pain flew as fast as it came. Dean then fell on all fours and glared at the man.
When his partner started thrusting in, Castiel opened his eyes and watched him as he was an amazing sight on top of him.
Castiel drops those heartbreaking thoughts on the back of his head and puts his blunt mask. As he gets out of the car, he takes a deep breath.
The knife slipped from his fingers, Castiel yelped as the sharp teeth with the ugly breath hissing on him came closer, ready to rip him apart.
There was no one around, just a few cars.
Dean huffed, blushing when Benny whistled playfully, laughing with Bobby and Ellen.
“I love you Alpha…” he whispers against their hot like fire kisses. Dean growls happily bringing his hand to cup the blue-eyed man’s cheek sweetly.
Castiel's heart was beating fast, like really fast. His hands started to sweat. Oh god, he was really doing this? He was practically no one. And Dean was everything.
He heard Dean hiss and then moan, his husband's large palms palming his cheeks spreading them, it didn't take long before Dean tongued his entrance, sucking and kissing the smooth pucker.
you baby…” Dean almost whispers, voice breaking.
He put Alfie down, searching the fridge for the leftover tuna he opened this morning. When he found it, he grabbed 3 eggs too for an omelet.
"Please stay..." Dean's eyes were open now and watched him hopeful and
"Okay, talk to you later Balth..." Cas hung up and almost choked as his heart quickened in 100 extra beats.
After the kids went to the playground with Hazel, he and Cas sat on the bench. Dean dug out the cold beers and offered one to Cas, who gratefully took it. "And for us, beer..."
he had texted.
It landed like a sack, crying a little but getting up quickly to hiss at him.
At least his best friend never left his side when Cas needed him the most.
Castiel felt tears threaten to roll over his eyes.
"D-Dean, p-please..." he whined as Dean's tongue licked his bottom lip.
“Yay, he’s not that dumb!” Charlie clapped sarcastically.
Cas just shrugged like he didn't want to talk about it, Dean noticed that he almost started avoiding looking at him.
"You saved me just in time, you
Dean couldn’t blame him, running back to your ex, as a wolf, and being chased by angry omegas who wanted revenge for their old alpha who Dean killed was not an everyday evening for him.
It was hard, being alone. He missed his brother and sister so much, it felt like an eternity not being with them, the apartment big and empty without Gabriel’s loud presence or Anna’s relaxing aura.  At least they call him almost every day, telling him their news. He still cannot believe they are in college.
Smiling into Dean's neck he mumbled a small blissful
Dean was taken back for a little before more anger flashed into his face.
"Yes." Dean smiled widely and pressed a kiss to Cas' cheek. The blue-eyed man let out a breath he didn't know he held. That was a relief.
The blue-eyed man couldn't believe his ears,  frowning and feeling himself getting angry too, Castiel steps closer to Dean.
The blue-eyed man, blushed a bit but felt so warm, Dean's lips were soft on his hand.
Titling his head his eyes watched how the Alpha even being injured with bloody fur, he held with his teeth the other wolf making it shriek from pain as it tried to escape.
“We have a plan…” Sam assured, he looked at Castiel with those puppy eyes Dean told him about.
“You know what—Uh forget it. Glad you’re okay mate!” Dean dismissed looking a bit panicked.
However, Dean appeared intent on taking his time. He dropped his slick hand between them and started stroking Castiel's cock, sending shivers of excitement down his spine.
Cas sighed. “I’m not…”
"Alright, let's see the wound..."
, you reek of beer..."
He tried not to sob and sound shaky. “Dean W-Winchester, which room he is?”
“So, here’s the deal puppies, one move towards our own, you’ll be dead in a second.” She said calmly but threateningly, casually swinging her silver blade.
It didn't take long before the older man himself came inside Castiel's tight heat. Groaning once again into Dean's mouth Castiel felt the hot thick come filling him up so good. It was their first time without a condom and he doesn't regret it at all.
He's a loner, and after he lost his family, it didn't make sense. Nothing made sense anymore.
her away.
Castiel wrapped his legs around Dean’s waist, trying to push the green-eyed man deeper—if that was even possible. Apparently, Castiel needed more.
"No more 'friends with benefits' shit..." he whispered in their sweet kisses.
Castiel copied his movement and turned around to exit, suddenly the air between them was tight and the tension too thick.
winking at Castiel he disappeared into the bathroom.
Dean complied and walked towards Castiel, the blue-eyed man pulled him into his chest and then turned him around--
Castiel's breath stuck in his throat.
"How?"
, maybe it's the wolf inside him.
“Cas, you sure you want to come with us?” Benny asked turning on his seat so he could see the blue-eyed man. His expression was filled with rage, Benny seemed to hate the plan, but he stayed calm for Dean’s sake.
"He is so undressing you with his eyes."
"No, it's alright..."
Seconds later he was once again between Deans spread legs and he was eyeing the tenting erection in his boxer briefs.
"What's up?" Dean answered, eyes following Ben.
…you’re alright.” Castiel kneeled down and took the courage to touch the big furry head, his fingers brushing the soft light hair.
Castiel felt a tear rolling down his cheek, wetting his cold-sweat palms. It was too overwhelming, and it fucking hurt.
Well, it wasn’t Dean’s fault. It was all his, for letting him go and never agreeing for an alternative solution for them to work.
“Starving!” he said, and Dean chuckled kissing his mouth.
Mary was shocked in the best way possible, her lips twitching into a smile, next to her John was frowning but didn't look angry or even pissed.
Dean had an arm around protectively like he was afraid Castiel will leave if he let go. They talked about everything and nothing, the accountant updating about his shitty job and the Alpha telling stories about his latest hunts with Sam.
"Who the hell are you? Where are my men?" he yelled pissed, the back of his head felt like someone drilled his brains. It got only stronger when the man's eyes lighted up stark white.
Dean tried to push that feeling away, he thought Cas was family, his brother, but he means more than that. No wonder he chose to be with Carmen, he needed to forget about his feelings that haunted him for so many years.
Did she seriously made him admit his deepest secret, and now left. Dean was so killing her.
"I love you s-so m-much baby..."
“We do.”
Minutes later Sam’s truck was right in front of them and he scented Bobby with him too.
"D-Dean..." Castiel's hands slid up to wrap around Dean's neck.
“You’re hurt, we need to get you to a hospital…” Castiel was about to touch Dean’s bloody rib, before he could though, the green-eyed man grabbed his arm.
"No, no, it's fine. It was long ago..."
Dean Winchester was finally making his move and started walking towards Cas and Balth, the blue-eyed man's heart started pacing and his best friend smirked knowingly.
They swam towards the opening and got inside the small rocky cave. It had sharp rocks all over it, but a big space and its roof was hiding the sunlight, making the space cool. The couple stepped on the chilly sand and looked around. This space was the perfect private location.
Dean heaved out a breath, the tiniest hint of a whimper caught in it.
“Cas! Castiel, help!” the accountant froze as he recognized his younger brothers’ voice.
Dean felt his heart clench a bit, he wished his angel was here so he could kiss him and guarantee him that he was bringing Gabriel home.
Cas was looking at them with a surprised frown, his face falling a bit, Dean swore he saw the blue-eyed man’s eyes flushing hurt.
It was a small ceremony, just the closest, Sam, Mary, Benny, Charlie, Bobby with Ellen and Jo and of course Castiel's brother Gabriel, his sister Anna and his two best friends Balthazar and Meg.
"I thought-uh...y-you said b-bed..." with every nip and bite on his neck, Cas choked a moan.
"Hey, it's okay, I'm gonna take care of you..." The blue-eyed man ran his fingers through the golden-grey fur.
Castiel stepped and pulled the tall teen into a hug.
"Cas, I know you and Dean are not talking, but please man I need your help, he came home piss drunk, his lip is split and his knuckles are bloody...He, uh...can't stop calling for you..." Sam was trying to talk steady but his voice was shaking a bit.
As Cas ran as fast as he could, jumping two steps at a time, the sound of the preacher's voice was coming closer and closer, his anxiety clouding more by the time he was met with the open Gates of the holy temple that was about to unite his best friend and that horrible woman.
, he told to his mind.
Castiel chuckled. "Of course you are."
"I don't love her, damn I'm not even sure I like her," Dean exclaims quietly as the preacher stares at them suspiciously. Dean wince's a smile.
When Dean pushed forward for the last time into that impossibly tight warmth, his whole body flushed with tingly heat; he followed Cas off the edge. He collapsed with a cry, flopping over Cas' chest as his hips pressed forward over and over and he pulsed come deep inside his angel. Cas wrapping both arms around him and panting out heavy breaths into his hair.
Castiel looked at Dean with wide eyes, he could feel Benny right behind him as he shot every dark-haired mutt that came close to him, it was easier than he expected, the adrenaline hitting full red.
Castiel sighed already tired. Preparing himself mentally.
." suddenly Dean lifted his hips up, spreading Cas' legs wider, his wolf's heavy cock resting on his, Then Dean got between his thighs giving him one last loving/hungry glance before lifting his legs even higher. His ass in full view of his hungry wolf.
"Whoah! That's cool, buddy!" Dean grabbed his bag which contained some of Ben's toys, some sandwiches, and packs of wipes. He quickly clutched some baby wipes and wiped a small spot of dirt on Ben's cheek.
feelings.
Before Dean could say something more, the elevator opens and a guy walks out of it, Cas' smile fades but the other man's grows bigger.
Castiel was furious, how Dean could leave without saying anything?
anymore.
Still rolling his hips slowly and for Dean's sake, painfully
xx Al
He turned his back, trying to hide his Cheshire grin as he successfully made Dean come to him.
A little excitement.
. Even ghosts had more personality than he.
His thoughts were interrupted when Ben came running towards him, the boy was holding a snail in one hand and the other the small toy replica of his own car 'Baby' which Sammy gifted him on his 3rd birthday.
Dean didn’t even realize Cas was leaning closer, the blue-eyed man’s hand was bringing his face closer to his. The Alpha did not think twice, he hungrily smashed their lips together in a second.
, Dean was concerned about him.
"Dean, it's okay, thank you for sharing, it means a lot to me...you and Ben deserve the best. You did a great choice, Ben adores you. You're an amazing father..." Castiel couldn't seem to tear his eyes away from Dean's.
After getting up, washing, and dressing up for work, Castiel changes Alfie’s sandbox and sips him some dry cat food. Alfie does not look impressed but eats it anyway.
Castiel stood awkwardly still starring at the handsome man, his eyes were the greenest he ever saw, it reminded him of green apples and meadows that just touched spring. He could see freckles that hugged his cheeks and
you, I knew things were a little odd between us, but I fucking
Then, the wolf looked at him. Castiel looked at him back dreadfully.
Castiel was so stunned Dean talked to him for more than a few seconds, he lost his words.
Castiel felt his mouth watering even more.
Castiel was dreaming
Especially now that Dean realized Castiel Novak, the blue-eyed dorky accountant with the prettiest eyes is his destinated mate, he knew long ago but never dared to tell Cas about it, he’ll probably freak out. He felt it immediately after coming to Cas’ life, the blue-eyed accountant’s scent confirmed it.
Castiel smiled softly, "You can call me Cas!"
Sighing, he sat on a chair and wiped his glassy eyes. Thank God he didn't let the tears fall and thank God no one gave him a second look.
Dean grabbed his hand and put it in his chest, holding it tight. He leaned closer, his pale handsome face hurt.
Castiel’s heart broke a bit, he knew how it was to be alone without parents, he felt sympathy for Jack.
Castiel chuckled wickedly.
Cas hugged Dean's body and ran his fingers on his back, nails slightly scratching the skin. He pressed his lips on Dean's neck and started to suck. Dean was a sobbing mess on top of him as Cas spread his legs wider so the other man could fit between them better, their still clothed cocks rubbing for friction.
Eyes never leaving Dean’s, he undoes 3 buttons of his white shirt, the silver thin chain with the small angel wing wrapped around his neck contrasting through his sweaty heated skin. He grabbed Meg who was next to him and swirled her around him, traveling his hands around her hips.
, his cock, and generally everything that has to do with him. Castiel hasn’t had sex or a date ever since Dean left. He didn’t think someone could ever be worthy as the Alpha was.
“Gabriel?” Sam said concerned, face suddenly pale. Castiel smiled a bit, Sam had a weakness for the short blonde brother. Gabriel still has a crush on Sam too.
Castiel's mind for a second was blank, then as a tsunami of emotions and pictures he knew he saw but couldn't remember, wrapped all over his mind.
“It’s Gryffindor, there’s no way we’re winning…” Castiel said bored when he noticed the red and gold rival players. As sad as it was Gryffindor had the best team out of all their houses.
And god, Alfie, poor baby probably wonders what the hell happened, he hopes his kitty is alright.
When they pull away from each other Cas gives him a toothy smile to hide the pain that circles his whole body. Everything he hoped, vanished away, every little desire he had and wished flew out of the window.
He hears Sam bursting into laughs beside him but he ignores it as he gets up from his stool.
Why the hell he is here? After what he did, After the way he ruined Castiel's heart, taking decisions by himself and not returning Castiel's pleas.
"Your hair is not that styled today, you always spend at least 15 minutes on your hair, right now they look like you just run your fingers in it. Which means you didn't get late on purpose but didn't sleep well last night.
"Fuck, baby, driving me
Whatever, he gulps another sip of his beer and glares at Cas and that asshat he's been talking with for almost 30 minutes. He's not fucking jealous obviously. Cas is his baby
Castiel heart winced in pain hearing the loud growl-scream the bigger creature gasped out.
Dean wraps his hand around Cas’ arm to pull him into his chest.
." Dean's eyes locked on Cas' face and he tensed all over. "I’m close."
Castiel closed his menu. "I would love to try your favorites."
Tonight still feels unreal.
s-so hot babe..."
Castiel tried to scream, even though, there was probably
definitely his blood.
Gulping the last drop of his strong drink, Dean exits the office closing the glass door behind him. Cas was already wearing his grey matching suit jacket and grabbing his leather Prada messenger bag, which Dean gifted him last year.
“Help!” he screamed once again hopelessly, voice cracking.
Sudden anger encircles his body. He can't believe how irresponsible is the green-eyed man, dread fills Castiel as he imagines Dean getting drunk and starting fights,
The redheaded wolf looked guilty, her eyes avoiding his.
Before he could take a breath, Dean was already pushing in, hissing Cas’ name. Castiel groaned and pushed his face in the mattress feeling the thick length inserting him.
"Sometimes he is, sometimes he's not..." his best friend returned the flirty grin, smiling softly with a dose of sexiness, which made Dean weak on the knees.
“Come in…”
The wolfs turned to him, eyes glowing like fire, teeth sharp stained with blood.
Castiel's heart melted, Dean seemed like an amazing parent.
abruptly everything in him surrendered. He wanted to touch Castiel as much as Castiel touched him with his teasing slow brushes.
The green-eyed man rocked gently into him for a moment, riding it out, then stilled and pulled out and slipped off the condom throwing it on the floor.
“I thought Char was messing with me, but it’s true…” he let out a shaky relieved breath, his hands were traveling all over Dean’s neck and shoulders.
"Oh, Dean..." Cas gave him another kiss, then winced, "
no doctors, please Cas, trust me, I’ll explain everything …Just help me call Sam, he’ll come to get us…”
No harm,
The last thing he remembers is his heart,
Dean is smiling at him, his big smile is making Cas' heartbreak even more, when his best friend's smile starts to fall, Cas quickly winces a sorry excuse of a smile to assure Dean he is happy for him.
Dean fixes her with a confused glance, his brows furrow when Lisa gives him a knowing smile.
They looked exactly like the first black one, but their fur was wilder, dirtier. Are they mutant humans? Maybe they’re wolf shifters. Castiel once read a Supernatural journal about these things.
Dean chose that moment to pull back and press harder, and Cas sobbed out a groan, his whole body shaking to the feeling of Dean stretching him wider.
Dean's palms feel huge as they caress his stubbly cheek so tenderly, a moan slips out of Castiel's mouth as Dean starts sucking his bottom lip like a pro, like he doesn't have a split lip himself.
They made slow passionate love, holding and kissing each other like the world was ending. Cas finally admitting to Dean that he was in love with him ever since they started working for Bobby, how he chose Dean every time.  Dean was on cloud 9, so many years lost, he knows that nothing will change in work except their real feeling for each other.
“Cas!” Dean shouted, his eyes suddenly wide open. He relaxed immediately when he saw blue eyes staring him with concern.
Well, not for long, if Cas was quick enough, he could talk to the jock before his other friends came and ruin his chance.
"I know it's pretty soon, but I like you...Can we do dinner? Dean's heart plummeted into his shoes.
“I just hope Gabe is alright, I can’t lose him too.” His eyes watered but he didn’t let the tears fall, “I mean, I don’t even know why the hell he’s back in Kansas? He’s supposed to be in California…”
For a moment it feels like Castiel touched heavenly fire, every part of him reacts in the best way possible. He tastes Dean’s whiskey tongue as he parts his mouth to let him in and groans when the older man’s big hand squeezes his ass.
“It’s not like you haven’t seen it before…” Dean murmured, searching for some boxers, Cas just snorted embarrassed.
"Dean, what's wrong?" his best friend asked, concern already lacing his deep voice.
He chokes.
Castiel turns in zero seconds, this voice… this husky velvety voice. His eyes meet with those green, he hardly could get out his mind.
The human shout made Castiel froze.
“I think you’re beautiful too.” When Castiel blurted that, he felt the cringe crawling all over his face,
The green-eyed man smiled one of those gorgeous soft smiles and squished his hand, his palm was warm and nice on his own.
Cas..." Dean groaned before slipping his hand beneath the small of Cas's back.
"Cas...Is it r-really
He still couldn't believe Charlie's boss, CEO of 'Winchester Enterprises' was at her Engagement party, and what the hell?
Dean's face twisted with pleasure, and Cas forced his own eyes to stay open, fixed on his wolf, before they both knew it Cas came, hot and thick on his chest. The seed flowing between them in what felt like slow motion.
“I can’t
Castiel shuts his eyes,
At first, Dean started at a slow pace, so Cas could adjust, grabbing his knees and thrusting deep and slow, Cas moaned, rolling his eyes into his brain, his ass felt full with Dean's cock. The green-eyed man kissed his calf as his speed quickened.
His heart now clenched painfully, guests were already gathering and the ceremony was about to start, Cas was nowhere to be found.
“What the
It didn't take long before he sat on his desk and Cas came in quickstep, Dean didn't lift his eyes to meet Cas'.
Dean's face fell, "I'm sorry I didn't m-mean to uh, s-sorry man..."
He looks at Dean confused and angry, lips parted, begging him to shove his tongue inside. God, he needs to kiss Cas now, he needs to take him and show him who he belongs to.
, the white roses looked out of a freaking romance novel garden. He still, couldn't believe how Balthazar arranged all this.
"This is for a special one..." he blurted trying to stay still,
There was something about him that drove him crazy, If someone else would have done this to him, Dean would have cut their hands off. In this case, he was powerless and weak opposing the young emperor.
Dean looked down at his uncovered dick. Ah, yeah,
feel this
She pulled him into a bear hug, almost lifting him from the ground, she was always stronger than him and she was so little.
“Everything makes sense now—well, the most of it,” he admitted accepting Charlie’s kind gesture, the accountant from being lonely and miserable, suddenly is around people who care about him, he finally found Dean again, and the Alpha promised to not leave him again.
Dean rolled his eyes as Cas crossed his arms on his chest, trying to search for Dean's secrets. Yet he knows everything about him. Even better than the green-eyed lawyer knows himself.
Which reminded Castiel...
Dean then finally looked at him, with a lazy smirk and dark eyes, he tried to lean into Castiel, his arms already ready to wrap him up, but the king just pushed them away smirking.
It was a hobbit, yet he couldn't help but enjoy the cold breeze hitting his face, Cas tried to tire himself to forget the nightmares, however, as much as he tried the misery was still permanent in a piece of his heart.
When Dean hit his spot Cas choked and let his hands chase Dean's body, grabbing the other man and pulling him in him even more, Cas hugged Dean nuzzling into his beard. "Please more,
The young emperor was tanned like everyone here, but he almost looked bronzed and pale at the same time. His blue eyes were the bluest shade he ever witnessed, decorated with black eyeliner. The young royal was gorgeous with his lean bare and toned chest, Dean gulped when he noticed he only wore a gold belt that poured a long fine transparent linen. As was anticipated he wore shiny hinged cuff bracelets in each arm.
And that hurt even more, not that Dean would be someones else's but how unhappy he'll be with someone that doesn't even know him or respects him or even loves him as much as he does.
Castiel's face fell when he saw Dean's ripped lip. Suddenly everything was too much.
Dean’s wolf felt threatened and extremely angry when he saw at least 15 mutants in front of him. The only thing that was relieving him was that he finally could sense Gabe’s heart.
Of course, he does,
Before anything could happen, Dean lifted Cas on his strong arms, Cas automatically wrapping his hands and legs around Dean, mouths never leaving each other, still hungrily licking on each other's lips.
, I could fuck you forever…
anymore.
A part of him always believed in something bigger. Dean will never hurt him, the blue-eyed man trusted him, he never stopped loving Castiel. Things might be crazy right now; he might be in danger, but at the moment he needs to feel the man he so much loved, needs to touch him, show him what he means to him.
The rough stubble in Dean’s cheeks feels amazing and man they way he sucks Castiel’s bottom lip is beyond this world.
…” Castiel moaned biting his lip.
“Wait here,” he said as he got up still trembling, ears ringing and eyes blurry.
He hoped for the better.
After a couple of seconds Dean stopped and let out a frustrated breath.
"It is actually, we just moved from Worcester, I transferred here for work..." he said playing with his fingers, Dean nodded.
, he thought.
That moment Castiel got courage and power, he was doing it goddamnit.
His eyes fell on the Alpha, who was weakly receiving sharp bites, its eyes looked defeated as it tried to rip apart the smaller one’s throat.
Cas yelped as he got up, grabbing his waist, whimpering a little as his back hurt like hell.
After they make up sex, hard sweaty and so, so loving, the two men stayed curled into each other, Castiel traveling his fingers on Dean’s warm skin, feeling the Alphas toned muscles.
Or the room is spinning by itself.
Dean smiled from Cas’ aura, his blue-eyed angel was feeling intense emotion, he felt love radiate from him, the Alpha couldn’t hide his wide grin.
He hoped Sam will catch his scent to lead the hunters to the hell hole he’s about to go, there’s probably a twenty more of these bastards there, he won’t make it alive. They obviously want him to trade himself with Gabe.
"Do you feel it too?"
“You think I ain’t going with 270 miles per hour already, boy?” Bobby hissed, “We’ll be lucky if we don’t get a fucking ticket too!”
Balthazar was talking but Cas was too focused on those dark green eyes and the way those muscles flexed when Mr. Winchester took a sip of his champagne, and oh fuck, those bow legs.
"Please, Cas..." Dean moaned begging and then swallowing hard.
Cas squeezed his hand securely.
Or maybe
Castiel almost blurted ‘fuck me’ when Dean fell on top of him, arms wrapping around his waist and legs spreading wide so the green-eyed man could fit between them. He almost growled when Dean started grinding their hard erections together in a slow rhythm.
The green-eyed man was shocked in the best possible way, Dean looked at him with that surprised puzzled cute frown he so much loved but Cas could see his lips twitching for a smile, after pulling away his hands from his fiance, Dean took a few steps forward.
Music was blasting and neon lights were shining here and there. Everyone was dressed in a Halloween costume and a lot of folks were already drunk.
forget about Cas.
Castiel yelped falling back on his ass, as the Alpha pushed him at least 3 meters away to attack the other animals.
Castiel sighs. Dean is
“Don’t you dare say that, I feel exactly like you!”
Starting his car Cas was about to break every law to get there in time before it was too late.
The animal suddenly tensed, Castiel stumbled down, scared if he did something wrong. A loud growling cry came from the animal as its bones started to break inside of his body.
"You know why you're here?"
Dean slipped one last time two fingers into Cas' needy hole and stretched them wide. Then he drew his fingers back, met Cas' eyes, and pushed his cock in instead. One long, slow slide and he was fully seated. Pleasure exploded in the blue-eyed man's gut. He was panting already, hips jerking as he fucked himself on his wolf's cock.
. He could lose Cas with his real answer, but he's tired of hiding it for 6 years.
“Don’t worry, it was planned. This way we know what direction Dean took…” Benny looked at him saying soothingly.
Castiel sighed and glanced at Dean again, he nodded with a grin, and his heart almost melted, he kneeled once again to the children's height and gave the leash to Claire, Hazel stood up too and wiggled her tail as she shoved her muzzle into Claire's lap.
Taking the courage he turned to glance at Noah, "He's mine..." Dean growls possessively and then shifts to Cas' side, the blue-eyed man is stunned when Dean grabs him by the waist pulling him against his chest.
Dean stilled on top of him, and Castiel thought he kind of ruined the mood. But then the bigger man’s eyes were his werewolf red, looking at him with so much possession and arousal.
Castiel smiled shyly, "Thank you, Dean, you really didn't have to..."
Castiel flipped the pork patty on the other side so it can grill and melt the frozenness of the package. Lifting his head, he's met with Anna's dark eyes.
And Cas?
The green-eyed Barbar shut his eyes. From a powerful dangerous leader to a slave. This was gonna be his life now? With boiling blood, he bore the most dangerous and angry glare at Castiel.
His last hook-up was 6 months ago, and yes the girl was nice and hot but when she heard Dean had a son she blocked his number and didn't return his calls.
Castiel broke into a wide grin, heart pounding, skin flushing. "Dean I--"
Dean was the captain of their school's football team. He was a jock,
Before he took the place at one of New York's greatest firms, he ended his partnership with Crowly who was the Manhattan District Attorney whom Dean worked under as Assistant District Attorney before working at Singer Turner. That man had questionable ethics and was willing to engage in unlawful or illegal acts in order to have the accused incarcerated.
"I'm a single dad as well, Ben's mom left us when he was only 12 weeks..." The first words came muffled from his palms but Castiel didn't miss the hurt in his voice. He felt even more sympathy but he didn't want to feel sorry for Dean, Cas hated when people did that for him.
He frowns shocked. Another wolf, larger than the previous was watching him, its red glowing eyes so deep as it was glaring with growling teeth at the smaller black one.
Dean was already ready to run to Gabe and grab him the hell away, especially when he heard the first bullet and the quick steps of the humans running towards the middle of nowhere.
So why it hurt so much being apart from him?
“What happened? The last thing I remember was driving to your flat…I-I needed to talk to you…”
“You’re
"Nothing much, just reviewing a case for Monday's trial, boring stuff...how's Ben?"
In the big bronze-gold throne was sitting what Dean guessed the emperor and the pharaoh of Thebes.
Cas didn't have to say anything more. Dean slid his fingers in his angel's hand, intertwining them with his, and finally pressed forward, sliding into Cas' welcoming heat.
The king walked towards the green-eyed man and sat on his lap, then he half stood and shifted forward, taking Dean's cock in hand and sinking down until the head slipped inside his somehow slick and loose hole, which he prepared before coming here.
He was tired as hell after all. Michael was once again a pain in the ass, thank God, his parents left him a good amount of patrimony after their death.
"Okay, thanks Cas..." Sam let out a shaky breath, Castiel's heart clenching in pain as he heard Dean's cries of
"I would love to..." the dark-haired man breathed, with eyes wide and bright. He reached up to touch Dean's hand. Dean relaxed immediately and took a relieved breath as he ran his thumb over Cas' soft warm knuckles. Both of them smiling at each other like idiots.
“Don’t be afraid, you’ll see more familiar faces that you can think of…” Dean gave him a small smile, assuring him that everything will be alright.
The black wolf was obviously afraid of the larger who seemed to be the Alpha, stronger
"What are you doing here? Where's
He can’t ruin their friendship, their 3 years of being brothers, through all high school and now college, he’s also sure Cas isn’t into him, he did date Meg until 2 months ago.
“Dean? Again,
"Hello Dean, Ben..." Cas greeted ruffling Ben's spiky hair, his kid giggled and Dean's heart swelled with affection, the man was amazing with kids.
. That stubborn green-eyed wolf was willing to sacrifice himself.
"I'm clean babe..." said Dean when he grabbed the lube.
“For me?”
Dean’s mouth goes instantly onto Cas’ neck.
Turning to face the green-eyed man, Castiel noticed he was already asleep, his breathing slow. That was his cue to leave. With his body feeling heavy as hell, Cas got up. Just a few seconds passed before a warm large hand wrapped around his wrist.
And if Dean doesn't want to do anything with him after, he'll be broken but at least he will finally let out his feelings. Better lose Dean with him knowing the truth and his real feelings than lose him after destroying his life with a woman he didn't love.
to Dean.
"Sorry for interrupting..." he smiled shyly.
"See you around."
Dean reaches up to graze his finger over Castiel's nipple, the bud hardens under his touch.
He exhaled a heavy sigh of relief. He didn’t expect that it would affect it so much. But then Castiel remembered… The cutlery was silver.
After a few minutes, he started driving to the usual road, his laptop bag sitting on the passenger’s seat.
1 month since he hadn’t stepped in the bar Dean worked, 1 month since he ignored and blocked Dean’s calls, 1 month since he stopped hanging out with his squad with fear of seeing
." Dean groaned out and Castiel knew he was close.
The Barbarian was in his own world,
He looked gorgeous, clean-shaven with messy hair and eyes sparkling from a mile. He was holding a single red rose and smiled shyly as he walked through the aisle, his mom, Balthazar, and Charlie were already tearing up and Dean felt himself emotional too.
Castiel grinned softly, "Sounds amazing..."
Destiel always will be ENDGAME and of course CANON 💙💚
“God…” Dean already pushed a second finger and started scissoring him, what the heck, his fingers were so thick. Castiel was seeing white.
,  his stubbly jaw could do things to Castiel.
Before Castiel could feel the death, another loud growl comes from behind. He shuts his eyes harder—
he gasped out, voice rough with sudden lust.
A warm fondness and safety wrapped around his chest. Suddenly being away from Dean felt like death, Cas always thought he will be alone, but Dean found him, and he never will let Cas
He needed to keep his thoughts on Michael’s sex, his face, his body.
Castiel was a whimpering mess, crying Dean’s name like a prayer.
“Ah, Cas..
And like that, they spend the evening, dancing and talking about everything and nothing. Dean not only was smart, but he was also funny as hell, Cas couldn't stop laughing and grinning.
Charlie smiled knowingly, her dark eyes sparkling as she took Castiel’s hand, “You guys okay?”
Exiting the elevator, Dean wears his poker face and walks towards his office, his confident steps fade when he takes a glance at Cas who is on the phone giggling like a teenage girl in his cubicle, which is attached just a few feet away from his own office.
“But what about that time you almost spilled your beer on Lisa’s dress?” Dean laughed, Castiel felt the strong chest vibrating below his cheek.
After they left laughing and chasing the dog to the greenery of the park, Castiel smiled awkwardly at Dean.
Castiel shuffled on Dean's lap and relaxed even more, his eyes falling on the script Dean held in front of them. They were sitting on a large folding beach chair, Castiel's back was pressed on Dean's bare warm chest, his hands resting on his husband's spread thighs which he was inside. The beautiful view of Mykonos island in front of them, everything blue and foreign in the best way possible.
His brother was shivering, he understood why he was clinging to Sam, wolfs were so warm, Sam blushed when he met Castiel’s eyes.
Castiel stilled.
Dean Winchester wants to
"Hello, Novak."
This kiss, even though it was messy, was the most gorgeous sensation they both experienced with each other, they both could feel the love radiating from them. Castiel felt like heaven.
"The warmth...the sensation that this is
Dean released his cock from the underwear and gave it a slow stroke, making Castiel let out a heavy breath.
sucked Cas' nipple into his mouth, flicked his tongue against it before pulling away. Cas gasped for the millionth time.
He needs the blue-eyed angel for him and only him. But he’s a fuck up case. He doesn’t know how to be a boyfriend; he isn’t fucking romantic.
"No! No! Stop!" Carmen yelled like a psycho, Cas almost forgot about her. She started to run towards them in a threatening way.
"It was nice meeting you Cas," Dean's eyes flicked over Castiel's face.
xx Al #staysafe
The green-eyed man kept stroking him as he was pressing his warm plumb lips in every corner of Castiel’s face. Left eye, right eye, nose, cheek, chin, jawline, anywhere but his lips.
It hurts not to have them, but it's been 2 years now, since the accident. Balthazar was right for him to get away from the big city in a while. In the beginning, it was painful to come here, usually spending Christmas and New Year's in his small flat.
Right in front of him was the Vampire he dreamed of all the time for almost two months.
Dean looked around, he was in his room at the bunker, body sweaty, his wounds almost healed up in the bandage around his rib.
"I love you too,
Castiel sighed as he sat next to Charlie who was screaming for their Hufflepuff quidditch team. The other students were too noisy and screamed so loud Castiel was about to lose his hearing. For
“A Bludger hit him,” he hears Charlie hissing.
Flashbacks of him coming here for his and Dean's weekly fuck sessions. How the green-eyed lad would grab him from his collar and kiss him hard, they didn't even make it to bed sometimes.
Castiel then lifted his glance at the green-eyed man who was still stunned, then he looked at the boy, the two of them looked so much alike.
"Cas."
Castiel turned to him and smiled, "No, I'm quite nice."
He felt tears threaten to roll down his eyes. And okay Castiel was very sensitive, and he cried quite easily, always having his hopes crushed.
“He loves reading, he’s such a great kid, super kind. He adores Dean and Sam; Dean takes him for fishing almost every Saturday.”
And just like that, Sam explained what they are about to do, how they’ll trust the hunters to help them, and how both Dean and Gabe will make it.
Cas nuzzled into Dean's shoulder and he couldn't help but feel heady, his scent,
The accountant winked at him, making the younger wolf blush harder.
As Castiel made his way to his small Smart, he felt a movement behind him. Turning around, the dark-haired man almost screamed.
“God, you’re an asshole.” Cas shakes his head biting down on his bottom lip to refrain from anger, and damn it, Cas is really trying to hold it in, Dean can just see it.
“We can’t leave him alone!” Benny growled.
By the end, Castiel's stomach was pleasantly full, his cheeks were sore from laughing, and every inch in his body longed to feel Dean's fingers on him again.
"Dean are you okay? You look like you'll pass out..." Sam frowned as he whispered worriedly.
Then Castiel remembers, these creatures feed with
“What?” he whispers like he does not believe it.
Britney Spears’ “If U Seek Amy” was blasting from the speakers and Castiel was a sucker for Britney and seducing a taken hot guy.
Castiel took a deep breath, his heart was about to rip off his chest, the earlier situation with his brother in danger didn’t help at all.
As if the universe read his mind, the phone started vibrating into a call.
Just sing.
Castiel choked, burring his snout into the Alpha’s neck crook.
Every time he hung out with Dean, cause he did (Lord bless Fridays), and enjoyed it so much, even though they had very little time with each other before Lorna? came, he was always smiling, and his heart was racing, ready to get out of his chest. Do not even let him start how his dick reacted when the music was too loud at the parties and Dean had to lean closer to talk to him in his ear, hot breath hitting his heated skin.
Dean smiled and pressed a kiss to the side of Cas' neck. " I dig Led Zeppelin and beer, I also have a younger brother which can be a little bitch, but I love him," The blue-eyed man chuckled at that, "and I feel like the happiest man for meeting you..."
, yes..."Castiel rocked back on Dean's fingers and felt a bead of pre-come form on the head of his cock.
"Tell me something about yourself."
“I was so angry at you…I can’t believe you left without saying anything…” Castiel murmured against his wolf’s warm neck, running his fingers through his soft fur.
Dean smiles brightly and Castiel goddamn it smiles back, ignoring the pain in his chest.
"Make any funny move and I'll melt your brain without you even noticing it..." the king whispered seductively the threat, hot breath hitting his ear.
Dean pressed his fingertip to Cas' hole and gasped as his body welcomed him in, warm and soft.
Dean smiled even wider.
Dean licked into his mouth, sucking his bottom lip, groaning softly, God, how he loved those gorgeous pink lips his wolf had. Castiel is a lucky guy.
, Dean, don't
Dean complied easily and pressed his hot mouth on his.
I know you'll find it hard to believe me if I tell you how much you mean to me. I hardly understand what I feel for you, and don't know how these long, sleepless nights, thinking only of you can go one. I've never felt like this before...
handsome as hell tonight, with his messy hair and his loose unbuttoned shirt.
Anna grinned and leaned in. Her lips were fruity and not something special, she kissed okay, not the best he’s ever gotten but she smelled nice.
Dean’s senses are deeper as a wolf, his emotions wide and stronger, it takes a lot of control to not jump and rip those fuckers apart.
"Headed out?" Castiel asked.
Everything was perfect and his palms were sweaty as hell, what if Cas backed down..?
"I'm not some sex slave for your enjoyment! I am Dean of Winchester Alpha lea-"
When Cas was finally in front of him, Dean took his hands and kissed his knuckles making him blush but winning an adored look from his blue-eyed angel. Holding tight each other's hands, they faced Missouri and she smiled kindly at them before beginning the ceremony.
Sipping some beer, Dean was checking his boy who still hadn't left his toy car, clutching it as he chased Jack and the blonde girl. Taking his phone out, he snapped a picture, sending it to Sammy, he wrote
"We gather here to unite these two people in marriage..."
The blue-eyed gasped between their kisses, the sensation was making him even harder than he was before they started their make-out.
, the Road House owner, his eyes widened when he realized she was also a wolf.
Shouting, Castiel threw his arm which was gripping the fork right on top of the wolf's eye, he twisted it with everything he got, pushing the metal deep into the creature.
Dean could pass out. Something in his gut told him that he's making a big mistake. He doesn't love her. He doesn't want to be around her all the time.
It was alone, and hurt,
you, and I
Dean licked Cas' bottom lip like a hungry wolf, "What about," another lick, "...Chris..."
The thing was that Dean, fed so little of him like he didn't like Castiel's blood cause everything was too quick. The one minute Dean was between his legs, nuzzling his neck and sinking his sharp fangs on his flesh, and the other he was alone, fully healed, but a little dizzy. The vampire nowhere near. Not even in his throne where he sat always and watched the hustle and bustle of the nightclub.
Castiel's eyes wide, " Three t-times in a fucking row?! Why didn't you call earlier? Damn it Sam!"
Stop it, Winchester.
, still can't believe you love me back..." Cas whispered the last part almost disbelievingly, "you sure you're not drunk enough to confuse me with someone else?"
.." the words come before he can stop them, Castiel sighs dreadfully when Dean sniffs and lifts his head up, suddenly the sigh of green bloodshot eyes was too much. The older man's expression is surprised and so gorgeous, even with a split lip he looked
Only one man was dominating his mind and thoughts.
"Yeah, don't worry Sam, I got this. Call me if you need anything okay?"  Castiel grabbed Sam's coat from the hanger and pushed it to him as well with his car keys.
"What bothers you baby?"
"Come on, let's celebrate!" Dean pulled him into him, arm wrapping around his shoulder.
Sam let out a loud sigh, "Sorry, Cas...Hope I'm not interrupting anything..."
After taking his keys, and his cellphone, the dark-haired man got out of the house.
After almost two in the morning, Castiel exhaled, took off his apron, and wiped his sweaty forehead with the back of his palm.
Everything was blurry for Castiel, his back hurt like a devil. He didn’t even want to be here, why he is the one getting a hit.
“Joanna!” Ellen called sternly.
Castiel moaned loudly wrapping his arms around Dean and mouthing his broad shoulder, Dean's naked skin smelled incredible and he felt drunk. Then they kissed, eager and heated for a long time before Castiel pulled back. He pushed Dean on the bed and dropped to his knees.
Dean rolled his hips again and gave him a slow kiss. "You feel amazing," he whispered, and Castiel shuddered, trying to urge Dean into a quicker pace.
"Tell me something about you."
* * *
Castiel smirked like a cat.
Cas avoided him. “So, this is your house?”
Castiel glanced at the familiar big man in front of them,
," Castiel gasped. He rolled his hips forward as his cock started taking interest rubbing up against the firm, unyielding line of Dean's thigh.
Dean pulled him once again into his chest and Cas melted as he inhaled Dean's heady aftershave. Wrapping his arms around the slightly bigger man Cas buried his face into Dean's neck whispering a broken
Dean was right. He’s a fuck up.
There was a flirty and playful tone in Dean's voice. He was enjoying spending time with Dean so he agreed instantly and curled a small shy smile.
Dean relaxed his features and grabbed Castiel.
Dean dipped down to press his lips to Castiel's ear. "Wanna go for a swim?"
Dean instantly lifted his head up, tears were around his gorgeous green eyes, Castiel almost turned away, he couldn't look at Dean, especially like this, Dean never cried, even in his father's funeral he didn't let out a single tear.
Dean smiled—
"Can't wait, angel."
Dean’s heart starts beating very fast, the world around him blurs out for a moment, the music of the party distancing slowly. He sets his eyes once again across the room, where Cas and that British son of a bitch.
..." Dean said so quietly it almost sounded like a whisper, "Apparently I tried to convince myself how fucked up I am, and how I don't deserve the most amazing human being ever."
“Wait!”
Cas winced, Dean felt his aura a bit scared, so he tried to calm down, relaxing his energy.
“Dean—wait…” Cas pushes him a little breaking the kiss off abruptly, to take a deep breath of air.
Dean got up quickly and walked towards the light switch, Castiel was met with tired red-rimmed green eyes, and his heart almost dropped once again. Dean had dark circles under his eyes and a thick beard as he got close to Cas melting to the chair next to the bed and pushing his head into Castiel's lap.
"I don't regret anything, I just-I-I can't believe his own mother wouldn't want him... I was in love with her, I could make it work, marry her... But you know what? It was for the best. It is easier that way. It is easier to hate her, not only for abandoning her child but not giving me a choice." he mumbled down at their hands. Then he looked at Cas.
Dean shuffled forward until he was in Castiel's arms again and lined up the head of his cock. Dean's hands settled on his open palms, lacing their fingers together. Dean then started to push inside slowly, and
Heated eyes raked over him.
Castiel bend to where they were sitting and gave them both a hug, giving Charlie a kiss on the head as she closed her eyes and leaned to Benny’s embrace.
Leaving a last small peck on Cas' lips, Dean pulled away a little, but not much. Their foreheads touching as they panted on each other's lips.
Dean grinned end cupped his cheeks, pulling him close, "Did they really cost that much?"
“I-I’m sorry…” Castiel suppresses a sob in his throat swiping at his face to rub the wetness away.
He is in love with Cas.
Seconds later Dean was in front of him, eyes wide and searching for
“Dean, no—stop, for fuck’s sak—” Cas’ voice is angry as he pushes Dean harder, his hands going on top of his chest.
Today Cas was wearing a light blue button-up which made him sexy as hell, his grey suit pants making his ass looking like a fucking desert.
Then he never saw him again, leaving him a rainy night crying to sleep wondering what he did wrong.
that was amazing. Dean's thickness was stretching him wide, every nerve set alight. Dean's hands clenched on his and his eyes went dark, his breath losing rhythm. Castiel loved that moment, he closed his eyes and nodded at Dean as he wrapped his legs around the green-eyed man's waist.
Dean's voice went very soft. "Well, you shouldn't, whoever did it, is a sick sonovabitch..."
, I can’t believe how close they were to you…” Dean choked, bringing Cas’ knuckles to his lips.
He slipped inside as quietly as he could, Cas' nerves were on red as he felt his heart beating so damn loud, it seemed like everyone could hear it. After letting out a relieved sigh noticing that no one paid attention to him, his eyes fell on Dean, and Carmen who were turned towards the altar.
“I only dated Meg to forget about my feelings for you…” Castiel admitted blushing when Dean’s hands roamed the expense of his waist.
Groaning and spitting the water, Dean blinked once or twice before facing a tall dark-haired man. From his tanned skin, intense eye look, and of course his rich leather tunic he realized he was an Egyptian soldier.
Benny huffed and Castiel saw the poisonous mutt grinning as it laid down on the grown. Benny got him. Castiel frowned and guilt flashed in him. He once again set the gun and shot the almost dead mutt, it would not do anything cause it was already dead, but he thought he at least owned this to Benny.
His mother was obsessed with silverware.
"Shit..." Cas bit his lips.
His best friends Meg and Balth always trying to take him with them to their families' holiday tables or suggest spending the holidays together but he always declines politely, not wanting the pitiful looks from people.
Cas blushed in an adorable red shade.
Castiel almost growled like Dean when he grabbed Dean’s dick, which was thick and heavy. He started to jerk him off, lips still on each other, breathing heavily.
(See the end of the chapter for
The things he’ll do for Dean and his little brother…
Dean gave him a small smile, "Of course I do, why do you think I came out as bi? When I saw you I couldn't take my eyes off you, you're beautiful Cas... The reason I didn't make a move was because I thought you liked Balth...An angry Charlie came to me not long ago to ask what I said to you for you to run...then she said you like me." the green-eyed teen admitted.
"W-what?"
Dean's face softened as he brought his lips on Castiel's fingers.
Cas melts into his body, letting Dean pin him deeper into the wall, trying to hold a moan when Dean’s tongue slips inside of his mouth.
"Of course I can.
"Get out my way! He's my husband."
, his calm facade didn't let it show.
Once again,
"I'm in love with you...Have been since Sam brought you to our group and I-I want you to be my boyfriend and p-please don't date him," Dean couldn't stop his words and then he pointed to Noah who looked stunned and confused.
Panting softly, he gave the wolf a small brush on the head and walked with a quick step to the driver's seat.
He feels warmth radiating from Cas when he sees Sam.
“C-Cas…” Castiel hears a mumbled sound as he opens slightly his eyes. The room is darker than before as he lifts his head from the mattress, the moonlight outside brightens the interior and his vision adjusts in the room.
Castiel grabbed some tissues on his nightstand and wiped his come off his stomach and chest, then his softening cock, after throwing it in the trash he wore his boxers.
"You too, babe..."
, knows what he had been through.
Claire blushed and squicked a:
They kiss hungrily, both hard as they rock at each other, Cas’ hands slipping around Dean’s neck, his long fingers pulling his short cut hairs.
, his men were alive but not for long.
, he did it again.
"Nice try, Barbar." the blue-eyed man said smirking.
"Listen Cas-"
--tailored suit with a silk black dress shirt which was opened two buttons and stretched amazingly at his broad chest.
Benny stared him deeply, mouth in a tight line, his best friend probably was calling him every negative name in the whole universe, but there was nothing he could do to stop him. Benny hated them, but if they could help in this…maybe they’ll put aside their differences.
“Tonight, I was coming to find you, to take you back…” Dean said sheepishly, uncertainty lacing his voice.
Pulling his blanket over him and curling into his pillow that smelled like Dean, ‘Cas’ let out his tears. Sobbing softly, he choked one word.
Cas though didn’t give much attention, his mind was elsewhere,
in Rome too, him being the Alpha Leader of Franks is just a bonus.
. Obviously Dean had a girlfriend, who's also a cheerleader. Lisa and he always had something even though they didn't date.
"H-Holy
They sat there comfortable, talking about this and that, and Castiel actually enjoyed talking to the green-eyed man, Dean was funny and sweet and he worked at an auto shop, which is why his hands were rough and his shoulders broad. He tried not to imagine Dean naked with only his dirty overalls and his sweaty body fixing a car.
Sucking a shaky breath, Cas felt a sob close in his throat. He needed to leave and never turn back, Dean couldn't even look at him anymore. That hurt the most, his favorite person wouldn't be able to look at him anymore without knowing his true feelings.
Cas was seeing stars, Dean wants to kiss him!
It was so hard not to fall in love with him.
Getting into Dean's space, the blue-eyed man touched his chest, making Dean stiffen in place. Running his long slim fingers on Dean's bulky frame, he then traveled his fingers down and even lower.
‘If you come with us, we’ll guide you to the boy…” one of them said through his mind.
Castiel Novak, was handsome, with broad shoulders and thick thighs, his blue eyes and dark hair made him look like an angel.
Dean ran his hands in every inch of his bare skin until they settled on his ass, squishing his cheeks, the swim trucks were quite loose on the thighs so his husband slid inside of them and took a handful of them. Castiel groaned hotly on Dean's lips.
“I-I need you—mmm…” he mumbles between kisses.
Oh, thank God, he was fine.
"Please..."
Dean opened his eyes, it was dark and cold. The back of his head was killing him like hell. Groaning like a wild animal, he tried to prick up as he couldn't help but freeze his damn back from the cold marble.
Cas' knees weakened but he got the courage to speak up.
xx AL
He's at a lesbian couple engagement party of his other best friend, obviously, some of the guests are gay.
Is this why Dean was so animalistic that night he left?
"What the hell?" he whispered sensing terror for the first time in his life. Looking at this man was making him feel paralyzed, he couldn't move any muscle on his body. He's pretty sure his wide eyes couldn't even blink. Trying to scream, the white light flushed even more energetic.
After a successful trial (like always) and shit tone of boring-ass meetings, Dean finally was exiting his office, after obviously having a drink of his favorite scotch. Cas was working late too, and he was ready to leave, maybe Dean would give him a ride.
Dean shrieked as he tried to sit and Castiel’s heart fell.
Castiel is dizzy and ecstatic when Dean pulls him to his firm chest, rocking his body on his as he groans enjoying the music and Castiel’s sweet scent.
is Cas flirting with that British asshole, he himself said that he was annoying and far too bigheaded.
Gazing at each other and flirting a bit, Castiel didn't realize when the waitress/Jo had walked up to their table, they both tipped back, Jo smirked as she asked what they'll have.
he hiccups, choking on his sob. Bringing his hands up to his face closing it with his palms.
That means—
beast.
Dean sighs and shifts in his bed, Castiel’s heart stops watching Dean wincing from the pain.
That is too odd, Tomas should be inside. Castiel shoves the bad feeling on the back of his mind and shakes his head, this is ridiculous, the man probably went to grab something to eat.
“You can’t be serious? We don’t have to do anything with your boyfriend’s brother!” Jo said harshly and Castiel winced painfully.
"Fuck, angel, me too,
‘Dean go get Gabriel’ Sam yelled inside his head, Dean shook his snout, giving a last glance to Cas who now had his eyes on him.
he thought tiredly
Castiel felt so satisfied.
Don’t you
Carmen smiled, her red lipstick popping when she said the next words:
Letting out a loud sigh, Castiel once again felt that empty feeling coming back to his whole body making him shiver.
“She lied to me…”
..." Castiel once again felt a tear roll down his face, he ignored it wincing a smile.
“Mom went against him, she was tired following a hierarchy bastard…He killed her, the day I left your apartment…he killed her, ripped her throat apart—”
But Castiel couldn’t think straight, his brother was in danger, his Wolf boyfriend went to sacrifice himself without even thinking about anyone else and yeah, he’ll probably spill his guts out from the anxiety.
Dean swiftly felt offended.
"My turn to lift you up babe..."
Next. To. Him.
Shutting his eyes hard, he was ready to feel his throat being ripped apart. If you told him this was the way he would die, Castiel would have laughed
The older lad brushed ghostly his arms around her, placing them hesitantly on her hips. Eyes never leaving Castiel’s.
After a long moment of silence, Cas probably noticed his hard gaze. Putting his soft hand on top of Dean’s, the blue-eyed man moved closer lacing their fingers together.
After Jody assured him they will take care of all this, he nodded and said goodbye. In the car, Sam was on the backseat with his brother wrapped around each other. Ha, he knew it something happened back then, little shit played dumb when Castiel asked him about Sam.
When Cas' eyes met with Sam's he almost passed out, he was about to get out in careful quiet steps when he noticed Sam's happy expression, he winked at Cas encouraging him with his small head gestures.
“Why don’t we take this…somewhere else?” Lisa purred, kissing his neck.
Dean felt the urge to
--p-please,
They both groaned, Castiel’s hole clenching around Dean’s cock,
Dean: 33
fuck ,
When he pulled his dick out of his hole, Castiel winced and turned around so he was laying on his back. A moment later Dean did the same.
“Are you hungry?”
he begged shakily.
But that doesn’t mean Castiel stopped being in love. He loved Dean so much—
The TV was playing something he's too bored to notice, his cat Jack is lying on the small rug under him snoring softly.
"Y-You too..." he gasped pulling away from Dean so he could take his pants already. Cas needed to see his cock.
Dean was in love.
Guess the canned turkey would do.
"You're insane..." Castiel growled.
"Ben, please be careful buddy..." Dean sighed when he saw his son playing with rocks. This kid could literally play with anything--
The two men glanced at each other.
Images of the man Castiel loved (loves) more than anything haunted his mind, his beautiful smile and those breathtaking green eyes he adored sparkling every time they looked at him.
"Then Amelia...
Cas looked at Dean kind of desperately.
Cas kissed him again deeply and so, so much filthier, licking Dean's mouth like it was the best dessert. It didn't take long before he palmed Dean's cock, stroking the thick length.
"You want my fingers baby?" he asked breathlessly as he pushed one hand in Castiel's cock and stroked his rough palm on his balls brushing slowly his sac.
"S' okay baby..." he chuckled softly as he traced his tongue on Castiel's parted waiting lips.
his consciousness told him.
And as cliché, as it sounded, he didn’t want
Dean cupped his face and then Castiel saw the next memory, the one which had his heart dropping. Dean's eyes were dark and so intense, pain radiated from him.
Suddenly the doorbell ringed and he rolled his eyes throwing his head to fall into the back of the couch.
"Lisa, means nothing to me..." he then continued, staring so deeply at Cas.
Look a mini disgusting turtle!" his boy jumped excitedly showing the snail. Dean winced a bit disgusted but smiled softly and ruffled Ben's spiky hair, almost identical to his own but darker like his mom's.
, the way he looked at him when Dean talked about every little thing. The only one who cared about his opinion and the first person he came out as Bi.
a second? Cas tried to ignore how intoxicating Dean's scent was and how pink his lips were.
and an
He was in the pharaoh's palace in Thebes.
He heard Sam chuckling as well, "That's nice to hear."
Dean tries to tear his eyes away; he doesn’t
"Like that?"
Dean.
His heartbeat started speeding as he tightened his grip on Dean’s.
He turned around and met the Alpha’s green orbs looking at him concernedly, his big palm placing on his bicep.
He felt Dean’s lips touch his ear.
Castiel smiled wider, waving at Jack back,
Is Dean still considering him as a family?
When he came back with his truck, Cas found the hurt animal breathing softly but hardly, the poor predator wanted to live, it was trying to stay alive. Cas' chest filled with hope as he kneeled down the laying wolf.
His stomach dropped as he closed his eyes shut.
"Hello?" Castiel answered.
He focused on their voices with his strong hearing.
Dean gets cut when Castiel pulls him into him and wraps his arms around the bigger man's waist, before anyone could say anything the blue-eyed man presses softly his lips to Dean's avoiding the bloody cut.
Castiel trailed his lips from Dean's neck to his jaw and finally hit home on his lips. Dean parted his lips and Castiel didn't waste time before thrusting his tongue into his mouth, both groaning after Dean started rubbing his warm wet length even more rapidly on Castiel's hole than before.
except the angry growl and then a cry of fear.
"Mmm, bed...
He nods, eyes now fixed on Cas. he can't help but catch distinctly, the way Castiel's jaw tightens, and his eyes harden.
“Hey, sweetheart...don't cry...You were pretty badass, back there.” Dean ignored his weak plea.
Dean growled, "shut your piehole."
"Dean is starting to annoy me,
He damn well knew what he did to the blue-eyed man. The only thing he didn't know was how it fucking hurt having him only for pleasure.
Dean is the best human alive.
That's why he glamoured him to forget about their relationship?
Cas still had to explain everything to his friends back home,
“Hey, buddy…” Dean stepped closer, voice velvety hoarse. He smiled but his eyes were flushing concern and a bit of shyness.
While the blue-eyed man lied all sweaty with cum all over him and an aching back, he felt an odd deja-vu, but it quickly disappeared when Dean got out of the bathroom, with a huge smile and a wet cloth. The green-eyed man kissed his forehead sweetly and Castiel closed his eyes happily.
. He always thought he’ll die old,
Pushing his bulky biceps to hit the man in front of him, he suddenly freezes and feels his eyes roll up his brain. Screaming and grabbing his pounding head, Dean fell to his knees and started screaming like a wounded lion.
When he made his way towards the big stoned cell, with a flick of his thumb, the torches inside the cold dark area lighted up. Twenty men were chained, all striped from their weapons. It was a nice view, all those big men with muscles.
"W-What?" he breathed.
Dean shot one more questioning look at Castiel, who gave him a little nod, "Uh, we'll have number 23, try to put as much bacon as you can," he winked and Jo almost rolled her eyes. They were close probably, Castiel could feel a playfulness between them.
He was so killing him later.
"So...about the date?" Dean murmurs against Cas' lips, making him giggle like a 14-year-old girl.
"The wedding is off. I'm sorry Carmen..." Dean got in front of Cas protectively and the blue-eyed man wrapped his arm around Dean's.
Dean's eyes widened, he tried to suck back a wave of anger. "No, no, no, you can't do this to me!"
Anyway, is not like Castiel is the unfaithful one.
"Hey, Cas!" Dean greeted warmly smiling, green eyes sparkling.
this, especially after the horrible episode of Castiel's hospitalization. The incident was privately closed as the couple didn't want to get in public and have the press and channels bugging them with even more drama that was caused.
blushing.
Dean looked at him with big green eyes, and he was so gorgeous with his faded freckles and those pink plumb lips.
"Yes, baby so,
Castiel smiled and Dean bitted his lip before leaning in and kissing him again in a slow filthy kiss.
The bell ringed and Castiel fixed quickly himself, he just needed to grab his English book from his locker.
contract.
The empty feeling in his heart.
"Cassy? Cat got your tongue?" Balth poked him, the bastard grinned like a cat.
When he woke up hearing his annoying phone alarm, Castiel groaned tiredly, he needed more sleep, 5 hours were not enough.
It was too elegant for his taste.
"Please, be careful
After Charlie fixed her long red locks she smiled in the mirror and grabbed her keys. Dean whistled, she looked good like Poison Ivy.
His cock was already wet with precum, there's no other man that could make him wet so fast like that, Dean was so, so hot and sexy and basically sex on legs. Castiel could come just by scenting him.
He was touched, how starved he was from human touch,
, his eyes rolled into his brain.
Benny stayed a bit behind with him.
The thing is, he was happy with Dean, and then a rainy night Dean just snapped at him angrily, growling at Castiel to go away and not touch him. He looked almost like an animal, Castiel didn’t recognize his Dean who was soft and heart-meltingly adorable.
"He's fine, I think he made a new friend..." Dean grinned when he glanced at Ben showing the blonde girl his car very proudly,
Cas feels tears form in his eyes, as his heart clenches painfully in a way he never felt before. The wedding was in action at this moment. Dean probably wondered where is his
Dean shut his eyes, regret, and humiliation making his knees weak, even though he couldn't feel them.
. Castiel,
Southing the wild animal, until he lulled to sleep, Cas, checked the wound again. It had started bleeding again, and the blue-eyed man had to press towels over it. He didn't feel safe or comfortable doing stitches, so he decided to spray the wound liberally with an antibacterial and analgesic spray.
“Balls!” he heard Bobby exclaim as the truck speeded up, they were already out of town.
The accountant met the big green-eyed wolf, and relaxed immediately, heart fluttering and a weight leaving his shoulders.
After tough decisions, the pack decides Dean should go alone to get Gabriel, with one condition...If things get messy, they'll have to call an enemy to help them.
With a determined step, Dean runs out the bunker, when he feels the cold wind in his face, the Alpha’s energy boosts across his whole body.
He stepped inside, breath caught in his lungs as he glanced at Dean’s lying body on the hospital bed, heart monitor beeping steadily. Castiel feels a silent sob rushing into him.
Cas' mind was blurry, he only focused on Dean and his gorgeous face.
Running to his car, Castiel locked himself inside, panic rising as his shaky hands moved to find something that could help him.
Dean grinned, his eyes soft as he looked at his beautiful friend, he was in love with him too!
Giving a last glance to his family, Dean smiles. Cas is alright here, they gonna take care of him, his eyes travel to the library but he sees no one, Cas and Charlie were sitting just a few minutes earlier.
"It's okay boy," Cas grunted breathlessly as he finally noticed the wolf's genitalia sex.
The animals all growled, the bigger wolf shielding him possessively, getting in position to attack.
Checking the clock on his nightstand, it said five minutes before seven, and the dark-haired man panicked a bit, Dean will be here in five minutes.
Fuck, Cas..." the blue-eyed man stroked his cock. Dean couldn't help the whimper that leaked out. Cas' stroking was so,
Castiel once again turned his attention to the car, everything was havoc of animal cries and curses, most hunters were alright, and the mutants were lying on the cold ground dead, Sam was already in his human form, only wearing a pair of jeans as he carried Gabriel who was clinging on the taller man, eyes wide as he saw the scene in front of him.
Castiel sighed but nodded with assurance. They still had to talk for a lot of things, his brother was still missing, and he didn’t even know if he’ll ever return back to his apartment, Alfie’s probably misses him.
, his age the last 46 years. He had long hair and green eyes, he was big with hard muscles and looked quite familiar.
. Real and synthetic.
His consciousness screams at him.
on the most important day of his life. How disappointed he'll feel about Cas.
Castiel moved once again into his space, bronze body glimmering at the dark lightning, Dean only now realized they were alone. There was no one, not even one guard, not even one servant. Castiel's throne room was empty.
Dean lost focus on the other talk as he turned his side to Bobby who looked at him in the rear-view mirror. He frowned defeated.
In Castiel’s mind,
Michael was extra bitch today making him work late than usual because he was so freaking irresponsible as a boss and apparently knowing a little about his job than he should.
Until now,
Dean was still, eyes careful and glossy, "Don't be afraid, I'm not gonna hurt you..."
‘Where’s the boy?’ Dean asked silently, communicating with his mind.
“What—” he was shut by lips brushing against his. Dean’s heart dropped in the best possible when he realized Cas was kissing him, his arms around his neck.
Maybe it wasn't so bad. No one saw him, he didn't ask Dean anything. He could definitely pass it out.
"Nice to meet you, you work with Castiel?"
"Dean,
He said he wouldn't.
A few minutes later, Castiel heard the doorbell. Letting out a sigh he grabbed to wear his leather jacket this time and not his usual black trench coat.
His mouth watered and they both moaned when Castiel reached for the hard cock and rubbed the wet spot.
“Listen here, you
“Dean, what the hell are you doing?” Cas says trying to release his arm from his grip. Dean’s grip only tightens as they cross the living room to go upstairs.
“Okay, okay, let's go find it!” The redhead nerd grabbed his arm and pulled him out of the library, Castiel yelped from her strength but ran with her.
"I'm tired of you trying to still my fiancé..."
Their breathing was heavy, especially Dean’s when he opened the shirt, revealing the toned chest the accountant had. Castiel groaned when he felt fingers tracing his stomach.
"Yes, sir."
Dean glanced at the dirty-almost destroyed Toyota where he could see Gabe tighten up and gagged. His gold eyes wide and heart beating like crazy, poor kid, probably didn’t know where it all came all of sudden.
At least he still got it.
Dean wants Cas more than anything—
Castiel, shook his head, "Please come here and hold me..." the blue-eyed man whispered hoarsely opening his arms.
Seconds later Dean was all over him kissing and softly biting his skin. Small wet kisses from those sinful plump lips.  It felt like fire, but the good kind that did not burn you, but embraced you with passion and lust.
Groaning, Dean softly wiped the wet stained tears from Castiel's cheeks and started peppering kisses all over the blue-eyed man's face.
Dean squished, kissing his neck.
As Cas continued to decorate Dean's neck and shoulder with bruises, the green-eyed man ripped his belt off and then pushed his slacks and boxers in a smooth pull. It interrupted Cas' kiss task but it felt amazing.
You see, when your ex-girlfriend comes back into your life pregnant and demanding you take responsibility for your actions you don’t have a lot of ways to get the hell away from the situation.
Dean noticed some college girls looking at them giggling and biting their lips, he could have sworn he heard
“Dean stay with me…” Cas whispered but even with his senses down he could feel the blue-eyed man’s voice panicked.
"Mmm..." he hummed as Dean started licking his hand from his own cum. Castiel cried in pleasure,
working. They can’t figure out anything, Dean needs to go alone, fuck the trap, an innocent life was in danger,
The Pharaoh smirked, but it was a wicked smirk. Dean gulped.
Dean turns around, tears brimming in his eyes. What the fuck? He never cried before…not even when his old man died.
“Ya fucking idjit!” He exclaims as Dean gives him a tired winced grin.
Castiel hummed, "Yeah, but don't worry, he's fine."
The blue-eyed man frowned in confusion, he followed the noise stepping carefully not to scare the possible animal that might attack him.
Sliding into the warm water, he copies Dean's position and rests his arms around the rim across him, relaxing at the streaming water. Dean looks so lustfully sinful which in Castiel's case is exactly ideal. The trace of him being a dangerous Barbar was now left.
Why Dean was
“Stop playing with my feelings!” his voice comes so darkly and pained, Dean’s eyes widen in confusion.
"Later."
watching Cas with bright eyes.
As Dean leaves hot kisses here and there, Castiel tilts his head for better access, pushing the green-eyed man’s face in the crook of his neck.
Dean stays quiet.
Cas started walking towards the handsome jock who checked his phone frowning.
The boy was adorable and looked so much like his dad, Castiel raised his eyes and met once again those green ones.
Cas thanked the gods or probably the long hours he ran and worked out for the strength he was given to lift the hurt animal which painfully breathed and cried, its mouth falling open in a stressy pant.
One of the worst feelings though was that Dean didn’t even tell him goodbye—
The dark-haired man shook his head, "It was 3 years ago, I'm okay...
Pressing his lips against Cas' felt like heaven, drowning him in a heated, passionate kiss. His arms caged him in on both sides, drawing their bodies close.
He shouted eternally at his stupid mind and consciousness.
In Benny’s arms is curled a small redhead sniffing—Charlie. Next to them is Bobby, Dean’s uncle. When they notice him, Castiel feels a nervous shiver but manages to give them a weak smile.
date.
Sam drops his backpack and rushes to his older brother, the 17-year-old lad wraps him into a bear embrace. He knew Dean was suffering from not seeing Cas, it was too obvious now.
The green-eyed man smirked and winked at his best friend. It's probably the 6 bottles of beer he had acting, cause in clear mind he would suffer silently and get the fuck out of here before punching that bastard who flirted HIS Cas, although now he feels peachy, super flowy, and considering expressing to Cas how hard he makes him, how he also makes his heart swell and fly a thousand miles away, and
“Hi!” she leaned closer, “sexy costume…”
“But I’ll understand if y—”
More members came, including Sam with an Asian kid and a blond one. They both were at least 18-19-year-olds, Castiel never saw either of them before.
Cas sighed smiling, "I'm an accountant, and not to brag but I slay in economics and numbers, I'm one of the best." He said proudly and a little playfully. His heart melting when Dean laughed sweetly at him.
"Well yeah, I got them for you..." Castiel hummed, sliding his hands on Dean's ass, which was beefy and perky. Dean groaned with a grin and started to back towards the sea, the beach was peaceful today,
and got out of the cabin for a little morning run.
Cas felt his knees shake, his face pale like paper, everything was a blur.
, Gabriel was still Gabriel.
He didn’t even complete his sorry excuse of an explanation before the blue-eyed man threw himself at Dean.
Before he could say something they both hear the drunk man.
Castiel’s heart was beating in a supernatural beat, his body trembling intensely as he dares to open his eyes.
“Wow, you got
Castiel tried to keep his eyes open, the white light of the hallway on the way to the dressing rooms was loud and paramedics were checking him up, he was laying in something soft. Before he knew it, he was shaking, he felt so cold and hot at the same time, Balthazar was holding his hand and he could almost hear his panicked English accent shouting something to the others.
"Dean, need you..."
"Follow me..." he whispered as he pulled away from Dean, slowly letting go of his cock. Dean choked a moan and turned around so he could face the young king. Before Castiel could get up and slip off the bathtub, Dean grabbed his waist and pulled him back, now into his chest.
…” Cas mumbled in Sam’s chest and Dean holds himself not to laugh, Bobby’s glare changes his mind.
His boy loved the park, maybe they'll see Kelly and her son Jack, he and Ben were good buds, and Kelly seemed a nice woman. Better than Naomi and her snob twins Michael and Lucifer--
Claire was with Gabriel and he didn't have to worry about leaving her alone (she was so happy to stay with Gabe, she adored him), Hazel was asleep in his bed, and he still hadn't his pants on.
“Yes,” Castiel said in a heartbeat, this all may new and quick, but it’s his fight too, He just found Dean,
"Wanna go for a second round?"
After they said their goodbyes, they went into a nice suite room, which Dean probably got them for the night, and Cas almost gasped when the green-eyed man pinned him on the wall just a few seconds before attacking him with his lips.
He let it run on the road, so his pack knew in which direction he went.
He didn't need this heartbreaking information, it was too much.  He couldn't perform under this pain. Did Dean do that on purpose? Who sends a text like that before someone's big night? Castiel felt numb thinking about his husband.
"Hazel, bad girl!"
you were..." Dean whispered against his lips.
“Cas, first of all, it’s dangerous as hell, and Dean said he’ll kill me if I let you get out of this bunker.”
Gulping the last sip of his beer, Dean got up from the bench and threw the tin in the garbage bin next to him. Before though he could turn around and check his son and relax on the bench, an intense movement made him lose his balance for an instant.
* * *
The blue-eyed man with the thick stubble smiled at him.
But he was scared, it was so long after his last relationship.
“Damn, baby…” Castiel breaths heavily as he hears Dean’s husk voice and cannot help it but sink down to his knees right in front of Dean.
The rush of adrenaline was too strong to care about the danger. Castiel was about to kick the car door (Thank God he had casualty insurance) as the one wolf was scratching its nails to rip it apart, he tried to kick it with all of his strength and he did it, throwing the wolf at least meter away.
They continued updating each other with news until Sam had to hang and finish his report. His baby bro a fire lawyer was once again on a business trip in New York, working on a case. If he didn't work, he'll be here with them, Ben loved the shit out of Sammy and his younger brother adored his nephew as they spend a lot of time together, especially when Dean worked shift after shift at the auto shop.
Fuck.
Castiel didn’t need to say anything else, Dean got up, holding Castiel. He turned them around and gently threw the younger man on the bed, coming on top of him.
He wanted to feel nothing but Dean's dick. He bit his lip and looked up at Dean, who ran a soothing hand over his chest. "
" There's no hesitation in Dean's answer, never been any.
“We own Charlie, aren’t we?”
Then Sam nods slowly with understanding in his hazel eyes understanding the Alpha, he gives him an assuring smile that says
Then a mournful, pained cry echoed through the trees and Cas jumped to the side, eyes wide in alert.
. He already could imagine John Winchester calling the security on him. He always didn't like Cas, ever since he and Dean were in high school.
Warm breath hit his ear, and
And don't let me start about Ms. Barnes, she called at least 23 times and you never called her back, which means..."
Dean gulped, heart dropping once again.
fucking close, his red cock seconds away from blowing a huge load untouched. It was an overwhelming, head-spinning, inside-out kind of pleasure that robbed his breath and his vision.
He had so many questions but he just said: "No, he's my
Castiel felt really shitty right now, not only he put himself in danger but Dean was hurt and worried for him because of
Dean's face was unreadable, a small tear rolled down his cheek but he quickly wiped it with his thump and sank his head down looking at the ground.
Castiel’s eyes opened immediately, Michael stopped thrusting and had pulled off, an angry and confused expression masked on his face.
"If there is anyone in attendance who has cause to believe that this couple should not be joined in marriage..."
"I'm incredibly sorry!" he heard a deep panicked voice behind him.
“Hey…” he said softly.
That's why he needed so badly to help the wolf, an inner part of himself already connected to the wild animal, who actually was this man.
"Why do you think I stayed? I could have left when you pulled the bullet, Cas...when I felt your touch, my wolf knew you were the one, he felt your kindness, your pure soul, and how...
Their friends always made fun of them for still not being a couple, but then Dean always cleared his throat awkwardly saying 'Cas and I are just friends’ and then winking at him, meaning their other deal.
Checking the house with one last glance, he waves at the cat and then disappears to go to that hell hole he calls job.
Dean grinned again, he knew Cas was shy and very low but when he felt comfortable enough he was practically a horn dog.
He growled like an animal once again trying to release himself. The last thing he remembers was the white light that blinded him and his men. They were plundering a small village in Alexandria, trying to find something to eat as they were running away from some Romans who followed them from Cicely. Dean was active to fight those sons of bitches but Samuel, his little brother, and right hand warmed him to leave and hide for a while. Apparently, those Romans were more numerous.
When Ben's small hands were clean, he lifted the five-year-old boy on his lap and took the lunch box out of the bag. Handing him a grilled cheese sandwich with mayo and pork, they both dug in hungrily, humming identically.
..." Castiel turned to Dean and chuckled.
Dean smirks, " Actually, Castiel is working for me..."
Castiel was about to panic but then he felt a snout lifting his hand from behind.
It smelled like Cas.
"Not yet, love..."
Without turning back he revs up and drives as fast as he can.
Before Cas could get up, the lifeless body moved.
Guess it is the universe’s middle finger for not loving a
, that Noah guy was quite weird.
He almost tripped, heart starting beating really fast, not from fear...but from agony. Cas kneeled slowly, wide eyes traveling all over the animal's heavy form.
Pleasure filled Castiel's senses and he started riding Dean's cock faster, the blue-eyed man wrapped his legs around him, as Dean fucked into him harder, pulling out until the head of his cock caught onto the rim, and pushing in, repeating that over and over again and again.
Searching around, Cas' heart clenched as he did not find his hurt wolf.
If he sees Dean? Just gonna ask him about chemistry, he's gonna play it cool.
Getting inside, he glances around trying not to zone out, he's definitely not here.
"Who are you?"
“Look who’s talking…”
Castiel started sucking greedily, cheeks hollowing as he heard Dean crying in pleasure. He swallowed Dean’s thick length so deep and he is so thankful for not having a gag reflex.
"You are pissed or sad about something and don't want to think about it." The blue-eyed man completed, still searching for Dean's eyes, which he avoided like it burned.
Cas felt his eyes water, he loved animals. His heart broke for the poor beast. The poor
When Castiel was coming down the stairs, he was already whipping his head around, looking for Dean. Then he noticed him. Dean was leaning back against his black muscle car, dressed in a black henley, an olive green flannel which hugged his broad shoulders amazingly, and some black jeans. His sandy hair swooped up and framed up attractively, his stubble was perfectly trimmed.
Shrieking loudly with pain the beast scrunched away, falling, right next to Castiel.
The hall was incredibly quiet, everybody stared in Awe, Cas could swear he heard some sniffs and small sobs. It felt unreal that he finally let out everything he been holding for almost 15 years.
It takes only a second for Dean to melt into Castiel's arms and bring his palms on each side of his face, cupping gently as their tongues start to slide together.
"I want to..."
"Done for the night?" Dean smirked, his wolfish and confident persona returning back after a bad and tiresome day. Cas smiled back, "Well, my boss is quite a pain in the ass, making me work late..."
He slid his mouth down over Dean's cock and he heard him hissing, smiling with a mouth full of cock, he started giving slow and long sucks, hollowing his cheeks and lapping at the fat head. Then licking the underside of his cock, he felt Dean's hips stutter.
The green-eyed man didn’t need to hear it twice, he lowered his other hand unzipping Castiel’s pants, Castiel was so hard he noticed Dean grin looking at his crotch.
“H-Hi…” he croaked, voice breaking and tongue feeling incredibly swollen.
“No, we don— I mean yeah!” Gabriel yelped when Charlie obviously stepped on his foot. Castiel sighed internally, oh Merlin,
Dean sighed for what felt like the millionth time today and closed his face with his palms. He'll need a lot of coffee.
“I’m not that little…” he mumbled smiling.
When Castiel finds them, he literally ran out of the apartment not caring about the unlocked door or the elevator. His heart is beating fast and he can feel every beat louder and louder in his whole body.
"Take'em off..."
Dean’s probably gonna find a girl, marry her and have a beautiful family in the future.
So fucking adorable.
Dean tasted amazing.
"I'll be alright..." Cas said automatically, he still didn't understand much, he knew though, that his heart belonged to Dean, and anyone could say whatever they want, but the dark-haired man recognizes what he feels. There's still a lot to know about his mate, but from what his heart is sensing, Dean seems the perfect one.
After he called Annael to collect Dean towards his chambers, Castiel went towards the secret underground catacombs where the prisoner's cell was.
Cas was startled, "How is that possible?"
“I’ll be alright, you know how to find me…” Dean said as he slipped into his forest green leather jacket. He was strong enough, his strength was charged, the Alpha energy was strong enough as it ran all over his veins.
.” He blurts hissing. Dean’s heart stops. He said that and didn’t even think bout it.
"Mmm..."
“I know its not the time, but you look beautiful…” The Alpha said when they got out of his room, his hand immediately grabbing Castiel’s, lacing their fingers as Dean guided him to the main hall.
"Cas..." Dean gulped, his face burning. Cas once again read him like an open book.
Castiel wrapped his arms tighter around Dean's neck, drowning himself in the older man's heady musky and warm skin, he couldn't help but lick a stripe at Dean's freckled shoulder as Dean once again started pressing wet burning kisses into his throat and jaw, his fingers working him open.
"...I told myself, I might as well take the risk because it's the only remedy I know of that could let loose this feeling I've been keeping inside me all this time." Cas stopped for a second, gulping hard, his throat dry and croaked.
Cas shook his head and took a few steps back, moves careful, and mind steady on guard. The man may be the hottest man he ever saw but he could be a psycho.
"What the hell are you doing here? Where's Sam?!" Dean's expression turned into an angry scoff as he tore his eyes from Castiel and searched around.
The sun was hot and bright, and the air smelled like saltwater and fresh fish. Castiel tipped his chin up to the sky and breathed in sea air. Behind him, Dean hummed quietly as he read a draft of the latest major picture he'll be starring in.
! Dean deserves so much better, He is not that kind of man to marry the wrong person. Cas is his best friend and he will be honest with Dean,
“You’ll do the same if it was
The wolf gave him a grunt before letting his head fall on the woolen rag.
That's odd, he hadn't spoken to Sam in a while.
No wonder everyone drooled when he was passing down the hall.
—so she wrapped an arm around his shoulder.
"The things I'm going to do with you..." Castiel whispered seductively, his warm palms palming his stomach, running his fingers all over his almost pale tattoed skin. Dean wanted to escape, to kill this bastard, but,
He probably needs to find something new though.  He is an economics and accounting major for fuck's sake
Ha, guess he found the lube on the nightstand.
“Me too,
, however, I wanted to have a souvenir from the Franks Tribe, and the leader of it,
Mine.
Turning the kettle, Cas waited for it to boil so he could have a cup of his favorite 'Earl Grey' tea. It was quiet, only the sound of the boiler whistling could be heard around the silent late evening.
What if the mutants did something—fuck! His heart is about to rip off his chest, first Gabriel then his cat… the only positive thing in this mess, is that he finally found Dean.
Look at him, looking so smug and smiling like an idiot, with those plush pink lips that Dean would love having them around his--
“Don’t you
Dean's tongue replaced his fingers and Cas cursed and almost screamed, seeking that wet heat until Dean smacked his ass again to warn him to still. Two fingers slipped back in while Dean licked and sucked and dragged things out painfully slowly.
, not knowing me won't get you almost dead like last time...Guess I'm not able to stay away from
A needy moan escapes his lips when he hears Dean growl, his rock-hard bulge brushing with Castiel’s.
, Castiel finally gave in and started bouncing on the cock hard and deep, making both of them groan and gasp in pleasure, especially him,
Dean gulped, Cas' voice was deep with emotion like he couldn't wait but still wanted it to be slow and long. He was not only going to make love to him, Dean will also make him feel loved, as nobody else did ever, cause no one will ever love Cas as he does.
Dean's lips were parted from the surprise, his expression so deep and unreadable, those green eyes, glossy and full with emotion, the blue-eyed man thought he'll collapse.
Castiel groaned internally
"Heya Cas," Dean calls smiling. Ben spots them too after seconds and lets go of Dean's hand running towards them.
He asked himself.
t-together..." Dean growled whispering softly, it was like he was restraining himself. The thing was...He was
Castiel grips his teeth, trying with all of his power to push the animal away from him.
“Cas will you go—”
For Ben, it was so much easier as he adored Cas from the beginning. He called him
Cas kissed his hair, "That's why I love you, you dork...
it's not like everyone didn't know it already.
Dean was frustrated, they still hadn’t figure out what to do, time was passing, and he was getting a bit nervous, Cas would be a wreck if something happened with Gabe.
this was the best day ever.
Bobby glared at him again as he put him in the backseat.
” Castiel shouts panicky and Dean grabs the phone from his tight grip. His eyes red and sparkly, as he places the phone on his ear.
"I love you..."
"But that's not why I stopped the wedding, Dean...you can't marry her, I know you...I really do. And I don't think she deserves you, Dean Winchester, you are so much more than people make you out to be...So
Dean answered him by pulling him towards his chest and pressing his lips on his own. His husband tasted like sea and a bit of coffee, he dove into Dean's lips, even more, loving the sensation.
Castiel gasped, eyes slipping shut while Dean groaned again, nuzzling into his neck. A few seconds passed as he adjusted the length before he started rolling his lips slowly.
Cas pecked him twice, trice before pulling away a bit, Dean chased him with his mouth not ready to lose the blue-eyed man’s sweet alcohol taste. Dean was head over heels for him.
Boreal was quite gorgeous this time of the year, especially in the snowy flora he's small cozy cabin was located. His father and two siblings Anna and Gabriel loved it here during the Christmas period and a bit later when the snow was thick and calm.
“The pack I have here is like family to me, every single one of them trusts me and will die for me…But out there, those sons of bitches are still lurking,
"How?!" Cas' voice gets louder and more emotional.
He felt tears rolling down his cheeks as his eyes fell on Dean’s face.
were safe, yet he didn't know if he could trust this man. Maybe he killed them, maybe he'll kill him too, the blue-eyed man had something mischievous in him.
But now, Dean is here.
“You guys look amazing, the most wanted in Gotham!” she exclaimed happily as she wrapped an arm around Dot who is freaking Cat woman.
Cas’ eyes wide opened, surprise flashed all over his face.
Castiel grinned as Dean stroke his cheek gently and so, so lovingly. He never saw this side of Dean before, him, being so soft and caring.
"I have something in mind..." Castiel said giving Dean a toothy smile, bliss wrapping all over his body.
Castiel feels himself relax a bit, his palm super sweaty from holding the gun, full of silver bullets. Oh God, they are near the end.
, he, Cas, Ben, and Claire would be now a complete family, not that they weren't before, but now it would be legal. It still felt like yesterday when they met at the park, their first date, their first time,
Castiel scoffed, of course Dean would say that, he knows he’s not the best fighter or a supernatural being, but he can’t just sit here.
“Listen here, everyone. Cas is my boyfriend! He’s family for me as much you all are, and I’m not leaving family in danger.
Castiel’s heart dropped, blood icing.
...that we
His heart's beats fastened as an image of green eyes appeared in his mind.
Castiel groaned as Michael thrust into him hard, his wrists trapped against the older man’s hands. The blue-eyed man closed his eyes, that’s when his mind started drifting elsewhere.
"Well, that was disappointing." He almost forgot Balth was next to him. He glanced at him and rolled his eyes.
That question, takes him a bit aback, shutting his eyes for a second, Dean avoids for the millionth time Cas' intense gaze.
"No, Cas,
“Sam’s right, I’m going alone, and you won’t stop me,” Dean said determined, he felt his eyes radiating with red Alpha energy, showing to the others his dominant position, that no one could stop him.
“Cas get in the car…” He cried in pain, his left rib killing him from the poisoned bite.
I need you…” he mumbled between kisses, tightening his grip around Dean’s neck, pulling him closer—if that was even possible—and moaning breathlessly as the thick fingers left his cock and went lower and lower.
Castiel's face morphed into pure bliss, as he came on Dean, stripes of white painting his chest and stomach. Still gasping from the pleasure he licked into Dean's welcoming mouth.
"I'm a wolf-shifter, a lycanthrope, I was traveling to search for my mat--
Cas nodded, still having a confusing frown. After a few seconds of silence, Dean took it as a clue to continue. Cas looked curious and confused as hell after all.
around.
Grabbing his hands in his, Dean sobs silently.
Dean was willing to try for him...Castiel knew anyway that both of them couldn't be separated.
The way Dean touched him, licked his blood-stained lips, sucked his pale flesh. It felt like he was born again. How he whispered small nothings in his ear as he took him to climax. Dean's cold body. Rough fingers.
year on majoring engineering at their frat parties following that girl—Lena? Linda? —he didn’t even remember her name. She was Charlie’s friend and apparently, she was a model.
Before Castiel could go on top of Dean and start having a new make-out session, his phone started ringing.
“How about the next time we’ll go to Hogsmeade I’ll take you to Madam Puddifoot's?” the green-eyed lad asked hopefully?
"Hey man, what happened?" Dean asked casually but a hint of a soft smile was showing.
It was breathtaking, the wolf was huge, with golden and grey fur which was now soaked in--
The whole AO Arena of Manchester was screaming and cheering happily at the one and only, Castiel.
"She did huh?"
, Cas had months of being this close with someone, let alone feeling so much pleasure and lust he could probably see stars. Dean took mercy on him and started jerking him off alongside his deep fucking.
“Really now?” Castiel whimpered when his eyes fell on another pair of light brown wolfs, smaller with gold bright eyes.
"Kiss me, Dean!" he said with so much confidence, he didn't even believe he did that.
"Okay, leave Mr. mini Disgusting turtle and let me clean your hands, It's sandwich time."
The blue-eyed man walked away from his desk still crosshanded, his eyes watching Dean.
The thing is, Cas does one-night stands, he never goes for a second date. Dean was placid for that, cause he did it himself, the man needed sexual content, he wasn't called womanizer and playboy for nothing in law school.
Cas sighed,
, it must be dread to have Dean like this, he so much hoped Sammy hadn't ever think Dean was heading in their dad's footsteps.
, he tasted so good. parting his lips, he let their tongues slipping in together. It felt like Heaven, so warm, so soft, and yet so hard. Dean was kissing like he was trying to prove everything Cas said was important to him.
"It's my turn I guess..." he chuckled.
“You’re stronger than this Cas…” He looked into the mirror, spoking softly. The muffled sound of water in the shower running, reminding him of the man he was so
Starting the car, Cas hoped he would be able to heal the poor creature.
"Are you really wanna have sex in a cave?"
hard.
He was a simple warrior. The only thing though that relieved him was that his men,
And the way she threatened him, she is afraid, she is jealous of him, but why? Dean is straight...
"Hi, Cas." the green-eyed man pushed away from the car and came to Castiel's space, wrapping an arm around him, he gave him a peck on his cheek and Castiel resisted the urge to bury his face in Dean's neck and breath him in as his scent was warm, spicy and very heady.
Dean was so done.
"It's fine, baby, I'm here..." Castiel's heart clenching when Dean started whispering broken sorries into his ear.
"Castiel! Sorry for coming up here, I just couldn't wait..." the blonde man says, coming closer to his best friend. Dean's smile disappeared and he frowned at the couple in front of him.
Then it was kind of hard to sleep with anyone, woman or man. The green-eyed lawyer rarely picked guys, but when his blue-eyed
Castiel quickly lugs by his side, stumbling on his knees to touch Dean.
Dean moved closer pulling a blanket over them and then him closer to his chest. His arms wrapping around Castiel’s waist,
” Castiel heard Professor Singer’s voice the head of Hufflepuff house. Professor Singer lifted him up with his big arms, “You okay boy?”
Dean found you,
Castiel blushed when Dean bent down so they were eye-level. When the jock touched his hand instead of the book, Castiel's eyes widened, and his lips parted from the surprise.
Castiel tried not to stare at Dean’s naked low area, even though he had seen him a lot of times like that.
"Carmen?" Cas was extremely surprised to see her, it was a day before the wedding, she must have a lot of things to do.
"Dean Winchester, only you,
Castiel flinched as he suppressed a choked sob,
"Maybe later I'll tell you..."
“Charlie my phone, I need to find my phone, maybe there’s something that can help me understand why my brother is here.” Castiel suddenly got up, adrenaline rushing through all his body.
“Can’t wait for our date…”
"Sure."
"Fuck, Cas you're so hot..." he said breathlessly as he cupped his jaw slowly and sensually.
"I'm sorry! Sorry!" But the wolf wouldn't be stilled. His legs pinwheeled, and Cas gave a final twist and tug as the wolf teetered up and curled around himself, panting heavily.
"...to be my w-wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for b-better, for worse... for richer...f-for poorer, in sickness and in health... to lo-ve... and to c-cherish, till dea-th... us... d-do part..." Every word came hard for his best friend to say, it was like,
“Cas…” Bobby says as he gets up, Castiel gives him a teary smile, as he can’t control his tears now. He could collapse at any moment. He still can’t believe this.
Later Hazel flopped at Cas' feet, exhausted, and the kids came over and shoved their way up on the bench, announcing they were hungry. Dean took the sandwiches he had packed and gave everyone one, they all ate silently but he couldn't help his grin when Cas moaned silently at the taste of his cheese mayo pork deliciousness.
“Come here.” She says pulling him into a comforting hug.
Cause if he waits to pay the bills and college expenses of his siblings with his current salary Castiel could laugh out loud.
“Are you eating?” he blurted concernedly, eyes searching for Cas’ soul, the smaller man didn’t know how to cook for shit. When they were dating Dean spoiled him with burgers and mac and cheese all the time, he was after all a double bacon cheeseburger expert.
Cheers and laughs surround him, Charlie recording him with her phone and Sam with Benny losing their voices by laughing so hard.
“Dean, what’s wrong?” Cas’ voice was panicked.
After he took his phone and his trench coat to cover Dean, that was thrown on the back seats, Castiel returned and knelt next to Dean covering him softly, still having a shocked frown.
‘Lead the way,
It’s gonna hurt like hell not seeing Dean coming to his apartment late at night with a dirty smile, coming to Castiel and pushing him into the wall kissing his neck and sucking dark red hickeys like he
Dean sighs, “It wasn’t supposed to be me…”
"And I know you probably won't--"
Dean pulled him into his chest and locked their lips together, Castiel moaned spreading his fingers out to cup Dean's jaw, drawing a line of kisses from Dean's lips, along his chin, and down to his neck.
"Okay, here's the deal, you will not come to our wedding tomorrow, call sick or whatever I don't know...if you do, I'll tell him you assaulted me, or, oh! You're in love with him! Bet you'll hate how he would react, you keeping this secret..."
