"Small accident. Emphasis on
John cocked his head a bit, not following.
Comments:
Lestrade excused himself from the police officer taking up his time, there wasn’t exactly an abundance of clues at the scene, though it was strange that it appeared to be the first murder that took place inside a house, did it mea this one was directly targeted unlike the previews victims believed to chosen at random for their appearance and orientation? Then again Lestrade wasn’t too sure how easy it was to find a young attractive blond that was also a lesbian- not that type of person he had tried looking for before.
“Why do go to stores so often? I always see you with shopping bags but never what’s in them.”
He shook his head no. It was strange, certainly not something he had felt before. Sherlock flexed his hands, they felt normal at least.
"J-J-John?" She gasped.
Chapter 16
“Blimey… I though the couch was just drunk talk. You didn’t…. I mean, no heh, what am I saying? Of course you didn’t…”
He unlocks the door and swings it open, “John! John!” he calls loudly but there’s no answer. He sees the cracked screen of his cell phone laying on the coffee table. There’s no doubt, John was here, had come in last night as he was asleep in the apartment below. He could curse himself for not waiting here longer.
-Hedgehog?-
Molly gasped, “What have you done to yourself? Oh you two!”
Greg could see the black outline of the small boat just above him, he almost dismissed the small form next to him as an over sized minnow. He cupped his hands around it and surfaced.
John nodded.
________________________________________
John woke to the faint smell of cigarette smoke and something strangely chemical. Not wanting to wake up just yet he kept his eyes closed and pushed his face deeper into the pillow immediately feeling skin against his forehead.
“I wont, Lock. I promise. You just need to calm down.” John gently pushed Sherlock back against the bed. “I think you have a fever.” Which would probably explain some of his odder then normal behavior.
Mycroft was dressed as impeccable as always and was holding a take away bag from a high-end bakery, he was clearly not expecting to see Lestrade in such a state. A raised an eyebrow before lifting up the bag, “Thought you might like something edible- impossible to know the state of the food in this flat.”
Sherlock pressed his forehead against the cold porcelain of the tub. At least it provided a small amount of relief for him.
“That’s where he said he was going, yea. Why does this matter again?” John furrowed his brow, hoping some explanation to all of this was about to come.
Gills. He had fucking gills.
Looking up again, Sherlock seemed like his very life was on the line, “I can’t… tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow at 12. Mycroft will be gone by then and…” his voice trailed off a bit.
“Damn.” Lestrade rubbed his forehead. Too bad Sherlock wasn’t here. He loved this sort of weird mystery type thing.
“I’ll figure something out, we’ll focus on communicating and the case for now.”
“Where’s Watson?”
John quickly stood, “You’re right,” Something about his friend was alarming him now. “I’ll dry it off a bit more.”
“What?”
“Oh, right. Well, it’s alright if you want to be there in person too.” His voice was barely above a whisper.
John groaned but climbed into Sherlock's palm anyway, terrified that the detective would drop him. Sherlock was surprisingly gentle with John though, partially cupping his other hand over John's head for added protection. He placed John on the now empty kitchen table, then turned to the stove to make single fried egg.
"I knew what had happened as soon as I saw the beaker that broke… I kept hoping that night that maybe it hadn't entered his blood stream, that it wouldn't affect him. But I knew. I just… I didn't want him to freak out." He looked at Lestrade for a second then down at the ground ashamed. "I haven't told him yet."
“Well you’ll just have to inform my brother that I am not currently at my office to do so,”
Nope, just a simple little room with a bed and a desk, luckily no dorm mate at the moment. –
He’s doing much better actually. Shops a lot though. Shopaholic? GL
This time John did fall backwards as Sherlock laid an unexpected kiss on the top of his head. “I like that.” John could feel the air from Sherlock’s words against his body.
“Erm, I can feel that too.”
Mycroft clenched his teeth. “Sherlock wouldn’t have wanted you to do this.”
‘Serious enough that I should hide in the dark with ‘big brother’ looking after me?’ –SH
‘ These thoughts didn’t help though, the monotone words Sherlock had said had actually hurt him.
John rolled his eyes, “I highly doubt anything could get him to go with you.”
Chapter 23
“Sherlock?” He called out quietly through the hall.
Regards,
“Thirty seconds…. JOHN! Quickly, climb to my pocket.” Sherlock’s face was suddenly an emotionless mask.
Sherlock took a shuttering breath, “I want to see you, in person, I really do, but it’s just not possible.”
John placed Sherlock in a chair at the table and cleared away some of the science equipment. “I’ll bet one of my jumpers will fit you better.”
“Hmm? Oh, no, I really don’t care.” John laughed awkwardly. “I know she’d forgive me. I don’t think I would forgive her though.”
“Don’t you dare!”
again. “People are always telling me I should see a therapist after all.” He smiled sarcastically.
“Er, yes? He does do that sometimes?” John was thoroughly confused.
“What if you got to pick the next one then?” Sherlock pleaded.
Sherlock tapped on the cell phone towering next to them.
Molly’s eyes darted down the aisle for a moment, “So what are you doing here?”
Greg nodded and set the violin down in the small living room. There was a comfortable fireplace, a pair of wing-back chairs, and a worn in couch. The walls were bare, ready for someone to move in. A small kitchenette was hidden by pocket doors that slid in and out of the walls, allowing the room to be separated or open to the main living area.
John’s heart melted a little “You really don’t want anyone to see you like this do you?”
Alive
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Mycroft, probably come to gloat over his ‘
“The second body…” Sherlock mumbled to himself.
“Don’t you worry pet, I wont have you die so quickly, I have a special plan in mind for you.” She stepped forward around the chair and wrapped the wire around her neck again, this time tying it into a noose. “Obey and I’ll let you have air, disobey and I pull harder till you listen or pass out. Do you understand me?”
John was more then a bit disappointed that Sherlock didn’t seem to trust him enough to tell him. A small part of him had even hoped they might meet one day, Sherlock had been very open to giving John his phone number after all, though a bit more hesitant when it came to web caming for the first time.
Mycroft had leaned down to look at John but backed off after his brother’s outburst. “I really still thought this was some grand hoax…”
“No… no, those aren’t selfish Sherlock.”
You're obviously trying to get me to say something about his size, or lack there of. I would very much like him back if you would be so kind- SH
"Go see if the other body has a scratch too."
“I’ll uh, just go get him.” Molly squeaked and dashed out after the doctor.
“No John, It’s not ok, nothing is ok.” Sherlock’s voice was every bit as frantic as he looked.
“Sherlock… “ John groaned. That arse would write that. He couldn’t help but smile fondly as he shook his head.
‘Assisting?’ Is that what you’re calling what you just did?-
“What?” John’s voice was playful, he knew they should probably plan their escape now and find a way back to their flat from the warehouse and try desperately to find a cure for both of them, but he couldn’t help himself. He was finally,
“Fine now… thank you John.” Sherlock’s eyes watched John’s hand before they flicked up to him, a small smile forming on his lips. “Planning ‘busting me out’ of here?” A glimmer of teeth showed through his smile as he tilted his head forward a bit.
Just curious. I mean, we’re friends, friends tend to know those things. But it’s alright, you don’t need to tell me. –
Probably never, no. –
Lestrade: Why did I not see this coming? Congratulations you two!
“Its really fine, just pulling your chain.”
“You what? What do you mean you ‘did’?”
Hours passed as the old man called various news stations and museums asking what they would pay to get a hold of his 'genuine fae folk'. John didn't pay much attention but in they end there seemed to only be one person interested, an auction house that dealt in extremely rare and valuable goods. Occasionally some questionably illegal sells as well.
Sherlock’s grin slowly turned into a frown, “I know. You’re not coping very well, I’m not even sure if you’ll remember this when you wake up, and even if you do, you might write off anything I say as part of your dream.” He curiously forked a piece of sausage and put it in his mouth, surprised to find it was the juiciest piece of meat he had eaten in his entire life.
John helped him pull one out. Luckily there was a light on the sink from where he occasionally lit candles. “I’m only letting you have one.” He lit it for him. “But it’s not fine. You need to take your damn clothes off before you get sicker.” He reached for the hem of the shirt.
It took John a moment to asses the image, he noticed the body type was much different from the previous images. “Well… he’s alright I guess… Five.”
Lestrade thought. “You two are not playing some weird power trip BDSM games where I work now are you?”
"ugh, this is disgusting Sherlock." Lestrade looked away.
“Well get him to cut it out.” Lestrade came from behind the taller man and grabbed him by the coat, “Come one, back to the scene.” ‘
“I go through the trouble of making you a Jacuzzi and this is the thanks I get.” He puffed his lower lip out and pouted.
He pried at the boards with his hands and then kicked at it with all his strength. He was worn from fighting off the tarantulas, but he sure as hell wasn’t about to give up, not when he was so close.
Lestrade blinked and quickly swallowed his bit of donut. “Wait, does Sherlock do it too?”
Teasing me with a sex toy? That seems a bit beneath you. –
Motionless
"See grandpa! I told you I found a real one!"
“John I-“
“Shit… Seriously, you’re going to drown, stop it.” His eyes fell down to where he felt something strange on Sherlock.
“It’s that or die. I wasn’t able to reach it before. John please…. It was… a last resort.”
Lestrade looked like he had just found the killer in a case, “Mycroft was at your flat? Yesterday??”
Sherlock tilts his head, “Please understand it was necessary that you-“
“If you don’t wish to be seen then you should stay in there.”
“I thought I heard it.” Greg sighed, raking a hand through his greying hair.
“I mean it. Just… don’t tell anyone ok? It’s bad enough I’m going through with it.”
“You’re door… it was unlocked…” Clearly he was mistaken. Why would Mycroft try to trick him into coming in?
“Sorry,” Lestrad sat back in his seat. “No idea how that even happened. Must have bumped the table somehow.”
"You're too old for me anyway" she shot a look at Greg's graying hair and spun on her heels to leave. "I hope you're both happy!" the words were dripping with venom.
“Yes… it should seem so. The victim was viciously pulled by her hair, lacerations on her face and arms.”
“Wherever those two are right now I just hope they’re together, they’re both lost without each other.”
“I see you’ve come after all ‘Captain Hedgehog’.”
“She was just…”
John is sulking now, rather amusing actually. He seems prone to offence since the accident.- SH
"Just go answer it."
Lestrade unceremoniously shifted Sherlock from both to just one hand and with his free one un-capsized the RC boat. John was clutching to the cheaply made sails gasping for breath.
“Considering what?”
Sherlock breathed out nervously. “I like having you all to myself John.” He still didn’t make eye contact. “Always knowing where you are… you depending on me for so much. I know that’s selfish.
Moran took a deep swallow as he held the vial out for the now three foot man “here.”
Sherlock pulled John close so his back was against his chest and tucked the shorter man’s head under his chin; arms wrapped around him snuggly. “John’s my boyfriend.”
“I’m here now John.” Sherlock reached his hand out to John’s shoulder and went straight through him.
Mary had come around 6pm dressed up and in high spirits as she entered the flat.
“Ah, good.”
‘You’re getting paranoid now. Time to head back home.’ John started clearing up some papers on his desk before deciding to leave early. He just needed a bit more time was all.
John’s eyes scanned the oversized room. “Mantle?”
A light knocking came from the front door.
“Not sure what I’ll tell John when he sees me with this. Oh well.” He carefully packed the violin and bow up. Then noticing Sherlock’s iconic blue scarf. It was positioned next to the bed of course, where John had been sleeping.
“John! John help me!”
Sherlock sat in the police lab going through evidence from the scene.
And what would that be? A way for you to stick to your diet?- SH
John realized that it might sound bad to admit that he was planning on working a case. “Visit an old friend.” He quickly came up with a lie.
“That doesn’t even make sense! You said this was for apprehending criminals! What are you planning? Giving them a hand job after you’ve drugged them?”
“I’m sorry… I’m so sorry… I didn’t know how else to-“
“In the safety of my home, as always.”
“Look, Greg- he cares about Mycroft is all.” John stated slowly, doing his best to ignore the fact that Sherlock was crouched on the sofa texting for this awkward conversation.
"It should appear to be that way, yes."
“Erm, hang on a moment…” his eyes scanned wildly across the crime scene looking for foot imprints. There were too many officers obscuring his vision
Sherlock stood in John’s bedroom doorway looking hurt and dejected. “But you promised.”
"You're being over dramatic again, if you couldn't breath in there then you would have already died by now. Besides, I thought you were still napping." Sherlock reached in his pocket to pull John out."
“It’s a movie- never mind,” he let out a heavy sigh, “There’s been no leads in the case so far.”
Sherlock abruptly stood, walked out of the room and returned quickly with something in hand.
It seemed to work as he peered silently with those solid black eyes.
“I’m sure.”
“Barrowers?” Mycroft raised an eyebrow.
“I’ll just have to divorce myself of my desire of touch. Simple enough.”
“I have no idea what you are talking about.”
“You left a pair of heels at home.” The detective mused, now realizing John hadn’t brought a single woman back to the apartment since he left it last.
I regret this decision, do not open the package when it arrives. –SH
“This is more then just sleeping arrangements right?” John’s face was too hard for Sherlock to read.
“He doesn’t mean it like that!” it was too late, she left. “Damn it Sherlock! I don’t even want to know what she thinks now!”
“He’ll die if we don’t locate him right now.”
“Oh! Janette!” he didn’t think he would see her again after their last awkward phone call ending with her saying she didn’t need to waist any more time with him. Overhearing that his flatmate was forcing him to watch porn while he was suppose to go out with her that night likely didn’t help matters. “How are you?”
Sherlock looked down at his lap, “No, it can’t be anywhere. It has to be here.”
Greg’s flat was an absolute mess after Sherlock had died. There were old case files laying all about from cases he had the late detective help him with. Each one of them were only solved because Sherlock was there for input. There was no way one person could possibly fake that much work. He had to right this, however he possibly could.
They couldn’t hear each other but both men found themselves laughing at the silliness of the situation.
“Oh…” Molly couldn’t remember the last time John had even mentioned going on a date and he didn’t seem the type to actually go shopping with a girlfriend. But then she knew people tended to act a bit different after a traumatic experience, it was plausible anyway. “I’d love to meet her sometime. It’s um.. been a while. I’ve missed you.”
"Wrong."
“I am not infatuated with him.” His voice was barely above a whisper his eyes admit on not looking at her.
John grabbed the salt and marched his way back to the bedroom. “well, there are alternatives if you are actually interested.” He poured an exceptionally thick line blocking the closet doorway.
Sherlock was completely fixated, his finger tips starting to wander through John’s soggy hair a bit more.
“Bored?” John repeated confused.
Sherlock nodded, seeing that Mycroft was grinning and obviously the source of where ever the hell that voice was coming from. Clearly John wasn’t meant to hear them. But he remembered. He was 7 at the time and a much older boy had hit and kicked him, sending Sherlock to the ground. Mycroft came to his aid, but it had been to late. Something otherworldly had come over him as he grabbed the boy with a strength he had never known and pounded into him. The other boys and girls and sworn on their lives that Sherlock’s eyes had gone solid black. The teachers dismissed it as hysterical children telling stories. But Mycroft had seen it. Made it a point of researching their heritage a bit more after that, but Sherlock never cared enough to hear him out. But there was something inside him that day at the playground. He had felt it squirming somewhere deep inside himself.
“I don’t suppose you would lend me your jacket?” Sherlock’s voice began stuttering with the chill air.
“John? Can you hear me?” he clutched the edge of the sheet nervously, the lump moved. “Can you come out?” he gently lifted the sheet up, the orange tabby slinked further away under the sheet. Sherlock sighed. “I didn’t mean to drop you John.” He grabbed a third biscuit and held it out. Slowly the cat came closer and began eating again, this time Sherlock realized the small pastries were filled with minced meat.
“The ouija board is hardly practical, it takes you forever to tell what I’m writing- no spaces and all that, and you can’t exactly bring it with you on a case.”
“Please Molly, it’s very important.”
"I'm really sorry about that Lock, he's quite possibly the stupidest person ii have ever met in my life. Just ignore him." John gently took the handles of sherlock's chair and pushed him inside, turning the chair to face him before shutting and locking the door. "Sherlock? Are you ok?"
“What do you mean by both…” Lestrade stopped short when he realized why exactly Sherlock’s clothes would be in an empty warehouse but not him.
“Mhm. Its a bit like paint, used contacts for my eyes- thought it might alarm you if you woke up to floating eyes.”
Molly was speechless for a moment, “It’s a him?”
This was ridiculous. Completely ridiculous. Ok, so there were a few strange noises the other day and then Molly had brought over a Ouija Board. That didn’t prove anything other then mass hysteria. John leaned against the kitchen counter, tea mug in hand. Dreams, noises, and his grief stricken mind, that was all that was going on. He felt utterly absurd now that he thought about it. There were no such things as ‘ghosts’. Sherlock had died. It was a horrible thing and John knew he would miss him for the rest of his life. But god damn it, he wasn’t haunting him. This whole thing was giving him a raging headache.
“Erm, about earlier, in the doll shop.”
“Besides. I’ll feed you.” His voice sounded far behind John now, like it was coming from the kitchen.
“Yes. And clean the flat up after me. Get mad at me for sitting too close while in a cab. Run after me when I’m chasing a criminal down, place a blanket on me when I’ve fallen asleep, force a plate of food in front of me, wear disguises and go undercover, fall asleep on my shoulder during stake outs-“
Sherlock bit his tongue, he truly hadn’t meant to say that. “Well, yes, it’s possible…”
“What do you talk to her about?”
“Oh Jawn you’re the best! You’re absolutely brilliant in every way!” Sherlock sprawled himself across the couch in the blink of an eye.
“Ok, that was actually really painful.” There was a bit of blood, but not nearly as much as he expected and it seemed to already be stopping. “Are you staying now?” He looked at Sherlock hopefully, ignoring the solid black eyes.
Lestrade lost sight of the direction Sherlock had pointed in, for a brief moment as he looked back between the people in the crowded club he could have sworn he saw Sherlock kissing the person who had attacked Sally. Which was impossible of course.
Greg rolled his eyes, “Sherlock typically.”
Sherlock took in a deep breath before he downed the vial in one gulp. John watched expectantly.
“Why would you two go out if he was so tired?”
Chapter 7
John swallowed, “Yea… thanks for that. You might have dyed your skin you realize? Might have to wait for the first layer to die off. And your hair…”
K, bye… -
“Fine, but you should know, its just a two person dorm, its pretty small.”
“GREG.” Sherlock repeated rather loudly.
“Fine.” He looked down as he shuffled to the kitchen, which was as always serving as a makeshift lab. “I need you to catalogue any changes that occur.” He brought the clear liquid filled vial up and frowned. “Are you sure you want me to…?”
“It would be helpful if you filled me in. Seriously, anything would help me out here.” John blinked. The gills had only come out because Sherlock was in water. He was behaving like a fever-ridden person. Was it the storm? Was this what Mycroft had warned him about?
“No- the club, that’s the only case of a double homicide. The second victim is the only one that doesn’t fit the pattern. Why?”
. “Would you like to be in a relationship? With me I mean.”
“Of course not.” Sherlock smiled and leaned down, placing one arm under John’s legs and the other on his back.
“Well obviously.” Sherlock huffed.
"I need him back…" the detective was shaking subtly.
"Oh please, your 'dates' are with the dullest women and you really don't need to go on them. I don't see why you bother."
Lestrade sighed as the two men came back, “Again, I’m really sorry John, I-“ the DI trailed off as he noticed the two men were holding hands. “Erm, but anyway, Sherlock- the uh, bodies, any ideas?” he tried his best to pretend he hadn’t noticed.
“Now then, tell me everything you remember from being hypnotized.”
Sherlock looked down at his watch, “Already in affect by now.”
John busily made up two plates of food and set the kettle, “How much bacon would you like?”
Everything alright?- GL
A month passed.
Just got in. –
-Porn, John? Really?-
“Bloody hell, how’d you get trapped in there?” Lestrade expected to find the door handle locked, but as he twisted it, the door opened as if it always could.
“I know.” He stepped closer, a grin widening on his face.
“What?! Of course not!” John quickly crouched behind the couch in embarrassment.
He bit back an amused smile, “Sorry. I could give you a boost if you like.”
"I'm working on it. Not sure when I can figure it out though." Sherlock put his hand palm up next to John.
Lestrade closed the blinds to his office. "Uh, Sherlock?"
“This is also the first experiment you haven’t protested.”
Sherlock’s face fell at that.
“Shite, sorry.” John quickly opened it, feeling even more like a fool then ever before. “I wasn’t expecting you.”
Greg huffed and closed his donut box. “I’m just gonna go see him. It will be fine.” He ran a hand over his midsection. “And stop binge eating junk…” Mycroft was always so hard on himself and trying to diet, and here he was keeping a whole donut shop in business.
Mycroft gave him a quizzical look, eyes still inhumanly black. “Its not the other tentacle creature in the room.” He deadpanned.
“No, I don’t. I’m not the John Watson you think I am.” John turned to leave; it would be the last crime scene he ever showed up at.
“You may bring John if you like, I’m sure she would love to meet him.”
John laughed. “Of all things that you are, trust me, ‘boring’ is not one of them.” This was by no means a compliment, but he wasn’t too sure Sherlock would understand that or not.
John tried to mask a frown, how long had Sherlock been storing himself away in that house? He could see Sherlock was squinting from the sun that he never went in. “Sounds great, just lead the-“ John froze and stopped mid sentence, oh god what had he just said?
"Maybe he never went in the hole? It is an awfully long fall." Greg offered as explanation.
Mrs. Hudson: Darn that Sherlock, he should have said something. I’ll bring you some food deary.
“Oh God no.”
John was quiet for a moment, “You just can’t make someone gay.”
“That was hardly a bit not good, they’ve been separated for over a year now but neither had the money to move.” He stated matter of factly.
John reddened from embarrassment at Mrs. Hudson’s last comment and couldn’t bring himself to read the following comments that were still pouring in. That woman had no shame with her constant implications.
"Sherlock! What the bloody hell did you do to him!?"
You crinkle your nose when you’re mad, I’ll bet you’re doing it right now. –
“You’re a damn ass you know that.” John’s voice was louder then he thought and he quickly covered his mouth with both hands, releasing Sherlock from his grip.
“Bones can’t feel sentiment-“
The cab ride back to the flat was filled with words that went unsaid.
An hour passed and Sherlock made sure John was dead asleep before he scooted his smaller body against John’s chest and snuggled into him, gleeful when his blogger’s arm subconsciously wrapped around his body.
people do, go out on dates."
John scoffed,
“Shit.” Sherlock left to answer the phone leaving John to lay back on the couch.
Chapter 5
“Hmm? Oh, well, classes have been difficult, again, not really use to being back in school after all.” John finally turned to look at her, his gaze still a bit distant.
Chapter 17
“I’m just going to check if you’re hurt.” John went for the hem of the shirt again, but Sherlock held it firmly in place. “Come off it! You’re clearly not alright and you might be really hurt!”
Now was as good a time as any to start trying to move things. He became so focused on trying to turn the page of an open book that he didn’t hear Mrs. Hudson come in.
That night John tried to sneak into the flat unnoticed.
John shoved the phone in Sherlock’s chest, he wasn’t putting up with this treatment anymore.
There was a crash from the kitchen that sent John jumping to his feet. A pantry was open with several plates shattered on the ground.
Ah, so why the sudden goodbye? –JW
“That’s right.”
No, liking you means I do. Should I bring it when I visit? –
"My god, did you see it?" Sherlock's voice had an unusual tone to it.
Sherlock tried calling out to John again, but it was useless. He tried staggering to his feet, but barely reached the door of his room when he lost his balance and fell to his knees. The room was swirling around him. He grabbed hold of the carpet, but didn’t change anything.
Sherlock gave the D.I. a firm nod before turning back to John, “Angelo’s?”
When they arrived, there were a few police cars about, but not nearly as many as a typical homicide would warrant. Lestrade jumped out, all business, John was quick to follow. Donovan was already there, luckily having the squad car with her.
“I would want you to want it, and I would definitely want you to remember.”
Sherlock knew exactly what happened. He wasn’t sure when they had appeared, but two tendrils were now feeling their way around the inner walls of the tub curiously. His head felt strangely heavy now making it harder to think. He could feel everything the limbs touched, though it was certainly different from touching something with his own hands.
Sherlock nodded and thought for a moment. There was in fact quite a lot he wanted from John.
The cap was filled with water; it was the perfect size for John, which only helped to further frustrate him.
Who the hell is this? This is sick and I want answers.
John cut him off by putting a finger up. “Long night last night, I’m going to kip for half an hour, wake me up then and you can do whatever you like to me.” He smiled knowingly.
“I really need you to figure this one out fast. I can’t keep the body here for more then a few minutes longer. It could rain any time now and I need this body on route to the morgue before that.” Greg fidgeted a bit with a notepad he was holding.
It started as a small fizzing sensation in the pit of Moriarty’s stomach and began to spread through the rest of his torso and limbs. The consulting criminal put all his effort into concentrating on the fists of his hands to make the increasingly more prominent buzz go away. The edge of his suit sleeves slowly inched closer to the edge of his fists. His teeth clenched fiercely as the prickling sensation changed into a wild heat that encompassed his body making his bones feel as if they were melting. Moriarty feel to his knees doubling over from the pain.
“What? No we can not! I’m not gay.”
“Guess you’re off the hook now.” His mouth tugged upwards into a sly smile.
"I see." John had picked up a small beaker with a clear blue liquid in it, it seemed harmless enough but if Sherlock was involved it likely wasn't.
“Fine, fine. But there’s not exactly a lot of places to go dressed like this anyway. I only went to clubs before and frankly that was getting boring since I didn’t really know anyone.”
“I don’t stay up that late, everyone at school goes to sleep well past midnight these days.”
Greg felt the natural urge to back up, which forced him against the sink, more water spilling out. “I thought… you didn’t want me coming over?”
Mycroft seemed suddenly uncomfortable and horrified in his own right. Only just realizing what he had been doing. It was too late now. Gregory knew he was a monster. He disentangled from his prey, ready to leave. “There’s a key on the desk, you have to lock me in-”
-I’ve never heard of the class before-
“I can’t really blame you for who I find attractive.”
"My God look at that." A shaky voice mumbled.
How could he possibly explain that every night in his dreams he saw Sherlock falling? Heard his last words again and again? Regretted not saying more? Not doing more? Wondering if he could have somehow stopped it? Knowing things would never be the same again.
Raid tonight? –JW
John’s fingers hovered over the keyboard hesitantly, he didn’t want to sound too excited over the prospect of seeing Sherlock for the first time. His hand dropped down to the mouse instead, clicking the symbol of the phone instead, waiting nervously as his speaker made an irritating ringing noise.
"Well I am rather good at getting rid of your dates, but why should I? She'll leave eventually."
‘I did. I enjoyed the company even better though. Maybe next time we could try dinner?’ –GL
“Is that so?” his palm was flat for John to climb up on.
Chapter 9
“I already got him.” He plopped the soaking wet and highly disgruntled detective into the boat. “You two are the most irresponsible idiots-“ he had prepared for a full-fledged scolding for risking their lives in such stupid way but stopped.
“No, he’s pretty busy though. Not terribly unusual for him.” He was quite use to going periods of time without seeing the elder Holmes. But he normally heard from him much more frequently then this. “Oh, he did tell me to inform you there was no will. He didn’t have much though, just what was in the flat.”
A drop of rain fell on Lestrade’s note pad. “Shit.” He really needed more time. This was the third body in three weeks. He didn’t want to find a fourth. “Bag it!” He called out as two forensics quickly got to work on taking the body away.
John peered back into the room. “Is that Greg?”
“And don’t forget you did promise to be my guinea pig.”
Sherlock turned and smirked. “You think so?”
“Hold on, I’m not sure you’re ok,” John drew closer and peered back inside the tub. “Try to stay with me?” He had realized that Sherlock may not be entirely aware of what was happening just now.
A quiet murmuring came from the corning of the room at that, making Sherlock sit up fully. But it was only John, still fully dressed despite the hour and sleeping in a chair. Sherlock let out a breath of air. John must have fallen asleep watching him.
“You’re invisible, we are not going.”
Greg returned the frame to its rightful place on the mantle when he heard the sound of soft music coming from the bedroom. He thought he must be mistaken at first, but there it was. Gentle violin music. He couldn’t decide if this was some prank or what was going on, but seeking the source of the sound was probably best.
“That’s why you have me.” Sherlock stood up and poured a cup of hot water placing it down in front of John.
That was too far. John stood up and pushed Sherlock’s second hand barrier aside. “MARIA!” he had his commanding Captain John Watson voice. “That’s enough! Just leave, please.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, trying to relax now as the tub filled up more. “You know very well that I lied… but I haven’t smoked a single one. Isn’t that what counts?”
Mycroft had a faint smile, “Are you always so apologetic?
“John wait, I need you,” Sherlock just had to stop them. He looked at the few pieces of furniture in there and noticed one of the dresser drawers wasn’t fully closed. He gathered all the energy he could muster up and forced it shut. Making a satisfying sound. All three of them immediately turned back towards the room, searching it frantically now.
A tiny Sherlock climbed out of the hideously colored orange purse and gave John a hand to follow. “We are not missing, but I do appreciate your concern and the return of my coat.” He eyed his prized possession, “Wha- what the hell did you do to my coat! It’s filthy!”
Sherlock looked around, maybe a previous tenant or Daniel’s himself had left a spare key. He grinned as he felt one just above the doorframe. A small flick sent it falling and caught Greg’s attention.
Chapter 10:
“Ah… great,” his voice dripped with nervous sarcasm. “Any, uh, ideas for today then?”
“No, no. Its here now and I really don’t mind. I meant that.” He looked at Greg seriously. “Besides, I could use the company more.”
“W-what?” Sherlock clicked the screen off.
Sherlock’s ears lowered, “You’re always complaining I don’t eat or drink enough…”
John was hyperventilating at the edge of the roof, Sherlock gathered it was a safe bet to assume he knew what building they were on top of. He grabbed John by the waist and pulled him away from the ledge.
Sherlock scrunched his nose and immediately looked up. “What?”
"For the moment, yes. Oh, but this doll maker, he's just incredible!"
Ella’s expression suddenly changed “Oh no, is this Sherlock Holmes? You’re different without the hat.”
The knock came again, firmer this time, but still no answer.
Once in the cab relatively behind closed doors John started telling Sherlock all the reasons why this stunt was
“He sent me…” John couldn’t wrap his mind around it. He knew he had promised not to open it, but it was far too late for that now, John had already seen it and there was no way of unseeing it.
“Sh-Sherlock….” John’s voice suddenly sounded confused and fearful.
“We’ll need more,” They didn’t have enough yet.
Sherlock let out a sigh, “Yes Lestrade, I tore up the couch.”
Sherlock turned and pressed himself firmly against Lestrade, “Rub my back, please please please rub my back.”
“Hm?” John’s head popped back up, light catching his blue eyes just right. “I
“It’s ok. I know you didn’t mean for this to happen.”
“Thinking?” He had an uneasy smile as he set the file down in front of Sherlock.
"What? How did you know- well, they were also both lesbians."
“That too.”
“Mrs. Hudson!”
in a relationship with Sherlock.
"Oh my god, John, I'm so sorry! I'm so very sorry! I had no idea! What on earth happened to you?"
Lestrade quietly stepped into the kitchen wearing fresh clothes, watching as a strange woman entered from afar.
This struck John as particularly odd as the flat was usually well lit. He glanced toward the window; the sky was nothing but dark clouds. Of course it was probably about to rain, making the river extra high- John froze. He had had that same dream again last night. The one where he was drowning. How had he forgotten that when he woke up?
“Well, I’m sure if you would admit these feelings for him he would reciprocate in some way.”
“You guessed, it doesn’t count if you guessed.”
“Yes, well, the nature of this crime after all-“
Sherlock gave a short sharp nod, “The woman from the Lake house,  she had a distinct garlic scent to here, too much olive oil as well, she had gone there for lunch. Possibly on a date with another woman, Maria followed her home.”
"I... I love you too John."
edit: omg there were so many typos and no one said anything T^T
Lestrade nodded and gestured for John to follow him. He wasn’t letting some creep sneak up on them. He pulled his gun, keeping it low as he made his way to the room. John was kicking himself for not bringing his own firearm. The door to the room was slightly ajar. He carefully peaked inside, gun front and center. The room appeared empty, though he knew there was also a closet someone could hide in. Greg put his hand up, silently telling John to stand back as he turned all attention to the closet door. He opened it quickly in a fluid motion, prepared for the worst.
John nodded, “simple, simple is good.”
“I know… I’m sorry.” John went to pat Sherlock’s back with a surprising result.
John sat on the edge of the bed. It wouldn’t be long before the sun would start to dip down and there wasn’t much he could do but wait for Greg to come back.
“Mad? Why would I be mad? Now everyone knows you’re all mine.”
“I think it’s somewhere in-between.”
But John was a fast learner and often deserved more credit then he was given. He diligently practiced for a few days until Sherlock sent him a picture text of his new computer while learning from Molly.
"So about this case-"
“Unaware-!? Mycroft!!” What the hell was he even doing now? Greg soon found himself face down on the bed after being man handled by those things. Was Mycroft even really in control? One wrapped snuggly around his waist, which was strangely comforting.
“So he didn’t stay long?” Lestrade sounded almost disappointed. “And he went home after that?”
“Er, are you sure? I mean, it is an active crime scene after all.”
John sighed, “I don’t even know how you figured that out… I keep telling myself I wont do it again, but then it keeps happening.” It was just so welcoming and it even smelled like him. Then there were all those strange things that have been happening recently. “I know why you’re here, Greg. So if there’s anything specific you came to tell me, you can just come out and say it.” He didn’t want to beat around the bush anymore.
“But you said that was the ‘last command you tried.’ “
Lestrade spotted a folded note sticking out of one of the eye sockets of the skull and took it out.
John stared at him incredulously, “I’m not exactly gonna go to Tesco’s in a dress Sherlock.”
“Glaringly obvious they’ve been in love since the met maybe…” Harry muttered under her breath, earning her a strong slap across the face.
“It doesn’t matter, I’m not leaving him now.” John clenched his jaw, desperately wanting to move back and away from Mycroft. He felt a small squeeze around his hand and looked down.
Sherlock didn’t respond but merely looked away, clearly sulking. What was he even suppose to say to John?
“Go to a club or something?” Lestrade watched carefully as John’s eyes widened, so he had.
“What?”
Mycroft Holmes was completely unconscious.
Very funny. I give in. Yes, John seems to be size impaired at the moment. Just please tell me where he is.- SH
Sherlock looked up at John with a curious expression. John took a step back. By the time Sherlock leapt from the couch and was on him, the shorter man had no where to run. He was forcefully dragged into the bathroom for a very new kind of experiment.
“John you need to stop! Look around you, none of this makes sense, there’s nothing chasing us, it isn’t real.”
“He’s dead.” John deadpanned.
you keep rubbing me.”
________________________________________
“Or attractive.”
“Just take care.” Lestrade waved him off.
Mycroft calmly stood up, twirling the handle of the umbrella in his hands. “Because it would be far safer for you here.”
John frowned at the tea he had made that went untouched. “You gonna tell me what all that was about?”
“Hound? What are you talking about?”
"You're a bloody machine! You couldn't possibly mean that!"
John’s mad as hell face was back.
“It is you. Oh fuck, I- I don’t even know what to say.” He was still horrified, yet relieved to know that there might be some way to help the elder Holmes brother.
John blinked, the voice sounded so close. “Sherlock?”
"…and by under the weather I mean shrunk." Sherlock muttered seeing Lestrade discovered their secret.
Harry's expression revealed how distressing the detective was, "You must be Sherlock… John told me you might say something like that."
“Need to what?”
As he tried to think of ways to get back home, the world around Sherlock seemed to fade away into oblivion.
Sherlock huffed. Why was John so dense? Something could have been luring him into the closet.
“Only because you’re use to being a bloody giant.” John smiled. “Now then, I think I’ve found a way home.”
It just wont work out. –
John glanced at his clock, 11pm. He really wasn’t tired yet but other gamers were getting increasingly hard to come across in game. John leaned back in his chair as they both waited for more people to log on, but it seemed futile. John tilted his head, even when waiting idly Sherlock always had such straight posture. He clicked the small icon of his friend and the image filled the screen. He was obviously not aware that he was being watched so keenly. John couldn’t help but notice Sherlock’s eyes were racing across his screen- obviously not due to the game they were playing, a small smile on his face, barely noticeable even with the screen enlarged like it was.
John had the intense feeling that he was missing whatever this fight was actually about.
“Shit! Sorry about that,” Greg quickly got up and tried to clean the mess. Bits of ceramic every where. “You alright?” He couldn’t help but notice John not responding.
The phone lit up again.
John's pupil's dilated and smile twitched, "You've a funny way of showin it."
Sherlock stepped over the arm of the couch and quickly wrapped his arms around his blogger who fell on his back laying on the couch, Sherlock on top of him. They lay wordless in each other’s arms.
“What? No fare?” The boy casually picked up a near by pipe that they had likely brought with them, John instinctively took a step back- wrong decision. “Oi he looks scared doesn’t he? What’s wrong old man? Get nervous out in the cold?” he trailed the pipe against the wall to make a light dragging noise.
Molly screamed as John watched it, frozen in place.
Sherlock looked up seeing the filthy child but paid him no attention, instead he stalked toward the pipe shinning his flashlight inside.
John was busily putting the kettle on the stove.
Sherlock massaged his temples, “Jaaaawn. You are really going to sit there and say David Tennant is a ‘I would fuck him number Ten.’ And still claim to be straight?”
Lestrade's eyes widened in understanding. "Oh…"
Greg was still not completely sure what exactly happened to John that he ended up like that, but he knew it was entirely Sherlock's doing from the beginning.
She smiled and nodded, “Yup. Just ran into him there actually.”
John could hear Sherlock let out a small frustrated sigh he obviously didn’t intend for him to hear.
“Look at me.” Sherlock’s eyes were clearing, but still dark. “I’m a monster. I’m going to hurt you if I stay here any longer.”
John really hoped that Sherlock didn’t end up like that. He didn’t want to go through whatever Greg was going through. He shrugged, so they were friends. It was odd, but not a big deal, they were just like Sherlock and him. “Well, I’ll see you later, I’ll let you know if Mycroft pops up again.” He turned to leave.
“John? I’ve been reading your blog, I am glad you have continued it, but we need to talk about it.” Ella attempted to have a soft yet firm tone as she talked to her patient.
“But this is!”
Sherlock turned his wheels so he was facing away from Mycroft and down the hall at the front door. He couldn’t even recall the last time he had been outside. There was a large ledge in the doorway to keep air from escaping and two steps on the porch. Mycroft had never bothered installing a wheelchair ramp for him. It was extremely difficult and partially dangerous for him to attempt to leave on his own.
“John, that was rude and uncalled for. That is my favorite coat and I’m sure no matter what damage has been done it can be fixed-“
“How many times do I have to bring up that you promised this wouldn’t leave the flat?”
“Whoa! Hold on!” John flicked the cigarette away from him and tried to hold him up.
He’s more like Sherlock then I thought. “I meant more of the romantic assortment.” He chuckled nervously.
John nervously sat on the small couch across from Ella followed by an uncharacteristically quiet Sherlock.
“It’s… embarrassing ok?”
Lestrdae let his tongue stroke up the underside of the appendage, now gently sucking on it as Mycroft let out what even he could admit was a truly exquisite moan. Greg clenched his fists into the sheets beneath him, utterly annoyed at how hard this was making him. Fuck. He would just have to deal with that weird response later. Mycroft was so close to letting go now, he only had to keep teasing that tentacle for a bit longer.
Both of their phones buzzed at once, that always meant it was Lestrade texting about a case.
“John… I’m so sorry. God, what was I thinking?” He shakes John’s shoulder lightly, watching his eyes flutter open.
Molly blinked at the screen, was that a hint?
“I scratched you for hours yesterday!” John scoffed.
“Ok, let’s begin.” Sherlock held up the first image, it depicted a mostly nude and muscular man.
Tears were rolling down John’s face, “I just want to be with you. Please Sherlock, just let me. I need this. I need you. I can’t keep going without you Lock.”
Lestrade was writing everything down, but he wanted something more solid. Some clue that could actually result in a lead.
“Pity, that’s a life time supply at your size.”
“Har bloody har. Do you mind?”
The house was relatively large and had a prime location on a lake. Sherlock was grateful that Lestrade’s coat pocket was much lower then his own, it allowed him to poke his head out more often without the risk of being caught.
There was a moment of silence before Sherlock continued. “I was in a coma for a week. Mycroft was there when I woke up, he had fallen asleep waiting for me. I… I didn’t know what was wrong with me at first, why my legs didn’t work. The feeling in them came back a few months later, possibly because of Lestrade… or so he loves reminding me.”
“No? You seem a bit interested.”
John for once had more important things to think about then being a pawn in the mad man’s game.
“Well I could always leave if you think I’m not up to it, I’m sure Anderson over there could wrap the whole case up for you.” He smiled sarcastically.
“You never cared what anyone thought of you, you wouldn’t care what the papers printed. Not now. Not ever. That’s not why you… there was a different reason.”
Lestrade didn’t want to admit that a small part of him felt a bit better now that the closet was safeguarded from ghosts. Possibly witches as well. “Should we salt the main door to the flat too?”
“Ah, you’re just cranky because you need to sleep.”
Starting to catch on to what was happening Sherlock rushed his words out, “But John, it does matter! It matters very much, please.”
John kept trying to tell himself things could be worse. At least he was just wearing a well fitted bra instead of fake breasts. No, regardless, things just couldn’t be worse. He was trapped in a car dressed as a rather convincing woman if he did say so himself, with Mycroft Bloody Holmes.
It was a trap.
“You’re the one that killed my friend then.”
“No.”
“You mean-” Mycroft’s brow furrowed. “You really want this?”
“I’m taller then you.” And he continued to smile after John hit him in the face.
"Careful!" John didn't want anyone to know this had happened to him, but it was especially frustrating that he was tossed all over the place.
“Well you weren’t, so what does it matter?”
Moriarty shuffled through his definitely now wrinkled west-wood, his phone still waiting for him in his pocket. He hated that he needed Sebastian back, but there was no one else he could possibly trust. Everyone that had heard his name feared him, he had ears everywhere and usually a hired gun as well. But that wasn’t nearly enough to protect him now. He had to keep appearances up to keep people in fear, money alone doesn’t speak for it’s self these days, if it had Mycroft would have been an actual threat to him after his arrest, but people don’t respect money. People respect a good old fashioned villain.
Mr Rogers,
The door is unlocked, please shut it behind you. –SH
“You can always stop by you know, or call me over. I’m always glad to see you.” Molly had been grieving as well, Sherlock had of course meant a great deal to her and she couldn’t stop blaming herself in part for what had happened. ‘If only I had talked him out of it, there was always a possibility the plan wouldn’t go right…’ She blinked her tears away. John wasn’t allowed to know about that though.
Ella’s eyes narrowed. John had no way of knowing she lived alone with three cats after her ex fiancé left her. “John, let me see your phone.”
“I can assure you that Mummy will not care that you’ve gone and shrank yourself, you are coming to her birthday and that’s final. You only have to see her, no one else.”
Sherlock analyzed John’s facial reaction to his experiment.
“If this is to do with a certain young man I’ve heard you chatting with on your computer, it certainly does.”
"People will notice he isn't around for a while wont they? Especially Mrs. Hudson, she'll notice for sure."
“Likewise. Now we can begin the next experiment.” Sherlock grabbed a towel and began drying off his still stiff flatmate.
"Yes. If it was a random killing there would have been someone alone out back the perp could have killed. But no, the killer entered a crowded club, could have been noticed, could have risked dropping the weapon, there was a target. Upon inflicting the target and leaving I believe that's when your friend was poisoned by mistake."
“It would be useful to both of us if Lestrade knew. I would like to still solve cases- I know you appreciate me ‘saving people’ and it would allow you to have someone else in the know.”
Sherlock inspected the newest crime scene with renewed vigor. A middle aged woman lay dead across her living room floor. She was both short and blond like all the other with the exception of the second victim at the night club.
“These bodies are rather strange, just wanted you to have a look at them.”
“No, Not today, you are not deducing me!” Lestrade gritted his teeth together knowing exactly what the miniature detective was getting at, missing the quirk of Mycroft’s eyebrow.
It was worth the risk. "Sherlock! Sherlock help!" He called out but the detective still hadn't heard him and had even stepped outside to continue the argument. '
“I said drink it, that’s an order.” Moriarty had a cold and calculating tone with a hint of amusement behind his eyes.
“Oi! You’ve done it now! Sherlock, you can’t keep treating him like that.”
“John, I do believe I love you.”
They had approached Angelo’s, Sherlock stepped ahead and opened the door, waiting for John to walk in before him. He was 89% sure that he was socially inclined to do this assuming the events of last night would not be forgotten by his flat mate.
I didn’t realize you could be so close, I guess at times you just seemed like the man that lived inside my computer. –
Sherlock released him, causing John to awkwardly drop to his feet with a little ‘oof.’ He was out the door soon enough, dressed a bit better for the weather. John couldn’t help but to think that he really shouldn’t have let him go.
John went to place the beaker back where it had been when Sherlock suddenly jolted up pushing the table away from him. John lost his grip as the table hit his still partially limping leg sending him into a fit of pain. The beaker shattered on the table as John instinctively grabbed the edge to balance himself, cutting his hand on a glass shard.
Sherlock silently followed. Perhaps it was his eternal fate to follow the man he had left behind?
Molly’s eyes briefly flicked to the skull on the mantle. John only rolled his eyes, “The skull has never been a problem before, I promise.” He cleared his throat again, looking in the general direction of the knocking. “If… if that’s really you Sherlock, can you prove it to us?”
John? -
The D.I. hated how strangely turned on that made him. But he wasn’t going to give in. He needed to know that he was more then just this perverted monster he had suddenly become, because the real Mycroft sure as hell would never had said anything remotely like that. “ ‘Croft?” He did his best to speak softly, hoping Mycroft would think he was being submissive.
“You have questions I’m sure. You can ask you know, you deserve an explanation.”
as they say. “
Molly accidentally let out a gasp when she read what it said. "Sorry… I uh, I didn't mean to look." Her face was completely flush as she turned to the microscope fumbling with a slide she was putting in.
“More or less.” He pocketed his phone from where he left it on the bed. He had to get out of this mindset of expecting Sherlock to be around every corner. “Brought the supplies?”
They both played well into the night, far later then they had initially planned.
He looked up the gnawed out hole that led back to the counter. He easily fit in the hole, but lacking the physical capabilities of a rat he could see no way to climb out.
“Tell me you at least know what that means?”
“He was right…”
Maria began to type and quickly hit send. The incriminating chirp of John’s phone was closer then even she would have suspected.
“Sherlock! I mean it!” John cursed at his body.
“You’re asleep, I can’t possibly eat anything you attempt to cook.” Sherlock tossed the newspaper aside, scooting his chair back as he put his feet on the table.
That night he couldn’t seem to get the black nail polish off, he didn’t want to have to explain his life style experiment at work so he headed off to Tesco’s for nail polish remover.
Their parting wasn’t a particularly pleasant one.
Sherlock huffed in annoyance. “It’s a military grade transmutation compound. It’s just going to heighten your senses, agility, possibly strength too. See? Not that bad.”
He knew he was just grasping at straws now.
“I can’t believe you would fall for Lestrade of all people.” Sherlock sighed and fell onto the couch with a small ‘thud.’
“This is definitely the same killer, just more ambitious. Could be because the victim fought back first, or maybe the killer is taking things up a notch. It’s not enough to just kill them now. The next victim will be in worse shape.”
There was something suddenly different about the flat. As if the lights were now a bit brighter, but that wasn’t quite it. A heaviness that was there only a moment ago had lifted.
John was drenched and already starting to shed himself of his soaking rain coat. He was glad that Sherlock was still in the living room and not hiding away. Lestrade had actually made him rather worried.
Would you mind texting me until then? –SH
“Maybe a bit…”
:3 Hi. Don't hate me...
“You’ll steal him from me!” he spat.
Sherlock looked down with what looked like guilt on his face. "John I… I'm very sorry about this. I did tell you to be careful with that beaker."
That’s not one of those not good things is it? –SH
The third day John had fleas.
“I wouldn’t even really know what to do with something like that-“ John’s mind screamed to just stop talking before he made a greater fool of himself.
“What? How the hell could you-?” Lestrade was stumped for an explanation yet again.
“Holy Shit!” An older teen had started down the aisle and now came over quickly, “He break his arm?”
"Sure, what should I tell her if she asks why?" Lestrade was beginning to feel more like a nuisance then that he was helping, but he also couldn't just leave the sociopath.
“What are you-“
Sherlock knew he couldn’t hear him; that John was essentially talking to himself. “It was for you John… I was trying to save you. Lestrade and Hudson too.” His heart ached deeply for him, he didn’t think John would be this distraught over his death, why had he ever thought that?
John collapsed onto the bed, completely spent. He pulled the device out, knowing Sherlock was either mocking him or toying with him now.
Hypnosis
“That’s yet to be seen.” He brought the doctor back closer to him to continue the kiss and felt himself smiling against the surprisingly soft lips.
he told himself.The green image of a little camcorders popped up on John’s screen, he smiled to himself knowing he was finally going to be able to see his friend.
The word repeated in his mind. He liked jam. This wouldn’t be so bad, he was just going to do a few simple things and then Sherlock would reward him for being good.
“Shh, it will all be over soon.”
“I don’t want to have to beg you every time I ask you to do what you already promised.”
“My inhibitions are not
After that he tried to move on.
In which John reconsiders his position if only momentarily.
A chirp came from John’s pocket. He was suppose to have his cell off during therapy sessions but he often forgot to do so. His therapist looked disapprovingly again.
"Very funny." John was not amused, "He's working on an antidote."
"Were they?" Sherlock seemed puzzled for a moment. "You already contacted the families then?"
Something fluttered just beneath Sherlock’s shirt, rippling the fabric under the water. John had barely caught the movement from the edge of his vision. He let his hand dip below the surface and hovered just above the material.
“Very good, not bring it closer to the edge.”
“Yea, sorry bout that, I should go check on forensics.” Lestrade turned to leave for the other room but stopped when he heard a bemused laugh.
Chapter 3
Maria hummed, “I’m a tad mad at him at the moment you could say, but I picked him specially.”
“No.” John put his hand on the side of Sherlock’s face the detective to look at him. “You have emotions Sherlock, I’ve seen them. You care about Lestrade, even Mycroft although you wont admit it. Mrs. Hudson is like a mother to you! I see the way you look at her and how you give her special treatment, the way you seek her acceptance despite driving her mad.”
“Yes…” the baritone was uneasy “Tomorrow…”
It was late, a bit too late to start a new raid that would likely take hours of play, but John still had a good half hour still in him before he could sleep.
“Oh. So you don’t believe in hypnotism then?” If he was lucky he could talk the detective out of this idea.
“The gym. Then I came home and took a shower.”
John finally managed to catch his breath, seeing that he was dry and out of harms way now. “I was drowning.” It still seemed so impossibly real.
“I thought he hated that hat with a passion.” Lestrade attempted to break the ice with John after their last chat hadn’t ended so well.
Dull."
Leastrade pulled his coat a bit closer around him, “Sort of chilly in here, isn’t it.”
Sherlock didn't look up, he was too focused on his hands in his lap and doing his best not to show any emotion. Internally he thought he might cry at any moment.
“John? Are you alright? You haven’t told me I’m brilliant even once today.”
John met his lips with a feather light kiss, then dropped to the pale neck continuing his light kissing, then began unbuttoning Sherlock's shirt and kissing his chest. "Do you want this Lock?"
Sherlock stared quizzically.
“Red.”
“What?”
Donovan and Anderson strolled in suspiciously too close in time to one another. Sherlock could smell their matching tropical scent shampoo, not the brand Anderson's wife uses he mentally noted.
“He’s not at that morgue. I guess no one really asked but he was transferred somewhere else.”
“Of course John.” He pecked the sandy graying hair below his face.
“I rather not talk about it is all.”
Before John could say either way Angelo himself came out to sit them at their regular table in the window seat. “Ah you two! Here again! Let me just get a candle for the table.”
“Went well then?”
"Actually! I believe he left his phone here today. You know John, always so forgetful."
“You three want something from me?” Maybe he was better off going to prison, you didn’t have to sell your dignity by going to job interviews that way, either way, he had no restraints about ending this man.
But Greg knew that Sherlock wasn’t someone who put a lot of importance in frivolous things and was certainly not the sort to want flowers at his grave. He wanted to honor his friend, but there seemed to be few ways how. Perhaps continuing his work, but as a DI, he was already obligated to solve crimes. Sherlock didn’t much care for the media or if his name had been smeared either, so that seemed like a wasted effort. But there was something, or rather, some one, he cared very deeply for indeed. And John cared just as much for him as well.
Moran’s only experience in life was to kill, he had been trained to kill and found not only was he very good at it, but in fact liked it. This wasn’t however something you could put on your resume for a desk job, and working such a job would likely be the death of him.
“You’re the only bloke I’ve ever fancied. I may be Holmesexual.” John smiled wryly.
“Is something wrong?” John asked a bit concerned.
“There is absolutely no merit to your ridiculous claim and you can’t keep me here.” Sherlock practically spat.
He needed to go back there and see what had happened. Sherlock marched off for the door, but his hand went straight through the door handle. He sighed, that hadn’t happened the first time he tried it this morning, which gave him a sudden pause. He had opened the door earlier… using what he had to assume was an imaginary key now since it didn’t have a real one. He had unlocked and opened the door with his mind, not by going through the physical motions like he would have if he was still in a body. He tried the door handle again but still couldn’t hold onto it. This was definitely something he would have to try again. Then there was John, he seemed to hear him calling his name this morning, said he heard what sounded like Sherlock whisper on the other end of the phone yesterday. There was still a way he could contact John then, tell him he was… well, ‘ok’ was probably an over statement, he was technically dead after all. But he could contact him again, try to get him out of the mourning fit he was in possibly.
John nodded and headed back to the living room and plopped down in front of his laptop. Maybe a movie would help. “You are there, right?” He whispered to the near by violin.
Moriarty came around the corner brandishing his gun with a cocky smile. He waited patiently in the space the door would cover once it opened. The door opened a small crack at first, the intruder testing the waters. Cautiously, Sherlock stepped into view. John’s eyes widened in panic, he knew his voice was too small for Sherlock to hear from that distance. Banging his fist against the glass only produced a small ‘ping.’
He squirmed at the un-comfortableness, not sure what was happening to him at all. Two tentacle tips swirled around those slickening inner thighs teasingly as Mycroft’s tongue flicked out over his lower lip.
Sherlock looked around for something to do, but settled on knocking once on the table. Molly immediately ran to John’s side.
“No, I will not let you hide in there again.”
“He took one look at my chair and left.” Sherlock took in a sharp breath. “He later texted me that I was broken goods and was no longer useful.”
“You care entirely too much about what others think of you.”
Get back here. –JM
Sherlock stood up from his seat abruptly and headed for the door.
"John, John! Wake up, we're here." Sherlock whispered into his coat pocket.
John let out a sigh “What did she bring- Sherlock? Why are you making that face?” he wasn’t sure how he could describe Sherlock’s face at that moment other then a combination of embarrassed bewilderment combined with sarcastic amusement.
“Excuse me?!”
‘It was more then just that.’ The voice came again, almost as though it knew that Sherlock had quickly replayed the memory. ‘There must have been other times.’
“Just one more night.” John felt so strangely welcomed in this room now. He thought staying in it would scare him before; remind him of what he lost. But John felt so surrounded by his friend’s presence, it was well worth the cold. He slipped into the sheets, trying his best not to shiver.
“Its… not weird? I really don’t want to impose-“
Sherlock’s smile only widened. “Awfully forward thinking there. Or when you said
Wordlessly John got up as if he had never complained about being tired and began making tea for two.
“You’re a shit roommate.”
“Ha, as if.” Somehow he could no longer bring himself to be mad at the situation though. “Case today?”
John’s phone chimed in his pocket. He awkwardly pulled it out, shifting the pastries to one arm to check his texts.
Sherlock’s eyes slid away again and already John felt like the detective was retreating into isolation.
John chuckled as Sherlock walked off to get a better look, “Show off. He only says things like that when he’s trying to impress me.” He smiled fondly.
“Moran you idiot!” he kicked at his phone, to stubborn even in private to show that it had actually hurt his foot. He was five and half inches tall, naked, and alone. Perhaps not his best of moments.
"Mhmm?"
-Same here
"I was going to say, I want you to be my boyfriend..." He blushed.
“Well you’ve been faking too.”
“You’re his only friend? How can you tell?”
“I’ll get the hang of this eventually.”
“I can tell you don’t want to leave me in the flat alone, and I can’t blame ya.”
"All done."
Sherlock glanced back down at the phone for a moment. The memory of his incident at Uni in the forefront of his mind now. “Hm? Oh… nothing. He’s just… nothing.”
“Well actually there’s a very interesting one involving twins- it’s been pretty hard so far, no leads.” He wasn’t expecting John’s reply.
“Can I come?”
“Are there more?” John remained on the floor and looked up hopefully.
Ok, that was fair. But it didn’t really explain everything. “But, you worry about him when he doesn’t speak to you? Enough that you’re binge eating?”
“That notebook could be an important clue.”
“Any taller and that bullet would have hit you in the heart.”
“Well, I’m not. He can get stuffed for all I care- the way he came in here yesterday.”
"Poisoned. The killer must have had a sharp objected dipped in very potent poison, spied their targets- or it was a random killing, and scratched them with it. The poison was relatively fast acting, but still gave the perp enough time to get away unnoticed."
“Right,” Lestrade kept his hand firmly on him. He believed that John might not want to return to his own flat where there were countless items to remind him of their late friend.  “If-” he nervously licked his lower lip, “if there’s anything you need, even from your flat, I’ll be happy to grab it for you.”
“I thought that was witches?” Lestrade was pretty sure there was a movie that mentioned that, which sounded just as absurd.
“Conduit…” John repeated whatever that strange voice had said. “You need a conduit.” That was one of those pseudo science terms he had heard online while researching.
“Make yourself at home, why don’t you?” John tisked, annoyed that Mycroft thought he could just summon them back whenever he desired and come in uninvited.
“Surprisingly simple actually. I’m not really invisible- I’m simply bending all the light hitting me around my body.”
It was almost impossible to deduce that the dead man’s gardener had murdered him due to the affair he was having with both his wife and the wife’s stepdaughter due to the atrocious amount of whispering taking place in the crime scene.
“Shit… right.” He put the phone in his pocket and considered what to do. He really did need Sherlock for this case.
John finished his cup and put it in the sink.
Moriarty sat dumbstruck in the pool of clothing looking up at the giant phone screen. Sebastian always answered, it made no difference if he was having one of his ridiculous ‘moments’ or not.
"He must be here!" His eyes darted around the kitchen. He knew he had placed John on the counter, but for a moment he started to doubt himself. '
"John, what do you think?"
"With the amount of money you would be saving you really wouldn't need to work anymore…"
Sherlock goes quiet for a moment, John was having nightmares again, possibly due to him.
"No, there's something more here. I'm just not sure what yet."
“ ‘M sorry kitty. Was mad bout you being bad cat. But you’s not bad cat, you’s very good kitty.” John tried stroking the black silken ears much to Sherlock’s annoyance.
Chapter 5
"Hit the deck!"
Dear readers, I am tremendously sorry for never updating this story. I stopped writing all of my Sherlock fanfiction and this particular story was the absolute hardest to come back to. In real life, a very dear friend of mine took his own life after I last posted. For this reason, I could not bear to think about this story for some time. It has been years since I have written and I fear it will not be the same or even as good as before. I hope that I can give this story and others the closure that they need, though. I am very sorry for the sudden hiatus with no explanation.
"What? No, bloody hell Sherlock-"
Sherlock hastily grabbed the skull from the stunned Maria with genuine concern for it.  “I told you to be careful with that.” He muttered.
“You could be my stuffed little whore.” Mycroft gently pushed on Greg’s stomach with his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
“God damn it Sherlock, you’ve paralyzed me!”
“You have company?” He didn’t wait to find out as he walked towards the sound. It seemed the tele had come on by its self.
“The wounds appear to all be of different varieties though. Some deep, others shallow. Most are right handed, but a few were made with a left hand. There were multiple attackers.”
He had a point. “Fine, come on, lets go. I’m sorry, but there was no word on who the body was or what even happened. I don’t know if your friend is ok or not.” The two quickly went out side to hail cab.
“I- I’m sorry about that Lock.” John’s voice seemed distant, Sherlock had just barely caught the words.
John started feeling slightly drowsy again but remained upwards. He barely noticed Sherlock taking his arm and lifting it up, slowly turning it over.
“I really should have had you wear looser pants before the last experiment.” He pushed John back onto the bed and began undoing the zipper.
“Listen, what on earth you could see in Mycroft of all people, is beyond me. But you both deserve to be happy. Maybe its not,” he tried to think of a good way to word it, “Like other relationships. But maybe he just needs a push? He’s the one that’s been asking you to go places after all. He must see something in you.”
"John, he's… Mycroft thinks he might have found who has him."
Maria narrowed her eyes, it made no sense, the sound seemed to have come from the mantle. She stepped closer to it. Her mouth curved down until she realized she could simply send another text, quickly sending ‘send’ again. There was no noise this time,
John had already figured out this was the sign that Sherlock was moving and wanted to take John with him. "Where are we going?"
“You and his damned flatmate.”
John’s eyebrows furrowed. “What?”
“I must insist you leave this instant-“ Sherlock tried trailing after the woman heading straight for John’s room. She grabbed the door handle and pulled with great force revealing the relatively empty room behind it. “He’s not here.” She wasn’t sure if she had expected him to be there or not.
But Lestrade had anticipated it and leap out of the way, almost not making it. He stumbled through the dark room in an attempt to find his way back to the front door.
“John… what’s after us then?”
Sherlock outwardly abhorred being called ''Lock', but secretly smiled to himself whenever John did.
"Yes, some sort of antidote."
“Oh Lock, you were not meant to live like this. Come here.” John picked him up by the waist and dusted some of the dirt off his coat.
“I love you John.”
“Oh God!” John hit his prostate dead on, it was almost enough to make him cum but he held back, not wanting to finish so soon. “Fuck…” he slowed down a bit, it was time to see what this toy could really do. John swallowed thickly, glad that his desk and computer were close enough so that he only needed to lean over to press ‘play.’ It didn’t matter too much what song he picked, only the actual beat mattered, control the sensation inside of him. He had hit a random song, The Cloud Atlas Symphony, John wasn’t even sure when or why he had downloaded it. The results were instant. The toy inside him began vibrating, slowly at first but it built up and intensified so powerfully. He was sure he had never played the song before but somehow it was eerily familiar to him, comforting in a way he had never known.
John took in a deep breath, perhaps he use this to his advantage. "Sir, as you can see I'm really just a regular person and if you would please take me back to my flat-"
Sherlock’s hands were shaking as he lifted the shirt, making sure John wasn’t looking. His skin looked slashed to ribbons on his side. He carefully ran his fingers over the 3 slits. They merely fluttered at the touch. There was no pain. There were three more on the other side.
“Go right ahead.” Greg pulled up a second chair and sat beside him, watching as he entered a series of passwords in his email and a list of locations came up.
I would have to ask my sod of a brother and he would of course complain I could just use a blanket. –
Sherlock beamed. "Twelve centimeters!"
Sherlock held John in his palms the whole car ride back to their flat, never taking his eyes off him. John sat quietly drawing invisible circles with his finger in the giant hands, occasionally looking up to see green grey eyes watching his every movement.
“Hello? John? You there?” A deep baritone came from his computer.
John felt dirty. It wasn’t fair that he was alive wasting oxygen when Sherlock had truly contributed to the world. He should be the one buried, not Sherlock. Making a fake ruse to make people believe he was ‘better’ was like betraying that genius’s memory.
Never go for walks? They can be nice, assuming the sky isn’t pouring. –
I’m just going to answer it for you if you don’t. –
Molly nodded, it sounded like something Sherlock would do. “I’ve seen things in the morgue before, not Sherlock, just… sometimes late at night in there, I’ll hear people, doors will open, that sort of thing. I… I believe you John.”
You’re a bastard, you know that? –
Once Maria and the woman that accompanied her were just outside the small gate of the outdoor café, headed south via leisurely stroll, Molly stood, following them quietly.
“You damn tosser, that’s why you ripped the bloody couch up? Because you took it again? Just why? You nearly had a heart attack when you first saw those ears.”
* * *
He recalled the way Sherlock had clamed up when John mentioned his therapist, the small muttering of ‘sounds like mine’ when he told him how Ella said he need to get out more.
“They seemed pretty low when you begged me to scratch you.”
“Sleeping well?” Lestrade wanted to catch him off guard.
“I’ve decided that’s all I want out of life, more or less. That’s what I plan to do from now on.”
“I promise.”
“I know…”
“Hm? John?” Sherlock looked up with a brief look of confusion on his face, “Ah, can you move yet? I’ll need to write down…” his voice trailed off as he went to reach his notebook.
Sherlock took an unlabeled container of pills and dropped one in John’s tea.
Sherlock merely pushed past him, gently shoving John a bit as he walked back out.
"Hold on a moment, I thought I saw…" Lestrade stride towards the skull as John cowered behind it. He considered running for it if the skull was lifted, but when Lestrade picked it up, John was froze stiff. The DI's eyes widened tremendously. "John!?"
“Ready?” John could feel Sherlock nod his head against his back. John pulled on the collar but the cat didn’t move.
Sherlock wanted to run after him, but he knew if he had he would likely miss his chance to find John. He turned back towards the flat, eyes furiously scanning the room mid earth quake.
“Mind looking in the fridge for something? We uh, haven’t stopped for food yet.”
“That’s enough!” John gritted his teeth and turned even redder.
“Three out four experiments have led to you in my bed now.”
He was peering at his hands, being pulled from his memory for a moment. He wasn’t sure where that thing on Mycroft had appeared from, let alone that voice that evidently only he could hear. He could almost hear its strange reverberations still as he sank onto the couch. The door of the flat opened and shut with a heavy thud, but he didn’t turn to look. Obviously it was John with his file.
“You’re not sorry for coming home late and drunk?” Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
Chapter 8
The only problem was that he wasn’t quite sure how he was draining the heat exactly. He ran his hand up the lamp, the light beginning to flicker a bit. Sherlock gripped the metal just below the light bulb hard; the light gave a few death throws before going completely black.
John’s eyes widened. “No you bloody wont! I did not agree to that!”
John woke as sunlight began to filter into Sherlock’s room. He hadn’t had a chance to shower the day before since Sherlock’s impromptu experiment had caught him off guard. The bed was so much softer then his own he almost stayed. To his horror, when he tried to get up he still couldn’t move.
“MYCROFT! Please!” Lestrade yelped out as a last effort.
“Didn’t even look to see who was at the door? Now that’s just rude.” Moriarty grinned. “Uh-ah, sit back down Sherlock, did you really think I wouldn’t bring a gun?”
Greg was taken aback, Mycroft’s eyes seemed red and slightly glossy.
“Oh I know, that’s why I got killer bees. Well, Sebbie and I are off. Have fun now. Oh, and once the bees are released the house will go up in flames regardless of whether one of the spiders gets your little pet or not.”
“Shit, you scared the life out of me.” John panted, trying to catch his breath. “Here, drink this.” He leaned down beside Sherlock, a new glass of water in hand.
Maria grabbed the grinning skull up immediately, nearly dropping it a second after in shock.
"Do be careful with that." Sherlock said in his baritone voice without looking up at him.
“Bloody hell… what did I just do?” John pulled out his cell phone, momentarily thinking of making an emergency appointment with his old therapist. But she would only prescribe medication, and he wasn’t convinced that was what he needed.
John crossed his arms in his sitting position as he watched Sherlock pace, “I dunno Greg, I rather we didn’t have to confront her too.”
“I’m fine,” he panted. “Fine. Just a bit dry in here.”
“I should have told Greg to grab something of yours. Your scarf or anything.” He would be here soon at least and know something was wrong when John didn’t answer the door. At least he knew help was coming.
John didn’t want to tell his therapist Sherlock’s final words. They were too personal. Only he was meant to hear them. John knew Ella would try to convince him of the ‘truth’. That Sherlock himself had tried to tell him he was a fraud. He wouldn’t hear it. No one could ever convince him that Sherlock had told him a lie, not even the man himself. No, there was no need to tell Ella.
“Not you, him.”
"What's-"
“God, I almost forgot about that.”
Sherlock leaned uncomfortably close to John’s face. The shorter man was to stiff with surprise to lean back away from the sociopath.
No, John, you don’t understand. I wasn’t thinking right, please do this for me, and do not open it. –SH
John had always wondered what the final straw would be. On his first night knowing his slightly deranged flatmate, he had shot and killed a man for him. His first date since getting use to civilian life had been hijacked as they were kidnapped by a gang of assassins- also Sherlock’s fault. He had a bomb strapped to him, constant gay remarks were made to and about him, he was drugged against his will while locked in a lab, and now this. He sat naked on the floor of a dog kennel with nothing but a sheet.
“There’s a fucking ghost, get out of here!” he could feel his face already swelling as he stood and made a wild dash to run down the ally followed by his accomplices.
Mrs. Hudson: No wonder you don’t want me bringing soup up! Have fun now!
John woke early, frantically showering and thinking about what would happen today. He stood under the hot spray of water far longer then he had planned on. What if Sherlock didn’t like him when they met? That he wasn’t the person Sherlock thought he was? He had been getting a strange sinking feeling for a while now that there was something Sherlock had been hiding from him, though he couldn’t think of what it was. Why was he seeing a therapist? There was nothing wrong with that of course, but people didn’t see one for no reason at all. Sherlock had a secret, and John so desperately wanted to know what it was, to tell him that whatever he thought was wrong probably wasn’t and alleviate some of his concerns. But he wasn’t sure if he could, whether it really was a big deal or not. The very thought of what Sherlock might be hiding was starting to eat away at him slowly.
There was Lestrade, right there, in the club, only a few meters away. He did the only thing he could think of and made a run for it, he hadn’t expected Lestrade to try to follow him. Had he seen him? Did he know? It was unlikely.
John’s phone laid partially smashed next to him, Sherlock grabbed it before ducking down by his side and putting a cautious hand on his good arm.
I do this for the lols guys.
“Ah, good, Lestrade, tell me you have a case, anything.”
“Get the hell away from him!” Sherlock’s voice was loud and booming, filled with fury.
Chapter 2
"I really can't say." Sherlock's voice grew more bemused.
But instead, all of his tentacles tensed at once, especially the one in Greg’s mouth before releasing its self inside of him. Greg now thrashed at full force against him as liquid poured into him from the tentacle tip, filling his mouth with something sickeningly sweet. He grabbed at the base of the tentacle again, trying to pull it out. But Mycroft looked as though he no longer cared as his other tentacles gyrated around him, gently caressing Greg’s whole form.
He hated when he had thoughts like this. He looked at Sherlock giving his best ‘annoyed face.’ Sherlock’s eyes softened.
“Bloody hell, where are you?”
“Just tell me where you’ve been going so I know you’re ok at least.”
“Oh… “ She set the phone down, smiling at the house keeper, “I think that will be all for now, thank you for your patience.
Whatever it is, it’s ok. Maybe you can tell me in person? –
“It’s like the body just appeared out of thin air!”
He had enough, John was obviously uncomfortable and he didn’t want fleas in his flat either. “This is for your own good!” Sherlock forced him into a small carrier and took a cab to Molly’s house. ‘
“John- would you-“
“Plug it in and open a music file.”
________________________________________
“You’ll come tomorrow right? To the case?” John was no longer touching the planchette, but it slowly made it’s way to the ‘Yes.’
John tried to force the water back in his eyes, “You git. You ruined your career you realize.” He pulled away to look into the eyes he could finally take in all at once.
“I do not imply that at every chance John.” He turned to see John’s bright brown eyes peering deeply into his.
A slow creaking came from behind him. Sherlock’s head immediately shot over to it. The closet door had come open again.
John’s eyes snapped open, for a brief second he could have sworn he saw Sherlock leaning over him with a worried expression. But with the blink of his eyes the image was gone and he was alone in the flat once more. He pulled a pillow close to his chest and gripped it tightly as he buried his face into it. In public he had tried so hard to look like he was trying to move on, tried so hard to keep himself together. But with no one around there was no reason to pretend and he cried freely into Sherlock’s pillow.
John stumbled back up the steps of 221b with Lestrade supporting him. “At least now I know you’re a light weight for next time.”
Lestrade was already half way through a donut when John looked up at him.
John wrapped his digits around the slender, milky white cylinder. It was very simplistic in appearance, but the moment he touched it he could tell the interior was not merely plastic, it had a strange combination of feeling organic as well as mechanical. “It’s a vibrator? But there’s no controls?”
John was beginning to see the perks of being small. He could hide in Sherlock's pocket all day without having to put up with people like Donovan and Anderson, food was in vast abundance, he was off work 'sick', and for once he had Sherlock's complete and undivided attention. In the past two days the detective hadn't been to his mind palace once. It's not that the doctor wanted Sherlock to be so hyper focused about him, but it was a nice change of pace from being ignored days on end while Sherlock was trapped in his mind.
Really John, such strong words. It’s not my fault you felt it was fine to use an usb sex toy while idling on skype after all. –
“I’m glad he liked them. I hope you do too. They would go nicely with that dress you wore to the Christmas party last year.” Unknown Sender.
How could he tell them what he couldn’t even tell Ella? What he could barely admit to himself? And forever suffer the knowledge that it was too late to tell Sherlock.
An rc boat sat bobbing up and down in the water. John approached the control and lightly pushed a lever, the boat moved, stopping only when John let go of the lever.
John smiled and clicked the accept button, not sure how messaging on Skype was really all that better then the in game system. No sooner then he did that a small window popped up on his screen with a small green phone and a camera with a strike through it. Not entirely sure what it was he clicked the green phone.
“There’s a dead cat out back, looks like it was stabbed. Think it’s connected?”
“Well I’ve muddled up the results I can see.” He stroked the tabby’s head and John leaned closer to nuzzle him. Sherlock picked the cat up and sat on the couch with it. “What am I going to do with you?”
“Red looks good on you. Uh, those there, the pumps, would be lovely on you.” He looked away and did his best to be nonchalant.
“Well if he did, he did it in the buff.” Mycroft picked up the rest of the clothes, noticing it made a full outfit.
“Erm, yes, I mean, of course.” His finger flipped a button on the side of his phone that made it go silent just in case. His suspicion was confirmed when the screen lit up in a few seconds. Another text. John’s eyes naturally gravitated down to the phone.
John huffed and looked away, that gaze always made him so nervous. “Not exactly.”
John smiled. He wasn’t sure how much of his plan the detective had worked out yet, but knowing he was slightly more at ease lightened his step a bit. He was a soldier damn it, and he sure as hell wasn’t going to die without a fight.
“Well hello there,” the cupid’s bow lips curled up, “John.”
Lestrade brought a flashlight he had happened to have in his back pocket and shown it down the hole.
It was very warm and cozy in the detective's pocket and when John leaned his weight against Sherlock's chest he could hear the thumping of his heart. The taxi ride to the crime scene was filled with Lestrade's questions to Sherlock over what he had planned to do with John.
“It’s fine John.” Sherlock’s voice sounded slightly off. “She’ll forgive you.” His gaze was suddenly distant,
“So, what’s the plan?” Greg draped his coat over a chair. “Sitting back and waiting if our culprit shows up? Or something more hands on?”
It was just past midnight when John decided to turn the telly off and bid his flatmate goodnight. Sherlock often stayed up into the wee hours of the evening working on various experiments, John gave up learning what they all were. He didn't mind so long as Sherlock didn't blow anything up, although the body parts in the fridge often enraged him as well.
“Bored!”
“What?” Lestrade watched John carefully, it almost appeared he had been quietly listening for the answers to come.
The uneasiness in Sherlock’s face was easily readable now, “Only if you promise I can continue to experiment on you.”
“That’s fantastic! You’ll have to tell me all about him when it’s over!” She beamed, all of the stress instantly released out of John’s shoulders and he found he was grinning ear to ear.
It’s the middle of the night –Molly
“I am really uncomfortable with you doing this right now.” John couldn’t muster his stern voice anymore with those milky white hands so close to his crotch. He nearly yelped when Sherlock yanked them off and threw them to where his shirt also lay unceremoniously.
Hands sliding away, the detective planted one more kiss on his doctor before lifting himself out of the pocket. “I need to be closer.”
No, it’s not that. Just, please John. Do this for me? Don’t push it. Please. –
“You really have a way of twisting things!”
John stood frozen as the man let himself out, leaving the box for further evidence collecting.
Lestrade cleared his throat. “Not entirely sure… but mostly me I’m afraid.”
“Bored.”
“I’m not falling for the ‘you give me absolutely no information before hand scam’ again. You will tell me exactly what this is suppose to do to me before I take it.”
There was a pregnant pause.
Molly shot him a peculiar half smiling look.
Sally cocked her head to the side. “Need help?” She shifted her weight slightly.
Sherlock’s laughter died out, “What do you mean?”
Sherlock quickly grabbed at it and tore into the cases files."
‘Pardon?’ –MH
“I’m not gay! I’ve even flirted with women who asked me if I’m your boyfriend. How do you think that makes me feel? Not to mention the looks I’ve been getting from men the past few months.”
“I would like him now.” It was a command not a request.
“Faking.”
“Don’t forget to include a measuring tape for size and distance relationship.” A baritone from behind him said.
"No, no, I meant…" The D.I.'s voice was barely above a whisper. "John?"
“And you have been sitting in this cab quietly and instead of thinking of your date tonight with a woman you have been thinking of men
I do, but I can’t use it. -
"No! No, no no no no, damn it Lestrade why was I so blind?" Sherlock put his hands to either side of his temples in frustration.
“I’m not even talking.” He looked up, surprised to see his boss was no longer smiling. “What’s happening?”
Sherlock thinks of what to say, he know he’s about to give his friend the shock of his life, “John- I… I’m really sorry about this, I thought you would come home sooner but-“
“Hello?”
“Of course not, I use my brain.” Sherlock stood back on the tips of his toes against the pocket seam to look out, he could see the lake just a few feet away and… something else… Lestrade was just standing outside discussing the crime scene with someone on the police force, he was mere inches from an outdoor table and chairs. “John, lift me up a bit?”
At those words, Sherlock desperately tried reaching the glass. John had the foresight to pull it away before Sherlock broke that one as well. He must be exceptionally out of it, he figured.
“Online courses.” Sherlock kept to his usual monotone voice.
Right, you mentioned you don’t go out much. –
John awoke to a rather pleased looking Sherlock, somehow this situation screamed ‘not good.’ He cleared his throat nervously. “Well?”
John hissed and scratch Sherlock’s arm.
“Put us?”
“There, all better.”
He sighed. "Text me when you find out more?" he didn't want to admit how exhausted he was from spending the whole night at the station.
Anderson stood two meters away from the body taking pictures of a purse spread open with contents flung across the grass. It had obviously fallen from the victim’s shoulder as she fled her attacker.
“She was ok, but you’re the one that told me to… oh lord not this again.”
Intoxicated
“Yea, just solve crimes, not show up here insulting everyone right and left, reading who’s having an affair with who on the force and… and…. That.” He looked at the offending scarf. “You’re not him John. You have to hold on to who you are.”
“So, she left because you like…”
"You could at least give me a breathing hole and food."
John raised an eyebrow at that, “Which I go to with great frequency, I feel like pointing out.”
Sherlock felt every movement of the fragile yet still strong John in his hand as he caressed his thumb. “Lestrade, we’re going to go inspect Harry’s flat just to make sure no one was keeping tabs on her.” Greg nodded in agreement of the plan. He refocused his gaze on the man in his palm “Mhm, the things I would do to right now if you were big enough little soldier mine.”
No one outside of Sherlock would understand these two items and what they meant, John realized. It didn’t matter. John was beyond what ordinary people thought now.
Mrs Hudson: I really don’t mind and I must insist. But just this once, I’m not your cook after all.
"And just who is this mystery person?"
Molly furrowed her brow while watching John in an apparent daze wander about the kitchen with a strange sort of consistency. “What did people online suggest?”
"And her orientation?"
He waits in Mrs. Hudson’s flat, she’s bound to come back eventually. Before he knows what’s happening though, he wakes to find he’d been kipping on her couch.
“Please stay John.”
“So thick.” Greg groaned, when it suddenly felt so much bigger then before.
“Why should Lestrade care what Mycroft wastes his time with?”
“Well I don’t enjoy being inspected so closely.”
“I have to wait for it to be in full effect first.” He wiggled his way out of the suit, not sure if he was madder about the size change or his west-wood laying crumpled on the floor. A grin found its way across his features as he looked up at the impossibly tall sniper. “Probably enjoying this aren’t you, you’re so pathetic.”
"You will never satisfy my Greg. You are far too fat, old, and your hair… he can do far better then you."
“Yes, well, I have to know that I will get my money.” He narrowed his eyes.
“Bloody idiot.” John muttered under his breath. “Sorry I couldn’t be of much help Greg,” he called back “but I should probably go back to the flat now and make sure Sherlock hasn’t torn the place up too much.” He faked a smile.
For the briefest of moments John’s eyes wandered over the webpage, pupils growing larger, Sherlock too it in as his smile deepened into something else. “No- I don’t um…”
Harry's smile suddenly turned to a slightly more seductive angle, "You know where my dear
“Tomorrow?” John was hopeful
“John… you have a purpose, you have to keep living.” Sherlock felt worse then dead, he felt broken. He realized for the first time that people don’t live for the sake of living, they live for those close to them. “You’re a doctor, you save lives. That’s a far better purpose then some people serve.”
“Oh my god it’s raining! Sherlock, what the hell are we going to do now?”
John sighed, why did they both have to be so headstrong? "Aha." He spied his cell phone on the other side of the counter just beyond some dishes that needed washing, Sherlock was truly lost without John cleaning up around the flat. '
“There’s plenty more spiders, don’t worry.”
Sherlock took a look for him self and frowned. "We'll have to go through the floor boards."
The Blog of John Watson
Sherlock hadn’t actually planned this one out very well, it was more of a spur of the moment experiment. He would need to get John to do something he wouldn’t normally do to prove whether it was possible or not, but with the added criteria that it couldn’t be anything that would make John mad at him later. Complication.
“Oh, it’s fine, really-“ he tentatively lifted the lid curious what it was and knowing Molly had never seen him outside of dressing and acting strictly male.
“Yup, we’re going for Chinese tonight.”
“That’s… god, that’s awful. How did the accident happen?”
“What’s that?” Sherlock idly played with his fork, he didn’t actually want to eat, but it meant John was paying attention to him.
John had seen the shadow creep out from the open doorway just behind her first, “No!”
“Er, what is it?”
“The other girls- they didn’t go missing first- they were killed instantly.”
John thought in relief.
“Oh, well, it has been a bit of time since the last one I suppose.” His eyes now seem distant.
“I don’t suppose it’s my business, but why exactly is he lacking in size?”
“No time, bring it to me.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. Why was everyone so dense? He gently kicked at the case, which fell forward.
“We wont be long.” He mostly against the rock wall separating the property from the next and drawing closer to the lake.
But you can do them to me.”
“The Bella-Rouge?”
Lestrade put his mug down at the corner of the table, but John was still lost for words.
“Oh this will be so much fun! Really we should have thought of this earlier.”
Sherlock looked down at the floor again, “I have extremely limited mobility, I cant stand or pull myself into the chair without someone picking me up.”
“You’re not in game.”
At first Lestrade thought he was just lonely and wanted to know if he was up to anything, so he happily obliged.
people act and react around you and you think you should be like them. Act like them. Pretend you’re boring and mundane like them, but you’re not. You don’t care about things that other people care about because you realize how very unimportant it all is after the war. But everyone seems so sure that they think they know what’s important, and you might have been that way too before, but you’re not now and you don’t understand it. Because you don’t care about these silly unimportant things you second guess your real emotions. You think all your feelings are fake, but they aren’t.”
Not much really. But five feet and an inch, well, I always thought he was on the short side, but he seems a tad bit shorter now.- MH
John looked up at that, hand still on his head. “Lock, your eyes-” They were like before, pupils dilated far too much to be normal.
“I don’t need anyone else in my life right now. I’m… I’m happy as is.” He barely recognized the words coming from his own mouth. He had a string of meaningless relationships when he had first moved in with Sherlock, names and faces that faded in and out of his life. They always seemed so important while he dated them, yet he never mourned the loss of any of them whenever he was dumped- usually for being distant towards them. “And besides, it’s not as if I’ve been living alone for years.” A small smirk was quickly hidden by a fake cough. “or live with a bunch of cats, that sort of thing.”
Mycroft wore a tight smile, barely showing a sign that he had heard him. “I’ll need you to stay here for a while without going out.”
he thought but didn’t manage to say.
“Oh but they’re both here.” She said without thinking and promptly moved her hand to cover her mouth, “Erm, I mean they’re both fine, I saw them.” She had no way of knowing Lestrade and Mycroft both knew of John’s condition.
The next day John once again decided he was done with experiments.
“I’m not haunting the flat, I think I’m… don’t be afraid, but I think I’m haunting you.” Sherlock was a bit nervous by how John would react to that.
Sherlock’s head bowed a bit as he tried to avoid eye contact. “It’s not terribly important is it?”
John nervously licked his lips. “I’ll be right back.” Maybe he could do it quickly enough that Greg wouldn’t notice.
‘A change of clothes would be nice, those will be in the upstairs dresser. A phone charger and my laptop would be nice too, if that’s not too much trouble.’ –JW
John sat crossed legged on the mantle, he had hidden in the gap the jaw provided.
“I can’t believe you. You’re not even listening to me are you?” John slouched back in his chair.
He waited a moment for a reply.
Harry had waited patiently silently laughing at the two until now. "You don't know why he dates?"
“You did this to me.” He sleepily pointed to the ears on his head.
“Y-yes?” John sounds as if he’s been crying since it happened, his voice hoarse and tired now.
“John! Make as little noise as possible! They can’t hear you but they can feel the vibrations of sound and can track you that way.”
John’s eyes widened as he finally caught what Ella was trying to say. A slight blush rose to his face so he looked away trying to appear annoyed. “I am not gay! We have been over this.”
-Couldn’t,-
“Sher- uh, I just have to… you know I have some problems.”
Sherlock smiled lightly, putting his hands back on John’s and then through them.
“Freaks.” Donovan whispered through her teeth.
“Cant they just step over the line of salt?” He was frustrated and defeated. He wanted to believe there was no one there, but a missing rope was evidence.
“John- it’s really not important.” His voice sounded off even to him. Now John had to know what those signs said.
Sherlock sat on the floor and lowered his head. “Why would you do this to me?”
“What’s it look like?”
“You’re bloody brilliant! Kick it’s abdomen!”
Sherlock’s expression dropped and he brought John closer to him, “I know. I don’t either.” He placed a chaste kiss on his doctor’s forehead. “It’s not like… the last one. It’s safe, it’s just until we’re back to normal.”
“Erm, I just mean that I’m a bit on the short side.”
Still in a sleep like state he tried to remember what had happened the night before that would have left him in this position.
The second body was sitting down, torso laid across a table. Her raven black hair hung in curls twisting down her back, her wrist dangled at her side with three brightly colored bracelets on it, and beneath them was another deep scratch.
Mycroft’s eyes darted down, away from Gregory’s as he pretended not to hear him. He hadn’t gained the opportunity to capture someone like this until now and didn’t know all the possible affects yet. A curious tentacle wrapped around the base of Greg’s cock, a sucker sticking to its underside.
Sherlock reached for his notebook and grabbed another biscuit, offering it to John the same way. “Anything feel different now?” he looked at him quizzically.
“Shouldn’t you be somewhere else right now anyway? Off working in that over priced suit of yours or eating cake?”
CW inflation kink, and obviously some good old fashioned tentacle fucking but I dont need to tell you guys that.
Grge wasn’t sure how he should respond. Mycroft was adamant that he made sure John was moving on well, but at the same time he felt the same way. Was it too soon to even think about moving on? Was there even an appropriate wait time?
“Right, of course…” John went to get his jumper and paused again. Maybe he could just tell him he wasn’t up to it. That something had come up at work or he was getting a bit sick and shouldn’t be out in this weather. No, that wouldn’t work at all. Sherlock would of course see right through any lie he came up with and he really didn’t want Sherlock prodding about as to why he didn’t want to go. That brilliant git had to make everything so difficult.
“Lestrade?”
“Hey there! Just calm down alright? I’m sorry, I really am. I forgot… and the package looked just like… um, a different package, one I was expecting.”
“Take my phone, call Mycroft and have him find any and all cameras in this area. I’m going in, we need to know what we’re dealing with before calling The Yard.”
Moran sat down near one of the computers, “I think we’re getting interference.”
He grabbed the support bar just above the bed, pulling himself off and into the chair he so often felt trapped in. Why hadn’t he just told John from the beginning? He thought dismally, wheeling himself to the closet and slowly getting dressed.
Cant. –
“Hardly matters. Clothes are only for warmth and for not being seen, if no one can see me then that point seems rather moot.”
Lestrade raced in, but John was no where to be seen. He cursed himself for not realizing there was a back exit by the changing rooms.
The water had a murky greenish tint to it, the occasional leaf floating by. The small water breaks were just loud enough to muffle a small buzzing sound, but it was still just audible. Four meters away rocking up and down on the waves was a small remote controlled boat. She glanced around, all the other officers had already left this area of the house, only a small handful remained inside. The motor stopped and the boat just swayed lightly in the water near some debris. Donovan narrowed her eyes, it was a plastic bag by the looks of it, something inside weighed it down slightly, but there was still enough air in the bag to keep it afloat.
John considered handing it over, beginning to feel a bit sympathetic as well as not wanting to take care of a sick stroppy Sherlock when they got back to the flat. As he went to unzip it however a noise at the end of the ally caught his attention. Sherlock remained still, trying hard not to shiver.
Mycroft rubbed gentle soothing circles into the swollen expanse. “You almost look,”
Lestrade placed that damned plastic bag inside the boat and swam back to the dock with it. He placed it on the surface before pulling himself up, only then remembering how horrid a feeling it was to wear soaked through clothes.
“I use headphones.” He defended.
Molly left to change and when she reentered with a purse to carry the tiny pair in she was met with a very unwelcomed sight. “You’re….”
'," she mimicked Mycroft's voice. "I should have figured you for a queer."
Sherlock frowned, John was only ever sad when he thought of him. “There’s no trick, I’m just sucking up all the energy in here to exist apparently. I would make it warm if I could.”
’ John thought as he ripped a second bedpost off.
Sherlock began pacing about the area around the two deceased men on the park bench. John found his gaze kept going back to the angry people looking on.
Mycroft’s eyes snapped back open, their piercing blackness staring at him. The tentacle that Greg had bitten shot forward, forcing its way into his mouth now. Lestrade squirmed, his hands immediately grabbing the thing and trying to rip it out of him. But the digit was far too strong for that and only forced its way deeper, the tapered edge making it to the opening is his throat as his eyes began watering. He tried screaming for Mycroft to stop, but the damn thing was blocking him from speaking. The tentacle that had previously been around his other wrist came back and soothingly stroked his hair, though Greg was too occupied trying to pull the first tentacle out of his mouth to even bother with that one.
“I don’t know what I could have possibly done wrong.” Sherlock raised both hands in frustration; John watched the pastry intensely. “Well there’s probably no point to this anymore.” He began unlock the cage, his biscuit holding hand on against the bars.
If you see a typo, tell me D:
Bloody phone, why does Mrs. Hudson have such an infernal device? “John! Don’t hang up-“ Sherlock practically shouts but it’s too late, John the line went dead.
“I thought I was over having to open these damned things…” he tried grabbing the handle but it wouldn’t budge. “I see. So I’m trapped haunting the flat.”
“It’s just Greg.” The D.I. began to get up but paused, “You can come if you like… I mean, Molly could help find something on his coat and I’m sure you’d like to be the first to know.”
In an attempt to avoid human interaction John ignored Donovan while trailing behind the detective, until she cut him off.
Chapter 10
Sherlock closed his eyes as tight as he possibly could to keep from spinning. He let out another dry cough, alerting John to what was wrong.
Mycroft clenched his jaw and grabbed Greg’s thighs hard, pulling him closer as the suckers left noticeable marks there. Greg did his best to weakly clutch at the bed below him, but it was no use, his strength was gone. The tentacle around his dick abruptly let go, sliding down his trembling body until reaching his entrance.
Lestrade had a call from a nightclub, someone had been murdered in the crowd of dancers. He knew the forensics for that would be a nightmare.
“Sentiment of our close friendship preventing you from inflicting bodily harm to me perhaps?”
John caught the carefully chosen wording, “It’s alright, we don’t have to.” He tried to hide his disappointment.
“Sorry, I get a lot of texts these days.” John continued looking at the small screen.
“I’m fine, I’m not hurt.” Sherlock muttered.
“Not much to tell, you already know about all of it. Live at home with my brother, go to school online, I don’t get out much…” his voice trailed off unenthusiastically.
John glanced down at where his phone was resting on the table. He had half expected it to light up with a message at any moment. It seemed it was constantly receiving messaged the last few days. People he could hardly even remember, sending their condolences. As kind a gesture as that was, it was just exhausting. He had stopped sending back ‘thank you’ texts and hadn’t answered his phone unless it was work. Normalcy would be highly welcomed about now, not that he could ever slip back to his old life again. Not without Sherlock.
John doesn’t come home and Sherlock begins to suspect he’s made a terrible mistake.
Journey Home
What the hell did he look good in? What would Sherlock think he looked good in? He briefly considered wearing something nice, something with a good tie, but the idea quickly died. That was far too formal and he wasn’t even sure if they would be staying in Sherlock’s place or if he could convince him to go outside, which he already knew would be difficult to do. Sherlock was always at home… always.
John swallowed a rather large gulp of earl grey. Doing all that weird research the day before really helped. Cold spots usually meant something was building. Was Sherlock about to try something?
"Well John, I never thought that liquid would get into your system. There uh… there's no antidote. Not yet at least."
John’s eyebrows shot up a bit at that, “You swore you binned them all.”
“I- I don’t understand, I thought Mr. Holmes wanted me to come- the message-“
“Highly unlikely.” Sherlock mused, his eyes not leaving what he had been focusing on.
John on the other hand was growing rather use to odd sounds at unexpected times. Could it have been Sherlock? If so, why did he choose now to make a sound? Was he trying to tell them there was something here? He shook his head, this was like trying to find someone lost in a well because Lassie barked at you. He hung his head down for a moment as he held the top of the dresser and held onto it. “I just need something more clear.” He mumbled, hoping Donovan and Lestrade wouldn’t hear him. “like that thing you did with my hands.” Even he could hardly hear himself whisper that part.
Sherlock hadn’t responded to him though. He couldn’t. Because Mycroft had already done something utterly impossible.
Sherlock pulled off his shoes and threw them at the ground angrily, still shrinking.  “This was a stupid experiment.” He turned to flop on his bed and stopped.
“Small talk doesn’t suit you.” He scoffed, feeling like a git for how high his knees came up in the seat while wearing stilettos.
“I’m never letting you out of my sight again.”
“I still have to do some shopping, we cant just stay here all day with nothing to eat. Besides, I have a job too, though you always seem to forget about it.”
The doctor’s face felt hotter then a moment ago, “But… where does this put us?”
John looked at the two men with gunshot wounds to their heads. “Well this is a rather public place for such a thing, but I don’t understand why they have signs.” John squinted hard to read the signs but they were just too far out of sight.
-You only use the commands on the right side of the keyboard when doing mundane activities, but favor the left while in combat. At first I thought you were right handed, but then ambidextrous, but if you were you wouldn’t favor one side while fighting. So you’re left handed but can’t always use your left hand. I’m assuming your not using it to masturbate while playing online games, so it must be injured somehow.-
“Stop that!”
There was no reply. Two hours had gone by, Greg’s shift at work ended and he arrived at Mycroft’s town house, and there was still no reply. He had to do this, he told himself. It wasn’t as if the grass was booby trapped or anything. Shite, was it? Probably not. Lestrade took a deep breath to get rid of his nerves. He just had to knock, if no one answered, then fine. If Mycroft, or anyone else did, then he would do everything he could to get to the bottom of this.
-Well where are you!? You should know better then to run off without your medic AND Tank!-
Dr Watson and Mr Holmes,
It was difficult at first to stand in the glass jam jar since John's shoes were still wet from the drain and lacked the proper plastic griping of '
So apparently- and I swear I did not make this up- England's gay pride parade starts on Baker Street. I'm not saying that makes Johnlock canon.... (BUT IT TOTALLY DOES) :D
“Heh, well, short blond hair, hideous shoulder from the bullet wound, just average other then that I suppose.”
"Oh all right."
“So, who is it then? She’ll need to be brought in for questioning and police protection if you’re right.”
“Myc, please-” Greg knew he must be pretty desperate if he was even considering this tactic. “You’re not well, you need help.”
Sherlock nodded closing the door just before the car sped off. Lestrade spied a camera on a nearby building. "Big brother's watching." He muttered to himself. "Sherlock's to be exact."
“Sorry.” He slowed down his pace considerably and continued patiently until the soup was finished. “There. Better now?”
“Why will you stop at nothing to coddle me?” Sherlock scuffed and stood from his makeshift bed. He could see the determined look in John’s eyes though, “Do we have any fish?”
John’s expression fell a bit, but remained relatively optimistic. “You’re inside though. Safe from the weather or whatever?” Wasn’t that enough?
“John, diagnosis.” Sherlock pulled the sheet off the first body.
“I’m sure you could deduce it, you always do.”
The detective’s eyes grew wide, “Really? You’re not just saying that so-“
“No worries. He’s a wanker, just don’t let him get the better of ya.” Lestrade gave John’s shoulder a firm pat.
“Not terribly and only at first.” Sherlock’s baritone seemed to rumble through John’s speakers.
Lestrade made sure the doors to the lab were closed and that no one else was around.
"Probably didn't show up because of his
John wouldn’t give up so easily, he rounded the controls, “Aye Captain Holmes.” The boat went full speed ahead.
Sherlock heard the questioning voice from a short distance away first, he made no indication that he could hear someone calling John’s name, but of course they just had to call it again, causing John to turn.
"I don't need to be taken care of..." Sherlock's voice was little more then a raspy whisper.
After hearing the location from Molly, Mycroft found the surrounding security cams. Unfortunately there were none inside the building it’s self. If it were up to him there would be government accessible cameras in every corner of every building.
“Oh, right, John’s hungry, Mycroft- surely you brought food with you?”
Sherlock didn’t listen, he opened the door and let him Mrs. Hudson carrying a pan of fresh pastries. “I just made up a batch and thought you boys would like some. Just this once though, I’m not your cook.”
when Sherlock came back wearing his loathed deerstalker hat. “You hate that hat.” Was all he could manage.
So he waits.
“Boring?”
Sherlock blanked as he looked at the screen.
John cocked his head, not really sure where this conversation was about to go, “You’re gonna have to be a lot more specific there.”
“Which is why I trust you with knowing about this. Now drink it.” His hand wrapped around the back of the blond’s head holding it in place. “Don’t you want me to be in complete control? Wrap my hands around all of you at once?” his hissing voice ghosted across Sebastian’s skin.
He grabbed his laptop and sat at the desk near by, snapping the top up as he went to his blog. There were a ton of comments about what had happened, he briefly scrolled through some before deciding he didn’t want to look at any of them. In the corner of the page he noticed he had a private message he hadn’t read yet, it pre dated Sherlock’s… John rubbed his eyes before opening it up.
Would be difficult. –SH
"Lestrade, I swear I will never solve another case for you again if you tell a single soul about this." Sherlock lifted John up, carefully placing him in his breast pocket.
Donovan’s eyes quickly scanned over John’s body to his great annoyance. “Does he pay you? I can’t think of any other reason you would follow him to crimes scenes and take his abuse.”
"John!" Sherlock's voice seemed impossibly loud.
John pulled his phone out and swiped it open. It was just Greg texting about anything he might need from the flat.
"Anderson!" John was furious, that was much too far, "I swear to god, if you don't get out of here now I'm going to punch you so hard you won't be able to use your jaw."
"Should we go back in then?" Lestrade wasn't sure what the detective was deducing yet.
“That’s really you in them?” John held a hand over his mouth. This couldn’t be real. Maybe he had checked on the closet and tripped. Accidentally locked himself in and was now having a psychotic break.
“I heard shouting, was John’s lady friend just up?”
"No. No. No. How many times do I have to tell you? His jaw was rounder and the angle of his eyes were-"
As much as he wanted to continue to tease his boyfriend, John gave in, taking Sherlock into his mouth, relishing in the plethora of sounds he made. Holding his hips down to lessen thrusts, John glanced up the stunningly white form and caught Sherlock's pale eyes watching him, pupils dilated fully, black curls pressed to his face from sweat. Light tremors shot down his legs, shaking them lightly against John, who tightened his grip as he felt them. John was almost painfully hard, he didn't care, there would be time for that later. This wasn't his moment, he told himself, this was Sherlock's.
“I still have those dreams.” He didn’t notice his left hand had started shaking as he talked, Sherlock had. “I can’t…” he sighed quietly, there was no point in explaining he no longer could connect to people. He had tried so hard when he was first released from the military. Faked his way through dates, relationships, even small talk. He didn’t care about the people around him. He had wanted desperately to care, so much so that people really did believe his act. But in the end, he just didn’t care about other people.
Greg huffed, “He didn’t plan this out very well.” He muttered under his breath.
“Not for a damn second.”
His mind raced. "ah! John left the counter when he saw the fire!" a perfectly sound solution. But how far could John have gotten? He began calling for his flat mate again, this time checking every surface, even the floor.
Mrs. Hudson: You’re home? Oh goodness I have been worried sick.
John's body was parallel with the ground before his mind could even keep up, but now his should was writhing in a familiar pain.
-Sorry to worry you Otter-
Sherlock jumped back dramatically with a yelp, John tried to sturdy him “What is it? What’s wrong?” Sherlock’s eyes went wide and John followed were they pointed. “Oh lord… biggest cockroaches I have seen in my life… lets get out of this ally shall we?”
“You mean in isolation.” Sherlock shot back.
"Not you, just the women you date."
What difference does one inch make?- SH
“Hungry?”
“Sod off Donovan, it’s Sherlock’s brother, he was closer to the flat so he came ahead in case there was anything time sensitive.” It was close enough to the truth anyway.
“John! Wait!”
There was a distinctly irritated sigh, “For Science John.”
Sherlock never said please. Not when commanding him home over an emergency anyway.
“Very funny.” Sarcastic John was not someone to be messed with. “I’ve been volunteering for his experiments is all, and as moral compensation I got to pick one for him.”
Sherlock grinned, it was a very complicated murder and he would be able to show off to John. “Oh how dull, really Lestrade, Anderson should be able to solve this one for you!”
“John! Let go! Be reasonable!” They were already outside and within range of a cab when Sherlock gave in, “Fine. John you can talk again.”
“You make me look taller by comparison, people don’t notice you as much which is good when we’re under cover or on stake outs, just more convenient really. Besides, if you were any taller that bullet would have gone through your heart and not your shoulder. You’re just the right size.” Once he reached the bathroom he gently lowered John’s body into the bathtub, back resting against the edge so he could sit up.
“What is it? You can tell me you know.”
“Can’t.”
“It’s really my own fault that I said what I said yesterday. And… well.”
John left to make breakfast for them both, whether Sherlock refused to eat it or not. Sherlock watched him from his thinking position on the couch, cataloging his every movement.
Your therapist has been living alone for the past five years and owns three cats. I thought this information might be useful if she questions you in a manner you don’t like again. – SH
“Shit.” Greg practically spat.
“I’m really sorry! I wasn’t thinking! I just thought you would be a cat or something, I’m sorry! I just really needed a break from the experiments! And… oh my god Lock, please forgive me.” It was then that John saw the long black tail coming out from under Sherlock coat and gasped.
Sherlock could hear John in the other room as he treated the cut, he sat quietly staring at his laboratory equipment, his mind raced.
John shifted awkwardly in his seat. “I’m not ruling anything out just yet.” He was having a hard time meeting Lestrade’s eyes now, luckily his monitor was there to provide an excellent distraction. “Maybe whoever is doing this just wants us to think its paranormal. Someone who has a grudge against Daniels? He’s loosing rent with all these people being scared off after all.”
“Put me on my desk.” It took a great deal of added effort at his size, but Sherlock quickly assessed that the papers he had been working on were gone. “This isn’t good.”
A not so subtle moan escaped John’s mouth as his half firm cock came in contact with Sherlock. John immediately pulled back and tried to disengage himself. “Well we should start the day then eh? I’ll just go make some food…” he hurried out before the detective could stop him.
Sherlock let out a sigh, “Nail polish on the pillow, chartrux, an unusual color, the wife had new manicure today but the right index finger was smudged. One doesn’t go through the trouble of getting a manicure if it isn’t immaculate. Oh, and it was definitely not pre meditated.”
“That’s for later. I already have a plan for that one anyway, so it wont be worth anything if you do it to me.” He smiled knowing what that one would be for.
Does John have a gym membership? GL
The flame started, John jumped back and quickly looked back at Sherlock who in turn looked back at the clock.
Chapter 13
“Well I’m sooo sorry to delay you like this.” John huffed sarcastically.
John woke to a loud booming noise. 'The devil is that racket?'
“Why would I need more then one scarf? Doesn’t this one do the job?”
Molly’s eyes fluttered open and she quickly sat up. “Hello? Is somebody here?”
“Just trying to get through the door,” He avoided eye contact with her and noticed Sherlock outside the small flat had stopped to wait for John.
Greg barely managed to bring his hands up at all. He wanted to try to push Mycroft off of him, but they were so weak that they barely pressed against him. The other tentacles were now freely able to pull Greg’s trousers off as a warm wetness covered his thighs.
Sherlock was enjoying John's condition far too much. He would never be accused of focusing too much on his flatmate since he could argue the small man needed constant watching now and even better, the detective had John all to himself, no need to compete for his attention with pesky dull girlfriends or the hospital John worked at. Of course that also meant there was no one to buy his groceries. He would cross that bridge when he got there.
“Hm?” John wasn’t sure what he meant by that.
Maria dropped her attention from John for a moment, “Oh John! I didn’t mean to!” She loosened her grasp slightly but still held him firm. John bit down on her thumb as hard as he could. She let out a quick yelp before realizing she had dropped him.
“John wait! Come back, I said I’m sorry!” He calls after his flatmate as he follows him down the stairs.
“Well you looked pathetic last night, I was trying to help.” He shot back defensively.
’ is different though?”
Something in Sherlock's tone frightened John, "Alright, alright, I'm doing it."
“See something shocking?” he was unaware John was looking at his screen still.
The private message had been sent from his own account.
“You didn’t make John bring you here did you?”
“Hit his head earlier, he’s just a bit mixed up at the moment.” Sherlock put a possessive hand on John’s shoulder, “Just taking him out for some air.
“I do know him. I know almost everything about him-“
John wised up and stood his ground wondering where the hell Sherlock was. He tried thinking of something witty to say to get himself out of there, not realizing the pipe and consequent sound was really a diversion. To his right one of the boys bolted for him, grabbing John by the waist and forcing him to the ground. John pushed back but had already lost his balance, landing on his bad shoulder as he hit the ground and winced in pain. The others were on him in an instant, kicking freely. The boy with the pipe raised his weapon high, moments before sending it flying down at John’s head he was suddenly pulled backwards by an unseen force. The other three were to occupied to notice, two of which had kneeled for fist assaults and to grab John’s wallet.
“Not trying to buy him before the auction starts are we?”
Mycroft allowed himself a smile knowing that meant John would be leaving the flat and would reveal why he was absent from the monitor for the past two days. But ten minutes of film later she seemed to be storming away from the flat in a positively dismal mood.
“There’s more, but again, selfish reasons.”
Harry stayed quiet, focusing on the cement wall a few feet away.
Mycroft couldn’t help himself as he brought the other hand up to feel it as well. “You’re huge.” He mused.
