“ ‘S for an experiment.” He said as clearly as he could, staring at the curve of John’s butt and the strong, lightly hair dusted thighs that came out from under the shorts. Sherlock bit his lip, he was close. John turned around, making Sherlock slow down his movements, but only slightly as he couldn’t help how good it was feeling. John saw that his plate was empty and grabbed his dishes.
"And how do you suppose I do that?" He asked, praying to whatever deity that Sherlock wouldn't make this sexual. He had just gained this friend, and he would very much like not to loose him over something as ridiculous as a crush.
“The fact that you just called me clever while insulting me speaks volumes of my intelligence against yours, brother mine.” He muttered, not looking up from his belts. Mycroft smiled ever so slightly at his little brother. He walked further into the room, stopping beside the young man.
“Where do you want to go?” John asked.
John smacked his forehead.
John laid back on his mattress, putting his hands behind his head, reaccounting his day. Sherlock was a strange man. The way he spoke made him seem posh, but he dressed like a scene punk. And the words he used, and how he said them? Even if he wasn’t posh, he was damn smart.
"About what?"
“Merry Christmas, Myrial.” The old woman seemed to glow for a moment.
“You want to see me tomorrow?” John laughed.
“It’s annoying, but I have to live with it until Mycroft can get me the hell out of here.” John smiled.
They got to his room and Sherlock stopped him at the door.
“I love you too, Sherlock. I’ll leave the door cracked in case you need anything, alright?”
The waiter came back with their drinks, and neither of them had looked at the menu yet so they had another few minutes before he came back and asked for their orders. John was dreading it. He never thought ordering food could be so nerve wracking. Everything looked so expensive too. £15 was the cheapest he found so far. He glanced at Sherlock, who caught his eyes across the table.
"I'll have the, um... " He looked to Sherlock and then back to the waiter. "The crab ravioli.. But uh... Actually..." His voice had gone high again, so he cleared his throat and dropped it a little. "I'm a boy..." The waiter blushed and his eyes widened.
"Oh. Uh yeah, actually. We don't get to eat shellfish very often. I remember being about five, I think? Anyway, we went over to my gran's, and it was her 50'th, so she went all out with the catering and stuff. There was cold shrimp with cocktail sauce, lobster stuffed shrimp, snow crab legs, and full lobster tails. Everyone got a bowl of clam chowder as well. It was hell for my mum, especially when they didn't have anything except salad for her to eat. My gran didn't really like her at the time, because she got pregnant with Harry when she was 16, and then had me when she was 20. She thinks Gran thought she was a slut or something, and a gold digger, because Dad was the oldest son and Grandad has this huge company. And she was probably right, because when Grandad died, it turned out Gran had talked him out of leaving Dad anything in the will, because of Mum. It was all a huge mess really. We had to move out of our house because Grandad's bank wasn't automatically paying the house bills anymore, and they hadn't been, but we didn't know. So now Dad's in debt, and Mum never had a job, so now she does cleaning..." John stared down at the table.
"Bored!" John startled, then started laughing as Sherlock proceeded to scowl at him.
“Thank you for hanging out with me.” He said quietly. Sherlock stopped spinning and looked him over.
Hello everyone! I'm so sorry that this update has taken so long, my computer was broken for a while and I just got it fixed, updated should be coming a bit more regularly now. Thank you everyone for being so patient, enjoy!!
“Hey.”
“They gave you a special curiculum just because you’re a twat? Man, I wish I could get away with that in public school.” John shook his head. Sherlock smirked at him, doing a slow spin in the chair.
“I don’t like it.” He stated. Sherlock nodded.
“I dunno…” John teased, giving his cock a firm stroke before gripping it at the base again, wagging it slightly to tempt the other man. “Tell me how much you want it.”
"Okay, yeah, sure." He snorted. "And I huff draino." Sherlock gave him a pained look before turning around, stiffly. Of course he would think its a joke. Only Mycroft ever took him seriously, but he was just a control freak.
"I was expecting her to be straight, or at least mildly preppy. I'm severly dissapointed in myself. Normally its only a small thing I miss." Sherlock muttered from the sofa. John nodded, not really understanding, but he figured it had something to do with that "deducing" thing he did. He walked over to the sofa and sat on the edge of the cushion, tense.
"A completely healthy drug addict. Sure. Okay." John scoffed. Sherlock sent a harsh glare at the chubby boy next to him, rising from the bench with his fists clenched.
"The deduction." Sherlock pretended to be nonchalant, and not care by looking down into his water glass as he suckled (gnawed) on the straw.
“Coffee? That seems like a horrid first date to me.” John turned red for the thousandth time that night.
“Care to elaborate?” John asked carefully. Sherlock squirmed uncomfortably for a moment, his own sex starting to thicken and drip.
, he thought, then flashes of his naked chest squirmed their way into his mind, making him grimace.
“Anyway! Were here.” They stood at the steps to John’s house. There were no cars in  the driveway and all the lights were off, so John deemed it safe enough to go in. He ushered the taller boy inside and then toed off his shoes, yawning and stretching, going straight upstairs. Sherlock followed suit. They reached John’s room. Sherlock remembered it from the first time he was in here, the day before. John had picked up some of the laundry and thrown it towards the hamper in the corner. Some of it missed and was on the floor next to it. Who was Sherlock to judge? Half of his room was made up of laundry. He planted himself in the office chair again and spun around. John laid on his stomach on the bed, facing Sherlock, his head propped out on his hands.
John stared at him. How on earth does he do that.
“My mum, she uh, well she really likes men. And wine. And well, she likes to drink when she gets home. Same as my dad, but he doesn't get too bad. And well-”
"It will be the brownie, with walnuts."
“But still. You could have just yelled at them, but you didn’t. You fought them, you scared the shite out of them, and now you’ve helped me bandage up and you’re still here.” John replied. Sherlock put his hands together and leaned them against his mouth.
“It’s.. the case. I feel like I missed something.” he lied. He hadn’t missed anything, it was a fairly straightforward case. Man kidnaps girl, kills her, harvests her organs, eats them, isn't careful. And now he’s in jail, but he wanted to play on John’s concern, seeing if it could keep him focused away from Sherlock’s experiment.
Sherlock was dozed off from the cold medicine, his neck bent at an awkward angle and soft snores bubbling up from his throat. John looked over him, fondly. His hair was a beautiful mess of dark curls, John ached to run his fingers through the silky locks. To run the pads of his fingers over Sherlock’s sharp cheekbones, over his jaw and his lips. John gave Sherlock’s lips a hard, hungry stare, before shaking his head and sighing.
“I apologize, madam. I did not know you felt so strongly about your children entertaining in their rooms, shall we sit outside instead?” Sherlock asked, his voice was smooth like butter, making John’s mother loosen her grip, the “sultry” smile fading back into place.
. He accused himself.
“Nothing, just really don’t like holidays.” He said. John scoffed at him.
“At least he’s nice to you.” Sherlock tried to bite back a smile, but it just came out looking like a lopsided twitch.
didn’t want to hurt Sherlock.
“Of course. That's what friends do, right? Spend time with each other and go places together?” He sounded like he was asking a question rather than stating a fact. John raised a brow at him.
“So both of your parents are going to try to get in my pants?” He joked. John shoved his shoulder.
“Oh so my Christmas present is not taking the train to your house?” Sherlock opened the door.
John pushed his cock head past the tight, soft ring of Sherlock’s lips and he met it with his warm tongue. Sherlock let him thrust the tip in and out of his mouth, keeping a soft suction and laving at the leaking tip with all of the moves he learned the night prior. John was moaning and pulling at his hair within minutes.
“What do you want to do tomorrow?” John asked. Sherlock looked over at him in surprise.
“John?” Sherlock called softly. John grunted and turned his head to glance at him.
"I just thought you'd like to know. Just in case I do see you when I'm high. So that you aren't confused, or so that you don't ruin my high by being worried. All my needles are fresh, I get it from a trusted dealer, and I have a rule of getting tested once a month just in case. I'm completely healthy."
I like them because they’re cute.” He sniffed and took a deep breath, a few small giggles escaped before he regained composure. Sherlock smirked at him in an
“I apologize. I know that this is something you probably value, I didn’t mean to shit all over it.” John smiled.
“Oh Sherlock, sweetheart, I-,” John stumbled over his words trying to find the right way to say how he was feeling, how to make Sherlock feel better and put his fear to bed. “I love you.”
“So, you were expecting to do something?” Sherlock nodded and went back to spinning his chair. John pursed his lips. “So… What exactly did you have in mind?” Sherlock sighed.
“Your clothes are for girls, even though they’ve been branded as gender neutral or tomboy. You have bags under your eyes, meaning you’ve overextended yourself in school and in life. is This because you have no one to fall back on, you must stay strong for yourself. It’s obvious that you have an older sibling, just by the way you act around others. I can tell it’s a sister because you have no small masculine tendencies you would have picked up from an older brother, whom would be your role model during this time. Unsupportive, that one is easy. Little self confidence, and since she’s older, she must have a job. But here you are binding with a compression bandage, wearing girls clothes, and cleaning yourself up after being pushed around by some bullies.” Sherlock looked up from the table but didn’t really look at John, because he didn’t want to read the ‘go to hell’ in his eyes. “It doesn’t seem ‘kind’ to me.”
“That's not my name!” He whipped around to face his father, almost spilling his plate over the front of the man towering over him. His father wasn’t a tall man, he would only come up to Sherlock’s shoulder, maybe a bit more, but he was a sturdy man. Blue piercing eyes and an extremely bushy handlebar moustache, if he wasn't so angry, he’d be charming. His chest was as wide as a barrel and his hands were thick from years of hard work. He could inflict pain very easily, and he used people’s fear of pain to control them. He leaned forward into John’s face until the whiskers of his moustache were touching the boys nose.
“You went out with a man tonight.” Sherlock said after a sharp breath, tasting the fragrance of a seperate musk than John’s, confirming his deduction. John’s eyes went wide, and he let out a surprised chuckle. His hand fell from Sherlock’s shoulder, making him shiver from the loss of warmth.
“What do you want, Mycroft.” His brother looked down his nose at him, which was a feat, considering Sherlock was almost taller than him.
“I mean… Like where its okay to touch and what not.” Sherlock still looked at him in confusion, silently asking him to explain more. John sighed and pointedly looked down into his lap.
“You boys go have fun, but not too much fun, you hear?”
Other than that, enjoy the smut y'all.
“So what do you normally do on Sundays?” Sherlock inquired. John shrugged.
“John, I can’t.” He shook his head. John scoffed.
“I’ll text you as soon as I get home.” He promised. John nodded.
“Come on, someone probably called the cops.” He said through clenched teeth before standing up and walking off towards a coffee shop across the street. Sherlock pulled himself off the ground as well, following him.
"I'm not gaining the upper hand, Sherlock. That's not what you do in a healthy relationship. I'm protecting you."
John could hear Mikheia's laugh from down the hallway as he neared the boy's door. So the nurse hadn't left yet. He should wait until she was done giving him the rounds.
The two men. There was an urgency in their voices, hushed and low, that suggested that the topic of conversation might be illicit. They met at the café because one was staying upstairs in the hotel. John had seen his room key sticking out of his pocket, along with a passport. That glance told him that one man was ready to run if he had to. That he didn't necessarily trust the person he was talking to. They weren't eating in the building next to them that advertised '
"Answer my question, Mycroft." Sherlock said lowly and Mycroft pursed his lips as he looked over his shoulder at John's sleeping form, as curled on the hospital bench as he could be considering his wounds.
He coughed into his hand and felt something splatter against the fine material of his gloves. He glanced down into his palm, seeing a writhing,
"Wouldn't dream of it." John smiles, but it's a bestofluckhopewe'realivetomorrow smile, not the one Sherlock wants. Not the I'llsurvivethisandwe'llhavebreakfasttomorrowandlaughthisoff one he wants.
"You can't tell by which way the wind's blowing or the angle of my left eyebrow?" John frowned, busy cleaning the blood from under his nails. "He passed out halfway through. Should be fine in a few hours—"
No. impossible.
Moran's hand lashed out, sending a few trays of bread clattering to the floor. John moved to side-step it and came face to face with Moran, though they were separated by the metal cabinets.
Sherlock scoffed and gave him a look as if Anderson had just suggested they go out to lunch.
"—But we can't do this without you. Come on. It's time. Sherlock? Hey, look at me."
His phone lay still.
"That's not what I meant."
John smiled at him and let Sherlock kiss him with a warmth that felt like the rising sun that shone on them.
Proceed with caution.
"JOHN!"
Mycroft looked up from his paper, eyebrow raised, ignorant of his brother’s internal struggle.
He didn't sleep much, but then again he never did. He slept
“If she had, John would be dead by now, well before my return to London, and so would you. Her loyalties were with another man entirely, the one Moriarty wanted her to see.”
“Oh, don’t be dramatic now. I’m just teasing about the writing, you know. How is it in beautiful Kennedy, Washington?”
body, Sherlock, of course he needs to breathe—" Harry huffs, flipping John onto his back.
“Doctor Alkaev, I apologise for my brother.” Mycroft cuts in smoothly. “He…has a great investment in your wife’s disappearance.
Sherlock says nothing. He can't. He tightens his hold on John's hand and feels his head bow over the edge of the tub, brushing John's dirtied knee, as a low groan of agonised despair tears from his throat. He sounds like a dying animal, but god, that's just what he feels like. He's dying and he's not even the one bleeding.
"Pity," He sneered. "I thought you were right on the mark too until that came out."
“It’s not prudent, Gregory…” Mycroft begins tartly.
Sherlock says nothing and stares at him, eyes darting around his mangled face.
"I'm fine." He said, jerking his face back. "Just a scratch. I wasn't expecting the night guard."
“And how are you so sure you’re not making excuses for human weaknesses?” John countered. “Her son is sick, and this is the only man who’s ever done anything to calm them about it.”
“And yourself? Do hare hunters have names?”
He vomits violently. Uncontrollably. Some sound escapes him, and he doesn’t know what to call it.
“Sherlock!”
"We were doing quite well until you came along."
“And you wouldn’t believe how high Frankenstein’s Monster’s been rucking up our water bill, not to mention he’s been using the hot tap too much.” John mutters and that breaks their composure as they both double over in laughter.
"Alright," Lestrade continues slowly. "But what's this got to do with him?" He asks, gesturing to the dead man.
Mud spattered boots crunch over permafrost and mud, joined by four furry paws. A light cheery whistle sounds out over the quiet land, carrying out to mingle with the baying of farm animals and the tinkle of the bells around their necks. The crunching stops, the boots stilling. The dog’s collar settles.
"Thank your boy over there." Lestrade says, gesturing to Sherlock. "Texted me your 'coordinates'. Said if I wanted to ask you anything you were free."
"No, I'm not." He said, so sure of himself and his convictions. "You know, I think I'll round up all your little friends and pick them off one by one. Your landlady first, since there's not much of her to play with. Then that friend of yours, that Detective Inspector you work with—"
“Yes.” Sherlock answers softly. “Yes, I want to see him again.”
Sherlock has already leapt from the bed, shrugging his coat over the clothes he’s slept in. He’ll change later. He can’t afford to now, not when John is still gone.

“He came after you, Sherlock.” John murmurs, and he feels warm hands on his knees. “He came after you
As he raced through the dark halls, adrenaline pumped through him like liquid sunlight, brightening his blood until his heart was bursting like an imploding supernova with every beat. He was moving in hyper-time, no longer noticing the cold pain that pervaded every crevice of his body or the sudden dizziness that crashed onto him in waves, like he was being pushed and battered in the pull of a riptide.
“I do. I hope you’re one for conversation, John.”
"Sherlock." Lestrade starts forward. "Sherlock, is it—?"
He'd have to take the night shift at the clinic again.
He arrived at almost four in the morning—further supporting her husband's long standing claim that nothing good happened after midnight—in a fury of movement and excitement in the otherwise dead hours of the morning.
“Sherlock, please, be rational—”
"But John I—"
how I would have known with absolute certainty that you were going to come back, that I could follow you and you wouldn’t turn me away?”
saw me naked after I passed out the other day, which we still need to talk about by the way—"
"No to two out of three, how about that?"
Through the glass again
"Why?" Sherlock asked into the clanging void. "Why are you doing this?"
The dark room stirred with thin, spicy smoke, the wisps trailing from a hand-rolled cigarette dangling from a stubbled, bloodied mouth.
John had seen him out at the empty porter’s booth, barely bothering to dress for the weather, his hair mussed and cowlicked. They’d had many partings just like this, in the lightening hours of dawn, one of them stepping outwards and the other staying put; they were well practiced in public goodbyes.
"Men like us. Soldiers. What happens to us, in the end?"
John feels pliant and warm, like he’d settled into a bed after a warm bath, even though he was curled on a cold, hard floor. But Sherlock was there.
“Enough games, James. Enough vagaries and shaded words. I don’t want to keep pretending I have the patience. Tell me what’s up there.”
"Common sense, sir. The only way to look around these arches is to lean over the fence," He indicated the iron fence beside them, "So you wouldn't know if someone was on either side, listening, which they must be since you're a criminal and all, and so you must be wanted for something somewhere—"
Of course.
"The agency?" John laughed. "No, I meant the clinic. I've been gone nearly two weeks with no explanation. If I don't get my pink slip when I get back I'll quit out of shock so they can be rid of me."
"So?"
“John.” Sherlock’s voice, from behind the car. He had popped the trunk, looking at whatever was inside. John rounded the car to join him.
There, pinpoints hanging from the belltower, are John’s shoes, knotted together.
There is a sudden bitterness in the air, like a foul smell riding on a brisk breeze. It smells dark and heavy, like smoke.
He had not expected this; that John would turn himself into the Golem, that he would wring the arms of his morals until they were red and raw. But then again, he was not surprised. John was John. He had been a soldier before he met Sherlock, and so he would be after Sherlock left. The soldier mentality had been his saving grace. It had preserved him after he was shot, it had helped him cope, and so it was only rational that he turn to it in other times of mental or emotional crisis. He had just turned to it so much that he had his back to everything else.
Dr. Mortimer steps aside with a wry grin, gesturing to the foyer with a wiry arm.
The bullet would have been painful enough, the wood splintering through the solid bone and muscle, severely impacting their natural healing rate. They may not feel pain as humans did, but the silver casing would ensure a slow, horrible poisoning if the wood missed its mark. A failsafe, Sherlock had said, and he hated himself.
There had been no humanity in it. That was what overwhelmed him when he bothered to look back on it: they had spared him not because war had rules, not because he wasn’t a threat to them with his injuries, but because he was useful. And the minute he hadn’t been—though they were lucky,
“You think I’m like Jim. You think every clue has to mean something. I’m not so indulgent as he was. He was obsessed with making you puzzles and watching you work through the intricacies. In a way, my work is…a loving parody. Jim overthought everything, tailored every detail and riddle to your liking. I don’t plan like he did. I don’t think things through.”
"It has to be me, Sherlock." He whispered. "I have to face him, in the end."
Bigger things to deal with, and all.
Was he alright? No. No, he was far from alright. John was suddenly back in his life, suddenly right there in front of him, acting like nothing had happened, like nothing had changed, but everything had changed,
“John?” Harry called quietly, opening the door and popping her head in. “Wakey wakey. You’ve been having a lie-in

But John doesn't want any of that. He wants simple things, like a peaceful flat and hot tea and a nice warm jumper on a winter morning and he wanted that to include his on-again, off-again, on-again flatmate. Hopefully, after this chase ends, he can go home and have every simple thing he wanted.

The thudding of wild footsteps on the stairs before the door flies open, giving him prime viewing of two bare, pale feet. His heart hammers. His face is still too hot.
John grins and chews his pasta carefully before replying.
Some deity had smiled upon him today, someone had known that Sherlock ached over never being able to ask John so many things—
There was a slight pause on the other side as John laid a hand against the door.

"What if they want to see you with your wings?"
"And the caduceus?" John asks and, when he gets no response, adds "Sherlock?"
“I found you, Sherlock Holmes.” John says, unable to keep the streak of pride from his voice. “I tracked you here, and told Mycroft to take me the rest of the way. You might be able to hide from the rest of the world, but not me.”
Silence. Then:

"Yes. Very much in love."
There’s a commotion inside, loud enough for him to hear out on the street. Gladstone looks to him, head cocked, but Sherlock waves a hand, pacifying him. Odd that the occupants would be up at this hour, though, in a way, he’s not surprised. He’s kept stranger schedules.
"It depends on who you ask."
"I thought you weren't made in that mould?"
“I’ve got the good stuff tonight, John—” He stopped, the smile falling from his face when John held the bullet in front of his face.
John sighed but it was lost in the wind.
"Playing mother now? Boring."
He leaned into the driver's side and turned the key. The engine roared to life as he climbed in, headlights casting their long glare across the dark sand.
Sherlock disappears from his line of sight, coat swirling behind him as he strides down the hall.
“I’m sorry, John.” Molly says, leaning forward as she clutches the blanket around her. “I didn’t know Sebastian would hit you. I mean, I know he’s dumb enough, I just didn’t—I didn’t know he’d do that to you.”
"They're called...drivers." John said quietly, sounding as if he was about to be sick. "The agency gives them to clippers—people like me—as a bribe or complimentary...or whatever. It's an opioid cocktail in pill form. I took my first one a month after I started working and had insomnia and roaming hallucinations for half a week...so I never touched them again. I just took my second one an hour ago...after I saw you with Mary. I thought maybe you were in on something together. I thought—well, I don't know what I thought, but it wasn't anything good…" John trailed off in a hysterical fit of giggles.
Mycroft frowned. They had been sheltered in the attic at least all day, with no time to venture outside to feed, nor any source to drink from. Yet they were alive.
it happened in the first place. But…I'd stopped chewing the gum then, hadn't I? I'd stopped the medication for something I didn't really need but my body thought I did."
John wobbled on his legs, unsteady after the sudden impart of velocity through a stationary object. Billy had shot from below the waist, upwards. The bullet would have embedded itself near the bone of his scapula.
After that blood and darkness, John stepped into the light.
"Yes."
“Cool, it worked!” She beamed, turning to Sherlock. “May I?” She asked, wiggling her gloved hands, held out as if he would take them off for her.
"Yeah, we wouldn't want you to get overconfident." Lestrade says dryly. "Why the zodiac? If this is by the same killer who did in that woman at the warehouse, it should have something to do with alchemy, right?"
Ghosts of old words encircled them.
Lestrade hears the line disconnect after he’s given Sherlock the address and sighs.
John stirs, and looks up through bleary eyes.
"I've got Molly's report on the ash you found on Jane's hand." Lestrade says, flipping through the open file in his hand. "We couldn't find a match, obviously, but someone did report a missing urn from a home break-in recently. We think they might be connected, and I've had the new DC follow up on it."
John watches them leave, and wonders if it is indeed a pleasure or not to have met this man.

“Harry?”
“Sherlock?” He calls softly, his words contrasting the sharp but effective jab he makes at the door with his umbrella, snapping it away from the lock.

He lowered the gun.
“I haven’t felt better since Switzerland.” John admitted, and Sherlock felt his heart drop into his stomach.

"You know, I heard somewhere that angels don't make mistakes because they can see the consequences of any and every choice they make."
“We have to…the sunlight…dawn’s coming.” John breathed, panting as he clutched at his shoulder, leaking with the wild blood of the stag. Sherlock felt a pang in his chest, an alien pain that had nothing to do with his own wounds and more to do with the fact that John’s didn’t seem to be healing.
“Well you weren’t here, were you?” Sherlock snarls, the instinct to defend John rather than question him too overpowering.
"It was only ever us, you know." John said, looking down into the crowd. "Most have hundreds of children. She has two."
“Tell me you missed me. Missed
John looks at him for a moment before he turns away and crumples the leftover paper from the meat in his hands.
Yet it seems Sherlock had taken him seriously, and forgot him; he knew he shouldn’t lament it, that it was for the greater good, but at times it stung, a particular wound that had nagged at him since the very beginning. It was the greatest flaw of their relationship, that he would be forgotten by the one person who mattered, and yet at this point it was necessary if they were ever going to be together again.
"Oh, fucking
"Well, that might be why I haven't gone, then."
“Grief?” Sherlock frowns. “Who died?”
Sherlock scoffs heavily and whirls around, beginning to pace before his brother.
“Were you expecting me?”
He can hear the music from outside; the manager must be in the red.
"I never thought that, John. Never. Not about you."
“And that bothers you, thinking about me often?”
As he woke and stared at Sherlock, who stared right back at him, he saw something in his eyes, something painful and cold and heavy, like iron stuck in deep water where no light shone through.
John has a limited few left if Sherlock can’t figure this out in time.
"Of course." Sherlock says with a flash of a smile meant to be understanding. It falls off his face the moment the manager looks away.
“Yes, I know
, so menial, so soft, where is the halo, where is the sword with which to smite the wicked, what of the beatific expression, and where are the wings—?
"Why?" Sherlock said, sounding like a petulant child. "Are you not having any?"
"Don't you ever,
"Yes he is…I saw the bloodstains, Sherlock told me what he did, I—no one survives that."
“Please, join me, Mr. Holmes!” His voice calls from the kitchen, and Sherlock heads to follow him, signalling for Gladstone to stay, though the beast is already curled up on a tattered rug that once must have cost a few thousand pounds.  “You must not believe I’m an absent-minded man, although it certainly appears as if that’s indeed what I am...”
A weight holds itself against his ear, and a jauntily happy ringtone buzzes in his ear, mercifully cut short as the line picks up. A deep baritone fills his mind and he feels himself rise through the mire of distorted sound and light. He feels himself again.
He looked beside him, where Sherlock was lounging on the ground. Certainly an odd sight to see since Sherlock rarely ever
"Yes he is. You think he's not, but it's quite obvious that he is. Where was I? Oh, right. Our dear Detective Inspector. Little Greggy. But if you don't care that much about him, I suppose I'll get rid of him as quickly as your landlady, which really is a shame because I do

"I'm serious, John!"
Sherlock said nothing but his head twitched as if he was trying to deflect the idea.
"And Anthea?" He was almost certain he had spoken now.
"I'm coming with you."
“Right.” Sherlock says, standing. “Back to London.”
"Moriarty was never the greatest threat to our happiness," John said, shaking his head. "I was. You were. We both are."
. Dark curtains muted the shaded lights inside, but sound spilled out into the cool air along with the sweet, burnt syrup smell of flower smoke and the sour, stale smell of spilt beer.
"What? Who?"
"Moriarty was going to kill you. In the end, I suppose he was better than me. I allowed him to slip past me twice like the little snake that he was and get to you. I allowed him to threaten your life twice."
“Do you think you can move?”
There's a short silence. Sherlock is waiting for John to realise something but John's not sure what epiphany he's currently supposed to be in the grip of.
Mikheia says nothing, absentmindedly running a finger along the rim of his cup.
“No, he’s fine, Sherlock, I can assure you. Perfectly whole, unmolested, and left alone, per both of your requests.”
But he remembers the ache in his shoulder as he woke up, something deeper than the tension of just sleeping with his weight it. It was pain. He felt pain. He didn't know why.
“A pleasure to meet you, Billy.” He smiled. “This is my sister, Harriet.”
He enters the parlour room and suddenly realises precisely why his phone hasn't rung.
"Just the bare minimum, Sherlock. Just the essentials. I know that you've never trusted anyone before much less loved anybody, but by saying that you love me, it means that you trust me and right now it doesn't seem like you do, so what conclusions am I supposed to come to?"
Sherlock stares at him and it is his turn to say nothing.
"And what of your guard dog?" He asked tightly. "Or should I say errand boy." The fool was following them a pace or two behind, and he could feel the red eyes boring into him from below the mask, the hair on his neck constantly on alert.
“Not by mortal standards—” She glanced up from her glass and smiled. “Ah, our most beloved immortal has awoken. How is his Highness feeling today?”
suffering, this
Sherlock stares at him for a moment then deftly takes the rag off John's face, wiping at the remaining water with his own hand, which somehow seems cooler in comparison. As he draws it away, John wishes it had stayed longer. Hell, he wishes he was at the top of Everest or at the bottom of the ocean if it meant coolness.
," Sherlock snarled quietly, "
It was all his fault.
It took all of five seconds for a swelling rage to bloom out of the cold realization that pangs in Sherlock's gut.
. Sherlock wanted to take that little flick of tongue into his own mouth, and to reciprocate …
. Sherlock should have seen this. But also ...
“Can you read this out loud to me?” He asked, feeling incredibly stupid, but … it was better than doubting his own mind …
In that second, John screamed himself hoarse …  Not caring what strength was asked of him.
He shook his head. Walking towards the hall.
It did not.
He had to hold himself back from jumping up to ask the Soldier if he was right.
While he was still … well …

He was bound and determined to have a lovely evening without this ghost of Christmas past hovering over his shoulder. He would tune him out. He would sit and observe. He would taste good food. He would just

Collecting himself?
Yes, he wanted a small family practice. Maybe a book to publish every other year?
It did not.
Sherlock felt a third deduction, but was not allowing it.
And then it came:
“And what did you imagine?” The man was still being mischievous, and trying for sexy, but it was just grating on John’s nerves.
. Oh this was Christmas!
He dried his curls into something more manageable and dropped a touch of scent onto his wrists and neck, before making his way casually back into the kitchen. Leaning on the doorframe. His silk robe tied loosely around his waist. Ready for the first time in his life, to offer ...

Some of the books used in reference were from Sherlock's own private library, and rare editions … So John found himself reading out the entire entry, "Hold on a mo', have that right here," to each; professor, doctor, researcher and analyst alike; as they checked in - honed in - on the finer points of Sherlock's research.
Thump Thump ...
How did you figure it out?
No mask. No lies. No stimulants needed. You are his stimulant. And he is yours.
It was no use cursing his broken shoulder for having interrupted the best thing he'd ever had. It seemed he did that rather well himself.
He felt the familiar adrenaline burn twist and wind itself through his body as he ran, his breath steaming in the cool night air. He still felt John's mouth pressed to his, and as mysterious as he found the appeal of kissing, he actually
Of course, that's nothing different because it's always a mess, but this is
Sherlock stared at him. He reminded him of John.
Sherlock nodded. A feeling of peace was overcoming him, nowhere near permanent, but enough for him to accept the totality of their conversation. They had gone both nowhere and in a full circle, excising the unspoken demons that had grown inside them and their relationship for years, a volcanic burst building until peak pressure was reached and it spewed forth, destroying as much as it touched but leaving the spaces clear for sounder reconstruction. He did not feel happy, did not know if happiness was something he could achieve again, but he was content. John was here, with him, and they were together like they were meant to be, however short it may last.
Think it through.
And John had obeyed.
“I’m not doing anything!!!”
that Sherlock would become bored. Of him. Specifically.
Sherlock took in a deep breath. Opening his mouth to say it clearly. What he had really wanted to offer:
John swiped his hands down his front, brushed his knees off, and checked the bottoms of his shoes. He was filthy. Covered head to toe in leaves and a bit of mud from the splash - a fight he had had with the ladder. His toes were a bit numb …

"I really am going to have a lot to keep up with in bed, aren’t I?” John teased, seeming heartily up for the challenge presented … and Sherlock growled a low rumble. Picking John up, bodily from the counter and carrying him up the stairs.
Did he really believe in it?
"John?" Sherlock tried again, truly worried this time. Crouching down in front of John and extending his hand to help John back up.
Mrs. Hudson had popped her head in the door a moment, “so sorry dears, I didn’t hear anything and wanted to make sure you were talking properly … but I see -” she stopped, grinning  at the pair of them intertwined, “it’s about time, dears." She chided good-naturedly. Liked she had always known it was bound to happen, and had just been waiting for them to catch up.

Sherlock paused to look the question to John, for approval, before going to see …
A cutting remark slipped out in his anger, “not really likely to

For all intents and purposes, he mused, she looked like she was ready to plan a heist with him,
His phone buzzed again immediately:
Sherlock gave John all of the room he needed. Keeping a few wandering pedestrians from getting near them even, in his kindness.
He already knew - the moment he saw Sherlock again, and felt all of the old feelings come back more intensely than when he left them on the shelf - what he himself wanted. What he had

Sherlock was fully awake, and alerted now, and pushing himself up with one arm, he came and swathed John Watson with his whole body. “What’s the matter, John?” Sherlock asked gently, with a penetrating look, searching. The weight of his body centering John. The concern of the fate of the world, in his eyes …

He made a whistling sound, "Of course he did!" alerting Sherlock to the level of awe he had inspired in John with this revelation.
Stepping up to that door, empty handed. Until his hand was on the door handle. And it was shaking uncontrollably from the exertion and exhaustion he had been through, as he went to push it open ...
The realization had come rather shortly upon meeting Sherlock. It surprised him, just as much as it had surprised everyone Sherlock knew

"I need a moment. And possibly a drink … " John was shaking. His hand would not stop. He gripped his arm. Stopping it. Sherlock saw.
Sherlock cared.
The morning light woke Sherlock this time. A soft glow that radiated into his comfortable, furnished, just-stepped-into-a-time-warp-room back at 221B.
In the gardening shed … ?

I helped the inspector solve the murder.
Then he let the jury rest there. It was only a thought experiment anyway.
Sherlock’s eye dashed back to the handsome stranger … to see him deflate. Eyes downcast again. A short nod. A military-like turn … and … he carried on.
“I’m not …  entirely sure,” John replied. Settling for honesty, “I think I just … need a moment.”
He shouted back, bringing the young man running to the table in response. "Do you have a notepad? Something I can respond on?" he asked, "I would be polite to answer." And taking up the pen and paper, he scrawled a lovely note:

John had chased down alleyways and hallways.
And when days, turned into weeks. And weeks, turned into months. And months, turned into a full year. And then, they had been celebrating their first ...  what?
John felt a sour feeling in his stomach at the thought again, too …  what was he doing? Marrying her?
he knew what they had meant to Sherlock.
Because Sherlock himself had been there before.
The pills. The window.
Dreams seemed a bit foolish. And Nightmares had become a reality.
He eyes you again with an appeal in the look. Almost inviting you to keep trying?
John wanted to roll his eyes.
John Watson
John’s mind immediately raced to Mary.
He was imagining the old couple, nestled together in their comfy tomb, arms wrapped around each other like the Lovers of Valdaro, merely skeletons now … Her in her pillbox hat …  He in his sharp bow tie … As he drifted off to sleep on the lyric, “but I don’t mind, when I have you next to me ...”
No food menu, like on all the other waiting tables. Not even a drink menu.
Mike had agreed to meet him for drinks after the rehearsal dinner, and they had hit a comfortable little backwater pub. John, grateful at last for some situation in which he knew what to do with himself. He ordered a tall stout and let Mike do most of the talking. He was now about three in.
John laughed at his own ridiculousness!
It all sounded soooo …
And this
In fact, Sherlock was turning his palm up, cupping his hand underneath John’s. Enveloping it into his own much larger one. Bringing the other hand up absent-mindedly as he examined.
Usually several had been docked at every jetty point they had passed.
When she left later, he noticed the bottle of pills had gone with her … and he silently thanked her for that mercy.

John wasn’t sure if he felt like laughing … or crying …?
But he
He grabbed at it with his right hand to make it stop. The buzzing, ringing sensation that had started in his ears, he silenced. Forcing himself to breath, deep breaths. His shoulders heaving with it. In. Out. In. Out. Calm. Deep. Concentrate. Calm.
John took a deep breath. Closed his eyes. Counted to ten in his head. Then he opened them again.
There would be no NEXT TIME.
He had almost forgotten about her cup.
No Holmes had appeared in his life. He was 37 years old.
"I'm fine, I think …" Sherlock … was looking a bit shaken. And staring at John.
With a passport. And two bags including all of the worldly possessions he currently owned.
The gondolier began singing. An ancient song of love and loss, and love again found. And John snuggled in. Listening. Just letting it take him. The shared body heat radiating between them underneath the warm covers.
She deserved it. She had saved him more times than he had saved her. Many times over.
He continued after a moment, “should I fail to comply with any suicide plans … Moriarty had some ...

John continued, "after I watched you ...    I ...  watched you …" John's hands were pointing accusingly, and he was starting to break down again. "WHY NOW!" He gesticulated, "Why HERE?!"
John felt himself warming all over.
John grinned then. As if saying ...
“Oh! That … Yes!” then John suddenly realized -

Dropping, "afternoon!" as closure.
John attributed it to a good shag.
Because Sherlock liked having John smell like him ...
John finds himself settling into a rhythm. And, strangely, against all odds, with Sherlock was increasingly at his side.

While the world screamed and tore out it's hair - a blur around him - John had stepped out of time into a void. Waves crashing against the rocks. And he was the rock. He stood unmoved. White noise drowning out all ...

He had experienced the loss ...
He let them free.
John screwed up his face as he tried to make sensible words out of all these letters …

Inasmuch as she hadn't named any names, John got the feeling that she was trying to hide that part of her concerns from everybody and to make light of it. Trying not to be a burden.

That was rather flattering actually.

John breathed a long sigh of release. Not even realizing he’d been holding his breath. Bottling up his anger. He shook it out. Watching the room empty. Spilling into the next one.
John sat thinking of the words that Sherlock could so have easily used:
He narrowed his eyes at the fake

“John,” Sherlock mumbled through kisses that neither could or would stop. Someone would have to come by to peel them apart if they expected it to cease anytime soon ... “how soon can I take you on our first date?”
It was like a vessel made to carry a bride and groom …
He watched John’s eyes trailing back upwards, to meet his own again. His head shaking, silently. Still trying to figure Sherlock out, as Sherlock finished his trek to his room and pushed the door open, disappearing behind it.
He thought he had ...
John sat up again then, looking Sherlock squarely in the eye. He was here. It was enough. If that was all Sherlock needed. Then he could provide it. Friday nights. Dinner.

Why was it always so easy … so inevitable … so irresistible in the end?

He regretted it a bit now.
He knew he only had a few moments before the chaos would begin. So he stood still. Enjoying the silence. Taking it all in.
Sherlock commanded himself NOT to smash the phone on the floor in his frustration ... instead he fired off another quick reply:
Then it stopped.
He had needed something to do. To occupy his time now. Outside of strict working hours. Not that he needed to work now. And not that he was being any more reliable at the surgery.
Mike slapped him on the back. Standing them both up, “Let’s get out of here, eh?”
He’d not known before. How addicting love could be.
Sherlock cornered him as soon as they entered the hallway and had started, just started … to remove their coats.
It had been exhilarating to go and do something.

The hollow sound that the door made as it hit the wall, reverberated through Sherlock's ribs and spine.
Long, gorgeous legs passed his line of sight. Trim, neat trousers. Striped. Wool. Hemmed. Posh heels. Polished Italian leather shoes. Glittering flats. Gucci Handbags. Gold rings. They were everywhere. He felt more underdressed than even the last time he'd come ...

"Know so," John picked up his water. Drank the rest as if the week might run dry and sat up. "So!" he slapped his knee, "when do we get to try what you've made tonight?"
Sherlock’s lips were pink, and they looked soft. He was biting on his lower lip. Making it redder. John hadn't let himself look too closely before. Sherlock's lips were really quite something.

Abashedly, he followed the young waiter as he passed through the double doors that had been mere feet away from himself this whole time and pushed through. The doors clacked behind him. There was a lot more going on inside the kitchen then one could tell from out in the dining area. The room was also significantly larger than John had suspected.
I promised myself I'd get this up today, and yesterday, and the day before that! And with two minutes of the day left, here I am.
“It’s a good thing it’s cold in here then,” John grinned, as Sherlock looked like John had just given him a Maserati ...

John willed himself to step out of the shop towards Sherlock’s waiting form …  just as two rather stocky individuals seemed to come out of nowhere and corner Sherlock against the canal railing. John saw a glint of something from the hand of one, and he immediately shifted into action.
… that this time … this time it had been real! It was real.

He rose to go but was already staring up at a pleasant young waiter. Much more smiley than he had expected. And he hated to disappoint the young thing.

Be real. Together … you two are far happier in all that you do, when you do it together. And he brings out the best in you, Sherlock. You saw it yourself. That’s another reason why you love him. You can tell Mycroft - he can take it up with
"Do you have a notepad?" he asked the new receptionist he noticed standing behind the counter. He decided to use gestures. "Something for uh ... taking down notes?" he added with a cheeky grin. Knocking her off-guard.
John rejoined to answer her question, this time letting rudeness creep into his voice, “Yeah, you know - I thought everybody understood
"... a bit different from my day."
Standing here.
He thought back on the last few ... minutes? How long had he been out? "Hey!" he called. A woman appeared, nametag and all from reception.
He bit his tongue. Waiting for John's reply. Sincerely unable to read what that reaction would be.
The desperation in his mind seeing clearly, that empty hotel room … those two neatly packed bags on his bed … and he the feeling surged further …
John was turning back to him, simple curiosity and casual defense on his face now,
?! DO you treat
In which, there is some reflection ... and only one conclusion to make ...
Will you do something for me?”
Wave upon wave of memory. A flash flood of trauma re-lived. But each time the story gets twisted;
Still on.
Weave in new habits.
Do you say things like that out loud?
a very different kind of game."
He felt corrected.
Not looking back.
To force her to find another target,
Thump Thump …
than a little drunk! The laughter rumbled and spilled over to something uncontrollable, until he was holding his side - and suddenly his ale - to keep it from sloshing all over him. Before he was able to get himself under control ...
John grabbed his jacket, and stormed out of the room.
That the Avengers - the billionaire, genius, playboy, philanthropist, Tony Stark - might have a solution! A way to bring everyone back!
tomorrow ...
Make Sherlock burn.
He took a minute. Flexing his fingers and working out the kinks in his neck.
Sherlock. And John. Alone. In their respective prisons.
He had stuck his head in - a curious intruder - to find a woman who had been beaten by her husband;
But they do, don't they?
Sherlock was touching his lips. Pink and a little swollen.
And here he had gone and...
, wasn’t he?
And I feel hollow ...
John knew he was giving her way too many benefits, for way too many doubts ...
and think
At the sudden interest in the detective, John’s blog had also spurred back to life again.
But John was dying to know -
Good brand. Fairly new. Engraved.
Curiosity. Amusement. Surprise ...
"Shower's free," he stated.
yours... " Watson surprised him, by continuing... "to do with as you will."
He had revoked the right for them to continue
Sherlock looked up stricken, "you knew?" Her guess hitting the mark.
And if you win, you’ll get my precious ring that’s made of gold ...
he assumed
John huffed in incredulity, "Always interested in you, Sherlock. Thought I made that clear this whole time?" He looked around as if they could be overheard by a fake audience, "Is there anyone else 'round here that I 'Can't Stop Bloggin' about?" he peered up at Sherlock with his own impish grin and winked.
John found himself smiling again. And saw Sherlock’s soft, shy grin in reply.
“You said Moriarty threatened us to get you to Jump?” John asked, “three friends? Greg, Mrs. Hudson, and I … to risk your life for? Seems a lot to ask. How did he know you would do it?”
Sherlock giving him as much time as he needed to process.
John slid into the booth that was now his.
“Holmes is a last name!” Harry supplied.
wanna know what I would do?” he asked. As they climbed in.
John lifted the cake to his mouth and opened it wide to …  what was he doing? Sherlock was unzipping his pants and ... !
"OKAY! Yes! I get it - I'm in the cab!! I'm -"
"he wanted to know if you'd ever had any girlfriends,
He would be back tomorrow.
And he cannot call them back.
In a way that might be considered
Now he had established a pattern … and it became a soothing habit … a fix even … each week.
John forbore with her now though, on the understanding that she was after something here that she herself did not appear to know, and was frustrated by. He wanted to ask whether Sherlock’s disappearance might have had something to do with
And then they had John too.
And this
think
He hoped John felt with every parting of his lips, how much he was wanted; with every flick of his tongue on soft skin, how much he cared; with every caress of his fingertips and palms exploring, pursuing, just how much he worshiped …  And how much more he would be willing, if asked. How much more he would devote ... to endure ... take down ... destroy ... to raze to the ground ... just to have him here. With him. Again. Night. After night! Here! In his arms! Coming back! Coming home. Coming.
He went on, “Mrs. Hudson I’ll admit, I look up to as a mother, and as I have stated before, I believe - I (London) cannot get along without her  … and …
Sherlock would respond.
Just         Black Widow         before him now …
None of John's coats.
? "yes, um ... thank you."
Sherlock dashed a looked back to her face, to see her smirk, “William Sherlock Scott Holmes, do you honestly think you’re the first man to have disappeared on me? I know the difference between suicide and running away.”
without even knowing
Making your own heart twist and stutter a moment.
To just
, with you. Wherever it lead. By your side."
He had shivered a little as he entered the restaurant, momentarily. Shaking off the cold and lifelessness that he had left behind in that hateful café. Sherlock must have seen. Sherlock must have been watching.
John thanked the merchant and pocketed the cord. Stepping towards the cold night air that rushed in. Realizing it had very quickly become nightfall.
Pleading … Hoping? …
But it was nice of Sherlock not to say it …
Sherlock spoke softly, as if not to break the spell,
But he was helping. He was doing. He was needed.
“And how often do you touch yourself?” John prompted.
By the time he detangled himself from his thoughts, he realized he was already a block away from the museum. He pulled out his phone to check for any messages from Sherlock and noticed the time was already 11 o’clock.
“Sorry, a lot has been going on lately, and you’re right. My sister doesn’t ask me what I would like for dinner, let alone how I’m feeling. It’s just kind of nice to have someone get it without all that explaining, and then the fear of being judged is gone.” He shrugged his shoulders and looked down at the table again.
“I didn’t know you like cucumbers.” John mused. Sherlock shook his head, pressing his cheek into his knees.
“With that attitude, we could have just stayed in bed like I wanted to.” Sherlock pouted. John gave him a look that made him shrink a few inches and a small gush of fluid drip out of his pussy.
“Thirty-six and thirty-seven respectively. The one on the right is not a natural blonde and then woman on the left has early grey streaks. They’re old friends. Highschool maybe, no. Sophomore year of Uni. They took an advanced biology class together and roomed the next year. They’re not dressed for a walk, they’re dressed for a lunch, indoors. A couples lunch. But neither of them have husbands, in fact, they’re both gay. No romantic relationship between them however, they are both pining after the same woman in the law firm they work at. It won't go anywhere, she’s married.”
