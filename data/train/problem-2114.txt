Sherlock knows. The penance he has set himself has been…harrowing. Perhaps John’s confession might seem to signal an end to it, but as usual – perhaps that is the only way for them? – they are getting tangled in anger and misunderstanding.
“Well...I don’t know. Um.”
John considers. On her belly, she feels safe, but she won’t be able to see, and Sherlock could only really reach her back, unless she rises to all fours, and oh
yourself, what is it you think I should say? Hm?” He looks inquiring, nothing more. Politely curious. His voice is brusque, businesslike. Cold. These are his weapons, and from John’s twitchy smile he can see he’s hit his mark. “Well? Assuming I already knew, assuming you’ve not told me anything at all surprising, at all remarkable. As you believe. So? Now what? What, exactly, are you expecting from me?”
“Well,” said Sherlock, trailing his fingers along his jaw, “Let me teach you.”
But now they were stood together in the sitting room in Baker Street, bodies close, foreheads almost touching as Sherlock bent, as his head dropped down out of sheer relief to finally,
“Oh, John, no, please, please don’t, I love this, I love you. You were, you were afraid, and you let me anyway. You were.”
nice.” Sherlock’s finger came to rest on the beaded tip of John’s breast and began to move in tiny circles. “You’re lovely.”
“Yep. And we did a bloody good job of it, too.”
The recognition hits him hard, right beneath his sternum.
“And you have to admit it was beautiful.”
“Ha. Yes. Absolutely. Of course. Look, Mary…”
Sherlock drew away and looked down at John, and his face was flushed and wild. “I’ve wanted...John. This is.” He stroked his thumbs over John’s face, ghosting them over his mouth. Placed a kiss there. “It feels like it can’t be real.”
He measures his pace down the stairs and thinks,
. You said it yourself. There’s no pain if there’s no one feeling it. You feel it, therefore you must be…Oh, this is
If he does not move, perhaps he will not lose this.
He was deployed the following week. Harry didn’t find out until just before he came limping home, leaving him with no place to stay and a phone that nobody wanted anymore.
In his mind’s eye, John was going to show himself to Sherlock. John’s fingers rose to the buttons of his shirt, and he began to slip them open one by one. This, too, Sherlock has seen, surreptitiously or directly, many, many times. Once the shirt was off, though, in a heap on the floor, he was in new territory. There was flesh here that he has never even glimpsed, and where he has, those glimpses have been fleeting, sidelong, furtive. Now, though, that flesh was being laid bare beneath his eyes,
The orgasm that was rising within her on the heels of her last climax was not merely strong, it was massive. It would overwhelm her if she let it happen;

might go better.”
And then John did, and Sherlock came, and came, and came.
“Yes.”
It is
John’s chin tilts, tries to follow Sherlock’s mouth, but he stills when Sherlock speaks. Eyes closed, foreheads touching. “Yeah?”
“There.” He gave a nod.
After that, it was…
It wasn’t difficult. Sherlock abandoned her reserve almost the moment their lips touched, or so it seemed to John, who had never successfully abandoned her reserve at all. Sherlock was open, and gloried in it. Accepted John’s kiss and her touch and her gaze as if she couldn’t get enough, with a courage and, and
A kind of sternness crossed John’s face. “In fact, I did. I did
When they came back together, it was with just as much deeply felt emotion, but overlaid now with pure desire. There was no shyness, nothing tentative, no sense that this was new, unknown, to be treated with caution. No, his mouth
He has never wanted like this before.
A ragged, panting breath, a drowning breath. His eyes did not open, nor his fists unclench. “Sher -” He stopped, tried again. “Sherlock.” A pained twist of his head, his face crumpling even further. His mouth.
Sherlock only stirs again after John has stopped counting his breaths, and even then it is only to move a hand, very slowly, until it is hovering just over where John’s fingers are spread against his chest.
It certainly was to John. He stared at his lap and willed this whole conversation to be over.
“I am. I am ready. I am. I want this.”
It means what

Well,
Sherlock was silent for a long moment. When he finally spoke, over John’s bent head, his tone was eloquent and his words were staggering.
And blame. He waits for the blame. This is his fault, after all. It always comes back to this.
There is a little silence.
. I want to be kind to witnesses and I want to save lives, there are a bunch of things I know how to do, that not everyone knows—”
“I want you, inside me, filling me up, taking care. Of me.” He swallowed, winced a little. “Loving me.” More. “Making love to me.” There.
“I’m. I’m okay.” There was something important to say. Something elusive. “I’m—John. Take me home.”

imaginable, that he is the one who must go and fetch John from where he has fled, and bring him back.
“John, I—”
and Sherlock’s anger has vanished, has gone, as if it never was, and the last of his walls has crumbled the the ground with hardly a sound.
But Greg said, “No, it isn’t bloody obvious. I don’t know what you get up to on your own time, but I don’t see the trouble with enjoying something like this if it happens to come your way, even if you think it’s Oh Oh Cee.” He emphasized the abbreviation just enough so that Sherlock would know that yes, he was doing it just to annoy him. Despite his discomfort, John spared him a small quirk of a smile.

Just in case, he spoke even more irritably than he normally would have. “What do you

People think.
Because now Sherlock was pushing her own legs apart, with no encouragement from John, and the movement allowed the lips of her vulva to just part. Sherlock was not wide open, not yet, but she was starting to emerge, to get slick and full. John knew what awaited her, though it was still hidden. There was a crisp of hair, and through it, a glimpse of pink.
His mouth, too, was soft. Soft and unrelenting, planting full, deliberate kisses along John’s shoulders, up his throat, under his ear, down his chest. John tilted and stretched, arched and pressed, presenting his skin to Sherlock’s mouth wherever that mouth might wander.
It did not mean getting dominated or controlled or being less of, of an agent. Needing coddling. Needing
He said, “Of course not.”
“All right, yes.
It didn’t mean anything. That couldn’t be clearer.

Sherlock needs, Sherlock
Sherlock still has not managed to breathe. He wants to speak - just John’s name would do - but he can’t fill his lungs. He does not seek John’s eyes but keeps his eyes fixed on John’s bare feet, the sides of them resting on the carpet.
And John asked what it was, because it was Sherlock and she could never not ask.
“Is there any food in? Anything at all?”
“I—oh, god, that’s—okay.” And here John quiets under his hands, despite this frenzy. His voice, for the first time since they left the pub, is calm. “All right,” he says. “Yes. I was, I was afraid. Not of you...but.” A deep breath, and a pause.
“Sherlock.
“I’m sure you’re right, John. For example, the fellow in the blue jersey with his legs wrapped around his…
“I can’t -”
“Oh, nice.” John whispered in her ear. “So...
“Oh.” Her breath came out in a small gasp. If Sherlock liked the delicate, barely-there touches of tongue, John liked the firm strokes, wide and messy. Noisy. She liked the sloppy slurps and the open-mouthed kisses, and long, broad licks that pressed and dragged.
There had never been anyone else in his life like this. There’d been sex, of course; it hadn’t been terrible, good enough to make it worth taking advantage of some of the opportunities afforded by good hair, a deep voice, and a piercing gaze, but nothing like this.
John dragged her fingertips up the seam of Sherlock’s outer labia, feeling the coarse hair, the silky skin. “Yes?”
One small thing, though. Sherlock frowned, seeking the words. “That wasn’t—”
“That’s...good. That’s very...good. I—I like when you do that.”
“I want you, John.” It came in a low voice, behind him.
(Sherlock wasn’t laughing now.)
John doesn’t usually look at him, though. Not like this.
Faster now, and tighter, urged on by the rising pitch of John’s voice and the way his hips are angled all the way up, giving little hitching thrusts with no rhythm or control. By the way his eyes are huge and astonished and locked onto Sherlock’s face, and by the way his cries bite themselves off as John’s mouth opens wide, unable to get a breath. “
“You can,” Sherlock murmured around her small mouthful. “I know you can. Let me - let it happen, love.”

The wanting had always been writ so large that it had been easy to ignore that other sly, sneaky little word, the tiny script wriggling itself in unseen, unbidden, between the lines. But here it was, waiting in ambush.
“No,” Sherlock agrees. “Nor did I.” The look they share is wry and affectionate. Warm. And something else, something Sherlock can’t quite name, but wants to.
“Shut up—thank you, but shut up. This isn’t easy, this is hard for me, but it’s

Sherlock's only had one orgasm so far, but in fairness, most of her body hasn't been touched yet. But John is on the job, and she's nothing if not thorough.
“I’m going as fast—hang on, hold still. Fuck.”
But his head had lifted
“Untuck my shirt.”
John wasn’t finished yet, though. “And this time, it meant that you finally knew it.”
It was wonderful. It was. It was intense and hot and gorgeous and

“You’re not blind. You can look at me and make one too.”
“Well, the sensations are more…immediate. You know right away what feels good. Less guesswork. In some positions you can completely control the movement—”
“That thing you did. That it would be so…”
because Sherlock was otherworldly like this, and Sherlock shuddered and shuddered and came.
John melted,
“Yeah, that’s...that’s good.”
Another sigh. “I don’t know why you bothered lying to him. Usually when you don’t want to do something you just say “no” and storm out.”
It was everything he wanted. He is too angry to say so. Also, whereas once he would have taken this gift any way it was offered, he does not want it like this. So John is right, in a way. Sherlock does not want this. Not this version, at least.

He didn’t want to say no. He was also

“Mmm.” John made a noise that he hoped struck a balance between highly affirmative and not at all needy.
. He wanted to kiss Sherlock forever, to slide their mouths together, the sensitive wet skin, and feel the textures in his mouth with his tongue. He wanted to trace Sherlock’s lips with his own, and breathe his scent, and taste his breath. He wanted, with his hands, to feel how the skin of Sherlock’s jaw was different from the thinner skin along his throat, and how the curls at his nape might become damp under his fingers as their kiss grew heated.
A rustle of fabric and a shift of the air warned John that Sherlock was moving, and he opened his eyes in alarm, in time to see Sherlock stepping right into his space, still with the same look of deep compassion. John felt his eyes go wide, felt the panic begin to bubble in his gut, and wondered frantically why he was still standing there instead of backing away, instead of fleeing altogether.
- so with his last shred of coherency, he reaches down and takes Sherlock’s slippery prick in his hand - it’s an awkward angle but he twists his wrist and gets his fingers wrapped around the underside and it doesn't matter at all because Sherlock practically levitates the moment John touches him and three strokes later he’s coming wildly and sucking hard and watching him John is seized by his own orgasm, locked knees shaking as he comes and comes and comes.
John 20:17 "Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father..."
He spoke slowly. “I need to be clear. You were terrified of this, Sherlock—no, you were. And now...you changed your mind, you said. Which you’ve never done before. And frankly, that’s bloody fantastic. If I’d known what it would do to you, I would have slammed some arsehole’s head on a wall a long time ago.” The questioning in his eyes belied the tough talk.

Like the second time, crowding him up against the wall by the bathroom door. “

“Nice?”
Perhaps this could work. If Sherlock was so openly placing her body under John’s touch, perhaps she wouldn’t notice...and John could

now. John had kissed him. Had grabbed him and growled at him and
Sherlock, though, had looked away from John’s face and was apparently riveted by the sight of John’s hands unbuckling his belt and releasing the button of his flies. His own hands had stilled, he’d only got as far as unhooking the fastening of his trousers, and he watched, avidly, while John’s hands worked at his jeans.
For the best, because John is looking at him with something like shock on his face. There are flickerings behind his eyes but nothing Sherlock can see the shape of. His mouth works for several seconds and then resolves into a smile. Not the good kind.
“Don’t have to. Hate 'em.”
Or later, his palm hovering so close over the bulge in Sherlock’s trousers that Sherlock could feel the heat of it, but
“—missed it. Of course I should have known you’d be

“Or maybe we were just wrong about what he sees as ‘others like himself.’”
A glance at John shows his jaw has tightened. He is trying not to fall back into anger.
“Yes, that too, if I have to. I don’t—it's not that I like all the anger, I don’t. I don't like the violence, I don’t like how I can’t say what I fucking mean most of the time—”
and let his vision clear. When he blinked and focused back on Sherlock’s face, he could see the same wonder reflected there. Sherlock’s lips were parted and his eyes, usually so sharp and inquisitive, were stunned and—he saw with some shock—a little wet. There was a moment where they stared at each other before John became aware that the flush on Sherlock’s face was one of arousal.
around Rosie, she deserves so much better, and you, too, you deserve—”
Please. Please say it.”
John was willing to be the one who was penetrated. He said he didn’t care either way. The easiest solution to Sherlock’s worries was for him to ‘top’. Nothing simpler.
“You're...upset?”
how Sherlock wants this to go. Not that he has ever thought this possible, but surely if the man you have loved more than your own life for years – and proven it time and time again – if he suddenly tells you that he loves you as well, surely blind rage is not the appropriate response? Part of him is wailing, is howling,  is screaming at him to cross the divide, wrap his arms around John’s waist and bury his face in his jumper, and weep and weep, and pour out all the answering words that have been suppressed so well for so long.
and the improbable, incredible words, falling one by one into his ears, into his brain.
“Oh.” Something cold and desolate pooled in his gut. “Oh.”
Um. Do I need to say it? Is it not a truth universally acknowledged that a fic writer, having published a story, or even just a chapter, must be in want of a comment?

and his tongue was still hissing the sibilant when John’s tongue glided in beside it. They’d kissed and kissed, John’s arms reaching up under Sherlock’s shoulder blades and crushing their bodies together as lips slid and tongues darted and sparred.
John blinks at him, his mouth opening slightly, his eyes going peculiarly expressive, as they do in those rare moments when the entire contents of his fiercely guarded heart become visible on his face. He draws a breath to speak, stops. Wets his lips and draws another breath. Blinks twice more. Another breath, but still no words.
“I want you to go to the window very, very quietly, and tell me if the woman with the feather in her hat is still outside the flat across the street.”
But Sherlock, far from turning to leave, held John’s eyes. “John,” he said. “John Watson. My friend, John Watson. John.” His searching expression transformed into one of unspeakable tenderness. “Do you really not know?”
“Yes. I thought you’d be angry. Or maybe...scathing.  I definitely didn’t expect…” His eyes flick to Sherlock’s, his meaning clear.
Sherlock rolled to his side and smiled at him, and the compassion in his face made John’s heart ache. He said, “I know what

the climax vibrating out from the epicenter, radiating into Sherlock’s thighs and belly into a blossoming climax of head thrown back and thighs pressed ever wider; then one that followed swiftly, almost of its own accord, with little more encouragement from John, thrumming itself out of a slick, full clit and a body straining against its own bounds to open

“That’s not like you, Watson.”
It was therefore perhaps not surprising when he made his mistake.
, when it was with John
The next moment they were kissing, and if nothing had ever been real before, this was real. This was real even if it turned out that their whole lives—not just moments of drawing away for the space of a scene or a case or a late-night conversation, but all of it—were merely written and played out in someone’s mind, on page or screen, imaginary. Pain, loss, lies, betrayal, hope, heartbreak...All that could be fiction, and this would still be real.
Until one day he stopped trying.
John stared at him for another long moment, and then took his hand away. (Sherlock barely avoided sagging, but whether with disappointment or relief he did not know.)
Sherlock blinks, and stares, and blinks, and stares. John has let her bind her wrists and has rutted herself to orgasm on her hand, on her arm, and this when she hardly ever lets anyone
“Jesus,” the murderer sneered from behind them. He’d picked up his partner’s gun and had it levelled at John, less than a meter behind him. “You don’t like it when people touch your toys, do you?”
John’s bed.
John had lost his courage and Sherlock his words. The world was ending. Everything had changed.
Clamping down on his rage he steps in close and grab two fistsful of John’s arse, and hears John gasp. He digs in with the fingers of both hands. “That’s how you want it, is it? You stick your arse in the air and I’m going to fuck it, yes? I’m going to fuck this arse.”
He speaks from his viscera. “
There was no way she was going to believe this. “You look…I missed you.” Not his first lie, not by a long shot.
“But it’s not now?”
Like a man.
“Is it innocent, John?” His voice is small.
“It is, it’s real,” said John, sliding one hand up Sherlock’s back to weave into his hair. He felt the softness of his curls, and caught his fingers on a tangle.
And suddenly John
“Why the hell can’t you do it yourself?”
, Sherlock wants to say. But at least John hasn’t said,
“Look, that wasn’t a challenge, okay?”
“Tell me to untuck your shirt.”
This kind of conflict was unacceptable. He needed to be able to follow where John led, or to say, rationally, when he did not wish to. John responded well to facts, to tangibles, to the

With one finger just resting on Sherlock’s clitoris, John pulled the fingers of her other hand through the pooling wetness of Sherlock’s opening, and then reached her moistened fingers up to rest on one peaked nipple. Two discrete points of contact, and hardly any pressure, but Sherlock tensed, and her breath caught, and:
and John shouted at the first brush of that hand.
John didn't know what Sherlock could see in his face, but what he saw in Sherlock's made him catch his breath, and set his heart to pounding in his chest. They stared at each other, and Sherlock's breathing was as unsteady as John's. Distantly it occurred to John that one of them would have to speak, but his voice was stuck in his throat and words were lost to him.
No more secrets.
“Not to—Sherlock.
“And there it is. Good.

do you want?” Sherlock’s biting tone was missing a few teeth. John’s heart
Sherlock gave a tiny flicker of a smile, a sad one. He said, “I used to think so too, once.”
The tremors in her body grew stronger, progressed to deep, shuddering spasms that shook her whole frame. The pleasure radiated from deep within her belly, spreading outwards in wave after cresting wave, mounting, mounting -
Then James said, “John.”
“Shut up. Shut up about that.”
John won’t—
Sherlock cannot ask him,
John’s right hand idly stroked the underside of Sherlock’s breast as she settled from her orgasm, staying well away from the nipple for now, and her left hand wove lightly through her pubic hair – keeping contact, but avoiding anything too intense.
John’s mouth has gone tight and grim, but he doesn't leave. Instead, he answers. “Yeah. It would. It would have made a bit of a difference in a few ways, yeah. I only, you know, got married. To–well. You know how well that worked out.”
“But when we talked about...this kind of sex, you said—about controlling, being responsible, taking care. You said it didn’t mean that. To you.”
At that, a curious look. “You do? What do you forget?”
“Please, John. This isn’t a whim. I need it. There’s something in my picture that’s
The very words he’d thought. The very thing he wanted.
He kissed him. With a gentle press of lips and a delicate slide of tongue, barely there. Compared to what they had been doing a moment before, it was tame, almost chaste, but something in the steady pressure of fingertips and the ferocity of the focus behind every discrete point of contact made it deeply erotic.
“He meant me, Sherlock. Could we not belabour the point? He assumed it would be you and me, for all that the, the
They sit for a moment, wide-eyed, staring straight in front of them, John’s head slightly lowered, Sherlock’s the barest bit raised. Sherlock hears John take a quick breath, and another, and marvels that he can hear him at all over the sound of his own pounding heart.
Bit by bit John becomes aware of another problem, too, as he rolls his body over Sherlock’s and reaches around him. He hooks a leg over Sherlock’s hips from behind, wraps an arm around his shoulders, and in the next instant he’s faced with a vision of the two boys in the park, and their radiant faces.
Sherlock nodded, shifted, made as if to rise, but John pushed her back down. “Oh, no you don’t. I’m still driving. Just hold still until I tell you.”
“No, this is really good. What else have you got here? John leaned in and tapped the mouse pad. ‘How to be a Better Bottom.’ I don’t know, Sherlock. Your bottom is already pretty terrific, if you ask me.”
An offering.
John, finding his volition at the last, grasped Sherlock’s face in both his hands, and they pressed their mouths together and breathed each other’s gasps and moans as they came.
. His fingers wrap deliberately around the handle to the kitchen door, and he thinks,
John is affected, he must be, or he would be swearing.
“What point?” Sherlock raises himself up, draws his head back, gives John
And Sherlock can look at John’s shoes, and try to hear what he isn’t saying. (That’s how they are, these days.)
Interesting. Refreshing. Pleasant. There were plenty of positive adjectives he could truthfully apply to each subsequent activity she chose, and by the fourth day he’d exhausted them all.

—on its own, and in where it could go, and in what, if anything, it might mean—and Sherlock never wanted it to stop.
. And he wanted John, wanted John to touch him, to bring him off.
John’s movements were slow, pressing all the way in before drawing all the way—almost all the way—back. Slow, and gentle, but firm, and purposeful. John, but increased. He grew taller. He

, Sherlock.”
John is hiding. It has always been maddening.
“That he should make it real,” he said, around a yawn. “It's better when it's real.”
It was the lightest touches that affected Sherlock the most when she was in this state, and John kept herself firmly under control. It was difficult not to dive right in as Sherlock’s thighs quivered and spread, but John knew if she let Sherlock’s pleasure build on its own, the result would be…spectacular.
“What I said. No. Wrong. I don’t see what you hide. I see what you show.”
“Yes, okay. I heard you. Just. Just.”
Sherlock huffs and scoffs in the general direction of the scampering youths. “That sort of nonsense. The noise and the rough play and their absolute conviction that they’re the only people in the park - in the world - of any consequence right now.”
They were silent for a time. Finally, John said, “I can hear you thinking. That’s never good.”
There was a little pause as Sherlock absorbed this. Then, “And what do you want?”
A beat, then: “I also didn’t expect us both to be here at the end of it.”
silk, slippery.
That John was attracted to him, all right. That there was...desire, perhaps. They’d been skirting that particular issue for so long and over so many iterations of their friendship. And now that they were living together again, it was bordering on inconceivable that the most observant man in London should not have even an inkling.
But all he does is stare, shocked. Shocked...and afraid.
No longer angry. “Weren’t we just passing the time?”
Here John opens his eyes. “What do you mean, no?”

So much.
“But I do know, John.” Sherlock adds another finger, letting the opening stretch wider than must be quite comfortable for John. (John will want a penance.) “You’re trying to tell me you know I’m a man, a man who takes you up his arse, and you don’t believe anything you’ve been told about men who do that, even if you can’t help thinking about it all when you
, it’s because of you.”
“And you know, too? That I, that I love you?”
John was taking exactly what he wanted, exactly how he wanted it. Which was exactly what Sherlock wanted.
Sherlock shows him kissing again, standing, then sitting, then lying close together. Kissing on mouths and kissing on faces, under ears and over stubbled throats. Lips and tongue and teeth, lapping and grasping and sliding and sucking. John’s mouth opens, his tongue flicks, his neck stretches – all for Sherlock.
. Sherlock already belonged to him in every other sense. He didn’t know about John, but for himself… “I—yes. You’ve already got everything else.”
“So being gay isn’t going to kill me.”
. Please. I want you to come in my mouth.”
“Like sprain people?”
Sherlock. As he has always done, in spite of everything.)
He succumbed, of course he did. No one could push John around, not even Sherlock, unless John wanted them to—and apparently he wanted it from Sherlock, because without having asked his brain for its advice, his cock was now fully hard in his trousers.
When Sherlock shifted his angle, John’s exclamations and gained force and lost coherence. He arched and thrust, moaned and writhed, and filled the air with wave after wave of blasphemy and profanity, which Sherlock knew by now was a Very Good Sign.
This time, though, he understood it. This time, everything was clear. Everything changed.
If John let go like that, she would fly apart, fly away in all directions, and there would be no one to bring her back again.
“Or—Oh. Love?”
this way and that, like tumblers in a lock. There is no way to tell if it will open.
Apparently it was. Everything followed easily after that. If anything was missing from that first conversation, well, there would be plenty of time to figure it out.
Because there was Sherlock’s erection firm against John’s hip and
John had said
“Whose writer bollocksed up our whole story, I might add.”
“Why not? I certainly can’t think—” Sherlock stopped dead. “Oh god.”
This, again. “No.” He has only ever been able to see
, John’s breathing turned to a rasping snarl. “I do, Sherlock, I bloody well do, I want, all right?
(If Sherlock said no, he could stop, he could do anything for Sherlock, not to save himself, but to save Sherlock, but Sherlock’s hands were pulling him closer and his hips were seeking, thrusting, pushing, and his voice was raw like silk and he was looking at John as if his only salvation lay in John’s mouth, in John’s body.)
(And Sherlock would shrink a little when he did, was already shriveling at the thought. It hurt, that John would stop, and the ache that he felt was not between his legs.)
John is momentarily derailed. “You were reading about relationships on the Internet?”
John knows that everything he’s feeling is beaming out of his face and he spares the space in his thoughts to note that he feels positively radiant, incandescent like the boys in the park, or more, much more - before he lifts his face to claim his kiss.
With Mary, all touch was a power play. He realises now that she laid hands on him as a way of claiming, of controlling. Even the most casual of contact was fraught with underlying meaning that he mainly didn’t grasp in its entirety but which he was still uneasily aware of. Sex was a complex series of negotiations that he would have been happy to avoid, would almost have not noticed how long they went without, but Mary took pains to ensure it happened regularly and apparently spontaneously.
“I, uh.” John shifted his body until he was securely straddling Sherlock’s lap again. “I don’t want to move.”
"You think I'm...?"
“God, no, no, it’s not that. I want to.
, John.” A long, deep thrust, held and then pushed deeper. Both men moaned.
quasi-experiences? Where the hell do you get this stuff?”
He could not stay focused. His thoughts kept reading like an instruction manual (touch here, press there) or a lukewarm adjectival play-by-play (this is
It was too much. That look, from those eyes. John would be utterly undone. He closed his eyes. “Know what.”
“You’ll have to be more specific than that, John.”
“Tell him what?” John asked.
Sherlock drops his last defense. "Perhaps you could sit down and say it again."
John gave a gasp that was almost a shout, and Sherlock pressed again.
They’re still on the floor. John crosses the space and settles beside Sherlock. Sherlock stretches his legs out in front of him to make room.
Sherlock takes his time unbuttoning his coat and letting it slide down his shoulders, hanging it up by the collar. He does not look away from John while he does this.
“Nothing!” John said quickly.
“Like a man.” His forehead still pressed into John’s shoulder blade, Sherlock’s glossy fingers sink a little deeper between John’s buttocks. “But John.” His fingers find John’s opening and flutter there, lightly. Skittering over the ridges there, swirling the slick. One finger, circling the opening, barely pressing. “John.”
His anger spikes. He bites down on any words, stifles any deductions, and glares.
All the while, Sherlock’s hand stroked and clasped, steady and rhythmic, bringing sensation but not chasing completion. He painstakingly refused to escalate, and John did not try again to push the speed. Instead, he took every slow squeeze Sherlock offered as a sort of gift, allowing his body to accept the quiet, inexorable bloom of pleasure.
If he could see John’s shoes, he could begin to deduce.
What is offered is accepted.
, Sherlock thinks.
But she didn’t leave off, and several drinks later when she finally
“Well?”
. I’m sorry.”
Then a bloom of clarity unfurls in his mind for how he can outsmart the obstinate words.
(See the end of the chapter for
John groaned, his arousal instantly right back to where it had been,
“Stop it. Fucking stop it. Jesus. It fucking killed me. Don’t pretend, don’t pretend you don’t see.”
“All right, you’re all right.
Sherlock’s eyebrow twitches.

He’s done his best with what he knows. He can feel the wrongness of it, but has no idea how  to fix it.

“No, that’s—you

Sherlock didn’t manage to hide his jolt of reaction this time. “I assumed it would be what you wanted.”
mouth—with a hand on his jaw, and slid his tongue deep.
John went on. “The physical side of you. Touching and kissing and whatever else you want. We’ve already—” And here John did hesitate a little. “That is, I think we’ve already got everything else. Haven’t we?”
She had plans for her own pleasure, but now –
to make. To
It wouldn’t work, though. Not with John. His relentless demands for permission were surely something connected to the importance of consent; Sherlock had been able to figure that much out on his own. He required an explicit
“No, no, don’t, don’t go. Please, John. You just, um, you just got here.” Sherlock huffed a little laugh, but his voice was pleading.
He’d already begun to see that when his body was intimate with John’s, his feelings became much more difficult to conceal. That was the kind of exposure he feared, when he was so unsure of John’s response, when there was every chance John would not want to see all that Sherlock wanted to show him… No, it was much too dangerous.
John laughs at himself, using the word. “But it was.”
(Nevertheless, there was already a picture in his mind, fully formed, glittering with clarity:
knows?”
Sherlock said,
“I—” Sherlock blinked. “In fact, you said that none of it means anything at all.” He willed John to understand what he was asking.
John looks on in awe. John, who has grown used to making love to a Sherlock who still distrusts his transport and still resents being dependent on it, would stay all day like this, carrying out a ceaseless rhythm of lean, drag and circle, if Sherlock is going to thrum under his hands and groan out his ragged pleasure.
Well, he’d known it. When he sighed, though, Sherlock misinterpreted his irritation. “Well?” He gestured with the phone. “If I do it, he’ll know I don’t actually have laryngitis and he’ll make me complete that interview. Tedious. Ring him back and tell him it was the painter. The one who did the mural.”
John has stepped directly from the wreckage of his life into the sitting room at 221B and if Sherlock looks closely (and Sherlock always looks closely) he will see the cinders and debris settling all around John, on his jumper, on his trousers, on the carpet at his feet and on his discarded shoes.
His eyes rolled shut.
Sherlock couldn’t deny it. “No.”
“What?”
The fight had gone right out of John, but he protested faintly where he lay. “It was you, it was you. You did that. You kept—everything you did was for me. You kept saving me, and I kept hurting you. It’s all I’ve ever done.” He glanced up into Sherlock’s face, wondering how the genius could have got it so wrong.
No, it is absolute blind, seething

of the man was so...real. John could not stop thinking that word. They held each other tightly, lips still pressed together, and breathed, and breathed. Sherlock had muscles, and lungs, and a ribcage,
And suddenly Sherlock cannot bear this. There are a thousand ways for this to end in disaster, even if John meant it, even if John has the first clue - unlikely - what he is actually sorry for. Sherlock cannot just sit and wait to see what John will say next, not if he wants to maintain his own...he rejects the word

“No? That’s what it amounts to.”
“Is that...bitterness?”
“Not anymore? Nothing has changed. What happened stays
A questing mouth, a desperate moan—Sherlock knew they wouldn’t be enough but he tried anyway, letting his lower lip gape prettily, soft and wet. John saw, and his eyes darkened, but he was not taken in. “Where, Sherlock?”
They’re wrong, of course. They so often are.
“Your hiatus?” A euphemism, without bitterness. John is being kind.
sure he deduces correctly. If the laces are very tight, it is more like a guess. (He does sometimes guess.)
John takes some risks he didn't sign up for when he joined the army.
Sherlock’s right hand becomes more insistent now, the pads of three fingers slipping and circling over the furrows of skin at John’s opening. Tickling and twisting, swirling and slithering, letting the movement both soothe and sensitise. He keeps up his glides and wriggles until he feels John draw and release a deep, deep breath, and his shoulders relax. His body rests a little more heavily on Sherlock’s arm.
A determined silence was his only answer.
“Up you come,” she whispered, and John swung her leg up and over until she was straddling Sherlock’s shoulders.
(This John, though, does not let the shirt pool on the floor, but folds it and lays it on the seat of the breakfast chair.
The other – maybe John? – doesn’t know. He really doesn’t, anymore. Instead, he asks, “Well, why didn’t you?”
Was it really this easy, after all this time? John saying
His doubts were both eased and increased when he became aware of Sherlock’s warm, broad hand gently stroking his back, and his soft mouth pressing kisses to his temple.
Hand on head, head on knee, hands on feet. Breathing.
It’s new.
“Honestly? No. I’m not really sure of much. Just, like I said, that I love you, and you make me. I mean, you make me want to be that person, you know? That real person. You make me want to be who I want to be.”
“You are
It was safe to bare her throat and let her whimpers come unabated; it was safe to open her mouth and meet Sherlock’s tongue with wet, untidy swipes; it was safe to let her own arms lie, palms up, slack and passive at her sides, and spread her thighs wide; and when Sherlock trailed her fingers down to her slick and blossoming vulva, it was safe to rut and thrust against her hand.
And John has gone stiff, has utterly frozen, his breath is caught, his throat is tight, he has turned to wood in Sherlock’s arms.
I want
; there was no time. He had to get the taste of Sherlock all through his mouth, inside his cheeks and onto his tongue and between his lips, and he had to bury his face as deep as he could between his thighs, and breathe only that scent. He sucked and swallowed around Sherlock's hot prick, again and again, chasing the thick fluid, slick, that seeped from the tip,

thick with disdain. (He used the word as it was the correct term for the context and he liked to be precise, but he objected to neologisms on principle. John wasn’t a huge fan of them either, but he used them considerably more often than he otherwise would have, once he realized how they annoyed his friend.)
. It was no less frightening for all that John loved him, and he now knew it.
“Everything all right?”
but he means it now. The realisation makes his mouth twitch.
And all the while, John’s intense gaze, John’s firm hands, gripping his thigh, John’s steady thrusts, John’s strong, strong body in complete control of every staggering, shattering, crushing sensation. John, terrible and dire and
“It made sense at the time. To remind me not to, not to…” John’s hands close into fists, his eyes squeeze shut and his head twists to the side before he finishes. “Not to hide.”
“Well,” said John, brightening. “Can’t be worse than that. Any other specifications?”
“What did I do wrong?”
“I don’t - I don’t know this trick.” His voice is a little breathless. John can’t see his face.
Even after his breathing steadied, it took John a long while to come back to himself. It was lovely, there on Sherlock’s shoulder, and if he stayed very, very still, perhaps the moment would never end, and he would not have to look Sherlock in the eye and face the aftermath of everything he’d said and everything they’d done. Now that the glow of his orgasm was fading, he felt a trickle of humiliation and no small amount of dread.
“Because they’re precisely the sorts of louts who would deny it to their last breath if anyone commented, and likely land a punch on anyone who was admitting it too freely, despite their seeking every possible pretense to touch their fellows in as intimate a manner as possible.”
Sherlock settles in. He does not expect John to speak soon, or quickly, or to say what he means without a great deal of stuttering.
“Yeah.” Here John pauses. Sherlock knows he finds this difficult, and his anger and defiance – which would have helped him get the words out – appear to have gone. “It was meant to, what I wanted to say, it was meant to be…” He glances at Sherlock from under his brows, looks away. It seems he can make eye contact or speak, but not both at once. “It was meant to be a, a gift.”
“I…what?” Sure enough, the lad in question has at least half a hand shoved inside the other boy’s shirt, and his legs are locked at the ankles. He looks radiant. They both do. “Oh.”
, Sherlock’s head snaps up.
Sherlock stroked, stroked. His grip was firm, not hard but steady, unwavering, working towards its goal. The rising tides of pleasure took all of John’s attention so that when he realised Sherlock was talking, he wondered distantly when he had begun. Even once he noticed, it was hard for him to make out the words; whispered exclamations and endearments, perhaps,
Sherlock never quite relaxed when he was topping John, so determined was he to make it the best possible experience for him. And bottoming never quite lost its edge, either. John was always a little unpredictable, and looked for ways to challenge Sherlock’s expectations, so that Sherlock could never entirely relax, for all that he knew he was safe under John’s hands.
It was inevitable. Sherlock does not argue.
So there she was on the bed, eyes closed, and any touch from John would make her vibrate like one of her violin’s strings.
“Yes, all right. Go on. Anger, violence, emotional constipation…?”
John looked straight into his panicked eyes and let one finger come to rest precisely in the centre of the opening.
But, look, I know—It’s a lot, okay, I know it is. A lot for me to spring on you all at once. It’s just—where we go from here is...whatever you want, all right?”
John, in so many different situations and attitudes that there is almost nothing left to be discovered here. (Always only almost.) John looked like John always looked.
John looked down at his hands. “No one...waiting?”
“You didn’t object when I mentioned it.”
Only then did John push his slick cock back between Sherlock’s lips and thrust and thrust—hard, too, no more holding back, hard and rough—into the back of Sherlock’s throat until he came with a rasping growl.
He has found his voice in earnest now, and his moans and cries punctuate the slip and squeeze of Sherlock’s hand.

At least John’s pleasure seemed to be…well in hand. John was showing every sign of prodigious well-being. Head thrown back, voice deep and ragged, John pressed his body back at an incredible angle—admirable for a man of his age—and rocked his hips enthusiastically in time with Sherlock’s thrusts.

It was all so...
A gift, those words, those precious words,
And as soon as he says it, he can laugh. It was a ridiculous notion, after all. He dismisses it completely as he wraps his arms around the man he has studied for so long, and whose love and desire will never again be only a vision.
Burying his nose in John’s hair, he wraps his left arm more firmly around John’s chest, deepening his thrusts at the same time. He reaches around with his right arm as well, so that the whole weight of his torso lies across John’s broad back, and John is supporting them both with his knees and his grip on the headboard.

ask. I did nothing more than touch your neck before I asked.”
,” John hisses. “Jesus, Sherlock.”
“Tell me, sweetheart.”
“Ooh, Mr. Romantic. Sweep a girl right off her feet.”
For a moment he thinks John won’t follow him. From the ragged sound of his breathing, Sherlock knows John’s face is pressed into the mattress. He doesn’t look around, but he can feel John’s seething frustration and, through it, his confusion.
Sherlock always took stupid risks. This was no exception.
“Laughing? No. But definitely, definitely smiling.”
Something in his tone made John finally take notice. He gave him a long look. Finally he said, “It’s up to you, of course. But you remember what I said, right?”
The word surfaces, unbidden in the rising warmth of their bodies.
“You want…?” They both want.
“You really want to know?”
He crawls back to where Sherlock is standing fully dressed by the door, grabs his hand and slaps the bottle firmly into his palm, closing Sherlock's fingers around it.
“That’s…a lot.”
“I’m never stupid.”
“Good.”
Still, he does not want John to answer, now that he knows what the answer must be.  The words are out, though, and he can’t call them back. John will say it, and

from Sherlock’s touch that that’s what she was doing...but even then she only smiled sheepishly and made the excuse that she was pre-menstrual and her breasts were sensitive, and Sherlock was relaxed enough not to question it, even though John had had her period the week before.
When Sherlock finally wraps his hand around John’s erection, the two of them are moving in such perfect unison that Sherlock thinks for a moment he feels the warm pressure of his palm on his own cock. A second later he realises, dimly, that it must be John’s body he feels, tightening around him in response to the squeeze of his hand. He doesn’t need to move his hand, only to hold it still, as the movement of his hips pushes John’s cock deep into his fist.
, like a man.”
“Good then.” She nestled back, smugly, into the pillows. “Now. Your wife has needs. Get in here and see to them.”
It was the biggest lie of all, but she only smiled as she drifted off. “I do, yes,” she murmured, chilling him to his very bones, as in her belly his daughter turned over against his side.
Sherlock wrenched his mouth free. “John,” he gasped, and stared at him, eyes wide and darting, searching John’s face. His breath came quick and erratic.
But John turns and looks up at him and it’s like the sun rising, all delight and shining adoration.
“John.
“I know you don’t.”
“The what? The

“No, John.” Sherlock settled his head back onto John’s chest, planting a kiss as he did so. “I was

“So they don’t go flying when you flex your pecs to look sexy.”
“What.” If John looked up, he would reveal everything. Instead, he revealed everything by not looking up.

and I’d be halfway out of my chair and then you’d finish the sentence and it would be something stupid.”
Then a long lick from between the inner lips to the very tip, long and wide, firm (not ticklish), and another, and another, Sherlock’s hips rising with every pass, so that when John made her lips more solid now and closed them around Sherlock’s clit and
A moment later the Kiwi guide confirmed over the loudspeaker that yes, it was a humpback whale, and that it was very special indeed to spot one on a tour, especially this time of year. Sarah looked up at John at this news, beaming.
John hesitated. “You just seemed…strained.”
It is irresistible, and John gives in, lets Sherlock set the pace, lets him drive John’s cock deep into his throat again and again.
“Right. So there’s a
, and this was not to be wasted. “So what did this mean, today?”
“I—oh. Well, good.” Sherlock gave him a smile, brittle but genuine. “But we could move, if you want, to the sofa or the, or the bedroom..? Whatever you want.”
John sighs. “It’s all right, Sherlock. You don’t have to, to, to…spare my feelings. If that’s what this is. It’s fine, and I can’t blame that for my bad choices. I know, all right? It wouldn’t have made a difference to you at all. I know. I’ve always known.”
He watches John carefully. At first glance, he appears to still be frozen, but as Sherlock watches, he can see that John is trembling, almost imperceptibly. His eyes, still wide, are brimming now, with unshed tears. His hands twitch in his lap, and the trembling turns to shudders.
“John?”
“Oh, god, me too, I love this, this is, this is,” but somehow Sherlock has managed to slide her other arm under John’s shoulders, to shift their bodies so that now she can get one hand on each of John’s flushed breasts, and closes her fingers, around both of John’s nipples, which she then slides between thumb and forefinger, back and forth, and John’s words are cut off in an incoherent cry.
a glint of a breath and a twitch of a clit, and then still, until the next spark. Slight. Small.
This was more terrifying than he could possibly have imagined.
squarely on his own shoulders.
“No.”
Sherlock helped her down, in the end; Sherlock, who had carried her up to a towering, soaring orgasm, that John wasn’t even sure she could have, but she had it, she had it because Sherlock was there to carry her, to draw it out of her and then to catch her, to catch and hold her and carry her back to earth;
It is not a chasm, though it has appeared to be one many, many times. It is small.
“I’d...like that.”
“It is, though. It is. It fits. All the bits we felt were off, all the—”
No sooner had the last shudder of John’s orgasm subsided than Sherlock’s lips closed again around her oversensitive clitoris, and her tongue pressed, and she sucked again, hard. John’s hips bucked and jerked, and she slammed her hands against the wall for balance. It was, it was -
“It’s not—I don’t—” John is sputtering now, choking on his own rage.
John allows his fingers to curl around the bulge in Sherlock’s trousers, and he glories in the sharp intake of breath it elicits when he does. “I’m offering.” A thought strikes him, though, and his hand stills. “But, um, not just…not just playing, Sherlock. If I’m offering, if you take it…it’s not pretend. It’s not just…” Oh, god, to have come this far and now…
“Mmm?” Sherlock perked up at this and made an attempt at opening her eyes.
“A one-shot.” John thought for a moment. “Single chapter, usually a few thousand words…? Is that what she was trying to do yesterday?”
Sherlock can’t let his guard down until after John has left, and John cannot leave without his shoes. Sherlock wraps his anger around him like a coat and hunkers down to wait. He does not know what John will do.
Sherlock had begun to make delicious little noises as John worked, little gasps, little not-quite-words,
But there he is, as speechless as ever.
“What? Purple? Flaccid? Toothed? I don’t know –
Apparently, John felt that they already had was straightforward and unambiguous. Easy. Comfortable.
A breathy chuckle. “Not at all. If. If you’re offering.”
Sherlock hears John curse under his breath. He sits on high alert – for John to be thwarted when he is already so angry can only be a bad thing.
, he thinks. It’s so sweet. It is not a word he is used to thinking.

Sherlock is getting desperate, and John still hasn’t answered.  Embarrassment and exasperation both give way to
There is a low chuckle. “Yes, you are.” She clambers ungracefully onto her knees to reach the knots.
They share a small smile. This new knowledge should shake both their worlds but they find, here, that it just settles into place around them. Perhaps because it is, in the end, utterly unsurprising.
They sit there, stuck. Both with their bared soles on the rough surface of the carpet, and neither with anything to say. Sherlock feels he should speak, should say something. As if, as if it’s his turn. John has already said so much. But if he thought that uncovering his feet would unstopper his words, it seems he was mistaken.

“It’s...obvious.”
“Good.” Sherlock removes his hands abruptly, steps back. Ignoring John’s startled intake of breath, he turns and walks to the door.

Finally: “I don’t know what to do.”
. John counts them, as each one tickles her neck. Then her lips barely move but she whispers, “Thank you, John. However this turns out, thank you. This kind of trust is...difficult for you. You could have just asked me to leave it, and instead you’re offering...this.”
Tonight, Sherlock is alight with it. He’s sure to overstep.
John remembers how it was to be those kids. All of those kids, gambolling like so many puppies, and those specific two boys, seeking what contact they could find and glowing with it.
, it was certainly
“Sherlock.” No interrogative.
“What have you got hold of this time?” John’s voice was also languid. Idly curious, no more. Not...troubled. Not at all.
Eventually he reached the conclusion that most kinds of touch, if bestowed by him, would be unwanted anyway.
, although he was. Too telling. But, “Extraordinary.”

He stood by Sherlock’s chair at the table, looked at him for a moment to confirm that this was permitted, was, indeed,

“Yeah.”
They moaned together, but when John started to rut into the pressure, Sherlock stilled him with a touch on his hip. “Shh, John. I want—slow down. Let me…”
“You were quite extraordinary yourself.” John smiled. Sherlock smiled back. It was all a little foolish, but it made John drop the subject.

“I should have told you. I thought you knew. I’m sorry, Sherlock.”
Abruptly, the mood feels…different.
Sherlock shows him sounds, his own sighing breaths and heartfelt moans at being allowed to touch and kiss, and the ones he draws from John with mouth and hands. John moans into his mouth once, deep and rich.
“But...it was

He could not focus on that sensation when there was a hand pumping his prick and the slick glide of a thumb over his slit,
“How can you be sure?”
Under Sherlock’s soothing hands and beseeching tone, John subsided a little. It was awkward, though, halfway off of Sherlock’s lap, and all the way hard. He shifted uncomfortably, cheeks flaming.
It started well. He was safe, comfortable, at ease on the sofa, John engrossed in his book, physically present but occupied. It was time.

Sherlock is completely unprepared and deeply, deeply shocked.
“A one-shot.” This time with sparkling diction, though John thought the original mutter had been slightly longer.
When they felt the pull, a few minutes later, that strange, half-imagined tug of the fic being written, it was the easiest thing in the world, to just...not. They let the feeling wash over them, past them, and John felt the precise moment when the choice passed away from him to...some other version of him. Some other John who wanted this, and some other Sherlock.
They hadn’t discussed this. But in the stuttering, strobing landscape of his mind, Sherlock supposed it ought not to come as a surprise to find John’s fingers circling his arsehole, since surely two men having sex might be almost
She hasn’t had that thought with this clarity before. With some effort, she says again, “Is that poetry?”
Something deadly settled over John’s shoulders like a mantle. “You are one sick motherfucker.” His voice was more dangerous than Sherlock had ever heard it, but his words were exquisitely enunciated. Sherlock saw a flicker of fear in the suspect’s eyes as he stared down the barrel of John’s cold fury.
“So…” Sherlock was reasonably certain he understood, but John was being forthcoming, was completing sentences, was completing sentences
There are still so many things he doesn’t know. John has unburdened himself, has uncovered himself, sufficient to tell Sherlock how he feels, to offer Sherlock his heart. But it is impossible to ignore the reality, that there around John’s bare feet his life lies in ruins.
“John.
“Well, you’re certainly not
And here was everything he wanted, opening up for him. Sherlock’s
Being on his knees with his mouth stretched around Sherlock’s cock did nothing to diminish his...power. This is what happened when you thought you were safe with John Watson.
“Yeah,” said John, “It is.” He settled his head back under Sherlock's chin, and went to sleep.
“Is it...? Are you sure?”
It is pure pleasure, and John has no choice but to feel it wholly.
When John finally drew his fingers away from Sherlock’s ready opening and stood before him, Sherlock could barely drag his eyes open, and he gazed at John with heavy lids.
He does without. He’s good at that.
“Where.” He swirled a thumb through the slick drop and brought it up to his own mouth and
“It’s just.” John, after that incredible speech, is not finished. “It’s.” Or maybe he is, at least with the complete sentences. He looks back at his hands, which are clasped again, as his elbows rest on his knees. “I’m sorry for this, too. Springing this on you. If I’d known you didn’t know, I’d have let you stay...I don’t—I thought I knew, I thought I’d—Now I don’t—god, this seemed like such a good idea. I don’t know how to finish this.”
But he hadn’t given it much thought.
“So?” Sherlock really was nearly asleep.

He took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and looked at John. The John he has built in his mind, over a long, long time.
Which was ridiculous, because John, like this, was terrible, was

scratching the raspy fabric of his trousers into John’s bare skin. “You want me to give it to you. There was an arsehole in the pub and you’re going to show him, show me, show everyone that John Watson knows what it means to be a man. You’re going to
“I think you should stop worrying, Johnny. How does this feel?” Warm press of round body, hips tucked up against his.
Sherlock could almost see it, the way John grew bigger. His shoulders squared, straightened. His chest rose, his body…
A look had crossed John’s face, and Sherlock had
In the dull grey light of the winter dawn, John stood outside the row of houses and stared at his own front door and missed the war all over again.
If John knew how much Sherlock meant by that, the game would be up. But how could he be here, with his arm around John’s waist and his prick inside him, how could he plant little kisses down John’s back, and love him and love him and
Sherlock doesn’t know where all these words are coming from. He does not normally talk or heap praise on John during sex (or ever), but John does—perhaps to drown out the ugly words in his head—John heaps sweetness upon Sherlock as he fucks him, and John is a man, that’s what a man does, so it is right that John should kneel there and take Sherlock’s rushing stream of loving words.
, I didn’t mean to say that, but I do, god, I do.” The last words came out as sobs and there was nothing he could do to call them back.
Well, he couldn’t stand out here and wait for the sun to rise. He squared his shoulders, sniffed once, and opened the gate.
And now Sherlock has come up to John’s bedroom (where John is ploddingly putting his socks away in a drawer- folded, but not indexed), and has laid himself naked on his back, crosswise, with his head and arms hanging a little over the edge, so that his torso is stretched and taut and every line is visible.
, the expression on his face. The little mouth, turned down at the corners, tight, thin, lips pressed together. The brows drawn low, in what would be a frown, but for the eyes, so wide, so shocked
But the

you, and not daring to. I’ve been so afraid for so long, Sherlock. And I don’t look kindly on cowardice. So I had to ask.”
“I did not!”
Although Sherlock, in his consternation, has lost sight of the simple fact that drew his attention in the first place, John is still barefoot. His shoes are beside the fireplace.  He steps onto the bare boards of the stairwell and stops.
Risking both, each time, until – inevitably – both were battered and compromised.
“He’ll ask how you know.” John did not reach for the phone.
“No, that’s not—”
The first slow lick had John bearing down, and the wet slide of generous lips had her moaning wantonly and rocking her hips into Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock tightened her grip on John’s arse, squeezing in time with the swipes of her tongue and guiding the movement of John’s hips.
Bit by bit, their mouths have opened to each other, their tongues have touched, and slid, and tangled. Their hands have roamed over backs and shoulders and into hair, and even – most welcomed, after John’s first startled reaction – arses. Their bodies have drawn closer and closer together, stood as they are in the middle of the sitting room, until chests were pressed into chests and bellies were flush against one another and feet were slotted in between feet and hips aligned, and
They will not. Of course they won’t. They will need more talking, it is inevitable. Parsing their meanings, defining their terms. When Sherlock says
It is remarkably like his vision. The slow rise of his hands to his top button, the methodical unfastening at each discrete point, top to bottom, right wrist, left wrist. The slide of fabric on skin.
Much, much later, worn out and sated and drifting lazily to sleep on Sherlock's chest, John had a hazy thought that made him startle himself awake with a laugh.
“Yes. We both do. Improbable as that may be. So I don’t see how we can doubt that we are...that we
Later, James came to see him in the hospital. He stood erect at John’s bedside, and spoke to him. He was...
“That was—” But John has no words for what it was, so she just smiles again.
“What now?”
He said, “You’re gorgeous.”
You want to feel it? I’ll make you feel it. When I’ve, when I’ve
It was...soothing, being touched by Sherlock. Not mad or frenetic the way he would have thought,
“Because I suddenly had the feeling you’ve been holding back, too. For a long time I thought it was just me. But I thought…maybe you wanted what I want.”
So Sherlock shrugs to himself, and paces across the room. He takes a breath and sits down. Only then does he allow himself a glance at John’s shoes.
) and ran her palms down the smooth skin.
It took a few false starts—he’d never had to accommodate a pregnant belly before—but in the end they found a way that worked, with her astride him. She took her pleasure from his body, and he only needed to hold her up, and push back against her, and it was fine that his eyes were mostly closed. And if, when he approached his climax, his short thrusts were harder than he meant, and if the sound he made as he came was more a howl and a sob than a moan, well, it had been a long time for them.
The scene filled Sherlock’s eyes as he gazed unseeing at John’s watchful face. There it was, the vicious wrench of clothes and the wet smack of bodies on bricks. The ugly taunts, the spurting blood, John’s rage
Sherlock loves John with his whole heart and his whole self. There is not a moment in the day when he does not wish to fling himself at John, to pet him or caress him, to squeeze his shoulder or snuffle through his hair. He wants it with the same abandon he felt as a child, as if years upon years worth of lessons have taught him nothing at all.
They didn’t want him to go, his parents. They’d liked his last girlfriend, more than the rest. They’d hoped that she’d be the one who would shake him out of his crazy ideas. (“The army, John? For heaven’s sake,
Plot no
“And don’t you look pleased with yourself.”
They were already so close. Two bodies, not quite touching, but John’s eyes were closed, tight, squeezed shut, as a man does who is expecting a blow he can’t deflect, or an explosion.
Mockery, at least deliberate mockery, meant to hurt, was not Sherlock’s style at all. His wreckage was usually unintentional.
The layers of John’s meaning show in the unfolding of his face. It is a moment before Sherlock can respond.
A little.
Sherlock is waiting for the deductions to fall into place. He knows John is there, and for how long, and he knows there is something -
—will hang down, slack, one flopping onto the other, and her belly too...no.
is so absurd to you that it didn't even cross your mind. Forget it, all right?”
“I – ” He gives a short laugh. “I know your methods, Sherlock. I’ve made a rather obvious deduction.”
All the while, John kept up a steady stream of endearments and praise and profanity, uttered low and rough.
Sherlock’s cock - still untouched - lies red and shiny on his belly, leaving slippery smears through the short hairs that lead down from his navel.
Everyone always thinks that Sherlock is the serious one, given to taking offense, eschewing the silly, the preposterous, and often wrong-footed by spontaneous laughter. Of the two (and they are always taken together, compared only to one another, so impossible is it to consider them separately) John is easier, heartier…
The buzzing feeling makes a space for Sherlock to take a breath. “It’s no concern of mine what you believe, John.” The feeling is clearer now. He feels he may light on the name for it in another moment. “You didn’t tell me.”
Incomprehensible. “How could it possibly be

Of course, that meant that there were two more attempts later in the trip until she mercifully stopped trying.

thought Sherlock. And also,
Eventually he would have to wave John off on dates with women who were better at this sort of thing than Sherlock was, even if they could not offer him all of the
John unflinchingly pressed his advantage. There could be no question about who was in charge. Sherlock sank into the kiss with desire, and something very like relief.
Sherlock’s eyes squeeze shut, and then relax so that they are only closed,and the breath flows out of him. There is a gentle, gentle pressure on his head, drawing him towards John’s knee. He is sure it is not imagined.
Pull, release, pull, release, and then with another twist and a long slide, two fingers were buried deep inside John. She thrust down onto them.
.  There were too many traps here, too many ways he could go wrong. Lately he’d been feeling like every step he took was a misstep, and this after having been so careful for so long.
A soothing tongue ran over his lip, caressing where the bite had been, easing the pain. John’s fingers threaded into his hair and tilted his head for another deep plunge of his tongue. Sherlock brought his body in close, seeking contact, more than the palms of John’s hands and the thrust of his mouth.
“It’s so clear! How could I have—”
Oh, god, no. He couldn’t do
. And all at once John was tired of fighting this. Without opening his eyes or raising his head, he answered honestly. “Yeah.”
No, it was fun. Exciting, even, given a certain definition of the word.
and to carry on saying
“I am not blind.” Clipped words, blank face.
He wanted John to be proud of him. He wanted John to like it.
“About what?” Curious. Also not above fishing for compliments.
, no further object of desire beyond John himself, and he would ready himself to respond, to accede, to acquiesce...and then the
He heads for the door.
He lifted his chin. He wouldn’t ask, but he wouldn’t say no.
“Roughhousing, John.” Sherlock is standing normally, apparently at ease, but in the next moment he’s grasped John’s arm and twisted him so that his back is pressed against Sherlock’s front - this time with a long leg between his knees preventing him from escaping. “You said I should try it.”
He learned, early, to tuck his affection away, neatly. To keep it to himself. Not to trouble anyone with it. (That became his approach with his whole self.)
Not this, though.
“All night?” Sherlock shifted, two fingertips now, holding the nipple in the lightest pinch—no, a roll—no, a pinch, her movements infinitesimal, her touch feather-light. “
“Mary, it wasn’t like that. I told you, we weren’t—You aren’t
Because whatever else this offering of John’s might mean, perhaps it’s evidence sufficient to suggest that John might also be willing to…
Sherlock regards John across the small stretch of carpet. If he even considers that question in the confines of his own mind, he will be utterly defeated. Instead he concentrates on maintaining a calm, clear gaze, and silence.
“No, we’re...hah. No, we’re not. And isn’t that precisely the problem.”
Sherlock felt himself go still. For a long moment he couldn’t speak.
Now Sherlock’s breathing steadied, and John’s touch became firmer on her mons, and on the soft skin of her breast. Sherlock opened her eyes and gazed at John, the glittering irises hooded and dark.
Sherlock thinks...then looks again at John’s hopeless face and stops short.
. (And wrong.)
so that Sherlock is never hurt, is never afraid. John, who strokes and pets and soothes his lover. Like a man, always. Like an infinitely loving man. Who yet does not understand why Sherlock is not rough with his exposed body, is not using his power to hurt. What does John think a man is?
The bare feet, vulnerable. The cupped hands, cherishing. The precious words, given up now with no expectations. Poured out into the ground. A gift.
Sherlock knows what he wants to show him. Something…
The next moment, Sherlock raised one reassuring hand and let it rest on the side of John’s neck, curling his fingers around his nape and letting them stroke over the fine hairs that grew there. John’s panic subsided under his touch, but
And anyway, for this to be in any way deliberate, Sherlock would have to
“Enough,” John growled behind him, and grasped Sherlock by the back of the neck.
He was afraid of being
Sherlock has arranged the ties ahead of time. John lies down on the bed, and allows Sherlock to grasp her arms, to bring them over her head, to tie one wrist to the other, until both are secured to the bed. The hours spent on the Internet have been fruitful, apparently, because the knots are swiftly tied, neither too tight nor too loose, and hold firm when John tests them. She’s in it now. Just as well there are ropes there to keep her from backing out.
I was on the slab again.”
“Because I asked you what was on your mind, and I don’t for a moment believe that you’re out here staring at the stars wondering about my romantic affiliations.”
Sherlock met John’s invasion with eager acquiescence, opening far wider than was comfortable—or possibly even attractive— in his eagerness to admit him, to surrender his whole mouth to John, to whatever John might wish to do with it.
John smiled a little at that, with real warmth. (Had he doubted it?) He did not remark on Sherlock’s re-wording, though. Perhaps the change of pronoun was so obvious that it did not merit comment. John carried straight on. “There you are, then.”
It is the longest speech Sherlock has ever heard John make. It is also profoundly shocking, in a way his earlier belligerent declaration did not even approach. Only the words are the same. Now, without the anger obscuring the enormity of John’s words, Sherlock can finally
Sherlock is hard and straining in his trousers. He hasn’t seen this incandescent John in quite some time. Not since they’ve been together. There has always been a hard edge to John, since the beginning, but it has blurred, has softened since the first night they kissed. He is glad of that, of course he is. Nevertheless, this blistering, searing John is
quasi-experiences including but not limited to those resembling some of the more powerful human emotions, such as grief or anger—”
Then the timbre of his cries changed, deepened, roughened. Sherlock wrapped a hand around John’s erection and stroked, firmly, savouring the heft and slide of it in his hand, watching John’s body carefully for any sign of
(But then, he always had.)
“Hey, Sherlock,” he said, shuffling through the post in his hands. “You been out today?”
This time the case—wasn’t there always a case?—was unusually disturbing, even for Sherlock. Even at the crime scene after the fact, there was so much evidence of the killer’s chilling
“It was understandable. You were expressing a sentiment that you find inconvenient and distasteful. Are you supposed to sound happy about it?”
She pulled her head away, and Sherlock made a little noise, and jerked her chin, as if trying to follow.
Suffice it to say that John’s relationship with physical contact has not been unproblematic for some time.
“I know you will.” And John does know. So that when Sherlock’s hand reaches up and settles, finally, on the delicate skin of John’s upturned forearm, John feels the tension flowing out of her, and she releases a breath she didn’t realise she was holding. “I know you will, Sherlock. I trust you.”
Sherlock looked at him then, his smile little more than a softness to his mouth, and perhaps something in his eyes, too. Peace, maybe. “Okay,” he agreed.
That is, not until…
, she thought, but did not falter.
No. Everything is not all right.
, John. You did it, you’re all right. John.
They are not young, though, and the this rug does little to cushion the hard floor. Sherlock shifts on his knees, only slightly, but with his movement John quivers into awareness and time resumes.
John’s feet stay planted as he falls, as there is no room to extend them, and his knees end up practically up around his own ears, squished as he is between his chair and his own ungainly angles.
, because he
“Thanks, Sherlock.” She lifts her hand—tingling a little, as the blood flows in—and strokes Sherlock’s face. “Really. That was—I didn’t even know that was what I needed. Thank you.”
Greg looked completely baffled. “You think it’d be with a…? Why would it be with a stranger?”
he thinks. When did he become such a coward?
Sherlock knows he is admitting to everything here, but the anomaly, the glitch, is too jarring. There is nothing for it. “Exactly.”
(Who hides.)
A horrible thought began to bloom, and he stomped on it as soon as he recognised it.
When he looks up the frustration and uncertainty are gone from his face. “No,” he says again. And suddenly, the words come freely. “Not so terrible. Or rather, at times, yes, terrible. When I would think that maybe we’d had a chance, but that it was too late now, that I’d missed it, yeah, that was, that’s pretty terrible.” He meets Sherlock’s eyes in little glances, in between looking at the carpet and the ceiling. He stutters, but keeps going. “In another way, though, this is…I don’t know how this is going to sound, but…towards the end, when I realised how much of my, of what I thought was real was, was, um, wasn’t at all. Then at least then I could take, it’s like I had it to take out and look at.” He holds his hands in front of him as he talks, cups them side by side, holds them aloft, almost, as a priest might hold a chalice during a consecration, as though he’s holding something precious. “I could look at it, and almost, almost hold it in my hands, what I felt for you, and look at it and say, yeah, that’s real. It, um. It hurt. It hurts. But it’s, it’s real, and it’s
, Sherlock’s mind offers, and he wonders again what else may be hidden in his own mind that he thought was deleted long since.
What else was John going to admit today, as if it were nothing?
He spread his legs impossibly further and bore down hard. “
His eyes drift up to John’s face, while his lungs catch on and fill themselves. He has breath now to speak, but no wits, and no clear thoughts. Just noise. He wonders what he will say.
At the word
John did not watch him go. The sting of Sherlock’s rejection was unexpectedly sharp. John kept his eyes on his hands where they lay curled in his lap, grappling with his own hurt. For several moments, the struggle took up all his focus. He didn’t dare look over at Sherlock until he could be sure he didn’t look as miserable as he felt.
“You want me to...say it again?” Surprise. Wariness. Hesitation.
“No.” Swiftly. “No, it’s not…that’s not…” A cough, and a frustrated sigh. He gazes at Sherlock helplessly—then he appears to have an idea.
“I want...I want to be the person who
“I am. I do. I’m sure.”
John licked her lips with the tip of her tongue, and left her tongue resting there, on her lower lip, just the tip. This she drew up the centre line of Sherlock’s parted vulva, to the pulsing tip, and then again, and again. A slow kitten lick up the seam, then a firm press, tip of tongue to tip of clit.
“You have a detailed picture of my naked body in your mind.”
“John. John Watson. John
John, for his part, was calm. He leaned in close. “Let’s get one thing really fucking clear. He’s not my bloody fucktoy,

they laugh at one another, and themselves.
John thinks about it. “I guess. I feel rather...visible.”
Sherlock decides, and heaves himself out of his chair. One little goodnight kiss is not going to frighten John away. He probably won’t even wake up.
This wasn’t
“Exquisite agony.”
. The tension, the dam of constant vigilance that had kept it in to now was no longer needed, and it crumbled, dissolved, washed away.
He can almost feel the press of a broad back against his own chest, the warmth of smooth skin against the tips of his fingers. He can almost smell the warm neck, the heat of a familiar body.
And indeed, to Sherlock, he surely looks as if he does. His lips are red, his face is flushed, his breath is coming in short gasps, and his pupils – well. Though unlooked-for, hardly even imagined (consciously) only an hour to two before, this has all gone very, very well so far.
“John.” Her awareness snapped back in time to meet Sherlock’s eyes; they were wide and dark and earnest, there between her knees. “I’ve got you. Please.
“That’s—”
It had happened so many times now, he ought to have stopped reacting. He kept his voice neutral when he said, instead, “What is it?”
“Then shhh. I’ll keep things simple. You liked this. Oh, you
“Ah.” Sherlock ceased his pacing and drew up, suddenly still, and rested a steady gaze on John.
“But?” With a visible effort, Sherlock’s hips—though they trembled with the effort—stilled. “But? You don’t...do you want this?”
, and is handing this to
“I’ll be fine.”
Isn’t the whole point of this to finally be honest? John forces herself into stillness, crossing her legs at the ankles and resting her forearms on the pillow above her head. She cannot look at Sherlock, but she can stop darting her eyes over to where she stands by the bed. She looks, instead, at the ceiling, and tries to let her mind go blank.
From here on in, things get
Once up the stairs, John strips off Sherlock’s coat and his own jacket and wrenches his shoes off his feet. He steps close to Sherlock, glaring, piercing. He grasps both of Sherlock’s hands and places them firmly, roughly, on his arse. There is a fierce kiss. John is
There was another kind of asking, though. Rougher.
“Mister Cranky just got a nice blow job and now he wants to sleep.” Sherlock speaks his grievance to the air and the four walls, not looking away from the object of his ministrations.
A slow, curling grin. “Yeah.”
“Of my – of my body.” John’s voice is remarkably steady.
John looks up at Sherlock’s sound of disgust and follows his gaze across the green. Through the trees, he spots a gaggle of young men and his blogger’s mind presents him with words like

“So…?”
John, overwhelmed with terrible hope, squeezed his eyes shut. “Be sure,” he pleads. “Be sure you want this. I can't—”
He had to release his fingers, or he’d leave bruises. Instead he let his hands rove, down her arms to her wrists, up her sides to her very full breasts. She allowed it, returning the thrusts of his tongue and humming at his intensity.
—and he heard the sharp gasp of realisation, so familiar and so desperately dear.
“Yeah, I was a little distracted too.” They grinned at each other, and let another moment pass in silence.
of all people, of the two of them, who had the sense to find a beautiful, intelligent woman and settle down? Harry, he reflected, was one lucky—oh. Except that her beautiful wife had cheated on her just before her wedding.
“Oh, look at you, my lovely, lovely girl. So ready for me, aren’t you?” John hovered her fingers just off the skin of Sherlock’s labia, brushing the hair, but not touching the skin. Sherlock whined. “Oh, do you like that, love? Shall I touch you? Would you like my fingers on you? Would you like me to touch you in there, closer?”
The muscles stood out on John’s shoulders through his shirt as he reached around Sherlock’s body and kneaded Sherlock’s arse. John looked
to ask for it.
unutterably
(Tenderness. It was one of the words Sherlock was wary of, in his own thoughts. Too close to the things he wasn’t sure they had and didn’t dare to ask for—much too risky.)
Their shoulders touch. Sherlock’s heart beats a little faster.
“Ah, John.” Sherlock was on the sofa in his blue dressing gown, facing away from John, his laptop—no, John’s laptop, of course—open on his chest. He did not look around when John came in; nevertheless John had the impression he’d been waiting for him to come home.
The man—coldly efficient, even under attack—fought back, which gave John all the excuse he needed to slam his head against the brick wall. This time, the accomplice dropped like a stone.
Sherlock was already open, already stretched and wide and
“Kidding! But it worked for you, didn’t it?”
Then back, soft licks, delicate lips, tip of tongue.
(They were so close. Two bodies, not quite touching. What was there in a close body and ardent puffs of breath that was more frightening than a murderous giant or a slavering hound? Was it so dreadful, then, John, to finally be seen?)
The heady combination of comfort and desperation, the way John gave him exactly what he desired, the way he made him ask for it, beg for it. The way John made him say exactly what he wanted, and made it safe. (For a given value of

She’d known as soon as she’d kissed her that this was going to be long, long and intense. At the very first hint of escalation, Sherlock’s mouth had gone soft under John’s, opening slightly to allow whatever John might choose, but then waiting, pliant and hollow, to follow where John might lead.
. Has he lost all control of his own thoughts? Is it all to be fairy tales and sacred stories from the forgotten depths of his mind when the holiest offering of all is here under his own hands?
And I feel brilliant for a few seconds.”
Joy was there, and desire, and a deep, blooming arousal that burned in his face and in the grip of his fingers on John’s shoulders. Seeing it, John’s doubts evaporated. He gave a faint smile.
Feet tripping, stumbling, legs bumping, tangling. Shoulders careening off walls, murmured curses, rough commands. Harsh breaths barely pausing as the bedroom door slammed shut—
Sherlock smiles too, into the skin of John’s shoulder, but refuses to concede. “Well, yes. And proving a point.”
He is inside John’s body. John has let him in, has let him open him with gentleness, has let him see the fear and vulnerability he has been carrying so close for so long. Has exorcised his voices, perhaps, and given himself up into Sherlock’s hands and Sherlock’s care in the sure knowledge that he is safe there.
Sherlock–who had actually been somewhat affected by the particular brand of poison the man had been spewing–had taken several seconds to compose himself. John, when he was righteous and incensed, was
“What about me, though?”
John’s gaze turns inward. “I was so sure it wouldn’t matter.” A pause. “Would it? Would it have made a difference to you?”
“I need to see you naked.”
Sherlock walks in to 221b and finds John already there.
. For all the bareness of John’s feet, and the ragged honesty of John’s words.
“Like a man.” John cannot hear his fury, or his bitterness. His fingers grip, digging into flesh. “Yes?”
I want, I’ve wanted for so long—”
this, suddenly. It is not just wanting. His hand on John’s face clenches, slides, pressing and gripping, down his neck and into the collar of his shirt. He needs to gather all of John in to himself. To claim this intimacy that should always have been theirs.
“It’s ridiculous.”
A shared silence. James pulled another folding chair up to where John sat. “Thinking of home?”

“...yeah.”
And he laughs into Sherlock’s hair, deep and rich and sweet, like honey.
“Kidding, John. Look, if you’re sure you want this…”
. Except that her brother had slept with her wife, just before their wedding.
until John had stoppered up his plosive with his fat cock, and he felt no shame or embarrassment at all when his words shifted to needy little sounds at the first touch of John’s erection on his tongue, and then to a high-pitched rhythmic whimpering that went on and on.
“Please. Forgive me?”
Sherlock loved having sex with John. He loved being manhandled by John. He loved being ordered around by John. He loved

Sherlock wasn’t laughing. Sherlock was barely breathing.
Perhaps they will be allowed to do this forever.
The desire in John’s eyes was the only difference. Everything else, Sherlock has seen and pictured a thousand times. It was only this look that was new.
Sherlock draws back and glares at her. “John, I am a genius. I am never wrong. I know what beauty is, and you, my dear, are beautiful. Strong and round and golden and

What can he possibly say? He can feel the uncertainty written across his face, in the slackening of his jaw and the stinging tightness around his eyes. There is nothing he can think of to say, now that his anger has fled. Silence is his last defense, and he is painfully aware of how flimsy it is.

or palm along the curve of his lower back, and feel just the start of where his spare lines softened, rounded. It felt as good as he always knew it would.
With a long, shuddering breath, John surrendered herself to the alternating quick sharp shocks and deep rolls of pleasure rising in her body under Sherlock’s tongue. Her forehead rested on her arms, braced against the wall, and her mouth hung open to allow for her rapid, panting breaths.
“That’s not—”
“You didn’t know.” John blinked once, frowning. His hands moved again, but still so slowly. He was working it out. “You didn’t know?”
John found his own voice with some difficulty. “I—yes, sir.” He cleared his throat and moved towards the barracks. “Good night, sir.”
“If you want to.”
She set up an alternating rhythm; fingers, tongue, fingers, tongue, occasionally surprising John by applying both at once, or replacing tongue with lips for a wet, messy kiss that took in all of John’s slippery folds. Then back to her pattern, press, drag, press, drag.
“Goddamn it, Sherlock.” John gives up suddenly and slithers to the floor. “I should be a

The other kind of John Watson smile. The nameless feeling in Sherlock’s chest and forehead intensifies, begins to buzz slightly.
“Yes, I suppose I did. I always do. I’d still like to know, to be honest. But I don’t imagine there’s actually an answer. To whether or what we are.”
“You’re asking me?”
“Like he said, I like what he likes, because I’m him
The force of the joy expanding in John’s chest lifted his head before he could think to stop it. He—finally—without even having to force it, met Sherlock’s eye.
Sherlock’s whole body seizes in response to John’s distress, moves unbidden to launch itself at John, but John’s whole body jolts backwards, and his whole manner forbids Sherlock to move.
And then to have Sherlock use that very word to summon him, to speak the desperately-desired words in a way that reminded John (as if he was ever able to forget) of everything he hungered for and couldn’t have...he couldn’t have guessed, could he? He couldn’t have.
and quickly shifts his thoughts to finding a way to break the hold that doesn’t involve an elbow to his friend’s gut or a head to his chin. “I don’t think I did.”
John’s grin turned warm and crinkled. “Fine, all right. It did mean care. Of course it did. It will always mean that, Sherlock, no matter what we do. I always want to take care of you.”
. “Sherlock. I’m sorry. You can’t know how sorry. But I really need you to leave, and not come back, and...I don’t know, delete me. You’re—”
Sherlock doesn’t back down. “Angry, I see. Was that when you chinned me, or when you got married?” A narrow glare. “I can’t deduce from no evidence, John. I could see you were angry. You got angrier and angrier. John Watson, Angry Army Doctor. There wasn’t anything I could do without making you angry – getting high, getting a girlfriend, getting shot, getting deported – didn’t seem to matter. You seem pretty angry right now, in fact. I know I’m not the expert in human behaviour that you are, but is that kind of anger a sign of someone who’s
” His
No, Sherlock could not be doing this on purpose. He was thoughtless, yes, but never knowingly cruel.
Now, though, John does hurry. His shoes are off and his jacket is off and he is pulling his shirt, only half unbuttoned, over his head. He gives Sherlock another hard kiss while unbuckling his belt. He hitches his jeans off his hips and lets the weight of the belt pull the trousers to the floor, and kicks them off with his feet. He doesn’t break eye contact the whole time.
Sherlock manages to conceal his intense relief, but it is a near thing.
9th and final chapter is written and will likely be posted later today.
beautiful and intoxicating and so, so precious.
Well, if John was there, he could do it. He could do it, because there was nothing,
“John. We don’t have to.”
“John.” Sherlock’s voice was hushed and awed, and little wonder. John’s hips were rocking in small, unbidden thrusts. Her spine was arched, her head thrown back, and there were little, wanton sounds emerging from her mouth with every breath, and she with neither strength nor will to silence them. She knew, dimly, that this was not how Sherlock knew her, that this kind of, of
“When I first came back, I thought...I wasn’t expecting—” He huffs a breath. “You surprised me. I wasn’t expecting your, your anger. I thought—I didn’t think. I had no idea you would be so affected.”
And there he sits with everything closed. Speaking his words, but closing his eyes to avoid being seen, like a child afraid of monsters in the dark. This was John’s idea of
At first, letting it happen was all John could do. He could stand there and let Sherlock kiss him, and that was all, and only because he was utterly unable to draw himself away. He could let Sherlock kiss him with large, gentle hands curled around his head and into his hair. He could let Sherlock kiss him and kiss him and kiss him, and when his body went weak, he could let Sherlock wrap his arms around his body and hold him up, support him, shore up his crumbling walls, rebuild him.
“No, that explains—That’s...everything we thought we were, everything...we’re just them. Dressed up in different skins, doing whatever they—”
“John,” he said. “Yes.”
, I know you do.”
in what he was doing that even Lestrade’s team could feel it. It made everyone uneasy.
“What you say. What you do.” Sherlock does not want to explain himself, but pity for John has dissipated his anger. He can concede that this is better than John walking out, but barely. It feels dangerous.
“Do you think it’s that easy? Truly?”
He looks at his own bare feet and they give him no clues whatsoever. “I find it difficult, this sort, this sort of…”
. Smooth and wet and, and...
that John could not quite fathom.
“So?”
A final one, back to kisses and sips, wet passes of wide lips, warm nuzzles and hot breaths, John’s face burrowing deep, two fingers curling, seeking, until Sherlock’s whole body was flung wide and smeared flush with the mattress.
He drew the mug towards himself. “I’m fine.”
John was not out to these people and no one was speaking up (although no one looked particularly happy with this line of discourse either) so Sherlock just sat, and listened, and thought he might understand a little better why John has been so hesitant to bottom during sex. If this was the sort of talk he found unremarkable.
“Not want you—Are you fucking insane? I’d fucking
One of them says, “I just – ”
A trail of kisses brought John from the warm skin of Sherlock’s inner thigh, over the pale silk of her belly, along the too-prominent ribs. She dragged her tongue along where the texture of the skin changed, between where it stretched over bones and where it swelled around a soft breast, and nuzzled into the warmth there, sliding her hand up to the other breast and cradling the very base of its curve.
Afterwards, they sat in the kitchen. John made tea.
He’d had to say it again before John would close his mouth over a pebbled nipple. Sherlock tried, sometimes, to bypass this gatekeeper, would arch and press into John’s hands or mouth without having to utter the words, but John—although usually a step behind on cases—was always faster.
and I wasn’t stopping him. How the hell is that all right?”
He had almost lost control completely. “Oh god, Sherlock, you feel…”

He groaned, but such was what passed for logic at 3:23am, and he rose obediently and went to the window. There was no one there.

Their hearts beat, their chests rise and fall. For several long minutes, it is enough.
” Ridiculously sentimental, but true.
” It surged through his whole body, more powerful than ever. “Sherlock, you have no—yes.” He began to thrust his hips in earnest now, back and forth, arching his back to press the muscles of his arse into Sherlock’s hands, then rocking forward for the drag of cock against cock, gritting out his words amidst gasps and moans. “Yes—
“Well, shouldn’t I be?”
Sherlock’s style. “What was that?” he asked.

The look on his face was already Sherlock laid bare; he could feel it in his slackening jaw and his wide eyes. But John was asking, and Sherlock was beyond refusing, even this.
would.” Sherlock sat up and twisted around to squint up at Greg. He managed to squint and scowl at the same time. “You’re a police inspector. You’re divorced. You’re not dating anyone, not for six, no, eight months. You only maintain friendships with people who are as manacled to their jobs as you are, and as a result you go weeks and weeks without a social engagement. You’re well into your fifties, and not nearly as fit as you were. What on earth would someone have to write in a porny one-shot about
The murderer—a talker, as Sherlock had surmised, and less intelligent than he had thought—spoke. “Pity. I had the right knife all picked out, just perfect for that flawless skin…” Taunting. “I’d have let you watch, too. He’s
“I, um.” John is speaking now, if only barely. “I. It’s not, it's not. Well. Inconvenient? I mean, yes, it is, but that’s not – ” A huff of breath.
“It’s fine.”
He’s staring at Sherlock’s empty chair. Or at the window, it’s hard to tell from the door.

, opening himself up for John was appealing; indeed, there was nothing he would want more. The more he thought about it, the more appealing it became. Sherlock was not shy about his body. He wasn’t afraid of being seen.
John’s wide, uncertain,
Sherlock’s lips close around the very base of John’s prick, and if he was wild before, he’s desperate now. He sucks and swallows, making frenzied, half-choked,
“How do you know all this, anyway?” John felt the need to redirect this conversation, and quickly. “How do you remember?”
Their hearts were in these kisses; John was not even trying to hold back the surge of emotion that was cascading into it, and Sherlock met him wave for wave.

“I—ah. Right. That is...Well. There are a number of possibilities on that point, the most likely being that we are a sort of meta-fictional entity approaching sentience due to having reached a critical mass of credence in the collective consciousness. Including our own, it would appear, although I grant a certain circularity in that instance. As such, we—for a given value of
take it. “Goddamn it, Sherlock.”
They stepped apart, briefly, and held each other’s eye, mouths parted and chests heaving. By some unspoken agreement, their hands move to the waists of their own trousers. John fumbled with the buckle of his belt—his hands weren’t working well, and he did not want to look away from Sherlock’s face, so he worked by feel.
. He was so sure he knew, and then…and now he does not know at all. What will he do if John’s body is how it was in his mind? What will he do if it’s not?
“I’m what, John?” Sherlock was listening intently, for once.
she lay there, still, but with the blood singing in her veins and her skin almost aglow with tactility.
(Like a man.)
But it’s out, now. “Or as a kid…?”
Sherlock’s hand stayed his neck, steadfast. “I do, I do want. I want to kiss you, and I want to touch you, and I want you to stop sending me away.” He closed his eyes and let his forehead come to rest on John’s, brought his other hand up to rest just above the first, cupping the back of John’s head, cradling him like he was something of value.
...and that was all they needed, those other words, to come spilling out of his mouth, “I want you, Sherlock, I love you, I love you,
John asked those questions in his usual voice and Sherlock felt free to ignore them at his leisure.
John didn’t, only kept brushing, kept plucking. A little scratch through the fabric.
He could. It is less than John risked, coming here.
Sherlock was still high on her own plateau, still pliant and ready, but focused now on John. With a twist of her wrist she withdrew her hand from where it cupped John’s mound and grasped her lover’s hips instead, raising her to the bed.
“Pardon?”
“Did it?”
Sherlock!”
Sherlock shakes herself at that, takes a deep breath, lets it out. “We did, yes. Then here: I love you too.” She smiles then, dazzling, brilliant. “I love you, John. And I think now we really are through with keeping secrets.”
So it was only a matter of time, and sure enough, one evening after Mrs. Hudson had been up to drop off some biscuits and say good night, Sherlock confronted John in the sitting room.
I thought this would be the ending, but there are one or two more maneuverings that need to happen.
) He looked at John for a long moment.
“When I took hold of you before, I said
“All right. Okay. Well: Who do you want to be?”
“Stop being a tit. I’m just saying, roughhousing between friends can be good, plain fun, and you’ve never done it, so you don’t know.”
It took John several moments—turning to Sherlock, grasping his arms, running his hands down the sides of his body— to register the wide eyes, the fixed stare, the heaving breath. The lack of a response when he peered up at him.
That's how the light gets in.
Sherlock did not move away. His head dropped further, and his own eyes closed beneath his knit brows. (So close.) He was close enough that he could feel the tremulous gasps of John’s breathing on his skin. (Not quite touching.) He had been
But some nights it is difficult, even though he can see that John is sagging, is drained, does not have any extra energy to deal with Sherlock’s pawings. He still feels it under his whole skin, the urge to fondle and pat and stroke. The sheer affection that threatens to crackle out of his pores.

He let Sherlock kiss him however he wanted to, resting his arms on Sherlock’s shoulders and allowing him full access, letting him turn his head and tilt his jaw and kiss and kiss and kiss. Whatever Sherlock wanted.
the groan rasped and scraped its way from the depths of his gut,
First with one hand, then the other, John teased lightly at the dark nubs of Sherlock’s small breasts. There was a particular movement that Sherlock adored, John spreading her fingertips like the points of a star, all around Sherlock’s nipple, then drawing upwards with a twist, light, so light, brushing past the nipple on the way up, but not lingering, then down again for another pass.
He is naked now, John is, naked and hard and defiant. Chest high, chin out, cock curving up against his belly. He doesn’t stop, but scrambles across the bed to pull a half-empty bottle of lube from the drawer of the bedside table, which he
“I’m only asking because you seemed—and I want it to be good for you—”

there was Sherlock’s hot, wet clitoris, full and waiting. John swallowed a moan as she felt it twitch under her touch.
“I...Don't you know?”
“You’re the genius. Walk me through this highly improbable theory of yours. If we’re not just
“John, I—” he begins, but no words come. He tries again. “That is, I—” But the words stick in his throat, struggle to remain unsaid. (Silence is a difficult habit to break, apparently.)
“Shh, lie still, sweetheart. It’s ok.” She rested a soothing hand high on Sherlock’s chest until the detective subsided.
“I…I’m not sure. I’m not sure of anything.”
He sneers. “Then why are you still here?” He doesn’t think his voice trembles. (John never notices anything anyway. Even less than he thought.)
Yes, fear. Only the anger will show, of course; this is John. He'll come.
“Oh, yes, dear. There we are. God, you should feel this. You’re incredibly hot, my love.”
This is just their sort of defective, that John could marry someone else and still in some way be
Sherlock can see that John is ready. He eases his fingers out, earning a grunt of discomfort from John. He works quickly, unbuttoning his shirt and slipping it off his shoulders, glad of the cuffs already rolled to the elbows. His belt and trouser fastenings are dealt with just as fast, while he kicks off his shoes and socks. Within seconds, he is bare, and he returns with haste to John’s body, arm around his chest. Even after so brief an absence, it feels like homecoming.
“—and you’re sorry.” Gentle again, Sherlock twists his fingers as he talks. “You’re sorry for thinking it, aren’t you John?” Twists and curls.
There is no distance at all between them now. Perhaps there never really was, perhaps it was imagined, all this time.
“But…” But John knew about loss. His injury, his career. Sherlock himself. Mary.
“No? I thought it was.” John’s face was pressed to his chest, but Sherlock could feel his smile.
John murmured into Sherlock’s skin.,“You’re absolutely gorgeous right now. So hot. Feeling all right?”
“Well, to them, they are.” John can remember - just barely - feeling that way. It seems a long time ago.
Anyway, he enjoyed it all. It was fine.
There is a crack, a crack in everything.

Swift and final. John was a coward, but at least he made himself watch Sherlock’s face when he said it.
Something in the slow deliberateness of that last action makes Sherlock turn. Whatever he was planning for John dissolves when he sees him standing by the door.
“That they meant us to be happy.”
Sherlock made an effort to draw himself up. It was hindered by John’s implacable grip on his neck. He swallowed, with difficulty. “What are you going to do?”
. But it was still a
And then Sherlock tightened the fingers on John’s neck, gave a clever twist on the upstroke, and whispered, “It’s always you, John,” and John gave a soft cry, and came into his hand.
“Well, cheers, Sherlock. Luckily for me, there are a few folks out there with a better imagination than you. And better taste. I get porny one-shotted all the time.”
John was going to

Her rhythm was turning erratic now. She needed more and she wasn’t getting it. John brought a thumb up to Sherlock’s seeping opening and circled the entrance, round and round, barely dipping her thumb inside.
“Everyone thinks I’m sexy?”
“Do you?” John persisted.
John, in his chair, smiles, and breathes, and says, “You didn’t know? You didn’t
but has no idea if John believes him, and no more breath to ask. There is something else, too, an odd feeling swirling around his chest and behind his eyes, one he has no name for, but which is preventing him from saying any more. (On the whole, he feels, that is for the best.)
“Yes,” Sherlock says, probably too quickly. Then, steadier: “Yes.”
After a pause that was not quite too long to be natural, Sherlock, still not looking up, spoke. “Well? What is it?”
. As if there was anything Sherlock could ask for that John would refuse her. As if there were anything she would not risk, if Sherlock asked.
Sherlock: looking hungry, one beat, two beats, breathing the air that John was panting out, looking at John’s wide eyes that hid nothing, John was sure, none of his  breathlessness or shining need. John looked back, having given over all control, his mouth wet and wanting, waiting to be claimed.

She did protest once, when he squeezed a breast too hard, tearing her face away from his to gasp at the rough treatment. “Christ, John! I’m thirty-eight weeks pregnant!”
Sherlock blinked twice, three times, but then found John’s comment did not require much processing. It was just true.
Sherlock has been running Mrs. Hudson’s old portable oil heater in here for hours. The room smells slightly of burnt dust, but the temperature is comfortable, even with John’s skin bare. “Yes.”
She kept up her alternating claw movement, maintaining speed and pressure, and let Sherlock’s own tension take care of the build-up. As the detective’s breathing became shallower, John added a firmer touch to the nipple as she pulled away, a squeeze, not quite a pinch, and the barest twist before her fingers were gone again.
did that. We gave it the, the beauty. It was beautiful to us because it...meant something.”
Sherlock would reach for John if he wanted to. Sherlock is not reaching for John. Therefore he doesn’t want to. Logic.
After that, it was...well. John was drunk and conflicted, and not able to do much more than try to keep up. Clara was persistent in her efforts, though, and strident in seeking her pleasure. She got herself off on John’s fingers and John’s cock while John tried valiantly to uphold his end of the proceedings.

sinks in, somehow, and Sherlock surfaces, to see John looking small and resigned in the doorway. It becomes imperative that he say something right now, anything at all, to stop John from leaving. Why, when a few minutes ago all he wanted was to be alone with his anger and his silence? There is no answer, but the necessity of speech is undeniable.
“Know what.”
rolled, and tugged, and rolled, every touch just barely there. She did not think that Sherlock even realised how her body was responding  until John finally reached down with her left hand and ran a finger along the seam of Sherlock’s vulva…
“Any time I get to touch you. I want to remember, every time. I only want it to be real, Sherlock. It's really fucking real, okay? I want to keep it that way.”
, the very word
and an overwhelming flood of feelings that would take over his voice in another moment, despite his long-standing restraint.
John takes his fear and shame and all the sex he’s had with someone who did not love him, and lays it at Sherlock’s feet, and Sherlock gathers them up and keeps them safe…
From where he is standing, he can see John’s head, from behind and to the side - that is, his ear and most of his right eye, his drawn up mouth and tense jaw - and his shoulders. He can’t see John’s left side at all, but he can tell that his head is resting on his left fist. He can see the stiffness in John’s shoulders, the way he sets them at attention when he is casting about for something he can be in control of.
“You don't want to?” Sherlock didn't sound...upset, exactly. He didn't sound happy either.
But Sherlock’s tremors were turning to shudders now. Her little words were becoming louder, more desperate.
. He had been as drugged as as terrified as the rest of them but had faced down the Hound without so much as a quiver.

“You. You were driving me round the twist, with all your

There was no way John hadn’t felt Sherlock’s body tense. There was no way, if he looked at his face, that John could avoid seeing Sherlock’s distress. He would look, and he would see, and he would stop.
John was going to be livid. At the moment, that was his main concern.

That was incredible. What had he been talking about? “Consider this my stag night.”

Sherlock moaned, and with another tilt of her body, seated herself down on John’s thumb. Her groan was deep and heartfelt.

The accomplice. Clearly he was of a more direct nature. There would be no grandstanding from him.
How was it possible that he hadn’t heard John come in? He barely avoided guiltily slamming his laptop shut, which would have been a giveaway even to John. His hands did twitch on the keyboard, though.
. The shadows have all but fled.
Sherlock didn’t. So he’d be using that Sherlock as a stand-in, as a sort of, what, rubber doll, to do what the real person would never agree to, and moreover the person he’d be with was not the Sherlock he wanted anyway.
And then Sherlock kissed him. Soft and full and tender.
“Well?” John asks, lightly. “Have you seen what you needed? Is everything in order?”
John, who shot the cabbie, straight and true, John, who tackled the Golem.
“You want it.” Sherlock takes the rounds of John’s arse in his two hands and spreads them. Wide. He stretches and crooks his two thumbs, presses them into the skin on either side of John’s opening, using them to

Sherlock shows him – though he knows already, surely, as with kissing, it can’t be new – deft flicks of buttons and quick slides of zips, palms sliding over skin, parting fabric, pushing shirts off shoulders and trousers down hips.
It is pleasanter, also, because Sherlock has tidied. Straightened the papers on the desk, gathered up the discarded dressing gowns from off the furniture, cleared away the half-hearted half-experiments from various surfaces, and put the coffee table back in front of the sofa.

The next day was a big day, indeed, and long. The longest of John’s life. He whispered,
Demolition indeed. But is it the annihilation of the fragile, precarious foundations they have just barely managed to lay, or the leveling of their last defensive walls?

Sherlock raised his head to look at John. “Who would say that?”

“Don’t tell me it was an accident.” John traced a pointed shoulder blade as Sherlock sprawled across his chest.
“Oh,” said Sherlock, sounding...a little at a loss. “Yes.”

Sherlock has still made no move towards John, but only watches her as she lies on the bed, tugging on her bound hands, settling her shoulders. John rejected the idea of a blindfold out of hand when Sherlock suggested it some days ago, feeling instinctively that that level of, of powerlessness would be beyond her, but now she wonders if she ought to have considered it. Lying there, stealing little glances at Sherlock, seeing her eyes travel across her bare body—this kind of exposure is difficult to bear. If she were blinded, she could pretend Sherlock was, what, looking out the window or something.

More silence. After a long while, John responded with his own question. “Do you not have anyone at home?”

John couldn't say what clue he saw that made him sure, but he had lost too much in his life not to take what gifts he was offered. There was Sherlock's open face looking down at him, there were his wide, imploring eyes, and there,
“Yes,” John tells her, willing it to be true. She closes her eyes and waits for the first touch, wondering where it will land.
“Oh? And what do...

“That’s not what it said.”

Sure enough, after a few more seconds of shuddering, furious breathing, John pulls himself up off the bed and draws his shoulders straight and square. He moves to follow Sherlock and his step is firm, his head is up, and he makes no move to cover himself. If he did, his bobbing cock would be ridiculous. As it is, there is nothing but bristling pride in the whole strong line of his body, head to toe.
That - if it were ever to happen at all - there would be soft, encouraging whispers (

Sherlock didn’t even try to contain his small smile, at that. “You do, John. You always do. I should have seen it.”

“Christ, Sherlock, you, you, you—”

“No, they could. They probably are. Didn’t you do that sort of thing when you were at uni, with your mates…?”
John shook his head and rolled away. He lay on his back and stared at the ceiling. “Even if that’s...even if that’s true. Sherlock, everything I’ve done, everything I’ve done to you...Sherlock, you shouldn’t, I can’t...How do you know I won’t do it again?” He raised himself on one elbow, and looked at Sherlock’s face. He had never been more honest or sincere than when he said, “You’re a good man, Sherlock, you always have been. And that’s why I didn’t, I couldn’t—because, really,
He was just conscious enough that something was amiss to be put off by this, but not enough to actually refuse. That would have seemed…uncivil, somehow. And he would not have been able to justify it, in any case.
“Me? Why?” Startled. Frowning.
It should have been so beautiful.
She held Sherlock’s gaze a moment longer, took a breath, then gave a short nod.

“Nope.” John closed his eyes. “Nope, in this case, it means

“Beautiful,” he croons, and yes, he is crooning, he can claim that. It is
“Like it wasn’t completely fucking obvious.”
He has to touch John. John, trembling before him. He has to touch John, and make this real, but John is pressed back in his chair, as far from Sherlock as he can get without actually moving. He is shuddering ever more violently.

“Your safeword?” Sherlock’s voice is coolly efficient.
, Sherlock’s thigh was hard up between John’s trembling legs, very deliberately pressing on John’s cock, and still John was wondering what was allowed.
Sherlock’s hand lay open on the edge of the bed. By lining herself up and planting one foot on the floor, John could settle her vulva right into Sherlock’s open palm. When she did, the response was instantaneous and explosive.
His voice was gruff when he said, “Get some sleep, Watson.” As he might to any man under his command. In his care.
“There must be. If there is, I’ll find it.”

There was a plan. He didn’t know the whole of it, but there was a plan, and the plan required that he do this. And what did John ever do when there was a plan but go along with it, whatever the cost to himself, which almost certainly wasn’t accounted for when the plan was made?
But in fairy tales, the incantation must be spoken three times for the magic to work. Sherlock has no idea why he has retained this, and what circuitous route it must have taken to come into his conscious mind just now, but he knows it now without a doubt. Three times, and the true name of the beloved.
“Yeah?”
With each other, it is different. Everything is different. But one does not easily overcome a lifetime of reticence. Of isolation.

Sherlock, impossibly, exchanges an incredulous look with John’s penis. To John, he says,“Why on earth not?”
“Yeah, Harry, that’s what they wanted for you, too.”
Terrible. Dire.
She slid one hand off John’s bottom and down into her opening, curling two fingers inside, effectively imprisoning John’s clit between the pressure of Sherlock’s fingers on the inside wall and that of her flat tongue on the outside.
“It took me long enough.” John wove his hand into Sherlock’s hair, stroking the silky ends of his curls between his fingertips.
