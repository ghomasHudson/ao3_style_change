Then we are on our way again. Cas rolls down the windows of this car, and the fresh air helps me regain part of my strength. I can't explain coherently, but it's making me feel so much better.
The man is there and he hands us the keys and the place is ours. I rush inside as soon as Cas unlocks the door, and dance around happily in the front hall. Cas shuts the door, pulls me to him, and kisses me. I gasp, then meld into him. The kiss is perfect and I'm melting into Cas' arms as he pulls us ever so closer together.
I'm not sure how much time has passed, but when Cas returns, I have assumed the fetal position on the thickly carpeted floor. He grabs at me, pulling me up into his arms.
"And yet it would make me feel better if I did give something to you. You are taking time out of your schedule to converse and fish with me, despite your father's wishes. I could only hope to thank you for the company you bring."
"Cas!" I shudder out.
"No, I'm not usually out on the field."
"No, but really, Cas, thanks. For giving me a chance. For just being you. Because you, well, because you're pretty awesome."
"I think I love you too," I say, and Cas' head shoots up and stares at me, eyes wider than before.
"Me too," Cas whispers back. "Sir, we would like to buy the house."
"You can't blame me for admiring you, Dean."
If I thought Charlie's accent was pronounced, then I was very much wrong. The man's voice has so much of a drawl that I hang on to every word he says, trying to keep my attention focused on him. "That we are, brother. And I 'eard you were looking for a job here. Luckily, we don' got any requirements for hire. Jus' gotta be old enough. Let me know when you can start working, Mr. Smith."
"I can't help you if you don't tell me what's wrong, Dean."
I am utterly alone.
"God! Don't say it like that!"
"Yes, we live over there," Castiel gestured vaguely in the direction of their cottage. "I have been with them for as long as I can remember."
"Yeah?"
Cas gives me an incredulous look, shrugs, then answers, "Yellow, I guess." I glance down at his clothing, not seeing a hint of yellow. I raise my eyebrow, and he shrugs. "What about yours?"
"No! My head hurts so much that it is causing me physical pain to fucking think. What the fuck did you do to me?!"
I squirm, my cheeks feeling slightly heated at him blatantly checking me out. "That's not going to change that I'm not attracted to women who fucking kidnap people. She'll never get what she wants from me because I won't respond to her raping me."
"Why are you not married, Dean?"
We drive over to the house that Jo had circled. I immediately like the way it looks. It's a one-story, ranch-style house, painted a bluish gray color with a red door. It has a two car garage and an adorable front porch.
"I believe that would work. I will need only to collect some flowers," Castiel agreed.
Cas breaks off the kiss, and leans out foreheads together, warm breaths mingling between us. "Was that alright, Dean? I should have asked permission, but I just couldn't stop myself—"
"Woah! Hey, hey. No!" I exclaim.
When he awoke again, he was pleased to see a bee had ventured to float around his head. He laid still, letting the small animal explore him. It buzzed around his ears curiously, tickling his skin when it landed on him briefly. The bee flew off and Castiel sat up and walked over to the stream. He perched on the shore and looked down at the glistening water, seeing numerous small fish and tadpoles close to developing into frogs.
I step out of the bathroom and take in the rest of the cabin. The rustic décor looks weathered despite its told lack of use, and the house only has the bare minimum of furnishings in it.
"Do you want to change your name first?"
"That is exactly the point, Dean. I do like you, and you are brilliant. I will not apologize for giving you the credit you deserve."
"Yeah. I'll stay here and watch the water, and you can go get some flowers." Dean smiled up at him as Castiel stood up.
Concern flashes in those beautiful eyes of his, then he turns away from me, releases the drapes and leaves the room, the door closing with a soft 'snick' sound.
"You trying to get me naked, Cas? You could have just said so."
Dean paused. "My dad is. My mom died when I was little."
~•~•~•~•~
Castiel looks taken aback at my outburst. "She wants you?"
Dean's eyes opened again, slowly with lashes fluttering in the bright light.
He opens the passenger door and, thankfully, I am able to walk again, with a little bit of help. "Where are we?" I ask, glad my voice doesn't sound as quivery anymore.
"It's about a half a day's walk in that direction." Castiel pointed.
"Please," I whine.
Castiel leveled a stare at Dean. "Are you? You are the one who stated earlier that you may not be able to get away."
"Got it." She grabs a notepad and starts scribbling on it. "So here are all the properties for sale around Ball Ground. I've circled the one that's a one bedroom. The other places have at least three bedrooms."
I walk briskly towards the diner and push open the glass door. Charlie greets me quickly, and I explain that I'm ready to start today. Her boss, and my new boss, Benny, show me the ropes with little pressure, the diner not very busy at this time in the morning. Soon enough, I'm easily taking order after order and delivering it with ease.
Cas is sitting on the couch, snacking on a Twinkie from a pile on the table. He pats the spot next to him, and I stumble over and plop myself down there. He hands me a Twinkie.
Dean broke their eye contact. "No reason, man." Dean toed off his shoes, then rubbed his feet in the grass. "Hey, not nearly as prickly as it looks."
I feel tears burning at the edges of my eyes, the feeling foreign after such a long time without crying.
Cas grins at me. "If you wanted to, you'll probably smell like hotdogs all hours of the day though," Cas laughs. "I'm not complaining, it might just make me want you more than I already do."
When he reached the stream, and the open clearing around it, he plopped down onto the plush grass near the beehive. Taking off his shoes methodically, he gazed at the structure with adoration and was ecstatic when he heard the hum of the gentle creatures.
Castiel considered Dean's words. "I would need to ask my aunts before. I imagine Rachel would be quite wary at the prospect of inviting a stranger into our home. We rarely get visitors, and they usually only pass through briefly to buy some of Mirabel's clothing."
Cas lets go after a minute, and says, "Thank you."
A little bit underwhelming to me, but I can't say I'm disappointed in my groom. Even with a day on the road under his belt, he still looks real fucking hot.
I flush, not feeling like I deserve his attention.
We leave the restaurant, leaving a generous tip for Charlie, and go to the bakery next door, ready to talk to Jo. Cas holds the door open for me then walks right up to the counter of the shop.
"I'm homosexual, I like it up the butt, only dick makes me thick."
"A cat?" I ask, in awe at the mental picture he's managed to create.
"Well apparently when she was nine, sparks flew between her and my thirteen year old brother, and now because he's dead, she's settling for me."
"Of course. I am always happy to accept help from anyone."
"I did say I was out of the business once, Dean. She forced me back in when our mother died last year."
"I thought we could just wait here," Castiel offered. "I had been fishing for a dinner for Rachel, Anna, Mirabel, and me. I had been close to catching my first one, when I heard your shout."
Castiel stood up, skirt brushing across his legs, and took a cautious step closer to the man. "Hello," he responded, wary of the stranger.
"I think we may have to try it again tomorrow."
The ceremony, if you can call it that, was short. We just walked in, signed the documents, and now we are legally married.
"That cherry pie still better than sex?" Cas asks once breathing becomes easier, as he removes the condom.
Cas sighs, "Let's go get a mattress then."
"Are you alright, Dean?"
"What do you plan on doing today, Castiel?" Anna asked, reaching for a slice of the steaming bread.
I get out of the shower and dry myself. My body sticky from the humid bathroom, I decide not to change into my jeans and flannel, and I walk out of the bathroom with the towel around my waist.
Castiel leaned to grab his basket for Dean to put the fish in, and Dean announced, "Would you look at that, Cas! I caught me a big one!"
Castiel went through the doorway, into the cottage. He climbed up the stairway to his bedroom, and sat on the bedspread. He exhaled a breath, trying to slow the beat of his pumping heart.
"Cas!" I gasp when he starts sucking at my skin.
Cas looks pleased at the idea. "Have you ever wanted any pets? I mentioned the cat earlier..."
"You should remove your shoes. I cannot imagine them being comfortable, especially since we are going to be waiting for a while until enough fish are caught."
"Where we going first, Cas?"
"Did you buy condoms? And then fucking lube?" I ask in alarm.
Castiel looked away. "Are you ready to begin? Of course, you really do not have to help me, Dean. It was enough of a pleasure to talk to someone outside of my family for once."
"Wow, uh," Dean stammered, red slightly flushing across his cheeks. "Well, I like your flowers. These ones," he reached up and brushed his fingers across the wreath atop Castiel's head, the digits lightly grazing his hair and forehead.
"Cyanide," he says, then quickly adds, "but again I'm not administering a lethal dose. So please don't worry."
Castiel looks down his nose at me. "I don't do favors, I do jobs. If you could pay me somehow, I'd consider it."
"Yup."
Dean turned to Castiel rapidly, eyes full of expectation. His gaze warmed when he saw the circlet in Castiel's hands. "It's pretty," Dean said and edged next to him.
"Thank you."
Castiel took in the man's appearance. Seated on the horse, he seemed huge to Castiel. His simple green tunic was belted around his waist with a thick brown string, and the pants he wore beneath flared out around his legs, tucked into his heeled boots. His face, hard to see because of the bright sun burning behind him, seemed young, close to Castiel's own age.
Castiel left into the canopy of trees, his thoughts racing to remember where the nearest flowers were so he could return to Dean. He had realized he deeply enjoyed Dean's company, in spite of their brief time together. Castiel could not remember any time where he had been eager to return to his aunts after a long day out, and the new feeling of anticipation excited him.
Castiel was shaken out of his observations when the man spoke.
"It was more than alright, Dean," Castiel responded, his breath coming out in small pants. "Uhm, Winchester, it is that way. You should be able to make it there before sun down. Be safe, Dean. I look forward to seeing you again tomorrow."
"I apologize for bringing her up. The pain from those lost is always immense."
"I mean, it's not a huge difference. I turned nineteen a few months ago."
Rachel pouts, then gets up off the bed and strolls towards me, a smirk revealing itself on her face. "How about if I do this?" Rachel says, before sitting herself in my lap, and pressing her lips against me.
"Oh uh, cool, man." Dean pressed his lips together. Castiel moved and sat down on the edge of the running stream. "Uhm, yeah me too," Dean stuttered out.
I'm a little shocked. From someone who hadn't graduated high school, going to college just to get something "normal" seemed bizarre, and I realize I still have so much I need to learn about Cas.
"Don't fluff yourself too much. I wasn't "in awe at your awesomeness," I was thinking about you in an apron like her's, and how cute you'd look."
~•~•~•~•~
Come on, Dean. No panic attack now. No reason to be nervous. Just think about anything else.
"I was trying to get home. My dad wanted me back before sundown, especially since he didn't want me leaving in the first place. I didn't think I would find anyone here though." The man broke his smile with his tongue brushing between his teeth.
Castiel lowered the wreath down atop Dean's head, fingertips brushing Dean's short hair lightly. He admired the look of the crown on him, head tilting and lips pursing in realization of how endearing Dean looked with it on.
All I see is a grassy field, so different from the bustling city I was yanked from yesterday. I continue to stare outside, hoping to see someone or something, but after about half an hour, I give up. I sit up and step towards the bookshelf. I look at some of the titles. The  language is totally unfamiliar to me. Despite my parents' attempt to teach numerous languages to me, I refused out of spite for everything they put me through at such a young age. Besides, who the fuck even needs to know Latin when you're in the mob? All the books seem old though, like they should be sitting in a museum instead of my kidnappers' estate.
The door springs open as another person enters my room and moves to stand next to the man.
"I'm sorry." He looks down at his hands, nervously fidgeting with them as he talks. "But we'll need to administer another poison, so you can seem sick enough that you need to go to the hospital. And I'll offer to take you, but we won't go. I'll only give you a little bit of the poison, enough to make the symptoms arise, but not to kill you. And if the standard treatment of fresh air to treat the poison doesn't work, I'll have the antidote with me, one of the perks of being in an organized crime group." He smiles but it doesn't reach his eyes.
I hear the door handle turn and I face the door, mustering up more bravado than I actually feel. The door opens and Castiel steps in, closing the door quietly behind him.
"Thanks, Cas."
"Tell me."
"I have. It was an experience I would not like to relive for a moment, unfortunately."
"Who are you and what do you want with me?"
I nod and open the Twinkie, eating it slowly so as not to aggravate my recovering body. I finish the cake, then ask, "Where are we going to go now?"
"Your beauty will only be magnified with this, Dean. It only adds to what is already present."
I push a breath out of my mouth, then nod. "I'm ready. Go do your thing." I wink at him.
I hear someone stand up, then I hear them start walking towards where I am laying prone on the bed. I try to get up and move away from the lurking presence, but the, now annoying, pain keeps me stuck where I am.
Cas gets up and leaves the room, and I am left only shaking a little bit, my anxiety increasing as I think too much about it.
"Can you tell me more about why I'm here?" I push again, my head thankfully starting to feel a little bit better.
Castiel simply patted the ground next to him, and Dean soon joined him on the grass, copying Castiel's position.
Castiel bristled at the shortening of his name. "No one has ever shortened my name before. Is it commonplace among townspeople?"
I frown because I forgot to grab my clothes out of the bathroom. I open the closet and find a gray robe hanging there, courtesy of the motel, and put that on.
"Your wife and kids not entertaining enough?" Dean joked.
Cas rushes out of the room, and I clutch meekly at my chest. The pain seems to be building as time crawls slowly by.
I sit up and clap my hands together, startling Cas slightly. "I don't know about you, but I am so fucking ready for some pie!"
“But, Cas, I miss you inside me. Don’t you see how I’m aching for you to touch me?”
I shift suddenly in my seat, surprise making me inhale a sharp breath. "Really?" I ask.
Jo hands us the pie and Cas steps up to the counter to pay. We walk out of the bakery.
Tears prick at my eyes. Nobody had ever praised me as much as Cas does, and taking the compliments takes some getting used to. I continue getting him off, eager to finish him. Cas hands find my hair, my head, and eventually I let him take control of me. He’s very careful so as to not choke me, but with our eyes locked, his blackened with arousal, I find myself bending to his every will.
I think I pass out, which I've been doing a lot more often than usually lately. When I wake up, I'm being moved into a different car, in the parking lot of what looks like the hospital.
When we're dones, I grab the plates and shove them into the sink, then basically jump into Castiel. He grabs right ahold of me and our lips lock. The slide of his tongue against my lips has me gasp a breath out, and he immediately takes dominance in my mouth.
Cas leans forward and brushes his hand across my jaw, caressing it ever so lightly. I want to lean in. The physical intimacy he offers is so enticing.
"Hello," he says back. He walks towards the armchair by the window, and drags it towards me, sitting himself in it across from me. He rests his elbows on his considerably-sized thighs, and my eyes catch there. "My sister told me what happened."
The man looks at me, considering what I said. "While that may be true, Dean, you know I can't disobey orders from the boss."
Dean's eyebrows lifted. "Yeah, that's too long. I'm calling you Cas."
Castiel shook his head. "Death is never a happy ending, only a poor one."
"Not bad, Cas. I'll come here tomorrow?"
The man shrugs, his face blank. "I don't know what she wants with you. But I myself have learned that you can never escape your past easily." He runs a hand through his messy hair, the strands going effortlessly, well, everywhere. The movement makes me momentarily forget what he just said.
He distressed when Dean gingerly withdrew his hand. "Can't let you go too long without working on my crown, or else you won't get to finish it before I leave," Dean explained.
Castiel's eyebrows scrunched. "No, I do not. I have not interacted with another male in years, and they definitely were not as compassionate in temper as you."
"Ah, fuck," I say, right as I am shoved facedown into the hard concrete by a sudden push against my back.
At 12:30, Rachel returns, and I inwardly cringe as soon as she steps through the threshold, holding a bowl of steaming soup. She sets the bowl on the dresser before sitting on the bed, her favorite place to plop herself in.
Castiel nodded, and then looked to the sky above them. "It is getting quite late Dean. Would you like me to show you to my home, then you can head off towards Winchester?"
"I'm glad I'm different then. And," Dean spared a glance at the stream. "You do know how to flatter, Cas. In no time, I'll be begging to court you, you know."
We strap the mattress onto the top of the car and begin the journey back home, Cas reluctantly letting me choose the music and groaning quietly when I finally find the classic rock station.
I steady my breathing. "Yeah, just a little nauseous."
"Can I meet them?"
He finally finishes with my neck and disconnects from me to admire his work. I reach my arms out to him, desperate to get him close and onto me again.
I can feel my cheeks flush red.
~•~•~•~•~
"May I ask your name?" Castiel braved.
Dean, staring at Castiel with his red crown crooked on his head, smiling at Castiel brightly...
"How about both?" I ask.
Jo nods and busies herself with preparing our cake package. I tap Cas lightly on the arm. "What are we celebrating?"
I look at the stuff Cas bought. There's a couple of plain t-shirts, a package of laundry detergent, two toothbrushes, a tube of toothpaste, some boxers, a cutting knife and cutting board set, some plastic plates and silverware, a pair of scissors, some hair and body wash, and...
"They aren't home now?"
Lost in his thoughts, Castiel failed to notice Dean reaching for his hand. He jolted slightly when Dean's warm hand, slightly wet from the water, grazed against Castiel's open palm, moving to entwine itself in his fingers. Castiel looked up at Dean, but Dean did not share the gaze. His lashes were lowered, eyes beholding their locked hands. He had a warm beam on his face, one Castiel found himself recreating onto his own features. He relished in the soft touch, finding gentle comfort in the coupling of their hands. Dean appeared to savor it too.
I break the brief silence, opening my mouth to ask, "So...when do we start?"
I stare at Cas, letting my eyes run over his delicate yet strong features. So pretty, so handsome. The sense of want in me rises as I observe him. I kiss the side of his mouth, lightly to not wake him. Then I dive under the covers. Finding him down there is easy and I waste no time grabbing his dick and massaging it inti hardness. I hear Cas groan above the sheets. Smiling, I move my head to his dick and kiss the tip, like he had done yesterday. Another moan from Cas.
Castiel shook his head, embarrassment clouding his thoughts.
Soon enough, though, Cas' pants are off and I can see him straining against his boxers. I pant breaths out, and as I attempt to sit up, Cas pushes me back down, continuing his blow job. My mind goes blank as he slides his tongue over the tip, and then deep throats me. With one of his hands stroking my balls gently, it's not surprising that his other hand starts to drift towards my asshole.
"I like it already," I say.
"Are your parents alive?"
"I know of this place called Ball Ground. I had a friend from school that lived there before moving up here. It's about two hours from Atlanta, and an hour from the nearest suburb, so it sounded perfect to me."
"I seem to remember real fucking clearly, yes." He flinches at my words and the subtle dig in them.
"I will return soon, Dean."
I open my eyes slowly and glance down at the source of the pain: a syringe just removed from my forearm.
While he waited for the perfect moment to catch one of the fish, Castiel sung quietly, letting words flow from his mouth. Castiel's greatest joy was creation, of anything he could fix and make and rebuild. The ultimate season for creation had passed, and Castiel, now finding himself in summer, was also happy to be in the presence of all the life around him. His aunts had often cooed at his obsessive love of nature and environment, how he was ever eager to learn new things about the soil under his toes, the leaves fluttering above his head.
"I just don't understand," my voice cracks a little, "why does your boss want me?"
We unpack the car fairly quickly for the amount of stuff we had shoved back there. Putting up the clothes in the wardrobe, I realize a problem that we should deal with before it got too late in the day.
"I'm curious, Cas. I've never met anyone quite like you either, you know. And you're very interesting."
"We were thinking of stepping into Winchester for new fabrics," Mirabel explained. Castiel nodded. The nearby kingdom of Winchester was a large and bustling one, and technically they had reign of the forest Castiel and his aunts resided in. He had been through the town once, when he was fourteen and his hair had grown free and he had been desperate to get out of the woods at all times. Castiel was happy that Mirabel, who had been nagging Rachel and Anna about them needing new gowns, had finally broken in her sisters to visiting the nearby kingdom.
"Regardless, you can come inside after you arrive. My aunts will likely want to meet you."
“You, Dean Winchester,” he gasps out as I continue sucking him off nonchalantly, “Are the most loving and caring human being I have ever known.”
A slightly worried look passed over Cas' face. "You will probably be fine, maybe just your last name. I'll probably need to change mine."
"Of course, man. It would be rude for me to just show up without asking." Dean paused, then lightly shoved Castiel's shoulder, pointing down into the water. "How about that one? I'd bet I can catch it."
"I hope you have a good journey into Winchester. I'll try to catch some fish in the stream when I check upon the bees. Hopefully we can feast on that tonight." Castiel stood up, rubbing his hands together to shake off loose crumbs.
I feel a smile tugging at the corners of my mouth. If we escape together, we both know who and what to avoid, where we can stay hidden together. It's much more appealing than the circumstances in which I left my house 10 years ago.
Cas' eyebrows shift up. "I know, Dean." We continue walking towards our room. "And if you have cravings for anything else, just let me know."
He laid on his bed sheets, his forgotten wreath of flowers falling off his head when it hit the pillow. He reached for the flowers and held them lovingly in his grasp.
The man speaks, his normal indifference dissipating at the woman's presence. "Hello, boss. I gave him the antidote, and I've left the explanation for you to do, since you were the one that wanted him here. I'm leaving now."
"I wish my parents had tried harder to teach me any language. I only know English, and a little bit of Spanish."
Cas flushes. "Let's go get married."
When I finish working, I glare at Cas. "Thanks for your help, sweetheart."
A concerned look openly visible on his face, Cas puts a hand on my shoulder. "Has it started?"
I hear Cas rush up the stairs and point accusingly at the bed. Well, bed frame.
I almost don't want him to leave, it seemed like he was starting to listen to what I was saying, but the woman, his boss, nods, only saying, "Leave, Castiel."
Cas looks at me and smiles. He gets up from where he was sitting on the bed and walks towards me. He runs his fingers through my hair lovingly, then walks into the bathroom. I hear the shower running a moment later.
Castiel looked up and saw his cottage ahead. "Here is where I live," he addressed Dean.
After a couple paces into the trees, he paused and inhaled deeply. The smell of nature was something holy to him; he reveled in it every time he was in its inviting presence. Turning his face to the tops of the great trees, the sun shone brightly on him. After a moment, Castiel began to run towards the stream, eager to relax in his favorite place. The journey really wasn't as long as his aunts thought, especially at the pace he was going. Castiel did stop every so often, though, to pick flowers for his basket and to grab sweet berries to snack on.
I whirl on him, and see his eyes wide at my sudden movement. "You- you think? What the fuck does that mean?"
"I'm gay, lady." Not exactly true, more bi, but I can't exactly just let myself get assaulted by some random chick.
I look up and it's the man again, and he's staring at me intently.
"I have three aunts: Rachel, Mirabel, and Anna. Rachel is the eldest of them. She is very much protective of us all. Mirabel is a skilled seamstress. She made this for me," Castiel broke from his craft and touched his skirt lightly. "And Anna is the youngest. Her passion is baking."
Nobody can save me.
“I think I’ve created a monster,” Cas responded before grabbing my dick and placing a deep kiss onto my lips.
"No, it means you are the only one who can call me Cas."
"I try to catch the largest ones, so that I do not have to spend as much time fishing for them. My aunts, especially Anna, also appreciate the fact that they do not have to prepare as many fish."
Castiel smiled at Dean's enthusiasm and glanced at the accused fish. "It looks perfect, Dean. Would you like help to catch it?"
"So, Dean. How are you liking it here? Have you considered what I've said?" Rachel presses, leaning forward to show off her cleavage pushing out of her very low cut dress. My stomach turns at the sight.
"Which is why I," he takes a shaky breath. "I'm going to leave with you, Dean."
Cas squeezes my hand. "I'm sorry." He glances me over. "If it's any consolation, you're beautiful."
"You don't want that, I presume?"
"What did you find?" I ask Cas.
"Yes."
"She's your sister? No wonder you couldn't leave. If she's as goddamn insistent with you as she is with me, I'm surprised you aren't at her side all the fucking time," I remark.
"That's a shame. Sorry about that."
Cas steps back, looking ashamed and flustered. "I'm sorry, Dean, I just thought I should let you know that I'm falling for you. Hard. And I think I'm in love with you."
Then he pulls me up to him and kisses me deeply, the slide of our tongues together making us moan.
He stepped towards the door and was suddenly ambushed with loving embraces from his aunts, bidding him good travels, safety, and, most importantly, good fishing. Castiel grabbed the basket he kept by the door for food he found while out and finally walked across the threshold.
Cas pulls the car into a backwoods property that looks like it hasn't been touched in years.
My heart races as fear overcomes me, and I don't speak or move, and I try to make my breathing as shallow as I can.
"It's perfect, Dean."
Castiel stared at the man on the horse who had broken into the clearing, the small space across the stream no filled with the large presence of the man and his steed.
The shout was incoherent to him, too far away to hear anything, but it alarmed Castiel nonetheless. He had neither seen nor heard anyone in the parts of the forest he was usually in, not that seeing or hearing anybody was a regular occurrence to him. Castiel's intrigue peaked when he heard the noises of hooves clomping, getting louder and louder and louder until finally—
I draw out of his arms slightly. "Cas..."
"Only a little bit."
Castiel watched the movement curiously. He had never bothered to pay attention to anybody he had seen before as intensely as he was watching this man. Maybe it was because of the place, he thought. Or because it was the first person he had seen since early spring, except his dear aunts.
"Cas! We don't have a mattress!"
"Please call me Cas. If anyone is nosy enough to ask, just say it's a nickname."
Maybe if I keep talking to Castiel, he could get me out of here.
Lady, you didn't even know him. I shrug. "I did too, but he's gone now. You can't bring him back." No matter how hard you try. I take a tired breath. Thankfully, my headache is almost completely gone, but now I am just tired. "So, since I am not at all who you wanted, can you let me go now? I won't press charges."
Cas takes in a deep breath. "Let's go find that motel, and hopefully they have a fridge that we can put the pie in."
This train of thought continues, until it's put to a halt by Cas coming back into the room. A steaming cup of coffee in his hand, he sits back down in front of me and carefully hands the mug to me.
After a couple of minutes of torture, I apparently lose consciousness because, suddenly, I am woken up by a sharp pain in my arm, different from the throb in my head.
I hear the door close again as he exits the room, and I am left alone with the 'boss' who apparently wants me.
Dean chuckled. "Think of it as friendly, Cas. You seem like a good enough man."
We have to drive about an hour before we reach the nearest mattress store. I've been so focused on Cas and me working that I completely forgot that Cas was real fucking rich. The expensive mattress he buys us feels well worth the cost in the store.
"What? They just taste better when they're shaped like dinos!" I defend.
"Yup," I say weakly. Fuck that hurts.
After a few moments, he releases me. I'm left a little dazed, and hardly realize that he's leaving until I hear the door close quietly. I sit down on the bed for a minute, trying to catch my mind up to the events of this morning. I slowly dress myself and get ready, snagging some of the food we grabbed yesterday as breakfast. I leave a note on the complementary notepad the motel offers, telling Cas where I am if he happens to get back before me. And the. I exit the room.
Cas pushes me to the kitchen wall, stopping when my back thumps on the surface, and then he touches me. His hands sliding reverently up and down my sides, catching on my shirt, lifting the material up. I gasp into his mouth slightly at the brush of cool air against my torso and he disconnects our lips. I frown at the loss as he removes my shirt, but soon his mouth is on my neck, pressing tender kisses into the soft skin there. He licks and scrapes his teeth there and I whimper, clutching into his hair.
"I know." Castiel grinned, acknowledging the caution his aunt offered. But once Castiel had his mind set to something, he wasn't one to let anyone ruin his day. "What about all of you?"
"Those are nice," Dean said. "I caught another one, but not as big." Dean shrugged and gestures towards the basket.
"Yes, I do. I was fishing here before you came by." Castiel took a step closer to the man, feeling the urge to step over the stream between them, something he had never done before. "What might you be doing out here? I can't imagine there being much to hunt in these woods. I have never seen anything larger than a rare deer running past."
"I mean, I am bisexual, and have known that since I was at least 14, but I haven't slept with a man...ever. Don't get me wrong, it's not as if I'm not attracted to you, because believe me, wow look at you..." I admire him for a moment. Those strong arms, large hands, beautiful face. "But I would like us to know more about each other before we have sex."
"I was poisoned?"
"No, not to your earlier question. I would like you to court me," Castiel insisted.
I take the plate into my hands and eat, my still-sensitive stomach growling at the warm smell and taste. The casserole makes me feel better, restores my energy, and clears my head.
I giggle. “Just sore, Cas. It’s alright. Just wasn’t expecting it, but I guess you did ram into me pretty hard.” I wink at him.
"Yeah, I'll have one too. And a side order of fries. Thanks." I smile awkwardly at her.
Cas and I didn't bring anything to unpack, so I'm guessing our next stop is a grocery store or a convenience store, so we can get food, clothing, and anything else we may need.
"Yup, I really am." Charlie comes back to our table with three plastic baskets, two with hotdogs in them, one with a mountain of fries.
Eventually, I get up out of the bed, my legs shaky and weak from disuse. I walk around the room, finally seeing it's full size as I emerge from the cocoon of drapes around the large bed.
I shift in my seat and glance around, making sure nobody was close enough to hear him say that. Then, I kick him under the table.
"No one human. I took care of a small squirrel I found one day while I was out." Castiel continued working. "She had fallen from a tree, and I took her home and nursed her back to health. When I attempted to release her, she only returned to me. I named her Hannah. She passed a few years later of some sickness I was unable to cure."
Boy oh boy was I wrong.
Cas...
"We need to be prepared, Dean."
"If I may ask, sir," Cas says as we walk inside. "Why are you selling?"
I'm bouncing in Cas' arms as he practically sprints out the front door toward whatever vehicle he has secured for us. He lays me gently in the back seat, then starts driving the car.
I wake up from my impromptu "nap" in a dark room, lying flat on my back in a large four-poster bed. The sheets must have a thread count of at least 1000; they are the softest thing I have ever layer upon. The pillows are plush and it feels as though I am being absorbed into them. The black see-through drapes hanging from the rim of the bed obscure my view of the rest of the room.
I inhale suddenly and loudly as the drapes are drawn back, revealing a man I had seen before at my work. He would stop by the café I worked at every so often, and we would exchange pleasantries as I took his order, but I don't understand what he is doing here.
"I went to Winchester with my aunts, when I was younger. It felt too crowded and loud, and I was honestly overwhelmed."
"Become the beast with two backs," he finishes.
Cas steps in, "And could we get a pie? We're celebrating something...important."
"Tell me about your aunts, Cas. What are they like?"
"I am sorry you feel that way, Dean. If it is of any comfort, I find you to be quite satisfactory."
"Goodnight, Dean."
Dean grimaced. "Sorry about that, man. Can I help?"
"Be careful, Castiel. The journey that way isn't a small one," Rachel warned.
"I'll go anywhere with you, Dean." He locks eyes with me and I swallow.
"I've always wanted a black one, with some ridiculous name." He looks me in the eyes. "Wouldn't that be nice?"
Castiel was faintly distraught in the ease he encountered around Dean. The excitement of a possible friendship with some besides his dear aunts was part of the delight he sensed around him, Castiel assumed. Lack of interaction with others close in age to him could also be accounted for as a reason.
I inwardly squeal at how adorable the simple action is. I stand up and walk to the dresser to put the empty mug down. Sitting back across from Cas, I attempt to start a conversation with longevity to waste time while we wait for the poison to start making me feel sick.
"My name is Castiel."
Cas and I stop at a hotdog place and ask our bouncy waitress for advice on lodgings in the area.
"Why?" Castiel questioned.
Castiel looks down my body, then back up, his piercing gaze stopping at my lips for a moment, before meeting my eyes. "I'm sure you're much better than your brother in all regards though."
His beautiful eyes go dark again, filled with want. I delight in the knowledge that that's all for me. And then he takes me back in his mouth, his fingers rubbing over my asshole again and again and again until—
Dean's eyes went wide again, something they tended to do when Castiel surprised him, he noticed.
"Nothing." Castiel moves to leave again, but I catch his arm, my fingers seeming to move on their own. I'm surprised by just how jacked he feels for a moment.
In the morning, I wake up and my back is cold. I wonder at how Cas managed to undo himself from me in the middle of the night without waking me up, but I am soon pulled from my thoughts as Cas steps out of the bathroom, dressed and ready for the day.
"If you boys need anything else, let me know!" She moves to walk away, but I stop her.
The length of flower-rope Castiel held had considerably lengthened, and he showed his progress off to Dean.
"I'm just surprised. She's never shown any interest in anybody."
I nod, evidently too fresh from sleep to think and speak coherently.
It reads:
~•~•~•~•~
"The one where you eventually fall for me." Dean winked and Castiel flushed.
Cas rolls his eyes and gives in, tossing me the keys. I hop into the pretty crappy car, not the worst choice though, and rev the engine. Living in the city made me miss late nighttime drives. I drive us back towards the motel, practically bouncing in my seat at the thought of the pie awaiting us there. Cas smiles softly at me every so often and I try not to notice. Feelings never having been my strong suit, I try to think less about the man I am now married to and focus on the purr of the engine, the wheel in my hands, and the road ahead.
"Cas! Oh please, right there!" I gasp out. Cas slides his face into my neck again, and I don't care this time. The light nips at my neck, the hands gripping my waits, Cas sheathing himself inside me, it's all breathtaking. My breath is consistently robbed from me as Cas continues to pound into me and soon I'm coming, squeezing around Cas as I fall into completion. I weakly tilt my hips up as Cas chases his orgasm, and then he's collapsing into me, our chests rising and falling at an even speed.
"Yes." I swoon. "Its Enochian, but I haven't spoken it in a long time. It's an old language, and I've never heard of anyone but people in my, admittedly large, family speaking it. They took it upon themselves to teach everyone who came into the business. I forgot those books were even in here." He chuckles fondly.
He quietly wraps his arms around me, and I sigh into the tender embrace. Cas' hugs, the warmth in them, is something I can never get tired of.
Castiel nodded. "Of course, if that is what you would like, Dean."
Cas sits up and calmly gets out the napkins and forks, while I zero-in on the holy cherry pie. Opening the box it's perfectly packaged in, I sniff the pie and moan at the divine smell.
"I married my second wife this last week and I'm moving in with her because she has the bigger house. I'll be leaving most of the furniture here. I'm only going to be taking the couch in the living room and the mattress out of the bedroom. Feel free to get rid of the rest of the furniture, or keep it if y'all like it."
"Are you hiring here?"
Dean gulped. "I'm sorry about that, Cas."
"I got it. If I had known that after I left, my brother would take a turn for the worse, becoming someone I couldn't recognize, I would have come back too. But I cut off all contact with my family when I left; I only heard about his death on the news four years ago," I explain.
"Is Sam not fairly young to be getting married?"
I turn towards Cas, who's sitting across from me. "Do you think I could be a waiter here? It seems like a decent enough job. And Charlie is the only one in here now, and it's almost lunch time!"
When I step out of the shower, a towel is left for me, along with a change of clothing. I dry myself and change into the comfy flannel and jeans and run my fingers through my hair. I'm already feeling infinitely better than a couple hours before.
"I'll show you when we get back."
Dean, already moving, replied, "Nope, I'm going to get it."
I clutch at his hand as we walk out of the court, a bout of dizziness coming over me.
"Well, I got a brother. His name's Sam, or, uh, Samuel, I guess. He's about four years younger than me, but he's so much smarter than me."
As soon as Cas unlocks our room, I rush to the bathroom, ready to bathe all the stench of our travels off of me. As I shower, I can hear Cas bustling around the room.
"Yes, I saw a convenience store a couple buildings away from the motel. I was thinking we could just walk there."
Castiel tilted his head. "Why would I want that?"
"Do not negate your own brightness like that. You managed to pick up on fishing much faster than I did," Castiel protested as Dean captured another fish and placed it in the basket.
~•~•~•~•~
Tomorrow, he thought. He gets to see Dean again tomorrow.
I grab Cas' napkin when we're both done, and say over my shoulder, "I'm going to brush my teeth."
"Wow, Cas, tell me what you really think."
"Wait," I say. "Could you help me convince her that she doesn't need me here? So I can go? Please?"
Cas and I shake the old man's hand and walk out of the house, our house. We hop in the car and leave the property.
Waking up early was routine for Castiel. He could never quite make it to sleeping past dawn and he has forever loved the melodies the songbirds sang in the early hours of day. The pleasant life Castiel had living in the forest was far preferred to living in a bustling town and, despite his brief want to leave his life in the woods a couple years ago, the noises of the bustling town, the  overwhelming smells he encountered, the repetitive and loud sounds of people speaking and shouting far too loudly, everything about the place had overloaded his senses. The experience brings an unpleasant memory to Castiel every time thoughts of it arise in his mind. And now, he could never see himself living outside of the woods he had called home as long as he could remember.
A pretty blonde woman pokes her head up from behind the counter. "Speaking," she says.
"Do you need some help with this, Dean?" His fingers brush over my growing erection, and I shut my eyes at the sensation. Cas' hand moves back and forth lightly, stopping every other touch to palm me through the boxer briefs.
"Thank you, Dean." Cas smiles. "I was thinking of looking for work myself today."
"Hello, Dean. You're awake."
"Did you tell that man you were buying them for your spouse or something? 'Cause I don't think he was expecting me to be your husband."
True terror seeps into my gut, settling there in the most unpleasant area it could.
Eventually I sit up in bed and try to stand, but sudden pain sits me back down. Cas shoots up in bed.
"Is that who you mentioned earlier? You live with them?"
I shoot up in bed. "Yeah? Well you- you look like you're from heaven."
Castiel swallowed a bite before answering. "I was thinking about checking on the hives across the stream. It has been a moment since I've headed there, and I want to see how they are faring." His excitement flared at the thought of spending the day sitting by the bubbling stream and listening to the hum of the dainty creatures fly through the air.
He gets up and grabs the lube from its convenient spot in the nightstand drawer, and squirts some on. Warming the liquid, he places soft kisses on my chest, trailing down to my dick. Then, he's touching me again, pressing his finger lightly inside me. I gasp at the touch and nod, encouraging him to continue. He pushes one finger fully inside me, stretching me out, and I feel a spike of arousal at the feeling, feeling so full with his finger exploring me. Soon enough, another finger is inside me, and the feeling is building up in me.
"That's alright with me. See you then, or sooner if you decide to come back for more of our dogs."
Cas shakes his head. “So what would you like to do today?”
~•~•~•~•~
"Ah, Jo. She's such a nice lady. Yes, I am selling, would you like to come look inside?"
I jump as the door freaks open. It's Castiel, and he seems shocked to see me upright instead of laying down on the bed.
"No, but I am most frequently nearby. I could show you where I live, and you could come by every day if you so desired."
I raise an eyebrow at him. "That's all you got from that?"
We talk quietly about our days, and Cas tells me how he found a job in accounting at the local law firm. Eventually, we go to bed, Cas entwining himself with me again. I sigh comfortably and fall asleep with ease.
~•~•~•~•~
“Well, we both have the day off...so a couple more rounds? We’ll get pie in between. I still need to see if the cherry pie is still better than sex.”
"Where'd you go?"
She spins around to face me again. "It's not that easy! I tried before and you barely even looked at me!"
"Please don't worry about that, Dean. I got it handled. Luckily, I've had my own private bank account for years. Rachel has no idea it exists. We should have enough money in there for at least two years. By then we should have jobs, an apartment, and maybe a cat for good measure."
I chuckle lightly and push at his arm with the hand not holding his. He grins at me, and I grin back.
Castiel smirks. "I don't lie, Dean."
"You're not pressuring me. Of course I'll be Dean Smith!" I leap across the couch and hug him tightly, his arms coming up my back to hold me to him after a moment.
I mentally slap myself.
"If you're a good boy and will come with me and do all the talking as we look at the house on that little post-it note there."
Finally, I manage to push her off of me and onto the floor. I rush towards the bathroom, and lean over the toilet, heaving breaths into the bowl. I'm shaking and sweating and freezing all at the same time. I gag into the toilet, then feel my stomach upend itself.
And I drink it.
Cas drives us around Ball Ground while we look for a place to eat. We come across a little German restaurant and decide to dine there. We are seated at a little booth and I order a Jägerschnitzel and Cas orders a sausage sampler. We get our food very quickly and eat like we haven't eaten in years.
"You'll be easy to cook for, then." I glance around the room, looking for more things to talk about. "Hey, I saw this bookshelf with all those books," I point towards the shelf, "Do you read and speak whatever language that is?"
Castiel squinted at Dean. "I never knew them."
And he did.
As the man stepped closer, Castiel watched his face become more visible. He was beautiful and had very handsome features, a strong nose, full lips, and alluring eyes that shone green in the light.
I move to him immediately at the thought of the pie in my mouth finally. He smiles at me, grabs the box from my hands, and cuts us pieces.
"This is an old cabin my parents owned for when we wanted to escape the city for a while. We never used it though. I doubt Rachel even knows where it is, but just to be safe, we'll only stay here for a little bit. Just enough time to get you cleaned off."
"Awesome," he breathes out. "So, here's the thing." His face falls. "I'll need you to do something. And if you can't do it, I understand, but this is the only idea for escape I have been able to come up with."
"What about your parents?"
"I'm going to look so pretty," Dean laughed.
I hide my face in my hands, slightly embarrassed. No wonder the man at the counter looked so surprised.
I feel my eyes tearing up again as he speaks.
Dean's eyebrows rose with interest. "You're older than me."
"Yeah," Dean said, then dove his hands into the water.
I moan. "Please, Cas, touch me."
"I was thinking some small town, about an hour away from a suburb where we can get anything we won't be able to get in the town. And of course in a different state. I was thinking down in Georgia? That's far enough from here...we'll have to drive it though. It'll be about two days worth of driving, but by the time we get there, you should be completely better."
She stops moving, a look of hazy confusion crossing over her features.
"My dad asks me that every day. I haven't found anyone, and it pisses him off so much. He's about ready to marry me off to the next person who shows up at our door."
"For now, we only watch them. We wait for them to calm down. Your horse splashing through their home likely scared them off."
“You’ve been kidnapped, clearly.”
"Then you know how inconvenient this is for me, man. If you tried to leave too, and couldn't, you know what I was trying to escape, don't you? And you know that if our places were switched, you would want out just as much as I do."
Castiel was pleasantly surprised at the ease at which Dean had caught the fish. And Dean's delight, of course, was memorable.
"See what?"
The boss continues to stare at me, before realizing that I've spoken.
"We also need some pepper and cinnamon. Our stores are running low," Anna said. Castiel's stomach delighted at the thought of Anna's specialty sweet cinnamon bread.
Castiel was about to reach out and grab one of the larger fish he saw, when he heard a sudden and loud shout. It startled him away from the stream, his bare feet nearly hitting against some of the rocks on the edge of the water.
Cas hums in response and I hear him stand up. The rest of the noise he makes is drowned out by the rush of water and the scrubbing of teeth. I spit out the toothpaste and go back to the bedroom.
"Who would? I'd like to know someone before I decide to tie the knot..." Dean's eyes caught at Castiel's. "How old are you anyway?"
If Cas is going to work, I can too!
I move to take a sip, then stop. "W-What about money, and...and jobs? When we leave?"
Content with enjoying the many sounds around him, Castiel laid down on the grass and spread out his arms. He dozed peacefully for a moment, and felt himself slip out of consciousness. He dreamt lightly, of pretty little things, dancing, flowers, various woodland creatures.
I choke up slightly, fascinated as to how Cas, motherfucking Castiel, could be in love with him. I had thought the small twinges in my heart, the sense of belonging in my mind, the love in my soul would be completely one-sided.
"I'm sure she left happy, at least."
"Not bad? NOT BAD? Buddy, we need to go on a pie tour so you can understand how good this pie is."
The man nods.
He smiles slightly, amused at my distress.
"Oh. I think I am beginning to like you more, though." Castiel looked down at his lap, the wreath of red stark against the beige of his skirt. He began braiding the last of the flowers together while Dean went back to fishing. "Would you tell me more about your family? Not your father, though. I cannot think of him in a high regard knowing how relentlessly he expects you to hold up to his imagined destiny for you."
His smile is now genuine, so real that my heart skips a beat. I haven't been hopeful in a while, but seeing his face at this moment, it brings all sorts of uplifting emotions to me.
"Then we are the same age for now."
The man rested his hands on his hips, bracing them there as he stretched his back. "What are you doing out here? You live near here?"
"I'll need to go grab the poison first. I'll give it to you in some coffee, we'll wait a bit, about 20 minutes, until you start feeling something, and then I'll go tell Rachel that you aren't feeling well. It should be smooth sailing on the plan from then on," Cas patiently explains.
"Thank you, Dean. Your help means the world to me." Castiel was sincere. With only his aunts usually around him, they never let Castiel do much work besides that of which was of his own ideas.
"Good," Cas says, a brief moment later. "Would you like to help unpack the car with me?"
I feel my eye twitch as I listen to her recount our initial meeting. "I don't remember that. Are you sure it was me you were talking to? And not my brother? We didn't really look alike when we were teenagers, but people still got us confused."
"What's this?"
"Were you born into the criminal underworld as well, then?"
"Excuse me?" Her confusion changes into incredulity.
She stops in her tracks. "No. I'll wear you down and one day you will be begging for me to be with you." Then she leaves.
He responds, his voice just as deep as I remember from our few interactions before, "I'm not privy to that information."
She freezes. "Excuse me? You have a brother?"
"You're recovery, me rescuing you from hell, the place once called home, and..." Cas reaches for my hand. "Our marriage."
Castiel tilted his head again, gaze confused. "I am unwed and childless."
"Hello, sir. My name is Dean...Smith. I'm new in town, just got here today. I was told you were hiring waitstaff?"
I grin at him and grab his hand, walking with him out the door.
Cas, looking a little concerned at this point about my devotion to pie, scoffs. "You haven't been having the best sex then." He takes his first bite of pie. "I'll admit, it's not bad though."
Cas has shoved the extra decorative pillows to the floor and changed into a plain t-shirt and his underwear to sleep in. He brushes past me to go to the bathroom and I quickly change into some sweatpants and a t-shirt. I lay down in the bed, facing towards the nightstand.
"You can't just go saying stuff like that. Makes a guy begin to think you like him."
"Oh, uh..." Her face takes on a red hue, partially visible in the dim light. "I, uh...wanted to get to know you, Dean. On an emotional level...and maybe more?" She looks away from my face.
"I see."
Dean swiftly caught up to Castiel. "Awesome. I can't wait, Cas. Castiel."
"I still like it," I whisper to Cas.
He looks at me curiously. "Are you alright? Can I get you anything?"
"I really don't care, as long as I'm not the only one taking care of it." I wink at him. "Maybe a couple of tetras? I've always liked how calm fish tanks are."
Dean squirmed uncomfortably. "Anyway, Sammy's lover, Eileen, is basically part of our family too. She's awesome and real cool. I'm excited for when Sam finally gets up the nerve to ask her to marry him. They're going to have the biggest wedding in town."
"Payment?" Castiel asked, eyebrows furrowing. "I do not have anything currently with me that I can give in thanks to you."
"Oh, well there's a small motel a little down the street. They should be able to get y'all settled until you find a place. I think there're couple of properties around the edge of town, though, where y'all can live. I'd go ask Jo about it though. She owns the bakery next door and knows all the town's latest happenings." Her southern drawl is pronounced in her diction, and I find it charming. Maybe Ball Ground won't be so bad? "Would you boys like to like anything to eat?"
"You could always return to me," Castiel supplied.
"No, no, I get it. I understand. Sometimes, I just need to get out of there too," Dean confided. "It's why I came out here today. And then I stumbled upon you. You know you made my day, Cas, right?"
"Please."
Charlie nods. "I'll tell boss about you, he'll probably come talk to you after y'all finish eating. Enjoy your meal!"
Cas puts his hand on his chin and rubs it, observing the cakes with a pensive stare. "That's a lot of responsibility coming from you. We'll take the cherry pie, please."
"Maybe once we're out of here, I can teach you?" Cas suggests.
It's becoming hard to think, but not hard enough to notice that one of Cas' hands is touching himself. I pull him off of me and he stares at me, a little pissed at his removal.
"I can get away. For you, I will find a way."
After I wake up from my deep sleep, the clock reads it is 7:00pm. Next to the clock is a plate of some type of casserole dish, a note on top of the fork.
Castiel slid his gaze over Dean's face, admiring him openly. Castiel had never seen someone who wore their expressions so open and unguarded in front of strangers. But Castiel also took value in Dean's trust of him.
“What can I say, Cas? I like it when you fuck me hard.”
We get back into the car, this time I'm sitting in the passenger seat, though.
"Of course, Cas. Wow," Dean stammered out. "I...are you available tomorrow?"
"What game?"
When we reach Virginia the next day, we are both a little worse for the wear. We stop in Richmond and Cas gets his name legally changed to Steve Smith.
I increase my walking pace, hoping to get back sooner. I hear Cas laugh behind me, and then he's right next to me again.
"I trust you, Cas." At the nickname, he startles slightly. "I don't know if I should, but I do. If you think this will work, and that we can get out of here...then I'm with you. 100%."
A look of pure fascination finds its place in her expression, the look semi-familiar to me, as I'm sure I myself have made the same face on numerous occasions. What I can't understand, though, is why.
"I told you I left my family's business, mostly because I wanted to do something normal. Accounting seemed like a very normal course of action, so I pursued it. I never got to actually do it, though. Rachel forced me back into the family business again, and I couldn't exactly do both. But I'm sure some place here is looking to hire someone to manage funds."
"Are you feeling alright?"
"I have a degree in accounting, so I was thinking I could do something with that."
"It's alright," he says, and his voice is so desperate that I meet his eyes. "I just wanted to say that I am so, so sorry. I have never hated her more."
I'm left alone in the room again, the plate of food still full in my lap. I stare down at it and slide the egg onto the toast, making a sad little sandwich.
I rack my head for if, or when, I may have seen her face before, but nothing comes up. "When did you try?"
"Thanks, Cas. I try." Dean smiled at Castiel, and Castiel felt his shoulders slacken once more.
When I finish puking, I hear the door to the room open, then close again. I stand up on shaky legs and grab the bowl of soup, then dump it into the sink, washing its contents down with water. I can't bring myself to eat anything she touched.
Suddenly, Dean moved towards the water and took held of another fish, this one bigger than the last.
The boss sits down on the bed, staring at me laying there.
"My twentieth birthday is in a couple months."
Dean locked gazes with Castiel once more. "I don't think I'll be able to get away that often. My dad..."
"Yeah, I get it, I'm amazing," Dean replied nonchalantly.
The waitress scribbles our orders down on her tiny notepad she procured from her apron. "Well, I'll send that to the cook. Please just flag me down if you need anything at all. My name's Charlie." She half walks, half skips away from our table.
"Then, yes. I'm ready."
"Okay. So to court now?"
"Don't blame Baby, she's trying her best," Dean bantered.
I gasp, "I'd almost forgotten! Of course I'm ready. I'm driving though." I level my gaze at him.
"Is," he takes a deep breath, "Is this alright? If you don't want to, I understand. You can be in me or we don't have to do it with penetration, or we can just stop here."
"My boss finds you interesting, Dean Winchester. I was just ordered to watch over you for now."
My chest twinges a little at the earnest he presents the words with. "Thanks, Cas. And I think I'll be fine if you want to cuddle..." I shy off at the end of the sentence.
His breath brushes by my neck and he asks, "Is this alright?"
The next two weeks continue much the same way, Cas and I going off to work to come back to the motel room. The small living space is starting to get in both of our nerves, so when we finally get the 'ok' from the man who sold us his house, Cas and I can't wait to move in. We grab the numerous things we have accumulated over the past weeks and throw them in the back of the car. Then we drive to our house.
Dean scoffed. "Yeah, you could say that. He has this idea in his head that I'm the so-called 'perfect' son. I-I can't live up to his expectations."
"Now, I'm gonna be here still for two more weeks, but after then, I'll cash this check and the house is yours."
"She raised Rachel and me, so to some degree, we were fairly close. But I came back because I felt responsible for the way Rachel's life was heading after our mom died."
He smooths down his shirt. "You are too, Dean Winchester."
I quickly agree, and almost choke myself on the burger I made trying to eat it so fast. Cas stares fondly at me almost the whole meal, his eyes only fluttering shut every time he takes a bite of the burger.
I can't look at him after he says this. I'm so ashamed of myself and embarrassed about my reaction that meeting his eyes seems frightening.
"Dean- you were asleep when I came in, so I left this here for you. If you have decided you do want to get out of here, slide this note back under your door, into the hallway. If you don't, just toss the note. It's green bean casserole, in case you were curious. -Castiel."
"They should not have returned yet. They went to Winchester to purchase necessities this morning."
"A cat and a fish tank: what could go wrong!" He chuckles lightly, the deep sound resonating in me.
"Please, Cas," I moan out.
I look down at my food and pick up the hotdog. Biting into it, I almost gasp at the flavor. Coming from New York to Georgia, hotdogs were not the thing on my mind that I thought would improve, but I stand corrected. Well, sit corrected.
Cas stares at me. "That I can do."
"Yes, Dean."
It doesn't taste bad at all.
"I mean it, Dean," Cas says sternly, his voice lowering, and if that doesn't get my attention...
I look at him intensely. "Cas, I know we're married and shit, but I would really like to wait a little bit before we, y'know—"
Castiel rolled his eyes and pulled Dean's head down to look at the blue water.
I make a move to sit upright, but I am stopped by a clanging pain that shoots through my head. I groan in frustration.
"It is perfect, Dean." Castiel put on his shoes and stood up, gathering his basket to his side. He began walking toward his home, Dean walking next to him, Baby trailing behind him.
I grin and look down into the coffee. "Yup."
"You don't have to do anything, Cas. I was seriously joking."
"Cas," I beckon.
"Why the hell would your 'boss' want anything to do with me? I purposefully gave myself the most vanilla life when I left my home as soon as I graduated high school. I'm not in the so-called family business anymore. I thought once I left home, all would clear up!"
Cas withdraws his fingers from me and I frown at the empty feeling they leave. And then I hear the crinkle of foil. I reach down to help Cas put the condom on, wanting to touch him more than anything. He feels solid in my hand. I stroke him a few times, enjoying the feel of him in my hand, and Cas eventually pushes me back down. His lube slick fingers guide him towards me, and I brace myself for the feeling. There's a light pain as Cas finally gets past my rim, and then I'm cleaning at him, trying to get him closer to me, deeper in me.
Dean had awakened sensations in Castiel that he had not felt before. It was new and exciting and scary and Castiel loved it.
It takes little thought to decide that, yes, I do want Cas to fuck my mouth. I lick his slit, saliva sliding down him, then take some of him into my mouth. My gag reflex unfortunately isn’t nonexistent, but I use my hands to make up for what I can’t take into my mouth. The taste of Cas is slightly musty and salty, but not all that bad, and I quickly find myself adoring the taste. I experimentally suck on him, and Cas let’s put a shout and then the sheets are off of me and I am staring at Cas’ eyes.
The morning after, I manage to wake up before Cas for the first time in, well as long as I’ve known him. He’s resting peacefully, his dark hair brushed across his forehead, the rest sticking every which way like he had just been fucked. Which was true, this time.
I can only nod, sleep wearing me down. "G'night, Cas."
"Wash everywhere," he instructs, then leaves me alone.
"You didn't get any food yesterday, and we can't have you starving before my sister gets her wishes answered."
I hear Rachel say, "Please bring him back home safe, Cassie!" and I flinch at the grating sound of her voice.
When Cas finally shouts out a warning and attempts to pull me back, I stay locked onto him. His come hitting my mouth makes me moan, and I like up the drops that slip out. Cas looks at me with wide eyes.
"You drooled like you were there, too," Cas remarks.
I deflate. "Well thanks for nothing, whoever the fuck you are. I hope you'll regret this soon."
The man's eyes seem to glow in the poorly lighted room, their blue color looking more black.
"I can think of something." He drags his gaze down my body again.
I walk to the front of the store and find Cas waiting there for me, his stuff already bagged. The man at the counter rings up my food haul, a kind of dazed look on his face the entire time he's scanning, and sends us on our way.
Jo speaks up after listening to Cas, "Oh, yeah boys. I know of a couple places. Do you know what you're looking for?"
Cas moving inside me is a feeling that I can't wait to try again and again. The effortless thrusts hitting me in just the right place as I scramble to grab onto Cas' hair, arms, back, anything.
~•~•~•~•~
I scoff in disbelief. "Seriously? Look, man, I've been fucking kidnapped and apparently I'm not going to be let go because you're sister 'wants me' or some shit and I already told her that there's no way in hell that that is going to happen because I'll never want her! She can't seem to get that through her thick head! So, if you could get me the fuck out of here, that would be real nice!"
"Well, uh." Dean leaned in to Castiel and grabbed hold of his hand. "I hope this is alright." Dean brushed a brief kiss to Castiel's cheek, eyes fluttering closed. He withdrew, smiling bashfully.
It's a woman, his boss I'm guessing, and she has a stern look on her face. She has long, blonde hair, and is dressed plainly in blue jeans and a white blouse.
"No, I'll do it when we cross state lines, in Virginia probably. Then we can go to a court and have our wedding officiated."
"I don't know how else to tell you this, Rachel, but I'm gay. I have no physical attraction to women. Dress however you want, wear nothing for whatever I care, but you will never get the response you want out of me," I insist.
She stares at me for a moment, eyes blank, before she gets off the bed and walks away, towards the door.
Take the creepy alleyway to work, I thought. It will be a shortcut, I thought. Nobody would attack you if you took the creepy alleyway, I thought.
After downing most of it, Cas looks at me expectantly.
"Guess I'll just lay here then."
"Antidote to the poison you were injected with, just to keep you out for a little bit while we got you situated here."
On what I assume is the next morning, I am woken up by Castiel entering my room. I sit up in bed, blinking away sleep, and release my legs from under the blanket. Castiel puts a plate with some toast and eggs on my lap, the warmth from the plate heating my stuff legs up.
The man grinned. "Thanks, man. I was getting lost. It's pretty dense in that part of the forest." He glanced over his shoulder at the area he had just emerged from.
I let go of his arm. "No!"
"Were you the one who took me?"
Cas guides me to the door and through the house, towards a bathroom with one of the most rudimentary showers I've ever seen. Cas helps me undress, then shoves me under the water, handing me a bar of soap.
Dean's eyes widened briefly, then he said, "Yeah, yeah. That's a good idea. Is this enough fish?"
"Exactly what poison are you going to use?" Now that I know that this is happening now, my worky starts to increase. It's not like knowing the name of the poison will help me in any fucking way, but I tend to crave answers to everything when I'm paranoid.
"That sounds alright. Will we need to change our names?"
"How could I pay you? You took me out of my job so now I have no income, I don't have access to any of my accounts, and I'm guessing that you don't need my crappy apartment to live. What could you want from me?"
"Yup, slept like heaven."
We continue walking hand-in-hand until we reach the convenience store. Walking in, I head straight towards the freezers in the back of the store, shopping basket in hand, while Cas looks for essentials. I grab boxes of frozen dinosaur chicken nuggets, Texas toasts, pasta, and fried rice and sesame chicken. In the refrigerated section, I grab a quart of milk and some carrots and cucumber. Lastly, I get some bread, peanut butter, jelly, chips, and some other snacks.
"You're just awesome, Cas."
A pleased look appears on his face. “I seem to remember someone begging me to go even harder.”
"I'm not going to assault you. You have to want it as bad as I do, either for me, eventually, getting you out of here, or for your own pleasure." Castiel walks towards the door. "Think it over, Dean."
And now Cas...
Castiel walked back to the clearing slowly, careful not to drop any of the flowers. Dean smiled at Castiel when he sat down next to him, skirt pillowing around Castiel and the flowers scattering in his lap.
"Oh." I inwardly cringe. "Were you close with your mom?"
Then physically slap myself, just for good measure.
“I don’t think you’ll be able to get up to go to the bakery if we do “a couple more rounds” before then.”
Dean didn't reply after that. Castiel doubted he knew what to respond with, and he was disappointed in himself for ruining their conversation.
"Why would I regret this? You claim you left your family, your home, to get out of the life. Why would they know where you are? And I was the one tasked with sending in your immediate resignation letter for that café you worked at before this, so nobody will come looking for you there. The only people who know your current location are my boss and me."
I grin at him. "All better, and ready to satisfy my cravings." He stared at me and I realize what I just said, and what it sounds like. "For-for pie. I like pie."
"I like red, makes me happy for some reason. What about your favorite food? Mine is pie. Just any kind of pie. You can't make me choose. There was this place just down the street from where we lived when I was a kid that had the best pie ever. The most delicious thing I've ever had. I'll try and make it for us one day."
When he's in all the way, I find his lips and kiss him, whispering, "I love you, Cas," into them. Cas kisses me with abandon, breaking the touch with a hiss as I jerk my hips up, needing to feel him.
"You know how you were knocked out, then poisoned to get you here?"
"I found them in one of the cupboards! I'm not sure how old they are, but we both know that with the amount of chemicals put in here, they are practically immortal."
"It's always good to have something to look forward to in life." Cas muses.
I recover at Cas' words, shaking my head. "Don't you dare stop, Cas. I need you."
Dean dropped the fish in Castiel's basket after dancing in excitement with his yield for a moment's time. "What do I get in payment for my work?"
"Does this mean I don't call you Cas anymore?"
"Everything all right?"
"Hi," I awkwardly push out. "I hope you don't mind, but I changed my clothes." I mentally slap myself. Why the fuck am I apologizing to him?
How did I even get into this situation?
"Dean Winchester, speechless at my hands," Cas feigns shock.
"Pants off. You too. Now."
That was smart of him to switch the cars, in case the other one could be tracked.
