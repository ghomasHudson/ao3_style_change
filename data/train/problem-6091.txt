Barton was like a brother to her and watching him suffering with the knowledge, he had turned his bow on men he trained, that he killed innocent people. Men who had families, futures…Clint had cut all of that short in an instant and he had no choice in the matter. Watching over Coulsons recovery from his injuries and from Fury’s lie to the team about the agent’s death.
Both Natasha and Pepper agreed and asked Jarvis to switch off their link. Clint followed and Tony begged off a final lame apology and asked that he could keep his man hood intact.
Steve couldn't help but smile and feel so thankful for everything they had, how easily they could have lost it all.
Tony watched from the corner of his eye as Steve tucked into the pizza and cola. He already looked better than he had in the hospital, bruises appeared less prominent than they had under the unflattering florescent lights. The inventor loathed to have to bring up the journal anytime soon but they had no way of knowing what kind of timetable they were working with here. Steve could be a damn ticking time bomb of hormones. Who knew what could happen or its effect on the serum.
Fury showed up at the tower with several agents flanking his entrance. Jarvis was less than enthusiastic in announcing the directors arrival. At least this time Tony didn't send down one of the twins dirty diapers in the lift.
They all knew this wasn’t looking good. Reinforcements had arrived in a flood as soon as the coms went down. Hydra had new cloaking tech and that was a huge oversight that they did not need right now. His team was doing their best to hold things down outside but it was clear the swarm of LMD and human agents was just a distraction from what was happening inside the warehouse. They didn't want the SHIELD team anywhere near the main attraction. Whether that was to tip the scales in their favor or not remained to be seen. Some how Phil didn't think so, Ada or 'Madam Hydra', was far too logical to think a few agents would make that much of a difference in aiding two Avengers. This felt less like a tactical decision and more like a scientific one.
“Young Master and Young Mistress are currently finishing their first examinations and will be returned in 5 minuets and 34 seconds. May I also say Sirs, congratulation, they are truly little wonders.”
It was an unspoken thing in the tower, Jarvis was watching closely and set to alert all occupants should the omega do anything harmful to himself or others.  The cautionary order began a few months after the loss when Loki had been force out of the tower to go along with Pepper and Natasha on a shopping trip. The ravenette stepped off of the sidewalk and in front of a bus. Had it not been for the Widow’s swift action in tugging the man back by the collar … well, they weren’t sure if it would have killed him but it wouldn’t have been good.
As they stood in the now ruined snow field looking at the fallen troops (who were being assessed by Coulson’s team that arrived at the end of the battle) the team regroups with congratulations on their tongues.
He wasn’t sure if it was right for him to feel like this. Then he looked down at the slumbering engineer, Tony did deserve this. Maybe that made it ok.
Steve hesitated. Tony honestly didn’t have time for the omega’s modesty when something potentially life threatening could be happening. “J hit me with Steve’s stats buddy.”
The engineer scoffed and flopped back on the covers, “You wound me Tasha dear, here I thought you loved me for my network backdoor game. The way I sweetly caress all those sexy lines of code with my magic fingers.”
Steve finally gathered himself enough to dry off and return to bed calling “come in, loud enough for who ever may have been waiting outside.
Tony followed the not-Steve letting lose a barrage of small rockets. Unfortunately, the imposter was hunkering down and not making it easy. Stark landed on a peak intent on blasting the doppelganger out of his little hidey hole. When the shield came flying out of the rocky crevasse and slammed into the suites right booster before ricocheting back.
Loki did not have a comment to the later. In his mind it was highly unlikely that Odin put much thought on his younger son. If the old man had he was more than capable of contacting him in the years since Loki had left Asgard. Yet no word had come. “I am glad. I have meant to write her, however, I find ...I am less capable with my verbiage of late.”
The last tell was the small foreman’s office on the observation loft. The doorknob was cleaner that it should have been, rubbed from turning with a gloved hand.
It was mission like any other, and maybe that is why it felt so shocking at first. On the other hand, maybe it was shocking because Tony Stark had a habit of always scraping by when he pulled something horribly reckless. The genius billionaire and his nine lives...finally ran out.
“He won’t die so easily moron…” The man assured before retching the blade free. “We’re just getting started, you will talk Captain. that I can promise you.”
They all talked for a bit before Pepper started to nod off;  she had been having trouble sleeping due to the very active pup. Bruce And Natasha excused themselves, Banner heading into the kitchen to put on a kettle.
“For all intensive purpose we think the most substantial component is psychological. Although environmental differences could play some role, with Loki's upbringing on Asgard, I doubt it. The climate there is not that much different from here on earth. If anything the fact that New York has such cold winters should be a boon given your biology.”Bruce said leaning forwards and adjusting his glasses.
Steve was surprised when nothing happened, after a few heartbeats between them Tony took Steve’s hand and closed his eyes. The billionaire muttered, “go to sleep” and scooted closer.  The omega adjusted and welcomed the other man’s presence they just slept and it was perfect. He could honestly say it was the best night of sleep he had in…well ever really.
Seeing the one person in this world you love with every bit of yourself brought so low. Loki was huddled in the corner eyes glazed and covered in sweat and worse. It was as if he'd just...given up. Like something finally broke and he couldn't bear to put the pieces back together.
“You what? No verbal knives left to throw at me before I go out there and risk my life? No more quipping little jabs to show how smart you are? Yeah, poor dumb James, poor dumb lab rat alpha who can't possibly grasp anything!” James snarled the bitter stink of aggression making his omega flinch and god that just made it worse.
Beck had been arrested a week later fleeing from a burglary a few blocks over. While they could not pin him for the shooting it self he claimed he might ‘know a guy who was bragging about it.’ That turned out to be false and Beck had since skipped town.
“Nat! You're home, why didn't you call? I would have come to meet you.” Pepper frowned and rubbed her belly. “I Missed you” She said before glancing over at Bruce, “We missed you.”
“Yes well I've not gone to the shops in some time. You know I loath going out among the crowds.”  That's right, sound like its just beneath you, not that you can't look at a mother with a child and burst into tears. That has nothing to do with it. Or perhaps the way you can't breathe when you happen past the isle with newborn blankets and soft toys.
What little of his memory remains of their youth, he knows the younger man was never good at keeping the homes fire burning. Steve always wanted to be out in the thick of things. Always had and always will, even more so with all he has to protect these days. It wasn't as if James could blame him. If was standing in his friends shoes right now he doubted there would be anything that could hold him back. Maybe that's what made omegas so much stronger when you really thought about it. They were the ones that had to keep that brave face and hold down the fort while their fool alphas ran off into the wilderness and wars. Something had to be said for those left behind when the wolf was at the door. At the end of the day – when the front line fell – it was your last line of defense that needed to be the strongest.
Loki smiled and kissed the boys crown, “Never you, I would take you with me and you could be there with me. We could have our own kingdom and Fenrir would guard it for us.”
The pair of them slipped into an empty lounge, Loki waved a hand at the door to ward anyone from entering. He had a feeling that this particular meeting might bring out emotions he would not care to display for just anyone.
Tony fell back into his chair; vaguely remember reading Bruce's file when Fury had first approached him about the Avengers initiative. Then thinking about why Hydra had done to Barnes. Steve could not know about this, every time someone tried to replicate the effects of the serum it always ended badly for everyone involved and his omega seemed to take it the worst.
“Her name is Ophelia Sarkissian, she was a lieutenant under Red Skull, the first woman to ever climb the Hydra Ranks.” Barnes said, his eyes grew colder with each passing second spent glaring up at the screen. “ I watched her die in 1974. The Asset...I was brought out for a mission, Ophelia had...overstepped with Strucker. He wanted to take the lead, create a legacy for those swearing allegiance to the cause – a way to groom the next generation of hydra. She stood in the way, she wanted to keep things militant – hard training and experimentation, she thought his approach was mollycoddling . Strucker had Pierce on his side though, he had the entire old boys club that never cared to much for hydra's little Viper.”
The soldier looked over at were his pups were coloring at the coffee table and smiled. These were the days he would always cherish, memories of sunlight pouring in through the massive floor to ceiling windows, the golden beans lighting the twin’s baby-soft hair like halos around their head. Little tongues poke out in concentration as they careful selected colors from a large bucket between them. Peter and Wendy wanted to have pictures for their daddy as welcome home presents. Such warmth in that moment of innocence, he wanted for them to hold on to this as long as possible before the world outside tainted the happy image they had of life.
Tony wasn't even sure why he cared so much. Maybe it was the way Thor looked when he sat down and told the team what really happened to Loki. What Odin's prodigal son finally confided in the darkness of his cell after the death of the only mother Loki had ever known?
Between other worldly research and trying to help Dr. Cho and Helen with Tony, Bruce just wanted some better answers. It felt like they were crawling in the dark. At least with Extremis there was substantial research to fall back on, experiments to run, samples to take. With Loki...they were feeling around in the dark.
Jane bit her lip. “Better than a week or so ago but... no I'm sorry. Would you like to visit him today or do you want to relax for a while and go tomorrow?”
“Tell me what you want sweetheart.” Barnes fondled his lover through the lace with his metal hand watching the goose flesh prickle over Steve’s skin. “Tell me or you won’t get it.”
All of those videos they had watched about “preparing for the birth of your child” and  “the joys of birth”, each one hosted by smiling omega surrounded by laughing healthy babies and too happy couples  who talked about what a ‘fantastic experience’ they had. All those…were a big fancy bowl of shit.  Steve was 100% sure nothing about being in labor for going on eleven hours, having to whistle and stare at the ceiling very time Doctor Simmons ducked below the sheet to “check the progress”.  So yeah…maybe he didn’t pay that close of attention to those videos after all.
She rounded into the bedroom and felt her heart drop, Steve leaning heavily on a chair -looking flushed and worried as the news played  in the background. News crews reporting, “Iron man is down and has not surfaced for nearly two minuets.”
“Did you think I would be so callus not to see you off to battle? I have even extended such a kindness to that oaf of a brother mine. It would stand to reason I could trouble myself a few moments to see my oaf of an alpha off, would it not?” Loki spoke, folding his arms over his chest. Trying as he might to look put off and bored, but his alpha knew what that look really said.  It was all the little pout in the noble’s lips and the slight rise of his shoulders.
When the EMT’s arrived at the tower Tony had Steve had already left with Thor, having had to convince the man that riding in the car ahead was better than using the hammer, they all agreed that the pack would be there to welcome their newest little member.
Once they were inside Stark paced and ran his fingers through his hair. The place was dirty and there were newspapers and broken glass everywhere. The furniture was a mix of lawn chairs and sofas that would have looked more at home sitting out on the curb than under a roof. Not that the roof it self was holding up spectacularly if all the rainwater filled pots and coffee cans that littered the room was any inclination.
They fit well on a lot of levels. Both not the most emotionally available of men - somehow found a way to let down those guards for each other. Tony was able to talk about things that he worried about, things that still made his heart race and send images of dark rock walls and vast deserts of scorching sand into his brain at night. Steve was able to voice how alone he felt at times in a world that wasn’t his. There was no judgment in the transgressions they both had committed. Steve wasn’t as ‘without reproach’ as the history books liked to claim.
That was when she met Alexander Pierce and his two sons Brock and Grant. Maybe it was Alexander’s way of speaking or his charm, maybe it was because he knew of loss. Alexander had been married twice before, to a young woman named Elaine Rumlow first. She had died early in their marriage from illness. Then Jaclyn Ward, she passed after a riding accident. Leaving Alexander with two young boys and no woman at home to care for them. Sarah felt bad for him, he seemed so charming and kind. It wasn't surprising that she fell for him.
“From what we've gathered from inbound Intel,” Fury began as images flashed in secession across the screens behind him. Aerial shots of an abandoned factory outside of a rural town. The images shift and change as they cycle through black and whites of a white van pulling up to an old rusted chain link fence. A following picture shows two men cutting the heavy chain binding the gate closed.
“Sorry…” Steve mumbled letting Tony lead him higher on the bed until he his back was against the alphas chest. The cool metal of the reactor resting between his shoulder blades.
Stark stood back watching the short exchange. Pepper set the cup down and Steve gave her a watery smile and word of thanks. She stood back and crossed her arms for a beat of silence.
Pepper nodded and hugged him again, "I will if you want me to, or Bruce said he could. We'll do this however you want."
They would never come back to this place, Tony wouldn’t need to. It may not have been the goodbye he wanted, but it was the one he needed.
Phil had noticed right away as observant as he was. He had seen Loki have an 'episode' at the tower on several occasions and when the man stopped( the children blissfully unaware) and trembled with glazed eyes – Phil recognized what was happening.
However, Captain America did belong at least in the name the serum had bestowed upon him, because he had a job to do. Therefore, Steve held onto that, just do the job- just be worth something.
Every time Loki denied company or begged off socializing for one reason or another. The times after they had been so sure for good news only to have the hope denied once again. It was then that Loki would always shy away from him, evenings claiming to have 'papers to grade' or 'reading to catch up on'.  All of these convenient excuses to just be alone. How many of those 'I will be late returning from the school' nights had been just that and not Loki some place alone with his thoughts? How often had the man spent hours with nothing but his own anger, fear, and loathing for company?
Okay, maybe he had been a little too ready to go out of town for that meeting after all. A tiny respite from Steve's fretful family preparations, was welcome. As bad as that sounded even now to his inner voice, he just couldn't take the hening. He loved Steve, he really did but it was day like that, that reminded him how often the two of them could butt-heads in the past.
Their omega was in his seventh month and still thought it was very appropriate to use extremely dangerous, extremely flammable tech. So it one of the soldiers had to keep an eye open at all times. Today just happened to be Barnes day to baby-sit.
Bruce cast a weary glance to his scientist friend; Tony shook his head and did his best to anchor the omega. “Steve, turn your head.”
With the rainbow bridge fading into the clouds and the quinjet once again taking flight, they all finally had a chance to sit down and breath.
“Cut the crap.” her ginger browns twitched into a V. “Do you have any idea what that little stunt could have cost you?”
The alpha poured himself a drink, “Well I’m hungry too, but…yeah. Look Steve, I know I’m not perfect and I’m probably going to screw this up but for right now I want to try because you deserve that much.”
Gideon was an old man with silver hair and dark eyes, the kind of eyes that looked right through you. They didn’t look through Steve though; instead, they looked him up and down with ill intent. Eyes that seemed to linger too long. “So, you’re one of Alexander’s boys? I will say you favor him in coloring more than the other two, I suspect your mother was a beauty as well.” The old man said with a snake-like smile.
The blond swallowed hard trying to calm his own heartbeat to match the steady thump against his palm. “I’m going to kick your ass…”
“It is currently 8:30 am Sir, most of the tower will be waking with in the next half hour.” Jarvis chimed in.
There was that air of something horrible hanging around them. Of course they would have Pepper do this, she was the safe bet. Happy was there in-case Tony lost it.
“These are so good! Steve have you taken them to MOMA yet? You really should I’m sure they would enjoy it.” Pepper said, placing the pictures on the coffee table at a safe distance from her tea.
Amora smiled and handed the cloth covered bundle over, “He is beautiful, I have chosen the name Anthony for him.” That was the name she heard the mortal screaming from just below the waves. It was as good a name as any; if Thor did not favor it, he could change it. It didn’t truly matter to her; she did not plan to raise this little pink nuisance. She thought perhaps when she carried a true offspring of Thor with in her belly she might even kill this one. Then play the morning mother as the eldest son of the house of Thor was laid to rest with in the deep trenches.
If James really thought about it, the closest thing he had to a father figure growing up had been Mr. Lee. He was an older man that lived on the ground floor of the tenement building. Thinking back he remembers the old man sitting on the stoop in evening reading the paper. He always had salt water taffy for the kids and a kind word for anyone who stopped for a chat. James didn't remember if he had any children or a wife, there were times his recollections were still hazy at best.
“The way I see it Mr. Stark want’s to go after the people responsible for his husbands death. Maybe you don’t realize this Colonel Rhodes, but we want the same thing. An end to tyranny.”
It was Starks turn to comment, the billionaire had been silent flipping through the screens reading over numbers already forming formulas in his head. “So what were looking at is a unpredictable time table with equally unpredictable results.”
“Doll, I know you might not understand it but I have to do this ok. I am about to go out and I just wanted to talk to you-” His words were cut as Loki snapped a reply.
As soon as Stark opened the door, he spotted Natasha leaning against the adjacent wall, her peridotite eyes falling on him in an unreadable expression. “Always one to make an entrance huh Stark.” She commented, gaze tracking the billionaire as he slipped in letting the exit door snap shut behind him.
Jane clears her throat and smiles warmly when the other omegas turn to look keenly at her. She holds up the bakery box happily. “Hey guys brought you some treat but looks like you have me beat by the smell of things.”
“Cheese pizza, no meat this time…I don’t think I can stand the smell of beef or pork at the moment.”  That was unfortunate because man cannot live on greens alone. Leave it to the Jarvis to look out for the omega.
“He does have a dainty figure after all.” The elder boy said. “Can hardly call little our Cinder a man at all.”
The first few waves were much the same. Tony pleasured him with his tongue and fingers, the alpha even offered to bottom if Steve wanted him to. Something that would have been unheard of back in Steve’s day. As tempting as the offer was the omega needed something more to take the edge off. His body was craving something specific that it just wasn’t getting.
“I am...deficient.” He pulls his hands from hers wrapping his arms tight around himself. “James will never know the joy you are soon to know Agent Romanov.”
So many people that he's loved he's had to bury. So many lies he's had to tell. And at the the end of the day he's still the same.
“No, I believe we will be taking the children to lunch at noon and know if I do not eat then Kurt will give me that look of his.”
Tony chuckled and kisses his jaw, “Yeah you were. Seriously though sugar buns, we'll wait and see and if not then there's next time. No pressure you know that right? These things can take time, even with superior genetics in play.”
“Loki...” Thor paused looking at the slender man before him. Even in the prison holds on Asgard- Loki had never seemed this frail. Even in madness Loki always held a look of defiance burning in his eyes. Yet now.. now it seemed that fire had burned away and left nothing but ash. “Please tell me, truthfully brother, how are you?”
Barnes reached out and took his hand across the table. “Loki, you know I love you and...and if you wanna look into adopting a kid then we can do that, but don't feel like you failed me baby.”In truth James doesn't want to give up trying for a child. However, seeing how much pain lay in those forest green eyes he knew deep down how much this has hurt Loki. The soldier willing to do whatever he can do to protect his love. If that means that they take this road then so be it. “We can look into okay?”
With a heavy sign, Barnes lifted his eyes to the horizon. If he made it back from this he'd do things right, he'd take the time and make sure everything was ok at home. Hell, he might even try that whole ' talking about your feelings ' thing the kids were so wild about these days.  See there, you can teach old dog new tricks.
“That will teach you to give targets inappropriate names,” the omega said with an odd cheerful face.
Frigga would have corrected her son, he was not like the golden haired sea witch, and he did not desire power or pain.
“Then help me. I need to end this Phil, it has to be me.” Steve was practically begging. Something Phil never thought he would see. Then again, he thought he’d never see Stark and Rogers get along let alone wake up to find the pair married. He could see it in the Captains eyes, a man desperate to right a wrong, and a man full of regret. It didn’t suit Steve.
By the time the group descends  on Shield Headquarters Barnes is already there stalking up and down in front of the satellite surveillance screens. “What the hell happened to intercepting them!” He scowls throwing his arms wide in irritation. He hasn't mentioned his conversation with Stark to anyone. In the back of his mind something tells him he should, knowing now that if whatever was taken from AIM was enough to make Stark nervous – they had a big problem. Even so, he’d given the pack Alpha his word and where James came from a man’s word meant something.
Silence...utter painful silence.. Stark sorted and pined his grin tight to hold back what must have been a loud guffaw judging by the red hue of the mans cheeks.
Trying to relax in their temporary apartment left him feeling anxious. Loki could feel his skin prickle and itch with nervous unrest. This wasn't his safe space and feeling his body trying to claw its way back to health here seemed unnatural. He knew this was all in his head, some primal need for the familiar. Definitely, he was safe, this was no worse than being on Asgard as a child. In the days before he felt the bitter sting of profound betrayal. Perhaps even as a boy he'd known he wasn't quite right.
“Relax soldier boy, I’m just kidding, trust me if I was coming onto you it would be much smoother than that. You know this. Remember that gala you came to last Christmas for the Maria Stark foundation. The one where I snagged the Swedish twins? See that wasn’t even a level six of my full flirtatious spectrum.”
“You and your pearls of wisdom Charles. One will genuinely think you are reincarnation of the Buddha.” Loki commented wryly taking up the glass again and offering it to his guest.
Tony was mumbling along to the music moving a holograph of the suit around with his hands, he had been looking at some new specs to lighten the armor. “What would I do without your smart mouth….what’s going on in that beautiful mind…All of me loves all of you ….all your perfect imperfections...”
Still, he noticed the way Steve had a hard time looking him in the eyes. When he did, he looked…sorry, conflicted. Since the journal, he looked that way even more so. Had there been something back then? Something between Steve and Howard?
Thor sat back watching the faces of his teammates, “Lady Eir has made much progress with my brother and Asgard has means of treatment not available to this realm.”
“Maybe you oughta drop and gimme 20.” Steve pressed his hips forward; it felt so awkward walking in uniform when he was so hard. Thank god, no one had entered that hallway that would have been terribly embarrassing.
The two of them still had separate floors, and had only spent a handful of night’s together doing nothing more than taking solace in each others presence. During the day, Tony would still sequester himself in the workshop; however, now Steve had a pass code to enter the engineers’ inner sanctum. Most times the soldier would take residence on the corner sofa or old broken down armchair. Spending the hours Tony worked, sketching the bots or something from memory. It became grounding and comfortable for the two of them just to be with in close proximity to the other. They didn’t really go out on dates, unless Pizza in bed was a date. Tony might have said that it was.
The evening of the last round the pair had stumble out of the next room to shower. Steve’s muscles felt like jelly with the exquisite fatigue that he so rarely felt. If was good in a strange sort of way to have to rely on someone else. Tony of course beamed under attention.
After that, it was all blaring sensors and flying ass over elbows until BLAMO! Right into the drink.
Peter had been sick for the past week, the pediatrician said he was just the flu - that didn’t make Steve feel any better. The omega was at his wits end fretting over the sobbing two year old.  Steve felt completely powerless, he had hoped Peter would inherit the serum but he didn’t.  Maybe if he had the little boy wouldn’t be hurting right now.
The photo changes to a young woman with her hair pulled back wearing a high collared blouse and pencil skirt.
“No buddy no, oh baby no.” He pulled the little one into his arms and thought for a moment Peter had gotten bigger. Kids grow so fast and he had missed it.  “Shhh. Its ok, I’m right here I promise. I’m so sorry buddy, Daddy was just working that all. I’ve been working really hard that’s all.”
A shiver ran down the alphas spine when he pulled down the gravel drive. Something was wrong, his skin was tingling and a sour taste rose up in the back of his throat. James didn't even turn off the car or close the door, when he ran up to the home.
Life has a funny way of lulling you into a false sense of security. Right when you think, things are looking up- something or someone has to come along and jerk the rug right out from under your feet.  One moment the world is a safe and sunny place and then the rain clouds come rolling in and every inch of clear blue turns black, the wind picks up and sirens wail. Safety is only ever an illusion, a promise given to foolishly soothe those who are even bigger fools to believe it. Maybe that was a pessimistic way to view things but after you had lived through all the muck and mire you started to realize that indeed, the glass was half empty. The trick was being ok with that, cherishing that last little bit for every drop. Case with one call it could all go tits up in a second.
Steve felt foolish for wanting to go in there and curl up under a blanket and just sleep. He was suppose to be stronger than some stupid instinctual urges. What kind of leader hides under the covers just because things get a little difficult.
“No problems, at least nothing physical. I think maybe we have something’s to workout. I… I shouldn’t have assumed the worst after I told you. I’m sure it all came as a shock because I know its been a shock to me.” Steve started, standing awkwardly looking at his hands folded in front of himself with a deep-set frown. “I need to know what you want to do.”
Jim barely missed the shot, alarms blaring inside the suit as he faltered to find balance.  Part of his brain couldn’t even comprehend that his friend just shot at him. Not just a warning either, if he didn’t take evasive action then…well it wouldn’t have been pretty. They all let this happen , he should have come months ago to check on Tony but he was busy … busy, it sounded like such a thin excuse right now considering the hell Tony had gone through. Not just his friend but also his godson.
Steve moved as silently as he could through the foyer and sat down bench, leaning his head on his alphas shoulder.
“I should be asking you that don't cha think?” the brunette replies, pouring the contents of the forgotten glass into the sink.
Sitting at the extended glass-top table, he flipped through the mission booklet. James knew what his time was worth. It was worth 7 days and 21 pages of small type and glossy photos of a man he'd never seen or heard of before today.
Meanwhile Tony was giggling in his lab, “Hey J have you told Steve that we are all robots yet? Can I come up and start beeping at him. Been working on my best lieutenant Data impression.”
Scorpio himself made a hasty exit when a familiar black helicopter arrived with a trench coat and eye patch wearing director who was not above shooting at his own brother. After all, Nick had been getting a massage and this was his ‘personal day’ and that little mother fucker ruined it. Woe betide the man who interrupts Nick Fury’s Spa day.
Still. Still they watched him expectantly, waiting for him to slip up and show them that maniac grin.
AN: Also the eye color phenomenon is actually a thing, many babies are born with blue eyes that transition over time. This is basically my nod to comic-verse Tony vs. MCU Tony.
Tony flopped on his back and dramatically threw his forearm over his eyes. It seemed a safer bet to shelter in the make believe darkness than to look around at what Steve was doing. “They will be there at noon ya know.” The alpha groaned, “Better yet, why not have Buckaroo bring them to Shield and I'll just take you to work and pick them up then?”
Banner is already calling out orders to the towers AI, “I can sedate him... mildly at least. It won't last long, maybe long enough to get him into a safe place. Natasha would be better at soothing him with her pheromones than any drug can.”
Melinda shrugged and departed from him so the man could tend to his paper work. He knew she was merely trying to look out for him and honestly he did appreciate it. It had taken both himself and Clint a while to look at the former alien wannabe over lord and get over any lingering fear of anger regarding Loki.
“Brother please, I know I have been less than willing to heed your speech in the past. That said, you must admit you have been deceptive before - which is why I ask you now to tell me the truth. Are you well?”
“There is a little boy there, he is 7-years-old,”.he says pulling out a photo “His name is Wade, he has a healing factor similar to Logan's but as you can see from some of the scars it is...not as controlled.”
The shield pulled out of sight, the not-Steve was straddling his chest, breathing hard with red wind bitten cheeks. Tears in those so real blue eyes. Why would they do this…why would they be so cruel…?
“Nope.” Pepper didn’t wait just pushing her way inside, “Now you listen to me Steven Grant Rogers. You act like being an omega is some kind of handicap and I for one am extremely offended by that.”
Steve had said that once.  They had been lying in bed one night, warm and satisfied after making love lazily for the last hour or so.  That was something he had only ever done with Steve. When they were together it wasn’t like some performance, while it could get intense it wasn’t always. Sometimes it was just slow and controlled, their bodies tangling together, pressing as close as possible. They would touch and taste every inch of skin and whisper sweet words of affection. Times when the soldier would let go and surrender completely. That wonderful feeling that Tony could still feel tingling in his hands. The touch of those taught strong muscles relaxing under his touch.
“Steve, no look at me. Whatever you think this is that’s not true. It was a joke just a dumb joke ok.”
“Please, call me Jemma. To be honest it has been amazing meeting you Cap…uh I mean Steve. With everything, Phil has said about you, not to mention your war history you are something of a legend. I’m pleased to see you’re just a very kind man, and very understanding if you’re Alpha is anything to go by.”  She chuckled handing Steve the print out.
Even when Tony tried to distance himself, there was always Pepper or Bruce hovering on the outskirts of his troubled little world. Steve and Rhodey there to kick his ass down a few notches.
“So Tasha, I was thinking building a deck out at Lara’s ya know, and maybe an elevated playhouse for the kids. With one of those rope ladders”
“That’s if we find anything.” Steve said, looking up from his sketchbook. “If these creatures have managed to escape capture for …who knows how long. What makes Stark think we can find them, not only one but a colony?” Honestly Steve didn't want to find them, he had enough killing in the war to last a hundred lifetimes.
Phil handed over the bottle with a little shake to prompt Loki to take it. “ I know I haven't voiced it before but... I don't blame you. If you recall I think I might have even known then that you didn't want to do what you were doing.”
Wendy had a little collection of hair clips that Auntie Pepper and Auntie Natasha got for her. There were even a few from Papa and Daddy in the box and a very special on her Uncle Thor brought to her from Asgard. “The yellow flowers.”
James smiled at the memory then shook his head and wondered why he thought today would be any different. The alpha wasn't very upset though, what were a few moments extra if it helped his mate feel a bit more confident?
This earned Stark a withering gaze and a declaration of - ‘it wasn’t that bad, I mean I know it looks bad…I wasn’t dying or anything.’ It was just like all those years ago when he was trying to convince the recruitment offices to take him. Trying to justify everything in his paperwork as just ‘mild’. Only to have that big awful 4F stamp slam down on his enlistment papers.
As if things couldn't be complicated enough, with the potential of cyborg super soldiers or some other such mad shit on the apparent horizon,(this is why you can't have nice things Tony) he has a pre-heat omega to deal with. Cause nothing says ’ welcome home’ like murderous rage infused creatures! Let’s just throw our personal lives in a big blender and take a sex holiday while the world goes to hell.
Even worse, was the public’s response, the cheering in the street, children wearing black iron man masks with glowing red eyes? Civilian’s who took to the streets dragging out and beating individuals accused of being ‘hydra sympathizers’. Steve wondered how many innocents had been harmed or even killed from wrongful accusations.
They left the small room where the Captain had previously been held and entered the narrow hallway. It felt too cramped with its steel walls and floor, their footsteps to loud. Almost as if, the passage way would come alive and crush them. If ominous was, the look Fury was going for then he made it.
Thor gave his brother a gentle shake. “How could she not? You captured Father's heart the moment he saw you, regardless of what you may naturally think of him. The Norns saw it fit to place you with us. Loki, I do not know what horrors you have seen or feel. But you are not unlovable. It matters not the color of your skin or the blood within you. It is your heart, your mind that is the measure of you. I am...”the Alpha choked up and blinked away the moister building his eyes.“ I am so proud of you. I look at you and I can see parts the brother I thought I lost forever.”
Tony grinned, “Then why are you so funny looking? Seriously you look like a matrix cosplayer who had a bad day at the optometrist.”
Loki had separated himself from them in every sense of the word, even when the offer was extended to aid the team along side SHIELD, he turned it away. That wasn't to say the ravenette had locked himself away in some spooky lair to cackle evilly over a cauldron. He worked with kids and not just any kids, Loki worked with Charles Xavier's kids. Steve trusted him enough to let Loki be alone with Peter and Wendy; the little pups adored their uncle. Loki had managed to clear up things with his brother and so far they hadn't heard so much as a parking ticket from the once villain.
Howard leaned forward watching the woman as she moved. He could appreciate beauty for what it was and it surprised him that a woman like her had been in such work. Then again, some of natures most deadly things were often the most beautiful. “I can tell you Miss Romanov, they are real. As real as you and me because I saw one. She saved my sons life only to drown him. She murdered my child like it was a a game for her. That is what beasts they are. No matter what you may have heard about me; I know they say I am mad, but it happened. I have spent 20 years of my life trying to find and destroy her.”
The other men laughed and joked before the stout rough looking one, still with his cigar burning between chapped lips, kicks his feet onto the table. "So then what did you wish for? I know your broke and still ugly as ever so unless it's something we can't see." he paused pointing down with a vulgar wink. "What did you ask for?"
“Of course muffin, I’ll be a good boy and  get all the extra credit. Oh and Steve.” Tony pause at the edge of the balcony with the visor of the helmet flipped up. “You complete me!” He said with a grin dropping off the edge and darting up into the sky.
He made a mistake by not digging deeper when it came to Shield, he sat back running the logistics of saving the world and never once questioned if the powers that be really wanted it saved. They say hind sight is 20/20, in the Triskelion wreckage he learned that lesson. The world council said they wanted better for the world but if their definition of the world was one united under hydra - he wanted no part of it. Fury didn’t just let in the wolf at the door – he fed it, he housed it and let it grow. This was a sin he needed to correct by any means necessary.
“Would you please tell me what you’re seeing?” Steve tried to speak calmly get the edge in his voice was unmistakable. Why were they talking over him, why would no one tell him the truth?
Rockwell smiled softly, “Yes well you might be right, but let me ask you this Mr. Stark. Having known the Captain would you say he is in fact though the shining example of Alpha superiority?”
“Dad…. something…something’s coming…” Tony’s eyes were wide and afraid, he didn’t know how he knew but he did, there was something out there and it was getting closer. Something terrible, evil and filled with hate. It was coming to tear them apart. He needed to warn them, needed to warn everyone but he couldn’t. The world grew dark as his eyes rolled back in his head.
Thor looked down at his hands, capable hands that could summon light from the heavens and crush any opponent. Yet..they never could save his brother. “Have you seen him?”
Rapid flashes of images appeared in the visors lower left, including that of Tony himself walking down the roof access stairwell until two images lit up on split-screens.
I understand that no one really likes author notes. But...I'm going through some stuff and to be honest it feels like drowning. It feels like being in the middle of the Damn ocean and no one's around.
Phil had been enjoying his first cup of coffee and going over a few reports when she'd walked in. “I know, Natasha will be performing a demonstration in the training room with Mac. I didn't think you'd want to unless of course you've changed your mind.”
“Sunrise.” Loki's voice is hallow but its a response nonetheless. Something that Steve can latch onto.
The other alpha shook his head and flinched slightly. “Trust me, I'm feeling like dried up shit. Hopefully the doc won't be to pissed having to patch up my sorry ass.”
“The only thing we picked up was this interest in AIM pharmaceutical. Whatever they have their eye on, Hydra is willing to fund Mallen in retrieving it.”
Tony looked up from the sofa to the little voice coming from the elevator. Peter had his backpack and stuffed rabbit in his arms. “Over here peanut.”
This time the ravenette scoffed and groaned, pushing away with a weak hand. “Don't be stupid. If I had wished to suppress my heat I could have. You take me for one of your fragile mortals.”
The shower cubicle in the infirmary was tight but it was enough, thankfully, the whole room was tile so Steve just left the curtain open so he didn’t feel so penned in. The hot water made a world of difference; he stood there under the spray with his eyes closes just letting the water wash over his sweat and dirt stiff skin. If only the water could seep in deeper and clean, the darkness settled around his mind. Cleanse away all the doubt and anger that came with those damnable thoughts…
Recovery is something that does not happen over night, it is not easy and it is not fun. There were days Tony yelled in frustration and others he cried, days that Steve cried too because he just did not know what to do. In those times Bucky would be there to hold them both, whatever this was it did not need a name or traditional parameters. It was not even a shock when James Barnes told them both he loved them. It was just a natural progression. A relationship like any other.
After this Tony Would lead the way up the stairs, still not touching or speaking. He could already tell this was going to be a deep drop. It would be better to get Steve someplace manageable first.
Beck had been the one to assemble the injector, taking uncharacteristic care with each piece. “Are you sure about this?” he asked one last time.
I also made some fan art to be posted within the Story. This is made with avatars so yeah.. if you don't like it don't be rude. I put a lot of effort into my digital cosplay characters.
He watched them from a distance, descending the steps all smiles and adoration. Barnes felt his mind shifting the image of the strong man in a black tuxedo to a thin kid in a secondhand sport coat and crooked tie.  The faded memory of big glistening blue eyes and kiss bitten lips.
Jackets falling and ties pooling atop the bundles of fabric, those brown eyes looking down at him with so much emotion. This was just for him, no one else got to see this side of Tony Stark - so completely open and vulnerable. Lips damp and redden. "I love you. God I love you Tony." He spoke in a whisper surging up to attack the other mans mouth.
“Loki, hey how's it going? How about taking a breath for me?” Keeping his tone level he sat the taller omega down.
The skies grew black and now the water was glowing a violent lime green that seemed to grow from somewhere deep beneath the surface and envelop everything. The temperature was dropping rapidly and the harsh winds picked up. Whatever this was it was beyond human understanding.
Widow could see his mind working trying to pull together all the details. “We had Friday pull CCTV camera footage. They pulled up in a van and tossed a couple of flash grenades. Looks like three people plus the driver, likely inhumans considering it only took two of the bigger guys to overpower Steve. Paired with the fact we only see our third boy for a second before he clocks you in the head with a crowbar. We‘re thinking super speed or maybe even teleportation at short range.”
“We’re getting pruny… well you are. I don’t think I can get pruny.” Steve finally said, examining his fingers and not finding the tell tale waterlog wrinkles.
It wasn't until Stark's twins came running to greet their bearer that Loki noticed the Lady Potts on the sofa, skin glowing with the pleasantry of motherhood.  It crushed him, the joy on her face and that cloying milky scent of new life just shattered him.
Bruce eyed the ship cautiously before following, he did not want Tony to go alone and get hurt. Tony might have been older but he was small for his age. Bruce was nine and Tony had just turned 11 yet they were still the same size. “Tony…Tony where are you…” Bruce called out in the darkened hull of the ship.
The brunettes eyebrows crept up, “Ah well hate to burst your bubble but he’s dead and I don’t deal much with his old business. Stark industries have really taken a new direction lately so if this something about old patent I can direct you inside to a lovely lady at reception who can take your name and information and someone can give you a call.” Tony was about to wish the man a good morning and take off before the geriatric could verbally assault him… old people can be crabby.
Maybe it was all the practice Bruce had at keeping calm that made him the best mad for the job, or maybe one could call it fate. Still, he had a kind of charm over the mischief maker that no one else did. No one in all of the nine realms had been able to contain Loki the way the gentle Doctors words and subtle touch could.
“Loki you almost ready in there doll?” James called, his voice penetrating the thick oak of the bathroom door.
Phil was the one who brought out the suitcase and helmet. “Go, I’ll have Clint handle your paper work.”
Steve found himself waking up again, feeling heavy and warm. It wasn’t like before; he didn’t feel sick or worried - if anything, he felt content. Looking around the soldier realized where he was and felt heat rising in his cheeks. The nesting room was comfortable, not to hot or to cold. With plush memory foam under him and various blankets and pillows with-in arms reach. A plush slate grey blanket caught his eye.
“I’m aware of the year; I even know who the president is and my address. So I think I’m competent enough to make the choice of where my children are born Stark.”
In a strange way Tony was proud, this was what Steve deserved. At the same time, he hated it because it just reinforced the painful truth.
“I don't have eyes on Mallen or the Madam yet. Looks like they might be hold up on a lower level. Schematics said this place had underground freezers right?” Barnes said pulling himself up onto a catwalk.
The engineer nodded and tried to ignore the glare Steve was sending him. “No worries, I’ll have the big guy right as rain.”
The mage felt his vision blur and he tried in vein to squeeze his eyes shut against the wheeling emotion.
Tony could not contain his jokes left and right at the expense of the leader, Scorpio. Shooting through the sky far closer to the villain than he should have been despite Steve’s warnings. Of course, that wasn’t unusual for Tony. He just had to put in his two cents.
The omega thought for a moment, it really was the best option they had and while it would hurt sending Bucky away again. In the end, his friend may have some chance at a life. “Yes. We will extradite Bucky to Asgard’s under grounds of criminal insanity. If he can’t be treated then… We cross that bridge when we get there.”
They had that camaraderie, they got in each other's faces half the time but it was always with reason, they were both stubborn, controlling and perfect for each other. Somewhere in all that posturing and snide remarks they found a friendship and then it tumbled into something more all by accident.
Perhaps it was then I grew cold. Then when I turned my back on humanity, long before the lies of my parentage unfolded around me. Long before I actively looked for revenge. It was there under the soil in an empty grave where i left my heart.
Their first date was nice, very traditional in idea even if the night had its own “Tony Stark Spin”. Which meant 5-Star dinning and a private table.  Steve was very impressed by the car and the restaurant. Not that he expected anything less from the exuberant alpha. Still, Steve felt out of place in the fancy clothes and high-class eatery. Never in his life would he have imagined to ever even be let into the door at a place like this.
The next morning would be a big one, so he wouldn't bother trying to wake Steve for a bottle in a few hours.
Truthfully he's afraid to ask, afraid to hope that the one thing Maria had wanted so badly could still be here with out her. His last little piece of her. Howard wasn't a praying man by far but he would hail every saint in divinity if he could have this one thing.
“Isn't he though?” Bruce quietly said standing and walking away from the table. “Loki's body may perceive his environment as 'Threatening' because his mind see's it that way. If you were in a place where you felt like a monster, like everyone hated you.”Bruce took a breath and rubbed down his face.“ Trust me it isn't easy.”
“As for as Nicks concerned I’m sure it did, with you back in the picture he had to secure his interests. You woke up early and compromised his end game.” she replied taking another sip of her drink.
It all sounded so flawless, it always sounds flawless, but then – what is it they say? If you want to see God laugh, tell him your plans?
Even if he did not remember it clearly, James had always been out on the street with the first signs of life. There was always work to do or go out and find, always some sort of trouble to get into- or get Steve out of more often than not. From the time he could tie up his own shoes James always had somewhere to be.
“I know you don’t want to believe it Tony but its me! Fury lied!” Steve came out of the small cave holding the shield at the ready. He thought he timed it right, if this suit was like any of the older Ironman models that would be enough to take out at least one half of lower propulsion. Tony could still get of the ground but it would be unstable.  If Stark were looking for serious fight, he wouldn’t risk it.
“What do you want us to do Cap?" Sam's voice echoed across the line backed by the shrieks of the beast.
“It‘s been shit around here. All the disconnect going around, we call all feel it. None of us have been the same since that day.”
“He's fine elf; the kid loves it.”Logan called back tossing the gleefully screaming child up in the air.
"This isn't a game to me. You can't tell me you haven't seen me. I know you have I know you watch me ...I-I like it."
A few days later, Howard had sent back a list of all the flaws he saw in the grainy black and white newsprint. Tony had wanted to tear up the letter and throw it in the trash but then he noticed at the bottom of the list. In his fathers not so need scrawl
Bringing a ragged looking Barnes into the common room after Loki was safely sleeping, the pack gathered around the man. Pepper and Natasha flanking him on both sides. No one spoke for a while and maybe that was for the best. James just sat there with his head in hands as the women rubbed his back and Bruce made a cup of tea. Steve and Tony sat opposite and waited until Banner pushed a warm mug into the brunette solders hands.
I could scarcely believe my eyes, that the norns would form such a face from the dust of the grave and breath life with in it again. I thought my heart mad, surely this couldn't be.
He found himself tugged into the elevator and crowed by the smaller man, “Quiet, look at me. You won’t. That’s not who you are.”
Tony extended an arm around his omega, pulling the blond close to indulge in some scenting. “How about a movie? We could see whats next on your list?” He suggested.
“Steve…” Tony said pulling on his jeans and a shirt “would you …I mean I know you have your own floor but…would you want to stay here more?”
Finally Shield's fearless leader shows his hand and Barnes feels like he’s been here before, a younger fire-bellied version of himself once stood in line and felt like the orders passed down were a crock-of-shit and he was going to have to sit down and have a big old bowl of it with a forced smile on his face.
As Steve set the sandwiches out and Tony brought over the veggies and juice for the kids he observed Peter carefully holding a doll. “Whatcha got there Petey.”
The young sailor armed only with a shield stared down at him. Steven had only ever wanted to protect people. Ever since he was a little boy and watched how his father terrorised his mother. All he wanted was to be the man that saved the important people in his life. Yet he had never taken that role, even among his crew he would defer to the Captain or look to his friends. Steven was much like his weapon..a Shield, not a sword. “Sir…I, I don’t know if I…”
James scoots over on the narrow bed and hauls Loki up next to him. “Lay down baby, that's it just lay down I won't leave ya.”
“You have, we should have seen that a lot sooner. Nevertheless, I don't believe everything is fine, James doesn't think everything is fine but he doesn't want to push you. If can't tell him, maybe you can tell me.”
There wasn't much that Loki had wanted and didn't get. After all, growing up a prince he was a tad bit on the spoiled side. However, something things can not just be given so freely when sought after.
Phil smiled looking over his shoulder, “I never thought he’d betray you. I think it’s the sort of thing Nick can get over. He knows how these things work.” Spoken as nonchalant as one might borrow a cup of sugar.
"We'll be home soon." he spoke softly but didn't dare get to close. Stark knew that would break what was left of the Captain's resolve.
Suddenly a familiar face came into view, Natasha. She was saying something but her words were muffled by that dammed ringing that just wouldn’t go away.
“Yes, there is a chance that the serum could react against the developing fetus. Recognizing it as a foreign object rather than healthy tissue and thus…rejecting it.”
Even so, Loki found himself trying to 'put on his old mask' by freshening up before stepping into the parlor where James had left the older man. How Loki desperately wished he hadn't asked James to allow them some privacy. The request had been anther old habit rearing its head.
He's up and dressing, slipping on a started shirt and black tie like battle armor. All the while maintaining a cool lit- not even an ounce of sleep in his voice to suggest he did such a thing at all. Asking questions and demanding a visual was second nature.
Dressing and slipping out of the tower at the early hour to enjoy the still waking city around them.
“Jarvis gimme visual and audio, I want you to record riendeergames. Vitals, energy fluctuations, all sensors go! If Merlin sweats I wanna know the ph!”
Tony looked over to the incoming screen; old patchy had been off his greeting card list for a while now. What with the downfall of Shield, and since rebuilding of it under Director Hill. Of course, that little matter of the former Shaft cosplayer/master spy being dead as far as the US government was concerned. They all knew better of course. It would take grenade up the ass to put Nick Fury down. “Answer it J”
had been iron clad and carried out under penalty of severe punishment. Said punishments usually occurring after rule one had been observed a time or ten.
Thor hauled his thin brother into lap, not caring if anyone should enter and discover them in such a childish position. He could feel Loki trembling with tears and everything in him was screaming to guard his family member. “Even if I can not I will be here for you in any way I may. Please, brother, tell me what I can do to ease your pain.”
“Why do you have to throw that in my face? You tell me to be smarter than my peers, tell me to care more about learning than about going out and being some warrior or hunter. Then when I do it it’s, ‘Anthony why can’t you act properly’ ‘Anthony don’t be so loud’ ‘Anthony how can you be so reckless', is my middle name 'Stop-that-this -instant'? I’m starting to think it is.”
She and Phil had been standing in the hall outside the entrance to Steve’s floor. He had gone promptly to the guest room in the penthouse gathered up his things and gone down to the sparely furnished flat just below. Ignoring anyone’s attempts to stop him.
Maybe one day..... Even if there isn't a cure. He will find a way to live together with his monster.
Mjolnir crackled with life as its owner swung the mighty hammer and while the beast seemed dazed by the effects of the Mer’s magic and force, it did not seem deterred.
Steve picked the child up and held him tight. It made sense why Tony was so awkward when it came to gentle physical contact. Everything had to be a grand gesture with the man and now Steve realized that it wasn't Bravado or some need to exude as much masculinity as possible. It was because Tony learned so early on that affection wasn't ok. Steve truly wished he could change that even if for a few moments.
They should be asleep or having some nice early morning lazy sex with the heat turned up and the covers in the floor. That glorious newly mated type shit they never really had the opportunity to do.
“That's the time you must keep on trying. Smile, what's the use of crying? You'll find that life is still worthwhile… If you just smile”
Tony looked up as the door cracked open the sound of the toilet flushing had been obnoxiously loud and Steve must have spent five minutes washing his hands. Tony figured he was stalling but chose not to say anything about it.
“No! Oh .no. no…” She waved her hands, “I suppose I could have phrased that better, that is to say Captain - during your last heat were you sexual active?”
The laugh would be cut short by Coulson lighting fast blow to the back of the young man’s head. The other solider could barely react as the agent pulled the pistol from the fallen officer’s belt before the boy even hit the floor. The butt of the revolver glanced off the second solder’s temple sending the young man clattering back against the wall.
That's the thing about missions though, sometimes they go the way you think they will, there isn't that off day and you can't just pack up and go home like he wanted to.
Tony had a better sweet smile as he looked down at the still sleeping baby swaddled in the carrier. He let his fingertips brush over Steve’s knuckles before touching Peter’s cheek. “He’s not gonna feel like this ever, I promise Steve. Pete’s never gonna have to wonder if he’s loved. He’s gonna know, he’s always gonna know.”
This had to be the first time Tony was showing up voluntarily to anything, then again…nothing had ever mattered this much. A part of his brain wanted to chalk it up to instinct, sensing a member of his pack, an omega at that, was injured. More than that thought, something in his brain said he would be doing this even if he didn’t know Steve’s secret. Because they had gotten close, they were friends now and friends are there for each other. Maybe because they had gotten closer than Tony liked to admit, maybe because even before reading his fathers journal - Tony had thought about Steve, looked at him a little too long. When they were around each other Tony found any reason, he could just to touch him.
Tony looked back at Steve who gave a nod. “Got it, on screen for every no matter where they are be sure they can see it J.”
Bruce reflected on how advanced Thor claimed his people to be and yet it seemed even the most advanced civilizations were still victims to prejudice. When Jemma inquired on if there wasn't one of Loki's kind that might be able to shed some light on the complex subject – Thor hesitated and mentioned an old jotun priestess who originally helped Loki.

The moon rose high over the waves, turning the black sea into silver with its opalescent glow. It would not be long now if the sailor’s maps were correct, and Howard hoped they were. He hadn’t had much time and was only able to find a small coal ship tied up on the docks, it wasn’t much but it had a cabin and the man who owned it was all too willing to take Howard’s money to rent the diminutive vessel for the night.
Tony wasn't going to sit, not here...he'd probably burn these clothes when he got home. "I wanna know why, that's all. I get that you what happened to you was shit, and what you did isn't going to win you any popularity contests. But this?" The inventor gestures around to the hovel Loki was in. "I have seen Prison cells nicer than this. If you want to make a difference, we can help you. If you want to make up for the trouble you caused this isn't the way to do it. Trust me. I know what it's like to want to make up for your past."
Even considering it now Loki wondered if he was even one-tenth the person she was. She would never have fallen as far as he had would she? The bitter words of his mind condemning his own weakness were hard to shake. He could almost imagine that if he were to have a child he would crumble at the first sine of their pain. Would they be cursed to suffer as he had or would their parentage of human and Frost giant cause even more maladies? Loki tried his best not to focus on his fears, that was what steered him down this road in the first place.
The engineer shook his head, “yeah, I am. Maybe I just don’t wanna do it here with you in an assless paper dress. Call me old fashion but I think Captain American could deserve a little better setting to talk about his damn life.”
Alas, for the alpha things stopped just short of skin-to-skin, it was hard to be so respectful of Steve’s wishes but Tony was managing. He was in this for the long hall and if he had to court until his next heat then he was going to do it. Even if that was months away.
She shook her head and wiped at the tears he hadn't felt till her slim fingers brushed them from his cheeks. "He's gone honey, I sorry I wish I could tell you something else, anything else. But I can't, you know we're here, all of us. You're gunna get through this."
“Everything looks perfect.” Doctor Simmons said as she switched on the Doppler monitor’s sound and allowed the rapid whooshing sound of the twins heartbeats fill the exam room.
Loki felt something lift in his chest as he kicked in the warehouse doors. His soul objective since coming here had been to make it to his alpha by any means necessary. Not taking into account how the fear and aggression could have affected him. Standing there his chest heaving and skin slicked with sweat and spattered with blood. Eyes half crimson and pallor littered with splotches of blue. He had no idea the kind of figure his off kilter appearance struck against the smoking battle field tableau behind him.
Next, Several handmaids from Asgard arrived with fine (though complicated) Garments worn by the women of the planets high court. - Natasha sent them back.  That hadn't deterred Loki, if anything he realized the mistake as women of midgard wore far less. So, in a show of his changed ways he enlisted the help of Jane and her friend Darcy Lewis.
Steve knew what Phil was doing, he was watching the soldiers. Putting them at ease and then seeing how eager they were to make a good impression. The agent was testing them, formulating his next move. Let it not be said that Phil Coulson isn’t a dangerous man.
James stood listening the soft trill of ringing across the line. “Come on….come on you can‘t be that mad..” He mutters to himself. Honestly Loki could be that mad and he knew it. The omega was rather good at holding a grudge but even so - this was a special circumstance so Loki just had to forgive him. Right?
“Are you sure this is ok?” He’d asked her. Steve felt so guilty for putting so much on the woman even if Natasha seemed to take it all in stride.
Loki was in his room, well technically he was in Bruce's room cause he had moved all his things in and was using the floor given to him as his " Work and meditation chamber", Having magicked a portal in the room and everyone was too scared to now enter that floor - lest they end up on Jupiter or something.
Tony had come up from the workshop to find the penthouse bed empty; sure he was a little disappointed but tried not to dwell on it. Instead, he drug himself through a perfunctory shower before falling into bed. He managed about an hour of shuteye before that eighth cup of coffee came to call (decaf - pepper was a traitor who infiltrated his coffee maker after 9pm.) The alpha stumbled out of bed and into the bathroom, to hell with masculinity; if he didn’t sit down he’d probably piss on the floor right now. So there he sat with his head in hands, questioning his life choices for leaving that much work so late. He wasn’t 20 anymore; these long nights were digging trenches in his face a little deeper every year.
It wasn’t so easy to stop. When Steve told Tony he would miss him…he meant it. The solider didn’t make it a week before he called the billionaire asking to see him. They met for drink…then went back to a hotel and Steve broke the bed. Tony had never felt so deliciously sore all over, and in the morning did his best to return the favor.
Loki nodded. “I read that now many hospitals test abandoned children for the x gene. They claim it as protection to other children in the system and seemed to turn them over to a handful of establishments. Not all that seem savory.”
Steve seemed to know and thank god, he was willing to be the more mature one, “Maybe it’s best if you just let me read the journal alone. I’m sure you have a lot of work to do and let’s face it, neither one of us really want to have this conversation.”
“Sir, we have lost communications.” Jarvis reported and oh, this just kept getting better by the minuet.
He didn’t wait for her to say anything else, just nodding to her exiting and taking a moment to breathe in the empty room.
The soldier wanted to flare up, but he didn’t. He didn‘t have the energy for it now, contrary to popular belief the serum did not exempt him from a good nights sleep. Which he had not had in weeks now. “Sorry… just a lot on my mind.”
Loki rolled his eyes and Irene hid a laugh behind her hand. “No worries, they will chill out once they get their treats.” She assured as she started working on their order. “Then you will have a good hour, hour and a half of sugar high before the pass out for a good hour.”
“Tony…” Steve wrapped his arm around his alpha that night in bed, snuggling up to the inventors back. He waited a few breathes before nuzzling a little more intently against the alphas shoulder.
Bucky did take, and not just that night but again later. When the liquor wore off and he cornered his young friend whispering in his ear - “its ok babe, its ok. Be good girl for me sweetie and go rouge your lips. I love when my girl has pretty red lips.”
Tony thought it over as the elevator let him out in the penthouse, tugging off his stained tank top. “Yeah those sound good, oh and send him a message that I want to see him later but make it sound like a good thing. Oh and…buy Pep some shoes, something expensive and send her a thank you note.”
Howard didn’t say anything as he was nearly melted against his work desk. Peggy moved around picking up drawings and looking over the schematics. “Bombs…really Howard?” Had he really fallen this far? The one thing Maria had never wanted him to do ever again. Yet here he was, playing right into Stane's money grabbing hands. “ I thought you said military inventions to preserve life or defend a solider were one thing but mass destruction was another.”
No one had even seen the elusive inventor in the last three. There was some talk that the man had finally lost it, even so the government was happy enough to accept designs from a supposed mad man.
Steve kissed his forehead and pulled his little family in closer, “I know that sweetheart, I know. I hope you’ll never feel that way ever again. I’m so sorry you ever had to feel that way. Come on… let’s go get you warm, ok?”
Stark covered his face and chuckled into his palms. “Oh god, you Irish Catholics…allergic to birth control.” He pulled his hands away and looked into a pair of serious and longing blue eyes. “You know how hard it was with the twins. Are you sure you want to do that again?”
“The captain seems to be experiencing higher than normal body temperature, fatigue and anxiety. His hormone output is also elevated.”
Howard tucked his son in to the cradle and turned, surprised to see the blond siren standing on two legs (completely nude).
"Why, why don't you just go already? Cause I can't figure this shit out ya know? Why would you stay with me?" He asked because really this was getting ridiculous, the more time they spent together. The more nights they found themselves wrapped up in bed...it was going to make it impossible for Tony when Barnes finally did figure out was a mess he was.
“It already has...” The words where choked and harsh, they sounded nothing like the ravens elegant tongue. Loki walked away silently, not even bothering to tell Kurt to stop following him. They ended up entering a small meeting room near the library. It was a quiet out of the way spot, one that Loki had frequently sought as a place of solace between classes or after a long day in which had no wish to return to an empty home. He sat facing one of the long windows with its view of the forest and grounds. “Have you and your mate ever discussed children.”
Steve pushed his shoulders back and tried his damnedest not to let his voice show how apprehensive he was feeling. “You're damn right it is.”
Tony wanted it to just end now or know what this was about. Was it money? Was it fame? Was it just the sex? There had to be something measurable that Barnes wanted from him because really what else was there?
