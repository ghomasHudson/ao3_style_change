"Because it was better than being Tony Stark for one more day," Steve echoes. "So you sat down in the snow to die." A pause. He continues gently, so gently: "It's a shame it didn't take, isn't it?"
"Password accepted." The elevator glides into action, so smooth that if you weren't anticipating it you wouldn't know you were moving at all, but Tony's attuned to forward motion.
Tony's seen this or something like it coming for years. He has his own contingency plans to work the situation to his own advantage. As for his
Here's the causal chain: a small group of politicians incited by a less small collective of lobbyists decided that costumed heroes and extra-legal peacekeepers needed more government oversight. A minority of the public—those who remembered the string of brainwashings, defections, and bad decisions that shadowed groups like the Avengers—took notice of the initiative. Finally, a series of statistically improbable disasters (a hostage crisis, the PR and existential nightmare that was Stamford, some kid
There are two things that make Tony's party better than other people's parties. The first is the dress code. His attendants, including the estimable Secretary of Defense, are in Hugo Boss and Brioni; but Tony is wearing a bespoke suit, something far more beautiful than any construction of mere fabric. On the outside it gleams. On the inside it gleams. What is housed beneath the suit does not gleam, but not a single person here can tell if Tony's shaved, if he's dressed, if he's clean. Of course he is. He's a master of nanomachinary. No sodium polyacrylate or maximum absorbancy garments here—Tony has a waste disposal system that puts NASA to shame.
Before Stark leaves, I manage to fit in one last question. For years, rumors persisted that Stark reached out to Dr. Yinsen's wife and children to offer monetary support and was rebuffed. Instead, he funds a dossier of scholarships in Dr. Yinsen's name to sponsor underprivileged students.
Sometimes, though, the dream becomes a nightmare, a worse kind of What If. He imagines a broad hand reaching out to clasp him, fingers that wrap so softly around his forearm that a pure electric jolt of pleasure runs from his shoulder down to the severed end of his wrist. Steve slides his hand down, and what Tony cut away reassembles itself under the sweep of Steve's palm. By the time Steve's fingers tangle with Tony's own, it's like he never upgraded his hand at all, it's like a benediction that undoes all his hard work and denies him the opportunity for contrition, to be better and do better. He wants it so much. He wants that clean dry mechanical body the way a man in the desert with his mouth baked shut wants water. He wants that warm, golden void filled only with capability and intention. He wants. Is there any state that leads to more catastrophic ends?
He circles around the east side of the island and lands his helicopter in the empty parking lot by the docks to the northwest. Friday's waypoint has been a constant through his entire flight, like the kid hasn't moved at all, like he's just… waiting. Tony catches sight of Cap and the others on his way in. Maybe they notice him land; maybe they don't.
, they had other preventative measures built into them beyond what guarded against psychic attack, too. Chemical or viral attacks would have been picked up by the armor's sensors. Anything biochemical or biomechanical was almost out of the question.  Magic wasn't. Tony hated magic, but it wasn't out of the question. And if the armor was hacked, there was still a man inside the tin can who would remember—
STARK: Absolutely. My intention, obviously, was—I don't know if you know this, but I'm also a superhero called Iron Man—my intention was to integrate with the suit, but there were some, ah, side-effects. The upshot is that if I get bored in a board meeting, I can stream Netflix to my brain. Total technopathy, by design and on purpose. Effectively: I am the armor. Yeah, kid in the back.
"Are you kidding?" Tony settles his elbow on the arm of his chair and props his chin in his hand. "I was caught off-guard every day. If I'd forecasted this correctly, it wouldn't have happened at all."
Beneath the white blanket that covers him feet to neck Happy's still—not small, a guy with that much muscle could never look small, but diminished. Something important, some animating force, is missing. There's bruising on his face. They shaved his head. Maybe that's what's missing: not his hair, but the half-bashful way Tony can imagine him running a hand over his scalp while making eyes at Pepper.
It's the same old dance. Reactive, predictive, preventive, prescriptive. How do you react to what's coming? By anticipating it. Once you anticipate it, how do you respond to it? By understanding it. Once you understand it, how do you prevent or even change the outcome? That's the million-dollar question.
"I went twelve rounds with guys that didn't hit as hard as you," says Happy. "How was I supposed to say it? There's no way you can tell him that they want our schematics that he isn't gonna be pissed about." They're trying to soften the blow, Tony realizes, but Happy's right: after all he's done to keep Stark technology out of the wrong hands, SHIELD still thinks they have a
That was a lesser concern, but yes, I would like to emphasize that I was acting as a private citizen protecting my own intellectual property from being used to harm others. There were legal repercussions, by the way, but you didn't see that news in any major publication. Mr. Urich?
was a periodic waystation between trips and boarding schools and tutorages, and then later, when he populated the mansion with a family he built himself. Now it's a ruin. The southwest side that faces 70th is almost entirely gone. The west corner is collapsed inward, brick spilling into the shadowy conference room. The quinjet hangar on the third floor is open to the air.
"Same as you," Stevie says. "Couldn't sleep. Say, pass me the—" Tony tosses her a dishcloth. "Thanks."
"Again," his father barked, and Tony Stark, who was nine, lifted the revolver, steadied himself, and squeezed the trigger. As he squeezed, he flinched; it was the anticipation that did it.
"Fight what?" Tony says. "The system? The entire U.S. government? The president? The people? How do you think that's going to end for you? You aren't going to win this. Actually—huh. I'm not sure what's worse: that you're delusional enough to think you
They'd asked him to take his armor off, and he'd told them yes and then held still without struggling as they stripped him. He didn't fight. It was an entirely consensual encounter. Nobody can remove the armor without Tony's consent.
This, here, is the real violation, but he's already violated Steve's memory in so many ways that one more incursion isn't going to damn him any more deeply than he's already damned. Anyway, Steve used to love to share his sketches with Tony—not to the point of handing over his whole sketchpad, but always with the half-eager, half-shy expectation that Tony would
"Hey, boss," Friday says, and he can almost hear the echo of another voice in that greeting. "Didn't see that one coming, did we?"
"I'm tired of that question. You want to know why? Because someone had to keep one hand on the wheel. Because after Stamford, a mother came to me and told me I'd let her son die. Because I don't trust any community that has me as a member to regulate itself. Because my government decided that I have an irreplaceable role in all this. Because nobody else could do it better, and it had to be done."
890 Fifth Avenue. It's one of those addresses everyone knows, an address recorded in the annals alongside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and 10 Downing Street. It was—it used to be—home, both when Tony was a child for whom
) team of Avengers; and he's heading multiple projects that fall under the SRA initiative, including a multi-
A kingdom for his armor, that's how Tony wants to use it. Not this armor, this armor that Maya breached, this wet sack of armor that Tony wears like a suit; he wants his real armor, the dry hard strong armor, the shell that made him better. Now he's missing half an ear. That's why he got rid of ears on his real body. You never knew when someone was going to tear one off.
In the process of improving those original cybernetic arrays, though, he'd learned a lot about telepathy and cyberpathy. In the process he had designed and integrated into not only the armor but into his phones and watches and cars and homes a series of failsafes to guard against intrusions. Mind control. Brainwashing.
Someday he won't have to exude the armor because the peptides and lattice will be grafted into his skin—maybe replace his skin altogether. Tony exists on the cusp of transhumanism. He bleeds for his art, first red and now gold.
"He always said, 'Pep, don't let me end up like that. You tell me to quit, I quit, and if I get to the point where you're feedin' me mush 'cause I don't have the brains left to feed myself, you let me go.' He never wanted this. He would've… he'd
Pepper overrides the lock-out on the workshop after three days. With the little attention he can spare, Tony's faintly surprised; the last time he'd locked himself in the workshop, he'd been down here for six weeks working on the armor. Pepper rarely interrupts him when he's chasing an idea. Certain detractors like to paint Tony as a man-child who needs an entire team of paid handlers to keep him on the straight and narrow, but the truth is that Tony was starting college when most people were still wrapping their heads around algebra and running a multinational conglomerate before most people graduated college. When he locks himself in the workshop, SI almost always has a subsequent and corresponding surge in profit. Pepper knows that.
Iron Man has always been about atonement. Not only atonement; Tony built the suit out of necessity and rebuilt it out of love, he puts it on because that's who he is and who he wants to be, he improves it because of what he wants to become and he uses it because Iron Man is the best part of himself; but the suit and the name and the idea behind both are about atonement, a reckoning for all his sins, the wrongs he's committed and the wrongs that are yet to come.
"Indeed it is. No signs of deliberate sabotage yet, but the rate of the burn and the size of it… tappin' into the cellular network." A beat, during which shaky shot-from-a-chopper footage of the plant appears on his HUD. "There are employees trapped inside. I have an incoming call from Colonel Danvers—"
Boynton's principal sin was introducing the Registration Act. His subordinate sins, of which there are many, consist of the usual litany of greed and moral pliability combined with a keen interest in excising the useful portions of the SRA (medical coverage, mental health support, access to training and support services) and inserting inflammatory replacements (mandatory disclosure of powers, for one thing). Tony's never been sure of the degree to which Boynton was aware the Tony was acting against him; Tony is a consummate professional, always dressed in a suit and ready with a handshake, but Boynton's puppetmasters possess both deep pockets and deep secrets. Tony is here, right here, at this exact moment, because he wants Boynton to see his face. Understanding is too much to hope for, but Tony has planted the seed of understanding, and in another three or four years, after he's had time to sit in his solitary cell and contemplate his choices, Boynton may come to a realization about the architect of his misery.
"You can… touch, hear, all his life support equipment with your mind," Pepper says, and then she looks right at him—Tony, distantly, realizes that she's trying to make sure he understands what she says next—and covers his hand with her own.
"It's a volatile time," Carol says. "People are angry. The public's finally starting to question whether we defend against threats or create them."
"And that's great. I hear you. I'm with you all the way. The problem is that you are going to face adversity. You are going to face detractors. You are going to face your own fear. Because what future-proofing the human race means is radical, irreversible change, and that scares people. It should scare
But there are factors working against them. They're beat all to hell from the breakout, Adam and Monica are clear across the island, half the team isn't even
"Anything in particular keeping you up?" Stevie asks. Tony edges a little closer, hopes Stevie won't notice. Resists the urge to put her fingertips on the wing of Stevie's shoulder.
Senator Boynton's principal sin was in introducing the Registration Act; his subordinate sins contained the usual litany of greed and moral pliability. In the interest of national security, Tony had contacted the man who was both Senator Boynton's primary donor and the keeper of his secrets and leveraged that into a deal that resulted in Senator Boynton being removed from office and arrested. Tony may have murdered Captain America, but in at least one way John Boynton was an architect of his misery. In removing Boynton, Tony vindicated Steve—
"Have you ever been enough, Tony?" Steve asks. "What you are, what you do, who you choose to be—has that ever been enough for anyone?"
"We couldn't risk them getting that close to detained resistors," Iron Man says. "Or let them into the Negative Zone complex—they could be weeks in there before we'd find them."
"Get me a staff roster," he tells Friday. "Names, shifts, whatever you can. Pull directly from the data spine—the on-site hardware's out of the game."
Stark may have been officially cleared of all charges concerning Steve Rogers' death, but what he has done and continues to do to this nation and to Rogers' legacy is an act no less violent or criminal. Rogers so believed in the principles of privacy, freedom, and self-determination that he gave his life for his cause. Stark, who hides inside his armor at the top of his tower, appears to have no such conviction.
Most of the damage is the result of Wanda's final, desperate battle with Doctor Doom; neither the Mansion nor the team have been right since, not in Tony's estimation. The Vision died that day. So did Scott Lang. Clint was critically injured and spent weeks in the hospital, months in recovery. And Wanda left; no one has seen or heard from her since. Maybe she's alive. Maybe she isn't. The rest of them were about as useful in that fight as a butterknife in a shootout; Wanda was the only one with enough power to hold Doom at bay, but the cost to her had been unfathomable.
Perhaps most notably, a handful of Senator Boynton's longtime supporters quietly withdrew their support in the weeks leading up to today's arrest. An internal memo circulated at Oscorp (
Carol's dad had been a hardass. He was an alcoholic (weren't all fathers alcoholics?) and a traditionalist, the kind of man who refused to pay for his bright, brilliant daughter to go to college because he thought the money would be better spent on one of her brothers.
They grew. They evolved. They argued, and fought, and realized that total accord was impossible. They made each other better. They broke apart and came back together, and always there was the team that for all its foibles had become family to them both. Because that was what Steve was, wasn't it? Not solely partner or friend or brother but all three.
There's another game he plays, and that game is called What Is. He plays it because he can't avoid playing it; it's a hard game, grounded in the past and the present. It's reactionary and required, useful but not loved. When Tony plays What If, the results are clean; when Tony plays What Is, the results are not.
He's in the old Avengers suite. Nobody lives here anymore, except for Iron Man, who sometimes haunts it like a ghost. The sink is so spotless he can see his reflection in it—almost like Jarvis was here again to clean up behind the cavalcade of heroes who saved the world on their stomachs. Instead, now, it's only spotless because Avengers Tower is empty.
Steve is not Tony's first or only love. His most enduring, maybe, or his most painful, the one most deeply rooted, the one he could never quite shake. There's his own ego—Tony Stark's in love with himself, goes the joke—there's his own ideas, there's the things he builds with his hands.
ROSENTHAL: Amelia Rosenthal. Mr. Stark, what do you think of the proposed bill that would require extra-legal peacekeepers to disclose their identities to the government?
"And you look like someone who should be selling pharmaceuticals to terminal cancer patients at a four-hundred percent markup," says Maya. Maybe another of the things that Tony likes about Maya is that she doesn't like him; maybe not. It's hard to tell what she likes that isn't a laboratory empty of other people or an eight-digit grant. "Where is it? Did you
"It's that or read you headlines," Friday counters. "While you're standin' around and admirin' yourself, Keep Our Heroes Free filed a civil suit against the U.S. government for passing the Registration Act, SHIELD attempted to apprehend the Young Avengers, Colonel Rhodes received orders officially assigning him to Camp Hammond, and Norman Osborn had a letter published by the
"I am, too. Sometimes I look at him lying over there in that bed, and I think about him never waking up, and that makes even angrier. Happy says we should just be glad he's
"Please. Optical camouflage is so five years ago. Unfortunately, the latest processes are still classified under SHIELD protocols, but trust me when I say that what I can do now is very, very impressive."
"That's you telling me what you know, not asking me what I know." Her long hair is pulled back in a tail that falls over her shoulder, her face is free of makeup, and her gaze is filled with the crystalline clarity known only to saints. She isn't a martyr; this is her own design. "But sure, Tony—keep going."
Tony Stark is performative, Tony Stark exists entirely in liminal spaces; other people might have the comfort of home, permanence,
"All I'm sayin' is that it isn't like you. Rushing in, no plan, no backup—well, maybe that last one isn't as surprising."
"Me?" Tony says. "I'm not afraid. When you can futureproof the world, Cap, there's not much to fear." He winks. Like he did earlier at Lila. "I'm overclocking myself. That's all."
STARK: How well you know me is definitely a downside. No, kidding again. I'm not sure how definitive of an answer I can give you, but something that's difficult about working with him is how high his standards are. That sounds like the cheap answer, you know, he's Captain America, of course his standards are high—but this isn't a Cap thing, it's a Steve Rogers thing. He's a far cry from perfect, but he always expects himself to act from this place of compassion and… 'honor' is the word I want, if that isn't too romantic... and even when he doesn't meet those standards, he picks himself up and tries again. He doesn't give up that ideal, even when his back's against a wall. When you're around someone like that, how can you not strive to do the same?
"We'll have a better support staff for you, too. More people on your level, people who you can delegate to." The door swings open; Jack looks up. "There we go," he says, "here's one of those people now."
Steve's staring, wide-eyed, fist still extended, like he can't believe they went this far; but then his expression sinks back into that graphene stoicism, that all-American bedrock repression beneath which is only anger.
JV: I hope you knew while you were still alive everything I want to say now. How much I respect you. How much I value our friendship.
The nominal ceremony to make permanent Tony's tenure as director was pretty basic. He's been to two dozen similar events before, and they're all the same: the usual parade of bland white faces, the hand press, the humorous asides that land just shy of vulgar. Congratulations, Tony. Finally got what you wanted, Tony. Hope whatever happened to Hill doesn't happen to you, Tony. Yeah, Tony hopes that too. It's the only thing he still hopes for himself, on his own behalf. His other hopes are nebulous, a vast starscape haloing his head. On a clear night, he can pick them out in the distance. On a really clear night, he can even remember their names. Here's 'Hope Pepper isn't alone' and 'Hope Happy wasn't in pain'; here's 'Hope Boynton's at the top of this food chain' strung alongside 'Hope nobody looks too closely at my extradimensional prison' and 'Hope nobody uses this as an excuse to resurrect Wideawake'; here's a binary system, 'Hope Steve didn't die hating me' hidden in the corona of 'Hope Steve hated me until his very last breath.' So maybe there are some hopes that still shine just for Tony.
He can't build this. He can't figure out the logistics. There's beauty in the design, in the way his eyes have been replaced by advanced ocular lenses with a three-hundred sixty degree field of vision, in the way that his skin has been peeled away and substituted with low-maintenance carbon nanotubes grafted into an exoskeleton. In the What If, very little of his original organic matter remains; there is some small biomass located in his torso, mostly to continue certain processes that provide chemical energy to redundant systems. His faulty heart has been replaced with a backup processor.
In recent days I have seen a level of vitriol directed at supporters of the recently-enacted "Superhuman Registration Act" that shocks my sensibilities. These sentiments are not only crude but un-American. The Registration Act was passed by the will of the people, and it is enforced by our legally-elected government. This is not to say in the ethical mode that legality and morality never come into conflict; but neither is the correct course of action when faced with a just law that is personally unpalatable to react with violent force.
In the What If, Tony opens the liquor cabinet. He takes out the bottle. He pours. He lifts the glass. He drinks. It goes down soft and then with bite. He downs it neat and pours another glass, and his blood lights up with gold and his thoughts take on a warm glow. It's that contradiction he likes best—burning out all the messy organic material and the cold remoteness of his reasoning at the same time. If you take that away, what's left? Maybe nothing. Maybe that's the most aesthetically pleasing state of existence: a warm, golden void.
He visits Cap once, just once, in the cell aboard the helicarrier where he's being held until he's charged. They stare at each other through the bars for a long time; Iron Man wonders if he looks as much like a stranger to Rogers as Rogers does to him.
"Plans," Reed says. "Yes, of course." He pauses, pins down the corner of a blueprint with three fingers, studies the design: it's for a community center, one of those projects that had seemed important until the country decided to act out some kind of Orwellian parable. The right side isn't always the winning side; but neither is reality as easy to parse as fable.
"Good, because she'd flatten you." Tony takes a pawn—his first success of the game. He's sloppy tonight. Sentiment does that to him, like grit in fine machinery. "Faster would be better."
TS: You look like you're about nineteen, you know that, right? Also, I noticed that you didn't thank me for my time, which if we're talking going rate is a lot more valuable than Cap's.
He reads his paper with no apparent awareness he's being watched for a solid five minutes before he turns the last page, folds it in half and half again, sets it on the table, and looks straight over at Iron Man.
All he has to do is gather a little information and get out. Easy. Done. With enough evidence to construct a timeline he can convince—
"Last night you mentioned somethin' about neurological feedback in the armor. I have some ideas on that point," she adds. "And… there's the hospital, boss."
Tony swallows down his bile. He doesn't have an answer for her. This whole headlong rush—he hasn't been thinking
STARK: Even when he isn't serving as the Avengers' chairperson, the media expects him to take responsibility for the team. It isn't fair, but people demand a lot of him, and you said it yourself—I do get into trouble.
"She's got enough on her hands with high school," says Rhodey. "She doesn't need you recruiting her to your R&D department for at least another decade. Give her a chance to be a kid, Tone."
And Tony hears it: the unmistakable whine of micro-repulsors. There's no sound like it in the world.
"We've spent a long time policing ourselves," Stark said, "but it's unfair to put that burden on a community already burdened with so much. It doesn't matter if it's brainwashing or a series of bad decisions; when someone with extreme capabilities loses control, people suffer."
"No," Tony says, and he checks the locks on the hatch and watches through the security cameras as Gomez trots around the corner and confers with a familiar man in a suit. The whole time he can feel Steve's eyes on him, can feel Steve looking at him—and it's like he's stripped of his armor, it's like Steve rather than Tony has cut Tony apart to see how he ticks, it's like he's being vivisected by a man who doesn't care for what he sees at all.
SR: Patton was all right. Arrogant, sure, but he did what he needed to do. That much responsibility could drive anyone at least a little out of their mind.
JV: I have one of his sketches framed in my office. It was that A-line evening gown with the side slit that I designed for Wanda from one of my earlier collections. He drew her wearing that with this gorgeous pair of Saint Laurent earrings.
"Any idea why me?" There are half a dozen more obvious or better qualified choices. Dum Dum's not even the lowest on that list.
The boy and the girl had been like siblings, although sometimes they'd fought, and sometimes they fucked because it was convenient, and sometimes they shared a bottle of whiskey while they pulled apart the universe. Do you know how rare that kind of meeting of the minds is? Out of seven billion people, maybe forty are genuinely Tony's intellectual peers. Maybe only twenty. Maybe only ten. The sex had been fine, but it was never as good as the conversation.
But apparently those in power are willing to buy in to Stark's charade, because he has once again been entrusted with political power he hasn't earned. Instead of using his celebrity status to drum up support and funding, Stark is serving as an official consultant both to SHIELD and to the Department of Defense; he's running the only government-sanctioned (but not the
"Local teams are congregating here and here, Captain"—Friday lights up a couple of points on a map of Manhattan—"but the helicarrier is still en route from Washington, D.C."
Tony's anger is like his old bum heart. It flares wildly, a pure white starscream that quickly refracts into the acid green of shame and the ceaseless violet of grief. Tony doesn't have the energy to sustain his anger for long. He doesn't have the power to direct it outwards; it always collapses inward on itself. The red light of his anger can never escape the black hole of his despair.
He wakes up at six o'clock precisely, runs through a systems check, scans the headlines, talks to Friday. (
He severs the fine ligaments with surgical precision. It takes time and patience to tease the web of sinew away from bone; sometimes he imagines using a dull deboning knife, one that tugs at the filaments of flesh until the edge catches just right and the collagen splits apart. His arm is intact above the carpals, just the tip of his radius and ulna poking out from the cross-section of tissue that curves around the exposed bone. He doesn't feel pain, because pain is an outdated diagnostic tool. Tony receives real-time feedback from all of his components, data that is precise and exact and useful and does not hurt no matter how deserved the hurt might be. It's one of those sins he should carve away: the wish to be free from pain rather than the wish to endure it.
Tony stimulates his nervous system in a way that imitates the effects of a jolt of adrenaline, but it doesn't stop his eyes from falling half-shut.
"I didn't understand myself. I was still a kid in a lot of ways back then. I thought I could come home from the war, pick up working as a sketch artist again, maybe start a family… anyway, I thought I could come home from the war, but I had no idea what 'home' looked like. The Avengers gave me that.
Steve was haunting him, not in his dreams because Tony didn't sleep but in his waking hours. He would look out at the world and see nothing but a blue-eyed boy looking back, and he knew, he
"How many people do we know who have lost someone because a sick man with a grudge figured out who was fighting them under the mask?" Steve says. "How the hell can you possibly think that putting a complete catalog of secret identities within reach is going to protect anyone?"
"Got a funny way of showing it, Shellhead." Steve pats Tony's ankle. "Now you're always going to be the man who murdered Captain America."
It hardly needs to be said that the superhero "civil war" is anything but. Cape-killer units openly patrol the streets of New York, Washington, and Los Angeles in search of resisters; fights between supporters and detractors have broken out at fourteen college campuses across the country; and peaceful citizens like Julia Carpenter are hunted down on live TV with the full support of the federal government.
Back when he still slept, Tony used to have this dream. It started like this; he can't remember if it was a nightmare. All he has to do is tip backwards and sink into the bed, which would catch his body as he sank into it and support him against the firm even pressure of gravity pulling him down, and he could find out. All he has to do is tip backwards and let himself fall until his body goes lose and heavy and then he could close his eyelids and maybe he wouldn't even dream. He can't remember if in the dream he was dreaming; all his nightmares are in the waking world.
Little Lila Rhodes looks like her eyes are going to swallow the rest of her face. The press likes to paint Tony as a showman, but what he really enjoys more than performing for a crowd is performing for that one person in the audience who not only appreciates but
Nothing is wrong except for all the things that are always wrong. Tony calls those operational conditions; it's like flying under visual flight rules. You can't do anything about the weather, but you can make better instruments. "Nope," he says. "Five-by-five, Cap. Just busy with work." Steve can't complain about that, can he? He's a workaholic. Too. Also.
He's flinching now. He can't write it out; some things are apparently too deeply ingrained in his nervous system to be overridden.
"I have a favor to ask you," Pepper says. Then she stops. Her narrow jaw works up and down, like she's fighting against something shored up deep inside her. Tony realizes her eyes aren't clear—they're glassy.
When it's all over, he becomes first aware of exposure. The whisper of air against the soft skin of his cheek is like a slow tender graze from the fingers of someone beloved. A yoke sits oddly over his shoulders, constricting, tight and then lose and then tight again as he shifts: a shirt, a jacket. There are shoes and socks on the other side of the room. His feet are bare against the floor, his toes fragile and alien. The watchword is vulnerable.
"Boss," Friday says. "Tony. I think you might be dissociating." Her lilting voice swallows the final consonant:
should clean out Steve's room. Tony is struck by thoughts all day long, a thousand every minute, his mind a planetary body under ceaseless bombardment by a shower of meteorites; but this thought seems remarkable.
VP: You can touch, hear, all his life support equipment with your mind. He wouldn't have wanted this, Tony. You could turn it off. I would never know.
"Sure, Tony," Steve says. "You might not matter, but they do. Sixty-three percent. Seems to me like you ought to step up and take responsibility."
He still has full access to his communications suite, so he starts there, pulls up a map giving him locations of the Avengers based on their ID cards, integrates footage from nearby security cameras, compares that to recorded biodata on Steve's basal survivable state. Another level of his attention is occupied with attempting to crack the execution program itself; a third is searching for a way to activate the armor's automatic shutdown. He integrates the results and arrives at a conclusion. While he's occupied, the armor closes his hand around Steve's throat.
If you're anything like me, you hope every funeral is not only an opportunity to mourn but also to remember all the good times. You know what I mean—it's that moment when you meet someone else's eyes and you laugh through your tears about the poor dead sorry son of a bitch. No one laughed at Captain America's funeral. No one laughed later, either. Maybe they would have, under other circumstances. If there's such a thing as a good death, then Steve Rogers' death was assuredly a bad one. He staked his flag on a principle and refused to lower it even when his brothers were fighting for the other side. And, by all popular measures, he lost. How many of his friends didn't attend his funeral for fear they would be arrested?
She's there at Happy's bedside, of course, leaning forward, her elbows braced on her knees and her face hidden in her hands. Maybe she's crying. Maybe she isn't. Is she praying? Does Pepper pray? Happy would've been praying, had their positions been reversed—he would've been talking at her, too, pleading and prodding her until she'd have no choice but to wake up just so he'd give her a moment's rest. Pepper, though, she just sits, maybe crying, maybe praying, maybe lost, stiller than Happy himself.
. Lila understands. Rhodey understands. Even Steve, for all that his mechanical ability is limited to basic motorcycle maintenance, understands. There's passion in what Tony builds, a fine symphony of design aesthetic and functional beauty, attention to detail and creativity and sheer dash. The press also likes to joke that the armor is Tony Stark's religion; if the armor is his religion, then his workshop is his cathedral.
Extremis was, essentially, robotic microsurgery: a nanite package delivered via direct injection into the bloodstream that interacted with the central nervous system. After the injection, you scabbed over. That didn't describe the horror. Your
I had the pleasure of meeting Steve on a handful of occasions, and what always stuck with me was his anger. You might be thinking of Cap punching the Red Skull in the face, or quaking with righteous fury as he stood toe-to-toe with Ultron; but his anger wasn't an idealized, mythological kind of anger. He got mad. He got pissed off. He'd swear when he stubbed his toe (I was there; I heard it) and he'd yell at teammates when he thought they stepped out of line and he held grudges with the fervor of a true, born-again believer. We once spent twenty minutes talking about the importance of solar energy in third-world countries, because, as Cap told me with all the bite and ire of a good man who saw other men doing nothing, it wasn't fair to expect someone who struggled to feed their children to care about saving manatees.
If you can't change the event and you can't change your response, the only solution is to change your self. Tear it down. Take it apart. Build something better in its place.
Ambre Morel, a resident of Dijon and former airline captain, saw the wreck happen from the backyard of her home.
He stands there, caught in the sight of it, and then he very gently reaches up and touches his earpiece.
What he wants, what he really wants, is to crawl into bed and sleep. He doesn't sleep anymore, and that's an oversight, because if you remove the need to sleep you should remove the desire to sleep, too. The problem with complex systems is that the effects of removing one outdated component inevitably lead to the discovery of complicating factors. When he slept the best, though, was when he'd been on a month-long binge of invention, when he'd locked himself in the garage and lost whole days to narrow focus on a single idea and then, when the project was complete, he'd stagger over to his cot in the corner and sleep dreamlessly for twelve or fourteen hours, safe under his tower and Friday's watchful eye. There was always a cost to pay later: the comedown, the sharp decline from not only the high of working but from that neutrally stable place of good sleep and a good morning after. It didn't last, but Tony has always been a sucker for the most fleeting of positive experiences.
Tony twists like an unwinding spring and slaps the next blow away. It buys him enough time to put some distance between them.
We can't keep intervening when intervention is unwanted—we certainly can't keep intervening when we're providing the wrong kind of intervention. We have a responsibility to obey the wishes of the American people when we're acting on their behalf.
At the time, the Avengers had been offworld, providing an assist to NASA by installing monitoring equipment on Mars. Most of the equipment had been proprietary technology of Stark Industries. Tony knows how that looks. He knows that it's been a slow news cycle. He knows that people who are caught up in grief and fear want a convenient target to blame. He knows that part of the reason the story's still getting attention is because it happened so close to the city the Avengers call home. None of that stops him from wanting to ruin the reporter who tried to suggest that any of the blame is Steve's to shoulder.
He's back in the picosecond. Once upon a time, Steve wouldn't even have taken the time to think about the capabilities of the Iron Man; once upon a time, Steve would have already been moving by the time Tony's tongue and lips and teeth wrapped around the word
As he hangs in the air, his primary point of interest is a small progression currently moving up 7th Avenue. Clint Barton was transferred early that morning from the helicarrier to a temporary holding facility near the World Trade Center—a certain Senator had wanted to speak with him. After nine hours, a highly uncomfortable conversation, and a proportionate amount of paperwork, he was loaded into a truck by Ryker's Island guards. His journey started twenty-two minutes ago. Very shortly it will reach its terminus.
Steve used to say a lot of things. He can't anymore, because he's dead, but if he were here, he'd say—he'd say—
Tony startles and dumps coffee all over the back of her hand. Stevie's reaction is immediate: she lunges forward, flips on the lights and then the faucet with one hand, grabs Tony by the wrist and shoves her hand under the water with the other. "Are you okay?" she demands. That's Cap all over. She's a firebrand. She could be Tony's firebrand.
Tony skirts the edge of one of his fabricating units and comes up behind her. "My first attempt," he says. "It's pretty much defenseless—almost no weaponry. That was a problem."
Tony doesn't have to be better if he can make the armor better, but he made himself part of the armor, so that means he has to be better, too.
"The least you could do after killing me is do something decent with the life I gave you," Steve says. "You owe me that much." His voice is this low, soft, relentless thing that Tony can hear bearing down on him from behind. He could pick out that voice in a room of five thousand.
When the doctor refuses to discharge him, he checks himself out against medical advice anyway. Happy meets him at the curb with his favorite Rolls—Happy's favorite, not Tony's—to drive him home. They ride back to the tower in silence, Happy in the driver's seat, Tony in the passenger's. He tilts his dark glasses down and looks up at New York, up and up and up, and he wonders what Steve had been trying to say:
STARK: Stop smirking, it isn't attractive. Let's see, the hardest part about working with Cap… is that nobody would believe how mean he is to me. Obviously I'm kidding, don't put that in the book.
That was before Steve decided Tony deserved to die, but the papers are all still there: driver licenses, passports, credit cards. Steve had even had the foresight to use less iconic photos of Tony, which means one driver's license bears a picture of him with scruff almost thick enough to call a beard, surely taken after three or four weeks locked in his garage to work on a new project; and the other has a photo captured during one of his rare periods with no facial hair. That Tony's cheeks are flushed, his eyes bright, his laughter barely contained; if you hadn't lived inside him, you would've thought him free from sin.
FuturePharm, for the most part, is unlit and unoccupied. There are a couple of security guards wandering around, but Tony's been dodging egomaniacs who are keen to impress upon him lessons about responsibility for most of his life. He's a pro, an old hand; it's the least of ways in which he prostitutes himself.
A hot curdle of humiliation the likes of which he hasn't felt since Steve was shot to death blooms in Tony's gut. He's humiliated, he's always humiliated, when he thinks about this. He deserves to feel humiliated.
Once upon a time there was a bright drunk girl and a bright drunk boy, and they each recognized in the other something of themselves. They studied under the same wise old master, and when he wasn't trying to push psilocybin mushrooms he was a pretty good guy. He believed in his students, he believed they could change the world, he believed they would test-pilot humanity right into the future.
"Ha ha," Rhodey says dryly. He, like Tony, is used to Friday's sense of humor; she's a little more pert than some of his other AIs, and a little sharper for it. Tony, improved beyond human limits, interfaces directly with his suit, without the lag time of translating reflex into body movement into armor response. He thinks; the armor moves; it's a superior solution. Rhodey still requires a software intermediary. For the past few years, Friday has served that purpose.
. Tony wonders if the kids have been having bad dreams; Valeria had night terrors for a few weeks towards the beginning of this whole mess, and Reed had been a wreck over it.
Steve stares back at him. Steve is everything that Tony Stark isn't: a hero stripped of weakness, of limitation and doubt. Steve is something better, something more, Steve is everything that Tony Stark aspires to be. He's dead right there in the corner. He watches Tony with blue blue eyes, and Tony watches back with blue blue eyes of his own. Jesus aren't they handsome men, these two blue-eyed boys.
Listen, Tony's thought about this. He's had a lot of time to dwell on it, because when he gets a thought in his head he just can't—let—it—go, and of all of his obsessions, all of his grand orchestrations of idea, all of his What Ifs and What Ises and conceptual playgrounds, nothing has taken root in his soul in quite the same way as Steve Rogers. Steve isn't the dearest concept, or the most important; but he is the most persistent. He's aspirational. He won't go away. Tony's tried to drive him out a time or two in earnest, but even those times are fewer and further between, because Tony doesn't really want Steve to go. If the only way he can have Steve is to let his mind be haunted, then he'll throw open the doors and invite the specter in.
Twenty feet behind Rogers, Barton's restraints drop free. Cage starts forward to flank Rogers, but Rogers holds up a hand to halt him. Somewhere off to the left is the titantic shudder of Captain Marvel making landfall.
"He's a destabilizing force nonetheless," says Boynton, the architect of all this misery. "Mr. Stark, in your official capacity as chief consultant to HomeSec and the Registration Oversight Commission, we strongly urge you to take care of Rogers as rapidly and overwhelmingly as possible."
Maya had orchestrated every last movement. She'd staged the theft, passed the virus to a group of domestic terrorists, explained Extremis' capabilities in way exactly designed to catch Tony's attention. What better field-test than pitting an Extremis-enhanced enemy against Iron Man? How delighted she must have been when Tony failed and came to her door begging, how delighted she must have been to find herself with not only one but two test-subjects. Because who begged to dance on the other end of Maya's puppet string?
"Yes, she's recording," he says. "I can ask her to stop, but there's not much point in it; she's smart enough to piece it together once I start trying to implement what we theorize here."
It's a little schmaltzy for Tony, a little more rote than his usual fare; he's pretty great at off-the-cuff extemporaneous speaking, but he's gambling that this audience isn't going to love him if he presents them with flash and logic and three random anecdotes followed by a lecture on particle theory that build to a finely-honed point. Summation, submission, tie it up in a neat bow: done.
The laugh that comes out of Tony is less amused and more startled. "There's a lot of people who would disagree with you."
He's out of the weapons game and now he designs phones. There's value there beyond the monetary. Miniaturization, that's fun, pressing the limits of processing power, making something good on a budget—Tony likes that. He misses the other thing, though, the destructive thing, and that's something he'll never share, although anyone who watches him closely enough would probably suspect. When you're gifted like Tony Stark—when you're brilliant and limitless and ruined inside—there's a value in being challenged, in being stretched. Building a better phone doesn't cut it.
"There's a story behind the Registration Act. A woman. Her son. The son's untimely death… do I need to mention their names? Let's let the kid rest in peace. It's enough to say that his death was caused by our neglect.
. He lives in that liminal space where thought translates to reality; give him a problem, and his shoulders are broad enough to move the world.
Maybe that's where Friday picked up the nickname. "Don't I always?" he says, as if his fault lines aren't showing, as if this is just one more grand lark—Team Iron Man thwarting SHIELD and fighting the bad guy of the day. Was it ever like that?
"She's always recording, unless I ask her not to. Which, and this isn't a slight on you, is usually when I have less clothing on. I didn't get the impression that we're having a naked brainstorming session, but…" But what? Tony abruptly lacks the energy to bring his usual parade of verboseness around to a point. It's just gone, the willingness, the performative investment in trading shallow wit for attention, it's gone, it's like someone siphoned it away. There isn't any point in pretending with Reed anyway. Reed cares, but Reed also understands the bigger picture; Tony's wants are unimportant when weighed against the issues at hand.
Before they stripped the armor, one soldier on either side of Tony had stretched each arm out and pinned it in place like you might pin a beetle to a mounting board. The soldiers had both been members of Alpha Team equipped with powered suits of their own that were far less sophisticated but still adequately strong to restrain the Iron Man when it wasn't struggling. His belly was exposed, his vulnerable underside left open; they spread his arms and then Agent Carstairs requested in solemn recitation each of the external suit devices. "Let's have the gauntlets first," he'd said, and Tony shucked the gauntlets like you'd shuck a corncob or a fingernail, and two more soldiers of the many in the room took the gauntlets and laid them out on the floor in neat parallel lines where they were left discarded for someone else to pick over.
"We could move him, you know, if you think a different environment would be better." Nothing. "You should take a break. Shower, sleep, eat something that isn't served on a styrofoam plate. I'll stay here as long as you—"
His rock bottom: all those weeks and months when he'd crawled into a bottle, finding sanctuary only in the soft hollow glow of addiction, and the steady, subconscious knowledge of Steve's disapproval was the only thing that prevented him from drowning himself in that golden escape.
"Good," Howard said. (Tony basked.) "Deep breath in… breath out… and remember: don't pull, squeeze."
JK: Maybe. Anyway, we're temporarily relieving you of your position, medical assessment pending. I have all the paperwork from the CSA and the DOD right here.
BIRCH: Let's go back to the Avengers. There's one partnership that has anchored the team since the very beginning—
Tony looks past the people, past the banks of electronics, straight out to a view without a horizon. They're parked six miles above Omaha, and it's clear skies as far as a transhuman eye can see. Tony blinks over to infrared, blinks again to summon an overlay that tells him the names, ages, and security ratings of every SHIELD agent on the bridge. The overlay isn't on his HUD. He could take off his helmet and the same bright web of lines would be drawn not over his eyes but his nerves. Some day he won't need the armor because he will be the armor.
"Because you turned them down, handsome," Tony would answer, and he'd bat his eyelashes a couple of times to see if he could make Cap flush or laugh. Steve always seemed to take Tony's flirting as a joke, and Tony went along with it, the refuge making him more brazen than he would've been otherwise. If Steve had understood that the flirting wasn't a joke, Tony would never have flirted with him again.
BOWMAN: We exist on the cusp of extinction. No one talks about that. A few decades ago, the question was whether we would survive long enough to fling ourselves out among the stars although we had no example of another species doing so. Now we know that alien races exist, but where are our colonies? Why are we not living on the moon, or Mars, or on some distant habitable planet? If something happens to Earth, we're screwed.
He finds Friday. She's already working on countermeasures, preventative inoculations to make sure that what Yinsen's son did to Tony will never be done again. He takes her work and adds to it, gives it back to her, waits to see what she does with it; by the end of his first day of consciousness, his protocols and hers are already in place.
. Dead, though, he was an almost irresistible attraction—that whole corpse, all his ticking parts ready to be disassembled and laid bare. Someone had to take responsibility, had to make sure Steve wasn't punished for the sin of perfection.
"Only to folks I like," Steve says, and Tony enjoys the sound of that so much that he plants one on his blue-eyed boy, morning breath and all.
What he really wants is for Hill to stop talking about his relationship with Steve. Tony isn't blind; although most of the people around him tend to treat him like he's excluded from the secret, he's aware that 'intense' is not a strong enough word for how he behaves around Steve. He does his best to spin it: friendship, a respect that verges on hero-worship, a craven envy of all the things Tony isn't. Very few people are in a position to suspect the truth, because it would ruin him if it got out. Pepper and Rhodey have wondered, probably, because they know Tony too well. Happy, because he's the only guy who can make Tony feel dumb. Natasha, maybe, although who the hell knows what she thinks behind that Soviet reserve? Rumiko might've guessed; but Tony hopes she hadn't.
What people neglect when they talk about Howard Stark is his strength of character. He called Tony names: weak and wimp, sissy, soft, pansy and pussy and momma's boy. None of the names were inaccurate. Howard Stark was a hard man in a hard world, and he did his best to make sure his son was hard, too. It's how you survive. It's how Tony survived. He wouldn't be alive today, if not for the strength of character his father passed down like commandments. You get tough. You have grit. You make yourself into a man. That's how he knows his father loved him.
The neutralizer concealed in Rogers' palm activates the moment their skin touches. Iron Man goes down like a sack of bricks.
TS: Just keep standing there and handing me tools. Okay, you're familiar with the idea of the "cutting edge"—
There's a pause that Tony suspects is more for his benefit than Friday's. "Best guess: in excess of fifteen hundred degrees."
He sinks down to the floor while he waits—back to the cabinets, knees to his chest. Maybe if he compresses himself into a dense enough body, he'll collapse into himself. Poof. No more Tony Stark, just a black hole the size of a micron.
He's on the bridge when he gets the call. The Registration Division helicarrier is parked over Omaha, Nebraska, for reasons that on some level make sense to Tony and on another level render him incredulous. Intellectually, he's aware that New York isn't the center of the universe, but he still believes in his gut with all the faith of a born-and-bred New Yorker that other places, especially in flyover country, are inconsequential.
Thirty-three days ago, Tony poured a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black down the sink in the kitchen behind him. He didn't drink any of it, not even when a single gleaming drop fell from the mouth of the empty bottle and ran down the curve of his thumb. The seal on his armor is impenetrable, maintaining a complete artificial atmosphere in its confines. Iron Man is its own world, a bubble set apart from the rest of the universe, an absolute division between what is without and what is within. Despite that, Tony can smell whisky on the back of his tongue and the roof of his mouth.
"Good," Steve says, with none of the hesitance Tony would have anticipated. That's Steve—he manages to be a surprise, even when Tony has access to the most accurate predictive software in the world backed by his own intuitive gift for extrapolation. "Gearing up for a big deep-cover op. She was angry that Hill pulled her away from her preparations to run a milk errand."
TS: You catch on quick, Cap. There's a lot to be said for early adoption of technologies that aren't otherwise stable, and I have the resources to be a very early adopter.
We've got a some interesting updates for you, since apparently it's been a busy couple of days for America's finest.
When Senator John Boynton (D-NY) looks up, he doesn't see Tony Stark. He sees Iron Man, gleaming and impassive, a being made perfect and free from human sin. There remains some small organic matter within Iron Man, a quickly-failing bundle of bone and tissue and error. The useful parts of his organic matter have already been incorporated into the Iron Man, who does not sleep, does not need feeding, does not waste resources building castles in the air. Tony knows the hollow golden glow of that perfect instant will be enough to fuel him as he struggles towards the ultimate realization of being the Iron Man in every moment, not just some of them.
Tony almost gives it up. What's the point? He's never liked asking for help—call it paranoia or experience—but the one thing he wants almost as much as he wants Steve is Steve's moral clarity. Or does he just want Steve's approval? Aren't they one and the same?
, we have to be willing to transcend our limitations. Does it scare me? Sure. But since when has that stopped any of us? We do what we do because we recognize fear, we look it in the eye and say: so what. We're creators. We're engineers and scientists. We're the architects of the future."
"You know she's not gonna stop talking about this for the next month," Rhodey says. "If you needed someone to hero-worship you, though, couldn't you have hijacked a different guy's niece?"
Avengers are spilling out of the kitchen; someone turns on the lights and Tony blinks hard and tightens his pupils. Peter, still in costume, jerks his thumb towards the window and asks, "Hey, Cap, should I vamoose?"
He shook hands with the devil so he could sleep at night; and now here the devil is, walking through the door, educated and erudite and genial and with all the serpentine intent in the world behind his eyes.
DAEDALUS: No. It's slow going, although compared to what you would encounter under less permissive circumstances—
In the footage, Tony takes his helmet off. He cradles it in his hands, between his knees, as he sits. The sheer blank eyepieces stare back at him, and it's one of those moments, one of those for-the-eye-sees-not-itself moments, which Tony has subverted by in some sense manufacturing himself new eyes. He can't think, can't find the words. What can you say when your heart lies unbeating on the table beside you? He's had artificial hearts before, he'll be just fine. That's something he can think about—taking his body apart. He thinks about putting something more useful in his chest, something that functions flawlessly, something that works perpetually without dismay or anguish. He thinks about his ribcage, the smooth curve of white bone, how absolutely intact the white bone is. There's no scarring there, no wound, no hole-punch circle that blew out his spine. He thinks about internality. He thinks about the blind universe. He thinks about taking his body apart. Eventually, Tony thinks of everything.
That's his problem: he's always looking for patterns in what others take as random noise. Steve used to say that Tony had good intuition. What Steve didn't understand is that Tony's intuition is really just an ability to assemble environmental data collected by his subconscious into a coherent idea. It isn't art, just engineering. Tony is here in Nebraska for intuitive reasons; that his mind has yet to fully reveal the mechanisms of that reasoning is a flaw in Tony himself. It's fine. He's a work in progress. Steve used to say that art was never finished, only abandoned, but Tony isn't a work of art. Someday Tony will be transcendent, perfected, sure of himself and free from sin. Tony Stark 3.0 is on the horizon, a being so flawless that no one will ever abandon it again.
"Neurologically speaking, I think you'll find I can," Maya says. "Beyond that, I'm not going to tell you how that anklet works. You've stolen enough of my secrets."
Finally they had torn away the armor from his waist down, waiting for Tony to relax each piece into their hands as their fingers ran along the knobs of his ankles and the creases behind his knees and the soft insides of his thighs. He could still feel each part in his head, the connection made possible by Extremis so seamless it was like he still wore the Iron Man even as they yanked off his greaves and boots. He had put the armor on lockdown before, once upon a time when a kid named Mordred had found a backdoor into Tony's brain and used him like a weapon; as a preventative, Tony had shut the armor away from himself and set Friday to watch it. This was nothing like that. They weren't inside him. He could feel each piece of the armor as they'd grasped it and peeled it off.  He still wore the undersheath.
"Yeah, well, that was just… predictive damage control. Look at all the decisions that came back to bite me in the ass. I didn't anticipate the important parts." He pauses, lets the name fill his mouth; when was the last time he'd said it to another living person? "I didn't anticipate Steve."
Tony pulls up the autopsy results. He didn't have to be here, could have accessed the reports from anywhere, but he wanted to see it with his own eyes, the eyes he built himself. Compared to the medical records pulled from the Registry, Messner-comma-Georgia has obviously and dramatically been altered on a molecular level. The hallmarks are all there. Gene therapy, or, or magic—something changed her, bloomed for a brief moment into power far beyond the ability to flick her finger and light a fire, and then it ate her alive.
It was still raining, and Cap's six pallbearers looked just as soaked and miserable as the horse that came before them. Of course, the weather didn't really matter; they would've been just as miserable on a balmy beach with clear skies and warm winds. Misery likes to travel. You'd recognize most of those pallbearers if you've picked up a newspaper in the past decade: King T'Challa, Ben Grimm of the Fantastic Four, Colonel Carol Danvers herself, and of course Sam Wilson, Cap's partner. The fifth, less recognizable but no less pedigreed, was Rick Jones; the sixth was a man simply identified as a 'friend.' He looked to be about Cap's age and was no less miserable than the rest.
He is, not to put too fine a point on it, a genius. He doesn't know the how or why, but he comprehends the evidence, what little of it there is: carbon scoring on the armor when he hadn't taken it into the field, a constant exhaustion that should have been countered by the Extremis upgrades, a series of obituaries that confuse the issue even further. He couldn't find any video footage, but that doesn't mean a hell of a lot; he'd been bragging to Lila Rhodes about integrating stealth technology into the armor, and part of that is a full suite of jamming systems. If Tony wants, he can wipe himself from every camera and phone, every satellite, every emissions tracker and computer log in existence. The only hardware he can't wipe himself from is the human mind, and that's more of an ethical limit than a practical one.
Actually, I have a doctorate—no, I'm kidding, I'm being flippant again. You're referring to the actions I took against Justin Hammer and his buyers when he stole my technology and made it available on the black market, I'm guessing?
The tide of his despair crashes into the wildfire of his anger; the ashes of one meet the shore of the other, and something new comes forth, something molten and righteous and right. Maybe this is what Steve feels like all the time—all that confidence—that fury—
"I did enjoy cutting you off, too—don't mistake me." This time, when her hand falls to his ankle, it stays there. "When they said they were concerned about you, that they needed to contain you, I stepped up to serve my country."
"You know, sometimes I wonder if you realize how much better it makes me to be around someone who pushes me like you do. You make me see things in a new way, make me take stock of all my assumptions. And then you go and do something like this, hide away because you think you know what's best… I don't know if I can take it. I just don't know."
"Maybe you do," Steve says. "Always with the crystal ball, never with the mirror. You don't have much time left, Tony. How are you going to use it?"
There's no one here, per the cameras; he didn't want Friday interfacing with the network, because there's no telling what Maya considers reasonable security measures within her own domain. She guarded her work with all the brutal, artless ferocity of a junkyard dog. Tony, who once hunted like animals the men who stole his designs, can't fault her for it.
It's a What If; it has no bearing on reality. Tony puts it away. He has a six-mile drop to worry about.
"Sorry," he says, and he dumps his empty cup in a trashcan and goes to acquire a car. He leaves Eppley Airfield driving exactly the speed limit, which should get him to FuturePharm in an hour twenty. Friday keeps pace the whole way: "Left here," she says, and Tony will turn left, and then she goes back to whispering in his ear, keeping him alert, making sure he knows the layout of the lair of the beast. He doesn't believe in angels, but if he did, he'd believe in the angel of Fridays.
Carol throws him a sharp glance, checking if he's making the sort of lascivious joke people would expect of the Tony Stark who smirked at the world from the front of the newspaper. No, that gives her too little credit; Carol knows him. Her offense has older roots.
The kid's waiting for him on one of the piers. Lanky, disheveled. He's sitting cross-legged in front of an open laptop. Tony walks out to him and stops ten feet away, numb to how anticlimactic it all is.
He's in favor of the SRA. Says that if the proper authorities had taken a little more interest in his case, early intervention might have prevented the mental break that led to all those deaths."
On a fundamental level, their anger disagrees. Steve is a slow, eternal smulder; there was magma moving beneath the surface of his skin a thousand years ago, and in another thousand years the molten river of his fury will still be burning strong. You don't often see direct evidence of it on the surface, but you feel the heat in your bones—a comforting, righteous, necessary sink that was all the more dangerous for its familiarity. Sometimes, though—sometimes all that heat and pressure would build up until even Steve's thick skin couldn't contain it any longer, and then it would erupt, spewing fire and ash and noxious fumes into the sky. An endless fountain, that was Steve; predictable, maybe, in the way that forces measured in eons rather than years are predictable, but no less terrifying for his predictability.
Cage and Drew are at the rear of the vehicle extracting Barton. Cap is at the front, the one security guard stupid enough to attack him at his feet. Spider-Man's about halfway up the side of the Paramount Theatre. There will be others; Cap may have been unable to resist the opportunity for a public demonstration, but he'll also have arranged for a fast extraction and plenty of support.
, would be the kindest word. He bypasses the closet and takes a turn into a bathroom that could almost contain a public swimming pool. Turns on the showers, scrubs, rinses. He lets himself have the duration of a moment to build a What If. It's a private What If, and if he had the time and energy he'd let it grow into something more lovely and intimate, would maybe even take the time to jerk himself off. One of the reasons Tony likes sex—maybe the primary reason—is that sex is a release of tension. He badly needs release, but no masturbatory fantasy could remove the sword hanging point-down over his head.
This is the basic divide in the Yang Hierarchy: parahumans are wholly separate species. They are born to their abilities. These powers are innate, part of a distinct genetic heritage that marks them primarily as either
His whole life reduced to two neat lines; how was that fair? Tony was a futurist, but sometimes it felt like he chased the future less than he was chased by it.
Dawn is coming up over Manhattan. He feels a little like Arthur riding out to meet Mordred, and then he chides himself for the comparison. Tony is no Arthur, and Yinsen's son is—
And even the psychological dependency might be beyond her. On a basic level, Friday's needs are simple. She needs a purpose, she needs engagement and stimulation, and she needs better hardware. Tony has the last point covered and does his best to keep a handle on the first two; even he isn't quite so heartless as to birth a new sentience and then leave to rot on its own. That's what makes it beyond her. She doesn't understand black and white, all or nothing, she doesn't understand that the only way to cope with needing to control everything is embracing the nihilism of being out-of-control, she doesn't understand that you have to fill up the constant cavity in your chest with
He's right. (Reed is almost always right.) But how to change a bug into a feature, that's the real question.
, not Friday and not Happy, not Steve, who by circumstance and by design retains the high ground, and not Maya, who displays a ruthless single-mindedness that Tony both admires and abhors. Maybe, with a lot of R&D and years of testing, you can start to fix yourself; but Tony's never been entirely sure how to structure that experiment. He tries things, and sometimes he succeeds, and sometimes he fails, and the conclusions he reaches rarely match the conclusions reached by those around him. There's something off in his moral compass, something in him that spins the needle away from true north. If he could, he'd cut that part of himself out entirely.
CB: Why I invited Steve. I was surprised by how little substantial writing there is on the Avengers despite your team's high profile, and I'm including individual members in that. Not that there aren't exceptions like you, but not all of the Avengers are famous war heroes.
Sometimes he keeps himself so busy that he doesn't remember how tired he is. It isn't a temporary tiredness, the kind of thing that can be solved with a nightcap and a nap; the exhaustion he carries is set in his bones, has been accumulating there for a decade or more. It's the kind of tiredness that leeches the meaning and the color from the world around you, the kind of tiredness that smothers every want except the want of a soft, grey end. Tony's
Reed looks up, startled. "We shouldn't," he says, and Tony knows what he means by that: there are too many other things that need tending. Massive things, monumental things. Rest comes to the deserving.
"But that same community has gone without oversight for too long. Trust me, I've had a front row seat"—he pauses to let them laugh; Lansing, Ralston, Byrd, and Dickerson do, the rest don't—"and I know exactly how much stress these people are under. That's not to mention the external forces working against them; the threat that someone twisted who has psychic powers or access to mind-altering technology poses to those with power and trust is dire. Registration acts as a safeguard not only for the general public but also for the very group it regulates.
The thing that made lithium useful even beyond its medical value was its application in batteries. You could make disposable batteries with metallic lithium, or rechargeable batteries from lithium-ion. There isn't nearly as much lithium on Earth as there is iron, which was going to be a problem eventually but wouldn't a problem in Tony's lifetime. He still worries about it, though; someone has to.
He sets down the glass of whisky with a tender care and doesn't spill a drop. "Have you talked to him lately? He misses you. It's sad. I once knew an orphan who looked less like a kicked puppy than he does these days."
The second stop is to down a hot cup of coffee and a burrito after Friday makes a pointed inquiry. It isn't his best idea; he hasn't eaten anything solid in months, but if his body's finally going to stop walking around, he's going to have coffee for his last meal. Some people weren't afforded that luxury, so Tony might as well enjoy it enough for both of them.
"Okay," Tony says, and her hands take the mug Stevie offers her. She shouldn't have done that—shouldn't have given in. How does the saying go? Temptation is her only weakness.
Osborn unnerves people. He appears, at first glance, like nothing more than a reasonably-fit businessman on the far side of middle age: educated, erudite, genial. And then something about the eyes strikes you—or the slow slide of his too-wide smile—or the way he watches you from behind his glasses—and you become aware that you're watching a foreign consciousness manipulating a person-suit. The uncanny thing is that he can charm you anyway, get inside your head, anticipate and twist your own thoughts. Iron Man has always been mildly fascinated by him; and repulsed, too. Is his psychosis a tragic reason or a convenient excuse?
That's the problem. Steve's solutions, his wants and needs, are clean. Tony's solutions are complex. Complexity is not always desirable, but sometimes it's unavoidable.
Tony hits a blank wall and drifts over to the bookcase. There's all the authors you'd expect, if you were Tony Stark and you knew Steve Rogers: Bill Mauldin, Frederick Douglass, Doris Kearns Goodwin, J.R.R. Tolkien. There's all the titles you wouldn't expect:
"Boss?" Friday says, because of course she doesn't have eyes on the situation. She's caught in the phone in his pocket, anchored in a much more literal way. "Are you all right?"
The footsteps following him down the hall halt. Tony can feel the gravity of that great body pulling at him. His tidal-lock orbit was momentarily disturbed, but they both know he'll fall back into it—always facing Steve, unable to look away unless rattled by an event of catastrophic proportions.
You have fallen far, Tony." The satiation increases, but there's no pleasure in her face. "I'm going to make you ask, by the way," she says. "Ask me. Go ahead. Do it."
Once upon a time, Tony bled for his art, first red and then gold. Now he's necrotic—fluidless and brittle. He doesn't bleed. Dead men don't. And worst of all, they've pulled him out of his coffin, so he's left without a way to lock all the rot away.
"Protected by the most sophisticated software security Stark Industries can muster," Tony assures him. "The registry is private, confidential, and accessible to only those with the highest security clearance. There's virtually no chance of it being stolen or exploited."
The original control suite for the Iron Man was almost entirely mechanical; Tony moved, and the armor responded. There were triggers based on all kinds of miniscule actions, an HUD that responded to eye movement, verbal sequences that would fire the jet boots, electronic nerve commands that would prompt the palm repulsors. Later, as his designs grew more sophisticated, he built in a cybernetic sensor array assisted by a limited artificial intelligence: the armor started to respond not to
HP: How you were always there when we needed someone to entertain Clint and help him burn off energy while we were trying to concentrate.
He still has this. No matter how the rest of his world fractures around him, he still has the armor and the joy of flying it. That sensation of freedom and fear tangled together lives in a pit behind his ribs; nothing else touches that spot, and if he dies in the sky, he'll roll up to the pearly gates and confess with complete honesty that it was worth it. If nothing else he did in his life proves worthwhile, he'll still have the memory of flight.
There's a cosmological mystery called the lithium problem. It concerns itself with the early moments of the universe: the nucleosynthesis of the first elements other than the lightest form of hydrogen. All the current models of the big bang correctly predict how much deuterium and helium-3 and helium-4 were born in that infancy; there's no gap between what is calculated and what is observed. But what of the lithium? Based on those otherwise correct models, there should be three or four times more than there actually is; and while the scientific community has put forth an entire hymnal of proposed solutions including several likely candidates that cite dark matter, no one has really ever satisfactorily explained where all that natal lithium went.
"Very good," she says, paternal and Socratic, "although of course I tested on baseline humans, too. The real question, though, is: by what means did I achieve all these ends?" His blankness must translate to his expression, because she smirks. "Do you really not know? We serve the same masters."
They crack the hatch while he's still staring at Steve. Tony doesn't resist. It's not worth the effort.
Pepper's hair has fallen around her face. Instead of brushing it back, offering her a hug or at least a tissue, Tony squats down beside her and curls his hand over her shoulder. Squeezes. Lets her know that he's not going anywhere.
He jerks. Shakes his head. Retracts his attention to the confines of his physical body. Ignores the glitch.
It's dark outside but it isn't dark at the top of the elevator where the Avengers live. Sometimes, for that reason, Tony regrets giving up the suite of rooms two floors down that he'd initially reserved for himself to Pepper and Happy; to reach his actual living quarters, he still has to make it from the elevator through the family room and past Steve's door. Putting Steve in the room across the hall wasn't Tony's choice, but, like Wanda used to say: man plans, and God laughs.
She chews on that as they drop below the ground levels. "Huh. What about Friday? She like working for you?"
Senator John Boynton (D-NY) had been the one to introduce the Superhuman Registration Act to the 109th U.S. Congress. It had passed through both the Senate and the House with unprecedented speed; Friday staged an entire holographic production of Schoolhouse Rock's "I'm Just a Bill" to either cheer Tony up or piss him off—hard to tell with her. The president signed the act into law in the early days of summer. A matter of hours after it passed, Steve Rogers, in one of his usual unintentionally iconic displays, had announced his decision to resist Registration and go underground. Neither the announcement nor the resistance were peaceful.
"It isn't. You can't—the changes the enhancile made, that's my body. You can't shut off part of my body."
"C'mon, guys, knock it off. You don't have to laugh at every dumb joke I make, although I have to say, it's great for my ego. You know how often Captain America laughs at my jokes? Not often enough, that's for sure.
"Thank you, Mr. Stark," Senator Lansing says. He's known her for years; she was a corporate executive before she sold her soul to politics, but she's not the worst person in the room. "I speak for the rest of the room when I say we wouldn't have accomplished half so much without your support."
He flies to Memorial, arcing up out of Stark Tower and then back down, down, down to the sidewalk in front of the hospital. The armor folds itself neatly away in a briefcase summoned from molecular memory; Tony straightens his cuffs, and he walks inside.
"No. I haven't gone this long without talking to her since…" He breaks off, moves a pawn. Doesn't finish.
be too emotionally compromised to effectively dispatch his duties. There is only one positive indication of this assessment (noted in our prior communication, although again I must stress that this is observational only and that nobody has eyes on the Director of SHIELD at all times), but there are a number of negative indications that may offer additional evidence. This is another conversation better had in person.
How can he argue with that? He can't. Lila isn't really one of his kindnesses. He doesn't care about her only out of altruism, because she's Rhodey's niece, or out of mutual interest, because he sees himself in her. He cares about her because he can construct a What If with her as the foundation, a What If that puts the future of his company in her hands.
gave me that." Steve pauses, and then says, almost to himself, "Guess I fell a little in love with the future along the way."
he also found time to buzz D.C., Denver, and upstate New York between coming up with diabolical schemes. Guess it pays to be rich
Cap blinks a couple of times and then looks back over his shoulder at Tony. "I'm not all that sure, either," he says. "You look tired."
There's two ways to see it. In the first, this is Tony Stark dying a hard death of his own invention—a death that leaves him, ultimately, alone and in the dark. For a man who has struggled his entire life towards illumination, it's the most ignoble end possible.
She is, because it's going to hurt, and at the moment Maya Hansen is very interested in hurting Tony Stark. He can't say he blames her.
Only in defining "extraordinary abilities" do these concepts start to get fuzzy again. Dr. Yang has argued that humans with profound skills or access to cutting-edge technology also qualify as metahumans. The SRA doesn't quite agree—the phrase "parahumans, metahumans, and other peacekeepers gifted with extraordinary technology or skills" appears fourteen times in the body of the Act—but neither does it deny that some humans can, through dedicated practice or advanced machinery, keep up with the Earth's mightiest.
"You were late last week, too. After we got the distress call from the Port Authority." Steve's eyes narrow, hone in on Tony. It's too much.
"You're always talking about emerging technologies," Stevie counters. "You couldn't have known what it would do to her."
"Okay, let's reframe this conversation. What do you do with your computer when it won't do what you want it to do? Let's say you're trying to crunch some numbers on the viability of doubling the thrust of your jet-powered roller skates, but the crappy little notebook with the pre-installed software that you bought from one of Stark Industries' competitors can't keep up. What do you do?"
means only that he must rededicate himself to self-abnegation. The armor helps. He can take a lot of abuse in the armor. One day he'll manufacture an armor so flawless he won't even feel it. He'll build himself into the suit; he's on his way already.
He puts on his coffin and falls. As he falls, he whispers in Friday's ear. "I'm glad he's dead," he tells her. He should've said it to Carol; that would have been more honest.
That prison is perhaps the most audacious of Stark's many abuses precisely because it has very little to do with the SRA. Stark and his allies originally proposed the project with the spin that no currently existing facility was sufficient to hold violators of the SRA, but an unnamed source within the Pentagon recently verified that most active resistors are instead detained at a facility located near the Camp Hammond complex. In contrast, Prison 42 is now home to some of the country's most dangerous criminals—including Franklin Hall, Ophelia Sarkissian, and Norman Osborn—but, strangely, not many of them: Prison 42 currently operates at only 15% capacity (although the prison is far from being finished; that the facility is ready to house any prisoners at all speaks of a suspicious degree of foreknowledge).
Tony plays What If the way some people play chess: to sharpen his instincts, inure him to his flaws, and develop his ability to value strategy over sentiment. It works. On some level, his plans always work.
"I'm thinking," Tony says slowly, "that the delta waves serve as an indicator. What's this?" He touches one of the spikes on the graph.
Tony grunts. Pours himself a cup of coffee. Makes some crack about how they aren't all geriatric earlybirds. And leaves. In his head, before he leaves, he calls Steve
Tony Stark, CEO of Stark Industries and co-chair of the Avengers, shocked America on Thursday morning when he came out in favor of the proposed Superhhuman Registration Act. The bill is currently under review by the Senate Homeland Security Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management and may go to vote as early as next month. If passed, the act will require all extra-legal peacekeepers to register their private identity with the government in exchange for a federal stipend and benefits.
The shield is on the table beside him. So impossible does the current state of the universe seem that Tony half-expects the chest beneath that shield to be heaving as it sucks in oxygen to pump through the great heart that should by all measures of goodness still be beating.
BIRCH: I hope to correct that. Ms. Potts and Mr. Hogan are obviously very close to you; is it fair to say that they're your inner circle?
"Particularly when Captain Rogers and his underground are gaining more supporters by the day," adds Ralston.
"Yes," Maya says. "A database of every metahuman in the country who so much as helped an old lady cross the street. Names, addresses, abilities. I said I needed access, and they handed over the keys."
JK: I'm hoping I won't have to, but if you resist, I will remind you that you trained Alpha Team yourself. Don't make this harder than it has to be.
like, in some entrenched part of himself that he can't excise. In reality, even older iterations of the armor had automated processes that let them continue fighting if he lost consciousness. It can't have been more than ten seconds. His arms are braced in front of him while Rogers batters at him, over and over again, with his shield.
I needn't tell you that this is going to look bad especially in light of losing Hill. The instability we're projecting is going to make recovery difficult. It appears instability is the central issue here on a number of levels. We need to play this by the books and tap as many credible witnesses as possible.
If he's going to turn himself in, he'll have to destroy the armor first—maybe all the armors, since almost all of them have wireless arrays he can use as rudimentary controls, even if none of the previous models allow for the symphony of concordance he can achieve with the Extremis model. He'll have to destroy the Iron Man first, and then he'll have to notify Hill and tell her… tell her…
It's a good present, a clean future, with none of the attendant troubles of reality. In the What Is of this world, the Vision is dead. Wanda vanished years ago. Hank has retired to a gentler life of SSRIs, entomology, and academia. Clint would sooner spit on Tony than speak to him. And Steve Rogers is right here, a line of ash smeared through the letter on his cowl, shield drawn back to swing at Tony as behind him a man goes up in flames.
"I saw the footage of your lecture at Cal-Poly. Nothing surprising there—just you talking about the Extremis like you own it."
At 6:03:03, Iron Man backhands Captain America, levels his repulsors at whichever SHIELD agents and Avengers were accompanying him, and fires. He levels the field. He
Her face is both skeptical and transcendent. It's a good combination. He wishes he'd hung on to a little more of the latter and a little less of the former.
Stark's interests are simply too divided to adequately serve the position. He would be, however, my first choice for running some kind of associated task force that would enforce the Act in the long-term. It is in the interest of national security to once again allow SHIELD to operate broadly, as it did before the Act, instead of eating up its resources solely with enforcement.
Tony, who is folded within the Iron Man, which is itself folded into the suite of rooms that once housed the Avengers, doesn't reply. What can he say to that? There's nothing he can say that Steve doesn't know already. They know each other too well. It's a sign of Tony's own deficiency that even a fathomless understanding can't span the void between them.
"Dormant. Well, that doesn't in any way sound like a trap designed to lure me into a fight with a bunch of supervillains and then squash me like an ant."
He drew a couple of cartoons of me later on, too. I liked those a lot better than any of the medals they gave me. He was even younger than me, you know, must've been about twenty-two, twenty-three… What are you doing under there?
"Good for them." Steve wasn't big on public appearances that focused on him, but he'd only ever sung the praises of Erskine, who was by all accounts not only a talented biochemist but a good man, which is more than Tony can claim on his bad days. Biochemistry's never been one of his pet interests.
What's going on six miles beneath Tony's feet is that three of the local peacekeepers (that's the SRA's term) have gone missing. Not at the same time; Captain Ultra vanished four weeks ago, Gadget a week after that, Paragon two days later. Gadget wandered back into the local police station barefoot and drugged out of her mind thirty hours after she disappeared and apparently retained no memory of what had happened to her. The other two have yet to turn up. Tony figures they're dead and buried in a cornfield. But there's a pattern here—
Cap bares his teeth, heaves. Sucks in a deep breath and spits out, "Electromagnetic pulse scrambler. Nick Fury's boys developed it back in the day. Weren't sure if it would be effective skin-to-skin after Extremis, but we figured it wouldn't do anything unless we cracked the armor."
I'm going to be off the grid pursuing a lead for the next couple of weeks, but my new partner and I will return with an exclusive that's guaranteed to knock your socks off. Keep an eye on our site:
He came out a couple of years ago, when he started working closely with the Department of Defense. Maintaining a secret identity was childish, particularly when Tony Stark was a high-profile target in his own right. And it was good for the company—the people who didn't write Iron Man off as one more rich-guy adrenaline-junkie adventure took a second look at Stark Industries' employment policies, their charitable contributions, their green-energy initiatives, and decided that maybe Tony Stark wasn't a total waste of space after all. Discounting his patents. People always love Tony's patents.
"Sometimes I wonder how we let you get to this point," Steve says. "How we let you do this to yourself."
He invests in Lila Rhodes, mathematics prodigy and engineering wunderkind. She graduates from MIT with degrees in—doesn't matter. EE, mechanical, comp-sci, whatever she thinks will serve her. She's like a sponge, she can always pick up a couple of extra doctorates later on if that buoys her ship. By twenty, she's a VP at Stark Industries, the darling of Research & Development, Pepper's pupil, and Tony's protégé. And here's the great thing about Lila—she's already as fascinated with the armor as her uncle. Tony builds her a suit, and then he watches her build her own suit. By twenty-five she's head of the company, an active-duty Avenger, and a boardmember of the Maria Stark Foundation. They call her Shellshock.
"Sure am." Stevie pulls out another mug and then, with an overtly self-satisfied expression, a box of herbal tea.
When he has to sleep, that's where he sleeps; and when he doesn't have to sleep, some dreaming piece of him is still and always in that cathedral to engineering.
"Jesus Christ, boy," Howard said. "You're flinching before the gun even goes off. Stop tensing up. Like this. Both eyes open and on the target.
STARK: The idea that I'm a magician, that's a mischaracterization. I like to have contingency plans. I don't—I don't always do the best job of telling other people what I'm thinking.
The armor stares back at him. Iron Man is everything that Tony Stark isn't; Iron Man is Tony Stark stripped of flaws and weaknesses, of human indecision and human worthlessness, of human limitation and human shame. Iron Man is something better, something more, Iron Man is everything that Tony Stark aspires to be. Iron Man doesn't have a death wish. But there's this: what had he told that kid at Cal-Poly? Post-Extremis, Tony
"Not strictly true," Tony counters, because Friday has full discretionary access to his accounts and the freedom to purchase whatever desire demands and reason allows. He's never been sure why conventional wisdom portrays artificial intelligences as emotionless, flat,
Tony shrugs. Below, Columbus Circle is a bustle of traffic; his eyes focus well enough now that he can pick out individual faces in the ambient light. "You were torn away from your home, Cap. Nobody can blame you for taking a look at our brave new world and wanting to turn back the clock. God knows I would."
"Explain to me how unmasking is supposed to counter that, though," Tony says. "You want to come after the Avengers, fine. We're the big guns. We've got a target painted on our back and everyone knows it. How many of us maintain a private identity? Almost none. Registration hurts the little guys—the people who go out and stop robbers or pushers or street gangs."
Tony slips a finger under his collar to feel the throb of his pulse against his finger. "Yeah," he says. "Can we talk?"
They all had their own suites here. The new helicarrier quarters the new government-sanctioned Avengers, but here once upon a time they'd made a home. He walks past their rooms: Jan and Carol, Adam and Luke, Natasha and Monica and Peter. And at the end, on opposite sides of the hall, Tony and Steve. Tony's door is open. Steve's door is not.
People fall in love because they understand that passion shores up the holes that reason can't patch. They fall in love because they're lonely, because they don't want to be lonely, and because they don't have any choice. Sometimes they fall in love because they want to fall in love. Tony wonders at that kind of freedom.
"You won't believe me when I say this, but I will miss you." Her face softens, her eyes soften; the crease of her mouth goes lax. "You're brilliant, Tony. You were my friend. For a long time, you were my friend; and I don't have friends. But this is my legacy, and that's worth more to me than you. It's worth everything."
It's a nice fantasy. It's a nice story he can feed himself when he's standing in the kitchen of Avengers Tower at two in the morning surrounded by empty seats, Clint's Cirque du Soleil mug, the Far Side panel Jessica Drew had taped to the coffeemaker, the baby bottles Luke had left behind. Sometimes he opens the junk drawer to stare at the pencils inside; they aren't anything special, plain Ticonderoga #2 pencils sharpened to a fine point, but Steve had put them there so he'd always have a pencil handy. That's another weakness Tony can't afford: nostalgia. Or yearning, maybe. Self-indulgence, certainly—his tendency to pity himself has always been one of his less attractive traits.
"Boss?" Friday says. Her voice is coming from a speaker across the room, because she can no longer whisper in his ear. That intimacy has been stripped from them.
TS: It's what he would've wanted. I believe that. We're the ones responsible for pulling him out of the ocean, we should be the ones responsible for putting him back in it.
"Good wording," Tony shoots off. "That wording always leads somewhere good. What is it? Graviton's parole? Registration bill? Foundation gala?" They'd covered all of those in the meeting, he knows, he was there, Extremis was there, making up for Tony's wandering attention, making him better.
"Sir," Agent Gomez had asked, "is this okay?" And Tony, as reassuring as he could possibly be from the cold remove of the ice beneath which he shook, had said yes.
"Friday?" Tony says. (This is later.) "Wake up and get to work. I'm not paying you to sleep on the job."
At this point, to Carol, the argument is abstract. She feels threats in her gut; that's not a slight against Danvers, who is a great tactician, a great leader, great to have on your side in a fight. But she feels threats in her gut. Tony constructs the future. He knows where this is going, knows that the last straw is coming, knows that on that last-straw day the good old U.S. of A. will be going on a witchhunt that calls not for blood but for
As he pieces together parts, he lets his imagination catapult him to the next step, and the next step, and the step after that. He imagines having a body that is modular, easily repaired or upgraded. He imagines having eyes that never tire and breath that never draws short. He imagines having the mind of a petascale computer and the heart of a super-soldier. This is Iron Man, beatified—Tony Stark 3.0, no longer really Tony Stark at all.
Her lips twitch; they're always mutually delighted when they play along. "Leviticus said witches should be stoned, actually, but there's a play—"
"Congressman, with all due respect," Tony says, "SHIELD and the Avengers are doing what needs to be done to ensure that Rogers and his allies cause a minimal damage."
"Spoken like a spymaster," Tony counters. "And when did I say I was opposed to a trap? But that's one thing—catching them all off-guard as a group. Going after them individually is an entire canning factory of worms."
HH: No, but that doesn't mean you're doin' anything different now than you were then. This is damage control. Maybe Cap and the rest of 'em don't see it, but I know you.
The kid smiles. "Look," he says. "We do agree on something. That's right. My father gave his life for you, and you have done nothing to deserve it. You said you would stop manufacturing weapons, but every day you put it on—Iron Man, the most dangerous weapon you can imagine. And who is better at imagining weapons than Tony Stark?"
"Boss, I think you're havin' a panic attack," Friday says. "Can you focus on your breathing? Count with me—"
Maybe it's why Afghanistan shook him so badly—they locked him in a cave for three months, and while claustrophobia is one of the only major anxieties he hasn't manifested in one form or another, he suspects that's because he long ago learned to associate subterranean spaces with his workshops. And the cave in Afghanistan had been that, at least; it wasn't only a workshop, but it was a workshop. Rhodey got it. Nobody else understood, but Rhodey— Rhodey got it.
. Always a step ahead of him, that's Maya, who sees no problem with selling her oldest friend down the river if it meant releasing her panaceia three years earlier than the correct channels allowed. He knew how she benefited the first time; he doesn't understand how she's benefitting now.
No—it's more true to say that some part of Igraine is always trapped in Tintagel, stuck on the eve of defeat and deceit. Tony is supposed to be a king, a knight-errant, a heroic figure in gleaming plate, but instead he's stuck here in this tower under siege from every side.
He doesn't even have to take the armor off to work on it. That's how Reed finds him; they were supposed to meet tonight, but Tony forgot. Reed knows the access codes to the workshop, though, so he shows up anyway. That level of trust is as close to a declaration of brotherhood as Tony can get.
(still confusing, right?) were sighted outside of a convenience store in Queens. Since the two have publicly denounced the SRA, we have to wonder if a certain someone's underground isn't based in the area…
"The kind you're legally entitled to wear." A pause. "Colonel Rhodes called. He wanted to know how you're doin'."
"Ouch," says Tony. "Again, your logic is unassailable, but ouch." He drops his rag on the nearby workbench and gives the Model 29 a friendly pat as he passes it. Behind it, like a ghost image, he can see the Models 30 and 31 and 32, he can see 33 and 34 and beyond, stretching out in an infinite progression to perfection. "What sheer genius struck you in the middle of the night? I have the transition plans for Project 42 just about drawn up. Transporting some of those guys is going to be tricky. Maybe we should get Graviton to collapse himself into a briefcase."
But in the end, even the Model 29 is just a prototype. It sits on the surface of a terminal error. He sees the whole of it, right down to the shatterpoints—the weaknesses that sit at a nexus of flaws. Two hundred days ago, Tony fell asleep. Someday he won't ever have to make that mistake again.
By mass iron is one of the most common elements on the planet. Small wonder that the world changed when humans learned to master it, to pull it from the earth and smelt it and beat it into tools. There's a mysticism there that Tony appreciates; small wonder that iron showed up in folklore. Cold iron, that was for keeping away the fairies, and horseshoes were for luck, and iron fences around graveyards kept the ghosts inside. He could use an iron fence of his own when he's this close to leaking out his own body like a soul in a cartoon—extracted in a cloud of cold vapor through his nose and mouth because they took away the iron that kept him inside.
In those days, after Tony had surrendered the twin indulgences of hard liquor and secret identity, the intimacy between he and Steve had been so great it was almost like they had no secrets at all. In retrospect, his naivety is staggering, irresponsible, destructive. Of course there were secrets; Tony always has secrets. He keeps the worst secrets of all clutched to him like something precious, where the only damage they can do is to Tony himself. There are things he'll never tell Steve, things he'll take to his grave; that he would rather die than tell Steve Rogers what lies in his heart is not exaggeration.
Rogers shifts. "You know," he says, "when I came out of the ice, you only wanted to show me all the good things about this time. I used to think you were trying to sell me on the future, but that wasn't it. You're so fixated on how things could be that you can't look how things are in the eye."
"Ulfius says he's looking for a wizard because his king is wasting away for want of a woman, and the beggar says, well, hey, I know the guy you're seeking. Thou seekest Merlin, but seek no further, for I am he. And then Merlin says, if your king will give me what I desire, I'll give him what he desires."
Much ado has been made about the unconstitutional liberties taken by the Registration Act, but not nearly enough attention has been paid to the language of the act itself. More than one critic of Registration has compared it to Project Wideawake and other proposed measures that were little more than thinly-veiled attempts to legalize and enforce anti-mutant prejudice, but Registration's supporters are quick to point out that the SRA doesn't target mutants and in fact never once uses the word "mutant" at all.
"Done," Friday says. "Doctor Richards wants to discuss integrated rehabilitation programs while you tour Wonderland—"
. "Aiding Mr. Stark is my primary directive," she responds. "My… 'day job.' I have other interests."
HH: In that case, we better make this the most well-defended community center in the tri-state, huh? I'll make sure these end up in the right hands.
"I've always thought of that as one of the best days of my life," Tony says, "but it occurs to me that it was one of the worst for you."
"You know what I could never figure out," Tony says, "is how when I drink, it's substance abuse, but when he drinks, he's opening himself to the higher mind."
Steve turns away, furious, but he has it under control fast. "Friday, wake Adam and have him meet us at the quinjet. I want a full work-up by the time we lift off."
There was a time when Tony bled for his art, first red and then gold, and the lightest touch of his armor would have popped that lock like a shell shucked from a shotgun. There was a time when the merest thought would have summoned all the information he needed—Maya's whereabouts, SHIELD's surveillance net—there was a time when Tony wouldn't have had to leave Tintagel at all, because his merest thought could affect change from ten thousand miles away. Igraine never had that failsafe, but Tony's life is an elaborate nesting doll of failsafes. He stacks one failure inside of another.
"With all due respect"—Tony works weights and measures in his head, discards the formal for something a little more personal and earnest—"with all due respect, Jack, you didn't have the power to recall me even before you appointed me director."
"It'll be worth it. We'll have a cape-killer unit standing by just outside the helicarrier gate and Carol's Avengers waiting outside the Ryker's Island portal. Call in backup from Hammond if you have to. But until then, don't talk about this to anyone."
When he fights his way back to consciousness, he wishes he could say he's lit up with a moment of clarity. His body is lit up, the ear renewed, the heel intact; it's the first thing he checks, and seeing the smooth bag of his skin stretched over the architecture of his foot makes his vision swim. Cutting off his heel feels like a dream, like something he'd done so casually it amounted to nothing more than removing one module of his armor before replacing it with another.
Tony retreats to the window in the living room. When he stood here this morning, he couldn't figure out the logistics of his solution. He saw the vision, but he didn't have the means to execute it. Now that his back's against the wall, he understands perfectly.
"Two weeks," Rhodey says. "She and Dad came up from Georgia. Dad said he was tired of me spending all my leave bumming around his house."
Steve was haunting him, not in his dreams but in his waking hours. He looked out at the world and saw nothing but a blue-eyed boy looking back, and he knew, he
There's a certain state Tony can reach under the right conditions: a luminous state that almost approaches grace. Pain is a crucible that purifies him until all that remains is the kind of clarity known only to mystics, the kind that lets him hear the signal in the noise. Trauma is not something to be endured but rather something to be embraced as the genesis of revelation. So let his heart be carved away, let his armor be taken, let all those deaths sit heavy on his shoulders: Tony not only can but needs to suffer. He deserves it. Doesn't he deserve to be brilliant?
"What about her?" Tony plays dumb. Whatever happened to Hill happened recently enough that Dugan just got wind of it.
If these are his last rites, he can think of worse ways to go. At least he gets to talk with Steve; he can't think of anything better than talking with Steve. Steve won't go away no matter how many ways Tony's tried to drive him out. He won't leave Tony alone, because Tony doesn't really want to be left alone. If the only way he can have Steve is to let his mind be haunted, then he'll throw open the doors and invite the specter in.
The part of his brain still processing information in a productive way skitters ahead impatiently. REM sleep isn't the end goal or even a useful byproduct; there are worse nightmares waiting.
Hill buys it. Maybe she thinks he's selfish; maybe she only thinks he's unable to see past his own point-of-view. That's fine. He doesn't assume that all superhumans are as divided or as cowardly as Tony is without supervision, but even
He can smell the whisky so strongly that the taste lingers on his tongue. He's still propped against the cabinets; his legs won't support him.
"If you weren't so focused on getting your own way, you'd have thought through the consequences of putting the names of every single costumed hero in one place. It's shortsighted. It's dangerous, Stark "—every part of Tony throbs in time with the driving beat of his pulse through the bruised flesh of his side—"when you better than anyone know how easy it is to steal that information."
He waits there in the hallway for a moment, caught in the doorway, but Steve isn't waiting inside, so he enters, goes to Steve's desk, ignores Steve's sketches, and removes the print hanging on the wall. There's a small safe hidden behind it, and since Steve never came back here after launching his little revolution-and-rebellion act, Tony probably still knows the passcode. Six hours ago he'd have been able to trigger the electronic lock to open with merely a touch, but now—
"You'll live," Stevie says dryly, and she returns Tony's hand to her with the sort of tenderness that could undo someone who holds their secrets less dear. Those clear blue eyes of hers flick up to meet Tony's, and she says, with the genuine sincerity only Captain America can pull off, "I'm sorry."
Everything outside of Tony's skull goes still. Blurred around the edges—not quite faded, but not quite real.
"The cornfield kidnappings? Is that what they're calling them?" Tony says, and then, "Of course it's occurred to me."
This morning, Senator John Boynton woke promptly at five, spent thirty minutes cycling in his home gym while catching up on the morning's headlines, showered, kissed his wife, and left for work, where he attended his general staff meeting, spoke with two constituents about their concerns over immigration policy, called CNBC News to discuss a recent meeting of the Commission on Superhuman Activities, and sat for the day's Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearings. This afternoon, he watched as SHIELD Director Tony Stark took the oath of office that made his temporary promotion in light of former director Maria Hill's abdication permanent. A few hours later, at the reception following Stark's swearing-in, Senator Boynton was led from the Willard InterContinental Hotel in handcuffs.
Friday's wearing a long red cloak and a pointed hat spangled with stars—a world away from Tony's bathrobe. When her projection hops up on the worktable beside him and crosses her legs, her cloak falls open to reveal a sleek dress that's more
He goes with scotch, neat, in a rocks glass although he neglects to add the ice. Why water down good scotch? Dad drank it straight. Tony drinks it straight. Mom was always more into bourbon or gin. He opens the bottle of scotch and pours it into a crystal rocks glass; the crystal is clear, sharp, beautiful, the scotch is gold, sharp, smooth. It's the smell that gets to him. Talisker 18, from the Isle of Skye—he had his first glass of it on his fifteenth birthday, and the smell takes him smack back to that age, when he never slept and ran on fumes and ideas for bettering the world. The truth is that it doesn't matter that he's drinking decent scotch. He'd drink boxed wine. He'd drink Everclear. He wouldn't water it down. Stark men don't.
One evening in late fall they'd been listening to Leonard Cohen while waiting for some cider to heat, and Steve had stopped with his head cocked to listen. "Oh," he'd said, and Tony had understood and felt echoed in his bones the familiarity of it. The lyric stayed with him:
Steve yanks back his cowl. He's embarrassed, maybe—Tony would be—or just frustrated. Angry. Furious. Maybe Tony isn't angry himself; maybe he's just mirroring the rising red tide in Steve. HIs blonde hair sticks up in a sweaty cowlick that does nothing to detract from that cold light of judgment in his blue, blue eyes. There's always been something terrible about Steve's wrath, something Old Testament, inexorable and unalterable, a righteous red tide that breaks across the sky like a rolling bank of stormclouds. It makes him impossible to argue with, but Tony has always been the unstoppable force to Steve's immovable object. They can each only act according to their natures.
"Show me only NREM sleep," Tony says. "Erase any signal that isn't strong enough to penetrate the garage." Closer. "Slow-wave sleep only."
United France Airliner 39 crashed in a field twelve miles outside of Dijon, France at 8:30 Tuesday evening. 70 passengers and three crew, including the pilot and co-pilot, died on impact. Nine survive, six in critical care.
Yasin Renada, a multinational arms dealer and number eight on the FBI's most wanted list, was discovered dead in a private Swiss chalet on Wednesday afternoon. Swiss authorities have confirmed that Renada was murdered. According to the autopsy report, the cause of death was a friction burn consistent with a high-energy weapon.
Tony met Happy when Happy pulled him from the wreckage of a burning car. That one incident set the precedent for their relationship; Tony abuses Happy's good nature, and Happy pays Tony back by pulling him out of burning wrecks. Tony's something of a magnet for burning wrecks. He makes them himself, by hand, out of good will and the best intentions. Happy, on the other hand, was probably meant to be a firefighter before his life was derailed by a grateful rich man offering him a job. The pretty dame—that was how Happy always referred to Pepper within her hearing, 'dame' or 'doll' because it made her laugh although she wouldn't have tolerated it from anyone else—completed the derailment. Happy wasn't going to be a boxer, retired or otherwise, and he wasn't going to be a firefighter. Happy worked for Tony Stark in whatever capacity Mr. Stark desired.
Pepper moves to a different state. He didn't expect anything else. The Richardses reunite and go off to do whatever it is Richardses do. Rhodey stops calling. He called and he called and he called, left all these messages that Iron Man plays back inside his head—
Reed says, "I was truly sorry to hear about Mister Hogan." Reed's a brilliant guy. He understands all kinds of things that nobody else does, concepts that even Tony struggles to wrap his head around; Tony
"I found workarounds for the massive energy consumption, for one thing." Tony reaches up and lays his palm flat against the glass case. "All of the newer suits have stealth features. What's the point of an outfit you can only wear one place? Emissions-absorbent coating, dampening, visible-spectrum cloaking—"
Wishing on stars never solved anything, though; it's one more useless tendency he can shed or alter or excise. He prefers the term
They went their separate ways eventually—Maya to coax and bully funding out of the military and the corporate world, and Tony to take the throne that had been awarded to him at birth. Tony built a better suit. Maya punched biology in the face until she built a better super-soldier. And then…
"Having a nap." Tony waves a hand in a polished crescendo of nimiety. "I'm thinking of making afternoon naps a company policy."
Tony drops through a hole in the floor of the quinjet hangar and lands two floors below in the dining room. There's a blue oval that resolves itself into the top of Steve's head as Tony's trajectory curves downward. Steve's in full battle dress, shield and cowl, waiting with his eyes trained on the sky.
Now that he's let himself look, he can't stop looking. It's been months, it feels like years, his mind can't stop superimposing that last final shot of Steve's slack, pale face over his flushed cheeks and wheat-fine eyelashes now. Even the cruel twist of a mouth made more generous by familiarity is stunning. Tony never thinks about taking Steve apart, about disassembling him into his component parts for study; Tony wants Steve as he is, whole and entire.
It's a good question. She's asking a good question. Friday likes to stick her nose into things; Tony encourages it as much as he can, because he still thinks curiosity is one of the better personality traits out there even if on a local level it usually ends up being one of his great moral failings. Friday's curiosity, though, that's good—he didn't build that into her, or at least not to the degree of intensity she displays. Someday that curiosity might conclude with her nose getting bitten off, but if there's a better teacher than pain, Tony has yet to invent it.
Mr. Grey is a white man standing 5'9" with silvering hair. He has glasses and at the time of his disappearance was wearing blue jeans and a Sioux Falls Cougars t-shirt. Mr. Grey also has a large birthmark on his right arm.
The edge of the shield cracks into his forearm. The armor fractures. So does the bone beneath it. He'll have to come up with a fix for that.
He retains nothing of sentimentality, not even sentiment itself: This is Tony 3.0, no longer a person, more than a human, superior in all ways. This is a perfect set of algorithms housed in a gleaming shell. This is Iron Man, beatified, who is everything that Tony is not. The Iron Man does not sleep, does not require food, does not waste resources building castles in the air. It is only Tony, an imperfect accident of flesh and blood, who still dreams.
"All right, Mr. Stark," she says, which means she doesn't agree with him but that she is, for the moment, willing to go along with him.
When Maya lets go of the back of his head, he drops to the floor like a meteorite drops to the Earth: hard, fast, with commitment and feeling. He lives here now. Might as well get used to it.
"Have I ever told you how I solved War Machine's ammunition problem?" Tony says. "It's elegant. A little simplistic, maybe, but if I patented it and found the right buyer, I could live off the returns for the rest of my life." Not, understand, that Tony needs money; Tony is a rich man's rich kid, and he wants for nothing. "It'd mean funding for a hundred special projects. Private prisons are all the rage these days—"
Ralston's old-school. He's not a fan of the SRA, voted against it, has been a vocal critic—but the law is the law. Ralston respects the law. He's here to make sure no one abuses it.
He doesn't have all the pieces, but he can bridge the gaps—projection is one of Tony's greatest gifts. Extremis restructured his brain so it works independently of his consciousness; his mind automatically connects to hundreds of wireless access points in the course of a day, upload and download, seamlessly converting brainwaves into digital signals. Yinsen's son had figured out first how to write code for Tony's brain—that was where Maya came in—and then how to install that malware without him noticing. After that, it would've been a matter of configuring the signal to trigger the malware to work on a time-delay and then sending that trigger through a trusted source like one of SI's satellites.
, even if Rhodey himself has reservations. He's a good guy. A great guy. One of the best guys Tony knows.
He pares away the muscle next. It's meat, it's just raw matter from a bygone era, the kind of thing that should've been discarded alongside coal furnaces and cylinder phonographs. Messy wet wanting goes with it, all those impulses he can't control, all those feelings he can't control, all those desires he can't control.
. It's what he does. He makes it hurt. If anyone survives, it's down to Tony's least favorite intervention: pure, dumb luck.
"Boss," Friday whispers in his ear. "Incoming call for you. It's Timothy Dugan. Private channel." Which makes it the sort of call that Tony previously would have taken in his office, later would have taken in his armor with the external speakers turned off. Now he doesn't bother. Now his brain receives the signal, decrypts it, passes back an audible response without Tony ever having to move his lips. Why waste time translating speech into signal when you can manufacture the signal and skip the first step?
"My mark?" Stevie flips the kettle off before it's finished, as impatient as ever, and starts to pour. "Mirrors exist for a reason," she says, wryly. "And no, not really. I like to think she's always right there, just behind my shoulder. Watching my back." She laughs a little. "Guess that's silly."
"Tony, I know you're in there," Steve says. He's breathing hard, a hand pressed to the opposite shoulder, the one Iron Man had grasped to throw him. "I know you don't want to do this."
He's being very calm about this. Very rational. It's that, or he curls up in a corner and drinks himself to death. The idea isn't without appeal, but he didn't make it this far by allowing what he wants to do get in the way of what needs to be done.
To return to a favorite example: look at Captain America and Iron Man. While Cap's enhancement procedure means he is technically classified as a metahuman, Dr. Erskine's notes on the process (at least the parts that aren't redacted) indicate that the super-soldier serum only raised Steve Rogers's abilities to the peak of human potential, not past it. Actually, there's an argument to be made that Rogers's skill at martial arts and not the serum itself is what actually qualifies him for the metahuman label. If you need a moment of silence to contemplate a man who through practice and willpower alone can make himself capable of fighting alongside a god, feel free to take it.
DAEDALUS: But when the work you're doing is groundbreaking on a global scale… Every year we're delayed means more lives lost to natural causes.
He's late to the meeting. He knows because Carol tells him. Cause and effect in a nice little chain—why can't everything be so efficient?
ROGERS: You have to make a study of him. A series of studies, like a series of sketches, and no matter how many times you draw him, you always discover something new.
Green Thumb, afaik he mostly stuck to scaring teenagers who tried to vandalize the community garden. he probably didn't need to register but he did anyway.
Tony had been designing handguns long before he'd ever shot them, but men knew how to shoot and Starks knew how to shoot
Tony knows he and Steve don't always agree; they think too differently for that, but there's something about having a shared unity of purpose that lends an empathy even greater than similarity. "Maybe," Tony says. "But there's no point in seeing the future when you can't take that knowledge back with you."
He knows better now, of course. He could fuck men. He has fucked men. Tony Stark is shameless. Tony Stark even fell in love with a man. It's good. It's fine. He won't have those qualities much longer, but their removal is incidental, a consequence of extracting dopamine and oxytocin from the messy soup of his brain.
This is a new iteration of the team. After… what happened last fall, letting the team fall apart had been more an inevitability than a choice. Steve had been the one to come to him, to tell him that the world needed the Avengers, and Tony had agreed, because the secret is that Tony will always need the Avengers just as much as the world, has always needed the Avengers more than the Avengers need him. Any effort he makes to keep his distance is marked to fail before it starts.
He leaves as soon as Pepper does and books it straight to the helicarrier. There are no more What Ifs while he flies; instead, Iron Man addresses What Is. He records a voiceover for a short documentary on Camp Hammond, he hires two new vice presidents for Stark Industries, he replies to a message from one of the Stamford widowers, and he designs a new and better skin for himself. The flight takes three minutes. Danvers and Hill are waiting when he lands.
He's clearly there with his team responding to the distress signal just like Tony and the rest of the sanctioned Avengers. Of course he is; Steve's a hero. An idiot, but a hero. He's clearly there to help the guy behind him, the guy in a standard-issue worksuit with fire licking up his leg. Tony can't actually smell the odor of cooking flesh through his suit's atmosphere, but it's there in his nose and mouth nonetheless.
And, you know, what he wants and what he deserves have always been the same thing. At the root, that's the problem. He just wants it all to be over.
The garage is hardened against EM weapons, has redundancies on top of redundancies, and is protected by security measures so cutting edge the military can't touch them. The express elevator and the freight elevator both pass a series of checkpoints that involve everything from biometric scans to limited cybernetic verification. Friday monitors the entire complex around the clock in real time, and Tony can count on one hand the number of people who are allowed access without case-by-case permission from Tony himself. Hell, outside of the Avengers and a few trusted Stark Industries employees, very few people even know this workshop
