Castiel hums around his mouthful, then slowly pulls off to leave a line of small kisses back down the panties until he can suck in the pliant sac, one firm orb at a time. Dean squirms under him, spreading his legs further apart and tilting his hips up into Castiel’s touch.
“ I guess that’s the real question.” Castiel mumbles, deep in thought. “ She’s bold, unafraid. She might think she’s helping him.”
That should not make Castiel blush, but he can feel the light tingling of heat creeping across his cheeks. He hopes he can blame it on the lingering summer heat, despite the air conditioning being on full blast.
“ Just keep swimming!” Claire answers with a happy shriek. “ Does it really say that?” She leans as far over the table as she can without falling out of her chair,  squinting at the small print on his skin.
“ No. In fact he was pretty adamant that he wanted it, he just… couldn’t.” Dean shrugs and pokes at the food in his bowl. “ And I understand. I’m not a complete dick. He’s got more important things to deal with instead of wasting time with me.”
It’s quiet, comfortably so. Soft and easy. Castiel gently wipes away the quickly drying fluid, bending down to place small kisses on the clean skin. The wipe goes into the trash and Castiel grudgingly rolls out of bed to find clean clothing for them both. “ I can’t guarantee we’ll wake up alone.” He hands a pair of soft cotton pajama pants to Dean and pulls on a pair of flannel ones himself; both varying shades of gray.  He hesitates over his t-shirt drawer. The thought of sleeping shirtless with Dean is enticing, but the probability of having to deal with Jack at some point before morning has him choosing a washed thin tee. This one is covered in a green and black whirlpool design, a souvenir from a cross country road trip with Gabriel years ago.
A few minutes later, they step outside into the warm darkness, feet crunching over the loose gravel near the stoop before crossing over onto the paved portion of the drive.  Meg’s little burgundy Hyundai is parked at the bottom and Castiel had eyed it seriously through the window when she pulled up, judging the remaining amount of space in the wide driveway and finally deeming it enough for the Impala to get by with safe margins.
But Dean is suddenly at a loss. This is really too fast, isn’t it? But is it? They’ve been dancing around each other for months, as Cain has pointed out so bluntly. But it feels too early to fall into bed together and whoa why is he thinking about that when he doesn’t even know how Cas feels about it and his own half erection is more about being warm and happy than properly horny and maybe he should just--
“ It was amazing! If the regulars hadn’t brought their own gear, I wouldn’t have had enough to pass around.” Charlie’s face is practically beaming, smile bright, eyes wide. Her enthusiasm is very contagious. “ I mean, a few always fall off as we go on, but we had nearly thirty kids today, so even if half drop off to do school activities, we’ll still have a nice size club. And if any of them want to join Moondoor then they have enough to form their own clan if they want.”
The obvious answer is that it refers to Collette. After all, there are quite a few memorials to Cain’s deceased wife in his work. But if that’s the case, Dean finds it odd that Cain would choose this particular candle to gift him every time. Like shoving the ghost of his dead wife in Dean’s face. Very much not like Cain.
True to her word, Claire is sitting on the couch with a book from the bedtime basket in her lap. She looks up when Castiel comes into the room and puts it back. “ I hope our neighbor is nice.” Claire again heads toward the bathroom.
Dean laughs as she shoves a straw into her mouth and turns to lead him further into the hospital room. “ Told ya. I’ve got all the looks, charm, and sweet goodies.”
Castiel squashes down the immediate rush of blood to certain extremities as he interprets the double entendre. Lord God in Heaven, this man! Well, that deserves an equally suggestive response. He arranges his face into its usual neutral expression, tightens his hold on his partner, and dips Dean with a savage confidence.
“ Not a problem. You’ve done so much for us.” Castiel smiles back, watching Cain open the back door and step out onto the porch. They exchange goodnights and Castiel locks back up; knob, deadbolt one and dead bolt two. Then a quick moment at the punchpad near the door jamb, security code entered and alarm system set. He’ll double check all the other locks in the house before he retires, each window and door, even though the kitchen door is the only portal in the entire house that is used, every other point of entry locked tight and left alone.
He sighs and pushes between them, breaking it up. “ You two are incorrigible.” There’s no way Meg can see a blush on his face, even in the security lights. But, dammit, she knows him so well.
“ Beautiful, ain’t she?” Dean is practically beaming with pride. “ ‘67 Chevy Impala, Tuxedo Black. A 327 V8 and a 4 barrel carburetor; was a bitch trying to find original parts for replacements. My dad bought her in ‘73 and I got her on my eighteenth birthday. Never even owned another car.”
“ You certainly know how to make a gal feel special, “ Meg chuckles quietly. “ So, what are you thinking?” No jokes this time, she’s taking him seriously.
“ I know. It’s okay.” And it is, because Dean totally understands where Sam is coming from. They’ve been hiding their crappy homelife for so long it’s just become second nature. No point in dragging anyone else into their family mess, after all. “ Call me when your plane lands, okay?”
“ Uh, thank you.” Castiel stumbles over the unexpected compliment. From Dean it had made him feel warm and safe, from this stranger he feels decidedly creepy, but he remains polite.
“ That’s right. Thank you for reminding me, Claire.” Castiel smiles, dividing his daughter’s long hair down the middle of her head and beginning a set of good old fashioned twin braids. “ We can practice Viking Warrior Braids next weekend when we have more time. “  He glances at the clock on the mantle. They have another twenty minutes before they are expected at Dean’s. Another ten before the oven timer goes off for the brownies. He can already smell the faint scent of burning charcoal, Dean apparently getting the grill ready for their dinner.
But he doesn’t exactly want to be alone either. Because being alone means sitting in his underwear on the couch, watching reruns of
Dean bites down his laughter at Jack’s pronunciations. Instead, he ruffles the boy’s hair. “ I look forward to trying some of his leftovers today.” Jack is looking very intently at Dean’s phone again and Dean asks, “ You want to see more pictures?”
Gabe is standing behind the closed tempered glass door, phone in hand. Goofy grin spread across his face.
Dean would ponder this mystery female visitor and the twinge of unhappiness in his gut at the mention of her, but suddenly, Jack goes limp, sandbagging, and huffs out, “ ‘Tay.”
Castiel can feel the blood in his veins turning to ice, a cold numbing fear sweeping over his body at the sound of Nicholas Adler’s voice. Calling Jack’s name. Calling himself
He makes an actual choked sound in the back of his throat, loud enough for Aaron to look up in concern. “ You okay? Go down the wrong pipe?”
Jack is warm and dry and just a little sleepy and he loves Daddy and he loves Dean and they don’t even get mad at him when he toots under the blankets.
Cas exhales slowly and shakes his head. “ No. It’s okay.” He shifts slightly in the seat, sitting up, Dean leaning back to give him more room. Blue eyes look up through dark lashes, pleading. “ May I?” He rests his hands on Dean’s hips, fingers playing with the shirt hem.
Castiel turns back to Gabriel, warm smile mirroring the older man’s. “ Merry Christmas to you, too, big brother.”
“ So I phoned in the antibiotic prescription to the pharmacy you have on file and they should have them ready within an hour. Basic amoxicillin, a seven day supply to make sure we get rid of it for good. Lots of fluids and rest. He’ll be good as new in no time.” Dean turns back around (slowly this time, extra cautious of where Castiel is in the room).
They take the back way, again, passing by the Novak-Kline kitchen windows where Gabriel is, again, filming them through the blinds. Castiel flips him off right before they turn the corner under the carport. He can already smell the lovely scents of fresh coffee and bacon.
“ You and Dean, you dope.” Charlie rolls her eyes, her whole body moving with it, and pats her knees in emphasis. “ Give me the deets. I rewatched your little episode on the cameras Halloween night and you two were totally adorable!”
Castiel realizes his hands are clenched into fists at his side only when Cain puts the flame colored abomination back into the box and places a hand on his elbow. Squeezing gently. Castiel releases the air held hostage in his tightened chest and forces his hands to relax, shoving them into the pockets of his trench coat to fiddle with the loose threads on the inner seams. He begins twisting one around the tip of his index finger.
Dean and he doesn’t know what to do about it. Even without the added complication of their past encounter, Castiel knows he would still be having problems with this situation.
Claire nods and Cain chuckles. “ I’ll keep that in mind when I’m trimming the hedges tomorrow. And I’ll talk to my friend, but I don’t think you’ll have to abandon your stronghold.”
So, Castiel swallows down a chuckle, keeps his body language open and nonjudgmental, and resists the urge to fall into excited lecture mode.  “ Yes, there is such a term as hyperromantic. In fact--” A staticky cough erupts from the walkie talkie in Castiel’s back pocket. Castiel jerks, instantly berating himself for leaving the children alone for so long. He’d honestly forgotten, for a few moments. Totally unacceptable. “ I’m so sorry, Dean, I have to check on Claire and Jack.”
“ Don’t get too attached, little man. It’s coming off when Jess has the baby. It’s just a pregnancy beard.” Dean leans into the touch though, allowing Jack total access to his whiskers; including rubbing his chin against the grain on Dean’s cheek.
Dean motions for the pizza box in Jess’ lap and the woman hands it over after taking another cheese stick for herself. Dean takes the last slice of Meat Lovers and shoves half into his mouth before biting it off. He’s beat; physically, mentally, emotionally.
That’s okay. His pajamas are clean so he pulls them back on but the zipper is too hard so he just does the sticky tab at the top under his chin. His belly is poking out but that’s okay. He has a cute belly. Daddy says so. Dean likes his belly, too. Claire might like his belly. Jack will have to ask her when she wakes up. He jumps up to turn off the bathroom light but it’s too dark so he jumps up again to turn it back on. Then he closes the door almost
“ Otherwise, just ask your Dad to give me a call, alright?” Dean leans around Cas and places the Tile on the window sill. “ We’ll leave it right there, where you can reach it.” When he settles back on his heels he finds two varying expressions of gratitude from the Novaks: Claire’s open and practically awed, Cas’ softer and accompanied by the sweetest smile Dean’s ever seen. He doesn’t have long to appreciate it because Claire’s wild hair is suddenly filling his vision, her little arms nearly strangling him around the neck as she hugs him.
This must be the compromise Cas had been talking about. A picture of Nicholas Adler that Jack calls father even though he doesn’t really understand the distinction. Not at the moment, anyway. To Jack, it’s just the last picture in the book. But to Claire…
Conversation halts again as everyone’s gaze lands on the partially exposed tattoo on Dean’s left upper arm. Castiel remembers seeing the ink before at the pediatrics office, but he hadn’t had long enough or a close enough look to identify any details.  He watches with intense curiosity as Dean pushes the sleeve up to his shoulder with the opposite hand.
That never really occurred to Dean before, and by god it should have. “ Did… did you know that Sam was my brother?” Cain had to have seen Sam with Jess before, lugging around the rolling cart and drooling over jarred granola.
. And Saturday morning Gabriel makes the most amazing cinnamon rolls and bacon cheddar biscuits Castiel has ever tasted. His brother loads Castiel down with leftovers and sends them home before noon so he can spend time with Kali. They are currently
over his collared button up and under his usual trench coat. Cas wearing a pair of Claire’s purple sparkly dress-up wings over the trenchcoat. Cas wearing a bee antennae headband that bobs gently with every motion.
Castiel should avert his gaze. Seriously he just met Dean today (no matter what his faulty brain has been trying to tell him), and shouldn’t be gawking over his toddler’s head at the smooth expanse of freckled skin, faint marks of a farmer’s tan on his upper arms and circling his neck. The slightest little pudge at his midsection that makes Castiel want to poke it with his finger before sucking a mark and what in the name of all that’s holy is he doing?! So caught up in his inappropriate lusty thoughts, he nearly misses the darks line and blotches of color on Dean’s pale skin.
Castiel takes pity on her, despite his own problems, and shakes his head reassuringly. “ You were, what I think they call,
Dean watches him walk away as he takes off his outer gear and stores it properly. He’s already trying to remember what t-shirts and lounge pants he has clean in his dresser drawers. Nothing as cute as what Cas has on, but there has to be something without too many holes.
Dean is already falling apart. He’s fucking shaking at Cas’ husky voice, his confident tone, his intimate description. The last flicker of fear is torched by lust and affection flaring through his body, lighting him up like a damn candle. Dean has an immediate image of the pink sparkling candle from his tart and he chokes on a giggle.
Dean is still giggling over the emoticon in Cas’ last text when he hears a soft knock on his kitchen door before the light scratch and squeak of it opening. He calls out, “ In here!”, from the couch and tilts the bottle higher for Alex to easily suck down the last few drops. For a moment, Dean had been afraid that Alex was about to settle into another ten minute post bottle cat-nap, throwing off his entire sleep schedule, but the burping process has fully awakened him and those bright eyes are wide and searching for the source of the soft shuffling of feet.
It’s been five years, and not much has changed about Cain Adamson. There’s more silver in the salt and pepper hair that is much longer than when Dean last saw him, the beard a bit fuller. A deepening of the crows feet around the still bright blue eyes. God, Dean really does have a type.
He sits in front of it now and sends a text to Ambriel, asking after Jack. The antibiotics and Tylenol seemed to be doing their job for the week, but Castiel likes to check in when the kids aren’t one hundred percent.
Dean speeds up the last couple yards and slams on the brakes, just to hear Claire scream out, “ Heck yeah!”
“ Yes, Cassie, it will fit in your land yacht.” Gabriel sets his glass down and picks up the bag of shiny colored premade bows. He is not the world’s neatest gift wrapper, but more than makes up for it with copious amounts of ribbons and bows. He presses two red plaid ones on the top of the finished present in his lap, one on each end of the oblong shape, and sets it under the tree with the rest of Jack’s similarly wrapped gifts. Claire’s are on the other side of the tree, in complementary red and silver star paper. The adults’ are nearly lost in the middle. “ I actually measured the trunk when you were here Thanksgiving weekend.”
“ We were.” Castiel confirms, releasing the children and nudging them forward with his knees in order to get into the house and out of the cold.  He watches as Claire greets Dean with her customary fist bump and Jack demands his hug. Dean returns each with his usual enthusiasm, and an extra layer of affection. After the fist bump, Dean gently ruffles Claire’s outrageously disheveled hair. He snuggles Jack a bit longer, speaking quietly to him, Jack nodding solemnly.
Dean’s costume is his old Spengler coverall with Holtzman’s name velcroed in place and two mismatched water pistols attached to his cardboard proton pack. A pair of quidditch goggles, with duct tape and random magnifying glasses attached, tops it all off. He’s always had a thing for brainy characters.
“ Of course. He’ll be happy to hear it.” Castiel squeezes her hand and the smile on his face doesn’t feel quite so forced.
Dean chokes on his swallow, laughter and drops of beer sputtering through his fingers. Castiel doesn’t mean to, but he finds himself grinning at the younger man’s uncontrolled amusement. “ Did I say something funny?”  Surely he hadn’t mischaracterized this Uncle Bobby, not after all he’s heard about him from Dean and Sam.
Cas practically falls over himself getting to the trash can, sweeping it to him in one smooth motion and holding it up to replace Dean’s shirt. Dean strategically steps away and, gathering the hem of his shirt to contain the acidic liquid, bends forward and uses his other hand to grab the back of his scrub and pull it forward over his head. A white t-shirt is under the soiled scrub, but Castiel catches a flash of skin and waistband before the soft cotton falls back into place. Now Dean is holding a scrub shirt full of Jack’s puke and Castiel’s brain kicks back into gear, sending the proper responses to his mouth. “ Dean, I am so sorry! ”
Castiel feels his stomach churn a bit, then he swallows it down with exasperation and an eye roll. Nipping this misunderstanding right in the bud.“ Dean, this is my good friend, Meg. We went to University of Illinois together.”  He makes the appropriate hand gestures between the introductions. “ She’s helped me out a great deal since moving here.”
He sets his phone down and removes his earbuds, intent on being productive even if he’s not quite feeling it today. He hasn’t checked his work email since this morning and decides it will be a good way to pass a few minutes. The program slowly comes to life on his computer, allowing him to enter his username and password after several stalled attempts.
So enamoured by the image, Castiel almost forgets the actual text message that has apparently been sent by Jess, unbeknownst to Dean. >>
Dean smiles, shaking his head. “ Not really my thing. I was only going because Sam said they had an open bar.” He offers Castiel a cookie. “ But you should take your own advice and go out for a night. Free booze, free gourmet food. Attractive people dressed all fancy.”
Dean watches as Cas startles, running a hand through his hair and knocking the headband off. Dean jumps forward to catch it, horribly embarrassed by the desperate move. But he hands it over casually enough as Cas gets himself together. “ I-I promised I’d take them around the candy stations and Claire is obviously very excited to join Rowena’s storytime and I understand this is last minute, but I was wond--”
Dean can’t laugh too much at them; he’d had the same reaction the first time he’d driven over Tuesday. He watches as the gate slowly, but smoothly, slides open.  “ He just really likes his privacy.”
“ I mean, yeah, but it’s not call-me-in-the-middle-of-the-night odd.” There’s a soft rustle of papers, Meg maybe going through some of her files at her desk. “ So what’s this actually about? Is he like, offering himself up in gratitude? If he’s hot then I say take him up on it.”
The woman nods in agreement, but remains silent as she continues to open and close emails, seemingly at random. After a few moments, she pulls out her personal laptop and boots it up, connecting it to the work desktop. Then she selects a dozen emails and her fingers fly quickly over the laptop keys. The screen fills with pop-ups and text scrolling by at an alarming rate. It means nothing to Castiel, but Charlie obviously sees something noteworthy because she taps rapid fire for several seconds and everything suddenly comes to a halt. She points to the screen, eyes flicking over the information displayed. Mouth screwing up in disbelief. “ It’s coming from inside the house?”
He thinks of it now, as he eases Alex’s small body into the cupped seat. Careful of tiny fingers and loose fabric, Dean buckles and adjusts the five-point harness until it’s perfect and then covers the baby with the blankets, tucking in the edges.  “ There you go, big man. Snug as a bug in a rug.”  He checks the seatbelt anchoring the base one more time, then scoots out to let Sam have his place. Now that he can see Sam’s face, he can see why Jess was eager to kiss it off. Sam has that stupid fond smile and soft eyes look on. The one he learned from Dean but Dean’ll never admit it. “ What? Gassy?”
“ You still have to confirm that she’s been here for each email. In the meantime, let’s see what Google has to say about her.” He minimizes Karl-E and brings up the search engine, typing in the woman’s name and current city and state.
“ That is a rockin’ hairdo, buddy.” Dean smiles and scoops Jack up, much to the toddler’s giggling delight. He turns his bright white smile toward Claire to compliment her own neatly done braids, then brings his attention back up to Castiel who can’t stop staring at the freckles on Dean’s nose,  highlighted by the late afternoon sunlight.
Dean keeps his attention spread over the area, still wary of suspects possibly hiding nearby, as he ducks through the opening and grabs the handles of the bag, lifting it as carefully as he can over the spikes. It’s not heavy at all, which surprises him, and a familiar whiff of something hits his nose in the cold air. “ Smells like… a food court?” He frowns at Cain as he comes back around the gate, listening to it sliding back into place with a loud clang. “ Orange chicken and french fries.”
Where he finds everyone already seated at the table, scarf and crown safely placed on the counter. Claire, however, has opted to wear her sunglasses pushed to the top of her head where they tangle in her messy bun. It’s not a bad job on Gabriel’s part.
A heavy weight sinks into the pit of Dean’s stomach at the words. Fuck. Too much, too fast. “ Im sorry, Cas. I sh--”
Rowena clucks her tongue as they follow the children to the Teen Room, both adults greeting Aaron and Benjamina as they pass by the desk. Charlie has decorated the Teen Room with some of her simpler LARPing props and set pieces, creating a very convincing medieval atmosphere. She’s chosen to wear her royal garb, every bit a queen in her robe and crown. Claire demonstrates a bow and Jack follows suit though he looks puzzled by his sister’s actions. Charlie squeals, clapping, and basically divides the rest of her candy bowl into their two pumpkins as Claire asks her about the coat-of-arms on her shield and Jack curiously fingers the gold edging on her robe.
“ Can I have a lab for Christmas? Just a small one?” Claire questions as Castiel puts the book back into the basket next to the couch.
of the chorus. Alex sings a Halestorm song with wicked abandon and afterward keeps Stan company when he goes outside to vape away his addiction. Someone from another table does a dead on Billy Idol impersonation. A drunk girl from the bar barely keeps her footing as she giggles out an offkey
She hums quietly in thought, then tilts her head to rest in her hand, elbow propped on the couch back. “ Personally? I think that alone should be enough reason to go after him, but, that’s just my lowly opinion. Now,” Meg kicks him once again, back to grinning. “ I won’t say anything else about it. So instead I’m gonna tell you all about what Hannah and I got up to last weekend in our dungeon.”
Meg laughs. “ Alright, old man. It’s time for me to meet Hannah at the club, anyway. I’ll let you get your tired old bones to bed.”
“ Together,” Dean agrees, his hand coming to rest on Castiel’s back between his shoulder blades. Holding him close.
But then Cas is breaking free of Dean’s embrace. A moment of pure panicked despair. Until Cas opens his arms, opens the afghan, and throws them around Dean’s neck, wrapping them both in the thick warmth and pulling Dean into an even deeper kiss.
Castiel straightens up at Claire’s urgent whisper from the doorway, a glimpse showing she’s still dressed in today’s clothes. Three long strides and he’s in the hall, pressing down on the automatic panic response bubbling up in his chest. “ What’s wrong?”
Gabriel has also been bugging Castiel for a brotherly road trip. Castiel loves driving, and he loves his brother, but he doesn’t think he could handle being in such a confined space for such an extended period of time with Gabriel. Sharing a bedroom until Gabriel left for college had been a challenge in patience.
Christ, he’s getting hit in the heart too many times this week. Okay, Monday’s sudden crushing on Castiel Novak can't really compare to a three year serious relationship with Cain, but still, Dean would like to fall back into a peaceful, no entanglements headspace.
Castiel looks up to see Dean’s mouth open in a silent scream, eyes squeezed shut, before he slumps boneless onto the bed.
There’s another heavy pause and Castiel is about to jump in again, but Dean beats him to it. After a slightly shaky exhale, Dean nods and playfully tugs one of her curls. “ Almost as much as we both love you and Jack.”
Already nervous about Jack’s unidentified illness, Castiel had been even more anxious when the nurse at the front desk had told him that Dr. Moseley was completely booked and wouldn’t be able to see Jack today. The woman has been a balm to Castiel's frayed parental nerves since moving here and taking on full parenting responsibilities. And as much as he trusts the other practitioners, there’s just something so reassuring about Dr. Moseley’s presence that Castiel had felt in dire need of this morning.
And then, overnight, he became the single parent of two. Castiel’s libido took a nosedive due to stress and lack of privacy and he honestly hadn’t missed it much.
She doesn’t resist and Dean heads on down the hall into the kitchen, where Sam is making breakfast. The younger Winchester looks up from the frying pan when Dean enters the room. “  Usual three eggs?”
Castiel is on his way to a conference at the University of South Dakota in Vermillion, where he is speaking on research in religious studies. It’s not exactly prestigious, but it is one of the more prominent colleges in South Dakota and it’s literally next door, so he didn’t feel right refusing, even if it meant travelling over a holiday weekend. Gabriel had wanted him to come out to Alto Paolo to visit, but it’s such a short holiday Castiel hadn’t felt it worth the airfare. He’d promised his brother a longer stay over the summer and Gabriel had been mollified for the time being.
“ Huh,” Dean huffs lightly, staring at the nostalgic cover. He remembers his mother and sometimes his father reading this very title to him, before and after Sammy was born. It was pure luck that a few of their books and toys had been kept in the Impala when the fire destroyed their home. Dean had wanted to cry just as hard as Sammy when they realized they’d accidentally left their beloved books in a cheap roadside motel two states away. He strokes his fingers over the cover.
Oh yes, there it is. “ With all due respect sir,” Castiel begins evenly. “ Rowena is perfectly within her right to take scheduled leaves using the paid vacation time she’s
Charlie is right where she was an hour ago, sitting in an extra chair pulled up between Dorothy and Benjamina behind the desk. So engrossed in her conversation with Dorothy, she doesn’t look up at Castiel’s appearance. But Benjamina does, with a friendly eye roll toward the other two women.“ Hey, Castiel?”
After a few more reassurances from Cain and a resigned acceptance from Castiel, the younger man gets back in the car, purposefully numb after the rush of strong emotions. A bag of red and green colored honey candy sits on the passenger seat, Cain’s quasi-fabricated excuse for seeing him. Castiel barely remembers the drive back to the house and only snaps out of it when he sees Dean’s broad figure in the open doorway, washed out in the bright lights. Waiting for him.
“ Knock, knock! Everyone decent?” Dean taps the bottom of the closed door with his foot, his hands and arms fully occupied.
It’s perfectly lovely, but Castiel wants more. Or at least to get them back to where they were pre-nightmare. He straddles Dean’s lap, legs folding on the mattress on either side of the younger man’s thighs, and places Dean’s hands on the bottom hem of his sweatshirt. A questioning look, a small nod of approval. In his fearful haste, Castiel had deprived Dean of undressing him earlier, but he intends on making up for that now. He leans back just enough to give Dean room to slowly slide the thick material up his torso, assisting with the process by holding the folds up as Dean tenderly explores his newly bared skin.
Castiel swallows down a little rush of guilt. “ He did, once. In September, not long after he moved in.”
Cain laughs at that, fingers curling around his empty cup. “ She is eating for two. It may be indelicate of me to ask, but when is she due? I have a few things at the house that she may find useful once the baby is here.”
Claire giggles and covers her mouth, though he can understand her clearly when she speaks. “ I used to say a very very bad word.”
He’s gonna get that bear!  So Jack grabs the blankets and climbs up onto the bed next to Daddy’s feet and the bear’s feet and crawls
Alexander Dean Winchester is born quarter past five in the morning, November 1st.  Dean literally sobs in Sam’s arms when Jess reveals the infant’s name. And for once he doesn’t deny it afterward.
Charlie pulls up Outlook and lets Castiel sign into his account. He opens the folder of menacing emails and moves away for Charlie to do her thing. He speaks quietly as she opens several emails and scans their contents. “ I didn’t think much of them at first, but they kept arriving even after I blocked the address. Then they came more often and then they were more specific to me. And today…” He reaches over to tap the screen over the most recent email.
“ Do I need to file the paperwork to officially ban you from the library? Or perhaps a restraining order?”
Castiel nods his approval of her teeth brushing and pulls out the chair between Cain and himself for her to hop onto. “ A new neighbor will be moving into the apartment.”
“ Honestly, I might let it grow back, but I’m enjoying the babyface for now.” Dean rubs his naked jawline, still marvelling at the lack of hair after so many months.
Fighting the urge to laugh outright, Castiel bites his bottom lip and watches the red splotch spread outward, a small dribble pulled down by gravity toward the older spots across his stomach leftover from their hurried breakfast. When he raises his gaze, Dean is still standing panic stricken across from him, popsicle nearly broken in half in his fist. Something inside him wants to bring the smile back to that handsome face so Castiel lets his own smile break free and makes an attempt at humor. “ It matches the ketchup stains from breakfast.” He reaches out for the intended treat, carefully folding his fingers around it once it lands in his palm. And if Dean’s thumb grazes the side of Castiel’s palm, well, Castiel is going to simply gloss over the little frisson of warmth. Though he will offer his gratitude properly.“ Thank you, so much. For the tissues, as well.”
Sam shoves past Dean and strides across the drive, hand already sticking out, broad smile beaming at the little family group. “ It’s been awhile. How are all of you?”
“ Get your wife into the front seat. I’ve got Little Dean.” Dean ignores his brother’s grumbling, all three returning Nurse Clif’s happy wave as he wheels away.
“ Awesome!” Dean is beaming now, hands pulled from his pockets to swing easily at his sides. “ So, uh, I’ll let you go check on the kiddos and I’ll see you Sunday.”
“ No, no.” Dean is quick to sit up, shaking his head in denial. “ Just really comfortable.”  He squeezes Castiel’s hand and lifts it to his mouth, pressing a firm smacking kiss on his knuckles. “ And your singing was practically hypnotizing.”
Jack does so with gusto and delight. Most items make it inside, but a few smaller things fall on the edge or miss entirely and fall to the floor. Jack
They bid farewell to Charlie and circle around through the periodicals and adult fiction. They skirt around Frank so as not to disturb his current mumbling rant about jack-o-lantern homicides. Jack forces a sudden and intense toddler monologue about beards onto Chuck who looks so uncomfortable under the boy’s scrutiny that Castiel takes pity on him and lures Jack away with a another library sticker.
“ Really,” Castiel repeats, following her across the room. He realizes where she’s headed and softly asks, “ Could we do this at your desk?”
“ Tissues it is. Be back, ASAP.” Dean backs out of the room, supplies in hand, and heads straight for his desk. He snatches the box of expensive ultra soft lotiony tissues and tucks it under his arm. Next stop, he drops off the swab and paperwork with Stan in the lab. He passes Alex in the hallway and hands over the tissues, asking her to drop them off at exam room three and completely ignoring her knowing expression. A quick check at the nurse’s station confirms he’s not needed anywhere else for the moment and Dean decides to go ahead and start on the antibiotics prescription; by the time the call gets through Stan should have the lab results. It’s timed perfectly, the tech hands over the results with a mouthed,
there. Strong arms around his shoulders, pulling him tight against Dean’s chest. A hand sliding up to cradle the back of his skull as Castiel buries his face in the crook of Dean’s neck. Warm breath in the hair above his ear. Castiel presses his nose into the soft flannel collar and fights the burn at the back of his throat. He lifts his arms and wraps them around Dean’s back, hands fisting in the loose shirt. Clinging.
There are over a hundred emails from the past eleven months, since the last time Castiel emptied his trash folder. Each one is something simple, only one or two lines, and implies an overfamiliarity with Castiel that has his nerves on edge. One or two could be considered a mistake. Managing to overcome the block could be considered a flaw in Outlook. But Castiel can no longer ignore this steady stream of messages growing more and more knowledgeable of his daily life.
The henley and tee are folded upwards, under his arms, cool air brushing across Dean’s chest and he bites his bottom lip as he feels his nipples tighten. Cas notices, of course, and leans in with an expression that promises nothing but trouble. A soft kiss to each dusky pebble, then a firm flat tongued lick that has Dean digging his fingers into the back of the older man’s shirt. He clamps his mouth shut, not trusting himself to make even the smallest of verbal encouragements without losing his shit. Strong arms circle around his waist, pulling him in tight, giving him no escape from the clever mouth now sucking and biting gently at each nipple in turn.
Again, there’s the tingling at the back of his skull that is just aching to place this man’s face with a concrete memory.
Dean takes that information in. “ You didn’t say anything to him?” Maybe this is a bit heavy to start off with. In a Starbucks. On a Sunday morning.
They reach the last photograph, a full 8x10 in a paper frame, very obviously child-crafted. It’s a close up of Amelia and Kelly, hugging each other tightly, laughing smiles on their faces. Below the paper frame, in the wide margin of the album page, is a simple sentence in silver Sharpie on the black paper, printed in all caps.
is finally over and Jack employs puppy eyes until Meg gives in and reads his bedtime selections. Castiel picks up around the house until Meg is finished, taking Jack for his bath while the woman listens to Claire read her own books aloud. Then it’s Claire’s turn in the bath and Castiel tries to drag the whole bedtime routine out in order to escape the inevitable talking-to he’s going to get from Meg. But, eventually, both children are clean, throw peace signs at their Aunt Meg, and are soon abed.  Now, Castiel has no excuse to keep him from flopping down on the opposite end of the couch from his best friend.
all day. And do some prep for when everyone else gets here.” Dean shrugs. He doesn’t seem upset by the situation, but Castiel wonders if that stoicism will hold up under an entire day of holiday cheer with no one to share it with. Until Dean continues with, “ I’ll probably skype Bobby and Ellen that day, text the others.”
When Dean had first visited his brother and sister-in-law here years ago, he’d been invited along and had been greatly impressed by the camaraderie between the clinic employees and the singing talent on display. Since moving to Tennessee and joining the Hunter Hollow Pediatric crew, he’s been to each karaoke night, happy to have a set date in his calendar for fun with his coworkers and friends. The little coincidence that the place has the same name as his Aunt Ellen’s bar back in Sioux Falls doesn’t hurt none either.
“ I want to avoid exactly what you’ve already mentioned.” He sighs, scrubbing a hand through his hair and over ihs face. “ Maybe not exactly that, I don’t think sex has any part to play in this, but… Meg, he has a tattoo of a handprint on his arm, where it bruised when I grabbed him. His brother says it’s from his guardian angel.” Despite the mild panic, the thought also sparks a tiny bloom of warmth in his chest. Because he is a horrible human being.
“ Again, untwist your panties. Just curious, is all.” Meg’s smirk is clear even over the line. “ Look, it’s your call. Tell him and get some thank you nookie, nookie which you so desperately need, by the way. Don’t tell him and let it drive you crazy every time you see him at the mailbox. I know which I’d choose.”
He breathes in the body heated scents that are familiar but much more potent in this small area of flesh; the clean musk of a warm body and a citrusy soap that isn’t overly sweet, and remnants of the earlier lotion. Castiel’s mouth waters at the heady fragrance and he lets the soft flesh drop from his mouth to place his tongue at the base of Dean’s cock and lick a long slow stripe up the underside, needing a taste.
Dean flips his blinker to turn onto the private road and he snickers at Jess and Sam’s oohs and aahs. A high chain link fence, partially covered in honeysuckle and backed by trees, edges the property and a high, very unpretty, but very sturdy,  electric gate bars the path. Dean pulls up to the utility box set into a crumbling stone post on the driver’s side and punches in his code.  An equally decrepit stone lion stares down at them, its twin across the way,  matching mouths open wide in toothless roars.
It’s timed out and Dean deactivates his lockscreen. The picture of him singing to Alex in front of the windows is still pulled up. Did Cas save a copy of this one for himself? The thought brings a heat to Dean’s cheeks and he coughs lightly to disrupt the stupid grin spread across his face. The kids haven’t moved and Dean eases back between them. He scrolls through his albums and pulls up the one dedicated to Alexander Dean Winchester or
The movement presses Cas’ hard-on against Dean and his own thoughts narrow down to the single need to touch.  “ Wanna see, Cas. Wanna feel you, please?”
They’d been just as cute waking up as they’d been asleep. Castiel had placed a pan of bacon and sausage links into the oven, started a pot of coffee, and peeked into the den to find Dean awake, eyes barely open, big hand smoothing over Jack’s back. Jack had wiggled his way up Dean’s chest, little arms around his neck, nose against his throat. Practically choking the man. And yet Dean was attempting to wake the boy gently, petting his back and whispering a soft chorus of,
Dean bucks up, involuntarily, at the light touch to his cock. Just a single point of pressure slowly massaging small circles over the raised line of silky material. “ I like pink, but-oh god, right there!- I, uh, I have other colors, too.”
Dean stares down at the item, certain he didn’t pick this out even at the height of his distraction, and wonders if maybe Cain added it as a gift. This idea is confirmed when Dean finds one of the familiar business cards taped to the bottom of the glass. He pulls it free and flips it over to find a message hastily written in Cain’s neat old lady scrawl.
There’s a chorus of positive replies from the back seat and Castiel heaves a sigh of relief. Puppy crisis averted.
guys can’t get it,” She adjusts something on the side of her laptop and rubs affectionately along the top of the monitor. “ Okay, sweetheart, just let me in.”
, a yoga series, and a mental health workshop led by his longtime friend, Meg Masters, a psych nurse at one of the major hospitals in Nashville. That research can also be done at the desk as long it remains predictably slow as Saturdays often are. Weekend patrons are more often there to either pick up their interlibrary loan holds or to set themselves up at one of the study tables for intense research.
“ Awesome! Promise, I’ll take real good care of it. ” Claire drops her pumpkin to the floor and fumbles her way into the overly large straps.
Meg’s tone is almost sympathetic when she asks,” Then what are you actually afraid of happening here?”
Well, he sorta wanted to do the stripping, but Dean isn’t going to complain now that he has all this beautiful bare skin in front of him. Tit for tat, Dean pulls off his own shirts and drops them on top of Cas’ sweatshirt crumpled on the cushion next to them. The little gasp from Cas turns Dean’s smile into a wicked grin. He playfully bites his lower lip and runs his hands slowly up and down his torso, hooded bedroom eyes turned on full blast. “ Like what you see?”
Just thinking about it now gets a tingle in the back of Dean’s throat and he swallows it down with another hefty bite of pizza. He’s ready to stop thinking for the night, but his brother has other plans.
He holds onto the big potty and steps off his stool. He very carefully puts the seat down. It doesn’t pinch his fingers. That means he did a good job!
He quickly squashes his knee jerk reaction to flip over and wrestle the suddenly solid phantom off him and put it into a chokehold. Because in the lightness of predawn and high-powered security lights streaming through the open blinds, Dean looks over his shoulder and recognizes the small- but inhumanly heavy- form of Jack clambering along his person. His heartbeat slows, his breath escaping in a long whoosh of relief. The fear from the nightmare, and startling awake, ebbs away with each of Jack’s irritated huffs.
And suddenly they’re back on the woman’s profile page but there’s a lot more visible. Including an album labeled
Dean listens with rapt attention, letting Claire guide him through the album. Jack occasionally interejects his own opinion, but he seems mostly content to just look and listen to his sister’s running commentary.  Sometimes Dean will ask a question or make a comment to get Claire to open up a bit more, or to smile when it seems like she’s getting a bit too down. That always seems to happen when they come across a photo that has obviously been cropped to exclude a person near Kelly.
Sam puts on Bitchface #6. “ I thought you were bringing Jess’ car.” He opens the back door, but Dean steals the baby and pushes Sam toward the curb where Nurse Clif is helping Jess stand from the wheelchair.
Dean leaves the bag from Cain’s table for last, eyeing it on the counter as he puts away his other purchases and begins pulling things from the kitchen shelves to make a blackberry cobbler.
“ No, the point is that you are a wonderful person and Castiel is a wonderful person and I believe you would both benefit from a relationship. With each other, in case I’m not making myself clear.”
But he wants more. And that scares Castiel almost as much as the thought of losing that potential something. He’s never wanted someone before, not like how he wants Dean.
And that reminds Castiel that they haven’t finished breakfast yet and he wouldn’t put it past Gabriel to send Jack after them in a moment to route them from the bedroom. He breaks the kiss slowly, shortening each motion until their lips merely touch and then the space between them increases with each breath. There’s still a responsive twitch in the front of his jeans but Castiel ignores it. Because the children are waiting and Gabriel is probably hatching a cunning plan and a quickie is not how Castiel wants to start a physical relationship with Dean.
Cas’ gaze can’t seem to decide where to look first, blue eyes flicking back and forth, up and down. “ Very much.”
Tom Petty begins his spiel about not backing down and Dean tightens his grip on the steering wheel. Stares at the rare sets of oncoming headlights on the other side of the interstate median.
Dean inhales, a big breath in through his nose, and lets it out slowly. Then he pulls his phone from his pocket and sends a text to the number on the back of the card.
Because he’s reasonably certain he just agreed to a family dinner with Dean Winchester;  pediatrics NP, switch, world class cook and his
Dean had happily explained when Castiel remarked upon its uniqueness. In fact, Castiel learned very quickly that the entire ensemble is from Sam and Jess’ wedding five years prior and Dean has simply had the good luck to have a classically styled suit that he hasn’t outgrown.
Jack dives back in without missing a beat, rolling the drum and peeling socks and washcloths from the sides. He cheers every time he is successful and twists around to hand his prize over to Dean. It doesn’t take long for the toddler to shout , “ Ah dun!,” and wiggle backwards.
“ You know, I think it’s more than that.” Charlie tilts her head in thought. “ Look at how her hand is on his arm. And they’re really close when they seriously don’t need to be.”
Mama. Their mothers. He’s seen a few framed photos around the house of the two women; sometimes together, always with one or both of the kids. Claire seems excited to show them off, proud even. Dean’s grin instantly softens into a gentle smile, his gaze as sincere as possible when he looks back at Claire. “ I’d be honored to see your special pictures,” he tells her without a hint of teasing.
Dean instantly clamps his mouth shut, but he’s obviously struggling not to give in to another laugh. His face is turning red from the strain.  S-sorry. Sorry,” he chokes out. Concerned, Jack begins patting the man’s back.
Sam eyes the nicer than average jeans, but doesn’t remark any further. He nods, floppy hair swinging over his eyes before he brushes it back behind his ears. “ ‘Kay, we’ll see you at lunch? About two?”
The moment of insanity is gone and everything comes rushing back. Castiel grins, leans forward and presses a loud smacking kiss against Dean’s forehead. “ Mwuah!” Claire and Jack are rolling. Castiel carefully pulls Dean back onto his feet as he leans back, “ Yes. Yes I am.” Oddly, his face isn’t burning off with embarrassment. He feels more irritated at having to stop than anything else. He’s so absorbed in his thoughts that he doesn’t realize Dean is still holding onto him until suddenly he lets go and the cool air chills the warm spots where the man was held against him.
) Dean and Sam pile into Cain’s truck, leaving Jess to rest with her feet up, and head to the Kroger half an hour down the road. Dean doesn’t want to keep Jess waiting too long, so he calls in a pick up order at the Papa John’s in the same stripmall and shops for groceries while he waits. Just the staples and a few things to throw together for a few dinners. He’ll do a full shopping spree next week when he’s more settled.
“ Shut up. It’s a dungeon whenever we don’t have guests.” Meg throws a pillow at him then launches into a sordid tale of whips and chains that makes Castiel cringe and chuckle in equal measure...
Dean has his best thinking face on, a mischievous glint in his eyes.“ Hm, I like all flowers, so I don’t have a favorite. But I do like surprises, so I’ll like anything your dad brings me.”
So he is now awake and up, for the sake of his very pregnant sister-in-law, and is being fairly reimbursed by large amounts of caffeine and whatever foodstuffs he chooses once they reach the farmers market.
And now it feels so fucking right to lean in for a goodnight kiss, standing here under the glaring security lights. Maybe not one hundred percent romantic, but he’s feeling it all the way. And if the way Cas is sweeping a tongue across his lower lip is any indication, then so is he.
“ Dat luff yoo, Din.” Jack joins the conversation, waffle and strawberry tower mostly eaten, sticky little face beaming. “ Luff yoo, mooaw!” He sends a smacking air kiss in Dean’s direction.
After that, Dean has basically two jobs. One is to run back and forth between the cafeteria, the nurses’ station, and Jess’ room. Two, is texting or calling everyone on the list Sam and Alice made in order to spread the word on the birth’s progress. He does so while Jess is getting her epidural, glad to have something to distract him from the needles and lines.  Dean also spends much of his time correcting people who assume he and Sam are a gay couple here with their surrogate, which happens way too often.
There are sirens in the distance and Castiel realizes he never called 9-1-1; a passing motorist on the other side of the median must have alerted emergency services. So he sits and rocks and cries as the man in his arms passes out and the sirens grow ever louder.
“ Think about it,” Jess pulls a sympathetic face. “ In the space of a day, one of your best friends and her sister are murdered, you're nearly killed by the same guy, and suddenly you're a full time dad to two little kids. And he's
He doesn’t stay in the hospital room much. He’s not here as a birth coach or doula or whatever Sam’s supposed to be doing as he pants in rhythm next to the hospital bed holding Jess’ hand. Her mother, Alice, on the side is being much more calm about it all. No, Dean’s here to be a gopher so Sam and Alice can stay in the room with Jess and they don’t have to worry about anything other than having a baby.  Once he drops the couple off at the hospital to meet up with Alice, Dean heads back to their house to pick up Jess’ previously packed care bag with her and the baby’s things and Sam’s overnight bag that’s been in his Prius for the past four months. Dean even takes an extra moment to properly strap in the new carseat into the backseat of Baby.
Dean laughs. “ You two are lucky your Daddy’s so nice. Bobby told us if we so much as sneezed aloud before nine o’clock Christmas morning he’d feed our presents to the Bigfoot in his barn.”
Dean steps out of the Impala, turning to look over the roof as Meg and Castiel approach him. Dean’s expression is unreadable as it flicks between Castiel and Meg, then settles on carefully flirty. And on Meg. “ Didn’t mean to interrupt an end-of-date kiss.” He winks at the dark haired woman.
“ Yep. Good morning to you.” He steps aside to let her into the bathroom, but she continues to stand in the hall, confused and squinty eyed.
On reflex, Castiel flips them both over, pressing their fronts to the road, his back exposed to the onslaught. The scratch on his back burns hotter, enough that Castiel can’t ignore the pain blooming across his skin and muscles. Not helped when the man beneath begins struggling in earnest, tear choked coughs laboring his breathing.
Alex makes some snuffling noises and looks up with his wide blue eyes, staring intently at Cas. Cas stares back with equal intensity, softened by the tiniest of smiles. “ You are very curious, aren’t you, Alex? Taking everything in. Like these strange people in your Uncle Dean’s house, yes.” He touches the very tip of his nose to the top of Alex’s fuzzy head.
So I tried very hard to write Dean's version of their September Sunday dinner and it just wasn't working, so I jumped ahead to October because I like October better anyway. :)
Castiel stares at the photo of Ruby hanging around the neck of Nicholas Adler. It’s a selfie, slightly blurry, as though her hand was unsteady on the phone. Or maybe he jostled her as she took the picture. They have matching smiles; wickedly curved, white teeth bright and sharp. Except, where Ruby’s expression is filled with a heat that Castiel can practically see radiating from her- all flames and passion- Nicholas’ is the exact opposite. Cold. Calculating. Cruel. Textbook psychopath and Castiel doesn’t understand how this woman can’t see that. But, that’s not how abuse works, he chides himself. As much as he dislikes her, Castiel sincerely hopes Ruby will make it out of this particular relationship better off than poor Kelly.
“  I know, sweetheart. But I’m right here, and Mr. Cain is just a phone call away and Dean is still here, in the den. We won’t let anything bad happen to you, I promise.”
“ Well, “ Claire holds up her hand and begins counting points off her fingers. “ He’s a pee-dee-uh-trih-shun.” Claire sounds the long word out phonetically. “ He’s really good with Alex and Jack. And he’s pretty cool with me. He has a lot of video games to play, and is really funny, so… Yeah. I think he’d be a good dad.”
Dean dips his head slightly and raises their joined hands higher to rest on the bottom edge of the pillow. Castiel can feel the tip of Dean’s nose pressing lightly against his knuckles. Dean is settling down, relaxing into the mattress, into Castiel.  “ People just want me to diagnose them for free. I can’t tell you how many rashes I’ve seen outside of the office because people are too embarrassed to see their primary physician.”  Dean’s other hand begins moving up and down over the back of Castiel’s t-shirt, idly petting him. “ Or they want my opinions on potty training just so they can disagree. “
Castiel resists the urge to snuggle the sleepy man and lets the smile spread across his face as he angles the phone so Dean can watch the video of Gabriel, Claire, and Jack destroying Castiel’s kitchen in their efforts to make breakfast.
It’s too dim to see, but Castiel is certain their handshake is white knuckling it now.  Also, that’s a really vague thought because his brain is still comprehending Dean as a switch. Not that he thought Dean was a hardcore top or anything. Or that he’s thought about Dean in any type of sexual manner no matter how lush those lips of his are or--
Castiel huffs a laugh and pushes Dean’s shoulder to get him going toward the den where the children are waiting. “ I suppose you can have one, too. And breakfast in the morning.”
“ I’m sure he will be.” Castiel again follows her, hoping to put off his misgivings with some online smartphone shopping while Claire is in the bath. “ Mr. Cain wouldn't let anyone come here to hurt us, so this person must be very nice indeed.”
Castiel has two pages of instructions on the coffee table and a screwdriver clenched in his teeth, attempting to get a thick plastic cupboard door wedged into place before inserting the large plastic screws. It’s much more difficult than the instructions led him to believe. He spits the screwdriver onto the floor at his side, frustrated by its lack of usefulness.
Even when Gabriel sidles up next to him, face just as smug as Castiel had imagined. “ That was the best walk-of-shame I’ve ever witnessed.” Gabriel winks and elbows him in the ribs.
“ Yash.” Jack solemnly nods his head. “ Teep Dat’s tandy.” Then he seems to think better of it and reaches into his pumpkin to fish out a mini Snickers bar. He pushes it into Dean’s hand. “ Dis fo Din.”
He proceeds up the sidewalk and pauses at the spot where Cain has still not looked up, to tap briskly on the window. Cain doesn’t jerk or startle. He merely raises his head and smiles at Dean through the glass.
in the dark, eating way too many bags of Doritos. Alone with his thoughts that aren’t exactly all rainbows and puppies at the moment.
The noise recedes as Castiel steps through the staff door into the communal work area that bridges the adult and children’s sides of the library. He shares one largish corner with Garth, the younger man happily relinquishing half his space so the new hire wouldn’t have to sit at a tiny countertop next to the printer.
There’s another cold beer waiting for him when he gets back to the table and Dean gratefully decimates it. Then Jess is pushing her second ice water towards him and he happily swallows half down in a few parched gulps.
“ Bitch.” Dean aims for the younger man’s gut. Sam flinches, of course, and retaliates with a slap that just barely grazes Dean’s arm as he jumps out of reach and jogs around the Impala toward the driver side.
“ Believe we will.” Cas steps back and eases onto the couch, careful not to disturb the other occupants. Claire has decided to keep standing, only moving to lean over the couch arm on the other side of Dean.
” NO, no, no! I need you there, Cassie!” Gabriel sounds even more desperate than usual. He and Kali must have had a recent run-in. ‘ Can’t that ominous landlord of yours watch them for a few hours?”
Dean nods and heads to the door for his coat and boots. He’s got them laced up by the time Cain rejoins him, handing over a large heavy duty Maglite. Flashlight and blunt object all-in-one. Dean looks up from the Maglite and takes in the hunting rifle nestled in the crook of Cain’s elbow, muzzle pointing safely at the floor, as the older man slips into his own boots. Cain raises a questioning brow, but Dean pulls his keys from his coat pocket, and puts the keys back after slipping off a set of artfully formed brass knuckles from the ring. He slips the metal over his right hand and holds the Maglite in his left. Cain nods in approval and they exit the house.
u had yur heat on in October, i had all my window sopen! my place is like 10 degrees cooler thna yours!
“ No.” Cain shakes his head over his spoon before putting it down, curling both hands around the warm bowl. He’s still smiling, strong nostalgia softening his voice further when he continues. “ Harvelle’s Roadhouse parking lot, on Baby’s hood, Black Friday, an hour after closing.” Cain pauses, letting his correction sink in. “ And you kissed me. Without asking first, as I recall.”
Castiel nods, affirming his own thoughts. “ Aaron’s right. I know you can prove, without a doubt, that Ruby is the one sending the emails. But that would mean telling the authorities just
Dean hadn’t even realized it was his phone ringing. He’d completely zoned out, letting the Tom Petty seeping from the speakers lull him into a haze. Without taking his eyes from the road, Dean pulls the phone free and flips it open, heart already sinking heavy in his gut. He already knows who it is, but is careful not to name them aloud. “ Hey, what’s up?”
Charlie’s quiet voice brings him out of his thoughts.“ She’s smart. This is the only public pic of them together on her social media, and while it’s definitely friendly, it’s not necessarily romantic. But I bet she’s got a private album…” Charlie turns back to her laptop, brings up Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter and a few other platforms that Castiel isn’t familiar with. “ Instagram first. Show me your secrets.”
Selfish and stupid and irresponsible and-- “ Stay a little longer? Please?” Castiel hears his own rough whisper in reply. He shouldn’t ask this of Dean, but Dean offered and Castiel is so Goddamn tired. And afraid. “ Until the movie is over?”
“ Awesome.” Dean claps his hands and rubs them together as though he’s about to jump into the world’s best apple pie. Which is what’s in the tote bag, lucky him. Anytime he orders Cain’s
“ Yes, you are! Come up here and help me add the secret ingredients.”  Dean pulls a stepladder from the pantry, snaps it open, and slides it up against the counter near the sink. Claire clambers up and waits patiently for Dean to return to the counter with a large package of ground hamburger and several bottles of dried seasonings. Castiel listens as they talk about school and baking as Dean shows Claire how to use the lids to measure out the spices into a small bowl, letting her sniff each one first. Dean makes a big show of hiding the identity of the seasonings, man and child whispering fervently together with bowed heads over the bowl.
Castiel has witnessed the young couple not-so-covertly necking a few times in the library study rooms. He does not look forward to his own children reaching puberty. “ Yes, like Patience and Alfie. We would like to go out sometime, just the two of us, when we have the chance, but mostly we simply want to spend more time together. Here, or at Dean’s. Not much would change otherwise… Is that okay with you?”  He gently places the real issue in all this in his daughter's court, refusing to be nervous. Claire likes Dean and has never had any attachment to the idea of Castiel and Amelia being together. And even if, in the off chance, Claire doesn’t approve, Castiel is not giving up on Dean. They’ll work it out somehow, no matter what.
The well loved CD begins skipping and Castiel reaches to eject it when the flash of lights up ahead catches hi attention. It’s not steady flashing, like emergency vehicles or road hazard warnings. It’s almost flickering, with huge swathes of steady high beam level of white light cutting across the landscape.
“ I know, right?” Jess slips her arm through his and steers him through the crowd. “ It smells way to good in here. I say we get second breakfast on the way out and head home for a nap.”
“ You and Castiel were getting along pretty well.” Casual, yet oh so not. Sam only glances at Dean over his own pizza. “ Looks like you’ve got a new friend.” Brotherly teasing.
Too far away is safer for Dean, though. Castiel smacks the intrusive thought away, but the truth of it echoes still. This is dangerous. Simply being acquainted with Castiel puts people in the line of fire and Castiel doesn’t want to drag Dean into this mess.  That would be the best thing to do. Keep Dean at a distance, let Dean keep his distance. Distracted by his conflicting emotions, Castiel nods absently. “ It’s Christmas break, for all of us, so I’ll let them be. I’ll carry them to bed later.”
“ Awwwww, you mean it can’t be my lair anymore?” Claire lets her head thump dramatically onto the table.
Dean’s head whips up, re-establishing eye contact. “ What?” He’d been so far in his head and worries the question takes him completely by surprise.
Cain mirrors his frown and eyes the bag. Dean turns to make sure his shadow isn’t blocking their view and carefully reaches into the oversized garbage bag. His fingers touch cardboard, a handle. Grabbing the handle securely, Dean lets the bag fall to the ground, exposing a decorated cardboard box folded into the shape of a house.
Castiel shakes his head, unintentionally widening the space between them to keep from headbutting the taller man. “ No, Dean. That’s too much. You’re right next door, we’ll be fine--”
“ It’ll be okay.” Dean seems to have gathered himself back together from his lapse outside, raising his hand to grip Castiel’s shoulder. Firm and reassuring, even through Castiel’s many layers. Castiel can see Dean’s face clearly now in the well lit kitchen, his green eyes bright and sincere. The worry lines still present, however.  “ I’ve got ‘em.”
“ Fuckin’ Build-a-Bear?” Dean glances up to Cain, incredulous at the discovery. “ We’re terrorizing people with stuffed animals, now? Christ.”
Dean hands over the last of his cash and dumbly watches as his ex-lover counts out his change and prints out a receipt from an ancient adding machine. The receipt goes into the bag and Cain folds the top over before handing it to Dean. “ I hope to see you again.” Soft blue eyes, soft smile.
Dean can’t see Sam’s expression, but there’s a pause, and Jess pulls her husband down for a kiss that he eagerly returns. Jess is creepily perceptive, as always. Dean remembers John showing him how to buckle baby Sammy into his one and only car seat the morning they left that first motel. It’s hazy, but there had been many more instances until Sam outgrew it and they didn’t have money for a new toddler sized one. So Sam shared Dean’s seatbelt, Dean’s arm tight around him.
Rowena eats it up, per usual. “ My wee chick, ye’ve grown since last week, I swear!” She ruffles the felt comb of his costume and turns to Claire for the same treatment. Claire also adds extra smoochy noises for effect. “ And you, little lady, are nearly tall as your father!”
Dean makes sure Jack keeps away from the accordion door when he opens it, protecting those little fingers from a severe pinch, exposing the stacked washer and dryer. “ Washer.” He taps the lower door. “ Dryer.” Dean slaps the glass of the upper door. He cancels the washer’s alarm before it can sound again and pulls open the porthole-esque door. “ So…” Dean quirks a thoughtful frown. “ How we gonna do this?”
Dean slips out and heads back to the couch, sinking into the corner with a contented sigh. He feels like he does at the end of a day when’s he managed to soothe every terrified and cranky patient that’s thrown his way. When he avoids vomit and exploding diapers. Dean feels victorious, triumphant. Amazing even. But mostly he feels so fucking warm and gooey inside. So much so, that he closes his eyes and drifts off…
He can’t blame Cas for this. Won’t blame Cas. It’s not Cas’ fault he pushes nearly all of Dean’s buttons. That just thinking about the man brings a warm smile to Dean’s face. Watching Cas laugh as he swings Jack around in his arms or gives Claire a piggy back ride makes Dean feel all gooey inside. But all these weird feelings are on Dean, not Cas, and Dean sure as hell isn’t entertaining the idea of anything more than a nice neighborly friendship out of this whole situation. Despite his family and friends’ well intentioned interference.
Castiel turns back around to catch Dean quickly turning his head away, guilty. Had the man been watching them? Watching him? It’s a pleasant thought, and most likely wishful thinking, and Castiel dismisses it as he approaches the beautiful ebony car. He has to consciously ignore the prickling of unease at the sight of the vehicle, memories still sitting very uneasily with him. Dean is lightly jangling his key ring in one hand, other pushed into his back jean pocket. Smiling across Baby’s hood. Castiel smiles back. “ Sorry. She’s very… Meg.”
In the warm darkness, the peaceful quiet settling over the house, Castiel just barely catches the tiny whisper under his chin.
“ Very accurate.” Castiel reaches for the pan and welcomes Cain into his home, squashing the moment of panic he feels at having left the door wide open. He’s safe. They’re all safe here. There’s a moment of shuffling to find everything a place to rest, then Castiel is calling out, “ Take your prey and show him the early Christmas present Uncle Balthazaar sent.”
. “ So, if she is the one sending the emails, then busted, regardless, but… Is she doing it on her own, or sending these on behalf of dickwad there?”
But this would have been the first time that Castiel invited Dean over specifically for adult alone time. Nothing inappropriate, of course! No. Just… He had wanted to see Dean. Spend some time with Dean without his attention being pulled in a million directions. A quiet night with the kids safe in bed and a superhero movie playing softly in the background while they discuss classic cars and apiology...
She sounds so much like Gabriel in that moment Castiel nearly laughs, but instead he gathers his carefully worded answer. Because it’s not Dean’s responsibility to answer Claire’s questions, despite his earnest attempt to do so. Castiel clears his throat and smiles gently at her curious little face. “  We talked about how we would like to kiss each other again and how we should go about making that happen. We…” And he trails off, because they didn’t actually go into details in the short time they’ve been awake this morning. So when Castiel continues, he glances at Dean to gauge his reaction. “ We talked about becoming more than friends and decided we’d like to start dating.”  Dean’s smile grows exponentially and that’s all the answer Castiel needs.
Okay, a bit weird to mention, but logical. Dean nods and knocks back the rest of his coffee. “ I’ll talk to Sam and Jess about it today.”
So if this new person has Cain’s seal of approval, there’s not much Castiel can say against it. He tightens his hold on the glass, feeling the chilled surface grow damp against his fingers, them releases it. “ I trust your judgment, Cain. When will this person be moving in?”
It’s not that far between Sioux City and Sioux Falls, with little traffic this early in the morning. And Dean certainly isn’t keen on spending anymore time than is necessary in the confined space of the car with his father verbally cutting him apart between every loaded pause. But Dean is wary of holiday weekend speed traps and DUI checkpoints and drives accordingly, not much above the legally posted limit. Meaning he still has another hour until he hits Singer Salvage and can unload his ungrateful passenger onto Bobby or the couch, whichever he comes across first.
“ Anytime you’re free this week, text me and I’ll give you a tour before you decide.“  Cain’s smile is interrupted by his phone beeping insistently in the table at his side. “ I’m so sorry, Dean. That’s my reminder for an appointment with another vendor. “
Jack ends the heated debate by popping up, nearly banging Dean’s chin, squealing at the TV screen.” Bee ger! Loo da bee ger!”
“ The old story with the axe murderer calling the babysitter from inside the house… never mind.” Charlie tucks her long hair behind her ears and buckles down, typing fast and furious as she talks. “ So, the IP address- and I’m not explaining that right now- listed for all the emails is one the library uses, which I guess isn’t too unusual since it’s a public network.” Several windows flash up on screen then disappear. “ But it also means they’d have to be within range of the library’s wifi which isn’t that great since you can’t even get it in the breakroom at the back of the building. Well.
That small, self deprecating smile crinkles the corners of Cas’ eyes. He shakes his head. “ Jack has outgrown so much, so quickly, I haven’t even had time to make a Goodwill run. “ He reaches out to tweak Jack’s foot. Jack mumbles a no. “ I’m glad they were able to make use of them. I told them if there’s anything else they need to let me know before they purchase anything. Save some time and money.”
Which is okay because they’re still gonna be friends. He’s still gonna protect those damn kids like they’re his own.
As he learned from the previous year, November in middle Tennessee is cold and rainy. Not his favorite weather, but preferable to the early snows he’s encountered further north. Perfect weather for staying inside Gabriel’s luxury loft apartment in downtown Nashville, Wednesday night through Saturday morning. The children delight in sleeping in the guest bedroom decorated in gaudy nineties chic, Castiel allows himself to get tipsy enough with Gabriel’s top shelf Amaretto to fall asleep peacefully on the overstuffed sectional in the living room (much more Crate & Barrel).
Dean doesn’t even hesitate. He leans in and wraps his arms around the man’s waist and squeezes, hooking his chin over Cain’s shoulder. Cain immediately returns the embrace, arms curling around Dean, hands pressing flat and firm on his back. It’s a solid hug, without words. Reaffirming the mutual affection and respect they thought was lost so long ago.  Confirming this second chance.
, and for the finale, recites a Monster Protection spell over a real cauldron full of various sized bric-a-brac to hand out as talismans. The children are in awe and the parents are equally impressed.
They give their last waves and exit the building, stepping out into the chilly air. Claire shakes her hair from her face. “ When he does, will you tell him we have something for the new baby?”
She seems genuinely perplexed by his behavior and Castiel can’t blame her; he can’t understand himself at the moment. “ I haven’t,” Castiel readily agrees. He rubs his temples, fingertips digging into the tense muscle there. “ I don’t know why I feel so strongly about him when we’ve barely known each other a month.”
Claire is seated comfortably at the small dining table tucked into a corner just beyond the kitchen’s border, Dr. Moore and Sam flanking her in mismatched chairs. Cain is at the kitchen counter, pouring Kool-Aid into the cups provided, lining them up, as he tells the story of the time his cat, Faulkner, chased a chipmunk into one of his beehives. Castiel knows Claire has heard this story several times, but it’s one of her favorites. He doesn’t interrupt as he takes a cup of drink and finds a spot on the kitchen floor out of the way, happily leaning back against a lower cabinet door. Jack promptly climbs into his lap.
Then his phone vibrates as he’s sliding into the driver’s seat, Claire and Jack properly strapped into their respective childseats in the back, and Castiel can’t help but laugh at the appearance of the ambulance emoji followed by a thumbs up emoji.
Cas tries to protest the public sharing of the video but the storm and front door are already closed and the locks thudding dully into place. Leaving them, once again, alone in the frozen silence.
And a year later, he’s still dealing with Zachariah’s atrocious ambition. But he’s getting paid, so Castiel soldiers on.
“ Have you seen Gabriel’s office lately?” Sam counters with a big grin. “ You know he’s redone the whole space and now that entire wall behind his desk is nothing but personal mementos. And most are photos of you and him together.”
Jack is supposed to flush the big potty when he’s done but that will make a loud noise and he doesn’t want to be loud because people are sleeping and Daddy says not to wake up people when they are sleeping and Jack is a big boy and listens to Daddy.
“ I’m good, thank you.” Castiel smiles up at the younger man. “ And,” he knows he’s blushing at the admission. “ I’d like to hold him a bit longer. He’s very comfortable.”
“ Yeah, Cas. That’s cool.” Dean likes the blush on the other man’s cheeks. Is it from embarrassment over the socks? Or because Dean is shirtless? Well, there’s a quick way to find out. “ I usually don’t sleep in a shirt, well, I’m usually just in boxers honestly because I overheat. But I can…” He lets it trail off and raises the t-shirt in hand for a yay or nay.
Claire’s mouth turns down into a thoughtful pout. “ Well,” she begins in that tone that Castiel has come to learn means he’s about to be hit with a bit of inarguable child logic. “ You could get me the sword and shield for Christmas and get me the lab for my birthday.”
“ ‘Probly ‘cause he can’t text and drive. Right?” Claire makes a very good point. “ It takes a long time to get to the hospital.”
Castiel  pokes Gabriel hard in the side. “ Be nice,” he warns. Gabriel throws his hands up in surrender and goes about helping the others set the table for New Year’s breakfast. Castiel watches a moment longer, just basking in the familial joy before making his way to his bedroom.
Built post-war in the 50’s, the ranch home sits split level on a sharp rise of earth more than a mile from the main road. It’s the very definition of rambling and Dean can already imagine the bowling alley like hallways inside. Outside it looks like any  number of other post war homes in the more well-to do area; dark stone face below lighter gray vertical wooden planks, asymmetrical exaggerated eaves overhanging sets of narrow shutterless windows. A stone and steel carport extends from the near side of the house, closest to the main drive.
“ Yes, thanks, “ Castiel replies automatically, eyes locked onto the screen where the words are frozen so innocently. Two enthusiastic compliments, from a friend or even an acquaintance, would be happily received. But this… He feels threatened, cornered, pushing toward panic. But he swallows it down, adds the email to the proper folder and signs out of his computer. Then Castiel gets up, walks across the workroom, plasters a small smile on his face and pokes his head through the adult side staff door.
Castiel sighs heavily, head dropping into his open hands, elbows resting on his knees in defeat. “ Why is everyone so interested in my love life?”
“ You want it to be special, I know. Look, before the holiday season wrecked everyone’s schedules, you two used to have dinner together pretty regularly, right?”
Music and dialogue still float quietly from the tv, but not enough to muffle the rustle of fabric, their breathy little noises.
Which Dean knows means his younger brother is about ask him something he knows Dean is going to hate with a passion and most likely adamantly refuse. “ Well, if Bobby has you calling me, then whatever it is is probably not a good idea.” This argument always worked on Sammy back in the good old days. Nearly all the way through the boy’s high school years. Dean is very aware of his father’s cold silence on the other side of the car.
“ But being with him makes the stress of everything else a whole helluva lot better, doesn’t it?” Gabriel shrugs when Castiel doesn’t respond immediately, and continues wrapping the Ninja Turtle. “ I’m just saying, I don’t think
Clang of the grill lid, pop and hiss, and suddenly there’s a cold bottle of beer nudging against his elbow. Castiel looks down at the freshly opened bottle, then up at Dean.
How dare he threaten Kelly’s son! Castiel’s son! Not Nicholas’, never his! And never will be if Castiel has anything to do with it.
“ Actually, it really is, Clarence,” she counters, stretching her leg and kicking his knee. “ According to the brats the sun shines outta this guy’s ass. And I looked him up on the clinic’s website. If he looks anything like his profile pic then I don't see what’s holding you up.” Meg swings her leg back to her side and tucks it under her opposite thigh. She runs a finger across her lower lip. ” I’m not even into dudes, but I’d make an exception for that mouth of his.”
Cain is the first to start over, pushing a wax paper envelope toward Dean. “ I wasn’t sure if you’d eat something beforehand, but I bought an extra croissant. If you’d like.”
It’s frightening how quickly Dean has come to associate these combined scents with peace and happiness and
at. Dammit. See what you did?” Cas shakes his head after the yawn, almost like a dog, watery eyes blinking rapidly.
“ Little angels,” Gabriel replies over his shoulder, still standing at the sink. “ Only dragged me out of bed at six am.” He sounds only mildly accusing.
The other areas of the luxe apartment or no less decorated, though slightly more mature in taste. Gabriel has a high quality artificial tree in the living room, strung with white lights and white and gold decorations shaped like various candies. Faux fir boughs and garlands highlight the window wall that looks out over downtown Nashville, gold glitter bows tying them in place. It’s oddly tasteful and Castiel suspects Kali had a hand in it before she left to visit her own family in India.
Once the fabric is thoroughly soaked with his saliva and Dean is panting hard and fast, Castiel decides to move on. He carefully slides the panties down, tucking them under Dean’s sensitive balls. Castiel had gotten a few glimpses of Dean’s lovely cock earlier, before things became too intense, but he appreciates this chance for a closer inspection. The satiny head with a prominent flare, traceable veins along the shaft, a neatly trimmed patch of coarse hair at its base. Castiel gently fondles the pliant sac. Dean rewards him with a small moan and firm touch to the back of his hand, encouraging more contact. Castiel happily complies by curling his tongue underneath and rolling a firm orb into his mouth. It’s even better without the fabric barrier; contrasting textures of hair and skin, taste of salt and hint of soap. Dean curses under his breath, his hands flexing on Castiel’s shoulders. His cock swells even more, right in front of Castiel’s face, filling out completely and bobbing slowly over his navel. Castiel watches it- and Dean’s face- as he gives the same fond treatment to the other testicle.
“ I’ve finally settled into the place. It’s time I have some company that isn’t my moose of a little brother.” Dean’s laugh erases the tension in his frame, his arms loose, his smile relaxed. “ It’s the neighborly thing to do, Cas. Please?”
Jack dives right in, pulling out a twisted bundle of undershirts, a pair of damp boxers falling onto the floor. “ Up, Din.” He raises his hands, laundry hanging down into his face.
Fear pinches Dean’s stomach, the once awesome food now settling heavy in his gut. “ Not one anyone’s expecting?” He drops his handful of popcorn into the bowl and carefully sets it on the middle couch cushion.
“ We’re the same age, old woman.” Castiel snarks back, but it ends in another yawn and ruins the effect somewhat. “ Let me check on the children and I’ll walk you to your car.”
Castiel is smiling, that gummy smile that makes Dean want to keep it there all the fucking time. “ Yes, we’ll follow Claire.”
A beat, then Dean is snorting with laughter, curled around Cas’ body as he shakes with unbridled glee. This. This is what he’s missed in recent years with his infrequent random hook-ups. This easy intimacy, comforting touches and unguarded laughter. Cas’ big hands smooth over his hips, bringing Dean’s attention back to the task at hand. One more breath, stuttering softly through one last chuckle. He gently butts his forehead against the other man’s and plants a grinning kiss on his cheek. “ Okay, Mr. Standup. Stop distracting me.”
“ We experimented together a few times in our freshman year.” Castiel shrugs, pulling up the few pleasant, but uncomfortable, memories. “ It didn’t take long for us to realize that we were better off as friends-without-benefits. And then Meg came out as a lesbian, not bi, as she originally thought, and I’m apparently a demiromantic omnisexual. According to Meg, at least. “  He shrugs again, suddenly uncertain about sharing so much of his personal information with someone who didn’t really ask for this many details. Castiel scuffs the toe of his sneaker in the gravel, suddenly nervous. “ Anyway, no. We were never really involved, not in the way you’re thinking.”
for no reason Castiel can see. There are at least three currently ongoing, the oldest has been making its rounds for five months. He’s fairly certain Aaron and Ash are the ones responsible for its longevity. Castiel deletes them out of hand; anything important will get back to him through the grapevine or Garth. There’s a schedule change request from one of the pages, Hael, due to class conflicts. Two are from Zachariah that he won’t even bother to open until tomorrow. Rowena has sent him- and Garth and Charlie according to the details- more photos of her holiday in Romania. A staff memo from Mayor Adler. A reminder about Labor Day closings. A reminder about the carpet cleaning next week.
“ You’d tell him.” Castiel confirms. “ But I just can’t… I don’t think I can deal with that. Right now.”
Jack is sitting on the exam bench, holding the popsicle now, but not sucking on it. Castiel is gathering his things; a diaper bag slung over his shoulder, a wet navy suit coat draped carelessly over the bag. He has a steady hand on Jack’s knee to keep him in place. “ Thank you, Dean. We appreciate the kindness.” Castiel offers his free hand.
Castiel watches as Dean frowns, mouth open to repeat his protestations, but Cain raises a stern brow and Dean huffs over to the couch and carefully lowers himself into Cain’s spot.
A tiny movement of Dean’s hips and their lengths brush together and Dean is back to trembling. Hot satiny flesh sliding smoothly between them, damp heads bumping into bellies as they both rock and thrust tentatively, testing the limits of their positions. Dean takes a deep breath, curves a hand over the couch back, locks his elbow, and wraps his opposite hand around Cas’ solid length. He has to take another deep inhale at the touch; velvety skin and stiff flesh against his palm, hot and heavy in his grasp. Musk and Irish Spring filling his nostrils. Dean breathes it in and bumps his forehead against Cas’ temple.
man.” Dean covers his eyes with both hands, scrubbing through his hair and back down over his beard until he lets them flop to his sides on the couch. No point moping in a semi dark room when he can mope while he gets his laundry and dishes done before bedtime. Maybe even watch an episode of
Somehow Dean knows they don't need anything else right now. He returns the smile and turns on heel, shuffling along the damp grass, taking the short path around the back of the house to his own back door.
“ Here. Socks first, Grumpy.” Dean reaches toward the foot of the bed where Castiel notices, for the first time, his neatly folded university hoodie topped by a thick pair of dark gray socks.
down the hall to Daddy’s room. The bear growls again. So loud! This is like the song Miss Ambriel sings with him.
Dean accepts his silence as the acquiescence it is and gives a soft smile. “ Besides, you have one of the most comfortable couches ever. It’s not that much of a hardship.”
The phone drops into Dean’s lap, another glance at his father as he forms a reply in his mind. Dean opens his mouth to say something, spit an insult, yell an ultimatum. Just fucking swear at fate itself. But John gives him
Something in Dean’s stomach twists uncomfortably. A jolt of adrenaline for no fucking reason, except this guy has got a pair of incredibly bright sky blue eyes and sometimes that causes his brain to kick up a bunch of old ass memories that have absolutely no relevance to his current situation. And since lots of people have blue eyes it’s no excuse for Dean’s professionalism to take a vacation. He forces the brain fart to dissipate, his vision finally expanding to take in more than just the cerulean orbs and Dean finds an equally pleasing arrangement of features; messy dark hair, tanned skin and laugh lines, chapped lips amidst an expanse of dark stubble. And no wedding band. So totally his type and also so unfuckingprofessional of him.
Castiel is ashamed of his actions, but also rather proud at being able to thoroughly frustrate Meg’s attempts at discussing the Dean Situation.  Although, Meg, in retaliation, does her best to bring Dean up with the children who are more than happy to be pumped for information. So, while Castiel manages to avoid his particular problem, he
Castiel jumps from his car and races toward the trapped vehicle. He spots a figure near the opposite shoulder of the road. The form is motionless, but out of immediate danger, so Castiel dismisses them in favor the people who may not be lucky enough to have an easy escape.
tired, but in a more introvert-needs-his-quiet kinda way than physical fatigue. In fact that’s exactly it, though he’s never really considered himself an introvert, but he definitely just doesn’t have the energy required for socializing right now. Even with his family.
Castiel laughs and stands up from the couch, stretching to pop his back. He is getting better at styling Claire’s long hair into ever more complex patterns, but he had certainly overshot his skill level today, having watched the video tutorial only once before agreeing to try it for their little get-together with Dean.
The heating kicks back on. The television program ends and another begins. Cas dumps a squirt of high-end unscented lotion into the mix. Their breaths grow more ragged between exchanged endearments and curses.
“ Ok, yeah. Castiel always looks like he’s two steps away from a parental meltdown and the workaholic over here needs to have fun with someone who’s not a coworker or family. And it is stupidly convenient that they get along
Dean can’t find the words or time to properly explain. He shakes his head and manages with more determination, “ No, I just
again. Castiel and the children play around their own house for the rest of the day, happy to be lazy until tomorrow’s Friendsgiving with Dean and Cain.
Three chaotic games of Spongebob Monopoly later (Claire is a cold calculating player and wins every round), the kids are clean and asleep, each giving Dean a final extra big birthday hug before being led off to their bedroom, while Dean picks a movie above a PG rating.
“ Oh. Oh!” Dean laughs, too, bouncing Jack up and down in his arms to hear him squeal in delight. “ Well, I’d rather be associated with ice pops than shots. Sorry, buddy. I don’t have any pops right now. Maybe next time.”
Also the man is soaked through to his white undershirt, like he didn’t actually use the tan trench coat draped over the back of the chair, dripping onto the tile.
“ I’ve seen your pictures, Claire. Remember?” Dean grins at her, tugging on one long curl. “ But I’d love to see ‘em again, if you want.”  She sat at Cas’ laptop the first time he came over for dinner and put on slideshow after slideshow of family photos. Dean had loved the way Cas blushed and stammered over some of the more embarrassing ones of himself when he was younger.
Before he met Amelia Kline, Castiel had done little more than casual flings and a few short term relationships meant mostly to explore his budding sexuality. He had fun, he made friends, but never felt the need to take any of it further. Though he was certainly curious about more.
For a very brief time he’d thought he’d found that in Lisa, the same year of that devastating wreck. Nearly a decade before, they’d had an amazing one night stand in Cicero, Indiana when Dean was passing through on his way to bail his father out of jail, again. She was nineteen, in her freshman year of college, her whole bright life ahead of her. He was barely a year older and still looking out for Sammy and still cleaning up after John. Nine years later, he was passing through Indiana again, this time in a loaner POS of Bobby’s, and couldn’t resist the pull of nostalgia that had him looking her up and knocking on her front door. And she’d let him in. Smart, beautiful, caring Lisa Braeden. And her eight-year-old son, Ben.
“ Oh, uh, no.” Castiel shakes his head to get the little frown off his face and tucks the phone back into his coat pocket.
Cas and the kids went out to dinner with Meg. That’s where Dean would have tried first. But they’re not home, so he’ll have to look elsewhere for quiet company.
“ I have that weekend off, and Christmas Eve is Monday, Christmas Day is Tuesday, so the library is closed both days. “ Castiel squints as he tries to remember the exact dates. “ Rowena is back in town, and Benjamina said it was fine for me to take the rest of the week off. If last year is anything to go by, the library is not very busy around the actual holidays. Most gather their items beforehand, to have for traveling. There are no programs scheduled for the entire second half of December, either adult or children’s. So I have a very long weekend. But we’ll be here until the morning of Christmas Eve and come back the day after Christmas to assemble all the oversized toy sets I’m certain Gabriel has so thoughtfully gifted us.” He sighs, but it’s mostly for show. Gabriel’s lavish affection for the children is one of the many things Castiel loves about his older brother.
Honestly, as far as mornings went, this one wasn’t so bad. He didn’t pass back out and was able to breathe normally in a relatively short amount of time.
Dean let a few uneven breaths out through his teeth and swallowed. It wasn’t as bad as he expected it to be. It was just like when he and Sam had to stitch each other up.
Great, not only were their captors freaks they were sick too. He’d probably get an infection just staying put.
He forced Sam down to sit on the ground as easily as he could, though it got a bit rough because Sam kept fighting. Once on the ground and chained in place once again, Crash lightly pushed the long hair out of Sam’s eyes and rubbed careful circles with his thumbs on Sam’s temples, cheek, and forehead.
Crash tilted his head. “A half-life is not a full life. We have a significantly shortened life span and the only way for us to be considered useful and our lives meaningful is to die historic in the name of the Immortan.”
The drumming stopped and minutes later an uproarious  cry echoed from hundreds of voices. Crash’s head snapped up. The Immortan was dead.
Crash bit his lip and glanced around like he was afraid of being caught. “...And if he doesn’t come back... like you suggested? What if we fixed here?”
Crash groaned again and slowly roused himself. The fever left him too cold to sleep. He started to stretch himself out and stood shakily.
“That is correct. I will take that burden so my other boys can go on and have the after lives they deserve, instead of a mediocre death just because they wanted to impress the Immortan. “
“Now, I am going to re-stitch your wounds closed so you don’t lose any more blood than necessary alright?”
He made his rounds and a small war pup reached out to him to be held. He wasn’t supposed to indulge them, it made them weaker according to the organic. But he wasn’t here at the moment so Crash picked up the little pup and held him close. He hummed softly, voice rough from disuse but the Pup didn’t seem to mind. He snuggled close and closed his eyes. His head was freshly shaved and he fit well in Crash’s arms. Soon the Pup was asleep and Crash tucked him back in. Crash settled down on the ground close to his ferals but out of reach from the chains. He closed his eyes and fell into an uneasy sleep himself.
Dean awoke again and it was dark in the tunnel. No light streamed in but for tiny slivers of moonlight. He could see the largish shape that was his brother. Good, the freaks haven’t eaten him yet. Dean tried to sit up but didn’t make it far. His injuries still hurt too much for a lot of movement. He could make out the slumped shape of someone against the wall, just out of reach. He would bet money on it being that weird guy with the thousand yard stare. They had to get out of here. He tried to get up again but couldn’t.
The Impala rumbled through the expansive desert. Sam glanced fearfully at his older brother; the whoops of the war boys were way too close.  “Come on Dean, Fang it!”
“No! No, you’ll get cold. This is okay. We’ll get used to it. Won’t we Dean?” said Sam kicking his brother’s foot.
Castiel nodded back and very slowly drank his water. He couldn’t remember the last time he tasted anything so good.
“And go where? Back where you came from? To the ocean? Where dean? Where I'm no longer cursed? “ crash took a shaky breath.
They were both universal donors, which was excellent news. Properly contained, these two could save a lot of war boys. Crash began cleaning their wounds and stitched up what he could. The tall one woke after only a few hours of care. He was quickly chained and muzzled. He snarled and shouted at the smaller feral. Crash learned the smaller one’s name was Dean and the only way to calm the large feral was to chain him close to Dean. Crash tilted his head in curiosity as the large feral continued to rage at him. This would be interesting.
Hey guys! uh, I know it's been a really really long time since I've updated anything. Life had been kicking my ass but! I finally graduated and will be starting a new job that will hopefully allow me a bit more time to be creative! If anyone is still reading this, thank you so so much for sticking around! It really means the world to me!
Dean observed the shadowy figure. “Should you really be around injured people when you’re sick yourself?” he asked.
Sam most certainly did not want to go back but the chains on his hands kept him from lashing out at Crash. Crash put a gentle hand on Sam’s chest and pushed him until his back was against the wall. “Easy easy….everything is going to be just fine.” Said Crash.
Crash studied the two ferals in front of him. Compared to most ferals drug in from the desert, they were almost shine to look at. Other than their injuries from their run in with the war boys, they were shockingly healthy. No lumps or bumps, no obvious deformities or missing limbs, they looked strong. He wished the war boys hadn’t been so rough with them, one was nearly dead from being drug behind the vehicles. These two had much more value as blood bags than like this, but the boys claimed the ferals were too dangerous to haul in the cars. The pair had taken out two vehicles and seven war boys.
There was a slight gleam in Crash’s eye again. “....Not if none of them come back...all that are left here are warpups and warboys too sick to fight…”
Cas didn't answer and sat down on the hood. Dean could see enough to safely drive, though even if he couldn't all he would hit would be a dune or perhaps a cactus, but he was still not thrilled to have the warboy on his hood.
Crash hummed softly but didn’t stop until Sam had quite utterly fallen asleep. He carefully lowered Sam’s head to a more comfortable position and rose to his feet with a quiet cough before turning back to Dean.
“You think you can’t be useful or important unless you die in the name of some old dude? What the hell man? That’s messed up.”
Sam chewed his lip in thought. “He can probably fit in your clothes Dean. Put him in those and cover him in a bit more grease and he could be from anywhere. “
“ Jesus Christ.” Dean mutters, mouth of the beer bottle balancing on his lower lip a moment before he tilts it back to take a swig. Honestly, his first instinct is to run next door and scoop the entire little family into a massive hug. His papa bear instincts have always been strong, but hearing what not only the kids, but Cas, as well, have suffered through for so long… Dean has to forcefully keep his ass in his chair. Pity is not something they need. Overwrought displays of alpha male (his secondary instinct) are not needed. He swallows another gulp and makes the decision to just be the best damn neighbor he can be. “ Well, I guess it’s a good thing I’m here to keep an eye on them.”
Castiel silently escorts her to the entry where she flips a small wave and beaming smile over her shoulder before the automatic doors close behind her. He lets out a shuddery breath he didn’t realize he was holding. In fact, now that the immediate concern has been taken care of, all of Castiel’s muscles give an ache of protest before slowly relaxing. Even as the unease in his mind threatens to swallow him up.
And once he gets there, Dean has to admit that he enjoys the atmosphere. Not enough to regularly get up before the sun, but enough to hit up once or twice a month during season. And Jess has already made plans for the huge holiday market they hold each year in November.
Dean steps forward because he’s been silently listening in to the entire conversation, letting his thoughts settle before he blurts out something stupid like he tends to do. Dean is completely caught up in that intense blue stare when he opens his mouth and, “ I’m glad you live here!” falls out.
“ Dad, I don’t think this is working.” Claire turns her head in Castiel’s grip, the crooked braid skewing even further to the right.
Get your shit together, Winchester! Dean mentally kicks his own ass and forces his hand to release and move on to the boy’s blonde head, petting gently. “ Heya, Jack,” he greets softly.
Dean’s momentum sends him crashing into Cas, knocking the older man back a half step, but Dean whips both arms out and circles that strong lithe body, keeping Cas upright and in place for their mouths to meet. Enthusiastically. Maybe bordering on aggressive, but Dean can’t pull back. Not now when he can smell Cas’ aftershave and the scrape of stubble against his own is sending little electric shivers all along his body. Hairs standing on end. Their lips are parted and Dean licks inside, tasting Cain’s honey lip balm and sweeping along Cas’ tongue as it returns the gesture.
Castiel hums in thought, but shakes his head. “ It is very him, but I know he hasn’t been on the premises at the correct times; he’s almost never here past lunchtime.”
, aiming the remote back at the garage door to close it up, when he hears his name being hollered by a familiar voice from the other side of the car. Dean laughs at the sight of two little hands suddenly curved over the edge of the open passenger side window, then flinches at the thuds of little feet hitting the bottom half of the door; Jack clearly attempting to climb into the Impala the hard way.
” and a quieter exit, had still thought it the best plan of action when Cas asked him to stay, again. But Dean hadn’t been able to deny that spark of uncertainty in Cas’ eyes, the near desperate edge to that ”
“ Yes, of course.” Cas’ smile gets gummy, his antennae twitching. He squeezes back just as firmly. “ Good luck, Dean.”
“ Sam, let the man relive his glory days.” Jess is already buckling up, shifting slightly on the pillow Sam placed in her seat.
“ Exact opposite.” Dean assures the older man, still grinning. Breathing easier, he turns his head and kisses the palm cupping his left cheek, then his right. Then Dean covers the broad hands with his own and lowers them down his body, fingertips barely brushing his skin, until they’re resting at his waist band. He moves Cas’ right hand to the top button of his jeans and gives him a small encouraging nod. “ I’ll stay.”
Minding the Children’s Desk is not one of Castiel’s favorite jobs. He’s much more comfortable on the Adult side of the building, helping the retirees gather their newspapers and the college students research their papers. It’s very quiet. Unlike the children’s side.
Dean laughs and hugs her back firmly, before releasing the wild child back on her feet onto the floor. “ G’night, little lady.” He holds his closed hand out for their customary fist bump, receives an enthusiastic one complete with explosion noise, and watches her sprint back toward her bedroom. It’s another five minutes before Cas reappears, dopey smile on his handsome face. Dean scoots the baby monitor to the middle of the coffee table, volume on high so it picks up the rustle of bedclothes and sleepy sighs. Cas settles into the opposite corner of the couch, visibly relaxing into the overstuffed cushions. Dean smiles at the sight and hits play on the remote, letting Keanu and Patrick give them both a brief escape from reality.
“ Everyone ready?” Dean asks, hoping to dispel his own worries over Cas’ seeming hesitance to enter his car. He revs the engine a few times which distracts Jack’s attention from the horn, thank god. A chorus of affirmatives, one last revving, then Dean puts Baby into gear. “ You got it, Jack. Let’s go!” He eases up on the brake pedal, and taps the gas, sending the Impala up the gentle incline at a very slow crawl.
He’ll give himself tonight to pout, to rail against the unfairness of his life and entertain his little fantasy of something more. Except when he gets his hand on his crotch, Dean rubs twice and nothing happens except Dean feels sick to his stomach jerking off to the embattled father of two who’s probably tottering around in their kitchen right now meal prepping Claire’s school lunches and putting Jack’s snacks into little containers decorated with
“ Yes, Dean.” Castiel gently squeezes the thumb still in his grasp, smooths his other fingers along the back of Dean’s neck.
He replies with a congratulations and reminder to rest, before plugging his phone in to charge and settling down for a couple hours of sleep himself. The lovely image comforts him as he drifts off.
Cain gives a small satisfied nod, obviously happy with Dean’s thoughtfulness. “ I’ll speak with them about it, but I believe my word will be enough to vouch for your character.” He taps the sides of his cup in thought. “ In fact, they might appreciate another neighbor close by. My cabin is out of sight and hearing from the main house, so you’d be the closest in case of any emergencies.”
The nurse from before, Alex- Castiel has spoken with her on several occasions- brings the promised tissues and Castiel would question the amused expression on her young face but Jack has a coughing fit and he’s too busy wiping the snotty nose and carefully covering the hacking mouth.
Because that first Saturday night Dean had already agreed to watch Alex, and now Bones the puppy, while Sam takes Jess for a romantic weekend getaway. The next Saturday, Dean has a sinus infection and is laid up in his own bed, drugged to the gills. The next Saturday Jack has a stomach bug and Dean keeps Claire at his place, hoping to spare her the same suffering and ease Cas’ workload.
Castiel glances to the television and indeed there is a music video with a young girl dressed as a bee wandering across the screen through a variety of social situations. The song is vaguely familiar to him, but Dean is apparently a fan.
Castiel can’t hear anything else over Dean’s burst of laughter at Claire’s use of air quotes and even Castiel can appreciate the accuracy of the girl’s impression of him. He shoots Dean a look, trying for deadpan but it melts instantly since he’s greeted by the sight of Dean wearing Jack’s neon colored paper crown and Jack wearing Dean’s red plaid scarf like a little babushka.
Castiel stands for another moment in the middle of the room, processing the last twenty minutes. He can’t, not really, and huffs a laugh before slinging his coat through the strap of the diaper bag and slinging the strap over his shoulder. Maybe he’ll see Dean at Claire’s next check-up. Castiel certainly hopes so.
Dean sits dumbly, taken completely aback by the sudden offer. He believes Cain about it being a favor between friends and the reality of actually being able to be friends with Cain is starting to sink in a little in Dean’s slow brain. But practicalities first. “ What about the family? They don’t know me from Adam. Will they be okay with a strange man living next door?” He says it like a joke, but he’s very serious about it. Dean isn’t about to make some single mom uncomfortable with her kids playing in the yard because of him, and he doesn’t blame any parent for being wary of strangers around their kids.
And if he wonders if his ass looks okay in the raggedy pajama pants while climbing the steps, well, he’s only human.
It’s quiet again, the minutes stretching out as they rest. Castiel is reasonably certain Dean’s eyes have been closed for some time. Finally sleeping, he expects. So he startles slightly when Dean’s rough whisper disturbs the silence. “ Hey, Cas?”
“ She’ll be extorting all sorts of stuff from me.” Dean snorts. “ She’s already eaten half a jar of that lavender honey. Poured it all over a slab of bread and had it after she’d eaten dinner
Claire is the one who opens the kitchen door before they step foot on the stoop. She sticks her blonde head outside, Gabriel’s oversized Y2K novelty glasses obscuring most of her face. “ Dad and Dean are here!”
“ FYI, “ Alex whispers, barely audible over the hum of conversation and A/C. “ Daddy’s a worrier, so go easy on him.”
“ Well, maybe Dean will agree to be your human shield.” Castiel doubts that highly, but the image is amusing.
“ Uh…” Is it? Is everything okay? The question and immediate answer that pops into his head is enough to jolt Dean back to functional. Though still a bit panicked. “ Yeah, uh, I just… I gotta go.” He shoves his phone in back pocket and tries to shoulder past his brother.
But Castiel can see the blush again rising in the high cheekbones, notices the embarrassed quirk of those full lips. He sits up, stretching slowly to ease the kinks in his back and shoulders. Dean’s gaze remains steady as he wiggles out of the damp panties, holding them awkwardly until Castiel takes them and tosses them, along with his own boxers, into the hamper in the corner. Another baby wipe because he’s come to love the convenience of them and keeps a pack in practically every room now.
Cas looks confused, but a smile is curving the corners of his mouth. Crinkling around his eyes. “ Not the response I expected, but I’m glad I haven’t upset you.”
