Then John pulls away and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. “I can’t wait to get you out of this tuxedo, but first, you have an opera to experience. We’ve got to go. Greg’s waiting for us.”
Sherlock mutters, “A little late for that, don’t you think?” and drops his head to the mattress just as John gives him a swat. Without much energy, he says, “Ow.”
Molly threw her arms around him. Her body was warm and soft, and he didn’t want to let go of her. He owed her his life, and now he was sending her off into who knows what. “Oh, John. Be careful,” she whispered against his neck.
When Sherlock is out of earshot, Myc drains his glass and sets it down a bit harder than necessary. “I can tell that my brother has feelings for you. I’m just not satisfied yet that you aren’t a danger to him. Physically or mentally. ‘Out of the frying pan, into the fire’ so to speak.”
The crowd falls back from the unsteady and obviously drunk man, with many looking away in embarrassment. When he reaches them, Myc tries to take control of the situation. “Dad, let me make the introductions. This is Ms. Hudson,” but that is as far as he gets.
Sure enough, there are several police cars outside the hospital when Greg drops Sherlock off. There are nurses and orderlies in the hallways, and Sherlock has the weird feeling that they’re looking at him as he passes by, but attributes it to his lousy mood and brushes it off. When Sherlock enters the lab, he sees several hospital security guards and two uniformed male police officers, one tall and one short, talking to Dr. Sawyer. Molly and Jim are standing some distance away. He has his arm around her and her head is buried in his shoulder.
Sherlock sits and picks up the menu distractedly. “Oh, um, thank you.” He looks down and fastens up one of the buttons.  “I don’t have too many opportunities to wear it.”
I’m going to punish you in a way that will help you remember. You’re going to stand in the corner and think about what you’ve done. Do you need to use the loo?”
John starts a running commentary, “Look at you, look how ready you are. So beautiful, so sexy. Perfect, the way you move for me. You’re ripe and luscious, I want to eat you…” The words are pouring over Sherlock, bathing him, filling an emptiness he didn’t know was there. “You’re going to feel so good. No one else gets to see it. No one else gets to make you feel so good, you gorgeous boy. My sweet boy. Let go for me, I want you to come. Come all over yourself, over my hand. Come, Sherlock.”
There is a softness against his skin, velvety but still slightly irritating to his raw flesh. John has covered him with a blanket. The mattress shifts and John is beside him under the covers, rubbing his back again, lips pressed to his forehead, gentle and undemanding.
“Charles Magnussen,” said the tall, distinguished-looking man in the suit. I’m originally from Denmark. I’m in the information business.” He did not elaborate further.
The beautiful dark-haired woman that John had pointed out in the box opposite them takes the arm of the auburn-haired woman next to her and says, “No promises, John. I’m Irene and this is my partner, Kate.” She reaches across to shake his hand and says to John, “Oh, look at those cheekbones. Brilliant and gorgeous. Well done, Doctor Watson.”
She opens the door and practically bounds over to him, all smiles and swishing hair, carrying a Steak ‘N Shake bag. “Hi, Sherlock! I was hoping I’d catch you working today. I brought you dessert,” she says, sitting beside him before pulling two milkshakes from the bag and handing him one. I hope you like chocolate.”
John says, “Thirty-six” and Sherlock can hear the grin in his voice. He groans and John uses the tips of his fingers to tickle the silky skin of his cock.
“Sherlock, I’ve seen you in your room when you didn’t know I was watching. You dance, and you know what? You're not half bad. You’ve got some moves, kid.”
“We’re going to die, aren’t we?” She addressed the question to John. It was settled now that John was the leader. Even Anderson conceded it.
Annie nods. “Bondage is no joke. I’m pretty damn good, but all it takes is one mistake. And rope can go very bad, very quickly. I won’t be able to tell if something doesn’t feel right for you. It’s your responsibility to let me know.”
He slides his T-shirt over his head for the second time today. He folds it, just because he figures John would like it better than him just leaving it in a pile. He doesn’t notice that the man and his wishes have slipped into his head. Socks, belt, then jeans, and even though he could slip his boxers off at the same time, he stalls, trying to keep one more layer between his skin and whoever might be looking in. He turns so that one hip is to the window and the other is towards the door. His gaze moves from one to the other but then focuses on the door, remembering the prize waiting behind it. The boxers drop and he turns the doorknob.
“Oh, John.” It’s almost a whisper. And then Sherlock is in his arms. The hug is so tight that John can barely draw a breath, but he doesn’t care. The only thing that matters is that he has Sherlock, and he’s never going to let anyone hurt him again. He will do anything to keep him safe. He can feel his boyfriend’s heart pounding against his chest and warm breath on his neck. He could stay this way all day. In fact, he would like nothing better than to take Sherlock to bed right now and make love to him in the softest, tenderest way. To show him how much he is cherished. But there will be time for that later.
Sherlock shifts again, his bony ass finding no comfort on the unforgiving surface, then grits his teeth and says, “Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir.”
He checks his watch, taking comfort from the links as he runs his fingers over them. Eight forty-five. He’s sure John will let him stew till nine thirty at least.
John runs his hand up the back of Sherlock’s long leg and over the curve of his ass, pausing there and giving it a squeeze. “What? Oh, uh, scrimshanker, it’s an army thing, like a skiver. Or what do you youngsters call it? Slacker? Never mind! Get up before I decide to fuck you and you throw me off schedule.”
“Sherlock, you just spit out fifty dollars worth of caviar!” says John, and Sherlock can hear the laughter in his voice.
John is waiting for him, seated on a low-backed wooden chair, still dressed. Sherlock closes the door behind him and stands there, not sure what to do or where to put his hands. John solves the problem by holding out his hand and saying, “Come, beautiful boy, I want you to kneel here in front of me.” When Sherlock reaches him, John points to the carpet, and Sherlock folds himself down so he’s sitting on his heels, his feet stretched flat. “That’s it. Now, hands behind your back and take hold of your elbows. Like that.”
John walks over to the bed and rummages in the night table while Sherlock slides his briefs off, stretches out on the floor, gets his hands under his shoulders, and rises up on his toes. John returns and Sherlock hears the familiar sound of the lube cap snapping open. He turns to see John lying down on the floor next to him, his palm full of the slightly green, sour apple smelling substance, Sherlock’s favorite of their flavored lubes.
Sherlock stands outside of #1410, heart pounding, trying to get himself under control before knocking.
“That’s still true. You broke two other rules on Saturday. If you had followed those, I wouldn’t have let you break the other one.” He pauses. “You don’t know.”
. He was BORED. Sherlock’s brain was zinging about, but it had nothing to latch onto. His rapid-fire thoughts needed either an outlet or a dose of something to calm them. Since John and Sherlock had been together, he promised John that he would not resort to self-medication, and he had kept his word. He paced the floor, looking at his watch. He wondered what kind of a case Lestrade had for him. He hoped that it would not be dull.
JW:    Obedience is about the choices you make. Our tests came back. We’re both clean health-wise. Yours was positive for THC (pot), but I expect the next test to be perfect.
“So, Lestrade thinks it’s the research assistant,” John said. "Makes sense, I mean Carey must have known or at least not been afraid of his killer, right? Otherwise, why the two glasses? Any idea of what they were arguing about?"
Next, they explored their accommodations and found little of interest. The small bathroom contained only a toilet and sink, with no mirror. There was a bar of soap, a few hand towels, a single toothpaste tube, and eight travel toothbrushes. The main room contained nothing but the table and moulded plastic chairs. It was as much a prison as the Shawshank Penitentiary in the story John had read on the plane and, just as impenetrable. Yet in the story, Andy Dufresne had made it out. They didn’t have years to dig through these walls, a teaspoon at a time, like Andy, but maybe they could still find a way.
So Sherlock does it again. And again. It’s not bad, not at all. And John is groaning and has reached back to spread himself. Sherlock dips down, licking the delicate skin of John’s balls before moving upwards again and circling the pucker with his tongue.
John released Sherlock and paced back and forth in front of him, running his fingers through his hair.
John thought of the photo on the cover of the magazine, with Sherlock looking so aloof and mysterious. He had said he didn’t get on with people. But right now, he seemed a completely different person. He was showing off certainly, but other than snorting and rolling his eyes when Molly guessed Mrs White in the conservatory with the rope, he was almost charming.
“Come here,” John says quietly, and Sherlock obeys, walking meekly to stand beside John in the hall.
And so, Sherlock keeps his hands on the glass as John continues to thrust into him with long, deep strokes until Sherlock’s thighs begin to tremble. Then, John lets go of his collar and grips his hips with both hands. “OK, you can touch, you can come now.”
Sherlock struggles within himself. Will John be angry if he can’t? Will he really stop?  He wants it. He thought he wanted it, but suddenly it carries too much weight. He hears his father’s voice and tries to silence it.
Sherlock rises to his knees and places his hands on the mattress. His dick is half hard, and he wants to touch it or wants John to. Instead, John nudges his legs apart then uses his thumbs very gently on Sherlock's ass cheeks to spread them. He feels John blow air across his burning skin and on the unmarked but sensitive area now exposed. The anticipation is excruciating.
The fingers continue their journey between his buttocks and gently rub his hole before continuing forward to the sensitive skin behind his balls. On the way back, John slides over again and Sherlock sighs and presses back against him, but John pulls away.
. Despite the seriousness of his situation, despite his fear, and his anger at being falsely accused, despite all of this, the fact that John is here makes him smile with happiness he can’t contain, and he sees John’s mouth form his name as their eyes meet.
Disregarding the security cameras in the elevator, they can’t keep their hands off one another on the ride to the fourteenth floor. When they entered the elevator, John had activated the vibrator and then grabbed his ass, pulling their bodies together as Sherlock let his hands roam over John’s back. Now outside the condo, Sherlock is leaning against the wall, barely able to stand, as John fumbles with the keycard. At last, they are inside, and John immediately pushes Sherlock against the door and kisses him roughly.
Ignoring the question and the look, Sherlock says, “Dad, you’re still going to graduation tomorrow, right?”
“I’ve never let anyone else close. After losing Eurus, and you, and my parents. I wasn’t going to let myself get hurt again. But yet here I am…” Sherlock gave a sad little laugh.
Frothing red spittle dribbled from the man’s mouth, and his eyes were bulging as he struggled to breathe. John looked up to see Molly, trembling from head to foot, a hand over her mouth.
John confirms. “This is the bedroom and this chair is for your clothes. From now on, you’re to take them off before you enter. I’ll wait for you inside.” John closes the door behind him. Sherlock is frozen in place for a moment, then looks behind him, checking to see whether he’s standing in full view of the window, the way he thinks he is. His cock tingles. He is. He tells himself that no one could possibly see in. They’re fourteen floors up. It doesn’t keep him from worrying that he’s about to flash his ass at half of Ohio.
John sniffs and wrinkles his nose. “Ew, you're right.” They both chuckle and it breaks the somber mood.
The other inmates look at him with curiosity. He does look out of place here. For one thing, he seems to be the only one without tattoos. And the youngest. He finds himself wishing he hadn’t shaved to spite John this morning. At least he’d look a little tougher. His eyes dart around the cell, evaluating each potential aggressor and he tucks the notebook under his shirt.
“I need to rest,” Sherlock announced. As he sat on a rock, John retrieved the plastic cup from the duffel and filled it in the stream, allowing them both to drink.
Finally, Friday night arrives and Sherlock goes to sleep early, but wakes at six in a sticky puddle. He hasn’t had a wet dream since he was fourteen. It’s still just as embarrassing. But mostly he’s upset because the only thing he can remember about it is swallowing around John’s cock as he came down his throat. He feels cheated somehow. He texts John, partly just to be safe, and partly as an excuse to make contact.
, his brain chanted over and over. This was a mistake that not even a first year history student would make. He had fallen in love, and made his feelings known to a contemp, in an era where homosexuality was illegal. Holmes would have every right to turn him in; he could go to jail, and there’s no way Dunworthy would be able to get him out.
They kissed again, John deepening the kiss but still keeping his mouth closed, not wanting to overwhelm Holmes. He allowed his hand to caress Holmes’ cheek, then travel down along his shoulder and arm, and settle on Holmes’ waist. Even through the layers of wool, John could feel how thin the man was, but there was a layer of muscle, of contained power. He sighed and pulled Holmes closer.
‘Weird cases lately,’ Lestrade had said. And they had been. Normally Sherlock never thought about a case again after it was solved, but the cases over the past few months had been increasingly bizarre. And while most criminals were generally stupid, the culprits lately did not seem to have the intelligence to pull off the crimes that they had. And yet they had.
John sat and stared after him for a moment, a little shocked and unsure what Sherlock’s eruption was about. He shrugged.
Two sets of hands grappled at the closure at Sherlock’s throat, but the water of the Persephone Sea had tightened the material in its silken knot. Sherlock yanked at it uselessly, growling with frustration. “I can’t – I-”
“I did come directly off stage after three hours of dancing,” Sherlock said. “Sorry about the sweat.” He pried the insole up, extracted the chip, and placed it in Mycroft’s palm. Mycroft immediately transferred it to his handkerchief.
Jim picked up the iron kettle, pouring hot water over the cups and teapot to warm them. “To be honest, I was surprised you contacted me, that you even looked at my proposal. I wouldn’t have been surprised if you hadn’t – you don’t know me from Adam.”
“Rest assured I know exactly what that feels like. To feel concreted to the earth in paralyzing fear, unable to move, unable to think of what to do next because you don’t know which breath will be your last. I did not bring you here to do that to you. I brought you here to ask you to be my flatmate. Ease the burden of your everyday life. All I ask is an exchange.”
"There is a security camera on the building to your left. Do you see it?" A hard suave voice on the voice spoke on the line. For the second time that night John's heart beat fast in his chest, paralyzing him to the spot and even a chill running down his spine.
“Yes. This is Dr. John Watson. He is assisting me tonight. John this is Lestrade.” Sherlock introduced him to the Inspector and they shook hands.
Sherlock’s face snapped to John’s and then down to his hand that had enwrapped itself in his. His bouncing leg instantly came to a cease.
The nature of her question left him baffled that she would ask such a thing. He thought for a moment and rather than letting Sherlock risk his career over his presence maybe it would better if he backed out of the situation if it was going to be a problem. He could always watch him from the sidelines.
Seemed like word traveled fast, however it always did in the Daily Prophet. No doubt half of England had heard of his unfortunate latest excursion.
The rest of the cab ride was in silence from Sherlock’s own personal confession. In some ways John could understand how Sherlock felt. He had felt those same feelings while he was deployed. Away from family, living in a land different than your own, and not even sure if you would see home again. Sure it was a culture shock and one got used to it after awhile, but to constantly do it for years even decades sounded unfathomable. He was 37 and the younger generation now seemed strange to him. What would he feel like once he was 60? 70? Only time could tell.
“If you mean that he closed out my flat two weeks before snatching me off the street because this flat was better I guess I could say…both."
"Splendid. The violin doesn't bother you any? I play when I'm thinking. Often times I get so caught up I may not talk for days on in and you must not think me sulky or depressive. Just let me alone and I'll soon be right. Flat mates should know the worst of each other, don't you think?"
Well this was certainly news to him. He hadn't expected there to be another besides the elderly woman. Then again maybe it would be better off to have male company instead of her. He wouldn't want to have people talking and giving them the wrong impression or either frightening her half to death if he brought home a lady friend. John cautiously climbed the stairs with effort and came to the landing of the next floor. The door was already open to display a large sitting room with boxes and furniture scattered around in no particular order and with no soul in sight. Hesitantly, he went through the threshold to announce his presence.
“More along the lines of great-great uncle per say. It is by some miraculous chance that we share the same bloodline.” The man explained as he stood and readjusted his suit.
“I used to go to one hotel to dine when the time permitted it. When I wasn’t chasing criminals. They served the most exquisite roasted pheasant with rosemary, glazed carrots, asparagus with hollandaise, and when I had a sweet tooth, a tiramisu. Their merlot wine was smooth and fruity.” Sherlock stated in a dream like voice as he came to.
“You were tired after your shift. Of course you don’t remember.” Sherlock hurried with a response barely making a glance over his shoulder.
“I have some questions myself if you don't mind. If you didn’t kidnap me to harm me then what do you want? I know nothing about you, who you are or where I am. And I’m not answering anything until you tell me.”
John took off his jacket and started to put on the garment when he noticed Sherlock only picked up a pair of latex gloves not bothering to put on the suit he and the Inspector were wearing.
"I know you done some healing training at St. Mungo's and got your Master Healer's License in Magical Medicine. You practically are a doctor in their world."
“On whether or not I have…I see. Well, I think you can thank your over obsession with my condition and say yes. And before you ask, no, I’m not showing you my deformed canines.”
"You were thinking. It's annoying." John shared a look to the Inspector beside him who looked equally as confused as John. He didn't know how to read minds, right? John shook his head at the ridiculous thought of this muggle reading minds. No he clearly proved himself in the cab ride to the crime scene. He just saw and observed. He now watched Sherlock as he glided across the room, looking, making mental notes in his mind, circling the dead woman on the floor. He reminded him of a trained blood hound searching for a scent. Anything that would lead him onto the right path.
He finished with his scarf and made his way down the stairs. This was the first time John had seen the vampire so flustered over words. In the short time he had known him he knew he was sharp witted and knew exactly what he wanted to say. All he could think of was maybe it was an old saying from his day, a way to get ready, to go out. Not unless he thought he took it the wrong way and thought it had a more military feel to the words.
"Come on Mike. Tell me about him?" John asked as he followed Mike down to the hallway of the hospital.
Looking on, John was just the same not three months prior. Anytime the Auror office had a new case or lead he was gone in a flash. Never staying in one place for too long. He decided that this was indeed a smidge of jealously he felt at the muggle. One who in mere hours, if all went smoothly, he would never see again, and in return the man would never know of John. He would just be another face in the crowd.
John was slightly taken aback. First off that this talk was really going to happen and secondly that Sherlock’s vampirism was so…dull. In some ways he was relieved, yet in an odd sense, disappointed. Maybe his thoughts about it all had been too big and too broad. Overshadowing the real picture which that was that, he was ordinary. But his mind still didn't comprehend it all. He needed details.
“Oh I think you will be regretting those words. Evening.” The window rolled up and the car drove off.
“Be more careful next time. Others have not been as fortunate as you. If…something had happened…I do not think I could have forgiven myself.”
John's eyes drifted up the building closest to him and there perched on the corner was a security camera gazing down upon the wizard.
“I am not a hound, John.” Sherlock said as he lit his cigarette and exhaled the fumes from his mouth. “In theory and thinking I see your reasoning, but it is not all that simple. A suspect may leave their scent at the crime scene, but if left to the elements it can die out. And the suspect can easily wash off the victim’s blood off their person. You see to me the scent of a person and the scent of blood are two distinct smells. One is created by the natural hormones of the body that can be sweat or odor. And depending on the body the smell can range based on their lifestyle and health. The other, made by blood, is a scent all on its own. Since blood contains Iron atoms there is a metallic note to it. Some have it stronger than others. Even right now I could probably pinpoint here on the street who has a wound and who does not simply by following the smell of blood.”
He glanced at the tore edges, looked up and shook his head again. “I’m not going and I don’t want to become a lawyer.”
John stood up after he left, put the dirty dishes in the sink and strolled towards the bathroom to take a shower.
After Sherlock reached the last page of the newspaper, he folded it in half and put it on the table. “John, you have to eat. You can’t start your day on an empty stomach.”
John gazed at him from behind and smiled. Sherlock was attracted to him. He cast his eyes down. Should he make the first move or should he wait until Sherlock was ready to make a move?
“Don’t worry. I’ll figure something out.” He hurried out of the lab and went downstairs to the HR office. He inquired about a telephone number for Sherlock’s next of kin, but they refused to give it to him if he didn’t have permission from him or from the head of HR.
He drummed his fingers on the trolley while watching the nurses making his bed. “Why am I back here, I’m not crazy?”
When they returned after a few hours, Greg called Sally, a detective and Anderson, a forensics expert, who’s working on the case with him to his office and introduced them to Sherlock.
Simon took his t-shirt off and dropped it on the floor. “May I,” he asked. As soon as Sherlock nodded with approval, he took off his shirt and chucked it aside. He pushed him gently backwards and lay on top of him. His breathing sped up while brushing his crotch against the bulge in Sherlock’s shorts. “Pull up your legs,” he murmured.
Sherlock’s head hit the doorframe. He turned around, crawling on his backside into the room trying to get away from his professor.
Greg moved his chair back and traced his fingers across Mycroft’s arm while leaning over to him. “I’ll make it up to you, say tonight.”
Greg stared at the taxi driving off. Goodness, not even six hours on the case and he solved it. He could be an asset to the station.
Sherlock gazed at the handsome man in front of him. He pulled a face. “So, I have to be alone for another week.”
She nodded and carried on talking about the boy. “Sherlock never brings him home. He’s mostly at that boy’s house.”
Sherlock’s face dulled. “Not now.” He put the violin down, grabbed the phone from John and dialed Mycroft’s number. “What now, don’t you think Britain can wait?” He sighed and shut his eyes as he listened while his brother explained. “Fine, I’ll do it.” He pulled a face and chucked the phone on the couch.
Sherlock popped another one of the tablets from the sachet after he arrived at his flat. He took the violin and played on it until late.
Simon brushed his finger over Sherlock’s cheek. “I hope you change your mind.” He smiled while watching his beautiful man walking away. He started the engine and waited until Sherlock entered the building before he drove off.
Half an hour later, John stood in front of the apartment building he called home for three years. He smiled as he glanced at the doorknocker slanting to the right and shook his head before opening the door.
Sherlock resigned his position in the lab at St. Bartholomew hospital. He didn’t have the time to work there, as well as solving cases. With a good word from Mycroft, the CEO of the hospital granted him permission to use the lab whenever he needed it. It suited him. His bachelor’s flat was too small. There wasn’t enough space to put up the new microscope he bought along with other necessary lab equipment.
An hour later, he took his violin and started playing. A knock on the door distracted him. He started over and stopped again when another knock followed. He grimaced when he put the violin down.
John’s eyes enlarged when the music came drifting towards him. He wrapped a towel around his waist and stepped out of the bathroom. He leaned against the doorway, watching him. “That’s beautiful,” he said after Sherlock stopped.
Sherlock opened his eyes when the taxi stopped in front of his flat. He paid the cabby, jumped out and rushed up the stairs.
While working on another case Lestrade and his team couldn’t solve, Sherlock fell asleep next to the microscope. He was alone at the lab and it was already past midnight.
Simon traced his fingers over Sherlock’s slender hands. “You can tell me when you’re ready.” He kissed him on the cheek before he let go of his hand. “When can I see you again?”
“Keep it, you have to practice.” She took it from him when he shook his head. “I’m here every day, except on Sundays.”
“Right. Sorry,” John says, placing a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “Ms. Hudson, it’s clear that you want what’s best for Sherlock. I want you to know that I do as well. I hope we can be friends. For his sake.”
She was standing just inside the doorway, holding a plate of biscuits and a small book. Her mouth was drawn into an ‘o’ shape, and her eyes were wide. Sherlock’s eyes met hers, and he froze. They stood there for what seemed an eternity, neither speaking, Sherlock’s mind racing to come up with a plausible explanation.
“What’s wrong? There’s enough wine, there’s red and white...” Sherlock says, bewildered, as they pass the kitchen and head down the hallway toward Sherlock’s room. Once inside, John closes the door and pivots, pinning Sherlock against it.
Off come the shoes and shorts, then the soaked and sticky briefs. “I think I’ll just throw these away and go home commando,” Sherlock says and drops them into the trash can as John hands him paper towels from the dispenser over the sink.
Yet now, something interesting has finally happened to him. He thinks of John Watson’s eyes on him at dinner tonight, and a shiver runs up his spine. The older, sophisticated man wants him, and this thought is almost unbelievable. Even more, John had talked with him like an adult, seemed interested in what he had to say.
He is going to dinner with a total stranger tonight. A stranger who had brazenly stated his intention to whip him and fuck him. He'd left the ball in Sherlock’s court, and Sherlock had just returned it. He lost his nerve the first time, clicking off before John picked up. Shaken. He was usually much more in control. The grandmaster of control, in fact, until this man had walked into his life and turned it upside down in the space of a few hours. Perhaps life in the Midwest was not as boring as he thought.
John was about to make a retort. Yes, Sherlock was a bloody genius, but John wasn’t an idiot, and he resented Sherlock’s superior attitude. But before he could formulate a snarky comeback, the answer dawned on him.
John is looking at him intently, his own lips parted. After a moment, he pulls his finger from Sherlock’s mouth and grasps his chin lightly. Sherlock wonders if John is about to kiss him. He desperately
Sherlock had never been kissed before, and the shock of it was paralyzing. But when Victor's tongue slid into his mouth, he groaned and felt his cock spring to life as the heat of desire radiated through his body. Victor released Sherlock’s wrists and buried his fingers in his hair as Sherlock wrapped his arms around his friend, desperate not to lose contact with his mouth. As they kissed, a puzzle piece fell into place. The unspeakable thing that had simmered under the surface of their friendship was still unspoken but undeniable. It felt right. It felt good. And he wanted more.
Instead, they take a shower together, washing away the sweat of the long, hot day, and enjoying each other’s bodies. It’s not the spectacular sex that Sherlock might have wished for John’s birthday, but he revels in the tenderness of it, sweet and slow and sensual, with soft kisses and gentle bites. Bites just hard enough to remind Sherlock of his place and his submission, wet skin sliding against wet skin, low murmurs and moans of pleasure. As the water streams hot over their bodies, carrying the mingled evidence of their lovemaking down the drain, Sherlock, weak-kneed, sits down on the shower bench and looks up at John.
“That guy with the cap pulled low on his head? Cop. He keeps reaching for a holster that isn’t there and he can’t help looking at everyone in the crowd. And those shoes? Only cops. The skinny guy behind him is staying behind him because he knows he’s a cop and the way he keeps wiping his nose, with his sleeve? He’s amped up too high to realize he should drop back to get away from the cop, but he doesn’t want to lose sight of him, so paranoia means it’s either coke or poppers. Poppers don’t last that long, so probably coke.”
“Now think about us going to dinner tonight. Think about yourself on your knees under the table, your head underneath the kilt, sucking me off while I sip my drink.”
Sherlock stands with his tray, looking at the tables filling up with men. There don’t seem to be many good options. Most of the guys look pretty rough, and others appear to have mental health issues, muttering to themselves or rocking compulsively. He looks at Wiggy and raises his eyebrows.
John caresses his left cheek and says, “All finished. You can get up now. It’s going to feel strange and uncomfortable for a while. You’ll be very aware of it, but it shouldn’t hurt. Let me know right away if it does, right?”
His ass is on fire with the third and fourth blows and John touches him, the contrast between his cool hand and Sherlock’s hot skin isn’t comforting at all. Five, six, he’s halfway through and breathing heavily.
Sherlock’s good eye opened slightly, and he appeared to be trying to focus. “oonnn.” The sound was more like a croak than a word. John’s heart sank. All of his fears were being realized. Sherlock wasn’t dead, but he looked like he should be.
Sherlock explored John's body with as much enthusiasm as if it were a crime scene, smelling, touching, learning. He wanted to know everything about John, he wanted to devour him and even more, he wanted to be devoured. And he wanted it NOW. He had waited for this night for so long. They both had. And now they were making up for that lost time as they fumbled and stroked and sucked and then...Oh, dear god, John was inside Sherlock and it was sublime--for both of them. John grunted and Sherlock sighed. They still hadn't spoken. The creaking of the bed and the muffled sounds from the pub below were the only sounds as they moved together.
“Are you kidding, Myc? I’m totally psyched. Getting out of Ohio is something I’ve always dreamed about. And
For the second time this evening, John unbuckles the belt and pulls it from the loops. He holds it near Sherlock’s face. “Maybe with your belt, yeah?” John whispers, and Sherlock’s stomach flips. John unfastens his pants, and they drop to the floor. He feels hands on his hips, and the boxers slide slowly down to join the trousers. He steps out of them and stands naked before John. He can feel John’s eyes travel over his body.
After hanging up with Harry, he tried Mary’s number. It went to voicemail, and he found himself almost relieved. “Mary, It’s John. I’m safe. I’m sure you’ve seen it on the news. I’m safe! So much has happened and I want to tell you all about it. It looks like I’ll be here in the States for another week or so. They want me to stay, to answer questions on the hijacking and all.” This was a lie, of course.  He covered the phone with his hand and spoke to the driver. “May I keep the phone?” She nodded.
“It was a team effort, but yeah, he’s clever.” John looks toward Sherlock’s bedroom. The door is still closed. “Look Myc, I’ve really gotta go, but I’ll call you later. I want to know what I can do to help.”
“You did a good thing, Dr Watson. If you ever get tired of that doctor gig, give us a call. We’ve got offices in London and could use a man like you.”
When his cock brushes against the hand beneath him, he lowers himself a little more, to increase contact and John says, “You know, the lower you go, the fewer you’ll be able to finish.”
Sherlock chuckled too. “I assumed that you had. It’s just so much less trouble to date a hunk of silicone than an actual person. People are…disappointing.”
good, Wiggy. We have our Sherlock back because of your help.” Molly places a hand on Wiggy’s arm, and he blushes, then turns to Sherlock.
Sherlock sneaks a quick peek around to see if anyone’s near. It’s so dark now that it’s unlikely they’ll be seen from the path but the slatted ceiling of the shelter, meant to diffuse the sun’s rays during the day, lets in stripes of moonlight. One of these stripes falls across John’s face and Sherlock looks into the deep blue eyes as he strokes himself. John’s eyes are locked on his, and his right hand rests on the top of Sherlock’s head. The gaze is intense and the tip of John’s tongue peeks between his lips as he watches him masturbate.
Sighing, John stopped at the vending machines and got a coffee and two bags of crisps before taking a seat in the waiting area. He grimaced as he tasted the coffee. “Bloody awful.” He ripped open one of the bags. They had fed him at the CIA field office, but he was still hungry after so long without food.
And now, out of nowhere, here Johnny—John—was. He sensed that John had felt the connection between them, but there had been no recognition. It was his nose, most likely. It wasn’t the same after the accident, the one that had left him with physical and emotional scars, including the fear of flying. He had considered revealing his identity until he found out about the fiancée, and his fledgeling hope was crushed. The dinner invitation had been an impulse. He couldn’t bear to let John leave his life again just yet.
John continues whispering endearments and praise while stroking Sherlock’s hair. The words are just a low rumble, comforting, like background music, as his mind drifts and his usually racing thoughts seem to move in slow-motion.
“If no one volunteers, I’m going to have to pick someone,” she warned, still with that sunny smile on her face. She looked almost gleeful.
Still kneeling, he squirts lube onto his fingers and puts his other hand behind one of Sherlock’s knees, pushing it toward his chest. He slowly circles the pucker and then slides one slick finger in. Sherlock concentrates on relaxing.
“Yes. And we think that with her recommendation, and if you do well enough on the entrance exams, that you’ll stand a very good chance. But you’ll have to work hard,
John nods approvingly at the slim silhouette. "Stunning. I like theway the fabric catches the light."  As Martin turns him around, Sherlock looks down and the color of the suit seems to shimmer and change from gray to navy blue.
John leans his forehead against Sherlock’s and whispers into his hair, “It’s just a watch, don’t worry about it. It isn’t important.”
John hushes him, “I know, I know you are, but it’s all over now. No more apologies. You’re forgiven. You don’t have to worry about it anymore. The punishment is done. We start fresh now. It’s all in the past.” He strokes the back of Sherlock’s head and allows him to cry. When he's all cried out, John takes him by the hand and leads him to the bed, where he helps him to lie down on his side and holds him until the shuddering breaths slow and then even out. “Feel better now?”
“Look at you two. Johnny, I don’t think I’ve ever seen you so happy. I have to say, Sherlock, I didn’t believe him when he said he’d never felt like this before, but I believe him now. Congratulations. You may finally have grounded Captain ‘Three Continents’ Watson.”
“Actually, I’ve been wanting to talk about it, not the car, but what’s going to happen to me when the summer’s over.”
Sherlock gasps, and John chuckles. “You are going to be so open for me tonight.” He pulls Sherlock’s hips back against his body.
“I’m in Franklin County Jail, Myc. I’m sorry…” The story tumbles out, and Myc has to ask him to slow down several times. He’s ashamed to be crying in front of his big brother, something he hasn’t done since he was little, but he can’t help it. He’s so alone, the misery is overwhelming, and he lets it come. Lets it come as Myc listens.
“You’re balancing college-level equations. You're smart. You're overqualified for this place. And you're definitely qualified to tell me which one of these crops you would most like me to whip that sweet, skinny arse with until you beg me to stop,” says the man, with a smile on his face. As he says this, he places the tip of the crop he is holding between Sherlock’s legs and draws it slowly over Sherlock’s crotch and up his stomach and chest until it rests beneath his chin. "Right before I fuck you," he adds.
almost escape before he swallows them. It’s not that he’s worried about adding to the tally. Because he’s not afraid of more strokes. But this isn’t the time for stupid, arbitrary rules. He doesn’t want anything to interfere with what he’s about to do. Yes, John is the Dom, and he has committed to obeying him, but right now all Sherlock can think about is his mom. Can’t John see that? Can’t he put aside his need to be in control for this one morning? It’s not like he’s going to starve to death if he misses one breakfast. He gives John a half-hearted smile that isn’t quite a yes or a no, then turns his gaze back to the box.
. It was so different from kissing a girl. Girls were all softness and curves and perfume. As he pressed against Will, he felt angles and bones and muscles, and it was an incredible turn-on.
After a few minutes, John says, “I’m going to go out for a while. I want you to finish earning your clothes back by writing those apology notes. You’ll find paper on my desk. There is plenty to eat if you’re hungry, and you should try to get as much rest as you can. Do some deep breathing and stretching, arms up and out to the side. It will help with the healing. I’ll be back by dinner time.” He lifts Sherlock’s chin with his finger. “Can I trust you to stay here alone?”
He appraises himself in the mirror and thinks he looks pretty good. Even his hair, normally an unruly mop, looks stylish thanks to a large quantity of product. He makes a pretend gun with his fingers and pulls a serious face. “Bond. James Bond,” he says to his reflection in a terrible British accent. He’ll have to work on that.
“Driven right through him and into the wall. His PA found him hanging there Tuesday morning when she got there about nine. Molly tells us he had been dead for eight to ten hours, so he was probably killed late Monday night.”
“Ha, ha, very funny. No, I just don’t like him, and John doesn’t either. We were worried about you Saturday.”
SH:   Hurry up. I don’t know anyone here. So far just a bunch of doctors and the neighbors. I’m not gonna make it.
He held on to this thought. It repeated like a mantra in his mind. He sighed as the water continued to run, and steam drifted around him. He was no longer shivering, but everything hurt, his head and his ribs and his back and his right hand where instead of five manicured nails, there were now three.
The pain seems distant as he focuses on the sensation of John’s skin against his, from his lips all the way down to his knees. It is everything, and at the same time, not nearly enough. He is straddling one of John’s legs and begins to rub himself against his hip, moaning into John’s mouth. John’s hand is tracing his spine, while the other is buried in his hair, holding him in the kiss. When John’s hand roams lower and skims over his ass, Sherlock squirms, trying to escape the friction that reheats the tender skin and increasing the pressure on his swollen cock. Every part of him feels electric and alive, and he is so lost in his own want that he is almost surprised when he feels John’s erection against his hip.
He’s right and they have to pull over a few miles down the road to put up the top and switch seats. John won’t let Sherlock drive in a storm, and there are now rumbles in the distance where the sky is dark and threatening. The convertible top has just clicked into place when the first raindrops hit the windshield. It’s just as well. The adrenaline is still exiting Sherlock’s system and he’d rather not be behind the wheel feeling as unsteady as he does.
“Sanctimonious,” John laughs. "Now that’s a big word. I’m sure your English teachers would be proud.”
,” Sherlock began. The warm nostalgia that John felt when they started this conversation had evaporated. They weren’t Will and Johnny anymore. They were Sherlock and John.
John whistles in appreciation as he fingers the bonds then squints as he takes a closer look at the book. “Mmmm.”
“He should be here any minute. Until he arrives, there is some data entry and cleaning you two can start on. Not glamorous, I know, but it has to be done.”
Moriarty frowned, and his dark eyes flashed with anger. The two men glowered at one another. The room was utterly silent as the hostages, the guards and Mycroft Holmes watched the stare-down with morbid fascination.
The crop is removed, and Sherlock waits. And waits. When the blow comes, it is like white-hot lighting, intense and shocking. It hurts, and it's glorious.
, I might just kill you with my bare hands. Right here,” John challenged. “Believe me. I know how. I could snap your neck before they could get halfway across the room to save you.” John tilted his head at a couple who were sitting on the other side of the lounge.
John had been working long hours, coming home exhausted, without much energy left for Sherlock. A colleague at the surgery had quit, and John was picking up extra shifts. The money came in handy. John’s army pension was modest, and Sherlock’s income from detective work was erratic. If the case was interesting enough, and the client couldn’t pay, Sherlock took the case for the pure fun of it. Fun didn’t pay the rent, however, as John was quick to remind him.
“Oh fuck! Oh, fucking fuck!” Sherlock pants just before he explodes in orgasm. His body shudders violently, back arching off the bed.
“I wonder if I can get Nessun Dorma sheet music for guitar. Will there be other operas this summer? How old are Gary and Billy? I can’t believe there were so many gay couples just...being gay. Can we go to New Hampshire? I’ve never been outside of Ohio and—”
“I’m not going to give you what you want, not yet. I’m going to get myself cleaned up and you are going to finish your work. Is your essay done? The one for the Common App?”
Despite himself, Sherlock tenses up, waiting for the first blow. The noise registers before the sting. He has no time to recover, because, unlike the last time, John’s hand falls like a metronome, quickly and with a rhythm that leaves Sherlock breathless and struggling to process the impact. The heat spreads uniformly across his skin, but it’s not registering as pain yet. Though he knows it’s impossible, he’d swear he can feel the texture of John’s palm and fingers. That touch is worth whatever after-effects he’ll face later. He wonders if that will change when he’s confronted with the paddle, and in a flash of insight understands the necessity of a punishment implement. It will put distance between the two of them, and the loss of intimate contact will be part of the punishment itself.
At that moment, an airplane passes close to the building, the roar of the engines breaking the silence of the otherwise quiet morning. John shifts and squints.
Sherlock looks into John’s blue eyes. There is concern and kindness in them. The only reason he wants to be untied is so that he can wrap his arms around John, hold him tight and never let go. John had stopped when Sherlock said “red” and didn’t seem disappointed in him. “No, Sir, I’m better now. I trust you. Green.”
When they get back, they have a few more drinks and begin to say their goodbyes, thanking Ms. Hudson and Marie, collecting their things, giving hugs all around. Gary and Billy ask about his upcoming birthday, and John tells them that they should be expecting invitations. Sherlock looks at him curiously, but before he can ask a question, he feels a tap on his shoulder and turns with a smile to see Molly. The smile fades at the sight of Jim next to her. He tugs on John’s sleeve and the man mimics Sherlock’s reaction precisely. Molly senses something’s not quite right as she looks between them, but speaks in her usual cheerful voice. “I forgot to mention that Jim and I were meeting up. We’re going to rent kayaks and then get something to eat.”
Sherlock stares at the box as he sits cross-legged on his bed the next morning. He judges it to be eighteen inches by twenty-four inches and ten inches deep. He gets up, goes to his desk, and gets a ruler to measure it. It is eighteen by twenty-four by ten. Exactly. He smiles with satisfaction, running his finger over the tape. Over her words.
inscribed in gold on a blue case. It snaps open, and inside is another note tucked into the lid and two thick gold pens,
“Of course,” John says, licking a bit of frosting from his fingers. “Glad the building let him take a break to watch.”
“Did you forget my portion of the contract? The part where it says care for and help? The part about your well-being? Obedience and submission are difficult, Sherlock. Not for the weak or faint of heart. They’re a tremendous gift to a Dom—Dominant. They’re priceless. Material things?” He snorts. “Besides, at least eighty percent of that suit is for me. I can’t wait to see you in it. And then take you out of it.”
If the others would play their parts, this might just work. If it didn’t, well, that was the risk they were taking. They had all agreed that it was worth it—even Anderson. Stamford, as always, seemed willing to do whatever he was told. Molly was nervous but determined to do her part. Martha, however, seemed to be as keen for action as John. “It feels a bit like a James Bond movie, doesn’t it,” she had said with excitement.
He takes a breath and tries to calm down before continuing. “I’m innocent and I’ve never been arrested before. I’m scared and my boyfriend…well, I don’t think he’s going to be my boyfriend anymore. I’m...sad.” Sherlock starts to choke up and looks at Dr. Hunter apprehensively, but she doesn’t blink an eye, just continues on with her professional instructions.
Stamford sat on his blanket near the table, and Anderson stood not far from the door, his blanket draped around his shoulders, strategically hiding what he held gripped in his hand.
The crowd thins out at the official end of the march, and the four of them retrace their path to Ms. Hudson’s house. As Sherlock is putting his shirt on, John touches his chest and remarks, “You’ve had a bit too much sun, you’re going to be pink tomorrow.” Then leaning a bit closer he says in a low voice, “I’ll see to it that you have an arse to match.” Sherlock shivers a little, whether from the words or his sensitive skin, he’s not sure.
“Ha! I knew I’d seen it! Break it up, you two.” She gestures for John to come to look at her screen. “Here. See? A single spreading column from the box tie and then the harness in the front. I’ll help with the wrap if you’d like to make him pretty. Or we can keep it simple. Want to see how it goes? How long it takes? How much you remember?”
. The waffle is golden brown and smells delicious. He transfers it to a plate before breaking off a corner and popping it into his mouth. Then he drains the berries and searches the fridge for whipped cream, humming to himself all the while.
He thinks about last night and how safe it felt to be curled against John on the sofa, how amazing it felt to have John’s hand on his dick, and most interestingly, how it felt to be exposed and helpless when he was over John’s lap. He switches abruptly to Jimi Hendrix’s “Purple Haze.” He plays the opening notes and chords with intensity and opens his eyes.
“I’m sorry, Sir. Really, really sorry. Please, I take it back. I’ll make it up to you. The guests are will be here! What if someone comes early?”
John comes back to face Sherlock and tosses the crop to the bed, before dropping his robe to the floor. He’s naked, and his thick cock is hard and standing straight out from his tanned, muscular body, less than a foot from Sherlock’s face. John takes it in his hand and begins stroking himself.
Molly just doesn’t understand. John won’t abandon him. He promised he wouldn’t. And he believes him. Wants to believe him. He closes his eyes and remembers last night and thinks of the marks he carries on his body, the welts, the bruise on his neck from John’s mouth, and the ones on his thighs from John’s fingers.
Of course. He knows how that initial intrusion feels. No matter how aroused, the body first protests against it, then accepts it, and finally, the pleasure comes. That deep, powerful, mind-blowing pleasure. He will be gentle. He will control himself. He wants John to be proud of him.
“Yes, come for me,” whispers John. Relieved of making a decision, Sherlock comes, head thrown back and mouth open, emitting a loud wail. “Yes, that’s it, good boy.” John says as he continues to stroke. When Sherlock is spent, John rises to his knees. “Watch me, Sherlock, watch what you do to me.” He brings himself to orgasm, decorating Sherlock’s chest with ribbons of semen. Sherlock watches—he can’t take his eyes off him, this man who could have anyone he wants, gorgeous, brilliant, sexy,
“There are some men I know who stick to one or the other and get pretty adamant about it, but for me, they’re just different pleasures. Like wine. Red or white? It depends on what I’m in the mood for.”
“What the fuck?” Sherlock blurts out before he can stop himself. “I’m sorry, but what the actual fuck,
John grips his hair and tilts his head back, exposing his long white neck. He sucks and scrapes, leaving a bruise that will mark him for days. Then, John moves to his nipple and bites hard. Sherlock arches his back, offering the other up for attention, but John ignores it and works the one until Sherlock is squirming.
Sebastian laughs contemptuously. “You gonna make us, fairy?” He takes another step forward and gives Sherlock a hard push.
“No. Wait,” John said, stopping Sherlock by placing two fingers under his chin. Then he reached for the jar of blackberry jam.
Sherlock feels like an object, on display for them and being discussed as if he weren’t in the room. It’s turning him on, and he’s even happier that John let him wear the boxers. He is surprised at how eager he is for this experience. How unafraid. He trusts John, and by extension, Annie. He is slipping into a pliant and willing headspace. He’s submitting. He’s a good boy.
Pete starts spinning in a circle, looking up at the ceiling, yelling. “Hey! You! Whoever you are! Listen up! You heard me? I’m out. No more junk. I quit. And I’m telling the kid to get out!”
Sherlock obeys and looks out into the night. The lamp on the nightstand is on, and anyone looking up would easily see him. He can see people walking on the path below, and the twinkling lights of the bridge over the Scioto River and the skyscrapers beyond it. He realizes that he’s about to be fucked in the window in plain sight of at least a dozen people.
He used his earnings to buy a bag of smack from Pete, who threw in three joints for a birthday present. Pete pretended not to notice Sherlock’s wet knees, but the blonde waitress—Tina—gave him a sad look and tucked a sandwich into his coat pocket, saying, “Honey, you are breakin’ my heart.” He had started “celebrating” that night and spent the next day shit-faced in his bedroom. By the time he remembered the sandwich in his pocket, it was crushed and stale. He ate it anyway.
“I know it’s difficult, but you’ll want to relax as much as you can. I’m going to give you a warm-up with my hand, so you won’t have to worry about bruising as much, and relaxing will help.” He places a hand on the small of Sherlock’s back, and it eases his anxiety a bit. He feels more grounded and secure. “Deep breaths. What’s your color?”
John’s strong hands squeeze and massage his cheeks. Under his breath, he mutters, “Still scrawny, not acceptable,” and gives him a pinch. Sherlock yelps, but John immediately soothes the spot and kisses him behind the ear. “I’ll fatten you up. More to squeeze.” He moves his hands, massaging the sides and tops of Sherlock’s legs. Sherlock sighs with contentment, then gasps when John’s fingers slip down between his legs and squeeze his inner thighs. The backs of his hands brush against his penis, which begins to swell immediately.
He does, and his knees buckle. John catches him with a forearm across his belly and holds him up as he leans forward with his cheek against the window. And then John comes too, and Sherlock can feel the hot wetness and the trickles of semen running down his legs, then breath against his back. Without a word they collapse to the floor, panting.
John's face darkened. "Yeah, sure it is," he said sarcastically. "I’m going out to get some food since this place is a toxic waste dump."  He picked up his jacket and walked out of the flat without kissing Sherlock goodbye.
Sherlock is so excited the morning of the Pride parade, he doesn’t even remember his nicotine patch. From his stool at the breakfast bar, John reminds him to put it on. “Add one to your tally. Rule number?”
When he finishes reading the list, his head is spinning a bit. He’s not sure how he’s going to fit everything in, but he remembers, that’s the plan. John wants to keep him busy. He rummages in the fridge and finds a cup of yogurt, then the cabinets, for a granola bar. Then another one. Maybe he can add a few ounces before he gets on the scale.
“Perhaps,” said Sherlock. “I still think you are making guesses without sufficient data. It may be a rescue operation.”
The depth of John’s fury surprised Sherlock. John had never pushed him in anger before; it wasn't like him at all. For once, Sherlock was speechless.
“Yeah.” Sherlock notices the other boy’s dark eyes shift from Molly to him and narrow a bit when he hears this.
When they finally go back into the living room, Irene waves them over. “If you’ve gotten the ‘wine’ situation under control, we’ve got a surprise for you!” She holds up her phone. Two smiling faces fill the screen and shout “Happy birthday, John!” simultaneously.
“Fantasizing about being the next meal isn’t as cool as it really seems,” John said nonchalantly, but the two men looked back at him with confused expressions. “Never mind. I would assume I would end up missing and or dead.”
Hello dear readers. I'm sorry I have been away for so long. I had to take a small hiatus for my own mental well being and to try and enjoy time with family over the summer. But now that things have calmed down I'm ready to get back into writing and continue on with this story. Now originally I had Chapters 9 and 10 already written back in April but I just saved them on my computer almost finished and never went back to it till now. I promise it's not going to go away anytime soon. I actually have this story mapped out to nearly 20+ chapters so far. So I'm not done yet!
John jumped up and covered himself. “Good god, Sherlock,” he shouted. “I thought you were sleeping.”
He turned around and waved at her. “Sherlock Holmes. Thank you, I will.” He carried on walking while recalling the music she played.
His fingers stopped tracing the letters. He looked up and smiled. “I know,” he said and stood up from the table.
He sauntered over to the door and yanked it open. Sherlock rolled his eyes. He turned around, headed for the couch and sat down, crossing his legs.
He fell down on the couch, lit a cigarette and reached for his phone in his pocket. He typed a text message to his brother and sent it.
Mycroft smiled as he glanced at his brother in the car. “Well, well, well, my brother has a friend.” He looked back at his mother. “Who would’ve guessed?”
The lector stopped writing on the blackboard. His hand remained on the board as shut his eyes and bit on his teeth. He hated when someone interrupted him while writing a formula on the board. “Can I help you,” he asked without looking at the person who entered.
Mike pointed to the bench where he left his food. “Have a seat. Be with you in a minute.” He trotted off as fast as his plump body allowed him to the café. He hurried back with John’s coffee and handed it to him.
Mycroft jumped up. He opened his medical file, took out the lab results and chucked it on the bed. “Then explain the amphetamine sulfate they found in your system.”
A list of students’ names and locations where they sat in the classroom lay on his desk. He picked it up and glanced over it. After finding the name he was looking for, he strolled over to him.
Sherlock sighed as he struggled to make his way through and over boxes standing on the floor. He had to find a new flat, and soon.
The dormitories opened the second week in January for the students to move in, enroll into classes and get their study rosters, before attending university the following Wednesday.
An hour later, he glided the bow over the strings for the first time. He grimaced when it squealed like a shrieking cat when someone stepped on its tail.
Sherlock jumped up from the bed. “Why did you nag me to come here? You should’ve left me in Liverpool.”
With his elbow on the arm of the chair, Sherlock supported his head on his thumb and two fingers, while glancing at him. “Me neither,” he said still smiling.
Neither of the two men noticed the car stopping at the end of the alley. A man climbed out and strolled towards them.
Almost in tears, Sherlock paced up and down with his hands locked behind his head. “Oh god, what have I done?” he murmured. With tears in his eyes, he glanced at the furious man in front of him. “I think I better leave.” He turned away and hurried down the corridor.
He snorted when he stopped playback, not interested to hear what he was going to say next. Sherlock hated him and he was just looking out for him.
Sherlock strolled into the living room after eavesdropping on the conversation. “So, you’re leaving Mummy and me alone? We have to struggle on our own with packing and organizing a furniture truck.”
“Sitting in my room, trying to start a blog,” he replied. He took a deep breath. “So, do you have a girlfriend?”
He looked up when Sherlock barged through the door. “Where did you disappear off to? I was looking for you and decided to come home when I couldn’t find you.”
John shook his head. “No, that’s the thing. As soon as I put your head on my lap and brush my fingers repeatedly through your hair, you calm down.”
His head jerked sideways when a fist bashed into his face, another blow followed, lacerating his lip.
Mycroft rolled his eyes. He took one of the magazines on the nearby table, crossed his legs and paged through it.
John snorted. “Oh no you don’t.” He put his arms around him, held him tight as he came upright and stood up with him in his arms. He turned around and fell back on the bed with Sherlock underneath him. “I’m the dominant one.” He gazed at him and sighed. “My god you’re beautiful.” He traced his fingers along the side of his face, from his high cheekbones down to his neckline, before his mouth covered Sherlock’s luscious lips.
He pulled his face and blinked as he forced his eyes open. “What…” he grunted. He rubbed his eyes and glanced down at Sherlock staring at him with enlarged eyes. He gasped aloud and jumped out of bed. “Oh my god, I fell asleep.” He sat down on the edge of the bed, yawned and scratched the back of his head with both hands.
Andrew tore his shirt trying to keep him down while he wriggled to get away. “Stop squirming, you want to shag, we’ll shag.” He struggled, but managed to pull Sherlock’s pants down.
Sherlock jumped up. “Did your boyfriend called you up to ask permission before he gives me her phone number?”
“Sod the neighbors.” He placed his hands on Sherlock’s cheeks, pulled him down and kissed him on the lips. “Now they can talk.” He grabbed his suitcase, held the door open and trotted behind him up the stairs.
She sighed. “Sherlock, you don’t need any more lessons. You’re close to perfection playing the violin.”
Later that afternoon, his father came home from work announcing he was leaving the next morning for Liverpool. “We emptied all the offices today. I have to leave early to help them setting up for work on Monday.”
One day while sitting in a diner, Mycroft arrived with an unknown man on his side. Sherlock gazed at them, deducing the man. He was a police officer, perhaps a private investigator. He wore a wedding ring recently. Why did he take it off?
John returned to the kitchen. “Anyway, he’s coming over tonight.” He glanced back and chuckled. “He asked if he could bring a plus one.”
Dinner wasn’t as awkward as Sherlock expected it would be. In fact, he enjoyed the evening. For once, he and Mycroft were civil around a table. No catfights like when they were still in school and no sarcastic remarks from either of them like when they were alone in each other’s company.
“221B Baker Street,” he instructed the cabby and gazed out the window as the taxi cruised through the streets of London. How would Sherlock react seeing him again?
The side of his mouth slouched as tried to hide a smile. “If you promise not to rush me into anything, we can give it a try.”
“She’s James Moriarty’s sister.” He opened the door and glanced back. “Afternoon, John.” He left the door open and trotted downstairs, ignoring Sherlock when he called him back.
“Mummy and I thought it would be good for you to get out of the flat. Mingle with other people, and make friends.”
After the medical personnel pumped Sherlock’s stomach, they admitted him into the psych ward, before Mycroft could see him.
He smiled. Since when did he have the ability to read people? If he only had it before… He lowered his head and shut his eyes.
Sherlock ignored Simon’s phone calls after that weekend. When he knocked on his flat door after work, he pretended to be not at home. He avoided him for a month until Simon showed up at the lab one morning.
His mother barged into his room. “What did I tell you about slamming doors in this house? You better start packing. We’re moving the end of the month.”
“Look at yourself. You’ve become a bloody drug addict. Good god Sherlock, you have so much potential and you’re throwing it away.”
He gaped at him before he blinked a few times. “I beg your pardon. The invitation to my house was for a drink only. I’m not some… sex maniac, Mister Holmes.”
John kept his promise and waited patiently. Their relationship consisted of cuddles and kisses alone. It suited Sherlock. He didn’t want to take another risk in having sex and relived that moment when his professor brutally raped him.
Sherlock lowered the violin and stared blankly in front of him, recalling Mycroft’s words. He was not going to make friends. He was perfectly fine on his own. He had to get his act together, though. Exams started next week and he didn’t open a book, yet. He was neglecting his studies and could only blame himself for it.
John moved to the edge of his chair and placed his hand on Sherlock’s knee. “Did you have time to think when you were in France?”
Mycroft chuckled. “Fortunately not, brother dear.” He moved his chair closer. “I see you became a child of the night.”
When he licked his dry lips, it left a taste of iron in his mouth. He brushed over his lips, feeling the coarseness of dry blood underneath his fingertips.
Sherlock’s face dulled. “It’s mine. I moved in two days ago. It will be out of the way when you move in.”
He narrowed his eyes. “Matthew Clarkson, Matt for short,” he asked. “A short boy with brown hair,” he added when his mother pulled a face.
Sherlock raised his head and scanned the buildings. “There are no surveillance cameras here.” His brows furrowed, making nose crinkles. “What’s he still doing at the office?”
She smiled and adjusted a button on the bottom of the video until they could here Sherlock screaming.
Simon turned around and smiled. “You can’t go to bed on an empty stomach, Mister Holmes.” He turned back and trotted down the stairs.
“Huh, um…” He stuttered when he replied. “Yes, sit here… I mean there…” He took a deep breath and pulled himself together. “Take a seat, Mister, um…”
The professor remained standing in the back of the class watching the boy’s cute butt as he walked away. He rolled his eyes again, covered them with his hand while pressing his thumb and forefinger on his temples. He had to stop doing this and concentrate.
When John stormed in, he was dressed in his pajamas again. He fell down on the bed and switched the bed lamp on. “Please don’t be mad at me.” He shook his head. “I’m a hot-blooded man with needs.”
When John woke after four hours of sleep, he glanced at the clock radio and jumped out of bed when he noticed the time. Sherlock didn’t wake him after two hours, as he asked. He straightened his clothes and rushed into the living room. “Sherlock,” he called out. He glanced inside the kitchen and in the bathroom. He was alone in the flat. Where could Sherlock be?
He arched a brow and repeated her words. “Brother mine…” He shook his head. “I don’t have a sister.”
He shook his head. He glanced at Simon as he walked past him and left the musical room for the last time.
He charged upstairs and barged through the door, finding Sherlock with a gun in his hand, shooting at the wall. “What the hell are you doing,” he yelled.
He tried to hide a smile. “How many times did I put my coat on not knowing you wore it the night before?”
“I won’t.” He shut the door after she left and took his usual place at the back of the room. He played the piece of music he practiced, flawless.
Greg snorted. “There’s nothing wrong with me or the food I eat.” He poked him in the ribs. “You can do with a bit of greasy food. I don’t like bony men, you know.”
John stormed up to him, reaching for the gun. “Give me that,” he said and grabbed it out of his hand. “What the hell is wrong with you?”
Sherlock’s eyes enlarged. Within seconds, he stood on his feet and held his hands in the air. “I’m so sorry. I thought… I thought you were… I’m sorry,” he brushed his fingers through his hair.
After a long discussion, Mycroft convinced him to go back to London. He would pull a few strings to get him into a university there.
He shook his head after the doors shut, pressed the ground floor button and smiled all the way down.
He put the gun on top of the mantelpiece and glanced at his ex. “Why are you still in your pajamas? It’s past noon already.”
After he bought a hot dog and milkshake, he went over to the park across the hospital to his usual spot. He took place on one of the benches to eat, when he noticed a familiar face passing him by. “John,” he called out, but the man kept on walking. He put his lunch down and jumped up. “John Watson, he called out again, louder this time.
At ten, he had back-to-back science with professor Linder. He had to look him in the eye sometime or the other, but why today for two hours.
In the beginning of his fifth and final year, his science professor fell ill and had to go on sick leave for the remainder of the year.
He stopped and turned to him. “I think you better leave. I’m sorry you’ve wasted your time with me.” He turned back and continued walking.
“Did I say something wrong?” she asked while stepping into the kitchen to put the tray on the table.
Sherlock snorted and choked on his food. He coughed a few times, before he was able to take a sip of water. “At least now I know you haven’t slept together, yet.” He put his fork down. “Greg, why did you take your wedding ring off?”
“I’m Professor Andrew Marks,” the new lector said while writing his name on the black board. He turned back to the students and smiled as he glanced over each of them. His brow arched when he noticed Sherlock’s blasé attitude.
Mycroft jumped up, glared at his brother and marched to the door. “Just remember, my eyes are fixed on you, day and night,” he announced and hurried out of the flat.
The professor walked over to him and knocked on his desk. “We don’t daydream in my class, Mister Holmes.”
Horny as hell, he jumped into the shower and opened the cold-water tap. He gasped aloud when the cold water jetted onto his warm skin. He sighed while glancing down at his erection. The cold water was useless today.
He paused at the taxi door and glanced over his shoulder. His eyes enlarged before he jumped around facing her. “It’s you,” he called out.
“I find us amusing. Firstly, the one wants to determine if the other one’s gay. After we concluded we are both gay, we, secondly, wanted to find out if we are single.”
“That went well,” John said when they were alone in the flat again. “Your brother is quite a pleasant guy after all.”
She nodded and watched him stumbled out of the lab. Her eyes enlarged. There was something wrong with him.
“I would like to keep him here a while longer after he comes out of the padded room. How long that will take,” He shook his head. “I don’t know. He’s a brilliant man, did you know that.”
“But Sherlock,” she cried out. “It’s the Holmes family tradition. Your father, your grandfather, and great grandfather, as well as Mycroft went there. You can’t throw your life away like this. You have to get a degree in something. A high school diploma only, won’t get you anywhere.”
She smiled, unlocked the door and turned back to him. “I want this back before eight tomorrow morning,” she said when she handed him the set of keys.
Simon stood in the doorway and gazed at him stretched out on the couch, watching television. After six months without sexual interaction between them, except the odd kisses now and again, it was time to break his promise.
Sherlock glided his gaze over to his mouth and held his breath. “Stop that,” he said, before returning his gaze to John’s eyes.
Sherlock’s heart hammered in his chest, scared to ask. He swallowed a lump and took a deep breath. “What do you want, John?”
Mike smiled. “This is a coincidence. A colleague of mine is looking for a flat mate. Are you interested?”
Sherlock paced up and down the flat, smoking the one cigarette after the other while waiting for Greg to call back.
“Oh, don’t mind him. He has been this grumpy ever since we received notice about moving to Liverpool. Complaining about leaving his friend behind.”
After knocking and banging on the flat’s door, Mycroft phoned his chauffeur to come up and break the door down.
He took his hand away from his eyes to quiet them down when he noticed the blackboard. His eyes enlarged. The boy completed the formula in record time and was on his way back.
“We’ve already interrogated him. He’s innocent. I’m not going to waste my time.” She pointed at Sherlock as she glanced at Greg. “Who does he think he is?”
He stood a while before a taxi stopped next to him. He jumped in, gave the hospital’s address and stared out the window after he moved back in the seat.
He continued to play the violin. On his off days, he went back to Willa at the university for more lessons.
Later that night shouting noises woke John. He lay still to listen and gasped when Sherlock screamed. He jumped out of bed and rushed to his bedroom. He knocked on the door and entered.
John stood on his knees wiping the floor. “No, when I turned my back for a second the sink overflowed.” If he only knew, he was thinking of him and his sweet lips. “Bloody hell,” he yelled.
“Hmm, that feels nice,” he murmured. He picked the remote up from the floor, switched the television off and turned on his back. He placed his hand on the side of Simon’s face and gazed into his eyes. “I know what you want.” He shook his head before he continued. “But I can’t give it to you.”
“So, you missed supper, it’s past six already.” He took a deep breath. “I’m on my way to a diner. You want to join me?”
Greg stood with his arms crossed and smiled while watching him in action. “I told you he was good,” he whispered to Anderson.
“No, I misread you.” Tears welled up in his eyes. “I said I was sorry, please don’t hurt me.” He crawled until his back hit the bed.
Sherlock nodded. He waited until Simon disappeared into the lift before he rushed off to his locker. He grabbed a small plastic sachet out of his bag, took one of the tablets and popped it into his mouth.
“I told you. I’m bored.” He flopped sideways onto the couch, put his hand together under his chin as if he wanted to pray and shut his eyes.
Sherlock jumped upright. “This is why I don’t want to sleep over. The few hours we spent together protected me from this.” He glanced at him. “You should find someone who can give himself completely to you, someone without baggage, without issues.”
When he woke for the second time, a bright light shined above him. He shut his eyes and turned his head to the side before he opened them up again. He blinked a few times, before he could focus. Everything was white around him, except for the light blue curtains.
John shut the door and glanced at him. “She’s just worried about you, all alone here in the flat, Sherlock.”
Sherlock didn’t move, except for fluttering his eyes when the door banged. He despised people coming late, even more those who had to set an example.
“This is what you want, isn’t it?” He continued pushing Sherlock backward until he ended up on the couch, and fell on top of him.
“Nothing, when he’s awake. He’s having nightmares at night. Then he yells at someone to leave him alone and stop hurting him. All this we gathered from the video footage. When he sits with me during a session, he refuses to say a word.”
The quiet dormitory was bliss to him during weekends. He preferred to stay in instead of going home. Once every two months, just to please his mother, he would go home for the weekend.
He put his arms around Sherlock. “No you’re not. I promised you I won’t rush you, remember.” He sighed. “I had to get rid of this sexual tension.”
Sherlock hated every minute of his new school. He didn’t make any friends in the six months he attended. He kept to himself, minding his own business.
John shook his head while following him. He pulled up a chair and sat down at the table. “We can’t do this again.”
John glared at him, before he switched off the light. He put his arm under Sherlock’s head and the other one around his body and pulled him closer.
Sherlock glared at her. “She… she, oh never mind.” He turned away from Irene, leaving a baffled woman staring at him as he disappeared out the door.
Sherlock’s eyes enlarged while gaping at him. “John, wait.” He caught up with him and grabbed his arm. “Why do you worry about me?”
Sherlock jumped when the professor banged his hand on his desk. He stared at the long slender fingers on the desk in front of him.
After a month, he recovered of visible scars. The invisible ones remained, and that worried his family.
“Always a pleasure, dear,” she said smiling, before she turned around and headed for the door. She paused in the doorway and turned back. “Sherlock, are you going to get a new flat mate now that –”
A woman in her late sixties opened up. Her face lit up. “Sherlock,” she called out and threw her arms around him after he stepped closer.
He chuckled when he took two fifty pound notes out of his wallet. Before he could hand the money over, a voice spoke in the dark behind them.
Sherlock stopped laughing. “No Missis Hudson, you’re impeccable and so is your timing,” he said and chuckled again when he glanced at John.
After the third attempt of asking him on a date, Sherlock finally agreed and went to dinner with professor Linder.
He nodded. “I’ll be ready.” He opened the car door. “Thanks for dinner, I’ve enjoyed it.” He gasped aloud when Simon put a firm grip on his shoulder, pulling him closer. He blocked him with his hands against his chest. “Please don’t, not tonight.”
“Come on, love. Don’t you want me to solve the case, get the scum in jail and tidy Britain’s streets up a bit?”
“He’s your brother, Sherlock. I’m living here for almost two months and I didn’t know you had a brother. You never talk about him.”
He pushed the pause button, waited until she left before rewinding the video. He found the part he looked for and pressed the play button.
He pulled Sherlock’s pajama pants down and gasped aloud as he gazed at his erection. With difficulty, he tore his staring eyes away to unzip his denim jeans. John waited until he turned over onto his stomach, before he placed both hands under Sherlock’s hips and tugged his rear end upwards before entering him.
His eyes skimmed over the dimmed area. He found whom he was looking for and rushed over to her. He grabbed her by the arm and dragged her aside. “Irene, who was that red head?”
Like before, he sat with his back against the headboard while Sherlock curled himself up in a fetal position with his head on John’s lap. He calmed down as soon as John started brushing his fingers through his hair and over his forehead.
Greg returned, brushed his hand over Mycroft’s shoulder as he passed him and took place next to him again. “Sorry I kept you waiting.”
Sherlock jumped feet first onto his chair, put his hands together in front of his face and shut his eyes, ignoring John.
When Sherlock moved his hand to free it, Simon tightened his grip. He gasped and raised his head slowly until they locked eyes. This man wanted more than he could give him. He wasn’t ready for a relationship.
He glanced at the students as they entered and arched a brow when he picked up something about them he never noticed before. The guy in front of him had a string of red hair on his jumper, but his hair was black – perhaps a girlfriend with red hair or the jumper didn’t belong to him. The girl next to him had crumbs on her corduroy jacket – she had biscuits for breakfast.
Sherlock kept to himself as usual. After his classes, he spent his time in the library doing research until suppertime. Thereafter he buried himself in his textbooks in the dorm room.
Sherlock and John headed back home after they found enough clues for DI Lestrade on the murder scene in Brixton.
Sherlock glanced at him when they got out of the lift. “They do, but I take my own samples and sometimes they don’t see it as evidence while I do.” He held the lab door open, waited until John had entered and stepped inside as well.
Sherlock opened the buffet’s drawer and stared at the eating utensils. If she only knew how hard it was for him to make friends. After four years alone in high school, he finally made friends with a boy in his class last year.
“I will secure your employment at St Bart’s.” Mycroft smiled. “I’m working for the government, Sherlock. I can let anything happen.”
The thought of seeing Matt by the end of the year, kept him going these past six months. He was his first friend, his first… love. Now he had nothing to look forward to, except a tedious Christmas vacation with his parents at home.
After a long shower, he reentered the room. “Mister Holmes, there’s no seconds. Get dressed.” He frowned, paced closer and gasped aloud when he discovered his student was unconscious.
Sherlock glanced at him when he sat down on the couch. Could that be an invitation? He didn’t want to make the same mistake as with Matt. They were attracted to each other. Both were scared to make a move and he left London without kissing Matt once.
“Stop it. Just stop it.” He put his hands on Sherlock’s chest, trying to push him away. “We’re not a couple anymore. Will you please step aside?”
Sherlock invested in a few coats and scarfs to stand out from the rest when he had to do investigations. He became attached to his new look and wore the dark blue scarf twisted around his neck along with the long black or navy coat with its collar turned up every time he sat foot out of his flat.
He jumped up, took his hand and introduced himself. “Lestrade, Greg Lestrade.” He remained standing and gazed at Mycroft.
Willa was locking up when he came running down the corridor. “Hello love, I was wondering where you were.”
Sherlock sat with the newspaper in front of his face, reading. Every now and again, he picked up the cup of coffee, took a sip and put it back on the table without looking away from the paper. “John?” He lowered the left side of the newspaper and glanced at him. “John, wake up. What are you doing at night, definitely not sleeping?
Sherlock jumped around and glared at him. “Don’t patronize me, Mycroft. Why didn’t you mention her before?”
He opened his eyes and furrowed his brows. “Ow, it hurts.” He relaxed his facial muscles before he asked. “What do you mean?”
“I have to stay. My boss already booked me into a hotel until you and Sherlock join me in two weeks.”
He sighed inward when he took place next to him. The only thing he would find interesting now, was shagging him. He put his hand on his bare thigh.
With a head for numbers, mathematics and logic, Sherlock helped the nurses counting stock, balancing their drug books and working out the formulas for the correct dosages before they could administer prescribed medicines.
John jumped up and grabbed his arm before he could leave the room. He pulled him closer, raised his heels to stand on the tips of his toes and kissed him on the lips.
John frowned and blinked a few times. “But don’t the police have a forensics lab to analyze the evidence?”
He jumped out of bed, grabbed a cigarette and lit it. He drew a deep breath of smoke, raised his head and released the smoke slowly towards the ceiling.
Greg moved his chair closer to Sherlock. “Tell me more about this…” He pulled a face and glanced at Mycroft. “The what?”
One night, a voice woke Sherlock. He held his breath to listen. He sighed with relief. It was coming from somewhere in the flat and not from his head as he thought. He reached out to John, but he wasn’t next to him in bed. He stood up and without switching on a light, he paced down the corridor. He frowned when he approached the living room. Someone was moaning and mumbling in there.
Sherlock smiled as he strolled over to his brother. He stopped behind him and placed his hands on his shoulders while bending down. “Fancy seeing you in a place like this,” he whispered in his ear.
Sherlock stretched and repositioned himself. When he placed his hand underneath his head, he opened his eyes and frowned. He turned his head to see what caused the bulge under his hand and gasped. He jerked his hand away from John’s crotch. He raised his head to look at him. “John,” he whispered, before patting him on the arm. “What are you doing in my bed?” He shook his shoulder.
The chicken portions covered the outlet, keeping the water from draining. The sink filled up with water until it flowed over the side.
“I know. Your name is on my subjects list.” He turned back to the desk, chucked his sling bag on the floor and sat down.
He grabbed hold of his ear, trying to rub the cream off. “The first day in months I didn’t have early lectures and I overslept.  I have to get to the bathroom before I can continue.”
Sherlock stood in the doorway and glanced inside the empty bedroom, his domain of the past seventeen years. His parents bought the house after they got married and lived there ever since.
“Come in you two, come in.” She shut the door after they’ve entered and went back to her flat while the two men walked upstairs.
A taxi dropped him off a few blocks from the hospital. He waited until the driver drove off before he walked into a dark alley. His eyes skimmed over the area.
After visiting Simon’s house on Sunday, Sherlock agreed to another visit. This time he allowed him to kiss him goodnight after taking him back to the flat.
Molly came looking for him and found him sitting on the floor in front of the lockers. “Are you alright, Sherlock?”
“I play the violin when I’m thinking and when I want to escape from the world. I hope it won’t bother you.”
When he noticed someone approaching, he pushed his back against the wall, hoping the person didn’t see him. His heart hammered in his chest. Was it the dealer? It might be a mugger or even a killer.
“Yes.” He grabbed dishcloths to dry the floor, but there was too much water. He raced off to the bathroom, grabbed two towels and rushed back to the kitchen.
After they gave their order to waiter, he deduced people entering the restaurant, avoiding eye contact with Simon.
After a few more minutes, he relaxed. He got out, dried himself and put on a baggy tracksuit pants and t-shirt before he returned to the living room.
Almost every night, Sherlock woke up screaming from the haunting nightmares. After two months, his roommate filed a complaint. He moved out with the permission of the Dean, now Sherlock had the room all to himself.
Since their wedding day, Sherlock ignored John’s phone calls. He didn’t even come to wish them bon voyage on the airport as their other friends did.
He took out his science notes and textbook before he dropped onto the bed and turned on his stomach. He had to study if he wanted to remain a grade-A student.
John shook his head, took a bite of the eggs and chewed on it as if it was a piece of gum. He never told Sherlock about the nightmares, neither about his nightly visits to calm him down. “It’s my blog. I don’t keep track of time when I write,” he fibbed.
“I know it’s out of the blue, but do you have a vacant flat?” He nodded. “I can come tomorrow.” He smiled. “No need to write it down, I’ll remember the address, Missis Hudson.” He chuckled. “Yes, two two one B, Baker Street. Good day to you too, Missis Hudson.” He ended the call and jumped in the air, yelling. “Yes.”
After they enjoyed their meal and was on their way back to the car, Simon suggested that Sherlock went back to his place for a nightcap before taking him back to the flat.
His mother jumped up and stormed out of the living room. She stopped in the dining room doorway and glared at her son. “Stop it, now. You’re beginning to annoy me. You’re not the only one who’s upset that we have to move. I had to give up my flower shop and my yearlong friends. You’re still young. You can make new friends at school.”
He flung around. “Greg, what are you doing here?” When he turned back, Whitey was gone. “Now looked what you’ve done,” he cried out. “Did Mycroft send you?”
His father glanced at him. “Jeez, it’s only for two weeks, Sherlock. You’re a grown man, I think you can manage.”
Sherlock gazed at him as he walked away, pausing his eyes on his rear end. With effort, he dragged his gaze away from the man and opened his textbook. His hand shivered as he paged through the book. The last time butterflies twirled in his stomach and his flesh crawled with excitement, was the day he met Matt.
He narrowed his eyes as he gazed at his student. “I don’t want to see you with closed eyes in my class again.” He turned around while asking them to open their textbooks.
Minutes later, the new lector barged through the door and apologized with an excuse that his car had a flat tire.
For two months, he received letters from him every week. The letters diminished until it stopped, even though Sherlock kept on writing, sending a letter to him every week.
He shut his eyes, thinking of him and John making out behind the curtains on the stage. That was when she appeared out of nowhere. She saw them shagging. She smiled at him then disappeared.
The phone on his desk rang. He grabbed it to answer. “Yes. Speaking.” He jumped up. “We’ll be there in a minute.” He chucked the receiver onto the phone and grabbed his jacket. “They found a body in the Grand Deluxe hotel’s basement parking. Sherlock, you’re coming with me.”
He gasped. “Oh, nothing, I’m glad for him.” He smiled again. “Well, I have plenty of work waiting for me and you have more than three hours of driving ahead of you.” He kissed her on the cheek and returned to his car. “Give my love to Daddy, and be careful on the road,” he said before getting into the back.
Sherlock grimaced when he noticed the doorknocker hung straight. He grabbed it and slanted it to the right. “Mycroft is here already,” he mumbled and grunted before opening the door.
John’s face was red as he paced the tiny room, and he stabbed a finger at Sherlock. “You’re thinking of leaving. Don’t deny it.”
“Not really. I was always good at observing people. That’s what makes me a good Companion, and then the crime element just came along by accident.” He stopped for a moment, remembering Inara; what would his life be like now if she hadn’t taken him under her wing?
Sherlock cut himself off, pressed his lips together. John’s pencil filled in the details of Sherlock’s face, his jawline, his throat with his Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallowed. The lines of his torso. The smooth, circular scar of a bullet, created by John’s wife, his dead wife.
Sherlock sat in his chair, staring into the fire in the grate. He was surrounded by his case notes, and he didn’t look at them. His desk, with its neat pile of origami paper, was at hand, but he didn’t reach out to take a sheet. His clothes were stiff with dust and blood, and he didn’t move to change.
From between his legs he pulled a breather tube, wincing as the tape ripped at the delicate skin, and put the tube in his mouth.
He stalked off to the far end of the studio. Once he knew he was out of sight, he leaned against the wall and laid his face against the cool tiles. Stupid, stupid, stupid. While he was partly pleased at putting John back into his place, he knew that he had just exposed his vulnerability, not just in front of the cameras, but in front of John – a man whose motivation and purpose he hadn’t yet figured out. Hadn’t he learned his lesson yet about not underestimating the man?
“No,” Sherlock said, then cleared his throat of the dust. “No, Watson, we’re looking for Uncle Mycroft.”
If you took a knitted garment, and made  one tiny cut, the whole thing would unravel and fall apart. Transformed again into one long string.
John made a soft growling, humming noise and pushed into Sherlock’s hand with a jerk of his hips. Sherlock’s own cock throbbed in response, and he buried his face in John’s neck, mouthing at the strong pulse he found there. John filled his arms, his hand, perfectly; the heft of John’s body and his cock feeling right in his arms in a way Sherlock had never experienced before. John’s hand was small and delicate, but strong, and was stroking urgently, and Sherlock could already feel the orgasm gathering in the pit of his belly. He tightened his own hand around John’s cock, and found a hardened nub of a nipple with the fingers of his other hand.
. But at the moment, the needs of his transport had swept away his discipline and Sherlock was ravenously hungry.
John had taken to Stamford immediately. He had a round, friendly face and a personality to match. He had peered at John’s letter a bit owlishly, ignoring the pince-nez that dangled on a ribbon around his neck. For a moment, John feared that Stamford doubted his letter, that there was a massive error with the research or the execution of the letter, then Stamford had looked up and smiled at him.
John blinked a few times, then sighed. “Bring coffee.” He turned away from the screen, scratching, and broke the connection.
He looked out over the roof of the building. There was a platform about five by five feet, then a short distance down to the arch of the roof. He worked his body out of the small window, grateful for his natural flexibility and strength. Looking around, he saw only other houses, their chimneys puffing white smoke, and the wintery sun.
Ce n'est pas nécessaire maintenant.  Puis-je parler à l'Ambassadeur du Canada? - That is not necessary now. May I speak with the Canadian Ambassador?
John pulled back a bit, then started a trail of sloppy, biting kisses along Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock held on to John, afraid he would melt away, and tilted his head back to allow better access.
Rosie was quiet for a long time, unmoving against his chest. Then she said quietly, still muffled against his chest, “Biscuit?”
He had hardly had time to get started when his mobile rang. He rolled his eyes when he saw the call display, but answered nonetheless. “Mycroft.”
After several measures, and the first basic section of the dance had been accomplished, Sherlock danced the first indications of a cue of an embellishment in choreography – a flip of the leg, which, if the timing was correct, would tangle perfectly with the partner’s leg. If John didn’t know it, it would simply look like a showy pose on Sherlock’s part.
Sherlock had silently come to the same conclusion, and was feeling his spirits wane. The competition was fun, he couldn’t deny himself, but the loss last week due to his failure in embellishment still smarted. He had to admit to himself that the ‘look’ of the product was a weakness of his – his mind was free from adornment, and so was the work he produced. To him, decoration was much like a wearing a tie with a suit – it added nothing useful and was a nuisance besides.
“Maja,” John said softly. A smile that contained more embarrassment than anything else flicked across his face.
He helped Rosie get ready, wishing that he had thought to have extra clothes for her at the flat; her current outfit was decidedly dirty and dingy, but he nonetheless straightened her dungarees, making sure she was all buttoned into her little coat. He put on his own coat and slung the rucksack over his shoulder. Then he held out his hand and Rosie took it immediately.
“You forget, Holmes, I am a medical man,” John said. “I have seen the… longer term effects of usage. I have seen brains completely wasted away on the stuff. Or death in the case of an accidental overdose. My heart fails at the thought of this happening to you.”
He began to dance, a mocking dance. A child’s version of ballet – mincing, prancing, excessively pretty. “Perhaps they’ll ask me to perform the Sugar Plum Fairy. What do you think? Do you like it? Do I-”
Chapter summary: Sherlock has been hit hard in the head by people who have taken Rosie. He fights through his concussion to track them down. The group, driven by desperate hunger, have taken Rosie with the intent of cannibalization. Sherlock trades his rucksack full of food for Rosie, but shoots the man who threatened her. They escape; Rosie is unhurt but badly frightened. Sherlock realizes that his phone was in the rucksack, and he has lost his only picture of John.
?” she said. “Oh no. The powers that be don’t wish to risk that, apparently. Sherlock Holmes is too grand of a dancer to share the stage with anyone. It will be a solo performance.”
Here’s the Baryshnikov/Hines duet from White Nights: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImzkWZkaIIM (Is that not the sexiest thing ever? The eye contact!)
Sherlock stared at him for a moment, then shrugged and returned to his chair with the paper. John quickly drank a cup of now-cool tea, his throat suddenly dry. The tea was somehow more thirst quenching cold than hot, and he poured another cup and sat down heavily. He waited for Sherlock to finish, his mind still stammering over the import of this day in history.
“Yes, and I don’t want you to get distracted with a job, so you’ll need enough rent to get by. Oh, and get yourself some follicle enhancers for your face, you’ll need some facial hair, a beard or mustache or something like. Very unusual for men to not have them in this era.”
“Just a pretend tent, in here,” Sherlock replied. “But for now, we’ll play another game. Can you help me find all the red tins in this pile?”
She asked politely, without seeming to accuse him of clearing out the store. He decided to answer in kind, with caution. “Yes, some soup and stew. Some beans.”
Sherlock twisted his lip in doubt, but then stepped into the bath. He lowered himself down into the water, his forehead wrinkled in concentration at first, then clearing.
When the cab pulled up, he realized they were outside the Jowett building, at a side entrance. He looked up at the darkened windows of the building, and looked at Bahdri in confusion.
“She’s brilliant. She’s a professor at a prestigious university. She’s had several papers published on improving the agriculture of Terraformed planets.”
“None of your – what makes you think I’m rich?” Sherlock sighed. “Let me guess, you’ve seen me on the newsvidder as well, have you?”
The cigarette’s tang ran along the edges of his tongue, and he let the smoke trickle slowly from his lips. He let the last of the smoke puff out in a gust on the last beat of the bar and was on his feet on the first beat of the next.
They reached the top, and John let out a sharp edged sigh. “I’m going to have a shower,” he said, not looking at Sherlock. “Get the smell of the hospital off me.”
“I did. Let’s find this Inspector from Norwich,” Holmes said, and launched himself out of the carriage.
John stands up, and I see the dangerous look in his eyes. The same look is reflected in the eyes of everyone else in the restaurant.
Sherlock saw him coming, and stopped pacing. John walked over, stopping in front of him – not touching, but closer than they ever had before.
“A very wise investment. Jim, will you tell me? About your… re-evaluation. I want to know more about you, given the circumstances.”
John looked at his watch for the hundredth time that day. Time was moving like treacle, when he wanted it to race to 5:00pm, when he could meet Sherlock for dinner – and everything he hoped that meant.
He could hear John breathing heavily on the other side of the sofa. His own cock was erect and bent painfully in his pants. He wanted to adjust himself, relieve some of the pressure, but he remembered the cameras.
She toddled off toward Georgie and sat in front of him, carefully stacking the blocks between them. After a long moment, Georgie removed his fingers from his mouth and carefully poked one block with his finger, as though it might explode.
“Get a saucepan of water simmering – just a simmer, not a boil. Put the bowl over it and melt it slowly, stirring constantly.”
I sit on the sofa feeling completely off-guard and dishevelled. There’s a murmured, hissing conversation at the door. At one point I hear this deep, undoubtedly male voice say, “But it’s a
She, even she, Moira, the queen of sales at Harrods, was running out of ideas. They rounded the corner into the jewelry department. “A nice watch? We might even be able to engrave it tonight.”
T.J. was already shaking his head before John had finished his sentence. “I don’t even have permission anymore.”
Carrying Rosie slowed him down as well, walking even slower to avoid stumbling and dropping her, or worse, falling and taking her down with him. Sometimes he wondered if he should let her down to walk on her own, but walking was still relatively new to her and the chances of her falling were far greater. She showed no inclination to get down anyway, looking around with wide eyes, pointing and saying, “What that?” at every unfamiliar sight – so nearly constantly.
She held up her hand. “No, thank you. The less I know. Good luck. Now.” She cleared her throat and shook her head slightly. “Don’t think that you can bring this kind of crap to the National Theatre of Belgrade and be respected for one minute,” she shouted.
“Well, here’s an idea. The staff of the museum come in from all over the city. Why don’t I ask everyone to bring a sample from the parks in their neighbourhoods? That should save you the footwork.”
Sherlock looks down at the tiny piece of brass in his hand. The moon reflects in the metal, shines between the letters engraved in it. ‘I LOVE YOU’ and the moon.
But as he walked into the kitchen, he noticed the stain on the wall where an experiment had left a batch of sticky, tar-like substance behind, and inspiration struck.
“She was disarmed right away,” Mrs. Hudson said. “Your brother gave just one look, and there was a guard on her just as you fell. She’s locked away now, never fear.” She shook her head, tears rolling up in her eyes. “Oh Sherlock dear. After the crash, someone from the military hospital told us you were very ill and couldn’t be moved, and I insisted on seeing you, and they wouldn’t let me, so I called your brother, he came straight away and we’ve been here since.”
My hand was halfway to his flies but I stop, something’s deeply wrong. He’s pale and just on the verge of shaking, and I have a funny feeling that if I touch his belt buckle things will go very badly.
The judges huddled around each other, clearly taking this whole thing a lot more seriously than John and Sherlock had thought they would. Only brief mutterings could be heard – “lovely”, “dense”, “creative”, “delicious”, “I don’t understand”, “quite
“I’m not done here yet,” Sherlock snapped. He strode across the alley and snatched up his billfold. “I’ve a murder to solve.”
Despite his exhaustion, Sherlock noted John’s odd swimming style, his arms going straight out in front and then pushing to the sides, as opposed to Sherlock’s more traditional crawl.
Sherlock suddenly remembered standing on the edge of the roof at St. Bart’s. As confident as he was in his Lazarus plan, he had had a terrible, terrifying flash of doubt standing there. He had thrown away his phone, he knew there was no more delaying, and all he had to do was tilt forward. Just as he did, he felt fear shoot through him, the brief and certain knowledge that nothing would be the same again. Then gravity took him and started the chain of events that had brought him to this.
But then his fingers find it, the small rectangle, its sharp corners incongruous in his wet pocket.  He pulls it out, the damp flannel of his shirt dragging on it. He wants to say so much, but his brain is still slow, waterlogged. But he has to -
The hovercar pulled up in front of the theatre and a footman opened the door. Sherlock stepped out, forcing himself not to blink at the barrage of light from the bank of newsvids, forcing a smile instead. He held out his hand and helped Professor Flynn out of the hovercar.
The only change was that every night, Rosie would shun the nest of his coat that he had made for her, and curl up against his chest. It was strange and alien to him, but he found himself comforted by her warmth.
John was silent, and Sherlock looked up from his stretch. John was staring at him with an odd expression. “What? What is it?”
It was impossible, it was wrong for John to be uneasy showing Sherlock his bunk, so Sherlock showed him how all right it was by tumbling them both into it.
She led him down the alley, then onto a smaller, darker street. Sherlock didn’t recognize it but getting away from the main roads was wise.
Stars were sweeping across his vision; perhaps he ought to tell John. Arms grabbed at him as he fell, but the only one he felt was one strong hand belonging to John Watson.
,” she responded. No hint of a welcoming smile touched her face. She half turned behind her, not taking her eyes off Sherlock, and said softly, “
The light from the fire flickered against Sherlock’s skin, highlighting the scars that crisscrossed his back. John sucked in a breath. He had had a glimpse of them before, back when he was caring for Sherlock after he was shot. Before he could say anything then, Sherlock had turned away as quickly as he was able and pulled a dressing gown over himself. John’s mind had been too full of grief and anger over Mary to press further.
“You had me at ‘aquarium’,” John said. “I love fish and that. I just had to talk himself into coming down.”
“Well of course I did, dear! Your brother won’t say so, but he’s been worried sick like I’ve never seen. He’s been on the phone nearly constantly since he arrived, talking to every connection he has here. And then we got word that you were in Belgrade, and well, and – oh, I haven’t slept since then. What happened, Sherlock?”
He tilts his head back towards the sitting room, where John and Sherlock are standing awkwardly. “They’re – ahm – looking for my brother. My twin,” he says.
While Sherlock had been impatient to see the end of Belgrade, he had refused all offers to return until the doctor had deemed John well enough to travel. John slept nearly constantly for two days, then fidgeted his way through the doctor’s examination. When Dr. Bell sat back and nodded in satisfaction, John turned to Sherlock with raised eyebrows and a shy smile that took Sherlock’s breath away.
And Sherlock taking Eric Underwood’s role as the Caterpillar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOiK2G88sbw&list=PL5qf7zxCk2JBzIwfMCiRgY8UOA0ExQq77&index=13 (Those harem pants OMFG)
Sherlock licked his lips, forced his vocal cords to work. “I say I failed you because… there is nothing I wouldn’t do for you, John. For you and for Rosie. I tried to protect her because she’s a part of you, and,” and the words started spilling out of him, released at last, “I don’t know what this is supposed to feel like but I’d do anything for you, just to know you’re alive, and I’m so glad you’re alive, John.”
Bahdri steered him to the sofa and sat next to him. “Dunworthy asked me to look in on you,” he said softly. “You – you missed your thesis defense, mate.”
John looked up. Holmes had dragged Evans up and out of the trapdoor, an amazing feat since Evans likely outweighed him by at least five stone. Evans’ face was covered in blood, and Holmes was still hitting him with a frenzy that had John momentarily paralyzed. Holmes was screaming without words, only rage and fury.
Sherlock didn’t come out of his room for hours, even after the judges had gone home. After cleaning up, John stood in the kitchen and looked at the two loaves for a while. He cut a bit from his own loaf, took a bite, frowned, and threw the whole thing in the bin. He made a jam sandwich from Sherlock’s loaf, and found it very nice indeed.
Here's how it is: Sherlock's makeup is a mess, Anderson jumps to another arrest, and Sherlock receives some very interesting waves.
“Not sure. For now I’ll behave myself – no more escape attempts. Dance. Be the perfect little puppet.”
“Perhaps, but that’s not my concern at the moment.” Sherlock stopped and looked over at the man, who was putting his gun away into its hip holster. Wiggins would be impossible to find after this, and useless to Sherlock, and Sherlock still needed information. Perhaps this man, who was clearly acquainted with the area and with the kind of people that frequented it, could tell him something. He extended his hand, reframing his face into a more friendly look. “Sherlock Holmes.”
Michael ran through a series of steps, while Sherlock watched carefully. “Yes, that’s it, you’ve got it. Just watch that you’ve got your ankle turned out properly.”
“That’s why he keeps me as his manager,” Mrs. Hudson said. “If he goes to someone else, I’d make him move out, and he’s too lazy to look for another flat.”
“It’s not selfish to do things that are just for yourself. In fact, it’s very useful in terms of recharging your mental energies, especially for people like you, in helping professions. For instance, you said Sherlock plays violin? That’s what he does.”
,” and he pushed John slightly. “They don’t want me to have allies, so they drive something between us. Make us enemies. They want me to have nowhere to turn.”
Sherlock’s surge in energy poured over John. His pencil froze, but the rest of him went hot and cold in a wave.
[John backs up, and now we see the whole room. It’s about 20x20, hardwood floors, a mirror and a barre along one wall, and large windows letting in London’s weak sunlight. This is Sherlock’s practice room, on the upper floor of his flat at 221B Baker Street.]
The Commissioner chuckled ruefully as he shook his head. “I’m sorry to disappoint you, but I dance like an elephant, dear Sherlock. You enjoy it?”
“Yes. The authorities have already been alerted, and Moriarty will doubtless be in custody within the hour. You may safely return now.”
When Sherlock tripped and fell, his only thought as the ground rose to meet him was, ‘Well, this was inevitable.’
For a moment, it was perfect. The weight of Holmes in his arms, the softness of his lips against his, the puff of Holmes’ breath on his face.
He was able to maintain his straight face as they arrived at the studio and as he was escorted up the stairs. His heart did a double beat when he saw John there, standing at the window, leaning on his cane. John turned when he came in, and Sherlock could see that he, too, was having difficulty keeping the relief from his face.
, indeed,” she said, her voice cutting like steel. “Yes, after your little stunt, the police were quite convinced that I must have helped you in some way. Several weeks of questioning, of course. They threatened prison. The company nearly fired me. No one would believe me when I told them that you had said nothing to me. Absolutely nothing – except promises to make introductions for me in London.”
Sherlock looked up and saw that John was right, the docks were not far off at all. Either his mind had been deceiving him as he swam, or they had drifted closer while Sherlock rested.
He told Bahdri about the morgue at St. Bart’s, and how Sherlock Holmes had come so very close to guessing everything about John. He told him about the cases and how Sherlock had developed his own science of forensics and observation. He told him about falling in love with Sherlock, and finding out that his feelings were returned. He told him about the Wilde case, and the danger it represented for him and Sherlock, about France, and the cocaine, and Sherlock’s loyalty to John despite his own fears of abandonment.
“He hasn’t moved since his brother’s people brought him back last night,” Mrs. Hudson said. “Won’t eat, won’t bathe. He’s not hurt, I think, but…” Her voice went high with worry.
They drifted back to the divan, falling back into each other’s arms. John kept his kisses sweet and mild for a minute, but then Sherlock opened his mouth slightly with a tiny vocalization that sounded like a request. John slid his tongue into that willing mouth, very gradually, exploring with care. Slowly, tentatively, Sherlock began to respond in kind.
Sherlock pressed his palms into the ground, trying to push himself upright, but then decided it would be better to simply to wait for John to return. He was just starting to shiver when John reappeared a moment later, hopping slightly as he jammed his boots on. “Thank God they were still there,” he said. “Sorry I haven’t shoes for you - again, didn’t know you were swimmin’.” Quickly he pulled Sherlock to his feet, unfolded a rough wool blanket and threw it around Sherlock’s shoulders, drawing it up to cover his wet head. “That should keep you a bit warmer, and maybe you won’t stand out quite so much. Now come on.”
The room was filled with samples of minerals, glittering in the bright light of the room. John could imagine children running from display to display, gazing at the jewel-like formations and talking of pirate treasure. One corner of the room was roped off, and glass littered the floor.
Sherlock was prepared for the shock of recognition that usually happened when he introduced himself – ‘
Sherlock stared around the room, his eyes jumping from one horrible sight to another - weeping men, weeping women, piles of rubble where the table of rich food had stood before. Then, on the far side of the room, he caught sight of one crumpled figure, black suit gone gray with dust, dust and blood glinting off the medals on his chest.
Sherlock turned to face him. The room was flooded with light, reflecting back against the mirrors and the pale wooden floor. He loved this room, and now John was in it.
For the most part, Sherlock’s expression was neutral, but for the darting eye movements of Sherlock’s deduction process. A tiny flicker of a smile appeared as he studied the picture of Rosie, but was gone almost before John could register it. His face betrayed nothing as he studied the portrait of himself, but it couldn’t have been John’s imagination that he looked at it longer than the others.
Sherlock spent the next two hours in restless impatience. What if Maja refused to go? This was her home, her birthplace. What if they were caught? What if one of them was injured in the admittedly enormous physical risk in the escape? What if they got to the embassy but the gates wouldn’t open?
“It’s the process,” John said. He fiddled for a moment with his lapels, glancing at himself in the mirror. “Do I look all right?”
Sherlock sighed. He wasn’t sure if this would be easier if John was looking at him. “Well. I was angry she had deceived you, and I didn’t want her to go on doing so. I wasn’t sure of your situation, and I thought having her with me would give us more leverage to negotiate your release. Also… she had failed her mission, to capture or kill me, to get a confession from you. I wasn’t sure what she would face in Pavlović’s hands. And I was worried about…”
John moved off the seat, down onto his knees and placed his hands around Sherlock’s hips. “Oh god yes, I promise.” He stood up and bent over, drowning in the green-blue eyes.
John stepped closer and sat down on the bed. He rubbed his arm and tried to hush him. When that didn’t work, John pulled his feet up on the bed and moved closer. He put Sherlock’s head on his lap, brushed his fingers through his curly hair and over his forehead.
From that day on, Sherlock had hours of fun deducing his fellow students, driving them mad. He deduced his professors as well, but always kept it to himself.
Sherlock slammed the door shut and locked up. He trotted down the corridor, leaving a baffled professor behind.
Sherlock gazed at the full lips as it moved while he spoke. He took a deep breath, leaned over and kissed him.
John turned his head, facing him again. He started panting as Sherlock pushed up against him, arousing him.
“Well, that’s a good thing then. I hope you thought about that formula.” Professor Linder pointed to the blackboard. “Will you please complete it?”
Sherlock sighed. “I see in the paper there’s a serial killer loose in London again. Three women strangled already, I’m expecting a call from Lestrade soon.”
He entered the building and paced down the corridor until he found someone. “Excuse me. Do you know in which room is Sherlock Holmes?”
When she returned, she held the plastic container out to him. “You can have it. I have more at home.”
Sherlock grabbed his cell phone, put it inside his trousers pocket and headed back to the door. “Shall we go,” he said keeping the door open. “I just need to get my coat in my locker.”
“He knows exactly what he’s doing. Never once did he hurt any of the staff members. A psychotic man would’ve.”
“Mycroft had plenty to talk about. I thought he came just to say goodbye,” Sherlock remarked after his mother climbed back in the car.
“I don’t have to eat. When I’m working I’m not eating.” He drank the last bit of coffee in his cup. “Why are you so tired these last few days? What is bugging you?”
“What’s going on in there?” Sherlock put the packet of biscuits down and stood up. He gasped aloud when he noticed the water on the floor. “Are you trying to flood the kitchen?”
“I know,” he whispered and ruffled the curly black hair with his fingers. He sighed before he got up. He pulled the zipper of his jeans up and slapped Sherlock’s tight butt. “Better put on your pants before Missis Hudson barges through that door. We forgot to lock it.”
“Sod this, I’m getting out.” He reached for the door handle. When he pulled it, the door didn’t open.
After he packed a few things, he put on his coat and scarf. He frowned when he noticed the expression on John’s face. “Don’t look so worried. I’ll come back.”
The paramedics barge within minutes through the door. They connected him on a heart monitor, put him on the stretcher and wheeled him out. The lift was too small for the stretcher with a patient on it to fit. They had to carry him with it down the stairs.
John remained standing on the pavement long after the car disappeared. He sighed again before heading back to the flat.
Ten minutes later, he entered his room. He chucked his sling bag on the bed, thinking again of the violin music. Maybe he should give it a try. He could make time for it.
Mycroft tapped the tip of his umbrella on the floor while he drew his lips in a thin line. “What is your business with the wife of the drug cartel lord?”
Mycroft kicked him under the table, turned back to Greg and smiled. “Decided what to order from the menu yet, dear?”
“Sherlock, you’re back.” His eyes shot full of tears. He jumped forward and threw his arms around him. “Oh god, I missed you.”
Her eyes narrowed as she paced closer to him. “I wanted to see if the rumors about you and John were true.”
Sherlock jumped out when the car stopped. He slammed the door shut and stormed into the building and up the stairs.
Two month later, professor Marks invited Sherlock to his home for the weekend. He picked him up Saturday morning. They went for breakfast at a nearby diner, did some shopping afterwards and returned to his home late afternoon.
“Huh.” He looked up and noticed the waiter. “Oh yeah, right, a beef burger and chips with fried onion rings on the side, please.”
Janet stood against the wall next to the door of 221 B, with her arms crossed. She smiled when the short dark-blonde man stepped out of the apartment building. Sherlock would follow him soon.
When he came out he nearly bumped into him. “I’m sorry for leaving, John.” He moved past him and hurried to his bedroom.
“Yes, you have to go down there and write on the board with this.” He held a piece of white chalk out to him.
Simon sighed as he shook his head after Sherlock disappeared around the corner. Why did he react that way? It was as if he had a panic attack, but why. The boy was fine until he suggested that they had supper together.
