Sherlock chuckled deeply and continued to massage for a few minutes. After his lover was relaxed enough, he spread his arse cheeks, revealing his puckered entrance. He swallowed hard, his heart pounding in excitement for what he was about to do. Leaning forward slowly, he kept John's arse spread and he slipped his tongue out of his mouth, lightly grazing his entrance.
Sherlock felt his heart clench and he brought his hand up to the back of John's head. He took his other hand and put it on the small of his back, stroking gently. "Shhh... It's okay, John. It'll all be fine," he whispered soothingly.
John looked up, relief flooding him at the same time as fear. Sherlock had died, at least for a few seconds. For a few seconds, John had almost lost him. But there was no way Sherlock could have brain damage, his brain was too powerful for that, John was sure.
John grinned back, happy at the prospect of Sherlock finally going back to school with him. "Yes, and then maybe our crazy classmates will stop thinking that I killed you or something." It would be very nice to get rid of the various stares and whispers of his peers and show them that Sherlock was alive and well.
John's breath hitched and he whimpered at the feeling. "Please, Sherlock...I need you." He dug his fingers into Sherlock's shoulders to try to keep himself from reaching down and stroking himself.
John smirked a little as they began to sway to the piece. He'd become much better at formal dancing over the years. "Am I really so inspirational?" he asked, settling his chin on Sherlock so he could look up at him.
Sherlock moaned as his lover started to move inside of him. He loved the feeling of being pierced to the core by the love of his life. It was the most overwhelming sensation he'd ever felt, far more powerful than the drugs he use to indulge in.
John's lip trembled and he sniffed a few times, letting stray tears fall. "I do. I swear I'll always be with you, and I'll always love you." He pressed his face into Sherlock's neck and closed his eyes. "I love you, so much, Sherlock."
Sherlock thought for a moment, looking back on the nightmare he'd had a few evenings ago. As long as he avoided talking about what had happened all those months ago, Sebastian would control him. He couldn't let that happen anymore.
Sherlock stood in the driveway and waved until John was out of sight. As he walked back in the house, he saw Mycroft leaning against the stair railing. "So... got yourself a boyfriend, have you?" he said and raised an eyebrow. Sherlock scoffed, "yes, problem?"
John's heart went out to the boy when he saw him flinch at his touch, but he was glad that he didn't try to move away. "Come on. I know how to fix your nose up." He offered the boy a smile and held out his hand. Now that he wasn't trying to protect him, he got a good look at him. His eyes were a piercing blue-green that he'd never seen before on a person, and his hair was a complete mess of curls in all directions, but it seemed to work for him. Not to mention he had some prominent cheekbones. He mentally scolded himself for thinking this, though. He wasn't gay... Not really anyway.
Sherlock nodded, "I know... I guess I'm just so used to having to hide it and having to deal with it alone." He leaned down and kissed John on the lips, "I'll try to be open with you about it from now on."
John stroked Sherlock long and slow, wanting to see how long his husband could last before completely losing it. He used various amounts of pressure, occasionally swiping his thumb over the head of his lover's cock, and of course still biting and suckling at Sherlock's skin.
Sherlock whimpered and reached a hand back to grasp at the nape of John's neck. He bit his lip as the song played on and could feel his fiance's erection growing against his backside, only increasing his own excitement.
John smiled wide at the sight and tossed his towel next to Sherlock's, running straight for the diving board. He bounced a few times, then jumped in, bringing his knees up in a 'cannonball' at the last second. He surfaced again a moment later and swam over to Sherlock in the shallow end.
John felt Sherlock's body trembling and started to panic. He had to snap him out of this... whatever he was having. John grabbed both of Sherlock's hands where they were clasped around his legs and he leaned forward to speak directly into Sherlock's ear. "Sherlock, listen to me. I'm here. Please talk to me." He hoped that this worked. He didn't know if he'd be able to pull Sherlock out of this episode otherwise.
John took the clothes and smirked a little. "Be right back." He went over to the mirrors and found the changing room, a small space with a chair and some hooks to hang clothes on. He slipped into the outfit Sherlock gave him, making sure to leave the top few buttons open on the shirt, and then stepped out. Leaning against the edge of a mirror with his arms crossed, he gave Sherlock a sly grin. "Well?"
Sherlock sighed and smiled, "Good... that's good." Mycroft nodded and left the room. Sherlock held John tighter and kissed his temple, settling in beside him and falling asleep shortly after.
Sherlock could feel his own heart pounding as he thought about it again and bit his lip as he rocked his hips in a steady rhythm. He let his hand trail down the centre of John's torso and leaned in to whisper in his ear again. "Would you like that, John? Would you like to feel me inside you?"
John moaned and took more of Sherlock in as a reward, rocking his hips between the dual sensations. He slipped one finger inside of Sherlock, pushing it as far in as he could. Meanwhile his mouth was working half of Sherlock's length, the other half being slowly stroked.
"Night, Da." John waved as his father got into his car and drove off. Then he turned to Sherlock and smiled brightly. "That went well I think."
John leaned as far over as he could towards Sherlock, a bit of a smug look on his face. "Yup. It was meant to be. I didn't even like boys before I met Sherlock." He smiled over at the other boy before looking back at Irene. He didn't like that expression on her face.
Sherlock laughed along with John as he squirmed and smiled triumphantly when he fell off the bed. He scooted over and hugged the pillow that his boyfriend had been laying on, burying his face in it and inhaling deeply before turning his face and grinning at John. "I'll be waiting not-so-patiently for you to return, my dear," he said, "try to pick up my homework from the office if you would, please."
"It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. John speaks very well of you," Sherlock said, taking his hand in a firm grip before releasing it and smiling nervously at him. He looked at the boy beside him and put his hand on the small of John's back in a comforting gesture. He smiled in encouragement, waiting for John to tell his father the news.
Sherlock chuckled and rested his cheek on top of John's head, almost falling asleep on the ride to school. When they arrived, Sherlock kissed John on the top of the head and kept their hands linked as they exited the car.
, John... That's good," Sherlock breathed. By now, he was in danger of biting a hole in his lip from how hard his teeth were clamping into it. He whimpered and his leg twitched as he endured the sweet torture.
Sherlock sighed happily and placed a kiss to the inside of John's wrist, "I have dreamed of you so much that my arms, grown used to being crossed as I hugged your shadow, would perhaps not bend to the shape of your body. For faced with the real form of what has haunted me and governed me for so many days and years, I would surely become a shadow," Sherlock quoted and placed another kiss, just in the center of John's palm. "That's what you are, John. You're my dream come to life and I'm so glad I finally found you." He spoke softly, holding John close and closing his eyes into the touch on his cheek, holding his hand there.
John happily kissed Sherlock in return, a bit of pride welling in his chest when Sherlock called him a hero. Out of everything he wanted to be for Sherlock, one of the most important was to be his shield, to make sure he never got hurt.
Sherlock smiled as he watched John dive and swam over to meet him as he came back up. "Well... When are you joining the Olympic diving team?" he teased and wrapped his arms around the other boy.
After a day that seemed to drag on forever, John made his way home with a certain sense of foreboding. What was so important that his father had to tell him in person?
Sherlock's eyes went wide and he sat up against the headboard, licking his lips. "Do you even have to ask?" He said huskily and grinned.
Sherlock continued to murmur sweet things to John in French as he undressed him. He connected their lips again after the other man was stripped down to his pants and flipped them so his husband was hovering over him.
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's shoulders as he settled in his lap. "We'll take it one step at a time. I was just curious. But you know, we're still going to have bills and certain things, kids or not. Electricity, water, phone, telly, not to mention buying food and supplies for the house, or whatever we live in." Thinking about it too much was actually a bit nerve-wracking. "It's hard to believe that we'll be living on our own in just a few years."
Mycroft waited for John to come out and closed the door behind him. "Okay... So maybe I should have mentioned that we also 'delete' parts of a memory we're uncomfortable with," he said quietly.
John took a deep breath, the hand on his back only helping marginally. He saw his father's gaze follow the hand and then look at him in suspicion. That pretty much gave it away already, so with a whoosh of breath, John began.
Sherlock took a sip and nodded, "yes I do, in fact." He reached out for John, "I need you to come over here and stop acting so skittish."
Sherlock hummed in content and kissed his boyfriend lazily. "I'm head over heels for you too, love," he murmured and chuckled. "No matter what, I'm always going to love you. I want you to know that," he whispered, wrapping his arms around him and stroking John's back.
John still couldn't speak. He just nodded in agreement, surprised that he could move his head. After a few moments of sheer bliss, he brought his arms around Sherlock and hugged him close. "Fantastic," he said, voice raspy from his screaming.
John nodded, repeating everything that Mycroft told him in his head. It seemed strange, but he was going to do whatever it took to make sure that Sherlock was alright. "Mycroft," he asked softly. "What makes this happen? Why did he react differently this time?" If this was something that happened before, and could happen again, he wanted to know how to avoid it.
John couldn't say no. He groaned and rocked into Sherlock's hand, his own pulling on his lover's pants until they were fully off. He grabbed Sherlock's length, stroking him so that he could get enough precum to slick his fingers.
John blushed a little, though whether it was the heat of the burner or Sherlock's closeness, he didn't know. But he was grateful for the help, because Sherlock didn't just give him the answers. He made him understand, and that in turn made it easier to understand other things. "You're quite the teacher, Mr. Holmes," he said, glancing back at Sherlock with a smirk.
John was feeling completely lost until he felt Sherlock kiss him. His eyes popped open, and he jerked back, still half-stuck in his nightmare. He blinked a few times, eyes wide and heart racing, until he finally calmed down and remembered where he was. He took a few deep breaths and slumped forward into Sherlock, hugging him. "Sorry," he whispered. "I should have mentioned I'm prone to nightmares."
Sherlock smiled and ran the backs of his fingers across John's cheek, "you're quite welcome, my love. Anytime you need me, I'm here." He leaned in to capture the other boy's lips in a sweet kiss before pulling back and resting their foreheads together. "Now we have to figure out what to wear..." he said and grinned.
John popped open Sherlock's trousers, slowly pulling down the zipper and peeling the flaps apart. Already Sherlock was half-hard and John licked his lips. "Hips up, love," he said softly, tugging at his trousers.
Sherlock hummed in response and removed his fingers, reaching in the bedside table again to grab a condom. He ripped it open with his teeth and rolled it on, biting his lip and trying not to come by just that.
Outside of the nightmare, John was fidgeting and whimpering in his sleep, mumbling incoherently as his dream self struggled to get back to Sherlock.
John gratefully followed Sherlock inside, the sounds of the drunken partygoers fading into the distance. All that was left when they reached the living room was the beat of the bass. He let Sherlock put him in a chair and stared up at him with a smirk as he started dancing again. "It's no surprise that everyone was crowding around you," he said, voice already a shade deeper. "Too bad for them, I'm the only one who gets a special dance."
John listened silently to Sherlock's story and at the end he still said nothing. Then finally, he grabbed Sherlock's face in both hands and kissed him hard for a solid minute. When he pulled away, he also had tears in his eyes, but he looked directly at Sherlock, forcing him to keep eye contact.
"It is imperative that no one mention the episode, so anyone you know who may have seen him and will have contact with him later... you need to let them know. For all he knows, he passed out on the dance floor and you called an ambulance," Mycroft whispered.
Sherlock scrunched his face up and pushed on John's chest until their lips parted. "Sebastian... no, please... I don't want to do it, please don't make me..." he whimpered and curled in on himself, rocking back and forth.
"Being expelled isn't the only thing they'll have to worry about," Mycroft spoke up from where he was leaned up against the wall. He walked forward as he spoke, "they've also been banned from every athletic program and have to do community work for the rest of the year." Mycroft put a hand on Sherlock's shoulder, "I think it's safe to say they'll be paying for what they did to both of you." He smiled and winked at John.
," he groaned. He loved this, feeling so alive and so much pleasure was shooting through his system.
John enjoyed all the speeches, his heart warming and happiness bubbling inside. By the time they got to dance, John had a healthy blush. He leaned in close to Sherlock, resting his head on the other man's chest. When he heard the song, however, he looked up at him smiling. "My talented husband."
John scratched the back of his neck and shrugged. "Well, I don't have anything specific in mind, but if you want to hang out..." He looked up at Sherlock nervously. Did he trust him enough to want to spend time with him? Did he even want to spend time with him in the first place? He waited for Sherlock's answer, wringing his hands together.
"It was to the sound of police sirens...I was aching all over and bleeding and Harry was...laying across my lap." He turned a little, trying to press his face to Sherlock's neck. "They said that she must have had a moment of sobriety...and she threw herself in front of me." He hadn't even realised until this moment as he spoke it that it was almost like the way Sherlock had saved him from the bullet, a fact that only increased his welling tears.
John's eyes widened just a bit. Moran had put him in the hospital last time? Well, that was it. He was going to have to make sure that Sebastian Moran never laid another finger on Sherlock. He was a bit surprised when Sherlock took his hand, but he smiled and squeezed back. "You're very welcome." John bit his lip. Sure, he wanted to protect Sherlock, but that would be strange if they weren't friends. So he supposed that was the next step. "So, um...Are you doing anything today?"
John shrugged. "Well, I just cleaned like usual." And texted his boyfriend constantly. "Now I'm here." His stomach growled and he curled up trying to muffle it.
"Oh. Thanks," John took the bag with a little confusion. Sherlock hadn't told him that he was going to pick something for him to wear. But he supposed it was just as well. After all, he really didn't have anything of his own. "Uh, am I supposed to tip you or..."
"Well, I can't blame him for that." John leaned back as well, enjoying the heat and the closeness with Sherlock. It wasn't long before he was sweating steadily.
Mrs. Holmes chuckled under her breath, "all right, I think I've done enough damage for now. Dinner will be ready in an hour boys, be sure to wash up." She patted John on the back and leaned down to kiss the top of Sherlock's head as she walked away. "Such good boys," she murmured and smiled.
Sherlock shrugged, "I didn't think it was anything to worry about. Sebastian always made tons of empty threats. I didn't expect him to actually try anything." He looked down at his hands as he spoke, fidgeting a little.
After several moments, Sherlock pulled away. He placed a final kiss to his lover's entrance and slipped a finger inside of him, the wetness from his tongue making it slide in easily.
Sherlock couldn't help groaning, the sounds John was making were music to his ears and he could feel his cock twitch in excitement. He slowly slid in two fingers and began to scissor them, stretching him open. After a few strokes he added a third and crooked them, trying to find his lover's prostate and commit the correct angle to memory.
"I'm the lucky one," Sherlock said and stroked the back of John's head, placing a kiss to the top of it before pulling away and laying down on the bed. "Finish getting dressed and we'll lay here for a while and talk before we sleep. I want to try and spend as much time as I can with you tomorrow." He pulled the covers down and settled under them, waiting for John to join him.
All Sherlock could manage was a groan as he let his arms drop to the bed when John untied them. He was still shaking slightly from the exertion and his heart was pounding in his ears. His eyes opened and he smiled over at his lover, lifting his arm to pull him into a kiss.
John flushed and swallowed hard. He licked his lips and tried not to imagine Sherlock tending to his...every need as he didn't want an erection when his father could come back any second. "You are too good to me," he said to Sherlock, kissing the side of his face where he could reach.
John thought that Mrs. Holmes's speech was incredibly sweet, even if she couldn't finish it. Part of him wished that his own mother still wanted to be a part of his life, that she wanted to do something like this. Sherlock was incredibly lucky to have his mother still. He was broken out of his reverie when Sherlock tried to hide and he laughed, kissing his cheek.
John watched him go, wondering who that might be on the other end. His father was supposed to be working today. He must have ran out as soon as he found out John was here. Hopefully nothing bad happened because of that.
John hummed softly, smiling back at Sherlock. "It's all right." He did understand why after so long of being hated it would be hard to believe that someone loved you. So John was just going to have to keep proving his love. He grinned up at Sherlock and took his hand to stand up. "Sounds lovely."
"Sebastian asked me to join in but I told him no," John said, casting a short glare in the convict's direction. "Then he said that they were just having fun, and that was the moment I decided to quit the rugby team. I said that if he and the other boys didn't leave that I would get the headmaster, so they finally took off."
John smiled and squeezed Sherlock's hand. He was so lucky to have such a wonderful person as Sherlock, to love and be loved by him. He followed the other boy downstairs and they got into the car together, starting off for school.
Sherlock bit his lip, "anyways... it was hard to forget something like that. So I did what I had to. I found one of the blokes at school that sold illicit substances and got some cocaine from him. It became very difficult to stop." He tightened his grip on his boyfriend's waist.
Mr. Holmes followed John out of the house and helped him into the back of the ambulance before getting into his own car to follow them to St. Bart's. He felt overwhelmingly guilty. How could he not have known what his son had been dealing with at school? He vowed to himself to be there for his son more than he had been.
As John lay with his face burrowed against Sherlock, he couldn't see the tears brimming in his eyes. But he was thinking himself along similar lines. Technically speaking, if he and Sherlock hadn't met then John probably would have continued on, dating girls and only later on perhaps discovering that he could like boys as well. But it would be the same result in the end.
Mr. Watson grinned to see Sherlock helping John with the dishes. "Thank you. You're welcome to come back for more whenever you like." He clapped the two of them on the shoulders as they stood at the sink. "Well, boys, I'll be in the living room if you need anything. Though I'm pretty sure that you'll be fine on your own, right?" He winked at John, making him blush.
He slowly descended back into his seat as Mr. Tabling said no further questions, and he looked over to Sherlock again, seeing his face enough to calm him some. He had done well, and he was so proud of him.
John rolled his eyes as Sherlock covered them, but he obliged and closed them. He let Sherlock lead him, keeping a hold of his arm until he stopped. He felt him step behind and as his eyes were uncovered, they fluttered open and- "Sherlock...This is beautiful..." John gazed at the clearing, eyes sweeping in wonder from one side to the other.
He went slowly and thoroughly until his lips finally reached Sherlock's crotch. He smirked up at him and blew on the head of his cock before coming back up and kissing Sherlock firmly on the lips.
John didn't answer. He was just overwhelmed. His father didn't seem upset at all and he was here in the same room with Sherlock. For as much pain as he was in, it was worth it if it changed things with his father. John felt tears welling in his eyes as he looked up at him with a smile.
John made a noise of frustration. Suits were so sexy and yet they were a pain in the arse when the actual sex came around. He started undoing his shirt, fumbling with the buttons and tossing his jacket off in the process.
Sherlock calmed down gradually with each kiss, relieved that John was staying, and after a few minutes he shook his head. "No... I just..." he sighed shakily, "it's okay if you don't want to... be with me. I just don't want you to leave." He bit his lip and looked away nervously. "I've never kissed anyone before that..." he said quietly, not sure if he even wanted John to hear him.
John smiled back, glad that Sherlock was eating and that he was in a better mood. He finished up his plate, then grabbed everyone's dishes and brought them to the sink, cleaning them up.
... Fuck!" Sherlock moaned and clutched at his lover's back as he pounded into him, reaching the right angle to hit his prostate dead on. This was just the most incredible thing he'd ever experienced. Sex with John was the only thing that ever made him feel this alive, feel this
Sherlock moaned softly into John's mouth and bucked his hips forward slightly. His fingers dug into his boyfriend's hip for a few moments before pulling away, groaning and throwing his head back. "Sorry..." he murmured, "this
The judge frowned and shook his head, writing something down on the paper in front of him. Helen started to panic, she had no idea John would say such things and they were losing the judge. Sherlock grinned when John held up the ring, but everyone else gasped in shock and started murmuring. "Order!" the judge said, "silence! All of you, now!" Everyone quieted down and Helen immediately took the opportunity to stand.
..." he gasped out as he felt Sherlock's tightness around him, feeling his inner walls. The friction was unbelievable and he had to force himself to keep still for Sherlock's sake.
Once he was dressed himself, he walked back into the bedroom and laid the clothes out on the edge of the bed before crawling onto the mattress and gently straddling John's hips, careful not to wake him yet. He leaned down and started pressing soft kisses all along John's throat and collarbone.
Sherlock chuckled and winked at his boyfriend, "Oh yes, I think I'd like that." Mycroft rolled his eyes, "okay, that's quite enough. I'll need you to give me directions to your flat, John, so if you could please stop making doe eyes at my brother..." he raised an eyebrow as he looked back at John.
Once he was able to get his breathing calm, he rolled off of his lover and just laid there on his back, staring at the ceiling. "I swear... sex with you just keeps getting better," he breathed and chuckled.
Sherlock smiled lovingly up at John and reached up to stroke his cheek," so are you, John," he whispered and pulled John down for a hug, embracing him tightly. "I hope you know what you're getting yourself into," he murmured. "I won't be able to let you go now, I intend to stay with you as long as I can."
He turned back to the floor, trying to see if he could see Sherlock's curly hair above all the dancers, but all he could see were hundreds of Harry lookalikes. Was he seeing things? He rubbed his eyes and looked again, their faces changing back, but it was already too much. How could they all be so stupid? How many of them would drive home tonight? He couldn't stand to be there anymore, and he went around to the dark side of the house, crouching down against the wall. Hopefully Sherlock would find him soon.
Sherlock leaned over to whisper in John's ear, "I guess I'll just have to restrain you like you did to me the other night," he murmured softly. He flicked his tongue out, letting it lightly swipe across the other boy's ear without John's father noticing and pulled back nonchalantly.
Sherlock inhaled sharply and his control snapped. He turned his face, growling and grabbed onto the back of his fiancé's head, pulling him in and pressing a firm kiss to his lips, prying his mouth open and delving his tongue inside.
John continued to kiss him, wanting to do what Sherlock had done to him the other day. He nipped gently at the skin and started sucking on the spot. His hand rested on Sherlock's side and smoothed it up and down.
Sherlock cried out when John hit his prostate with every thrust. He could feel his lover's hot breath washing over his ear and the friction on his cock with every movement. Soon he was shuddering with the intensity of his orgasm, clinging tightly to the other boy as he rode it out.
Sherlock smiled as tears fell down his cheeks, happy tears this time. He kissed John and held him close, "John Watson, I promise to love you as long as I live. You are the most amazing, kind, handsome person I have ever met. I am so lucky to have you," he cupped his boyfriend's cheek and smiled lovingly at him.
John had never before felt such a mixture of satisfaction and anger at the same time; the former to see Moran in prison garb like he should be and the latter because he hated the boy with a burning passion. He was glad that his chair was closer to the bastard than Sherlock's so he could shield him as best as he could. When Moran looked over John met his gaze with a fierce glare. If there was one thing about this situation that he wasn't afraid of, it was him.
Sherlock relaxed and closed his eyes, focusing on the touch of his lover's lips on his skin. His leg muscles twitched at John's touches and he let out a soft moan.
Sherlock shook his head, "no, you shouldn't have to... If that's what you really want, we'll make things work," he said. He never meant to make John feel guilty and he shouldn't have to sacrifice his dreams just because of Sherlock. It was a selfish thing to ask of him.
He grabbed hold of John's tongue with his teeth and sucked on it before letting go and sucking on his lower lip instead. Once he was done, he pulled away for air and breathed John's name against his lips. Then he began placing kisses on every bruise he saw.
Sherlock smiled seductively up at John and smacked his arse. He gripped tightly to his lover's waist and brought him down harder on his cock, trying to slam into his prostate with every thrust. He bit his lip and leaned his head back, gaining pleasure from it just because of John's obedience to his request.
The people at the party would have to all be in the same social class as Sherlock's family. What if they could tell that he was average, only just coming out of being poor? What would they say? Would they laugh him out of the room? He tried not to let his feelings show as he waited for Sherlock to pour the drink.
shouldn't have done that," he growled. He gave a quick look to the other players and they pushed John onto his back, holding his arms out and putting their knees on his elbows to keep him from being able to move them.
Sherlock kissed his fiance on the nose and pulled away to look in his eyes, "do me a favour though... save the special treatments just for your future husband, hmm?" he said cheekily and grinned.
Sherlock sighed and rested his cheek on the top of John's head. As the song drew to a close he pulled away and placed a kiss on his fiance's temple. He drew back further and looked down into his eyes, "I love you so much," he said softly. Sherlock gave him a quick kiss on the lips before stepping away and grabbing the other boy's hand. "Come with me, I want to show you something," he said and smiled.
When Sherlock finally came, he looked up at him with watery eyes and shook his head, pulling the other boy into him.
During the course of the school day, John received quite a few glares from the rugby team, and was quite happy to see the swollen face of Sebastian Moran, even as he was flipped off. He just hoped that the other boy had learned his lesson. No one was going to touch John Watson's boyfriend ever again.
"That's it... just like that," Sherlock murmured, nipping John's earlobe. "Now slide your thumb over the slit. I know how much you like that," he whispered. He cast his eyes down to watch his lover pleasure himself, loving every moment.
"It's... hard to explain actually," Sherlock said and sighed. "Most of the time I just lock them away, shove them to the deepest part of my mind. Sometimes..." he swallowed, hesitating to finish, but he did anyways. "Sometimes locking them away just isn't enough..." he whispered.
"Glad you enjoyed yourself," Sherlock smiled and helped John pull his pants and trousers back on. After zipping and buttoning them back up, he kissed his lover on the lips and went to grab some sleep clothes. "Do you want to see the home theatre? We could watch a film before we go to bed."
John met Sherlock's eyes, seeing exactly what he was supposed to see. Sherlock trusted him and it made him feel that much better about this. With both his hands, he pulled down Sherlock's pants and revealed his fully aroused length. John wrapped his fingers around it and slowly stroked, the rough skin feeling different in his hand than his own, but so good.
Sherlock hung up his phone and turned on his side to go to sleep. After a couple hours, he started to have nightmares of those first attacks from Moran and the others in the gym showers. He woke up sweating and gasping and was unable to sleep the rest of the night.
John just couldn't hold back anymore and his hips bucked once hard into Sherlock's hand. He immediately opened his eyes to see if anyone had been watching, but everyone in the nearby seats was distracted by one thing or another. He dared to let himself do it again, and again, keeping a close eye for any passengers turning their heads. Finally, with a soft cry of his lover's name, he was spilling out his release, eyes squeezed shut once more in pure pleasure.
He closed his eyes and rested their foreheads together, desperately wanting to go further than they had before, but unsure if John wanted the same and was ready.
John squeezed Sherlock's hands gently. "He does like you. He's just still getting used to things I guess." He released Sherlock's hands so that he could wrap his arms around the other boy. "I'm going to tell him what happened with Moran. And if he blames you for it, then I guess he's not the man I thought he was."
He reached up a hand to card through Sherlock's curls. "If I could I would flip you over and fuck you into the mattress." Where was this coming from, this sudden enjoyment of talking to Sherlock this way?
"God, John... You just get me so hot, I want to rip your clothes off every time I see you. Even when I watch you eat, I just want to take you. Every part of your body turns me on," Sherlock groaned and gripped tighter to John's hips, grinding up into him.
John relaxed a bit under Sherlock's touches. He was trying not to let himself get too worked up about it, but it wasn't easy. "One night when I was nine...Harry had been in her room, and Da was watching to make sure that she didn't leave the house. He fell asleep." He took a deep breath, focusing on Sherlock's hands, his body surrounding him.
!" he shouted. Sherlock saw Moran's finger move right before he went to pull the trigger and screamed, "No!" shoving John out of the way, knocking him to the floor.
After several minutes the friction just wasn't enough and Sherlock growled and pulled away, taking two of his fingers and sucking on them before reaching behind himself and pushing one of them inside his entrance. "I want you to fuck me," he panted, head thrown back, "I want you to pound into me John... I want to feel you deep inside me, just like this." At the end of his last sentence he took both of his fingers and shoved them deep into his own arse, leaning himself to the side so John had a perfect view of what he was doing.
Sherlock intertwined his fingers with the other boy's and brought their joined hands up to the sides of John's head. He continued to kiss him deeply and rock his hips forward slowly, just enough for a little friction, but not too hard so as not to cause himself any pain.
John flushed a bit at Sherlock's words as he left the room and the suggestion lingered in his mind. Someday he'd have to take him up on that. He found the bathroom and showered quickly, dressing before he left to go back to Sherlock's room. John stepped in and leaned back against the doorframe. "Ready for breakfast?"
As Sherlock's fingers touched his face, John felt a tingling sensation and he swallowed a little nervously, shaking his head. "No, it's alright. And, um, thank you," he said, in regard to the praise. He didn't know if he should ask Sherlock about his dating history. If Sherlock didn't have friends then he probably hadn't had girlfriends. Or boyfriends, whichever he preferred. "You could get someone, too, I'll bet. You're pretty handsome yourself," he admitted. "You're nice from what I've seen of you so far. And I'm going to guess by the chemistry set over there that you're pretty intelligent too, or at least good at science."
John smiled as he left the dining hall with Sherlock, but it dropped from his face as they met Sherlock's brother in the doorway. He could only stare up at the older boy, swallowing thickly as his gaze traveled over him. It was like Mycroft had x-ray vision, he felt so vulnerable. When Mycroft finally passed by, John let out a breath he hadn't realised he was holding. Sherlock's embrace a moment later helped to calm him down. He looked up at the taller boy and turned pink at the suggestion of kissing like they had before. "Sounds good to me." With a grin, he hooked arms with Sherlock as they went back up the stairs to his room.
John sighed. "I wish you were coming. I miss you when I have to go to school." He stepped into the shower once the water was on and pulled Sherlock in with him. "Some people think you're dead and that the school is trying to cover it up because they don't want a scandal. And some people think that I was a part of it, even though we were quite obviously snogging that day." It was then that he realised that he and Sherlock had only been together at school for one day before all of Moran's attacks. It was no wonder no one believed him; no one had seen enough proof.
"So you had no contact with Sebastian at all that day before this? No indication that he wasn't happy about you two being together? He didn't try to say anything to you or Sherlock?" Sherlock swallowed thickly, remembering what had happened at lunch, but kept quiet.
Sherlock burst through the door of the A & E, marching straight up to the nurses' station. "I'm here to see John Watson," he said firmly. The nurse looked back at him and raised her eyebrow, "I'm sorry, son, only relatives are allowed back at this time." Sherlock felt his eyes filling with angry tears, "I'm his boyfriend dammit! I demand to be able to see him!" he shouted and pounded his fist on the counter.
John kissed Sherlock back, giggling in between as the bubbles covered them. He pressed in close, their full naked fronts touching with only a thin layer of soap between. It wasn't too much of a surprise when Sherlock started to get cheeky. John let out a soft pleased sound and his hips pushed back a little on their own. "Don't tease me, love, or I'll be late for school," he warned.
His father sat opposite as John sat in the chair Sherlock had pulled out for him. "Thank you," he said as he pulled himself closer to the table.
John sniffed a few times as he caught the rag. Mycroft was right, he needed to focus. Taking a deep breath, he relaxed. He repositioned Sherlock so that he could press the rag to his head, and kept the pressure on as they continued towards the hospital. Sherlock would be alright, he just had to be.
John pressed his face to Sherlock's neck and cried softly, holding tightly to him. "N-not your fault..." he said quietly through his tears. He was just glad that Sherlock had found him at all.
Sherlock shrugged and smiled at the other man, "Dad bought this house about ten years ago, seemed a shame to waste money on a hotel." He got out of the cab and walked around to open the door for John. "After you, mon cheri," he said and grinned.
Sherlock growled and turned them so John's back was pressed against the wall of the hot tub and he was settled between his lover's legs. He swiftly pulled down both of their shorts and rutted desperately against John.
yes... S-so do you, John..." Sherlock breathed and snapped his hips up to meet his lover's thrusts. "God, you look so good bouncing on my cock. I love that I'm the only one who's ever had you like this." He moaned loudly and threw his head back.
want to tell you but, I don't think now is the time. I'll get all worked up and we still have to go to school."
Sherlock was able to get his stitches removed that Wednesday, just in time for his wound to start closing up completely. He was glad for that, because he had
John moaned softly and let Sherlock work his magic. His mouth was so talented, it was a shock that his first experience was with John only a few days ago. He slipped his legs between Sherlock's so they were loosely tangled together.
Mr. Watson squeezed his shoulder. "I'm so sorry, John." John just closed his eyes, feeling tears coming on. "We have a few days so... you can say goodbye."
Sherlock touching his inner walls. It was...indescribable. He waited, panting, and leaned forward to put his hands on Sherlock's chest.
Sherlock's eyes widened in shock, "you... love me?" he reached up with his hand that wasn't connected to the IV and turned John's face towards his. "John, I... I love you, too. I was just so scared to tell you. Afraid it would be too soon and you would run away from me. And when Moran told me that you were probably off shagging Mary... It hurt." His voice broke off at the end, not sure what else he could say.
On a hunch, Ms. Rodin spoke up, "permission to re-examine?" The judge shrugged, "I don't see why not, go ahead."
John bit hard onto his hand, crying out so loudly that it didn't seem to help that he had his fist in his mouth. He pushed up towards Sherlock's warm, wet mouth, body trembling.
"I love you, too, Sherlock Holmes," John murmured, closing his eyes. It wasn't long before the soft sound of their breathing and matching heartbeats soothed him to sleep.
Mr. Watson watched the display, feelings still a little mixed. It was one thing for Harry to like girls but another for John, his only son, to turn around and have a boyfriend. It just wasn't what he expected. But the way that Sherlock talked about him, and the emotion in his actions, was enough to make him forget for a moment that they were both boys. He put a hand on Sherlock's shoulder. "It isn't your fault, son," he said. "We could all blame ourselves for not being there when it happened."
Sherlock opened his eyes at the sound of a new voice, one he'd never heard before. He sighed and looked gratefully at the shorter boy, 17 years old if his memory served correctly, just transferred. His name was something common... Jim... or something like it. His thoughts were interrupted when Moran scoffed, "Freak here thinks he's better than us... we're gonna teach him a lesson." Sebastian turned back and punched Sherlock square in the nose, knocking him to the ground, "care to join us, John?"
of your family from me... Or maybe you're just hiding me from your sister, who knows." He shrugged and wrapped his own towel around his waist, walking towards the bathroom door.
Sherlock sat down and rested his elbows on the table, burying his face in his hands and sighing before looking back up. There were tears in his eyes as he spoke. "I don't... I mean... I just
Sherlock frowned as he heard John refer to him as his friend and climbed back in bed. He nodded when he got off the phone, "yes, you should do that," he murmured and snuggled deeper under the covers. "I think I'll just stay here, I'm not feeling well. Mycroft can still take you to school."
Sherlock moaned, "John... Get the rest of these clothes out of the way as soon as possible before I rip them off of us." He tightened his grip on John's back. His self control was very thin and he didn't want to ruin such lovely suits in his enthusiasm.
Sherlock kept staring out the window with a frown on his face. Of course he had wanted to have a quick snogging session before John had to leave, but the real reason he wanted him to stay was much more important. He was afraid that once he had to sleep alone again, the nightmares would return.
"Oh yeah." John pulled out his mobile and dialed his house. After a few rings the machine picked up. "Hi da, it's me. I'm um, staying with a friend tonight. Don't worry about clothes, I'm going to borrow some. I'll see you tomorrow!" He hung up and then snuggled against Sherlock again. "There. All taken care of."
Sherlock closed his eyes, a few tears falling. He could only imagine what John had gone through in those moments. When he opened them back up, he locked gazes with his fiance again.
Sherlock laughed, "yeah probably not..." He smiled down at John and gave him a peck on the lips, "I love you too." He sighed and pushed himself up, deciding he needed to get them cleaned up before they fell asleep and ended up stuck together. He bit his lip as his softened cock slipped out of John's body and proceeded to remove the condom and get out of bed to throw it away and grab a wash rag.
"I pushed her away and told her that I was with Sherlock, but she didn't say anything, just kind of smirked. And then I realised that something wasn't right. I ran back to where I had left Sherlock and could hear him calling my name as I got closer. The whole team had surrounded him again and were attacking him." He held back a shiver as he remembered. That was only the first time that he had been terrified of losing his fiance.
John shook his head in amusement. "I'm not surprised. At this point, I don't think I can be surprised anymore by anything." He snuggled into Sherlock's side, taking a sip of pop as the film began.
Sherlock slowly came to and when he felt John's arms around him he clung to him as tightly as he could. "Please, John... Don't let him make me do it again, I don't want to do it again..." he sobbed and shook, holding fast to the other boy as tears streamed down his face.
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes, "yes, Mycroft... Do you have it?" Mycroft went inside his room and Sherlock heard some papers rustling, then footsteps.
He dashed out to the car park but then realized that he couldn't take Sherlock to the hospital on a bike. What could he do before the rugby players regained themselves and gave chase?
Sherlock smiled, they lay there talking about their future until it was time for dinner. After they ate, Sherlock led his fiancé up to the bedroom and stopped in the middle, pulling John into his arms and leaning down to give him a long, passionate kiss. He pulled away slightly, eyes still closed. "John... I want to try something with you," he whispered against the shorter boy's lips.
John glared at her back as he left, ignoring her little extra movements as he was sure that she was trying to goad him. He turned back to Sherlock and sighed. "Well. I can see why you're so annoyed by her. And she wasn't even trying to come on to me."
The usher nodded and then took his seat. Ms. Rodin approached the witness stand and smiled reassuringly before beginning her questioning. "John, why don't you start from the beginning. When did you and Sherlock first meet?"
Sherlock put on a lopsided smile and cocked his head to the side, "why are you looking at me like that?" he asked and kissed John on the cheek, "what are you thinking about?"
The first half of the day went pretty smoothly. During lunch break John went to the office where he was giving quite a stack of homework for Sherlock. Whatever classes his boyfriend was taking, he was quite glad that he wasn't in them. After stuffing those away in his bag, he went to the cafeteria and bought himself lunch. But...Where was he going to sit? He'd sort of alienated himself with his dating and defense of Sherlock. And with the other boy not here, John found himself completely alone. This must be what it felt like for Sherlock, and it broke John's heart that he'd had to go through that for so long.
," John said, keeping his gaze locked with Sherlock's. "I wouldn't have made it," he admitted quietly.
John smiled and bent down to kiss Sherlock's forehead, hand cupping his face. "I will. I'm going to borrow your clothes by the way, since I don't have any of mine but the ones I wore yesterday. I hope no one looks at me funny if I'm trying to catch your scent on them all through class." He winked and went to the closet to find something that would fit him. Once he'd gathered an outfit he headed for the door. "See you later. I love you."
That was only increased when Sherlock said he wanted to testify. This was exactly what he was trying to prevent. "Sherlock, no! There has to be another way. I can't be up there with you if you start to...you know." He left 'have an episode' hanging in the air. "Can I?" He looked back to Ms. Rodin, wondering if maybe there was some way that he could at least sit with Sherlock as long as he promised not to speak.
Sherlock shook his head and smiled fondly at John, "don't you see? You're still here. I'm still here, I'm still
John swallowed hard. The thought of having Sherlock twice in one night only served to increase his arousal. He moved on Sherlock, rolling his hips so their still-covered erections rubbed together deliciously. John moved his hands up to Sherlock's tie, loosening it from his neck so that he could open the buttons on his shirt and reveal that gorgeous pale skin. He bent to start nipping at Sherlock's collarbone.
John managed to stop himself until he felt Sherlock coming apart beneath him. Sherlock's sounds, movements, and his clenching around his cock was all it took to make him lose control. He spilled out deep inside of Sherlock, crying out his lover's name with his release.
John grinned. "Yes. Anything at all." He was actually excited about this himself. He was certain Sherlock could be very creative if he wanted to be.
John shook his head. "I hadn't even been going to the school that long before the first attack. Maybe a week."
Sherlock smiled reassuringly and patted John's hand, "well... we will get started right away." Sherlock spent the rest of the day helping John as much as he could on labs and their class assignments. Their last class was Chemistry and Sherlock stood behind his fiancé, hand wrapped around the other boy's as he held a beaker full of water over a Bunsen burner.
Mycroft looked at both boys in the rear view. "All I ask of you both is please no snogging in my car, contain those teenage hormones."
he thought and suddenly felt a tugging in his stomach, not wanting John to be uncomfortable and choose to leave instead of staying. He grabbed John's arm and smiled reassuringly at him, "let's go inside." He lead the shorter boy into the house and through the foyer, stopping at the bottom of the spiral staircase and yelling up, "Mum, I'm home!" His mother yelled back down, telling him that dinner should be ready soon and he better eat this time. Sherlock rolled his eyes and turned to John, grabbing his hand and squeezing, "Come on, I'll show you my room."
John stayed in the hospital as much as he could, but his father wanted him to go to school, so he did grudgingly. All of his free time was spent with Sherlock, making sure that he was comfortable until they would let him go home. He of course was completely on board for going home with Sherlock over the weekend and his father relented, just reminding him to take it easy on the boy. But John had no intentions of doing anything with Sherlock, not until he was ready. Even then, he would be careful with him.
Sherlock chuckled when he saw John blushing, glad that he remembered the song. He rested his cheek on top of the shorter boy's head and closed his eyes, focusing entirely on this moment and his fiancé held tightly in his arms.
Sherlock kissed John on the top of his head and then leaned his cheek against it. "Well then, I suppose I'll never know how it feels to make love with someone I don't feel that way for."
Sherlock moaned and pushed John away, following him back and crashing their lips together. He started working on the other boy's trousers and managed to get them undone and off in record time. He pulled his pants off as well and turned to start the water running.
... I have you and that's all I need to be happy. The fact that we're still here together after everything speaks volumes about our love. I
As soon as they pulled into his driveway, Sherlock jumped off the bike and when John was done shutting it off and putting up the kickstand, he grinned deviously at him and picked him up, throwing him over his shoulder and heading inside the door.
Mycroft nodded and thought for a few moments before speaking. "Okay, you have to listen to me and follow my instructions, because it's very important. If you don't, he may not come out of this without wanting to..." he frowned and furrowed his brow, then shook his head.
Sherlock stayed silent until John left and then he let the tears start to fall down his cheeks. If John really loved him, he wouldn't be ashamed to tell his father about him and he couldn't get rid of the pain he felt deep in his stomach over it.
Sherlock walked them through the door and released John's arm. He sauntered slowly and deliberately over to the bed and laid down, spreading himself out and smiling over at John. He patted the bed next to him, "care to join?" he said huskily.
John laughed a little, ending in a sigh. "Yeah, I guess. See you tomorrow then." He gave Sherlock one last, lingering kiss and then turned to open the door. He waved at Sherlock and then stepped inside, heading up to the flat.
," Sherlock moaned and leaned his head back. He slipped in another finger and by memory alone, pressed both fingers against his lover's prostate. He continued to roll his hips against the other boy's, getting closer and closer to release.
The room was filled with murmurs as an officer brought in Moran. He was handcuffed and wearing a prison outfit, head down as he walked. When he was seated, he looked over at Sherlock and John with an evil grin and winked at them.
Sherlock frowned, but kept listening and hugged John tighter. He knew this was something that was hard for his fiancé to talk about and wanted to give him what support he could.
Sherlock groaned and moved his hips faster, "yes... so close. Finish with me, love," he murmured. He could feel himself nearing the edge and held on as long as he could before he was crying out his release. He whimpered as he came back down, slumping back onto the bed.
He shook his head in disbelief as they walked inside. At least from here it didn't look like anything but a really fancy catering hall. He smiled seeing Mr. and Mrs. Holmes and returned the latter's embrace. John eyed the bar for a moment. He'd have to see if they had anything virgin.
"Sherlock, stop," John said softly, his own tears resurfacing because of Sherlock's. "I would never do that to you." He brushed a few stray tears from Sherlock's pale cheeks and bent to kiss his forehead. "I don't want some random girl that I don't even know. I want you. I..." He paused, swallowing thickly. "I love you." He flushed and looked away. "I know it seems too soon but I just...even if it's not full on yet, I know it's going to happen."
John couldn't believe that Sherlock had pushed him away, and was actually a bit hurt. Unless his dream self had taken the kiss as though it was Sebastian. But why would that make sense? John didn't know what to do. Maybe he could talk to him again.
John bit his lip, a deep groan threatening to escape him. He panted through his nose, not even daring to open his eyes for fear that everyone around them was looking at him and able to see exactly what was going on. But he wouldn't make Sherlock stop, not at this point.
John gasped at the feeling of Sherlock coming inside of him, filling him with the hot result of their love-making. That was certainly a new sensation, and he whimpered softly as he collapsed backward. "God, Sherlock..."
," he groaned and tried his hardest not to buck up into the warmth and wetness of John's mouth. He loved this and knew he'd never get tired of being intimate with John because the sensations were just indescribably good.
Sherlock thought for a moment, but then shook his head, "No, I don't. As long as I'm with you, I want the world to know it. I don't care if that means more teasing. I would go through anything if it meant I could be with you." He smiled lovingly at John before leaning down and kissing him, this one much less urgent, more loving and slow.
John moaned softly, his own hips moving to meet Sherlock's. It had been over a week by now and he was a bit extra sensitive.
John groaned and sucked on Sherlock's tongue as it invaded his mouth. He was pretty much ready now and continued to rock into his lover's lap, the friction evading him because of the resistance of the water. He whined and pulled back to go back down to Sherlock's neck. "I don't remember their names, I don't even remember their faces. I don't know what it feels like to be had by anyone but you."
"Oh, God..." Sherlock breathed and let his head fall back. He bit his lip, trying to stay quiet and a small whimper made it out through his nose.
Ms. Rodin sighed, "I'm not sure what else we can go over today. I think we all need to regroup and meet again on Monday. If you think of any other details you've left out, write them down and tell me. We can't afford to be surprised by anything in court." She gathered her things and walked out the door, Siger following behind.
Sherlock slid down the door and buried his face in his hands, elbows rested on his knees. He wanted more than anything for John's father to be completely accepting of them because he knew how important it was to John.
Sherlock whimpered into the kiss and grasped tighter to his lover's hips. He tugged at the hem of his jumper and pulled it up and off, reattaching their lips as soon as it was gone. He ran his hands all along John's torso and rocked his hips up once, trying to get friction for his growing arousal.
Sebastian moved in closer and put his hand around Sherlock's throat, "oh, well Mary has decided she has a crush on John... wants him to fuck her. I'd say they're probably taking care of business right this second," Sebastian said and grinned.
Sherlock could tell that John was nervous and pulled him in, resting one hand on his hip and clasping their other hands together. "Just relax," he said softly and pulled him even closer, "and follow my lead."
John sighed as he watched Sherlock go, knowing that he probably wouldn't eat more than that. "Is he alright?" his father asked.
He arranged for a suit to be brought to John's flat. He decided on a nice periwinkle coloured tie, knowing it would bring out the blue in John's eyes. Sherlock's own suit was made in the same way as John's, but he had a deep purple tie instead. After he finished adjusting himself, he smiled and walked out the door to the limo his parents had arranged to go pick up John and take them to the castle (yes, castle) where they were having Sherlock's party.
John turned back to him and leaned in to kiss him slowly. "I love you, too." He smiled brightly and stayed snuggled against Sherlock until the plane finally landed. Once they were able to leave, the pair grabbed their carry-ons and made their way into the airport. They got their luggage, called for a cab, and made their way to the hotel.
"I would like to add that at this point, one of the professors, Gregory Lestrade, came upon the scene and was able to shoo the boys off. He then called an ambulance, as you see in his statement there." She nodded towards one of the papers in front of the judge. "Now, let's talk about the shooting," Helen continued, "start from that morning."
Sherlock nipped at John's jaw, "Okay... Now you can finger yourself. I want to see your arsehole stretched around your fingers." He placed soft, open-mouthed kisses all along his lover's jaw and neck, humming against the skin.
Sherlock's mother looked at her husband and laughed, "my! It's about time you told us!" Before Sherlock could say anything, his father raised his hand, "honestly, Sherlock, you underestimate us. It's kind of hard not to notice the ring John's wearing." He nodded towards the boy's left hand.
John grinned, kissing him back and cupping his cheek. "I love you, too," he said, pressing his forehead to Sherlock's. "Now, you have to pick out something to wear for yourself."
Sherlock took the time to show John how all the controls worked before they started and let him warm up by playing by himself a couple times. They finally played against each other and Sherlock did end up winning, but it was a very close game.
Sherlock sat holding John's hand as his mother attempted a speech, bursting into tears just like she did at his birthday. He blushed as Mycroft told stories of his 'little brother, Sherly' and teared up at Mary Morstan's speech. She spoke of how amazing he and John were together and how she considered them both her best friends. He raised his glass for each toast, clinking glasses with his husband (sparkling grape juice for both of them).
John hummed and kissed Sherlock back, propping himself on his elbows. He let Sherlock clean him off and then pulled up his pants and trousers. At the thought of having to go back to the party, John groaned but then sighed. "Well, at least Irene will know exactly what we were doing when I waddle back inside," he said with a smirk. He sat up fully and watched nervously as Sherlock picked up his gift. "I hope that you like it. I only had so much money..."
your first. I mean, you'd never had sex with another boy before..." Sherlock smiled at John and got lost for a while, remembering their first time together.
Sherlock opened the door, still holding John's hand. Inside, there were rows and rows of clothes and accessories. Most of the clothing still had the tags on them, as Sherlock hadn't had the opportunity to wear them all. He turned around to face his fiancé, giving him a lopsided grin.
Sherlock dried himself off and took John's hand when they were both dry. He led them back to his bedroom and arranged them on the bed so that they were facing each other, legs tangled loosely. He sighed and reached out to run his fingers through his lover's hair. "My father told me something earlier tonight... It concerns both of us, but I told him that I wanted to be the one to tell you," he murmured, brow furrowed in concentration.
After several moments, Sherlock released John's lips, but rested their foreheads together. "I love you so much," he whispered and smiled at his fiancé. "I'm so sorry I ever doubted you, I promise it will never happen again." He lifted both his hands to cup the other boy's face and placed another soft kiss on his lips. Sherlock then stood up and held his hand out to help his fiancé up. "Come on, let's go back to the party... I want to dance with you again."
in his head and he brought up his hands and clenched them tightly to his head, covering his ears. "Shut up... just
Sherlock started to panic, this must be how John felt whenever Sherlock had an episode. Remembering what John had done for him, he grabbed his boyfriend's face and started to kiss him as firmly as he could. "John... Please, wake up!" he shouted in between kisses.
John took the invitation and pressed a trail of kisses along the sharp line of Sherlock's jaw as he spoke. He liked the way that Sherlock's deep voice vibrated under his lips as he kissed him. When Sherlock looked back into his eyes, he smiled and put his hand over his fiance's. "Everyone who called you that just doesn't understand. Yeah, it's kind of bizarre when your whole life comes out of the mouth of a stranger, but it's also really fantastic. It's like magic."
Sherlock pulled away from the kiss and sucked on John's lower lip before letting it go. "God, you're so gorgeous," he said huskily. "I just love the way you look when you're like this, so open and vulnerable... All for me."
John didn't like the look in Sherlock's eyes. He'd never seen him like that before. "I don't know..." He leaned in gently pressing his lips to the other boy's as a test. "Sherlock?" he asked softly. "Can you hear me? It's John."
Sherlock held John and was silent, thinking about the whole situation with his boyfriend's father. He couldn't help but feel a little guilty about it, because Sebastian was right. John wasn't like him. He had never been with another boy before and had they never met, he would be going after some girl.
Sherlock sighed and frowned, "fine... As you wish... Doctor Watson," he smirked as he said it and winked. "I submit myself to your care," he murmured huskily and laid back, his arms spread out by his sides.
John immediately rubbed his back, rocking him slowly. "I wish I could have been there for you. I'm afraid we're not going to get a decent night's sleep until we live together."
Sherlock felt his heart drop, "the... army? You... no! You can't!" He retreated to the other side of the bed, shaking his head, "you can't leave me... I... I'll get mum and dad to pay for your school, you can't... you promised you wouldn't leave," he murmured, his voice dropping to a whisper at the last few words.
John blushed lightly, kissing Sherlock back and wrapping his arms around the other boy's waist. He loved waking up like this, with Sherlock being the first thing he saw, being able to kiss him good morning.
Mary nodded, "yes, of course." She walked away, but turned back with a smile. "Just so you know, you two are officially the hottest couple at school now." She winked and turned away, walking back down the hall.
John smirked a bit. "I think you've got better self control than I do," he said. "You'll probably be pulling me off of him anyway."
"I told you, love, it takes as long as it takes." John grinned up at him and sat up to stretch. He folded their blanket up and waited for the plane to stop. As they descended he could see the tip of the Eiffel Tower in the distance and couldn't help the excitement bubbling inside of him.
John could only imagine. Knowing his father, he might try to give him 'the talk'. He washed down Sherlock's front, making sure to get his arms and legs as well. "There, I think you're nice and clean."
Sherlock was able to keep his mind off of his nightmare the evening before by focusing fully on his schoolwork. Lunch came quickly, thankfully, and Sherlock waited at the table for John to come eat with him.
Sherlock groaned and turned his head to nip John's earlobe. "You can't resist me either, don't deny it. I bet you're imagining me touching you right now, aren't you? That it's my hand on you, stroking you," he murmured huskily. Two could play that game and he knew how much John loved his voice.
"Oh it was very much mutual. After all, I did try to seduce you the first day we met. You're just so sexy I couldn't help myself." Sherlock leaned forward and kissed down the side of his lover's neck as he continued to wash him.
John's eyes screwed shut as he was attacked with the dessert, and he gave Sherlock an evil smirk. "That's how you want to play, then?" He pressed his plate into Sherlock's face, moving it around to make sure he was evenly covered. He peeled the plate away and let his tongue trail over his cheek. "It is pretty good."
"We can talk," John suggested. He paused for a moment to think of what they might talk about. One idea popped into his head. "We're graduating this year," he said. "What are you going to do afterward?"
Sherlock shook his head, "there's not really a definitive answer for that. It could be a number of things. Sebastian has always had a problem with me, whether that's because of my intellect or me being gay, I'm not sure. He has his own things he deals with... not that I'm defending his actions at all, because I'm not." He grabbed John's hand and placed it gently on the healing wound on his side. "This? Will heal... It will go away and only leave a small scar. But what Moran did, he will have to pay for... for the rest of his life. He will never heal, he will never get better."
Mr. Watson nodded, smiling. "That's good. I'm glad that you healed up well." He took a few bites before turning more serious. "John and I owe a lot to you, Sherlock. I'm always going to be grateful for what you did to save my job."
John looked down at Sherlock with curiosity. "Yeah, anything I guess. What do you have in mind?" He arched a little into the touch of Sherlock's figers. He wasn't sure if he was going to want to get up tomorrow, he was so warm and comfortable.
John's breath hitched and then he was crying out as he felt both Sherlock coming against him and his fingers inside. He too orgasmed, pleasure rushing through him as their cum mixed together between them. Body still shaking, John slumped forward, pushing Sherlock back until he was against the wall and stayed there, trying to catch his breath.
Sherlock returned the kiss and beamed down at the other boy before connecting their lips again. He pulled away again with a sigh and grabbed John's hand, lacing their fingers together. "It's time to meet with the lawyer again," he said and squeezed his hand.
John was sad that this would be his last night with Sherlock for the week, but he knew that Sherlock would certainly have something planned for that night. And he wasn't disappointed when his fiancé pulled him in once they were back in his room. He licked his lips, looking up at him with a smirk. "Anything you want, love. I'm game."
John was a little annoyed with himself that he needed help, but he let Sherlock assist him only as much as he needed. When they were in the car and Mycroft asked where to go, he shrugged a little. "I don't know. I guess I should go home." He looked to Sherlock, reluctant to leave him. "But you know, Da should be working so maybe if you want to come over for a bit," he said with a smirk.
John shot an apology to the people that Sherlock was bowling over in his haste. "No, but you have to remember you have longer legs!" He nearly had to leap with each step to keep up with his frantic husband. "Calm down, Sherlock, we've got plenty of time."
Sherlock laughed at the figures on top of the cake, shoving John's down just a little further, claiming he did it to make it more 'anatomically correct'. He smirked at his new husband and they grabbed the cake knife, cutting the cake together as the photographer snapped about a million photos.
Sherlock lifted his head and swallowed nervously, this was the part he was worried about, the cross-examination. He knew that the defence lawyer could be ruthless. "Sherlock, let me ask you something..." Mr. Tabling said before he even stood, "have you ever said anything to provoke my client?"
"I'm lonely. I wish you were here," John said. "I don't know how I'm going to sleep without you." He rolled onto his stomach, putting the phone on speaker and laying next to it on the pillow. "How are you?"
His brother came back to the door with an envelope and handed it to Sherlock. "Now we're even," he said firmly and Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock watched as Ms. Rodin approached the stand, wondering what she could possibly be asking. "When did you start doing the drugs, Sherlock?"
Mr. Watson started setting out the food and plates. "The sooner the better. Get that little bastard locked up." He sat down and served the two boys and then himself.
John followed Sherlock eagerly upstairs and let out a soft pleased sound as he was pinned back. He kissed him back, humming at the attention to his backside. Without opening his eyes, he tilted his head and buried his fingers in Sherlock's curls on the back of his head. "Why don't you do something about it?" he said, slowly grinding his hips forward.
Sherlock hummed into the kisses, letting his hand stroke along his lover's hip. They continued to kiss and touch until Sherlock finally fell asleep, head tucked under John's chin.
John grabbed his hands and looked up at his fiance. "You alright?" He knew that the ever-perceptive Sherlock could certainly tell that the mention of the attack on John wasn't the best thing to bring up. But he didn't want him to feel bad about it. It was John's job to let his father know about these things, and he probably should have told him the whole truth from the beginning. He was likely to find out at the trial anyway, if John was asked about it.
Sherlock smiled, "John," he said softly. His voice still wasn't fully back yet, so it was raspy, but he brought his hand up and cupped John's cheek, saying the words he never thought he'd get to again. "I love you."
Sherlock gave John's rear a good smack as he walked out the door and chuckled, "yes, you had better... Or I may end up ravishing you before you have a chance to stop me." He winked at his fiancé and started getting dressed himself, settling on just a pair of sleep pants and his dressing gown.
Sherlock managed to stifle the moan that rose in his throat. He bit his lip and breathed heavily through his nose as he tried his best to stay quiet, careful not to alert the other passengers.
had ever been this kind to him, not even close. He felt so connected to John in that moment that all he could do was reach forward with a shaky hand and place it on John's cheek, pulling his face closer to his own. He was breathing rapidly and his heart was pounding again as he closed the distance between them and placed a soft kiss on John's lips, unable to resist anymore. He let his lips linger for a moment before pulling away again, his eyes still closed. "Are you sure?" he asked softly, barely above a whisper. He had never been more scared in his entire life. He was terrified that even though John had confessed his feelings, he would run from the building after this.
He looked down at Sherlock, so beautiful beneath him, and kissed the tears from his face. John brushed the back of his fingers over Sherlock's cheek and thrust a little harder. "God...you're so gorgeous...So perfect..."
"Don't apologise, I know how they can be, trust me." Sherlock smiled reassuringly at John, "is there anything I can do to help?" he asked and brushed a few stray hairs away from his boyfriend's face.
They laid there together until the sun rose and Sherlock started placing gentle kisses all over John's face. "Time to get up, love... you have to go to school," he murmured.
Sherlock moved to nuzzle and kiss John's neck as his hands continued their journey across his body. "So beautiful," he whispered against his lover's skin. Sherlock had never experienced such affection and love as he did right now. The gentle exploration of each other's bodies warmed his heart.
After a long moment, he pulled away and panted lightly. "Do you...have anything?" he asked, referring to condoms or even just lube. It was Sherlock's first time and John's first time with a boy, so it was best to be as safe and gentle as possible
Sherlock grinned, "except for my mind... That, I'm afraid, is a hopeless cause." He grabbed the rag from John and squirted more soap on it. He turned his fiancé around and started to wash his back.
"It wasn't just one attack... it was twenty-seven. Sebastian said... he wanted to make sure everyone on the team got a turn with me."
tease you are." He chuckled and climbed onto the bike, pressing as close as he could to John and giving a subtle roll of his hips against his fiance's arse.
They took his father's car, John giving him directions. Mr. Watson's reaction to the house as they pulled up was much the same as John's was but he smiled at him. "Don't worry. They don't really care too much about the difference." He and his father stepped out and rang the doorbell.
Sherlock nodded, "yes, I think that would be wonderful... wait right here," he smiled and walked over to the dj, whispering something in his ear. The dj nodded and changed the song. A familiar soft tune came over the speakers...
John kissed Sherlock again at the sight of that smile. "I don't know how, but you just managed to be super sexy and super adorable at the same time." He trailed his hand back down Sherlock's torso and paused at his hip. "If you're really alright, we'll keep going."
John shook his head, slowly looking down. "No. He just let them do it." He glanced back up and over at Sherlock, seeking to give and receive comfort as they both struggled with the painful memory.
Sherlock rolled his hips back, trying to get John's fingers inside of him. He whimpered into the kiss and reached down to tug at his fiancé's cock once before letting go, trying to tease him.
John pulled his fingers out and flipped Sherlock around, pressing him against the wall. He ground his cock against his fiancé's arse and then moved himself inside. "Oh,
Sherlock sighed happily and took John's hand as he led him out to the car park. "This is the first time I'll be spending the night at your place... should be interesting," he smiled and winked at his fiancé.
Sherlock raised his head and smiled at John, "like I said... You smell good." He leaned down and started placing soft kisses to every ticklish spot he could remember on his fiancé's neck, speaking in between kisses. "I... Love... You... More... Than... Anything."
Sherlock reached back and let his fingers trail down John's back, slipping teasingly between his arse cheeks. He pulled away from the kiss, moaning loudly and panting. "John... You're so
Sherlock grinned, "I love you so much. You've turned my world around, quite completely. Thank you... for loving me, for giving me a chance. I will never be able to tell you enough how grateful I am for you."
John pressed into Sherlock as close as he could, slipping one of his legs between Sherlock's. He started to suck a mark onto his neck as he moved his leg to rub against Sherlock's crotch.
Meanwhile, the girl that had cornered Sherlock was still trying her best to grind against him. Sherlock groaned in frustration and pushed her away again, "Look... What's your name?"
Sherlock hummed and gave John a quick peck on the lips. "I'm really curious... What was your first impression of me?" He asked and ran his fingers through the other boy's hair.
"If it helps... I could ask my father if he could get you a job at the hospital. You could make money and get experience for school," Sherlock said and rubbed his hands along John's lower back, unable to stop touching him for even a moment.
Sherlock smiled and lifted John's shirt up, taking it off slowly and gently so he wouldn't risk hurting him. He tossed it away and slid his hands down his boyfriend's sides, settling them on either side of his waist. Slowly, he leaned towards John's torso and let his lips ghost over every bruise and cut, breathing out softly and looking up at John for any signs of discomfort.
John let a few tears fall before pushing up to face the lawyer again. He wiped his eyes and then sniffed up a few times. "No. She's right. I have to finish." He needed to do this to make sure that Sherlock didn't have to testify too. He cleared his throat and pressed on.
John hummed deeply in content. "Very much so." He wrapped his arms around Sherlock and snuggled against him. "You are fantastic."
The next morning John was well rested and happy to find that Sherlock was in his bed with him. He would never get tired of waking to his fiance's beautiful face. John pressed gentle kisses to his forehead, cheeks, nose, everywhere.
John looked up when Sherlock said that he hadn't eaten since Tuesday. It was Friday. "Sherlock, that's not-...not..." His spoon dropped into the bowl as his mouth dropped open. Sherlock was- "Gorgeous..." John blushed as he realised that he had said that out loud, but he couldn't have stopped it if he tried. Sherlock's skin was all pale and smooth, and for someone so skinny he certainly had some toning. Not to mention that without his trousers, John got a much better look at his arse.
John looked back to Sherlock as well, wishing he could do something to let him know he was there. But he would follow Mycroft's directions. He was not going to mess up again. He turned to Mycroft again after a moment and smiled a bit. Even though they hadn't had the same dynamic as he had had with Harry, he could tell the elder Holmes felt just the same as she must have. "You're a good brother, Mycroft" he said.
Later that evening after Sherlock finished up his homework and worked on an experiment, he picked up his mobile to call John. He laid on his bed, staring at the ceiling while he waited for him to answer.
John grinned and went to the snack cart. He grabbed a bottle of cola for himself, some popcorn, and a box of candy. Then he picked a seat and beamed at Sherlock as he waited for him to pick a film.
much," he murmured. After he was able to catch his breath and slow his heart rate back to normal, he turned over onto his lover and gave him a passionate kiss. "Allow me to return the favour," he whispered and leaned down to kiss John's neck.
John listened to Mycroft as he spoke, not once taking his eyes off of Sherlock until he was done. Then he slowly turned back towards him and nodded once. "I...I love him, too. He's so special," he said quietly. Then with more determination he continued, "I swear, I never had anything but good intentions and that won't change. I will take care of him and protect him and stay with him as long as he wants me around."
He found it hard to keep his hands to himself while they rode, but knew that as soon as he touched his fiancé, he wouldn't be able to control himself, so he sat on his hands and looked out the window, biting his lip and praying that they got home soon.
Sherlock straddled his fiancé's hips, laughing along with him. After a couple more minutes, he leaned down and kissed him, prying his mouth open with his tongue. Soon the tickling became stroking as he slid his hands along John's sides with agonising slowness.
Sherlock's morning went by relatively slowly and without incident until it was time for gym. He was washing himself off in the shower when a sharp vision of the attacks that happened there flashed through his mind. He gasped and fell to the floor, curling up against the shower wall and rocking back and forth for several minutes. Somehow he was finally able to calm himself, but by the time he got ready, he was almost fifteen minutes late for lunch.
John came back up and kissed Sherlock deeply. He pulled away and stroked his face. "We don't have to do this," he said. "I do miss your hands."
John let his hand fall away, feeling terrible. He sighed and turned away. "I'm sorry." He looked out the opposite window, trying to understand what he could have done wrong to make Sherlock so upset.
John knew he wasn't going to last much longer once Sherlock finally entered. He was already having trouble holding on now, his cock dripping with precum. He pushed his hips towards Sherlock as he felt him so close to his entrance, whining in impatience. "Yes...please, Sherlock."
John kissed him back, holding tightly to him. Sherlock was all he had right now. "Thank you, Sherlock." He rested his head on Sherlock's chest and closed his eyes. "Just give me a minute to calm down and we can go. I don't want to drive with my eyes all blurry." He stayed there with Sherlock, willing the tears away and steadying his breathing. Once he felt like he was alright, he pulled back and nodded once before getting on the bike.
Mary kept searching, both of them calling out Sherlock's name repeatedly. She thought she heard something and stopped, focusing in the direction she heard what sounded like someone sobbing. "Shhhh..." she said, holding out her hand towards John, "do you hear that? Sounds like it's coming from the linen closet..."
John let out a whimper, trying so hard not to be completely turned on by what his fiance was saying. He swallowed again, with more difficulty this time. "Sherlock..." But in another moment he had went back to what he was doing, leaving John in a half-aroused daze. He shook his head and rinsed himself completely before joining Sherlock outside of the shower to dry off.
"Just now," John said, putting his hands on Sherlock's shoulders when he was pulled into the other boy's embrace. "It was just a joke, I didn't mean anything by it." He playfully licked Sherlock's nose.
Sherlock released John's hand and ran his fingers through his curls, "Not that I know of," he said, surprised John would want anything to do with him after this. "Why? Did you have something in mind?" He hoped he wasn't misreading things, but it seemed as if John wanted to spend more time with him and he was more than willing, in fact it was the first thing he'd looked forward to since... well, ever.
Sherlock swayed back and forth as he played, getting lost in the music. He opened his eyes and looked over at the bed to see John looking back at him. He locked gazes with him and his mouth quirked into a soft smile as the song drew to a close.
John quirked his mouth. He hadn't wanted to have to say all the details, because Sherlock didn't know what had happened, but he should have known that they were going to want to hear everything. "Sherlock and I were about to leave when a girl, Mary Morstan, came up to us and asked if she could speak to me alone. She took me around a corner and...She kissed me." He turned away, not meeting Sherlock's or Ms. Rodin's eyes. "I pushed her off, of course, and then I heard Sherlock shouting and I ran back."
"So when you returned, you just ran up and started attacking the boys surrounding Sherlock, correct?" Helen was pacing back and forth now, hands clasped behind her back. Sherlock was feeling a bit intimidated by now and he wasn't even being questioned. He could only imagine what John was going through.
"That's true," John said. "We do have a strong connection. Two halves of one whole." He smiled up at his husband as they continued to sway to the music, ignoring the rest of the guests in favour of getting lost in Sherlock's eyes.
Sherlock looked back down at John, "Come on, we'll be late for our first class," he said and twined their fingers together as he led them inside.
have in mind?" He took his index finger and slid it down the front of John's torso, stopping at his hipbone.
John smirked a little and hummed against Sherlock's lips. "You're insatiable, Mr. Holmes," he teased.
"Fun?" John said, seething. "I didn't realise when I joined the rugby team that I was joining a gang of bullies. If this is your idea of fun then I don't want a part of it. Or you." He glanced back momentarily at the lithe form of the boy on the ground. Blood was starting to pool from his nose, but he didn't look seriously hurt otherwise. Turning back to Moran, John gave him a dangerous look. "Get out of here before I call the headmaster and get you suspended from the team."
wound..." he groaned again and pulled away, laying his head on the pillow and breathing deeply through his nose.
Sherlock nuzzled into John's neck, "You're not stupid, I am. I should have told you. If I had said something... none of this would have happened." He shut his eyes tighter as tears started running down his face.
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes, "Oh, come on, John... I've read up on this and if we arrange ourselves correctly, it really shouldn't put much strain on either of us. Now take your clothes off and get in bed with me."
Sherlock pouted, "I'm fine... but beginning to wonder if Myc is trying to steal you away." He pulled John so that he was laying in bed with him and kissed him passionately, "he better not be... because you're
"I love you, too, Sherlock," John said softly. He kept a tight hold on Sherlock, returning each kiss with tenderness and love. When Sherlock finally said they should go speak with his father, John was a bit nervous. But he pushed it away. He shouldn't have to hide his love from his father of all people. "Yes, let's go," he said, sitting up, then standing. He put out a hand for Sherlock to help him up.
"John, where are you? You never came home!" His father was shouting so loud that John had to pull his phone away for a moment.
John's father grinned at Sherlock. "Thank you, that sounds wonderful." Just then, Mr. Watson's mobile rang. "Excuse me," he said, answering it. "Hello? Oh, yes, I'm sorry. My son...Well, yes but...He was taken to the hospital!" Not wanting to upset John while he was still in bad shape, he left the room to finish the conversation.
"I'm sorry, I... I'm so sorry," Sherlock sobbed. He felt so filthy, so ashamed of what he'd been forced to do. Now that John knew, he didn't know what to do. It didn't seem like he was leaving, but Sherlock still felt
Sherlock felt John shifting in his arms and he realised he must be having another bad dream. "John? Love, it's me..." He started placing kisses on his face, trying to wake him.
John shrugged. "No, I don't. So I guess you just can't go to school then." He gave Sherlock a cheeky smile and pushed him down towards the bed. "And I can't possibly go to school by myself, so I guess we're both stuck here."
Sherlock grinned, leaning in to whisper huskily in John's ear. "I've never wanted to be so bad before I met you... You and I have so much chemistry I just can't ignore it. By the way, it's not only your mind that I've blown." He nipped the other boy's earlobe and started placing open mouthed kisses all along his jaw and neck, all the while still moving his hips.
Sherlock squirmed and bit his lip, trying his hardest not to make a sound. He didn't want to alert John's father who was just in the other room. He scratched his nails along his lover's scalp and then tugged at his hair, trying to get him to stop teasing or he was going to lose it.
John hummed, all the tension disappearing from his shoulders. "You have magic fingers, my love," he said, glancing back at Sherlock.
John moaned into Sherlock's mouth, barely able to contribute anything to the kiss because his body was so focused on the feeling below his waist. Being wanked off underwater was something totally new, and it felt spectacular.
After dinner was served and everyone ate, Sherlock walked with John to take his father to the door to say goodbye. He wrapped an arm around his boyfriend's waist, settling his hand on his hip. "Come back anytime, Mr. Watson," Sherlock said and smiled at the man.
!" With a loud, almost inhuman sound, John was coming, spilling onto his hand and the black leather of the ottoman.
John couldn't resist that face. He swallowed thickly, his nausea not disappearing as of yet, and took his hand. "Sherlock," he said as a warning. "I'm really rubbish at dancing." They were walking onto the floor and his heart was pounding in trepidation. Already there were other couples, all looking graceful, dancing around them. He was definitely going to be sick.
When Sherlock felt that his lover was stretched enough, he spit into his hand and slicked up his cock. He decided to tease John a little and just rubbed his erection in between the other boy's arse cheeks.
John's face only heated further as he returned the hug, snuggling into Sherlock. He only hoped Sherlock was right. "I love you, too. So much."
John smoothed his hands over Sherlock's back, trying to keep him calm. "It's alright, love. I'm sure if at least one of us testifies that will be more than enough to get him a sentence." He moved closer to kiss Sherlock tenderly. Sherlock had already told him that the memories of Sebastian's earlier bullying had been enough to put him on drugs. John didn't want Sherlock to force himself to think about those times again and possibly have a relapse.
Sherlock smiled and took John's hand, leading him to the bathroom so they could take a shower. They managed to keep their hands to themselves and got out in time to meet Mycroft out front to go to school.
John flushed in embarrassment when Sherlock had begun, but as he continued the redness slowly faded and a smile grew in its place. He kissed Sherlock back, chest swelling in happiness. "I couldn't have said it better myself," he whispered against Sherlock's lips. "I just wish there was a way to express exactly how strongly I feel for you."
John grinned, closing his eyes. "Then I guess I'm doing my job right." He yawned, feeling tired. It had been quite a day, and now all he wanted was to sleep with his wonderful fiance. "I love you, Sherlock Holmes," he murmured against his neck.
John turned to Mrs. Holmes as she hugged him again and truly did feel like one of the family. "Thank you, Mrs. Holmes. I'm very happy to be here." He watched her go and then realised that he was all alone...with Mycroft.
John tilted his head back to look up at Sherlock. "This isn't really dancing. This is moving to the beat of a song." He brought both his hands up to brush briefly through Sherlock's curls. "Anything more formal than this and I wouldn't be so good."
John leaned back against Sherlock. "I love you, too," he said softly before starting the bike. He turned it around and started off for Sherlock's house again. He glanced back at his flat before they turned the corner, just a bit of longing in his eyes, and he sighed, facing forward again. Maybe Sherlock was right. Maybe it would just take time before his father was alright. At least, he hoped.
John pushed in another finger and twisted, tossing his head back with a cry. He was so completely lost in everything, the sound of Sherlock's voice, his subtle touches, the scent of him so near, and the feeling of touching himself like this. He almost felt like it was Sherlock touching him, fingering him, and having a hand in his hair all at once.
John kissed him back, caressing Sherlock's cheek. "Don't thank me, it's my job." He smiled at his fiancé and gave him another chaste kiss.
John grinned and placed more kisses along Sherlock's jawline. He trailed them from one side to the other, turning a little to put his hands on Sherlock's shoulders. He hummed against Sherlock's skin and sucked lightly right at the junction of his jaw and neck.
Once they were back at Sherlock's house, he led John up to his bedroom and sat on the bed. He pulled John in between his legs and grabbed both his hands, twining their fingers together.
John took deep breaths as he tried to set his bike up with shaking hands. As he was suddenly lifted, he squeaked indignantly and scrambled to try and grab some part of Sherlock. "You crazy git! What are you doing?" He finally settled on grasping Sherlock's arse, pouting as he felt like a sack of potatoes.
Sherlock nodded, "In my bedside table," he said quietly and blushed, "Mycroft got them for me as soon as he saw us together. That... was a very interesting conversation," he chuckled and pulled John in for another kiss, "but we won't talk about that."
Sherlock spent the whole day in the clearing, picking flowers and listening to the wind. He tried to not think too much about what John had told his father that morning, but even escaping to his mind palace didn't help now that it was filled with all things John Watson.
John leaned back, waiting for Sherlock to come back. And when he did, he couldn't help his mouth falling open. "Wow...I mean...wow." He walked over to the other boy and circled him, eyes grazing him up and down. "You certainly do know how to dress. And I am fighting the urge to undress you again."
John smirked and kissed along Sherlock's cock from base to tip. When he reached the end, he took it into his mouth, sucking lightly.
"Now, boys... I want you to realise that I will do my best to help you get this monster behind bars, but... You have to be prepared for the alternative. There's no way for me to know all the questions they may ask you and they may not be as nice as I was. Be prepared for anything, that's all I want you to do. If you're prepared and stay strong, then we'll have no problems." She smiled at the boys and reached out to grab their joined hands, "keep each other close, that will be key to your success in this trial as well." She smiled, tears coming to her eyes as she stood and gathered her things.
Sherlock didn't take John's shirt off, he just slid his hands up underneath it and lightly scratched his nails along his lover's stomach. He continued to suck and lick at the other boy's neck as his hands moved lower to work on undoing his trousers.
Sherlock grinned and gently pushed John off of him so he could stand. Then he grabbed the other boy's hand and led him over to his closet. "All this stuff, is just what I normally wear. I think a lot of it is worn out and may not fit you, but... I want to show you something." He smiled over at John before opening a door at the back of the closet.
Sherlock locked lips with John again, kissing him deeply as he moved his hips up until he was able to feel the tip of John's cock pressing against his entrance. He groaned into the kiss as he pushed down, encasing John's entire length inside of him up to the hilt. After a few moments, he started rocking his hips hard and fast, trying to get his lover to the right angle to be pounding into his prostate with every thrust.
John stood when Sherlock did and turned to follow him out. But when Sherlock bent over, he found himself a bit...distracted. No, he knew what Sherlock was doing. He wasn't going to give in. He walked right past Sherlock, resisting an urge to smack his arse, and out the door. "Nice try, love."
John slowly pumped the finger for a few moments before adding a second. He scissored them gently, trying to stretch Sherlock as much as possible before he went in himself. A third finger followed and he thrust them as he ripped open the condom package with his teeth. John rolled the little circle of rubber over his cock with a groan, still stretching Sherlock carefully.
John loved the sound of Sherlock coming apart, and it brought his own orgasm, spilling out all over himself. He cried Sherlock's name out and fell back onto the bed, gasping. "Fuck, that was good..." He laughed goofily and closed his eyes.
The judge looked at the defence lawyer, "do you have any further questions for Mr. Watson?" Mr. Tabling smirked and shook his head. "All right then, we'll take an hour recess and meet back here then."
John whimpered and obeyed, smoothing his thumb over his slit as his hand came up. He let his eyes fall shut, breathing out shakily. "Fuck,
Sherlock covered John's hands with his own and leaned back into him. "I just... I didn't want you to know I woke up screaming." He sighed and tightened his grip on the other boy, closing his eyes.
John groaned and pushed back into Sherlock's hand. He thrust his fingers into his fiancé's mouth, and when they were sufficiently soaked, he pulled them out and scooted off of Sherlock. He leaned back, spreading his legs, and reached down, moaning as he circled his entrance. "Fuck, Sherlock...you have no idea what you do to me..." He pushed a finger inside with a cry. "I-I...oh, God. I can't wait to bounce on your cock." He added a second finger, stretching himself.
John leaned away, though he was careful to make sure he wasn't leaning over the railing. He caught a glimpse of how high up they were and suddenly he didn't feel very safe on the balcony anymore. He'd always had an inexplicable fear of falling... "Y-yes," he stammered out in response to Irene. "Why do you ask?"
Sherlock bit his lip, trying to ride through the initial pain, but then John rolled his hips and thrust into him and the pain gradually started to dull. He looked deep into his boyfriend's eyes as he continued to thrust into him and he moaned softly. He could stay like this forever if their bodies would allow them to, being this way with John was
Sherlock sighed and nuzzled into John's neck, "you do enough by being here... and loving me. It's not your fault I can't forget." He kissed the side of John's face and closed his eyes, trying to get back to sleep.
"Oh God..." Sherlock whispered and looked down at his fiancé settled between his legs. He swallowed and his pupils dilated at the sight. Even though John was still completely clothed, he looked
Sherlock scoffed, "typical doctors. I'm a little thirsty," he said, looking around to see if there was any water nearby. "John? Could you get me a glass of water, please, love?" he said and pointed over to the cup on the food tray next to the pitcher.
Ms. Rodin gave John a look, trying to let him know it was okay, they just needed to know. "All right, so then what happened?"
John was quite enjoying his time with Sherlock. For that while it was just him and his lover and not a care in the world. And what they were doing was enough, of course, but he was sorely tempted when Sherlock claimed to be up for more. He looked at his fiance with a skeptical eye. "Are you absolutely sure? I really don't want to hurt you."
! Fuck, yes!" He started moving faster, coming down as hard as he could. "So...so good...so close..."
After adding a third finger and stretching John some more, Sherlock removed them and spit into his hand to slick up his cock. "Ready?" he asked quietly and positioned himself at his lover's entrance.
John smirked a little. "Looks like I haven't been a very good influence on you." He leaned back, enjoying Sherlock washing him. "Then again, I think it was a mutual exchange."
"Ohhh, yes," Sherlock moaned and pushed down onto his lover's fingers. "I love you... S-so much, John," he whimpered and gripped tightly to the other boy's shoulders.
John kept up with Sherlock, his cock aching painfully between his legs as they went out to the limo. Once they were finally inside he closed the door behind him and pounced on Sherlock, pushing him onto his back on the seat and kissing him firmly. Then he pulled back and looked down at his lover with lust-darkened eyes. "I promised you whatever you want. Any requests?"
John spent the night with Sherlock, sleeping comfortably in the arms of his boyfriend. The next morning when he woke up, Sherlock was still asleep. He smiled and kissed the underside of his jaw, not trying to wake him.
John jumped when Mr. Holmes touched him and he looked up with wide, bloodshot eyes. "No. No, I can't," he said, shaking his head which made him dizzy. "What if he...I can't miss it. I have to be here." His speech was slurred and his eyes were drooping.
Sherlock smiled, "yes, I think so too." He leaned down and kissed John firmly. "Let's go upstairs, shall we?" he said and grabbed John's hand, practically dragging him up the stairs.
Sherlock smirked, "yes, dear." As they drove, he could tell that John was nervous and he tightened his arms around him, trying to show some comfort. He knew that what John's father thought was very important to him and he hoped that he was accepting of his son and of him.
"Mycroft," Sherlock spat. "Sherlock," his brother replied. The elder Holmes looked John up and down for several moments before nodding swiftly and stepping past them into the dining hall.
Sherlock frowned, he had an idea of why John's father didn't mention his second job, and it wasn't anything good. He quickly smiled before John could see the change in his demeanor and changed the topic to school. They continued to talk, Hamish and Siger seeming to get along very well, talking about things they had in common, which suprisingly was quite a bit.
John mouth fell open at the sight of the room. He was sure there were enough clothes there to open a small boutique. Shoes of every style and colour were neatly lined along the floor, a rack of belts took up a small space of wall. There was even what looked like a jewelry stand, though it was filled with watches and cuff links. In the centre was a large, round ottoman-style seat, and in a corner, a stand with full length mirrors surrounding it. He looked back at Sherlock and wound up just shaking his head. "I shouldn't be surprised, I really shouldn't, but...wow."
Meanwhile, he popped the top of the bottle and squirted some of the liquid onto his fingers. He reached under Sherlock to circle his entrance before pushing one finger inside.
Sherlock grinned and stepped away from John, "you mean like this?" He started dancing on his own, swaying his hips seductively. He raised his arms over his head and brought them back down, biting his lip and sliding one of his hands down his torso.
..." Sherlock winked and let his eyes travel down to John's crotch, then looked back up with an eyebrow raised suggestively.
John made a muffled sound as Sherlock suddenly threw himself into the kiss, but he gladly kissed him back. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock's neck, holding him in place and parting his lips to lock with the other boy's. It was different from kissing a girl, more firm and a bit scratchy because Sherlock had some stubble, but really, he couldn't care less. It was wonderful.
, yes... You always feel... So amazing inside of me," Sherlock panted and twisted his wrist on his cock, sliding his thumb over the slit again. "Fuck... I'm s-so close," he moaned and his hips bucked up into his fist.
Sherlock sighed, "her name is Irene Adler. She's the only girl that's ever tried to flirt with me... She's very persistent." He frowned at John's expression and grabbed onto his waist tighter, "you don't have anything to be jealous of."
John shivered a little, pressing back further into Sherlock. "God, Sherlock. You drive me crazy sometimes." He flipped himself over so he was straddling Sherlock's hips. "And I absolutely love it."
Sherlock walked over and wrapped his arms around John's waist, leaning down to kiss him again. "Mmm... I'll just sit with you while you eat, I'm still okay," he said and smiled.
Sherlock groaned and instantly wrapped his arms around his lover. He smiled up at him, "I have no idea, love... Why don't you tell me what
John was about to say no, but then he looked at Sherlock with a smirk. "Yes, Doctor Sherlock, I could use some medicine but I don't want you to leave this bed. Your lips will have to do." He leaned in and pressed his lips to Sherlock's, parting them to lock together.
John's blush only darkened when Sherlock asked him about dating. Oh, if only he knew who he wanted to date now. What would he think? "Well, I haven't really talked with many girls since I moved here," he said. "And dating hasn't been the first thing on my mind lately anyway. I've been trying to get good enough grades to get some kind of scholarship or I don't know how I'm going to go to Uni." That was absolutely true, of course. Much as he was now feeling like he wanted to date Sherlock, before he hadn't been trying to find anyone. It just didn't seem that important at the time.
John blushed a little at the compliment and he kissed Sherlock back. He could feel Sherlock's own erection against his leg, and smirked. "I guess it's your turn now, isn't it?" He gave Sherlock a wicked grin as he moved to flip them over. He started trailing kisses down his body, enjoying the pale smooth skin beneath his lips.
John looked up at Sherlock with a budding smile. "Really? Do you think he would?" That would be amazing. He would have a better chance at getting some scholarships if he had experience to speak of. Then maybe he could forego the army and stay with Sherlock.
, just ring someone? His mum, dad... anyone." She knelt next to John and placed her hand on his shoulder, "come on, John..." she said softly.
Sherlock chuckled softly, "no, we certainly won't." He snuggled in close to John and closed his eyes, letting sleep take him.
Mr. Watson blinked a little before taking a deep breath. He shook his head, looking down at the floor. "If it were anyone else, I would tell you to take off that ring and forbid you from seeing them again." Here he brought his head back up. "But because it's Sherlock...just make sure you wait a few years, boys. You're not even out of secondary school yet."
Sherlock felt his heart sink when John stayed silent for so long. He gasped in surprise when his boyfriend locked lips with him but quickly recovered and kissed him back just as forcefully. He found his next words coming out without a thought. "I promise you, I will never do anything like it again. Being with you is far more powerful than any drug and I couldn't bear to be without you. I was already addicted after our first kiss," he said and smiled through the tears.
Sherlock waved his hand dismissively, "no, just a bunch of talk. I'm fine, really," he reassured John. He smiled and pulled him down to whisper in his ear, "you know, you're really quite attractive when you get protective," he murmured. He pulled back with a grin and winked.
Sherlock placed a hand on the small of his fiancé's back, pushing in back down onto the bed, "shhh, just be patient. It'll be worth it, I promise," he whispered and bent down, kissing the spot right above his lover's arse. He took both hands and spread them over each arse cheek, massaging them deeply.
When they were up in Sherlock's room, John looked up at Sherlock guiltily. "I owe you a few more apologies," he said softly. "I'm sorry for being such an idiot before we met. I don't even know why I said those things, I didn't really mean them. And they almost wound up making us lose the case." He hung his head again. Out of everything he had said, he hated that Sherlock had to hear what a jerk he had been just because he was trying to make friends.
John smiled a little in fascination at Sherlock's first words, but after the pause he paled and his eyes went wide. He swallowed after Sherlock was done, heart threatening to burst from his chest. However, Sherlock didn't seem to be bothered by it; he was just stating facts, and damn he was good at it. John relaxed, only marginally, letting out a nervous chuckle. "No, you don't frighten me," he said quietly. "But you're absolutely right. I've never been attracted to a boy before. You're the first." He blushed furiously, casting his eyes down. "And it looks like I was right too, because that was fantastic. You're brilliant." John looked back up at Sherlock and smiled faintly. He didn't know what was going to happen, and it made him nervous and excited all at once.
"God, yes, Sherlock..." John reached down, leaning back a little to get to the spot Sherlock told him. He moved his finger over the skin, gasping at how sensitive it was there, and had to fight himself not to go back further. "Oh, Sherlock... more, please..."
day, and they have not been very innocent thoughts." He smirked at the other boy before capturing his lips in a passionate kiss. After lingering long enough for them both to be breathless, he pulled back just barely and moved his head so he was speaking directly into John's ear. "Would you like to hear them?"
Sherlock made sure to kiss each and every injury before moving back up to John's lips and kissing him deeply, pouring out his heart and soul into it. As he kissed him, he started to undo John's trousers and slipped his hand into his pants, grabbing hold of his erection and pumping it slowly.
Sherlock groaned at the contact of their bare torsos and pulled John in for another impassioned kiss. He bucked his hips up, desperately needing some sort of friction for his aching arousal.
He went back and changed into a pair of dark skinny jeans, a black, silk button up shirt and a pinstripe blazer. He added a pair of dress boots and walked out of the dressing room. "What do you think? Too much?" he asked, turning and biting his lip nervously.
! Please!" He felt tears welling in his eyes as he watched his fiance stare blankly past them. He could hardly even see him breathing, his blinking becoming slower and slower, and for a moment, John was afraid he...No, no, no, this couldn't be happening. "Sherlock, I'm begging you! Don't do this to me!
Sherlock moaned and captured John's lips in another fierce kiss. They kept snogging until the limo stopped and Sherlock helped his fiancé off his lap. He pulled him out of the vehicle and ran to the front door, dragging the other boy along behind him. They made their way up the stairs, toeing off their shoes and socks. Sherlock almost tripped in his hurry to get to the bathroom.
John frowned, trying to look Sherlock in the face. "Hey, what is it?" He could see that something was bothering him, and he could only guess that it was what he had said. "Oh, Sherlock, come on. I can't help that I'm not completely gay. But just because I may still think girls are attractive doesn't mean that I'm going to go off and shag them."
John let out little cries of pleasure as Sherlock fingered him. He swore, he could get off with those fingers alone, they were so long and talented. "Ah...oh, Sherlock...Dear, God." He scraped his fingers down Sherlock's back again, the only thing that he could do in his current state of complete madness. Sherlock reduced him nearly to a puddle.
John took the bottle, a wry smile on his face. "Interesting. When did you get this?" He opened it to squirt some onto his fingers, tasting it. Strawberry, like his favourite jam.
John sped home, parking his bike outside on the street before climbing up the stairs to his flat. He unlocked the door and stepped inside. "Da! I'm home!" he called. His father was lying on the couch, sleeping. John sighed and draped the blanket over him from the back of the couch before heading to his room. He laid on the bed staring up at the ceiling and holding his phone to his chest. He wondered if he should tell his father that he was falling in love with a boy. Some part of him was afraid. Sometimes his father blamed Harry and her homosexuality for their mother leaving. If John turned out the same...that would probably break him.
Sunday flew by and soon they were at school again. John found himself rather distracted all through his classes as he thought about meeting with Ms. Rodin again that afternoon. He had gotten so defensive when she started asking questions like the other lawyer. If he did that in court, would he look guilty? How would the real lawyer react? He tried to stop himself thinking like that. Sherlock needed him to do this. He had promised to protect him and be brave.
John gave a watery smile and bent to kiss Sherlock once. "I know. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have left with her. It just hadn't occured to me that she was a distraction so they could get to you." He bit his lip against the tears that just wouldn't stop. "I could never run away from you, Sherlock. No matter what happens, I promise I'll always be there for you. But you have to trust me, ok? Even if everyone tells you differently, I will always love you."
John's arms instinctively went tighter around Sherlock, but then he loosened them, hoping he hadn't hurt him. "It was...scary," he admitted. "Seeing you, not moving, blood everywhere..." He buried his face in Sherlock's hair. "I will
much better. He pushed his hips back, bending over and grabbing onto the rail in the shower, his knuckles turning white with how hard he was gripping.
John looked up at Sherlock, face heating as he was so utterly moved by both the music and what Sherlock said. "I wish...I wish that I could do something like that for you. But I don't have any sort of talent like that. My words will have to be enough to express just how much I feel."
Mr. Watson frowned. "It's all going to work out," he said, seeming like he was trying to convince himself more than John. Then he stood and walked off to his room, getting changed for his next job. John just couldn't tell him. His father would be so disappointed. Flopping back on the couch, he closed his eyes, just wishing for tomorrow.
Sherlock smiled reassuringly at John, knowing he concerned he was about what Mycroft thought. He seemed impassive however and didn't make any comments about his boyfriend's living conditions, for which Sherlock was very grateful. He helped John out of the car and up the stairs, keeping a hand at the small of his back as he unlocked the door.
"Shh, shh, I've got you. He's not here and he can't hurt you." John kept a tight hold on Sherlock, rocking him gently and kissing all over his face. "I love you, so much, and I will never let him hurt you again."
John grinned at this new style of dancing and he buried his face in the back of Sherlock's neck, kissing him there as they continued to grind. He wondered distantly what everyone else must be thinking, seeing two boys dance so intimately. After all, just because Sherlock's family accepted it, didn't mean all his guests did. Then again, John couldn't be bothered to care. He was enjoying himself with the boy he loved.
John tried to wrench himself free when he was pinned to the wall, but Sebastian was bigger than him. He glared at him until he turned away, admonishing himself for his pounding heart. He didn't even have time to prepare for the punch and he fell to the ground hard. But John Watson wasn't going to let him get away with that. He stuck his leg out as Sebastian was walking away, tripping him so that he fell directly on his face.
Sherlock whimpered and added another finger, pushing them in as far as he could and curling them against his prostate. "Shit... John," he breathed into the phone. He started thrusting his fingers in and out rapidly and moaned. "Oh... Imagine that I'm riding you, hard and fast."
"He needs to tell the rest of it. The jury will want to hear the whole story," Helen argued and turned to look at Mr. Holmes.
!" Sherlock moaned and gripped onto the other boy's shoulders, moving up and down as fast as he could. "
"Yeah, right," John scoffed. "Do you know how many hours I used to play that game at the arcade? You never stood a chance." He smirked up at his fiance and his gaze turned darker. "And that means tonight, you'll be at my mercy."
John's previous tears returned full force and he turned to Sherlock immediately after he had heard the sentence. Finally, they were safe. He wrapped his arms tightly around his fiance, burying his face into his shoulder. They won. It hadn't gone the way they thought it had, but they won.
John tried hard not to blush, but he did anyway. He leaned closer to Sherlock, settling in against his side. "Well, you're quite attractive all the time," he murmured, smiling up at him wryly.
Sherlock rested his cheek on top of John's head and hummed in content. "I feel the same about you, dear. Not to mention our sex life is
John clung to Sherlock as he calmed, staying inside of him and just breathing in his lover's scent in the post-high bliss. He finally turned his head and caught Sherlock's lips in a kiss. "I love you, too. So, so much."
Sherlock let out another moan as their cocks slid against each other, loving the feeling of it. He gasped when John turned them over and let his eyes flutter closed as his boyfriend slid his fingers all along his body. "John..." he moaned quietly and bit his lip.
John couldn't help but smile in return, the sincerity touching. "It's alright. In a way, it kind of helped us to finally admit that we loved each other." He glanced at Sherlock with a grin. "But if you want, you could try to keep an ear open for anything else, maybe kill the rest of those rumours if anyone still believes them."
"I am. And I'm glad that I can make you happy too." John kissed Sherlock again and again, soft and tender.
Sherlock squeezed John's hand and led him to the dining hall. They were alone this time, his parents usually spent the morning in bed on the weekends. The table was already set with two plates of french toast and he pulled the chair out for John again before sitting down himself.
John smiled, kissing him in return. He tried to ignore the aching between his legs. He'd driven Sherlock pretty hard, so he didn't expect him to reciprocate. Although, he didn't think that he'd be able to make this erection go down... "Hey Sherlock...Want to watch me?" he asked with a smirk.
John kept his hips moving, kissing Sherlock back as he whimpered at the sensation. He reached one hand down and stroked his own cock, using his precum to slick himself up.
Sherlock stuck his tongue out and sat on the stool taking notes the rest of the class. When the last bell rang, he smacked John on the arse as they walked out the door. "You're a bloody tease, you know that?" He murmured in his fiance's ear as they walked to the car.
John pouted a little. "I just don't like the idea of some girl hanging all over you." He looked down at his ring, a reminder that Sherlock wanted him, not some random bird. He smiled faintly. "I know I don't have to worry. But if she's persistent, she may still try something."
"Mmmm," Sherlock hummed thoughtfully and leaned his head back, urging John to continue. Whatever John was thinking, he wasn't ready to share yet and Sherlock would respect his wishes, however much he wished he knew what was going on in that head of his.
Sherlock frowned deeper, not sure if he wanted to hear the rest. But he held onto John and listened as he finished.
It didn't matter that they were both male and it didn't matter if anyone disapproved. This was the sharing of love between two souls who needed each other, making a physical connection that was as close to being one as possible. John bent down to kiss Sherlock again and pushed himself inside.
John gasped and then cried out as Sherlock was suddenly on top of him. "Ohh, fuck. Yes!" He started sucking right on Sherlock's pulse, enjoying the speeding beats that he knew were because of him.
John watched Sherlock go before he went into the classroom, not entirely ready to have to sit through an entire sixty minutes without falling asleep. In fact by the time lunch came, John had spent nearly his entire morning fighting drowsiness. He sat waiting for Sherlock to come into the cafeteria, but had dozed off after a while, not realising that Sherlock was late until a loud noise from one of the other tables jerked him awake.
Sherlock sighed happily and settled himself on top of John. "So..." he said, still stroking the other boy's face, "three days until we meet with the lawyer... Think you're ready?"
Sherlock smiled reassuringly at him, "come on, you'll be fine." When he saw that John wasn't going to give in that easily, he put on his best pout, batting his eyelashes for good measure, "please? For my birthday?"
John whimpered and spread his legs, pushing his hips up higher to get more of that glorious friction. "Yes, Sherlock! Oh, God..." He could feel a coil of heat in his stomach, signaling he was close. He turned his head to kiss wherever he could reach on the side of Sherlock's face as he rocked his hips faster. "Sher..'M close..."
Sherlock smiled and looked his fiancé up and down, "I have to say the feeling is mutual." The tie accented John's eyes perfectly, just like Sherlock knew it would, and it almost made them sparkle. "We'll have plenty of time for that after the party." He held his arm out for John to take and grinned brightly at him.
John kissed Sherlock back firmly, excited to see what he would do in return for all his teasing. He tilted his head automatically, giving Sherlock more skin to kiss.
"Oh, John..." Sherlock moaned and continued to roll his hips. It was so easy to get lost in the sensations of his lover's mouth on his skin, his body beneath him and the various sounds coming from him. He loved to hear each and every breath, each moan and each whimper. It turned him on more than anything ever could.
Sherlock hummed in acknowledgement and turned around, going back to his drink. He couldn't help but feel a pit of hurt in his stomach as he thought over what John had said about still being attracted to girls.
John knew he must be getting Sherlock's sweet spot by his reaction, so he didn't dare stop. He had never felt such a combination of pleasure and passion. Even their first time together was more love with sex. This time it was sex with love, and there was a difference.
He rolled his eyes with a soft chuckle before giving Sherlock another quick kiss. "She was a bloody awful kisser too. Smushed her lips up against me. I'm pretty sure her lipstick rubbed off." Sure enough, when John swiped the back of his hand over his mouth, it came back with a faint red stain.
Sherlock made quick work of John's trousers and pants, yanking them off and tossing them away. He needed more of his lover's skin available to his touch and he wanted so very badly to hear his voice crying out in lust.
John follow Sherlock and Ms. Rodin into the room, keeping a tight hold on the former's hand. It looked like the whole town had come out to see the trial. A lot of the kids from school were there, including the entire expelled rugby team who gave the pair dirty looks. John leaned in close to whisper to Sherlock as they waited for another chair.
Sherlock led John up some stairs and around a corner, looking both ways before taking him outside to a balcony. The view was perfect from here, he'd been on tours here before and knew that this particular balcony had a gorgeous view of London. He took John over to the railing and wrapped his arms around his waist, leaning his head on the shorter boy's shoulder and looking out at the city.
John whimpered into the kiss, his mouth falling completely open to let his lover in. He pushed down Sherlock's pants and trousers, leaving the two of them bare from the waist down. Pulling back from the kiss to breathe, John let his head fall back to the pillow and groaned. "Please, Sherlock...God, I need you."
John couldn't believe it. Finally they were married, finally they were husband and...husband, and it was perfect. Everyone watching was teary-eyed, even Hamish who had his arm around Helen Rodin Watson. When they finally pulled apart, John smirked wickedly and scooped Sherlock up to carry him down the aisle and outside to their waiting limo, cheers and applause following behind.
Sherlock observed how John was acting towards him and since he was not pulling away from his touches but rather pulling him closer, he came to the conclusion that John was feeling close to him as well. The overwhelming desire to just take him in his arms again and kiss him until he was breathless was almost too much to bear. He wouldn't push it though, knowing that John probably had not been in a situation like this with another male before, so he smiled and calmed his thoughts. "We could just sit on my bed and talk if you want," he said, gesturing to the mattress, "I would very much like to know more about you, John."
Sherlock's lips quirked into a smile when John took his hand and he lifted their joined fingers up to his mouth, kissing the back of his fiance's. His mother stood and made a big speech, bursting into tears near the end and causing his father to have to stand and finish it for her.
John readied himself, knowing that with what he was doing Sherlock wouldn't last long. Sure enough, he was soon coming, and John swallowed everything he gave, keeping his lips moving on Sherlock through the orgasm. When he was finished, John licked him clean and pulled his fingers out. "How was that?" he asked, moving up to untie Sherlock's wrists.
