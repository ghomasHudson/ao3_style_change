One thing about John that amazed Sherlock was how kind he was. No one had ever treated Sherlock the way John treated him. Everyone Sherlock had ever known had seen him as a mistake and a failure. John saw Sherlock as exceptional, and Sherlock’s new favorite word - brilliant.
Most interesting to John were the creature’s hands- unlike the hooves on its legs, the creature had the hands of a human, only different in that they too were furred. “What are you?” John wondered as he stared at the creature in awe.
John dislodged the now-splintered and bloodied wood from the first man’s brain tissue and turned in time to see the third man make a run for the stairs. Unsure if there were bullets and confident in his aim, John threw the first man’s gun squarely into the back of the third man’s head, knocking him into a likely concussion with the bannister.
“Hello. Is human greeting.” the fawn explained. Something in his tone was impatient, as if he was bored by the fact he had to clarify such a thing.
“Do you know and you’re just not telling me?” John finally asked on a lazy Tuesday when both men were lounged in the sitting room long past noon, Sherlock in his blue silk dressing gown and John in his simple flannel nightwear.
Sherlock looked a bit more human when he was wet. His fur was flattened down by the water and clung to his slim but muscular build. John was surprised by how Sherlock’s torso looked much like a man’s, albeit a very hairy man’s. However, all one needed to do to remember that this creature was not human was to glance at the furry ears antlers protruding from his head, or the hoofs that were at the bottom of his gangly legs.
With that, Sherlock ran as fast as he could, never wanting to see his brother’s stupidly decorated fur again.
“I would have messed things up. “
John always knew when Sherlock was beginning to wake up. The fawn’s ears would lift up while the rest of his body appeared asleep, following the sounds of John’s movements. Soon the fawn would unceremoniously roll out of his couch-nest, flopping down on the floor.
“What is?” Sherlock asked, pointing at the bandage.
John let out a yelp at the strange feeling – initially it was painful, a sharp stab. But very quickly the pain faded into an odd tingling sensation. John felt as Sherlock took his first suck, and it was as if his own vein extended into Sherlock’s being. John looked down to where Sherlock’s fangs were deeply buried in his skin. John knew it should feel more painful than it did, but all he could sense was the intense connection.
“You can stay here… if you like.” The words fell out of John’s mouth before he could think about what they meant. Once he had said them, however, John couldn’t seem to object with them despite the logical qualms that popped in the doctor’s mind.
“I really don’t know. I should be able to figure it out. I am a doctor.” John considered the bumps on his hand as he spoke. “It’s just so odd. This pair… it’s directly over the cephalic vein. It’s like whatever bit me knew exactly what it was aiming for.”
“We need to get you help.” John took Sherlock’s hand in both of his, gently but desperately trying to rub them to a stable temperature. The skin was not only cold, but incomprehensibly hard and fragile at the same time.  “You feel… Christ, you feel like a corpse.”
“No.” John cupped Sherlock’s face in both of his hands. “It was a bit not good, but I understand.” John pressed a breath of a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead. “I understand now, why you did what you did. And I want to understand everything.” Another kiss, this time to the very corner of Sherlock’s mouth. “I love you, Sherlock.”
“So it’s been you all along, then.” John deduced gently, careful to keep his tone kind, lest it seem like an accusation. “You did it… while I slept?”
“Sherlock?” John called out as he set down the grocery bags. There was no reply. John slowly made his way towards his bedroom, keeping out a keen eye for the missing fawn. It wasn’t until John reached the end of the hallway that he heard Sherlock’s whimpers coming from behind the bedroom door.
“We get ourselves cleaned and patched up, put something in our bellies.” John continued. “And if you don’t mind... I think I’d like to fall asleep with you in my arms.” It was John’s turn to look sheepish. “I don’t want to be alone tonight. I want to be with you, know you’re safe.”
John toed off his socks and shoes and stuck his feet in, secretly hoping the water was freezing. Much to his internal dismay, the water was absolutely perfect in temperature and John couldn’t help but want to slide into the beautiful lake.
“Why?” The army doctor cocked his head to the side, soldier’s eyes searching Sherlock up and down once again for whatever it was that he had missed.
After a long moment of contemplation, he came to the decision that what he had found must be a house. Sherlock had heard humans mention houses before. Houses were where they lived. The people Sherlock saw in the forest would speak of being far away from their houses, or having forgotten something from their house. Despite having heard of them, this was the first time Sherlock had ever actually seen a house. Sherlock padded closer to the building, cautiously examining it.
John simply let Sherlock rest awhile, watching the rise and fall of his breaths. Being so close only desperately reminded John how much he loved the impossible man. A rare moment like this was dangerous - it made John wonder if there was a possibility for more. Sherlock was so emotionally skittish, hiding behind a protective wall of his own design. And yet, here he was, dozing in John’s lap.
There was a spring to John’s stride as he went to the kitchen to get his tea. He felt light, as if nothing could weigh him down. John put the kettle on, pausing by the open kitchen window to savor the feeling of the night air on his skin – a feeling he had long forgotten.
“Absolutely brilliant.” John grinned.
“I doubt anyone would believe me if I did.”
“Obvious.” Sherlock’s tone was a verbal eye-roll.
“Well…” John replied. “I can swim. It’s just….” Embarrassment and self-hate filled John’s eyes. “My scar… is horrible. It is ugly and grotesque. If you saw it, you’d be scared away.”
Sherlock sat up a bit with interest. “Clock? Is for tell time?”
“Was that you playing the violin?” John asked as he sat down. A quick worried, vulnerable look flashed over Sherlock’s face before he coldly replied, “Obviously it was me. I am the only person on this block who owns a violin, not to mention is capable of playing one.” This very Sherlock response didn’t phase John for a moment. “What was that you were playing Sherlock?”
“Stay behind me.” Sherlock commanded John in a soft rumble, sidestepping them both into the cloak of the room’s shadows. Four men began to descend the stairs, each shining a torch into the surrounding darkness.
At first John thought he was still dreaming. But the night air was too real for that. Never in a dream had he felt the ground under his feet so solid, the light breeze so unmistakable through his hair.
Sherlock gets up to some magical mischief in the night.
“Yes. And I bought soap.”
“It means exceptionally smart.” John explained. Sherlock looked extremely surprised to have something so complimentary said about him. “Brilliant.” he said to himself in awe.
John winced at the men’s cruel words and felt a twinge in his heart at the thought that this type of treatment was likely not uncommon for Sherlock. Anger roiling in his gut, the short man took a pointed step forward, only to be stopped by his companion’s arm. “Stay. Behind. Me.” Sherlock growled under his breath, no question in the strength with which he held the soldier back.
“Right you are… It’s a clock, just like in the kitchen.” John reached for the alarm clock to show Sherlock. The fawn backed away.
“John is special.” The unexpected words from the normally aloof fawn somehow stopped and melted John’s heart all in the same instant. “Sherlock is trust John not to tell secret.”
“Is shine.” Sherlock said with wonder. He gave the coin an experimental lick. “Is not taste good.”
“All I know,” John grumbled, trying his best not to itch at the newly replaced wrapping. “Is that whatever is causing these is some freak of a parasite.”
“Hey. Come here, you silly fawn. Everything is okay.” John scooped up the blanket-entrapped fawn and pulled away the covers so he could see his face. Sherlock opened his big blue and gold speckled eyes and looked up at John. “It was attack.” Sherlock whimpered, tears rolling down his face. “Was hurt ears.”
The fawn opened his eyes. For a pregnant moment he just gazed at John, blinking owlishly. He absent-mindedly removed his hand from the garden and brushed the soil off of his fur.
“Sherlock Holmes, you impossible git…” John chuckled solemnly with a shake of his head, thoughts flashing with images of cases, and cab rides, and domestic mornings and evenings of comfortable companionship in the flat. “Do you really think I could ever be afraid of you?”
John nodded, taking a careful first sip of his tea. He gave Sherlock’s mug a tap. “Give it a try.” The fawn leaned in and lapped at his tea, like a deer would drink from a stream.
John Watson was a man of action, determined that it would take much more than a musty broom closet to contain him. He rummaged in the darkness, knocking aside mop buckets and bottles of cleaning spray. John managed to find a broom with a decently sturdy handle – not ideal in any sense, but it would have to do. The soldier took in a deep breath of air and swung the broom handle-first into the door. Again and again, John used every iota of his strength in a brutal assault. A quarter of an hour later, the broom handle was destroyed to a point beyond use, but the door had been splintered in more than once place. John tossed aside the ruined broom and employed his own body weight. A few solid slams with his good shoulder and John was able to burst through, landing in a pile of tattered wood on the opposite side of the doorframe.
Sherlock allowed himself to melt into John’s hold, tensions absolved by the steady rhythm of snuffled exhales from the sleeping man’s lips.
“Very right you are, my brilliant fawn. You learn so well.” John praised. Sherlock had taken a great interest in John’s grandmother’s old clock and had insisted that John teach him to read the time. “Only thing you’ve got wrong is how to say it. It’s six o’clock. Not ‘six on clock’.”
Sherlock skipped happily down the hill with his pouch of magic plants in hand, imagining how surprised and pleased John would be when his garden was fixed.
“The reason I wear my ‘stupid’ gardening hat is because I like it.” John had explained, a bit annoyed at having his fashion choices criticized. “There doesn’t have to be a point to everything you know.”
“This had better be of the utmost importance, Antlerson.” Moosecroft insisted in a haughty drawl. “There are many preparations for me to see to, you know.”
“Time for you to get a meal and some sleep, I’d wager.” John hadn’t quite realized how tired he was himself until he heard it in the gruffness of his own response.
“Yes. We solve crimes together. Well- he solves them and I write about them in my blog.”
. It was beautiful, somehow haunting and comforting at the same time, undoubtedly profound.
Sherlock settled in the top of the tree, surveying the forest and the night sky with fond appreciation. He could see everything from there, including the night sky. It was beautiful. Sherlock rubbed his feet, which were sore from running. He needed to think about what had just happened, and what he would do next.
A few minutes later Sherlock parted some bushes. “Is time for crawl through bush.” John nodded and got on his knees, following after the fawn. They crawled through a large patch of shrubs that seemed to go on for quite some time.
. Somehow the moon seemed to shine brighter, the plants and trees seemed to echo life. Everything was palpable in the air, and yet just beyond John’s grasp.
The flat was always cluttered when they returned from a case. Chairs and tables lay strewn with notably more than the usual detritus - pens and papers, books and files, clues on every surface connected by trails of red string, back and forth and back and forth again throughout the space like a laserized spy movie obstacle. Various teacups, most filled to the brim with untouched tea, sat abandoned in whatever free space there had been for them to be set, sometimes even on the floor. Then there were the experiments - trails of gunpowder, or blood samples on clothespins, or maybe some dubiously legal menagerie of toxic plants. Whatever was needed for the answers unknown, left behind at the drop of a hat the moment insight was gained or proved irrelevant, the hazardous droppings of a brilliant mind. Sometimes there was medical debris - bandage wrappings and used cotton swabs colored with blood and disinfectant, all thrown aside after a hasty patch-up and regroup. The rooms of 221b Baker Street were never neat, but in the aftermath of a case, they were a war zone.
, until both strings lay open and the fabric could be stretched just so. He would pull Sherlock out, exposing him above his waistband, cradling the detective’s most delicate parts with the most delicate care.
John was extremely curious about the strange furred creature in his sitting room. “Do umm… do all the fawns speak like humans do?” he asked.
“What is store?” Sherlock’s ears had perked up at the mention of an unfamiliar word, the new normalcy of Sherlock’s inquisitiveness bringing a smile to John’s face, as well as a calm to his heart.
“John. John.” The fawn repeated John’s name a few times, quickly getting the hang of saying the syllable. “Hello John.” he proudly announced. “Is nice to meet.” Sherlock tried to stick his arm out for a handshake but immediately gave a small cry of pain. John immediately approached Sherlock, reaching for the injured arm. Sherlock backed away, holding his arm protectively.
“I bought pasta…”
Sherlock grabbed one of the larger leaves from a nearby plant, folding it so that it would function as a sort of pouch to carry his treasures. With rampant enthusiasm, he began to dart from plant to plant, gathering what he needed.
John brought the fingers of his right hand to Sherlock’s cheek and wiped the escaping wetness from a sharp, cold cheekbone. “I know.”
“You can sleep out here on the sofa.” John replied. “I have some extra blankets in the closet that you can use.”
“Your brother too, then.” John broke the air, his voice gruff in his throat. “Explains a lot.”
“I imagine it is, for you. Seeing as you never go out. Or do anything.”
John knelt beside the man, taking care to keep the wooden stake far from his reach. “You’re wrong about him.” John explained, like a parent to a child who has made a dangerous mistake. “I’m his friend.”
John gave a return nod of understanding. “Thank you for telling me.”
As John’s eyes adjusted to the sudden decrease in light, Sherlock’s body collapsed to the floor and gave what could only be described as a violent shudder of relief. John was immediately at his friend’s side, checking him over with gentle hands. “Tell me where you are hurting. What did they do to you?” Feeling no broken bones in his initial examination, John gently helped Sherlock roll onto his back. A simple touch to the pale man’s forehead yielded a gasp from the doctor’s lips. “Christ Sherlock, you’re cold.” John hastily removed his own jumper and draped it over as much of Sherlock as he could cover. As he began to stand, mind set on finding a way to escape and get Sherlock the medical attention he clearly needed, the doctor was stopped by the weak grip of a hand, the skin of which felt utterly devoid of life. “John…”
“You feel no fear, being close to me in this way?” Even after everything they’d been through, Sherlock harbored disbeliefs.
“Yes you are.” John countered with a smile. “You are a brilliant, but very silly fawn.” Sherlock perked up a bit at being called his favorite word. John had quickly learned that calling him “brilliant” was the best way to lift the fawn’s spirits when he got pouty.
Sherlock had given up his argument, but always referred to the hat as the ‘stupid garden hat’. Despite Sherlock’s taunting, John couldn’t help but notice how fondly Sherlock stared at him every time he wore it.
“Not gay?” Sherlock questioned.
“Put your teabag in the hot water.” John instructed. “Like this.” Pointedly, John submerged his Twinings and gave the mug a stir. Sherlock copied exactly.
?” John broke into giggles, loudly enough that the other compartments of the train car were sure to hear. Sherlock shot up ramrod straight, poised in his seat across from John like a startled ferret.
Once breakfast was done and Sherlock had begrudgingly helped clean off the dishes, Sherlock and John engaged in the morning ritual of watering the plants. John enjoyed caring for his small garden. He had carrots, tomatoes, pumpkins, and a few assorted herbs. Sherlock had quietly watched John garden each morning, never asking questions. It was the only time the fawn was ever quiet.
Sherlock’s eyes immediately lit up with concern and anger. “John was hurt? Who hurt? When?” the fawn demanded.
Today when John went out to the garden, wearing the ‘stupid garden hat’, he was dismayed to find that his plants had been completely and utterly trampled in the night. “They’re ruined! They’re bloody ruined!” he lamented, examining the desolation of his garden.
“Is perfect now.” he proclaimed, happily munching a large bite of foliage-covered eggs. John smiled and shook his head, continuing to eat his breakfast. The fawn never ceased to amaze him.
“A blanket is like a large, comfy towel that keeps you warm.” John explained.
Sherlock took it, and for some time the two stood, palms together and fingers twined.
“You.” Sherlock admitted, as if his desire were a sacrament. “I want you in my life. But it’s not just that. I want you in... in my...”
“What mean bri-lli-ant?” Sherlock asked, ears twitching with interest.
“Oh but you are.” Sherlock countered coolly. “You just haven’t realized it yet. Now, tell me the name of the man who hired you so I can find out the name of the man who hired him.”
John allowed his body to lay back onto the cold stone of the ground, his heart working overtime to recalibrate his system after a loss of blood just this side of dangerous. After a moment, Sherlock awkwardly shuffled and lay himself beside John. For some time, the two stared up at the cracks in the structurally unsound ceiling above them.
“The store is where people go to buy things. They have food, and soap, and other useful things like that. And if you have money you can buy them.”

“Stay close to me.” Sherlock commanded in a whispered bark.
Sherlock gave a petulant full-bodied huff that propelled him the rest of the way over the side of the chair, landing him on the ground in a pathetic, yet somehow graceful heap. John chuckled and decided to let the pile of angry detective stew. Hopefully the flat would still be standing by the end of the afternoon.
Sherlock’s nod seemed all the more pronounced, given his antlers. “Is powers from the spirits of forest. Fawns take an oath. Humans are not supposed to know.”
It was Sherlock’s turn to extend his hand, quelling the veiled misgivings in John’s eyes.
“You are not always bored.” John insisted as he placed two plates of eggs and toast on the kitchen table. “You’ve seemed quite entertained since you’ve come here.”
But the moment was abruptly halted by the sound of footsteps from somewhere above them in the crumbling building. John’s face immediately set into soldier mode, but his eyes continued to shine with softness and love.
Backed away in the far corner of the room was Sherlock. The fawn was hiding under a blanket, only the ends of his antlers and his small white tail sticking out from the safety it provided. Sherlock peeked out his head when he heard John burst into the room. His hands were covering his ears as if bombs were exploding around him.
John’s heart was racing, and he could feel everything he had ever wanted to say bubbling on the tip of his tongue. “Do you know…?” John started, stopping to steel his raging anxieties and inhale a deep breath. “Do you know that I love you?”
Sherlock jumped up on to the table of cakes, kicking them about. “That is the alternative, is it not? Banishment. The worst of sentences that can be placed upon one of our kind!” Sherlock spoke with manic distain unfitting to the punishment of which he spoke. The audience looked on with gaping stares of astonishment. “I’ll take that, unless the fawn council prefers to leave me be and pretend this meeting never happened.”
That was an hour ago, and he was only now unlocking the front door of 221B Baker Street - cold, hungry, and alone on a holiday that is meant to be filled with warmth, food, and togetherness.
Sherlock’s face broke into an astronomical smile, and John was beyond certain the fawn was, in fact, blushing.
Opening up the cupboards and fridge, John realized that he desperately needed to pick up a few things from the store. They were out of pasta and bread, cheese, milk, and most importantly Cheerios, the lack of which Sherlock would be dismayed to discover upon waking. John decided to leave Sherlock a note and head out to town to grab the things they needed.
“What now?” Sherlock questioned, sounding more puzzled than John could ever have imagined him to be.
“Now you let it steep.” The fawn nodded and watched his mug as if it were about to reveal the cure to cancer, should one look closely enough.
It was John’s name that would fall from Sherlock’s lips, as John took him in his mouth, as John made him feel beloved. John would lick, from the base to the tip, circling around just to Sherlock’s preference. John would kiss, and suckle, and work his way down until he couldn’t go down farther, and then he would press a bit farther still. Because every moan, every cry, every last sound he could wring from this brilliant man was worth the effort, precious honey sweet baritone vibrating from the depths of that glorious neck, extended long with Sherlock’s head thrown back… and they would build to it together, two as one, until they both found his release.
Gradually the huffs and chuckles died out, leaving a comfortable silence in place of the impassable tension from only minutes before.
Rubbing at the evening scruff on his chin, John took a brief walk-about of the cabin. All was quiet and reasonably in its proper place, with the exception of the dish drainer which was lying on its side in a pool of water in the sink.
Once the soup was finished it was time for the cookie. John would always ask the question and Sherlock would crack open one eye with the smallest crook of a smile as he deduced some cookie cutter promise of the future that held nothing to the moment they were living in the now. The cookie Sherlock would bring to his own lips, needing no assistance when it came to sweets. John would always listen for the crunch and wonder how the man could be so fascinating even when doing something as simple as chewing. Every little thing about him was enthralling, and God, John could never be bored with this.
“I’m okay.” John turned Sherlock’s gaze away from the marks to meet his. “We’re both okay.”
“What is name for you?” Sherlock inquired, motioning towards John.
Sherlock had not told John how strongly enchanted this area of the forest was. When Sherlock had discovered it on one of his explorations outside of the fawn territory he had been astounded by the fact that none of the other fawns knew of a place where magic thrived so potently. Nearly all the plants had some magical use. Sherlock had spent much time experimenting here, discovering the many uses of the berries and leaves. Even the roots of some of the plants and the dirt they grew in had magical properties.
Suddenly thrown from the horrors of war into the dull slog that was everyday civilian life, John found himself longing to disappear. So that was exactly what he did. He disappeared to the cabin he had inherited, determined to fix it up and stay as far away from the world as was manageable. After all, the world had no need for a broken, scarred ex-army doctor. A lonesome cabin was the best place for him. Of this, John was certain.
A few flicks of the lighter was enough to spark a flame, and soon the wooden stake was well on its way to becoming a pile of ash. John noticed that Sherlock kept his distance as it burned, though it could have easily been due to the fact that the stake was bloodied enough to elicit the distinct smell of burning flesh. John tossed the burning wood to the heap of bodies on the floor, reasoning to himself that they might as well burn it all. There would be no benefit to the Met directing manpower towards the comprehension of the inhuman claw marks in the elder man’s chest.
John Watson was alone in his cabin. He had been alone in his cabin yesterday. He was alone in his cabin today. He would most likely be alone in his cabin tomorrow. Such was John’s existence since the war; useless, isolated, and consequently alone.
“You should be dead already, you don’t have a fucking pulse!” John’s entire frame began to shudder, tears escaping his eyes. “I need to save you, but none of this makes any fucking sense!”
Sherlock snorted in amusement when he saw the table, laid out with seed cakes for after the meeting. He could just see his brother’s face covered with the sweet berry topping and he gobbled them down.
“Sherlock. Your name is Sherlock.” John repeated, his expression one of disbelief at the whole situation.
John immediately surrounded Sherlock in a snug embrace, unable to restrain himself in a wave of emotion. Without hesitation, John brought their lips together in a kiss that was equal parts soft love and pointed intensity.
“John…” Even Sherlock’s voice was weak, an exhausted ghost of its usual whip-crack baritone. “What time is it?”
Sherlock sighed as he stared out over the forest from the safety of the tree. The reality was that a fawn surviving completely alone in the forest was unrealistic. Even though Sherlock loathed the other fawns, they provided the body heat necessary to keep him from freezing in the harsh winter months. Once the days grew cold Sherlock would be at great risk.
“Head Councilfawn!” At the call Moosecroft drew away from overseeing the placement of the seedcakes.
“What were you thinking about when you wrote that?” John regretted the question the second he said it, because it was so deeply personal. Sherlock looked down at his violin and replied, just a whisper.
John flicked on the sitting room light and peered out the window. He couldn’t see anyone outside… perhaps some campers had thought ringing the doorbell this late would be a laugh and had run off. Just then, John heard what he thought was a whimper of pain. He responded immediately, stepping to the door and peering out.
“No… I mean, not really.” John shrugged his answer cordially. “They itch a bit. Just a mild discomfort.”
“Tea, of course.” John began to pad his way to the kitchen, scratching at the late-day stubble on his chin.
An idea popped into Sherlock’s head. His ears perked up with excitement, and he quickly made his way back into the house. John was sitting in his armchair reading the morning paper, his face set in a frown.
“The Sherringford tree… It’s glowing.”
John used to love being shirtless. He had enjoyed the feeling of the air on his skin, and had liked the casualness of simply existing without any thought to his choice of clothes. But alas, gone were the days of casual bare-chested evenings about the house, cruelly replaced with the obsessive layering of shirts and jumpers; a wearable security blanket that protected from the unsightliness beneath.
This is the reason why Sherlock, after many minutes of searching, was drawn to a particularly gorgeous bramble among the foliage. This bramble had all the tangled prickles common of the weed, but it was somehow especially lovely in a way that Sherlock couldn’t explain. Sherlock gently picked the plant from the ground, tearing it from its roots. As soon as it was pulled away from the soil the plant transformed from its bramble form into the cumberbranch -beautiful with long, elegant leaves.
“I’m a parasite.”
“You need more than my help, Sherlock. I can’t feel your pulse.” Truly, John had never felt more useless in his life. The doctor’s mind was racing, taking in every detail of Sherlock’s present condition as Sherlock would the details of a crime scene – and none of it made sense, John was at a loss. “What did they do to you, Sherlock? Did they drug you?” John’s fingers prodded at Sherlock’s wrist and neck, desperate to find a sign of life.
“Did I tell you how brilliant you were tonight?” John would ask with a smile, to which Sherlock would nod, blush blooming on his cheeks. “Have I told you how much I love you?” John always questioned next, earning another nod and drawing color to posh cheekbones . And then John would undo the drawstring of Sherlock’s bottoms,
“It’s a signal charm. I placed it long ago.” Moosecroft inhaled deeply before continuing. “And it means that somewhere a human has witnessed an act of fawn magic.”
John Watson was not as slow as people thought him to be. It took less than an instant for all the pieces to fall in place, for him to wholly see and understand Sherlock’s improbable reality. It made John’s heart ache for Sherlock just as much as it terrified every rational cell in John’s body. But John Watson was never a man to back down in fear, even when faced with the impossible – and truly, none of this should be possible. John resolved to set aside the impending and quite frankly unsettling realignment of his worldview for another time and place.  All that mattered was Sherlock.
Sherlock was a magnificent creature to look at any time of the day. However, John had to admit to himself that Sherlock somehow looked especially majestic when he was sleeping. His long body was completely relaxed, his belly rising up with every breath in, and the little patch of fur on top of his nose fluttering about with each exhale. The fawn’s tail would occasionally twitch. It was the only part of Sherlock’s body that seemed restless. All in all, a sleeping Sherlock was simultaneously adorable and beautiful to observe.
, it was anything but boring.
The fawn’s nose twitched. “What is jok-ing?”
“Never fear.” John pressed his lips into black curls in solid reassurance. “Only love.”
“Tell me who you work for.” It was a low demand from the shadows, and all four men focused their lights from whence it came. Sherlock allowed the weak lights to find him and stepped out towards the thugs. “Tell me his name and I’ll let you live.”
Reaching out a steady hand to the back of Sherlock’s head, John spread his fingers with reverence and resolve into the soft disarray of dark curls. Slowly, and ever so gently, John coaxed Sherlock’s head forward, closing the gap between them until the tips of Sherlock’s fangs made contact with the heat of John’s skin.
Sherlock started down at the palm of his hand with a distant gaze. “I don’t want to be a monster.” The faint confession sounded like the words of a child.
“No. It doesn’t effect the plants at all.” John had replied as he pulled weeds.
you are.”
“Are they?” John did his best to swallow the feeling of inadequacy at being so incredibly out of depth in this scenario.
“It has been decreed that Sherlock Holmes will be married to Moosey Hooper tomorrow at sundown. He will be expected to sire children before the summer changes to fall.”
“John?” Physically shaking with effort, Sherlock stretched out his arm and felt blindly for his friend. “J-John… the light….” The detective’s voice was all but an agonized croak. “Turn off the light…”
“Where do you stay now that the other fawns have banished you?”
“Sherlock is not like clock of alarm.” The fawn proclaimed. “Is for banish to closet.” John couldn’t help but chuckle at this, standing up and placing the offending timepiece on the closet shelf where it would begin to live out its indefinite exile.
Sherlock brought his lips so that they hovered just above John’s radial artery. “Please… don’t be afraid.” Sherlock calmed, tears threatening to leak from his eyes. “I won’t hurt you. I promise, I never would want to hurt you, John.”
? Sherlock Holmes was confident and all-encompassing, but in this moment he was always soft and small, fragile and unable to believe himself deserving, and that was what John was made for. John was made to love Sherlock, to love him and care for him until he believed himself to be lovable, and then to love him even more. Sherlock Holmes couldn’t care for himself. Sherlock Holmes didn’t love himself. But gods in heaven, John Watson could, and did, and does, and would forever.
John was the first to narrow the space between them, shuffling forward with an extended hand. Sherlock considered for a moment, a swarm of details passing his mind.
“Sherlock?” Releasing his grip from the fence, John took a few cautious steps forward and knelt beside his increasingly improbable friend. “What… what is this?”
John turned the clock around so Sherlock could see the back. “This knob sets the time for the alarm to go off, and this switch enables the alarm. If you pull the switch the alarm will go off at the time you set. I use it to wake me up in the morning. But I don’t have to use it if it will hurt your ears… I can put it in the closet if that will make you feel better.”
John returned with his medical kit from the army, still stocked with necessities for dealing with various types of wounds. John carefully set out his materials on the coffee table as the fawn watched with great interest.
There was no time for a plan, so John took action. He threw himself to the floor in an over-exaggerated stumble and began to pathetically claw himself towards the other men.
There was the usual transition from drugged unconsciousness to a state of functional awareness. John reoriented himself to his own limbs, blinking his eyes into seeing as he licked the cotton ball feeling from his mouth and lips. The more present John became, the more aware he grew of the pained sounds emanating from somewhere beyond the wooden door. A deep voice groaned and whimpered in exhausted tones of agony. Sherlock.
For the first time in his entire life, Sherlock Holmes was truly speechless, the overwhelming emotions swirling through his mind visible only in the depth of his eyes and the subtle wobble of his bottom lip.
“Is evil clock!” Sherlock turned his head away and shielded his ears with his hands.
John enjoyed the rest of his cuppa at the dining room table, watching as the pretentious fawn on his sofa slowly succumbed to the charms of his own warm cup of idiocy.
“I’m sorry.” Sherlock turned away. “I tried not to… please believe me, I did. I held myself back for so long, and then I told myself it would only be once, just for a taste… but then I’d had you, and I couldn’t stop.” Sherlock’s fingers fell into picking at a stray thread along the edge of his coat. “It was wrong of me, I couldn’t control myself.”
“Fawn magic.” The words were almost inaudible as they fell from Sherlock’s lips. John’s eyes fell on Sherlock once again, considering him for a silent moment.
“And me?”
It was a marvel to John that the men continued to stand their ground in the face of Sherlock’s horrifying bearing and icy tone. The elder man reached within his jacket and produced a piece of wood, the end of which had been whittled into a jagged point. “You know what this is, don’t you, foul beast?”
John relaxed back into the couch with a contented sigh. He felt comfortable, he realized. He felt comfortable within himself. He felt confident even, good looking. He was happy to be in his own skin. It had been so long since John had felt this way.
And what would he do if he was asked to go swimming? Everyone at the pool would stare at him. Even worse, what would he do if he met some lovely girl who wanted to have sex with him? She’d probably lose all interest at the sight of him. She’d be repulsed.
“John and Sherlock need to go to forest to see. Will John come?” John wasn’t quite sure if he wanted to trek all the way into the forest. He had walked a few of the hiker’s paths and was unimpressed with the large collection of seemingly identical trees. But when he looked in the fawn’s eyes and saw their glowing excitement, John couldn’t bring himself to say no.
John was used to what he had internally coined as Sherlock’s “daytime pouts.” They tended to hit about one in the afternoon, and varied in both intensity and choice of complaint. At its most destructive, the daytime pout had the potential to cumulate with a violent outburst, usually taken out on an unoffending household object. Ever since the incident with the letter opener and the Union Jack pillow, John was determined to invent strategies for keeping the daytime pouts at bay. Namely, he was determined to encourage Sherlock to leave the damn flat for once.
John sighed and gave up his inquiry. Perhaps he would try asking again later, when his flatmate was less intellectually absorbed.
John let his eyes roam over the exhausted detective beside him. Long limbs were flopped to the side, the hold of the seatbelt and the support of the cab door seemingly the only things keeping the detective from sliding to the floor. John knew that Sherlock hadn’t eaten or slept in days – it was amazing that the man’s body could survive being pushed to such unreasonable limits.
“Those are eggs and toast. You eat the eggs with a fork and the toast with your hands. Go ahead, try it.” John took a large bite of the eggs, as if to demonstrate that it was edible. Sherlock carefully put some eggs on his fork, (his table manners had greatly improved in the past few days). Sherlock tried the bite, contemplating the taste as he slowly chewed. Once he had swallowed, the fawn jumped out of his chair, darting outside. A moment later he returned with some grass and a few leaves, which he sprinkled on top of the eggs.
“Does scar mean John is not able swim?” Sherlock asked, his ears drooping with sadness.
(See the end of the chapter for
John’s face paled. “They could be careless…” He offered weakly.
When Sherlock felt he’d gone far enough he stopped, catching his breath under a particularly large tree. Once he was breathing normally again, and the ache in his legs from all the sprinting had faded away, Sherlock decided to climb up in the tree to further protect himself from being found.
“I need you to know that you’re the only one. These feelings… I didn’t know what to do.” Sherlock was trembling now, and John reached out a gentle hand to still him. “I thought you’d be frightened of me.”
“What is tea?”
John had inherited the old cabin from a grandmother he never really knew. The long abandoned shack was barely standing, a failing structure of rotted wood adrift in an endless sea of trees. No one would be crazy enough to buy it. After all, who would want to live in the middle of the forest in this day and age? No community, no bustle and excitement. John was certain that nothing could leave him wanting such a life. But that certainty, along with every other certainty John Watson had ever known, was shattered beyond recognition in less than a second by a single bullet.
“You’re too kind to me.”
“John was not supposed to see.” The fawn explained in a small voice. Sensing a bare undertone of fear in the words, John turned his full attention to Sherlock.
John smiled at the fawn. “Yes. You are extremely brilliant to have taught yourself a language, and an inter-species language at that.” Sherlock smiled for the first time since John had met him. John found he rather liked the fawn’s smile. Something made him think that smiles like these were a rare occurrence for Sherlock. John found himself feeling a bit of pride knowing that he had caused it.
“I know.” John brought the palm of Sherlock’s right hand to his lips and pressed a tender kiss to the newly cleaned skin. “We did what we had to do.”
“I can’t go out. Sunlight depresses me.” Sherlock was sliding backwards towards the floor at an almost imperceptibly slow rate of speed, like he was the human incarnation of the world’s only consulting slug.
Sherlock’s curiosity overtook him and he climbed down from the tree, interested to see what was causing the strange light in the distance.
“No fair!” John called out, smile betraying his attempted crossness. “You can’t just push me in the lake!”
John was too lost in his maybe-a-little-bit-gay Sherlockian conundrums to take note of the new set of bite marks on his right calf.
Sherlock backed away further, bumping into Antlerson. “You’re lucky a nice fawn like Moosey Hooper is willing to mate with you. I didn’t think they’d find anyone willing to carry the children of a freak,” he jeered with a sickening expression of disgust.
John was extremely frustrated. He had worked so hard on his garden, just to have a few raccoons destroy it. “There’s nothing I can do to fix it now. All the plants are ruined.” John said with dismay. He took off his hat and trudged into the house.
“I know everything, John. Do keep up.” Sherlock was twirling an authentic Victorian bloodletting fleam in his spidery fingers as if it were a perfectly normal thing to be holding on a Tuesday afternoon. “What specifically are you referring to?”
“Wonderful deduction, brother mine. Yes, I am.” Sherlock spat out, anger burning in his glare. “I will not be forced to mate with anyone. I’d rather live alone outside the fawn territory than comply with the orders of such useless idiots.”
Just as the hint of wooziness dawned on John’s consciousness, Sherlock took a pointed final draw of blood and gently removed his fangs from John’s arm. Somehow it hurt more to have them taken out than it had when they had first pierced the skin, and John gave a shudder at the momentary pain. Sherlock laved his tongue over the puncture wounds and the skin miraculously healed over, leaving behind a familiar pair of raised bumps.
“Now you’re being silly for once.” John chuckled in reply. “Everyone knows that vampires aren’t real. That’s just a story our mums told us to keep us in at night.”
It would be a trick to rummage through the cupboards and drawers without awakening John from his nap – John, who already slept lightly after years of being awakened by gunfire and immediate crises in the Afghan desert. Were anyone to be awakened with a fright by clanging cookware, it would be Captain Watson. Despite this Sherlock managed to succeed, gathering all he needed from the dish drainer next to the sink.
John stepped into Sherlock’s space without preamble and cradled the pale man’s sharp cheekbones in his smaller hand. “That isn’t someone like you.” The statement was an insistence, a command. “I don’t know what exactly it is that you are, but I know that any being that would take my life so heinously, be they human or not, is nothing like you. And I won’t have you compare yourself to them, even if you are the same in… breed.” John winced at his own choice of word. “Or whatever the proper term would be. I mean no offense to you, truly.”
The evening had started out well – perfect in fact. Sarah’s family seemed to really like him, and a lovely feast was just being laid out on the table when everything went wrong.
John considered the question. Why was John inviting a strange creature he had just met to live in the cabin with him? Was it because the fawn interested him? Was it because he was bored and wanted something more in his life? Was it because he felt badly for Sherlock? These ideas came to John’s mind, but none of them seemed right.
“John needs wear good shoes for walk.” Sherlock instructed, extremely pleased that John willing to venture out with him. John nodded and put on his trainers. “Just how far are we going, Sherlock?” John asked warily as he tied up the laces.
John set down his mug. “You know, I don’t really know. It just is.” Of course Sherlock wouldn’t see the point to the hallmark of everyday British existence. “It’s just… very nice, I guess. And it’s something people do every day.”
It was Sherlock’s turn to breathe and nod, revelations and fear shining in the pale non-color of his eyes. “I need your blood, John.”
“John…” Sherlock rolled to his side on the seat, pulling his coat around him like a child would a blanket to protect from monsters in the night. John considered his friend for a moment before gently sliding him over.
Once the tea was made, John poured a cup and carefully carried it to his bedroom. John liked to have one last cuppa as he relaxed in bed at the end of the day. It helped calm his nerves, and usually helped him drift into peaceful dreams. John set his tea on the bedside table and turned to switch off the bathroom light. It was then that John stopped in his tracks.
“You’re an abomination!” The eldest of the men stepped forward, brandishing a gun from the holster on his belt. “I’ll sleep well this night knowing that I’ve snuffed your scum existence from this earth.”
“The last meeting was held so members of our community could voice their concerns and complaints regarding the behavior of Sherlock Holmes.”
“WELL THAT’S BECAUSE YOU ALL ARE IDIOTS!” John hadn’t meant to say that out loud, or to shout it so loudly. Before he could reassure Sarah’s family that practically everyone was an idiot, he found himself alone on the front porch with only a slammed door in his face to be thankful for, and a long, cold walk home to savor the taste of.
“What is?” Sherlock asked as he lightly poked the eggs with his fork.
“The mysterious bites.” John pulled back the sleeve of his pyjama top to show off his most recent marking, perfectly aligned with the basilic vein in his bicep. “You must know what they are.”
“I love you, Sherlock.” John stated, an indubitable clarification. “Fangs and all.”
“Sherlock?” John reached out a steady hand and attempted to turn his friend to face him. Sherlock winced and exhaled a guttural moan of pain, curling even farther into himself. John immediately switched into doctor mode, face set with determined concern. “What did they do to you? Where are you hurt?”
“It’s a bandage.” John explained. “It wraps up your arm and seals off the wound so it can heal without dirt and bacteria getting into it. It makes it less likely to get infected.” Sherlock looked quite pleased with the new knowledge, saying the word ‘bandage’ a few times happily.
John had tended to Sherlock’s wound every day until it was completely healed. John’s fingers were skilled as they changed the bandage each morning, carefully brushing over Sherlock’s skin. The fawn was a bit sad when it finally healed completely because it meant John would no longer touch him in such a way.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock pressed a fleeting kiss to the palm of John’s hand before turning himself so that he stood squarely between John and the bottom of the stairs.
“Why are you so afraid?” John realized he had thought this aloud when he felt Sherlock tense a bit. When there was no response, John figured he might as well go all in. “Something frightens you, I can see it in your eyes. You separate yourself, from the world, from me...” John could tell that Sherlock was teetering on the edge of sleep and wondered if the man could truly register any of what he said. “You’re so brilliant, so beautiful. What is it that has you so afraid?”
The elder man shot his weapon in a flash of gun smoke, only to have Sherlock flick away the bullet with one of his talons as if it were a fly. Normally the sound of the gunshot would have set John into soldier mode, unleashing the dangerous and calculated rage that was an ever-present simmer underneath his unassuming guise. But Sherlock – the spectacle of his terrifying visage coupled with the domestic knowledge John had of the man –for in spite of the night’s revelations, John knew that Sherlock was human at his core. The sight of the detective in this form was enough to leave John gaping where he stood, but it could never be enough to cause John to question the humanity of the man whose toothbrush sat next to his own in their shared loo at the flat. This ridiculous man, who pouted like a child, and flounced like a gay dancer, and played the violin at all hours of the night…
“That’s because it isn’t for eating, you silly fawn.” John laughed. “They have value. You trade them for the things you need.”
“Doc-tor?” Sherlock asked with interest, having not heard that particular word before.
“I’m dying, John.” Sherlock explained, weak but calm.
The most brilliant truth of all.
“Didn’t work out too well for me.” John took off his coat and sat down in his chair opposite Sherlock. “I thought you were having dinner with Mycroft.”
There was so much to be said, an alarming list of thoughts and feelings and harsh realities to attend to. John knew so little and loved so blindly.
“Cheerios?” Sherlock asked, a bit of disappointment in his voice. John had introduced the fawn to Cheerios and they now were his favorite food. Sherlock was dismayed when John explained that eating Cheerios for every meal was not appropriate.
was the most beautiful, brilliant thing I have ever seen and I wouldn’t trade seeing it for anything in the world.”
Moosecroft would search for him. Sherlock knew this to be true. No doubt Sherlock’s outburst and chosen exile would embarrass his brother greatly. If Moosecroft found Sherlock, he would be angry and much less willing to negotiate Sherlock’s future. At this point, Sherlock wouldn’t put it past the council to force him to sire the children while they watched. The idea sickened him.
“You hid yourself because you thought I’d be afraid.” Sherlock nodded at John’s understanding. “You tried to hold back, but you couldn’t, you never do anything in halves. So you drank from me at night, when I was sleeping.”
Some silent time passed – the sort of settling of being that came naturally after such violence and intensity. John watched the reflection of the moon billow in the water as the boat drifted along, all echoed by the calm and predictable splash of water along the skiff’s hull.
The case had progressively escalated in both danger and intrigue. John had nearly been shot, Sherlock had been a hair’s breadth away from being stabbed more than once. They had jumped off a building, dodged an oncoming subway car, and purchased information from a back-alley whore with an appalling dental abscess. All in a day’s work – until the unexpected ambush in Hackney that ended with John drugged into a regrettable state of unconsciousness. The last thing John could remember before succumbing to the needle in his neck was Sherlock cowering on the ground, seemingly incapacitated by a sudden bright light.
John could barely listen, his own fears sputtering from his lips in desperation. “I don’t – I don’t know what is wrong with you. I can’t – I don’t know how to help you.” He was beginning to truly panic.
Truly, Sherlock was alone in the forest. That is until he wasn’t in the most unexpected way.
Standing in the bathroom mirror, was an ugly, broken man. A short, useless man, shoulder disfigured with a hideous scar. Standing in the bathroom mirror, staring back at John, was the one thing he hated the most in the world: his own reflection.
Sherlock thought this was stupid – a sentiment he vocalized at nearly every forest spirit offering and ceremony. Fawn magic was not bestowed from mystical beings in the sky. There was nothing to even suggest such a fanciful notion. Anyone who wasn’t an idiot could see that the powers of fawn magic existed within the forest itself – in the plants and trees, the roots and the soil. It was an aura present in the wind and sunlight - something unquantifiable, beyond the true understanding of even the greatest scholars.
“What the hell?” he mumbled as he sat up, freeing himself from the tangle of sheets in which he had become entwined during a tumultuous sleep. He immediately grabbed his service revolver, which he kept next to his bed for safety, and made his way to the front of the cabin.
“S’lk!” John stumbled forward to the closet door and forced his own voice to remember the process of speaking. “Lock? Sh’lock…” The pained echoes from the next room were unwavering, each one shaking John to his bones. “Sher-lock!”
Sherlock had been explicitly told that he must attend today’s meeting. Moosecroft had reminded him time and time again, as if reminding Sherlock was going to make him care enough to come. The meeting was to start soon, but Sherlock wasn’t bothered in the slightest. He was too busy engaging in one of his more trivial pursuits: rolling in the grass. Sherlock loved to roll in the grass whilst he pondering things in his mind forest. He enjoyed the feeling of the grass rubbing on his fur, and he liked making a mess of himself. Sherlock was blissfully rolling about when a rustling in the leaves startled him.
John never minded the tidying. Many would joke of him “being the wife”, he knew. But that never concerned him. Their relationship was so much more than that, so much more than any other relationship he had ever known. There were no clear cut roles beyond “Sherlock” and “John”, and at different times those had the capacity to mean different things. And it was all fine because they each knew where they stood, and they stood best together. Every bit of care was reciprocated in its own way, a symbiosis too perfectly balanced to have been anything other than fate by design.
“You dry yourself off with it when you are wet. Here, I have one in the kitchen. I’ll show you.” Little did John know he was about to explain half of his belongings and their uses to the curious fawn, whose interest never seemed to fade.
“W-what?” John sputtered out, not believing his ears.
“You won’t.” John replied, steadfast.
Sherlock suddenly looked flustered, looking at John with a strange uncertainty in his eyes. “It was… an original composition.”
John found it interesting that Sherlock was so removed from the puzzle. Surely, the detective knew that John was receiving the bites. John had mentioned it more than once, and despite John’s overt pondering aloud on the matter numerous times, Sherlock had yet to show even the slightest inkling of interest or contribution.
“No, no, no. It’s okay. I can help. I’m a doctor.” John insisted.
John and Sherlock were tired out after their adventurous day. They just barely managed to finish eating dinner before falling asleep in front of the telly. Despite his garden being ruined, John could honestly say that he had just enjoyed one of the happiest days of his life thus far. He had a feeling it had been one of the happiest for Sherlock as well.
There was a gust of wind, like a gentle tornado. Before John’s very eyes, the brown wisps of dead plants he had been putting off clearing out from his garden began to turn green and fill with life. John watched his ruined garden slowly unfold, sprouts breaking from the soil and growing up towards the sky. Stems outstretched and leaves unfurled. Flowers blossomed and tomatoes ripened from green, to orange, to juicy red.
“Come here…” John turned his friend away from the carnage of the room, pulling them close enough together that he could feel each exhale from breath as it left Sherlock’s lips. John tore a piece from the sleeve of his own shirt and took Sherlock’s hands in his, using the ripped fabric to wipe away the blood, one long finger at a time. “It’s going to be okay.”
Sherlock placed his hands in John’s, holding them tightly. “John is friend to Sherlock. Sherlock could never be scared.”
“I’m sorry…” John managed to huff out between chuckles. “It’s just… you must be the only living being in the entire UK that doesn’t know what tea is. It’s practically a crime against the foundational pillars of English society.”
Fawn magic was exceptional in that it had to be requested – the spirit of the forest could always deny a spell if the intent was not aligned with its mysterious sentiments and lore. This prevented the misuse of fawn incantations, cementing fawn magic as a power for good.
John was fast asleep in his armchair, huffing out grunt-like snores in no particular rhythmic pattern. This late-day nap was the exact opportunity Sherlock had been waiting for. Certain of the soundness of John’s slumber (grunt-like snores meant John would be asleep for at least an hour longer), Sherlock quietly crept out into the purple-tinted canvas of John’s yard.
This “spirit” of the forest, as it was crudely defined by fawnkind, was something of nature. When it denied an incantation, it was not a judgment or divine intervention. Simply put, the denied magical requests failed to align with the nature of the forest itself. If something was against the natural order, it would not be permitted. This is why fawn magic could not be harnessed as a weapon, nor be used as a means to gain beyond what was needed to comfortably survive. It could be used for healing within one’s natural life cycle, but not for immortality. It was a just and unwavering truth, safe from the decay of politics. But of course, Moosecroft and the others had to warp it into a fairytale; an excuse to hold meetings and eat excessive and unnecessary treats.
Also, John was willing to assist Sherlock in any way possible. So far, John had shown Sherlock how most everything in the house worked. John explained electricity, and showed Sherlock how to turn on and off the lights. John happily answered all of Sherlock’s questions, no matter how demanding their delivery was. John had even shown Sherlock the bathroom, and had helped Sherlock out of the toilet when he had fallen in after trying to use it.
“Is leaves.”
There was another shuffle of movement and a soft cry of pain. By now John’s eyes had better adjusted to the darkness and he was able to see out farther. His eye was drawn to a small, huddled figure that was trying to pull itself away. It looked like some sort of animal, and it was obviously hurt. John’s heart immediately softened. He rushed in the house, setting down his revolver and grabbing a blanket.
Sherlock’s only family was his brother. Moosecroft was the opposite of Sherlock in every way. He was the head of the fawn council, which created and enforced the rules and traditions that Sherlock continuously and deliberately ignored. Moosecroft was highly respected, while Sherlock was the freak of the community, always ridiculed for his differences. Moosecroft had earned many honors, his fur covered with ceremonial markings. Sherlock’s fur was bare of distinguishment, leaving only his natural spotting for decoration.
“Sherlock is sent away from fawn territory. Not allowed to be with other fawns.”
“No.” John answered truthfully. “It doesn’t hurt in the slightest.”
“Did I hurt you?” Sherlock asked, quietly terrified.
“How would you know? You’re never out before dusk.” John watched the lines in Sherlock’s forehead flex with an expression of uniquely Holmesian annoyance. “Look at your skin, for Christ’s sake. You look like you’ve never seen a ray of sunlight in your life.”
“Yes. And is not good reason for not swim in lake.” With this, Sherlock tackled John into the water, both of them landing with an epic splash. John chuckled as the perfect water swallowed them in, both completely wet from head to toe.
Sherlock pulled the utensil from where it had been forgotten, chuckling out some deep baritone giggles of his own. “Maybe.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No buts.” John brought a finger to Sherlock’s lips, as if he could physically retrain the man’s anxieties. “I love you, and I don’t care
John showed Sherlock most everything in the kitchen, and quite a few things in the sitting room before both fawn and human grew tired from the night’s adventures and decided to go to sleep - John on his bed and Sherlock on the couch with a blanket from the closet. As they fell asleep, both seemed to notice that the cabin and the forest suddenly felt much less lonely.
Sherlock was always abuzz as they crossed through the door, recounting deductions and facts like a child athlete reliving the highlights of his sports tournament en route to an ice cream parlor for a celebratory cone. He’d hang up his coat with a “John, did you see this?”, and trip over some clutter with an, “Oh, John, you must have seen that!” Sometimes the man would even call out from the loo mid-piss with a, “But really, John, can you believe…,” speeding into a train of thought with more energy and poise than his lack of sleep and nutrition ought to be capable of supporting.
“For now.” Sherlock replied softly. For a stretched bit of silence, both the detective and his blogger searched the ceiling as if it held the answers to the rapidly surfacing questions in their minds.
“Not need, silly John.” Sherlock chuckled. “Is no one else know how find. Can swim not with clothes.” Sherlock gave John’s hand a soft, reassuring squeeze.
John could tell that Sherlock indeed did. Claws and fangs still brandished, the man took a pointed step backwards with a flash of fear in his eyes unlike any John had ever seen there before. “That’s not possible…”
“I don’t know about you, but I’d fancy a cuppa.” John pronounced with a stretch. It had been a considerably sedentary day consisting of a kip on the sofa and some daytime TV. Sherlock, spread out on the floor like an inquisitive ragdoll, perked up from his intense scrutiny of the left-most coffee table leg.
Sherlock turned to John and stared at him again, the same intensity in his piercing eyes. “John is allow Sherlock stay with him in house?” the fawn asked.
… I don’t know how to thank you. For the garden, for trusting me…”
Sherlock turned a shade paler than usual and gave an odd huff in response, turning to his side on the couch and pulling his dressing gown tightly around him in the way that indicated he no longer wished to be spoken to. All was for well, as John had a shift at the surgery in an hour or two, and it was much easier to get ready and leave when Sherlock was lost in his mind palace, and thus unable to protest.
Over the years Sherlock had fashioned a variety of tools for use in his magical experimentation. All of these tools were carefully hidden deep within fawn territory, and likely would never be seen or used by Sherlock again. Completely and utterly at a loss for implements, Sherlock turned to the only armory to which he had access – John’s kitchen.
Trembling so intensely that his raven curls seemed to bounce, Sherlock closed the space between his lips and John’s wrist. Much to John’s surprise, Sherlock pressed the softest of kisses to the vulnerable skin. After a brief moment of blissful lingering during which John let out a breathy gasp the likes of which he had never uttered before, Sherlock pulled back his upper lip and bared his teeth. It was then that John’s eyes widened in unmistakable fear as Sherlock’s uppermost canines descended from the snarl of his Cupid’s Bow, protruding as two deadly fangs.
Molly’s eyes grew into wide and empathetic saucers. For a moment she didn’t say anything, darting a glance from the twin marks on the back of John’s hand to where Sherlock was removing samples of tissue from a severed arm.
“Please…” John begged. “Help me. Take me away from him…” John’s very core burned as he put his best performance into his ploy, struggling onto two legs, only to allow himself to collapse to the ground at the men’s feet. “You have to help me, I think I’m dying…” John outstretched his arm to the elder man, the scars on his wrist on careful display. “That monster… he drank from me.”
As the pair went outside, John put on his gardening hat. Sherlock, ever opinionated, had announced upon first seeing the gardening hat that it was “stupid”. The idea of needing a specific hat for gardening confused the fawn. “Does wear hat help plants grow?” he had asked John the first day.
“Hey.” John’s fingers wandered from the leaf, gently taking Sherlock’s furred hand into their grasp. “It’s alright.”
John returned and hour and a half later with a trunk full of groceries and a few other purchases. Much to his happiness, the cabin appeared to still be standing. John’s anxiety about leaving Sherlock alone in the cabin had grown on him with every minute he was away. God only knows what destruction the fawn would be capable of if left to his own devices long enough.
“Obvious.” The fawn said. His eyes were locked on John, seeming to see everything about him. “Sherlock.” the fawn said, motioning to himself with his uninjured arm. “Name is Sherlock. Am fawn.”
“I’m told this is rare. Fashioned from a certain tree, found only in a dangerous and unholy place.” The elder man passed the wood from hand to hand, testing its weight. “I do not entertain questions from demons of your kind, but I will tell you this of the man who sent us here.”  The elder man gave the wood a strong and sudden swing through the air, the sound of which was enough to make Sherlock flinch as if he had been struck. “The man who sent us gave me this, and he told me that it can kill you.”
“Let’s take a look at you,” John would announce. Sherlock would let John slide out to sit on the coffee table, just across from him so that their knees were touching. John would check him over. Look at Sherlock’s face, check his arms, scan for any cuts or bruises he wasn’t already aware of. John would feel from Sherlock’s shoulders down his sides, all the way along his legs and down to his feet. Sherlock would insist he was fine, and usually he was. Anything uncovered was seen to, usually with a plaster and some antiseptic. And it was always then that John would find himself on the floor, between Sherlock’s knees, hands petting over Sherlock’s thighs.
How wonderful it must be to find joy in such a simple thing, John thought to himself. But as he thought this, John realized that with Sherlock in his life, he was falling to the whim of simple joys himself – something that wasn’t too shabby, considering the overall lack of joy he’d had in his life for such a long, long time.
“How can you know that for sure?” There was fear in Sherlock’s words.
Sherlock gathered the plant’s blue-and-gold-speckled purple berries, adding them to his pouch. He ended up with more of the juicy, seed-filled berries than he had planned because the specimen he had found was especially fruitful. This pleased Sherlock, because it meant he could plant more of them in John’s garden and use them for experiments. John deserved to have magical plants surrounding his house, Sherlock decided with a nod.
John could infer the truth in the man’s statement simply from the faint and uncharacteristic tremble in Sherlock’s stance. Perhaps to another’s eyes the fear wouldn’t be visible – a tremor unseen beneath the armor of Sherlock Holmes. But John knew Sherlock, and he could see clearly.
“Look at me.” Sherlock reached out a trembling hand and cupped John’s face. “Look at me, John.”
On this particular evening there was to be a meeting of the fawn council. These meetings were held quite often- nearly every week. Despite the relatively steady weekly and occasionally bi-weekly occurrences of the fawn council meetings, Moosecroft and the other fawns treated each one as if it was a rare, precious happening. Why treat such a common thing as a unique anomaly? Everything seemed to be a reason for a fawn council meeting. Is it too sunny? Fawn council meeting. Is it too rainy? Fawn council meeting. Is Moosecroft in the mood to flaunt his high ranking in the fawn community and ramble on for an adoring audience, all while using the occasion as an excuse to add to his already fat appearance by eating seed cakes from the refreshments table? Fawn council meeting.
Another quiet moment passed, filled only with night air and the gentle slosh of the Thames. Sherlock seemed to be absorbing John’s words, considering them deeply.
Sherlock’s expression, equal parts annoyance and confusion, was perfectly complimented by his ears, which had flattened out it opposite directions, much like a perturbed cat’s. John, finally at the end of his laughing fit, reached out and mussed one of Sherlock’s ears. The fawn flinched away, not amused.
Sherlock gave the tiniest wobble of a smile - a faint upturn of lips shy with sentiment. “I would like that very much.”
Sherlock was pondering the issue when he noticed something off in the distance. There was light coming out from the tress off yonder. Sherlock looked at the distant light with great curiosity. He had not been to that area of the forest yet. The light was different than the glow of a fire. It did not move with the wind or crackle as firelight usually would.
“You… you can speak?” John exclaimed in amazement. “You just…. spoke to me.”
“I never have dinner with Mycroft.”
John slowly fixed it up. He tore down the existing structure and found that the foundation was still strong. From that he was able to rebuild and repair the cabin one section at a time. It took nearly six months of labor-filled days and tent-housed nights for John to repair the structure to the point that it was livable. Much to John’s relief, the end result was actually quite quaint. A small cabin nestled in the woods with its own garden as well as running water and electricity, the nearest town a 45-minute drive away. It was just the right amount of space to be alone, while also allowing John reasonable access to groceries and other daily necessities.
“Fawns stay far away from humans. Live in far forest, in fawn territory.” Sherlock explained. “Never go where people can see.” John finished tying the bandage and admired his work. Then he put his supplies back in the medical kit and set it aside, sitting next to Sherlock on the couch.
“I couldn’t do what John does – putting up with someone who doesn’t have feelings.” John visibly tensed when the words came out of Sarah’s mouth. She had met Sherlock – how could she say he didn’t have feelings? John couldn’t come up with a response, as a protective anger began to simmer in the pit of his stomach.
Sherlock drank from John’s arm with the desperation of a parched refugee who had crossed the deserts, wantonly slurping and groaning with relief. John watched as the color began to resurface in Sherlock’s eyes, and slowly was able to sense the other man’s pulse. It was as if John was watching a corpse reanimate before his eyes. Pale skin turned rich with life, so far as to paint a light blush across Sherlock’s cheeks. It was remarkable and impossible, but John had no doubt that it was really happening and not just some fever dream.
“John! John!” Sherlock yelled, leaping in front of the chair. “Sherlock has something to show you!” John looked up from his paper, a bit annoyed at how loud Sherlock was being.
And oh, the look in Sherlock’s eyes. Because it always came down to that look, that disbelief, that wonder of
“Moran…” The word croaked out with a rush of coughed blood. “Sebastian… he’s going to end you.” With that, the elder man fell limply to the floor.
“No.” John insisted. “I’m not too kind. You deserve this.” John trailed his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. “Unless this isn’t what you want…”
“Do you live in the forest?” John asked, hoping some conversation might distract Sherlock from the inevitable pain. Sherlock nodded, not bothering to look up at John. “I see.” John continued stitching the wound. “And there are others, like you. Other fawns in the forest?” Sherlock nodded again, eyes not leaving John’s expert work on his arm. John carefully tied off the last stitch and traded off the surgical thread for some bandages.
“John. I need you to listen to me.” Sherlock’s voice was steady, though still a ghost of its usual self.
All the while Sherlock continued speaking those most vibrant of words. The fawn was beautiful, moonlight catching on every strand of fur, all of which seemed to pulse in time with the beat of his heart and the miraculous growth of the garden. Everything felt connected – the trees, the night – and John could only grasp to the edge of the picket fence and witness that which he was certain he was not meant to see. This was far greater than human, far more profound.
“Yes.” John replied confidently. “It means you are better and more important to me than any other friend I’ve ever had in all of my life.”
John slowly made his way up the stairs, transfixed with the sound, which grew louder as he came closer to the flat. It filled his cold body with warmth and peace, while leaving his very being feeling as if it was missing something. John felt as if his heart had been ripped from him when the music suddenly stopped. He made his way up the rest of the stairs and went into the flat.
“I can’t – I don’t have time to tell you now.” He didn’t, John could tell. Each of Sherlock’s words was weaker than his last. “Do you… trust me?”
All the haughty indifference fell from Moosecroft’s expression and he immediately turned to investigate. Indeed, the roots of the sacred tree were letting off a soft and ebbing glow.
“I’m sure you’ll get it eventually.” John chuckled, giving Sherlock’s hand a squeeze. “Let’s get you home and then we can practice it again.” They practiced saying it the entire walk back and Sherlock never did say it correctly.
The chuckled comfortably floated away on the breeze, leaving the two quiet and together in the bobbing skiff.
“Nowhere.” Sherlock replied, staring at his hands.
“That’s all his lot is good for.” The elder of the men replied with a gruff chortle. “Squirming as they burn in God’s light.”
Sherlock gave a nod and did not respond. He stayed deep in thought for the rest of the ride back to London.
The first time John noticed it was roughly a week after he had initially moved into 221b. There was a slight itch near the ankle of his left foot. John had to crane his leg at an awkward angle to investigate, and when he did he was utterly puzzled by what he found. There were two raised bumps, approximately an inch apart. They almost looked like bug bites, but they were too large and far too perfectly spaced.
There was a beat, much like the pause between a flash of lightning and the resulting crack of thunder. And much like a crack of thunder, Sherlock erupted in a bout of deep, crisp chuckles that brought life to the dreary circumstances in the same way that John’s blood had to Sherlock’s own skin. John chimed in with his own boyish guffaws, embarking detective and blogger on a giggle fit that lasted several minutes and ended with each man clutching at the other to brace himself against the sheer onslaught of laughter.
The cabin was worse than John had remembered. The walls were infested with termites, weakened enough that parts of the roof had caved in. The garden was overgrown with weeds and other undesirable plants. Most ironic to John however, was the fact that he had inherited the keys to a cabin that had no door. The original door must have been carried off in a storm or stolen by campers. Either way, John had his work cut out for him.
“John…” Sherlock’s voice was but a frail wisp of its usual baritone. “I…. need… your help…”
From that day forward, the song, which Sherlock playfully named “Thanks Be To Watson”, was a Thanksgiving (and any night John wanted to hear it) tradition, reminding the men that they had plenty to be thankful for as long as they had each other, and that neither would ever spend Thanksgiving alone again, all because of the best Thanksgiving John Watson had ever experienced in all his life.
Sherlock tried to think of anywhere he knew that would be appropriate. While he knew much of the land beyond fawn territory, Sherlock could not think of anywhere where he would be safe from discovery or attack.
“Is that my spatula in your antlers?”
At first John didn’t see anything. “Hello? Someone there?” he called out, opening the door further. There was no response, but John thought he heard a sound, like someone moving in the darkness.  “You should be mindful, I’m an ex-soldier, so trying to rob me would be considerably unwise.”
To John’s surprise, he felt the light touch of furred fingers dancing over his ruined skin. He opened his eyes to see Sherlock examining his scar closely. There was no fear or disgust in his eyes. Only interest and concern.
“Is taste like water with leaves.” Sherlock gave the tea a second try, seemingly unimpressed. “Leaf water is… important?” He questioned after a moment, cocking his head to the side.
John stopped in his tracks. “You’re joking.”
It wasn’t that having a family sounded terrible, nor was it that Moosey Hooper was a bad choice of a mate. It really came down to the fact that Sherlock had never been attracted to anyone ever, and was not about to force himself into trying to be attracted to Moosey because the council decreed that he do so. While most would probably assume Sherlock had never mated because no one would consider taking him as a mate, the truth was he never was interested in any of the other fawns. They all were such idiots - all of them.
