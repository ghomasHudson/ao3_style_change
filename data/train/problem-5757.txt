“Hmm,” Tony tapped the blade to his cheek in thought. “Ah, how about a gift for my new sister? Something I am sure all would enjoy though.”
So after over a year, this is finally updated. Sorry...adulting...yuck. I hope I made up for it with a longer chapter!
Steve had no idea what to do. He had dreamt of being in Tony's arms for so long and now he was here and he had no idea what to do or what was going on. The hands, so strong they carried metal and the world, were gently caressing over Steve's bare stomach. And then the lips, with a slight tickle of the goatee, trailed over the exposed nape.
“Right, right. You got soaps to catch up on.” He swirled his hand around like a conductor. “Bring them in.”
To think it was possible to close his eyes after accepting death and then wake up to find himself seventy-years into the future? That this man before him was Howard’s son? That alone almost made the whole story even more impossible because Howard with a child? It was painful and laughable to think of.
“Isn’t that a pretty sight,” he purred, his fingers brushing off the remains of the fabric, “my pretty, pretty bride.”
“Brock, really. I know there is no longer a woman present in our lives but even I don’t want to hear such talk about Steven.” Pierce snapped his fingers. “Continue.”
‘Yeah, right…what other day. This is almost every day now.’ Steve thought as he slowly stepped out, watching the firm back get further and further away. ‘I got to try something. Just…’ he briefly held his new tattoo, thumb brushing over the ink that still burned, and remembered the gold on his hip and…
She tilted her head, thought for a moment, and then nodded. “Yes, here follow me.” She walked around her desk and off down a hallway of books. Steve’s brows rose when he noticed her dressed in men’s pants rather than traditional skirts.
“Nah, that’ll be the idiot.” And then she tossed Thor over to Clint, who was not prepared, and watched in glee as the man was crushed.
Tony rubbed his fingers over Steve’s again but did not break eye contact. Finally, Steve was approaching a topic Tony had eagerly wanted to face. “Does it make you uncomfortable?”
The family became lost in their new topic of business so Steve excused himself to clean plates and gather his materials for the day. He needed to make it into the attic and the thought made him itchier than it should have.
Tony let out a whoosh a breath and did his best to will the thoughts of the beautiful man out of his system. Now that he was young again, it felt like he could get hard because of a breeze (a sexy breeze, he thought with a snort) so any thought of his captain would not be good for him in this situation. And he was not taking care of things like masturbation when big, purple, and ugly was around.
“Trying to reach you through that incredibly dense skull.” Tony leaned over and gave another nip to Steve’s neck.
“Steve,” Sam reached over and gently grabbed Steve’s shoulder. “If you need help, don’t fret about speaking to anyone about it. As I told you, we are a close community. We are willing to help others out.”
Tony brought his face closer, glaring, “Good.” He hissed and then kissed him, shoving his tongue past the full lips to consume. Pushing Steve back, he began to slowly grind their clothed erections against each other.
“You’re looking forward to it as much as I am.” Tony added the third slick finger, worming them around without mercy as he thrust them in. “Tell me how much you like it. Tell me.”
“Details. We can go into the biological warfare, you are getting better at that, but I was thinking of something to make it feel like something is worming inside a body.” Tony hummed in thought. “Like how they used rats to eat people alive. But PETA approved. Let’s keep the live animals away from the torture scene, yeah?”
“You a ghost?” Steve crossed his arms over his chest, attempting to appear rough, rather than protecting himself. “I have heard this place is haunted.”
“I…well, no.” It felt shameful to admit it. Clearly Tony had lines of people competing for his attention. He was probably seduced on a daily basis. With his looks, charisma, and wealth there was no doubt about it. It felt wrong for Steve, the plain virgin he was, to try and pursue anything.
"I want to show you something our followers have been working on the past years." He nodded to the shadows and an ugly looking creature hobbled out, holding a small machine with two wires with fine points at the end. It was simple looking really, awkwardly so, as it was just a metallic box, about the size of the tesseract, with noodle wires. "It may not look  like much but it has taken time to ensure its stability."
“Doing what?” Tony hummed as he looked at Steve with heavy eyes. He made no move to put his shirt back on.
Steve’s head fell back against the desk in mild relief. There was not much worse in the other realm than a demon. “So…a deal was made…and you were born.”
He leaned closer, unsure if he was ready to touch just yet, and absorbed all the features of the sleeping face. It was not nearly as squared-jaw and gruff looking either. In fact, it was almost feminine. Steve Rogers could be called beautiful rather than handsome. The homophobic and masculine propaganda of the time probably did not much appreciate the look of a man with such naturally pink, full lips and lashes that looked like angel wings.
." Josh hissed, doing a slow double-fist pump. "I could puke I am so happy...this thing was almost as nightmarish as you. Of course the simple ones always are."
“Good. See? That’s a good thing. This is fine. You’re fine. You’ve just taken over the whole world, for Christ’s sake. You can go and see this man.”
“You have one yourself, darling.” Tony purred and pushed himself back onto the larger man. “Fuck, you are adorable.”
“Thank you kindly.” Steve said with a smile as he started to make his way out of the door to go search the larger building beside him.
Thor just continued to sulk, “I would take good care of him, if you share. I shall provide him plenty of pleasurable orgasms!”
“Bruce, you’ll be happy to know I want to keep you hidden. The public knowing your whereabouts right now isn’t the best. I want you in a lab. Any lab of your choosing and I want you to make some progress on the Tesseract-technology. That needs unlocked sooner rather than later since I’m positive Odin is going to demand it in return for future alliances.”
Tony blinked and then grinned like a predator, “You challenging me, babe? You shouldn’t tempt a wolf with something delicious, you know.”
Tony certainly seemed to have a promise in his eyes as he stared back at Steve with equal dreamy adoration.
“Not like what the others get. Something special. Something meant just for you, my dear, dear heart.”
His fingers briefly pinched the cloth binding of the book and did his best not to shift in his seat. He did not need cold eyes on his person and his only reprieve from the hours of travel stolen from his hands. Steve felt blessed he was allowed to have a novel for his mind during the hours. Normally, he would be without anything, not even conversation, and the mercy twisted up his insides hotly.
“Yes, yes…you’re going to make me a daddy, won’t you my darling? You’ll take my seed so well and give me a baby. Yes, yes…oh, yes, fucking take it.”
“What,” he licked his lips in confusion and Tony made an unusual reaction to it. It was a sharp noise, like a powerful grunt. “What is it?”
“What’s some blood between friends? I remember you telling me stories of your own brother taking some hits at you. Ah, yes, yes, rest his soul and all that.” Tony waved off Thor’s broken expression.
Shaking his head, he pushed the drawer closed and felt comfort to know everything was untouched and safe. One of his first sets of personal business in his new room was to find a place to keep all the items safely. Pierce and Brock both were not shy strangers in searching his room and confiscating things they don’t feel he should have. Everything in the drawer was too precious for him to lose and though he can make do with little materials he was not prepared to lose anything within the drawer.
“Your first command is a koala? Ridiculous, ritzy, and unnecessary? You after my heart or something?”
“Excuse me for interrupting.” He muttered as he brushed past them to get to the coffee pot. “Just getting a refill.”
And Steve still held on to his, what he was coming to realize old-fashion, morals. He’d been sort of…well, ravaged before and yeah he liked the physical part of it though not what it did to Peggy, but that did not change the fact he’d appreciate actual romance and not some romps in the sheets. At least for his first time, thank you very much.
“Well, it looks livable at least.” Steve tried as he walked around the group to avoid any walloping. “I can get started on some minor projects. And come spring, I can start shaving and painting. Perhaps by summer it can almost look worthy of the Pierce name.” He found it always beneficial to sprinkle in a kind word here or there when Pierce was in a foul mood. Steve rarely used it, he was not one to lie, but he also enjoyed avoiding a beating.
Steve waved the concern away, “I’ve slept for seventy-years. And you actually have me on a curfew,” he gave Tony an unimpressed glare. “I’ve slept enough.”
An inhuman noise escaped Tony’s throat as he shoved Steve to the bed, pinning him down. His teeth went to the junction of Steve’s neck and he sunk them in, hard, bringing out blood.
“In the kitchen. She told me to stop being so harsh and listen to you. I didn’t think you would come after me…but I promised myself if you did I would listen…and you did.” His canine gave a little pinch to Steve’s bottom lip. “You came after me.”
“No! I don’t know you!” Steve threw his hands up, “I just found you’re a Fae living in the walls of my new home! What part of that means time to rush to a bed for an interspecies romp?!”
“My, so scandalous.” Young Howard chuckled. “Come on, doll, say something inspirational and sweet. Your normal shtick.”
“Three,” she held up three fingers to show her point, “if you have to ask us, the answer is probably yes. Do we do such-and-such? Yeah, probably.”
Steve was worth all the hard work, there would never be an argument to that, but the necessities did not do well for Tony’s cold temper. His Steve needed all of this medical-attention because some fucking bastards hurt him. Because Steve thought he had no choice but to become a martyr and kill himself to save people who were probably not very grateful.
“Sucks for you then.” Tony closed his eyes to meditate for a few seconds and lounged against the desk. The uncontrollable tornado was stirring once again.
“You’ll love Howl’s Moving Castle then. Watch everything of Studio Ghibli. Everything. Except for Grave of the Fireflies.” She looked him over, “War movies may not be the best for you.”
“The hell you mean anytime soon?!” Steve picked himself up, trying to turn and glare at his boyfriend.
“Thanos had you.” He moved in closer, trying to check the man for any injuries. “I…don’t…I couldn’t get to you…I’m…” his hands fell limply down, his brain catching up with what he was doing.
“No!” Tony rounded on him, approaching him quickly, a new form of panic etched on his face. “No, no. Sorry, I know I’m making this out to be…it’s…look,
“Perhaps bring in some undercover ops on your outing? Ms. Romanov will be back this weekend for her duty. After her project is completed she could follow after you both. Maybe add a few members from SHIELD’s task force to interfere if necessary.” Jarvis paused before he filled up the screen with multiple files and pictures of men and women. “These seven here seem highly qualified to become members of a protective force for Mr. Rogers. Mr. Brock Rumlow is Level 7, probably second best in assassins after Black Widow. Or our dear Agent Phil. He does have an impressive resume.”
Sickening. To think because Steve chose the heroic path he was suffering like so much. Tony would not stand for it.
Tony grabbed him, spun him around, and shoved him up against the wall. Instantly, his body was pressed tightly against Steve’s and he started to grind, leaving Steve to see stars, and let out a surprised breath that Tony swallowed instantly in a demanding kiss.
“Should be easy enough.” Bruce admitted. “Surprised you want to bring tech into the mix. You like feeling the breaks.”
"This is when World War Two started." Steve pointed, higher up on his side. "And this is when Bucky joined and then when I joined."
“You eat all of that, Stark.” Steve warned with a frown on his face. “Jarvis told me of your poor diet. If you’re working so hard you need to balance it out with energy.”
Strangely, and embarrassingly enough, looking at all these attractive people, as everyone saw were beautiful, just made Steve want Tony in bed even more.
“Steve.” He said before he could stop himself. Giving this man his name did not seem like the smartest decision. He bit his lip to prevent the release of his last name. Something told him that was not something he should do.
With the sun setting, the home loomed. It was three stories tall, with black windows, and three columns on each side of the door, holding up a once extravagant balcony on the second story. It was white, probably once the color of milk, though many areas were peeled back to show rotted wood. In the center face of the home, overlooking the plains and town before it, was a large circular window. The design within it was that of an upside down triangle, quite an unusual formation…and made it look like the pupil of a dragon’s eye.
“Tony,” Steve hissed, attempting to move his hips but Tony’s other hand pressed him back down in place. “Tony, please.”
“That’s fine.” Tony hummed to himself, his eyes looking a little glazed as he started to unbutton Steve’s jeans. “Let’s get you out of these…get my bride more comfortable.”
“Nah,” Tony stretched out his back, getting rid of the last traces of weariness from waking up, “Shower time.”
“YES!” He threw his hands up in frustration before they instantly were gripping at Steve’s bare arms, like he hated to be away from the exposed skin. “You thought you had to lie to me because you failed or some shit like that. You thought you had to be the burden to all of it and resolve it on your own because you didn’t want to hurt my
A yelp escaped him as he tumbled to the ground, his knee throbbing from the surprise hit. He briefly saw colored spots in his vision and for a few seconds he could not catch his breath.
“M-Mama?” He paused and blinked. No, that was not right. Ma had been dead for some time. He was an adult now. He was a soldier and no longer sickly. He was on a mission, yes, and Peggy was crying and the ocean was getting so close and it was dark…
“Meh, so I’m an old man with a dirty mind. Sue me. So I’m gold…” He tugged at Steve’s jeans, peaking down at the tattoo that was just for him. “My guess is green is Mean Green.”
“Alright Ms. Potts, I’m here and sweaty.” He announced as he arrived. Instantly he was relaxed and light once in his own home. It was still and empty and filled with just himself. It was a nice contrast to the party. He could not even make out the thumping of the music three floors below. It was his space. His territory.
“It’s not pleasant…many of my kind and how we behave. And we have a long history and stories of mistreating those who are different.” He could not help but give Tony a shameful look. “Everyone is worth more than that.”
Walking out, Steve had a lot to think about. Wanda was very helpful, perhaps a reader like himself and eager to share something or maybe just a kind soul who wanted to warn the newcomer…regardless, now Steve had a little more information on Shield Manor.
“There we go. Good,” Tony smiled warmly and it lit up his face. It was sharper than Howard’s but at the same time far younger despite the man looking a little older. “So very, very good.”
There were noises, very familiar ones. Panic laced with confusion. No explosions. No sounds of screaming bullets and crying men, whispering prayers for moms and homes.  Dum Dum, the gentle giant, was struggling to keep his tone positive as another camp had been found and there were so many deaths and…no, no, he wasn’t in the field.
Like the first time, it was hard to keep up and know what to do, but he allowed his jaw to relax and have Tony use him however he wanted. He found the sounds coming from Tony were thrilling and made something like pride fill his chest. Steve moaned, letting everything vibrate around Tony’s hard member, and gave a small pinch of his teeth at the tip.
By the time he was eleven, Tony had an impressive Captain America collection. He would watch the films weekly. He would obsessively ask Howard for more stories and more pictures, just more, and for the most part Howard never grew tired of it. Maria was concerned, as Tony could become fixated on a project, but found that the goodness of Captain America worked in her favor.
“I don’t care.” Tony went back to kissing, finding that a far better focus. “We’re not talking about this. I’ve needed you for far too long, far too many fucking years, and I am not going to listen to this nonsense.”
“I had a feeling you would drag your feet to show me anything new, why I can’t figure, but you wouldn’t hide anything unless you would think I’d disprove. Given my veteran status on what is apparently called one of the worst, inhumane wars in history…I thought it safe you would not want me anywhere near something like that.”
“Hush, love. It’s ok. I know. I understand now.” His lips began to trace the outline of Steve’s face, making the man freeze. “Everything will be ok. I’m here and I got you.”
“Character.” She would have said. “This place has character. It’s been lived in and then forgotten. It has a story. It just needs a little love and that voice will come right back out.” She probably would’ve tickled him and urge him to go dance in the woods so a Banshee could steal him off. His mother always loved filling his head with stories and giving him spooks so they would have to keep their voices down as they shared a giggle.
"All set." Steve said, smiling to himself as the miniature stabs began. "All the ink is holding up?"
Now, before we start this is, well, a rather explicit chapter. I won't say it is heavy (at least in comparison to how many others are written) but it for sure needs the rating change I think. So be on the look out for: sex, anal sex, mentions of oral sex, possessiveness, some dubious consent, some dubious action, some hints of sadism and masochism, and Steve seems to love it...so there is that!
You_Light_The_Sky: YO, made the dark!Tony for you!! You're the best inspiration for it! Thank you for the support and push!
“Hmm,” Tony played with the knife, his eyes never straying from Steve. “Keep a watch over him. I need to go and have a discussion with the rest of the family.”
‘Mine.’ He thought and glee washed over him. The dear Captain would not get to see the peaceful world he worked so hard for but Tony gave it to him none the less. It was not much, but it made Tony feel proud. He had done something for the hero no one else had. Only he thought of the fallen man. Only Tony had the means and power to accomplish something this grand. Only Tony gave one fallen Steve Rogers a gift of peace.
Tony was about to argue that, that no it was not Steve’s body anymore. It belonged to Tony. And any type of hurt onto Steve was never worth it. But he could see the stubbornness, the need to give, in Steve’s expression and frowned, “Love, the…Howard had some of that. Had some of you from the original experiment. It wasn’t enough.”
Wrapping his fists up to his elbow, searching for his blades. They were slick and made of a metal not from earth; something that felt somewhat similar to iron but was made of a harder material. It was sharpened to a point normally only achieved by laser back home. It could cut through stone, perhaps even give Steve's shield a terrible blow, and skin fell apart slicker than paper to scissors.
“Maybe one day…I am still figuring these babies out.” He held up his wrist with the stones. “They serve me but there is still so much to unlock…but while I figure that out for you, how about the next best things?”
“It means that many good things in this life are fragile and when people, like the ones here, like the one who put you here,” he squeezed the teenager’s shoulder protectively, “try to grasp that good for themselves and won’t let it go. They cage it. Sometimes the good needs someone to rescue it.”
The ceiling, which was the roof to the whole mansion, was above him. Even the wealthiest of locations had a cold roof; something that always needed repair and could never quite keep the chill out.
“Yeah, I think I like the idea of listening to you tell all of it to me while you are sweaty and panting after a good few rounds in the bed. A bed-time story of sorts.”
“Of course, anything.” Tony led Steve to the massive couch and helped him to sit down. He remained close by, going so far as to rub his thumb over Steve’s knuckles. “Do you need a drink? Maybe something with a lot of alcohol in it?”
Steve flopped back into the cushions and sighed. He could barely keep up with everything. He was in the future, the war was over, there was this madman Tony who liked to remove shirts and cause heart-attacks and apparently had a team…of what, Steve did not know and he wasn’t sure he was ready to know just yet. There was so much in him he thought he might explode.
The man bit his lip but maneuvered around to get comfortable and do as told. It was hard to process what was happening as he just woke up from such a sated, deep sleep, but he found he had no complaints as he began to grow hard with Tony’s look and orders.
It took him by surprise to realize he was nearly done before three hours had passed. He wouldn’t be in charge of decoration, that would come down the timeline when they were stable and the men could afford trips into bigger cities. He felt lucky they were able to salvage some of their old furniture and have it deliver to the manor before hand. Not much, only three beds and two wardrobes but something to keep them comfortable for the time.
Steve stared at him, hard, his mouth was tight to keep it from trembling. He was a grown man, a leader, a soldier, and there was no way he was going to cry about anything right now. It was too much…change in climate, power, energy, everything...but he could handle it. He had to handle it. He still sniffled and bit his lip when he felt it shake.
“No, no!” Tony grabbed Steve’s face and gave him a few kisses of comfort, “It’s not boring or awkward or bad or anything like that. God, I adore it. I’m addicted. Making love to you every day could never get old.”
“I can see that, Point Break.” Tony blinked, not too surprised, but found it quite sexy. “Didn’t you also knock out a tank, babe?”
“Thanks for that. Alright,” Tony went back to looking Steve over. “I guess we’re as ready as ever for this.”
“An Italian dream, at least that’s what she said the boys from her old town used to call her.” Tony grinned. “I get the feeling they said other things but she wanted to keep it as PG-Disney as possible for me. Heard from old friends she was a bit of a wild-child.”
“You’re already taking care of me.” His breath hitched when Tony’s hand wrapped around him and lazily started to pump, “T-Tony.”
The image changed to outside a dirtied restaurant with residue of alien carcasses and New York rubble around.
Tony knew it was a lie but didn’t call him out on it. He didn’t want to push Steve closer to a breaking point. He had known things were not as easy for Steve in the army as it was presented, a simple injection in a spacecraft cocoon, but he had no idea that this had happened. Operations…someone had opened up his Steve. They had carved into him to figure out how he ticked. Had he been forced awake? Did he have memories of the pain of his body forced to grow from 5’3 to 6’2—all his bones cracking, his skin ripping, and his insides being realigned?
"You don't say." Tony pulled away, glaring at his captor. "Should probably not come as a surprise to you. If it does, you're an idiot."
"You got it dude!" She gave him a thumbs up which he returned. He watched as she went down the stairs, taking one at a time, before he went into the bedroom at the end of the hall where the door was plastered with bunnies, next to the one painted with flowers and dragons--Morgan was in a fairy-tale stage.
‘Steve…’ Not for the first time had that name bounced around his head. It should’ve been Pepper or Rhodey or, hell, even Friday…instead it was good ol’ Captain America.
Hiss pale cheeks flushed, Steve looked away, trying to collect his thoughts. “I…have guesses but no true idea.”
Tony wrapped himself even closer in retaliation. “You’re bright enough that a little distraction will be fine. I want to hold you so I will hold you.”
Tony threw back his head and laughed, it was such a gorgeous sound that had not been heard for some time. “Holy shit.”
Doing his best not to scream, the other end of the wire punctured the back of his head, right where the neck and skull meet, and something grappled on tight under the skin. He could feel something pulsing and moving.
“No matter how good you are with your dick, you will not get your way with everything.” Steve warned.
“Ok.” Steve looked at him expectantly and at their intertwined hands, a shy blush on his face. “We going in?”
Tony hadn’t meant to fall asleep inside of Steve; as sexy and content of a feeling as it was, he knew it wasn’t the most comfortable for his partner. Or normal partners…Steve had proven he was anything but normal. His twelve orgasms proving this fact.
“Now, don’t look so fearful, little one. You’re safe.” The man, or creature, had a smile like an interested viper.  “You are far too beautiful and interesting to get rid of now. You haven’t said those needed words.”
The few people around him, which really only consisted of Tony and Sam, were trying their best to help him. Steve appreciated their hard efforts regardless of how pushy or touchy they, primarily Tony, became. It made him wonder what would have happened to him had someone else found him in comatose state. What would he be like without someone so involved with his emotional progress?
He laughed again. The sound made Steve feel like a meek maiden about to swoon. “Not part of your imagination, little one. Though I have to say, if I were, you have fantastic taste.”
Steve could not help but swallow and found his throat burning. Had this been more normal, just another day on the field, Steve without a doubt would be as flustered as a school-girl. The unnamed man was his perfect type.
“I…I just…God, Jarvis…I can’t let him out of my sight. I don’t like being away from him. He’s practically all I think about.” His chest burned and his muscles bunched up in his back. He remembered Sam’s words about Steve needing freedom and he snarled.
“Whoa.” Clint blinked owlishly through the video. “You have Captain America. THE Captain America? You’re gonna FUCK CAPTAIN AMERICA?”
Unconscious, Steve choked at first, not expecting it—but after the second helping, the young man’s starving body took what Tony offered him naturally.
“Of sorts,” Tony pinched his backside and laughed when he blushed and tried to shoo him away as if Natasha changed anything. His Captain was so cute. He’d learn his place soon enough. “Work has actually ended for everyone. I wanted you to officially meet my family.”
Thanos heaved a sigh, "This fire you have in you, Anthony, is brilliant and necessary as my heir...but you are only hurting yourself with how much you fight me. I have given you plenty of time, hundreds of years, to see the right path but you still refuse. If not for it being so vital, and you not on the wrong side, this would be something to be proud over."
“Yes, sir.” Jarvis said. “The first two days after awakening you wish to keep Mr. Rogers in bed as a precaution. You have made a list of movies and TV-shows for him to watch as a way to help catch up on some of the pop-culture of the world.”
His fingers were desperate to press into Thanos’ eyes and gouge them out. He wanted to make this monster wail.
He gave himself props for not going insane a long time ago but that will only be for so long. His daydreams of a life with Steve were hyper-real and each time he woke from them a bit more of him died. A vision of Steve plagued his waking moments and no matter how many times he tried to fight it, he would always reach for the shadow of the man.
“No. I didn’t.” Steve snapped. “I just…oh.” He looked down once his eyes caught sight of a glow that really had no place to be anywhere close to them.
“You seem…” Steve struggled to find an appropriate, non-insulting, and non-impatient, word to describe the man. “Tired?”
“Start breathing and relaxing properly and I will. I want it to hurt but not too much this first time.”
“Yeah, tabling the conversation for later.” Tony rubbed the back of his head and avoided eye contact. So his overprotectiveness still itched at him more than he’d like to admit. It wasn’t that bad that he wanted to ensure the love of his life, who had hundred of enemies and admirers who would love to take him away from Tony, was safe every second of the day. “Much later.”
“Hearing you all say my name is not nearly as thrilling as it is when my bride says it. You all are making it so repetitive. Let’s keep it to Stark.” At their hurt and surprised look he huffed, “
Tony watched as Steve earned an impressed slap on the back from Thor and obnoxious cheers from Clint when he handled a sip of Asgard’s mead with only a mild choking fit. Something no mortal man should be able to handle.
“Well, practice makes perfect.” Tony kissed him and kicked the blankets off of them, very eager to begin. “I’ll need to try not to bruise you this time.”
Steve looked away and back to his plate. Tony wrapped his fingers around the wrist and felt his pulse. It was fluttering wildly. Tony had to bite back a grin.
Still standing to the side, waiting for the dining to stop to take the plates and find scraps, Steve swallowed. “I do apologize for the lateness. With the larger order, it just took extra time to put it all together.”
“Spice…” Steve blinked as his head tried to wrap around the phrase. It took him a moment for it to click. “Spice up…oh…wait, oh, you mean explore more aspects and ways of us sleeping together?”
“Yes, my son, you could bring them all back if you wish. Though, I know you won’t. Not when I am done with you and you are ready to take my place.”
Tony’s hands roamed over Steve’s chest, his face flushed and eyes slightly dazed from lust. “Guess for my bad boy that is something. I look forward to you riding yourself into ecstasy but this is about my rules…though fight to fuck sounds like another delectable possibility.” Tony gave a dangerous noise that made Steve’s stomach flip. “A rough bout to see if you get to ride me or if you have to lay still and
Shaking his head, he felt foolish at how eager he was to find something scary and interesting in his new place.
“One was Taiwan, actually. But I got hold of rumors that it was a movement due from a flu starting in their country and they’re worried about a pandemic. They’re a small country and even though you’ve been a great help, they feared the medicine was to fall in white western hands first and just couldn’t wait for their turn and lose thousands.” Clint started to pick out something from his burrito. “Damn, I told them no cilantro. Gross.”
He had dreams that Captain America would appear in his life, that sweet smile on his face, and ask him to be his partner in taking down all the evil in the world. He gave Tony his own shield and taught him how to be happy and calm. He would put his hand on Tony’s head, ruffle up his dark hair, and call him the best guy in the world. A hero.
“Y-Yes. Please…please. I want your babies. Please.” Steve was so close to sobbing. “Fill me up, make me swell like you want...please put a baby in me.”
“Why didn’t you show me this before? I mean, yes, I get the fear of weapons and what not but still…this…” Steve looked around, “this looks like it is so vital to who you are…an important piece of you.”
Men and women tended to their work every day till dusk, then families would spend time within their homes, while friends met on the streets or indoors given the temperament of nature. Sundays were days off for most and usually when the townsfolk met up for gatherings or meetings.
"We don't need two moronic bulks like you rattling the whole Tower. Sit your fine thighs down and shut-up."
“If you approach it cautiously, having Steve help with figuring this out may be beneficial for you both. He’s smart.” Bruce noted.
A ding resonated in his head. They had passed level three. He checked his watch. Only eight seconds had passed since he last looked at its face. He could have sworn it had been thirty minutes.
“Then instead of hiding it just slowly feed him the information with your control. That way the fallout will be a little less extreme when he officially finds out what you’re hiding from him.”
Warning: The Avengers, Tony in particular, will start showing more of their amoral side soon. In this chapter, Tony gets rather creepy. What he does is presented in a slightly "acceptable" way because he and his group believe it is acceptable. Power gets the best things, and they are basically the ultimate power. He is possessive and has open conversations about owning people, possessing them, and sex without too much consideration for the other party.
“It won’t be any time soon if you keep using your big, grabby hands on my darling sweetheart! Put him down!” Tony ordered.
“That’s just…dude, that’s the coolest thing I’ve ever heard.” He threw his hands up and more burrito particles flew everywhere. “That’s like the ultimate sex-story! Even if I went out right now and slept with three aliens and a humanoid platypus I couldn’t defeat that. Jeeze,
“Useful.” Steve came in. “Friendly. I think I got everything necessary. It all should be ready for pick-up soon.”
Tony grinned. He loved that his Steve was a brat. “Don’t rub it in. Journalist and the paparazzi…all sorts of annoying pricks tend to pop out from time to time and I’d rather not have your first time out where we have to stop every fifteen minutes to avoid cameras. Give me time to pick out places and make arrangements so we don’t have much interference. Can you wait just a little longer?”
“Why am I not surprised to hear you dreading that? Yeah, you’re going to get along perfectly with Banner. We may need to keep you two apart so you don’t slither off to do introvert things like drink tea or watch cat videos or something equally soft and boring.”
His stomach jumped when the calloused fingertips pressed up against skin and roamed over the numbers as if absorbing something from a holy text. Tony's hands were warm and were unsettling, tickling with some sort of promise of gentleness and power, and Steve found himself frozen again.
He gave her a kiss on the head and brought her downstairs for breakfast.  The windows were open and a breeze from the lake blew in. In a matter of hours their yard would be filled with squeals and smell of burning wood and food as the Avengers came over for a visit and celebration as Peter was in from college.
“I can give you anything with this.” He pressed the tip of his fingers against Steve’s lower stomach. “You can carry my children. Just a small flick and you will have a womb because I willed it to be.”
“Funny, isn’t it? The old man was pleasantly surprised when I got them tamed.” His fingers gently caressed the golden stone, the mind stone, and smile to himself. It was nothing compared to Steve’s locks. “Took some years, but I made them mine.”
“Then we won’t talk about that part any more. As you said, he’s dead and you’re here with me,” he finished and sighed longingly. Another thing his old man lost that Tony gained. “You can keep asking about them, especially her. I don’t get to remember her enough.”
His tongue pushed and dominated throughout Steve’s mouth. It did not wait for Steve’s own to join in on the dance as Tony continued to coax Steve into some sort of submission.
Steve wasn’t. Not really. In a business meeting it did not really make sense for Steve to sit so close. He gulped as he looked around at the set up and felt like he was in a throne room. “I don't know. I guess I’m a bit nervous. This is a new step after all.”
“You can control a lot of things, Tony, but I think you have your work cut out for you in trying to control Captain America.” Bruce sipped on his own coffee, a small smile on his face, “He has a stubborn streak.”
He pulled back, getting light-headed again, gasping for air and blinking stars away. Tony laughed, and nipped his jaw and then neck. “We’re going to need to get you some more practice.”
“Yeah, well, I don’t always take orders well. Besides, I…well, really liked Lord of the Rings.” He swallowed thickly.
"You don't know." Tony's voice was low as he approached even closer, his heat pushing into Steve's space. "Because you squash it down to protect everyone. Let me tell you this, the people out there," he pointed to a wall, “governments, the civilians, the fanboys, whatever...that might be good enough for them but it's not for us. It's not for me. People who care about you don't want Captain America. And I'm not accepting Captain America anymore. Give me Steve Rogers, now, or get the fuck out."
This was his. Thanos already saw everything else. This belonged to him. Thanos couldn't have it. He couldn't have Steve.
“Only that there are few things to be aware of before you meet the gang. One, everything is possible. Everything. I know you’ve seen things that may defy explanation but you have not seen the tip of the iceberg.” She paused and gave him a look. “Was that insensitive?”
"Yeah, sure, whatever. Tell the old man I'll be there shortly." He went back to fixing himself up. He was already in the middle of a shave, he wasn't about to start because grape-face (still needed a new name) decided now was the time to walk down memory lane.
“I have to agree with the adult in the room.” Tony picked himself up to his feet and walked around the desk. “I want to ensure that there is no issues with the plan and with what is necessary for the Accords.”
“No murderous war path.” She teased. “Hopefully you’re killing days are over and you can start to live more domestic.”
“Not my fault if you jumped to conclusions on your own.” He winced when he was pressed harder against the desk.
He closed his eyes and lost count of his pushups. He remembered how warm it felt against his fingertips and how haunting and heavy it looked on a living body, a doorway into something intimate and delicate and so broken. It was so familiar to Steve.
Steve angled his head, allowing Tony to take the lead, and sighed dreamily against the dominating lips. He had to break off to laugh a little when Tony began to push him against a wall, clearly ready to start something.
In the spring and summer, it was probably a beautiful, if still intimidating, sight. The whole scene looked like something out of an old children’s fairytale. Though some cracked windows and holes here and there made it feel a bit more foreboding than cheerful. Still, it was everything his mother would have loved.
‘Does Tony’s heart feel like this?’ Steve wondered absentmindedly as he felt the muscles in his arms finally start to burn. He remembered the arc glowing from tanned skin. How, when removed, it would leave a perfect gaping hole into himself. That it was impossible to forget, that emptiness was so heavy, and it was so tender it could break at any second and bring the whole body down with it.
“You did ask me to give him gray hairs.” Steve hummed and went back to smiling at Bruce. “Apparently you and I are not allowed to go off alone together. We’re going to hide away and be boring.”
“Yes, sir.” He nodded and jumped down. “Plenty of food to make it to the weekend. I only got the basic needs in regards to patching up the home. I won’t know what I need exactly until I start working.”
It was beautiful and Steve decided he would try his very best to love the home for her. It was more than he could ever ask for his own. He should show his gratefulness for a roof over his head despite all the trouble that has befallen on all of them.
“You’re still strong…but you are right. Your species and aging are different than my own.” Thanos nodded to himself and then held his hand out, he barely made a grunt of pain using an arm melted into gold, and the air glowed green. After a moment he snapped and Tony coughed, a pressure in his chest, before he staggered back and then his vision cleared.
“Wanda did?” Natasha looked him over and nodded. “Yes, you do look a bit unassuming and kind. Still surprising, she can be a bit shy.”
She tried to sound cruel, asking for something he couldn’t, truly, provide but he heard the hurt hope in there nonetheless. Poor thing. He couldn’t help but feel pity for her…their father was a hopeless asshole to toss their sister down to her death in such a heartless way.
“I don’t doubt that.” Once again Tony’s hand was back in Steve’s hair. “Yes, it needs the ability to sort of pop out under the right treatment so we can make contact with the insides. I get it checked up about four times a year as a precaution and I give it an update about every two years.”
As he was, he could pin Steve down...make him do whatever Tony wanted, make him suffer and beg for more...
Steve held up his hands in instant surrender, “Don’t want that. I just mean, I look a bit more warrior like…so…where is the cute?”
Tony ground his hips roughly against Steve’s refusing to release his lover until his jaw began to ache. He started to focus on thrusting against Steve whose head was thrashing back and forth, his expression showing something close to pain. It was such beautiful suffering.
“Yes. He was in a room, not sure which one, and he had filled the walls with scribbles. Some were Anthony’s name written over and over again. Others said something about Iron.”
He pulled out his pipe, tapping its side as if he were more interested in it than Steve. “Good. Now, I do believe most all of us are finished. See to the cleanup and get started for the day.” Pierce scowled as he picked himself up. “So hard to stay up to date without the paper.”
Steve blushed, Tony could tell as he tilted his head in a certain way and peeked out from under his lashes. “You really need to stop flirting. What will your future wife say?”
“Sir, the schedule has been updated. You’ll meet with SHIELD at 8am on Thursday while that evening you plan on attacking, kidnapping, interrogating while filming the possible traitors to your rule. I will remind you Saturday to send a birthday wish to Abby along with her toys.” Jarvis updated.
“Yep, yep.” Clint hummed as he played with the camera set-up that was a few feet across from the drains. “They’re in the back, howling. It’s so annoying. Bruce had to leave. You know he doesn’t like people crying.”
“I…no sir, sorry, sir.” Steve sighed. “I made it to five places to procure the necessary items. Also made conversation with a farmer--”
“The universe is rarely so lazy.” Tony countered. “I live in this world, the other, and in-between…I know how humans like to romanticize fate but it does exist. And fate, without doubt, brought you to me.”
“No way.” Tony breathed out. His nerves were jingling and he felt a big grin coming over his face like he was a child on Christmas morning. To think there was something about Steve he did not know. To think he was probably one of the
“Ok, Jarvis,” he had to turn his eyes away from Steve’s prone form or he'd never blink again, “read back to me Steve’s schedule.”
Now Steve had to roll his eyes. He could only hold back on his temper and prayers for patience’s for so long. “Ask me not to play coy and I’ll ask you not to play stupid.”
There were still many pieces to this that were confusing and still in the shadows. It had not been hard to figure out Tony created dangerous things, many people have and do, but other details were out of his comprehension and he still was unsure if he cared enough to know or worry about. Hell, outside of creative shows and movies, Steve had no idea what normal was outside the Tower’s walls. So what could he really compare this craziness to?
Pepper laughed and their glasses chimed together in a toast. “And this is for you, a celebration, for twenty years of hard work. This week has been such a success and I think this is the start of something a little easier for you. Something better. I'm happy for you, Tony.”
“Hmm, so I’ve noticed.” Tony began to nibble at Steve’s neck. “So how were you going to help me with this problem?”
Thanos made a movement that created a sort of rewind situation and Tony found himself forced to rewatch their civil war at least three times until Thanos felt confident he understood the situation.
Steve was tempted to push and make a noise, hell he was tempted to use his strength to spin Tony over and ride him himself to get rid of this desperately empty feeling. But he was also desperate to hear what more Tony wanted. Each and everything out of his mouth made Steve’s eyes roll in pleasure.
“Congrats, Stark. It’s signed and all yours.” Clint whistled and tapped his calloused hands on the thick stacks of papers. “Damn you killed a lot of trees for this.”
Tony moved in front of Steve quickly and gaped at him. He had never heard of this information and he swore he was one of the biggest fanatics of Captain America alive. “
“Mhm,” Tony approached the counter. Steve liked to eat some of his meals standing as he could not sit too much or he grew restless. When he stood he was able to walk, dance, or hop around to burn the constant energy. Tony started to appreciate doing it on occasion to since he sat so much for his work. Though it was annoying when things dripped because he could be a notoriously messy eater. For proof put a pizza in front of him and watch him try to fit the whole thing in his mouth. It drove Pepper insane. “It looks good, babe.”
Hands gripped his chin and he was forced to look back up. “Eye contact is best for conversation, don’t you agree?”
Those thoughts were not accepted. He was not that kind of man. That was Thanos. That was Thanos. That was Thanos.
He had them almost nightly when he was younger and fevers took him. Never quite awake or quite asleep, he’d suffer from hallucinations and noises that felt so real they grained his bones. Had it not been for his mother and her stories to lessen the visions, he would’ve sure gone mad. Or been sent to a sanitarium for relieving of possession. Years of dealing with it helped him mold them from terrors to just gripping nightmares that no longer made him break into screams but huffs of fear and frustration.
His teeth went to the man’s nape, aching to dig into the skin and pin the man back into the mattress and milk all the meek, pathetic noises out of him again. He would need to make a note to record themselves in the future so he could always listen to the mewls Steve made in the midst of painful pleasure.
And Steve did it again and again and again for what was probably a few minutes until he felt his shoulders start to ease a bit in tension.
“There you are, love.” Tony smiled as he came into the hall, playing with his tie. “I wanted to see you before I was off.” He looked around at the photos and then approached Steve. “You looking for Howard?”
Steve handed over the plate and now had a small frown on his face. Clearly, he had wanted to continue the topic of venturing out.
‘Stop it.’ He gritted his teeth as the heat and pressure around his eyes started to build up. ‘Crying is not what I should do. It will not change anything.’ Steve took a quick peek at his companions, hoping they did not catch his moment of weakness. ‘Don’t make it worse than it already is. Just stay calm. Please, just stay calm.’
But now? God, Steve loved having someone else control and take care of him. To have his responsibilities and guilt forced off his shoulders and simply discarded to the side. Tony wasn’t simply letting Steve breathe, but he was taking no pain on himself…something that would’ve triggered Steve’s guilt-complex something fierce.  Instead, it was like Tony could just simply make all things that would hurt Steve disappear.
Tony’s fingers tapped over the desk to a Metallica song. He knew his brain would not let this go for some time, so he needed another project to keep himself under control. It all came back to Steve and what Sam said. “Tell me, you think I should take Steve out? I mean outside?”
Tony rolled over to his side and found it impossible not to let his imagination drift off into happiness; he was in bed, sun peeking through blinds that Steve annoyingly always kept cracked, and he could smell breakfast whiffing throughout the house. The bed still smelled of winter pine and though the mattress was cool there was an indent from where his husband had laid just a short time before. He could feel the sheets pick up and a lump-bug slowly crawl up, her hair tickling his bare stomach, before he grinned and pulled away the sheets with a BOO. Morgan squealed in delight as he picked her up and made her bounce on the bed before he began to blow on her chubby belly.
“The others?” He scoffed, “Please, give yourself some more credit, little one. Though I can admit I am concerned on your fascination with falling into insanity.”
“I was just being a brat trying to get you to pay attention to me and only me.” Tony scowled, “I’m going to kill Fury. And do we still have the time-suits? I might as well go back and kick my own ass.”
“Give it a few more tries and you’ll hit me without that.” She panted, looking at him up and down. “You’re getting me figured out.”
“Yeah, I am. Good shot.” She jumped up, touching her eye. It was incredibly tender. His hit had been perfect. She’d probably have a broken cheek if she hadn’t caught it. “Really good shot. Nice thinking in hitting me when down.”
“Of course not.” She poked his nose with a perfectly manicured nail. “You’re learning a lot from Stark.”
“Stupid bastard. Fine, fine.” Tony grumbled, pushing Steve’s pecs together to be a brat, avoiding a smack from the blond man. “You think you’re ready to handle this?”
“I maladaptive daydream. You know what that means? Basically I have very detailed, vivid, all swallowing daydreams. I create a new reality in my head. And I have daydreamed about you fucking
Sam pocketed the money and continued to share the concerned and sympathetic expression. “I believe something is available. I’ll look into it and let you know once you are in town. Any ideas when that may be?”
There was no smell of mold or dampness. In fact, Steve swore he could almost smell a hearth and metal.
“Best not get used to it but yes, to you Anthony Stark, and your great world domination.” She drank her own champagne.
The basement part of the library was a bit bigger than Steve anticipated. Although he figured a good chunk of the items concerned records and other town-focused historical books, Steve preferred fiction or the history of Europe, China, or India. But beggars could not be choosers and he was certainly a beggar.
Tony looked over and the only “him” he saw was one of his memorable poster of Captain America near his kitchen and looked back to Pepper with a titled brow. She returned his expression with a smug smile, gave a nod, and his cocky face fell. He looked back at the poster then back at her. “What?”
Natasha made a noise of concern but Nebula caught him to ease him to the hard ground. She said some words, but he could hardly hear what she said. His head was ringing while his thoughts were muffled by cotton. It hurt to breathe and think and he just waned Tony.
Tony gave a kiss to Steve’s plump lips, purring, close to forgetting what they were doing. “You sure you need to see this? It may be better to go back to our room and get you all relaxed for tonight.”
. I do not want to break-up with you. There is no impending villainous doom on the way. I have not invented a new ticking time bomb. I’m not sick. No one in the Avengers is sick. You’re not sick…yeah, sorry,” he gave Steve a sheepish smile when an unimpressed frown met him, “I still check your blood and such without permission.”
Presently, for example, Steve was getting dressed in something other than pajamas to meet with a man named Sam to discuss a mentorship. This Sam character took part in a more recent war and knew how to help soldiers returning home and feeling lost.
“Hey, I don’t want to be known as a rat. But…yes. May show how desperate and upset he is if he doesn’t want to come straight to you. You two are close but he feels…” Sam weighed his words carefully. He was a therapist so there was still privacy issues, and simple human respect, concerning Steve and his feelings but Tony’s predicament was unusual to say the least.
“Alright, you’re still keeping too much weight on your upper form.” Natasha noted. “Jump on your toes a bit.”
Steve pulled away, coughing a little, and wiped his mouth, blinking at Tony in some awe. “I…” his throat felt a bit raw, “s-sorry…?”
“True.” Tony read over the files again and groaned. “Ok, he’s hired. But he’s getting an intense interview to make sure he understands he is not here to do anything but heal my Steve.”
Struggling, Steve managed to pull himself up, his legs shaking and his eyes blurry with water, he nodded. “Y-Yes sir.”
Doing his best to not start shaking, Steve looked the strange man over once again. “If you are a figment of my imagination driving me into madness you’re required to tell me.”
It could take Steve two hours, if that, to get to town and back for any chores he was sent for. That, at least, was a blessing.
Sam internally groaned. He could practically feel the power vibrating off of Stark as he entered into the scene. ‘Rogers, you are a traitor leaving me with your murderous boyfriend.’
Steve sighed as Tony was instantly at his side, gripping him tightly to keep him put. “I’m still here, Tony.”
Tony’s interest sparked. He always hated the politicians that swarmed after his father. “No. What did he do?”
When the elevator doors opened, god it had felt like hours, Tony just continued on with the clear purpose to make Steve feel like he didn’t exist.
“You’re ruling the world after threat of slaughter and that’s the best you can come up with?” Her lips curled. “Weak.”
"About...how we met and on the airship," he even looked up at the sky as if he would see it again. "I was wrong. You are a man who will cut the wire."
“Legs open and promising me to be the best spouse or slave or whatnot.” He waved off the vocabulary. “It has worked in my favor…this sort of…dominance I have over the desires of humans. I rarely actually seek it out, as it happens upon me without searching, it just seems to be something your kind expects.”
Steve was unsure how much further he wished to push the conversation. There was something very unsettling with this. It was not uncommon, from what he understood, for the Fae-folk to make deals…it took part in many of their stories. They loved to trick humans and play with phrases to see how far they could get away with.
here. They were going to meet him sooner than later. Probably best not to surprise them with what they, primarily the party here now,” she gave a pointed look to Clint, “may believe is a zombie.”
“Huh.” Well that had been his main path of thinking. The other was…terribly frightening to truly consider. “You were born human?”
Finally, Steve had to voice his concerns, and the self-hatred, to Sam. “I don’t get it. I mean…why does it feel like this?”
“Who knows? Your kind can be very invested in just getting what they want without care of the consequence.”
Tony said nothing as he slammed his body back close to Steve’s own and kissed him with a promise of fulfilling everything Steve could ever want.
“But you’re mine now, baby. That means I can flirt all the time I want.” Tony threw him a charming grin though it fell when his pocket vibrated and he sighed. “That reminds me, love, I’m completing my project tonight.” He commented as he brought out his phone and started texting. “It’s why I’m a bit…out of it. I’ll make it up to you, though.”
Spirits, those eyes…Tony could them the most glorious color he had ever seen. He had always been more partial to red, gold and black but the blue hue of Steve’s eyes were mesmerizing. And carried so many secrets that he was hungry to unravel.
Steve pouted and then flipped off the camera, which made Howard, and Tony, laugh. “How about I say fuck you and we see how that goes over?”
“Now that’s your word, right? Captain America’s word is golden.” Tony’s thumb brushed over Steve’s knuckles. “You gotta keep it and be a shinning example for me.”
“He gave you a fine jaw and shoulders and,” he smiled pleasantly at Tony, “a fondness for facial hair…but looking at this picture, I can say I do see a bit more of her to you.”
“And a warning…” Sam licked his lips, unsure about repeating it, then decided against it. “Anyway, Hammer was in the middle of the room scrawling the words over and over again. His clothes were a mess and ripped. He had scratch marks over his exposed skin and when the people managed to get his shirt off they noticed he had been branded like a horse.”
“Fourteen fucking days and you got him in this state.” A voice, familiar…no, not…yes? Yes, he knew that voice, didn’t he? A wonderful voice. “I should’ve been done sooner…got him away from this place. My lov--”
Tony was panting and there was a small layer of sweat coating his golden skin. His eyes were blown wide and his mouth was pulled back into a hungry grin as he stared Steve down.
Steve started to assist Sam unloading with the luggage. The metal was horrible against his skin and he gritted his teeth to keep a whimper down. Sam gave him a sympathetic look.
“I understand this is difficult for you. But you have made him happier than I have seen in years. That is something no one else has ever been able to do. You being here is important and necessary. Do not fret over something like chores.”
He clung tightly, letting Tony go completely wild and relished in the fact that he was on the receiving end of this.
‘Just a few weeks.’ He told himself, remembering Tony’s promise to take him to see the only remaining person from his old life. ‘I’ll see you soon Peggy.’
Then he knew Dr. Yinsen was right. People unworthy had taken the good in the world; it was being smothered and used so it couldn’t go and find those than needed it most.
“What is going on?” Steve hissed, panic starting to grow in his chest. “What has happened? What…what…”
“Well, you know how us country folk loathe those from the city.” Sam pushed at Steve’s shoulder. “Now don’t interrupt your guide. Here you will mostly find your standard items such as a hammer or such.” He continued to give the man directions around town and pointed out all the locations that would be necessary for Steve to go to.
After Stane’s disappearance the company flourished more than ever. His employees were happy and free to do better work. Weapons were still their primary focus but now there was medical and environmental growth, a focus on healing than just harming. Stark Industries grew twice its size, product, and financial earnings in two years under Tony’s watchful eye and strict, but creative, guidance. It went spectacular for all involved. Although it was never proven, many knew Tony had something to do with Stane leaving and they fawned over him for it.
“Well, with your insecurities and being weak from a fever, I had a feeling you wouldn’t be the one to initiate it.” Tony went on and kissed him again, softer this time, but still holding him in place. “And look, I did it again. And,” his lips met Steve’s once more. “Again. And again. And again.”
“Apologies, we…” The one not holding the food was met with a dagger between the eyes. He collapsed to the ground, not even twitching.
“You have plenty of canned goods, something I’m more used to, but he urged me to try everything fresh.” Steve shrugged. “Took up more time too which was nice.” He shifted a little awkwardly before he started to eat his portion as well. He was trying to keep himself polite but he took massive bites as if each one could be his last.
“Oh, oh right.” Tony continued to smooth his fingers over the man’s forehead as he remembered his father’s notes. After the serum it was like his body’s metabolism broke down three times faster than a normal humans’. Even when Steve was sleeping he was burning more calories than a regular person on a light jog. He was naturally warm person. It also meant he ate like an elephant. Tony made another note to restock their home with more food because who knows what was left after the Avengers made their way through. “What were his injuries?”
Tony stopped typing to dig his hands through hair and keep his throat from raging with screams. “It feels like Steve is always in danger. Yesterday, I worried about him with a toaster.” The man was curious but handled the item easily and without much startled awe. It was just another new thing to learn about and handle. Tony had been a wreck believing Steve would touch it and burn himself or unplug it and electrocute himself dead. His paranoia had earned a look from the man as he ate his toast calmly.
He retched but nothing came out. He felt like his nose was bleeding and his tongue felted coated with the coppery tang, but he could do nothing about it. He was being emptied out as something else, something that slithered like a shadow, filled its place.
Bruce was very relieved. “I’ll stay in the compound and if I can’t make enough headway to your liking I can always travel with the Tesseract and Thor back to Asgard. My studies would be more controlled with Odin’s eyes around but it wouldn’t cause the worst delay.”
Sam really reminded Steve of his old Howling Commandos. There was something bittersweet about that but Steve appreciated it no matter how it probed at his tender, internal wound. He felt like he could talk to the man easily about the things burning in his mind. Even after three days Steve felt emotionally comfortable and eager for their meet-ups.
“How much influence…how much control does this man,” the image froze of Bucky grasping onto Steve, leaning against him, his expression calm in comparison to the ache upon the blond’s. “Have over your bride?”
, the dark-Sherlock/Johnlock anthology. If you enjoy dark tales, in particular from the BBC-Sherlock series, or just beautiful pieces of work please take time to read through their stuff and look into their anthology. Because O-M-G.
“Not Barnes though.” Tony suddenly snapped. “Not that fucking bastard that took you from me. He can suffer…rot in an endless hell for eternity.”
Ignoring it, Steve unloaded the luggage to the front foyer of the home. He kept his head down to not get distracted by the newness of it all. The light was slipping down the horizon and twilight was upon them. There was a chance of more snow throughout the night so they needed everything brought inside beforehand.
“Nu-uh. Someone has to remain firm.” Steve said with a shake of his head. “And, Maria,” he gave her a look with a tilt of his brows, “drop the act. You’re being mean to your dad.”
“Yeah, he left a few hours ago. Went back to the center.” There was a touch of longing there and Tony refused to believe it was for anything other than going out. “It sounds like a pretty interesting place. I hope to visit it.”
“You’re here for the Avengers one.” Natasha hummed on the plush couch, flipping through one of the many tattoo magazines.
“Can’t help that I’m perfect.” Tony kissed him again. “Well, I showed you the biggest piece of the place…everything else should, potentially, be a walk in the park.”
She chuckled and took it. “I’m aware. Captain America. Quite a pleasure to meet you. Though, your resurface has caused a lot of headaches.”
Steve’s face went red and he looked away, shyly peeking at Tony through his lashes like he did in those videos so long ago. “Stop saying stuff like that in front of everyone.”
“Fuck.” He pressed his elbows on the desk and groaned. “I don’t think I’ve felt quite like this before. I just need Steve."
“He can reach about twenty miles an hour here. I suspect if he was able to go straight he could reach thirty.” Sam gave a side-ways stare to his boss. Felt like a good a time as any to breach the uncomfortable territory. “He’s desperate to go outside.”
Tony wanted a daughter. A little princess who would be doated on by her fathers. He still liked the name Morgan, if Pepper would let him have it, but Sarah, after Steve’s mother, sounded just as wonderful.
“Is that so?” Tony tilted his head. “I suppose you are used to fooling those around you, for your own survival of course, can’t be so beautiful and smart. Risk getting,” his leg pressed in between Steve’s and hoisted him up easily,  “caught.”
He knew it was an act of protective love from Nat, but he couldn’t stop trying. Not when it was Tony, his wonderful Tony, who was swept up by that monster.
Grunting, he collapsed on top of his blissed out lover, panting and kissing along his face and neck. He could feel Steve’s release smeared on their skin and loved it. It was silent, save for their hot breath, in the room as they both did their best to try and re-collect themselves.
“Later then.” Tony brushed the concerns away, knowing he had gone too far. “The point is I made this, all of this,” he pointed around them, “to keep people safe.”
The two days Steve remained close to bed Tony was there. Tony was basically everywhere. He was even sleeping with Steve, holding him tight and waking him with tender words when Steve found himself shaking from a non-existent cold and unable to breathe because there were so many things around him.
Tony jerked when the other end came to him. "Whoa, whoa...what the...blood transfusion...you moron you don't just...you're an alien! Who knows what that will do to me! You can't just...you're not...get that fucking thing away from me!"
Liar. Steve was a liar. He wasn't sweet and wonderful. He wasn't good. He was a liar. He chose a murderer. He never listened. He was too prideful and stubborn. He was naive and heroic and stupid and selfless...god, Tony would never not love the man. Never. Steve could betray him a million times over and Tony would always want him. Tony had seen the true goodness in the man, had laughed with the hysterical wit, experience the will to sacrifice anything for others.
Steve shrugged and handed him a plate of fried eggs, hash, and toast. “I guess I slept so much as a child when I was ill that I grew restless. Then when I was slightly healthier and could study I needed to do so real early or real late so I could pick up odd-jobs to help with bills. Then the army trained me to be an early riser. Then the serum happened which gave me far too much energy.”
“I’m going to fuck you on every surface in this Tower anyway. Why not get the lab out of the way?” Tony purred, nipping at Steve’s lip.
At the top, holding up Steve's chest, were just two sets of dates rather than three that followed each line underneath.
"We begin now." And Thanos transferred the box from his good hand and into the gauntlet and the room shined with light and Tony screeched in agony.
“Well,” he licked his lips in nerves. “I can say, honestly, I was not expecting my imagination to answer back.”
“But you might not like it. You’re a giving partner, Steve. Sometimes too giving. You have to let me know what you don’t like.”
“Good, good.” Some of the media still tried to get away by playing him in a darker light. Brave of them, and he did not care to censor much, but he would not risk the chance of Steve misunderstanding something because a moron on the television said something.
“But most everyone else is available. They want to meet you. You think you’re comfortable with that?” He gently grasped Steve’s hand, kissing over the knuckles. “I know you get nervous with people and you were looking forward to tonight--”
“She certainly was intimidating.” Steve laughed as he hopped on the seat next to Sam. “But I did not feel like she was mean. Just wants to be heard, I guess.”
“I didn’t ask for excuses.” Tony lowered his hand. “Get that over here for Steve and drag that trash out. Ensure my knife is clean.”
“Your once toned body round and soft, our baby kicking under the skin,” Tony’s fingers pressed against Steve’s abdomen. “Yes, yes…you so full because of me. Unable to do anything for yourself…depending on me. Fully and completely mine.””
Steve was in awe of all of it. Though Tony was a bit huffy when Steve kept demanding more of the studios Disney and Bluth than anything by Lucas or Spielberg. Steve did not crack on the demand. He was hungry to see more of the animation and how stunning the art was. Steve swore he could watch the one called
“She must’ve sensed we like stories.” He left it at that, as he did not want the girl to get in trouble for giving him information that should not be spoken of. “Also told me she and her brother were new here too. It was a great comfort to hear from her about that and how happy she is. Makes me think it might be possible for myself.”
“I can’t feel my legs.” Steve muttered. As if to prove his point his legs slid off Tony’s hips limply.
“Thought so. It’s good and Tony can’t cook.” She twirled some pasta. “How long you gonna wait till you start asking the important questions?”
“Well, you keep throwing surprises like this in the mix and it’ll be hard for me to resist.” Steve’s fingers trailed over the suit unable to believe it just appeared from nowhere.
“You didn’t,” Steve made a subtle move to step away but stilled again when Tony’s grip tightened and a warning noise escaped his throat, “you didn’t do anything.”
Besides, even if he were not so far out of his element and balance, Steve would feel uncomfortable with Tony. The man was just too good. He was handsome, suave, confident, intelligent, rich, and just an overall generous patient person. It just felt impossible that he was after anything more than Steve’s pleasant, but fake, body.
Tony scoffed, insulted. “I’ll be here. No hands are on this,” he grabbed at Steve’s tummy, close to the golden arc, “without my permission. I’m only allowing this because, unfortunately, you are doing a very beautiful job on my Steve’s skin and I know I cannot talk him out of this…it would suck if he didn’t get to finish it anyway.”
“Oh, I’ll make sure we’ll both win. But isn’t it fun, being chased?” Tony purred and lounged atop of Steve, his body heavy and firm, as if in retaliation to Steve’s sulky question.
He flicked the blade in the air and caught it on the edge of his finger again, “Hate the word minions. I keep thinking of those yellow freaks that sang about bananas. Yeah, even after three hundred years those things are still engrained in my memory.” He shuddered, “What other words are there for these fools? Insects almost sound good enough.”
“Just enjoying the view.” Tony said, looking back at Steve laughing over something Natasha said to Bruce. The other scientist just look flustered, trying to cover the redhead’s mouth and stop whatever perverted nonsense she was spewing. Thor decided to intervene and hold Bruce back, allowing Natasha to continue. Clint was grinning evilly as he leaned over and whispered something, probably inappropriate and meant for a 13-year-old kid, in Steve’s ear which made the young man slug him, grinning from ear to ear.
“Well, that’s a pretty stupid thing.” Steve then cleared his throat, “Sorry, I didn’t mean for it to sound insulting. Just, isn’t that just asking for someone to start snooping?”
There should be something exciting about this move. His mother always wanted to move him out into the countryside and away from the smog and crowded life of the city. But moving was expensive and without connections to anyone, she knew there was too great a chance of drying up all their measly savings and becoming homeless. Something Steve’s health could not withstand. So, they remained within New York, working as housekeepers until her dying day five years prior.
“I think you will see reason, where she didn’t.” Thanos continued in that calm voice as if nothing affected him. “I went about Gamora the wrong way. It will be different with you. Now that I have all the stones…I can do this right.”
He had hoped the further out he moved from New York the easier it would become, but it was still bitter and his eyes felt hot. The longer on the train, the further he was from his life. It had been an ugly, sad life but one he was familiar with. One where he knew how to work with, prepare and knew of the nasty bits. One where he still could be around his mother.
Thor did as asked, laughing as he did so, and pulled the man back up to his feet. He slapped Clint’s back, nearly knocking him back into the floor face-first.
Hopefully I can get a few more chapters in over summer! I am working full time, getting another masters, trying to finish a book, and all sorts of other goals...adulting sucks. I have missed writing these stories so much. I'm going to try and balance it out a bit more.
Steve did as told. He always knew how to react to a command. He found it comforting and he clung to it.
Thanos did not seem upset about the words. He must have grown used to them after their nearly three-hundred years together. "I know you do not care for the use of your memory--"
It tingled something uncomfortable in Steve’s belly but he found he could not push Tony away. Something ignited within him and he felt alive, pleasant, and distracted. He did not want to lose it and he hated himself for clinging so desperately to it. Steve had longed for Bucky's companionship, and occasional ego-busting rescue, but Steve survived without him. It was painful and too hard since the loss but he managed. This with his savior was something completely different. He felt far too dependent on Tony and his tingling touch. It was terrifying.
“They needed a, ah, time-out.” Tony shrugged nonchalantly. “They got a little panicked when I arrived. Were a bit protective when I came for you. I understand, of course, so it is easy to forgive. They just wanted to keep you safe…they just did not do an acceptable job.” His eyes narrowed. “Your weight loss, your fever…you were wailing for me, darling. They needed punished.”
“It was on his lower back. A perfect circle with an unusual symbol within it—supposedly more circles, I believe was said. I’m not sure how it looked in truth, but it was still raw and was bleeding and anyone else that touched it burned too.” Sam’s breath shuddered. “They dragged him out to keep him away from the house, but he escaped and made his way back to the house twice. The last time they found him hanging in the middle of the room he had been found in originally.”
There was something nice about it, he finally settled on the idea, to know there was someone coming back to him and someone Steve would return to. There was stability and comforting. And maybe Sam was right, guilt did not need to chase him away from Tony, there was nowhere and no one else to run to.
He scrubbed his face, hating how steady his fingers were, before he looked out the window into endless space. They hadn't been off this spaceship since the start. Tony rarely saw anyone outside of grape juice (he needed better nicknames--after what was possibly a hundred years the grape thing was stale) and he knew his mind; it was not in a good state.
“I got a message from my little sis yesterday…well a screaming fit.” He sulked. “Apparently doctor confidentiality no longer exists because someone who turns green decided it’d be a great idea to tell her my cholesterol level. Now, if I want to see the rugrats and get cake I have to eat nothing but salad for two weeks.”
“Don’t toddle on getting to it, Steven. We can not be expected to run on such little fumes.” Pierce noted.
“So, no breaking up,” Steve felt himself melt in so much relief from that, “And no one is sick…then what is it?”
“Oh,” his eyes watered. “He has freckles. I never knew. God, oh god, he’s beautiful.” He finally reached up to touch the skin of his face and let out a choked laugh at the contact. His nerves tingled with fire and life. The skin was so soft and smooth. And, he laughed again, squishy. Who could have imagined that Captain America had a bit of a baby-face?
“I have the money to burn.” Tony pointed out. “She’ll have a herd of ponies and an actual castle. We’ll paint the compound pink.”
“I won’t judge you.” Steve smiled softly. “If you need time, you can take it, of course you can. You can tell me in detail when you’re ready.”
Steve made a small choking sound, trying to relax and not get too eager, as he allowed his mouth to pull off and begin to try and follow his instincts of what to do. It felt awkward but relatively pleasant. He enjoyed the sounds Tony made as he experimented with his lips and tongue.
“Good,” Tony fixed his cuffs, preparing for his appearance. “I promised his aunt his grades wouldn’t slip being my intern.”
“So,” Tony started slowly, as if battling with something himself, “what were you showing everyone that got Big Bird choking?”
“He does not seem like the type that will stop.” Bruce noted, trying to keep his voice soft and non-aggressive towards the unstable leader. He knew he was on thin ice and even his close friendship with Tony would not save him from some sort of punishment, especially in concerns with this new obsession. “What exactly is he going to do?”
He just needed to get his body to work and stop burning and tearing apart from the inside. It hurt. It hurt so much. But he could take it, he was a super soldier…others have suffered more; they continue to suffer more.
When people, however, started to search for information on Steve for this gossip columns issues would present themselves. They'd find nothing on the beautiful man which would spark questions. Perhaps Tony should look into faking a birth certificate and past. He’d probably need to use some of S.H.I.E.L.D’s abilities but that could work and no one would ever be the wiser.
Despite the concern of drunken-sickness he could not help but puff out his chest when he noticed even the ever-perfect T’Challa appeared impressed by everything provided. Finally, someone was out sparkling the king's (aggravating, unfair, just plain rude) perfectness.
“That…is…impressive.” Steve tried, with no idea what exactly he was complimenting or talking about. Or what he was talking to.
“That apology cuts more than you throwing cereal at my head.” Bucky grumped, still sitting down as instructed.
“Not this. I know a lot of this comes from me being pushy.” He crossed his arms over his chest, still fighting the itch to lock his pretty boy up and away from the world, even from his friends. It was selfish, and Tony was doing his best to fight the temptation off but the temptation was there nonetheless.
“Not saying you have to do it now.” Sam finally conceded. “I get it. But man, I’ve seen guilt. It sticks for a long time. I just want you to hear that it’s ok. That you’re ok to be ok.”
“Not yet.” Natasha sighed. “Whenever you think he’s done he manages to do something even more stupid.”
The train continued along, taking him away from city life and everything familiar. It felt like it was losing last little bit that he could say was his and comfortable. There would be no more sounds and smells of New York. Instead of thousands of vibrant characters filling cobblestoned streets and seaports, there would be dense woods crackling with too much nothing. No brownstones casting looming shadows. No fish markets. No more walks down familiar alleys. No mother.
“Oh, oh god.” Tony gasped as he slowly approached the sleeping man on the bed. He stumbled, briefly, but managed to make it to the bedside with no other issues. The room smelled of stale medicine and science and for once Tony could not appreciate it. He wanted to smell the soap and sweat and humanity of this creature. This stunning, alive, breathing human. “He’s so young.”
Pulling on a shirt, Tony fixed himself up and smiled down at himself and the fact the shirt barely fit across his chest.  He wondered if this was a problem Steve had. While he hadn't grown as big as his Steve, he was still a bit on the sort of short side (as much as he hated to admit it), his body was, for lack of a better word, buff and toned. Hell, he’d call himself hot as fuck. He wondered how Steve would look at him...he knew the pretty blond had a crush on him on some level; at least had found him attractive which did something amazing for Tony's confidence that someone as beautiful as Steve checked him out often when he was twenty-years his senior.
“Ok, now you sit here, doll.” He patted his hand on a chair that was close to his own, the one directly behind an imposing desk, one that wasn’t quite as big. Tony loved images after all, and Steve sat down as Tony took his own seat. “Comfortable?”
“Hush.” Tony picked himself up, and easily hoisted Steve up as well, cradling him tightly. He quietly snarled, “Looks like someone stopped eating his greens. You’ve lost a lot of weight.”
“So Peggy told me.” Tony titled a brow. “I hear it was mostly just cutsey-stuff. Like things you’d expect from a fourteen-year old these days. Or, you were led off to a dark corner to be ravished." He snorted, not impressed. "Not exactly adult-stuff.”
Swallowing thickly, he held up his hand before him, fingers gently moving and…smoke, a soft glow, and…
Finally, the button and zipper were taken care of but he was unsure what to do at that point. He paused seeing the dangerous dip of Tony’s hips peeking through and felt his knees quiver. That little bit of tanned skin was so close…what did he do with it? What was the process to this whole thing?
“Would…oh, no, no,” Tony grabbed his face. “Don’t you fucking dare think about offering yourself for experimentation.”
Tony’s expression was hot and powerful but gentle. It made Steve feel weak in the knees. Tony had always reminded Steve of fire. Something so many tried to tame for their own benefit and who, for the most part, allowed the taming to provide protection and warmth—a light in the darkness of the world. But he also raged and overwhelmed. He burned people easily and could consume life if he so chose (he just had not chosen to, yet). He enveloped Steve, who was always cold and lost in the shadows, in something blinding and hot.
“Oh…oh,” Tony blinked a moment and then threw his head back and laughed. “I’m sorry, doll. I haven’t told you…well, not this you.” He smoothed some gold hair back. “You don’t know anything.”
“Steve.” Tony repeated. “Lovely name. Strong. Means honor and crown, if my memory serves me right…which it typically does.”
“No, no. It was just a little attack. I’m getting through it. It wasn’t the ice or anything like that. Just a random thought that I went a little too deep into. I’m fine now.” He rolled up his sleeves as he gathered the rest of the plates and pans and placed them in the sink. “Let him get ready. He seems a bit busy.”
The air felt so thick in the room. It was hard to breathe. The walls were spinning and it did not smell salty. An ocean smelled salty...
He was rather sure of this fact. Some of his old insecurities tended to poke a few doubtful holes in the idea but Steve could say he was at least eighty-percent sure and those were frightfully good odds in a battle.
“Been considering that, big guy." Oh, he practically dreamt it. The idea of crushing the rebellion in one glorious, explosive go was as tempting as a fat-dripping burger smothered in cheese and bourbon sauce. "But as much as I love showing off my babies,” he licked his lips and thought of his newly completed guns with the molecule collapsing ability and its sleek, compact form. How reloading was slicker than fitting on a condom and he needed to stop before he got a stiffy. Even Tony found it impossible not to be impressed with himself. “I’d like to show the world that this fable land of gods, magic, and technology is mine. That
"A transfer. Some of blood, yes, but mostly of power. A human cannot hold a stone raw. Even without use, the gauntlet will take its toll on you. I am ensuring that there is more for you to use when you take the throne."
On instinct, Steve tried to pull back but Tony’s hand found the back of his head and cradled him, pulling him in close, tilting him around just as Tony wanted and took everything Steve had.
“It…uhm, it was said your parents were desperate for a child and a deal was made…” Steve worried his lips between his teeth. “Are you…I mean, oh fuck, what’s the point of beating around the bush…are you a demon?”
“We’ll visit her this weekend if you want.” He kissed the corner of Steve’s mouth then checked his watch and groaned out a curse. “I’d much rather continue this and I’m sorry I need to break away in the middle of something so important and emotional, but I have to leave.”
Quickly he looked away, unable to keep his vision straight at the sight of those eyes and the dark promises they were giving. “I still think you’re jumping to conclusions.”
“Given our situation, we don’t have much choice do we?” Pierce used his cane to push Steve to the side and give the house a fierce, disgusted stare.
“Ooh, I like that.” Tony grinned. “Let’s also look at getting my initials on him. TS somewhere…ooh maybe his thigh.”
“This man is going to ruin me.” He groaned, rubbing his face and quickly turned from the few of himself to focus on those unfamiliar. Only that search stopped dead when he found someone else familiar and better.
But then the tower shuddered and the large windows out to the New York air exploded in, covering the group in glass.
With a quick stand his knees gave out and he found himself blinking from the floor in surprise. Ok, so he was not as better as he hoped.
“Pepper and Rhodes are begging you to stop.” The former assassin continued. “We can’t lose you on an impossible suicide mission.”
“How many times will I need to knock you out till you stop?” Natasha asked from the shadows, a familiar heavy taser in her hand, her face gaunt but her eyes angry.
“Because, Stark, I’m getting told a lot of really interesting news that, given your current roommate, something you need to hear.”
Tony laughed, “Glad for that. Howard had some ears on him. Stood out with his military cut he kept on him.”
He could still feel the engineer’s fingertips brushing over any piece of Steve that was bare to the world and it had felt like a branding.
“Of course not everyone wishes to sacrifice some of their joys for the sake of others.” Thanos sighed. “If one were to simply look at the grander picture they would understand what is necessary, even if painful, ensures the well-being for others.”
“Steve, when not pulling the coach I tend to the bar. You can find me there if you need any assistance.”
“Just let this happen, baby.” Tony’s lips brushed up against Steve’s once the man relaxed his posture a bit. “It’s so natural. I know you feel a pull to me like I do to you. Don’t hide from it.”
"A transfusion machine. Perhaps we could even call it one of transformation, to be hopeful of its ability."
“He’ll get experience once he gets an A in Lit. I don’t care how dull he finds that class. He doesn’t get to come on these missions when he is a genius and he’s getting Cs on essays.” Tony huffed as he ran a hand through his hair.
Shaken to his core, Steve hurried out of the dark space and back into the main floor of the homestead, heart pounding.
“You’re…not Howard.” Steve tilted his head and he looked him over some more. Eventually the body and eyes of the man became too much so Steve looked around as his lips pulled down. His body jerk and shook. His ears were still ringing from the impact and god, did it make his skin stiff. It was growing progressively more difficult to not scratch as his skin till it bled. There was still that horrendous taste of salt. “What happened? I thought…there was no way to get me.”
‘Picturing it, I suppose I can understand why Sam showed me some sympathy. I must look like a pathetic sight.’ It still filled him with some faith in people to know some were moved by other’s plight.
. We have our date planned but perhaps I can think of something else. We could go to France next month. You were there during the war, but you need to see it now. It is grand. Ah, you also need a gift. Yes, yes. I think I can think of something perfect for you.”
Someone was going to notice so Steve decided to just avoid the avoidance and show off the work the moment he returned to the tower. Besides, he promised Josh to share this as much as he could in hopes more of his team would make an appearance and get this piece of work done as well.
“Howling Commandos.” Steve sulked. “All of them enjoyed pointing out I would mother-hen before I jumped on a tank and then proceed to mother-hen again as I beat someone black and blue.”
Steve kept his face neutral and did not respond. He knew a trap-question when he was presented with one.
Sam did not seem to mind Steve’s poor choice in words but he still gave the lad a stare. “If you know what’s good for you, you will. That place is dangerous business.”
Tony pressed himself close against Steve and stared at the photograph of his mother. “Howard met her in Italy. I think it was seven years after you,” his voice trailed off for a moment and he nuzzled against Steve. “He was on a tour or something. He said it was something to do with a personal project but he was so deep in government at the time who knew what he was really up to.”
Steve, how fragile you are from the get-go. How old you were pretending to be, how unbreakable, when you were so damn terrified and needed someone. You looked at me in hope and I rejected you…and I did it again and again and again.” Tony pressed his head against the skin. “I am so sorry.”
Her viper-like-grin grew, “I think a rib is busted too. Tony, he is brilliant. After beating the crap out of him three rounds he started reading my movements. He started mimicking them. He’s a fighting genius.”
He quickly pulled it back, cradling it to his chest. It tingled and his heart was pounding. It had felt like fingers, larger than his own, had tenderly pressed against the back of his hand, reaching out, about to grab.
Steve tried to gasp, tried to get up—face the unknown voice—but the words slithered into his head and then he was swallowed in blackness.
“I…well,” Tony rubbed his face and tried to keep his panic trembling under control, “shit. That pretty, kind face of yours really hides how scary bright you are.”
‘Finally.’ Steve groaned in victory as Tony tackled him, kissing him painfully. Tony’s canine dragged over his lips trailing away and going for the junction of his neck and bit again, hard. “Oh, god, yeeees…”
Dark moments mentioned or written about ahead. There is brief mention of a miscarriage and of Howard's A+ Parenting . And alluding to torture and enjoyment of it takes place within this chapter. There is humor mixed in with the scene that can be read as funny or disturbing. Perhaps a hint of a corruption of a minor. Please be warned!
Think of this story as some sort of combination of The Woman in Black, Cinderella, the Labyrinth, and Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes (because Victorian-RDJ is a yes). I’m not too sure how else to describe where I got my inspiration from…actually, this story was supposed to be a one-shot and now look at it. I blame those mentioned above. They’re too inspiring for their own good.
“Yeah…very, very small bits of technology that I can control. It’s a bit hard to explain…sort of like mind-control. Well, it is mind-control. I have specialized pieces of technology in the top of my spine, connected to brain stem, and in my arc I am able to truly connect with everything I create and can control and…uh, yeah.” Tony gave Steve a crooked grin, “can we say magic?”
“Yeah. Fucking perfect.” He maneuvered himself above Steve, smirking when the man gave a pained whine at the movement. “You feel amazing.”
“So pretty…so, so pretty.” His fingers moved from the neck and trailed down, now ripping at Steve’s shirt, tossing it aside carelessly. He was just in his underwear and by the look of Tony’s eyes; those were about to be gone as well. “You will look so perfect when you’re pregnant.”
He was not used to feeling so unsure, terrified, and confused. He was disgusted with himself and his skin itched as if it were dirty. The disgust did not help his spiral--it made everything feel worse. It made him feel worse of a person. He was trapped and he had no idea how to get out of it. For the past three days he tried to push his body to the absolute limit, to have it burn and scream in agony, so he had something to distract himself from the bitter need to cry and fall. Something he, Captain America, could never allow himself to do.
An early dinner of spaghetti greeted Tony when he came out of the lab a few hours later. Steve had just finished pouring the sauce over the noodles and sprinkling cheese over the top as he walked into the kitchen.
“It happens. They were not the healthiest couples but he did not insult her or beat her. They slept in separate rooms but ate together at breakfast. Their Christmas gifts were never a surprise or anything standout but never impersonal. They were still able to tease and smile with each other even though I can only count the number of times they kissed on one hand. And mom was ok with that. She had lovers as Howard did. It was never complicated and I think it worked out so well because of that. Really, the only time they ever argued was about me.”
“We don’t know where he is.” Natasha stressed, her hands gripping to the painful alien technology she had to use on Steve six times previously. “Thanos did not take him to this vacation spot Nebula knew of. We have no tracers to locate him in deep space. If they’re even in space with the use of the stones. You haven’t slept well in two weeks. You’re still limping from the last use,” the weapon sparked in warning, “of this. You’re not going.”
“Peter is already practically our son. And if we find a boy that just speaks to us, of course we’ll take him home…but I dunno…even I can say we have enough testosterone in our life. I’d like a little princess.”
Steve walked around the open hallway, eyes upon the simple photographs like he was at a museum. Each one was special, Steve could tell, but there were some that really spoke volumes on what Tony valued.
“That shocked you?” Tony laughed. “I’ve heard I’m frightfully talented kisser but you seem a little too awe-struck. Or,” he poked Steve’s firm stomach. “Was that your first kiss, little virgin?”
. He was bigger than Steve, not much of a feat to be fair, in height and in bulk. Not physically as big as Brock but, heavens, something about him felt massive…bigger than the room. His hair, so dark it was almost black, was longer, curling at his neck, and swept back in a posh style. His face was trimmed in a masculine, artistic beard that highlighted his looks. He was covered in a tailored three-piece suit, a tie as red as blood pressed under his dark vest, with a heavy coat that looked like night that hovered an inch from the ground.
“Indeed! These war games of yours are very entertaining. My involvement is impressing father and many of my followers." His chest puffed out. "Because of this I look to be ruling Asgard very soon.”
Tony paused. It had been a few years since Thanos used that technique on him. Honestly, he was surprised how little Thanos chose to use it.
…fuck, I know this domestic stuff is temporary. Even without the serum, Steve needs to do something. Yes, I tried to fool myself in thinking his art and training will be enough when I know it’s not. But he is not,” Tony snapped, glaring dangerously at his friend, “getting back into the position of soldier. What he sacrificed…the pain he went through…how he was used? No. He’s not doing it again. I will not allow it.”
Something warm pressed against his mouth... no not warm, hot. Searing and powerful. It took away what little breath he had for a moment before it and more was given back to him. His lungs filled with the taste of spice and coffee and…
Tony gritted his teeth, trying to keep himself under control but was losing it swiftly. A tremble quickly took over his body and his skin was burning and his clothes felt far too heavy…Steve looked divine. Tony could feel himself starting to salivate and he was painfully hard.
The piece was incredible, sleek, and powerful. Also, dare he think it, incredibly attractive. The royal red and rich gold painted over metal that looked impossibly thin were bright and eye-catching. A perfect color palette for Tony. “You wear this?”
Tony shook his head and looked over at a table his boyfriend had not been led to, where the lovely star-shield was resting protectively in secret. “I think he believes it was lost. I’m sure he may ask about it eventually…but I don’t think he’s quite ready to let go of the domesticity yet either.”
"You can't transfer power." Tony huffed, not believing himself for a second. Of course Thanos would find a way to do so. Hell, if Tony really thought about it, it seemed do-able from a scientific standpoint as well. Look at Bruce and his Steve. Peter and Strange. There were gateways within an individual that could preform as a highway for transmitting abilities. Much like blood or marrow, the body could very well absorb what was provided and make it into its own.
Steve knew about the Shield family. They were once partners of his employer’s father, Rupert Pierce, and sold their house to him for cheap years prior after some disturbances within the family itself. When Alexander Pierce inherited it there was talk of cleaning it up and selling it for profit but it was truly just a forgotten relic. Now that they needed to start over, it was the only property they had and could afford the upkeep of.
“Now, we all know I need to suffer through meetings and stay in the public eye for a while. I can’t make many obvious moves so I’ll leave all of this to you. It may be a while for all of us to meet up physically. But we all know what we’re doing," he clapped his hands again and grinned. "Now let’s take care of the details so we can enjoy our victory Stark Style.”
Pierce looked thoughtful, “I think it best to stick to the plan for now and fix the rooms first. But do get to work on the kitchen quickly.”
"Yeah, uhm...and this is Natasha's and this is Bruce's. And this...erm," he motioned to the lightening blue stream of numbers? Were they numbers? Maybe...it looked like a weird set of numerical gibberish. "Thor's in his language. The translation was a bit hard to narrow down on earth-day. The one next to it, October 8th, is the closest day we could get. I gave up on the year."
“I’m simple.” Steve confessed. “And a little dense, sure. It does make it a little easier for people to overlook that I’m not stupid.”
Steve did as told, kneeling in front of Tony, reaching up and holding Tony’s face. Tony mimicked the movement right back. For a few moments they just looked at each other, sharing air, and a moment of silence before Tony swooped in and caught Steve’s mouth once more. He pushed his tongue in as his hand went down and rested possessively over the arc.
Tony pouted, “My Steve wasn’t taken care of. I got a little testy. Not my fault. You did electrocute him a few times.”
Though still stubborn about it, and finding it icky to talk about, Tony knew he was who he was because of the help. And he was going to ensure Steve got the same assistance.
"Oh, uhm," Steve frowned. "I am not quite sure. I have three pieces including this one," he lifted up his hand, "but one just...it's something that continues and has many components."
He quickly cleared his throat and looked around. For a panicking moment he thought his eyes were misting up. “Wilson gone?”
"I want you to drop this shield you have. This," Tony's nose scrunched up, "god, you have more armor around you than I do in my suit. Drop it or get out."
Tony was mildly buzzed as he followed Pepper’s directions and went to the staircase to head up to the penthouse. It was not likely she wanted sex, they stopped that well over two years ago, but he certainly would not fight her on it. He could use a good, mindless romp in the bed to close the night for the better. And Pepper was a fine romper.
‘Jesus, Howard, what did you do to him?’ His shoulders sagged and shook his head, disappointed and hurt. It was another thing he wasn’t sure he was ready to face. He had to accept that his once good friend had done wrong to his own son…but Steve also needed to accept he was dating the son of his good friend and Steve was somehow, technically, younger. It caused an anti-logical-headache.
“Not a morning person.” Steve’s lips quirked a bit. “I thought it was notoriously quiet and empty when I woke up. It was because you were in this state?”
“I did.” Lips hit the top of Steve’s head and then he took Steve’s little hand and kissed the back of it. “I don’t go back on my promises. Come along then, dear heart. I believe we have much to converse about.”
Maybe, just maybe, he did owe some gratitude to Nat for stopping him. It was possible if that had hit him in space he would’ve died.
“I could never.” Tony hummed, not at all concerned about Steve’s need to beg for forgiveness. He already knew Steve was sorry, and Tony would punish, he’d punish and punish until Steve knew to never, ever choose someone else again. But this was his sweet, broken soldier…. finally back with him after three hundred years. Punishment could wait. “I adore you.”
“That is one polite way of stating it.” Jarvis piped in. “Others would not be so kind. Most may call him looking quite hobo-like.”
“Not so well." Sam's gapped tooth grin was contagious. "You’re gonna get treated as a whippersnapper. Turn down your damned music, you rascal.”
Tony couldn’t help but laugh a little. It sounded strained but he could appreciate what Jarvis was trying to do. It did little against the truth; he was in something deep with Steve and it constantly burned him alive. It was beautiful and destructive and he wanted more.
“Cilantro tastes like Satan’s piss.” Clint flicked the insulting greenery away. “In regards to their actions I hope you don’t mind but I’ve sent word to a few in my sect to go with some medication to see to this flu and give a very…firm, but not deadly, scolding to select officials.”
“What, ah,” Steve looked at his drink, wondering if he really wanted to know the answer. “What would be in my deal?”
“You’ll also start tattooing me. Steve is not going to be special to you. He’s only special to me…to our family. You’ll tattoo all of the Avengers from now on. Not just Steve. Just Steve is for me only.”
The world was not filthy. Steve, like everyone else had flaws...he was not dirty, he was just human. He needed a conversation, not punishment. He was just a damaged young man. He was just Steve. His Steve.
“Because you’re a man-child who doesn’t want responsibilities.” Bruce laughed when Tony flipped him off. “Maybe Clint’s sister? A fluffy little rescue for the birthday may be really good.”
Tony’s hands tightened over Steve’s. Steve had tried to pull himself back once the craziness started but Tony held on. After a while Steve found he appreciated it, again.
A soft tune from a violin played from a pristine gramophone in the corner; the sound loud and crisp, as if the instrument and player were in the room with the both of them. On a table laid fallen cigarettes, one still smoldering in an ashtray, with a forgotten pipe turned on its side, tobacco spilling out.  The scent of fire and metal were clearer now with a rich aroma of spices layered underneath.
“Yes sir, sorry.” He quickly, quietly, pulled himself up by the driver while giving him an awkward smile in greeting. There were only a few short breaths of waiting before the horses were kicked into gear and they started rolling off.
She held up a finger, “Also, avoid the Human Centipede and the George Clooney Batman. JARVIS, please block these movies and ensure Clint doesn’t ever show Steve anything without permission from actual adults.”
His eyes trailed down to his stomach with hard abs and dark hair before he finaly found the hard member greeting him and nope. Nope. Nope. He was not ready to be a mature, sexy adult about this as his face went neon and his eyes shot to the floor; panicked.
“Just need to remain calm and not worry about it. It’s nothing. It’s nothing. It’s…” he trailed off when he came into the main hall to there was a woman he had never seen before lounging against the elevator’s doors. She was beautiful and lithe, like a dancer, and had red hair and blue eyes that looked sharp and dark. She stared him down without any greeting and it grew uncomfortable and silent for a brief moment.
He smirked. “Not buying it. If I didn’t know you so well I’d think you were seducing me. Which I’m not against falling back in bed with you but I can’t help but feel like I’m being used. CEO sleeping with owner of Stark Industries and current mad-ruler of the world, again, is such a great publicity.”
The genius looked thoughtful. “A week at the very most. I have a big project due tomorrow and some side-ones right after but after that I’ll be able to make the arrangements. I’ll aim sooner for you though.” He smiled. “That an acceptable deal?”
“Don’t care.” Steve wiggled down, getting a little more of a comfortable position. “Could you imagine what the rest would say if you call me that?”
“Right. Again, we’ll play up we’re the good guys here. We’ll let it be known it was an official from the government but not someone who speaks for all the people. This could really tarnish the country’s looks even if it’s some rogue general.” Tony bit his lip and his eyes trailed over to Steve’s monitor again. His heart sped up over the thought of Steve awakening to his country in such turmoil. “Actually, for now, let’s not punish the whole group.”
“I’ll start begging again if that gets you going. “ Steve glared weakly at his lover, “Just move. Please.”
“Same.” Tony grumbled, sucking at Steve’s neck in hopes of leaving a mark. “You’ll have to deal with me on you like this for a bit longer.”
“Regardless. You do need to consider what Mr. Wilson suggested. I think it will be good for you as well. You’ve rarely left the Tower. And besides the party you haven’t done anything fun since your campaign started. A night out would be good for you."
Steve’s fingers twitched, desperate to just try and open the hatch and make a break for the stars, where Tony was. Somewhere.
“Bossy sub. I am going to have so much fun breaking that spirit.” Tony gave a playful growl against Steve’s neck and provided a nip. “That’s not how it works now. You don’t tell me what to do here.”
“Can’t say thinking about it outside of the sex is that attractive. I don’t know how women do it. Ma apparently could barely walk towards the end of her term with me. Her ankles were so swollen.” He winced in some guilt.
"Oh, I think I may need to make you regret that tone." Tony met up roughly as Steve came down, grinning evilly as his lover yelped eagerly, “Well, challenge accepted, babe. Let's see what other kinks we can find to get our motors really running. Come on," he thrust up again, smirking when Steve babbled some lustful nonsense, "get bouncing, darling...show your dom that bad-boy attitude that needs breaking.”
“No, I should’ve shouldered more because I fucking adore you and we were partners and I made you think
—and boy did it work. Tony started working out as well. He fell in love with Bruce Lee and did as much martial arts as he could. He ran and tried weights, wanting to look like someone who earned the right to be next to Captain America.
Steve worried once it was opened and fixed, Pierce would force him to sleep there just out of spite.
He didn’t regret what happened, not in a long shot. That experience…hell, he never knew he could reach such peaks of pleasure. And Tony, the man was heaven sent. The things he did to Steve would happily haunt him for ages to come.
Tony instantly reached out and snapped that hand back, pulling it up to his face and pressing it against his cheek. He sighed in complete relief and ecstasy. Finally. “I have waited for this far too long.”
Attics were tame. They had access to the outside world. There were ways to escape. A basement was a coffin. It was coldness and darkness and nothing.
Steve rolled his eyes and pushed the plate closer to his, still what an unusual word, boyfriend. “More eating and less flirting, please.”
got yourself that. No.” She shrugged as if it were not a big deal. “I’m sorry I didn’t get you a car. I figured with your suit and whole collection of toys you didn’t need another one.”
“Then please start showing it.” Steve wrapped his legs around Tony’s waist. “You said you will put a baby in me. Get to it.”
Perhaps if he played his cards right, he could find a connection in town and earn a job. He could eventually leave the Pierce household and maybe start pocketing money for an actual future for himself.
“Now, I get you back to bed where you are going to rest for a few more days. I’m going to answer any questions about society that I can.” Tony lounged on the couch. “I’m going to feed you, make sure you get a hot bath, and entertain you to the best of my ability. Which, you will soon find, is something I excel at. Who knows?” His bare arm nudged Steve gently. “Maybe I’ll get you to even smile and laugh.”
“Of course not.” Clint looked positively giddy, which appeared odd on his Grumpy-Cat-like face. The man loved gossip almost as much as he loved his family and that was a lot. “I’m so calling you later about this though. You gotta fill me in on everything!”
The grin that crawled up his face was one that would make typical people flinch. He was so happy. Everything felt quite beautiful in the moment. “All that paper...Natasha’s poor koalas.”
“The lining of it is a great piece of work.” His eyes narrowed as he dipped in closer to look at where it connected to tissue. “It looks a little tender around the edges. You remove it?”
“Amazing.” Sam said in all honesty. “The man is amazing. I think next week we can already move on to advance exercises. Probably could already but I agree that two sessions in is too soon. I can tell he's not quite up to normal form. His body is probably still feeling some tenderness from his injuries.” He kept his eyes forward as well. Sam respected the man next to him but he also greatly feared him. “He shows absolutely no sign of physical injuries and his stamina is unbelievable. We’ve been at it today for an hour already and, well, as you can see no sweat.”
With another sigh, Steve took a few more glances over the papers before he folded them up and brought them back to their home. He snooped around the shelves for a bit, searching for history of the town concerning the house, but came up empty-handed. He took it as a sign he needed to finish up his little adventure and focus back on his chores.
“Done sir.” She responded at the ready. “I have a list of seven therapist that seem like a good fit for Mr. Rogers. Please make your selection and I will get him in a session before next week.”
"Hold him steady." Thanos commanded and the binds around Tony tightened, holding him tight and still. "This is not so much blood, my son, as it is for something more vital. More important."
“Hmm, right then,” and then in a flash of movement, Pierce swung his cane out and smacked it brutally against Steve’s left leg.
“Except myself.” Tony noted, barely giving Steve a passing glance as he entered into one of his personal workshops, setting his coffee on a table.
"Ah, a war hero." Thano nodded in approval. "A man who was ready to sacrifice his humanity to become an army for his people and, yet, his humanity is still in tact. Astounding."
. And besides, my way sounds more refined.” Tony teased and bit at Steve’s ear. “And to answer your question, statistically it’s at one-hundred-percent since it’s already happened.” Now, Tony bit at Steve’s shoulder when he was nudged threateningly for being a wise-ass. “Just giving you the honest reaction of a scientist babe.”
“On the third day you wish for his physical training to start. Speaking of which sir, I have picked out an individual I believe perfect for the role as Steve’s mentor during this hard time. I have sent the files to you.”
Every waking moment someone demanded something from him. Someone wanted to use him. Betrayed him. Told him he was nothing more than a villain in the making who was better off dead than anything else.
Kicking himself, he took the broth and took a small sip. Warm but not too hot now. Steve would be fine with it. Taking a slightly larger drink he turned back to his soldier, prying the mouth open slightly and pressed his lips over, slowly pushing the liquid down his throat.
“Uh, yeah.” His blue eyes trailed down, his mouth dry, at the sight of the imposing figure. Holy hell, those thighs…he quickly snapped his sight back to the man, easily pushing his confused lust to the side. “What…what the hell happened?”
It looked like Clint was about to accept the challenge, his eyes lit up of doing something stupid, eager for a fight after seeing Steve’s abilities.
"You know what, Rogers. You," he reached up and poked the younger man's chest, "have been hiding from the team and myself from the start. And, hey, I get it. I do. Probably more than you give me credit for. You're a young guy, you've dealt with some pretty horrible shit in your life and I am sympathetic to it, really. I am. But this front of indifference you put up, this immature gallant of being a hero to try and hide that you're a scared kid has gotten on my last nerve."
A piece of cement fell from the sky and crashed against the street a few yards behind Tony. Steve peeked around and then looked at Tony with a tilted brow and his first crooked smile. "Right. Good place."
With a despondent sigh, Tony reached down to Steve’s ass and gently pushed it open so he could slowly pull himself out. He let out soft pants, trying to will himself not to get turned back on as Steve really needed his rest from his first experience of getting fucked into a bed for hours.
“Well, hopefully I will be able to provide better conversations for you in the near future. If I can make it to the town again soon.”
Steve laughed as Josh walked him through the entirety of the tattoo. Once he was done, Steve had to confirm again that it was perfection. There was no guarantee who would get this imprinted on them (Clint was a safe guess though) but Steve needed it.
“Just be blunt like normal.” Steve comforted. “I think it’ll be easier than you trying to sugarcoat it…you have never been great at that. Just say it and get it over with, please, because this is not enjoyable.”
“Fuck.” Tony snarled and Steve’s hands and shoving them back at the side of his head. “I’m not done.”
The elevator was moving like dripping molasses. His palms felt sweaty and his chest tight, so tight Tony had checked his arc-reactor numerous times to ensure there were no flare-ups. It felt like it was burning and it traveled up his throat and made his tongue itch. Was that normal? That did not feel normal. He hoped he did not have acid-reflux when they finally met. Tony lived off of making impeccable impressions and the present case, in particular, was something that demanded perfection.
Sam needed to do other work but his instructions gave Steve a clear idea on which direction to go to. They parted with a promise for Sam to meet Steve back at the same location they were separating.
“I’m possessive Steve, more so than I have let on. I’d like to let that out. I want to leave marks and bruises so everyone knows your mine.” Tony’s mouth trailed around Steve’s ear, his voice becoming gravely and low. “I want to be a bit unhealthy…I want to control you.”
“Why I'll never be a hero.” He reminded himself as he lounged in his conference chair. "Heroes are nothing more than kindness taken advantage of." His eyes hawked on the video feed of Steve’s room. The Tower felt different already and Steve had only been settled in overnight but it felt complete. Almost domestic…but Tony chalked that bit up to his own romanticisms since Steve was not walking about barefoot and putting his personal mark on the walls yet.
“Get off and maybe we’ll share a conversation about it.” Steve made a move to push Tony off but only managed to accidently grind their hips together again. He winced, shuddering, not used to that sort of stimulus.
“Good passion. I see you are ready for another spar. Hold up your weapon up properly and attack to kill.”
Pepper checked the tablet, “Quite a few though they’re healing decently with our tech assisting him.”
Their breath were getting tighter and louder. The thrusting slightly losing its rhythm, somehow, becoming harder and rougher as the ending drew near. It felt like it was going to be over too soon…but not soon enough. Steve’s vision was murky as he felt hyper-focused on Tony and the pleasure but could not comprehend anything. His mind was shutting down and his skin was prickling with too much intensity and all he could think of was
Still, he only took a few more breaths to calm himself down before he pulled himself out of bed, making it quickly, and opened up his window. Although cold, with a fresh thin layer of powdered of snow now on the land, the air smelled clean and fresh and was necessary to get rid of some of the staleness left in his new quarters. The wind briefly stung his face but Steve found he enjoyed it. He felt some tension start to ease from his shoulders and back and he sighed.
“Tony.” Pepper warned as she came up from behind. She was about to head out to catch up on her sleep and paperwork but had enough time to stop him from doing something cool and stupid.
“I don’t know. But something concerning him changing and then the family just vanished. Then there was this story, no one knows where it came from, of a king with an iron heart who will make any deal for a heavy price.” She licked her lip and fidgeted again. “Do not say that name either.”
