Thankful for rear-wheel drive, Dean backs away from the blast zone and speeds off into the evening. Raindrops on the windshield somehow give way to a cloudless starry sky, like the storm hadn’t happened at all. He can sense the angel’s eyes on him even as he keeps his own on the road.
Warm arms wrapping around his torso rip Dean from his reverie. He sniffles once, sharply, and blinks to clear the moisture that had crept beneath his eyes. Tentatively, Dean returns the embrace, allowing himself to breathe in the comforting, woodsy scent of Cas’s closeness for one calming moment before patting him on the back and shuffling apart. “I, um—”
“Like Anna’s tree,” Dean says, remembering the enormous oak that had sprouted after she had ripped out her grace and fallen.
. But nowadays, staring out at a lecture hall full of what were essentially children, on their own for the first time
As Dean got to his feet, Sam assured her he was fine and that he had no idea what was going on. Stepping closer, Dean realized the burning wreckage wasn’t giving off any heat, nor was the table itself being eaten by the crackling flames. Aside from having been torn asunder, it was completely fine.
He steps into the booth and examines one of the honey jar shelves. Taking his time reading the labels, he considers which would be best for each recipe in his mental menu. A couple standing by the register finish paying for their purchase and leave, freeing up the shopkeeper. “Let me know if I can help you with anything,” he addresses Dean.
Castiel makes a strangled noise. He’s not getting enough oxygen to form words. He shoves his phone at Gabe.
” he thought every time he crunched into something that tasted like it belonged in a lawn mower bag.
“Goodnight, Dean.” Cas steps out into the brisk evening air and climbs into the truck, starting the ignition and idling for a minute to heat the engine. Dean watches from the window and waves when Cas maneuvers out of the parking space and onto the road.
“Don’t be afraid, Dean.” Cas reaches out and pulls the orb against his chest, golden light streaking into his skin and dimming the object’s glow. At the same time, Dean is awed to once again see the shadow of Castiel’s brilliant wings flare out to either side of his trench coat, stretching well past Baby’s trunk and hood.
“Why would the police— Oh.” Castiel suddenly understands Dean’s meaning. “No, I won’t be committing fratricide,” he reassures. “But Gabe shouldn’t be surprised if I dump some Skittles in his M&M bowl next time I visit.”
Moving over to Dean’s bed, Sam pulled the comforter down and to the side, folding it into a triangle in one corner. Thankfully, Dean’s boots were already off, so there wouldn’t need to be any wrangling of feet.
falling into Cas’s side, and Cas has never been happier for the existence of “unfooted birds” or the concept of drunk dialing in his entire life.
Given the time of night and the backwater roads, the speed with which Castiel reaches Dean’s residence feels like a snap of the fingers. From a distance, he notes that the building’s first-floor lights are off and as he pulls in, he finds the Impala parked in its usual place, nothing out of the ordinary there. But when he hops out of the truck, he notices a hunched form curled into the banister at the top of the steps. “Dean?”
As he passes the shopping district downtown, he recalls his earlier conversation with that guy, Dean, about the house he’s renovating. Castiel had only been able to guess about it in the first place because he had noticed the changes to the historic building on his way to and from the market.
“Cas? What are you doin’?!” He almost has to shout to be heard over the wailing wind. The globe of light is so luminous, Dean struggles to keep his eyes from shutting.
Awakening sometime in the pre-dawn hours, Castiel keeps still for a few minutes and listens to the sound of Dean’s breathing, content simply to share this space with him, to feel the rise and fall of his chest and the comfort of his body in this moment. At some point in the last few hours, the heater rattled on in a valiant but ineffective effort to keep the house’s occupants from freezing.
Cas scratches the back of his neck. “I have custody of my nephew, Jack. His mother passed away and my brother is incarcerated. In the immortal words of Gabriel, Luce is
theater. You know, with living people on a stage? Actually, that reminds me. I’m closing up early today to head over there. Tonight is improv night.” He pulls a quarter-folded pamphlet out from his apron and flips it toward Dean between two fingers. “You should go if you want to get a taste of the local flavor.”
Leaning against the doorframe, Dean smiles, remembering when he used to do the same for Sam. It’s funny how the kid who couldn’t even say ‘yellow’ correctly grew up to be a lit geek with a law degree. Makes him wonder what great things Jack will do with his life.
And that’s it. All the memories of what he said come rushing back, and Dean would like to melt into a puddle on the floor and absolutely
A smile ghosts Cas’s lips as he looks up, eyes shining fondly even as he shakes his head. “It’s not. But he’s a good kid. Nothing like his father, thank goodness.”
Mouth formed into a circle of interest, Jack leans forward and onto his tiptoes to peer at the bees trudging slowly past one another. On the other hand, Dean can’t seem to tear his gaze away from Cas, currently distracted by his nephew’s innocent curiosity. When he finally looks up and catches Dean staring, Cas smiles wider.
Dean sounds like a man who isn’t one to accept praise easily, so Castiel doubles down. “The boy with the bloody face wouldn’t agree. You may have been preoccupied, but I saw him. He looked at you like you were a genuine super hero.”
Okay, it’s done. He apologized, said his piece, and admitted he’s the biggest fuckin’ creeper in the entire goddamn world, and now he can leave. If he can ever get his feet to move from where they seem to be cemented to the ground.
.” His voice burned in his throat and it wasn’t from his drink. “I didn’t know which parts of you were which so I just scooped you up and set you free in that field.”
to have feet!” Dean’s yelling, though not into the phone, though his voice does seem to get close to the speaker again at the end of his sentence. Then he grumbles, “Dumbass. What kinda man thinks hummingbirds don’t have fuckin’ feet? What kinda man thinks
Dean closes his eyes, breathing through the dissipating adrenaline. When he opens his eyes once more, Castiel has stepped closer. “Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine,” he says, running a hand across his mouth.
“Is that the titular new hope?” Cas asks, deadpan. Dean gives him a confused look, trying to decide if Cas is pulling his leg or being completely serious. “Careful, Dean. Your face might get stuck that way.”
Castiel looks around. Most of the cars have already taken off and Dean is just kind of...standing there. “Where’d you park?”
Gracefully, Cas lets it slide with a simple, “That would make me very happy,” and another quick peck on the lips before breaking away from Dean to grab their mugs.
“Starting to?” Gabriel casually rocks back and forth in the recliner with his arms crossed, watching Castiel’s dizzying efforts to wear a track into the carpet.
The days were dragging themselves out as the Winchesters continued searching for the far-flung ingredients they’d need for the summoning. Progress was slow, so Dean had insisted they keep up with saving people in the meantime. In fact, he’d been running himself ragged with it, but he needed to feel useful in the times when he wasn’t getting any closer to finding Castiel.
Dean slams his eyes shut and cringes so hard, he thinks his soul might leave his body. “Can we just never talk about that phone call again?” he groans.
Dean heard the room key slide into the door and quickly ended his call. “Crap, Sam’s back. Bye, Cas. I— I love you.”
It’s like the clouds part when those eyes smile. Cas abandons his flowery yellow mug and reaches for the carafe. “The only thing I need you to do…”
Castiel looks up to find Dean’s green-eyed gaze staring intently back and a warm smile spreads across Dean’s face. “Then you’re just where you need to be.”
“They wiggle their abdomens to point the rest of the hive in the direction of the best flowers. Then they loop around and do it again to ensure the message gets across,” Castiel continues, drawing a circle in the air as he explains.
There are about a million more questions on Dean’s mind, but as the purr of the engine fades, the boy yawns, and Dean finds himself staring into a pair of deep sea blue eyes a few shades darker than Cas’s. The kid extends both arms, fingers flexing in a grabby motion. “What? You want me to pick you up?”
intimate, and it gives Cas a burst of confidence that he may never have been able to find otherwise.
Several minutes later, as he reaches into the pastry case to retrieve part of an order, a tiny face appears on the other side of the glass, nose and hands smooshed hard enough to leave smudges. Good thing the shop is stocked on glass cleaner. Dean laughs as he stands, glancing over to see Gabe having joined Cas by the window. “Hey, Jack. How ya doin’, munchkin?”
Cas runs his fingers through Dean’s bed-fluffed hair and down the side of his face to softly cup his jaw. “You should probably eat and get dressed. I have a surprise for you.”
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Castiel smiles, turning to Dean and gesturing at the cake. “Does that need to be refrigerated?”
Sighing, Dean pushes off from the wall, his fists balled tightly. He won’t meet Castiel’s eyes. “My father.”
Adjusting the cant of his body, Cas slides his other arm around Dean’s neck and palms at the space where the short brown hairs start, guiding him forward like a flower to the sun. Their mouths drink each other in, a prophylactic against the oppressive harshness of winter.
“Hebrew,” Castiel explains and Dean’s fantasy evaporates. “My parents were crazy religious. All my siblings got angelic names. Mine just happens to be one of the more unusual ones.” He sighs as if recalling an unhappy memory, but doesn’t elaborate.
The apple seller is using an industrial-sized broom to push piles of broken glass into a dustbin. The man who sold Dean his wooden pipe shelves is busy installing replacements into the wall. The bartender from improv night—Simon, Dean recalls—is scrubbing away the graffiti with a paint thinning solution. Even Gabe is there with Jack, keeping the little one well away from anything sharp and chatting the ear off an attractive young woman in overalls who is chipping away at the broken subway tile before applying and grouting new pieces.
Castiel huffed a bittersweet laugh and handed Dean a cup of water that had been sitting in waiting nearby. Dean gulped it down gratefully.
Cas tilts his head to one side, visibly intrigued at the package. He pops the top off the container and finds a sliver of pie, still steaming in the autumn air, and a disposable fork. “You have my attention.”
Cas touches a finger to his own temple. “Yes. Angel radio. The telepathic bond with the Host starts at creation, though his range is currently limited.” He raises his eyes to the ceiling, considering. “More like...angel walkie-talkie.”
The two players nod and take their places in the chairs, the ‘annoying’ person reaching into a different box to draw out their trait. As the skit plays out on stage, Dean steals a sideways glance at Cas, whose nose scrunches in laughter.
out of you. I mean, you already know I find you super attractive, so I think dating you is the next logical step.”
Jack peers around Castiel’s other leg and takes in the sight of the Impala, eyes going wide at the goofy shape of his face mirrored in the shiny chrome hubcaps and accents. He nods to Dean, who straightens upright again.
A selfish part of him wanted to bask in satisfaction that Castiel had gotten a taste of his own medicine, but he kept that cruel thought to himself. Cas was back and that was all that mattered. “Yeah, well, no harm, no foul, right? How long was I out?” he asked, not even knowing what time it was.
“Jeez. You hide it well, but you need to lay off the burgers and pies, man,” Sam muttered as he caught his breath and stood up straight. Dean barely flinched at the relocation, the only indication he was even alive being the steady rise and fall of his chest.
Dean fiddled with the hem of his henley. They’d just gotten back from their trip across the world and, while he wasn’t a fan of the seasickness—or the land sickness that had followed, Dean knew he’d go anywhere with Castiel if given the chance.
“You are absolutely the least fun best friend in all existence and I hope you know that,” Charlie huffs, rolling her eyes as she heads toward the edge of the parking lot where Dean always parks Baby. He isn’t taking any chances with these hooligans scratching her paint, okay? She is as far out of harm’s way as she can get without Dean just leaving her at home, and he will walk the extra five minutes out of the way if it keeps her that way.
But something nags at him as he stares down at his flour-coated hands rolling fresh dough. In fact, he doesn’t notice how absorbed he is in the thought until Cas walks through the door and it strikes him that he’s finished preparing the pastries for the next day, placed them on their designated overnight racks, and washed his hands clean without even realizing his evening tasks are complete. He’d been on autopilot.
In a way that he really doesn’t want to analyze right now, he wishes the hand were still there. Imagines weaving his fingers through Cas’s. What the texture of Cas’s knuckles would feel like beneath his palm.
The second photo is of Dean, Cas, and Jack on the couch, Dean tickling Jack’s “burri-toes” poking out from the tortilla blanket, the rest of Jack’s body a blur of flailing limbs. Closest to the camera, Cas’s eyes are almost closed from laughing so hard, trying to hold still enough to take the selfie with Jack’s body leaning into him to escape the tickles.
“What?” Cas asks with a laugh, leaning his head to one side like a confused puppy. “Is there something on my face?”
Reaching the opposite row, the dancers kick-stomp-kick twice and spin on their heels to face their partners. Dean catches Cas’s eyes again and smiles. Cas gives an embarrassed fraction of a smile back and ducks his head.
All the blood from Castiel’s pounding heart pools in his cheeks. He’s starting to think his brother might be onto something, but he’s not about to ruin the moment by guessing incorrectly.
Dean leans in and rests an ear on Cas’s shoulder, his nose tucked into the curve of his neck. He sighs softly, feeling some of the weight of his mind siphoned away by the hands around his waist. Reluctant to leave the embrace, he pulls his head back to face his boyfriend.
“With our powers combined…” Dean leans in like he expects Castiel to finish the sentence, but he’s met with cluelessness. “You telling me that Mr. Environment here isn’t a
“He didn’t even address the stupid thing you sent and his last two texts seemed really out of place and upset. I have no idea where that came from and now he’s not responding at all.”
Instead, he clears his throat, excusing himself from the intensity of the moment and the enormity of his emotions by turning back to the steering wheel and putting the car into reverse.
“It’s a small town and I’ve met a lot of people through the market. When I began texting early this morning to put feelers out on who might be able to help, I didn’t expect such an immediate response, but good things do happen sometimes. So...surprise!” Cas exclaims with jazz hands.
“As a kid, Sammy had a lot of nightmares. He’d wake up crying, thinking he was alone. On the bad nights when Dad was dead to the world, I’d take Sam outside and park him on whatever chair or stoop was there and we’d practice finding the constellations.” Dean pauses, lifting red-rimmed eyes toward the cloudy, moonlit sky. His face is dry, but salty tracks stain his cheeks, giving him away.
“You’ll want to turn on your phone light. Mine’s down for the count and the lights are out on the bottom floor.”
“If you show up at noon, that should be plenty of time. I’ll text you the address when I get home. Text me something now so I don’t forget?”
There was a rustling sound followed by a thud and a groan. Dean blinked the stars out of his eyes and tried to focus on the distorted figure in front of him.
“Nerf herder.” Cas launches an arm at Dean’s ribs for more tickling at the dig, but Dean catches his wrist mid-flight and holds it.
“Oh, right,” he mutters, smacking his lips together to get his mouth working, if not his mind. It’s too late—early?—to form coherent thoughts, such as how he should’ve trimmed the tree outside the guest room so that it doesn’t scratch at the window with its bare branches and scare a sleeping child. But something he knows more instinctually, on a subconscious level, is that he loves this kid as much as he loves his uncle and never wants Jack to feel afraid. “Yeah, sure. Get up here.”
For as often as Dean’s imagined this scenario, he never thought it would actually happen. Not on a decrepit bench on the outskirts of some hick town. Not when neither of them are about to die. And certainly not with their adopted angel kid sleeping in the crappy motel room behind them. But now that it’s here, emergency flood lamps popping whenever Dean nips at Cas’s lower lip or runs his fingers into the dark tendrils of his hair, Dean can’t imagine it any other way.
Dean wasn’t intimidated. Hungover Dean drops his head into his hands and sighs so deeply, he sort of feels like the life force is being let out of his body.
“Y-you have kids?” Dean splutters but recovers. How many times is Cas gonna surprise him in one night?
“Don’t worry about it,” Gabriel says, silently acknowledging the irony in telling his little brother The Drama Queen not to worry when that’s one of his defining traits. “Just don’t be surprised to find an on-demand movie charged to your account next month!”
, which I suspect is the case, you should know by now how I feel about you.” Cas surveys the landscape of Dean’s eyes for understanding. “I want to show you the same goodness you’ve shown me. Because you are worth more than you give yourself credit for.”
Jack clings to Dean’s back, legs wrapped around his waist and arms grasped at his neck. Dean, in turn, has a firm grip on Jack’s legs to ensure stability as he runs them around in rapid zigzags and loose circles, eliciting squeals of joy from Jack followed by giggles from the both of them. When Dean slows to reorient himself, Jack squirms and shouts, “Do it again!”
But Castiel is just as stubborn and he’ll be damned if he’s going to let the best friend he’s ever had accept responsibility for something fully outside of his control.
He lunges and Castiel is too slow to stop him. Gabriel swipes the phone out of Castiel’s hands and makes a run for it.
“Both are good choices. Either one means we’ll need more movie nights to finish the series,” Dean winks. Cas gives him a pitiful help-me-out-here face and digs his spoon into the ice cream and pie. “You already know how Lord of the Rings ends, so let’s introduce you to a whole new galaxy,” Dean decides, holding up the remote and selecting the movie from his playlist.
“Oh, well, I uh— thought I’d come back for a few more bottles of that cinnamon honey. I used it to test out a mini pie last night and ended up eating the whole thing myself. Soooo I’m gonna need a bunch if it’s going to be part of my best seller.”
Sitting beside the motel room door on a battered bench with chipped white paint, Dean studies the dark screen on his phone as if it holds the answers to how the hell he’s going to make this thing work. He’d been putting on his game face for Cas, but now that he’s stopped moving, reality starts to settle in.
“Holy—!” Dean slams on the brakes. They hydroplane for a few heartstopping seconds, wheels locked and sliding on the slick blacktop, before coming to a stop with one tire half dangling over the newly formed pit. Still trying to catch his breath from the adrenaline rush, Dean’s panic rises as he watches Cas open his door and step out. The rain continues pelting them from all around, oblivious to the angel’s agenda.
“Friggin’ vampire shoved me into this nasty metal spike. Coulda been real bad, but it took a chunk of my shoulder instead of somewhere vital.”
Gabriel, in an unnatural fit of agility, launches himself over the kitchen counter as he answers the phone.
Despite the haze of post-hormone sleepiness, Dean marvels at how Cas managed to spin the evening into a complete 180. He buries his face in Cas’s hair, inhaling the natural scent. Somehow, even sweaty Cas smells good.
“You really think you’d be up for hosting the chaos that is a four-year-old in a new environment? You’re a braver man than most,” Cas jokes.
Everything in Dean wants to shut down, to black out, to pinch himself so hard he wakes up. The logical part of him says he needs to leave and call the cops. But the impulsive fight-not-flight side of his brain, the one honed by years of lessons learned from his father’s impromptu training sessions (usually after John had gone down in a match, tipped up the bottle, and dragged Dean into the empty ring to teach him how to defend himself and his brother) spurs him to draw the knife from his back pocket and scope out the battered remains of his new home.
Castiel nods, considering Dean’s words and what they mean for the struggles Dean must have gone through growing up. Dean talks like someone who had to learn parenting far too young, and not in the oops-I-knocked-up-my-girlfriend kind of way. Even though Castiel never found himself without food or shelter as a child, he understands the importance of home. “I want to make sure he feels like he always has a place where he belongs. A family who loves him.”
The floor is littered with scraps of wrapping paper from Jack tearing into his presents: a suspiciously on the nose dinosaur plushie and a pair of multicolored light-up sneakers from Gabriel (“No, I didn’t
Dean shrugs. “I mighta been young myself, but I practically raised my brother so I’ve had experience entertaining a toddler. I’d rather deal with that chaos in my own environment than some random motel room in the middle of nowhere.” At the inquisitive tilt of Cas’s head, Dean adds, “Our dad moved us around a lot for work after mom died.”
They’re both silent for a moment before Cas’s brain catches up with reality, and he clears his throat and takes a couple quick steps back. And then remembers to drop Dean’s hand. Dean lets out a laugh that sounds half hysterical and it almost seems like his cheeks flush even
Dean only had a few minutes to talk in between one self-appointed mission and the next, but given the significance of the date, he desperately needed to hear Castiel’s voice. He knew it would give him the encouragement to keep burning both ends of the proverbial candle, even as worn out as he was.
With a flutter of his robe, coffee cup clutched in one hand and bedhead unperturbed, Cas moves to inspect the job Jack has done so far. “Yep. Nice work. What do we need to do next?”
Dean rolled onto his side, facing the backrest, and let the phone hit the floor as he slipped into what he hoped would be a dreamless oblivion.
When Dean glances up, Cas smiles—one of those rare, full smiles—and damn if that doesn’t make his stomach flip. He reaches into his front pocket for the room key but struggles to dig it out, prioritizing the weight in his arms.
“Nuh uh. My turn.” Dean leaned in, pressed his lips against the cusp of Castiel’s ear, and pulled him closer. He was done waiting.
For the third time in the same week, Dean walks into the honey stand. He gives a little wave and saunters over to the counter when Cas sees him.
Cas smirks. “What’s important is which uncle. If I keep using Gabriel as a babysitter, his influence will make sure I never survive Jack’s high school years.”
They stare at each other for a few moments before Cas leans in and gently presses his lips to Dean’s, his eyes sliding closed. Dean lets out such a deep sigh, something that sounds like it came all the way from his
At first, Dean’s sleep-addled brain transports him back in time to a motel room on the other side of the country, to a night where his baby brother had been spooked by the sounds of police breaking into an adjacent room, probably in a drug bust. “Sure, Sammy,” he slurs, drunk on dreams.
Dean knows he hasn’t been the most subtle, but he can’t help himself. Neither of them had grown up with much of a happy upbringing, so seeing Cas blissfully in his element and acting as a positive parental figure to Jack is something Dean wants to savor. It doesn’t hurt that the beekeeper is easy on the eyes.
“Cartoons aren’t always educational, Cas. Sometimes, kids just wanna laugh at fart jokes and explosions.”
By the time Castiel gets home, it’s well past 10 p.m. He navigates the pickup down the well-tread dirt drive and parks it beside the large maple tree in front of the squat, single-story farmhouse. Twirling his keyring around one finger, Castiel hums the chorus of the song that had just been playing on the truck’s radio as he makes his way to the front door. With a metal-on-metal click, he unlocks the deadbolt and pushes his way inside where warm kitchen lights greet his entry. He finds Gabriel sitting with his legs propped on the quaint dining table, flipping through one of Castiel’s old home decor magazines, Jack having long since been put to bed.
“Are you all ready? Here we go!” Gabriel announces without allowing anyone time to respond. “Just follow my lead as I call out each move.” He gestures to the band and an upbeat country song starts.
Dean reluctantly turns his head back to the TV and starts the movie, forgetting about his slice of pie until the ice cream has turned into a soupy mess.
Jack glances out the window at the blustering darkness. It’s impossible to see more than a few feet past the quartered panes. “Will Nougat be okay?”
for using their mutual inebriation as a means to start a conversation he’d much rather be having sober. Besides, gorgeous or not, Castiel doesn’t feel right listening to someone’s thoughts when they can’t fully consent to him hearing.
But Dean remembers a similar conversation years ago at a park around Halloween. It was the first time he’d gotten a glimpse of the humanity within the divinity, what Naomi dubbed the crack in Castiel’s chassis. It had been a turning point in their relationship.
“ALDON OI NOCO GETA MAHORELA PIADPH,” Sam continued as purple and black smoke erupted from the bowl, spilling over the edges and snaking over to the wall where it was pulled into the design that had started to glow like embers.
Dean groaned at the interruption. How had Gigantor hidden his steps so well? “No one. I’m just on the internet watching cats do stupid things.”
He paused, considering what he really wanted to say. “Honestly, I just hated seeing all the angel shit everywhere. It was like a slap in the face wherever I turned.” It had felt like such a cheap imitation of the real thing and all for the sake of capitalism.
“I invited him over for the party. I hope he doesn’t feel pressured to join but I offered to show him around the apiary since he seemed interested in learning more about the bees.” Mentioning the party, Castiel remembers he was supposed to send Dean his address when he got home. He retrieves and unlocks his phone.
“Yep, that’s me! Just moved in. Name’s Dean.” He extends a hand. “Been doing the reno myself, as I’m sure you can tell by the hot mess that is
Dean snorts and chances an affectionate glance at the Dork of the Lord occupying his passenger seat. “Not what I meant, Bill Nye. It’s just sudden. That’s all.”
Everyone’s lives had been restored just as they had been before the Rapture. People hopped on planes to see loved ones. Friends texted one another. College students crammed for upcoming exams. Businessmen made backroom deals. Children ran around playgrounds. The world went on spinning.
Every time he considered just sending a text or stopping by after office hours, he always managed to talk himself out of it. Like the day when, a few weeks after Dean started, Cas walked by his office and witnessed him comforting a crying Claire Collins, a student he’d had in one of his own classes the year before. Dean’s tone had been so
“...Cas?” Dean’s voice wavers, confused. The moment he gets his nose past the edge of the covers to peek at where Cas had just been standing, he’s pounced on from the other side of the bed. He yelps, thankfully not loud enough to wake Jack down the hall, as he’s pinned by powerful limbs and tickled mercilessly.
If seeing Chaz reach for him was a lightbulb moment for Dean, kissing Cas is like slamming on the stadium lights.
“Some kids over in Tallahassee started getting sick. And not like seasonal flu sick. One day they were fine and the next: comatose. They couldn’t exactly blame it on pneumonia that far south, but it sounded real close to another hunt we worked years ago, so we went to help out. And whaddya know? Shtriga.”
After a few minutes, the perception of being watched has turned into a phantom itch. “What is it, Cas?”
Castiel puts a gentle hand on Dean’s hurt arm and lowers his voice. “Did this happen while you were here? Did someone do this to you?” His hand tightens as he looks Dean up and down in the low light, skimming for further injuries, and his eyes darken with the thought of what he might do to someone who would harm Dean.
“Hey, don’t even start. You’re the one who won’t use the cat bed I bought you.” Nougat gives an indignant chirp as Castiel reaches down to grant a cursory scritch.
“The bees worked hard all summer.” Castiel straightens with pride and Dean sees him turn fondly toward the back wall where a pin board displays pictures of a small ranch, cows, beehives, a greenhouse, and a few indiscernible figures in beekeeping suits.
“Heaven knows that ball of energy doesn’t need any more sugar so close to his birthday, but I’ll bring it home anyway. I swear his first tooth was his sweet tooth.” Cas grins. “That part he definitely gets from Gabe.”
Dean munches on his burger and surveys the area. Up on the stage, a variety of prop boxes rest against the back wall. On the far side, a band is preparing a set of drums, microphones, and a few guitars. Two other microphone stands wait in the center of the stagefront.
He probably could have gotten a few more things done ahead of time, but he’d been preoccupied. Most nights had been spent staying up rather late texting back and forth with Dean about everything from music to memes. Operating on little sleep, his days at the farmer’s market had been more draining than usual, and he’d found himself missing his friend’s sporadic appearances in the shop since Dean had been busy finishing renovations in preparation for the bakery’s upcoming grand opening. The rest of Castiel’s time had, of course, been taken up by caring for and spending time with Jack.
“He has yet to learn how to slip them into the etheric plane. I will guide him, in time.” Cas smooths a few downy feathers along the fledgling’s body, causing the child to stir.
“I suppose you’re right.” Cas reaches a hand toward Chaz, who whines—sounding less like a child and more like microphone feedback, making Dean wince—and hunches further into the fabric den.
The trio continue toward the edge of the lot where the hives are set up amidst even more flower bushes. Castiel has taken the lead now, preferring to be the one to reach the colony first so he can grab the smoker and calm them prior to show-and-tell. But he hasn’t let that stop him from getting a headstart on the
comes, that means he’ll probably bring Jo, and then I can maybe, actually… you know. Make some headway there.”
, making gaga eyes at him while he tried to teach about circuits and theorems? He will very much pass, thank you. He actually fights down a shiver at the thought.
“So was all that talk earlier just to get me to help you navigate the human elements? Because I get needing to work out the logistics, but that’s not cool—”
“I came home to all this.” Dean bows his head as if repentant, restrained but still seething. “Forgot to lock the door. Might as well have left it wide open for those bastards.” He pulls away then, tossing his useless phone onto the countertop and running his good hand through his hair and leaving it there. “I should have fucking known better.”
Castiel takes a long sip from his steaming coffee mug and tries to savor the calm before the storm. He breathes in what should be a refreshing mocha scent but is reminded of the hot cocoa from the other night and how awkward he’d made things between himself and Dean. He scrubs both palms into the grooves beneath his tired eyes and rises from the reclining chair with a yawn.
“Fine, fine!” Gabriel holds up his hands. “Whatever. Just answer it so we can get back to drinking.”
Out on the screened-in porch, Cas removes a kid-sized beekeeping suit from a hanger. He gets Jack situated into it, fastening the zipper before putting the netted hat over the boy’s head and a pair of gloves on his hands. Once Jack is outfitted, he passes one adult suit to Dean and grabs another for himself to don.
The last of the lingering shoppers leaves and Dean checks the clock. “Looks like it’s cleared out just in time for me to close up shop for the lunch hour. Why don’t you guys go make yourselves comfortable and I’ll bring out the snacks.” He looks down at the kid hanging off of him like a monkey. “Jack, you’re with me. You can help pick out the goodies.”
Held secure in the angel’s grasp, Dean closed his eyes and the space between them, parted lips melding into a searing kiss. He poured a dozen years’ worth of yearning and fear and love into the worship of Castiel and to being worshipped in return. Mind, body, and spirit. For a time, they both lost themselves in drinking from an overflowing font of devotion.
He debates how much longer he can reasonably linger in bed when an angry stomach rumble makes up his mind for him. Gathering a blanket around his shoulders like a cape, he traipses out of his room to start the coffee machine.
Jack picks up a few strawberries with his hands and puts them in his mouth at the same time while Cas opens a can of cat food for Nougat. The cat mews with impatience before Cas can get the food into a bowl. Looking over from throwing out the cat food can, Cas finds Jack with another fistful of berries. “Use your fork, please,” Cas requests, moving the paper towel holder onto the table for ease of cleaning the inevitable mess that is a four-year-old at mealtime.
A flash of warmth spreads up the back of Dean’s neck at the praise but he ignores it, burying his doubts.
the guy he’s been infatuated with since his first day at KU. They’d met at a mixer. Bright, wide blue eyes glancing at him from across the room, a smile that crinkled the man’s entire face in the softest, most endearing way Dean had ever seen. Thighs that strained against the material of the jeans he’d been wearing that had haunted Dean’s dreams—and daydreams—ever since.
sound. Dean fakes a gag and pushes her back across the seat, then wipes at his cheek quickly, trying to rub away the spot where her lips touched. Charlie smacks his arm. “Just drive, asshole. Time for drinks!”
“No, it’s really me. Look, I can’t stay long. But Dean, don’t lose faith. Amara and I have roamed through dozens of other dimensions, and we think we’ve found one last workaround to save Castiel. One that the Empty won’t be able to stop.”
He tilted the bottle to his lips again, chugging down three shots in one go. He was so tired of thinking and remembering and feeling. He wanted to be where Castiel was, asleep in some unfathomable darkness. Of course, when Dean slept, that usually brought on the nightmares. In them, Dean waded through an endless sea of black sludge, suffocating as he shouted for his angel.
“You only use me for my brother’s roommate,” he grouses, forehead resting on the steering wheel. It’s an acceptance, and Charlie knows it is.
Dean’s eyes drop down to somewhere near Cas’s chest while he bites his lip again, expression going thoughtful.
“What lesson is this children’s program supposed to teach? There’s no such thing as a ‘weremole.’ And the city they live in doesn’t even exist. It’s not at all practical,” Cas scoffs.
with Cas, hot cocoa had become a tradition on chilly movie nights and tonight is no exception. Dean hopes they don’t lose power. The meteorologist had forecast quite the blizzard ahead of them, which can already be heard picking up steam beyond the shuttered kitchen windows.
Soon, they’re all seated and munching happily on an assortment of cake, cookies, and of course pie. The taste of cherry pie filling brings up a memory of Dean’s summers on the road when he’d pick up cheap gas station hand pies just for the nostalgia of his mother’s cooking. Chewing on oatmeal raisin gets Sam to talk of helping his girlfriend with a bake sale on campus. A bite of lemon meringue inspires Cas’s thought of someday visiting France. Around and around the table, they trade stories.
Cas is doing his best to perform the moves correctly, staring at the ground as if imagining where his foot will go next. His tongue is sticking part way out of his mouth in an endearing act of concentration. But as Dean gets closer, Cas makes the mistake of watching Dean’s oncoming feet instead of focusing on his own. By the time they are at the point of passing one another, Cas trips over his own shoes and stumbles sideways, nearly colliding with Dean’s shoulder and cursing the whole way.
Dean fishes his phone out of his jeans and types a speedy message before sending it off with a chime.
“You’re doing great, Cas! Keep going!” Dean shouts over the music and Gabriel’s directions. He keeps moving but looks over his shoulder to watch Cas’s progress.
Castiel nods and opens the fridge, shoving containers of leftovers and other snacks aside to make room. After Dean slides the box inside, Castiel takes a peek at the design. Unsurprisingly, Dean has gone above and beyond. The cake is frosted in chocolate, with cookie pieces sprinkled on top to resemble a road. A foodsafe toy car sits at one end of the road, posed as if running from the dinosaurs chasing close behind. He wouldn’t be admitting it to Gabriel anytime soon, but Castiel thinks it’s pretty obvious who Dean made the cake for, and it isn’t a child he’s just met. The implication of that thought sends a thrill sparking through Castiel’s bones. He shivers as he closes the refrigerator, using it as a convenient excuse for the goosebumps pebbling both arms.
When Dean tastes his first bite, the warm dough and melty chocolate coalescing in his mouth, he’s hit with the sudden nostalgia of sitting in a too-tall wooden dining chair, barely reaching the kitchen table, and being served the BEST chocolate chip cookies he’s ever had. These cookies the three of them are enjoying now are so damn close to what he remembers as a kid that he could cry. And it probably came from some stupid internet recipe that Cas searched up in all of half a minute. But it doesn’t matter.
Castiel bites the inside of his lower lip. “You know, Dean, what you did back there, in the alley… you might have saved that kid’s life.”
He’s as shocked at his own admission as Cas looks—the angel inhales sharply, blue eyes wide. On the outbreath, the mortar crumbles and the bricks crack as Cas finally,
“Well, that sure was something! Great job, ladies,” Gabriel calls out to their retreating backs with a twinkle in his tone. “Come see me after the show for your prizes.”
His breath caught on the inhale. He couldn’t say it. Castiel wasn’t there to hear the message and still Dean couldn’t say it. What the hell did he have left to lose at this point? Better not to ask that question, he figured.
Hand clenching and unclenching once, he finally reaches out to request entry when the door swings out on its hinges. It opens in his face so abruptly that he falls backwards with an undignified yelp, landing flat on his ass.
Sam released his arm and Dean fell to his knees, clutching his head with his right arm, the left completely numb as though it had combusted and turned to ash.
“Fine, but put ‘em in the sink to soak and that’s all the work you’re allowed to do.” A finger waggles at Cas in mock threat.
Because Dean would be the worst partner in the world if he ever made Cas doubt that he wants this, wants them, wants him. He studies the fine lines and muscles in Cas’s face for any hint that he’s uncomfortable and almost forgets Sam is standing right there.
Taking his mission seriously, Jack skitters off toward the front of the house. Dean chuckles at the kid’s antics.
Dean turns and stares back at the person, his eyes wide in shock, but Cas just throws a middle finger over his shoulder and keeps pulling Dean toward the edge of the parking lot where he
He knew Sam would be expecting what he was about to say, but he gave his brother confirmation anyway. “Do it,” Dean replied, gritting his teeth and stretching his left arm out over the bowl.
“M’fine.” Dean ignored the dryness in his throat from being dead to the world. “Have you been crying?”
,” Dean says, before smiling back at Cas with a grin so wide, Cas feels his cheeks twinge in sympathy. “I wanna date the
“Hey, Cas,” he rasped, swallowing and clearing his throat again. “I— I know you can’t hear this any more than you could hear a prayer right now, but I just…I miss you, man. I can’t— I don’t know what to do.”
.” A nipple is tweaked between Cas’s index finger and thumb, sending a full-body shudder along Dean’s spine.
Reeling from the unintentional vulnerability, Dean swayed. Castiel’s phone dropped to the mattress as he rose from the chair and reached out his other arm, steadying Dean at the shoulder.
“Oh? You think he has a nice laugh, do you?” Gabe says, snatching the phone from the counter. Cas glares at him, and starts to make his way around the counter to get it, but Gabe hightails it to the dining room. “What else do you like about my friend Cas?”
At the mention of his name, Jack leans his head back to look at Castiel upside-down and holds up his book.
Sam gripped Dean’s wrist and held him steady as he positioned the blade along Dean’s outer arm. Pressing into the flesh, he drew a neat line from bicep to elbow and chanted, “ALDON OI GAH CNILA ORSCOR,” in a booming intonation that reverberated around the small dungeon.
As if on cue, another bolt zaps down from the heavens—so brightly, it illuminates the outdoors like sunlight—and impacts the asphalt directly ahead. But instead of dissipating, it coalesces into a glowing orb of crackling light, nestled into a crater where the road had been.
Piled up against the shop windows and door is a mountain of snow, effectively blocking anyone from leaving any time soon. There’s no way school hasn’t been cancelled.
They lean into each other, foreheads and noses pressed together, and Dean takes a moment to appreciate that the fluttering in his stomach isn’t driven by anger or anxiety for once in his life.
The one thing Dean had wanted, once upon a time, was also something he now knew he couldn’t have. He’d tried with Lisa and Ben. Dean was a caregiver through and through, and he’d always been good with kids. At least, he’d thought so until Jack came along.
“This is an extraordinary circumstance, Dean. The Heavenly ranks are thin, so he chose to be born on Earth where he would be better cared for and in a body that was more likely to be accepted. He will eventually outgrow this manifested form and, if he is to remain here,
“Let’s do this!” Gabriel reaches into the open top of the box and rustles his hand around for a moment before withdrawing a single sliver of paper. The band gives him a drumroll as he straightens it out and flips it around to read properly. “Looks like our first game is...The Bench! Who wants to play?”
for years.” After a warming sip of his cocoa, Cas sets the mug on a side table and pulls the blanket around himself before bringing the plate of pie to his lap.
A moment of consideration passes and Dean nods. “You know, I never thought I’d be calling a bug cute but hearing they like to boogie and cuddle is damned adorable. I might have to take you up on that.”
Grabbing his keys from the table, Gabriel makes a hasty retreat out the front door, laughing a goodbye as he goes.
Bending closer, Cas wraps one hand and then the other around Dean, pulling him into his mouth. Dean’s had blowjobs before but this, with Cas, is an experience on a whole separate plane of existence. He grips the sheets and holds on for dear life as Cas sucks him down as far as he can, warm tongue gliding from base to tip, lingering to lap at the curves at the top. The unholy sounds Cas is making vibrate through Dean’s most sensitive parts and he tenses, pleasure-stricken into voicelessness.
Sam jumped in his periphery but Dean merely blinked, dumbfounded. The table had just spoken. In Jack’s voice. Dean wondered if he’d hit his head. Or maybe all the drinking had finally pickled his brain.
Resisting the urge to squirm at the order or say something snarky in rebuttal, Dean nods and tosses back the second shot. He tries to slow his breathing, heart racing at the touch of Cas’s fingers on his own.
Castiel raised the hand from Dean’s wrist to cradle his cheek. “So, show me the way it was supposed to be.”
. Okay, the last one might not physically be on the list, but it’s at the forefront of Castiel’s mind nonetheless.
The sunlight filtering through Cas’s netted headpiece reflects such stunning pools of ice blue that Dean is frozen in place. “I was just thinking.”
Locating and removing a large red mixing bowl, whisk, measuring cups, skillet, cooking spray, and pancake mix from their various locations around the kitchen, Castiel gets to work. He combines the appropriate ratio of powder to water in the bowl and sprays the skillet. Clicking on the burner, he waits until the pan is uniformly heated then measures out an even amount of batter for each pancake he makes. He appreciates that they form nearly perfect circles as he pours, something that will be lost on Jack, but that’s not the point.
Dean didn’t let him finish his sentence, stealing the words with another kiss. Castiel laughed around Dean’s mouth, his joy palpable.
Jack, bless his heart, tilts his head and squints in confusion—a spitting image of Cas that warms Dean into his soul. Shrugging out of his jacket sleeves, Jack turns his face toward his uncle. “What’s a
Pausing a beat too long, Cas looks away, playing it off like he was just taking in the scenery. Maybe it’s the mead talking, but Dean starts to think that maybe the scrutiny has a deeper meaning.
“Listen, brotato,” Gabriel continues. “I’ve been around you long enough to know that even though everything’s probably fine, you’re not gonna sleep until you get some sort of reassurance that he’s okay.”
Dean slammed the laptop closed and reached into his nightstand for the conveniently stashed whiskey. Unscrewing the cap, he downed a few gulps straight out of the bottle. As the burn seeped into his core, an idea occurred to him through the fog of alcohol.
Walking toward where he chained his bike, Castiel pulls out his phone to check his messages. He finds a picture waiting for him of a toddler with paint spread all over his outstretched hands and in a few splotches on his face and shirt. The accompanying text says, “
Cas takes the pie tin from Dean and whistles quietly at the number of films to watch in just one franchise. And Dean hadn’t even mentioned the multiple cartoon series or the live action show, but if he could get Cas hooked on the lore, he’d have to show him the rest. For context, of course.
Cas melts into him, grasping Dean’s shirt and resting long fingers against his collarbone in a contradiction of strength and tenderness. The physical push and pull of their movements echoes their entire relationship, but this time, as one waxes and the other wanes, they bask in a shared glow.
Dean sat up, tentatively swinging his legs over the edge of the bed. It was probably a good thing he hadn’t eaten in almost two days because he might have thrown up otherwise. Guilt gnawed at the pit of his stomach. “I’m so sor—”
“The last creep was pretending to be a doctor in a hospital. This one had been dressing as a delivery guy and staking out in the suburbs. The bastard would watch and wait until some unwitting parents left home and then walk on up like he had a package to deliver that needed a signature.”
Cas flaps a hand in dismissal as he takes a sip. “I get a supplier discount. My brother helps me collect the honey at the end of the summer season and takes a portion of it to local breweries like this one. They ferment it into the fine drink you see before you.”
Dean plops down on Jack’s left and accepts his mug from Cas’s outstretched hand, their fingers brushing with a tender look shared as Dean relaxes against the couch. He kicks one ankle atop the opposite knee and takes a tentative sip. “Hey, bud. Need some help deciding?” Jack nods. “How about
Although loath to leave the sheets and his present company, especially in the nude, Castiel slinks stealthily off the edge of the bed.
Dean stares at Cas with wide eyes, awed and unsure what to say. He finally settles on the ever eloquent, “Wow.”
Ingredients and baking tools are strewn all across the counter tops. A carton of eggs. A bowl with a whisk. A baking sheet. A roll of wax paper. Measuring spoons.
“It’s fine, man. Scared the hell out of me and I’ll probably have a bit of a bruise, but it’s not a problem.”
“Almost five years,” Cas replies, setting down his glass and piling leafy greens onto his plate from the salad bowl. He drizzles vinaigrette dressing over the top and sighs. “It was time I got my own place, but I moved here rather suddenly after my folks kicked me out.”
Fetching his phone from his pocket, he checks the time. Still nearly an hour before sunrise. Plenty of time for what he wants to accomplish. Toeing on his shoes, he carefully makes his way downstairs, attempting to remain as soundless as possible as he begins poking around the shop with just the light from his phone.
He dug his phone from his pocket. Shaking hands unlocked the screen and he hovered a thumb over the contacts button. After another long swig, he pressed Castiel’s contact number and held his breath.
freaked out. But I trust you, Cas. I’d like to believe we’re both past all the lying to each other. If you say we gotta do this,” Dean continues, turning toward where Cas is almost touching him from shoulder to hip on the seat. “I’m all in. Besides, I’d rather have the kid battin’ for our team. We’ve got enough entities gunning for us.”
While the first batch of pancakes is starting to brown, Castiel gets some fresh strawberries from the fridge and a banana from off of the hanger on the counter. He rinses the strawberries and retrieves a small cutting board and fruit knife before having to flip the pancakes. Alternating between slicing the fruit and checking on the pancakes, Castiel finishes cooking breakfast within a few minutes.
Dean tugs some clothing out of a bag and holds it up to Chaz. “What do you say we get you into something a little warmer than just your birthday suit, and then you can come see if this kid’s meal tastes like molecules?”
it’s embarrassing, are you kiddin’ me?” Dean groans. “I called you drunk out of my gourd—a call that you were rude enough to answer, by the way, instead of letting me leave you a voicemail like any other kind person—”
“Hello again, Dean. How can I help you today?” Castiel manages, the fluster on his face absent from his voice.
“God, it smells like a brewery in here.” Removing the bottle from Dean’s grasp (a surprisingly difficult task given Dean’s current situation), Sam shook his head when he saw how little was left. He dumped the remainder into the bedroom sink. Returning to Dean’s side, he knelt so as to give his back stability, then hoisted his big brother off the couch with a grunt and some mental swearing, staggering to the bed where he could plop him onto an actual mattress.
There’s no way around it. He’s got to apologize. But a text won’t be enough to save Dean’s last shred of self-respect. This has to be done in person. At least he has the entire weekend to mope (and recover from the jackhammers in his skull) before he has to face the man on Monday.
As Dean finishes the last of his burger, Gabriel stands up and brings the microphone to his mouth. “Hello everyone and welcome to improv night!”
“After all was said and done, we took Claire out to some schmancy shopping mall as a treat for a job well done. I can’t remember the last time I went to a mall, but it was depressing as all get-out. Hardly anyone shops in person anymore, and that just made the Christmas decorations seem spooky. It looked like a very clean apocalypse.”
Jack nods and Dean proceeds to ring up the order in hand, the last one for the moment. When he’s finished, he crouches down to Jack’s level and cups a hand around the boy’s ear, giving quiet instructions.
Somehow, the hushed way Dean responds is more frightening than when he had the knife drawn. Not that Castiel feels afraid of him. He just doesn’t want to push what is so clearly a sore spot. “I shouldn’t pry. I’m sorry, Dean.”
Cas grabs Dean's hips and pulls him in close, their hips almost pressed together. “Mm, yes, I know,” Cas starts, looking down Dean's body and biting his lip. He looks back up to Dean’s face in time to see Dean’s pupils blow wide, and his eyes can’t seem to stop flicking between Cas’ gaze and his lips.
At the end of the song, Dean grabs Cas by the collar of his robe and kisses him quickly but deeply. Not so much as to be obscene, but long enough for Jack to make a comment about cooties and hold up two cookies to shield his eyes. Laughing, Dean breaks away.
“You said that happiness isn’t in the having, but you can’t tell me this isn’t better,” Dean reflected when they finally parted, foreheads resting together. “You can have me, Cas. All of me.”
Evening finds Dean and Castiel chatting from opposite ends of the couch with Jack sprawled between them and wrapped in his new blanket, Gabriel having stolen the recliner at the start of a movie that no one is watching. The cartoon only drawing his attention in short bursts, Jack is busied with a coloring book, pausing every so often to show off to his seated audience. In the meantime, Gabriel has fallen into a sugar coma, snoring softly and muttering something about cherry stems.
Dean lifts a bangled arm to slide sunglasses off his nose, revealing that pair of devastatingly green eyes. “Heya, Cas,” he says, flashing his characteristic dazzling grin so brightly that Castiel thinks he might just melt into a puddle, though he manages to stumble over a salutation of his own. “And you must be Jack!” Dean crouches low, bringing himself to Jack’s level. “I’m Dean.”
Dean clears his windpipe of any lingering dinner and washes it away with a long drink from his cup. “It’s good to have family you can depend on. I wish my brother could be here.”
When they reach the top of the stairs, Jack is sitting smack in the middle of the couch with his legs criss-crossed, holding the remote in both hands and thumbing the rocker switch to shift between two options on the screen as if he can’t make up his mind. Sure enough, he can be heard mumbling to himself, “What to choose… What to choose…” while he alternately displays the title cards for
Reaching forward, Dean runs his hand through Cas’s dark hair, over the ear and down the back of his neck. “Not at all, sweetheart. But you keep that up and I’m not gonna last. C’mere.”
He leaned over and draped himself over the dog who only wagged harder and wiggled around to lick Dean’s face.
“I won’t keep you, then. I don’t need you blaming me when you go gray early.” Dean pushes himself off the couch and starts piling the dishes on the tray.
Cas, on the other hand, is red across the cheeks as he tries to keep up. Whether that’s from the alcohol or abashment is anyone’s guess, but Dean thinks Gabriel may want to skip town for a while after this is all over.
Sam hummed in annoyance, but his expression soon softened into the face that always got him the last of the good cereal. “If not for me, do it for...him. You know he’d want you to get better.”
Pulling into the bakery’s gravel lot, Dean parks and douses the headlights, spending a few moments checking missed messages from the drive home. He’s got four from Cas—three pictures and one text—and one from his brother, a voicemail asking about coming by for the grand opening in a few days. It’s late, so he’ll get back to Sam tomorrow. Dean steps out of the Impala and locks her up, opening the pictures as he walks to the front door.
Dean sat with his hands in his hair, phone buzzing uselessly against the cold dungeon floor while his head resounded with the same three words, over and over and over.
Jack seems to perk up at the mention of food, suddenly much more animated as he climbs up into his favorite seat at the table. “Can I have fancy pancakes, Unca Cas?” Jack still has some trouble with L sounds but Castiel is proud of how substantially his vocabulary has expanded in the past year.
Dean’s stomach twists with a mix of anxiety and curiosity at the thought of Cas staying. At the thought of him
Cas’s pocket plays a tune a few moments later and he nods. “And I think that’s my cue. Thank you again for having me over for dinner. I had a great time.”
“This was lovely, Dean. Really. I’d stay if I could.” Cas stands and folds the blanket he’d had around himself, returning it neatly into the bin. He stretches his arms skyward to awaken stagnant muscles from sitting still for so long, and Dean catches a flash of skin as Cas’s shirt hitches with the motion.
Meanwhile, there was a hole in Dean’s heart the size of the Chrysler building and no amount of booze could fill it. Not that it stopped him from trying.
Cas moves to the edge of the bed and takes a seat. “You, of all people, are uniquely equipped to handle this scenario. You’ve dealt with more angels than most humans ever have or will. And you are a capable man who has experience with everything from childcare to apocalypses.”
“Hey, you silly bumblers! What’d I say about running around?” Castiel admonishes, but not without a hint of laughter seeping into his tone.
“I hope he likes what I got him,” Dean says, shutting the back door and opening the front. Reaching into the shotgun spot, he carefully drags a cake box out of the car and shifts it so that it’s balanced in his grip. “You mind getting that door for me?”
Cas smiles gently, but it doesn’t quite reach his eyes, and his arms come up to cross against his chest.
Dean grins, his eyes sparkling. “I don’t have class again until noon tomorrow,” he says slowly, eyebrows waggling. “We could do breakfast, instead.”
Dean stops mid-spin. “Whoops, my bad. I asked Jack to be my wingman. Kinda forgot about the rules.” He gives a guilty smile that is way too cute for his own good and lowers Jack to the ground, taking his hand again. “C’mon, buddy. Let’s go see what the buzz is all about.”
“Man, it’s freezing,” Dean gripes. He digs through his dresser for warm pajamas. It’s simply too cold for anything other than extra layers, a fact he laments all the more when he watches Cas step out of his jeans and into sweatpants of his own. Shivering, he crawls under the comforter and sheets, yanking everything over his head, and waits for Cas to join him in the burrow. After several seconds of silence, Dean calls out, “Are you a frozen stalactite out there?”
Cheeks burning, he turns away from the sill and busies himself by filling two glasses of water and placing one beside each plate until Cas knocks at the door. Dean reaches the handle in three quick strides, praying his face is no longer crimson.
Gabriel is a zoology professor, after all, so Castiel wouldn’t be surprised if he had performed some sort of study on elephants and alcohol in the past.
The bench skit ends. Four new performers are chosen and are split into two teams. On each team, one person is the ‘action figure’ and the other person is responsible for moving the action figure’s arms, legs, and head to act out a scene. While the two action figures are maneuvered into human-shaped motorcycles, shopping carts, and more, Dean finds himself laughing so hard that tears dew the crinkles of his eyes. Once he can breathe again, he wipes his eyes and finishes his drink, sitting back with a contented sigh.
“If you’d like, I’d be happy to give you a tour of the hives. But, they’ll be quite stationary during the winter as they huddle to keep the colony warm and insulated.”
Dean whispers something in the guy’s ear that Castiel can’t hear, and the kid agrees with a vigorous nod. Dean grip eases and he releases his hold, but keeps the knife trained on the boy. He waits, likely trying to buy the other kid time. “Alright, get the hell out of here and don’t let me catch you again.”
Knife wounds were a sting Dean knew well. Nothing a few stitches and some gauze couldn’t fix. But when Sam began to speak the angelic language, the dagger burned so hot that the blood dripping down his arm was molten. Eyes shut tight against the scalding, he couldn’t hold back a scream as the blaze traveled up his shoulder and neck, scorching into his head and chest. There was a tearing sensation from deep within, the very essence of his being collapsing in on itself like a star going supernova. When he opened his eyes, his vision had gone white.
After Jack’s cartoon ends, Cas stands from where he and Dean had been sitting and chatting as they ate fresh apple slices and peanut butter (with Jack running back and forth to steal bites as well, Cas feigning ignorance of his presence and shock at discovering that a “mouse” had been eating their food, much to Jack’s giggling amusement). “Who’s ready for a trip to visit our friends Apis mellifera?”
?” he asks, the S sounds whistling a bit through the gaps where the tooth fairy has already claimed some baby teeth.
“A fledgling angel, yes,” Cas answers Dean’s unfinished question. He runs a gentle hand over the boy’s wispy hair and looks down at his new charge. “When an angel dies, their essence—what humans might call an angel’s soul—rests in the Empty. Typically, their grace would go with them. But an angel may choose to separate themselves from their grace right before they die. When that happens, the grace will create new life.”
Still riding the adrenaline, Dean calls the police. While he waits, a buzzing in his hand reminds him of Cas’s unanswered text. He hurries to type a response so Cas knows he’s not in a ditch, not really stopping to consider that his ambiguousness is only going to lead to more questions.
“Oh, thanks so much,” Dean snarks, tone as dry as the habitat of a cactus wren. “Gonna let me humiliate myself first, huh? That’s so nice of you.” He laughs, and it’s much too self-deprecating for Cas’s liking.
The call goes dead and Gabriel doubles over, howling until he’s crying. Meanwhile, Cas slides off the table and flops onto his back on the dining room rug, observing the popcorn ceiling as if it holds the answers to all mysteries of life.
They walk the last block in silence. The bakery soon comes into view and they stop at the gravel path leading to the front porch steps.
Just three days after the burglary, the shop is looking better than ever. With all the helping hands getting Dean back on his feet, he’s able to hold the grand opening today just as planned. At the asscrack of dawn, his excitement had decided that he was done sleeping, so he called Cas over and set about putting finishing touches on the place: one final sweep of the entryway, colorful flowers from Cas’s garden in a vase by the register, and a million readjustments of each table, chair, and napkin in the place. Of course, all the fresh pastries, pies, and other baked goods for the day are displayed prominently in the replaced glass cases.
The storm clouds lighten and Cas gives a half-smile. “I don’t know why, but I feel like I can be myself with you. It’s...refreshing.”
“I know it’s too late. You’re never going to hear this and that’s— that’s my fault. I should’ve— I should’ve said this a long time ago.”
Instead of stepping back to give Dean more room, Cas traps him at the bottom of the ladder by moving his hands away from the metal to wrap around Dean’s hips, fingertips sliding into the back pockets of his jeans. “Oh, I like those plenty. But I like them more inside your head where they belong, so don’t go busting your pretty melon either.”
The cookies back then—just like the cookies in his hands now—didn’t taste amazing because of some epic combination of ingredients. There was no sorcery involved in the baking process. It was the tenderness inside the oven mitts. The smile behind the cookie sheet. The smooch on the cheek after the milk was poured and set beside the tray.
“Can I check it?” Cas finds himself asking, and Dean’s eyebrows jump, but he nods and moves to stand in front of Cas, edging his way in between where Cas has spread his legs a bit. The move feels
He doesn’t realize he is frozen, fixated on the young seraph—who, in a remarkably human pose, is suckling a thumb and nuzzling against Cas’s striped tie—until a warm hand wraps around his shoulder. Cas stares Dean dead in the eyes and cuts him right to the quick. “I have faith in you, Dean. In us. And so does this little one.”
Within only a few minutes, he’s cleared the entire house. Whoever did this is long gone. The fact that they left the upstairs untouched means they must have wanted to send a message but didn’t plan to stick around and risk getting caught. Considering Dean’s current state of mind, that was probably in their best interest.
“You surprise me, Dean,” Cas rumbles. “I thought you’d be more ‘freaked out’ about this.” Dean doesn’t need to look at him to know he’s doing the finger quote thing again.
“What the hell happened?” Castiel takes a seat beside Dean and the liberty of pulling him close. Dean leans into the touch and scoffs but doesn’t answer. He’s shaking, but something tells Castiel it isn’t just from the cold. “You’re freezing. What are you doing out here?”
Dean spins and almost topples them both, still trapped in the embrace. “S-Sam!” Flushing as deep as ever, he recovers his balance as Cas steps back with a conflicted expression. Shit. Cas probably thinks Dean’s embarrassed about being seen with him like that.
When Dean moves to put the key into the lock, the slight pressure alone swings open the entire door without a turn of the knob. Distantly, he realizes he must have left it unlocked when he was carrying the cake to the car. He steps forward into the darkness of the shop but stops short at the discordant crunch of glass between boot and concrete. “What the…”
Dean pulled his jacket closer around himself, palm clutching at the bloody handprint, the only piece of Castiel he had left. There hadn’t even been a body to burn or a coat to keep. Just the memory of a strong grip on his shoulder as he was shoved away, a cruel parody of Dean’s salvation from Hell.
At the end of his shift, Castiel pulls the tarp closure down over the booth and ties it off. He takes a moment to press his fingers into a sore spot in his neck before he sets about pulling the shelved product forward and straightening things people have moved out of place throughout the day. He checks the dates on the dairy case and removes a few bottles that are past their freshness. Finally, he unlocks the register and removes the day’s cash and most of the coins, rubberbanding the bills together and dumping it all into a thick plastic zip bag which he shoves into the bottom of a backpack. After locking the register again, he removes his shop apron, hangs it from a wooden coat rack, and swings the backpack across his back, adjusting the weight on tired shoulders.
Dean was lightheaded. He sat back anyway, giving Castiel space though it filled his chest with lead, heavier than when he’d been crushing their bodies together.
the resident human, I can assure you we’ll need to get some supplies for this to work. But don’t be surprised if folks still do a double-take at us. Those flappers are gonna be hard to hide.”
The first photo is of Dean with Jack on his back from their time horsing around on the way to the bees. He hadn’t even seen Cas with his phone out to take the picture, and it makes him smile to know that Cas had indulged them for a moment before telling them to knock it off.
“It doesn’t feel right, moving on like that when it’s only been a week. I get that Sammy’s frustrated, though. I do. We’ve scoured the lore harder than ever, and our sleeves are all outta aces. Even tried to contact Rowena, but she’s almost as hard to reach as Jack, these days.”
you drunk. This is not it. Plus, you’ve only had two glasses of wine and your alcohol tolerance is higher than an elephant's.”
The deep ache in his chest became a pounding in his head like a reaper at the door. But there wouldn't be an easy way out for Dean Winchester. Never was.
Once Dean dragged himself out of that dungeon and reunited with the only other people left on Earth, the next two days were spent in a rapid-fire succession of finding Michael, getting tricked by Lucifer, making a plan, losing Michael to Chuck, removing Chuck’s godhood, and saving the world again. (Somehow, they’d even adopted a dog via divine intervention.)
“Jack, wait for us!” Cas calls after him, moving to return the piece of honeycomb and close up the hive.
Chuck was still out there and as long as Dean had breath in his body, he would do what he had always done. Beaten and broken, he would continue to stand up until he couldn’t stand anymore. He would keep fighting for everyone he had loved and lost, for his family both given and found.
Cas lets out a startled laugh, and Gabe is staring at the phone like it’s suddenly sprouted the feet that Dean seems so fixated on.
Castiel groans, giving up his pursuit of Gabe and sprawling his upper half across his table in defeat while he’s subjected to the remainder of this conversation.
Dean yelled and threw his beer bottle across the room where it exploded and cracked his mirror, broken glass crashing into the sink. That was going to be a bitch to clean later, but he didn’t care. Everything around him broke eventually. It was his turn this time.
as they both stumble over a few steps. Their hands are still clasped between their bodies and Dean is staring down at them.
Dean’s face clouds for a moment, but soon beams. “I’m glad you like it. I’m thinking I’ll offer it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an upcharge.”
Sturdy hands, calloused and tanned from days spent working the farm and gardens, tug featherlight to maneuver Dean into position under the sink.
“Oh, my god.” Dean makes a show of rolling his eyes and smacking the back of his head against the pillow, now askew from all his flailing. “Come here, you nerd.”
you—Agh! Careful!” He almost flings his food when Castiel smacks him in the arm (equally for the comment and the nickname), so he quickly shoves the bite into his mouth. “Oh my god. You have got to keep this guy.” That earns Gabriel a follow-up smack, but Castiel is smiling now, engrossed in replying to his phone.
When they spin around again, Cas is smiling a bit brighter than before. The last set of moves in the sequence is to step four times in a square and Cas completes the motion almost perfectly. He looks up from his feet to find Dean grinning.
“Hey, Cas. It’s been a few days. Sam just got back from visiting Eileen and he won’t quit naggin’ me. Ever since he walked in the door it’s been, ‘Dean, you shouldn’t drink so much,’ ‘Dean, why don’t you go for a walk outside?’ ‘Dean, let’s go grab a case to get your mind off things’,’' he said, imitating Sam’s voice with a mocking inflection. Dean sighed, composing his thoughts.
After dinner, Chaz decides he very much appreciates the plush sloth toy that came with his meal, especially its sparkly purple irises. He cuddles up with it between Cas and the wall, resuming his earlier lesson in American television.
“Of course, you’re so much more than just your angel mojo. Because even when you were completely human, you were still Cas. And, sure, Jimmy mighta been a good-lookin’ guy, but you were always more than that vessel, too. You were in the crinkles around your face when you laughed. You were in that fierce glare behind those baby blues, whether  shinin’ with grace or just reflecting the sunshine.” He closed his eyes, trying to remember Castiel’s. “The depth of your voice—or, I guess, your true voice filtered through human vocal cords so that you wouldn’t make my ears bleed.”
Dean’s eyes widened in panic as he glanced between the angel and the full voicemail box he’d completely forgotten to wipe before the ritual. Cas had heard it. He’d heard it all. Every curse and avowal. Every mournful cry.
Grabbing another cloth and some cleaning solution, he doused the fabric and ran it over a blade covered in crusty monster gunk from an earlier hunt.
From a stepstool, Cas finishes replacing the fancy light bulbs and looks over to see Dean gaping like a big-mouthed bass. He climbs down the ladder and walks over, placing a playful finger on Dean’s chin to close his mouth, though it quickly reopens when he, at last, finds enough of his voice to make a full sentence. “Cas, you organized all this? For me? How did you get all these people together?”
“So, you know how my pie recipe was my mom’s? Well, she also used to make the BEST chocolate chip cookies. But she didn’t write that recipe down, and no matter what I try, I can’t recreate it. I’ve tried using different kinds of sugar and vanilla. I’ve tried adjusting the temperature and the cook times. I’ve tried adding a little bit less flour and a little more butter—”
Finally picking up the smoker, Castiel sprays several puffs of smoke into the slotted beehive. Unlike Dean and Jack, he isn’t wearing gloves so that he can avoid squishing any of the insects in his care. Carefully, he reaches into the box and lifts out one honeycombed slat. A few hundred bees coat each side, most of them barely moving between the settling effect of the smoke and the slight chill in the air. “Here we are. Aren’t they fabulous?”
Castiel does as Dean suggests, his stomach suddenly tight with apprehension about what Dean might be about to show him.
“C-coulda fooled me,” Dean stutters as Cas nuzzles along his jaw, sucking kisses down the stretch of his neck, fingers roaming across his body and pausing just at his waistband. Dean groans at the delay, jeans uncomfortably tight at the zipper.
“Hey, I’m good if you are. And I think Jack-attack here looks strong enough to protect us both. Isn’t that right?” Dean gives Jack’s bicep a gentle squeeze and the boy takes on a playfully aggressive stance, imitating martial arts moves and sound effects. “See? Nothin’ to worry about, Cas.”
“Way to butter me up, dude.” Dean runs his fingers across his forehead and drops his eyes to the hideous green carpet beneath his boots.
Gabriel spends the next five minutes explaining a set of moves involving tapping toes to each side, walking forward while crossing alternating legs, kicks, stomps, turns, and shuffles. He demonstrates each and has the dancers practice along. Despite the booze, Dean’s fairly confident in his ability to remember the moves, having been to a country bar or two in his time.
“That was the most fun I’ve had in a while,” Castiel admits as he and Dean walk away from the amphitheater and into the parking area.
Dean stops moving his feet and leans back, playing broom guitar at the longer bridge between the verses. Castiel realizes he’s staring and kicks off in a fluster to resume his ride home.
In the next moment, all that is left is the destroyed road, a light drizzle, and the two of them in their respective seats. Cas is, somehow, completely dry and cradling something in his arms. Something which emanates a faint aureate hue.
He knows that Gabe means well, but, honestly, Castiel would have much more fun just watching documentaries in his underwear all night. There was a new nature show airing on ABC narrated by Helen Mirren. How could someone
With a click of the handle and a sweep of weather stripping, Cas steps out and eases the door closed. He silently takes a seat beside Dean and follows the path of his gaze upward.
In the phone’s reflection, he spots the moon and looks up, remembering all the times he wondered the exact same thing sitting outside motel rooms exactly like this while Sammy slept, their father who-knew-where for who-knew-how-long.
He takes a deep breath. He’s only a pace away; he could just walk right up to the door and give it a swift knock. It wouldn't take much effort at all (except, apparently, it takes a world of effort).
Once satisfied that they had been mixed properly, Sam set the container onto a table in the middle of a summoning sigil. He picked up the crimson knife and turned to Dean. “You sure about this?” Sam’s brows knit into that overturned U-shape they always formed when he was concerned.
Blue-sky eyes darken, sending a lightning flash through Dean’s veins and he shivers with need. In the next instant, he’s leading Cas out of the bathroom and down the hall, past the couch where they shared pie and cocoa. Dean slams into the handle of his bedroom door with such ferocity, he may have one more thing to replace in the morning, but that’s future Dean’s problem.
