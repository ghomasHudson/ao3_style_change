The A.I.'s words snapped Tony out of his line of thoughts, only to turn his blood into ice in his veins as he made sense of what his A.I. told him. Tony stood as fast as he can ignoring the chair that went crashing to the floor as he raced to the stairs, running as fast as he can to reach his baby's room, his heart in his throat as he slammed the door to Morgan's room open causing it to slam into the wall. The noise was so loud that it woke his daughter who started crying like a siren, shrieking and crying louder and louder the longer Tony ignored her.
"I was doing nothing wrong but teaching that slave a lesson, it was your son who barges in where he was unwelcomed!" Hamar suddenly snapped, which caused everyone to gasp and back away, the scent of terror filling the hill, even those who were with Hamar shuffled away on their knees away from him, wondering how much of an idiot the man was for talking back, no one talk back to the king without some punishment involved.
"Tony… that's amazing…" Howard and Peggy breathed out as they took the device from Steve, gazing at it with wide eyes as a million other possibilities crossed their minds, already wondering how Omegas' rights would take off with vigor if they started producing this device, the thought of Omegas finally being able to stand up to their fellow Alphas without fear of them using their voice made them hope.
Tony felt like a fairy tale prince when he had his first dance with Steve, so many emotions swirled inside Tony that it was a wonder how he didn't cry. After the amazing and heart fill wedding, the party after was one full of laughter and fun, causing Tony to laugh at his friends' actions, even Peter, who spend the day on a sugar rush, finding an excuse to eat as many cakes as he liked because it was 'Papa and Mama's wedding!'
Anyway, if you were wondering, Steve still possesses his pre-serum body, but with his post-serum strength!!!
"You are not the first king I plot his death!" Snarled the Omega as he hissed at the man, causing him to pause and look at the growling Omega, who looked like a chained beast waiting for someone to slip before taking the chance and slaughter them all. "If you have not come four days ago it would have been me who killed the Hydra king, so do not take pleasure in a stolen victory, I thought you were better than that." The Omega mocked which made the Alpha growl and stalk toward the Omega, getting enraged when the Omega neither backed away nor flinched when he approached.
"Mr. Rogers?" A nurse called out, nearly causing Tony to jump out of his chair if it wasn't for Steve holding his hand tightly and steadying him. The two of them stood up, following the nurse to the office, Tony's anxiety was increasing by the second and the only thing that held him from running away was Steve's gentle hand on the small of his back as it steer him to their destination.
"As long as those two are not in the same house as me or the queen, everything will be bearable… you did prepare a house for those two on the other side of the village, right?" Anton asked, will... he plead, but he will deny he did for the end of time, but he pleads that Magna found a vacant house for those two serpents. Anton can't have those two near his son or the queen; those two did enough poisoning that Anton fears what they will do when they have the chance to be alone with the still grieving queen.
"Anton?" The voice behind Anton made his hackle rose as he turned around, seeing Jamti, Anton bites the inside of his cheek hard, trying to control himself before he said something he would regret. "Anton… is something wrong?" Jamti asked, causing Anton to let out a harsh breath through his nose and look away.
"Yes, that's true… it was only after his death that Sharon finally came forward and confess, she managed to save all the evidence that Rogers manage to gather on Pierce and an uproar took over the town; many took Pierce's side, other's took the Rogers's side. Sharon couldn't handle the harassment she was getting from everyone, that's why she… she killed herself near the lake; as for the Rogers family, they left the town and disappeared one night." Fury shifted in his place, his words causing Tony to become speechless, especially because of the vast difference between the articles he read and the story Fury was telling. "It was then that Rogers finally… return… terrorizing Pierce and his followers until Rumlow came and confess of his and his father's crimes, not wanting to be killed by Rogers like what happened to his friends… it was madness, the day that Rogers showed himself to everyone, exposing everyone and the dark secrets they held… everyone thought that after Pierce died and Rumlow being held in an asylum, Rogers would have disappeared after taking the revenge he was after, but he didn't. It is thirty years later and Rogers doesn't seem like he was going to leave the town anytime soon." Fury's words caused Tony to press his lips tightly, wondering in the back of his mind if this was just a big fat joke that he was in the middle of.
"Tony, please listen to me!" Howard plea with his son, hoping that the young Omega will see reason, Tony was seventeen! For God's sake! What does he know about raising a child when he was a child himself? Fuck the world if they knew about the situation, but Tony couldn't handle this, the baby will ruin him, will ruin the future the Omega always wanted, for as long as Howard could remember, the Omega always wanted to be recognized by people, wanted to show them that Omegas can be as good as Alphas maybe even better, but with a baby, the shareholders wouldn't even look at him twice, they will strike him down before he had the chance to stand up!
"Finally! You are late!" The metal creature snapped when the ship finally landed and strange people got out of it, making Steven frown harshly because for one, they don't look like elves, nor they have the aura of Asgardian... they almost looked like… Steven pales at that line of thought as he took them in… they are Midgardian! So that meant he was in Midgard! Hate, pain, and sadness start warring inside of Steven, which made the star bit the inside of his cheek hard… just no! "Any longer with Mr. Star and strips over here and I would have become a loon too." The metal creature… should Steven really call it a creature when it was Midgardian? Said which made Steven glare at her or was she a 'him'?
It made Steve wonder when he would wake up from this nightmare, it made him want to ask for Dr. Strange so he would send him back home, but he always paused at that remembering that Dr. Strange start learning the ways of mystic arts in 2016 that if he told Peggy to bring the man to him, there would be a possibility for him not getting into the accident that shaped his future to become the best sorcerer that was known after the Ancient One, and he was afraid to call the woman least some damage was done to this universe.
"You and me, buddy." Steve offered to Peter as he starts walking toward the car, leading Tony with him by the waist, though not before kissing his cheek once again, giving the bear a mocking glare, causing Peter to puff his chest in pride and for Tony to chuckle at his Alpha's actions.
Tony could only press his lips tightly and hum, leaning back down on Steve's chest, thinking about his husband's words. It was true; finally, the adopting process has come to an end after a year. It was a long time in Tony's books, a really long time, Tony wanted to finish the adopting process faster, maybe in three months or six instead of the standard twelve to eighteen months. Unfortunately, it seemed that this was something that can't be done, even with Tony being a Stark and all of that jazz; at that time, Tony was furious, he wanted Harley with him, Steve, and Peter as fast as he can't.
Tony's words though seemed to freeze Steve in his place and he could do nothing but frown, his eyes taking in the short man with a thoughtful gaze. "I won't give up if that's what you think… I would still like to court you; if you are afraid of what your teammates will say, don't worry I will handle them…" Rogers said darkly, which made Tony gulp, and before he was able to open his mouth and insert his foot deeper, the lights flickered off and on, and suddenly Rogers disappeared from the lab like he wasn't even there in the first place. Tony's eyes widened at and he looked around the place wondering where the man disappeared to…
When you see the character talks like this: "Italic" it meant they are the servants from the Hydra kingdom and they are talking in English, which meant that the Vikings who know English will understand them.
"We will see about that, we have a court order to search your mansion." Said Steve pushing Stane to the side and nods to the agents to start their search, in the background he can hear Stane's screams and threats of calling his lawyers. Steve is kind of annoyed that they couldn't just arrest and interrogate him… something about him having buddies in the higher-ups.
So after Peggy got him out of his 'lovely' room in Shield's HQ, he was then led to the mansion with the rest of the team, Thor still goes on and on about how Steven should go with him to Asgard to meet the AllFather. Steve was still pulling him around trying to show him who is the Alpha so he will spill everything he knows about Hydra (Which was not working, it was only making Steven irritated) Peggy was still looking at him with her 'I finally knew something that's important about you and you won't like it.' look. the rest of the team was hounding Steven for more information to be able to infiltrate Hydra (Clint and Natasha) thankfully Tony didn't bother him that much too interested in finding some new ways to be able to destroy Hydra from the inside out, Bruce God bless him, decided to be the peacemaker and make some tea for the group which Steven was grateful for.
There Tony was getting lost between two choices, one was walking around the edge of what's going to become a lake once it rains, and the other was going through that lake-to-be, but unfortunately for Tony, it seems that all of his luck has left him today for no reason, the ground under him shook and broke off and because of that it ended with him falling, which by the way made him give a girlish scream, and Tony has to say that today was not one of his proud days, he spent the whole time screaming, much to his discomfort.
"My lucky star…" Steven was able to strain his ear to pick up those words, lifting his eyebrow wondering what those words meant, though Tony sighed as he starts rubbing the boy's back when he let out a whimper. "It disappeared, Daddy, my lucky star disappeared, I can't find it anywhere!" Peter whined some more until he calmed down, sniffing at the soft words his father murmured in his ear.
But she wondered why the king became soft this sudden as to take the Omega and his people as their slaves when the Alpha himself hates the idea of strangers in his village… a stolen relic… if the Omega was one of their people than Nattalegg would understand why the king wanted to retrieve what was stolen from them, be it an Omega from their people or gold, but if that was true then the king would have ordered her to get the information from the Omega, to know from where he was, to know if he was a traitor or a prize, to know what his end goals were, but the king didn't do that, he just took the Omega and throw him into the cell, by himself! She knows that he at least gave the guard a heart failure when he saw the king walk to the cellar and throw the Omega inside with the rest of the servants.
Bruce, the only person who was smart enough, pointed to the direction that Steve went to, causing Tony to growl madly and march forward, planning on killing Steve and end it for once and for all. Finding Steve was not that hard at all, not when the creepy dolls and shadows led him to Steve's room; let's not forget the mad cackling that was heard down the halls.
"I do not think that you are in any position that can grant you any wish you want." The king said with a cold voice and narrowed eyes making the Omega look at him with harsh eyes, and the Alpha despite himself, he was a little excited to see what sharp words the Omega will throw his way, what kind of risk the Omega will take just to protect his pride.
"And you are her smart neighbor, I should have known that too, so you are really Stark, right?" Steve asked and Tony tried to hold into his smile, if not for him then for the pup who was looking at Tony with a happy look… and here he thought that maybe the Alpha was different, but he should have known that the name Stark always changes people's looks on him.
Everything was doing great, good even… until the TV on his private plane start flickering on and off before someone by the name 'Mandarin' shown on the screen, going on and on about how he hijacked Tony's plane and how he was going to nuke the plane if Tony didn't answer to his demand or whatever. The man even showed Tony a clip of him bombing the plane of the vice-president, which Tony rolled his eyes at, it was only when the news start showing his Malibu mansion burning to the ground that Tony let out a gasp of horror, and he sower if he had pearls he would have clutched them tightly.
Peter looked at the ground before looking at Tony with a small pout on his face, nearly making Tony melt. "But… I wanted to thank you… for what you did…" The pup mumbles and looked at Tony with big brown eyes which did make Tony melt and he kneeled down to be in level with the small pup.
… you took my breath away…" Rogers said as he brought his right hand to Tony, and only now Tony notice the rose stems in the man's hands…
But on another note, a vacation sounds great, maybe they could go to Malibu, Tony was sure that Peter and Steve will love spending a little time near the beach and enjoying themselves, and Tony can't lie to himself about wanting to see Steve in swimming trunks with all of his muscles on display, a thought always made Tony fan himself, being a soldier did wonder on Steve's physics.
"I… I attacked t-the Omega after insulting him and drawing the f-first hit…." Hamar stuttered from his place, not even daring to raise his eyes from the ground; everyone tensed like a bow when Starkad stood from his throne, everyone trying to back away from the Alpha who seemed more deadly than he was a few seconds ago, as the wind sends his raging scent toward those who were standing in the back.
"I've seen colder," Tony said, trying not to break as he remembered the dream/vision he saw, how Steve's bone broke one after another with every refusal he gave to Thanos until his death, how Tony stood helplessly staring as his family was killed and his home was destroyed and his baby was taken from him; Tony won't let that vision come true, he won't even if everyone turned against him on this. "This one, this very vulnerable blue one?" Tony started pointing down to the ground, his home, causing Steve to press his lips tightly. "It needs Ultron. Can't you imagine that? Peace; finally we will have peace, why can't you see that, Steve?" Tony took a step toward Steve hoping the star will understand why wouldn't he? Steve stated it himself, the only thing that stopped other worlds from invading Earth was because it was too weak, too underdeveloped, but now, Thanos' eyes sit on Earth, his eyes sit on Steve.
“So…” Tony started first, resolving to break the silence that took over the place, trying to stop from squirming when Steve’s eyes fell on him, embarrassment coloring his Irish complex red. “Is it for me?” Tony decided to respond to appear none challenged, which missed the mark by a mile, considering like Steve, his face was cherry red.
"All this time…" Howard muttered making Tony lean away from his father last the man went crazy. "He is alive, Peggy! Steve is alive!" Howard said making Peggy gasp and followed Howard who ran to his lap leaving everyone confused,
…" Natasha heard her name being whispered in a child's voice, which made her choke on her breath as she turned toward the door with wide eyes, only for them to widen when she saw someone standing near the kitchen's door. "
Steve didn't know how long he stayed here with James's head in his lap, but it was long enough that the Alpha dozes off, his breath returning to normal which made the blond man hum a little and his hand reached one of the small pillows on the couch to put it under the Alpha's head, as he stood up after that and rushing to the kitchen.
It was dark, maybe it was midnight or after midnight, Steve didn't know and didn't care, and he only wanted that singing to stop! So into the cemetery he went, he walked rows after rows of graves until he reached the one he wanted… Standing near Bucky's grave made everything real, made him realize the bitter truth, made him realize that he had failed his intended mate, that he let him die, that he didn't catch him when he fell, that Steve… that Steve was the reason his mate died…
The words Nicolaus said did nothing but gain a short laugh from the Omega, Steven already knew what the Alpha meant, and he promised himself that his babe was in for a reward; any other person Steven would have punished his babe with a swat on the bum, but because it was Nicolaus, Steven would let it slide this time. "Aye, his name is James…" Steven said which only got him a raised eyebrow from the Alpha causing Steven to chuckle and shake his head. "It is not his Nordic name, but the boy is attached to it; until he decides to take his birth name, he would be called James," Steven explained, getting a nod from the man who came to sit beside Steven leaning on the tree behind them.
Peter fidget a little before relaxing at Steve's smile, a small smile taking over his face as he returned to his invention, a web shooter or something of that sort, which made the smile on Steve's face widen a little at how smart his baby was. "Because he is nice, and maybe he can help me with the web shooter, every formula I tried for the webs didn't work, so I wanted to ask him for help." Peter said off-handedly as he returns to his tinkering.
Some readers asked about Steve's age, wondering about how he could mate someone that was half of his age and could be considered his son… the answer to that question is, in this story Steve Rogers was born July 4th, 1920, counting by that, in 1945 his age should be 25 years old, he crashed the plane at that age, now 42 years in the future when Steve was found, he was still 25 years old mentally and physically when he woke up from his coma, even when the world moved around him he was still a young man, and five years passing since waking up will make him 30 years old, as for Tony's age he is 21 years old.
So when Steve finally entrusted him with Peter for a whole day, you can say that Tony was ecstasy at the thought of spending the whole day with Peter, a whole day with his son… just the thought made Tony buzz as happy as a bee in a meadow of flowers, even spent the day before that going with Peter about the places the small boy will love to see, though the pup jumped up and down at the thought of seeing his lab in the Stark tower, which made the Alpha puff his chest in pride and happiness at the thought of his boy wanting to spend the day with him in the labs to invent and tinker…
"… I… I can h-hear him…" Whispered Steve looking around the place hoping that he would find a way to go down, down, down! "It's louder here…" Steve muttered pulling his hands from Peggy's weak grip from the shock… "Down… down… down…" muttered Steve like a crazy person as he starts searching around the room, throwing chairs and boxes away…
Steve pause at that wondering to himself why would Tony do something like this? But then he remembered, that Tony was just a teen, and like every other teen at his age, they all had some hero worship for Captain America, so Steve can see why Tony did that… it made Steve's mood fall. "What kind of program are you? What's your name?" Steve asked hoping to get more insight on Tony by talking to one of his creations; Steve looked at the claw machine, then return to the screen.
Steve looked at Asgard from the balcony, hands clenched tightly into fists, mainly to stop himself from going back to Rogers and punch him in the face, but the man was skilled he could feel it even if he didn't see it. Steve… he can't believe that he saw Bucky, his beautiful and amazing Omega, the love of his life, his end of the line, his everything… Bucky was alive, Bucky was alive in Rogers' universe, he was alive and beautiful as always, his long hair and beard only made him more beautiful, more charming, and enchanting… he was alive, and he was married with kids and grandkids, while Steve's Bucky was dead for over seventy years.
"I know, darling, I miss him too," Steve whispered, giving him another kiss on the cheek before he brought a forkful of eggs toward Tony. "Just two more weeks and the two of us can have Peter in our arms; I am sure that Peter will end up begging us to return to Italy from how much we are going to spoil him," Steve stated causing Tony to giggle knowing that Steve's words were true. Leaning up to kiss his husband on his neck Tony smiled at the thought of going back home…
Steve always wondered about Fury, the two of them, believe it or not, become best friends after 'The End', most people call the final battle 'The End', but for some, they joked about being the 'Endgame', it made Steve shake his head at that because it was not the end, villains are still out there hurting people, coming either from space or from the same earth they walk on, there was no end to their fight, as much as people wanted one. Steve always wondered how Fury was able to live this long without aging a day; it always made him suspicious, after all, Steve was sure he saw a glimpse of him once or twice in World War Two and not his father as the older man liked to say.
It wasn't so bad; Tony admit he had underestimated Pepper when she ordered him to do yoga, he thought it will be boring (It was a little) he thought it wouldn't help him calm down, but as soon as Tony stilled on a breathing batter, he took to yoga like a duck to water. It was calming, letting go of everything, stop thinking about everything and just concentrate on the pose he has to hold into for a few minutes before changing it to another one.
Tomorrow morning at eight, Steve sighed as he dressed Peter, ignoring the pup's fussing about the face mask, as usual, Steve really didn't fault the pup, after all, he knows how hard it is for Peter to always put on the face mask and gloves and treat the whole world like it was going to kill him any second, Steve knows that him treating Peter like that will maybe hurt the pup, but Steve can't lose him, he can't risk it, not after the pup getting an infection that nearly took his life away, he still remembers how they stayed in the hospital for three weeks just so that the pup will recover, he remembered holding his baby's hand in his and praying that his love will be fine, that any minute now he will open his eyes, and in the end Peter did, his baby beat the infection… but for how long? How long does Steve have before another infection appears?
Tony and Bruce looked at each other than at the man who Thor told them was a 'Steve' from another dimension, at first when Fury had come to collect them because Commander Carter wanted to see them, they thought the worse, that the person who fell from a portal in Tony's lab was a danger, but once they reached the HQ, Commander Carter took Thor by the hand and asked him if the man lying on the bed was Asgardian because he had the same scent Thor had, it confused everyone until Thor went to check on the sleeping man, he told them he sensed magic surrounding the sleeping man, that he was a 'Traveler' a person who travels through time and space, at first Tony thought that the Thor was crazy, but hearing that man speak with them with such familiarity and acting none challenged about time travel and villains attacking was kinda concerning.
They stayed for a little time talking and hugging, it was a few minutes before Natasha cleared her throat and raised her brow, pointed to the car, ordering them silently to get in, the plan was for them to have dinner at Angie’s and then go to Tony’s house, were Pepper and Rhodey were to stay with Tony for the duration of their stay.
For everyone who liked more explanation about what happened to Steven, this is the answer. When Steven was hit by the missile, his body and soul get separated, by the magic of the machine that was still on when the missile hit, his soul was suck through the portal and he was given a temporary body in the parallel universe. As you can see, later on, his body was recovered and he fell into a coma, but the strain of his body and soul being separated in different universe without death interfering was going to destroy the flow of time, so he had to choose, either to return home, which then the temporary body he gains will disappear, or stay in the parallel universe, which will finally let death claim his body that was in the other world, the Ancient One was able to stabilize Steven's soul which made his temporary body a real one.
Suddenly, the blade of a double-edged ax was pressed against Johann's throat, the cold sharpened metal that was causing a superficial cut on his neck is more than enough to shut his mouth. Steven smiled at that which made the redhead look at him with narrow eyes than she pressed the ax against the king's throat harder, her expression became steely when her eyes turned to the king and she hissed in Steven's mother language.
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, darkness, horror elements, creepiness, torture, fluff, kissing, Steve is so in love, and finally, the wedding is here! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Thank you…" Steve said after a while of silence, and the Alpha had to stop himself from puffing his chest in pride especially when he saw the Omega looking at the flowers with a gentle smile on his lips, the Alpha opened the car's door for Steve, which made the Omega purse his lips at the action, but got inside the car with no complains making the Alpha rush to the driver seat to take his place behind the wheel and drive to the destination in mind…
When Tony put his paper away, the lights start flickering, causing him to raise his eyebrow wondering what's going on; it was after the winds start howling inside of his tight closed office that Tony realized… Steve was here. "For God's sake Rogers, stop it!" Tony snaps, putting weight on the papers last they were swiped away by the winds.
"Thank you, Tony, I owe you this one." The Alpha said looking at Tony like he was a gift from heavens which made the Omega try to contain his blush at that and look at the pup that was running toward them when Steve called him. "Peter, what do you think about spending some time with Mr. Stark today?" Steve asked which made the pup's eyes widen at that and he looked between Tony and Steve like he didn't believe his ears.
"Why thank you, young gentleman!" Tony said as he leaned down and kissed Peter on the cheek with a loud smack of his lips, causing the pup to squeak a little and for a blush to conquer his whole face making Tony laugh at that followed by Steve who chuckled at his son's reaction. "Come in, please." Tony said as he opened the door allowing both the pup and the father to pass through.
Steve paused a little and then let out a sigh shaking his head at that. "I get it, Maria was here." Steve said as he closed the door and wheeled the chair until it was near the window, then he walked taking the seat near Tony's bed, getting hissed at all the while. "Tony… just because you are going to go to the therapy doesn't mean you are crazy." Steve said which made Tony clench his fists.
The doctor had told him that his son was sick, he was sick with something called 'Leukemia' some type of blood cancer, Steve remembered crying and begging the doctor to save his son, that if they want they can take all of his blood or do something to save him! He remembers the doctor's sympathy, but Steve didn't care, he felt broken, it was like his mother all over again, his baby was sick, and it was Steve's fault…
Reaching a secluded spot, Steve turned around to gaze at the people occupying the garden with him at this time of day. A few families with their kids were in the gardens, visiting their sick spouses or one of their family members, nurses and even some doctors were making their rounds in the gardens, checking on their patients and talking to their family. What Steve couldn't take his eyes away from, were the children, running around freely as they laughed, playing and enjoying themselves, even some of the kids that wore the hospital clothes attract his eyes, causing a painful tug in his heart.
The AI said before he played an old video within it, Steve was grumbling as he was tending the black eye Tony was sporting while the Alpha pouted, and Tony clearly remember that fight, because he remembered that an asshole tried to grope Steve and make inappropriate comments about the Omega which made Tony attack the Alpha, nearly getting his ass kicked if it wasn't for Steve who kicked the other Alpha away from Tony. In the video, Tony went to shower after he was kicked by Steve who was still angry at the Alpha.
Tony still remember his family's corpses on the ground, he remembers the grieve and hurt on Steve's face, Tony remember everything in details; in the back of Tony's mind, the inventor wondered what happened to his baby when Thanos killed them all. "Shh, it's OK Tony, we will stop him, it's OK…" Peggy said as she kneeled beside him, pulling him into her embrace as she rocked him from side to side trying to calm him down and knowing that she was failing at it.
Today at dinner, to Tony's unfortunate luck or fortunate depending on how you view it, everyone was sitting at the dinner table, eating, laughing, joking around, the only one who wasn't there was Steve, who was off on a S.H.I.E.L.D. mission; when Tony knew about this, you can say that Tony sulked fiercely, not that he will ever admit it if someone asks, but still…
Living with James, was not different than living with Tony, not because the man was a chattering and social person, but because the man always spent his time in his room… the only time Steve saw the man was at night when he was reheating the food that Steve made, before he returns back to his room and hides until next day, and no matter how Steve told his husband about his worries, the Alpha only shrug it off telling him that this was James's way of acting… that if his husband was home... because for the past month the Alpha never seemed to stay home that much, always away at the company and shrugging Steve's questions and pleas, something about an important deal that he needed to prepare for.
"God… this is a nightmare…" Steve choked, sobs leaving him as he hides his face in his hands, wondering what's the next step he will choose based on the dark reality that Bucky made him open his eyes for. The '
Usually, all of his friends will come to his house when they need their candy fix, or in Clint's case; his children will scream and cry until they have their candy fix, which meant that the blond Omega will crash in his home and beg for help until Tony can unearth a few candy bars for him.
In the end, Tony just sucked it up and pasted a happy smile on his face; living in ignorance was fine, Tony can do it. It wasn't like Tony didn't have that sort of life when he was with Howard and was forced to marry Stane against his will; Tony can live through everything if it meant that his daughter will be safe from any harm that will come, even if it was from the monster that lives inside the lake and the town surrounding them.
To say the truth Tony didn't know what happen, one second the cat in his arms was a normal cat, the next second a huge asses tentacles shoot out of her mouth to surround the table near Tony and in a few second, it swallows the whole table like it was a bite-size kibble, Tony could feel his mouth fell in shock as he looked at the… alien?... who turned to Tony and start purring in his arms. "Damn Steve! That's the fifth table your cat ate in this month, do something!" Tony heard his father's screams and his son squeals in delight, and the Omega blinks his eyes in shock. That day he was told that aliens were real and that Goose was a Flerken, an extinct alien spices that Goose may be the last survivor of, and that she was Captain America's beloved pet who refused to leave his side and took the job of protecting Steve's home which was the mansion, Tony nearly starts jumping in triumph from his seat…
"Yes, he woke up after Peter and I arrived, I managed to distract him and Peter with blueberry cupcakes and muffins." Steve's lips twitched up, remembering how Harley's eyes widen when they took in the fluffy and sugary treat… it would be a nightmare today, the Alpha wonder if he would manage to shepherded the kids to sleep when they are going to be on sugar high most of the day.
Of all the scary things Steve thought of while he was trying to save Peter's life, he never thought he would be the target of the laughing joke of the stars, the one who caused too many problems for the history writers by crashing their territories and mess with thousand years of history. "Move it, sweetheart, or I would shoot! Don't think I won't!" The raccoon growled at Steve, and the only thing Steve could do was twitching his eyebrow before frowning hard.
"Who art thou?" That was Thor who asked; his tone was full of scared and bewildered emotions but he took step after step until he was facing Steven, grimacing at the sneer he gets from the blond man, who leaned on the wall behind him, his torso and arms painted in dry blood that was flaking.
"Daddy…?" Peter's questioned, his eyes going to Tony, who came closer to the pair when he saw Steve hold their son tightly. Tony's breath hitched and his eyes became shiny with wetness when Peter called him by the word Tony probably dreamed about for a long time now.
!" Serpentine snapped sharply, the action causing Tony to blink his eyes and look dumbfounded at the ghost. "He wasn't my
"… You like it?" Barnes asked while tilting his head and Rogers nodded without looking away from the torturing instruments thrown around the room like it was nothing and Tony gulped when he saw the sinister sparkle in Rogers' eyes as he took everything in with glee.
Everything changes in the world, especially The Avengers. They were the ones who were hit the hardest, they were the ones who refused to change with time, because want it or not, the world needs them now, more than ever.
Tony took off the mask on his face and then put it in one of his desk drawers, petting Dummy and greeting his AI before walking toward the bathroom, sighing happily as he took a quick shower and changed his clothes. When he got out of the bathroom, he smiled a little when he saw Steve petting Goose, who was meowing happily, the Alpha, was preparing his folded mattress, and Tony felt a little pang of guilt for forcing the Alpha to sleep on the ground in his room when he had a room and a bed of his own.
When the Omega stood near the redheaded woman, something flashed before her eyes but it was too fast for Tony to know what it was. "Are you his parent, Sir?" The woman asked making Tony pause for a second, feeling the pup clinches his shirt in his small fists in fear.
"It wasn't your fault…" Tony whispered, getting a tired look from Steve as the Alpha shook his head and leaned his forehead on Tony, taking in the comfort from his Omega, something that Tony never denied anyone even when he was pained and broken, which was something that Steve always admired Tony for.
The first to clock it out were Peggy and Bucky, something about needing their beauty sleep; not that Tony will dare to stop them, a sleep-deprived Peggy and Bucky are dangerous! Half an hour later they were followed by Natasha and Bruce, the poor scientist had fallen asleep on the floor and ended with Natasha having to lead him to his room for the much-needed rest.
It was two years since Howard's death, two years since Tony and his daughter were finally free from the demon who threatened to destroy their life, all thanks to Steven who saved his daughter and managed to destroy the nightmare that was his father.
stopped his car for fuel, I ran toward the forest like the hounds of hell and the devil were racing to catch Me." Tony could only swallow at that, holding his baby tightly, the images of what Natasha described playing in his mind-eye, causing Tony to shiver. "I was lost in the woods for two days, no food, no water, and knowing that any day now I was going to die and no one would ever remember I exist, least of all my parents who sold me. Two days, and then I finally reached this lake. It was like a dream come true, seeing the house and the lake, thinking to myself that I have found a magical kingdom, that I was to be free. Just as I walked toward the lake, he showed up… Rogers broke the surface of the lake and gazed at me with blank eyes void from any life. At that moment, I knew I was going to die, I remembered all of my Nana's stories about the demons living in the deep; Rogers thought, he just took one look at me before… before he brought me to Peggy and Bucky. Ever since then I couldn't help but wonder if Rogers was really a monster or if he was just a misunderstood character." Natasha whispered, her words leaving Tony speechless and unsure.
"Use your voice…" The Omega breathed out, which made Steve tense and back away, the shock nearly freezing his body at the request he heard. Tony frowned at the Alpha's action and took a step towards him. "Use your voice!" The Omega snarled, which made the Alpha shake his head at that, horror taking hold of his heart, wondering why the Omega would ever request of him to use his Alpha's growl. Didn't Tony know that no sane and respectable Alpha would use their growl in front of an Omega? That the only time to use it was when they were in grave danger? "Fine! You won't use it, then I'll make you!" The Omega snarled as he rushed away, leaving Steve frozen in his place before he regained control of himself and rushed after Tony.
"Here…" Maria whispered as she throws a mini drawstring bag to him, making Tony shook a little as he looked at the bag, afraid that there will be a bomb inside. "There is enough money in here for you to disappear, also a new passport and identity…" Maria said as she looked with pursed lips at the grant stairs that dominated the first floor, his mother's words made the young man shake a little as he walked on shaky legs toward the bag all the while keeping his eyes on his mother, afraid that any moment now she will change her mind. "Words of advice, Anthony, never come back again." The woman said before throwing him one last look before she turned around and start walking away, telling Tony silently that this was his queue to run away, which the young man did without slacking back.
Steve didn't know what to say to that, he just give the child's hand a gentle caress and a small smile, it only made the kid give a wobbly smile in return, the sound of shouting and footsteps increased, making Steve tense and look at the door, only to relax a little as he saw the paramedics running toward him, he saw how few of them looked shocked, and other looked they were going to be sick anytime now, Steve hoped they are going to be fast about their job, before anything else was going to happen.
"This afternoon." Steve said making Peggy let out a sob at that, making her lose her footing and nearly fall to the floor if it wasn't for Howard rushing toward her to hold her. "What's going on Peggy? Am I finally going crazy?" Steve asked with a shaky voice, he can see Peggy trying to stop her tears from falling, he can see her shake her head at his question, he can see her give Howard the phone to read and reread the message…
"There is no mate." Steve ends up saying after an awkward period of silence which made Tony shuffle on his feet, and start walking once the Alpha regains his barrier and followed the Omega… this was awkward. It was just Tony's luck that his tongue became tied up now, where was his legendary sass when he needs it?
An hour later Tony's breathe hitched as his eyes took in the articles before him; his heart was pounding loudly in his chest as he kept on reading and rereading the articles he managed to steal from the archive. How could that even be? How did that even happen? Why? Why? Why? The only word that continued to chant in Tony's mind over and over and he reread the articles trying to make a sense.
." Tony explained, throwing Steve's words back at him, he actually prefers the first version Steve told him, it wasn't only original, but it was said with real feelings, instead of these instructions that Rogers seemed to follow just to gain his favor, Tony can see how Rogers' eyes sparkled, he was probably happy that Tony remembered his confession. "Look Rogers, this is sad, even for you this is so sad, how can you even accept changing who you truly are for a stranger?" Tony asked, wondering that the man will say next.
Tony laughed at his father's words, shaking all the while. "You know… when I was a brat, Mom… Mom made me promise her that whatever happens… that whatever you will do, that I will always stay by your side because we are family and family doesn't leave each other behind…" Tony said the words remembering his mother saying them on the night she died, a small but sad smile on her face like she already knows that she and Jarvis wouldn't be back. "And I had to remind myself of that stupid fucking promise, every time I pack my shit ready to run away, I had to remind myself of that promise when I left for MIT because if it was for me I would have never returned to New York again, I had to remind myself of that promise every time Obadiah showed his face trying to convince you to do one of his stupid shitty plans… but you know what? Enough was enough, I am tired of your shit, just leave Howard, please, leave me alone, you already did enough damage as it is." Tony plea with Howard taking a step back when the Alpha opened his mouth, and he ran to his lab, closing the door and refusing to come out even when his father continued to knock on the door for three hours straight pleading with Tony to talk with him, pleading with Tony to listen… the Omega did nothing other than hiding in the lab crying.
It's the year 2050 a lot of things changed, and a lot of things continued to change, after all, time changes everything…
"Yes, Bucky is alive in my world, but that didn't mean he is alive here." Steven's harsh words made Steve take a step back and swallow while looking at the man with betrayal. "And for your information, no, Bucky isn't my husband he is like a brother to me, he married Sharon Carter and had children and grandchildren of his own." Steven said which made Steve nearly trip at what he was hearing, face going a little pale at Steven's words, at that he shook Peggy's hand away from him and rushed out of the room, leaving the scent of pain and heartbreak in its wake making everyone shift in discomfort, and Peggy frown when she saw Tony leave the room, probably searching for the Alpha, which made Peggy stop herself from tracking the Omega down and stop him.
Tony took a seat on the chair near the bed, gazing at Steven with a thoughtful look on his face that turned into a sigh. "I wonder how someone as caring as you turned out to be Rogers counterpart, that man is an asshole." Tony grumbled, looking at Steven who was still asleep, wondering when the man will wake up. "You were right… I shouldn't have started something with Rogers… he is an asshole, and a cheater, it does consider as cheating when your boyfriend didn't break up with you until two weeks later of shackling with his ex, right?" Tony asked, his mood darkening even more at the reminder that yes, his boyfriend just broke up with him to run back to his ex, that was supposed to be dead.
Steven gave Philips a gentle smile when the man thanked him as he sat shakily and gaze around him, ignoring everyone's gaze.
"Marrried, don't make me laugh, sveethearrrt, both you and I knew zat yourrr marrriage is nothing but a sham. Do you vant to know what yourrr husband has been doing all zose months ago, neglecting you and yourrr kid? He has been banging his assistant in zat penthouse forrr months now, leaving you prrregnant and alone." The cruel laugh that followed that statement made Steve bite his lips hard, trying not to let those cruel words affecting him. "Yourrr husband doesn't love you, forrr him you verrre just toy he played vith until his prrrecious Pepper Potts kool down and forrrgave him forrr another mistake he made; he vould leave you, doll, his Daddy alrrready orrrderrred him to divorrrce you and marrry Miss Potts. I hearrrd zat separrration paperrrs should arrrive today orrr tomorrrow." Steve's tears couldn't help but fall faster at those words, he was too scared to fight with the man and deny what Steve knew was happening for months now.
"Tell me, Tony, how far along am I?" Steve asked hoping that the Alpha will answer him, desperately wishing that the Alpha will tell him the answer… but Tony only tense in his place looking like a dear caught in a headlight. Steve's heart gave a bang at that, and tears start streaming down his face at his husband's indirect answer. "It's a girl, just so you know what to tell your father when he asks." Steve breathed out, pulling away from Tony and marching back toward his car, ignoring the Alpha's calls of his name…
"Howard won't bother us anymore… I am sorry I took a long time to open my eyes, I am sorry sweetheart, I will change I promise, please come home, I am sorry." Tony whispered, kissing Steve's forehead as he held him tightly, causing the Omega to sniffle and hide his face in Tony's chest. "I left SI…" Tony whispered in Steve's ear, causing the Omega to gasp in shock and raise his head to gaze at Tony, not believing what the Alpha just told him; Tony had worked for years just to become SI's CEO, he sacrificed so many years for that position so why would he leave the company? "I was the wrong one, I admit, it took me a long time to see that. I left SI and Howard;
"Our room? No! We are not going to our room until you tell me where you have been! Did you know that I had to leave in the middle of an important meeting because you didn't stop calling me? Do you know what you did? I had one job, and that was to make Wakanda Enterprises sign a contract with us, one damn job, and you ruin it with your constant calling! And when I'm finally home, you tell me you were out without even telling me where! What the fuck, Steve?" Steve had to bite the inside of his cheek to stop a sob that wanted to get out, he never felt this small, not since he was fifteen years old nothing, who lived with a drunk and abusive father.
That thought scared him, it made Tony shiver and shake and fear that Steve will disappear every time he left his sight for a second. It was only Steve's kisses and embraces that kept Tony in line, made the Omega believe that this wasn't a dream that he will wake up from soon.
All the while Steve was trying hard to regain a footing in the jumping mess that was his mind, his fiancé was a Stark… why didn't he tell him? A lot of questions swirled in Steve's mind, but he knew one thing, Anthony was going to have a hell of explanation to give when he gets back, Steve will kick his ass. "Mr. Stark…" Steve said in a surprisingly strong voice, stronger than he felt at the moment. "I don't know what you were thinking of coming into my home and demand me to leave, but I love your son, and I am sure that by the end of the month, he will be back and he will explain what took place in here." Steve said as he throws the ID card back to Mr. Car-Stark, it made the Alpha pause and his amusement look to disappear.
"No, he was born in 1990." She murmured which made Steven hum while pressing his lips together in deep thoughts. "As for Tony's parents they died seven years ago, car accident, or at least that's what the official records say." Peggy said which made Steven close his eyes tightly taking deep breaths already knowing what that meant.
For those who asked about Peter's age, he is 10 years old in this fic, and Steve and Tony were apart for eleven years.
Soft and warm, that's what Tony felt, the gentle hand running through his hair, the warmth of the blanket surrounding him, the scent of health; soft, warm, and safe. Feelings that Tony didn't feel or scent for years upon years; part of Tony was happy, proud, dozy with such a healthy and content scent, making Tony's chest rumble, pleasure making his fingers and toes curls.
Steve dragged Bucky with him who was still looking at the door with fear, and he sighs at that nodding his head to Loki which made the Alpha pause a little like he couldn't believe that Steve was really back from England, but the dark-haired Alpha just nods his head back and prepare two beers for Bucky and Steve. "Yo, Wilson what got you down like this?" Bucky asked as he sat on Sam's right side while Steve took his left.
"Now, now, Steve, the pup's face become red, let go of him or I will stop you." Tony said with an amused smile that caused the Alpha to turn to Tony the twinkle in the Alpha's eyes caused the Omega to narrow his eyes at the huge Alpha, but it didn't stop the smile from taking over.
It took an hour for Clint and Natasha to get back with another mattress, an hour Natasha growled at him for when she saw that he hasn't eaten like she has instructed him, which made the teen buff his cheeks in hope of the woman won't shove the food down his throat. As Tony predicted Natasha and Clint helped him with the house, annoying the teen when they took heavy boxes from his hands and put them where he planned, but the teen felt warm on the inside, being cared for and loved by his new friends.
So, they are now in their fifth month. Steve had been shocked and a little surprised at the idea of another child at first, not that much because of the recent events. But Tony and Peter had squealed and danced around their house for days, the scent of happiness and joy making even Howard scrunches his nose to stop a twitch of his lips. As it happens, now Steve is getting what he wanted and wished for the right for a long time and he couldn't be happier about that.
"I… oh God, I was sleeping, I think, I don’t really know… anyway I was sleeping, and suddenly I start hearing voices, thousands of them. Then… then Steve's mother, her name is Saraious; she starts speaking, she told me that Thanos knows about Steve being here on earth and that he will come here, after he destroys Asgard to take Steve's heart. A war is coming, she told me, and that Thor needs to go back home to protect Asgard, because if Asgard is safe, then that means we can protect Steve and defeat Thanos. Oh God, the war is coming we need to do something!" Tony said in a rush, panic increasing with every word he said, the fear of him thrusting his baby into a war is too overwhelming.
"Mommy, did you see my picture… oh, hello…" The pup's sound made both Omegas look at the pup that shuffles toward his mother hiding behind him, which made a smile take over Maria's face as she looked at the small pup that was looking at her with a strange look on his face.
It made the pup pout and look around the room, holding into his toy and Shield tightly as he saw people surrounding the bed, he wanted his Papa… he looked around until his eyes fell on a woman with the same hair and eyes as his Papa, the woman was looking at him with teary eyes like she wanted to hug him but something was stopping her from doing that, she seemed familiar though like he saw her in someplace. "… 're you, grandma?" Peter asked remembering that he saw the woman's pictured in the paper his Mama has with him in the white room. That made the woman sob and nod her head furiously and wobble to the pup, hugging him tightly when the boy let go of the Shield, the pup didn't know what to do but he sniffs a little nuzzling the older woman who smelled like his Mama. "S-smell like Mama…" Peter said when the woman let go, which only made the woman sob at that.
Tony looked at the stranger that was standing near the door with suspicious eyes, pulling his baby tightly toward his chest after Peggy and Angie let go of the boy, he glanced at Steve who was smiling gently at the Alpha, who was she? It seemed that Peggy noticed his look and smiled gently at him. "She is my daughter…" Peggy said which made Tony's jaw fall a little for as long as he knew Peggy knew that she and her mate couldn't have children unless… unless the woman was adopted, the realization painted Tony's eyes and he turns to the female near the door and nods his head in greeting, which seemed to give the Alpha the courage she needs to step inside the room and wave toward the Omega and the pup.
"So that's it, after all, that Tony did to you, you choose to ignore everything and return to him?" Bucky asked, his harsh tone made Steve pause in his place before letting out a tired sigh, wondering why now of all times that Bucky decided to bring this up.
Tony stayed in his place for a few more minutes, not knowing how to act, and a part of his mind refusing to make any connection between the doll and Bucky Barnes. No, nope, nada, yadda, Bucky Barnes didn't turn into a doll, Bucky Barnes was probably away, trying to chase Steve's ass and force him to return his undying love, Bucky Barnes wasn't cursed into a doll because he threatened him about his doomed date with Steve, that was just Tony's imagination, that's it, that's the thing, it's Tony's imagination.
The AI answered which made Tony hum at that and smile at Peter who was trying to whistle as he washed his hands. "What do you want for lunch, Peter?" Tony asked as he dried the pup's hands and lead him upstairs, causing the small pup to grip into Tony's hand, which made the Omega give a small smile.
"Of course I am." Tony laughed, feeling like all the weight of the world leaving his shoulders, leaving him floating in his place as happiness bubbling inside him. Taking his father's arm Tony relaxed as the two of them walked out of the room until they reached the door that will take Tony to his future husband.
"Not against Thanos… I can't risk all of Midgard against Thanos… if I don't leave, Peter would get hurt Tony, do you want that?" Steve saw the moment that Tony broke, he saw the moment that pain and realization crossed Tony's face and Steve… Steve never hated himself as much as he did at this moment.
Tony doesn't know what to do, to be fair, he doesn't even know how to deal with a heat, the only time he had an ordinary heat was when he presented, the second he had Peter, so to be told that he was going into heat was a little jarring if he was fair with himself. If Tony wants to be honest to himself, he will admit that it was scary, that if it was up to Tony, he wishes to never have any heat again. But that was scientifically impossible unless he was barren, and having Peter defiantly told him that he was fertile, even if he had a strange way of dealing with heats by having them years and years apart and not every six months like healthy normal Omega.
Six years of Tony raising the little tyke with Steve, every day was a lovely adventure for the three of them, bringing nothing but creepy laughs and happiness as they tortured their chosen victim to death. Six years of engraving themselves as the family that no one should ever mess with, no matter how desperate someone was or how his want for revenge increased. Six years of raising the perfect little monster to be their successor and their boy were off to school, enjoying the humanity outside and what it offers on his first day… Tony was so proud…
A choked laugh left the young man as he tried to calm himself, not believing that he actually succeeded in running away, and the best of it, his mother was on his side, the young man knows that his mother loved him deep down in whatever left of her that wasn't destroyed by pills and depression and her trying to get over her husband hating her and her son for no reason, but it warmed Tony's heart to think that his mother still cared about him enough to go against Howard for one last time, even if it meant getting hurt in the end. When Tony checked the bag his mother gave him when he was out of Manhattan, he cried as he saw how much money in the bag, the few pieces of jewels that lay around, his grandmother's precious ruby necklace, the passport, and identity that informed everyone that his name was Anthony Carbonell, a twenty-three years old, and not Tony Stark, the eighteen years old kid of Howard…
Thor2 just gave him a smug smile, which made Tony bristle like a wet cat, he was too tired for this shit, he was tired and hurt, and his heart felt like it was about to break once more, and Tony would not stand here and let this knock-off God try something. "My name is Loki of Asgard, and I came here to pay my debt for the Ancient one for saving my life." Hearing that title made Tony take a sharp breath, clenching his hands into tight fists as he tried to calm down, even after a year, that title still made Tony feel hurt and unbalanced
"Can Mr. Stark teach me Kung Fu moves? Please, please, please, please!" Peter whined as he jumped around the place like a buzzing bee, going to Tony when Steve took too long to answer and sat on the Alpha's stomach which made the Alpha let out a whoosh of air at the weight that fell on him suddenly. "Mr. Stark, please!" Peter pleaded with the Alpha which snapped Tony and made him gaze at the cute pup who was giving Tony the cutest puppy dog eyes in the history of humanity.
The sound of small feet made the Alpha tense and looks at the stairs to see Petrus looking at him, and the Alpha didn't know what to do when the small boy looked at him with such an innocent look on his face, painted by shock and disbelief. "Petrus…" The Alpha called out gentle, which seemed to snap the small pup, and the babe turned around and start running downstairs leaving the Alpha frozen in his place…
Tony was so preoccupied with walking and dragging the heavy suit that he didn't notice the crater in front of him until he was about to fall in it which made him nearly made him have a heart attack if he didn't hold into the suit for dear life. Not that the danger of falling to his death was over, Tony cursed himself for not noticing the fucking hole in the ground that was probably three miles wide and a mile deep, how didn't he notice it? That was the question.
"For the hair, a short straight formal style will do nicely, as for the beard, please shave it off, just looking at it make me cry." Steve joked, his words causing the woman to give a laugh and nod her head, Bucky on the other hand was pouting fiercely, but Steve took it as a win when the Bucky didn't flinch in fear when the Alpha start working on his hair.
"Please don't…" Tony cut in whatever Sam wanted to say, taking a deep breath trying to calm himself before saying something that he will regret. "I'm fine; I finally made peace with, it so please don't… I don't want you to apologize for something that's done and can't be fixed." Tony's lips trembled as he forced these words out hoping that he won't start sobbing here and now.
And for everyone who didn't know, I posted a new spooky story 'The Soldier' to answer the spooky Halloween challenge I got, go check it out if you are interested!
"I'm so sorry, it's my fault; it's all my fault that you and Peter are here, I'm so sorry." Tony's voice cracked as he whispered these words, sobs were trapped in his throat choking him, refusing to leave his mouth. Tears were sliding down Tony's face, leaving a harsh trial of wetness that burned Tony's soul. "I'm so sorry…" Tony let out a shuddered breath, letting out an exhale that ended up with a sob.
Right now… right now, Tony was stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, if he stayed here, something might happen, Rogers might attack them or the town's people might change their minds about letting Tony be; either way, it would end up hurting his daughter, something that Tony tried to avoid. On the other hand, all connections Tony had with Rhodey and Pepper were cut; all the calls went directly to his father something that terrified Tony, rending him useless and helpless, not knowing what to do, but not willing to go and investigate last Howard managed to locate Morgan and take her away from him.
"I am happy." Steve grinned, wondering if he was going to embarrass himself in front of Bucky if he told him what happened. "Do you know where Tony is?" Steve asked instead, trying to ignore how Bucky frowned at the mention of Tony's name; it was probably because the two of them fought once more as they did in the past few weeks, but Steve wasn't going to let this ruin his good mood not when Tony was finally reaching out to him.
Unfortunately, what Tony got wasn't peace and quiet and a little nap as he hoped; what Tony got was a mad pounding on his workshop's door not half an hour ago, followed by the sound of an enrage Bucky as he spits a threat after threat, promising Tony a painful death if he didn't back out of his date with Steve. God, Tony never hated Bucky and his 'Steve's sense' as he does now because that sixth sense meant that Tony has to be prepared, for his lifespan that had shortened fifty years just now, not that his life span can go past forty with the kind of life he has.
Tony opened the door, getting inside, waiting for his friends to come in before closing the door, sheltering them from the cold. Tony smiled when he saw the awe on his friends' faces as they took the house in, he knows that the house was beautiful and homey on the inside, Peggy practically decorate the place, stating that she knows best, and she did, Peggy and her husband turned this place into heaven.
Steve had seen the teddy and the candy and thought it was a confession, had left this here and by the time he realised his mistake. . . Tony loosened his grip on the sketchbook and looked down at it. Carefully, he set the sketchbook down on the worktop, a slow smile spreading across his face. “You know,” he drawled, looking up at Steve, “I’m kind of offended.”
in love with Tony he really was. In love with a man who was so many million leagues above his own that it was hilarious.
Steve squeezed his eyes shut tightly and took a deep breath. It was the pictures he hated the most. The ones that some pap stole of them in their special booth in their favourite diner, of the two of them in terrible incognito outfits at a Mets game so they could enjoy it “properly” within the crowd, or the two of them walking together through some museum or gallery or other. They were so horribly intimate, Steve leaned over the table slightly and clinging onto every word, Steve staring at Tony while he screamed and cheered for a home run (after declaring baseball was a boring, pointless sport), Steve’s hand on Tony’s lower back as he guided him toward his favourite painting. Any idiot could take one look at those photos and see how embarrassingly, obviously,
In the smallest, saddest voice he had ever heard from the man, he replied with two words. He sounded defeated.
Thoughts of a morning run flew out his head completely as he gathered all his items and fled back inside of his quarters, slamming the door as if somebody were going to appear and snatch them out his hands. Or worse, one of the Avengers was going to appear to laugh at his stupid face and the whole thing would turn out to be a prank. After all, everybody and their Mother knew about Steve’s feelings for Tony. It was like Nat said, he wouldn’t have lasted five minutes as a spy with what an awful liar he was. Steve had always worn his heart on his sleeve, and he had never been ashamed of that, but it was damned inconvenient when he was desperately trying to hide the fact that he was madly in love with his best friend. His teammates teased him about it all the time, trying to goad Steve into finally making a move, insisting that he was being ridiculous, but Steve knew better. Even the press seemed to know, publishing a long series of articles on how Steve and Tony always seemed to be spotted together and looking at the pictures…
Everything was different now though. Steve was big and strong and objectively attractive, people stared at him with an appreciative gaze that he had never known before. Dames would use that smile on him that they used to use on Bucky, tuck their hair behind their ears and laugh at jokes that really weren’t that funny. He tried not to wonder if they would have spared him a second glance before. He still didn’t go on many dates.
“Oh Tony, I’m so sorry,” he was cut off before he could actually thank the man properly and he frowned a little, annoyed that Steve kept cutting him off. Tony was the one who talked too much in this relationship after all. Steve continued though, looking so anxious that Tony was almost worried that he might pass out on the workshop floor. “I’m so sorry. You must be so angry at me, I didn’t – it wasn’t supposed to be creepy, you were never supposed to see them.” Tony was growing more confused by the second, did someone else leave the sketchbook here? “You don’t – and that’s fine, I mean, it’s fine Tony. And I can control myself, I can keep my feelings to myself, I can – I have!” It was kind of hard to follow what the fuck Steve was talking about when the man kept stuttering and changing track, looking anywhere other than Tony’s eyes. “I just—misunderstood, that’s all. This morning. Your gifts, I, ah—I misread it. I didn’t. . . see everyone else’s.” The man’s skin was bright red, embarrassment written all over his features, “so I’m sorry. I’ll just—I’ll just take that back,” he reached for the sketchbook, “and then we can forget this ever happened, okay?”
Tony blinked. His mind worked a thousand miles an hour and even he was confused at what Steve was trying to say here. Even still, he took a protective step back and wrapped his arms more tightly around the sketchbook when Steve threatened to take it, watching surprise flicker over the handsome soldier’s face. “Steve,” he said evenly, “no offence, but I have no idea what you’re talking about. What do you mean ‘I don’t?’ I don’t what? You didn’t mean this?” He felt his heart breaking in his chest and Steve looked about as bad as Tony felt.
"Please, stop…" Steve whispered, trying to ignore the heartbroken look that crossed over Bucky's face, taking a step back when the Alpha raised his hand to touch Steve's cheek. "Please don't make this harder than it is…" Steve whispered, turning his back to Bucky as he returns to back his clothes, trying to ignore the way Bucky let out a shuddered breath before he left the room, slamming the door shut behind him.
"How many times did I tell you not to run away? Do you want me to tell your Mommy about you misbehaving?" The woman said which got a pout from the pup that was looking at the ground.
Sam sighs as he looked at the floor in thoughts; he blinks as he saw a small white card on the floor, he leans down to pick it up and his lips twitch down a little as he saw the name Tony Stark written in elegant handwriting. He looked up to see if the Omega was still around, but when he didn't see him anywhere he looked at the card and opened it.
And finally, Tony gets a grip of his life, finally the pain of losing his pup didn't hurt as much as it used too, but sometimes when he was alone at night, it hurt to even think about it, but in the end, Tony knew he got his friends.
"You? Apologize?" Steven asked as he stopped laughing, ignoring the pain he felt in his belly due to the stab wound. "That is funny, very funny. Do not tire yourself, foolish king; I got used to it, after all, this wasn't the first child I carried in my womb you ended up being the reason they were killed." Steven stated darkly, an emotionless smile stretched on his lips; Steven took a dark pleasure in the shock and denial on the king's face. Interesting, so the king can kill babes from other villages without a care in the world, but when it comes to someone under his watch, he can't handle it.
Tony growled as he stalked toward his mansion, planning on killing Steve on the spot; this was it! He was done, so, so done! It was on thing to have Steve stalk him and be creepy, it was another that his cousin comes and threatened Tony like she own him. Tony was so going to find Steve and give him a good kick between his legs, while wearing his armor! No one, not even Barnes will stop him from taking his revenge on that crazy Addams; if only there was a way for Tony to cause Steve to fall out of love.
"Peter!" The pup said happily pointing at his small chest which made the Alpha let out a happy laugh and nuzzle the pup that giggled and start jumping in his lap.
"What do you know about him? Did you know about Tony's plans of eloping with him?" Peggy questioned the Beta which made his face darkens even more.
The Alpha let out a happy sigh that turned into a moan when the Omega starts massaging his scalp, letting out happy noises when the Omega didn't stop. "Amazing… Peter was amazing… he is so smart, smarter than me even…" Tony murmured as his eyes took in the beautiful Omega in front of him, wondering if their talk yesterday after Barnes left was working somehow, I mean the Omega did let him stay the night before, they did talk most things through before the Omega shy from a few topics, and the Omega did let him spend time with his son, and was massaging his scalp! So maybe… the Alpha let out a sigh as he melted into the sofa, a reaction that Tony always has because of Steve's magical hands.
Howard walked toward his bed, standing over Steve, gazing at him with unreadable eyes that made Steve more concerned than he ever was when he was forced to deal with Howard. "I hate you, I'm sure that you are aware of that." Howard stated, and Steve knew if he had the strength, he would have given Howard a piece of his mind; after all, who in their right mind will start their conversation with a dying person like this?
Turning to the grave of the poor idiot who angered Steve, Tony nearly flinched when he read the name on the headstone… Oh my God… No, no; just no! Why the fuck are they standing near Stane's grave? Wasn't that bastard ash right now? Tony was sure he paid for Stane to be turned into ashes and be dumped into a pig's pen! "Oh, no, nope, nada, yadda, I'm outta here, sorry, but nope!" Tony stated, slipping out of Steve's arms as he tried to make a run for it, only to let out a squeak when Steve pulled him back by his jacket suit and throw him over his left shoulder like a sack of potatoes, the metal arm holding him tightly was the only reason Tony didn't thrash and was content with holding his breath in fear… Tony knew that this date was a bad idea! He knew he will die on this day!
"Tony, please, run…" Steve plead, standing on his shaky legs as he tried to pull Tony away; Tony was not ready to fight Thanos, no matter how strong Tony think he was he would never reach the level of strength the Mad Titan possess, especially with him owning three Infinity Stones in his possession. Tony seemed unfazed by Steve's plea, unmoved; it was Tony who attacked first, blasting Thanos with missiles, trying to distract Thanos; before Steve managed to pull Tony away, Tony attacking Thanos relentlessly while kicking Thanos with his enhanced boosters before he could recover.
"Oh? And here I thought that my invitation was lost in the mail." Ty smiled as those words left him, his eyes though, they were dark and promising pain, but Tony stilled himself, he wasn't that weak man anymore, he was Tony Stark, he was Iron Man, not the shaky crying mess that Ty left in 2008. "I see you have replaced me already; I admit he is pleasant to the eye, but tell me Tones, does he make you sing as I did?" Ty's smile was full of teeth as he leaned toward Tony, causing Tony's hand to shake before hiding in his pocket.
"Not important for you to know." The woman stated as she stood up, tilting her head to the side as she studied Tony with a frown on her face. "So you are the Normal, my cousin is in love with… interesting." The woman stated as she starts circling Tony, whose eyes widen and realization struck him.
"What happened, darling?" Steve asked, taking the boxes of sweets in his left hand while his right was on Tony's lower back as he guided the Omega to the house, where Peter was looking at them with wide eyes, probably wondering what happened and why Harley was sleeping in Tony's arms.
Margaret asked as she leaned on the bars gazing around the place like a frightened dear inspecting the place for any predators, which made Steven's heart give a small pang at the fear he saw in Margaret's eyes, Margaret who did not fear the Hydra king himself was left shivering by the sight of the Iron king alone.
Until his father jumps and let go to call the nurses, he couldn't… wouldn't, believe it, Tony refused to believe that his baby was dead, no his baby was alive…
"Yup, the one and only…" The Alpha said with a small grin which caused the boy to start hopping in his lap, ignoring that only a few minutes ago he was angry and sad that the Alpha didn't show up, and it caused the older man to laugh at that a little, at how his son ignored everything else if he felt that something important was coming up.
Hearing that, Steve ignored everything around him as he rushed toward his hotel room, gathering his stuff before rushing to the airport, using one of Howard's private jets to arrive in NY all the while he nearly ripped his hair off all the way until he reached home. Part of Steve was angry at his oversight, wondering how did Peggy know about his home, wondering what she did to his husband and children; another part was blaming Steve, growling at how idiot he was, wondering why he didn't bring his family with him to DC.
14-Leitaðu að öllum; sjáðu hver er með ullarþræði í vinstri úlnliðnum. -Search everyone; see who is wearing a thread of wool in his left wrist.
"Where is this 'Howard' you are talking about, Lady Natasha?" Thor asked which made Natasha frown a little thinking.
"Just let me go get my coat and the three of us can go." Tony said with a small smile as he rushed to the living room to get his coat from the back of the sofa, cursing himself for being an idiot by putting it here and not on the hanger near the front door, he returned to the pair to see Steve talking with the small pup, and he had to smile when he saw that the little fella was more awake then a few seconds ago.
"So are you going to tell me how to make that superior armor?" Tony asked his eyebrows wiggling, causing Steve to let out a breathless laugh as he shook his head, no, a happy smile taking over Steve's face, probably the first one in years by the look of it.
Tonton was bright, and he had his whole life in front of him, ready to take the world by storm, but what broke his heart was that Tonton was betrayed by the closest person to him, and was killed for it, the boy was no older than fifteen summers when he was killed by his uncle, it was cruel, it was heartless, and Tonton's head was put on a stake to the whole tribe to see, as the people cried and wailed for the boy and for the dark fate waiting for them.
"Thor, buddy, what are you doing? Get away from him before he tries and attack, it's not pretty when he goes into his fit." Tony said as he took a step toward Thor and Steven causing the star to raise his eyebrow and look at the metal-clad Midgardian with a raised eyebrow, he never thought that Midgardians were that foolish, but again, they were still infants since the last time he gazed at them, they made a big step by making those 'Trains'.
The king looked like he swallowed something bitter as he came and took a seat on the wooden chair beside the bed; his actions only causing Steven to frown, for he doesn't want to see anyone at this moment, he still wants to find whatever sliver of peace he can achieve as he mourns the babe that died in his womb. "I came here because… I want to apologize, I-" Whatever the king wanted to say after that was cut off; he raised his eyes that widen by the second to glance at the Omega who start laughing loudly, cutting him from saying anything more.
"He is going to kill Howard." Natasha said as she took the envelope and read what was written on it, which made everyone look at Natasha who stood up and looked at the team with a grime face.
"And why is that?" Steve asked the pup gently as he returned to washing the dishes, trying to calm his beating heart as he put the last dish in the dishes rack, before unplugging then sink, he turned to Peter after that, drying his hands in the small towel near him with a smile on his face hoping to put the pup at ease.
A heavy accented voice stated behind Steve making the Omega blink his eyes in confusion and turn to the speaker, raising his eyebrow when he saw an old Beta man with glasses behind him, the Beta was humming and looking around the place with wonder on his face; now what got Steve's shocked was not the strange words that the man spoke to him (Steve finally placed the accent, Germany.) but what the man was wearing. In addition to the glasses, the man was wearing a lab coat over his button-up and pants that were held by suspenders. the man surveyed the sweets on the shelves without turning to Steve, making Steve wonder to himself if the Beta meant him or was talking to himself.
In the end, Steve couldn't go, he couldn't because parks only open in the morning, noon, afternoon, and Steve only wakes up after the sunset. It made Steve a little angry and hurt; especially when he can perfectly hear what's going around him. Steve was never truly unconscious when he sleeps; he can still hear and understand what is going on around him, Steve only lacks the will over his own body to react, which wasn't fair at all.
"Oh." Howard blinked his eyes, raising his head from the newspaper that Tony desperately tried to ignore; his father didn't even pay any attention to him! "Well, we decided that you are old enough to live on your own, you didn't seem like you need us with the Iron Man gage you have and the company which seems to be doing great; good for you," Howard stated after he flipped the page of his newspaper ignoring the full-bodied twitch that Tony did after hearing Howard's stupid reasoning.
So why would he be stupid as to endanger his only chance of being something, of changing the world into a better place for that…
"She is adorable!" Sarah said as she came to stand beside Tony, her smile is wide as she gazed at her granddaughter with happiness shining clearly in her eyes. A chuckle left Tony's lips as he saw the older woman coo at Morgan, purring happily when the baby took Sarah's finger in her tiny fist after letting go of Peter who was looking at his finger like it held all the secret of the universe.
"Tony…" Bruce's tired voice made Tony jump from his chair, rushing to his friend hoping that he will have good news that will be a cold palm to him already broken heart; Tony wanted to scream and shout, and order Bruce to tell him what happened, why did they take so long when a stab wound can be treated faster than this?
Steve's laugh was as light and airy, captivating as he seemed to shine brightly and beautifully, Tony knows without a doubt that everyone must have realized that Steve was another being completely, especially when his glow seemed to lighten the entire ballroom the gala was taken place in. Tony wondered if people lost their breath as they gazed at Steve who seemed happy and carefree at this moment without the world weighing him down.
So three hours they spent searching the house from top to bottom, three hours spent with Steve containing his screams of pain, three hours of that retched singing turning to a wailing, three hours and… nothing… nothing at all! Steve tried to stop himself from acting crazier than normal, stopped himself from banging his head on the walls, stopped himself from breaking Stane's face when he looked at them with a smug look, stopped himself from going to Peggy whose face was getting full of tears and frustration as Natasha shook her head once more… Steve nearly screamed when he heard the words of the song more clearly… something that never happened until today...
It was ten years since the last time he gave the sweet Omega anything but a fleeting thought; it has been so long since he got a reminder about the heartbreak he faced when the love of his life didn't show up on the day he promised him he would. He didn't show up on the day after it, or the month after it, or the years after that day; it only confirmed his theory, that the Omega he fell in love with has moved on, that he found someone who was stronger than Anton, smarter than Anton, someone who will give him whatever his heart desire, someone who will worship the ground that the sweet Omega walked on.
At first, everything was rough, especially with Harley still refusing to trust anyone that wasn't Steve or Peter; everyone was thrown back to square one, especially Betty, who didn't know what to do after Harley relapsed. Everyone thought that Harley was doing fine, the little boy stopped flinching at the sight of Omegas, he can even make a small conversation with them to some extent… no one knew that Harley was forcing himself to do that, until after Steve prompted him to talk, did everyone know.
without feeling awkward about it, Peter was as cute as always sneaking in Tony's house more often than not which ended with Steve or Sarah sometimes Bucky knocking on his door an hour later, Peter was getting the therapy he needed, Steve even told him that he can see some changes in the small pup, which made Tony hopeful that the little one will be all healed. Though what Tony would have hoped to avoid was his friends teasing and cooing about him being in love with the Alpha, as much as he wanted to deny that, he couldn't, because his flushed face always exposed him.
"Colonel James Rhodes, Tony's best friend, but you may call me Rhodey." It was then that Tony paled, Rhodey had never told anyone to call him by his nickname unless they were friends or people he was really interested in. Tony flinched as he leaned outside his hiding place, taking in how Rhodey and Rogers chatted for a few more minutes; Tony let out a silent whimper when he saw Rhodey chuckle and try to engage Rogers more into their conversation… it seemed that Rhodey wasn't immune to the Rogers spell… Rhodey was like Pepper now… cursed…
"Well, then I wanted to introduce you to one of your biggest fans in the whole world, Peter!" Steve said as he pulls Peter gently in front of him which made the pup look at his father then at the Omega, the Omega blinked his eyes not expecting that but a small smile took over his face at the realization. "Peter, say 'Hi' to Mr. Tony Stark, you know the engineer." Steve said which made the pup look at Tony's face and for his little mouth to open in shock; it was amusing to Steve and Tony to see the pup's face turning red as a blush took over his face.
Steve doesn't know what happened, or how he did it; one second he was screaming and begging his useless body to wake up, and the next he was standing over a woman, a broken chair in his hand, and the woman's unconscious body on the ground. "Peter…" Steve's voice cracked as he called out; gazing around the place as he swayed on his feet, fear gripping him tightly when he didn't see the small boy anywhere. "Peter!" Steve's voice became louder as he called out, his breath coming in fast buffs as he let go of the broken chair, taking shaky steps hoping that Peter is fine.
“Why you…” Tony growled trying to control himself before he attacked the woman, something that he was sure Sarah wouldn’t let it pass, if she didn’t make a scene in front of Steve if he did. “You say you are proud of Steve and Peter daily, but once they made a choice on their own you turn batshit crazy! What does that make you? A hypocrite person, that’s what! You are implying that I’m trying to replace my dead son with Peter, and that’s a low blow, even for you, because both Peter and Steve know about my son, just like how I know about Peggy; I was never the one that hides things from Steve, unlike someone who is trying desperately to control his life! You are treating Steve like he is just a small child while ignoring the fact that he is 36 years old man with his own life and a child of his own!” Tony ended up shouting causing the woman to back away a little, the shock painting her face before she hides it with a scowl. “This is not the Sarah Rogers I know; not the woman who always try to paint a happy smile on everyone’s face, not the woman who got out of her way to befriend me and treat me like a son, you are not the woman that Steve always smiles with pride at the mention of her, nor the woman that Peter adore! You, Ma’am, are nothing but a domineering bitch who tries desperately to control her son’s life refusing for him and his child to recover, always letting them live in fear.” A noise came from somewhere, but neither Tony nor Sarah paid any attention to it, both glaring at each other heatedly, trying to intimidate the other into submission. “You need to get a reality check before it is too late because one day Steve will realize what you are trying to do, and then surprise, surprise, he will realize that all this time, he was just dealing with another Peggy Carter.” That was what finally cracked Sarah, her eyes widen in shock as she took a step back in disbelieve; Tony doesn’t even feel proud of himself for what he did, for he never thought that a day like this will come, him lashing out at the woman he looked up to, a woman that both Steve and Peter adore. “Good day to you Ma’am I will escort myself out.” Tony gritted out before turning around ready to leave, only to pause when he noticed Winnie standing in the hallway with wide eyes.
The station attendants don't comment on the bruises, the swelling around his eye, or the cut on his brow that stopped bleeding. They stare at his shaking hands as he pulls off his gloves and hands over the money, the knuckles skinned and red-raw. He pays in cash only, anonymous and untraceable, and keeps his head down. There are cameras everywhere, and maybe its paranoia, maybe the bastard's reach doesn't extend as far as he claims, but Tony isn't taking any chances. He pays in crumbled bills, hoarded over years and months for this moment, and then he kept on moving, never staying in one place for more than it takes him to refuel and go to the bathroom.
"He… he is in shock…" Starkad murmured, his eyes darting around the place trying to find something that will help him stop the bleeding, not finding anything, Starkad cursed as he ripped his left sleeve, and pressed it to the Omega's abdomen, trying to lessen the bleeding if he couldn't stop it.
"I'm sorry…" Tony smiled gently as he looked at the small boy who was scuffing his feet on the ground; Harley looked up when he heard Tony's words, giving a shrug and looking down once more. "This probably sucks; you probably wanted to enjoy your day with Steve and Peter, I'm sorry for spoiling your day." Tony leaned on the tree behind him, his eyes not leaving the thin boy who was now playing with the hem of his sleeve nervously.
After that day, things moved fast and slow at the same time. Tony finally moved into his new home, and he was the happiest he was since he was young; he met a lot of his neighbors, and befriended a lot of them which was a fate by itself! He even planned with Pepper on opening their own company in clean energy, far away from weapons and deaths.
Steven stopped his munching on the bracelets with a frown… those words were actually quite familiar like he heard it once; when Steven understood what that thing said he snarled and turned to it, planning on pummeling it down. "I am not insane!" Steven's heart pounded in his chest as his heart start hurting… he was called by that name again… he was called an insane one again, by a lesser being no less, a being that didn't stay with him a full day was calling him insane… everyone called him that, everyone thinks that he has lost his mind, he had lost his sanity for falling in love with a Midgardian, he was insane for refusing the son of Odin as his future king, he was insane for saving Loki, he was insane for having his shine dulled by a broken heart… he was always called that, always treated and bullied like he was nothing but debris that was floating in space… and this… this thing! Dared to call him the insane one!
Steve had always been good at seeing the good parts of people. Tony did his best to make it difficult, to hide how much he cared. To hide concern and hurt and anything that resembled compassion between quips and jokes and sarcasm, but how he showed it in the way that every stitch of Steve’s suit was perfect, how every time he received it back, it was just a little bit safer. Steve saw it in the way that Tony was involved in the Maria Stark foundation more than anyone would have imagined, how he actually attended the STEM camps for underprivileged children and how he constantly worked hand in hand with medical professionals on his own dime to utilise arc reactor tech for medical technology. Steve saw it in the way that Tony would coincidentally be up at the same time as him on the nights where the ice wouldn’t leave his skin, the way he happened to be making Jarvis’ special hot chocolate recipe and
The man looked like he’d been shot when he saw the book in Tony’s arms, which made confusion shoot through him. Did Steve think he was crying because he didn’t like it or something?
He squeezed the stuffed bear tightly and set his jaw. All he had to do now was show that much to Tony, and he knew exactly how to do it.
After all, there was only one person he was interested in spending the holiday with, and he wouldn’t give Tony the time of day. Spending the time staring at what he couldn’t have wasn’t exactly going to put him in a great mood. No, it was better for him to stay out of the way and get some work done instead of ruining the holiday for everyone else.
Tony liked the way he looked. Steve knew that too. He caught the way that Tony’s eyes wandered when Steve returned from his run, or the way Tony stared when he dressed up for an event. Honestly, the man didn’t exactly try very hard to hide it. Steve had been subject to numerous comments about his ass in the Captain America suit or his biceps when he worked out – not to mention Tony’s running tally on the kitchen fridge
He crouched down and picked up the offerings, his smile spreading as he considered the gifts. The first was a stuffed bear coloured like Captain America. It was horribly tacky and Steve
Steve could certainly understand that. The fact that they were both Avengers was definitely one of the important reasons that Steve had decided to keep his feelings locked away instead of coming clean to Tony. Their relationship had always been fragile, rocky, easily combustible in a way that it wasn’t with anyone else on the team. It took almost six months for them to be able to stay in the same room for an hour without a room-shaking argument breaking out between the two of them. They had always been able to bring out the worst in one another, get under each other’s skin and dig their claws into where it would hurt the most. Tony was just able to set Steve off, strip away all his hard earned and carefully maintained patience like it was
The genius jumped, fumbling with the book in his hands at the sudden intrusion. He spun around quickly, his stomach dropping as he saw Steve in the doorway looking harried and desperate. Tony probably looked like an idiot, his eyes red rimmed and clutching the book to his chest like it was his most prized possession.
he had enough for two, “since you’re already here.” In the way that Tony talked crap about Bruce’s tea non-stop but knew every flavour and what it meant about the man’s mood, in the way he took Natasha to the ballet, in the way he let Thor put dents in the armour on bad days, in the way he always had time to help Clint with his trick arrows, no matter how busy he was.
It hurt worse than every disappointed look, every time a dame checked her watch, every time she joked under a breath about a swap when they thought Steve couldn’t hear. It hurt more than every time he’d been stood up, every time he’d spent Valentine’s Day all alone. Humiliation burned hot in his gut and he realised that if he didn’t beat Tony to the gift he had left in his lab, he was going to ruin
“Please tell me you didn’t open it,” Steve begged, keeping his distance from Tony in a way the billionaire really didn’t like. Wasn’t this the part where they threw themselves into each other’s arms and confessed their love? God, he really was watching way too many of Steve’s awful rom-coms.
Steve got to be human. And when the smoke cleared and the dust settled, Steve realised that Tony made him feel more alive than he had since before the ice. It didn’t matter that he hated the man, he didn’t hesitate to accept his offer of moving into the tower, much to Tony’s apparent surprise. But he didn’t ask, and Steve offered no explanation, and slowly but surely, they began to bond.
Wordlessly, he spun on his heel and stumbled toward the elevator, slamming the button with too much force and ignoring the concerned cries of his teammates that followed behind him.
Really, it was so annoying that Tony's teeth nearly shattered as he grind them to try and stop his snarl from leaving his throat; out of all time for everyone to make his life a living hell, they decided to do it on his wedding day? Just why? Tony never did anything wrong and tried to destroy their lives and happiness so why were they trying to do this to him? It took Serpentine sending those uncultured fiends one harsh look followed by a murderous glare from both Steve and Tony for everyone to be seated once more, looking like they were forced to swallow a lemon as the wedding continued before their very own eyes. Tony was sure he heard a heart or several breaking when he and Steve kissed passionately in front of everyone, which made Tony happier than he had the right to be; serve them well, who do they think they are for standing in the way of his wedding and happiness? Tony was so going to kill and poison everyone who showed up to his wedding after this. Most of the Addams family seemed to share his opinion and sentiment because he was so sure, that they actually cast a hex or two at the normal guests who showed up; Tony just have to ask Serpentine to remove the hex from Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy, because those three actually stood with Tony in this one, not against him, even with their massive crush on Steve.
As soon as Jarvis finished, the door to the communal floor was blast opened and Wanda walked through them with a blood lust grin on her face; Steve's eyes could only widen, and his heart pounded in his chest, Steve could only thank his luck that he managed to convince Bruce to take Peter away from the tower to Pepper's apartment, because from the look of it, the tower was going to be destroyed as well, just like the mansion. "I found you…" The witch grinned as she tried to attack Tony, only for Natasha to try and shoot her.
' and offering to pay Steve to fuck off Tony's life. For his husband to kiss Pepper Potts, is Tony admitting that Howard wins and that Steve was really nothing but a plaything that his husband was going to leave in the end, ignoring how the Alpha already impregnates him and was going to be a father in a month and a half. "Fuck you for accusing me of something you know I would never do no matter what, and fuck you for cheating on me and letting Howard win in his stupid games! If you are going to end up with that bitch from the start why marrying me in the first place, huh? Why force me into this stupid life if you are just going to leave me after you put a baby in me? Was it a game for you? Did you enjoy it, you bastard?" Steve's screams caused Tony to take a step back, especially when the Omega continued to cry and sob, unable to handle it any longer… to think that Steve was this stupid to believe Tony really loved him.
." Peter's soft voice was heard, and Steve wanted, he wanted to sit up and smile at the boy and tell him that it was OK, that Steve will be the one who will take him to the park today, so he doesn't need to be sad. Again, defying him, his body refused to listen to Steve's order, holding him a prisoner until it deemed it alright to let him go.
"Could you please explain?" Mr. Barnes rumbled at him, narrowing his eyes darkly, merely for his wife to dig her elbow in his ribs with a scowling making the man back off. "What, I said please!" The man roared only for his wife to roll her eyes and send him a threatening glance, leading to the said man to groan and rub his abused side.
Steve let out a heartbroken sigh as he gazed at the crystal ball in front of him; he still remembered his encounter with Tony, how the love of his life just rejected him, breaking his already fractured heart. Steve really thought that he found his one and only; Tony, the beauty that dazzled Steve, the one who isn't afraid and flirt with death daily, with a sharp aim and even sharper wits that made Steve just want to rip his heart and present it to him; maybe even ask him about what kind of deal he did with the devil to be able to live with shrapnel in his heart because that was some amazing deal to be had if Tony still wasn't answering to Lucifer who will never allow someone who will give his soul to help another.
"He was scary." Pepper said as she walked inside of the room with Matt, Matt was called because Tony wanted his lawyer to charge Howard for the idiotic decision he made when he talked his lawyers into giving him a way to make the Omega gave his pup to him and giving the Omega a restraining order to prevent him from seeing his pup. "He rushed toward the lift we were in without a care for the security behind him, and start mouthing off the second I told him that the elevator was not for workers or public, his order even overridden mine." Pepper said with a sigh as she looked at Howard with a scrunched nose in distaste as the Alpha was finally able to sit on the ground when Jarvis finally sat his nose.
Steve took a shuddered breath at that as he brought Tony tightly toward his chest, kissing his head as he starts rocking the Omega trying to calm him down, crooning to him, until the Omega stopped crying, but he was still clutching Steve's shirt in his own hands. "I can't say I know what you feel like Tony… but I can say I went through something similar once upon a time… thank you… for not breaking my trust." Tony heard the Alpha whisper quietly, so quietly that Tony was sure those words were not meant to be heard, but the Omega heard them anyway and he nodded his head, taking deep breaths, breathing in his lover's scent, calming himself down even farther…
To Steve's surprise, Thanos stopped in his advance gazing at Tony up and down before his face darkened; Steve's breath nearly stopped at the furious gaze Thanos sends Tony. "So you are the one who dared to touch my bride," Thanos stated, his face getting darker with every word he spoke, and Steve couldn't help but expect the worse to come… Steve had to think of something, Steve had to find a way to save Tony. "It saddens me what I am about to do, Tony Stark, I thought you would have made a wonderful addition as one of my children, especially with us being cursed with knowledge… but you have touched my bride, unforgivable…" Thanos hissed as he took a step after step, the sound of clashing weapon, broken bones, and stabbed skin resume once more through the battlefield.

Harley seemed to pause at Tony's words, shifting in his place before nodding his head, a blush taking over his face causing Tony to chuckle and offer his hand to Harley, waiting until the boy gathered himself enough before taking Tony's hand, walking beside Tony when the Omega went to introduce him to Howard, who finally get out of the kitchen only to pause when his eyes fell on Harley.
Once Peggy and Tony stood near them, Steven could feel the tension from the two of them, it made him concern especially when Bruce and Clint (Who told them that the two of them were Omegas) start fidgeting a little, even Natasha who was an Alpha didn't look Peggy in the eyes. "Well, Anthony, don't you have something to share with Steven?" Peggy hissed which made Tony flinch and bite his bottom lip.
It was nearly half an hour later when Steve finishes talking with the doctor and going to the receptionist to book another appointment before he was back. He didn't know what Peter and Tony talked about, but it made him smile when he saw Tony carrying Peter, while talking to the smiling boy, the sparkle in Peter's eyes was worth it as he waved a watch and looked at it from every angle he can, which made Steve raise his brow at that, but Peter seemed to be amused and happy so he didn't scold the pup.
"OK… apology accepted." Tony said, running his hand through his hair, wondering how this was his life now, at first he was hit by a star, then the star turned out to be a human who hated him, then the star ended up giving him a chance after Peter gave him his puppy eyes? He seemed to have underestimated his baby's luck.
"Sure, why not?" Steve joked, letting out a satisfied sigh when he finished the ice cream, when he looked up, he frowned when he saw that it was time for him to go home. "I need to get home Nat, I have to start working; if you come over tomorrow I will be done with the portraits by then." Steve smiled at his friend and agent, getting ready to leave, only to be stopped by Natasha who raised his messenger bag and raising her eyebrow at his forgetfulness, causing Steve to chuckle sheepishly; he didn't know what he would have done without Natasha and her always saving him.
Natasha drags Clint off to a different booth, giving Tony a knowing look, which made him flush in happiness at how considerate his friends. Tony, Pepper, and Rhodey took another booth, letting out a sigh of relief as they picked up the menu from the stand that holds them, chatting on what to choose, while Tony promising them both that whatever the two of them decided on it will be worth it.
Just like Steven thought, trying to finish a week's worth of work in one day is near impossible, even with the help of his baby who refused to let him work alone with no help, which as much as it was sweet, the Omega knew it was taking a lot from his babe. Working for that arrogant king was tiring and it was mentally draining, and the Omega knew that the king was doing it on purpose, trying to make him back away on his word, waiting for him to quit and condiment his friends' lives to Hel, but Steven will not do that, he will show that arrogant bastard what he was made of.
After that week of bonding, Steve, Tony, and Peter finally emerge from their home, not only, ignoring the teasing comments from their friends, but enjoying the fact that they were family now. It wasn't like they weren't considering themselves a family before… there was just something missing, something that they three finally found.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, cursing, sadness, fluff, horror elements, poor Tony, and finally, the baby is here! All reviews are appreciated.
Wanda screamed in rage as she runs at him, trying to tackle him into the ground and beat him for what he did; fortunately for Steve, she didn't manage to reach him, especially when Tony raised one of his repulsors and fired, hitting the witch and slamming her into the floor which rends the witch unconscious. "Steve…" Tony's relieved look turned into one of horror, and when Steve turned behind him to see why he could only stumble back when he saw Nebula standing behind him, the guardians were unconscious but Gamora was the worse of them because of her broken legs and broken right arm.
"In your car? Baby, I left the not near the nightstand before I went to work, I know nothing about the note you are talking about." Tony said, shifting nervily in his place, causing Steve's breath to hitch as dread took over him replacing the happy feeling he had.
"Natasha broke my phone." Steve waved his hand after he entered the office making Peggy give a tired groan at that…
Tony was able to hold Steve a hostage in his bed for one hour before the Omega said enough is enough and marched toward Peter; at first, Tony was against that, wanting Steve to get all the rest he can get so that he will recover (And spend as much time as he can with him before he was forced to give his time with Steve to their friends and family). The thing was, Steve was perfectly fine; he was good, feeling like he could take on the world by a storm. Breathing was never as it was now; moving too, it was addictive moving around the place without pain and hurt sneaking around him and weighing him down.
it. A bag of his favourite candy sat next to it, and finally a single red rose. It made his heart warm to think that one of his teammates must have left this here, that they even remembered his favourite candy. They were old-fashioned, like the rest of him maybe, but he couldn’t help it. Candy had been such a rarity when he was growing up, never something that they could afford and inevitably something that became even harder to source during war time. He remembered Bucky encouraging him to have an exaggerated coughing fit outside a sweet shop back when they were eight or nine, remembered how Bucky looked at the shop-keep wide eyed and innocent and sad in the saddest little voice. “Sorry for the disturbance Sir, he doesn’t have long left. He just wanted to look s’all.” It had been the first caramel cream and he’d never forgotten the taste as Bucky and he shared the little bag.
He felt his heart race slowly build as he started flipping through the pages, his own face staring back at him on almost every page, or his hands, or his eyes, or his suit. The first sketch was dated two years ago and he recognised what it was instantly. Tony in his Black Sabbath shirt, this arrogant smirk on his face that made him look punchable, throwing a blueberry into the air. The helicarrier. The second page had two drawings on, both of which made his heart clench. A small silhouette, falling falling falling from a swirling portal, the skyline below him. Then Tony, from the shoulders up. The remainder of his suit was scratched up and dented, the face mask discarded somewhere. Even though it had no colour, he somehow looked lifeless, his eyes closed and his eyelashes fanning his cheeks, his mouth a thin line. He moved on quickly after that. The sketches got more and more intimate as the dates got later. They began with Tony in battle, or Tony wearing a sharp suit on his way to SI, checking his watch or sipping his coffee with an annoyed look on his face. A series of him angry, yelling and baring his teeth and one of Tony flipping Steve off with a childish pout on his face. A series of him in battle, a metal blur, holding up his palm or carrying a civilian or flying in a long arc. The next was in colour – Tony’s workshop. Everything bathed in a brilliant blue glow, Tony at the centre of the madness, a Captain at the helm surrounded by his glowing blue holographic screens.
To think of how far they had come made Steve’s heart warm. From not being able to stay in the same room for more than thirty minutes to spending Valentine’s Day together. His smile was broad as he washed off his dish and stacked it into the dishwasher, heading into the common room to say good morning to the other Avengers. Clint and Natasha’s squabbling was audible from the kitchen and he walked in to the two of them playing video games and tossing candy into their mouths. It was another one of Clint’s party tricks, he was able to do all kinds of weird trick shots and still catch the M&Ms in his mouth.
Steve opened his door and blinked. It was early in the morning, the sun had not yet risen over the New York skyline due to February’s long and cold nights and while it was not unusual for some of the other Avenger’s to be awake, they were usually in a more zombie-like state by this hour. Their state of wakefulness was usually due to an inability to sleep, or in Tony’s case a project that he couldn’t bear to take his hands away from. A small smile spread across his face as the thought brought to mind an image of Tony, cranky and sleepy and blindly searching for a coffee that Steve always had at the ready. He rarely got a thank you if Tony had been up all night, usually just a grunt or some incomprehensible mumbling about scientific matters that went right over Steve’s head. It didn’t matter though, Tony could probably snub the act a million times and Steve would still have coffee ready, hot and just the way he liked it.
one. It was always some equally lonely gal who Bucky had roped into a double date. It was usually painfully obvious that they had been coerced by their friend so they could spend the night with Bucky – who, to his everlasting couple, always explained that he and Stevie were a package deal and did she have a friend? But even though he knew what to expect, it still hurt every time he saw the disappointment on their face at being stuck with the rent, caught Bucky’s date giving her a pleading gaze or mouthing ‘just a few more hours.’ It was painful to sit in awkward silence, as they were seldom interested in holding a conversation with him and his questions were usually met with short, uninteresting answers. He had insisted over and over to Bucky that he should just go alone, that he really didn’t mind staying at home, but his best friend never wanted to leave him behind. On his part, it was too humiliating for him to explain that sitting alone at home was a better time than watching his date stare at Bucky with jealousy and desire instead of him.
him. It would have been impossible to look through the book in his hands and draw any other conclusion.
Steve opened his eyes and strengthened his resolve. He stared at the items and thought carefully. A teddy bear, his favourite candy, a rose. It was sort of understated for Tony if he was being honest. It didn’t quite live up to what he imagined when he dared let himself escape to that daydream where Tony loved him back. With how dramatic Tony was about the tiniest of things, he always imagined something crazy like fireworks, or writing in the sky, or a trip to Paris or something equally ridiculous. After all, it was only last night over dinner with the team that they had been sharing stupid relationship experiences, inspired by Valentine’s Day’s looming presence, and Tony had told them all about the twenty-foot bunny that he had got for Pepper once and how she’d despised it.
Then Tony came. Brash, loud, flashy, arrogant, everything-bad-about-the-future Tony, treating Steve like he was just some jackass in spandex. Of course it made him angry, but it also made him feel free. For once, Steve didn’t have to be perfect and patient and kind. For once, for the first time since he woke up, Steve got to be
was good. Falling in love was him was never a choice, not really. Steve’s heart had belonged to that bastard since the minute he walked onto that helicarrier, and there wasn’t a damn thing that he could have done about it.
He shook his head. It was probably from Pepper, a pity gift to make him feel better about everything he was feeling. Tony got himself together and tore off the paper, his curiosity growing as he realised what it was. A black, A4 sketchbook, the book thick was use and some of the pages dog-eared. Cautiously, he opened the first page and froze. There, in perfect cursive that could only belong to one person on this team, was a message that made his heart stop.
It wasn’t that he was disappointed of course, how could he be? He was just a little… surprised. And not being here in person didn’t really seem like Tony’s style either. For the man who couldn’t even keep it to himself that he was Iron Man for longer than about five minutes, it seemed out of character. Tony had certainly never been afraid to tell Steve exactly what he thought of him in the past, after all. Perhaps it was for his sake? After all, Steve was a quiet man, understated and private in a way that Tony wasn’t. Maybe he thought that a huge public display was something that Steve would hate, and maybe he was just giving Steve some time to process and plan a response? Yes, that must be it. Tony just knew him far too well. Putting a lot of pressure on things would surely be a mistake.
As he opened the bag to take one out, he noticed that there was a white card taped to the rose that he hadn’t noticed before. He had assumed it was just an anonymous friendly gesture, one of his teammates wanting Steve to have something. It was Valentine’s Day after all, and Steve would bet that he was one of the few Avengers that didn’t have a date or other plans. He had been decidedly ignoring the thought of which pretty dame Tony would take out for a while. That all changed though when he read the note. Steve froze, almost dropping the bag of candy despite his reflexes. He stared, reading it over and over again to make sure that he hadn’t gotten it wrong. There, in a chicken scratch that had become all too familiar to him over the past two years:
The upside to that was that every time Tony asked him if he would like to do something, Steve jumped at the chance. Like he said, Steve was just bored. It didn’t mean that he really liked Tony, he probably would have preferred if Nat had offered instead. They had a nice time though, at least Tony thought they did. Museums and galleries and parks and restaurants. Tony had taken Steve all over New York by now. They had been to way too many baseball games to count, decked head to toe in the horrible gaudy team merchandise – it was their compromise. Steve preferred hockey, but Tony could actually get behind baseball just for the statistics of it all. On rainy days, they stayed inside and worked on Steve’s film, TV and music knowledge. Most of the stuff, Tony had seen a few times already, but he didn’t care. It was even worth watching the crappy romance ones that Steve loved just to watch the man’s face light up whenever he caught a reference.
"Enough!" Steve snarled which caused everyone to froze in their place, glancing at Steve to see him twitching and glaring at Loki. "How dare you take all of Mr. Stark's attention, you second-rated wizard?" Steve hissed his words making Loki scowling harshly, but before the God of mischief show him who was the second-rated wizard, Steve growled like an animal at him, it was only a few seconds later before the sky darkens with black clouds and the thunder started up with lightening, everyone turned to Thor at that only to see the man shaking his head with horror look on his face. "Rise!" Steve snarled, and a few seconds later the ground shook, and shadowy figures with red eyes got out of the ground, and everyone looked in horror at those things, only Bucky wasn't afraid, the man was swooning and cheering Steve while fanning himself with his hands. "Attack!" Steve hissed, and the shadowy figures turned to Steve before their gaze stick to Loki, letting out shrieks before attacking the trickster, making the man shriek as he tried to counterattack the… demons were actually the best description of what they were seeing… but the man was overwhelmed and it was only a few seconds later that Loki was bound and gagged while whimpering as he backed away from Steve who was growling like an attack dog.
His throat felt tight as he could feel their friendship growing through the pages. Tony in sweatpants and a t-shirt, shoving pizza into his mouth. Tony at breakfast, bags under his eyes and hands wrapped around his coffee like somebody might take it. Tony concentrating on something in the lab, brow furrowed and wearing a ratty tank that Steve had paid loving attention to. Soon came a softer one of him grinning playfully and petting DUM-E. It must have been around the time Steve took up sketching on the couch down there. Tony sprawled over the couch, fast asleep and drooling, Tony brandishing the remote and ranting about some movie or other. Then came the dates – outings. He meant outings. Tony sipping a milkshake and making pathetic moon eyes at Steve from under his eyelashes, Tony in his baseball cap and sunglasses throwing up a piece sign, Tony studying a piece of art with a puzzled look on his face (Steve probably had to explain it to him), Tony grinning like a kid at a dinosaur skeleton all interspersed with ones at the Tower. Those were by far the most intimate, Tony in his natural habitat. Cooking, cleaning, working in the lab, sleeping. The times that he looked the worst, bedhead and ratty clothes, seemed to be the ones Steve took most pleasure in. Like it was some kind of honour to get to see Tony like that. Like he was
