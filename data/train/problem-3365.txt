Only, Dean’s memory was worsening rapidly by the minute.
Dean surprised himself by laughing, but Cas’s smile simply grew wider. Dean started to say something else, anything really, but he was cut off by a gasp from behind him.
After all is said and done, Dean and Cas go on a road trip.
“Shh,” Dean hissed, bringing his finger to Sam’s lips. “Keep it down!”
“I’ve seen my brother die before,” he said, his voice quiet, “but watching him forget himself?” Sam paused and looked back at Dean. “This might be worse.”
Cas stared back at him for a few confused seconds before something like recognition clicked in his expression. He looked a little like he’d been slapped across the face, and he simply said, “Oh.”
Dean could only reply, “Shut up and kiss me.”
Sam nodded and gave him a tight but understanding smile.
Before God created the heavens and the earth, there had been darkness. Sure, he’d met the actual Darkness now, but he didn’t know about her back then. The story went that God had parted the waters and turned on the lights and so on, but a younger Dean had wondered what that time before had been like. What it must have looked like for a universe to exist in total darkness; the cold and sharp waters that must have covered the surface of everything.
'I have an idea.'
As afternoon stretched into evening and the sun set, Sam and Dean unpacked all the boxes they had brought and the house started to at least resemble a place that was lived in. There was still stuff that would arrive tomorrow in the moving van but they at least had the basics. When the last box was finally empty and put away, they both collapsed backward onto the folded up futon in the corner of the living room. Bones took the opportunity to try to climb onto Sam's lap and lick his face. Dean winced, but Sam smiled and twisted his head out of the way, rubbed Bones down until the dog started doing that scratchy leg-kicking thing that Dean never understood. Bones wiggled, leaned his head backwards, and huffed at Sam, tail thwacking the floor. Dean felt exhausted just watching him.
The rest of lunch passes with the four of them cheerfully talking nonsense, but Dean is distracted by how close Cas is. The tension is making his skin tingle, and he licks his lips and tries not to stare, tries to focus on the conversation. All he can do is wonder how hot Castiel's skin is underneath his clothes. While he studiously avoids eye contact with Cas, he can see Chuck and Kevin exchanging looks, and can tell they're going to corner him later.
Castiel nodded and answered his phone. “Hello?”
'You love us,' Benny chuckled and peeled off to go to his first period, turning around and walking backwards for a few steps to call back, 'I'll get it from you at lunch, Cas!'
'I think this cake is too good to be eaten in a dark hotel kitchen, or a staff canteen.'
'Dean, why are you pissed? You know I don't have a choice.'
“Argue? With you? Is that even possible?”
Cas cocked his head and mouthed something Dean didn't get. Dean wrinkled his brow.
Jimmy's voice sounded in his ear as Inias undid his apron and walked out. “Hi, it's me. Are you busy?”
Kevin hangs warily behind Jo. Jo inhales sharply. 'That's fine. We can salvage this. We have time.' She looks around as if a fresh batch will appear on a counter.
'Really? I'd prefer fire and brimstone any day, but maybe that's because I wouldn't be responsible for cleaning it.'
An hour later and they're halfway drunk. The band with the clever shirts are bashing away at their guitars in the corner, surrounded by a knot of dancing students, Sam among them. Dean doesn't dance, so he's leaning against the bar and laughing at Sam when a guy leans in next to him and says, 'What are you drinking?'
“Well, you gave me one of your teas once when I had strep throat and honestly it made me feel like a million times better.”
Cas laughs, and turns to Bobby. Dean watches, trying not to let anyone know how much this matters to him. He keeps his face cautiously blank.
Dean felt indignant in the face of his dad's hypocrisy. 'No,' he lied.
“I enjoy it, and Inias is a big help. He deals with most of the customers.”
'Let's go have angry sex,' Bela suggested, her expression flat. Dean liked being in the glare of her flippant boldness. It meant nothing was left up to him. All he had to do was shrug and follow. Which he did. They ended up in the laundry room, pressed against each other in the detergent-scented air. Why did being with Bela always smell like fake chemical flowers?
Cas unwinds himself from the chair and stretches. 'I'll bring you a bowl.' He walks to the kitchen, and Dean is hypnotized by the view for a moment. Nice. Then he shakes himself. Cas sticks his head out of the kitchen and points a ladle at Dean. 'Don't move. Your job is to relax.'
'Dean!'
'My dad. Figured he wouldn't miss it. He's K-O'd on the couch. And Sam is being someone else's family tonight.'
'So anyway, he lays the cards out in a sort of cross shape? And one line is your past, then there's your more recent past, then the future, then...um....'
K so I know that that time Sam went to that girl's house for Thanksgiving referenced in Dark Side of the Moon took place in 1994, but I had to change the year (and girl) for plot reasons. I like to think that things would've developed differently if Sam and Dean hadn't become hunters and if Sam had grown up knowing Jess.
Jo grimaces when they reach the car and she has to sit down heavily in the passenger seat. 'Ahh. Okay.'
A hand landed on Dean's arm and he nearly jumped out his skin. Crowley and Bela jerked back in surprise.
'What did you have in mind?'
'Then we can take my car.'
He remembered the blinking of flashlights.
'Hello.' Cas deadpanned. Dean turned to look at him properly and was surprised to see the angel holding a dirty, dripping potted plant bursting with small purple flowers.
John squinted against the sunlight dappling the picnic table. He scanned the playground for Dean and Castiel, and his eyes finally landed on them: They were over on the other side where a woman with a name tag and a hat that said 'Sedgwick County Zoo' was handing out chalk to a small swarm of children. Castiel looked delighted and immediately plopped to the ground and started scribbling. Dean settled a few feet away and contentedly joined in. 'That should keep 'em occupied for a while.' John already knew what Dean would be drawing, could see it with his eyes closed. Their house back in Lawrence, as it was remodeled after the fire - the tree in the yard, the bushes out front, and caricatures of John, Dean, Sam, and Mary. It broke John's heart, but it made Dean happy. Dean and Castiel were working toward each other from opposite sides of the pavement, drawing in sync with endearing focus.
Dean frowns. 'She didn't have to do that. It would've been nice to see her.'
'Like it?'
shed. Don't people use it to blow up tree stumps?'
'I can see the headline already. Teen Idiots Killed in Their Own Dynamite Blast.'
Crowley noticed Dean staring and sniggered. 'Can't wait to see just desserts doled out. Snooty writer and his spoiled kids.'
Dean flipped him off and continued, this time keeping close to the fence. At the darkest corner, Dean looked back at Cas. He was sitting slouched at the table with a book propped up against a giant bowl of cereal. Dean watched as Cas dipped his spoon down and held it up, dripping milk, while he finished a sentence. Only then did he eat it. Dean fought the urge to smile. Cas was always a huge klutz when he had his nose in a book. He was inclined to read and walk at the same time, which meant a lot of tripping and banging into poles. Dean used to make fun of him for it, telling him that if he paid attention to girls that way it wouldn't have been poles he was always banging, if he knew what Dean meant. Wink wink. Cas would always just hit Dean without looking up from whatever he was reading.
'You started what?' Cas' voice was shocked.
Sam tugged at Dean's sleeve. 'Dean, can't see.'
'Thank you, Dean.'
'I don't want to be in your way.'
?! Jesus, John, he's 16 years old and his brother was hungry! What'd you expect if you leave them to fend for themselves?' And, sometimes, more often than Sam liked to think about, 'Are you
Dean's head swims, shocked. 'What?'
The world slowed down. Dean's face burned where Cas had hit him and his fingertips froze. Cas' closed lips fit so perfectly against his and Dean felt the hard press of Cas' chin. Cas took a small step forward so his body was against Dean's and lifted his hands to cup Dean's swelling face. He felt solid and reassuring and warm so Dean let it all go and let himself be kissed. He may or may not have whimpered into Cas' mouth. He wrapped his arms around Cas and pulled him closer, licked at Cas' dry lips, brought his hand up and touched Cas' jaw, his cold hair, the back of his neck. He knew his way around Cas' body by heart already, but everything about Cas that was so familiar now opened up into a million new dimensions: For Dean it was like opening his eyes and discovering that he could suddenly see colors he'd never even dreamed were possible. Cas wriggled against Dean and nipped his lip, then their mouths were open and they were tasting one another. Alcohol, the flat taste of clean skin, sweetness, life. Dean was lost. Completely. Hopelessly.
“Oh, is that so? Tell you what. We'll get you ready for bed and if you still can't sleep after 15 minutes in bed we'll keep playing for a bit.” This was his foolproof bedtime method, because he meant it.
Anna shook her finger at him. 'Leave it, you broke-ass grad student. You can get the next two after your grant comes in.' She loped off to the counter with her wallet in hand.
'Come on, slowpoke, get the lead out. Which way do you want to go?' Dean lifted his arms. Sam heard the distant sound of caroling coming from one direction, so he pointed.
Castiel raised his voice. “How DID it go? What was his name again?”
) and says 'I need to return to work. Maybe you should go home, Dean, and take care of yourself.'
'Really?!'
'Bye!' Dean and Castiel chirped.
The third greenhouse was for the pets. This was the greenhouse that housed sick plants, orchids, plants that Castiel took cuttings from to give as gifts, strange plants from other climates that needed specialist attention, and several amateur bonsai trees that Castiel was trying his hand at. His favourite so far was a Scots pine that was a deliberate twist of dead wood and living tree. Stripes of softened light fell across the workbench and Castiel ran his hand along the small curled trunk of the pine, combing his fingers gently through the needles. If he stayed absolutely silent and focused only on the tree, he could almost feel the bark humming at specific pitches.
'Come on, let's get back to the stump. I still think we should get forty seconds for a head start.'
'Oh. Well, can you help me move her over against the wall?'
'No problem,' Dean replies. 'I have to get back to sifting and bossing people around, I'll get Chuck to take you back to trolley central.'
'Are you always this nice to the new ones?' He sounds curious.
'I know, right?' Dean grinned. 'Think we can get it to come over?'
“Dude! We're not 12 anymore!” Dean just laughs again and elbows Cas out the door. Cas closes it behind them as Sam leans out the window. “Just get me an apple and a sandwich.”
'I don't know, he just doesn't seem very...friendly. Could've been first day jitters. He didn't say more than two words to me.'
Dean yawns. 'I'm going to go out and get some aspirin. You want anything?'
Dean considers the question before answering. 'I guess not. A lot of them don't need it.'
'I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. It's top secret. I wrote the recipe myself.' Dean is absurdly proud.
'I don't need coddling.'
'It doesn't really. I only had a little bit of money saved, and I rented my studio at first. You can rent shops for a good price if they're in a complex or connected to other buildings. And you can always apply for a grant or a loan if you have an acceptable business plan and some references.' Dean looks at him in surprise. 'It's not as hard as people think. Especially if you're selling something consumable and necessary, like food.'
'Just get her home! I'll cover til you get back. Kevin! You're on pastry.'
Cas was taken aback by his candour. To fill the silence, he pointed at the top arm of the cross. 'So what do those cards say? You haven't talked about them yet.'
'And you say I'M bad with cultural references.'
'Save it, Cas.' Dean snarled. A dull thud. Sam knew intimately the sound of Dean kicking something.
'What's an honest name?'
Miles away, Castiel stared at the ceiling and waited for something. Sleep, he thought, or a solution to the way he felt. Claire blinked blearily, wondered if her uncle was still awake, then let sleep carry her away again.
Which means it’s just Dean and him.)
“Then why leave?”
(Or perhaps it’s not supposed to be blurry. Castiel wouldn’t know. He can hardly make out his own breathing. It’s a feat that he can make out the conversation, even if most of it is instinct memory, and all he’s doing is holding onto Dean for as long as he can.
to smile, doesn’t he? One last time. Just for Dean.
"Why not?"
living this down.
And with that, he leans over to take a swig of Dean’s beer, eyes crinkling at the hunter — back to normal, or as normal as happy-drunk Castiel was ever going to get — leaving Dean stunned in a sudden, overwhelming tornado of emotions.
"We?" Sam repeats, sounding incredulous but mostly just poking fun. Oh, curse his freakish memory. "Dude.
, Cas.” Dean looks up at last, eyes red and cheeks flush. “I’d rather have you fucking stay.”
“Birthdays.” Cas declares, eyes flitting across the brothers as he dramatically tosses his head.
(“You’ve
He pushes Cas against the nearest wall, and pins him there with his hips, and his hands move up Cas’s back, angrily grabbing at the shirt. He slams their faces together once again, and in a clash of teeth and tongue, they’re kissing again, desperate and breathless, until Cas lets out a moan when Dean’s hands wrap tighter around his waist, and Dean freezes.
This was going to take some getting used to, even for Sam, and he was just the blissfully-ignored spectator. He knows Dean and Cas have their work cut out for them - and they were going to stumble into mishaps, and march straight into misunderstandings, but as they ultimately always did - they were going to come through.
He’s on his deathbed after all.
“I do.” He wheezes. “I —”

Dean looks up again, and there’s a softness there. “I love you.”

he’s always been unreasonably beautiful, but the moonlight’s not helping.
No." Dean throws back, almost defensive. "It's a slinky!" That doesn't really help absolve his confusion, but Cas deems it alright to nod at that. "We won this, like, a couple thousand cases back at a Plucky Pennywhistle's Magical Menagerie."
They start at the same time, but Cas pauses, and allows Dean to go on with a hint of urgency in his frown.
And squeezes Dean’s hand in his.
cup his face and pull him closer - and kiss him again, because they’re in love, and under the stars, and things might be complicated, but as long as they promise to try, they might just work out after all.
“Yeah,” Sam grins. “It’s yours today.”
Cas just wants to brush off Dean’s tears, which have never been there before, and run his hands through his hair, and caress his temple, and he wants to soothe Dean’s knuckles with his thumbs, and he wants to tell Dean how wonderful he is, again and again until he believes Cas, and then calmly, he wants to take Dean’s hands, and -
Not to mention, some things were going to be hilarious. Eating, for example. Showers, Sam fleetingly thinks, wickedly. Or sleep - because Dean would need it, and Cas would remain wandering in his consciousness all night. When compared with the arguments over being watched when he sleeps? Sam knows Dean’s going to cause a ruckus.
“Jelly?” Cas smiles, when he wants to sob. He’s certain he sounds fainter too, he

can’t move his neck — he’s got to tell Dean that at some point if he’s not understood already. It’s the cast.)
Still. As long as his arm’s still around Dean, and his breath is still in Dean’s hair, it’s all good. It’s so good that Dean doesn’t pay attention to the way Cas’s breath hitches, when Dean peels himself off of Cas, and settles on the pillow instead, ready to sleep. It’s
“Not, today.” He half-heaves, and another tear rolls down his face.
“Hell yes, I have.”
Cas raises his eyebrows.
"Is that a toy?" Cas asks, curious. His eyes are narrowed, and eyebrows still pinched together from all the concentrated reading.
He’s dying, but he needs this. One last time, he

“Nah, s'good. I love you.” Dean adds, clearly smiling wider, because they’ve only recently added that to their vernacular instead of the pedestal it’d been on for the first eight months of their friendship turning into a relationship. Somehow, it feels grander though — or, that might also be because it’s the last time Castiel ever gets to hear Dean say it to him.
to — but there’s a click.
“And I have my packed lunch anyway.” Dean continues, filling the gap thankfully. Machines blare in his background and he braves on like a man used to not being able to hear his own words due to the racket. Castiel is grateful for it. He hangs onto every word, drinks it in. Makes himself hold on. “Pretty sure you’d kick me to the curb if I let a PBJ go to waste.”
“I know.” Dean blushes. “And I meant the ‘awesome’ kind.”
just had to have really low selfesteem, and that part checks out.” Dean frowns at him, but they both know it’s not something they’re going to address at the moment. So, Cas goes on. “And in any case, how could you ever think that my response to you asking me out would just have been

Dean reddens again. “Yeah. I meant, yeah.”
Treasure, and keep Dean happy forever.
That makes sense. And honestly, makes it easier to tell them apart. Sure, they’ve spent enough time together for Sam to figure out who’s speaking, with the intonation of a single sentence if they’re arguing, but for the rest of the time? It’d be a lot more convenient.

Then, move out from their shared apartment into a house.
"Goddamn giant
“It’s not about the
Cas nods. “Of course I do. I couldn't even imagine a world where I didn’t get to see you everyday, Dean. And now, ‘dunno, maybe’, I won’t
“Well, guess what, smartass?” Dean throws back, and the thing which keeps happening, where Dean cuts himself off and proceeds to tell himself off, is not going to cease being amusing for a very long time. “Neither have I. Just - sit back, and enjoy the ride.”
Intentions to beg his brother to come back, and not give up until he’d gotten his forgiveness and his only remaining family back. But that — well, it was a different alley than Castiel’s thoughts swarmed to right now. And swarm they did, his head throbbing, and life thudding at its gates.
When Castiel slowly opens his eyes, looking composed again - and a little proud, definitely pleased, almost too lovely, Dean doesn’t hesitate. Doesn’t wait for the voice in his head to catch up, and start second-guessing what he’s wanted to do forever. Dean just lurches forward, grabbing the trenchcoat lapels to reduce the gap, and kisses him.
. Turns out he doesn’t phrase it less lame after all. But Castiel’s smiling, wide and happy, so maybe it doesn’t really matter how he said it.
But now, if Dean’s in enough discomfort to come out and audibly hint at it, it’s harder for him than he let Castiel believe - in the past, or even the night before yesterday. Cas knows he’d never impose on Dean. Or reinforce the multiple, exceedingly valid arguments he hadn’t had to use the first time, in favor of flying versus driving. Dean has the right to retract his agreement, his consent at any moment, and Cas instantly resolves to not let it show that this had meant something, because Dean would end up shouldering all the guilt Cas had no resolve to create, and absorbing it to the deepest crevices of his mind, to let himself fester in it.

Children.
“I want a boyfriend.”
“Hello, sir, I’m Officer Henriksen, and I have you listed as Mr Castiel Novak’s emergency…”
on you.”
It’s true.
But, end of the day? Sam figures that if they’re ever going to get a move on, he needs to step in.
"Enough about the armor." Dean bristles. "You're missing the point."
There’s IV’s on both his hands. And something stiff around his neck. Almost like a collar, but thicker. And when he breathes, his ribs start like they might hurt — but the pain is numbed as it registers. He must be running really high on painkillers; they never really worked for him.
"Why aren't you one of them?"
“Nah, you’re always welcome.”
“That’s funny, I guess.” Dean manages.
Dean raises his head irritably, a frown etched in the lines of his forehead. “How much more fucking dense can you get, du —”
, dumbass. I’m going to kill you for this, you know. I am, but I need you to be okay first.”
Cas's eyebrows go up.
Dean holds him tighter. “Okay.” He lets out, with a shuddering breath, before Cas smiles a little, and puts his head on Dean’s shoulder. “Okay.”

“Jesus, Cas. You complete
Of course, he’s putting a hand on Dean’s hip - and drinking in the subtle responses of his body to Cas guiding him closer, and his other hand goes to rest on it’s eternally demarcated place on Dean’s left arm, as he looks up at Dean with all of the admiration and reverence he feels inside, trying to coax it into his eyes, and it’s not even a fraction of a millionth which makes it there, but Dean still blushes, so maybe for now, it’s enough. And then Dean’s hand grazes against Cas’s elbow carefully - because Cas hasn’t asked Dean to touch him yet, (so he doesn’t), but oh, how he wishes he would.
this feels like wings.
Dean’s voice cuts through Castiel’s morbid mental news report, and almost reflexively, he closes his eyes. There’s a tangible relief in his head when he does it, and god, Castiel must’ve been doing worse than he’s convinced himself he is.
Now, he’s determined to make the most of the time he’s got.
smile, eyes as bright as the emeralds in Geology Club which Dean claims to hate but always ends up attending and Cas should know, because Dean makes it a point to sit beside him each time.
“I’m sorry.”
Castiel swallows again, and vaguely registers that it tastes like metal. Almost like there’s blood mixed with saliva.
Dean storms up to him, glaring. He’s angry, it almost radiates off of him - just not, per se, at Cas.
“Bird day?” Sam offers, finishing off the last of his glass, and Cas whips around to stare at him with unbridled admiration.
And now Cas has practically gummy-smiled it to where it should always have been; literally goddamn
, I believe in you.” Falls from his lips in an awed whisper, and the sound of his voice is still too much for the frailty of the moment.
"— and what difference does it make?" Cas finishes for him, confused. He'd made sure the top was in Dean's new size — 3XL
'You and Sam gossip like old ladies.'
There's something comforting about the enormous, clanging, voice-filled roar of an industrial kitchen in action. The noise is like an ocean, and Dean revels in it. When he's prowling through the kitchen hauling ingredients, barking orders, beating this, whipping that, he can't hear himself think, and for that he's grateful. The smell of flour and butter in the air reminds him of sitting in the kitchen when he was young while his mother baked. He floats on the surface of it all and drowns everything out.
'Why would I punch you?' Cas took Dean's hand (hot, dry, don't let go). Dean dropped it as soon as Cas was on his feet.
'Hey, you asked for 'em.'
'Oh, okay. Can I have some of your tubes?'
Dean raised an imaginary glass and said, 'I'll drink to that.'
'Dean hasn't shut up about you since you met, it feels like we know you already.'
'We're not intruding, are we? I called you but you didn't answer.'
'Thank you.'
Dean gave the animal an appraising look. 'Hm. Actually, I kinda like it. He can stay.'
He stared at his reflection in the darkened window, looking out at the cold night sky. He knew that something was missing. He couldn't hide it from himself. But the thing was...his life was safe now. He felt precarious – like he was just managing to balance a canoe in the rapids – and the addition of another person, of feelings, of compromise and communication, would throw him off kilter. His weight would shift and he would be thrown without ceremony into a roaring, rushing river and dashed on the sharp rocks of consequence.
To his surprise, Sam's face flushed red, and Dean could have sworn he felt the temperature in the room rise by a few degrees. “The guy who runs the cafe is a real talker. I got you...uh...some kind of...sandwich...thing?” He tossed the bag to Dean and cleared his throat, then turned to leave without meeting Dean's eyes.
Sam looked at Jess and they shrugged at each other. Dean turned around in the seat to face them. 'We'll be back in a sec, you guys sit tight.'
'Of course.' Cas paused. 'I drew her. Anna. Want to see?'
Dean clenched his jaw. 'Hey, I never said I wouldn't do it.' He tried not to stare at Cas. He thought of the phone at home. The silent, waiting phone. Cas hadn't called. The whole time he was gone he hadn't called once.
Sift the flour and baking powder together, throw in a pinch of salt.
'Well next time tell her not to leave on my account. You know I like her better than you anyway.'
'Okay. We can take my car.'
home, they all watched football as John drank his way through a six pack or two. The next day, Jess had asked Sam if he wanted to spend Thanksgiving with her family. He had agreed before he even knew what he was saying, and had talked to John about it as soon as he got home.
Even though John had seemed reluctant about the whole thing, Sam was excited.
Dean honestly agreed with Cas, but he felt a perverse sense of satisfaction as he said, 'Yeah. I do.'
'I know, son.' Sam could tell from the tone that his jaw was clenched. 'I'm on my way home. I'll be back by ten. If there's nothing to eat, I want you to go over next door and ask if you can stay until I get there. You understand?'
'Seriously, Cas,' Dean leans against the wall and tries to catch his breath, 'it's okay. I'm glad you came with. It's so - ' And he dissolves into laughter again. 'Ridiculous,' he finally chokes out, and smacks his fist into the wall. 'Oh my god. What are we going to do with – with – all this BREAD?!' He wheezes with laughter and struggles to hold himself up against the wall, tears leaking from his eyes. He thinks he hears Cas laughing too. He tries to stop and take deep breaths, feeling a tinge of hysteria that resembles something much, much darker down there using the cover of his uncontrollable laughter to sneak up his throat. He gasps in air and winds himself down, wiping his eyes. Then he sees that Cas is shaking with silent laughter and that's it, he's gone, his ribs are aching and he's laughing so hard he thinks he really might burst blood vessels.
Dean stepped up behind Cas and reached around him for the coffeepot. He briefly rested his other hand on Cas' hip, and that was, of course, when Sam walked in with a newspaper and cleared his throat.
He feels empty when Dean isn't looking at him, but his stomach feels so full it almost hurts. The two feelings don't sit well together. He drinks a glass of water and pictures the bread expanding in his stomach like a sponge. He feels like he's choking even though he knows he isn't.
He thought for a moment, then pointed at Cas.
'No problem. It's all yours. You have a good night.' Cas nods beside him. Dean very carefully avoids looking at Cas while the men hoist the pallet and walk away. He feels the corners of his lips twitching again.
Cas was at his desk, hunched over, a look of burning concentration on his face. His paintbrush flew over the page, dripping colored water all over the place. He looked like a god of chaos. He looked like a hurricane. Dean wanted to be a part of the storm. He tapped on the window, making Cas jump. Paint went flying. Dean walked around to the door, which opened.
'We WOULD be, if Dean could concentrate long enough.' To illustrate his point, Dean's phone goes off again. Dean dives for it. He can feel Bobby and Sam exchanging a look over his head.
'Oh, really? Do you feel better now?'
'Whoa! Whoa, no! No, I'm good!' Dean lifts his arm to block. 'Seriously.' He clears his throat. It feels like he swallowed a pound of cotton balls. 'No need to whale on me, Cas.'
For the next week, Dean finds his eyes constantly zeroing in on Castiel. When they arrive in the mornings, when they sit at different tables at lunch break, any time Cas happens to be in the vicinity, Dean's heart speeds up and he can't seem to look away for long. They exchange greetings as per usual and snippets of small talk that make Dean awkwardly aware of his hands, his face, his hair. He finds himself constantly on edge, but instead of tension, it's a tingling electric pleasure. Castiel gradually loses the frightened rabbit look and stops watching his feet when he walks. He looks around more, actually eats lunch, and Dean's even seen him laughing with Jo and a few of the attendants, which makes his heart skip. He wishes that Cas would look at him that way, just once, but, maybe because he's unsure, maybe because he's a little scared (though he'll never admit it, ever), he's never anything more than politely friendly to Cas.
The darkness clawed at his vision, and his chest ached. Something deep and heavy was working its way through him now, hollowing him out at his core. He took a deep breath in and out. He wasn’t actually drowning. He was still here. He was…
He was sitting at the map table nursing a warm mug full of coffee between his hands when Sam got back from his run several hours later.
“Yeah, thanks, Cas,” he said.
Right in front of Dean’s eyes. Right after Cas finally,
By the time they were all contentedly full and ready to hit the road again, his trepidation about the whole affair was all but gone. He stood a little to the side as she and Cas said their goodbyes. Cas’s social skills were one of the oddest and most endearing things about his humanity. He was still clumsy and awkward more often than not, but he made up for that with his earnest desire for connection. He cared about people, plain and simple. Charlie, as odd as this situation was, seemed to be no exception.
Cas leaned in for one more quick kiss, nibbling at Dean’s lips when Dean brought his hand up to cradle the back of Cas’s head, and Dean pulled away quickly at that. He said, “Okay, yep, let’s go home. Right now.”
Donnie reached out and gently swiped his thumb along Dean’s cheekbone. When he held his hand up for Dean to see, it was wet.
“We’re great,” Cas said.
“Right, of course,” he said.
“Whatever,” he said.
Dean swallowed roughly, like that didn’t just tilt his world on its axis.
Dean took a step back after a moment and really looked at him. He looked unchanged from those final moments, as if he’d just stepped right out of Dean’s last, terrible memory of him.
She nodded once as he clapped her on the shoulder and rose from the ground. He turned around to find Sam helping Stevie drag out the werewolf’s body. The girl still hadn’t looked up from where she sat on the ground, and Dean figured that was for the best.
Donnie squeezed his shoulder once, gently, and said, “Help yourself to whatever’s in the fridge, and stay back here as long as you need.”
“I didn’t know where else to go. It sounds stupid now, but I thought…”
“That’s what I thought,” Sam agreed.
“You think it’s a case,” he said.
“I thought you liked my dick,” he said, the smug bastard.
to him about Cas being gone because that would mean it had really happened, and that wasn’t fucking possible. Dean wasn’t grieving. He was lying in wait. He just wasn’t sure what the fuck he was waiting for.
“Fine, I guess,” he said.
“Hey,” he said, and Cas looked up at him a little shamefully, like he knew he’d ruined the lighthearted moment. Dean smiled at him. “Me and you? We’re going to grow old, you got that? I’m gonna be a grouchy old man, and I have every intention of making that your problem.”
Dean felt a slightly hysterical laugh fight its way out of his chest, and the feeling only grew when Cas gave him a pleased little smile.
Dean sat down on the mattress across from him and looked at him. He said, “Yeah, Cas. I remember everything.”
“Good idea,” Cas agreed.
“Geez, I’m sorry I asked,” Sam replied, equally sarcastic.
“I heard that,” she said.
Dean scoffed, “That angel sounds like a dick.”
In any case, he really didn’t want his brother’s voice in his ear for this. So, he said, “Now, uh, really isn’t a-ah… a good time, Sammy.”
Then the werewolf shot forward, and his focus snapped back.
“Yeah, of course.”
Dean had the werewolf cornered while Charlie held up her gun when the girl burst back in through the front door. Apparently she’d gotten the drop on Sam, which Dean would definitely be giving him shit for later, and wasn’t going down without a fight.
Cas looked up at him through his eyelashes like he knew exactly what he was doing to him, and Dean was torn between flipping him off and begging him to never stop.
Dean swallowed roughly and managed to reply, “Yeah, thanks.”
Well, it actually wasn’t, but that’s how it felt for Dean anyways. Eileen moved in after she and Sam found each other again, and the two of them were nauseatingly adorable as always. Dean was happy for them and honestly grateful because Eileen brought out a side of his brother that he hadn’t seen in a long time, if ever. He was happier, lighter. It was what Sam deserved.
Cas smiled at him, a soft little thing, and Dean felt his chest fill up with warmth as he let himself be dragged the rest of the way down the stairs. It was more than he’d ever dreamed of hoping for, having a hand to hold in the face of the great unknown, but he knew for damn sure that he was never letting go.
Sam laughed a little helplessly and leaned against the counter. He said, “I don’t know. Maybe it won’t, but it has to be better than keeping it all inside until you eventually explode.”
Sam started to turn around, but Dean grabbed his shoulder and asked, “What the hell is that supposed to mean?”
She nodded at him and reached for her beer, not really looking guilty as she took a swig. Dean almost cracked a smile at that. She sat it back down and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand before settling into the chair with a graceless flop.
partner. We had him trapped in a barn on the edge of town, and then out of nowhere, this teenaged girl runs at us screaming. I thought it was another wolf, but she was just a girl. Said she loved him and begged us not to kill him, and he got away.”
She chewed on her lower lip for a moment as she twisted her bottle around on the table in front of her.
, Cas turned to him, tears running down his cheeks.
The words came out of his mouth with a surprisingly sharp edge to them, and he exhaled as he stared down at the table between them. He closed his eyes and told himself to cool the fuck down. It wasn’t Claire’s fault. She was just a kid, and he knew deep down that he’d feel worse for picking a fight with her. So, he steeled himself and avoided her gaze when he opened his eyes again.
He asked, “Why are you here anyway? Moping doesn’t really seem like your style.”
“No, it isn’t,” Cas said flatly, looking up at the two of them. “Because if the witch is dead, then why is Dean still cursed?”
She gave him an only mildly suspicious look before agreeing and leaving to get her phone from the kitchen. That left him alone with Cas again, and he really wasn’t sure what he wanted to do or say. Cas didn’t seem sure either. Dean thought you probably could have heard a pin drop in the silence between them.
, Billie banged on the door.
That’s what this place felt like.
They made it to Utah by early afternoon and stopped for lunch about an hour outside Salt Lake City. Wahsatch wasn’t really known for anything except being in the middle of the mountains, but even so, it was beautiful. They picked up some deli food from a Gas-N-Sip on main street and took a detour at the first lookout they came across. Dean had pretty much seen every scenic detour the American midwest had to offer during his lifetime on the road with Sam and his father, but there was still something breathtaking about the snow capped peaks stretching for miles in front of them. Something that made him feel small.
Before either of them even had time to register it was happening, the girl slapped him across the face. Hard.
Dean knew that tone. It was a bait if he’d ever heard one. Instead of rising to it, he simply said, “Okay, have fun.”
He barely caught Donnie’s amused smile as he disappeared into the crowd.
It was around that time that the bathroom door opened, and Sam lost Dean’s attention entirely. Cas watched warily as Dean’s eyes followed him from the entrance of the bathroom until he was standing not two feet in front of them. Dean himself was acting beyond weird, maybe the weirdest he’d been all morning, and that was saying something.
“Yeah, well,” Cas laughed, “he kind of was.”
The rest of the drive was a straight shot down I-80, and only about four hours later, they arrived at Half Moon Bay. It was a tourist destination, but not so much in late November.
It was a morning like pretty much any other in the godless universe they now lived in. Well, not fully godless, Dean supposed. Jack was somewhere out there doing his all-powerful celestial being thing, and that counted for something.
“I can’t believe you let Sam talk you into eating rabbit food.”
Dean opened his eyes and looked down to find Donnie’s suddenly very concerned face staring back at him.
The werewolf growled, “Victoria, don’t do this.”
“Me neither,” he admitted.
“I’ve got a break in fifteen,” he shot over his shoulder. “If you’re still looking for some fun.”
Then at the same time, they both spoke.
Dean asked, “The morgue?”
Cas sighed, markedly less amused this time, and asked, “What is it with you and the harp?”
The air around Dean grew cold in his absence, and that choking feeling from his nightmare thrust itself into the front of his mind. He reached out and grabbed Donnie’s arm, and said, “Wait, no, I’m fine.”
“I’ve thrown a few people out of a few bars in my day,” Dean replied. “Hell, it might have even been fun. God knows I could use some of that right now.”
And well, that sobered Dean right up. He reached his hand across the table and set it on top of Cas’s, squeezing his palm tightly.
Dean nodded a little warily, and Cas could tell that the name hadn’t done any good this time. It was just like any other random set of words to the man in front of him. Dean looked at Cas quickly before darting his eyes down to the bed, hands fidgeting with the hem of the comforter.
“Well, what happened next?” Dean asked.
? Cas, I’ve been fucking devastated.”
“Uh,” Dean hedged, “don’t know.”
“What?” Dean asked, clearly indignant. “You homophobic or something?”
“You know he wasn’t going to stop,” he said, bluntly but not unkindly.
Cas quirked a smile at him and replied, “Okay.”
Donnie tipped his cup once again as well before downing most of his like a shot. Dean whistled.
“I’d like that,” he said. “Don’t be a stranger.”
“Oh right, obviously,” he said, “it’s good to see you, buddy.”
It felt like that flash of
Dean sighed. He said, “First thing I’m doing when we get back to the bunker is installing a lock on my bedroom door.”
“Whoa,” Dean said, drawing out the word in amazement.
She took a sip of some kind of iced green tea concoction and said, “Yep. Turns out it’s one of the only places the other me didn’t already have a dead or missing alias.
There wasn’t much Dean could say in response to that, so he didn’t.
Donnie followed his cue, and his kisses became rough. Biting.
“I couldn’t tell you,” she shrugged. “Rafe went on break, and the two of you got to talking. I didn’t see you after that, but apparently you went running out the back door like your pants caught on fire. Rafe said you were supposed to meet up after close up, but you never showed.”
“You were… amazing,” she admitted. Dean grinned, and Sam inhaled and exhaled slowly. He had a feeling he was about to have to intervene before this conversation went entirely off the rails.
Dean felt like he’d been slapped across the face. He watched, dumbfounded, as Sam stormed off towards the Impala.
Dean shrieked, “Oh my God, is that a dead body?!”
Dean shrugged.
Dean washed his bite of turkey sandwich down and turned to face him.
They finished the job in one night and were back home in time for dinner.
“Well then, we retrace his steps,” Cas pointed out practically.
Sam frowned and asked, “Well, where are you now?”
No one answered, of course, and he wasn’t really sure if saying it had helped or not. Maybe it didn’t really matter.
Dean’s eyes shot up from the television, and Cas was giving him a knowing look.
Dean took absolute joy in forcing Cas to watch all of his favorite movies and listen to the music he was raised on, of course, but there was just something super endearing about realizing that Cas really liked watching Friends and knew every word to most Lizzo songs. He and Sam honestly bonded over a lot more common interests than he did with Dean, but that was okay. The morning he’d walked in on Cas singing Truth Hurts while making breakfast would probably live in his head rent free for the rest of his life.
“Talk to me, Dean, please,” Sam tried.
“Eileen and I are going to be gone for a couple of days,” he said conversationally instead as he reached for the pot of coffee that someone must have brewed before Dean woke up. He continued, “One of Eileen’s hunting buddies called, said they needed help clearing out a vamp nest in Omaha.”
She cut her eyes at him quickly before looking back down at her phone and answering, “Jody.”
“We can go, you know,” he said, “if you want to.”
Dean stared at him for a moment, his gaze trailing over Cas’s features, before he visibly calmed. He nodded.
Sam huffed out a laugh and said, “Yeah, okay, I’m going to make a smoothie.”
“What are you doing up anyways?” he asked her.
“Hey, that’s the girl from the waffle place.”
“I was just calling to check on you guys,” Sam went on. “You didn’t call yesterday.”
Cas’s smile widened, and he leaned back in to bury his head in the crook of Dean’s shoulder and wrap his arms around him in a tight hug as he replied, “I love you, too.”
Then the phone disconnected and Sam sighed. He turned to Cas.
“Oh, really?” Sam asked, turning back to the server now.
“What?” Dean asked.
Dean was self-aware enough to admit that it was nice, knowing that they had this
“Dude, my best friend is an angel! Whaaaaaaat?!”
“Then you’ll have to shoot me too,” she said defiantly.
takes him, and I...”
Meanwhile, it hadn’t taken Jack very long to figure out a way into the Empty. He promised to restore the peace and quiet that he’d disrupted, forever, on the condition that Cas could leave for good. The Empty agreed with a condition of its own. In order for Cas to never return, he had to no longer be a celestial being destined for a supernatural afterlife. In the end, Jack held the door open while Dean marched right in and pulled Cas out with him, and with the promise of a new and better world to live in, Cas willingly handed over his grace.
“That’s what you get for never knocking,” Dean said, his voice smug and not even slightly embarrassed.
“Why are you telling me this?” Dean asked.
Cas leaned in to kiss him once more, much less passionately than before but still hoping to convey every ounce of love he felt for the ridiculous man in front of him. When he pulled away, Dean was giving him a much shyer smile.
Sam followed his gaze, and sure enough, there was the girl who had slapped Dean earlier. If anyone was going to be able to tell them what Dean had gotten up to the night before, she seemed to be the best bet. Clearly he’d managed to piss her off somehow.
Donnie gave him a pitying smile, which Dean immediately hated, and said, “No, you’re not. Look, I think you should drink some water before you head home. I’ve got to get back to work anyway.”
Dean stopped and honed in on one of Barry shaking a younger man’s hand. Then he shook his head and turned back to Sam and Cas.
He turned around and found Dean still standing behind him, thankfully, but he was staring again. He had an odd look on his face, embarrassed almost, as he watched Cas rooting around through the underbrush.
Sam replied, “My thoughts exactly.”
Fuck it.
He nodded his head, looking pleased with himself for what he’d managed to retain, and Cas exhaled.
“Yeah, you sure look like it,” Sam replied.
Sam sucked in a breath and let it out slowly. He said, “You know what, Dean? You’re right. Everything’s perfect, just the way you wanted it.”
Except that shed light on another obvious problem. Dean had next to zero memory of his previous night. The only thing he sort of remembered was going to the deceased accountant’s office, which had been roughly around 4pm. For lack of better options, Sam figured it was a place to start at least.
“Dude, what’s wrong with you?” he asked. “It’s just Cas.”
“I like to think so,” Cas agreed. Then he exhaled carefully and continued, “The man showed the angel that there was more to life than following orders. There was a right and a wrong, and there was good in the world that was worth fighting for. He taught the angel about family… and love. Because of the righteous man, the angel saw everything in the world in a new light, and he cared about it. For the first time, in his very long life, he felt.”
Dean swallowed roughly and said, “You have no idea how turned on I am right now.”
“I’m bored,” Dean whined.
He reached over and took Cas’s hand and laced their fingers together.
About a million thoughts sprung to his mind at once, but none of them managed to become words as he slowly lowered his gun in dumbfounded silence.
He’d gone to Sunday school once or twice as a kid when his dad had dropped him and Sam off with Pastor Jim for the weekend. The teacher had been a crotchety old woman who smelled like peppermints and threatened more than once to whack him over the head with her Bible. Not who Dean would have picked to nurture the minds of young children, but whatever. He’d heard her tell the Genesis creation story once though.
The next morning, Dean made breakfast while Claire sat at the table with her phone in her hands. She wasn’t usually the chatty type to begin with, but she’d been silently typing all morning every time he’d glanced in her direction.
“Holy shit, you really drove Baby,” he said.
Cas squirmed against him as he settled and let his arm come to rest around Dean’s waist.
The next day led them through Nevada, which was mostly more desert still. While being stuck in the desert wasn’t exactly appealing, there was something undeniably a little fun about driving through it in the daytime. The wind was dry and the sun warm on his skin, despite the cooler temperatures, as Dean rolled down his window and let his arm rest on the edge of it. Springsteen was playing on the one radio station he could get to come in clearly, and he’d left it alone because Cas was humming along. There was something a little funny about an angel of the lord quietly singing Born in the U.S.A, but Dean decided against commenting on it. It was surprisingly fun figuring out what Cas liked about human pop culture.
“Oh, well that’s good then,” Dean replied, only sounding a little more relieved than freaked out.
He reached for his whiskey and spilled a couple drops as he clumsily bumped into it with his fist.
Sam rolled his eyes and said, “Let’s go.”
“Wow,” Dean breathed, “that’s badass.”
He looked up and saw first what must have been the other witch, and then Sam running down after him. The sound of Dean’s gun cocking again behind him caught his attention though, and he looked to see Dean frantically pointing the weapon between the two men.
Dean rolled his eyes.
Which is probably why it all went to hell in a handbasket.
“He’s not dead,” Dean snapped.
“Then what was it like?” Dean demanded, his voice rising in volume. “Because the way I see it, we’re finally free of Chuck and all his mind games, but I’m still not really free, am I? How can I be when I’m living a
They made it to Reno for lunch, which was incidentally where Charlie was staying. Dean hadn’t really gotten the chance to catch up with her after Jack brought everyone back, but he’d been thinking about her. She wasn’t his Charlie, not really anyways. The girl he’d loved like a little sister was long gone, but it was still her deep down and that meant something to him. So, he sent off a quick text after Cas took over the last part of the morning’s drive and hoped she’d respond.
“So, Nevada,” he said as an introduction.
“I think we found our witch,” he said.
, the thought entered his mind like a brick to the face. For just a second, his heart dropped into his stomach, and it pulled him up short.
Dean stopped on a Star Trek rerun and smiled as he let his head drop on top of Cas’s and pressed a kiss against his temple. Better things worth spending his time doing.
Dean held it up like a sword and swung it around a few times, which raised Cas’s blood pressure by more than a few points. Then his eyes met Cas’s unamused look, and he sheepishly put it back in the bag where it came from. If only the real Dean Winchester was that easy.
Dean stared at her, watched the way she didn’t even flinch at the harsh words leaving her own mouth. It was like looking in a mirror at his own eighteen year old self, and it didn’t make him feel better.
“You didn’t need to come,” Charlie said by way of greeting.
Still, with all that newfound freedom and happiness, Dean was never made to sit still for very long. He eventually got so restless around the bunker that Sam finally snapped and practically pushed him out the door, arguing that some fresh air would be good for him and Cas. Eileen’s tongue in cheek smile betrayed his real motivations, but Dean had agreed anyway.
Cas squinted at Dean and then turned to Sam.
“Wait,” he said, “what are you sorry for?”
“Whoa, Dean, are you okay?” Sam’s voice pierced through the haze and yanked him back to the present.
“Jesus, oh my God,” he shouted.
Sam raised his eyebrows at him in disbelief, but Dean only cut him a quick glance before looking back at the server.
The bed dipped beside him as Cas sat down and scooted towards the center. Dean sent off the message and sat his phone back where he’d found it. He turned to see Cas staring at him with a soft smile.
“You gotta admit it would be cool,” Dean insisted.
It was probably undignified, the way he threw himself into Cas, but he couldn’t bring himself to care as he wrapped his arms around him and gripped the fabric of the familiar trenchcoat in his hands. Cas didn’t say anything in response, but he returned the embrace just as fiercely.
He asked, “How is Stevie?”
“You forgot how to drive!” Sam said. Then something occurred to him, which honestly he should have thought of immediately. “What if you’ve been hexed?”
“Couldn’t sleep,” she said. Then she looked up at him as she added, “Sam says you’re not sleeping either.”
She didn’t stop to clarify, but they did receive glares from several of her friends.
He didn’t continue with his question, but Cas watched as he scooted closer and leaned in, slowly, until he could rest his head gently against Cas’s shoulder.
He brought his hand up in a fist and punched the tree in front of him. The bark stung as it scraped across his knuckles, but he punched it again and again until he knew he was bleeding. He stopped then, if only because he didn’t want to have to explain to Sam what he’d done, and leaned back against the tree behind him instead and closed his eyes. Honestly, he wasn’t sure himself why he’d done it.
“Guys, really?!” Sam called.
Just as Dean was getting lost in the push and pull, Donnie punctuated his lips with one more kiss before trailing his mouth along Dean’s jaw to nibble at the sensitive skin there. Dean gripped his shoulders tight and tipped his head back. Then Donnie stopped cold.
“I always wanted you there,” he said honestly.
“Who the hell is Rafe?!” he called after her.
A miracle, maybe, or more likely, for the other shoe to drop. It always did with them.
“If you don’t find the grimoire and thus the way to reverse the spell, the curse will keep erasing his memories until eventually, he doesn’t remember how to swallow or breathe, and then, well,” she looked over her shoulder in Dean’s direction, “Dean Winchester will die.”
“Sam, Dean. Look.”
Cas simply looked out at the mountains again though as a small smile pulled at the corner of his mouth.
“Sam, hey!”
Cas replied, “Maybe you need higher standards if you think gas station coffee is a luxury.”
Dean gasped. Then he not so quietly whispered, “Witches are
Sam wrinkled his eyebrows as he looked to Cas then back at Dean.
He could still hear Dean and Cas bickering behind him, which was one welcome sign of normalcy at least, as he paced to the other side of the room to make the call. Rowena, although more amused than she should have been by the whole thing, confirmed that it was a witchy curse called ‘obliviate’. The good news was that they should be able to cure it by killing the witch, which is what they were there to do in the first place.
There was something else too, though, something itching under his skin that he couldn’t quite name.
He gestured to the other side of the motel room and waited for her to follow him before walking a few feet away from Dean, who immediately started rifling through Rowena’s bag.
Sam gritted his teeth before throwing his hands into the air.
“Why not?” Dean asked, the fire fully stoked inside him now. “You’re the one who keeps asking if I’m okay, and you know what? Maybe I’m not. Lately, it’s like something’s going on in my head that even I can’t figure out.” He took in Sam’s nervous posture and flighty glance, and suddenly it clicked into place for him. “You knew that though, didn’t you?”
A few hours later found him and Sam on the road, Nebraska bound.
Dean’s jaw dropped a little as he practically sputtered, “
“Rough night?” he asked.
“Brother!” Sam yelled, then he pointed to the other man who had frozen on the landing and said, “Witch!”
the Impala into a dumpster,” he said.
Once they’d hugged and stepped apart, she turned her gaze to Dean.
Without giving it a single thought, because he was fucking tired of only thinking about it, he said, “I love you.”
“I know,” Cas said, “and I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”
Cas nodded down at the mattress, and Dean said, “Hey.”
Cas placed a hand on Sam’s shoulder, and Sam glanced at it before looking back up at him.
She threw herself between the end of Charlie’s gun and the werewolf, and Dean groaned.
“Why,” Donnie asked, “were you planning on being my knight in shining armor?”
“Why are we in the woods?” he whined. “It’s dark. I wanna go home.”
“Alright, fine,” he said. “It sucks. Is that what you want to hear? He’s gone, and I can’t sleep because every time I close my eyes, I see him smiling as that, that
Dean traced his thumb softly across Cas’s cheekbone.
“What, like a pack?” Sam asked.
Dean actually wasn’t sure if he was going to or not, to be honest. He knew Sam was curious, and it wasn’t exactly fair for Dean to be keeping the details to himself because Sam and Cas had been friends too. It still felt too raw to even think about though, much less talk about. He kind of thought that not saying it outloud might be the only thing keeping him from falling completely apart.
He was cut off by the look on Dean’s face.
Sam turned back to the server, who was now giving them an amused smirk.
Dean couldn’t find the words around the lump that had taken residence in his throat, so he took a couple of steadying breaths instead and nodded.
“I suppose we could,” he agreed.
It was just a dream. Again.
Cas hummed his agreement as he crawled back up Dean’s body and pressed him into the pillows again.
He scooted back against the headboard, pointedly making room for Dean beside him, and some of the terror retreated from Dean’s face as he scooted back in. He laid his head on Cas’s shoulder a little more confidently this time, and Cas wrapped one arm around him.
“You could come too, you know,” he said. “It might be good for you.”
The drive was long, but not unbearably so, and soon enough they were parked at the diner Stevie had sent them directions to.
cool.”
It had been three weeks, two days, and six hours since Cas disappeared.
Cas’s words brought the swirling flood of emotions in Dean’s mind narrowing down to a single point as he felt a little bit of anger rise within him.
What the absolute
“I listened to it when I wanted to be with you instead,” he admitted.
“R for reverse,” he said pointedly, feeling his patience dwindling. He fixed Dean with a hard glare. “Look, I know we’ve been through a lot lately, and it sort of makes me want to get blackout drunk too, but we’re in the middle of a job right now. You have got to pull yourself together.” Dean didn’t look up, just kept staring at the steering wheel like he’d never seen it before. Sam was about .5 seconds away from kicking him out of the driver’s seat. He snapped, “Dean!”
There was a pause as he opened up his contacts to search for Bonnie and Ricardo’s numbers. They were plenty smart enough to handle whatever this was, and besides the brief, instinctual drive to act, he honestly didn’t want to pursue the hunt. For once, there were other things in his life worth spending his time doing.
“Yeah, of course,” she said quickly.
He and Cas were hiding from Billie in the bunker. Cas told him about a deal he’d made with the Empty to save Jack’s life, and then he’d started saying a lot of things all at once. That Dean had changed him, had made him care about the whole world. That he loved Dean.
“Wait!” Cas shouted.
“Yep,” Dean nodded, “don’t know how that happened either. Think I blacked out. Judging by this hangover though, it must have been an epic night.”
Dean exhaled as a fond feeling spread through his chest and wrapped itself around his ribs. He lifted his arm and dropped it around Cas’s shoulders, pulling him into his side.
He asked, “Would you like for me to tell you a story?”
She threw herself into his arms as she cried, and he rubbed her back awkwardly. She was young, couldn’t be older than sixteen. How she’d gotten into all this mess was beyond him, but this was the only way it was ever going to end. He had to keep telling himself that as she cried her eyes out against his shoulder.
Sam laughed, and he thought if he didn’t know better, Cas might have been blushing a little bit.
“I’m fine,” Dean told him.
Then he had the audacity to
“Maybe I’m just following your example,” she replied.
“Had to break up a fight earlier,” Donnie replied, wincing around the burn of the whiskey as it went down. “Just the usual suspects, you know. Not much else to do in this town other than cause trouble.”
He turned to see Claire staring with a shocked look on her face, and then she was barrelling past him to nearly knock Cas over with a hug of her own. Cas looked up at Dean in surprise briefly before bringing one hand up to hug her back.
“Wait,” Dean interrupted, and Cas concealed a huff of amusement as Dean asked, “angels are real?!”
He’d tried the whole apple pie life thing once, with decidedly unsatisfactory results. After how terribly things had ended with Lisa, he’d pretty much given up on the idea of it altogether. There was always some new crisis to avert, some new fuck up to fix. He’d pretty much come around to the idea that he’d die bloody before he ever saw the chance to stop fighting, whether by apocalypse or some terrible accident. Here he was though, not a single world-ending problem knocking at the door, with the love of his life at his side for the rest of their human lives. It was almost more freedom than he could figure out what to do with.
“I did
Darkness surrounded Dean, and still, he walked.
He shrugged, “Guess not.”
Claire finally smiled at him in response to that, and Dean cleared his throat.
He glanced down at Dean, who was still curled into his side, and knew that they had to go. So, he gently roused Dean and got them both up and into the car. It was pretty clear that Dean wasn’t going to be able to drive, so Cas almost preemptively apologized as he took the keys out of Dean’s pocket and climbed into the driver’s seat. Despite Dean’s qualms about anyone touching his Baby, Cas was actually a decent driver, and it didn’t take him long to get them going in the right direction, following Sam’s location drop on his phone.
Sam sighed and worked his jaw. It was the look he got when he knew Dean was right, but he didn’t like it.
Sam exhaled as he stared at Dean, his mouth in a thin line. Then he said, “Look, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have...I’m sorry.”
Then, because he couldn’t help himself, he added, “And Cas is an angel.”
“I’m going to bed,” he said.
He took the second cup from Cas and leaned back into his own seat to take a sip.
Dean looked back at the TV for a moment, and then he changed the channel. He reached for his phone on the nightstand.
Sam asked, “Are you sure?”
“You know you’re not supposed to be drinking that,” he said in lieu of a greeting.
He glanced down at Cas’s lips, and Cas tracked the movement, but then Sam banged loudly on the door.
Dean’s expression brightened considerably, and he nodded. Cas scooted over, making space for Dean to sit against the headboard with him, and Dean followed easily. Cas waited for him to settle down before he began.
Cas rose immediately and asked, “Okay, where’s the witch?”
“Like this,” he said. “Don’t do anything with it unless I tell you to, but when you’re ready, cock it like this,” he clicked off the safety and cocked the gun, “then point it and squeeze the trigger.”
Well, that couldn’t have gone any fucking worse. He slumped back against the sink and rubbed at his inexplicably wet eyes.
“It looked like he was headed for the woods, but the bullet casing should confirm which direction Dean fired,” Cas said, already standing and turning to leave the room.
Cas sighed and couldn’t help but laugh a little as he took the gun and put it in Dean’s hands the correct way.
Dean looked like he had something else to say about that, because of course he did, but thankfully Cas cut them off before he could open his mouth again.
Cas replied, “That depends. How would you feel about it if you did?”
“It’s Cas,” Sam said, “your best friend?”
Dean turned to him and grinned around a mouthful of waffles. He had the good manners to at least swallow before saying, “Hiya, Sammy.”
She turned back to Rowena, another piece of glass raised in her hand, and Cas shouted, “Now, Dean!”
When Sam arrived at the diner, Dean was predictably already shoveling waffles into his mouth like it was his last meal on death row. Sam made a face as he pulled up a chair.
He said, “Damn right it wasn’t. Cas, you don’t even know what I…”
“Yep,” Dean said. “Epic night.”
. Freak.”
Dean and Cas spoke at the exact same time.
Instead, he swallowed roughly as he said, “Well, then maybe he shouldn’t have left.”
Dean looked over at him and felt a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth at the awed look he saw.
Only an echoing silence responded, so he yelled again. The room didn’t crumble around him under the weight of his fury though. It still stood there, just as it was that night, and he suddenly felt a wave of nausea come over him. It had been a stupid idea to come back here.
He couldn’t resist saying, “I thought you stood on, like, the first beach ever created or something.”
'Take the bed, Cas. I can sleep on the couch. I'm used to it.'
Dean grinned. 'No. But I will if you punch me.' He pushed himself up and held out a hand.
Any hesitance he might have felt disintegrated when faced with the thought of spending time with Jess. Jess was as sweet as sugar and sharp enough to cut someone. She was the smartest person Sam had ever met, and the funniest. She was a spider-rescuer like Anna. She was a play-fighter like Dean. She loved orange juice, the color blue, and biology. Sam couldn't imagine that anyone could be warmer, more welcoming, or more fascinating than Jessica. Thanksgiving couldn't get there fast enough.
'I'm spending it with Benny's family.'
'Go get 'em, tiger,' she whispered, and stubbed her joint out under her foot, grinding it into Dean's lawn. If looks could kill, Dean thought. Crowley simply stared at Dean expectantly, raising his eyebrows. Dean knew Crowley was waiting for him to wuss out, so he glared at him and turned to walk across Cas' lawn, the box heavy in his arms. For some reason, he couldn't stop thinking about that stupid stocking.
Dean pushes and Cas pulls and together they jimmy the pallet and manage to get it out of the car and balanced between them. They walk down the street, not talking much, concentrating on balancing the mountain of bread they're holding. Dean feels something building in the air. He's not sure what it is but it's a delicious kind of tension and Dean feels the night open up around them. Breezes ruffle their shirts and cars swish by, music blares from one of the housing complexes, weeds flare up and loom at the edges of the sidewalk. It smells like sweet smoke and grit and opportunity. They can barely see but for the occasional streetlight. The sky is flushed a dark, deep purple, clouds like bruises scud along the horizon. Dean has a sudden craving for a cigarette, a wish to be speeding in a car with drunken strangers and no destination. Something destructive, something to grit his teeth to.
'Your family makes Christmas look so...'
Dean felt a muscle in his jaw twitch. 'Never.'
'Aaron. I haven't seen you here before, are you new?'
He shakes his head dismally. 'It's a long story. My brother, Michael, he gave me the job. It's a pity thing. Until I can get back on my feet.'
'Are you okay?' Dean opens his eyes, feeling short of breath. Cas looks alarmed. Dean gives his head a little shake and exhales. He smiles weakly. Cas frowns at him. 'Do you need me to get you anything?'
'Sleep tight, Sammy. Dad will be here before you know it.'
'Yeah, I'm fine. I just – um – how do I carry these?'
When Castiel was younger and his parents worked, he used to sneak out of school and go to Mrs. McGuirk's house. She had been in the house next door for what felt like forever, and she was the perfect companion for a quiet anxious child. She was chatty in an absent-minded way unless she had her nose in a book or a jazz record on. She never expected anything of Castiel and gave him free reign over her house and backyard, where he would sit and read her books in a cocoon of silence or climb trees to pretend he was a jungle cat. She had never chastised him for skipping school, and that bond forged from a shared secret was essential and comforting throughout Castiel's teenage years. She was the first person Castiel had come out to, and she was the opposite of surprised. It was Mrs. McGuirk who'd taught his brothers Gabe and Jimmy to bake. She had tried to teach Castiel and Hannah as well, but they were more interested in eating her food than replicating it. Her house had been one of the safe havens of his childhood, an oasis of calm he could always depend on. Castiel had grown up as she had grown older, and they were still close.

” Dean repeats, voice breaking mid-sentence, and the heels of his palms pressed to his eyes.
He places his slinky on the bed, and leans back against the wood of his bedframe. It was obviously hilarious that Cas assumed these things had to be won against fighters, in battle. Though Dean wonders if he actually thought so, or was just pulling the pretend-oblivious act, just because.
Grabs his shirt, leans at least ninety percent of the way, and crashes their lips together. Anxious and insistent, and immediately kissed back with a very typical
“Babe, you okay?”
"So," Cas blinks. "I bought some."
. Stupid, glorious eyes, laugh, voice —
“Maine?” Cas ventures, with growing confidence, for a smile - history assures him that Dean’ll join in, and he almost does. Only a wisp, but it’s there.
. And
“Dean - uh, Cas? Can we - ?” He clears his throat, tentatively. Tilts his head in the direction of the impala, and holds a hand out for the keys. “I could drive.”
If they’d been gross before - this was taking it to a whole new level. Literally.
"Screw you both," Dean gets up, picking up his slinky. Because that's all he's going to let himself think of it, as. Dean Winchester, hunter of forty rugged years, doesn't play with toys. Hence, it's not a friggin' toy. "I don't need to take this. I'll be in my room if you find anything on the vamp-shifters."
“Would you rather have me drive?”
meeting his lips in a kiss.
Cas props himself on the Impala’s hood too, crossing his legs unlike Dean. “And now what?”
"Mm-hmm."
I mean, that little shit’s off to London, and I shouldn’t even give a shit, but everyone’s leaving, Cas, and it just adds to the damn pile. And apparently I’m a

“I’ll call you back, babe.” Dean comes back to add in a rush, and Cas sucks in a painful breath, slowly beginning to feel like the only thing keeping him conscious any more is the sensation of air in his lungs, in his mouth, in the back of his throat. “Still have to ask what you even called about, you know. Or maybe if you just missed me.” He beams, he obviously
“Hello, Dean.” Maybe he manages to not sound weird, or Dean’s just not listening for clues. The loud racket behind him, at Bobby (and Dean’s) automobile shop, helps as well.
“You still want me.” Dean whispers, like it’s a secret. Or maybe a lie. Or more definitively, an accusation. Why would Cas still kiss him like that?

His hands clutch the phone tighter, neck rendering him incapable of looking anymore, so he has no idea what his thumbs are trying to type — but it doesn’t matter, not really, because this is
He goes on once he’s picked up the bouquet, cleared his throat, and forced down the annoying heat rising to his cheeks to the best of his abilities. He goes on, holding the flowers for Cas.
“Me too.” Cas whispers, pulling away the moment he thinks he’s established enough background for this conversation. Dean almost follows him an inch before returning to his senses, eyes fluttering open, mouth agape. “I mean, I love you too.
He giggles, and
And as he waits for the
Cas feels his heart swell. Dean looks up slowly, seeking out Cas’s eyes, and Cas holds his gaze, and just like that, they’re back to saying things without any words.
that's what it is for sure.
"Why?"
“I opened my door in your face.” Dean points out.
“I mean, there’s -
"Huh?" Sam looks up.
It’s not a lot of words, and not the most eloquent Cas has ever been, but it conveys so much that it almost stuns Dean again. He nods, jerkily.
It’s too far away to drive, if urgency strikes. They’d have to fly. Especially now that they could.
“Did you mean it?” He repeats, and Dean’s about to launch into a string of fondly chosen expletives before Cas adds, “Did you mean the part where you said you’d…follow me to college?”
I’m friggin' elated Charlie got into MIT, but she’s just - god, I’m going to miss her so much
Cas smiles. "Of course."
But it still hardly made sense.
Not that he had much of one right now — he isn’t sure if he can call Dean’s family
“Cas.” Dean breathes out, as Cas starts to dissociate, focusing himself deep within. Dean stares openly, for Cas’s eyes are closed now, as he reaches through the realms to gather himself. “
This time though, Cas has no idea how he's misunderstood anything — but he still pauses to listen.
“More of an of course.” Castiel tells him as he smiles, and Dean smiles back, his insides still fluttering, but at least his chest feels warm instead of frozen.
“Fine. You don’t gotta look at me.” A pause. Then, more shaky. “I was so scared, Cas. So fucking terrified. They said they weren’t sure, said it may be too late, and you were

Cas kisses him back eagerly, and Dean wonders if he’s accidentally acquired the remnants of Cas’s grace when they pull apart, because he could

“In what kind of possession do you not feel me dying, Cas?” Dean throws back, obviously exaggerating because he’s stopped coughing. “What are you, detached?” He’s returned to the slightly irritated voice Sam’s matched with the man standing in front of him, for around thirty eight years now.
“It’s almost like —” Cas stops completely, squirming as he tries to remember the word. “
And then they're settling in on opposite edges of Baby's front seat, Cas muttering a smug, "Shotgun," and Dean objectively losing it because angels he's in love with have no business being that adorable about seating arrangements, and then finally, he turns the key and the engine roars to life, and they're off.
Cas looks like he wants to say something. Then he looks like he wants to say something else. And then he looks like he wants to kiss Dean again.
he has a timeframe to figure out his next move within.
Neither of them has uttered a word since they fell like this on the bed, tangled in each other, just basking in the lazy ecstasy which follows sex. Their chests have stopped heaving, and their hearts have stopped thudding - but they’ve not moved apart.
"I'd like to come with." Dean explains, uncertain now, posture bordering on shy. "If you don't mind."
Cas nods, faintly. He still isn’t sure where Dean’s going with this.
, and there was never someone who deserved it more — so of course somebody will.
“I’m not sure where we’re at, motor-functions-wise. Hand-eye coordination isn’t all we need.” Cas returns, matter-of-factly. “Possession is easier. I’ve never shared a body before.”
Castiel would, and has given up his life for Dean Winchester. He’s charred, ruined, and lost his wings. Yet now, the angel shall show him how to
“I wanted -” His voice trembles. Maybe he moves closer to Cas. “I thought it was clear what I wanted.”
“How do you know I’m not going to be scared?” Dean throws back, still vulnerable, but a lot more himself. It’s a challenge, a flame disguised as a rhetoric, but Cas treats it like a question. And answers, as plainly as he can.
Cas looks back at it.

Dean ducks his head, as if actually shy, and it’s so endearing that Cas can’t
"Then why do they make them in men's sizes?"
Castiel lets the air stuck in his chest out, and it probably makes up for a small chuckle. He doesn’t want to lie, he just won’t agree.
