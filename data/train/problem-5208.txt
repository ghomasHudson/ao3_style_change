The Mechanic slumped, then to Castiel’s confusion, began laughing softly. “That’s just who I am I guess. When I work on equipment, say a locomotive, or a fartalker, I do things the best way I can. Not the easy way. Pretty sure I’m like that with everything. The Senior Mechanics, my uh, my ‘Elders,’ haven’t always appreciated my willingness to do what’s hard instead of just taking the easy way out.” He sighed, eyes gazing bleakly at nothing. “From what I saw of the road to the pass, it was wide open. We’d have been seen and run down in no time. So going up the side of the pass was harder, but it was also the option that was least likely to kill us.”
“What? Me?” He stared at him. “Why do you think that?”
For a moment, he felt his youth and inexperience so heavily that he could not even think. The Mechanic spoke again, his voice sharp. “We’ve gotta get out of here.” Then, he looked startled. “I mean-” Castiel understood his hesitation. He could not imagine spending time in his company either, even under these circumstances.
“No, that’s-” He swallowed as his voice broke off. “Bandits. They wanted to loot the caravan. That’s what bandits do.”
He knew no Mechanic would catch any bitterness leaking through his control over his voice as he answered. “My Guild has declared me a Mage. But, being inexperienced, my price is less than that of older Mages. The caravan could not afford more.”
The bandits had not yet noticed the Mage lagging behind him.
“Damn it! We’ve gotta get outta here. Can you climb by yourself?”
Castiel had to pause to get enough breath to answer. “Why do you ask this? Why do you keep asking such things?”
Only the Mechanics defied the Mages, and they were beneath notice, or so Castiel had been told. The Mechanics believed that they also ruled this world. The idea would have been amusing, if Mages ever allowed themselves amusement. “What numbers and sort of bandits might we encounter?” Castiel heard the continued lack of any emotion in his voice with satisfaction. This might be the first time that he had actually faced danger of this kind, but no Common would be able to tell that.
“No.” Castiel let the flat word stand alone. Some Mages did have occasional flashes of foresight, warning of what was to come, but never reliably. And he had never felt that gift himself. The Elders said that stress or danger could bring foresight to life in a Mage, but Castiel would not explain any of that to a Common. “Why does Ringhmon not garrison the pass?”
The Commander of the guard rode not far from Castiel’s carriage. Castiel raised one hand slightly, turning his head just enough to look at the Commander. Commonfolk avoided looking directly at Mages, but they knew to respond when a Mage beckoned. Tugging at the reins, the Commander brought his horse over to trudge next to Castiel’s carriage. The Commander pulled down the scarf protecting his nose and mouth, then slid up the goggles covering his eyes, so that his face was visible. Only then did he bow as deeply as permitted by his position in the saddle. “Yes, Sir Mage?”
As the Mechanic reached a long ledge and swung past a cluster of rocks, some figures suddenly emerged. Two had crossbows, and the third had a strange weapon with a hole in the end like the Mechanic’s hand weapon. All were pointing their weapons at him. The Mechanic had frozen in the act of bringing up his hand weapon, staring at the bandits, clearly realizing that he was trapped.
Syndari: sin-dahr-ee
“You have no idea what I’m talking about?”
The Mechanic gazed at him, some other emotion he couldn’t identify showing on his face now. “You don’t know what helping others means? You don’t believe people should help others?”
The driver of Castiel’s carriage had been staring open-mouthed at the crater where the lead wagons of the caravan had once been, as he fought to control the panicked oxen pulling it. Now, the driver jerked backward, as if he had been hit with a crossbow bolt, then flopped forward. All around, Castiel could hear people shouting and screaming over the strange thunder, and see dust or splinters spurting up where some sort of projectiles were hitting. Oxen bellowed with terror and pain, dropping to the dust to lie limp in their harness. The guard Commander was roaring out orders, his goggled face impossible to read, but his voice frantic. Sudden gouts of dust erupted from his clothes, and he fell to lie motionless, causing his horse to panic and flee.
The Mechanic looked aggravated at his response. “You think there’s something weird about being worried about someone else?” He could not think of an answer to that. “Stars above!” The Mechanic said. “What’s the matter with you? We’re in this together, like it or not. And no, I don’t really like it either. But we do what we have to do, Mage.”
“I do not either.”
Castiel was once again calling forth heat above his hand, his own remaining strength and the residual power both draining like water into the spell. He had a moment to realize that it would have been very easy for him to run while the bandits were occupied capturing the Mechanic, but rejected the idea before it had fully formed. In the time required to create the spell, one bandit’s finger twitched on the trigger of his crossbow. The Mechanic might have died then, but the bandit with the strange weapon struck aside the crossbow so that its bolt flew harmlessly away.
dean and cas get farther away from the bandits and finally tell each other their names so i don't have to write really confusing sentences anymore where i have to repeat the words he and him like ten times but can't say dean's name
“You? Protect me? A Mage, protect me?” The Mechanic seemed to forget his fear momentarily as outrage bloomed. “That’s-”
“I believe so. All I saw were dead. I heard no sounds from anyone fighting or calling out offers to surrender.”
“Just a minute, can you stand?” After Castiel nodded, the Mechanic let go of him and spun to pick up the strange metal object, which was longer than his arm. Castiel gazed at the thing, noting that it bore some resemblance to a crossbow, except that it was longer and lacked the bow portion. The metal gleamed dully under a sheen of dust. A pungent smell came from it, sharp, but with a deep and oily undertone. He felt a strange urge to examine it more closely, but since it was obviously of Mechanic make, he knew that would be foolish. His teachers had warned him of the traps mechanics placed on their devices.
Light flashed off something high up on the wall of the pass. Armor? Or a weapon, warned Castiel’s lessons in the military ways of the Commons. Before he could react in any way, the earth beneath the front wagons of the caravan erupted in a colossal bloom of dirt and rocks. Castiel gaped at the sight, Mage composure seriously rattled as rocks rained down from the sky and the thunderous sound of the explosion echoed through the pass. He barely had time to realize that the leading parts of the caravan had simply vanished in the explosion along with the portion of the guard force around them. The walls of the pass began to ring with repeated crashing sounds, far less massive than the first blast, but still loud enough that it was as if a thunderstorm had come to rest around the caravan. Castiel blinked again, staring at bright, sudden flashes of light, which were winking into existence among the rocks.
“That is also north of here.”
“Because we survived, and we have a chance to reach Ringhmon.”
That had meant something to him once. He had said it. To-? Anna. Only once. The night they had both been brought to the Mage Guild Hall with the other new acolytes. They had been punished for it. That had been twelve years ago.
“No. This is my first contract.”
“They depended on a Mage for protection?” He shouted. “What was the caravan master thinking! Who’s attacking us?” Under normal conditions, Castiel would have turned his back on him, adopting a Mage’s lack of interest in anyone and anything in this world. Under normal conditions, he would not speak with a Mechanic at all. But he was badly enough rattled that Castiel answered instead.
Castiel hesitated a moment longer as the Mechanic turned to go, then followed. After so many years of obedience to authority, it wasn’t easy to shake off the Mechanic’s commands, and his argument did seem reasonable. As soon as the Mechanic was sure Castiel was behind him, he started running off to one side, beckoning him to follow. Now that he was behind him, Castiel could see a large pack on his back. He wondered what it contained that could be so important the Mechanic didn’t abandon it so as to flee faster. Treasure of some kind? The Elders had always said that Mechanics were ruled by greed and deception.
They did not matter either, Castiel reminded himself. Those other people, like the desert about him, like the carriage in which he rode, were all illusions. Mere shadows created by his own mind. Only he was real. Ten years of harsh schooling in the Mage Guild had taught him that he was always alone. No matter how many shadows his mind imagined seeing. Alone.
“I did not do it because I cared about you. You are nothing.” Castiel said impassively.
His stomach tight with fear, Castiel focused on his spells again with a great effort. If he was to survive this, if he was to save anyone left alive in the caravan, he had to keep fighting. Calling up power, Castiel created fireball after fireball, placing them on the heights above the caravan. A series of explosions shattered ancient stone to cascade onto the attackers. His barrage finally caused the onslaught to falter. Clouds of dust rolled down, covering the area of the caravan and blocking Castiel’s view of the devastation around him, as well as the walls of the pass where the bandits were positioned. Castiel stopped, his breathing heavy, and sweat covering his body.
Castiel watched him, knowing that his own expression revealed no feeling at all. Merciless training had taught that skill to the young acolytes of the Mage Guild. But with the ability to hide all feeling came a corresponding proficiency at spotting emotion in others, even when they tried their best to hide it. On those few occasions when he had spoken with the Commander before this, the man had revealed beneath an impassive face and respectful tone of voice, the usual fear of Mages. Now within the Commander’s eyes and voice lurked a greater worry.
Pronunciation Guide:
“Either dead or fled. I believe most have died. I found no one alive until you.” He had spent years being told of the evil nature of Mechanics, and wondered for just a moment if Mechanics were behind this attack. But the fear in the eyes of this other boy was real. Castiel realized suddenly that the thunder of the Mechanic weapons had fallen off a great deal, and the thump of crossbow bolts had also subsided. He stared toward the front of the caravan. The bandits must be advancing. He looked around, not knowing what to do. His training had covered such circumstances, but to actually face them, to be desperately tired and surrounded by the dead while weapons he didn’t understand hurled death over long distances? It left him momentarily paralyzed.
“We?” The single word made no sense.
Startled by his touch on his robes, Castiel took a moment to think through what the Mechanic had said. His mind couldn’t concentrate, stuck on the sight of the bodies, fuzzy with fatigue and fear. He shook his head. “I do not know your words.”
The shouts from the caravan came again, this time clearly expressing disappointment. From the direction of the sound, Castiel guessed the voices were coming from the area around the wagon the Mechanic had occupied. “The bandits have discovered that you are missing.”
He felt a cold hollowness inside himself. He had never fought in earnest before today, never killed before today. The Common folk he had seen among the caravan now lay dead themselves, people who had depended on him for protection. All of them were shadows, so none of that should matter. But it did. He sensed something then, and turned to look back at the crest of the ridge.
“Yes there is? We can run!”
He stumbled through the slowly falling clouds of dust, past several more wagons- all abandoned. Or with their former occupants dead. Tired, and scared, Castiel could hear his Guild Elders lecturing him that a Mage must not show weakness, must not show human frailty. Castiel repeated the lessons to himself, trying to block out the thunder of the bandits' weapons, taking long, calming breaths while he attempted to deny any feelings of fear. But along with the fear he could not totally eliminate, one thought kept intruding: What other weapons were the bandits using? The thunderous weapons which had wiped out the guards were not crossbows; they were far deadlier.
“Not even when it’s trying to kill them? At least you’re consistent.” He rubbed one hand across his face, smearing sweat and dust into a dirty, wet mask. “You said that everyone else in the caravan died?”
Castiel caught up with him, hauling himself up behind the same outcropping of rock. He wished he were not so tired from the effort of casting his spells. “I neither like it nor dislike it; it is. But you are foolish to risk yourself for another. To worry. It does not matter.”
Castiel, baffled by his words and feeling fear bloom inside him again at the thought of death, fell back on his earliest training. “This world is not real. Dying is but the passing from one dream to another.”
Another easy answer, drilled into him countless times during his years as an acolyte. “Happiness is an illusion.”
“What are you doing here, Mage?” The Mechanic demanded, pointing the object in his hand at Castiel’s face. That thing he carried had no blade, nor any visible bolt like a crossbow. Instead, looking like an oddly shaped piece of metal with a hole in the end facing Castiel. But the way the Mechanic held it made clear it was a weapon of some kind. “I’ve seen you during the journey, so I know you’re not an attacker. Otherwise, you’d already be dead.”
When home Dianna spent the evening unpacking the remainder of her possessions, placing photographs on her shelf, and storing a few of her cooler, although undeniably more obscure and useless weapons around the room. She stood backward and ran her eyes over her room, more or less content with the prospect of calling this space her own. She grinned as an idea occurred to her and she grabbed at her old shotgun and wandered down to the shooting range. After hitting four bullets into the direct center of the target, she pulled the sheet off and walked back to her room, giggling to herself. She tacked the target sheet full of bullet holes upon her bedroom wall and drew a smiley face with giant crosses for eyes and its tongue sticking out on it. Pleased with herself, she wandered to Sam’s room, eager to display to her sister her new and genius decor.
"Ask Jody". Dean gathered his plate and Claire's empty bottle and wandered into the kitchen. He scraped the leftovers from his plate into the dog bowl in the corner and placed the empty plate into the sink before clearing up the many beer bottles he'd left lying around earlier. Deep in thoughts of self-loathing, he didn't notice that he was followed.
“Alright,” he cleared his throat, “let's find this bar and get some beer in me quick before I need you to do that again”.
After an hour he sat.
“Hey. It’s okay. I promise you I’m gonna hunt down the demon that did this, okay, Sammy? I promise.” She muttered into her sister's collarbone. Sam looked down at Deanna, her mouth shook and her eyes filled with darkness, the likes of which Deanna had never seen upon her little sister’s face before.
to stand up to my old man for me, and B, Would you give it a rest already?! I obviously didn't mean any of that!” Dean scrubbed at his mouth in frustration.
“Hey, man, I know you gave that whole speech about a pure hangover day today but I think I just caught us a case”. Dean sat up slowly, his head pounding.
“That's the ticket,” He confirmed. Penny shook his head, his eyes trained on the door. “I’m sorry, okay?” Penny scoffed.
fine with pretending you’re more than just some ignorant little parasite that has somehow managed to Gaslight Cas into believing he needs you around”. Penny turned to walk back toward room twenty-two but Dean shot his arm out, quickly stopping the angel by grabbing at his shoulder.
approach to the whole, God thing”. Dean remarked, glancing at Kelly and chuckling at his own wit, attracting the unwanted attention of Penny.
“Yes, well. Seeing as how you were the one to send me to that rotten place, I figure I’m deserving of some leeway regarding my manners”. Cas’s chest fell, another memory he had tried to forget. One that had plagued his dreams in the Empty. Evidently, his face displayed his regret and shame as Balthazar replied hastily. “Ohh. uhh, It’s okay, Cas. You’ve more than made up for it since. So none of that famous guilt complex that you’ve stolen from those two apes you’re so fond of”. Cas sighed as he recalled his misguided reason for ending his brother's life in the first place.
His parents smiled at him as the busboy led them over to their table. Dean stood, his chair scraped against the wooden decking.
"Not me." he pointed at Adam, "He's fresh out the box". Steve seemed to accept this, more or less.
“Come on, Dean. It’s time to go.” Crowly appeared, extending his hand toward Dean as the scene around them froze. On Crowley's finger, a white stone ring flashed under the moonlight.
"I heard you over at my house at four am, praying to Jack. I let it go because I... I figured we both needed some time to adjust, but seriously man, it's been months! You have to accept that this is what our lives are gonna be from now on". A tear rolled down Dean's cheek and he immediately swatted it away, gritting his teeth together. "I miss them too" Sam's voice was gentle again, filled with understanding... it did nothing to calm the rage in Dean. "Jack was family. Cas-". That was it. Dean grabbed the nearest thing he could find… a chair, and threw it at the wall, before falling to the ground, head in hands, sobbing in his own puke, the splintered remnants of the chair falling around him. He desperately wanted to tell Sam why he couldn't let go of the past. He wanted to explain the details of Castiel's death but nothing came out but deep strangled sobs and ragged gasping breaths. Sam stood there for a moment watching his brother unravel so unbelievably quickly and frowned. He hated that he'd let it get this bad. Sam and Dean were each other's responsibility. Sam had been so excited at the prospect of creating his own life that he had somehow convinced himself that Dean would eventually be okay... but seeing him like this, so completely broken, he'd realized how wrong he'd been; Dean wasn't going to get better, he was only getting worse.
“You really wanna joke about who’s fault Sammy was?”
away, but Rowena had assured him that there was no way to outrun his fate now. He assumed the flight would be canceled at the last minute and Sam would find a case in Ohio and head off without telling him and he couldn’t risk that, no matter how much he trusted Rowena’s handy work. He figured that even if he let Sam in on what was going down and locked both himself and Sam in the bunker, they’d somehow magically wake up in the barn in three days, anyway. At least this way he could go out doing some of the things he enjoys, and he was determined to spend the remainder of his time on earth living his life to the fullest.
“Hey, I get it.” Dean smiled at him. Sam cocked his head to the side as he narrowed his eyes.
“Ah, yeah,” Dean sniffed, still grinning to himself, “Not too shabby.” He managed to take a deep breath and pull his lips into a straight line, biting down on them as he drew his brows in and glanced up at Castiel, only for a millisecond; It was too much. “You?” Dean asked before springing up from the bed, swinging his legs over the side, and sitting facing the wall. He wondered if the pounding of his heart was audible as he rubbed the sleep from his eyes. Castiel sighed melodramatically from where he remained seated in the bed with two pillows pulled up behind his back to prop him up. Dean twisted himself around, worry and confusion plastered on his face. “What?” he asked, a touch of venom to his tone. Rather than reply Cas simply smiled, his brows raised as he smirked knowingly at the man in front of him. Dean shook his head and scoffed. “Okay...” he nodded and turned back toward the wall. Dean swallowed loudly, his throat feeling incredibly dry all of a sudden, his eyes darted around as he considered fleeing. He knew there was no real escape now though, nowhere he could run that would free him of his true feelings, not now. He had let the dam wall burst inside him and there was no building it back up. He shook his head again and sighed, then without any warning he threw himself backward, his back hitting the mattress and his head on Castiel’s thighs. “Alright!” he chuckled. “Fine. I’m sorry”. Cas grinned down at him, his eyes crinkling in the corners.
“You know what? You changed me too, Cas, but not for the better. Huh hoh, no! You made me weak!” He pulled his clenched fist up to his chest, his hand shook with rage and fear. A rogue tear broke free from his eye, immediately Dean swatted it away.
” Cas amended, “I have sat through enough romance movies to know that you should never change your appearance for love. It never really turns out all that well.” Cas seemed to think on this for a moment, “Except for in Grease but that film also makes the exact opposite point too... Perhaps it's the misogyny?” He questioned, “I suppose I shouldn’t take heed from a film that ends with a flying car with zero context”. Dean couldn’t help but smirk at this.
"Where would you like me to put this?" Charlie asked, cutting in before Sam could react. She was holding an elaborate pie that was clearly a creation Stevie made considering Charlie was about as bad a baker as they come.
, and please,
A whisky bottle gets whiplash.
“Oh, I’m from,” Dean snickered, “Kentucky?” He asked, laughing. Cas’s eyes closed as he burst into laughter, he leaned back clapping, his whole body shaking as his laughter boomed throughout the room. Dean watched Castiel with a proud smile on his face. It felt so good to make Cas laugh. Jack looked between the two and giggled.
. Castiel chastised himself again.
“Yeah... Kinda creepy... but it's impressive.” His voice was high, his enthusiasm evidently counterfeit. Castiel studied Dean.
After what felt like about an hour, driving aimlessly along back roads, Dean found his way into a town, buildings and houses rose out both windows, and traffic littered the streets. This new area was bursting with life: people walking dogs, going for runs, unpacking groceries from their cars, sitting out the front of cafes sipping at coffees, and standing in a queue, waiting at the atm. Dean searched for any familiar faces as he slowed the Impala to a generous crawl. He boarded on self-inflicted whiplash as peered through all windows and mirrors of the car, hoping to find anyone he recognized.
“That’s my mom and dad,” Jack explained to Dean, “and this is my other dad, and my other, other, dad.” He handed Castiel a fire truck and a rubber duck. “And this is me!” He grabbed a yellow beanie baby and plopped himself down, his diaper meeting the grass.
“--You said to me that the apocalypse was too huge for one man to shoulder,” He smiled, his eyes glazed over as he spoke, “I remember you apologizing to me for not being able to be the man either of our fathers wanted you to be.” Cas brought his eyes up to Dean’s.
We're finally out of Carry On territory and into my Big Brain Fix-It. I hope y'all like eventual happy endings.
all the time!” Cas said, imitating Dean, duck in his right hand again. “I just have this
am gonna kill you.” He balled his hand into a fist, holding all of his sudden rage, and hope, and anxiety in his hand. Rowena shook her head.
. Dean climbed out of his impala for the last time.
“Well, here ya go sugah.” Dean sing-songed, as he made Barbie!Kelly jump over to BeanieBaby!Jack, and put her hand on his.
Dean drove around heaven, after receiving the lowdown from Bobby, exploring oddly familiar roads with Sam on his mind. He wondered what Sam would be up to now that he no longer had his older brother around; now that he had no real reason to stick to the family business. Now that he had no family. Dean imagined Sam alone, having to be the one to take Dean’s lifeless, punctured corpse down from where it stuck, impaled before rigor mortise set in. He pictured Sam taking his body to his car, having to retrieve his keys from where they sat in his jacket pocket, and climbing into the front seat. Sam would have to call the police and he would need to release Dean’s body to them along with the bodies of the pile of vampires. Sam would have to wait around and let the police take his statement, and wait around again until they ensured it checked out against the two kids' stories. Dean imagined when Sam was finally able to claim his corpse back, that it would be hard, and heavy, and would have started to smell. He pictured Sam, by himself, having to source, and cut, and collect enough wood for a pyre for Dean. He imagined Sam standing alone watching his older brother's body in flames, inhaling the stench of his singed hair and burning flesh, with nobody but his dead brother's dog to keep him company.
“Yes. When creating this new world, Jack decided to add in a soul’s ability to control the element of time if needed. It seems to help when a soul has a hard time adjusting, they can skip forward to a time where they feel more comfortable. So, for you, that was the surprise party that Mary planned for you.” Dean raised his brow.
“Woah, Cas. No way. I can’t be there when you listen to it.” Dean laughed. Cas shook his head, baffled, but didn't reply as he placed the tape back into his trenchcoat. The gravel crunched under the Impala's wheels as they pulled out of the parking lot and onto the road. Dean smiled.
“Uh, I--” He swallowed. “It’s complicated.” He narrowed his eyes at the man across from him. Simon raised a brow in response, nodding feverishly.
“Sammy” she giggled, wrapping her fist on the back of the door. “You gotta come take a look at my poster.” She said, leaning in closer to the door. There was no reply from the other end. Deanna pushed the door open expecting to find her sister asleep in her bed but the room was completely empty; the way it had looked when they had first arrived the day before, all beyond one book sitting open upon the bed. “Sam?!” Deanna called louder over her shoulder as she walked toward the book, her heartbeat thumping hard against her chest. She saw the familiar leather cover framing the tattered paper pages and knew immediately what had happened. She didn't need to see how few pages sat on the right-hand side of the book to guess what entry it had been that Sam had just read.
“I--” Cas coughed hard, a completely non-angelic thing to do. His throat screamed at him, begging to be cleared as he attempted to hack it free. After a moment the choking subsided and he was able to breathe again. His brothers stared at him as he pulled his hand away, now covered in splatters of his grace. "I think, perhaps, I need to see Jack,” Castiel stated, as he slowly attempted to pull himself up off the bed, his body barely moving in response. He felt heavy and he suddenly gained tunnel vision for his efforts.
“Only if you’re done being mad at me”. Dean laughed a single frustrated chuckle.
"What are you doing here, D?" Sam asked, her voice brimmed full of frustration. Deanna spun around and grinned at the costumed man on the corner of the bed.
“Guh, no, man! That was fine. I said it was.
"Pork, really? That's your choice for Easter dinner?" Sam's condescending tone broke through Dean's lull. Sam's lips were somewhere between a smile and a disapproving purse.
Short one again. Sorry!
“Better that than if you--” Dean swallowed, catching himself and shook his head, “I don’t know why I’m getting worked up thinking about this, you and I…” his audible gulp seemed to echo through the bunker's corridors, “...We’re
less of a complete
“Cas,” Dean warned. Cas sighed in exacerbation then raised his cup to his lips, blowing tentatively at the steam before carefully drinking. “So, what time’s the kid usually get up?” Dean asked, changing the subject.
It didn’t take long for Dean to relax. He’d always been pretty good at adjusting to uncomfortable, or frankly, wack-ass circumstances, and he wondered why he ever thought this would be any different. He was among friends, after all, and it wasn’t like he couldn’t charm the pants off any strangers (literally, however, these days he’d laid that to rest). He now sat buzzed, beer in one hand, and clapping his spare against the bottle at a huge group of men holding a “Twinks from the nineteen-twenties” sign, while they made their way down the street. Cas sat at the back of the beer garden with Jack on his shoulders (so the toddler could see the commotion) and appeared to be in a deep conversation with Kelly and Penemue. While Dean was interested in knowing whatever the hell the group behind him was talking about, he truly was happy enough to just sit and watch the march, occasionally making small talk with Simon, Penemue’s husband.
.” Dean raised his voice. “Cas is, uh,” he shook his head, his eyes glanced around unfocused as his smile grew, “He’s just lookin’ out for me.” he swallowed, “All he ever does is look out for me.” He cleared his throat and trained his eyes back to his father. “Ya know, the thing is John, I think I’m still soft. Hell, I
“Yeah, great. Thanks for that”, Dean said sarcastically, shook his head, then squinted at Jack, directly in his eyes, “You even put a single one of those stickers on me, kid, and I’ll rat on you to your mom about who really finished off this puzzle she got you.”
, Dean noted. He slid down against the wall and stretched his legs out. He stared at the tiled wall opposite him. It seemed his head was suddenly completely empty.
“Is who out?” Crowly grinned at him.
“What? No,” Dean objected, looking offended. “I just, uh” he laughed humorlessly “Man, I have no idea what I’m gonna say to him when he wakes up”. Sam smiled knowingly and pat his brother on the leg before pulling himself up to his feet.
“No,” Sam replied, logically, almost seeming disappointed that Dean would even suggest such a ludicrous idea. Dean knew he was being stupid but at this point, he no longer cared. He honestly couldn’t explain it, even to himself, but the concept of not being able to ever use a single ninja star on a case was now filling him with such an intense and unstoppable distress that he childishly couldn’t help but to keep pushing.
“We've already been through this, Dean.” Cas’s smile had faded a little.
"Sure, yeah." Deanna nodded, "I kind of feel like I'm on a roll now though and I feel like if we don't do this now I might chicken out" she admitted, her voice high as if playing off her nervousness as a joke. Sam searched her sister's face for a brief pause and slapped her hands against her thighs.
“Hey, Samantha!” He beamed, his eyes flicking too and from Sam to Deanna.
He was awake again; he was in the Empty and somehow he had woken up, more importantly, he wasn’t the only one awake. He watched as angels and demons in both corporeal and spiritual forms attacked one another in a biblical massacre. Screams and wailing echoed through the nothingness surrounding them. A hand fell upon his shoulder.
“No, you do look cute, very cuddly. I just don’t think it's appropriate attire for a celebration. It seems to say “I’ve given up” more than anything”. Dean raised his brows. A jolt of anxiety surged in his stomach.
, Sammy.” She bit, eyeing her sister. Sam’s face fell and Deanna licked her lips and closed her eyes tightly, sighing. “We were closing in on it.” She glanced back up at her sister, trying to calm herself down “We heard rumors of a Demon, one with yellow eyes. The--” Deanna cleared her throat, “The same M.O. as with mom.” She shook her head, “But this demon, Sam, it’s not like anything we’ve ever faced before. They were everywhere. I--” Deanna stared at the drink in front of her for a moment “It had a whole army of shadow demons. Ripped him apart like it was
possible.” Cas stated calmly before bonking his forehead against Dean’s shoulder, “Would you prefer it?” his smile grew.
“What about you?” Dean nodded solemnly. He realized he had taken his speech a little too far; had made it a little too Sam centric, and that his younger brother had started to see through it.
Dean had sobered up but his appetite had vanished. He stared at the food on his plate and moved it around a little with his fork. The tables in the library had all been pushed together and covered in plates. Everyone sat around filling their stomachs and filling each other in on momentous events they'd each missed out on. Dean sat in silence down on the corner of the table, closest to the entrance. He could feel Sam's eyes on him every now and again and tried to ignore it but he could feel himself shift under the weight of it... He was already ashamed he'd let himself get that messy earlier in front of his little brother and just knowing that when everyone left the bunker for the night he'd have a pile of vomit filled clothes and a puddle of puke to clean didn't make him feel any better.
“Since about seven o'clock. Kelly headed home pretty much straight after that. Jack made you this in art therapy” Penemue replied, handing Cas a piece of paper. He smiled down and the image, curiosity caused Dean to groan slightly as he rose out of his chair again, and walked over to Cas, peering over his shoulder at the image. The drawing was done in crayon of a small brickwork house, crass in detail but rich in talent. The building was shaped like a rectangle with a triangle for a roof, it was colored in red and orange bricks, with a yellow door and blue windows. The house sat atop a green hill, and spilling out of each of the two windows, and into the sky, were two large black outlines of, many-eyed, many winged monsters that smiled at each other.
John smiled hesitantly, before enveloping Dean in his arms giving him two quick taps on the back. Dean couldn’t bring himself to speak. He wasn’t quite sure exactly what he could say.
“Your point?” he squinted.
“How about I get you the usual instead,” he said winking. He turned back to Deanna and shook his head again, smiling as he twisted on his heel and snaked his way back through the crowded dance floor toward the bar.
says because you know you it's not possible to read in dreams.” Cas lifted the tape, turning it towards him, a smile breaking out across his face.
"Right, uh, yeah. Sorry about that. Things got a little weird so I figured I'd go with the ol' Irish goodbye, ya know?" There was a rustling sound on the other end of the line that Dean could only assume was the sound of Charlie nodding.
"Just tell them or I will" Stevie stated, from the other end of the table. The pork Dean was so eager to devour earlier looked like something he would feed to Miracle, he decided, as he shoveled the mountain of potato on his plate on top of it to hide it from his eye line.
“I meant-- stop-- singing” he spluttered, setting his jaw and looking hard into his older brother's eyes. Lucifer closed his eyes and nodded slowly, his mouth formed a counterfeit frown.
I'm gonna try update this bad boy a bit more frequently so look out for some sporadic chapter drops. :)
“What about you? Are you taking the proverbial elevator back down to the metaphorical lobby?” Dean smirked.
“Yeah, a coffee sounds good.” Castiel agreed. He rose carefully from where he sat and placed his shirt, pants, and socks on, and the two of them walked from Dean's room into the kitchen.
Dean gave in. He let go of this world and relaxed into his eternal rest.
“As a heart attack. Why, do you have somewhere you need to be in the morning?” Dean grinned at his brother before motioning his head toward Sam's shot, gesturing for him to pick it up. Sam sighed.
“Should I put this on?” Cas asked, flashing the new cassette tape from his pocket.
“You in some sort of hurry to get away from us, son?” John’s voice was low, snapping Dean back to the present.
“John--” Mary tried again. John sighed and turned to Mary.
“I’m guessing that’s a good thing?” Deanna asked, following Sam’s line of sight out into the sea of unrecognizable bodies.
“Sam--”
“Here you go, man,” she said, handing him the empty glass. He looked at it confused for a moment.
ready, he noted, and followed them out of the door into the hallway, through the crowd of seated friends and family, before finally taking his place by his brother at the end of the aisle, in front of the altar.
“What is it, Dean?” Mary’s voice was gentle. Dean read the letter, ignoring Mary's question.
“You’re the one that chose that outfit…” Sam mumbled. Deanna flipped her head back and tied her hair in a ponytail on the top of her head. She turned to her sister, her arms spread. “Better or worse?” Sam shrugged.
“Exactly. We’re looking after it.” Gabriel agreed. Cas narrowed his eyes.
a reason forcing me to stick around. Turns out, I kind of wanted to live after all.” He chuckled, and with a shake of his head, he grabbed an eggplant in one hand and the knife in the other and started chopping.
“--And what? You’ll cry if you want to? It's actually
“My apologies, Dean, Mary, but I’m afraid I can’t exchange pleasantries with you, John”. He stated, and turned away, walking through the remaining clumps of people and out the door. Dean stopped breathing.
you and I finally head on home.” He laughed. Castiel lowered his brow and cocked his head to the side in confusion as he studied Dean's face, then his head slowly righted itself, and his face grew into an exacerbated smile as he realized, Dean had done it; he'd already figured out his one way of getting back home.
“Quit playing around, Crowly!
Dean recalls his dream visit from Jack.
“Shhh!” A voice rang out from behind the bar area causing Dean to stop in his tracks, his head snapping toward the sound. Dean bellowed at the faceless intruder.
“This is--”
with you.” He continued, shaking his head some more, his grey curls bouncing around his shoulders. “And I know you are aware otherwise you wouldn’t have chosen such specific words in your thinly masked attack toward me yesterday.
"Castiel, you're looking well," Michael replied. Dean scoffed out a laugh. The four of them turned to look at Dean who lowered his head in embarrassment.
“Dean--”
“Took you a hell of a lot less time than it took Ketch. Look, Mick, in our-- in
“I need your help”. His voice came out shaky and clipped. Rowena walked slowly toward him, her eyes flitting across his face.
“Nothing.” Dean sighed, “Not anymore,” he slammed the door behind him.
"You gonna invite me in to see this place or am I gonna have to come back after dark with a flashlight and break in."
“You can’t be serious?” His brows twitched, fluctuating between amusement and concern as he saw the tray, four shots and two pots of beer between them.
Dean opened the back door and bowed grandly, bottles clinking, gesturing for Castiel to get in. He looked curiously back at Dean before climbing inside. Dean got into the driver's seat of the car and lay his back against the door, placing a bottle down on the floor by the pedals. He raised his legs in front of him, his feet on the passenger seat. His vision spun. Castiel, after a moment of uncertainty, copied Dean's position, facing toward him from the back seat.
Mary, the sneak that she was, had plied her son with copious drinks after John had dramatically vacated the premises, and via snarky comments and sarcastic jokes, the two had managed to have what closely resembled a deep and meaningful conversation. She let Dean know that she would be there for him and that she was proud of the man he had become. Dean, in response, mentioned that if he had made things between her and John so unbearable, Ketch always seemed to be sniffing around for her. Mary replied with a playful swipe to his head.
“The council?” Dean questioned, his brows raised. Castiel nodded.
“Are you gonna put on some music or should I”. he asked after a while, changing the subject. Sam sighed, and even with his eyes closed, Dean could tell that his brother had given up on trying to push him to talk.
"I would like that very much" Cas grinned and if Dean didn't know any better (which he did) he could have sworn the angel was enjoying watching how easily he could turn him into a flustered bumbling idiot.
“Crowley!--”
“Penemue, but you can call me Penny.” The man replied, taking Dean's hand in his and shaking it. “So, you’re him, huh?” Penny asked. Dean looked to Cas awkwardly before plonking himself back down in his seat. Castiel stared down at the floor by his feet.
“Did you have a nightmare?” Cas asked as if it wasn’t blatantly obvious. Dean nodded, a smile wavering on his mouth that didn’t reach his eyes. Cas ran his hands up and down Dean’s arms, then clasped Dean’s hand in his own, and with his spare, he continued to rub Dean from his arm to his back, tracing circles over and over. Dean let his eyes flutter closed, focusing on the feeling as it almost instantly calmed him, easing what little confusion and fear remained leftover from Dean’s dream. "Sorry. I heard you calling me but I wasn't sure if you still wanted--"
“Azrael, How are you this morning?” Castiel asked as Azrael handed a much cleaner and much neater piece of paper to Dean than the one he had received from Sam just the night before. Dean didn’t hear their reply as the voices in the room faded away while he concentrated on Sam’s handwriting.
“I-- No, Jack, It’s not safe. You have to leave, now! You shouldn't be here--” Jack lifted his hand in a fist and opened it up presenting a white stoned ring to Castiel.
that?” she repeated. Dean's eyes wandered from his arm to Charlie's face, over to the corner where the Angels stood. Cas was facing him now, his brows furrowed and his head tilted, his eyes bore into Dean’s. Dean lowered his sleeve and moved his head back to face Charlie, before ripping his eyes from Cas’s. He swallowed. Charlie followed to where his gaze had been, her eyes widened. “I know what that is! It’s in those Carver Edland books!” Dean rolled his eyes. He didn’t know if anyone had updated Charlie on all of the Chuck crap but he couldn’t get into all of that right now, he couldn’t handle it. He shook his head and rubbed at the scar on his shoulder.
He thought of Castiel walking into the water, disappearing as his body disintegrated, leaving behind nothing but his trenchcoat. Taking it from car to car, motel to motel just in case Cas returned.
“Cas?” Castiel’s head snapped toward the sound, his eyes brimming with tears.
“Jackson Browne, Late For The Sky album”. Dean shook his head, irked, and fumbled around in the glovebox for the cassette. The Grand Illusion by Styx being the first tape he was able to find.
“What, you need something else?” he asked. Castiel’s chest squeezed again at the sight of him, the youthful look to Dean this new memory jolted Castiel free of his memory’s form and left him down on all fours, gasping for air.
“It’s like five pages in or so, he mentions having a storage container back in Lawrence full of burned shit from the house.” D raised her head, trying to see the book in her peripheral. Sam swallowed, slamming the journal closed. Deanna glanced at her younger sister, confused.
, Dean pleaded internally. Sam, still in a daze, tried to physically remove Dean from whatever he was impaled on as if Dean were simply over exaggerating.
Take a shot every time Dean gazes at Castiel.
“Maybe you just didn’t want to see it? Or, er... you weren’t ready to... ” Dean stared at the bottle in between the two of them, biting his lip. Sam studied his older brother. The two of them sat in silence for a moment, the quiet containing the ultimate unbreached subject. “So... you gonna avoid him now after spending months trying to get him back?” Sam questioned.
”, he gestured between them both, “Are gonna get them somewhere safe”.
“You can. You always do anyway”. Dean peaked up at his younger brother. Sam looked heavy-hearted and the sight made Dean’s stomach twist. He wanted to open up to his brother but he knew that it was way too risky. Sam had a history of being the only one who would be able to talk Dean out of sacrificing himself. He’d probably break into a rousing, yet overemotional, inspirational speech about finding some kind of third alternative; some hope for a future where they both could live, and Dean knew that the concept of that was far too inviting, too tempting. He considered, for a brief moment, sharing the exact details of Cas’s death; the other equally terrible grievance that was currently haunting Dean. However, instead, he replied.
“D, I’m coming with you whether you like it or not.” Deanna considered throwing a punch then and there; hitting her sister right in the sweet spot and knocking her out for her own safety, then, however, she imagined her sister passed out lying in the muddy concrete in the cold because there was no way in hell that Dianna would be able to move her back to the warmth of the Impala. She sighed.
“I missed you too, kid! You do all this? Your decorating skills are
Dean’s heart sank. He knew this was never going to go down great but he had never expected Cas to be so cold. He had expected some kind of “
Castiel's blue eyes bore into him. The angel snapped his index and middle fingers up to Dean’s head. Dean felt the familiar ecstasy of Cas’s grace flowing through him. His breathing slowed, his muscles relaxed. He exhaled tremendously, closing his eyes and slumping slightly against the wall.
“Yeah, we’ve done Zeppelin, so Hendrix is the next natural option.” Dean smiled, his eyes on Cas as he leaned over and picked up the beer again. Cas’s expression turned tender as he smiled at Dean. Dean cleared his throat, trying to ignore the feeling in this stomach. “So, uhh, now that's all sorted. What’s with the booze in heaven? How are we getting drunk in the Matrix?” Cas frowned.
“Uh-Uh. No, Dean Winchester Pity Party, please. We are here to celebrate and if you’re gonna be a downer you should just leave”. Dean was taken aback.
“You look
Dean placed the straw aside and took a gulp of the sugary liquid. He cringed at the sweetness as he placed the drink back down upon the bar.
to be this version of himself, right? Nobody did this to him? Why'd he just up and choose to Benjamin Button himself; become a freakin' infant Mother Teresa?" He sighed and turned toward Cas, trying to ignore the pit still very annoyingly present in his stomach, "He didn't like the shit I said, so he just decided to forget all about it? I ain't buyin' it." Castiel shook his head and opened his mouth to reply but Dean cut him off "--And don't think I did notice you didn't answer me about the Council.” Castiel grinned, bewildered and Dean frowned, squinting at his resolve in confusion.
“The M.O.C. Gasp. Show me”. Charlie reached her hands across the table pulling at the sleeve on Dean’s red button-up shirt.
(See the end of the chapter for
Before long, Dean arrived at his location. He'd been there five months ago but it felt like those months had simply been an endless dream. He half expected to see Chuck still lying there, pathetically writhing in the dust, calling out for their mercy, or to find his rotting corpse curled into a ball and shriveled up like a worm on the sidewalk. Yet, when he pulled into the area where the trees broke, there was not a person in sight. The cyprus swayed in the wind and the water glistened in the lake beside the clearing. Dean couldn't help but feel like he was being watched as he pulled the ingredients out of the trunk and scanned around again for anything at all out of the ordinary. He almost smiled as he considered that maybe this was all a big set up. It'd be just his luck if, on the day that he finally compiled everything he needed for the spell, a demon just sprang up out of nowhere and took him out. He tried to ignore the feeling of eyes on him as he worked and chalked it up to nerves. He set down the large bowl and poured in the blood-stained dirt he'd received the day before. The incantation was the hardest part to find. After weeks of tearing through the bunker, Dean had found he needed to rifle for the forgotten scrap of paper at the bottom of Sam's old duffle while he was asleep the morning Dean had slept over on his brother's couch. He added the vial of angel grace and a few other bits and pieces he remembered from last time before saying the words, taking in one last breath, and lighting the bowl on fire. A stream of excruciatingly bright blue light shot up from the bowl and into the sky. Dean shielded his eyes but as soon as the light started it had disappeared again.
“Uh,” Sam raised her head and bobbed herself around trying to glimpse back down the staircase. She turned to her sister. “The bouncer’s not even here?” She laughed. Deanna's stomach sank as the hairs on the back of her neck stood up. “I guess we didn’t even have to pay after all”. Sam commented, pushing down on the crash bar and opening up the heavy metal door.
“I’ve been there... Look, I know this can be pretty overwhelming… but there’s no actual rule saying you need to figure any of it out… ever… and if anyone says otherwise they’re not worth listening to.” He grinned at Dean, “I’m just glad you’re here, I know it means a lot to them.” He gestured discreetly with his eyes to where Penny and Cas sat at the table behind them. Dean nodded.
“Well, what do you want me to say, Dean”. Sam was puzzled.
“Cas, not now!” Dean warned, then his face softened. A silver car backed out in front of him and he flicked the indicator up. “Yes!” He pulled the Impala into the parking space and turned the key, exhaling hugely, he twisted toward Cas, watching the angel as he unbuckled his seatbelt. “I stand by this morning's decision.” He licked at his lips and pumped his brows at Cas who turned to him with a grin. Castiel was dressed in his normal get-up minus the coat and jacket, his sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, his tie was missing, and a few of his top buttons were undone. It wasn’t like Dean hadn’t seen him completely naked... but for some sick reason the relaxed, slight show of skin had been driving him mad all morning and he knew that if they didn’t clear the pipes, so to speak, he’d be a distracted mess all day. Now that roughly an hour had passed from their trip up to “the big city”, as it was so aptly named, Dean was already starting to look at Castiel with a considerable amount of hunger again. Cas shook his head.
“No offense or anything,” Mario began as she stood up, “but no way are we gonna tell you that. You could be, like, a murder or something.” Deanna rolled her eyes and sighed, pulling her wallet from where it sat tucked inside the jacket pocket. She slotted her nail into the card section, peaking at them carefully, and pulled out her real Driver’s license.
“It’s whatever.” She said, running her hand over her eyes. “Sorry,” she mumbled. Deanna sighed.
“Lead the way.” She said gesturing in front of them with the blue beverage.
!” Cas exclaimed, “Not for me-- I would never...” he trailed off at the sight of Dean relaxing a little at this.
? he decided.
“I’m still convinced that douche was packing a hex bag or something. There’s no way anyone could down that many shots and then still hand me my own ass.” A laugh exploded from Sam as he turned to his brother again.
have it figured out.” Dean admitted, “It’s just that nobody else really gets it… but thanks.” He sighed.
Dean knew this was Chuck’s doing, a nice little breadcrumb path that was supposed to lead to Sam being slaughtered in a barn somewhere. Too bad Jack had caught on and Dean had thrown a spanner at that plan. Dean sipped at his coffee tentatively, while he considered his options for the rest of the day.
“I know you’re there!” His eyes searched for further movement, “Show yourself! I’ve got-- uh… a gun!” Dean rolled his eyes at himself.
“What, you don’t like it? Sam and I used to rock a hoodie all the time, back in the day. I forgot how comfortable they are.” Dean pulled at the soft grey fabric on his torso. Cas smirked.
“I was gonna visit dad’s storage unit. See if I can figure out if he knows-- uh,
"Duh, no hangovers in heaven, dude. I've just been out for breakfast with my mom at some waffle house just outside of the eighteen hundred's city. Have you driven out there? It's crazy, there are all these people in, like, legit horse and carts. It's so rad."
Dean tried not to think of when his eyes were black. The filthy shit he did while traveling around with Crowley, the things he has to remind himself don't count because he was a demon.
“So a jug of house beer?” the waitress confirmed.
“So what? You just come to gloat or you tryna work out some sorta deal? Because I thought that was more your old gig.”
“Woah, there horsey. I wouldn't do that if I were you.” Gabriel began, rushing to Cas’s side and placing a hand upon his shoulder. “You just about got ripped a deluge of new ones back in the Empty.”
“I--” Sam shook her head again then more spew trickled out of her mouth and onto the floor between them, splashing up on Deanna’s legs and causing her own stomach to pulse. She gagged and coughed before regaining her composure and shaking her sister's shoulders.
“Dean, I--” Castiel frowned to himself before he continued, “I don’t believe your father should be in heaven,” Dean's eyes widened. “Yes, he saved many lives... but that was simply a byproduct of his incessant need for revenge and nothing more. The way you and Sam were raised…” Cas trailed off, shaking his head as he stared at Dean, daring him to object.
“Pie?”
“Cause I was goddamn
D turned up the radio, blaring "Good Times Bad Times" by Led Zeppelin. Sam jumped in her seat, inhaling deeply as she whipped her head around wildly. Deanna chuckled at her, proud of herself.
“Congratulations! Sticking to it this time?” She asked with a hug. Dean must not have responded to her dig with her desired amount of amusement. “Oh, come on, old man, heaven’s not so bad. None of that here”, she said gesturing at his remorseful face. Dean’s stomach dropped as he looked her over, he still couldn’t help but feel responsible for her death. A weight on his conscience that he thought he had dropped long ago.
“Come on, love, we better give Dean some space,” Bobby explained, taking Karen’s hand in his and heading over to a table.
“Adam”. Dean concluded, his throat tightened.
“Oh, cute. So you’ve met?” Dean scoffed.
had passed so… I'm happy to stay at base camp for as long as I can".
Long lush green grass replaced the whole flooring throughout the room, bright wildflowers peppered the area. In the corner of the room, where the concrete wall met the bricks, a large apple tree bloomed. The tree had four brilliant red apples the size of basketballs hanging from the front branches, each of the apples printed with a letter to spell out the name “Jack”. The ceiling of the room was missing completely, or at least it would seem that way had they not been in an underground bunker and had Dean not been able to recall the absence of a gaping hole in the earth when he arrived last night. Clouds scattered the light blue sky in unnatural shapes. A cloud the shape of a bunny, hopped by as Dean made his way wide-eyed, toward where Castiel stood, Jack, now a toddler, balanced upon his hip. In the chair in the far corner sat another angel, a woman with dark hair, eyes, and skin, her hair pulled back out of her face, a book upon her lap and a pen in her hand, she regarded Dean carefully. A tank sat on the table beside her, inside it a snake slept under the warm light. Jack turned in Cas’s arms and beamed a smile at Dean.
"Oh, man, you have no idea. I'll start writing a list, beginning with what happened when Sammy got drunk for the first time when she was twelve, and why she's so deathly afraid of clowns." Deanna smirked at her younger sister and wiggled her brows. Jesse's eyes widened as he mouthed the word twelve silently at his girlfriend. She shook her head in reply, placed her hands upon the man's shoulders, and turned him, before moving her hands to rest upon his upper back, pushing him forward, lightly.
kind of just a heavenly upgrade." Dean pulled his mouth down at the edges, raised his brows, and nodded, satisfied.
As promised, Dean made his way back to the kitchen where he washed up from breakfast, feeding Miracle the scraps he couldn’t bring himself to stomach earlier. He was starting to relax a little. At this rate, he wouldn’t even notice when the doomed hour rolled by. He figured he just had to keep busy, and he had the perfect job for it. It had been months since all of the crap in the back of the impala got a deep clean, and with Chuck out of the way and nobody's life being in any imminent danger, now was the perfect time to drag out some elbow grease and give all of their guns and knives a nice spit-shine. And so, Dean got to work, bringing all of the weapons from the boot of the impala, into the weapons room.
"Jack, Hey!" Sam greeted him by gripping his arm.
“Maybe we can save that until we can all go there together, Dean can remeet the ol’ man”.
“Uh… Probably?” Dean squinted at him.
“I’m so, so sorry!” He exclaimed between cartoonishly wet-sounding kisses.
“I mean, it’s clearly warded out the ass so I think it should be fine... but I’m definitely gonna cleanse the place if that's okay with you? I’ve got some homemade smoke sticks and palo santo on my bag if you wanna help”. Deanna nodded, her eyes still wide with awe.
death”. Dean scoffed and shook his head. Dean’s impossibly high-pitched Kelly Barbie squeaked.
In what appeared to be the precise center of the rooftop was a large, bloody pile of disassembled human body parts rearranged to create some kind of monstrous figure, like a many-limbed, grotesque effigy. Severed arms, their fingers all broken into bizarre angles, rose like the back of an unearthly throne, presented uniformly atop a seat of various blood-coated torsos that rested upon a base made of many intersecting legs. Frightened, staring, dismembered heads were placed with care in a neat row facing forward, between their feet. Atop the throne, in the very center of the mutilated statue, sat Jesse. He was more or less in one piece and yet completely nude, and his body had been crudely carved into with a sharp object. His eyes had been poorly removed and the corners of his mouth were cut into a haunting smile, an unmistakable message was carved onto his torso. After the initial shock, Deanna fumbled for her sister as hastily as she could manage and turned her away from the horrific scene but she knew it was already much too late to save her from the visual, not to mention the foul stench.
“Well, you said that you meant it.” Castiel reminded him.
“What’s wrong?” Cas questioned, frustratingly immediately. Dean sniffed and placed his drink down in front of him, dragging his eyes up to meet the angel's blue ones.
“Uh, yes. I did. I actually dreamt last night… not a nightmare, a dream... for the first time in…” Cas glanced upwards in thought “...since I was last a human.” Dean smiled.
"Tell you what." He leaned in and spoke into Claire's ear, "You tell Sam that I said you can have the bunker if I get his McMansion okay?" He pat her on the top of her long blonde hair and turned to leave.
"Yeah. You finger-snapped Keven's soul up to the pearly gates." Dean nodded.
Dean’s lungs retracted.
“Trust me. We do.” Dean croaked. Castiel put his head in his hands, rubbing at his eyes.
“I’m betting a single splinter would take you out at this point. Kill you for good this time, and as much as I love to find out where you’ll be sent now that there’s no more Empty, I personally wouldn’t recommend being that particular guinea pig”, Balthazar agreed.
"Trying not to wake you up. The hell are you doing awake at this time? Shouldn't you be resting, trying to heal?" Dean asked, trudging himself down the remainder of the steps.
The rest of the day passed relatively smoothly. Sam and Dean visited the crime scene and confirmed that they were probably dealing with some vamps. The tongue thing was a new one but Dean couldn’t figure how it could possibly be something relevant to his own upcoming demise so he decided to label it under
"Oh, who-- Um. Thing is-- like, you uh-- you--" Charlie's voice cut through Dean’s attempt at some kind of sentence.
A sink gets squeezed, Dean gets his step count up.
A hand seized his shoulder and ripped him to his feet. He blinked at the form in front of him, his eyes still trying to adjust to the brightness. “Gotta say, it was a bit touch-and-go for a minute there.” He admitted, coughing into his elbow.
“I mean... kind of?” Dean sat up, “We could have had years of this, while we were both on earth.
Dean was in the kitchen, wearing a grey oversized hooded sweater underneath his apron, rewarding himself with what was roughly a shot of Johnny Walker Blue, straight from the bottle, each time he finished chopping up a random vegetable to throw into the pot of (what he hoped would eventually turn out to be a) semi-healthy pasta sauce.
"Yeah, almost... But your mom, huh? That's awesome! When do I get to meet old lady Middleton?" Dean picked at a loose thread on the hem of his shirt.
“I just wish I could have been there.” he sighed. “You're my brother, Dean, it would have been nice to be there to celebrate with you,” Dean smirked.
“I gotta shower anyway, I smell like… well, I smell like I just got back from running five miles.”
, apparently.” he shrugged again. Dean shrugged back at him, raising his brows and pulling down the corners of his lips. “You know Crowley reaped me?!” Keven stated, spilling his drink as he swung himself around on his barstool so his whole body now faced Dean. Dean nodded.
“Just don’t--” Dean closed his eyes for a moment, before looking up at his brother again, albeit sternly this time. “Don’t take it for granted”. Dean trained his eyes to his glass, inhaled, and threw his drink back.
Dean paused. He stared at the ground unable to move. The only thought he could muster was. No. No, he couldn't move because if he moved then he would have to leave. No, he couldn't leave. No, he wasn't going to go back to the bunker alone where there are too many ghosts. No, he wasn't going to throw another tantrum. He gritted his teeth and set his jaw. No. and sat back down. He considered that his dad, the great John Winchester would remark that even this was a tantrum in itself but Dean chose to ignore his dad's ever-present voice in his head. In fact, the longer Dean sat there clutching the objects tightly in his arms, the longer his anger redirected from himself onto his father. He'd always known the man had a strange effect on the boys but even now sitting there seething in the middle of nowhere waiting for God, he was reminded of times he'd waited around for his dad. His dad who he idolized the majority of his life despite the fact that in his father's eyes he was seen as little more than a mouthy soldier. His dad, who claimed to value family so damn much that he uprooted their whole lives for their mom's vengeance, and yet somehow was able to spawn a random brother that he and Sam never got the chance to really get to know. His damned holier-than-thou dad who dictated every inch of his life growing up that Dean never even considered he was worthy of-
'tame'." Dean beamed leaning into his brother trying to position himself to see Cas' face in the mirror, as Cas simply shook his head. He turned up the radio as Peace Train by Cat Stevens began to play.
Dean goes gently into that good night.
"What do you mean?" Charlie asked, her voice seemed genuinely uncertain. Dean suddenly found it hard to breathe. A voice in his head screamed at him to hang up the phone and throw it at the wall. He imagined how satisfying it would be to watch the glass rain down across the floor as physical evidence he’d evaded a moment of vulnerability.
“Sit here doing nothing?” Cas suggested, sarcastically.
“Yeah, man. You say ‘Hi’ from me”. Dean encouraged, giving Sam a slap on his back as his younger brother waded his way through the bar toward the exit.
“Yeah, well, you should.”
The gravel crunched under Dean's boots as he walked from the Impala toward the Roadhouse. The old, wooden building looked dark and empty as he approached.
“My residence?”
“What would be the point? I go back down there, I’m only gonna end up back here again, eventually.” Dean’s last song began.
important.
“Well, what about, er,” He took a moment to remember “Anna. The two of you, uhh... had relations...” He noted. Dean looked at him as if he was speaking a foreign language.
“You’re mad at me.” Castiel declared it as a statement.
“And your front.”
"Well, this guy", Dean pointed to Steve Phoenix, "just annihilated a cover of, uh--" Dean furrowed his brow and hit his hand against Cas's chest.
Dean Winchester and decided that it wasn't his cup of joe. Dean put his head in his hands and rubbed at his eyes.
“Don’t worry about it”. Dean mumbled into Cas’s neck. After a short moment of waiting in vain for Cas’s arm to find its way back to him like a fleshy seatbelt, Dean pulled his arm back and propped himself up on his elbows, squinting up at Cas. Castiel stared at Dean, eyes flicking across his face, searching him. “Morning, sunshine”. Dean said, clearing his throat. Castiel, his hair sticking up at all angles, adjusted the pillow behind him slightly and pulled himself up into a sitting position.
“Uh,” Dean shrugged. He didn’t want to lie.
“You don't have to come”. She stated, looking down at Deanna, her eyebrows high. Deanna pulled herself out of the chair and balanced John’s jacket on her arm as she inhaled dramatically and lifted the last of their drinks.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alright, cowboy. No need to get cocky.” Grinning, Cas put on the best imitation of his own confused face.
“You made it!” She shouted back, releasing Dean, then throwing her arms around Castiel, “I thought you guys weren't coming for a minute there!” Castiel huffed out a laugh and gave Dean a sideways glance.
“Sam--”, Dean repeated in a mirroring tone. Dean threw up his best smirk. “I’m fine... As fine as I can be. Can you just lay off and let me--” he scratched at his face, “Let me be fine”.
The look of denial was still on Sam's face.
"Bobby! Heyyy!" Dean bellowed as he strode through the kitchen to greet the gruff old man in a hug. He gave him two hard taps on the back as Bobby slid his hand down by Dean's jacket pocket.
Dean's mind raced as his breathing increased. He felt somewhat calm still, despite the possible danger he was now in, despite the very real possibility that he was about to be tortured for all of eternity. He tried to feel the weight of his fear but it seemed lighter, like it was hidden from him, lifted from him, unwillingly. The air around Dean smelled clean, open. Birds sang from a nearby tree.
"You ready for happily ever after?" He asked, pointing at his brother, before turning to Castiel and lazily bumping his shoulder against the former angel’s. Cas chuckled as his hand reached Dean’s and the two strode from the bathroom. Dean waited, holding Cas’ hand in one hand and the other held the bathroom door open for his younger brother. Sam's smile grew as he watched the two of them. He
“Fuck” she mumbled to herself as she wrapped her arms around her. Sam climbed out of the opposite side and the two met each other beside the car, staring hesitantly at the rusty metal door. Dianna inhaled, pulling herself together, and marched toward the entrance, she inserted the key and placed her hand upon the handle. She turned toward Sam who stood beside her. “You wait here. No use both of us being killed.” she shrugged. Sam scoffed.
“Right... because the super-secret hidden bunker needs to be
“Why don’t you sit down and start at the beginning”. Dean sighed and rubbed his hand over his mouth before nodding and walking over to his place by the wall. He slumped back down to the concrete and pulled his legs up against his chest. Rowena stood across from him, refusing to sit. Dean absentmindedly rubbed his left shoulder, and began telling Rowena the events of the last week or so. He explained all about how Billy had been gunning for the God gig and how Cas had paid the ultimate price to keep them safe, to give them their best chance. He decided not to share the exact details of how that went down, however. Nobody needed to know that but him. He spoke of how he, Sam, and Jack had defeated Chuck, and how Jack had taken his place at the top of the food chain. His voice started to shake as he shared the details of his dream with Jack from that night. He noticed that Rowena’s worried look turned to one of pity as he spoke of his dream. The look made his mouth dry. After a long pause, Rowena crouched down beside him, placing her hand on his shoulder.
“Let him go? Hmm… I could do that… Is that truly what you want, though? You know the way he feels about you, yes? The way that he, even now, is screaming inside me.” Alistair tapped John's finger to his temple before continuing, “He's
“Wait,” Dean murmured. He grabbed at Cas’s left hand that still gripped at his shoulder, “Wait a minute-- You--” He flung Cas’s hand off of him. “You have no Grace. What the hell are you doing!?” He pushed at Cas's chest lightly.
"Damn, right!" Dean agreed, his smile slowly faded and his eyes glazed over as his mind raced through a montage of the many times he'd died, imagining himself replaced by Kaia or Claire or any of the newer generation of hunters. He just hoped that he had taught them all he could.
“Jimi Hendrix?”
if you cared about him as much as you think you did, we wouldn’t be here, right now.” D spat. Sam flinched at her older sister's words, her face full of hurt. Deanna's heart sank.
“Good morning!” Jack beamed at them both.
"If you can hear me Cas, I'm sorry." he sighed, "I mean it. I really am, but, I also meant every damn word of what I just said." He sniffed and swallowed, allowing a moment to himself, attempting to choose if he should continue, elaborate, but decided against it. Instead, he turned the keys in the ignition and the impala purred to life. He continued to retrace the backroads of heaven, hoping to find his way back to Bobby; back to family; back to comfort.
“Damnit, Crowley! You scared the shit outta me.” He growled. Crowly smiled smugly at him from the stool to his right, dressed in his regular expensive black suit with the stark addition of the new bling he was rocking on his index finger.
"This is awkward. Should I leave?" Steve Phoenix asked, reminding the other four of his presence.
“Did you… read this?” her voice was low. Deanna swallowed.
“Would you slow down a little, Sam?” she called out into the street while Sam waited at a pedestrian crossing, half a block away. A couple dressed as linen ghosts, walking in the opposite direction swiveled their heads around as they passed, in an attempt to see who Deanna was yelling at. “Yeah, yeah, keep it moving.” She rattled off at them and started to jog to reach the lights in time. She came to a stop at the other side of the road, grabbing her sister's shoulder. “You know if you’re trying to ditch me, you could just tell me to fuck off!” Sam turned and blinked down at her, her eyes full of tears. “Oh,” Deanna muttered. Sam sniffed.
Dean noticed the familiar, slightly lifted, slightly absent, heavenly churning of his stomach as he counted down the minutes until Penemue would arrive. He’d left the Galileo puzzle unfinished and when Kelly arrived, Dean stood staring blankly at Castiel (his hair now back to normal and his face stickerless), Kelly, and Jack, while they worked on the few remaining pieces of the puzzle together. When the time came for the angel's shift to end, Rebecca gave the four of them a joint wave and disappeared.
Dean is thirsty.
“No, really. It’s fine. I’m actually just happy to be spending time with, uh, Jack and Cas, ya know.” Dean responded glancing down at the menu. John eyed him as the waitress returned.
“I fucking hate you, so damn much,” Dean whispered as he rested his forehead against the cool metal barrier, sobs ripped through him. His breathing spluttered as he no longer tried to hold himself together.
-----
Dean’s last thoughts in this life were one’s full of guilt. He considered his brother's face, so completely full of grief and fear and he knew he was the source of that pain. He pleaded with his brother, suddenly completely stricken with the horrible idea that Sam would resent him for choosing this for them both; that Dean had chosen to die rather than watch his younger brother die.
Dean walked out into the cold night air of the parking lot, glancing behind him. No hand on his shoulder stopped him from leaving; nobody followed. He smiled to himself. There were only a few cars left in the lot and none of them looked anything like he’d ever seen Cas drive. Dean wasn’t sure if Cas would even be driving but he did notice that he had definitely walked out of the Roadhouse, rather than simply vanish, so it was a good place to start. Dean lifted his chin trying to see into the distance. He didn’t find any car lights along the road. He marched around to the right side of the building, the gravel crunching beneath his feet, scaring the nearby cicada into silence. He paced the whole Roadhouse, his boots sinking slightly in the wet grass at its rear, before turning the last corner and spotting Castiel standing with his back resting against the slatted wooden wall.
"Dean. Sorry about all that earlier with your Dad and 👼Castiel👼. I've had some words with him so hopefully, he'll be on his best behavior tomorrow night. The place is called "Heavenly Burgers" 💩 name, I know, but it's good, I swear. I'm personally skipping lunch so I have enough room for two 🍔🍔 🤫. Meet us at 6:00 pm so we have time to catch up. Looking forward to seeing you! 😜”
She's a short one but she's a sweet one.
“Hey, if all goes well today and not like a Red-Wedding-level shitshow, you might just convince me to renew our vows in a few years just to get you off my back”. Sam sighed audibly and went back to adjusting his tie in the mirror
“I just got here, remember?” Keven scoffed.
“Come with me tomorrow”, Cas pressed as he nuzzled his nose against Dean’s. Dean inhaled shakily, his eyes fluttered open and he placed his lips against Castiel’s softly in a kiss.
. So, you know, you may wanna pump the brakes on any assassination attempts”. Kevin jumped up off his stool and nodded solemnly.
, He noticed, as he caught a moment when Sam’s words lined up with Dean’s own thoughts.
“I’ll be seeing you,” he promised ominously as disappeared in a snap of his fingers. Dean stood there alone and confused for a moment before he decided to wander around for a while. He didn't see much of anything, just a bunch of trees and empty fields, until he came upon a building. He walked toward it, only to find Bobby.
“What they had you doing in hell. Nobody deserves that. Your pain and self-loathing radiated like a supernova in that place. I couldn’t stand it.” Dean shook his head and placed his hand on Castiel’s.
Dean opened his mouth, then exhaled, and closed it again. An annoyingly familiar shiver ran through his spine and caught in the back of his throat, the kind of deep and intense shiver that always snuck up on him, especially, when he was thinking about the old days; when it was just his dad, Sammy, and him, going from motel to motel; job to job. Dean had pleaded John’s case to Castiel before. The first, and most extreme time being the argument Cas had started after he’d read John’s journal. Castiel was adamant that the only reason Dean and Sam had defended the man was because of some kind of quasi-Stockholm-syndrome style “abusive brainwashing” that made them feel “obligated to crave an ounce of respect and dignity” from him. Dean didn’t want to bring all of that up again now.
“Ding-ding-ding. I’m just here for the big delivery, though. Wanted to make sure I got you up here myself. All things considered, I still like to think of you as the Ross to my Rachel, the Salt to my Pepper, The--”
asshat… like just a-- a big ol’ meany,” Cas lowered his hand from Dean’s back and grinned at him.
“She was an angel and she seemed to... have feelings... for you”. Dean was baffled.
“Um, yeah, okay, so, uhh,” he shook his head. “Sam and I found a way to remove the mark--”
“Oh,” Castiel stated, as he slowly turned back to Dean, before he inhaled sharply, his free hand grabbed at his rib.
she reprimanded herself,
“Me? I’m obviously already way ahead of you. Booze, babes, and pie, Sam. That's what I’m gonna do. A.S.A.P. and A. much A.P.” He grinned at his brother, his throat dry.
“Amazing?” Cas interjected again, his kisses landing upon the man’s lips now.
“Is now,” she replied, rolling the poster up and placing it atop the clothing in her bag. Deanna watched as Sam zipped the bag and threw it across her shoulder. She took one last look at the dorm room before pursing her lips, sighing, and opening the door. Deanna followed Sam into the hallway, turning to close the door behind her, she walked straight into her sister who stood frozen staring down the hall.
“Really?” Sam asked, crossing his arms as well and looking into Dean eyes. “Don’t you think there is a reason he told you goodbye. You are the only one that could have stopped him.” He turned to leave.
When Castiel returned to the bunker, he always stopped for pie first to Dean's delight. When Dean went into the kitchen to grab both of them a beer, he yelled out to Cas that he had been gone to long. He always did, no mather how long Castiel had been gone. They had build this sort of routine by now for whenever Cas came home. Castiel had been gone for a bit more than a week this time, and it had really been to long in Dean's opinion. He couldn't wait to go househunting with the angel, find something to make into their perfect home.
Nights usually flew by for Castiel. Although he didn't sleep, he did consider the night to be a moment of rest. Most nights he listened to a podcast or an audiobook for a bit as Dean used him as a pillow, but some nights he just allowed himself to take in the moment. He could spend entire nights listening to the sound of Dean's breathing, honing in on the steady rise and fall of his chest and the touch of Dean's warm skin against his. As an ancient creature, eight hour didn't feel as long as it might to some, but in the trance like state he experienced those nights it felt like mere seconds.
"Is he here?"
As Castiel admired the ring, Dean quickly used his sleeve to wipe away any tears that escaped him. Castiel did the same before reaching for Dean's hands again. As soon as their hands connected, Jody spoke again.
They had agreed on a little bit of tradition. Although Dean refused to sleep in their bed without Cas the night before their wedding, they did agree there was something to the idea of only seeing each others wedding attire at the wedding itself.  Which was why Dean was headed towards Sam, where his suit was waiting for him. The only thing he knew about Cas's outfit was that it would match his. Jody, Claire and Charlie had taken both of them shopping separately to make sure of that.
"Jack said we all get to pick an ornament we like for the tree." He said as he dug through the box. He landed on a beautifully made glass reindeer and turned to Sam, still grinning. He knew he was not only the reason Sam was blushing, but also why he was smiling, and he liked being the cause of that more than a little. He pretended to be comparing the ornament and Sam, holding it up next to him. "Not quite a moose, but a reindeer is close enough, I guess." He grinned.
In all fairness, this was the Dean he fell in love with all those years ago. The one that became distant and cold when he felt like he was losing control. That hadn't been what made him fall in love, but it had always been included in the full package. A lot had changed since then, but they hadn't faced any real hardship in the past five years. Of course Dean would retreat back into himself, that had always been his way of coping when he felt like he was no longer in control. With a sigh, Castiel resigned himself to the idea that this was what he signed up for all along. It didn't change how much he loved Dean, but it was a bitter pill to swallow. After feeling like they were in it together for years, it was hard to face rock bottom alone.
"I'm really proud of you Dean," Sam said for the hundredth time that day, only this time he continued. "When we growing up I didn't always realize how much you had to give up, just to please dad and take care of me. You didn't get to be who you wanted to be, who you really were. And when I went to college you were punished for not stopping me taking my own path. We fought for free will for so long but there were times I didn't think we would know how to use if we got it. Especially you Dean, because you had your will taken away so often. But I underestimated you, I mean, look at you now. You took that freedom and used it in the only way that matters, you're finally happy. You gave up hunting, found a job that made you happy and of course you got together with Cas after not acknowledging what you guys felt for each other for years. I just... I never really found the right moment to tell you how proud that makes me. How happy I am to see my brother smiling without having to worry about it being a lie to make me feel better." Sam looked so genuine that Dean didn't didn't even think about giving him crap for giving such an emotional speech.
"I don't want to do this either Dean, but there aren't a lot of other options. This is my list. I want to ask you to make one as well so we can see who we really need to have there. I found a barn that can hold 70, but I still need to hear back from them. If we don't find anything, we can always have the wedding it in our garden, that'll hold about 20 people I think."
Claire nodded and dean couldn't help but notice how happy she seemed. "Actually yeah. He's the one that made me believe in god and when I introduced him to my girlfriend Kaia, he taught me how god loves everyone. When I told him I wanted to work towards a center to represent that, he was all for it." She explained. "It is really striking how much the two of you look alike."
“What about what we lost?” Dean asked, raising his voice. Sam scoffed. “He has lost more.” He reminded Dean. “Heaven is empty, almost all his brothers and sisters died, his father tried to destroy the world and killed his son. And now you… We… We have abandoned him.” A knot twisted in his stomach as he realized he had done nothing to stop it. He had been so caught up in his fear and grief that he completely missed the riff forming between the brothers and the angel.
Sam blinked, before seeing a dirty white ceiling.
It was too much to handle. Cas felt his knees getting weak as he gripped the bed with his free hand to stay upright. He stood there, looking at the man he loved, realizing this would be the toughest thing he would have to go through, and this would be the first time since high-school Dean wouldn’t be there to help him.
Right. Of course.
Sam cleared his throat, trying to interrupt the two of them before an actual argument formed. "He also only visits the nice kids, so you better hope Gabriel and Dean can play nice if you want Santa to visit." Sam told Jack.
Cas, who had been keeping quiet since they walked into the hospital room, now spoke softly. “Dean… I’m so sorry.” He muttered. “You trusted me and I… I’m the reason you’re here…” He told him as he looked at the pale face, resembling the face of the man he loved.
"Yeah, you know this thing." He motioned between them. The confusion on Cas's face told him he couldn't avoid talking about it anymore. "You, me... That whole thing... Your confession speech... Those uh.... Those things I prayed to you..." He could feel his face heat up and looked away. It was hard to acknowledge how he felt. Like he should be ashamed of the things he said in prayer. The things that for him were so clearly romantic, even if he had only used the word 'love' once.
"We thought we'd come by for a cup of coffee. Are you busy?" Sam asked, almost nervous.
Dean nodded. "Yeah... It's heaven alright." He responded, his voice harsher than Sam expected. Dean turned to look at his brother. "Welcome to eternity."
"Only if we're both under it."
Dean gave him a weird look, trying to figure out why the angel would leave him. "Did you forget something?"
Jessica had brought Sam and Cas a coffee each. She tried to keep it together but she barely could. She barely noticed the way the people stared at her as she walked through the halls of the hospital in her wedding dress. She had too much to deal with to care about that. Her Sam was heartbroken and Cas and Dean, who really felt like family by now had been wounded, possibly deathly in the case of Dean.
------
"They were great Cas. I didn't know Dean could even step foot in a store like yours." Sam grinned. Dean could feel his cheeks burning up again, but he never the less tried to give Sam a look that meant shut up. Sam lifted an eyebrow with an amused smile.
Dean chuckled, Jack seemed so sincere in his questions. He was glad the hunter life hadn't screwed Jack out of everything that made childhood magic. "It's not stuff like that, we do that to save people. Santa cares more about other stuff." He tried to remember what his mom had told him Santa cared about. "Like do you make your bed in the morning, are you polite to your fathers... Stuff like that."
Luckily Castiel seemed to like the idea as well. He nodded as he wondered around the garden, crouching down to get a better look of some of the flowers. Dean looked at him with a fond smile before he went inside to get a blanket and something to light the fire with.
The garden was deep, which meant he could built the firepit nice and close, but keep the section he had in mind for Cas in the back. Cas not knowing when he'd get back hadn't seemed like too much of an issue, until Dean was halfway through his project. He started to fear Cas would return before it was finished. As soon as he was finished the coin flipped and he hated having to wait to show Cas his surprise.
"Just, you know... That I felt the same. And like, I don't know man...." He was still struggling to say it, but he had to make Cas understand what this had meant to him. He couldn't look at the angel anymore as he continued. "I thought you meant the thing you told me in a different way. I messed up okay. I prayed to you that I wanted to get a house for us, and then we passed this and you told me to bring out an offer..."
Castiel had relied on Dean his whole life. Back when they met in high school Cas had been friends with Sam, best friends actually, not that that had changed in the past few years. But back then it wasn’t as easy as it was now. When Cas came out and most of the school rejected him, or talked about him, it had been Dean that protected him. His reasoning had been that Cas was a friend of Sam’s and he was protecting Sam in extension.
"We've got something for you," Sam said instead of answering right away. With that, Eileen pulled up her bag, fishing two square giftwrapped boxes out of it. She looked at the little tags with their names on it and gave Cas and Dean their respective gifts.
"My dad used to say that putting the light on was the most important task in the house." He told the kid as he tested them. "You see, it's the base of the whole decoration, so you have to do it right. We always used to start with that." The hunter continued to give strict instructions on how Jack should place the lights, where they should clip on to branches. When the lights were all placed he turned them on and smiled proudly, looking at Jack.
"I didn't know if you were into that stuff dude. I mean, you're still an angel. The only times I've ever seen you do any of that was a sort of performance or something." Dean was right about that, but that was because he had never cared for anyone like he had cared for Dean. Dean swallowed hard, grabbing Castiel's attention again. He seemed to struggle with the word, and Castiel realized why Dean had only talked about this in prayer. "And like I said... Like I tried to tell you before, I'm fine with not having that if it ain't a thing for you. I mean, I want that, but... you know. It's about you, having you close." Dean took a step closer. Castiel could feel a happy warmth blooming inside as Dean took his hand. "I love you too, Cas."
Castiel nodded. "Do you still want to reschedule?"
Besides, his first thought at being woken up hadn't been panic since Maura learned to open doors by herself. Their niece always tried to sneak into the bedroom to wake Dean up by jumping on him. "You little monster," he laughed before taking over Maura's attack by tickling her until she was laughing out and asking Cas for help.
When Dean pushed his chair back, the sudden noise cut through the silence, making Castiel's stomach tighten. Dean was still rigid as he walked over to the cabinet, pouring himself a generous glass of whiskey. He swirled it around as his eyes fell on the papers again. After a large swig, he shook his head. "So what's the plan?"
Dean smiled a little, before finally looking at Sam. "Just, don't be weird to him about this. It's not a big deal, okay?"
Despite the silence, it was clear the words were getting through to Dean. His hold on the fridge door tightened enough to turn his knuckles white. After a deep, deliberate breath Dean finally spoke. "What? They suddenly don't do weddings anymore?"
Gabriel walked into the entrance hall with the biggest grin plastered on his face, Sam looked pretty much anywhere but at Dean or Cas and Jack just looked a little confused. Gabriel sauntered over to the box of ornaments, riffling through it without paying any mind to Cas and Dean as the two got out of his way.
"At least it wasn't an hour like last time." Dean's eyes fell close already now that Cas was no longer missing from his bed. The kiss on the top of his head sealed the deal. He'd rather sleep than argue.
The other smiled at that. "Always happy to help." He assured him. Dean nodded as a grin spread on his face. "That's good news, cause I'm gonna need that help again. Yesterday you were talking about a bouquet with Amaryllises or something like that... I don't know what to expect, but it sounded pretty good." He noticed the other trying not to laugh at his pronunciation and gave him an apologetic look. Still the other didn't correct him, but instead nodded in understanding.
Castiel let out an angry huff, his eyes like thunder as he turned around to face Gabriel. "Then leave." The command was short. He had wanted this for so long, he wasn't going to let their special moment be ruined by Gabriel. Gabriel seemed to notice the frustration, but looked uncertain about what to do.
But to celebrate their love and the life they built together. To wear Cas's ring and carry that feeling with him wherever he went... Life wasn't just about needing, not anymore.
Dean pulled the contract out of his bag and handed it to Cas so he could read while Dean ate. "They're opening a new location and they want me to run it," he explained while eating his burger. "Levar told me it's going to be taking up a lot of free time the coming weeks, but once it's opened at least I won't have to work as much extra hours. Would you be okay with that?"
They drove away in the dark early morning, the snow still falling lightly, covering the world around them in a white blanket.
He let himself be led outside, trusting the hunter to be his guide. When Dean removed his hands Castiel took it as a que to open his eyes. The sight that met him was astounding. They were halfway through the garden, on a stone path surrounded by the most beautiful array of flowers. The colors that met him almost distracted him from what was at the end of the path.
After Eileen and Cas were all set up, happily chatting about what Eileen was getting Sam for his birthday, Sam walked into the room. "Hey Cas, which of these were meant for the bedroom?"
Castiel couldn't speak yet, he could barely even think. It had been too long since he heard those words and he never needed to hear them as much as he did now. When he calmed down a little he pulled back from the safe cocoon Dean formed around him. "I love you too, Dean. I'm sorry." He unclutched one of his fists that was grabbing onto the back of Dean's shirt so he could wipe away the others tears. He never meant to make Dean cry.
He wasn't working on it alone of course. Whenever Sam and Eileen had time, they'd come to by to help on the house or bring Dean food. Cas had a chance to be on earth a little more as well now that the biggest damage done to heaven was restored. Dean enjoyed those days the most, where it was just the two of them, working side by side in a comfortable quiet or while talking about the plans for their home.
Castiel smiled, looking at the house again. "That is true. It looks like it has a nice garden as well. No you're right. I like it." Castiel told Dean with a nod. "Most houses here are kept up pretty well. If you want to work on the house yourself, it seems like this is the best choice."
"You don't look happy." He noted. Dean gave him a humourless smile. "Yeah well, neither do you."
Sam said a few words to his brother, how he wasn’t allowed to not pull through this. How he had to fight, how young he was and how much more he could do. If dean could actually hear it, he might not wake up just to spite Sam after that chick-flick moment. Sam just nodded softly before leaving the room. They had agreed he’d be back in 3 hours so he and Jess could change out of their wedding attire and Cas could sleep in the time Sam took over from him.
After they had written down all possibilities and had categorized the guestlist again, Dean's phone rang. With half an eye he checked to see who it was. "It's Brian, I need to take this real quick."
About two months after Jack saved the angel, Castiel returned to the bunker like he usually did, with pie in hand. Their ritual started and Dean talked about a nest of vampires he had killed. Half way through the story Dean realized that he had made plans to go to Sam and Eileen's place for dinner. He sent his brother a text, apologizing for being late and informing him Cas was coming along.
Dean shrugged. "This ain't for me." He countered. "It's for the kid. I want him to have some semblance of normalcy."
"Meaning?" Dean wasn't dumb, he understood the basics of what Levar was saying, but he was curious what expansion meant them and why he was called in specifically. Were they going to stuff more workers in the already crowded garage or was this an 'offer' for Dean to do nightshifts or work weekends or something like that.
"Do the kind of flowers you sell change around the holidays?" Dean asked surprised and actually vaguely interested in the answer.
"Candy, Sam?" Dean said, lifting an eyebrow. "Or is it just cause there is no sugar in this fake one." He asked before he laughed at his own joke.
"Reschedule?"
"It felt like a long while." Dean answered softly. "I'm glad your back." He admitted before resting his head on Cas's shoulder.
"What do you think?" Although the ultimate goal was to get an answer, Maura always looked proud when Castiel asked her for a theory first. After a moment of thought she started explaining how she believed dreams were like a movie in a secret world. In her theory, she kept coming up with new ideas before the old ones were fully formed. There was something in her enthusiasm that was so distinctly Dean. It wasn't just the way her eyes grew wide as she stumbled into a theory she liked. It was also how she tried to stay quiet throughout it all to make sure her little brother could go back to sleep in Cas's arms. One look at her brother was enough to make her talk in a hushed voice as she accompanied her story with rapid, enthusiastic sign language.
Sam shook his head. "I'm allowed to like something sweet every once in a while." He countered, his eyes never quite meeting Deans. Dean nodded, then stopped for a second as his eyes moved over to Gabriel, a small smirk was still firm on the archangels lips. Dean looked back at Sam with wide eyes, but Sam kept avoiding his gaze.
“You what?” Sam asked as Dean told him Castiel had left. His brothers face was blank as he said that Castiel was gone and Dean hadn’t even tried to make him stay. “How could you just let him leave?” Sam asked, to dumbfounded to even be angry. Dean sighed. “Listen, we can do this without him…”
The longer they stayed like that, the more Cas felt like he had to ask. When he looked at Dean again his eyes were closed and his chest was moving gently up and down with every breath. It could wait until the morning, or he could just blame Dean's actions on him being tired, and probably lonely after nearly three weeks on his own. He let the hunter sleep for now, watching over him as he did. Watching over Dean was as close as he could get to sleep. It was relaxing and it gave him time to empty his mind.
Gabriel was laughing loud, enjoying the spectacle.
With a squint Maura regarded him. "I want pancakes!" She demanded, poking his side again as a threat.
The bridesmaids had apparently been there for hours already to help Eileen. Charlie and Eileen had grown really close after Dean introduced them. He missed her, and decided to pay a visit to her LARP campaign. They'd been best friends ever since and she often joined the group for dinner in between meetings. In this timeline, she had won the trust of her boss as well. But since he wasn't a Leviathan and he was just a decent person, he had given Charlie the reigns of the company after he retired.
He looked up at Sam first, seeing that big goofy smile that might soon be reflected in the next generation of Winchesters. After carefully setting down the glass next to the one that said uncle Castiel, he pulled his brother in close to congratulate him. Cas was already hugging Eileen next to him. Tears of joy streamed over Deans face as he reached out for Eileen next, while Cas hugged Sam.
By the time they finished two snowmen, a large one by Dean, Cas and Jack and a smaller one by Sam and Gabriel, Dean's hands were freezing. He was to stubborn to just ask for his gloves back, but decided it might be best to go back inside. Just when he was about to suggest that, he could feel something his his side with a thud. He turned to see Gabriel laughing and to see Sam already holding a snowball of his own.
Castiel gave Jack a hug before the other took his place next to the make shift altar. Jody granted them another moment of silence as Castiel took both of Dean's hands in his, receiving an encouraging squeeze. It was still hard to believe this was really happening, but he also didn't doubt it for a second. His happiness was to real for the rest of it to be fake. Once the music stopped Jody started speaking. "Friends, family, we are gathered here today to celebrate the official union of Dean Winchester and Castiel Novak."
Castiel stopped his ramble by pressing his lips against Dean again, he could feel the tension leaving the other.
"Sounds good." He answered, the words coming out softer then intended. The man handed him the angel. "Oh it is."

It wouldn't hurt to get something nice for the apartment every now and again.
“Dean, it's okay.” Sam spluttered, completely distraught, “You can go now.”
“I’m sure. Shut up, I’m trying to watch this.” Dean interjected, a small smile twitched at the very edges of his mouth for a moment, and his eyes filled with something Castiel couldn’t place, a spark of something audacious yet chaste that made his heart ache at the site of it. Castiel shook his head as the memory version of himself began to speak again.

“Well, they do say that death sneaks up on you.” Dean rolled his eyes and tried to have another go at drinking the fruity drink in silence.
