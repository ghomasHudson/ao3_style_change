and then he kicked the bucket, in a big fucking way, and left Dean— left Dean—
“Thought you weren’t falling asleep in front of the TV anymore,” Sam says, pushing Dean halfway off the couch so he can sit. Sometimes Dean forgets how goddamn large his kid brother got until he’ll just take up half a couch, all on his lonesome.
“Well,” Cas says, a small smile at the corner of his mouth, and Dean looks at it and looks at him and he cannot for the life of him stop thinking: Cas is alive. “All right.”
And then he adds, like it’s— like it’s important, urgent, the only thing he’ll ever have to say in his life— he adds, “My— my husband’s name was Cas.”
“I can feel it,” Cas says, breaking the silence, finally. He frowns. “The storm. I think… whether it’s my latent grace or simply my resurrection, I can feel it.”
Sam’s text comes in the early afternoon, more than a full 24 hours after the night Dean left. It’s a case. Right, okay. Sam’s sending him out on cases now. No
. That’s what she’d said.
Claire’s mouth flattens. “An exception.”
“Exit here,” Dean says, three hours in. Cas exits smoothly, picture perfect driving, and Dean swallows. Hand over hand on the wheel, Jesus Christ—
“I—” Sam scratches the back of his head. “Honestly, man, I. I looked up… I looked up prayers for. For, for gay— or, queer, I guess, men.” Dean watches Sam’s slow and careful blinks, the way he looks at his computer screen and hasn’t faced Dean once, and thinks,
Dean looks her right in the face. “‘Cause he was my kid,” he says hoarsely. “You gotta understand that. He was my dead kid, lyin’ there on that mattress, at twenty-three goddamn years old, an’ I looked at him and I said these exact words to him. For the first time in my life I told him that when he was little and he asked me those things, I’d say to him, ‘Quit askin’, Sammy. Man, you don’t wanna know.’”
Fuck. Dean runs a hand down his face, pulling the skin of his cheeks down. He can feel the wrinkles forming, the jowls sagging. Rhonda used to tell him,
Cas takes his hand. “You know no one would ever judge you for— for who you love.”
He turns back to look at Cas again, who’s slumped against the table, all that taut, electric energy gone right out of him.
Yeah. All right. Dean says, “If you. If you want me out, you can— you can keep the room.” It’s a small price to pay. Dean would give up his memory foam mattress and his Vonnegut shelf in a heartbeat for Cas.
Eventually, hoarsely, Dean says, “You coulda just moved the whole couch.”
“That’s nice, Sam.” Dean inhales. Christ. He covers his face with his hands, can’t— can’t even look at anything right now. He’s not crying, exactly, but he just. He needs it.
“Me too,” Dean whispers. “He’s been doin’ it for… since all that time. Twelve years he’s been savin’ me.”
“You give them hope,” Cas insists. “You lived. They don’t know everything about you, but you’re generous with what you can tell them. They know about the assumptions and violence you grew up with, and they can see that you’re happy anyway. Isn’t that a good example? Being happy?”
And they haul a mattress over to the floor next to Sam’s bed, and Dean flops down on it in his boxers, and listens to Sam’s breathing the way he did nearly every night for the first twenty-two years of his life. Into the silence, Dean whispers: “Thanks, Sam.”
“Real nice,” Dean mutters. He got in five fucking minutes ago. Drove two hours on a hangover to come home to Sam, telling him Cas has found another reason to disappear. Can’t catch a break. “Always a good idea to go alone to angel meets.” What is it about Dean that makes him so unfit for backup, huh? What’s he gotta do to make himself needed around here?
Jesus. He shuts his eyes and lets it break over him, the grief of it. I’m so in love with you, he thinks. How could you not know? Every day I wake up thinking there’s something wrong with me, like my heart stopped in the middle of the night or my legs have gone missing, but it’s you. That’s just what it feels like, living without you.
Cas’s biceps splitting the seams of Dean’s shirts. Cas’s Sunday afternoon grumbling over his weekly Sudoku puzzle. The only thing Dean can think to say is, “I don’t want you to leave, that’s what.”
“Biology is elastic for us.” Lucifer is a power source, and nothing more. To suggest that Jack is like Lucifer would be to claim an oven is like water because it runs on hydroelectricity. “Sam, we are— do you remember what I said? Angels are wavelengths of celestial
“So.” He hears a pen click. Maybe she’s taking notes. “The way this usually works is, I like to ask a few questions, get to know you. But we’ve met already, and I get the sense that you might be calling about something in particular. Is that accurate?”
. Like a
“I—” Cas sits up, turning to Dean, but Dean keeps his eyes on the road. He hasn’t earned those blue eyes, not yet. “Dean. You’re full of love. What on earth makes you think—”
. Sam looks at them, undeniably feminine, and Dean just says,
When they’re done, Claire goes out to get their car parked a ten minute walk away, while Kaia and Castiel wait at the front door for them to pick them up.
with me, so he’s fucked in the head in the first place, sure, but not even Cas would stick around and live with the object of his— his goddamn
“Shut up,” Dean says, without any bite to it ‘cause he likes Amy. He crawls back under the crappy Ford some asshole totaled three days ago and works.
“I, ah.” Bobby turns to look back out into the hallway, but Dean’s at work and Dad’s not coming back for another week. So Bobby faces Sam and says, “Y’know somethin’, Sam. I’m— I’m like you, in a way.”
“Well, it feels… purposeful.” Mary laughs, feeling stupid. “I mean. That’s obvious. People don’t just get resurrected for no reason.”
The asshole slumps over the bar, leering in her direction, and Dean makes his way towards them. Asshole says, “What, you don’t want me?” and Lindsay says, “Even if I was into men I wouldn’t be into you,” and Asshole says, “You a fuckin’ dyke—” and Dean slams his head into the countertop.
Cas doesn’t disappoint. He runs his free hand up Dean’s side, and then back down to his hip, that favorite anchor point of his, and he says, “You’ve taken almost my whole hand.”
Sam says, “Is there a summoning spell for… dust storms?”
“Where
After a pause, Cas asks, “Have you been looking for dates, Dean?”
Easy. Yeah. “‘Kay,” Dean says, and he raps his knuckles against the table. He leaves the parenting audit behind, too. “Thanks, Sammy.”
“It is good, isn’t it,” Dean says incredulously. They figured it out. Took ‘em twelve years, but they figured it out. He bumps Claire’s shoulder. One day there’ll be a new crop of hunters, even younger than she is, and Dean’ll be like some old grandpa, telling war stories and feeding them up good. It feels good under his skin, all these things that could happen in the future, with all the people he loves. Warm with it, he says, “Thanks, kid,” and even he can hear the joy in it.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas says, so fucking unselfconscious it’s unreal. He smiles, his eyes crinkling with it, and Dean can’t help but smile back.
Sam enters the kitchen and drops a dirty plate into the sink, eyeing Dean as he nervously gulps down a glass of water.
Perhaps it’s too little, too late.
Cas’ tongue swiped over Dean’s lip, begging for entry. Dean’s surprised gasp parted his lips and he groaned again when Cas’ tongue tangled with his. With each flick of the tongue, Cas added a slow roll of his hips.
"See the brunette in the sparkly red dress dancing with Danny Devito's twin? Way over there."
The man has slayed monsters and demons and lived through every version of Hell, but Castiel has never seen him look so scared.
. He knows because sometimes, when Sam picks up burgers from the diner or when Dean smiles at him until the little crinkles appear at the corners of his eyes, the darkness isn’t so dark.
The pain of being split open on Cas’ cock, his muscles straining in the position, his back scraping against the wall — it's everything. He
Surprisingly, Chad doesn’t seem the slightest bit discouraged, just intrigued. Both he and Candice look a little stunned, but the wheels are definitely turning as their eyes assess the newest addition to their
She holds out a delicate hand for Dean to shake, “My name’s Candice.”
. For Dean.
Oh thank God,
He stares unblinkingly at Dean until the man swallows hard and starts to look worried. He speaks again.
“I’m going to put earplugs in now, Cas,” Dean explained. “You won’t be able to hear anything, so if you get overwhelmed just say the word, okay?”
For every nuance of human nature that he finally understands, there are five more in its place bewildering him.
Cas’ mouth pressed soft kisses up Dean’s jawline until he reached his ear. He whispered again, his breath ghosting over Dean’s ear, sending chills down his spine.
That’s all it takes for him to nod once and close the door.
Castiel pushes and pushes until he's balls deep inside Dean in one unyielding thrust.
Dean stands wordlessly in the kitchen as he wraps his head around Sam’s speech. Dean thinks it’s Sam’s equivalent to “Get your head out of your ass and go for it.”
Dean listened as Sam gave him a quick recap - weird symbols, librarian, probable salt-and-burn, yadda yadda. It was hard to pay attention when Cas' lips were sucking marks into Dean’s neck, his fingers deftly unbuttoning his shirt and toying with his nipples.
“You are so—”
“I’m tired,” Cas grumbles, but he sits up anyway. “If you insist.”
, and Sam says, “S’just a— a prayer.”
Over the next two weeks, Cas withdraws. Dean probably wouldn’t even have noticed, or at least not put much stock in it, to be frank, except that it seems to happen right after the therapy session of doom, and even though Sam said Cas was out Dean can’t get it out of his head that Cas might’ve overheard him. Dean doesn’t even remember what he said anymore but he knows it’s not normal to phone a professional just to date someone. One night Cas leaves around eight and doesn’t come back until two in the fucking morning, and Dean pretends to be asleep ‘cause it’s fine, it’s fine, who the hell is he to keep Cas on a ball and chain.
are shaking. “Holy shit, Cas.”
“I want it,” Dean admits, feeling curled inside out and rotten and scraped clean all at the same time. He’s never wanted anything like this before in his life. He’s terrified. He looks at Cas, and Cas looks at him, and Dean leans in, and Cas—
“I never thought of it consciously,” Cas says, thoughtfully, like he’s just working it out as he speaks, “but I chose this body for a reason. It was… it was meaningful to me, to fall as a man. A man who…” Cas’s mouth twists, and Dean watches Cas watch his own hand curl into a fist. “A man who loves other men.”
“It’s funny, you doing the hard work while I relax,” she says, while Dean figures out where to put the TV so the cord can reach the outlet. “You know, I was ready for two rowdy boys. Well,” she laughs, “I wasn’t, really. No one prepares you for what toddlers are like.”
. “I’m stupid,” he says, nervelessly. He can’t feel his hands. He just looks at Cas in the half-light of the dying sun through the motel blinds and he thinks, I just have to ask. But I can’t ask. “I’m the stupidest man in the world.”
“You guys are gross,” Sam says delightedly from the back seat. Dean goes cold. Sam doesn’t mean it in a bad way — hell, from the look on his face this is about the happiest he’s ever been about someone Dean’s, y’know — it’s just.
“Thanks,” Sam mumbles. And then, louder, “Shit, sorry, we were— we were talking about Cas.”
Most days, he moves through it easy. His great pain is Lucifer’s true face. But even on those days, the days when it’s easy, he— he thinks he’ll see her when he opens his eyes, every morning. He winces, anticipates her, on the ceiling, her face wide open to him, and it’s not exactly a relief when he opens his eyes and she’s gone. Was she in pain? It was Brady who did it, or the demon inside Brady who’d lean in close when Sam had too much at the bar down the street. He’d set his hand, warm, on Sam’s stomach while he reached into Sam’s front pocket for his keys. He must’ve knocked on the door and said
He says, “S’nice of your partner to make you lunch,” and wonders if Cas would ever have done that, if things were different. Things have settled down now, the way they never did when Cas was alive. This is the first time since he picked Sam up from Stanford that he’s ever actually had a steady paycheck. Not that he needs one, but it’s nice to do something people can say helped them. The asshole with the Ford can take his fixed up suspension and drive off and fuck it up all over again, but no one can deny that it was fixed. That Dean made it better, for a minute, a day, a week. For years, even, for the folks who’re careful.
“My worry is that I’m not useful to you,” Cas says.
“Do you want—” and Cas pushes into him just a bit further, and Dean chokes out a breath, a small but sharp
“I meant what I said,” Dean says to his steering wheel. And then he looks over at Cas. Blue eyes, he’d call him, if he got to be sweet on him like that. If he could, he’d sing some cheesy song for Cas at an open mic night and kiss his eyelids in the mornings, but that isn’t for Dean Winchester. He doesn’t know how to get from here to there. Dean studies the crook of his mouth and the cleft of his chin and says, “You deserve better than pretend.”
, he thinks of Cas saying,
want anything. Hasn’t wanted anything since— since—
Sam eyes him. “It’s way too late for me to unpack that, but dude. You deserve good things.”
“Shit. Understatement, buddy,” he snorts, and Cas smiles, too. Dean realizes he should get outta the habit of saying buddy. Start saying—
“Shit,” Dean breathes, because yeah. He can’t picture himself in sweats. The closest he can come is remembering what he’d wear to PE, or pajamas from when he was a kid. He’s never worn a sweatsuit in his life. “Okay, yeah.”
There’s some shuffling, and then Jack takes over. “I think it’s a dwende,” he says. “There’s a lot of Filipino convenience stores around here, and four people have said that they prey on, uh. The immoral. Which maybe includes drinkers?”
Cas adjusts his glasses — Dean can feel it, from the way his chest moves under Dean’s arms — and reads: “Beloved—my brutal ephemeral monument: if you are hungry then take note of my fleshy contiguous body, my ocean, my confidence scheme— won’t you eat? won’t it be well? won’t your mouth tremble fervently at the betrayal of my breast, my proun, my enterprise?”
. He’d said exactly those words. Dean never knew what broke the connection. They never figured it out. “We don’t
But who
“You’re not—”
“You’re a possessive bastard, aren’t you,” Dean says, but he can’t really catch his breath through it, and Cas can see, anyway, how hard he is from it.
Dean’s got no clue how he got to his room after that. He knows he made Sam promise to get outside today, see some sky, talk to someone, and then slouched his way back to Bethlehem in a daze. He wishes he could suffocate himself. He’d forgotten too.
“Fine with me,” Dean says. “Is it go time?”
“Where are we going?” Cas had asked from the backseat about an hour into the drive, and Dean’d almost driven them off the road. He’d been looking at Cas in the rearview the whole damn time but his voice still took him by surprise.
“If I hadn’t cast the bonding spell— I put you in danger. Bobby might still have his home. It was selfish, coming back to you. I’ve made things here worse.”
it,” he muttered, trying to get his bearings enough to pull himself up. His right hand had landed in the sludge puddle, and as he turned over to sit, he sighed as he wiped his hand on his carpet. Then wiped what stuck to his hand from the carpet onto his jeans.
“Dean,” Cas said against his lips, like a wish.
Cas lips pursed. “I believe so.
“Me’n my brother, we’re hunters. Bobby, too.” He knew there was a reason why he clicked with Charlie so well. Outside of all the ‘she’s actually a really cool person’ stuff. There was a depth to her he found comforting. Familiar.
Dean’s heart started pounding. He put the ravioli down on the table beside the bed and ran his hands over his brother’s matted hair, trying to wake him.
The next morning, Dean walked into the library wrapped in a blue robe he found hanging in the shower room.
“We shouldn’t go through Nashville,” Sam said, turning down the music. “There are too many people, too many cars in the way.”
Dean started, surprised at the casual way she mentioned it. “Vamps? You got a vamp problem?”
Behind her, Cas stood—his angel blade held high over his shoulder in a white-knuckled grip.
A hot shower. That still held the top spot on Dean’s miss list.
They all jumped at the sudden change in atmosphere. “You couldn’t have done that from the beginning?” Bobby asked pointedly.
“It’s fine. It’s almost dark anyway. I’ll stay here and keep an eye on things,” he said, readjusting his pillow and closing his eyes. “And you sound like hell, Sam. Get rid of the cough, it keeps us up at night.”
Dean closed his eyes and he must have dozed off because he came to at the sound of Sam slamming the broken door of their unit back into place.
“What’s wrong with you?” This was as close to yelling Dean had ever heard him get, anger thick in his voice.
His partner visibly cringed. “Come on, Turiel. I’ve only read eight human novels and I know that’s… a bit cliché,” she said.
Dean and Sam both looked at him with surprise, eyes going wide as they processed what he’d said. Dean wasn’t sure he’d ever get used to it, Cas’ ability to speak so bluntly about something so enormous. With that thought, the flames of hell started licking at his consciousness, and he blinked to clear the vision away. He looked at the gun in pieces in front of him and started its reassembly.
Dean looked over at Cas, who was still reading the journal.
From his usual, uncomfortable seat, Dean watched the way Cas’ back moved as he lifted two heavy bags of wet grinds. He made his way out from behind the counter and headed towards the side door that led to the alleyway.
“Like?” Bobby asked.
It was Cas’ turn to breathe out a small laugh. “That’s actually quite an accurate analogy,” he said, looking out the window before turning back to Dean. “I meant it though, Dean. My apology.”
“Hello, Dean.”
“Can’t we talk to them, yet?” one asked.
Sam sighed and shifted in his chair to look at Dean. Dean could feel the stare trying to chip away his reserve, trying to get him to open up and admit he was wrong.
“Found something,” he said, holding a pack of ramen noodles, a single bottle of Gatorade, and two cans of spaghetti.
. Don’t you understand? Michael is the Sword of God. He commands the Heavenly Host. And promised to kill us if we return without the demon tablet,” he hissed. His face twisted with rage as he pointed at Cas. “That traitor has killed us.”
“Consider it called,” Dean said. “Dinner?” When no one answered him, he stood up and walked to the kitchen alone, where he could eat Mr. Noodles in peace.
“Fan-freakin’-tastic.”
He threw the phone onto the mattress beside him and leaned back, crossing his arms behind his head.
Checking out the room, all of the disinterested eyes and filled glasses, Dean couldn’t help but crack a grin at the others and move through the small crowd to the bar. Why not lean into it a little—as far as he could tell, there was nothing to be afraid of.
. Or maybe it was the way he’d said it.
Some people might have been surprised at how burnt away the metal and plastic that made up the exterior of most of the trailers could get. But Dean hadn’t been. He’d seen how quickly houses can burn a few times in his life.
“What do you mean?” Sam asked, not quite meeting his brother’s eyes as Dean twisted in his chair to look at him.
“Normal?” Dean asked. “Didn’t we pass by there our way home from the coast?” He looked at Sam and hoped for answers.
“Where you goin’?” Dean asked, working harder than he should have had to focus his eyes.
“If something happened in 1958, it’s likely all evidence of it is gone,” Cas said, visibly working through the puzzle in his mind.
“Fuck, Cas, please,” he moaned, he pled. He’d never felt so shameless, never so whole or so wanted. When Cas started slow and easy, Dean pulled him down so he could swallow the desperate, delicious noises he was making. And when that turned into something harder and hungrier, when Cas was fucking him so hard it was like getting hit by a goddamn tsunami, the fact Dean had ever thought something as small and powerless as a whirlpool could swallow him whole seemed impossible, like a bad joke.
“Yes.”
“Don’t,” he finally managed. He didn’t need this, he needed Cas to tell him everything was okay, that they all had fun and it was fine. He needed to know all of the horrible flickering visuals in his head were just his imagination—his brain’s cruel way of punishing him for drinking too much.
“Speaker’s dead,” he recovered quickly. “No fiesta for us, hombre.”
“Ow,” Cas said, his voice deeper than his usual gravel. “That was very unpleasant.”
Finally, he spoke, but all he could get out was, “Cas,” so fast and breathy it almost sounded like a question. He shifted his lower half slightly, a degree to the right, towards the angel. He guessed it was the reaction Cas was looking for because he rewarded Dean with more pressure, and started to slowly move his hand. And that was it—Dean was lost.
“…Yes.”
Dean massaged the bridge of his nose. For months the only thing that he’d been focused on was survival. Finding food. Water. Avoiding other people. Conserving ammunition. He hadn’t had time to worry about how people were feeling. He knew Sam was sick, and getting worse, but he couldn’t bring himself to face it beyond barking at his brother to take some antibiotics. Bobby had practically stopped talking after they left his house behind. Dean tried to bring it up once, ask him how he was doing, and he got back an answer as authentic as his question had sounded.
Arms wrapped around Dean’s waist and he didn’t know how, but suddenly they were out of the smoke and surrounded by the light of the broken-down front door.
Maybe, goddamn it.
“Is this ok?”
“Because I’m having a difficult time controlling my impulses,” Cas continued, talking over Dean. “I assume it’s connected to my dwindling grace, but this manner of… feeling… is not something I’m accustomed to, and I’ve been finding it challenging to manage.”
He finally moved to look at Cas’ face, torn between amazement and bone-deep worry, and almost jumped out of skin when he realized Bobby and Sam were standing close by, fear and exhaustion carving deep lines into their faces.
“Dean—”
(See the end of the chapter for
They walked to the edge of the yard, where early on they’d used the junked cars to try and reinforce some sort of barrier between them and whatever was on the other side.
He didn’t answer, like he was still trying to compute whatever it was that was going on in his head. Then after a moment, he asked, “Do you want to discuss what happened this afternoon?”
Dean settled back into how he’d been sitting before, one hand holding his mug, the other pressing down the pages of the journal, and listened to the rush of blood thrumming in his ears.
Sam went quiet in the passenger’s seat. Not making any noise other than clearing his throat. He covered his face with the crook of his elbow to cough into it, only making things worse when he inhaled the fine dust that covered his jacket.
“Yes, Dean. You can touch them. Just be gentle. Although they’re only an intimation of the wings I possess, I’ve learned they have a tendency to be... sensitive.”
“What’re you saying?” Dean asked, “What kinda
But—and Dean would rather go back to Hell than admit this to anybody—when he let himself remember the press of Cas’ hips against his, the drag of stubble across his skin, that feeling burned right through his guilt.
“The world is shit. It always has been,” he looked down at his hands. “It’s just now, more people have to face it.”
Dean said it all again after Cas collapsed heavy on top of him, amid flickering lights and the fading burn of silver behind blue eyes, when they were both panting and sticky with sweat and come.
Afriel was already distracted pouring sugar on the table from the glass dispenser, watching the tiny piles peak and collapse. The rest of them shifted in their seats, except Cas, who sat unmoving like he was made of marble.
“Knock yourself out.” Dean tried not to wince when his palm was cut open, Cas turning his hand over to let his blood drip onto the flattened, dry gravel of the driveway. Cas spoke more commandingly this time, the unfamiliar Enochian syllables rolling off his tongue and right through Dean.
“Is that it?” Sam asked him.
“What’s wrong?” Dean tried to control his breathing as Cas leaned his head back against the brick, looking down at Dean with a cocked brow even as he continued to slowly writhe against him.
Dean looked at his brother, his nerves frayed as Sam dropped to his knees to try and help.
“No, I don’t have a harp,” Cas said quietly to Dean. “I do not have a harp,” he repeated, louder, so the other group could hear him.
“Look, we have a pretty decent community here,” Charlie said, flexing her hands although they were still raised above her head. “We saw you drive through town and thought we could offer you a place to stay and see if you wanted to trade supplies.” She was wincing from the pins and needles.
“This has been a good night,” he said, although his words didn’t match how he said them.
Sam looked as tired as he did the day before but his face was already buried back in the ledger, eyes darting across the page and back like he was watching a slow tennis match.
“I know we've been apart for some time, but in case you’ve both forgotten, I don’t sleep.”
Dean raised his eyebrows. “Yeah? We’ll take you up on that.”
Dean finally felt his nerves taking a backseat. “How about losing a couple layers, yourself?” he asked, running his hands over Cas’ clothed stomach.
Cas turned to look at Dean, to watch his face. “When we arrive, we can find a safe house and discuss our next steps,” he said quietly. His hand was still moving slowly up and down, covering every inch of him, taking extra time to press his fingers around the sensitive tip. Dean finally let go of the suffering mug to cover Cas’ hand with his own—to add more pressure as his hips pushed forward.
“We don’t have all day,” Dean said plainly. He was forcing himself to stay seated, to not drag Cas right out of the diner. Even though it was lit up with some of the first electricity they’d seen in weeks, and Dean was this close to asking if Afriel could magic him up some pie, he couldn’t get his head out of where he thought Cas’ head might be. He had to hold back from grabbing his leg again, or his hand, or wrapping an arm around his shoulders.
Without warning, the door swung open, and they all aimed their weapons at the sudden movement. In front of them stood an old man, maybe 80 or 90 years old with a white moustache that matched his duck-down head of hair.
“It was in August of 1994,” Cas added. “You were 15, Dean. Sam was 11. Your father was following a clue about his parentage to Normal, Illinois. But it was a dead end.”
Dean hadn’t eaten so they pulled through a drive-through.
“Thank you, Bobby,” Cas said, and Dean could hear his smile.
That apron. Dean had hated it the second he saw it. Now it was just another layer between them. He leaned back, just enough to try to rip the goddamn thing off of Cas without breaking the contact between their bodies.
“So, we done here?” Dean asked, legs shaking from the effort of staying upright. He wiped more sweat out of his eyes. “I could really use a nap.”
“Sorry about, uh, anything you might be pissed at me for.” Dean avoided eye contact choosing instead to look at the steam rising from his coffee.
,” Dean bit off. He rolled his shoulders, trying to pull some of the tension out of them. “So, you coming in? Or are you just going to lurk in the doorway all night?”
“Hey, how’d you know to, you know?” he made a chopping gesture with his hand.
Afriel’s face finally twisted, like the smell of the diner had finally hit her. The next moment, the diner was sparkling clean and looked like it might have before the world went to hell. The lights were even on.
“What the hell are you talking about? I want coffee. A
Neither was a good choice. One of them either took the cold room with the corrugated metal and particle board only mostly attached to one wall, or slept one the moldy couch that smelled like burnt chemicals and bug spray.
“I’m good,” he said, climbing up from the dusty floor where he’d been thrown.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nice hair, kid,” Bobby said to Cas, eyeing the tangled mess that was sticking out in more directions than usual.
“Guess so,” he answered with a smile she couldn’t see, but he bet she could hear. He paused for a moment then pressed the button on the mic down again. “What’s up… uh, over?” he asked, wincing at the lame delivery.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Me and Cas
They made their way to a smaller country road, then another, and continued west for a few hours. Dean ate snacks and laughed at the face Cas made when he bit into one of the chalky energy bars he said, “couldn’t be that bad.” Dean made bad jokes, and sometimes Cas humoured him and laughed but he mostly just rolled his eyes, and they talked about old cases and old friends and it all felt the way it should. It felt good.
Sam turned his head and aimed his squint directly at his brother.
“Hey, Cas,” he replied, standing to greet the angel. And there they were, just as Dean remembered them. The massive wings were tucked neatly behind Cas’ back but still dwarfed everything in their presence. Dean. The room. But they made Cas look larger than life and Dean’s breath caught in his throat as they twitched and rustled as he took them in.
**********
Bobby poured the drink down his throat and reached his cup over so Dean could pour him another. Dean obliged, making sure not to spill.
“I’m good. I just need a minute,” Sam said, grimacing as he saw the blood that covered his pillow.
“I was right.”
“Awesome. The leader in Falls City is named Eileen. But she’ll communicate through her ASL translator, Kevin.”
“Who else would make you coffee in the mornings? I like to think I’ve made myself indispensable.”
Dean’s mouth fell open as Cas palmed his dick, small sounds spilling out of the back of his throat as Cas bit into the tender flesh that covered the curve of his hip.
“No, we were waiting for you to rest up. Needed that gargantuan brain of yours to help us figure it out.” He dug the heels of his boots in the dirt, noticing a crack in the leather at the bend of his foot. Frankly, Dean couldn’t believe his brother remembered any of their conversation about the symbol drawn on the Impala. It seemed like it had taken place about a hundred years ago even though it’d been less than a week.
Dean jumped at the sudden proximity of the voice.
Sam grimaced and handed him the bottle, turning to look in the cupboards for a bowl. Dean rolled his eyes and fell back into his spot on the couch, washing down his mouthful with grape-flavoured sugar water. He could honestly say this was the best meal he’d ever had.
“Yes. She wasn’t able to complete the incantation. Even for a witch many times more powerful than her, it would be impossible.”
He turned to the angel and touched his finger over his own lips. Dean knew he didn’t have to tell him to keep it down, or at least he wouldn’t have had to a year ago, but he didn’t know this Cas. He reminded Dean of the cold, removed soldier he’d shot when they first met.
“What? Of course not,” Dean brushed off.
Dean sat up and rubbed his eyes, trying to quiet the parts of his brain that seemed determined to drive his life into the ground even more than he already had on his own. He stared into the lamp in front of him until his eyes started to unfocus from the brightness of the light. Taking a steadying breath, looked down at his hands. Even if Cas’ phone was turned off, Dean knew he’d hear this loud and clear.
Dean didn’t dote over him, he just handed him his mug of sludge and let his brother find his place beside him in the small circle of warmth.
“Hey, Sammy?” He said quietly, walking in. The bed was against the left side of the room, and a window on the far side let in some of the grey light from outside. Dean could make out his brother’s shape under the pile of blankets he’d barely left for days. Pushing aside the yellowed, sheer curtains so he could see a little better, he sat on the edge of the bed, wincing as the springs groaned under his weight. It was not a comfortable mattress.
Sam opened the glovebox, pushing aside a bunch of napkins (
“Cas— God, Cas,” Dean prayed, only loud enough for the other man to hear, as Cas reached under his jacket to touch the sensitive skin at Dean’s sides, setting him on fire.
Rufus’ pistol dropped an inch, and a few of the other members of his group shared worried looks.
“Goddamn it, Sam. Have some decency!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam’s eyes went back to the bloody mess of Dean’s flannel. “I should’ve been in there with you.”
They walked slowly to the front of the house, where the wind wasn’t obstructed by the piles of junk like it was in the backyard. Bobby’s place was surrounded by trees, but Dean cringed at the stink of rot the breeze carried past them. It wasn’t always like this, or he was just getting used to the smell, but when it hit, it hit hard.
There wasn’t enough of anything. No resources to help the dying. No fuel to burn the dead. And as poisonous gas continued to loom over the most populous regions of the United States, rats began to outnumber people.
“So, your plan, Cas. Where should we hold up for the night?” Sam asked. It was already getting dark. They’d taken too much time that morning getting ready, and Dean could barely believe that the last twelve hours had taken place during the same day he was still barely standing in.
Cas was looking through the short, six-drawer chest across from the beds. Based on the look on his face, Dean figured he didn’t find what he was looking for.
“Cas.” Dean took a moment to take in his surroundings then got to his feet, a little less stable than he would have liked, and tried to get the taste of iron out of his mouth.
Cas looked down at their hands and then back up with his brows knitted together. “Dean?”

“But he’s not… He doesn’t
When he wasn’t checking in on Cas, he arranged the supplies in their freshly restocked kitchen, deciding to do it by flavour (veggies with veggies, fruit with fruit—beans here, soup there, pie filling taking up its own shelf). They even had a pretty well-stocked bar. Nothing fancy, and there wasn’t a lot of variety in choice (whiskey, rye, or bourbon?), but Dean was proud of it even if it did make him miss beer. But it was just grains, hops, yeast, and water, right? He decided to ask Cas about brewing their own batch when he was better.
,” he read, tapping at the page. “Dad would have only been, what, three or four?”
“Oh man. We need to get you more stuff.” Dean got up and grabbed him a pair of sweats and an old Kansas t-shirt from the drawer. “Try these for now,” he said as he tossed them over to Cas, who took a moment to look at the clothes before standing to change.
“You got a tat?” He almost felt stupid for not knowing.
“How is it blasphemy if our Father has abandoned us?” Afriel asked. She seemed sincere and finally pulled the ratty beret off her head. Dean winced at the clumps of hair that fell off with it.
Cas was standing by the passenger door of the Impala, looking restless and ready to go.
“Well, that was… something.” Sam turned away from the crumbling building with his hands on his hips.
“Can I help you?” Sam asked slowly. Dean hadn’t realized he was staring until he noticed Sam was staring right back.
“I want this— everything,” Cas panted into his ear, as he hooked his hands behind the bend of Dean’s knees and pulled him forward. Dean almost slid off the waxed finish of the car but Cas held him steady. He held his breath as Cas leaned over to kiss a path to the corner of his mouth, still pushing into the hot space between Dean’s legs and sending sparks up his spine.
There was a narrow shelf that ran the length of the wall above his bed, so he picked up a couple of his old knives and balanced them on the ledge, leaning them against the wall so they were on display and not just lying flat. Next to those he put a stake from one of his first hunts with John, and beside that, a shotgun that barely fired anymore but that he’d held onto for years. It was the one he had with him the first night he met Cas in a cascade of sparks—and he never really understood why he’d held onto it, but it looked right above his bed. Like it belonged.
But he believed her, or wanted to. As a rule, he avoided ganking witches and only considered it as a last resort when it was clear they couldn’t be saved. And even then, it was never an easy decision. Witches were human. Looked human. Monsters were always easier to kill when their outsides were as ugly as their insides.
But Cas was family, too. He’d proved it again and again—he’d left Heaven for Dean. Left during a civil war where who knows how many angels would die. It made what Dean said to him sit even heavier in his chest.
He could practically hear Sam drooling.
“It’s fine, Sam,” Cas answered. He sounded defeated—tired.
“Cas—” he didn’t know how many times he could start this apology without sounding like a complete asshole, although he was pretty sure it was too late for that.
I wonder if the hunters would still want you if they could see what you really are.”
They’d hidden them both but kept them parked outside other units, the ones that looked the most habitable, and had slapped up some slipshod siding to throw anyone following them off their trail. Sam and Cas had insisted on nailing down their escape routes and emergency protocols practically their second day at the park. All Dean knew was that they were either gonna be shooting at things or running like hell. He half-listened to the details.
The back of Dean’s throat was tightening at the smell. He would not puke in front of Cas. Not unless a crap ton of alcohol was involved, and definitely not over some rotten bread and vegetables. A memory tried to push its way into his consciousness, of John screaming at him for getting sick on the carpet of some cheap motel when he was ten. He’d had the flu, but he wasn’t sure if his fever or the shame of disappointing his dad burned hotter.
, he thinks,
“It sounds like Cas cares about you very much.”
Dean breathes, “Oh, shit.”
It starts strange, a bullet held in place with a leash like a dog. “My brothers kiss their bullet in a dark cul-de-sac,” Cas recites, his voice low and grainy and mountainous in Dean’s flatland home, “in front of the corner-store ice machine, in the passenger seat of their car, on a strobe-lighted dance floor. My brothers’ bullet kisses them back.”
The morning after, Dean needs new clothes, ‘cause he can’t wear Sam’s laundry for the rest of his life. He goes into their room — his room —
“Sam,” Bobby says. He’s stopped saying things like
“I do think he’d like open spaces,” Cas says, while Dean rolls his eyes behind him. “A desert would be fitting.”
“They were extremely evasive overall,” Cas admits. “They seemed to… they seemed to think I had an ‘in’ with the nephilim. That’s what they asked about, mostly. If he could fix things.”
Cas’s fingertip taps against his lip and Dean opens his eyes. “Do you want lube?”
“Cas,” Dean breathes, ‘cause he can’t ever look at him now without thinking of that spectacular and catastrophic kiss in that cabin and the wreck that followed, and Cas—
“Yes.” Cas kisses his shoulder, and says, “I want— I care about Jack. That’s what this is about. I care about him, and I want you to get along. I have faith in him.”
“Oh,” Cas says, at the end. At the part where they kiss. Where Thelma and Louise kiss and drive a car off a cliff. He turns to Dean. He says, “You compared us to them, once.”
“No,” Sam grits out, “you— don’t you ask me to tell you it’s okay. Don’t you do that to me.” Dean watches his hands grip the steering wheel, tighten and release like he needs something under his hands before he starts throwing punches.
Dean thinks about Dad. Thinks about the way he’d drive, always running from something, the way he’d put Dean in the passenger seat, look at him sidelong while Dean fucked around with his knife, his unloaded gun. The way he’d put on Bob Seger to cover Dean’s muteness. “I know what I looked like as a kid,” Dean says quietly. Sam flinches. He doesn’t remember it like Dean does. Dean knows full well what people saw when they looked at him, when they looked at his mouth and his eyes and the shape of his nose. They saw the same thing when he grew into his cheekbones, too. “I’m amazed he could stand to be in the same room as me,” Dean adds, half-laughing.
“I, uh.” Christ. Dean clears his throat, and pulls the blanket out from behind his back, the one he hasn’t had the guts to bring out until tonight. “Figured I’d maybe. It’s warm enough, y’know, might lie back, take it in.”
“Not much of a loss if he wasn’t,” Dean spits, and then sighs. “Fuck. I gotta call him a cab or somethin’, huh.”
“Right.” Dean nods, and sets the blanket down, a respectable three feet away from Cas’s feet. He lies back, trying to be nonchalant. Puts his hands behind his head.
“I— jeez, all right,” Dean mutters, flipping his burgers. He clears his throat. “I mean. Yeah, that’s— I will.”
Before Sam can call him out on it, Mom walks in.
But this — Bobby just hugs her, and Sam thinks, this is pretty nice, too. “All right,” he says. “You’re a girl, then?” And Sam nods into his chest. “All right. That’s all right.”
The bar is still and silent. Lindsay puts a glass down, slowly, at the other end of the bar. “You wanna head out, be my guest,” Dean says, reaching for his own gun as subtly as he can. “I ain’t keeping you here.”
And Dean whines, in the back of his throat, as Cas pushes in. Cas pushes past the first set of knuckles, and Dean moans, long and low. “Cas,” he breathes, whispers, “wait, I need—” and Cas waits patiently as Dean’s hands clench and unclench in the sheets, his chest cold from the sweat. “Oh God, it’s so— Cas, it’s so much—”
Cas catches him by the elbow before Dean can leave. “I found some basil growing in an abandoned lot a few miles down,” he says, handing Dean a bundle of leaves. “I assume someone must have planted it and— let it roam free, I suppose.”
“You don’t have to go.” Cas leans over him to put the book on his side table — hot, over him, his body like a curtain over Dean’s, and he’s— his hand through it all perfectly weighted on Dean’s neck, perfectly in control, like he doesn’t even need to think about it. Dean inhales sharp as Cas pulls back and then slides down the bed to rest his head on the pillow next to Dean.
to you.” He takes his thumb out of Dean’s mouth and leans down, kisses him hard— Dean groans into his mouth, takes it, lets Cas bite at him and press his tongue in, good God—  ”Can I unzip your pants,” Cas whispers.
“Woah,” Kaia says. “So is that— so do you have a gender?”
“I didn’t know you were married,” Amy says softly, and Dean looks away ‘cause. Fuck. Fuck. “What was his name?”
The poem — because that’s what it is, that’s what Cas is reading, Dean catches a glimpse of the cover that reads POSTCOLONIAL LOVE POEM from where he’s lying — moves on, outward, and Dean’s throat bobs as his eardrum vibrates with the echo of Cas reading
“My monument,” Cas replies, in that careful poetry-reading voice of his, right down inside of Dean’s bones, “my victory, my sunrise.”
“That’s idiotic,” Dean mutters on instinct. What does this place have? Shitty coffee, inedible breakfast. And twenty miles away, an empty cabin Cas preferred over coming home, to Dean. Maybe that’s what Cas owes this place for — a fresh start. He played it up like it was for Dean’s sake but now that Dean looks at him, yeah, he sees it. This place was a fresh start for a guy who had his millennia-long existence fucked by the Winchesters one too many times.
“I didn’t wanna lie to you anymore,” Dean tries again. He should’ve prepared notes. A tractor trundles in the field past Cas’s head, yard posts flicking past like cards in a deck. “Wasn’t fair to you, what I did.”
But Cas, whatever he is, isn’t stupid. And he certainly has never half-assed anything, which is admittedly kind of a problem sometimes. He steps in close— he says, “You asked.” He gets as close as he did the first day they met. Dean swallows. If he took a step forward they would be touching, but it’s all he can do not to shrink back.
Cas concludes:
“I know. I was there.” Claire blinks furiously at the gravel beyond their feet, and Dean shrinks, cowed. Easy for him to forget what happened to Claire’s family. What they did to Claire’s family.
“Methinks the lady doth protest too much,” Sam quotes, grinning, as he downs his coffee. Cas quirks an eyebrow, and Sam says, “Take a break, whatever. Excuse me for wanting to make sure you’re still alive.”
Sam shrugs. “Hey. You got a crush on the guy, can’t help bein’ a dumbass about it.”
Cas shrugs, shoulders shifting under Dean’s hand-me-down sweatshirt, tight across his chest. His eyes are very — attractive, in the light of the TV screen. In the sense that, if you were a person who was attracted to former-angels in male vessels, for example, you might think they were… striking. “I can’t possibly remember every plot point in every film, TV show, book, and other form of humanity’s cultural productions, Dean, not anymore. The human mind is limited.”
. And then he thinks — very deliberately —
One morning when Cas slides out of bed early and creaks out the door, Dean wakes up. “You goin’ out?”
Cas nudges his knee up between his thighs, a little, and Dean moans, head falling back to the pillow. “Cas,” he whispers, just that, and Cas slides his hand up from his heart to his mouth, thumbing over his lower lip.
“Do you want one?” Cas asks, nodding towards the oranges.
“Yeah, okay, fair enough,” Dean says. “So. Uh.”
. Only God knows why they put 48 in quotation marks, and not even he could tell you where the hell they got the nerve to claim that Lebanon has a downtown. This early the highway’s empty, just tractors pulling out of their barns in the distance while the sun struggles up from the dust. Cas doesn’t put any music on, and Dean doesn’t insist.
Cas’s hand comes up to the seat next to Dean’s shoulder, and Dean succumbs, finally twists in his seat, looks at Cas in the backseat — how hurt he is, that old pain furrowed in every part of him suddenly visible — and Dean thinks,
Hell. Dean’s up anyway, and Cas hates driving. “You want a ride?”
Before he has to make a decision, though, Cas’s hand tightens, just a bit, just enough for Cas to pull, and yeah Dean could resist but hell, why should he? So Dean lets Cas pull him in close, lets Cas roll them both over until Dean’s leaning on his forearms on either side of Cas’s head, looking down at him, at that face, at Cas looking at Dean the same way he looks at the stars. “Cas,” he whispers, leaning in until his forehead touches Cas’s. “What the hell are we doin’ here?”
“How is this any different from attempting to bait it with Dean?” Cas asks. It’s different because it’s Dean. Dean’s expendable. Arguably, Dean’s older than everybody here, if you’re only counting human years. He’s lived his life. “I’m going.”
Dean shrugs. “Said to quit askin’. Told him he didn’t wanna know.” He sniffs, hard. “Jesus. Last time— it’s a long story. Last time I said stuff like this, he was.” Dean looks past her, to the tile wall behind her, and then he starts crying, silently, right there in the kitchen. “He was twenty-three, first time he died. I remember lookin’ at him. His body. Right there on a mattress, ‘cause I couldn’t bring myself to bury ‘im. An’ he— an’ I said to him —”
“All right.”
“I’m sorry to hear that, Dean. That’s a lot of loss to go through all at once.”
Out back of Donnie’s there’s a dumpster and an ice machine and a small, private space between them, a corner perfect for a smoke set into the back of the bar. Dean doesn’t go there. Dean helps Donnie clean up, but he won’t take the trash out. When they’re short on hands and Donnie needs someone to go out back so’s he can fill up the ice trough, Dean lets him go out and does him a favor by staying at the bar to get folks their drinks.
After a bit of thinking time, he starts. “Sam was a great kid,” he says, slowly, like it’s the first time he’s saying it. “You woulda been so proud of him. He was quiet, too, never gave me too much grief when he was little.”
. “Sam?”
“Yeah, I get it,” Dean says quietly. Sam grins, and Dean smiles back, helpless to it, to the joy on Sam’s face that he hasn’t seen for years and years and years. “Good for you, man.”
. Not that Dean would know what to do with anything like that, so really, this is for the better.
Before he gets too in his head over it, though, Cas rolls over to smother him, full octopus mode. “I love you,” Cas murmurs.
Sam does it to rile him up, Dean knows, but it still— it works. Sam says, “Hey, been a while since you’ve been on a date, huh.”
“Got ‘em both back,” Dean croaks out, “but my— my mom— she.” Jack killed her and I couldn’t do a damn thing to stop it, and what I did after— it broke us. It broke our family. “She’s dead again. For real, this time.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas says earnestly. “I didn’t mean it like that.”
Eventually they make it to the Impala, quarter past, and Dean blows out a breath. “Where to, Cas?”
, at home and in the car and anywhere else too — but he can’t. He isn’t built for it. He’s got no clue what’s real and what’s an act and what he’s doing just to keep Cas around and what he’s doing just for fun and none of it is what Cas deserves, not really.
“I don’t want a bullet,” Dean whispers, and sits up in a sudden and desperate rush to take the gun out of his boot, stands up to put it in Cas’s drawer and he closes the drawer on it, stands there with his hand on the drawer handle, half a foot from Cas’s body. He turns to look down at Cas, his head tilted downward like Christ and Cas looking up at him like Mary Magdalene, and Dean thinks
“Nothin’,” Dean croaks out as his eyes flutter shut. He doesn’t move a muscle, in case Cas gets it in his head to stop petting his hair.
“What do you feel?” Cas asks. “Dean, what’s— what’s wrong?”
“We could help,” Sam says. “I could help.”
Cas nods silently, and Dean pushes further, palm catching on Cas’s skin until his fingertips hit the seam of his T-shirt sleeve. Dean curls his hand around Cas’s shoulder, fingers trailing under the shirt, inside and intimate. He exhales. “Cas—” he says, and then shakes his head. Suddenly, the back of his neck prickles with shame. What could there be to say, why ask for anything more when— when Dean’s fucked it up so many times by saying the wrong thing, when Cas is here now and that ought to be good enough for him—
“I need help,” Dean whispers into that room, shaking, his knee bouncing, sending Sam’s letter fluttering to the ground. He buries his face in his hands. “Cas, I need you,” he says, ‘cause Cas always makes things clear. Made things clear. Dean will never be half the man his dad was, and they all know that even his dad’s best wasn’t anywhere near good enough.
clogging up their living room and
“F’you say so,” Dean says, and stands there, thinking.
“That can’t be true,” Dean snorts, thinking about Cas’s face when Dean had stolen the last slice of pie out from under his nose yesterday, and Cas raises his eyebrow. Okay. Maybe Cas’s face had been a little fond, even then — and maybe Dean knows that
“Thank you. You too, Dean.”
Cas smiles, big and wide, and his profane hands slide up to Dean’s belt. “Can I?”
Eight months. Eight months you’ve been working here, and you’ve never even said his name. Dean says, throat dry, “Cas.”
He starts scrubbing his plate. Dean takes the hint. Dean leaves him there in the kitchen.
Sam pulls out his e-reader — Cas got him one, because they’re gift-giving buddies now, apparently — and squints at the screen while Dean tries to pretend everything is completely goddamn fine.
“Yeah, uh—” Dean stands up, thinking about it. He might as well get it over with. “Okay, yeah, sure, I’ll do that. Have fun in town.”
Anyway, Dean decides to write in a journal. He figures people recommend it for a reason, and he likes writing, likes putting words together. Not that he’s any good at it, but he mainlined enough fiction through his twenties to feel like he has a grasp on the basics, at least. And anyway no one else is gonna see this — and if they do, then Dean’s got a nice backup plan of heading straight into a vamp nest to let the Empty take him forever, that’s for damn sure.
Oh, fuck. Mary sits down and chugs half her water and wishes she had something stronger, but she wasn’t going to bring Dean to a liquor store on her way to leaving him. The one thing he asked was for her to stay, and she couldn’t do it. She just couldn’t do it.
or whatever is back from wherever the hell he went, and he lets Cas pick the movie after dinner.
Maybe that’s one of the pieces Sam was missing, that he didn’t realize was gone. Someone to look at him and say, it wasn’t right. You shouldn’t have been in that cage. You didn’t deserve to have Lucifer in you, and I see you, now that you’re free of him. And I’m glad for what I see.
He breathes out. He’s moving too fast. His heart is going lightning speed. “What would I wear?” he asks, which is a stupid question except he can’t think of anything that would tell people
“Mr. Shurley,” the secretary gasps, looking frantic. Ellen recognizes that look well. That’s the FBI-Agent-Bobby-Singer’s-in-the-lobby Look. “I’m so sorry to interrupt. We have an emergency.”
Cas is doing what he always does when Sam challenges him. Ignoring him. Pointedly.
Castiel doesn’t wait for Dean to answer. He slams the door forward, knocking into the guy’s head with a crack. The guard staggers backward, stumbling back out into the hallway and Cas follows him, seizing his shirt and dragging him back into the records room. Dean slams the door shut behind them. The guard’s fumbling for something at his belt—a
“Dean,” Cas interrupts, before Dean can think of a good enough retort. “Don’t cook. We should go out and celebrate. Let's go to lunch."
“Excuse you,” she scoffs. “That would be a law school student and
"Why not?" Cas frowns. "I haven't touched your car."
The guard snorts at that, strolling closer to lean on the wall behind them. “Always working, man. You know how it is.”
Jack, who is seemingly incapable of meeting someone and
A tiny, sad smile spreads across his face. He pulls his hand away. “Dean, you can’t just decide to start over.”
“Dean!” Someone shouts from a table off to the side. “Sam! Over here!”
Dean snorts. “Yeah. Just tell them a law school student, a nerd, and a high school dropout need some back up. They’ll be begging to come join the Dream Team.”
Then they look away from each other and spend the rest of the ride in silence.
Dean was the Grifter, but
“You know about it?”
It doesn’t make sense to Sam, but that’s not saying much. He’s never understood John Winchester. “What about signs of life? I’m assuming you can look up phone and credit card activity?”
how you would fuck the assbutts. I want details.”
Charlie’s fingers start tapping away at her keyboard and Sam flips to a blank page in his legal pad. Dean leans forward to pluck a chocolate croissant from the bag of pastries. All in a day’s work.
He barges out the door, flicking the lights on and off a few times for good measure before he slams it behind him. Dean collapses back onto his bed and tries not to puke.
. Sure enough, the next thing Dean says is: “You’re a softie. A big ol’
wouldn’t,” Dean says. He seems confused that he even has to tell Cas this, and Cas feels another puzzle piece of Dean Winchester click into place.
Dean knows what Sam’s thinking. It’s the same thing Dean was thinking the whole drive over here.
jumping off a roof,” he spits. “You’re insane.”
It looks so innocuous. It’s hard to believe that tiny entry ruined their family.
to be." He probably shouldn't have said it. There's nothing Sam hates more than trying to be controlled. But he looks so glum. If he needs an out, then Dean can sure as hell provide one.
“Yeah?”
He sneaks a glance at her to see if she’s giving him the
know Kevin?”
Dean holds up his glass. “Fuck those dickbags, man.”
The rest of the day moves in much the same manner. Cas pipes up with random information about Free Will Enterprises. Sam is totally in his element. Him and Bobby have been bickering over the best ways to fuck over Free Will for hours, which means whatever plan they end up with is going to be rock-solid. Ellen’s talking to Jack and Charlie, telling them stories of old jobs—like that time she conned her way into a royal wedding. Hilariously, Jack is taking notes, but Charlie is just staring at Ellen with some drool collecting at the corner of her mouth. Dean can practically hear the alarm bells of
“Yep,” Charlie grins. “Almost a year. I adopted him. There’s no way he’s getting rid of me now.”
He can't help it.
“Okay—that—” that
He doesn’t have faith in a lot of things, but he’s always had faith in Sammy. He watches Sammy’ face change from freaked to determined.
Dean grins and jumps out of the van, strolling down the street towards Free Will Enterprises. He wasn’t lying. He
. Friends don’t interrogate each other. Got it?”
Charlie makes an abortive move towards him. “Dean, wait—”
risk their butts. That job could have gone really bad, really fast. Sam really hopes whatever in the ledger is worth it.
Donnie tosses the phone onto the ground, about four feet away. He says, “I know you have a gun. Go nuts, if you want.”
Cas asks, “Dean?”
“Claire likes you a lot, you know,” Kaia says eventually.
“Sorry I freaked,” Dean says. She realizes it won’t help her to know. He’s here, now.
He takes the impala out to the middle of nowhere, solo. Drives thirty minutes across flat Kansas highways ‘til he gets somewhere so empty he can’t see a sign in either direction, and he pulls over, down a gravel road, ‘til it’s just him and his baby and the open sunlit sky.
“I think it’s a beautiful name.”
“Pray for queer men?” Cas’s brow furrows. “Dean, men — people — of all genders and sexualities have been involved in religion since… since time immemorial.”
Sam ditches the two of ‘em in the motel room, freezing from the AC. He hitches a ride back to Lebanon and just leaves them there with the car. Dean can’t even talk shit about it ‘cause yeah, if Dean had to deal with the crap Dean and Cas just put Sam through, he’d hightail it outta there ASAP.
There isn’t anything real inside of Dean, not anymore, but he’s good at putting on a show. He could make Cas so happy. He’d be so good at it. Isn’t that enough?
“Feels real good, Sammy.” And Dean thinks: it’ll feel good tomorrow, too, and the next day, and the next. And he’ll live to see it all.
“Yeah, you get to be— accountable, like everybody else, but you. You’re allowed to want things, man. People can tell you no, but you’re allowed to ask.”
“Only Cas can answer that one,” Sam says. But then his mouth crooks up and he says, “I think it will be, though.”
“Yeah, yeah, I hear you.” Dean hands Cas the last of the groceries — a bunch of spinach, which he’s forbidden Cas from discussing with Sam for fear of spending the next four decades slowly dying as Sam finds new and inventive ways of rephrasing
“But I.” His mouth is numb. He feels like the stupidest motherfucker on the planet. “I did it for you.”
By his fourth month back, Cas just moves into Dean’s room, pretty much. Dean walks into his room and there he is, lounging in his bare feet on the bed, book in hand, listening to Carly Rae Jepsen on Dean’s speakers.
Castiel can feel Dean by his right hand. Sam is controlled, but not tense, on his other side. And Mary, on the other side of Dean, tries, a hesitant smile in her voice: “Hi, Jack. It’s nice to meet you.”
“Huh? Oh, I—” Sam huffs. “I was gonna ask if— if you wanted to come down to Salina with me to, to pick up some stuff from the occult shop, get outta here for a while, y’know, get some— get some space. But. Maybe it’s better if I go by myself, let you two talk it out.”
