"I had always suspected it, but now that you’ve been given the opportunity—you're an admirable family man, Dean."
“Hey, sleepyhead—” Dean glares up at him at that, but with his hair mussed and fluffy from letting it dry while he slept, he looks more adorable than intimidating. “We’re leaving.” When Dean’s glare deepens at that, Castiel adds, “Didn’t you want to check out that burger place today that the receptionist recommended to us?”
It’s not even noon yet, but it’s a four hour drive back to the bunker and they’ve all been up all night. Jack falls asleep first, curled up against the window with his head pillowed on one of the blankets Dean keeps in the car. Eileen soon follows, safely tucked into Sam’s side.
For more days like today, where we can just all spend time together and have fun and no bad things happen." He huffs a breath of laughter. "Dean would say it's really corny, but I don't care."
He’s just taken out his phone and is about to send Dean a few heart emojis to make up for it when Sam asks his input about the particular black magic they are going to be facing. Putting his phone away again, he forces all thoughts of kissing from his mind to make way for more urgent matters.
There are still some sandwiches in the cooler. Dean makes grabby hands for them when Castiel brings them over and then immediately starts munching, his cheeks bulging like a chipmunk’s.
His own dick is throbbing with need, drooling precome along the crease of his thigh, but he denies himself for now, just focuses on Cas and lets the pleasure build. Cas's fingers dig into Dean’s hips every time Dean twists his wrist when he reaches the base, and he finally seems to remember that he does, in fact, have hands. Gripping Dean’s thigh with one, he fists the other into the short strands of hair at the back of Dean’s head, dragging him forward and into an open-mouthed kiss.
Confused at his outburst, Castiel takes a moment to gather his thoughts. “Well, they were two different species of two very different worlds. The bird would drown in the ocean and the fish suffocate on the land. There is a version of the story where the moon, hearing their cries, takes pity on them and lifts them up into the sky as binary stars—what you now know as Sirius A and Sirius B. In another version, the fish is so heartbroken it grows wings to join the bird in the sky, which was possibly used to explain the species of the so-called flying fish.”
Cas hesitated another moment, but then he sank into the recliner next to Dean with a sigh. "I suppose a few hours won't make much of a difference."
“They make it work,” he says, sounding almost angry. “Not all birds nest on trees, right? Maybe it can just make a nest on some small island. And there’s pools when the tide is low, right? They can hang out there.”
So maybe Dean shoved his recliner closer to Cas’s under the pretense of needing to be closer to share the popcorn bowl. And maybe he for real accidentally fell asleep with his head on Cas’s shoulder.
. What the fuck. They saw each other an hour ago. He can’t actually miss Cas already, or expect Cas to miss him. That’s dumb, it’s just… dumb.
Eileen smiles at him, weary but genuine, but then grimaces. “Heat is not my friend,” she says and signs, then presses the bottle against her neck and picks up the pamphlet again. Even her signing looks weary, her facial expressions a lot less animated than usual.
He’s shivering. It takes him a bit to realize it’s getting worse because he’s still in his wet clothes.
It's the fucking best. Dean's clean and warm and fed and doesn't have to do anything but cuddle with Cas and laugh at funny pictures of Sam.
The second snowman is more traditional, and Castiel immediately knows that it was Jack who made it. It’s about Jack’s height and wearing a black top hat that Castiel wonders where they got it from. Its smile is made from tiny black beans, it has an actual carrot for a nose, and one arm is raised in a friendly wave.
Sam leads them back the way they came, Dean and Cas making up the rear. Cas keeps a hand on Dean’s arm, ready to catch him every time he stumbles. Everyone’s quiet, flashlights pointed at their feet, focused on every step. Dean’s knees are seriously hating climbing down the steepest parts of the trail, the pain joining the pounding in his temples. The temperature is dropping and he’s starting to shiver despite the exertion.
He must have fallen asleep at some point. When he wakes, it's with a start, his heart in his throat. Sitting up so fast it makes him dizzy, he scrubs a hand over his face. When he fumbles for the bedside lamp with shaking fingers, he knocks his phone off the table. He squints at his alarm clock and, well, four hours are better than no hours.
Sometimes, the slimy, dirty feelings are still there. Dean never thought that simply having someone like Cas by his side, who knows about them and never pressures Dean to push through them, would be such a great relief.
“He?” Sam had asked, starting to look alarmed but still mostly like he was at a complete loss. “Michael? Of course he’s not coming back! What does that—”
His heart is already racing and it’s only bound to get worse. Dean’s body has realized by now that Cas has left them. The good-bad touches are gone, and even though Dean knows it’s irrational, his body is once again pretty damn sure that no one is ever going to touch them again. It doesn’t know whether to be relieved or terrified about that and the solution seems to be to make Dean feel like he’s dying.
Castiel stares out the window, sometimes grimacing at a particularly uncomfortable twinge in his chest as his grace is hard at work.
"I know you're not supposed to tell, but I think if I tell only you it'll be okay. When I blew out the candles on my cake to make a wish, I thought really hard that I wished for—for
Taking a sip of his beer to try and get rid of the lump in his throat, Dean attempts to focus on the movie. The last thing he remembers is some kind of action scene with cars, but now suddenly there's a tearful reunion between lovers. They're holding each other and then they’re kissing each other, and then suddenly Dean realizes he's halfway out of the room.
Cas was still there, a hand on Dean’s trembling back, but Dean hadn’t been able to hear him over the static in his ears and the sounds of his own distress. Then, finally, the weight of his blanket had settled around him, and he could calm down, could breathe again.
It doesn't have to mean anything, Castiel tells himself, trying to keep his worry and disappointment in check. Dean is likely just busy.
Cas is sitting on the edge of the bed, looking all amused. There’s a steaming plate on his knees and Dean doesn’t even care what it is or where Cas got it from, all he cares about is getting it in him. He sits up against the headboard and then makes grabby hands for his food.
Castiel nods but frowns, not understanding. What do their plans for Jack’s surprise birthday party have to do with this?
Used to the brothers ribbing each other, Castiel instead focuses on watching Jack play in the waves, splashing water at Eileen and getting splashed back, a wide smile on his face. Seeing his family in such good spirits is very precious to Castiel, so he pulls out his phone and snaps a picture. They’re probably too far away for it to really show much, but he wants to at least have tried.
when Dean realizes that he never got beer and snacks, which he always does. He’s not hungry or thirsty though. He kind of just wants to sit here with Cas. It’s the closest he can get to him.
" Dean points an accusing finger at Castiel, his agitation unmistakable in the way his disfluency worsens, "Said-d-d he'd
This time the smile Sam sends him is more encouraging than sad. “For now, get some rest. And then talk to him. Let him know that if he can’t be there, if it’s too much, no one will blame him. But I think it will be good for him to be there, so he can start associating that day with better things, happy memories.”
He’d still been sore all over when Sam and Cas finally admitted that they hadn’t found anything in their research that would explain what happened to Dean. Apparently, Dean was an unprecedented case—which, awesome. Just what they needed. They’d just lost a whole bunch of good people, thanks to Dean no less. Jack had maybe just lost most of his soul to fix it.
Castiel follows her gaze to where the frisbee game is still going strong. Jack has grass stains on his knees and Claire and Kaia are standing closer together than everyone else, exchanging shy glances and smiles.
They stay like that until Dean’s heart rate settles and he starts to shiver. Cas helps him out of his sweat-soaked tee and into a fresh one, and lets Dean fall into an exhausted slumber against him. When Dean wakes several hours later, his internal clock tells him it’s about noon, and his migraine has gotten bad enough to make him nauseous. He drifts in and out of sleep, and he tries to tell Cas that he doesn’t have to stay cooped up with Dean the entire day, but Cas isn’t having it. He fires up Dean’s laptop and cruises Netflix with Dean curled up beside him, and while he can’t do anything for Dean’s pain except knock him out when it gets too bad, it still helps Dean not to be alone while he suffers through the worst of it.
Cas and Eileen volunteer to divide the local shelters between them, and everyone piles out shortly after to catch some shut-eye. As soon as their door has closed with a click, Dean is about to sag against Cas and suggest an early night when Cas says, “I think I will go out for a while.”
Dean rubs the rag over his knuckles hard, even though he desperately wants to throw it away and scrub his hands clean.
Like now: Cas coaxing Dean's mouth open, gentle but insistent, one of his hands cupping Dean's cheek while the other is lightly gripping the short strands of hair at the back of his head, keeping him in place.
They didn’t even need to have worried about the things making a run for it because despite only coming up to about Dean’s chest, they show no fear, only relentless aggressiveness. Dean can barely even see what he’s fighting, glow sticks and flashlights only able to do so much. He tries to get a grip on the thing, but its furs slips through his fingers like water.  Deciding on a different attack, he lets it back him up against the wall of the mine, lets it come in close. Lets it think it’s won.
Dean hopes they can at least go back to being friends though. He thinks he can learn to be okay with that, but he can't be okay completely without Cas.
Dean might never be able to tell him why a simple plush toy—a comfort item—affected him that deeply, why he clearly wanted it and yet wouldn’t let himself have it, but that’s okay. All that matters to Castiel is that he’s discovered something new about Dean, that Dean has
Breath hitching, Dean manages to open his eyes. He’s greeted by the blurry sight of Cas, holding Dean’s hands and staring at him in concern.
Castiel takes a moment to thumb through the selfies. He supposes they did turn out funny and he likes how happy Dean looks just being silly. There is one though that gives him pause—he must have hit the shutter once without noticing while they were getting ready. In the picture, Castiel is frowning while Dean is looking at him instead of the camera. His smile is very soft and his eyes are warm. There’s a certain open vulnerability to his expression that Castiel has noticed Dean really only shows when they’re in private, when he feels safe.
Without meeting his eyes, Dean finally reaches over and takes Castiel’s hand in his. He draws it into his lap and squeezes it once and then just holds it. It’s the
Letting his head fall back against the headboard, Castiel closes his eyes as guilt starts to weigh on him. "I should have made him rest more. I
Jack orders a stew that smells delicious, but he's poking at it more than eating it. Dean makes the effort of swallowing before opening his mouth, because it's at times difficult enough to understand him with his stutter as it is. “Hey, k-kid, you okay?”
Right at this moment though, the sight of the clothes as Dean gets them out of the dresser only serves to irritate him further.
Dean picks at his nails as if his heart isn’t trying to punch itself out of his ribcage, as if he’s calm when actually his voice box aches like he’s been screaming.
Just like the night before, Dean lingers after Sam has gone to bed. Not as long though—his eyes are burning with fatigue, the stress of the last couple of weeks finally catching up with him. After washing the dishes, he dries his hands on a dishtowel and makes to duck out of the kitchen. Shoulders already curved around the growing hollow in his chest.
“You’re a dumbass,” Dean complains weakly, and then he tugs Castiel down and into a kiss. When they part, Dean adds, “And annoying,” and then reels him back in to kiss him again.
He expects Cas to be in the library, but he's not, so Dean goes to check the kitchen next. Except, when he gets close, he hears voices. It somehow hadn't even occurred to him that Sam might already be up as well.
Castiel wants to say that he can't rest while Dean's in pain, but he stops himself when he realizes that that would only cause Dean to feel guilty for his emotions. He can't think of what the right thing to say would be either though. His body aches all over and he just wants to lie back and close his eyes, but not like this.
This hurts too, how wrongfooted he feels. They're okay again, him and Cas, but how okay? The uncertainty has Dean stay quiet, has him keep his head down and pick at his nails.
Dean grumbles some more but eventually falls into a light doze almost against his will, soothed by Baby's comforting rumble and the weight of Cas's hand on his back. The other three finally take pity on him, keeping the radio on low and their conversation quiet.
That’s another thing Dean appreciates about the girl—unlike Sam, she knows how to eat. Though, ever since they started dating, Sam has loosened up a little. Maybe if Dean packs enough cookies, they’ll share. That’s romantic, right?
On the way to the store, Dean had complained about still feeling tired even after two cups of coffee, so Castiel got him a third one when they stopped for gas. Dean's delight quickly morphed into grumpiness when he discovered that, while he was now more awake, there were other consequences to drinking that much coffee in quick succession.
And then he’s running across the sand, almost giddy when he hears Cas's follow. Just as he’s splashing into the turf, arms come up around him, and Dean’s laughing when they crash together into the waves. He’s still smiling when he resurfaces, wiping water from his eyes. Cas is frowning at the ocean he’s in almost grumpily, like for some reason he didn’t expect to get soaking wet when he fell headfirst into it.
Scooting his chair closer, Castiel wraps his left arm around Dean’s back and puts his right hand over Dean’s. Dean swaps his last try out with another blank card.
Letting the others lead the way, Cas pushes Dean’s chair securely and at a leisurely pace. They get stopped shortly by someone complimenting the custom spoke guards Dean chose for today—they're his favorite because there’s a badass photo of Baby on them, perfectly fitting the black and silver design of his chair.
Dean's fingers clench in the rag. He has to force his hands to keep moving like there's nothing amiss; rubbing the rag over them and the dirt even deeper into his skin.
They’d somehow managed to wrap Dean’s present in a way that didn’t make it immediately obvious what it was. Dean had been joking about the size of it, but when the wrapping paper fell away, he abruptly fell silent.
, oh yes. He opens his mouth in invitation and Cas deepens the kiss, still a little clumsily but Dean doesn't need him to be an expert at this, he just needs
Dean would have rather gotten it over with now, but then again, he has no idea what to even tell Sam.
He gasps every time he breathes in and his cheeks are wet and he knows the despair he feels is stupid and senseless but he just can’t stop it. The
Dean swallows and resist the urge to lick his lips. He checks the time, and yep, they should really get a move on if they want to be punctual, which they do.
Dean searches his eyes, his own big and vulnerable. At least some of what Castiel is feeling must translate through the way he’s looking at Dean, because a flush appears on Dean’s cheeks. Shifting his stance, Dean turns his face away, blinking rapidly.
Castiel can hear them from the hallway already, Maggie and Jack laughing and Dean mock-complaining. The air is warmer and smells like cinnamon and vanilla.
It takes another long moment, but finally, Cas sighs, and shifts to sit up straighter against the headboard. He doesn’t let go of Dean’s hand, though. Instead, he draws it into his lap and puts his other hand on top of his and Dean’s, protective.
“If I l-l-let myself… I tend to get, y’know. C-c-c-clingy. I didn’t wanna fuck this,” he gestures between them, “up just ‘c-c-cause I want more th-than you’re comfortable w-w-w-with. I sh-should just b-be c-c-content. G-g-grateful.” Squeezing his eyes shut, he rubs his jaw. “A-a-a-a-and I know it’s d-d-dumb, b-but every t-t-time I think you’re g-gonna,” he gestures vaguely, “t-t-touch me, o-o-or k-kiss me, a-a-a-and then you d-d-don’t, it k-kinda hurts.” Making a fist with his free hand, Dean knocks it lightly against his chest to indicate where. His throat is getting tight, which is just so fucking pathetic.
Now, Dean’s  beside him with his sleep mask over his eyes while Castiel works on translating a complicated spell from Hebrew into English. Dean’s lying still and breathing evenly, his face turned away from the lamp on Castiel’s side, but it’s been over two hours and he’s still awake.
Dean usually hated it when people talked during movies—especially ones he considered art—but when he watched with Cas, he just couldn’t help pointing things out Cas might have missed and telling him all about the behind the scenes info and other trivia he knew. This time was no different, except that just as Dean was about to talk about the helicopter chase scene, he realized that Cas was watching him with a soft, almost amused look on his face.
Cas sets the glass down on the nightstand and then hesitates. He’s making that sad teddy bear face, and Dean already knows that whatever Cas asks, Dean’s going to have a tough time saying no.
The first and so far only time Jack has seen Dean have a seizure it disturbed him so deeply that they decided to try and keep him away whenever it happened. Last night, Cas and Eileen came to Dean’s help while Sam stayed with Jack. It’s not unusual for Jack to come seek Dean out after though.
" Cas says, and Dean can't help the way his shoulders hunch and his cheeks burn with shame, even though Cas sounds more concerned than scolding.
Picking up the movements of his hips again, Dean continues, breathing the words against Cas's mouth. “I l-l-like k-k-kissing. H-hand-h-h-holding. Just lotsa t-t-touching.” He sighs, leaning his forehead against Cas’s. “Just g-g-go with what f-f-feels good, I’mma t-t-tell you if I d-d-don’t d-d-dig it.”
He’s holding onto the plate so tightly his fingers hurt, but a few tears escape anyway. They leave burning hot trails down his cheeks, and his chest hurts so bad. Like someone made sure to break every single one of his ribs clean in two, and now the pieces are stabbing into all those hidden, vulnerable places that no one’s supposed to even lightly touch.
Dean can tell Jack’s gratitude is genuine, but he can also see the troubled waters underneath. But Dean hates it when people push him before he’s ready to talk, so he waits the kid out.
Swiping his hands up and down Dean’s back to spread the shower gel, Castiel starts to massage Dean’s neck and shoulders.
Dean had rubbed at his jaw and swallowed, shaking his head. In his mind, he could already see the frowns on Sam and Cas's faces as they struggled to understand what he was saying but tried, for his sake, to act like his voice was what it used to be instead of shattered and wrong. He could imagine the way their expressions would slip into disappointment after learning that there was yet another thing that would not be coming back. And he could feel already the pain of everyone inevitably turning away when they realized the changes were permanent, of them going on with their lives, Dean scrambling to keep up but ultimately left behind, alone, because he couldn’t be who they needed anymore.
When Jack opens Castiel's present, he's quiet for a long moment, fingers stroking reverently over the photos. Sam and Eileen got him a hunter's journal and a new Zelda game. When Jack opens Dean's present and reads the card, his brow furrows with confusion.
All the discomfort and stiffness from earlier is gone. It does sound appealing to just keep lying like this and enjoy the feeling of weightlessness.
Dean sighs and reaches out to rub the kid’s back between his shoulder blades. He lets him cry it out, then ducks his head to try and catch Jack’s bloodshot eyes.
Still, it’s not that bad. The beach is wide and sandy, and reasonably clean. The waves aren’t too big. It’s decidedly too warm in the direct sunlight though, and Dean looks around until he spots a low wall that gets some shade from the palm trees behind it. He points Jack in its direction.
"Yeah, wanna try?" Dean can see that Cas is about to refuse, so he picks up a cookie and holds it out to Cas with the best pleading look he can muster. "C’mon man, live a little."
"No, I did. It's really great when everyone is here. With Jody and Donna and the girls, I feel a little like I have four sisters and two aunts." His smile fades and Castiel leans closer, putting a hand on his shoulder.
When they arrive at the enclosure, Cas parks Dean’s chair beside the bench there and then sits down next to him.
Putting his boots back on, he makes his way to the kitchen. First order of business : fix their buggy stove so Dean can do what he does best—feed his family.
Punching his pillow, Dean shimmies down the bed and tries to find the most comfortable position to pass out in until Cas is back. After another ten minutes of trying and failing at that, he finally gives up and reaches for the throw pillows, building himself a little nest. He feels utterly ridiculous even thinking of it as that, but it’s not like anyone’s here to mock him for it. Yeah, that’s right—he’s alone, hating it, and therefore allowed to do whatever it takes to trick himself into thinking he’s not.
"I like to think that Kelly would be happy. Proud. Jack had such a rough start to life and when I was back from the Empty, I realized I had no idea how to raise him, how to make it better. But now..." He trails off, unable to find words for what he's feeling.
He finds the Epsom salt stashed under the sink, and also a handful of orange and cinnamon scented candles. When the tub is a quarter of the way full, he stops the water, unsure how long it will take him to coax Dean into the bathroom and unwilling to let all the water grow cold and sabotage his plan.
Cas draws out of the hug, his hands caressing down Dean's back and one coming to rest on his side. That would be nice on its own, if less nice than the hugging, but Cas is squinting up at Dean with worry again.
When they’re snuggled in tight, Dean tucks his head under Castiel’s chin and demands, “Tell me ‘bout th-the hunt. You guys save the d-d-day Ba-ba-batman a-a-and Robin style?”
“Cas?” he asks when they’re done, holding his hands up per Castiel’s instruction so the cream won’t be rubbed off again right away. He sounds so small, and when Castiel looks down at him from where he’s sitting, all of Dean’s protective walls are stripped away and what’s left is a tired, emotional, and vulnerable man. It's a side of him Castiel really only gets to see when they're in private, when it's just the two of them.
"Aww," Donna is saying, having walked up behind them without either of them noticing. "Young love." She puts a hand on her chest and sighs.
Dean thinks he should maybe be offended, but he's mostly just confused at the sudden change of topic.
in comfort. Sam and Cas kind of suck at it, and Jack’s their kid, so it’s up to Dean to teach all of them.
Dean’s pretty sure neither of them actually absorbs anything that’s happening on the screen. At some point, Cas draws Dean’s hand into his lap, strokes a thumb soothingly over the back of it, over Dean’s fingers. Dean shivers with it, his heart stutters. It feels so good. It feels so wrong.
By the time they make it to the kitchen, the others are already halfway through breakfast. Dean only eats a small portion of scrambled eggs but drinks a lot of coffee, which is completely unfair since he only lets Castiel have one mug but forces a PB&J sandwich on him. He still isn't talking, and completely ignores Sam and Eileen flirting across the table in between shooting Dean and Castiel worried looks.
Cas doesn’t meet his eyes when Dean looks at him, shifting on his feet as if embarrassed, a defensive look on his face. “I realize this sounds—sappy,” he says, sounding frustrated, like he can’t find the right words. “But I—”
“‘S-s-sap,” Dean complains weakly, though he’s smiling. He tries to shove at Castiel, but unfortunately—or fortunately—for him, that only results in Castiel remembering the raw and sore state of Dean’s hands.
Dean frowns at him. "Fuck yes I wanna see the ghost army! They're badass!" Surely none of them can argue with that, right?
Conversation carries on mostly without him while he stuffs his face, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t notice how the strain has gone out of Sam and Eileen’s interactions, their smiles genuine as they actually meet each other’s eyes again. Seeing Sammy happy makes Dean even happier, which means it’s totally an accident when he flicks a blueberry into Sam’s hair.
“Dean, what’s happening?” Cas sounds like he’s scared too. He’s reaching for Dean again, and even though Dean knows it will probably make everything worse, he lets himself fall into Cas’s arms. Cas rubs soothing hands over Dean’s trembling back through his tee, and it coaxes the sobs out of Dean that he was trying hard to hold back. It’s so humiliating, and he hadn’t meant to be such a burden, but now that the floodgates have started to open, Dean doesn’t know how to close them again. Tears make burning trails down his cheeks and his throat is on fire. The pain inside that he’d tried so hard to carry alone is pouring out of him.
a tight fit, but Dean doesn't seem to mind. Lying between Castiel's legs, Dean rests with his back against Castiel's chest and leans his head on his shoulder with a blissful sigh.
Dean knuckles at his eyes and squints. His brain feels like mush. It's definitely time to go night night, but Dean doesn't like it at all. It means he’ll have to leave.
And Dean was officially a fourteen year old kid with an embarrassing crush. More than that, he was being pathetic and selfish and dumb. Cas didn't—Cas couldn't—
While they talked, a couple of teenagers have set up a beach volleyball net and started playing. If Jack were a normal human kid, he’d be around their age. And what do you know, they’re short a player.
When he exits the bathroom, he’s red-faced and almost stumbles over his feet. His heart is pounding and he feels awkward and shy in a way he usually never feels about the prospect of sex.
do bad things. Manipulate people. Kill them. But if I still had them, I could find and eliminate the monster that is threatening Molly’s family before anyone else gets hurt. I was supposed to do so much,” and there’s tears choking his voice now. “I was supposed to—to rid the world of this kind of pain and suffering, and now I can’t do it. I can’t do it.”
“What about here, how is everyone?” Since the hunt hadn’t been particularly difficult, they hadn’t needed to call in for help. Castiel had tried calling Dean when he had the time and the privacy for it, but Dean had had a bad speech day at least two days in a row. It makes talking exhausting for him, aside from the fact that it can get difficult to understand him. Seeing as they can’t really text either—Dean loathes the voice from the screen reader and with his disfluency, the voice-to-text function is useless to him—Castiel has barely heard from Dean.
Dean's been avoiding asking for this, trying to bear the pain for as long as he is able. The feeling of Grace flooding into him, taking away control, just brings back too many bad memories. But he's past his limit now.
“As f-f-for prot-t-tecting people… th-there’s someth-th-thing I b-b-been meaning-g-g t-to t-t-talk with you ab-b-bout.” Dean takes a deep breath. “I’ve b-been th-th-thinking… next t-t-time th-there’s a h-h-heavy d-d-duty c-c-case l-l-like this one, we g-g-give it t-to someone e-e-else.”
Shuffling over to the sink, he scrubs his hands and face clean, and refuses to look at his bedhead and likely disgruntled expression.
Cas frowned at them with his I-am-confused-and-impatient frown that Dean maybe found kind of adorable. When it wasn't directed at him, that is.
After the gorgon smashed Dean’s head into the doorframe and Michael escaped, Dean had at first refused to let Cas heal his head wound. Dean was the one who’d let his guard down, and the painful throbbing in his temples was the least he deserved for that.
“I’m sorry, I—I have to go.” He rubs his forehead, frustrated with the situation and his own inability to find the right words. “It might be selfish of me, but please—please trust me on this, and stay home.”
“Cas, hey! Welcome back!” Sam hands one of the hunters, Stevie, a file from the pile in front of him, and offers Cas a gentle smile. Sam seems to have really settled into his role as the leader of the refugee hunters, and while Dean deliberately keeps himself to the sidelines, Castiel hasn’t missed the way Dean’s eyes shine with pride when he watches Sam.
Unshed tears of joy had been brimming on Dean's lower lids, and all Castiel had wanted was to comfort him, but he held himself back, knowing it wouldn't be welcome until later when they could have some privacy.
Cas, because he’s a dummy and super easy but also kind of awesome, instantly gets with the program and gives Dean a soft, gentle kiss. And then a second one when Dean immediately makes his displeasure known at the smooching being over too fast. So Dean likes being kissed, sue him. Cas still needs practice anyway.
Cas has thrown his phone on the bed and started a tickle attack upon Dean's sides. In-between his breathless laughter, Dean bats helplessly at Cas's hands, but tickling always makes his limbs weak as noodles and Cas is merciless. He has to cry uncle three times until Cas stops and even then he comes really close to peeing the bed.
If Jack had asked Dean about stuff like history or literature, he’d probably have pointed him to someone else, but math? Math Dean can do.
“Dean, it’s okay. I—” Castiel tries to reach for him but Dean shifts away and throws the blanket over Castiel’s legs. He fills a glass of water at the sink, slams it down on the nightstand, throws the TV remote on the bed and then storms out of the room.
Dean swallows what feels like acid reflux trying to claw up his throat, except it’s only air. He gives the kid a tight smile and an awkward wave that probably makes him look like a complete idiot. It doesn’t help that he’s in his robe while everyone else is already properly dressed.
“Uh.” Dean looks at Cas, but he doesn’t seem to know what’s going on either. “Sure, kid. What will I b-be d-d-doing, anyw-w-way?” Dean can’t exactly do the FBI thing anymore, except as eyes and ears only while Sam or Cas do all the talking. Dean doesn’t miss talking to cops, most of them are fucking assholes, but he does miss the opportunity to wear his suits and play pretend. And then, he simply doesn’t do well with feeling useless.
Dean presses the button that makes the screen light up and is met by a picture of himself in one of the armchairs in his Cave. He thinks it’s from when he’d just gotten back and was finally steady and aware enough again to actually do stuff with his family. He’s bundled up in a hoodie and a blanket and he looks kind of gaunt under them, his cheeks pale, dark circles under his eyes. The light of the TV is falling onto him, a still mostly full popcorn bowl is balanced precariously in his lap, and he’s asleep. His Stetson is sitting atop the backrest, so it must have been cowboy night.
Getting dressed in the morning is hard because after a seizure it takes a long time for him to stop feeling so drained, but Dean manages. Now, he is carefully pouring coffee into his thermos. It’s only five am, but then again Dean went to bed at like nine last night. And the dreams he woke up from—dreams that seemed to have crawled straight out of the old memory hole—made him not want to even try and sleep more.
Castiel dreads the answer, but still needs to know, "You said it isn't that bad, but how bad is it?"
Castiel helps Dean write his name at the bottom, and then they’re done. The end result is still quite wobbly, with the letters much bigger than Dean used to write them, but it’s readable.
Like a switch getting flipped, the way the kid clings to Dean activates whatever caretaking abilities are buried within him. His muscles relax, his heart beat becomes steady. His arms come up around Jack and hold him close; one hand rubbing over the kid’s back and the other cupping the back of his head.
Sam comes back from the bathroom with a glass of water. He hands it to Dean and then sits back down opposite him. Dean's hands aren't shaking so bad anymore and he drinks a few mouthfuls before he presses the glass to his temple and closes his eyes again. “Th-thanks. W-w-what t-t-t-time's it?”
—please don’t suffer in silence like this. It—you deserve to have your needs taken care of. They’re not a burden. Please try to believe that.”
Dean stares at the closed door and then lets his head thud against the wall he's been sitting up against. Great. This is just... great.
Cas clutches at Dean’s shoulders when he comes, groaning, and the feeling of him releasing wet and hot between Dean’s legs is almost enough to make Dean come too. He’s cresting, pleasure built up almost as high as it can go, but not quite there yet, whining and shifting restlessly while Cas shudders through the aftershocks, panting into Dean’s hair.
his responsibility. But that part has gotten more and more cracks over the years. Except, maybe, for the part that will always be ready to do everything to keep his little brother safe. He doesn’t think that’s ever going to change.
Dean also realizes that they forgot welcome-back kisses yesterday, and is about to remedy that immediately when he draws back and makes a face. “Brush t-t-teeth first. And pee.”
"Already ate 'em." Dean tries to look innocent, but the moment he says it he realizes what a stupid lie it is—they haven't even started eating yet because they were waiting for Cas. If that's not enough, Dean somehow forgot that he's surrounded by tattle-tales.
Dean ignores him. He turns the TV volume down and then Castiel can hear the cap of the massage oil open.
Dean shuts off the TV that Castiel hadn’t even realized was still on. Then the mattress dips again as Dean lies down, apparently intending to take a nap himself. Castiel means to turn around and thank him for his help, but he has barely formed the thought before he drifts off.
Dean goes through his nighttime routine and when he’s lying down in bed, he tugs at Castiel’s sleeve. Shedding most of his layers, Castiel slides down beside Dean under the covers. He finds Dean's hand, stroking over his knuckles until he's asleep.
Jack has turned around and is leaning over the front bench, watching them with open amusement. “You weren't kidding about him being a bear. A huggy bear!”
Slowly, they work their way through each individual letter. It’s obvious that whatever Dean’s brain is showing him has little to do with what’s on the page he’s trying to copy from, and Castiel has to gently and patiently course correct his hand on every single stroke, guide him into where to move the pen and when to stop. Dutifully, he pretends not to notice the frustrated tears that drip onto the desk.
“Um.” Unprepared for this turn of events, Castiel has to reorient his thoughts. “Eileen has mentioned that she wants to watch
The next thing he knows, he’s on his back on the bed where he woke up with Cas beside him this morning, but before he can complain about the sudden, definitely too big distance between them, Cas is closing it, and then nothing matters except the next kiss, and the next, and the one after.
The light makes him blink for a moment until his eyes adjust, and then he cringes. His eyes are red from crying and despite all the sleep he got, there are dark circles under them. Very thoroughly, he brushes his teeth and washes his face. The stubble makes him look worse than he feels, so he shaves it off.
swallow wrong and send himself coughing, but enough so that he savors the way Cas pats his back after he's done saying his I-told-you-so’s.
"Oh, he d-d-doesn't rec-c-call," Dean sneers while they move to the end of the queue. "Do you know how long I I-l-looked for you? Th-th-the things I saw?" He shudders dramatically and makes a face. "I th-th-think I saw some guy dressed as a c-c-cow pour milk in his—ugh, let's not t-t-talk about it."
“Sure. You go grab the k-k-kid, I’m gonna get r-r-rid of th-this.” Dean holds up the empty juice cups, then stands to bring them to the trash.
He’s decidedly grumpy when Cas comes back and wakes him and drains the nice hot water out of the tub. Dean’s too tired to complain so he just scowls while Cas helps him douse off the soap and towel himself dry. He gets him a fresh tee and underwear—at the rate Dean’s going through tees he’s going to have to swing by a laundromat soon—and then Dean falls headfirst back into bed.
“Yeah, I talked with him already, think he's packing a bag now. Hey, are you really not gonna eat that?”
Sam nods, probably having expected that answer. The tremble in Dean’s hands might not be visible right now with how thoroughly he’s wrapped up in thick winter clothes, but it’s impossible to miss how much his recent episode has drained him. This morning was the first time in two days that he's been able to leave their room for longer than trips to the bathroom, and he's still unsteady on his feet and sensitive to light and noise.
Dean’s face doesn’t have any business growing that hot in reaction, so he hides it against Cas's stomach.
Some indeterminate amount of time later, Dean becomes aware of Cas's voice. "Dean? Dean, can you hear me?"
Cas swipes to the next one and that one gives Dean pause because—hey, that's him! And he didn't know Cas took it!
Flabbergasted, Sam looks at the cookie in his hands, then at the other ones on the baking sheet, and then he groans when he realizes what exactly he is holding. "What the fuck, Dean? Ugh, what are you, five?"
Dean searches her eyes. He sees nothing but sincerity and compassion. Still, he spooks. Keeping his gaze on the soup he’s stirring, he shrugs one shoulder.
Cas looks down at Dean and then at the picture again. "I thought we could make one just for us. A private one. And I don't mean just for pictures involving nudity. For instance, I don't need our entire family to see the photos you took when you made me try on that brown hoodie with the bear ears."
“It sounds terrifying,” Cas says, his voice rumbling in his chest where Dean's ear is pressed against it. Jack and Sam argue something back, but Dean barely registers half of it, finally drifting off.
Dean sucks in a breath. “Please stop asking. I get it, okay?” Sam has fallen silent. Dean turns his head away and rapidly blinks his eyes. “I’ll be more careful. I promise. But I can’t—”
On the one hand, Castiel can see Dean’s point of not wanting to become dependent on him, and Castiel would never disrespect Dean’s bodily autonomy. But while it was already hard to watch Dean suffer, it is even harder now to be expected to stand helplessly by instead of taking action.
Cas is watching him, looking like he’s trying really hard to understand. “How do you feel, Dean?” He asks, gently.
"Oh, you, um—" Cas quickly turns around while Dean scrambles for a blanket to cover himself. It's so fucking awkward, and Cas is just standing there with his back to Dean, somehow even more flustered than him. "I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to—I was just—I swear, I didn't see anything."
, which is horrible. Dean’s certain he didn’t put any juice in his backpack, which means Cas must have smuggled that in there, like a—like a smuggler.
“Nothing happened. Everyone was exceptionally kind to us. It was just—being confronted with all that sadness? That despair? All those people in front of the shelters, desperate for safety, for answers, receiving neither. It just made me feel angry, and then helpless. They’re starving while there is enough food, and they’ve become victims of monsters they would be safe from if only given a roof over their heads and a door to close. It made me—well, it made me really really mad.”
The diner Molly ask them to meet her in is in walking distance of the beach, crammed between a Subway and a dry cleaner’s. The windows are dusty, the red leather seats soft and worn with use, and there’s a jukebox installed in each booth. Dean immediately feels at ease.
“Can I help?” She asks. “Charlie has found some kind of obscure artifact and Sam and Cas are geeking out over it. I think they didn’t even notice when I left,” she adds with an affectionate eye-roll.
"How are you holding up?" She asks, leaning forward and resting her arms on the back of the front seat.
Jack stares at him, and the next thing Dean knows the kid is clinging to him, pressing his snotty face into Dean’s shoulder.
Dean closes his eyes. He’s dead tired but he can already tell he won’t fall asleep easy. His body is aching inside and out and Cas is so close. If Dean asked to be held—to be comforted, to be soothed—then Cas would do it, no questions asked. But Dean is Dean, and Dean is a coward. And weak. He can barely hold back the
Dean manages a nod, and Castiel leans down and kisses him. Like he didn’t even know himself how much he’s been needing this, Dean sucks in a breath through his nose and leans up into the intimate touch, eyes fluttering shut.
Dean wants to reach out and put a comforting hand on her arm, but he’s pretty sure she wouldn’t be okay with that. “We’re gonna d-d-d-do everything we can to s-s-s-s-stop whatever is doing th-this,” he says, voice pitched low. “I promise.”
He expected Dean to already have fallen asleep, but instead Dean’s lying awake and looking up at him tiredly when he opens the door. One of the lamps on the nightstand is still on, and Dean looks all kinds of soft and inviting in the warm glow.
Panting heavily and sagging against the rough stone, Dean’s heart almost sets out when, in the flickering, dim light, he sees one of the things climbing up the wall and making to attack Sam from behind while he’s locked in a fight with one of its siblings. Before he can even yell a warning, Eileen has already noticed the danger, is dragging the thing back down by its leg.
Dean has other ideas. After rummaging through their nightstand for the massage oil, he motions for him to take off his shirt and lie down on his stomach.
Dean reaches up to check, only he’s still got his oven mitts on and only succeeds in almost poking himself in the eye with them. Sam snort-laughs and Dean chucks one of the mitts at him. Ducking out of the way, Sam is almost out of the kitchen when Dean remembers— “What the fuck are you even doing here, don’t you have a date?”
A sharp stab of pain through his head is what wakes him an indefinite amount of time later, abruptly, making his guts churn with nausea and his mouth flood with saliva. With a groan, Dean tries to move, but he's sluggish and disoriented. He clumsily pushes himself off of Cas's chest, not daring to open his eyes, it hurts that bad.
He hasn't had to do that since him and Cas became, well, him and Cas, because Cas is there often enough when Dean falls asleep. Cas is worlds better than a hot water bottle. And Cas seems content with what they have, because he's not like Dean.
Castiel contemplates following them, but then he thinks that Dean has had the right instinct with reducing the level of attention.
Something is hitting Dean's chest. There's a burn inside him like fire and his throat is blocked. There's weird distorted noises like someone yelling at Dean underwater, yelling at him from far away.
Jody finally succeeds in bullying Dean into letting her take over at the grill. Dean complains about it right up until he has a full plate in front of him, and then he doesn't seem to have any interest in anything except feeding himself.
“You enjoyed being called my husband,” Cas says at length, hesitant like he’s trying to parse out what exactly they’re even talking about. Dean’s stupid heart still skips a beat as hearing Cas say
There’s a thud as Cas lets his head fall back against the wall, most likely accompanied by yet another eyeroll, because Cas is dramatic like that.
He scoots forward in the tub, and Castiel eyes the space behind him hesitantly. "I might be too big to fit in there," he cautions, which, inexplicably, makes Dean huff out a breath of laughter.
Castiel is about to speak up, even though he is not sure how to say this without hurting Jack’s feelings, when he notices Dean watching him. Has he been doing that this entire time and Castiel only now noticed? He frowns at Dean in confusion.
Dean sniffs and turns his face away, rapidly blinking his eyes as if to try and get rid of the moisture there.
Silence stretches for a moment. When Sam starts talking again, his voice is gentle, sympathetic. “Do you think you can talk with Cas about it instead?”
Cas walks with Jack on the way back to their cars, listening while the kid talks animatedly about volleyball and the new friends he’s made. Eileen is quiet and doesn’t seem to be in the mood to talk—not that Dean can really talk to her without Cas’s or Sam’s help anymore—so Dean leaves her be. He spaces out for a while, the heat and the abundance of people getting to him too, until they’re at Eileen’s car and Jack tells Cas, “Oh, I didn’t know what else to say, so I said Dean’s my dad’s husband. I hope that was okay? I can say something else the next time if you’d prefer a different term.”
Cas is so earnest and apologetic about it that now guilt joins the shame party that's making Dean's guts feel heavy and sour.
“I said… I said I need time but. I lied.” Dean’s voice is a croak. It doesn’t even sound like him, but his cheeks heat with humiliation anyway. “Every time we—and then you leave. This happens.”
“You know y-you c-c-could k-k-kill a man w-with th-those b-b-babies, right?” He asks, briefly clenching his legs around Cas's thighs.
“Food l-l-later. Sleep now,” he announces, kicking off his boots and snuggling right in. Then he reaches up, eyes already closed, and tucks at Cas's pants leg until he sits down next to him on the edge of the bed. “Stay until I’m asl-l-leep?” He asks, nudging his pillow with his head until it’s shaped around him the way he likes.
“Dean, we can’t,” Cas tried to reason with him. “If we kept going, it would have killed you. I think we got most of it and the rest will fade over time.”
A deep frown on his face, Dean's scrubbing the grill grate. The skin of his hands looks red and raw, his fingers are visibly trembling, and he blinks every few seconds like it's getting hard to focus on what he's doing.
Dean sighs when Castiel starts petting his fingers through the strands. Fumbling for Castiel’s other hand, he starts playing with his fingers.
Dean drifts for a little bit, forcing himself to concentrate on the feeling of Cas's hands on his face, on the soft puffs of breath hitting Dean’s mouth, instead of the shame and self-loathing that keep trying to bubble up. It’s okay; Cas understands, Cas doesn’t judge him, Cas is glad Dean told him. It’s okay. Dean’s allowed to feel this way, he didn’t do anything wrong. He’s not a burden. It’s
He finds Dean in their room, curled up on Castiel's side of the bed and engaged in an angry staring contest with the wall. The cookie cutters are nowhere to be seen.
Cas makes that grumpy teddy bear face and sighs, but he does accept the cookie. Their fingers brush a little. Cas takes a bite and chews and Dean’s heart soars.
“Hey,” Sam greets him, only looking up briefly and then going right back to scrolling. If he's that engrossed, it's either a case or serial killer stats. Dean suppresses a shudder to avoid spilling coffee on the counter he scrubbed clean only yesterday.
“Of course, Dean. Get some rest!” She lets go of him and leaves. Dean is relieved and disappointed at once. If his head wasn’t hurting already, he’d really have liked to punch himself in the face for being so embarrassing and stupid.
“Yeah,” Dean answers, absently.  Eileen seems to have grown tired of fanning herself, so Dean picks up the pamphlet and takes over for her. She shoots him a grateful look, but all Dean can think of is that it should be Sam doing this.
“Dean—” he tries as Dean settles him on the bed and starts tugging at Castiel’s laces. Dean doesn’t react, his head ducked down and shoulders rigid. His jaw is clenched so tight his teeth must hurt, and his lower lids are brimming with tears. Castiel can feel his own throat close up at the sight. After taking off Castiel’s shoes, Dean then helps him out of his trenchcoat and blazer.
"Cas, you okay?" It seems to have been a rhetorical question, because Sam adds, "Look, you've been going nonstop. Why don't you take a break for a bit. Call Dean. He's worried."
Dean doesn’t have a problem with dogs as long as they’re friendly, but hearing the angry barking and growling while not
Dean looks around for a moment, and he can’t even remember the last time he really cooked in here, for more than just Sam and himself.
"I want to read," Castiel complains grumpily, but Dean ignores him. With a put-upon sigh, Castiel takes off everything except for his underwear and then lies down next to him on his side.
Cas’s shoulders slump. “I’m sorry, Dean, I should have realized.” He sounds contrite, and Dean is quick to shake his head.
Jack briefly returns to bring back the water ball and retrieve his snorkeling gear. He’s dripping wet, his hair is standing up wildly where it had started to dry again, and he seems to be enjoying himself greatly. He waves at Castiel and then runs back to the ocean.
Sudden knocking makes him jump. Turning his head, he sees Mary outside the car. She looks apologetic but also like whatever they need his input with can’t wait.
Sam is speaking quietly so as not to wake Jack. Castiel meets his eyes in the rearview mirror and nods.
He's surrounded by books and busy taking notes when he realizes that it's been hours since Dean left to take the laundry out of the dryer. He tries to tell himself that Dean just got distracted by something else, but when Sam comes to find him a while later, Castiel can already tell from his expression that something is up.
Castiel steps up to him and draws him into a hug, rubs his back. “Happy Birthday, Jack.” His own eyes feel hot but he’s smiling, overcome with joy. Jack clings to him for a moment before letting go and searching his eyes.
Rolling his eyes, Dean leans into where Cas is still caressing his back with his stupid big hand. While the wheelchair is one of the most comfortable ones money—well, stolen money from rigged credit cards—could buy, Dean is maybe possibly getting a
They’ve just returned from shopping and Sam is helping them stow everything away. “What took you guys so long?” he asks, though he sounds more amused than annoyed. “Dean flirt with Betty again?”
Sam continues, “Look, something’s been going on with you for weeks, but I didn’t think it was this serious. When you came to me and asked if we could postpone the beach thing, I thought it was just that. That you just needed some downtime. But obviously it was something else, something that led to
When he shuffles over to his sink, he makes the mistake of looking into the mirror. His eyelashes and cheeks are crusty with dried tears. Cringing away from his reflection, Dean bends down and throws cold water on his face until the evidence of his weakness is gone.
He gets roped into conversation for a while, especially when Jack and the girls come over and everyone starts in on the food. It’s nice—Jack has lost his shyness and there is a lot of laughter all around—but finally, Castiel grabs two beers and wanders over to the grill.
Cas is thumbing through a file, and he's surrounded by several piles of books. He looks up as Dean comes in and smiles at him in that soft, dorky way of his. Like he's happy to see Dean.
Sucking in a breath, Dean takes a step back, dislodging Cas's hand. The touch is gone and he wants to scream. To cry.
Bent over the open hood, his hands greasy and busy, Dean bites back his irritation and just keeps going. He’s pretty sure he knows what’s wrong—with the truck at least. After another minute of Cal hovering from a safe distance away like he thinks Dean’s either going to collapse or explode, Dean puts everything back into place and then motions for him to turn the key.
Straightening, Castiel announces that he will have to come back later to decorate cookies after all. Jack promises to put some aside for him, and then Castiel ducks out of the kitchen.
“You’re the only one I like,” Dean says and signs before accepting his strawberry and vanilla swirl. When Eileen looks at him questioningly, Dean signs,
Sam and Eileen make dinner—brown rice and a stir-fry with far too many vegetables in it for Dean’s taste. He eats as much of it as can manage though. As weird as it feels not to be the one cooking, he can appreciate the gesture and the help. He’d have been far too drained to cook, especially for all three of them.
“Nice, but you know how it is,” Dean puts his hand on his heart and flutters his eye-lashes. “I could never stay away from you for long.”
Dean finally rolls onto his back and glares at the ceiling. He checks his phone, then chucks it to the side with a sneer of disgust at himself. He’s being pathetic and needy and stupid. Cas has gotten a lot more careful with himself. He’s told Dean that he knows now he belongs to them, knows his own worth. And he also knows it would tear Dean to shreds if he lost him. Cas will be careful, and he’s going to be back before Dean knows it. Which would happen a hell of a lot faster if Dean would stop being stupid and go the fuck to sleep.
In record time, he got a bowl of popcorn ready, and two mugs of hot chocolate. Usually he'd go for beer, but—when Cas had tried hot chocolate the last time he was home, he'd said he'd liked it, and especially the tiny marshmallows Dean had put on top. So maybe the treat would make Cas happy enough he'd forget about the stupid research and stay with Dean.
Dean didn’t really have a plan for today except maybe making Cas try out the hot tub with him. The others seem good with just lazing around for another day, not exactly eager to cram themselves in the car for the long ride back. Dean knows he’s going to miss his room and his home soon, but this feels like the long-earned vacation he’d never actually believed they’d get. Sure, Ocean Beach ain’t Hawaii, but they should be able to find a nice enough spot.
“There’s still a lot of trust we need to rebuild. I understand why you’d be wary about sharing this. But, Dean,
Taking stock for a moment, Dean concludes that his head is a lot better and while he’s still exhausted, he at least doesn’t feel like he got run over by a tank any longer.
Dean can’t make himself leave though. Maybe it’s selfish—and stupid; he’s exhausted and could use the sleep. But Cas hasn’t left his side in hours, and Dean’s a greedy creature. Even when they’re right next to each other like this there’s an ache. Like Dean is still missing Cas. Like it just ain’t close enough.
Dean's about to counter that he let the kid choose who to bunk with when it clicks with him what Sam's actually getting at.
The drive home is mostly silent. Eileen chats with Dean about off-topic stuff but he’s too tired to talk much and just wants to get the inevitable fight with Sam over with.
They stare at each other for another drawn-out, awkward moment until Dean manages to break away, face on fire, and struggle out of the blanket tangled around his legs.
“This won’t help,” Castiel proclaims even as he does as Dean’s suggested, taking his shirt off and lying down. “I need to move. I feel much better already.”
Despite his own words, they’ve barely stepped out the diner when Dean changes his mind. “You know what? The oth-thers are gonna be a wh-while. Let’s go hang-g-g-g out at th-the beach while we w-w-w-wait.”
Jaw clenched and shoulders rigid, Dean waits until he can't hear Sam's footsteps anymore. It takes him an additional couple seconds to get his feet moving, and then he walks around Baby and picks up the plate.
It was in him, it was alien and it was evil, and Dean couldn’t bear the thought of it living on under his skin. He tried to swing his legs off the bed but was still weak as a kitten and Sam and Cas held him back easy.
He keeps himself awake until he absolutely can’t keep his eyes open anymore. Then he lies alone in his bed in the dark, and the
His previously relaxed expression morphing into a glare, Sam strides over to them. "What the fuck are those snowmen, Dean? Why do you always have to embarrass me?"
Dean had been in the library, standing in front of a shelf and staring at the rows of lore books in utter frustration, when he suddenly realized he was smelling flowers. Turning around in confusion to try and locate where it was coming from, he started feeling strange, like he wasn't all the way inside his body anymore. By the time he remembered that he’d felt like this before, it was too late.
There’s that urge, immediately, to shy away and say something self-deprecating. Dean fights it down and Cas squeezes his hand, like he’s able to sense Dean’s internal struggle, or at least how much the words are affecting him.
"Th-th-they fou-fou-fought d-d-dirty," Dean complains, though he sounds more proud than annoyed. Then he nudges Castiel's shoulder and winks at him. "You w-w-wanna stay here a-a-and help me ha-ha-handle these pricks?"
The three of them are busy the rest of the day—there’s hunter network stuff to take care of, emails to read and answer, phone calls to make. Dean tackles the immense pile of laundry that no one’s had time for in weeks. He takes stock of what’s in the fridge and writes a shopping list.
Sam rolls his eyes and puts the casserole dish he's just finished drying back under the kitchen island. "You just wanna see the ghost army."
"Right n-n-now we got ev-v-veryone in one pl-l-lace for once," Dean argues. "That won't l-l-last. This cra-a-ap show c-c-could take days. If you guys w-w-wait any longer t-t-to have C-C-Christmas, it's gonna be the next ye-ye-year." Castiel can see Dean’s throat muscles jump from the over-exertion. He shouldn’t be talking this much.
Then one day he’d been sitting in the kitchen, shivering despite his three blankets and oversized hoodie. Sam brought him hot chocolate, and Dean heard himself say, “Th-thanks, um, S-S-S-Sam-m-my.”
"Uh, yeah, no, that’s, um." Overwhelmed, Dean stammers and stumbles over his words in a completely mortifying manner until he finally tries to save himself with "You're just easily impressed."
“I’m really happy for you, Dean,” he says, and Dean just nods. There’s a ping as Sam receives an email, and he goes back to whatever he was doing with his laptop and his files, and Dean realizes he has ripped another stripe off the label without noticing.
Dean straightens a little and rolls his eyes at him, though he's still smiling. "Hello t-t-to you too, C-C-Cas. And hu-hu-hush, th-th-there are kids in the room."
Dean risks another look, and while the adoration in Cas's eyes would make him shy away for sure if they were face to face, now Dean lets himself smile in return. Screw it, right? Sam and Jack are both asleep, and even if they weren't, they wouldn't know what this is about anyway.
It’s during one of those times that Dean is sleeping beside him while some rerun of a sitcom is playing that Castiel realizes how little they’ve touched over the last two days.
Slowly, the tears ebb. But Dean’s body is starting to become aware that they’re being held and caressed and Dean can feel
Either it’s the sixth of the things or there was another one lurking nearby they didn’t notice. It keeps crowding into him, trying to separate him from the others. The further away he gets from the others, the darker it becomes, and the more advantage the thing gains. Weighing the bastard’s intelligence and speed versus its inexperience and bloodlust, Dean feigns a stumble, goes down on one knee, then rams his knife into its chest when it lunges and cuts upward until he pierces the heart.
Dean's trying not to cling, but—he's definitely holding onto Cas tighter than Cas is holding onto him. It's stupid and selfish but it hurts. It
Castiel had of course offered to put Dean to sleep with his grace right away, but Dean had refused. Ever since the “incident” where Castiel had misjudged a cursed object and ended up basically powerless for several days, Dean’s been insisting on self-reliance more and more. It hasn’t led to a full out fight—yet—but certainly to many arguments.
Castiel turns off the lights. He expects Dean to roll onto his side so he can be the “little spoon” and have his face be hidden. Instead, Dean pillows his head on Castiel’s belly and then gropes around until he finds his hand and holds it. Then he sighs, rubs his cheek against Castiel t-shirt and closes his eyes, the tension finally going out of him.
Even though they definitely need the assistance of every single hunter that came with them, Castiel is immensely grateful that Dean had offered to stay behind with Jack. In this extreme frenzy, Castiel doubts any of them would have been able to keep an eye on Jack, and the high-stress level of the situation would very likely have had negatively affected Dean’s health.
Sam looks deeply disturbed, while Mary and Eileen are leaning on each other and giggling. Eileen signs something to Mary that Castiel doesn’t catch and then both of them are laughing so hard they have to sit down in the snow, smiles wide and radiant.
Clearing his throat, Sam says, an edge to his voice, “Alright, can we actually discuss the case now?” Putting his container of steamed veggies or whatever to the side, he reaches for his tablet. Dean makes a mental note to try and get Sam to finish his dinner. When he’s stressed or otherwise upset, Sam often deliberately doesn’t eat—a never-ending source of worry for Dean.
Slowly, his eyes focused on the ceiling above him. But the ceiling in his room didn’t look like this—where was he?
ok-k-kay?” He’s so obviously overtired, yet stubbornly determined to take care of everyone. Overcome with affection, Castiel frames Dean’s face in his hands, strokes his thumbs over Dean’s cheeks.
At some point, he must fall asleep or something close to it, because the next thing he knows Dean is gently wiping the excess oil off his back and shoulders with a towel. The mattress dips as he moves, and then the blanket is being tucked around Castiel again. “I’m not tired,” Castiel says, but his voice comes out more breathy and sleepy than annoyed.
Except, Sam—Mr. Witch-in-training—had hesitated. “Look, Dean,” he’d said, sounding like he was carefully choosing each word. “We don’t know how long it’ll take to beat Chuck. We—I need a way to know when you need help and where you are when you need it. And I promise I’ll look into it, but a spell isn’t a magic fix.”
They fall into an uncomfortable silence. Dean only now realizes that Cas muted the movie at some point. He’s not really interested in watching it anyway. He’d rather talk to Cas, because he misses that and Cas is leaving tonight.
Dean hums. “No th-then.” His focus is briefly drawn away by the sound of laughter. The kids had taken a short break to cool down in the ocean but now have taken up the game again. “Well, we’re still down a-a-at Ocean Beach. You guys should c-c-c-come too. I’ve got a f-f-feeling it’s gonna make you feel b-b-better.”
“Okay, al-l-lright.” Dean folds his arms around Jack, a little awkwardly. They’ve hugged like once before, and that was shortly after Dean got back and was still completely beside himself. Jack doesn’t seem to mind. He just holds on, crying into Dean’s tee. When he finally draws back, his face is all blotchy and wet. Dean casts around for something to clean up with, when suddenly the Mom of the two kids from earlier comes over to them, holding out a couple of tissues with a soft smile.
After moving the blanket so it covers both of them, Castiel settles back in, finally able to rest. Dean's warmth and his heartbeat soothe him into an almost sleep-like state, and he only startles awake when there's a soft knock on the door.
Finally though, Sam announced that he needed some air and wanted to go on a run before dinner. The moment he was gone, Dean slammed the laptop lid shut and stood up. "Alright, enough research for today. C'mon, I need your help with something way more important."
“Yes, well…” Suddenly, he just really wants to see Dean. “I should, um.” He holds up the paper bag and motions towards the hallway leading to their rooms.
It feigns an attack at Cas and then goes after the kid, who Cas had been shielding until now. With only seconds to react, Dean shoulders Jack out of the way and then the next thing he knows his back hits the ground hard. Claws dig into his chest and his right arm is trapped, so he does the next best thing and fumbles for a rock with his left that he slams against the thing’s head as hard as he can.
Reaching for him, Castiel cups Dean’s face in one hand, waiting patiently until Dean is ready to meet his eyes. Stroking a tear away with his thumb, Castiel says, into the scant space between them, “I’m here, Dean. I will always be here.”
That realization brings a fresh wave of emotion, and the next thing he knows he’s in his room, sitting on his bed. He wrings his shaking hands, trying to keep it together.
Unable to keep looking at him, Dean drops his gaze down to where he’s anxiously playing with his fingers in his lap.
The kid looks up at Dean and hesitates for a moment before saying, “I... I'd like to share with Castiel, if that's alright.”
Sam smiles at her and he signs while he greets her, and she does the same, but they don’t touch and there’s a carefully measured distance between the two of them. Dean frowns but doesn’t say anything, filing the information away for later.
It's been strange and lonely spending the night in their room without Dean. Castiel’s grace has recovered enough that he’s not able to sleep anymore, and the space beside him felt eerily cold and empty.
Dean needs a moment to absorb that. He can’t remember praying at all, but he does remember his fear when he realized that he wouldn’t be able to get away from the edge of the pool fast enough.
One has a hole where its carrot nose should be and is angrily glaring. The snowman opposite to it is smirking, and not only seems to have a carrot for a nose, it also has an even bigger carrot as a… oh.
“Bet-t-ter. Head’s not spl-l-litting open a-a-anym-m-more.” Dean rolls onto his back so he can keep his head in Cas's lap but also look at him where the moonlight is illuminating his face and half his chest. “How ab-b-bout Sam a-a-and th-the oth-thers, they ok-k-kay?” He rubs the backs of his hands over his eyes and blinks up at Cas.
Jack joins them and helps them set the table, and then they round everyone up for dinner. Cas sits so closely beside Dean that they rub shoulders constantly, and Dean barely manages to eat, it's so distracting.
“So, Molly, our contact, says about seventy people have disappeared over the last three months, all of them homeless,” Sam says, signing while he speaks. “ It’s been happening all over the city but only at night. Nothing left behind except the victims belongings, in some cases blood and signs of struggle, but even then so little that the local authorities aren’t taking it very seriously, they probably don’t care.”
With Dean’s permission, Cas talked with the others, and ever since then, everyone asks for permission before they touch Dean. It took Dean a while not to feel so awkward about it, or guilty whenever he refused. By now though, Dean can’t remember ever having gotten that much physical affection.
It hurts so much. Dean begs for it to stop. The lights flash and flash and Dean's burning up from the inside. He's so cold and he can't think anymore. Agonizingly slowly, the light dims, the light fades away—
Cas puts a hand on Dean’s back, standing beside him but not sitting down. He’s still got that frown on his face that Dean could already hear over the phone.
Just like earlier, Dean seems to magically appear just as Castiel is fighting his way upright and out of bed. What follows is Castiel grumpily letting Dean help him to the sink so Dean can run a soapy washcloth over his back, and then grumpily letting him help with getting dressed again.
He’s still getting used to letting his guard down like this. It took him a long time, but now he cherishes just letting go and knowing that it will all be okay.
The only reason Dean doesn’t plomb down immediately on the king size bed in their room is that he really needs the bathroom first. Once he’s done he fumbles off his boots, makes a beeline for the bed, and lets himself fall on top of it with a groan.
Slumping a little in Dean’s hold, Cas is saying, “I started feeling bad about leaving you, worrying you.”
Cas just watches him, looking a little bit sad. And while Dean is glad that the pain he's in did at least keep him from getting hard, Cas doesn't look ruffled from their little make-out session at all. Doesn't look like he wants Dean the way Dean wants him. Dean swallows against the hurt and as if on cue, the pain in his head makes him squeeze his eyes shut and wince.
With an eye roll at himself, Dean shrugs back out of the brown flannel and into a red checkered one. He feels fucking stupid doing it, but tells himself it's okay because not wanting to look like a mess is perfectly normal.
Dean sits on the bed for a moment longer, brain struggling to reboot after that unexpected kiss. When it finally does, he can feel heat rush to his face. Grumbling, he scoots off the bed and gets his stuff together for a quick shower before bed. The water pressure turns out to be quite nice, but difficult to focus on, what with the fuzzy feeling in his chest and the skin on his forehead still tingling.
Stupid fucking flashbacks-induced migraine. If that hadn’t happened, he’d already know what’s going on. Could have talked to Sam. Could have helped fix it.
“I really am. But I’m still taking it slow. I’m sorry I was so resistant to your care,” Castiel adds with a huff.
Eileen has sent him an invitation for a round of Words With Friends. He'd thought she and Sam had gone to bed as well, but then again it is still quite early. He and Dean are usually the first ones to turn in, as Dean is the one who needs the most sleep out of all of them.
Something that glows faintly is hung around his neck, bumping softly against his chest. Then someone gently takes Dean’s hands in theirs and pours water over them, starts cleaning them off with a strip of cloth. The cleaner his hands become, the calmer Dean gets. Blinking, he can see now that it’s Cas crouched before him, tending to him. It’s not as dark as he thought; he can still make out at least the shapes of their surroundings, and only a few stars are visible yet.
He presses a kiss into Dean's palm and then closes his eyes and sighs when Dean cups his face. Castiel can feel and hear him moving closer, but instead of going in for a kiss, Dean lets go of his hand and snuggles in for an embrace.
“There’s an underpass under Friar’s Road. We got a settlement there, and I’ve been living there on and off for ‘bout eight years. Folks come to us for help when cops make them take down their tents and they don’t know where to go. I know almost everybody there and they know me.” Molly has a smoky, raspy voice. She seems calm and composed, but her fingers are nervously playing with a pack of salt, and Dean notes the minute trembling in them.
Dean’s quiet over dinner, mostly leaving conversation up to Sam and Cas. He ducks his head over his plate and glances at Cas. Sometimes when he looks up, Cas is looking at him.
In the bathroom that holds the large tub, Castiel takes off his trenchcoat, rolls up his sleeves, and gets to work.
. Tem-m-mpor-r-rary. I c-can f-f-f-feel it. L-l-l-like. In, um, ins-s-side. It w-w-won’t g-get b-back t-t-to how it, um, w-w-was bef-f-for-r-re.
Cas searches his eyes. “Why didn’t you tell me? I’m not mad,” he adds when Dean grimaces, “It’s just… this is such a small thing. I don’t understand why you would think I would deny you something so simple.”
Dean must have turned off his alarm, but they both wake up grumpy anyway. While Dean leaves to take a quick shower, Castiel washes his face and brushes his teeth. They feel fuzzy after he had eaten last night and then not cleaned them after, and that irritates Castiel as well.
They get lost in making out for a while, Castiel’s hand petting Dean’s hair while Dean holds onto him with his fingers buried in Castiel’s shirt. Finally, they’re interrupted by Dean’s stomach grumbling. It’s not surprising—by falling asleep earlier, Dean had completely missed lunch.
Sam lights up. “Oh yeah? That’s great. He wouldn’t let me.” He hands Castiel the next plate. “And how about you? Looking forward to tomorrow?"
“Cas, is he okay?” Suddenly, Sammy was there, hovering over both of them where Cas had sat down at the edge of the bed beside Dean.
They watch the waves in silence for a while. Jack gets up from the wall once to bring a ball that had rolled over to them back to the two small kids that were playing with it. Their joy briefly brings the smile back to his face, but it quickly fades into sadness again.
“F-f-fine. What about the k-kid, he up yet?” It's been a couple months since he lost his Grace, but Jack still has trouble sleeping. A lot of the time, he either sleeps like a drunk baby or not at all.
Distantly, Dean’s aware he’s crying. He wants to kiss Cas. Torn between conflicting instincts, he reaches forward and draws him close, draws him into a hug instead. It’s awkward with the armrests of the chairs between them, but Cas doesn’t seem to care either. He clings back just as tightly. Their hearts thump against each other. Dean’s skin erupts in goosebumps with how good-bad the touches are, but he stubbornly holds on.
It's twenty minutes into the movie and Dean has already forgotten what it's supposed to be about. He's sitting in one of the armchairs, Cas in the one next to him. Jack is sitting on a pillow on the floor between them because he's a weirdo—which is probably a given considering who raised him.
Castiel has come to greatly enjoy watching the show with them, but today he can't really concentrate on it. Drowsy from the long day, Dean has cuddled into his side with his head on Castiel’s shoulder. He smells like sunscreen and fresh air, and his presence at Castiel's side is warm and steady. He was playing absently with the buttons on Castiel’s shirt but then became too sleepy. Now, Castiel’s hand is covering Dean's on his chest, gently stroking the back of it with his thumb while Dean dozes.
