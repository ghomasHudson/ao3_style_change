“But what if –”
Sherlock nodded, and shuffled back out of the kitchen in his oversized hoody, going upstairs like lightning, and opening his laptop, going to the websites he had saved, for if, or when, he was able to get what he wanted. He already had a wish-list on his favourite site, and added everything on it to the cart before typing in Mycroft’s card information and selecting priority shipping.
Sherlock shrugged. “But it is up to you, Colonel. Trial by me, or trial by my people.”
“Then, I won’t.” John folded his arms. “I’m stuck like this, now. Forever. I hate it. But I will not become a killer, Sherlock.”
“To court?” John frowned. “Would I have to go?”
‘This is not what I expect from you, Watson,’ he snapped at him.
“Oh,” Mycroft looked embarrassed for a moment. “Not to worry, I’m sure something can be… Anyway, they’re lighting the fire shortly. And the bar is open.”
Sherlock blinked, and let go of John’s arms. “Is that what that was? To try and get me to –”
“Mine,” John growled, low and rumbling against Sherlock’s skin. “My omega. My Sherlock.”
‘I know, I googled it,’ John said. ‘The school had a letter looking for boys to join. They must be wanting to diversify or something.’
“Don’t mention it.” The supervisor handed him the file. “You know this one, anyway. Holmes kid.”
“Wasn’t really hurt?” John growled. “Then maybe you won’t mind a matching mark.”
“I mean, teaching, and letting me sleep on your sofa, and – and looking after me.” Sherlock went red. “And I don’t want you to have to deal with my family’s problems. You don’t… deserve that.”
"A cup of leaf-water hardly constitutes a treat..." Sherlock muttered darkly as they locked up the medical bay and walked across to the mess.
“You did invite yourself back into his house. If he wanted to be rid of you, he would have said ‘no’ to that.”
But John’s face wasn’t teasing. It was genuinely curious, gentle. He was being… kind? A small smile played over his mouth. That same smile he’d worn when he caught Sherlock looking at him. What did that smile
“Mm? I’m going to court with Lestrade, if you wanted me.”
“That’s the spirit,” Jim smirked. He stretched out his arms, and looked Sherlock over properly. “Are you wearing a binder?”
Sherlock put his arms on the table, the palms of his hands up, the insides of his elbows visible. The dirty white skin was marked with cuts, track-lines, and bruises. “I need that sort of thing.”
John looked up at him. “Can I take your pants off?”
John nodded, picking up the dropped quinoa, but keeping his eyes on Sherlock the entire time.
Sherlock took a deep breath.
Sherlock put his hand in his pocket, like he was saving John’s tiny touch. “Enjoy those books, John.”
Sherlock’s eyes went dark. “What did he tell you?”
But before that, Sherlock was somewhere he couldn’t be contacted.
John laughed. “Sure, mate.”
“I lecture in medicine,” John said. “I’m a qualified doctor. And I used to be in the army.”
“Well, I do have a laboratory,” Cam said, as though joking. “I jest, of course, but…” his face filled with a sad longing, which quickly vanished. “Go on. Your parents will be looking for you.”
“You hurt him,” Greg’s eyes rolled to John’s. “You really hurt him.”
John took a deep breath. “Sherlock… Sherlock, I’m… pregnant.”
“Not yet. I’d have to consent to it, and I have refused every time. But I wonder for how much longer they’ll let me get away with it.”
“You mean the drugs,” John clarified, following him out of the shop.
“Of course not,” Sherlock winked at John, who couldn’t help grinning back.
"So, what… you're a shrink, now?" Embarrassed, John was on the defensive, as humans often were.
John went so red he was in danger of catching fire. “I… don’t think I need that, do I?”
By the time he looked back down at his basket it was almost overflowing. And he didn’t even have any bath stuff, or nappies, or muslin cloths, or –
John stared, then his eyes went wide. “You mean about us being friends.”
The man nodded, and took the twenty, and replaced it with a tiny plastic packet, the powder inside looking like snow.
John looked at Sherlock in Cam’s arms.
“You won’t,” Sherlock said. “The urge to feed only gets stronger throughout the day. You’ll flee the flat and bite a pedestrian. You won’t be able to resist.”
John nodded, there was no point denying it.
"Thank you," Sherlock jumped down, and snatched his bag up.
“Yes,” Sherlock snapped, then sighed. “Sorry. He called me, after you… accosted him.”
Sherlock shook his head. “This is ridiculous. I’ve had enough of talking to lunatics. Good night.”
“I just want to…” John moaned softly, letting his mouth fall open. His fangs were down so far they were over an inch long each, his gums were black with his own old, congealed blood, and risen up with bumps like boils – threatening to burst out of the dead flesh. “It hurts,” he cried.
John considered. “I don’t know how to. How to do reply to someone who’s attempted to justify… that?”
Sholto grabbed John's t-shirt front and yanked him around to face him.
“Shit.”
Sherlock took a stride forward, and John shuffled back a step out of fear until Sherlock was looming over him anyways. Their eyes did not part. "And how, John, do you know that?”
Sherlock said hummed, and picked a file out of the stacks. "Who would an order come from to open fire on the people living close by? The major?"
, Sherlock thought, sadly. “My body isn’t right.”
Sherlock died at 6:22am.
“Sort of, I’ll be taking questions later, during the refreshments,” Joe smiled. “You nervous?”
“He needs counselling,” Greg said gently.
He scrubbed at his neck until it felt raw, then his sore and bruising wrists, his chest, his face, everywhere he felt Siger’s touch, or eyes, had been. He felt appalling dirty.
Sherlock almost laughed, but instead he turned away. "Don't be absurd. You should get a good night's rest. We'll question Jane Mathers tomorrow."
John knew he was dead.
John couldn’t think. It was awful. He’d never exactly been close to Sherlock’s dad, but this was still an adult he’d known well since childhood, and now… He stepped closer again. ‘Sherlock, I’m so sorry.’
He caught the smell of omega just as a hand closed on the boy’s arm.
,” he said softly. “For being me. Sherlock Holmes. Not as an omega boy. Man. I want someone to choose
The vampire pulled John out of his seat.
“It’s fine,” Sherry said softly. “He’ll need you, after… it all.”
“Sorry,” John slid the cabinet drawer shut. “That needs a bit of a tidy, in there. I’ll sort it tomorrow, if I get chance.”
“You’re not Dr Watson, yet,” Sherlock pointed out.
Sherlock, perched on the opposite roof, watched John leave Lestrade’s house, and walk towards the underground.
“Heat Suites? No, only those who can afford it. Sherlock had been unwell at school, the school contacted out parents, and they arranged it.”
Sherlock rested for a moment, inhaling the menthol smell, then moved his hand up, over his concave stomach, touching at his hip-bones. He liked those. Those could stay. Then lower, where the water lifted and curled his public hair. He didn’t dwell as he touched further, parting the lips of his labia, feeling the only result of his hormones that he was pleased with.
And he did, passing his exams with flying colours and moving back to the UK with a different, harder outlook. Basic training continued, with John having a lot to make up for – he’d missed time, and he was naturally not as fast or tough as his alpha and beta comrades. He ran hard, let his drill instructor scream at him as he climbed obstacles and learned to fire a gun he hoped he’d never have to use to take someone’s life.
"News came my way from Camp Bastion. They had a request to relay to you the condition of a Captain John H. Watson. Does the name ring a bell?"
John felt his eyes prickle. And his throat felt very tight, pain aching right up to his ears.
“I was just leaving,” Mycroft nodded at James, and looked back at John. “Stay in touch, won’t you?”
Thankfully, John wasn’t kept waiting too long.
“That’s not the term I’d use.”
“Yes,” Sherlock hung up, moaning into the sofa cushions as he slid his digits in and out. They weren’t long enough, weren’t thick enough… He took hold of his cock with his free hand, and worked it, quickly getting himself off with a cry, come splattering his chest.
Instead he went to Sherlock’s bed and picked up his pillow, pressing his face into it. The scent flooded his lungs and mouth and nose, making him hug the pillow tight, mourning the loss of the boy he didn’t deserve, crying as his alpha tears washed away the smell of sweet omega, and of the chance John hadn’t been aware he was losing.
Siger smiled.
John brought the teas over, feeling slightly out-done, but a tiny bit of him (maybe his growing omega side) was pleased Sherlock was feeding him, and doing it properly. “I haven’t put sugar in.”
Sherlock groaned, and pushed off and out of John, pulling away so a trickle of come ran from John’s insides. “Oh, god. Oh… my god.”
John shrugged. “Don’t have a choice now, do I?”
,” John snarled, tightening the grip with his legs against Sherlock’s, and urging the head of Sherlock’s thick alpha cock inside himself with a gasp.
“Coward,” John said.
He could stay.
Sherlock gave John’s arms a small squeeze, then went to get his bags out of the car boot. John rang the doorbell, feeling rather sick.
Sherlock looked almost insulted. ‘Yes.’
John wished he could say the same back.
John didn’t even snore in reply.
John stamped down his alpha annoyance, and picked his bag up. “Ok, then. I’ve got an hour.”
John’s ventilator had been taken off, and he was being allowed to breathe on his own. His voice sounded dreadful – like he was suffering from a terrible infection – and every time he breathed in, he wheezed.
Sherlock smiled. “A predator’s urge to kill is separate from the urge to feed.” He flashed his teeth. “They are closely connected, like love and lust, but separate all the same. I could never lose the urge to feed, but I could overcome the urge to kill. It meant… forming an attachment. At the time, I did not think it would be something… romantic. A partnership, was what I envisioned.”
do you know my wife? Answer me!”
Sherlock ignored the hand. “You’re insane.”
“You know Eurus,” the oldest alpha sighed. “She has long been under Siger’s influence. She may choose to take his side over yours.”
“Mm. Ow,” Sherlock said impatiently as his baby clamped down.
!!! NEWS !!!
John got up from his desk chair, and came and sat beside Sherlock on the sofa, taking one of his hands in both of his. “What do you think they want?”
“Ha! Yeah… there’s a reason you passed so well as a beta in the army, and it wasn’t all those scent suppressors.”
Back to John's POV, and there'll be no more flicking back to the 'past' from now on. Thanks for all your amazing support with this fic, everyone. I live for your lovely comments and feedback, you really make this a ride worth hanging on to.
“Mycroft’s coming here. He won’t be long,” Sherlock smiled quickly, then looked at Lestrade. “You didn’t have to wait for me.”
“Of course,” John kissed his neck again before stepping, reluctantly, away. “Go scare a few normals.”
“Of course I have.”
Sherlock gave the tiniest of smirks. “Afghanistan or Iraq?”
After the evening sleeping cuddled together on the bed, they’d not really discussed anything about how they felt. For Sherlock, the idea, and the non-physical wounds, were too raw, and John was more than willing to wait for Sherlock to be comfortable with any conversation.
“Doing what?”
Instead, he washed his hands, and went back into the dark bedroom, seeing by the radio clock that it was barely six am.
“Fine. I’ll try and get the police to work around your schedule.” Sherlock flounced down the stairs, and left John at the top, feeling very out of sorts.
“I remember the books saying that omegas wanted to have sex when in heat,” John said.
‘It takes two to tango,’ Mycroft pointed out. ‘You’re both to blame.’
Sherlock could only nod as his cock throbbed, seeking more friction, but the texture of his pants threatening to chafe. “Mm.”
“Toast?” John kissed that cute nose again.
“Or, I’ll nip out, once we get back. I imagine you’ll need milk. I’ll get you things.”
John’s words were cut short as Sherlock moved too fast too see, and bit hard into his neck. There was pain, and John shouted, made to pull away, but he couldn’t. Sherlock never normally hurt him much, these days. He knew how to slide in his sharp fangs so the pain never lasted for more than a moment, quickly drowned in pleasure.
John marched up the stairs, one hand on the banister, the other beneath his bump. It was pleasantly obvious, now. A curve that rose and turned under his clothes that could no longer really be passed off as a paunch. It would be a lie to say it suited John, because it did not. The man did not have an omega’s lithe physique, or gentle curves. He was, even now, months out of the armed forced, built solidly, with lines of muscle and strength. His body did not look like the sort intended to create and support life, but yet…
They were both already standing, following him out of the door, not bothering to grab coats, just keys as they pelted down the stairs after the fugitive they’d been chasing for weeks – get this one, Lestrade had said, and they could all retire.
“No, he’s not into that. He’d rather die. People have heard him say so. So… I’ll give him what he wants. It’s only fair, after all.”
Sherlock didn’t even blink.
But he didn’t comment. Just let sleep take him wherever it would. He didn’t need a destination. Because he was travelling with the best passengers.
“Did you want me to offer you a place?” Sherlock spluttered.
“Is that safe?” Sherlock asked.
“Just being sensible is all you can do. Have a stress-free home life, if you can, that sort of thing.”
, I want you.”
“It’s fine,” Sherlock squeezed his hand. “You don’t need to apologise. I… I never realised how backwards all this is. As long as I’ve been alive, the system – all of it – has played in my favour. Just because of the circumstances of my birth, I’ve been given chances you haven’t. Easier route, a less difficult time. An alpha from an old family can walk into a career, get away with minor offences, claim things as our ‘right’ that we should not. We are a privileged lot. I just didn’t realise how much until I started spending more time with you.”
“Eurus,” John said, remembering. “Eurus knew what was happening. I told her, the first time. I’m sure she saw it happening, too. And – and it was happening to her.”
And the only thing he could do was lower his head to one side, and look at the floor in horrified submission, in an instinctive urge to be small, to hide himself, to let his alpa take from him what he needed – what they both needed – to reignite their bond.
He got out of bed, and collected his cricket bat from his room before going downstairs, switching on every light he came to until he checked the back and front doors. Both locked. He crept back up the stairs, checking behind him halfway up, and deciding to leave the landing light on. Just to make the house look occupied.
Sherlock took his hand, wrapping his fingers over his closed fist.
“I just have,” John said.
“You’re very welcome,” Cam beamed. “It suits you.”
He wondered if Sherlock would be able to feel it.
“God, Sherlock,” John cupped his face. “My Sherlock… the fact that you want to be close, to do thing like this… and you’re not in heat? Is pretty much the sexiest thing on the fucking planet.”
He crossed the road, and went into the chain pharmacy, trying not to look like some wanton omega who shagged anyone during a heat. What was the point, though? They were going to think that anyway.
“Such a good omega, to ask so nicely,” Sherlock’s gaze flicked to John, gauging a response, and delighting in the blush and bitten lip he saw. “I’ll give you what you want, my love. Tell me what you want, and it shall be yours.”
“What?” John splayed his hands on Sherlock’s back, not daring to get his hopes up.
“Right,” John tried to think. Why couldn’t they use the bedroom? Who cared if they used the bedroom?
“You’re horrible! Go away!” Sherlock snorted with laughter as John pulled his hands away and made kissing noises at him. “No, go away, I can’t look at you ever again.”
John stared; horror, sadness and dread running through his own veins. “You… you’re on treatment?”
“No, it’s a hypothetical –”
“I’m not homeless, I just can’t go back to 221B yet. Victor Trevor is still in residence.”
“Your dad has a lot to learn,” John dragged his nose around Sherlock’s belly button. “I’m going to love his son until the end of time even if he’s huge and pregnant with triplets.”
The morning of the guardianship court case came the day after Sherlock’s birthday.
“Without her? Jesus.”
The bell rang for dinner.
“No, it’s ok. I’ve only heard grown-ups say that. When they thought I wasn’t listening.”
Greg watched the plate disappear. “Army tastebuds, huh?”
John stared. “So… what? You’re ok with the fact your brother has abandoned his mate?”
John was on him like a rabid animal, dragging Sherlock to the floor and hitting him so hard Sherlock was dully aware that the injury he had given John was likely being repeated on his own skull. John shook him, hit him again, only this time the hit was a slap, and again, choking angry noises coming from the direction of John’s face.
John frowned. That didn’t make sense. Unless Sherlock was more protective over
Victor held a hand up, and opened the door properly. “I think you should come in. I… I’ve been wondering when this day would come. Expected it sooner, to be honest. I knew the risk, when we met. But…” he blinked the shine from his eyes, “come in. Sherlock won’t be long.”
Sherlock took his turn to go quiet, then.
“So, alpha presentation…” he got his mind back on track. “Generally, alphas will feel a bit sick in the days up to their first rut. They might have a temperature, or off their food, which can make people think they’re going to present omega, as the symptoms of pre-heat are the same as pre-rut, but heats, of course, happen regularly. Ruts, once you’re presented, may never happen again. Presenting alphas will be extremely irritable, and may want to be alone, but as soon as rut begins, it is important to isolate them, particularly from omegas.”
John disappeared from view, and there came the sound of the door being unlocked. Sherlock darted across the room and down the stairs faster than blinking to be standing on the staircase as John walked in.
“Of tearing humans’ throats out? Quite. Of course, arriving here offered another explanation.” He stood straighter, and glanced at John. “You know, he beat you severely.”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said softly. “I never thought… I didn’t think.” He took a tiny step forward. “I found it easy to talk to you, and I shouldn’t have gone there…”
It was a close-mouthed kiss, and the innocence of it took John by surprise, but Sherlock didn’t make a move to open his mouth at all. Instead, there were lots of small kisses, and they were so different that they seemed new, and sweet, and John barely knew how to handle them.
John shook his head, as if trying to clear it, then pushed Sherlock down onto the bed. He made to fall with him, but caught himself on bed-frame, realising that landing on his front would be a bad idea.
“Do you regret it?”
“Doing his morning ablutions, as far as I know. You can go up.” He followed the detective inspector up to the lounge.
John stopped at the doorway. He looked around. “Any of it. I’ve fucked up, and it’s too late, now. But I’ve had enough. I made a mistake.” He left the room.
“Jesus…” he smoothed his hair, and went over to the screen showing who was outside the door, hoping it was Sherlock.
John woke up with the feeling that something had changed. Like a page in the book of his life had just turned over, or perhaps a new chapter had begun.
Sherlock looked at his coffee cup. Then followed his mother to where she was drying her eyes in the kitchen. When she saw him, a fresh wave of tears came, and she let her tiny self be pulled into her youngest son’s arms.
“Sure,” John let himself in. “First thing on my mind.” He slammed the door behind him, putting the deadbolts on.
“You don’t have to thank me, Sherlock.”
John made an incredulous noise. “You… don’t even know you’re doing it.”
John was at work when the phone rang.
John blinked.
He didn’t know.
Sherlock reeled back, banging his head slightly against the wall as he tried to shake off the images fading before his eyes.
“Sure,” Sherlock shrugged. “We can order food in… Mycroft’s not exactly a cook.”
And then Sherlock kissed him again, and John concentrated on kissing back even as the very tip of a tentacle breached him. Lubricating slick came with it, taking the edge off the burn as the tentacle widened, enough to make John gasp and tense, suddenly going rigid.
John pushed Sherlock gently away, grinning as Sherlock made a show of wiping his mouth and chin on the back of his hand. ‘God, I want you.’
Sherlock hums. “I think I could make an exception. You make a pretty persuasive argument.”
John suppressed a shudder. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust James. Far from it – as a comrade and a friend, he was invaluable. But there was a glint of alpha possessiveness in his eye, now. John didn’t know whether to fear for himself, or not.
“I can’t see why you’d want to bond with me,” Sherlock whispered.
"Doing what?"
“It’s always difficult, choosing who to spend the rest of your life with,” Violet said. “But we know you’ll choose someone who’ll treat you like a prince, value you. You’re special, Sherlock. You need someone who recognises that. And not everyone will, I’m sorry to say. Some people will want to just… use you. You need someone who will always recognise your value, and give you opportunities.”
“…but I want you to know that…”
John turned to reassure him, when he stopped. “V-Victor?”
“Let’s not,” James agreed. He cleared his throat. “So… what’re you in for? Shoulder stuff?”
No sounds, or restless shifting.
“Me, too,” Sherlock smiled.
“Well, we’ve found two, so far. Forensics are there, now.”
“Good…” the alpha looked as if he was considering.
“Something like that.”
John meant to wake up early on Sherlock’s birthday, and go over to his bedroom window to give him his present before his parents came in to wish him many happy returns. But, as luck would have it, he overslept. He woke up with a start at half past nine, and pelted to the front side of the house in time to see Sherlock’s dad de-frosting his car. They were obviously going out for the day.
In John’s head, Sherlock had already made his choice.
“I don’t know, Miss,” he said quietly.
“Now you know what to look for, you’ll see this is an omega male. He has a uterus, slightly larger than the beta counterpart, and functional ovaries. He also has larger, more developed muscles along his birth canal. His testes and penis are there, but smaller than a beta’s, at least in this instance – again, this does vary from person to person – and he is unable to produce sperm.” John closed the slideshow and turned the lights back on. “So, for your homework, I want you to essay and discuss the differences between primary and secondary genders in terms of having children. Two thousand words, including any diagrams. Thank you.”
“Ok…” John gasped, his knees going weak. “Oh… kay…” Sherlock’s kisses were at his throat, now, tiny nips and licks punctuating deep kisses, tasting John’s skin, each touch making John tremble. Sherlock squeezed John’s arse again, his other hand coming around to the fake bump, which was clearly doing a number on the alpha. “God, you realise this isn’t a real one right..?”
“Quite. I did wonder, for a long time, if the family disruption…” Timothy twisted his hands.
Sherlock swiped lilac lipstick onto his lower lip, and dusted it with glitter. A finishing touch to the look he had copied from someone online. They called it The Diamond Pearl Look, but Sherlock thought he looked more like the pale squishy parts of an oyster. Still, his mother squealed and fanned herself when he appeared from his bedroom, and his father gruffly told him he looked nice, so it seemed to be doing the trick.
should be. Anything.
"I'm resolved to what happened back then. It can't happen again," Sherlock said. “And it won’t. I do not take this lightly," he added coldly.
You were never far away from the strange, in London.
And Sherlock was going to look after him.
Sherlock had put him there. He hadn’t known what else to do with him. His eyes were still open, so Sherlock had put coins on the lids to try and hold them shut, the way people used to in the old days. He daren’t remove them to see if they had worked.
Cam grinned.
He shouldn’t notice. He shouldn’t care.
“Please,” the omega rutted his hips up, against John’s erection. “Oh god, John. Please…”
“Ok, maybe you would. Maybe you’d be happy I’d be back on the cases faster. No pram to push about. No… whatever those rucksacks you put babies into. None of that shit.” John sighed. “No complications.”
‘Are you sure university is right for you?’ Cam asked, sounding concerned. ‘Whatever would you do with a degree?’
– on his bed in such a state.
He shuddered, thinking about flipping his collar up. And it was only going to get warmer as the year went on.
The photographer wanted pictures of Sherlock getting out of the car, so he had to get back in and out again three times, giving a better smile each time. It wasn’t real. It was all a performance. Sherlock had to pose outside the registry office, near the climbing rose trees, looking back in profile as the roses framed his face. Then he stood aside and Mycroft signed to say he agreed to the ceremony.
“You’re apologising?” John lowered his mug. “You?”
When John Watson was a little boy of five, he wanted to be a soldier. He wanted it more than anything, because it was, in some ways, all he knew. His dad was a soldier, and even his mother worked behind a desk in the military. They were an alpha-beta pair, with two children, and John had a happy childhood, erring on dull.
“I passed them all,” he looked around at John, his eyes starting to blur with fresh tears. “I… I can do it.”
“I’ll be back tomorrow night. I’ll come over.”
Sherlock just held his hand, as he thought. John watched his face, as if he could maybe get a clue about the alpha’s thoughts if he stared hard enough. All he could see were Sherlock’s pale eyes, the line of his jaw, the hook of his nose. Despite his mood, a tiny spark of happiness prickled under John’s skin. Happiness, and hope.
Sherlock buried his nose in the covers. "Just... Feeling a bit off."
It smelled of alpha.
“Just for a bit,” John said. “I’m too hot.”
“Please look after her,” John whispered.
Sherlock shifted against his pillow. “You don’t like John, do you?”
“Does it look ok?” John asked, wiping his skin with some paper towel.
“Woah, hang on,” John took his hand away from Sherlock’s hair, and went for his hand, instead, holding it firmly on the cushion that still hid Sherlock’s chest. “That’s not what I was saying. I’m just thinking what
“Yes,” Sherlock stayed still, trembling under John’s attentions. “Yes, he didn’t… I let him.”
“We’ll go for a coffee, first,” Sherry stretched his legs. “And pick up the bags we left at the desk. Maybe get a few final things. I’m not having my nephew or niece underdressed.”
,” John gawped, as Sherlock turned on the spot in his tailored suit. “Shit, what’re you trying to do to me?”
magazine.
"I expected to be greeted by Major Sholto."
John swallowed. “I don’t know if he did. He came over to me…” he felt Sherlock’s fingers clench, just a touch, “…and he kissed me, and took me to…” he frowned. “I don’t know. I could have said ‘no’, couldn’t I?”
“No,” John shook his head. “Read an up to date textbook, Kevin.”
He needed to live. And he was hardly doing that.
Sherlock looked down at his navy blue bather, which covered him from neck to knee, leaving his arms and lower legs bare. “Don’t you like it?”
“And?”
Sherlock turned back to his laptop, typing in the address for his school server. He bypassed the staff login easily, and left a program running in the background, working its way into the administrative system.
“I’m ok, tonight,” Sherlock insisted, ignoring the throb between his legs at John’s words. “I don’t… want you to… see, right now.”
“When they come. They’ll ask you. If I should keep control. Of my drip,” he held the control up. “Addicts don’t usually. John argued for it. You have to let me. Keep it.”
Sherlock looked away, and John was unsure if he had detected his feelings or not. “He’s going to move schools. Mycroft told me. To be with his… mate.”
“Decaf, please,” John forced a smile, then exhaled again as Greg left the room. He adjusted the elastic waistband of his jeans, and got up from his own desk, going over to the file cabinet behind Greg’s desk. He’d needed to get it some records for ages, but since Greg was right there… John quickly dug through the folders, cursing. He needed to be able to see…
them. I can’t even look after myself.”
“Check? What – oh, fuck,” John clenched a fist. “I’d be going to jail for doing a murder.”
“Move,” Sherlock moaned, leaning into the kisses. “Please, please move, or –”
“It’s John,” John whispered. “Sorry. You’re in my room. I’m just after some pants.”
Sherlock put a hand on his knee, and the two men sat in silence, the only sound their baby’s gentle snuffling against her mother’s skin.
“No,” Sherlock snapped, fishing his arm out and looking extremely annoyed. “This is ridiculous. There’s no sign of someone having dug around to pull the shaft out.” He was focussing on a wound in one of the victims’ backs.
“Late, Watson,” Mr Young barked at him as he darted into his tutor group at five past nine.
“And yes, that does include your internet history,” John rolled his eyes. “You still want to jump into the Thames?”
Sherlock looked at him in alarm, then went scarlet from his chin to the roots of his hair. “John!”
Sherlock couldn’t hide how his heart was hurting. He stood. “John… you have to understand…” he reached for him, but John didn’t move. Sherlock let his arms drop. “John… when a Creator bites a victim, they have no way of knowing whether or not their actions will result in a new vampire. There is no way of knowing, unless you stay to see the result for yourself.”
Sherlock nodded. “If you can go twenty-four hours without biting a human, you die. Permanently, this time.”
“Perhaps a little ambiance,” John murmured. And suddenly the bushes and trees lit up with soft, glowing, fairy lights. The Christmas decorations illuminated the grass, and shone on lush green leaves and firm tree-trunks, leading the way through the gardens like a pathway to a fae grotto.
“Mm…” Sherlock blew out his breath through his mouth, like the antenatal classes had told him. “Hurts a bit more… now.”
Sherlock’s mouth quirked in a half-smile. “So, that’s what happens when we die, then?” He nodded at John. “Angels. Heaven. That’s all real, then?”
“Ideal?” Sherlock raised his eyebrows.
Sherlock didn’t answer. He couldn’t. His hand was mangled. His hand… which he needed to play. Which he needed to be perfect. He let out a sob.
“Morning…” John poured, and set the jug back down. He picked up his spoon, and twirled it, worrying. “Mycroft… are there any… any picture of Sherlock, before… before he…”
Sherlock grabbed his head in both hands, kissing him hard, fast, desperately, making him topple backwards onto the bed as Sherlock climbed over him, still kissing, through tears, and with shaking arms. This couldn’t be real, because John would never say this to him, never, ever, ever…
“Oh, John. Oh, John, I’m so sorry… I’m so sorry, my love…”
John groaned. “Looks like we’d best go in.”
“Happened?” Sherlock looked at him.
“Having a….. visit, I think,” John said.
John bit his lip and nodded. “I just want you to be happy, Sherlock.”
Sherlock nodded, again.
He stifled a yawn as he opened the front door, to be greeted with Violet squealing about something in the drawing room. That wasn’t strictly unusual. He took his shoes off, and made to go up the stairs to his room, when Eurus called his name.
“What’s the matter with you now?” Sherlock sighed, taking the opposite armchair. “Please don’t tell me it’s anything to do with you and Lestrade.”
Sherlock shook his head. ‘When I came home for Father’s funeral, I got harassed on the street by two alphas. I only went out for a cigarette. There was that alpha at the airport, who tried to grab me. Older men who sniff at me when I walk past. Everything I want to do, I need immunity from
“Humans,” Sherlock repeated, nodding enthusiastically. “John… is human.”
“Sure, I’ll just go and ask for one.” John excused himself. He went out to the nurses’ station, and asked for water and a few biscuits for Sherlock’s room. He went back again, and was about to open the door, when he stopped to listen.
“Now,” the eldest Holmes steepled his fingers. “Sherlock told me, last night, that you… assisted him. In finding out his secondary gender.”
“Well… a lot of people would be.”
"This is bullshit. You fucking bloodsucker," James shouted, grabbing Sherlock bodily by the collar and pulling him from his seat on the bench. Sherlock let him, their eyes meeting.
He looked away, trying to ground himself, to look normal.
Sherlock nodded. John was warm, like hanging onto a radiator. He smelled warm, too, like sunlight on skin. Sherlock wondered how long he’d be able to identify smells. His sense of taste was variable at best.
“Well, I brought you this,” Sherlock held out the cup marked ‘decaf’. “And to tell you… I’m… no longer in a relationship.”
‘Aside from the hair and eyes,’ Sherlock said. ‘She’s got the shape of his face, I think.’
“Then, I wouldn’t miss it,” Cam smiled. “Off you go, Sherlock. Be good, won’t you?”
“No.”
Mycroft came in to greet his family, next, and soon they were all drinking port (except John, who had a sad orange juice that made the baby do wriggling again), and eating nibbles in front of the fire. John had to smile as he looked at them all. Mycroft, texting Gregory. Sherry sitting on Alfie’s lap, feeding him grapes and cheese. And Sherlock, curled up, cat-like, beside John, one hand on his thigh.
“I don’t deny it,” John said. “Really, I - I’m sorry. Running out on you was unfair. You should have been given the chance to –”
, and I started to think…” he pressed a hand to his mouth.
“Everything alright?” he asked.
“It was just an argument.”
“God, this isn’t worth it,” Victor withdrew, and pulled the covers over them both. He wrapped an arm around the sorrowful omega. Sherlock hid his face in the pillow. “Sherlock…”
John gawped, and put the flowers down, grateful they were in a box. “Fine… Erm… long time no see?”
“Does it hurt?” John opened the little box.
Or, maybe it would. Maybe he’d be engaged to Magnussen now anyway, only he’d be not pregnant and happy about it. Maybe, all he’d really done, was cause himself misery. Omegas really were the worst. He was the worst. And now he was trying to trick two alphas to cover for his own mistakes.
Sherlock complied, his omega obedience making John feel like crushing him to his chest. “John…”
“I thought you’d suspect,” John groaned. “I… It was stupid, but seeing you kind of made me realise that Sherlock was happy with you. That he wasn’t mine. And I was happy for you both. Genuinely.”
Sherlock clenched the blanket in his fingers. “I…”
John yawned suddenly, and snuggled against Sherlock’s side as they walked, letting his alpha pull him close. “I’m so tired. But I kind of want you to ravage me, too. Pregnancy is weird.”
A week later, and it was the day of Sherlock’s exam results. He woke up, and stared at the ceiling, clicking his alarm off without looking at it.
And, John suspected, Mycroft was bewildered as to how his brother and John remained unbonded. And he wasn’t the only one, if so.
"Mummy, I have to do this," Sherlock said, his voice very small, but the two women in the room did stop and look at him. "I'm seventeen, now. I need to start taking testosterone. I need to get rid of... I need top surgery. I can't keep... doing this."
Then realised.
John looked up at a man in uniform, a small smile on his face. Beta. Thirties. Kind face. “Oh, sure. I mean, no, it’s not taken.”
“Obviously. I believe religion is best left to those who enjoy talking to their imaginary friends in public long after it has lost any sort of childish appeal.”
It wasn’t a question. Except it sort of was.
“Come on,” the detective walked in and unlocked Sherlock’s wrist. “Your turn in the hot seat.”
. They were the days Sherlock sometimes didn’t come to school at all. If he did, he lounged across the desk like he’d melted, barely speaking, eyes glazed, hair unwashed. Those days made John angry, though he wasn’t sure why. There was no real pattern to Sherlock’s moods, it seemed, though sometimes his happier days seemed to come a day or so after he’d been for one of his many doctor’s appointments.
“Been attacked by alphas who were not in rut,” Sherlock snapped, pulling the kit out of the cupboard. “It’s all about self-control. Of which I have enough.”
It was more than a slight relief when Sherlock arrived after breakfast, carrying a car-seat which held a crying Birdie.
“I never expected you to,” Sherlock breathed.
“Thank you,” John took the pictures. “So… what happens now?”
John raised an eyebrow at the uncontested jealousy. “Besides, what does it matter if I flirt a bit?”
“It doesn’t matter, Sherlock.”
“We have to take into account your welfare as an omega,” the solicitor shrugged. “Surely you don’t think a university campus is a safe place for an unbonded young man like yourself?”
John laughed loudly out of nervous shock, making people look round. He tapped his plastic cup against Sherlock’s. ‘Sure,’ he said, sounding casual. ‘Sure. Next time.’ He looked terrified and thrilled just to think about it.
Sherlock scowled. "Don't be daft, John. Of course he didn't do it. Just look at him. I do, however, think he was coerced into changing the documentation of the incident."
John came out the bedroom (
Sherlock looked over his shoulder at the mess he’d made of the man, at the bruises running from his abdomen to his jaw. "You should go eat, John," he smirked.
The party wasn’t anything like the parties John had been to with his parents – this was mostly people standing around and talking, whilst people wove between them, offering platters of food. John tried a few of the tiny pieces that came around, and they were all too rich for him. He ended up sitting on one of the drawing room couches, half people-watching, half staring into space.
An alpha hand.
‘What? What has he done for you? Besides shower you with gifts and attention? He has pressed his way into your life, Sherlock, via our parents. He used them to get access to you, do you understand me?’
John did his best not to look confused.
Sherlock shook his head. “It doesn’t matter.”
Mycroft rolled his eyes. “I have told Sherlock where this will lead, and what end you can both expect of all this. I’ve made my opinions quite clear, and –”
John suddenly shot off the bed as though it was on fire, and darted over to the mirror so fast he might have been a blur to human eyes. Sherlock saw him perfectly – moving with vampiric speed over to the glass. John stopped in front of the dressing table, and gasped in shock as a pair of scarlet eyes looked back at him. The transformation had taken a few years off his face as well, though left the rest of him untouched. He still had his soldier’s body, his face with the laughter-lines, those strong arms and hands that Sherlock knew so well…
Things came to a head one Sunday morning.
“I told you, it was severe.” Mycroft examined his nails. “Once I pulled him away… I think he saw what he had done. I knew it would take you a little while to reanimate.”
"I've never had a… relationship. At least, not the way relationships are carried out in this day and age," Sherlock said. "And I've never really been open to one, before. Not really my area, since murdering the only person I've ever loved.”
“It’s such a damn shame,” Timothy hurriedly took his glasses off, cleaned them, and replaced them. “Such a waste… oh, I’ll sort that tea. Sherlock’s through there…” he trotted away, looking upset.
That meant that their last kiss, for now, was muddled in a haze of heat. John couldn’t even remember it properly.
“Here,” John helped him to lie down, arranging their bodies and legs, as they would stay stuck together for at least twenty minutes. He kissed Sherlock’s bond bite again, licking off a line of blood. “Does it hurt?”
“I am safe!” John half-yelled, knowing the man in the lounge could hear him. “Just leave me alone!”
John looked around. “Sherlock told you to find me?”
Reason went out the window.
“Sherlock?”
Rage suddenly boiled over inside him, and he slapped himself. And again. And again, until his right eye began to shut by itself. That was no good. He had to be rid of this.
The box was still unopened.
‘He is an
“No,” the voice growled, low, the alpha smell flooding John’s nostrils even as he tried not to breathe.
“I’m going to tie off,” John pointed at the rocks.
Sherlock nodded. “It… doesn’t feel real. It feels as though dying… isn’t what I’m supposed to do. And this wasn’t how he were supposed to meet.”
John raised the bat and cracked the ball hard to the left.
“I want to get a doctor to look at this graze,” she pointed at his face. “It’s a bit bruised… I don’t want you to have a broken cheekbone, dear.”
John's solution was to shower at school, and head to Sherlock's house. A pattern he'd been following for a couple of weeks, to Sherlock's apparent delight, though John had yet to exchange more than a quick 'hello' to Sherlock's mum or dad before he was dragged up the stairs.
"Stay on your back, John," Sherlock said. “I don’t need you to present to me, and I don’t want you to hide your face. This isn’t something I’m taking from you, it’s something we’re sharing.”
“Past tense?” John grinned.
Waking John up was not, apparently, a simple case of giving him a jab and waiting for him to come around. They rigged up an oxygen mask on his face, and turned off one machine as they turned on another…
Greg scruffed up his bed-hair. “I think you probably are. I know I’d be disappointed if you turned up one day with red eyes and fangs… but also I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t been expecting it to happen one day.” He looked sad. “People give up a lot for people they love. Even if they wouldn’t have, before.”
He would have to go back to the shop, he knew. He needed all that stuff. No – the baby needed it. It needed clothes, and nappies, and a little bath. It needed blankets and bottles. It couldn’t go out and get it itself. It would be entirely helpless.
“Yes,” John said instantly.
John’s appetite, in every sense of the word, suddenly evaporated. “…yeah.”
“Mm,” John mumbled to the soldier beside him. “Can I ask… do you know much about the Royal Medical Corps?”
John didn’t show the leaflet to Sherlock right away. He wasn’t stupid – he knew it would be met with raised eyebrows and worry, and he wanted to have all the information he could before putting forth his proposal. He went onto the website, and read through the information, though he still had a lot of questions. There seemed to be a lot of focus on careers, and not a lot of mention of the fact that you’d be a soldier. He put in his postcode, and saw there was a recruitment evening in a few weeks, and put his name down.
“Yes…” Sherlock lowered the food. “I was worried you were hurt, and upset… about what happened.”
“This one looks messy,” John nodded at the corpse.
Could what?
“Oh god…” Sherlock kissed him again, his tongue drawing a line over John’s lower lip.
“I’m not sure if it’s worth it,” Sherlock said. “It’s… I’d be good at it. But…”
“Toilets for girls and gays,” someone laughed. “Real men on the other side.”
Mates seemed entirely out of the question.
"Oh no, you caught me," John drawled, counting on sarcasm to hide his jolt of fear. "I forgot you can't be mates with someone without wanting to get in their pants. Must be why you've got no friends, Phil."
Sherlock actually took a step backwards, his eyes like saucers.
“What a polite young man you are,” she squeezed his grip and let go. “I’m so happy to meet you, too. And I’m sure Sherlock is.”
‘Sit up, I’ll pass her through your legs.’
“You mean me being pregnant with your brother’s baby?” John raised his eyebrows.
John’s eyes opened. ‘Bleeding? What – like a wound?’
Molly clamped a hand to her mouth. “Oh – I didn’t – I’m sorry –”
“We… we would have gone out,” John said, thinking. “Got coats on, and gone down the woods. Done a campfire in trees, where the ground gets damp so it doesn’t spread. And we could… I don’t know. Try and find some poisonous mushrooms. Or follow that crow that always flew around after us that year. Or so crack some ice puddles. And when it got too cold we could make hot chocolate over the fire. And only go home when the sun started going down. That’s a proper day out.”
Violence / domestic assault, and verbal abuse
“I have to go,” Sherlock rasped.
Their mouths met again, and John cupped Sherlock’s face as they kissed, lips sliding over and over as tongues rolled. John dropped his jaw, letting Sherlock all the way in, letting his alpha consume him, and the rock of Sherlock’s body against his drew more moans from the former soldier.
“I. Don’t. Know.” Sherlock folded his arms. “I don’t know. I don’t want to know. I just want a bed to sleep in, right this moment. And a house that isn’t a crack den, and a flatmate who isn’t going to rob me in my sleep. I thought you might be agreeable to that.”
John stood up, the nervous energy was coursing through him like electricity and
The nurse laughed. “Well, hopefully seeing baby will make up for the strain. Did you want to know the sex?”
“Oh my god,” he put a hand to his abdomen.
The thought was quickly erased as John wrapped two hands around Sherlock’s cock, and began to slowly work him, holding firmly and then loosely, changing his grip and his touch and his rhythm so much that Sherlock couldn’t get control. He really was about to be tormented to orgasm. Pleasure was building inside him, John’s ever-changing fast-then-slow motions meaning Sherlock didn’t know whether to hold off or even how to.
Cam’s face fell. “I see.”
“We’re almost on the bridge,” John said. He took Sherlock’s hand, lifting it and kissing his engagement ring.
“Thanks.”
Sherlock blushed. “O-ok.” He hopped down from the barstool. “I think I might go back to my room… I want to nest the bed, a little.”
“Watson, Holmes is a big boy –”
His new friend.
They were fourteen, now, and they had this game perfected.
"What condition?" Sherlock asked quietly, his voice hard. Dread ran through him, followed shortly by pure and raw anger at his brother. He shoved it all down, for the moment.
“I can deduce. From the location of the pain.”
“Sometimes,” John nodded. “But I’m actually enjoying teaching more than I thought I would.” He inhaled, trying to find something to say, and got a lungful of Sherlock’s empty scent.
“We’re stopping off, on the way,” Sherlock’s dad said, keeping his eyes on the road.
Sherlock murmured, but didn’t wake up.
“Yes,” Sherlock rested his head on the bed, kissing John’s shoulder with chaste little pecks.
He sort of remembered the conversation between the doctor and his mother, but the significance of it would not dawn on him until several years later.
The fight went out of John’s limbs, and he sagged where he stood.
John looked up. “You changed. After that.”
John blinked, a rush of affection, tinted with lust, crashing over him. Sherlock wanted him. Sherlock had demanded him. Gone home to try and find him… Sherlock wanted to mate with him, bond with him, have his children… John let out a soft moan of longing.
“Looks like AB+, but I got blood on the card, so I can’t really tell.”
Sherlock didn’t think much to the start – he didn’t like films that relied on his already scant knowledge of world history, and seemed to have a great deal of references that went over his head. He concentrated on his food, finishing well before John, who was distracted by the soldiers running about onscreen (or maybe it was the glamorous female lead), and thanked goodness for the dark room hiding his body further from his friend.
“About an hour,” John said, watching the cuff tighten and release. “Have you… solved it? Cracked the case?”
“Not really,” Sherlock said. He glanced at the overnight bag. “A little. I suppose.”
“Who else? Hope you don’t mind, Mycroft gave me the address.” He waltzed into the sitting room and deposited the bags on one of the sofas, and himself on the other. “Oh, this is a lovely place. Reeks of alpha, though. How are you getting on?”
"Sherlock," John asked, doing his buttons.
“How would anyone ever… do anything?” Sherlock looked baffled.
"Um..." he glanced at the water lapping at the edge of the rock. He badly needed to piss, but Sherlock lived in the sea. Would it be rude to toilet into the place someone lived, and, presumably, breathed? Should he try and hold it in?
John realised he was crying.
A hand closed around John’s wrist.
“Your brother just rang, they’re stuck in traffic on the M25,” John said. “They’ll be another hour and a half, sorry.”
‘What do you mean?’ Sherlock asked.
“I’m so sorry,” John said again, holding him close. “People change so much when they’re bonded. It’s a mystery. But they do change. Sometimes not for the better.”
What hurt Sherlock the most, in these private moments of grief, was the fact that all the alphas in his life had been right, all along. Omegas did bring this sort of thing on themselves. If he, Sherlock, hadn’t invited John to his darkened house the night of the party, this wouldn’t have happened. If he hadn’t climbed onto John’s knee, this wouldn’t have happened. If he hadn’t undone John’s trousers, this wouldn’t have happened.
“Pish, how do you think your form teacher qualified?”
“…night,” Sherlock nodded.
John stared. He wasn’t entirely sure, but it seemed like Sherlock was saying more than one thing. “Sherlock… what do you mean you understand? Has…”
“I kissed you.”
“No, just… you said
Sherlock put his hands in his pockets. “You don’t have to make me jealous,” he said softly.
“I,” Sherlock said, planting a kiss between each word, “I – am – well – prepared – to – put – in – the – practice…” he kissed down John’s body, down to his bump, scenting over the stretched skin gently, kissing tiny presses of his lips, leaving a trail of goosebumps where he went.
Sherlock turned away from him, his chest heaving. He hauled Lestrade off the floorboards, and licked up his throat, coagulating the wounds though it took moments he knew they did not have. Lestrade was breathing, but his eyes kept closing and he was shaking from head to foot. Sherlock tried to ignore the thrill of swallowing the man’s blood, but after days of starvation himself – and the fact that he had stolen another vampire’s prey through battle – it was all he could do not to finish the job entirely.
‘If he had a track record, though?’ Sherlock said.
The little boy was very smart, and pale, and looked a bit scared, but maybe he was just being polite. He needed to do some playing.
John rutted against Sherlock, his erection already present through his jeans. Sherlock let him take what he wanted, as he did the same, until he was forced to pull away from John to prevent everything from ending far too soon. He lapped at the wound, stopping the blood quickly and dragging his lips up to John's jaw, his hands rubbing down John's back, dipping under his trousers and pants, and squeezing his arse hard.
John thought for a moment, looking between them, at how close they were. He didn't look Sherlock in the eye this time. "Do you want someone to miss you?"
John dropped his toast.
And again.
He made an inhuman noise, his eyes still closed, as he felt pain radiate across his chest, setting his skin and muscles on fire, his bones shattering like broken ice.
John went red. “Why are you laughing, I’m serious!”
And he was, arriving minutes later with a cab, open arms, and a shoulder for Sherlock to sob into.
“You need a jab.”
green light.”
“We’ll need…er…”
Greg frowned. “Interrogation? Anderson?”
And it made desire and need wash through John so acutely that he parted his legs, and looked his mate dead in the eye. “Give it to me, please.”
The alpha on the floor glared. “Like hell I do. What’s he doing here, anyway? Stood on his own, smelling like that? It’s not decent. What is this – some sort of entrapment?”
The thought vanished into thin air.
will never have the looks, will they?”
“But you do.”
“Watson,” Sherlock handed his prescription over. “New. Trainee, actually. But… competent.”
“You sorted somewhere to live?”
“Yeah…” Greg looked embarrassedly at the flowers. “I… wanted to apologise. For being an arse, last night.”
‘I said it wouldn’t be easy to understand,’ Sherlock said. ‘Just… what I want you to think about it that you were the first person I
Their eyes met.
“Mm,” Sherlock snorted.
If the alpha could hear John, he was ignoring him.
he think I'm going to do?"
He hadn’t been back to John for three weeks.
“He…” John had to put his plate down. “He fucking threatened me, ok? He – he scented my
Sherlock went through his homework with him, even setting up a chemistry set in the kitchen so John could do practical work. At least, that was his excuse. Sherlock used the makeshift lab more than John for his ‘cases’.
“Finding you wasn’t my idea,” Mycroft said. “Sherlock asked – well, told – me to.”
It was gone as quickly as he inhaled it.
“Soon. Maybe tonight. It’s not an exact science.”
“But you liked it.”
He woke every morning drenched in sweat.
“You know they want to weigh her again next week?”
“Can we take that as a ‘no’?”
“No!”
John nodded. “I played a game with some other boys. He didn’t like it.”
“And it says on the form you filled in at the desk that you’re bonded… but separated, is that right?”
John found the boy waiting on the sofa in the lounge. He'd been expecting this to happen this year, so only did the smallest of double-takes at the stranger in his flat.
“He won’t,” John said, with a certainty that sent a thrill through Sherlock’s bones. “But this marriage was never meant to exist. It was never meant to happen, Sherlock. Your tutoring of Molly, and saving her experiment, meant that she was able to train as a pathologist. You gave her a focus that wasn’t a relationship. In so many ways, you saved her, Sherlock.”
Sherlock caught John’s hand. “This doesn’t have to be the answer.”
“Uh,” Sherlock put a hand to his chest as he pulled his helmet off. “Ow.”
“Omega girls aren’t so rare, though,” Sherlock frowned.
He picked up his keys and went downstairs.
“Yes,” John snapped. “Yes, I do know.”
“There’s plenty to say,” Sherlock said, and John had a feeling the alpha was only getting started. “How long had this been going on, John?”
Sherlock looked at John. “I’m… not sure…”
His dad nodded. ‘Cuts into a lot of your time, doesn’t it?’
But in John’s house, the party had just started.
It was true he wanted to take this slowly, but it was so bloody difficult when his body wanted one thing and his brain wanted another. Why did he have to be so bloody
John’s cheeks went pink. “I know you don’t like swimming, but you could paddle.”
“Are you going to college?” John asked, after they’d circles the koi pond without saying a word.
“Yeah, you’ve got a bit of a tear, love. Nothing major, but she’ll need a wash in a while.”
John started crying again, hunching over as more slick came.
“The carbonation increases the –” Sherlock started, then stopped. “Yeah, I don’t know, either.”
“But aren’t I am bit… small?” John blushed.
“He… John isn’t my alpha. And he doesn’t tell me what to do. And even if he did, I don’t have to listen.”
“Feeling better?”
Mycroft looked up as John limped down the stairs an hour later.
“Ha… I could do with one of those,” John grinned, ruffling the back of his head.
Telling John they had to stay friends had been like carving his own heart out with a blunt instrument. John had looked devastated. Sherlock knew it was because John didn’t know the truth. John had been ready to forgive Sherlock for being so forward with him, but if he ever found out that Sherlock had tempted Cam into kissing him, laying on top of him… John would never forgive him. And never, ever, want to be with him. John deserved someone who was pure, and good, and didn’t act like Sherlock did, or had.
He nodded, not really knowing who was speaking.
“No,” Sherlock raised a hand. “Can’t…”
John.
Did he love her?
“Ha.” John pressed his body against Sherlock’s. “I mean… if you don’t want me. Even if you don’t know if you ever will –”
Sherlock took John’s hand, and turned it over to rest his fingers on his pulse.
The room seemed very close, and hot, and still, all of a sudden.
He did not expect the smell to point to an omega going into heat.
“Help you?” Victor frowned. “Oh, so you
John let James fall asleep in his bed once it was over, then went to the showers, alpha come running from his entrance as he scrubbed and washed. He didn’t cry, didn’t feel violated, didn’t think he’d been taken advantage of.
Alone would protect him.
Mycroft hummed, and pocketed the paper. He would go to the pharmacy for Sherlock, later. “Good. As long as you get along with them, that’s good.”
And nearly fell down the steps in fright as he saw Sherlock coming up them, two coffees in hand.
“Oh… Oh, god, yes,” John helped Sherlock up, and they quickly dived onto Sherlock’s bed, John popping his jeans button open as they arranged themselves on top of the covers, on their sides, facing each other.
But this seemed to be ok.
“Shit, that’s extreme,” Sholto sat beside him. “So... you’re not…” he looked at John’s throat.
“Have you lost consciousness at all?”
Mycroft and Sherlock, driving through the night.
“You really need to do proper training,” the beta told Sherlock, handing him a coffee in a paper cup as they stood beside the forensics van. “Get a degree in forensic science, or something.”
“You could fight me off.”
“Fucking hell, John.”
John picked up the mugs and brought them over to the coffee table, sitting beside Sherlock on the sofa. “I… I think it’s an alright idea. It’d give you something to do in the school holidays. You still have six weeks to kill, after all…” he hesitated, a niggling worry starting in his mind.
“Before you go,” John said, quickly putting his decaf tea down, “can you come up, for a moment?”
Months dropped off the calendar, and John noticed his relationship with the young omega settling from frightened distance to close company, where they would sometimes sit together on the sofa, but never touching. John had meant what he said about leaving Sherlock alone, and Sherlock seemed grateful for it. He passed the summer exams easily, and when school broke up for eight weeks of holiday, John took four of them off with him.
John stared at him, eyes roaming over his exposed skin.
Sherlock stayed still, and John watched as gooseflesh rose on his pale skin, the rose-pink around his nipple tensing and contracting as the central bud hardened, without direct touch.
They didn’t speak during the ride.
“We had trouble from the start,” Victor sipped his drink. “Bleeding, and throwing up, and pains… She went on bedrest for a bit, and she got better… we were just going shopping for a pram…”
, or anything. Why should you want… revenge?”
“I know,” a smiling voice replied.
“No.”
John turned away, and didn’t look back.
He was let go, and fell hard to the floor. He tried a breath, and heard the terrible bubbling whistle of his broken airway. He was going to pass out.
John couldn’t touch him. He was an adult, an alpha, a doctor for crying out loud.
“So. You left him?”
“I’m fine,” she said. “Same as I was five minutes ago. Stop spinning around, Julian, you’re distracting Greg.”
“You have a mate?” John asked.
“And maybe,” John interrupted, “someone could do a better job than me.”
“No.”
“You say he doesn’t want to be with you, but you have been bonded a long time?”
“And if he offers?” Sherlock countered.
The morning after, and Sherlock has a realisation.
And then it was October, and John was doing mock-exams and staying up until 2am with revision.
The jovial mood didn’t last. As evening came around, and Sherlock had called Inspector Lestrade (and been cheerfully invited go to down to the station twice a week to ‘assist’), his mood seemed to dip. He curled up on the sofa in a corner, checking his phone every few moments, knees up under his chin, feet bare and flat on the sofa cushion.
He stepped aside as the major's eyes clouded over, and he did as he was told, walking slowly from the cafeteria, like a zombie.
But he could
John didn’t make eye contact, keeping his book raised as if he hadn’t noticed his pregnant mate waddling through the room in search of clothes.
He pushed it away.
John stroked down Sherlock’s skin, to his hips, gripping him tight, feeling the tight and firm flesh under his fingers. His Sherlock, so tight around his cock. John’s knot was already starting to swell.
They wandered out, Sherlock still holding his champagne flute like a talisman. The garden wasn’t deserted, but it was quieter, and there was no one standing by the old tree house, so the boys walked over and looked up at it as though examining their childhood den.
He pulled off his tops, giving the hoody a sniff before curling his lip and lobbing the sweater into the laundry basket. He gave himself a glance in the mirror.
“Why?” Victor laughed out. “Have – have you met you? You’re… amazing. And beautiful, and clever, and rude, and…” he touched the omega’s hair. “And I’ve been falling for you since that first Biology lesson. I just can’t hold it in, anymore.”
“Oh, god!”
“Oh, something in construction, I believe. They had something to do with building the new houses around the village not so long ago.”
“…Sherlock Holmes.”
At the Christmas table
Sherry looked stricken immediately. “John?!”
“The patients seem to really like you, John,” Sarah said, one evening. “I think it’s nice for some of the younger people to see a male omega in a position of authority, too.”
So when the door slammed, and Sherlock yelled “John!” in a broken cry, John could only wail in reply.
John passed a hand over his face as he remembered what he’d done in the past forty-eight hours. No one to look after him, or bring him food or water as he used to do for Eurus, his condition had worsened until his temperature became shockingly high, and his cramps so painful he was wretching bile as fast as he was desperate for an alpha.
"Ohhhhh fuck," he gripped harder. "Sort of regretting this now."
“More than a year,” Sherlock said, thinking of twelve more periods. “And then I might have to get on a waiting list. I was counting on…”
“Not really,” Sherlock said, stroking down John’s arm. “It’s warm.”
They tried, because they were stuck with him.
“John –”
“Yes, but…” Sherlock hugged the cushion harder. “I miss him. I…” he screwed up his face, hard, fighting back the threatening tears. His throat and chest hurt, and he wanted to scream into the cushion, throw it at his brother, tell him to fuck off, beg him to hold him.
“How else can I find out what the hell is going on?” Sherlock climbed the steps and rang the doorbell. “It’s not as though –” he looked around, and John had vanished.
“What do you think?” John pointed with both hands as his stomach. “Matter of fucking time, wasn’t it?”
John gave a tiny smile. “Be a good friend, I guess. And help me off this sofa. I’m going to bed.”
The way Sherlock's control crumbled in John's hands, he couldn't deny his feelings for the man. He couldn't hide them. He wouldn't. If John asked, he'd say everything that was building up inside him, although he doubted he needed to.
Nothing at all.
John's eyes went wide, and he looked shocked. "Oh god. Sherlock, I - I didn't mean to say I think you're-"
‘You’re welcome.’ Mycroft sounded tense. ‘Sherlock, I’m sending a car, and a place ticket. I need you to come home.’
Sherlock’s hands slipped on the railing, and he panicked, gripping hard and cursing his body’s failure to simply let himself fall. He looked around.
“One which my sons are accustomed to,” she nodded. She looked at Sherlock. “You look beautiful, darling. Omega-wear suits you.”
“Now, here’s the facts, John Watson. You’re going to die. What Sebastian started, I finished. You’ve so little blood in you that you’re fucked. Oh? How are you still conscious, you ask? Well… that’s a little talent of mine. It’s sort of like hypnosis, but for blood. I can make your body divert your bloodstream to wherever I see fit. And I like my victims to be conscious and aware right until the very last second. I’ve got very good at it. And so, I want you to be able to see and hear, but I don’t need you to be able to stand, or use your arms.”
“He’s new,” Sherlock got into the cab. “’E’s from America. E’s clever, ‘e takes my biology class.”
“Nice to meet you, Sherlock.”
They walked past the Yard, and onwards through the hot streets to the closest pub that also served food. Greg ordered a curry and lager, and John a plate of steak and chips, and a -
“Sherlock.”
John went rigid, his heart thundering in his chest, stomach clenching, arms and legs buzzing with adrenaline as the older alpha man took his nose from the omega’s skin.
And then, at least once during the holidays, Sherlock would have to go out.
‘A bit.’
“Less of that, Mrs Hudson will think you’re getting a different sort of birthday present,” Sherlock smirked.
She nodded, and scribbled a note. “My advice is to eat what you feel like eating. Even if it’s dry bread and cheese. What you want, when you want it, until this sickness passes. Calories in.”
“But…”
Sherlock nodded. He put the book down, and moved the largest parcel over. It was obviously a laptop, but Cam didn’t need to know he knew that. He unwrapped it carefully, making a false cry of surprise at the contents as he lifted the box out.
John shook his head.
“It was either that or get HR involved. This way you’re safe, you’ve got a wage, and no one will ask you questions. What do you think?”
“Feeling a bit poorly, are we?” the voice came closer, and John made out a figure in a dark suit, with a pale face. He tried to concentrate on the features of the face, but struggled. “Having some vision problems? How about now?”
“If my mate is with someone else,” John went on, teasing, “maybe I should be, too.”
John spluttered. “But…. Right. What did you say?”
? He went back to his book. No chance of asking… his parents were on the opposite side of the pool, and Mycroft was to the edge, still in his suit trousers and shirt, though he’d taken off his tie as proof that he was on holiday, even if he was typing away on his laptop.
“Everyone worries about the pregnant people,” she sighed. “We’re not made of glass. My alpha’s started walking me to the door of the school, can you believe?”
Sherlock turned a page in his book without really seeing it. John had said he liked him, yes. But why? And how? John couldn’t scent him, couldn’t sense Sherlock’s hormonal changes… what was it he liked? And why?
“I know,” Charles smiled, though his pale eyes stayed the same – a sort of dead stare that was one moment away from giving Sherlock the creeps. “Still, maybe Father Christmas will be good to you.”
“Look, I know might be somewhere close to the mark,” Greg said, tearing his naan, “but we’re going to be looking for a full-time medic in a week or so. Doctor Brown is leaving us for greener pastures, and…” he left the sentence hanging.
John’s eyes shone. “Or? Sherlock – Sherlock are you telling me there’s a way out of this?”
John looked at his hands. “Your dad…”
He glanced over, giving his friend a tiny smile.
“Oh, fuck!” Sherlock cried, suddenly writhing to both get away and get John further inside. “Oh, fuck, was that –”
“Well, he died before you were born, darling, and you know how I feel about dusty old pictures around the house. Too many sad memories when the house should be decorated with happy ones.”
“Naturally,” Greg smiled, watching the pregnant omega hand the samples to a waiting officer, put a hand to his back and puff out a breath. “He looks well.”
"All mine," Sherlock reciprocated, though it couldn't have been more insincere.
John yelped, then moaned loud as Sherlock indulged himself further, and Sherlock found he no longer cared that the noise might flood into the ears of the other humans amongst them.
“I can delete it,” Sherlock shrugged.
"You didn't."
The doorbell rang, and John went to collect the food, calling for Sherlock as he went back into the kitchen.
“I do, but I don’t want to go out.”
The panics soon wore off, though, and Ryan came out of his sulky shell, taking four days off a month from then on, so routine it became boring.
John collected his suitcase from behind the front desk, and lugged it to his hotel-style room, feeling miserable. The tiny hostel was rarely used, as its only designation was for omegas discharged from the armed forces. John was the only person house at the moment, and even the front desk was abandoned – he had to call and wait for a beta woman to come and unlock his things from a safety box.
They glanced at one another, and looked away, shyly.
“Don’t make promises you can’t keep,” John said gently. “I just want us. I want to be a proper family. I want to kiss you and love you and – and everything else, not just in claiming, or heat. I miss you being gentle with me. I miss it all. I… I just want you, Sherlock. I love you so fucking much it kills me.”
“It isn’t that I don’t want to see my sister,” Sherlock said quickly. “It’s… the last time I saw her, she… told me things.”
“Who are you?” Lestrade picked up his drink and held it closer to him, as if Sherlock was about to spike it.
Sherlock swung his bag onto his back. “Mycroft.”
The touches skimmed through the cleft of his arse, and John felt wetness travel with it, up and down, feeling with utmost care, until finding the tense, taut skin of his entrance, and stroking tiny circles over the drawn skin.
John had to admit, Sherlock would probably be kind. He had been, when John was sick in the past. He ran a hand over his chest, noticing that his nipples had darkened, just a little. His stomach was still flat, but had lost some of the definition it had had twelve weeks ago. And crunches weren’t recommended in the second trimester. John sighed, and poked himself. He was going to miss his washboard stomach. Omegas were expected to be soft and curvy, and John never had been – a lifetime of sports and exercise, along with his genes, had seen to that. At least he could keep his arms and legs in check. He made a mental note to go to the gym after work.
John considered. “Did you know?”
John smiled a little bit. "You really are trying to romance me." He paused. "What do you mean by the way relationships are carried out today? What was it like for you when you were… before?"
“Who…” he stopped as he looked up at the wrong shape. “Eurus?”
They went through the gates, and John drifted with Mike to the group of boys he know from last year. They were all Year Eight, now, and (mostly) taller than the titchy Year Sevens milling about in the yard. John was one exception, his omega blood determining he was always going to be of shorter stature, but he was as broad as the other boys, he was pleased to notice.
“You didn’t need to do this,” John said.
John nodded, sniffing deeply at Sherlock’s chest, beyond caring how close he was, and what the gesture meant. He didn’t care. He didn’t care Sherlock had had some other omega. He didn’t care.
“Well,” Sherry leaned forward, conspiritally. “Maybe we don’t have to tell him.”
“Just put your bag in our room, for now,” John sighed. “We’ll sort it out later. Come on, I need to eat something before I pass out.”
“Vetted them personally, have you?”
“Do. Now, can I see the pictures of your scan?”
When John came in, he still looked like shit, though less noticeable to those who hadn't seen him earlier. He spoke to the chef, who gave him a cup of strong coffee before he walked over to Sherlock. Sherlock watched him with an irritated eye as John sat down.
John caught his eye, and gave him a small smile. “Good morning.”
“Go back to sleep,” Sherlock said. “We don’t have to rush. I’ll be here when you wake up.”
John smiled, and kissed around to Sherlock’s mouth. “Happiness.”
Once back in the room, Sherlock lay back on his bed and John wheeled in a portable ultrasound machine.
John’s heart was in his mouth as they followed Mycroft. The cheeky look had drained off Sherlock’s face, and he was pale.
“Sherlock… Tell me,” John broke the kiss again to make eye-contact. “Tell me, if you want me to stop. Tell me, and I’ll stop. I’ll let you go. But I want… you,” he sighed, pressing his forehead against the omega’s, his body aching with the need to touch closer, firmer, faster. “Tell me, Sherlock.”
“First time,” John same over, taking him in his arms. “Overdue. Your muscles aren’t used to it… Fuck, you smell incredible,” he kissed Sherlock on the throat, on those old scars that had never faded, then began licking at the same spot, tasting the sweat on Sherlock’s skin, the heady pheromones flooding his system, the fertility he now possessed… “I love you, oh god, you’re my omega. I love you. Sherlock…”
Maybe John Watson liked boys, too. Maybe that’s why he’d been so overly friendly. That’d be…
“So you win, either way.”
“What the hell was that?” he snapped, stinking of alpha indignation.
John, and a few of his doctor friends, attended the funeral the council arranged for the man. He was cremated, and his ashes buried without a marker (as there was no one to pay for one) in the cemetery close to the hospital.
“What did you think I was doing in the army?” John shook his head.
“Magic.”
Ah. A solution, then.
Justice Graves sniffed. “I understand that Sherlock is still at university. Now, it says here that the two of you are lodging with Mycroft Holmes, is that correct?”
“Um, I was wondering if you had anything stronger than paracetamol,” John touched his head again. “This headache just won’t shift.”
John sniffed. “Right.” He grabbed the spoons and cutlery off the side. “I’ll do the table, then.” He brushed past Sherlock without looking at him, and dumped the utensils on the table-top.
“Sure,” John gave Sherlock such a trusting smile, that Sherlock wanted to sob.
Neither of them had spoken for a good minute.
“You don’t have to thank me,” John smiled. “But you’re welcome. I’ll see you in a minute.” He closed the door almost shut, and went back down the stairs.
Sherlock nodded, putting a hand flat to John’s sternum, and splaying his fingers like a star. “Thank you.”
The door opened a fraction wider. “I’m sorry, do I know you..?”
“When you open the door, you’ll…” Mycroft swallowed, “you’ll be affected. You’ll have to move fast. Close that window, and…”
“No, only get my twelve-week scan tomorrow,” John mused. “They can tell you at the twenty-week, if you want to know.”
Sherlock blinked at the hand, before taking it, and shaking firmly, once.
John’s face fell. “Oh.” He suddenly felt very stupid, standing in shorts and knee-length socks.
“Well,” John had stammered, “I was on… for a long time… I mean, it’s all there in my file. I was in the army, and I had military-grade suppressants… I didn’t even think I
Sherlock had to smile. "That... sounds delightfully 1950s."
“Sure,” John kissed his mate on the forehead, and went to pour in the mixture.
“Here,” John handed over the little pot of pee. “Feels weird to be on the giving side of the pisspot, I have to say.”
John pulled the hanger back through, and looked at it again, trying to work out where his legs were meant to go in it. He put it on the ‘yes’ pile, and decided to worry about it later.
And oh, the price had been so high.
John got a coffee (ordering decaf through some weird knee-jerk that made him half-hate his subconscious), and sat on one of the benches in the park, thinking.
“If you say so…” John raised a hand, and brushed Sherlock’s curls off his face, without thinking about it.
John frowned, and leaned to look.
Was he?
“Know what?” John asked, his insides suddenly tense, and ice-cold.
“No,” John shook his head. “Sherlock, come on. It’s me. I’m not an idiot, and I was a soldier, I’ve been trained to diffuse difficult situations.”
? John frowned, then looked back at Sherlock with new eyes.
John held him gently. “It’s normal, to miss your family. It’s ok to feel sad.”
“He was. Just about. They took him away. I don’t know where he is, now.”
Sherlock was looking from the man on the floor to Cam with an expression on his face that John could not read.
“Sherlock.”
John lowered his cup. “Is this really teatime conversation?”
Sherlock nodded. “Yes… sir.”
Sherlock stood on the top step. He heard voices, then raised voices, and then the door opened again, this time the chain being wrenched right out of the door.
John stroked his thigh before bending to kiss the soft flesh. ‘You’re so good for me, Sherlock. Won’t be long now, my love.’
