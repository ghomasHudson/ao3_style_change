“Kiss my ass,” Bobby taunts, and in a lower tone he says to Dean, “if we board up the windows, block their views, we can buy some time.”
Cas moans softly while Dean speaks, and Dean’s stomach does flip-flops, “Words mean very little when I can feel your soul.”
“I wanted to bring you out of Purgatory,” Dean confesses, “because I want you around, Cas. I— fuck, the times you died? That I thought you were gone? Almost killed me, man. But I hear you, I do. Sometimes shit feels— it’s too much.”
“You ain’t exactly all normal either, after purgatory,” Bobby reminds him.
“I… I don’t want to be a dick, but like, is this just being horny?” Dean asks, “you said yourself that you’re still new to emotions, and that you get confused about me sometimes.”
“I thought the interrogation was happening over dinner,” Dean reminds him.
had a shitload of heaven’s doctrines embedded in him even after he thought he’d gotten free of them all!”
Dean doesn't have words to help. He knows what his Dad would say, what Dean thinks he should say, and Dean knows that it's not what Cas needs. Dean doesn't even know what Cas needs, what he should hear to help him. And Dean he… god his heart is breaking for Cas, but Dean's broken in so many ways and there's nothing he can do that will solve this.
Now Dean shucks off his jeans. He kicks them off the edge of the bed. Normally Dean likes to keep his underwear on until the last possible second, but he’s kind of gross right now so off it goes too.
“We are, and we always will be,” she says, and she levels Dean with an angry glare, “but you and I both know how big his heart is. Things get complicated when a vampire gets a second life.”
And that does it. That seals it. Dean pulls onto the shoulder of the road. The wheels protest as he comes to a sharp stop. He’s putting baby in park even as he’s grabbing Cas to kiss him.
. This should be leading to them getting in each others’ faces, to pushing and shoving and saying mean things they’ll regret later. Sam isn’t getting up. He’s not… why isn’t he mad?
“I didn’t know it was fucking
“Is there like, I don’t know, a big bee farm out there?” Dean guesses, “there’s a big ball of twine, there’s gotta be a big bee place too.”
“Why isn’t he waking up?”
“I do,” Cas agrees, and drops his gaze just as Dean’s stomach drops, “I haven’t stopped. I’m sorry about that.”
“Death kept him from dying. Said he’d need time to recover,” Bobby reminds him, and he pushes past Dean to help Sam get his arms free. As soon as he touches him, Sam startles and dives away. He doesn’t get very far, so it’s easy for Bobby to wrangle him before Sam hurts himself. Dean wants to help, but he can’t do anything without letting go of Cas’ hand and he’s not ready for the ache of having his soul pulled out of him.
“Or he got lucky,” Dean says. Cas is trying to build up to the fact that he thinks Sam’s crazy was speaking the truth.
“Dean, I’m on your side,” Bobby soothes.
"Deal with leverage after Cas is back on his feet," Bobby argues, "Crowley's a slippery bastard, but he might be able to help."
person. He took on Lucifer with his bare hands and saved the world. But Sam and Dean are big names in the otherworld. Hell always wants to have a claim on Sam. What if the demons get him, and take him back to Lucifer?
Dean falls into the tunnel-sighted focus he gets when the stakes are high. He’s got a job to do, and he’s going to see it through.
“Interesting,” Cas comments, “the taste is… bland.”

on him?
“So let’s sleep. And deal with this when we wake up,” Dean decides.
Maybe Sam can understand
“You saved my soul, way back when we first met,” Dean reminds him, “and I— I’m sorry I can’t save you from this in the same way. But I’m here, Cas. I’ve got your back, okay? We’re gonna get you out of this.”
Cas shakes his head, “No. Basking is close enough. I think.”
with Cas, that energy, so that’s gotta be what makes Dean’s brain skip a few beats when he thinks about Cas. Dean’s not used to people who come back for him.
most of the things his father tried to stop him from being. But with some time, with some distance, he knows that Dad was wrong. All that lying, and hiding the truth from everyone? Holding power tight, using absolutes to rule. That wasn’t the way to deal with this, with people you care about.
At least, right up until Benny pulls Dean’s dick out of his jeans, holds their dicks together tightly in one hand. Gets Dean’s pants down low enough that his ass is out for Benny to grab, digging all five fingertips into Dean’s skin in a way that’s gonna leave bruises later.
“Close your eyes!” Cas shouts, and Dean barely has time to obey before hot white light fills the room.
“What the

“Could you eat something with, you know, love in it?”
“So that’s why you love me? Because you like my soul?” Dean checks.
“He took it out on me, I know,” Sam scoffs.

“The spell Sam used on Naomi; it’s an archangel’s spell,” Cas says, carefully not saying
Cas yanks him by the collar of his shirt and kisses him. It’s not soft like how Dean kissed him, Cas kisses him hard enough that their noses squish together, that Dean has to adjust the angle of his head but Cas doesn’t give him any space to move, and then
Cas shakes his head, “I don’t— I need grace.”
“How did you fix that? Oh— hey, hey,” Bobby pats Sam’s face, gives him a small shake, as Sam passes out and goes limp.
“Just turn off the notifications or delete the aps,” he tells her.
“Head stuff?” Dean checks.
“Did you fix everything?”
Dean takes the gun from him, aims, and shoots Crowley in the face. The recoil hurts like a bitch and Dean clicks his teeth together to keep from swearing.
Dean steels himself with three quick breaths, and nods once, “Okay. Okay. Do it.”
Dean leads the way, moreso because he needs to make sure Sam is actually put in a bed and not wherever Cas dumps him. And he opens the bedroom door, cause Cas kinda has his hands full carrying Sam’s ragdoll form. Not really, but it’s a courtesy thing.
“Emotional, spiritual stuff,” Sam grimaces, “but like, it means I
Dean falls back onto habit immediately. Deny everything.
“Hey, I thought you were staying late—”
“Dean,” Cas croaks. Of course he’s mad about the shirt. Dean will buy him more, later.
It isn’t enough.
Cas says no. He always says no.
God, he's just as hot as Dean remembers and Dean's stomach does flip-flops at the sight of him. Dean stomps it down. He's putting all his shit into nice little boxes and hiding it away to be unpacked never. He’s not queer anymore. This is a great time for him to work on that.
Welcome back!

happy. It makes me feel like I have found a home.”
Dean shakes his head, but Sam speaks up, “They’re family. Whatever— whatever you’re telling us, we’re going to tell them. They might as well stay.”
“You’re impossibly annoying like this,” Death growls. He lowers the cane as he moves towards Cas. Dean remains magically frozen in place.
They need to run. Cas is holding the angels off, but it’s still two against one, and Dean isn’t sure if he can walk, and he doesn’t think Sam can carry him right now but they have to get gone—
The words start pouring out before Dean can think to stop them. Because if he doesn’t talk now, he’s never going to talk, and he needs to talk if he’s going to have any chance of saving face, “No, yeah, fuck. I’m with Cas. But nothing has changed, I swear. It’s— you won’t even notice. But shit like this has a habit of coming back to bite me in the ass, and I wanted you to hear it from me. I should have told you before, but I don’t— I didn’t want to put this on you. But you deserve to know. And I get it if you never want to speak to me again, I’ll respect that, but Sam doesn’t have anything to do with this, and he doesn’t have a lot of family—”
It always comes back to family, doesn’t it?
Dean wants to kiss him so badly.
Bobby walks behind him in case Dean falls backwards. The stairs are a bitch on his knees, and Dean takes the last few at a run. He almost drops Sam in relief as he makes it to the landing. His back hurts!
“How do I know you aren’t lying? Prove it.”
There’s discussion of position— how do they want to do this? In the porn Dean saw it a few ways, and he thinks if he’s on all fours that might go best. Cas wants Dean on his back so they can keep kissing. And because Cas wants to see Dean’s face.
Dean takes a quick peek.
Relief lodges itself like a knife in Dean’s throat, and Dean can’t risk waking Sam up again, not when his brother looks like he’s genuinely, truly
He doesn’t know how long he sleeps. When he wakes, he thinks that maybe it’s because he heard something. It’s still purgatory’s constant, unending twilight so the light hasn’t changed. Dean is surprisingly warm for sleeping on stone ground. He waits, listens. Holds his weapon at the ready.
“Now you’re being rude,” Dean accuses, and freezes as soon as the words leave his mouth. Death regards him with a slow turn of his head, so Dean adds on a squeaky, “with respect, sir. What— what are you saying is happening to my brother? You need to explain everything.”
He looks sideways at Cas, at this face he’s come to associate with the angel, and gets the sense that he’s a fish looking at a light. And he has no idea how big or dangerous those teeth might be. Or when they're gonna snap at him.
time Benny will fuck him.
How the FUCK do you eat an archangel????? SAM???? SAM WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU BABY BOY?????????????????
Red hot anger surges through Dean’s stomach. Right into his fists. He wants to start swinging.
“You treat him well,” Bobby bulldozes him, “because if you fuck this up, Dean Winchester, I’m gonna have to kick your ass.”
When they finally drag themselves out of bed and down to the kitchen in search of something to eat, it’s nearer what most people would consider lunchtime rather than time for breakfast. It doesn’t matter; the circumstance of an all too eventful day yesterday and the dreary weather are both forgiving, allowing for hours spent lazily exploring each other and talking of nothing in particular while running fingers through messy hair.
“Oh yeah, I can see that. And you know with the whole being a fantasy writer I guess that kinda comes automatically, huh? In any case, it was really cool what you did with the Leviathans, having them be able to take human form and eat people! So creepy! Oh, also, question! My friends and I have discussed this, the baurach used to hurt the Leviathans so they can be killed, is it really borax?”
Castiel pauses and sips his tea. Dean moves closer to him, thighs pressed together, and puts his arm around Castiel. Charlie looks at him, clutching her coffee cup in silence.
“Great! I think we’re done here in that case. Dean, should we load the last stuff into the van?”
“Cas, you okay there, buddy? If you don’t want the beer I can take the bottle to Sammy instead.”
“Yeah, he somehow thought that it wouldn’t go well with the investors,” Charlie says and shrugs. “Anyway, I’m not supposed to babble on about myself all day.” Her hands leave the mug and she pushes her hair behind her ears. “Where was I? Oh right. So, AI has been around for quite a long while and the development is really astonishing. Of course, like so many other things, it really started in the military, and then it moved on to advance in the fields of banking and finance, followed by medicine. Us university folks and businesses catering to the normal everyday people are a bit behind what they can achieve right now. It’s not really that strange, those are the areas with the most funding. A lot of technology we have now start off being related to the military or for the purpose of making rich guys even more money, before it sorta trickles down to us mortals. But it’d be reeeally interesting to know what the dudes and dudettes in uniforms are working on right now. Or even what they did a year or two ago.”
straight, those are human labels. But there is that bond there with Dean, yes, which means that they would’ve ended up together even if Dean been a starfish or something. What? Bestiality not allowed? Oh, so you’ll write all these debauched orgys of Cas sucking cock and fucking pie or whatever, but no starfishfuking? Oh, okay then. Well, you know what? Cas tops. Dean’s
Emmy is standing in the corner of the room, the fire circle around her only just big enough for her to stand in, her hands bound behind her and another length of rope looped around her head as a gag. She’s staring at him with those huge blue eyes, flames reflected horribly in their depths, a cut on her forehead bleeding sluggishly and the skin around it dark and bruised. Other than that she looks okay though, and Dean feels a tiny bloom of relief in his chest.
He figures the more he repeats Cas's name the more it'll bug him - he has no idea how prayers work, but names have power and Cas always turns up when Dean prays using his full name.
“Dean.
Misha: I have to say though, I think Jared’s better.

"It could be a he."
Castiel knows this, just as he knows that humans see the sky as blue and the grass as green. Moments ago as humans measure time, he stood vesseled in Lisa Braeden's bedroom and soothed away Dean Winchester's nightmares, eased Lisa back into sleep where Dean's thrasing and broken, choked sobs of his brother's name had woken her. Standing there in the dark he had seen Dean's dream again - Sam on the same rack Dean himself had suffered upon, with the same tortures being vistited upon him as he stared at Dean, severed tongue rendering him unable even to cry out to him - and in that moment he had been unable to understand why Sam Winchester should remain in Lucifer's Cage when it caused Dean so much pain. A heartbeat later he had cast off his vessel and plunged down into the Pit.
The angel that used to be in charge of Dean steps forward, hand raised, and Emmy doesn’t move, staring fearlessly up at him with furious eyes, daring him to try it.
cas is a theology/religious studies professor with a focus on early-middle eastern religions. he speaks (well, reads) like six different languages, enochian and aramaic and hebrew and old egyptian and probably some old arabic, and he's passable at latin and ancient greek. he turns up at dean's work because their latest killer is a religious nutjob who's relying on satanic/esoteric rituals as settings for his killings, and who leaves messages in enochian(?) at the kill sites, and cas is in the area giving a talk to the local university.
Cas was still not looking at him, apparently waiting for him to make the first move, so Dean sat on the edge of the bath and rolled his trousers up to his knees, then dropped his legs down to skim the bubbles with his toes, kicking idly at the bigger ones as they went by. “Stop being an ass, Cas.”
"Be too busy chowing down on that to bother us," Dean insists, because dammit he's comfortable here.
“Yeah, and of course, it’ll rip all our throats out as soon as it can stand on its own four legs,” Bobby says loudly, silencing them, and Crowley shrugs one shoulder, mouth twitching.
, dude. At least do the sphinx thing lying down. I’m pretty sure we’re not allowed pets in here whatever, but we’re
Dean huffs where he's plastered against Cas's chest, inhaling the angel's non-scent - Cas doesn't smell like aftershave or showergel, sweat or ozone, salt or incense; if anything, he smells like water tastes, clear and light and blank. "It's okay, dude, I'm fine. Don't treat me like I'm broken."
“Dee...” Sam breathes, unwilling to make a bad impression on his new nephew by talking too loud. “Wow.” His hand hovers, irrationally cautious, then he finally settles it carefully on the baby’s back. His skin is soft and smooth and so
“He declared himself a false god,” the same angel says, eerily, insanely calm. Though it’s wearing Mrs Graham, it’s obvious she isn’t home right now. “Precedent says that this is the punishment to fit such a crime. He has chosen to live amongst humans, so by human rules shall he die.”
Daniel's little smile flashes again. "Yes, 'oh'. Contrary to what the angels may have told you, Dean Winchester, not everything is, in fact, about you."
“And these,” Sheriff Mills says quietly, moving Dean a little to the right, and what the guy is photographing is Cas’s stupid fake glasses, smashed and twisted on the floor.
heavily implied. “Also, in case you haven’t noticed, we have our future to worry about. What we do in school now will affect our career options later.”
His first instinct, once she’s down, is to scoop the bird-daemon up and put him in Cas’s lap, but that won’t help any and it might just cause more trauma. “
Hogsmeade station was lit bright and welcoming when they pulled in, and as they got off onto the platform, Dean glad they didn’t have to haul their trunks off again with them this time, a voice rang out. “Firs’ years, come this way! Over here please, firs’ years!”
Dean Winchester is not what Bethany was expecting.
It all happens so fast.
When he wakes Tsalia is drowsing, and the moment she registers he's awake her eyes close completely and her whole body goes slack. He takes the few steps to the stream and splashes his face, takes a drink, washes his jacket free of blood and drapes it over Tsalia to dry because she's the warmest thing in miles. Then he finds the blooded hunk of whatever she's been dragging round by one of her paws and, curious, washes it clean, revealing the shining black bone of a monstrous claw, apparently ripped right out of its bed for him.
?” he slurs, pushing himself up, and Sam makes a quiet little sobbing noise Dean remembers from when he was little and had nightmares and folds himself down to bury his head in Dean’s shoulder. “Uh. Sammy, Sammy hey, what is it, are you hurt?” He prises Sam away enough to look at him in the dark, pushing impatiently at the curtains behind him with one hand until they part enough to let him see Sam’s white face and the tear tracks. “Jesus Sam, what-?”
“Yeah,” Sam says. Everything’s spinning again, so he closes his eyes on the darkness and the blazing trails of dying angels. His mouth feels like it’s detached from his body, like he’s hearing stuff and replying to it later. “She’s only about 32 weeks. It’s not- she hasn’t been tested for anything, she hasn’t had any check-ups.”
"You too?" Dean hisses, looking somewhere between stunned, betrayed and lost, and Sam shrugs.
“CERTAINLY!” the mistletoe booms cheerfully. “PROPER KISSING, MIND. WITH TONGUE.”
next thing he knows, they're not at bobby's anymore - yet another warehouse probably, and dean continues his tirade until cas gets bored and tells him to STFU. he will, however, answer dean's question - he got sick and tired of the other angels' failure to understand free will even after he invested a lot of time and effort into trying to make them, so he figures they're outmoded and he needs some kind of hybrid, like he was post s5, because it was his spending time with humans that he thinks made him get free will. dean snaps that he could've just gone all holy spirit and knocked up some chick, distasteful though he finds the idea, and cas looks equally unimpressed and says something ike "but dean, you're my favourite, and you're the one who taught me what it means to be human, it had to be you." he ripped out the shreds of his grace, but they were broken and ruined and he needed something to knit them together - voila dean's soul, which he already has a ~profound bond with. he cleansed the grace of all traces of memory and personality that made the angel castiel, leaving only the connection with dean (because he needed it and also it was pretty tightly embedded) and took it down to him. the grace burrowed down deep, relieved to be away from the monster souls and with someone it recognised/loved, and healed itself by siphoning energy from dean's soul. the better it got, the more energy it needed, and also it still requires a certain bloodline as its host, or dean will end up like nick. luckily, it's now big/healed enough to remove and place in its own vessel.
“Pssh,” Dean says, forcing himself back onto his feet; Sam won’t be in the shower forever. Cas stands with him, like one of those sped-up films of trees growing. “Everyone there walks around in bikinis and everything’s a beach - what’s not to like?”
They come down together, Cas’s eyes fading back to normal and Dean wiping the mess on his hand off on Cas’s stomach so he can get both hands back on Cas’s wings; Cas shivers and does something that has Dean hissing at the over-stimulation and pulling at the feathers in retaliation. Cas grumbles wordlessly and shifts, letting Dean pull out and then half-sliding, half-collapsing off him, ending up on his stomach with one wing sprawled possessively across Dean from collarbones to thighs.
Castiel frowns. "It's where monsters go when they die, and also serves as a prison for those creatures too old and powerful for Hell."
“...What the hell happened last night.”
"Shh Cas, I got you."
"Fuck fuck
The body crumples and Iope jumps free and onto Dean’s shoulders, little hands cupping his face. Sam feels the pins-and-needles wrongness of it washing over his own palms and up his arms but Tsalia is panting at his feet, eyes slitted half shut. Surely Dean just got knocked into the wall a bit hard, rattled his brains; they’re not as young as they used to be, after all. Sam starts towards him.
“Metaphorically, of course,” Balthazar adds. “Being as how you aren’t
“Ah, realization dawns,” Balthazar says cheerfully. “It really was an excellent party, you know.”

fae!Cas AU. He got Dean out of hell cause he doesn't want earth destroyed, and takes a lot of amusement in baiting uriel and zachariah when they turn up. like alastair, he refers to them as 'you celestials', and he's a weird mix of 2014!cas and normal. 'cas' is the name he gives them to call him, though zachariah finds out his true name and then the winchesters know it too, though they only use it as a summoning aid. cold iron works as well as the banishing sigil, esp as the winchesters tend to have it around more readily than blood.
, Cas," he hisses, digging both heels into the bed for better purchase to shove up into Cas's hand, and Cas makes a vaguely disapproving rumble low in his throat. "Sorry, fuck, don't you dare stop, this is all your fault anyway, magic - nuhhh - mojo whatever, fuckin'-"
“Yeah, they’re French hens,” Sam agrees, sounding a little muffled. When Dean turns round, he looks like he’d like to bury his face in the laptop the same as he does a book, head ducked so his hair hides his face. Weirdo.
“Yeah, Amelia says she learned it from her grandma and it’s an old family recipe, even though we keep telling her if she sold it she’d make millions.”
"I mean, most of the time we've known them they've been kind proccupied with war and shit," Dean adds, and Sam kicks him under that table. "Ow! What-?"
cas is made head boy in their seventh year. he totally isolates himself for everyone except his fellow prefects, and dean bitterly shelves his dreams of the pair of them having a night of aquatic sex in the prefect’s bathroom. he was made quidditch captain after anna left though, to his great surprise, and he’s kind of busy organising training sessions and worrying about matches. in the end, hufflepuff are in the semis again and when they just about manage to beat ravenclaw 370-240 after three hours play, dean shoves his exhaustion down and goes storming down to the slytherin common room and gets balthazar to bring cas out. they have a huge fight that blows up from whether cas even went to the match (”of course i did dean, but i’m very busy-”) to why dean even cares, since he has lisa now, to how dean isn’t fucking sleeping with her because he still likes cas even though he’s a fucking self-absorbed ass, to cas being sorry, but he’s got a responsibility here, sorry if dean can’t deal with that, because it’s not like he really knows the meaning of the word, etc etc while cas’s eyes burn gold and his wings flex like a threat. eventually dean lockjaws cas so he’ll listen and cas retaliates and then it becomes a full-on brawl, half fight and half duel, with half of hufflepuff coming out to see what the fuck is going on. they both get detention and seventy points off for fighting and using magic in the corridors and hurting each other and setting a terrible example. sam tells them they’re both idiots while they’re in the hospital wing, in full hearing of the other. cas comes to the quidditch final though, wearing slytherin colours, and when they draw after a spectacular catch by ben braedon he actually smiles at dean for a second.
Dean collapses in bed that night with nine phone numbers scrawled on various areas of skin and a whispered invitation from the bride-to-be that he was always welcome for a threesome.
“Dammit Risa, I
He continues talking, low and rambling through memories, and Cas lists aginst his shoulder, eyes shut, breathing gently fading out.
Dean ignores the implications of that statement and stands up. “Yeah. Think I’ll uh, go for a drive.”
“Nah, Crowley’s neither of their biggest fan,” Dean answers, starting the engine. “She reveals him, Crowley comes and pops her too.”
“So that’s it, you’re just gonna kill him?” she presses, and Dean stares back at her, schools his expression blank.
, with her, like he’s always been-
it, he’s just giving you some space.”
Dean wakes with his mouth half-open in a silent yell. He turns his head to the side and Tsalia’s eyes shine back at him, one heavy paw soft on the crook of his arm, and she wriggles closer so she can butt her head in under his chin. He presses both hands to her flanks, burying his fingers in her fur and focusing on the rise and fall of her ribs under his palms until they’re breathing in sync.
?” he says, startled, eyes snapping open, and finds the angel watching him from his usual foot or so away, looking extra mournful with the water flattening his hair to his head and drenching his clothes. “Dude, Sam’s right through there!” he hisses, trying to keep as quiet as possible because hello, amplification. “And you’re meant to take your clothes off
Misha: That’s- the rest of you can go back to your seats, that’s what you all wanted to ask too, right? Yeah, exactly, I thought so. And I thought I was finally gonna get some questions with depth and substance. What was it like? Exactly the same as kissing anyone else, there weren’t, you know, fireworks or anything. Little sparkles, choirs of angels. Oh, you meant different from kissing a

be. And fuck if Tsalia wasn’t right, too: other him’s got one arm braced on the wall, head hanging down, but his other hand is stroking rough through Cas’s hair, slip-sliding down his cheek, following his jawline with the backs of his fingers, thumbing just under his eye. And Cas’s head tilts to follow it, his eyes flickering closed like he’s savouring the touch before he slits them back open and looks up, does something that makes the other Dean shiver and snap his hips forward.
Termeraire!verse Jensen/Misha, where Captain Collins has something of a scandalous reputation but Jensen and Jared find him refreshing and engaging and quick-witted, and his dragon Anaximander not half as scary as gossip would have his kind. Captain Vantoch takes a little more getting used to, especially as she's quite happy to take brandy and play cards with the men and always turns up in male attire (Captain Collins once volunteered to wear a dress in trade when Jensen expressed his mild discomfort at this, and Jensen was struck quite dumb at the thought). Her Longwing is also delighted by Lady Padalecki's pregnancy ("Oh! You have an egg! I hope it does not make you as nauseous as Vicki's did, it was most disagreeable.") and Gen does remarkably well for having an eye the size of her head examining her enthusiastically.
"Ha ha," Sam answers, breaking the handshake and stepping back so the guy can offer his hand to Dean.
then crowley turns up - he's been hiding out in the bowels of hell, with the things that were around before gods and angels - and he takes one look at dean and goes all wide-eyed and sucks in a breath through his teeth. "that's not good"
“Dean?”
"Yeah well, welcome to the club," Dean answers, tipping his beer at her, grin blossoming across his face. "Sam here slept with a werewolf once."
"We haven't been to see," Sam consults his ridiculous little notebook, "Mrs Greenburg yet."
, not re-enacting fairy stories."
“Iope, c’mon, we gotta go,” he says, holding a hand out for her and already turning, and she bounds over and grabs it, her momentum swinging her up to his shoulder as surely as the upward pull of his arm, and he’s off and running, broken glass crackling under his feet and shoes slip-sliding in the black smears. Iope coils her tail around his throat and directs him back the way they came, almost strangling him when they take a couple of wrong turns, and then the exit door bursts open and they’re out, and the car’s surrounded by broken glass but intact and not too far away.
“Inebriation does not facilitate good decision-making. He’s just being cautious. It’s a character fault.”
“When I call your name, you will sit on the stool and place the hat on your head while you are Sorted, then remove it and go to your assigned table,” he said, flicking his eyes up to them and smiling encouragingly. “Avery, Nicholas!”
“I’m taking her out for a spin,” Dean announces when he finally comes bouncing indoors, a bag over each shoulder and bumping his legs. He’s grinning, happier than Sam’s seen him for a long time, everything in his world back to rights, and Sam can only smile back. “You coming?”
joshua looks deeply disapproving. "i speak for my
"C'mon then Rambo, let's go," she says with a sort of dogged determination, and Dean snorts.
Cas spins round, wand up, and Dean holds both hands up lazily.
One hand lifts and Sam catches it, folds their fingers together. Tsalia finally reaches them, collapsing at their feet with a rattling sigh, and a tiny bit of the tension goes out of Dean’s frame.
Misha: Love? This is just sex! They’re just fuckbuddies, don’t even
“I dunno, I don’t really remember it, I just know he was there. I think we were here though, that’s why I asked. Normally if I’m here and not fishing or something it means he was really here and not just poking round in my head.”
Jen: Hot, right? Yeah, I know. [model face]
St Claire spreads his hands. “Because my father requested it. As a third son I’m not in line to inherit much and the Church holds no appeal for me.”
She raised her eyebrows. “Hey, chill Winchester, I’m just asking. Sorry.”
"Oh. Doesn't he- huh. Okay."
Dean looks up from his pie when the other guy slides into the booth opposite him. Dude looks like he had an unfortunate baking accident, everything white from his mop of hair to his clothes to his skin - except his eyes, which are black as the night sky and have glimmering depths Dean's afraid to focus on in case it turns out they
- in which cas gets a motorbike. it's all sam's fault, but dean likes a challenge and builds one up for cas while he learns to ride a bike. sam resumes his lawyer thing and gets a girlfriend. cas works part-time at the daycare/school to assuage dean's fears of kidnapping (he also demon-wards it to hell his first day) and part-time at the local library, and they acquire a cat.
“Hey, no, enough,” Sam says to her then, grabbing for her to pull her away, and she keens and throws herself at him. He holds her against his heart with one hand while she wraps her fingers in his shirt and clings, pressing selfishly against his heartbeat, and his other hand hovers helplessly over Dean’s shoulder. “We can, we can go get help, Iope can go get help.”
Cas flicks a dismissive ear, turning back to the TV. A beat later though, he does fold experimentally down on himself, tucking his front legs under his chest and looking like a rather boney cushion. The look he shoots Dean is definitely smug.
"You seriously do fix cars?" It's out before she can think to filter herself, and she winces at the rudeness of it, but Dean just laughs, low and genuine.
“And now ‘m all sweaty again. Need to have another shower.”
that hurts. Something warm drips down his wrist and down over his palm, and the weird new sensation just above the heel of his hand tells him the bone’s come through the skin.
“Dean, please,” he appeals, darting in close to Dean’s feet, and Dean can only shake his head while Tsalia lashes her tail and does her best to ignore the bird-daemon as he wobbles about between her paws, never quite touching. Iope makes a distressed noise, stoking repetitively at Sam’s hair, and Sam hushes her with one hand buried in her fur, watching Cas cower from his old nightmares and helpless to stop it.
"Nice," Dean says, twisting to take it all in, and from behind him - and seriously,
Dean shakes his head. “Don’t think you can fix this, Sammy. Feels like it got me pretty good.” Even in the dark of the barn it’s clear his skin is leached white and clammy, and there’s an ominous liquid undertone to his breathing. “Just- stay. Please.”
“Oh Deanie, don’t be such a meanie! Come on, that’s no way to speak to someone on this day of love. I think it’s time to… Hmm, yes it definitely is.” Gabriel gives the lollipop a few kitten licks before he puts it back into his mouth. He smirks and snaps his fingers. The length of the ribbon shrinks so much that it’s just the loops around their wrists left of it. Dean’s right arm is now pressed flush against Cas’ left and Dean feels the soft skin of the back of Cas’ hand rubbing against his own when Cas moves. Shit. This is
“My god, dude! This is amazing! Your brother really made this?”
Elaiza finally lowers her hand and it’s not until she has disappeared around the corner and her footsteps fade away that Castiel lets go of the shed wall. He sinks down on the ground with shaking legs, trying to process what just happened. He draws in a couple of shuddering breaths, counting them to calm himself.
A faint humming noise comes from the van as Charlie rolls down the window. “Dean?”
“Nuh-uh, not at the same level. No way I’m as bad as you are!” Charlie turns to Castiel “So can we see the garage? You know, before Dean explodes with of anticipation?”
Dean turned onto Cas’ street a couple of minutes before nine o’clock. He parked across the street from his house and texted him to let Cas know that he was there. Dean drummed his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of ‘Ramble On’ that blasted through the Impala. He got so into the song that he didn’t see Cas leave his house and jumped high in his seat when Cas knocked on the window on the driver’s side. Dean leaned over and opened the door on the other side, trying to glare at Cas who laughed at his reaction. It almost worked, until he felt his breath hitch when he saw that underneath the trench coat, Cas was wearing the soft button down in the particular shade of blue that brought out his eyes even more than usual. All of a sudden, he felt way too underdressed in his flannel. He scratched at the back of his neck and lowered the volume on Led Zeppelin.
-Castiel sighs-
“You know damn well that I’ll continue to call you whatever I like.”
“I’d liked to continue on, maybe one day. But not under him. He’s awful! He’s one of those old school professors who expects all the junior members of their team to do everything for them and to be available around the clock, all year round. Just because he has no life outside of university, he expects everyone else to be like the same. Yeah, no, that doesn’t work for me. I like research, but I need to do other stuff too, you know? So I talked with another former PhD-student, Aaron, you met him earlier, and he brought along one of his promising graduate students, Kevin, and the three of us left university and started My CompAnIon.”
“I’m an author.”
“Yeah, I know Cas, I know. If you don’t remove this
“Hi! We’re here from My CompAnIon,” a chipper female voice says in his ear.
“Hello? This is Castiel.”
“Whoa! Whoa there! While I absolutely love what’s happening here, I’m not gonna kiss you when you’re this loopy. Let’s do it for real instead when you’re back to being your sane self again. Okay?” He looked down at Cas and added “or as sane as you usually are anyway.”
“I… yeah. Looks like.” Dean ran his free hand over his hair. He didn’t know what to make of it, if he should be concerned that the group he’d met at the bar had apparently made some assumptions that Dean himself wasn’t even sure were true. The fact that he was still holding Levi’s hand was kind of incriminating, yes, but he was cross-faded enough that he was pretty sure he could shove that down in the morning and blame it on the alcohol and weed.
"Sure," Bobby says again.
He swallows. There is something a little panicky in his chest at the thought, something that shies away when he tries to touch it, to name it.
Dean tells him everything he can think of, tells him that he's sixteen, which surely is old enough to be looking after his little brother for a couple of days, tells him that of course their dad is staying with them, that John works two jobs and comes in late and leaves early, that's why he hasn't seen him since he dropped Dean and Sam off last Wednesday.
Dean figures out quickly that he can pretty much take his pick of customers if he finds the right street corners. He always tries to pick up the guys who look sad, tired, the ones who seem like they are just looking for an escape and not like they want to hurt him. Not that Dean can't take care of himself, but he'd rather it didn't come to that.
“Hhh?”
"Couldn't sleep," Sam says. It's not
Cas holds up a hand, closing his eyes now, definitely listening to something. Dean can’t hear anything, but he’s got the uncomfortable feeling that Cas is talking - or at least listening - to the tree.
"Yeah, ages ago." Sam squints down at the journal. "Back in 1993. Oh, hey, I remember this. He ditched us on that farm in - where was it? Louisiana? For like three weeks. School hadn't started yet and there wasn't a library within walking distance. I remember I was so fucking bored I read the old farm manuals from back before dad's hunter friends turned it into a training ground." Sam laughed. "Pretty sure my knowledge of plowing never really came in handy."
It's more than Dean can stand.
Cas relaxes into Dean, and okay, they don't waltz, but they hold onto each other and move gently in the glow of the headlights. Cas steps on Dean's feet a few times, and it's new and a little awkward and it makes Dean laugh giddily.
Dean stares at him. No one is supposed to know Sam's at college - it's better, safer, if everyone just thinks he died or ran off. No reason to send word to the creepy crawlies to pick off the lone brother for some Winchester revenge.
At Cas' raised eyebrow, Dean adds, defensively "What? Okay so the Xerodicus play was dense, but I read."
Cas looks sad, but not totally unraveled.
“Sprained wing,” Cas mumbled sleepily, his hands fisting into Dean’s shirt, still clearly mostly asleep. “Aggressive with the other birds.”
“That we lean too much on each other, right?”
Cas takes a deep breath himself as Crowley walks into the room.
And there’s Dean, standing with his back to Sam, looking out at the view.
"Dean, it's me. It's okay."
"Uranus," Cas repeats in his gravelly tone.
Dean whimpers and mumbles "No. No, no, please, no."
"I… I don't… Really, I'm fine."
Dean supposes this is supposed to be him in fifteen-some years, and it's a trippy resemblance, but Christ, this older Dean looks like he's been through two decades of war and a couple of stints in rehab. He's been as broken as Sam, washed out, the lines etched deep around his eyes. His hair is roughly the same, at least, but his beard is scruffy and Dean is pretty sure there's some gray in it.
Sam wasn’t expecting him to throw the whole plan in their faces.
The feeling is temporary though. Cas makes a low, grunting sort of sound and puts a hand up to his forehead.
Cas' lips twitch. He digs a second fork out of the bag. "I admit, I'm fond of the ritual of drinking. Caffeine in the morning, alcohol in the evening. It doesn't have much effect on me, but I understand why people like it. It gives you something to do with your hands, something to gather around, the way people used to gather to tell stories around the fire. And I understand food can be like that too, it's just too many complex molecules for me to enjoy most of the time."
Dean grabs Cas’ face and kisses him. Cas’ mouth is already open, mid-word, and Dean takes the opportunity to steal those words right off his tongue. Cas gives in to him, like he always does, reaching up to cup Dean’s face in one hand, kissing him back like he still doesn’t know which kiss will be their last.
When Dean slips out of Jude’s nursery, leaving the door cracked, he finds Sam coming up the stairs.
They stare at each other.
for a life where the Winchesters didn't get every exception in the book, where they were neither blessed nor cursed, where there were no Big Bad Evils, but no miracles either. No more Chuck, no more insane deals, no more bargaining their souls away for each other, no more fighting for their storyline above the fate of the world.
He reads through the half-dozen text threads on Cas' phone. From Sam, it's mostly texts saying "Where are you?" and answering locations, bits of info that seems like it might be related to cases, and an occasional request from Sam for Cas to pick up something on his way home.
“Okay, I mean, I’m happy for him - for them. I’ve always wanted Sam to have a real life beyond all this shit. And it’s not like I ever thought I would. But yeah, I just wish… Seems like I’m going to have to have some kind of life now, and I want…”
Sam groaned as it started to play over the speakers. “Seriously? I thought you called this music ‘emo twang’.”
Dean makes a choice that makes sense in the rabbit-quick beat of his heart, the overwhelming, gnawing nothing in his pounding chest. He just wants to feel something, anything, outside of his head. Even if it destroys him.
Cas points, and Dean sees a large stump in the middle of the forest debris. It looks like it was cut down some time ago, and glancing around, Dean can tell that when it was standing it would easily have been the largest tree in the grove.
Cas looked like he was about to
It was like a sanctification ritual - your body out there under the sun, feet on the cracked earth, struggling towards an unknown center, finding the will to survive. Like Jesus in the desert. Cas says he doesn’t know if that story is apocryphal, but it doesn’t matter.
Sam points a finger at young Dean. “Don’t
"Yes," Cas says. "Just… give me a moment." He squeezes Dean's hand.
Dean had put an elbow in his gut and gone on his merry way, but… he gets it. He hates it, but his fourteen-year-old self was all eyelashes and big green doe eyes, all freckles and a smooth jawline. His cheeks are hollow and he has this kind of permanent haunted look to him, which just makes him a little tragic. His face is too feminine, his torso too lean. Now-Dean hates it. He hates it. He hates seeing himself like this. God, it makes him want to slap himself, yell at him to be more of a man, to get harder before the world makes that choice for him.
"Dean…" Sam's voice is the same sympathetic tone he uses when they talk to families of the newly-deceased. Dean hates it when Sam uses that voice on him. He knows if he looks over at his brother he will get a faceful of puppy-dog eyes and sadness on his behalf.
“But-”
He's not going to sulk. He's going to be something more than this.
Now-Dean watches it all unfold, numb again. This is probably the worst of it, what this place has to show him.
And as it all comes crashing down, Dean
It took Dean too long to dredge up the words from where they seemed stuck in his throat. Long enough that Cas had probably stopped expecting a reply, long enough that Dean could have just given up and pretended to go to sleep.
which is all gibberish to Dean.
Dean eyes him, decides from the rueful twist of Cas' mouth that he's being genuine.
Dean had clapped a hand over his mouth, leveling his gaze at Cas' wide blue eyes. "No talking," Dean said. "Now or later. No talking about it. Those are the rules. Understood?"
"Right. Uh. I'll try."
Cas is only two fingers in, mouth blazing with heat, wet as he sucks Dean’s lower lip down between his teeth, when Dean groans and breaks away enough to tell him to fuck him already. Cas blinks, slow, heady, a little thrown by the heat between them but still knowing Dean too well.
Hank lets the silence sit for a moment again and Dean's foot taps against the carpet as he waits.
"No, Cas, I'm not… I'm not leaving." He turned back, looked at Cas leaning up on one elbow, still naked, hair sweat-slicked, and had to glance away again, looking at the floor instead. "I just can't sleep naked, okay?"
"How much?" The man asks after his second drag.
"Pack up," John says. "Demon's exorcised, but we have a bogie on our tail. One of the cops I talked to earlier followed me from the bar. Lost him before I got here, but it's time to change plates and shake."
Sam is hurt. It comes out as anger, but Dean, both then and now, knows what it really is.
Dean turns away hastily. Still, he can't help the slight relief that Cas doesn't seem disgusted or, worse, desirous.
Cas shrugs, his trenchcoat rustling like wings. "It's not mine."
"Dean, you deserved to be saved as a child. You deserved to be protected."
The black smoke curls out of his mouth, shrieking as it runs over the holy symbol, disappearing into the air in the shiver of Latin.
Dean had shaken his head, face still turned away and eyes scrunched shut. "No, don't stop. It's fine. I'm fine."
The memory shimmers and slips and it's Sam leaving him, that night in October, before the scarecrow pagan god thing.
"Say I believe you," Dean says. The dizzy spell is fading. "What the hell am I doing here, in the future?"
"Cas. If you're not dead, I'm going to fucking kill you, you hear me? You can't just disappear like this. You promised me, okay? Just don't… don't get dead again. Do not make me do something stupid here."
Dean taps his own mouth to indicate and Cas licks his lips, getting most of the berry filling. Dean distracts himself from this by drinking more coffee and looking out at the water. It's pretty out here.
would speak to him if he would let it. (If you haven't read it yet, I obviously recommend it, I really think it lives up to the hype)
But Cas, uncertain though he was of the rules, did not think any of these things was what Dean was asking.
It's all fine and dandy so far. Constantine asking "Is this okay?" as he touches Dean in progressively more intimate parts, Dean nodding and arching his body up to meet him, wanting in a way he's not really used to.
But it’s 4:00 AM and Dean’s heart is racing, his sleep-deprived brain making him twitchy and impulsive.
“Okay, Tennyson,” Eileen says. “It’s still better not to kill a bunch of innocent people and get trapped in a vase for all eternity.”
"I'm begging you, man - " Dean's interrupted by the sound of footsteps. He and Sam turn in unison, Sam reaching inside his jacket for an angel blade, Dean hoisting the shotgun he's been holding at his side.
“Yeah. Fair enough. I guess… I don’t know, I think home for me was always about people, you know? But then, it kind of had to be, what with everything.”
Cas smiles a little. "Nothing like that I'm afraid. The inventions in medicine in the last decade have been remarkable though."
"Look, Dean, you're my brother and I love you," Sam says again. "And I get that you're messed up about it. But the way you treat Cas - and look, I'm not saying Cas hasn't done his fair share of shit - it's really not fair. To him or you. I mean, acting all loving and affectionate one day and then freaking out on him the next is one thing, but shutting him out anytime he tries to talk to you about it? Withholding attention until he lets it drop? Until he's walking on eggshells around you, too scared to ask you for anything because he never knows when it will be too much and you might just disappear forever. Who does that sound like to you?"
Cas wonders belatedly if he should have turned on the light. He can see in the dark, but Dean can't.
Sam sighs, scrubs one massive hand over his face, and tries to work out the problem. "Okay, we have two possibilities right now. Either we find a way to fuse you back into the Dean that Crowley pulled you from, or you stay here indefinitely. Either way, we should summon Crowley back, get him to explain what he did so we know what we're dealing with."
When Scarface is saddled up, Dean swings Jude up in front of him and takes him on a ride around the property. He spends most of the time grinning, keeping his nephew from falling off and listening to the sounds of delighted joy he makes. When they come back and wash up, Cas has finished with the intricate feeding and watering schedule for the day and the whole house smells like steak and frying vegetables.
*PLEASE READ ME I AM AN IMPORTANT NOTE*
His hands go still on Dean's shoulders, tightening outward from there, tension coalescing all along his body.
"Okay," Sam says. "Okay. Uh. Look, I know you're probably not going to believe me right now, but time travel is real. Rare, but real. This is the year 2020, and I'm me. I can prove it, okay? Our parents are John and Mary Winchester. Our mom died in a fire when I was six months old and you were four. You carried me out of the house and basically raised me for our whole childhood. One time when dad left us alone in the Impala too long, we carved our initials into the frame and they're still there. We're named after our mom's parents, Samuel and Deanna Campbell."
"Still having headaches?"
“Bring Cas with you,” Garth adds, before hanging up to send them a cryptic follow-up text with an address for a haunted mansion.
"Dude, you can't just say 'no discussion.' That's not an argument."
Love is a paradox, it seems.
"It wasn't always this way," Cas tries to explain to Dean one afternoon at a thriftshop when Dean makes a disgusted noise and a rude comment about a pink shirt in the men's section where he's rooting around for his usual flannel.
Dean had to be nurturing on one hand, ruthless on the other. That duality is still somewhere in him, all overbearing protectiveness and desperation for the kindness that he’s just being given here in this timeline. All hypermasculinity and this secret need for validation.
And love… Cas loved in an abstract way before Dean. He loved God - his Father, his Creator, his Judge and Redeemer. He loved his brethren, their garrison. He loved their cause. He loved humanity, even. But it was like… Love, as a servant of Heaven, was true and real, but in the way that surface level pain is still pain. There is a difference between pain that is inflicted on skin and the pain that goes bone deep, pain that makes internal and external indistinguishable because it is all raw and inflamed and unbearable.
"Absolutely fucking not. You can go live with Sam if you want to bring those home."
from this life, even if he’s never been able to name what that is.
Dean's surprised to find that it's mostly filled with what seem to be groceries. There's a little wooden organizer cutting off the left hand corner from the rest of the trunk and in that bit of space there's still a bag of salt, a jug of holy water, three shotguns, rocksalt rounds, and a wooden box of charms. But other than that, it's just a bunch of bulging plastic bags.
Somedays, Dean even wanted it. More days in the last few years than he’d ever admit to. He wants to stop, yeah, but that’s only ever meant dying. He’d wanted it so badly, that disastrous day at the haunted house when Cas had been dead, when he’d talked to Billie. He’d just wanted to stop.
That's usually how he deals with things, anyway.
"Cas? You get why I told you this, right?" Dean said after a few minutes of quiet. "You know, I'm not… I don't, um…"
3. Fly Me to the Moon - Frank Sinatra
How do you say that a parent’s best wasn’t good enough?
"Cas?"
It had made Cas' heart do a funny human thing, that swelling sensation in his chest, the same feeling he got when he watched Dean sleep. He'd applied that line to his family of course, Dean and Sam, Team Free Will, but he also thought it was such a simple, ingenious statement on humanity.
“I…” Cas’ voice catches for a moment and he clears his throat. “You would go to Heaven, Dean. Of course. But I… I think…” Cas is doing that thing with his face - that shifty sort of nervousness that means he’s been keeping secrets. Dean narrows his eyes, focusing on that, because he sure as shit can’t focus on the last thing Cas said.
Cas chooses that moment to come into the kitchen, and Sam watches the way Dean's body seems to automatically react to his presence. Dean's shoulders loosen, one foot shifting so that he's turned slightly in Cas' direction. When Cas makes his way past Dean to the coffee pot, Dean leans back against the counter to give him space and yet somehow their arms end up bumping.
knew! And this whole time, this whole fucking time, you two were together?!"
Cas is beautiful.
Dean blinks, looking at the spot where Cas stood for a second before he laughs. He shakes his head, grinning, and can’t help looking up at the sky, even though there’s nothing to suggest Cas is anywhere above him.
"I'm-"
Cas frowns at him. “You’re being strange.”
Sam takes a breath, reigning his tirade in. "If Cas likes spending time with a version of you who's obviously smitten with him, I can't blame the guy. But I know him too, and I know that he'd rather have you, the person he's been through everything with, who knows him -
“Cas, I don’t want to tell you what to do, but you’re not about to resurrect a full fucking tree here, are you?”
He knows his eyes are wide and shining like a little kid's when he turns back to Cas, and he doesn't care.
He thinks, vaguely, that there was a time when he was still soft, when he was trying to be like he remembered mom being, trying to be that and more for Sam. And maybe that softness was why dad… Well. Why dad seemed like he was trying to fix Dean.
Cas says, but there's nothing but quiet amusement in it. "You know, the man who discovered the planet didn't even want to call it that. He wanted to name it George."
"'If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal… and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing,'" Cas recites, there in the Impala, in Heaven, his gravel voice a near whisper. "'And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.'''
It had felt… honestly, it had felt like nothing would ever be the same after. That wasn't something Dean had let himself think about before he made the reckless decision to kiss his best friend, but, well, there they were, casually turning the world over in the bunker's living room.
He hears Constantine's little half-laugh and then "You know, you're starting to make a name for yourself. I'd heard about you of course, the famous Dean Winchester, John Winchester's perfect little prodigy."
"Good boy," Andy says, when Dean pulls his hand back out from under the pillow. Andy skoots closer on the bed. "We'll be quiet," he says, and slides his hand into Dean's pants.
He walks into the meadow and looks around at the green, green grass and the patches of little yellow and white flowers. It's a kind of peaceful he never felt when he was alive.
, because Dean couldn't have said when the last time he'd felt safe even was. If he'd ever felt safe in his whole fucking life since he was four years old.
Dean is used to clothes being a size too big on him, and there's something deeply comforting about borrowing Sam's clothing. They always used to share when they were younger. He takes a moment to look around Sam's room, at the neatly made bed and scattered books. There is a TV on the wall, but not much in way of personal effects or decoration.
"If anything's happened to your brother, don't think you'll ever see me again, boy," John had said to Dean's back. The motel room door had creaked open and slammed shut. Dean had stayed curled up on the bed for a long time.
It’s not like Sam doesn’t appreciate music, it’s just never meant the same thing to him that it meant to Dean and dad. Maybe because when he was younger it felt like just another thing being shoved down his throat, another thing that he and Dean were supposed to do the “right” way.
Dean looked at Cas looking at him, and he didn’t admit that this wasn’t the first time he’d thought about quitting, that he hadn’t mentioned it before because he didn’t want anyone to notice when he slipped. Voicing it was like a commitment. Dean wasn’t good at keeping those for himself, but he knew he could muster up the discipline if someone was holding him accountable, whether that was healthy or not.
"Hm. We've got some only-just-expired codeine or in-date oxycodone. You want to get knocked out?" Sam shakes the bottle at him, forcibly trying to lighten the mood.
“Is it something you would ever consider? I’m not able to prescribe, but I could refer you to a psychiatrist who can.”
Rhonda makes a little tutting noise and says, fondly, "One day you're gonna drop dead in my diner from a clogged artery and we might finally make the local news."
What Dean is feeling in that moment, looking at Cas, is
Older Dean catches the branch, eyebrows raised, but he smiles as he gives it an experimental heft. “Huh,” he says. “Nice. Your idea?”
"You're right. I know. He doesn't deserve that."
"Oh. Yes. Of course. Although I don't believe it can count as 'playing hooky' if the case is solved."
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas does not, predictably, have much more insight to the last fifteen years of cinema than Dean does, so Dean peruses through their DVDs and their subscription to the wholly magical Netflix. He settles on
(See the end of the chapter for
Not that he would, not that he's ever... but Dean's getting thrown around in the emotional whiplash of these memories and he can't…
"What about you, Sammy?" Dean asks after another few seconds have ticked by.
"I thought you should hear it from Dean." Cas checks the little digital clock on the bottom of the television. It's past 1:00am. "You should get some sleep, Dean."
"He just told me he loved me, that's all."
Watching Sam get flustered is always fun. That hasn't changed either. "No, I… I mean, there's a girl, maybe. We haven't… I don't know. It's not…" Sam stops waving his giant hands around and shoves them into his jacket pockets. "No, I'm definitely not hitched. Hopefully you'll get to meet Eileen, she's great, she's a hunter too, but… we're just testing the waters."
touching with anyone other than Sammy, and chicks he's hoping to sleep with, and this guy is neither so why are their arms practically brushing?
"After the last memory," Cas says gently. Dean grits his teeth. He doesn't like people being gentle with him. It feels too much like pity, or like they think he's fragile. And maybe Cas does think that, since he and Sam clearly didn't think Dean could get through this on his own, but fuck him. Fuck them both. Dean's not a child anymore. He doesn't need anyone to pat him on the back and tell him he's a good little boy. This was his life. He's used to it.
Younger Dean looks up at him warily from beneath some pretty sick bruises and nods. "Yeah. Whatever, man."
"No, thank you, I'm fine." Cas takes an appraising look around. "Will we be ready for the grand opening?"
Sam is genuinely surprised by this concession - Dean barely lets Sam pick the music from his own collection, let alone propose an addition.
Dean's relief when Cas returned, again, from the dead, was a palpable thing. Like an octopus wrapped tight around his heart, a painful constriction. But after the initial relief, the reunion, Dean's hand pressed to his face the way it always was to check that Cas was real, alive, solid and warm, Dean had shut down again. He'd pushed Cas away, shut off whatever it was they had been making together, slipped back into his own defenses.
Jack is just as eager about each new exhibit, reminding Dean so much of a young Sammy that he has to laugh when Jack starts telling him all about desert hares.
“Jack,” Cas says simply, and he’s smiling. His hand finds Dean’s, fingers fitting between fingers.
The bunker is quiet. It's always quiet, but this time it feels like a pointed silence. It's absence.
It's the road again.
“I’m not even supposed to be here,” Dean says. “I’m just a copy of a person. It literally does not matter if I die.”
"I knew we shouldn't have brought you, you can't even handle a goddamn vamp nest without fucking up an order. We don't need another liability, you useless son of a -"
boys."
Cas wants to tell him that all he had to do was ask, all Dean's ever needed to do was ask and Cas would be there. He doesn't say anything, just sinks onto the bed next to Dean's hunched form.
“I…” Dean laughs in that humorless way he’s come to hate. “I wasn’t…”
The play is so mind-numbingly dense that Dean finds himself reading the same passage over and over for ten minutes before he decides to just skip around.
Dean would tell him to shut up, but in the gruff, affectionate way that meant he was secretly pleased with it.
"Dean," Sam says, looking up from a pile of papers and a suspiciously green smoothie. "Hey. Where are you -"
There are other parts of Heaven. Dean learns that Adam is there with his mom, a drive that always feels just too far to make. John visits sometimes and Dean tries to accept this. He can't fully, but it doesn't fill him with the bitter rage he once felt about it. His father is who he is. He was who he was. Trying to make him something else is like being angry at the sun. There's nothing but time to come to terms with that, if Dean wants to.
Time is different in Heaven, but night slowly turns into day. It's dawn when Cas finally looks up at the lightening sky and sighs.
It's like…
“Yeah,” Dean says shortly. Hank seems normal enough. He’s maybe ten years older than Dean, with prominent forehead wrinkles accentuated by his receding hairline. His eyes behind the silver-framed glasses are brown and seem kind. He holds himself with a relaxed yet upright air, legs slightly spread and shoulders back in the kind of easy discipline that Dean associates with military types.
"Yeah," Dean whispers back after a pause.
Cas leans heavily against the wall for a second, eyes shut. "I used to be able to do much more," he murmurs. "I'm just glad to help."
"Dean was very insistent that we stop here for breakfast," Cas says, with a familiar resigned air.
“Bossy,” Dean muttered, but Cas could tell he was pleased about it. Cas filed this too away for future consideration.
The kid beams up at Dean like he's his goddamn idol or something.
Dean closed his eyes. “I don’t know why I… It’s not your fault. I shouldn’t… I hate that I fall apart like this, Cas. I should be stronger than this. I’m supposed to be able to handle this shit.”
Older Dean looks up from his coffee when he enters, the bags under his eyes carrying an extra few years this morning. He notices Dean's newly bandaged hand and holds his own out for a fist bump.
"But dad… How exactly did he die? I mean, how the hell did we get to something that dad couldn't?"
Does it ever end?
Sam is on his laptop at the table, older Dean is leaning moodily against a wall, and Cas is in among the shelves looking for something, when Dean walks in. They all turn to look at him in varying degrees of surprise.
Cas hadn't even seemed surprised by Dean's emotional whiplash, which had rankled. He hadn't tried to talk about it, hadn't tried to touch Dean. If his "Thank you," was too sincere, too full of other things, when Dean finally got himself together and handed Cas a cup of coffee one morning in one of his usual taciturn gestures, that was something Dean could ignore.
The man opens his wallet and counts out a small stack of cash. "Let's make this easy. What do you say to four hundred?"
"Yeah. I noticed that. Did he…" Dean stops, not sure how to ask, not sure if he should. "I know y'all don't want to tell me the other guys' stories and I get that. But… my Sammy was just a kid, you know? Seeing Sam like this, I just… Is he okay?"
“And I you.” Cas holds out his arms. “Are you ready?”
Charlie smiles at them. “I just mean, loving someone so much that you lose your mind when they die, that’s something.
He doesn’t know what he’s saying, really, but then Sam is there, holding onto him, gripping Dean as if he is the one clinging to life. And Dean is trying to make it okay. He wants to make it okay for his little brother. For his Sammi.
Older Dean gives him a look that tells Dean he sees right through that, because of course, that is older Dean’s bullshit too.
But what would Dean have been like if someone had just… loved him?
“Shit,” Sam says quietly. “Sorry. That was too much. I didn’t mean…”
"No, actually," Dean says with a sigh. He runs a hand through his hair, squinting out at the brightness of early morning. He was up when Sam knocked because he hadn't been to sleep yet. His eyes feel too tired for all this sunlight. "Maybe if I'd… I mean I always figured if he ever found me with a guy he'd rip me a new one. I mean, a Winchester, a fucking queer? Thought I'd be dead for sure. But no. When we left the bar that night, he just asked me if I'd been tested."
Bobby shrugs. There's a smile beneath his scruffy beard. "Only question is, what are you going to do now?”
Or at least, Sam would work through it, and Dean would drink and pretend it never happened.
Now-Dean can't really see any of this happening from where he stands in the dark, but he remembers.
Cas closes his eyes and nods. "God is real."
just Hell. Maybe he really can't remember who he was before forty years in the pit.
"Are you going to tell me that your sexual identity crisis has nothing to do with dad?"
"But when it comes to codependency," Hank goes on. "We're talking about a maladaptive approach to relationships. Some signs might be feeling responsible for everyone around you, feeling guilty and ashamed much of the time, being attuned to others’ emotions, and centering other people’s problems above your own well-being. Does any of that sound familiar?”
Honestly, Sam thinks if twenty-two year old Sam showed up, there's nothing he could say to convince him that they were the same person. He's not sure they are the same person. Sam has been irrevocably changed by the intervening years to the point that he barely recognizes himself in the mirror sometimes. He doesn't think the snarky, hotheaded, headstrong college student he'd been back then could understand the quiet, temperate, deliberate hunter that he's become.
There are layers there that Dean's not sure he wants to pry at. Sam shoots older Dean a look that is equal parts exasperation and concern. And it's that, more than anything else, that makes Dean's shoulders sag.
" Dean says with a mock-scowl.
Poetry is not supposed to do that.
They don't talk about it.
The R.E.M. tape runs out fifteen minutes from the bunker, the silence cutting into Dean's daydreaming remembrance. He has to shake himself a little, pull himself out of that point in time when he'd still had any softness left to him. It leaves a dull ache of absence in his gut, but hey, that's nothing new. It's just a spot he'll fill or numb down with whiskey.
"I don't understand that reference," Cas says. He gets to his feet. "But you did, Dean. You do. You deserved to be saved."
In the last few years, Dean has quietly been letting himself suspect that they'd never find the thing that did it. He was kind of okay with that, as long as it meant that his dad didn't die doing something stupid, as long he didn't leave Dean on his own with this weight on his shoulders. But apparently, that's exactly what happened.
A couple years back, Dean stole Sam's laptop one evening and did some googling. He wasn't trying to WebMD himself, not to psychoanalyse himself anyway, he just wanted to make sure that he wasn't, like…
They’re all silent for a moment. A breeze passes by on the Arizona streets, but all it does is buffet the warm air around them.
They’re quiet again for another few minutes.
Dean narrows his eyes. "C'mon," he says. "Not even pie? You drink alcohol and coffee, but you won't indulge in God's greatest gift to mankind since the American burger?"
“Nothin’,” Dean says, walking across the creaking floorboards to the couch. It’s so stupid, but his heart is beating so hard. It’s easy to cup Cas’ face in his hands, but it takes such an effort to get the words out. “I just love you.”
"Thank you?" Jack says, soundly a little lost.
“Cas,” Dean says. He feels much like he did when he dragged himself off that empty apartment floor so many years ago, like he can barely think around the poison working its way out of his body. Only it’s still his body, but he’s the poison this time. “I’m serious. This is it.”
But Dean's not going to do any of that. He's not going to fuck it up for Cas and his past self.
"Dean, come on, man."
“Okay, cool.” Dean grins. “Hey Cas, you ever play baseball?”
Dean is a professional snoop, afterall. If Cas really knows him, he can't be surprised if Dean goes through his shit.
Isn't this what makes them Chuck's favorite show, in the end? Their neurotic, irrational, codependent love for each other? Isn't it that very thing that keeps ruining Chuck's endings?
Dean looks indignant. “Hey, don’t look at me, man. I’m not an idiot.”
He doesn't think about it, but he remembers the anxiety in those few days after, waiting for dad, just about praying for him to show up. He remembers the late summer on the farm, nothing to do but train and try to entertain Sammy. Or… no, that's not quite right. Because there's a niggling memory that feels like working loose a tooth, a memory of pure panic about still being there when school started. The memories don't fit together. They'd have to span weeks. And…
"It's not about you, Jack. Not really." Sam stands up before Jack can ask him what he means. "I'm gonna go check a few things. See if he took any of his phones or anything else I can track."
"C'mon, man, we're two trained fighters. We can figure out a waltz. We just need music."
Dean refocuses on his anger, like he always does, grounds himself in, lets himself hate this other version of himself for everything he doesn't know yet. Christ, young Dean hasn't even lost dad or Bobby, hasn't sacrificed himself for Sam, hasn't watched Cas die over and over. Young Dean isn't even speaking to Sam. He's just fucking around on his own, tailing pathetically in John's footsteps, trying to convince his dad that he's worth having around…
me, and I want…" Dean shifted on the mattress, his fingers clasping and unclasping where his hand rested on top of Cas' stomach. "I'd just like to… I dunno, to do something for you for once."
“What the hell, Garth?” Dean leans in over Sam’s shoulder to speak into his phone.
Cas looks up from the book he isn't reading and blinks. "Excuse me?" He says politely, as if dragging his thoughts back from a long way off.
"Dean,
Not a sexual desire, although maybe that’s in there too, but a wanting in the way that Dean wants his own house, his own quiet life, wants to share all of that with someone he loves and who loves him. It’s unfamiliar to Dean that he can be experiencing this desire at all, but also that he wants all of these things that he has. He wants to go on having them.
, some value that goes beyond the callouses and the body count. Like maybe he deserves
"Oh," Dean says. It comes out smaller than he means it to. He has never prayed in his life, but if he were going to, he'd want to do it here.
He gets them out of the restaurant quickly, swiping the abandoned napkin frog from the table when Cas is turned and sneaking it into his pocket.
Sam laughs, an empty, hollow, bitter sound. "Right," he says, ignoring Dean. "And what
“Where do you think I… Where am I gonna go?”
Older Dean elbows Sam in the side. "Told you. You, me, clippers."
“Cas,” Dean says, turning back over to face him, his voice coming out rough. “Get the door.”
He's never had sex with a guy because he wanted to, and not because he had to. Dean views his body as a resource, and an expendable one at that. He learned it early on, in the broken bones and bruises and hasty stitches done with dental floss in motel bathrooms with no anesthesia. His body is more about being something he can use than it is about being a part of his actual sense of self, of personhood. His body has been a commodity for as long as he's been able to swing a knife or shoot a gun. So when he figured out he could use it to make money, to put food on the table for him and Sam, of course he had.
Her voice is smoother than Castiel had expected. Softer. When she moves, one movement flows into the next in a way that reminds him a little bit of a big cat. His pulse is racing. Finally.
Dean puts down his load and chuckles. “Man, that dude was such a fucking weirdo! You know, I still wake up every day and thank whoever’s up there, if there actually is someone, that the court decided that it was all on him and we shouldn’t pay him a single cent. His attempt with the bad review still makes me laugh every time I think about it.” Dean distorts his voice into a whine, “’The employees at this company may be competent at building androids, but be careful about letting them into your home!!!! They filled my entire house with traps!!! They bring very dangerous things into your house and then they claim that they need them for the construction!! They don’t!!!!! They only want to injure and maim people in the hopes that they will die and then they can replace us all with their robots!! Don’t trust these people!!!!!! They are part of the robot uprising!!!!!!!!! The android works well though.’”
“There are no pirates in your western European medieval inspired piece of fiction.”
He leans against the garden shed to stretch out his calves. In the lull between two songs he thinks that he hears something and removes his ear buds, pausing the music that is stored in them. There’s someone calling his name.
“Wow!”
“Soda is fine, thank you.” Cas got his drink and left the kitchen, saying something about going to find Aaron to talk about a documentary they both had watched. Dean just shook his head and turned back to Victor.
“Of course I am. I’m always right. Besides, you and I both know that there’s someone else you want. And have wanted for a really long time.”
Castiel worries that the dry spring weather will affect his plants and that he won’t get a big crop later in the year. He is out in the Friday afternoon sun, watering his kitchen garden when the low rumbling of an engine has him call out for Elaiza to turn the water off. The stream in the hose dwindles to a trickle as the broad black car parks and Dean gets out. Castiel drops the hose and walks over the swiss chard and the celery to go and greet him.
Dean, picking up on Castiel’s confusion, clarifies, “Moondoor, it’s our LARPing world.”
“I need you to understand that even though she has warm skin and an added scent that works like the scent of a human body and even an extra perfume when that feature is activated and she is able to express ideas and thoughts, she is not a human. And she never will be a human. She is still a machine. There is no warm blood in her, no pulse, no heartbeat. There is no sex in her, while she will be able to, um, be a companion to you in that way as well, there is no human or animalistic sex drive in her, she won’t be able to take any kind of initiatives unless you train her to do that. As I said, she is still a machine. A long line of cold, hard code.” Charlie pauses for a moment, possibly to make sure that he is still listening and taking in what she says. He nods and she continues. “Albeit dressed in a soft squishy humanlike covering, but again, it’s a machine and you need to understand that. At My CompAnIon, we have already seen countless of examples of people who have fallen in love with their companions. It is not something the company speaks of officially, but from what I know, none of those have ended happily, so my advice is just be careful. Okay? Think of her more like a friend or a sister.” Charlie tilts her head to one side and looks like she is contemplating something. She adds, “though that might make the intimacy a bit awkward…”
“Potato, potato,” Anna says as her phone makes a little buzzing dance across the table. “Oh, that’s Michael. Samandriel, sweetie, Daddy is here to pick us up now.”
“Yes, I’m aware of that by now, but you know damn well that I’ll continue to ask you not to.” Balthazar’s sudden laughter is loud enough for Castiel to wince and move his phone a little bit away from his ear until he hears that it’s starting to quieten down on the other end of the line. Balthazar has never truly learned good phone etiquette; he laughs too loudly, he keeps the phone pressed to his face even if he needs to talk to someone in the same room or scream orders at someone he works with, and one unfortunately memorable time when he’d talked to Castiel, he had even brought his cell phone into the bathroom. Castiel had hung up the moment he realized where Balthazar was.
Half an hour later, they walked back into the waiting room, still hand in hand. The dentist had removed one of Cas’ teeth, fixed cavities in two others, and then thoroughly cleaned his teeth. Cas had gotten a new appointment in a couple of weeks to get a replacement tooth put in. Dean was really glad that he had brought several of their old fraudulent credit cards. This was going to be expensive, it wasn’t like you could get health insurance as a hunter.
“Oh. Really?” Cas looked like he couldn’t believe what he was hearing.
“Don’t be silly. This is serious.”
He leads them out of the kitchen, through the dining room and into one of the smaller rooms leading off of it. He opens a door that to him always has looked a little out of place, like it doesn’t fit in with the rest of the house. “My great uncle had this door put in when he had the garage extended so that he could go directly from the workshop to the house, not needing to go out when the weather didn’t agree with him. Which, to be honest, was most of the time.”
-ugh what is his name?-
“Dean, come on, you need to sleep.”
“Nah-uh. That’s not how this friendship works. If you need to leave, we leave together. Capiche?”
“Okay. So, in the 1960s there was this chatterbot called Eliza, it was one of the first programs that was tried for the Turing test. And since then, whenever we humans anthropomorphize any kind of computer program, like when you thank an AI or any sort of automation, we call it the Eliza effect. Really, Castiel you couldn’t have picked a better or more clever name for your AI android. I bow down to you, excellent work!” Charlie giggles again.
“Hello.”
“I’d been cooped up all day, so I went for a run,” he bends down to scratch at his bare ankle where dust, pollen, and small shriveled plant parts have stuck to his sweaty skin. He longs for the rain; the spring grass is already beginning to turn into a yellowish brown and his crops aren’t growing as they usually do, the dry air catches a little on its way down to his lungs.
Cas tilts his head and squints as he thinks, and Dean has to dig his fingernails into the palm of his hands to not reach out and do something stupid.
Castiel points to his own Lincoln Continental, Dean follows the line of his finger as he continues to pet the dark green Bentley and then turns to give him a horrified look.
“Oh, yeah? Why’s that?”
“So, what’s up with the chimneys? You got a reason to go on a deep dive into old masonry?”
“So anyway, despite all that, I still think that one of the most interesting dragons is the Teju Jagua. It’s maybe not a dragon-dragon, but it kinda falls under that category if I understand it correctly. My friend told me about it, and I don’t know, I just like the thought of a lizard with a bunch of dog heads that can shoot fire from the eyes and lives in caves and eats fruit and protects treasures. It’s cool with a type of dragon that’s a protector of fruit.”
“Oy! Are you two having fun without me?” She walks up to them. “Castiel, I’m afraid that today won’t be very much fun, we mostly need to organize stuff and bring in about a million little gizmos, but tomorrow, the exciting stuff will begin!” Charlie turns her attention to her colleague, “Dean there’s a perfect workspace for you over there, you should go check it out, and then maybe we should get to work and start setting things up?”
“I’m sure they will.”
“Yeah. Yeah, off you go, your royal queen-ship.”
“Yeah yeah, I’m sure that’s very interesting but it doesn’t matter right now. Come on, coffee.”
“Cas!”
“Yeah, I think so,” Charlie nods. “Otherwise we know where you live,” she winks at him and then sighs. “Oh Castiel, I’m really gonna miss you!” She throws her arms around his neck. He’s surprised and it takes him a moment to put his arms around her, it’s been a long time since he’s hugged anyone outside his family, and even that doesn’t happen very often.
“I scanned the premises. You were nowhere to be found.” He takes a stumbling step backwards. Elaiza closes in on him. “You are not to disappear like that. Do you understand? Castiel, we are meant to be together.”
“Thank you, Elaiza. I appreciate that,” he says and his grateful smile is accompanied by a growl from his stomach.
“Cas,” he groans.
“I’m sorry to hear that, is he going to be okay? How’s Michael taking it? And his mom?”
They walk out to where Elaiza had attacked him yesterday. Castiel finds it difficult to grasp that it was less than twenty-four hours ago. Her body looks so small and frail where it lies in the wet grass, not at all like she would have been the root of his most frightening experiences. A slender frame. A few feet away from it, a head with dark hair that’s tousled by the heavy downpour. Wires poking out of both, no longer sparking, the electricity all fizzled out. No more artificial life in her.
“Mmm yeah. Can’t wait. Already drawin’ up plans for that. And the next time. And the next. And also the one after that. Might have an idea for the next one too,” Dean says and then he asks, “Is the leg still doing okay?”
He can hear her voice calling out for him in the distance.
“Sam and Jess met at college, in some kind of English class they both had to take, despite the fact neither of them wanted to study English. I don’t know, I don’t understand how that works. Anyway, they didn’t get along. They argued in class all the time, but their classmates said that it was clear that they actually liked each other and still they couldn’t agree on anything. Until they did a group thing about Shakespeare, something about comparing some of the girls in the plays and they realized that they both liked Rosalind the best. And somehow, that led to Sam asking Jess out and now they’ve been together for ten years and agree on basically everything.”
“This’ll probably sting a lil,” he says as he pours disinfectant on the clean towel and dabs it on Castiel’s calf. And it does. Castiel breathes out hard through his clenched teeth and Dean casts a quick glance up at him. “You good?”
A burst of irritation erupts in Castiel’s chest. “Thanks for that. Not like I was enjoying it or anything.” He removes his arm from her shoulders, gets up and turns off the TV. He might as well go to bed.
found each other again. Him and Cas. Cas and him. If Dean would live a million lives, he’d never meet anyone who could mean as much to him than Cas does, who could affect him as much as Cas does. They have been so much for each other. Allies. Friends. Enemies. Family. And yeah, there’s something else too. Something that’s been there for a very long time. If Dean’s honest with himself - and why shouldn’t he at this point, he’s sick and tired of lying to himself, of denying and suppressing things – he has other feelings for Cas. Not a crush, that sounds too childish and besides it’s not enough. Not even being in love is strong enough, he knows that he loves Cas, but what they have is something else. Something completely different. And yeah, he knows that all couples are different from each other and that all couples probably think that their story is the greatest love story ever, but Dean knows for a fact that their story has every other beat. It’s time for them to take the final step now. No one is dead or dying. No one is going through any kind of trials or being a demon or a god. No one is trying to rebel against something and there are no big bads to defeat and no apocalypse to stop. It’s finally time. And if they need a new word to be able to describe what they are to each other, then that’ll come in due time. Otherwise, him and Cas, they have always been good at defying all labels. The timing is finally right, and all Dean feels is the rightness of it.
Dean stops walking for a moment, “Yeah, don’t think that’ll be a problem.” Castiel follows the line of where he’s looking. The front door is lying flat on the steps leading up to his house.
Dean felt himself go red. His husband? He hadn’t really thought about the implications when he had booked the appointment and stated that it was for Castiel Winchester, but it wasn’t like Cas had a last name, so giving his own had seemed like the only option. Shaking himself out of his stupor, he got up and followed the nurse.
When they at last pulled into the bunker’s garage, Dean parked and got out of the car. He walked around to the passenger’s seat and opened the door, waiting for Cas to step out. Cas did so and then he stood very still looking down at the floor, opening and closing his mouth a few times.
“Hello Dean.”
“Oh no?”
“Dean, from what we’ve understood, only one person can go in after him. And it can’t be Jack because we need his powers to keep the portal open.”
He also learns that it is incredibly difficult to be in the same room as Dean and not halt in the middle of a task to touch him now when he is allowed to do so. He pauses behind Dean, standing by the open fridge, to stop and press himself against his back as he places a kiss behind his left ear before he moves on to take cutlery out of the drawer. He squeezes his ass when Dean fills the pot for making coffee. He runs his fingertips down his arm before refilling his water glass.
Castiel hears a small ripping sound from one of the seams when he tugs it over his head as quickly as he can and he drops the shirt on his pillow. Dean’s arms are around him before he’s even let go of it, the skin on skin contact makes Castiel draw in a breath and Dean pulls him down over himself so that Castiel’s body covers his. Dean wraps his arms tighter around him and nips at his upper lip before pushing his tongue back into Castiel’s mouth. Castiel uses his arms to keep some of his weight off Dean, bracketing him in as  he worries that he might crush him, that it’ll be too much, but apparently Dean doesn’t like that because he makes a low grumbling sound as his tongue moves against Castiel’s and his hands move down Castiel’s back, finding their way back into his underwear. Dean squeezes his ass and pushes Castiel down at the same time he moves his own hips up a little, their hard cocks dragging against each other. It’s even better like this. Dean groans into his mouth and Castiel swallows the sound, feeling the patch of precome on his boxers grow. He lifts himself up a little as he ruts against Dean, just so he can lean down and bite at his collar bone and then lick a stripe along his neck, making Dean pant and stutter in his rhythm as he grinds his hips up.
“Yeah. Well, I need somewhere with a bit of space and access to electricity. A place where it doesn’t matter if I’m a bit rough,” Dean answers, but he quickly adds “I mean, it’s not like I’m clumsy or break things or something. It’s just, you know, mechanical work. Wouldn’t want to ruin these fancy wooden floors or something…” He scratches at the back of neck, still clutching his cell phone in the other hand. Out of the corner of his eye, Castiel sees Charlie’s gaze flit between them.
“I had to exit the building. There was a visitor. The mechanic came back. Yet again.”
“No, it won’t, but I don’t mind giving it a couple more smashes if you want me to.”
Dean almost suspects the start of a new prank war, but then he remembers that Sam’s spending the weekend with Eileen and that Cas had just popped down next to him like he’d been summoned, so he stashes that idea back where it came from.
-ugh-
Dean wraps gauze around his leg. “Should do it. It’s not too tight, is it?” he asks as he drags his fingertips up and down over Castiel’s other leg.
“Yeah I. Let’s, uh let’s go get her.”
“I beg your pardon?”
Charlie grins up at Dean. “Still can’t believe that you memorized all that shit.”
“Dean don’t worry. I really think it’ll work out. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to go and find Victor before midnight.” Jo winked at him and then she spun on her heel and walked away.
“Oh yeah? Anything we’ve read? Or at least heard about?”
Dean blinked a couple of times, trying to process the last few minutes. Had he really suggested to Jo that they should kiss again? Jo liked Victor? Jo knew about his feelings for Cas? But most importantly, did she really imply that he might have a chance with Cas? He looked around the room and saw that several of his friends were already starting to pair up, even though it was almost ten minutes left until the clock turned twelve. Scanning the room, he realized that he hadn’t seen Cas in a while and he suddenly felt a rush of urgency to find him. Even if he probably wouldn’t be brave enough to kiss him at midnight, he still wanted to spend the last minutes of this year and the first of the next with Cas.
At dinner the same night Sam had given him the candy, Dean realized that Cas seemed to only chew his food using only the left side of his mouth.
“Good to know,” Castiel says and rises. He takes his plate and when he’s gotten half a dozen paces from the table he stops and turns at the sound of a muttering. “Pardon? Did you say something?”
“Jesus! Fuck!” Both Dean and Castiel jump when a cup is thrust between them, neither having heard Elaiza approach.
“Institution? Did you work with this at a university?”
“Of course, Dean.”
Castiel hums in agreement and says, “Yes, perhaps it is.”
She scans over him with her light eyes and Castiel wishes yet again that they were a little darker. The way they are now, as they unblinkingly consider him, remind him too much of a shark. Too light. Too calculating. Too lifeless. Seemingly content with the results of her scan, she nods sharply and says “Yes, you are somewhat dehydrated, and both your pulse and breathing are elevated. It was not wise of you to exert yourself by running when the temperature is this high. Humans are so very fragile. I will fetch you water at once. You should sit down in the shade while you wait. Do not move away.”
As Dean inspects the gate, he quickly rules out trouble with the electrical wiring. Instead he points to a metal bar, Castiel pretends to follow where his finger is pointing but is instead admiring Dean’s hands.
Dean had a great time. He was only a little bit drunk, the kind that just made the world seem like a happier place and made everyone funnier. He talked with Jess about her plans on becoming a nurse. He checked in with Cas. He stood next to Stevie and cheered for Charlie against Gabriel in what must have been the world’s most equal game of beer pong. Charlie finally won, but it was really close. He checked in with Cas. He danced with Lisa for a bit and then with Benny and Andrea. It was a good evening.
-seriously!-
“Castiel, I cannot leave you. I am your companion. I bring you companionship. I am programmed to love you. I love you. I do. No one will ever love you like I do.”
“Okidoki. In the words of the Ramones: Hey Ho, Let’s go,” she clacks a few final clicks.
“Indeed you are and I’m very proud of you, darling, though somewhat impatient. The bigwigs are starting to breathe down my neck about the next ‘
“And according to the manuscript I found a link to and read through, it is the vicar. The story has several weak points. There is no need for such meandering story telling and so many so-called red herrings.”
“Yeah no, it’s from a movie.” Castiel can almost see the electrical circuits in her head work. At least he thinks that they are in her head, the thinking part of Elaiza might as well be down in her leg. He distractedly wonders if it would be impolite to ask.
’. “What are you doing?”
“Charlie and I are off to this LARPing thing tomorrow and Sunday.”
“Excellent. Let’s plop it in then,” Castiel says and reaches past the digging bar he’d needed for moving an unexpectedly large stone, to grab the sapling. His fingers pause only momentarily over the heavy metal, it is cast iron after all, an ancient gardening tool, left in the shed by his great uncle’s own uncle. It could be a fantastic weapon, but he has no opportunity of using it against Elaiza now. He is sitting on the ground and she is standing up. He is a slow, fragile human and she is a lightning fast, strong android. He doesn’t stand a chance.
“Yes please, mine’s soaked.” Castiel throws it at him and when Dean’s head shows again, his face has gone light pink. “Um, Cas? This shouldn’t feel weird, but it kinda does. Can I borrow a pair of boxers too? Just realized that damp underwear isn’t very comfy.”
The implications of what Charlie said is still landing in Castiel. His mind is reeling. It’s too much. The garage is too warm and he himself is getting too cold, but at the same time he’s sweatier now than during his run. His perspiration is forming a bead at the back of his neck and he feels the drop starting to move down his back. He needs to get out of here. “If you’d be so kind to excuse me for a moment. I think I need some air,” he says, as he gets up. He brushes past Dean and steps out into the garden. The voices from the garage fade away as he stumbles across the lawn.
Castiel turns his head and kisses down Dean’s neck, the angle is off since they’re still on their sides, he’s getting annoyed when he reaches the neckline of the t-shirt and tries to move it away in search of more skin to explore. “Off,” he says and pulls at the shirt, “you’re wearing too many clothes.”
“They do care,” Castiel insists, his voice sounding distant to his own ears. His leg throbs again. He shakes, flattened against the wall.
Castiel looks at his own phone. “I have four missed calls from her and a message. Dean, I think you’d better call her.”
“Sounds riveting. I’m thinking about breaking for lunch now, you wanna join? Or keep staring at…” Dean squints down at the page “drawings of chimneys? Seriously?”
“Yeah yeah. I do not need another rehash of your stories about people you’ve experienced, thank you very much. And secondly, maybe.”
“Do you have a name for her? What are you going to call her?”
Inside, they’re met with a partially overturned house. Furniture are broken or flipped over. A few paintings have been knocked off their hangings, glass from the frames shattered on the floor. There’s even a cracked doorpost where Elaiza must have crashed into it in her hurry to follow Castiel once she realized that he was gone.
“Why are you rereading a piece of fiction? It does not seem to be an efficient use of your time.”
“’Kay. Take your time. But Cas? I might peek out at you, ya’ know, so you ain’t spiraling again, yeah?”
“So, the dowel. I think I can fix it, just needs to be straightened out a bit, but I don’t know if I got something that’s heavy enough in the toolbox in Baby’s trunk to fix it. Do you have anything? Like a big heavy hammer or something like that?”
