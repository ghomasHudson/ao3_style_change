Alec, unsurprisingly, didn’t look like he quite knew how to react to that.
suggest I do, Casanova?”
Dean glanced down, fiddling thoughtfully, before looking up to meet Cas’ eyes again.
“Apparently so.”
“Its okey he’s sleeping in his room becoz he has a hedache!”
Seriously, he had no idea why she was so invested in his marriage. He knew about ‘shipping’, of course, couldn’t
So Dean didn’t falter in his stride, even though it probably wasn't
Dean had been mildly worried that Cas would tense again at the firmer movement, but it appeared that his gentling had done the trick. He wasn’t unnecessarily harsh, of course, even if Cas’ angelic status would prevent any real harm from coming to him at Dean’s hands, because he doubted it would be needed to get his wings in order.
“That would explain the feathers everywhere- much better than you getting into an intensive pillow fight with yourself would, anyway.”
reminder i have not interacted with babies on any significant basis since I was too young to have any real conception of like, developmental milestones, bc although I was the 12 year old tasked with looking after cousins and shit the ones that I interacted with regularly ranged from 6-8 and also my parents separated when I was 14 so I have pretty much not seen any younger children on a significant basis since then
“Won’t I still need to buy them? I have two hands, you know.”
“Oh! That’s one of my HotHands.”
you know The Wizard of Oz! Or was that not included in the pop-culture catch up Metatron forced on you?”
Chaps 125, 127— Dean and Cas attempt to talk again
The meeting had most definitely
In the weeks before pulling Cas out, when Dean’s every waking moment was so utterly consumed by his grief, by the fact that he
“What is what?”
Chap 120— dean's still resistant to the idea but cas isn't backing down
Dean tried to not look pleased at the revelation, but he wasn’t sure he succeeded. He couldn’t help it, knowing that the guy he was crushing on definitely batted for his team was a relief, as well as adding more weight to Sam’s insistence that Cas had been flirting with him.
“Nah, it’s fine. All else fails, I can make the pie tomorrow instead,” he said, waving his hand dismissively, and Cas beamed at him.
Cas blinked, tilting his head beguilingly.
Fire was deadly, painful, and
the weirdest thing abt falling back into yuri on ice is that it simultaneously feels like forever ago and just a year or so ago since I first got into it. like, it came out in 2016. i was 14. now I'm less than a month off being 19. time is illegal now it passes too quickly and it's weird as fuck
“Don’t worry about it too much, we aren’t running on a schedule today. Just figure out what you need to.”
But the idea of having a label was… comforting.
Dean bit his lip, visibly tense, but his shoulders slumped after another moment.
“Look, Sam, whatever feelings you think I have for Cas are unimportant here. He’s my
may or may not have left the house for like, the first time since moving today LMAOOOOO I’ve not been good at taking care of myself oops
trying to appear as heterosexual as possible and thus didn’t know how to react when those assumptions were still made about him now that he had said ‘fuck it’ and kicked down the closet door — didn’t know how to make it clear it wasn’t a reflection of them or their relationship.
Dean blinked.
Benny snorted, disbelieving.
But his death wasn’t an acceptable outcome in this situation, awake or not.
), lol, so its no surprise that its this au
this is terrible but at least its not cars fanfic. It was almost cars fanfic. Blame my online friends for that fact.
“Not— Not to do anything yet, obviously, I’m still not sure how ready I am for all that, but, well. I’ve already mentioned that I’m liable to get… ‘clingy’, as you put it, after a grooming session, and I thought—”
Dean grinned fondly across at Cas, who was sitting at the kitchen table looking grumpy (and adorably sleep ruffled, in Dean’s eyes) despite the sun shining outside.
“I can if I need to, but I don’t think I will. Have you thought about what you’ll say when you see him again?”
The man turned, key still unturned in his lock, and his look of confusion was swapped for a blinding grin when their eyes met.
“I don’t exactly have many options here. You were kinda my best bet.”
didn’t think Cas would let him wake him up this early again.)
the writing braincell's taken a steep dive off a cliff lol so y'all get this. genuinely did not know if I was gonna come back to this au or not but all my other aus weren't vibing for whatever reason soooo
, Dean? Who do we know that could and
“I love you, you know?”
Rather than responding, he glanced down at his phone again, knowing that it had rung out. There weren’t any new calls or messages yet, but the fact that Cas had called
“What did you
hung out with my best friend today, cuddled her cats, had a good time :)
And there was no guarantee that he ever would be again.
“I’m going to remind you of this next time you complain about Sam giving
any help on it?”
“I’ll just book you into some random resort near the beach, I guess, if neither of you are gonna give me guidance on what you’re actually looking for. But you
be able to stay somewhere other than home without feeling the need to be ready to pack up and go in as short a time as possible.)
um— Yeah. That would be one way of putting it.”
not that I don't plan on continuing the coffee shop/childhood friends to lovers/whatever else ends up being lumped in there fic eventually as well, but I felt like some good old fashioned 'i only know his name and I stare at him every time he comes in the store' vibes
“I just— I keep trying to think of ways to get around this that don’t involve giving in to what he wants, but I can’t think of any. If it was only me, I’d be fine, my dad never believed I’d get this far anyway. I’d just be living up to expectations. But you— You’re smart and have a future and all that shit. I don’t want one dickhead of a professor to take that away from you, especially as I’m sure he’s gonna find a way to implicate the previous work we’ve done in his units as well.”
when you get poked by the quills all night.”
loosely connected to chap 235— deans having name contemplations (because
Good weather makes for good vibes
to be dreaming, even one in the process of falling? Well, it seemed unusual, to say the least.
Cas shifted into the touch, softening under it minutely.
Jack relaxed, obviously realising Dean wasn’t mad.
Dean glanced at Cas to see him looking, unsurprisingly, incredibly bemused at Susan’s question. He hooked his foot around Cas’ ankle before deciding to field the question for the both of them.
“Hey! Credit card fraud ain’t easy, you know!” Dean winked, and dramatically swaggered across the room to meet Cas in the doorway. “That’s
“We did spend time on the beach yesterday, did we not? I haven’t lost a day somewhere?”
be pushing it down. Dean deserved happiness, no matter how he found it. Castiel had no right to feel entitled to his affections, no matter how he personally felt. Soulmate connection or not, Dean’s free will to choose who he pursued was his right.
the shoes that i impulse bought last week of depop arrived today and they bring me so much fucking joy
It was strange, taking in its new form. Looking around and knowing that he wasn’t just reliving memories, that the borders that had kept it so segregated and rigid had been torn down. It seemed like it allowed for a better afterlife, which had obviously been the goal, but Dean still didn’t think he was ready for eternal peace. The sooner Dean got through to Cas, the sooner Jack would be able to send him back to Earth with the angel in tow.
“Come on, dude! Spill.”
“Yeah, woulda been nice to know that you’ve been walking around with my matching mark for the last couple of months!”
had been. He was tempted to do it anyway, but the pastor’s voice cut through his internal mix of elation and disbelief once again.
, and frequently. It’s what happens when someone like my father gets bored.”
honeymoon fic is coming. slowly. i took an impromptu trip into a couple of different fandoms today and I'll be taking a slightly less impromptu one into another tomorrow, but given it was weeks ago now that i was like 'dw if i start writing taz drabbles as well i still love spn!!!!1!!!111!!!' and then it took me 0 seconds to forget about taz again, i doubt I'll be writing for any other fandoms any time soon. that being said, I'm planning on seeing if wtnv works as a sleep podcast for me again as i miss it and my current one is losing effectiveness (😔 rip sawbones you served me well. i still love u but my sleep brain does not) so. like. if i randomly stick tfw into nightvale a few times just deal with it. i think it would be funny to see their reactions.
they're m a r r i e d okay
Now Sam just looked confused.
for advice because…?”
If I do, I’ll make a note in the main summary of the fic of which chaps are spn and which are shadowhunters etc so that people know what they’re signing up for, and you’ll be able to tell by the chapter titles which chars it is at the very least and I’ll probably mention in the an what fandom it’s for bc obvs chars share overlap in first names etc and ive gotten rid of the ‘fandom, char/ship’ naming convention
! There aren’t that many straight reasons for watching that garbage!”
He just didn’t seem to be any more inclined to help Dean in his dramatic quest than he had been when Dean first summoned him.
my writing today was mostly a continuation of the au from yesterday (including research) which I feel kinda bad about considering I haven’t even looked at the doc for my wing fic for like, a week now b u t actually I think that’s maybe a good sign? Because I’m pretty sure the reason I got myself so hyped about it is bc I was touch starved and hadn’t left the house since before Christmas but after 5 days constantly in the company of friends has pulled me out of that as well as u could expect. Hopefully I’ll get in the right vibe to write some more of it
“You may call me Castiel.”
yeah i dunno random domestic fluff vibes were on my mind today
this is purely because i've been thinking abt the adventure zone today,,,,,, i know in canon there's something w metatron where cas like,, downloads the knowledge of a bunch of shit into his brain or something (i really have the weirdest mix of spoilers for this show) but I'm ignoring whatever the fuck that is for this because something about cas being absolutely delighted at the mcelroys shenanigans brings me great joy (also idk when that is timeline-wise so might b b4 taz existed anyway)
Dean snorted slightly and raised an eyebrow at her. While that was technically true, Claire did not have the
Chaps 46-52, 73, 75, 107— the first saturday
Cas blinked up at Dean seriously, as though he had to consider the offer, and a small smile broke over his lips.
“I’m Castiel, by the way. Castiel Novak, although I guess you’d know part of that from the gravestone.”
Cas pressed a kiss against Dean’s cheek before loosening his arms and heading to the coffee pot.
possibilities available to them now that said shit was sorted.
“You’ll never guess—”
“Wait, holy fuck,
But the avoidance and perceived rejection still stung.
(It was only Dean’s self-preservation instinct that stopped him from leaning in and stealing a kiss right at that moment. If he stole a kiss now, they wouldn’t stop until they were both breathless and the sun was risen, and Dean
Dean snorted, eyebrow raised incredulously.
WOW I WONDER WHAT IVE BEEN DOING THIS WEEK AHAHAHAHAHAHA I TOTALLY DONT WANNA MURDER INCOMPETENT REMOVALISTS RN AHAHAHAHAHAHAHABAHAHAHHAABAHBAH
Some days, Dean found it easy.
It also reminds him of how much he appreciates his boyfriend, though, as Cas has been so goddamn
It’s all small, easily explainable things— pen lines on his fingers in colours he can’t remember using that day, faint splotches on his skin that aren’t washing off in the shower as easily as he’d expect. Things that could’ve happened in the past without him raising an eyebrow.
back on my computer today! yay!
deancas hospital confession :)
to be okay with PDA! I wanna be able to do shit like holding your hand in public without feeling like I’m gonna have a friggin’ heart attack as a result. But I don’t know how to get my dumbass brain to accept that fact.”
work we just. won't meet up at all tomorrow. but I'm sure it'll be chill :)
“What, with other people? I’m not gonna cheat on you just because I miss fucking people, Cas!”
Jack isn’t doing that kinda shit.”
Sam had, unsurprisingly, done exactly what he’d said he would, and a few days after their wedding, Dean and Cas pulled up outside their accommodations for the next fortnight. The resort was far nicer than the hotel’s they tended to stay in for hunts, but not so much so that they’d feel out of place, and Dean grinned at Cas as they checked in to their suite, hands linked between them.
Ellen had sworn that Cas was legit, was the only reason she’d gotten Jo back all those years ago, and no one who put themselves through so much trouble to help a grieving and worried mother would change
“It’s fine, angel, I know you wouldn’t have called if it wasn’t important. My kids will be fine without me for a few minutes. What’s up?”
“Dean!”
“I’m okay, Dean. I’m just finding my energy reserves are low today.”
different vibe to the fluff I've been piling on y'all this week, which explains why it has different vibes to the rest lol
Because seriously, fucking
“Look, man, it’s your choice. Just… take care of yourself, ok?”

The first time Dean has to deal with Miracle
So, no, Dean didn't tend to think of himself as
“Cas, it’s about half-past nine. This
Why didn’t he—”
“Well, he’s been careful
Growing up, Sammy had said he’d understand if he had one.
Their chance comes about twenty minutes later, in the form of Castiel’s older brother Gabriel.
Dean smiled softly at him, leaning in to brush a soft kiss against his lips before pulling away once more.
got one of those earphone jack adaptors for iphones yesterday, finally being able to use my wired earphones with my phone again is so nice sfhadjba
But as he walked through the gardens Cas had pulled them into, the familiar weight of the angel’s hand solid against his own, and admired the brightness of his partners face, he realised that in this moment, he truly had no cares in the world.
“So, uh… Have you got
dean is like hmst im bi but my dad sucks. mainly musing about elephants in the room. don't question me im babey and tired
“It’s okay if you are struggling to reconcile what you feel about your father now that you are more confident within yourself with the years you spent looking up to him and modelling your behaviour into someone you thought he could be proud of.”
Chaps 167, 168, 169, 178— the full second incident
i've got a headache today, which is >:(
Cas pushed forwards into a firmer kiss, and Dean’s mind blanked for a moment. Once it had finished rebooting, he surprised himself by finding the strength of mind to pull away again.
have an early update today! im tryna see if shifting my writing time to before dinner on days where its an option will be a better mental health vibe for me bc i have more energy and am thus less concerned abt the quality etc
Cas frowned in a way that showed Dean he knew
of their countries who were all desperate to get in his good graces, and felt even more annoyed about the fact that they hadn’t been given a moment alone.
If Cas had been expecting commiseration from Meg, he’d be sorely disappointed. Because his traitor of a best friend just threw her head back and cackled.
Today’s is more enemies to lovers shenanigans because I have limited time to write this in (heading home on pt from uni to go to my mums bday celebration) and college vibes are the easiest to draw on rn (that’s what uni does to u ig)
have Cas by his side.
Cas nodded.
“I have
Castiel’s smile widened, and Dean could’ve
At Sam’s question, Castiel recalled Dean asking the exact same thing, back when they had only met a handful of times. It was funny how the brothers could mirror each other so well even unintentionally, although Sam’s question seemed less out of the blue than Dean’s had been.
Cas practically
, Dean, and admiring your looks from afar did absolutely nothing to prepare me for the full experience of talking to you.”
also am actually planning on starting hannibal after this, was gonna watch the first ep earlier today and instead had a vc with my best friend which was a vibe, we're gonna see each other in person soon and i can't wait to hug her again
truly tempted to just. rewatch lazarus rising so i can just,,,, stare at cas at the end without feeling like my mum will judge me (i mean she already did tbf so i probs could've). yes i have issues.
Cas’ face filled with something like wonder, and he barely had the chance to get out a breathless
Dean froze, staring at Azazel in shock. At his side, Cas seemed similarly surprised, and Azazel’s smug look intensified.
The dreams were nothing, he was sure. It was just… his minds way of processing falling, the change from angel to human.
melb lockdown extended till my birthday les gooooooooooooooooooooooooo
It’s just— Castiel is so
“I knew it! You’re only with me for my body, aren’t you? After all these years we’ve had together!”
Dean had half hoped that Charlie would’ve forgotten about what she’d noticed at the café, but he’d known it was unlikely. Sure enough, a few hours later she was letting herself into his apartment without any fanfare, takeout in hand.
however, s3 does
“What
“Yeah, the afternoon rush can be insane,” Dean explained. “It’s because of how close we are to both the local high school and the college campus— people swing by after their classes to get a pick-me-up. Any reason you’re out in particular?”
I'm so fucking stressed rn honestly I have 3 things due this week and I haven't even
feelings.
In reality, the only thing it had done was open up a slightly more viable solution to the two of them.
of said sticky situations without too much issue.
. Cas didn’t always come on hunts, these days, sometimes because he had angelic duties to attend to but more often recently because he had something he wanted to get done on base, a small project that he was filling his time with now that he had that free will he’d strived so hard to defend.
He noted down the order she gave, focused enough to at least act semi-competent at his job, but his eyes kept drifting to stare at Cas through the next couple of orders. Most of his customers seemed too caffeine-deprived to notice, but to his misfortune, Charlie had
After about two weeks of searching, in which they’d seemingly made as little progress as people who’d spent two weeks straight looking through books for a ritual that quite possibly didn’t exist could, Sam sat across from Dean and asked if he’d maybe consider taking a break.
Chaps 156, 157, 162— we get a look in on whats happening with sam
Castiel met his eyes when he stopped walking, and cocked his head curiously before holding out a hand.
The how and the why of the ritual's success were much less important than its existence, in the long run. As long as he kept having these quiet moments with Cas, Dean could take on whatever the world threw at him.
we got the photos of the house done and i again did not get enough work done on my assignments (why can't i fucking w o r k this week)
“So, where do I start?”
While he spoke, his hands had migrated from Dean’s chest to the back of his neck, and he began gently stroking the base of Dean’s hairline.
not, Cas, that’s— that’s literally why they were designed. It’s just— Well— Aren’t they a bit
Cas perked up.
moving house is weird and stressful :/
In response, Dean shook his head ruefully while flipping his mute button across, tamping down the instinctive feelings of worry. Claire most
I'll try and post tomorrows earlier again but that's mostly to help fix my sleep schedule again, its not at it's best rn (also because if I continue the trend of writing and posting these later each day eventually I might just. not finish b4 midnight lol, esp since often the later it gets the slower I write. also the quality probably goes down slightly lol)
, but the mixed thoughts that followed were. And the clench of his heart when Dean sent a similar grin to pretty waitresses and ladies in bars had probably existed back when he was still in denial about how ‘profound’ their bond was, but he’d pushed it down in favour of enjoying the good spirits Dean was usually in after coming back from a one-night-stand.
Sam sighed, shutting the book he’d been looking through. Dean felt slightly guilty, as he hadn’t been much good for research today, but the hyperfocused determination he’d been living with for weeks had given way to a sort of anxious tension ever since Sam had mentioned the portal.
“…Yes.”
“Yeah, Cas. I— Kinda figured you knew? I just assumed my bond was broken, as I asked you about angels and soulmate bonds once, and you said that you guys didn’t need them so you didn’t get them. I just figured that God or whoever it is that assigns matches had decided I was undeserving of a soulmate bond, or that it would distract me from being Michael’s vessel somehow.”
Dean froze in return. Although he’d been mentally referring to Castiel by the shortened version of his name for some time now, he’d always been sure to keep to ‘Castiel’ when the other student was around him. He couldn’t exactly go around having a nickname for his rival, after all.
long. Idk when I'll post tomorrow, it'll depend on how I feel I'm tracking when it hits ~1/2pm 😔
track record for abiding by the screen-free rule their principal was so desperate to enforce.
i may write more of teen sam helping dean hide his sexuality because i have not given sam enough love in these drabbles but i find it easiest to write for dean lol
around the subject hasn’t achieved anything but stress on both of our parts. It’s been years, I highly doubt things are going to change for us, emotionally at least.”
“Are you alright, babe? You seem… out of it.”
Cas had barely put the pen to his page to test it before he was holding his hand out again. It probably said something that neither of them raised a fuss about this particular song-and-dance anymore, not like they had when Dean first started handing Cas dried out pens.
It was still dark out when Dean woke up.
As time goes by, as he and Cas grow closer, he finds himself cursing out his soulmate bond more and more.
Castiel was spared the pleasure of replying when he found himself coughing again, the burn in his throat impossible to ignore once more.
But still, a part of him was terrified that Cas would shut the conversation down, say that he didn’t want kids after all, and that part of him kept putting the conversation off for another week.
ive had soft relationship vibes on my mind today lol
to tell Dean? Can’t we figure this out without worrying him?”
The smile Dean seemed to constantly wear around Cas widened, and he shifted even closer to Cas as he met her eyes properly for the first time since he entered the bar.
Dean remembered as well. Her daughter, Tasha, been a few years younger than him, but not young enough that her admiration was overtly uncomfortable to deal with. He
edit: holy shit just realised this is chap 50, wtf how has it been 50 days cv,cdnmvskvjn. exciting achievement!!
would they do rescue you, if you’ve never met? How do we know that it’s not someone I meet while looking for a way to help you, and your protests at me looking for a way for you to get out of the deal aren’t screwing with your chances to meet them?”
“Cas?”
We dk how convenient that time is for y'all non-australians (timezones are so annoying lol) but if any of you are awake/around we both appreciate you stopping by!!!!! I'll be hanging in chat as a mod etc and I'm very pumped for her bc she's wanted to stream for a while,
friendship is weird.
I'm struggling to get a grip on writing cas again i feel, so sorry if he's slightly ooc. probably doesn't help that i keep writing him with differing levels of human and angelness (and au-ness) and I feel like that would impact how he behaves in small ways even if through it all he's still Cas. i dunno, i may be overthinking things and yall may read this like 'nah it feels like cas' or 'yeah its ooc slightly but in the same way All ur cas writing is slightly ooc' or something lol
So walking into class and seeing Dean smiling kindly at him was honestly a breath of fresh air.
Dean grinned brightly.
The first time that Prince Dean Winchester sees the man he is to be wed to, it isn’t in person.
be leaving to let him know before he’s procured fake papers, you know that right?”
you got up?”
Cas licked his lips before nodding, tension obvious in his body, and Dean smiled reassuringly before leaning in again.

update a couple of my neglected aus (and I'm planning on updating more after today) + this isn't the coffee shop au or in any way connected to being a college au.
Of course, ultimately, Sam’s protests meant nothing. Dean had made a choice he couldn’t back out of, and no amount of research was going to get him to
, slow your roll, I barely caught any of that. Come again?”

chaps 110, 115, 116, 135, 147, 148, 158, 180, 199— contemplations on the complications
“It’s okay, Cas, I got you, just let it out honey, I’m here for you,” Dean murmured into Cas’ hair, rubbing his back gently.
Cas looked at the punnets stacked in front of him, head tilted consideringly.
i'm happy to say i officially finished writing the fix it last night, a full month and a bit before I'm planning on posting it dgfzjshj. it's amazing what three days worth of intent writing will get you!!!
“Why?”
“That seems like the most likely explanation,” he explained, and Dean nodded.
this was just going to be me projecting the fact that despite me having like 0 cooking practice, my mum getting a job at a grocery store has thrown me in the deep end on prepping dinners for myself, and this week especially I've been cooking Actual Things. And it takes so fucking long bc I'm so not practiced but i have 0 time management skills (aka I've been having Late Dinners). however i did not get that far as cas and dean got distracted.
castiel muses on friendship
Chap 140— dean tells sam his words
also I'm bullshitting like, all of this interdimensional magic shit lmao
Dean tried to respond, tried to find the words to explain the depth of his feelings, but the words failed him. Cas seemed to sense this, as he squeezed Dean’s hand tightly when Dean opened and closed his mouth a few times.
Well. It was no wonder that he’d been saddled with a one-sided bond.
Sammy
your soulmate??”
Cas cocked his head, clearly confused.
Bobby had left him mostly alone, probably assuming Dean was turning the idea of angels and God around in his head before making any decisions about Castiel, so he wasn’t offended by the obvious surprise in the older hunter’s eyes when he
have not been as on top of all of today's drama as I have some of the other major s16 events (does this even count as s16 still???) but what I
Cas tugged Dean closer to drop a kiss on his cheek and envelope him in a gentle hug.
Like, it’s really,
“Technically speaking, I’m not a Winchester,” Cas pointed out, and Dean made a considering noise.
hey, at least I managed to link it back to an au!
He told himself he was just being practical, waiting for the ‘right time’ in between all of their hunts and apocalypse averting activities. Justified things as him not wanting to spring the subject on Dean, wanting things to instead come up naturally in a situation where the hunter wouldn’t get spooked. Denied the idea that he was being self-serving in any way by avoiding the topic, that was allowing himself to cling to these moments where Dean didn’t
Sam softened a bit at that, but he remained wary.
but no seriously i hope i have some unit overlap w her, she seemed cool and nice and let me talk about the angsty au i talked abt a lil in yesterdays notes but also I'm bad at keeping up friendships
“Like… never ever? Is it an angel thing? Or is it because I’m, well…
, building up quietly in the background with no input or help from Dean or Cas. Ten years of close friendship is a hell of a thing to build a relationship out of, in all honesty.
“That’s Sammy for ya.”
He knows
as always im bullshitting all of this ignore if its explicitly against canon lore please and thank <3
Dean know?
“Yeah, babe. He’s just waking up.”
It was amazing, in some ways, how calming fire could be.
“…Yes! It was a very urgent matter. They didn’t want any potential evidence rotting… away…”
Dean hadn’t ever really been friends with Cas, not the way Sam was, but that wasn’t exactly strange. He’d been in Sam’s year, after all, and he’d only really started coming over to the Winchester’s after Dean had hit college. Still, they’d been friendly enough, and knowing there was a familiar face around was enough to ease some of the tension Dean had been carrying since the move.
“Neither, really. She just looks… almost
i named the lady susan bc it felt weird not having a name for her, and edited the first chap covering this encounter to reflect that fact fkzghdfk
post it notes are cute ok
deserving of someone like Cas, would the angels
still, despite all the shit they’ve put him through since he fell. He gets excited about the unimportant things that humanity comes with, he watches the Discovery Channel whenever they’re in a motel with a television, he grins so brightly at Dean when they go to a new diner. This is the angel that fell in love with humanity and developed free will to defend it, and that fact shines through no matter where they are in the country.
“Well, I’d say we could bring the duvet with us, but I’m not sure the resort would like that very much. We can snuggle for body heat under a blanket?”
dragging me out of Hell would talk.”
our future prospects.”
Of course, his general musings on the concept were very quickly overshadowed by his and Sammy’s other issues — mainly the whole demon deal thing, really — and soon the most he felt on the subject was a brief sliver of regret that he’d likely never get the chance to get to know them.
“I just have a bad feeling this is going to be more complicated than that. You don’t know this professor like I do, Sam.”
all the doors were being guarded, two royal courts were currently occupying the castle) before he recognised the soldier and relaxed.
He felt at peace, out on the road. For the hour or so he was out there, no worries would bother him. It didn’t matter what else was happening in the world, where the latest apocalypse was at in its progression, how fucked up their latest hunt had gotten them. All that mattered was the thrum of Baby’s engine and the glide of her wheels on the open road.
Dean frowns, confused, but Benny sends him a look before he can interrupt.
“Oh, did I forget to mention I obscured where your soul was in Heaven so Cas wouldn’t catch on?” Jack asked, but before anyone else could make a move to talk, Cas was gone.
this is up slightly later today bc i needed to do restful activities for longer than usual to scrape together enough spoons to get the motivation to write, even tho it'll fuck me over slightly more in the long run as I'll be up later overall. energy things are weird.
He could do this. He could get through one interaction with a hot guy without seeming like a massive creeper or the disaster bi he truly was. He did it with hot girls all the time.
At that, Magnus’ eyes dropped briefly, and an overwhelming sense of loss seemed to wash over him. Alec grasped his hand gently, care in his every movement, but Magnus was already wearing his bright grin again as he looked between Dean and Cas.
Benny glanced back out into the storefront, this time getting a good look at their newest customer, who was looking mildly concerned about the mug.
“I— At the time, I sincerely believed what I was telling you, and technically those words are not a lie, but I started having dreams about you when I first started falling. It just… took me a while to acknowledge what they were, and what they meant for me and my angelic status.”
, Cas. Of course I do. How could I not?”
He just wished they had any clue as to who the fuck it was that had rescued him, given Sam was no help.
“Cas, trust me.
, he just… Didn’t trust
Soulmate marks (chaps 76, 77, 82, 83, 92)— their convo resolves
listen to it, part of him felt like the voice in the back of his head was right. He wasn’t like Bobby or Sam, he wasn’t patient enough to be a resource for other, newer hunters to come to and ask for advice. He was handy with cars, but didn’t have any actual qualifications to work on them and didn’t exactly know how he’d go getting hired to work as a mechanic. (Also, part of him couldn’t help but feel he would be a disappointment, if he went from literally saving the world to fixing Joe from down the road’s car so that he could get to his mundane office job every day. Castiel had assured him he wouldn’t be, that all he needed to consider was whether or not a job like that would make him happy, but that didn’t stop Dean from thinking it.)
chaps 110, 115, 116, 135— dean and sam really do be talking still.
“Guess we should get you into some first aid classes, huh? For now, though, I trust that you know how to slap a band-aid on it for me.”
the writing braincell did not bless me w its presence today soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sorry that this is. questionable. and not a full scene. i wasn't in the right vibe for most of the aus i have going (for writing in general tbh) (including this one tbh) bUT when I came up with this idea i did some brainstorming of ideas for scenes and shit so i figured that chipping away at this is better than nothing
He knows what it means, of course. Everyone does.
“Dean, it’s only a quatre past 5.”
as such i was stressed when i was writing this so don't expect it to be good lol. i have no clue why I'm so attached to this au lmaoooooo
“No,” he rumbled, eyes opening blearily. “It sounded…
“It took you several years to realise I held romantic feelings for you, even though I felt they were fairly clear. Am I not obvious enough in my affections?”
for them, just for Dean, just to see his smile and feel his joy in the arms that he threw around the angel and the press of their lips together (and oh had their lips pressed together… Sam was lucky enough to not be in the room for
“You can go take a nap if you need to, babe, me and Sammy can handle stuff alone for a little while. Did you sleep alright last night?”
Jack smiled slightly.
“No, I did talk to him. I asked him for help on the upcoming assignment for Professor Crowley’s class.”
i went to a picnic with fellow ace melbourners today including one of my best friends, so that was a vibe. i also wrote a 2.5k letter to my mum abt my gender identity bc although I'm out to her it wasn't purposefully so i haven't been able to like. fully explain it to her and i think that'll be the easiest way to get her to have a proper conception of it at all. however that means I'm also very tired and as such this is probably very bad.
“Well, it’s not exactly like you

“Well,
“I dunno, babe, I hadn’t really given it much thought before? I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about birds.”
“Wouldn’t that delay your baking?”
Sure, it wasn’t exactly an experience he’d love to repeat, especially not if that repetition involved all the nerves he’d experienced on his first go around, but it wasn’t as terrible as he’d imagined it might be. Bobby had just called him an ‘idjit’ for thinking that his sexuality might change Bobby’s opinion of him, and Sam… hadn’t actually been surprised at all.
Dean nodded, but didn’t stop backing away, and Cas did his best to send him a comforting smile.
Dean blinked.
Dean leant in to brush their lips together softly before pulling away again.
“Uh, yeah. It’s just easier to say, yanno? Only one syllable and everything.”
The first time Dean sees Jack, he can’t quite believe how
“If… you’re sure?”
“…That would be my fault.”
He’d said his piece. It was time to see how Dean would respond.
Besides, Dean said he wanted the chance to spoil him.
“Are you telling me you won’t kiss me until you’re fully better?”
“Ah, you know me, Cas. I’m not good with words and shit, not like you and Sammy.”
this is another prime example of 'i came in w a plan and they took too long to get there' lmaoooo. i shall just extend he when i post full honeymoon fic.
nothing exciting happened to me today i was just At Home
i made smart mental health decisions today (didn't go hang out with a group of friends bc i knew i wasn't up for it energy or social interaction-wise based on how i did in class) so like. that's a good thing ig? seeing them might've been nice if i was less exhausted over everything but the one person i'd really wanna see wasn't gonna b there so i decided that it wasn't worth how i'd feel afterwards.
But on the other, it had been a
“Hey Casteil!” Shouted a voice. I looked up. It was…. Dean Winchesterr!
The last night they spend on the beach is… peaceful, in a melancholy way. Without really planning it, they end up sitting on the sand together, legs tangled in a mimicry of the first ‘proper’ day of their honeymoon.
dean struggles with talking to cas— sorta related to chap 166 (similar vibes and could be seen as a continuation probs) but not initially intended as one <3
“Well, even if it was, it shows that the coffee machine is liable to randomly deciding to work again, and waiting has a non-zero chance of effectively getting me caffeinated.”
“I was in the cafeteria, I thought that you’d know?”
instead I read james bond fanfic and watch a bunch of bdg's videos bc productivity just. does not exist for me this week. for anything
“Complimented your pride pin.”
“But what if the family that ends up adopting one of them would’ve otherwise gotten an older cat, one that’s lived at the shelter far longer?”
But Gabriel had no qualms about tactically manoeuvring Dean around the ballroom as they talked, going from conversation to conversation in such a way that before long, they were not only on the same side of the ballroom as Castiel, but genuinely engaged in a conversation with him and a few other nobles.
“Ended up buying half the store?” Cas asked, eyes dancing, and he stepped forward to brush a kiss against Dean’s cheek when he nodded. “We’ll just have to work out how to make an even more elaborate display come Christmas.”
“Well, we all have our own personal failings.”
“I knew it! The guy at the shop this morning, right? You both could barely look away from each other.”
Chaps 167, 168, 169, 178, 192— lead up to scenario 3
“Cas, who the fuck told you that and where are they now, because I need to go kick the ass of whoever led you into thinking that way.”
adding in the weird mix of intentions people could have, especially considering he was apparently fairly conventionally attractive. Romantic and sexual interest seemed too easy to mix up with platonic intentions, even more so in the early stages, and Cas was tired of missing the signs. How did you work out someone was showing
“I shall have to ask her opinion on how several character arcs progressed, then, I would be interested in hearing her thoughts now that I am done with the first campaign.”
as the case may be.”
He must have stirred, or made
Castiel flushed and paused in the door of their room when he saw Dean sitting up in bed.
Sam, apparently, didn’t mind that.
“Dad’s on a hunting trip, and he hasn’t been home for a few days”
Cas froze at the weight of Dean’s gaze before sighing.
Dean rolled his eyes before planting a kiss on Castiel’s cheek.
theres actually a scene and a bit that fits in between this drabble and the last for this au, but it follows the episode so y'all can put the pieces together yourselves lol. I'm trying to toe the line of putting enough info in that this all flows and not completely rehashing what happens in the show, but i have no clue if I'm succeeding or not lol
y’all I don’t know I’m tired
Dean grinned, cocky and sure of himself in a way that hadn’t shown a minute ago.
ever—”
If he couldn’t figure out how to get out of ropes binding his arms soon, he figured he could consider his luck well and truly run out. And he likely wouldn’t be afforded the privilege of a quick and painless death before being tossed on the fire tonight.
And, well…”
“Why would we, Dean? We don’t exactly have souls, and we do not have a need for fulfilling connections the way humans do.”
that might indicate he had a chance cross Cas’ face, well.
Benny held up his hands in an ‘I’m not gonna say anything’ way, and Cas smiled softly at Dean.
y'all have no idea how excited i am to say that i have finally,
John Winchester, of course, had had no time for giving him or Sammy stupid nicknames. Dean had done his best, though, and although he doubted he succeeded for
truly my brain channelled rancid vibes today hopefully that improves tomorrow <3
“That seems sensible,” he agreed, before glancing down at the clothes he was wearing. “However, I should probably change into a more appropriate outfit first. May we meet in 10 or so minutes?"
They sat quietly for another moment, steadily meeting each other’s gaze, before Dean dropped it in favour of reaching for the water spray bottle he’d missed earlier.
legitimately i'm planning on posting 7 honeymoon drabbles, theoretically culminating in me posting a complete honeymoon fic comprised of said drabbles with a few added connecting scenes because i am filled w fluff vibes and desire others who donot like drabble comps to also b filled with these vibes
“Wh— What? What do you mean?”

“Hello, Dean,” Cas replied, a warm smile playing at his lips.

“Either way, my original point still stands. I don’t know how we can get past this without fucking over
Not in the slightest. He just… had some issues he had to work through still. And Cas was more understanding about it than Dean thought he deserved— He never seemed resentful or annoyed when Dean pulled away, just kind. He’d give Dean’s hand a comforting squeeze before dropping it, and was just so
“By the Angel, sometimes I forget how

“We’ve been chosen by a parent, Dean.”
Like, he knew it was a part of parenthood— the tiny baby he’d held in his arms when they first brought Jack home had to turn into one of the snarky teenagers he taught every day
“Cas—
This was usually a signal that they were slated to meet their soulmate soon. Not immediately, not even necessarily in the next few months, but soon enough that fate kicked into high gear to say ‘Hey. Remember this person. Reach out to them when you meet in person.’
“Well, God is real, but he’s a dick,” Dean offered after a moment, and a grin crossed over Cas’ face even as he sighed at Dean’s bluntness.
“…Yes? What other soulmate thing could we be talking about?”
Because he is damn lucky. He’s fucked up so many times since Cas first pulled him out of Hell, and he knows he’ll fuck up again. Overcoming the kind of things he was taught growing up isn’t something that happens overnight.
Cas smiled across at him cautiously, their knees tucked to their chest.
“Romantic attraction and sexual attraction aren’t intrinsically linked, Dean. I still care about you very much, and would like to pursue a relationship with you if, you’re, well, comfortable with it. Or
anything in town.
This isn’t unexpected, considering his status. Rather than meeting the man in a tavern, or at the market, and choosing to spend the rest of his life with him, he is informed of his betrothal in a routine meeting with his father and their advisory staff. So when he first sets eyes on his future husband, it is in the portrait of the other prince that Bobby hands across to him with a consoling smile.
— the crackle they heard when they camped out on cold winter nights, the force that had ultimately pulled Dean back together with his family and towards Cas in the first place.
it for the grooming parts (winkwinknudgenudge)
to be dreaming, even one in the process of falling? Well, it seemed unusual, to say the least.
However, he wasn’t sure he’d get through the next hour of research without caffeine.
Yeah idk I sat down and this came out
“What if it’s metaphorical, Dean?”
Cas sighed.
Tension Dean hadn’t even realised he was holding bled out of his form, and he grinned as he finished affixing a gauze to Cas’ arm.
, as of late. Like whatever force God had left in charge of developing soulmate dreams had gotten pissed off at him ignoring the truth and had stuck up a dozen neon signs and a loudspeaker all blaring ‘DEAN WINCHESTER IS YOUR SOULMATE’ at him every night.
so have a very typical 'my brain is not functioning I'm tired as hell leave me alone to sleep' drabble lol, as I always seem to write these sorta vibes when I do not wish to be awake
When Cas hit the front of the line, Dean offered him a (hopefully) comforting smile.
Dean wasn’t quite sure what he expected to find in Cas’ room after the angel asked him to swing by, but it certainly wasn’t this.
It wasn’t until he saw the tension leaking out from Cas’ stance that he realised how stressed this whole conversation had been making the angel. A small smile crossed his lips, and Dean couldn’t resist tugging him in for a gentle kiss.
This time, Dean actually
Dean did just that, but not before taking advantage of Sam’s distraction to wink at Cas and pull him in for a quick kiss. Sam sighed again, not having to look to know what was going on, and a few more minutes passed in relative silence.

“For what it’s worth, I’m sorry, I—”
(See the end of the chapter for
When they first get Cas out of the Empty, he won’t meet Dean’s eyes.
“I’m Castiel, and this tired idiot is my husband Dean. We’re on our honeymoon.”
He just groaned miserably at her in response.)
“At least she seems to be accepting if he is,” he says and they both contemplate the struggles Dean had gone through to accept this side of himself before continuing their conversation.

“That was—”

He said it simply, like it explained everything, and in some ways it did. Dean smiled down at him softly, leant in to leave a lingering kiss against his slightly sweaty forehead, then pulled back slowly.
bc we love hopelessly projecting onto chars
Sam could apparently see the moment Dean flipped back from nervous anticipation to resigned acceptance, because his face softened.
“Ah, yes,” Cas stated, nodding dryly. “All that pop-culture knowledge you have is absolutely vital when it comes down to vanquishing spirits. It’s a wonder that I made it through hunts before you started introducing me to television.”
long it would take them to figure the whole Jimmy issue out, it did put a damper on things a lot of the time. He’d decided to let Cas take the lead on things, figuring he had a better judge of both Jimmy’s boundaries and Jimmy’s alertness at any given moment, but sometimes he just wanted to hug his boyfriend without having to check if the man his boyfriend was technically possessing was awake or asleep.
“It’s just, the honey latte I bought last time was a daily special, and I’m not very familiar with the varieties of drinks on offer here.”
It was way more confusing than it really should be, in all honesty. But hopefully he’d have many more years down on earth trying to puzzle it all out.
talk of sleep and general fluff
was supposed to be ‘the one’, so finding out I have another soulmate...”
“Oh, I’m sure you’ll see him soon.”
Cas glanced up and managed a smile that looked more like a grimace.
“Do you mean do I know that you are resurrectionists? Does Dean make a habit of acquiring friends in the medical field that
Cas’ expression didn’t change, even as he took a sip of his ridiculously sweetened coffee.
“Yeah. I did too.”

Dean took a deep breath in.
The morning after Cas and Dean finally,
Sam sighed, slouching further.
That being said, Castiel seemed more stilted in their conversation than he had expected.
As time had gone on, things had gotten both better and worse.
“I think that counts as a success,” Dean smirked, and Cas grinned brightly in response.
This particular habit of his was never more evident than on the days that Castiel came into the coffee shop him and Benny worked at.
like am I am ember??? right now I don’t think so. but then is my
Dean grinned ruefully.
Their relationship was made up of little moments like that, of small smiles and I-just-thought-you-might-appreciate-it-gifts and plates pushed at each other towards the end of meals. They’d spent so long denying things, denying the significance of their bond even while knowing ‘profound’ didn’t nearly cover how much they cared about each other, and now that they
A part of him thought he should try anyway— he didn’t think he’d be able to hide the petal from Sam once he coughed it out, and he didn’t know if he could convince Sam to keep his condition hidden from Dean. Sam knowing would be bad enough— he didn’t want
one of them and this is my coping mechanism. ignore how short it is lmao it fits the criteria (aka is 100+ words fkxjdh)
Sam simply sent him a bitchface and asked why Dean had thought he’d wanna leave Cas in the Empty anymore than Dean would.
he rly do be thinking
Dean, now finished with his cooking, sat across from Castiel with a cheeky smile.
Also, Charlie had said she wanted to hear he’d made
chap 131, 153, 226— direct continuation from 153, dean and cas' convo
yeah sorry for the weird vibes on this one, i had a serious conversation with one of my best friends abt how disillusioned our gen is with the world and capitalism and also successfully dissuaded them from a slightly ecofascist mindset (in the 'is humanity even worth saving' way which like. very valid to grapple with as humanity sucks at times b u t it's important to remember that humanity isn't this amorphous whole, it's made up of individuals, many of whom are good and worthwhile and deserve to live happy and full lives even if they are not born yet) and then immediately sat down to write this as I write in the evenings and me and my friend were talking through the late afternoon lol. this is like, a
“I, uh. Isortamaybesuggestedhecouldtakeonourname.”
Eventually, though, it becomes impossible to ignore. He wakes up with his fingers on one hand absolutely covered in ink, as if he’d broken a pen in his sleep, and any thoughts that it might have been an incredibly weird sign of sleep walking are dashed when he literally watches the ink fade as though being washed away.
“Who do you

But for now, he carries his secret in silence, holds it close to his core where it thumps in time with his heartbeat, pulses around every cell of his body alongside his blood, lights up his soul in its brilliance.

“There was a stage where that was me to Sammy,” he admitted, more sheepish about that fact than he ever had been previously.
“Dean, I know you hate this kind of work. And I get it, I really do. But we need to get through these storage rooms before we can properly set this place up for travelling hunters, and that means all hands on deck, so stop distracting Cas before I have to separate you two entirely.”
“I’m not so sure I do, actually.”
“As I said earlier, I have entered molt. It can be a… somewhat difficult process for angels, as while we are in human vessels we are not afforded the flexibility required to reach all of our feathers with ease. Things are made simpler when you have a partner who can help you groom them.”
Cas glanced back at him, head tilted as best as it could be with the awkward angle.

“I can’t exactly go to your brother complaining that Jimmy keeps messing up my proposal. Or saying that I’m getting frustrated with the issues we have with finding times for intimacy due to Jimmy’s continued presence in our shared body. What if he thinks that means I’m frustrated with the relationship as a whole??”
“Oh, I am,” he replied darkly.
figured that given i'm not gonna have in person uni for the rest of the year i should try to see if i can channel those vibes even while at home given i have like 3 different college aus LMAOOOOOOOO

“I know what a podcast is, Cas, you just took me by surprise. Should’ve figured you’d be into that nerdy shit like Sammy.”
“Ah, that’s okay. You were the one who said you needed help, dude, if you’ve figured out what you were having issues with then that’s a good thing. Is Meg your... girlfriend?”
He still wouldn’t be, honestly, if it wasn’t happening as frequently as it was. He finds himself doing daily skin checks, the way he did when he was a young teen and still listening to the voice in the back of his head that whispered maybe — just maybe — he deserved someone who would undoubtedly love him for who he was. Things are going to shit, have been since before he ended up in and out of Hell, but it becomes a lifeline for him.

between them for years now), and he would until the end of times if Dean didn’t make his own move in this newly vocalised conversation.
chap 94— their reunion continues
Dean doesn’t always understand
one day (his most elaborate daydreams around a future with Cas had ended just after an imagined confession, when he’d dared to imagine anything at all— repression could be a bitch at times), Magnus and Alec spared a moment to glance at each other in obvious amusement.
Little does Dean know that just across campus, Castiel Novak is frowning worriedly at his computer, head cocked to one side in his confusion, staring at the nearly identical email he had just received.
did I write this purely because I realised I’ve never had Cas say assbutt in one of these? maybe. and like. looking at the fandom page for it (which i was both delighted and not surprised to find), he says it like 3 times in canon. I still love it though.
Chaps 46-52, 73, 75, 107, 141, 177, 181, 195, 213— idk theyre doing mini golf now. this follows more directly from chap 195
“Yeah, I’ll take some. Just black— no milk or sugar and
“If that’s what helps you rest at night,” he stated dryly, and Dean choked on his coffee.
No, Jack had no power over the Empty. It wasn’t his domain to control. Sam and Dean were on their own for this, no deus ex machina was gonna swoop in to solve their problems.
Sam frowned, considering.
“I love Jack, but he doesn’t have to share a bed with me, so I’m not sure he cares,” Cas said, the rumblings of a laugh building in his words, and Dean played up a mock-offended gasp.

religious man, and the idea that his body is going to be used to further science is an idea I greatly enjoy.”
The tenth time Dean sees Castiel, it’s when the other prince is walking down the aisle.
I've been watching a lot of michael reeves and lilypichu (offlinetv in general tbh) bc michael uploading again made me realise a) i haven't rewatched his vids in a while and b) i never subbed to otv for some reason and only had watched a couple of their vids. in some ways its been a vibe because i love the chaotic energy but on the other i am procrastinating way too fucking much. this is not relevant at all to today's drabble but i figured i tend to tell yall whats going on in my life and this week that's been forming shiny new parasocial relationships to cope (also it explains why this is a bit distracted lol)
“Look, I’d just show you, but it’s too fucking cold for me to be pulling my shirt off right now. They say ‘I’m the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition.’”
See, Castiel was a fucktonne braver than Dean was about certain topics. That bravery had led to him forcibly pulling Dean’s head out of his ass a few months back, when Dean had almost died on a hunt. Cas had been
got distracted with catching up on a youtubers videos today lol—
talking about him, and that there hadn’t been any dramatic mix-ups, is freak the fuck out.
“You’ve heard of it? I didn’t know if it would be your ‘speed’, so to speak.”
Despite the amount of focused attention he’d put on trying to organise the wedding in a way where it would run smoothly, Dean had no real opinions on what he and Cas would do for the honeymoon.
supposed to be a drabble comp, after all.
yet more contemplations on free will
Dean had a lot of things that he thought of saying in response to that, primarily ‘why didn’t
“Not… exactly? I don’t know if I’ve talked about this with you before, but despite angels and their vessels not requiring sleep in the traditional sense, the human’s that we possess are still aware and taking in information that their mind’s need to process. This means they go through periods akin to REM sleep, where they aren’t fully conscious of the outside world and the actions the angel possessing them is undertaking.”
Afterwards, at the reception, a sense of disbelief hangs over him.
wasn’t it, that the one day he was determined to do something about his crush was the one day said crush wasn’t in class. He
Dean Winchester didn’t have a soulmate.
Cas snorted.
It had been such a long time since he even
“Ok, good. So you know that everything I say to you comes from a place of genuine affection and care.”
im genderfluid so my lived experience is obviously different to that of an ftm trans person, but obvs I have all the love and respect in the world for y’all. also I went into this going ‘ok how could I see dean coming out to John go down’ then ‘and how can I make it still fit in canon’ because my brain has been blaring the goddamn ‘dads on a hunting trip’ quote constantly as it’s seemingly in Every Episode Recap for season 1 & 2.

“Probably not.”
random softness
Honestly, given the ridiculous amount of stammering he’d done when faced with Cas’ bright blue stare, it was a miracle Cas had decided to give the coffee shop another go.

i wasn't planning on writing this again today (as u can probably tell I've been tryna rotate through aus over the past lil while) bUT i think that not worrying abt that and just. writing for what i want to write for even if its a few days in a row of it is much more sustainable.
When Dean and Cas stumbled out of the Empty hand in hand, it took them both a second to realise something was wrong.
flying got him this nervous, didn’t have any specific incidents he could point to as having awoken this deep-rooted fear within him, but he guessed things just worked like that sometimes.
“And what about your soulmate! It’s not just
Only time would tell.
technically it this could/should be called internalised biphobia given dean b bi bUT given its abt liking dudes/being seen out and about with cas rather than liking multiple genders i went with homophobia. can u tell I'm tired and rambly lol
🤷🤷🤷 I’m tired today yall (although I saw my best hs friend today and we went op-shopping/out to lunch so it’s a Good tired)
want to start from the beginning then, which is fair.”
All this to say, Dean no longer knew if he wanted to keep to his usual birthday tradition. Although the peace of the open road still appealed to him, part of him was loath to give up the quiet mornings he’d been sharing with Cas lately. The comfort of his angel’s arms around him and the soft intimacy afforded by lying in with him for an hour or so before getting up and preparing for the day.

“That’s… not exactly going to be an issue.”
Dean rubbed the back of his neck.
“Keep that up and you might even earn yourself a cup.”
Bobby’s voice startled him, which was unsurprising given how many years it had been since the last time he heard it in person.
He’d known it was coming, had for a while now— Cas had sat him down a month or two ago to go through all the changes that would likely occur again now that he was losing his grace for good. Dean had found it a little ridiculous, at the time, as a) it’s not like this is their first rodeo with the whole ‘Cas falling’ thing, and b) he was just, well, turning human. And Dean was, unsurprisingly, very well versed in what it meant to be human, given
“You seemed really excited about trying out this diner, I didn’t want to stop you. I know we could have come tomorrow instead, but their opening week special ends today.”

I’m not entirely happy w this but I’m tired and almost didn’t write sooo,,,,,
Dean wasn’t expecting how much that fact breaks his heart.
“Is it weird that I sometimes feel like I haven’t done enough?”
“That does not make it your name,” Dean pointed out, and Castiel rewarded him with a high, tinkling laugh.
my brain blank today (like i did writing earlier in the day but none of it rly works as a daily drabble lol) soo have me projecting the stress of uni again lol
“Good. Castiel is a perfectly fine name, don’t get me wrong, but it’s a little long and…” Here Dean trailed off, not wanting to offend Cas this early into their acquaintanceship, but Cas just huffed out a quiet laugh.

“Oh god, don’t tell me those are actually your words.”
It starts like this: one day, an individual will start dreaming of someone they’ve never met as they drift off to sleep. The visions start off simple— an aspect of their soulmates physical appearance that is distinct, defining, instantly recognisable. Their nose. Their smile. Their (stunning and oh-so-blue) eyes.
remember when I didn't think this would be a proper verse? lmao.
yes this IS entirely bc of what jarpad said today I’m sorry to any fans of his but I dislike him intensely <3
“Have you considered just. Building yourself your own vessel.”
anyway I've been consuming so much fucking fluff as a procrastination tactic this week lmaooooooo
They sat in silence for a moment, before Dean seemed to physically shake himself out of the moment.
specifically.”
The first time Dean accidentally cut himself after everything, Cas instinctively found himself reaching to run his thumb over the back of his hand. And when the small line of blood stayed present on Dean’s finger, Cas couldn’t help the tension that entered his shoulders.
“Too early,” he decided. “Honeymoons are for sleeping-in.”
On the one hand, it was just a day. A significant day, yes, but realistically, it was just a signal that the Earth had completed one full rotation around the sun. Jack probably wasn’t gonna hit any significant development milestones today, unless you counted showing off his newfound walking skills to Sammy and Eileen.
like that for years to come. Just him alone, revelling in the small amount of peace this tradition afforded him. It probably
“Also, I find it very aesthetically pleasing. That’s why I started, really.”
When Castiel first started having the dreams, the primary emotion he felt was probably best labelled as confusion.
“Then I’ll have a honey latte, please. To go.”
dean cannot sleep sometimes because i could not sleep last night and projection
“I— Just not until we’ve worked out what’s happening? It’s not like he particularly enjoys research,” Cas pointed out, but Sam continued staring at him in disbelief.
“Not necessarily!! I don’t wanna risk it.”
me, starting 3 separate aus within the 3 days of being home? more likely than u think.
“I didn’t expect anything else.”
u can tell by some of this dialogue that I've had people talking abt assignments and passing units at me for the past week lmaoooooooooooo
one day I'll write a story centring around Australians and I just won't have to think about any of this ever. I'll use slang in all the dialogue and not spend 20 mins trying to work out what Americans call doonas and all of my non-australian readers will be confused as fuck but it'll be so nice.
But outside of that connection, part of him wondered if he’d chosen Dean because of how theoretically easy the transition would be for his family. They already called him ‘Dee’ half the time anyway, what was tacking one little ‘n’ sound on the end gonna hurt? And the simpler that transition was, the more likely that John would actually manage to stick to it, if he ever decided to actually make an effort to understand his son.
“That seems like it would be a good use of the strawberries, yes,” he replied, and Dean grinned.
yes i know technically magnus is not the high warlock at the point in time that this is set but shhhhhh we ignoring that, this is a mishmash of book and show canon remember
Dean loved his borther sammy more than ANYTHING (ew not like that u sickos) and I knew he wouldnt wannna put Sam in an weird position.
He still wasn’t thinking clearly, didn’t know if anyone
And he knew
depressing and the fic had a hopeful ending, but it just hit me strongly due to family stuff + chronic illness stuff).
the Empty in the first place, and there weren’t exactly ready-made portals they could step through that would conveniently give them the access they needed, as much as Dean wished there were. Things would be so much easier if there were.
, and now that they’d succeeded, that they had Cas back? Dean had absolutely no friggin idea what to do.
“The wedding is stressful because I want to make sure guests won’t spontaneously decide to unleash 10 years of ill will on each other while we’re standing at the altar,” he explained, watching Sam and Cas closely. “The honeymoon is just us, and I trust we’ll be able to handle any issues that crop up. The only thing I wanna avoid is going on a plane.”
Chap 219— dean might actually have a soulmate?????? 😲😲
“Nah, I know. I was more thinking about the healing properties of a kiss from an ex-angel.”
He felt like absolute shit every time Cas reached for him and his first instinct was to shy away from the touch, even though the angel seemed to understand. And even when he
... we could stay inside and make out for an hour?”
“No,” he admitted, and Cas pecked him again.
“Sam, we had the pie vs cake debate 2 weeks ago! He voted for pie initially, and the majority of our group agreed!! Literally the
somehow this is my first published soulmate au?? whack
, Dean reflected when all was said and done,
“No, that’s what this is about, isn’t it? The fact that I’ve been more concerned with saving Cas than going out and getting wasted or whatever the fuck else I usually spend my free time doing?”
“Oh, yes, because no-maj football makes
had an issue with it! I assumed you’d, well, tell me when you felt comfortable. And I’m glad you do now, although I wish it hadn’t taken so long.”
So, Dean thinks about it. He goes on another unsuccessful date and Angel Radio, this time with someone who seemed unengaged with him from the start, then matches with a guy named Benny. This time, when organising their first date, he asks Benny where he’d like to go, and they end up at a place that reminds him of the Roadhouse.
“If— If you’re comfortable with that.”
Cas raised an eyebrow.
“Technically, I guess so—”
He’d rebuilt it molecule by molecule once, after all.
Sometimes, Castiel wondered at the obsession with gender the humans he was surrounded by seemed to have.
, but they definitely stemmed from his belief that Dean would be happier without having him for a soulmate.
i mean, the time is

Which was part of why Dean knew Cas really, truly loved him. Because there was no way in

“I am... somewhat unused to having my wings visible on this plane.” He admitted. “Having them out, especially
“Would it be too forward of me to suggest that I know a way to make your week even better?” He asked, and Cas straightened up while raising a cool eyebrow.
They’d both spent so much time denying themselves the things they both obviously wanted that being freely allowed to indulge in their mutual affection for each other was taking some getting used to, and he wasn’t sure how best to remedy that fact.
im not very happy with it tho the dialogue wasn't cooperating.
Dean ran a hand through his hair.
prolly gonna cave and watch an ep of hannibal tonight/tomorrow,,,,, I'm honestly curious to know how many iconic lines from season 1 i Already Know from reading so many gd aus vfdshj
“That’s the problem, Sammy. What will you do if you ever lose her, like Dad did?”
And it is while he is in the middle of marrying him.
The ugly stepsisters cut off their toes to try and fit the glass slippers. The little mermaid never got her Prince Charming. And Dean is haunted by everything he’d been through and everything he’d had to do in order to survive as long as he had.
“I do. I love you too.”
“But I have to get out of bed for coffee, and I
Castiel blinked.
And, well, what else was Dean supposed to do with an order like that?
“Gabriel is just as likely to prank me the moment I enter the building as he is anything else,” Cas admitted, and Dean sent him a wry grin.
However, even with that, I ended up starting this soulmate au that I expect I will one day continue and post fully. I’ve added this to a series that I’ll post any stories that spawn from this into (I’ve already added little shadow) to go along with posting the link in the end an of specific chapters, because it means y’all don’t have to come back and check if I’ve finished them off and posted and can instead just sub to the series lol
Cas grinned, knowing he’d successfully distracted Dean again, but didn’t move his hands from their new position.
I really should write more for my soulmate dreams au, but the next scene I want to write is Dramatic and Angsty and I haven't been in the right vibe for that as of late. so continuing this one scene from the marks au it is xf,djz.afZk
“Can’t we go to someone about this? Tell them how he’s acting?”
” He asked, staring at it, and Cas grimaced.
condensed version of our convo
Eventually, something had to give. Cas knew that, had known it since he first acknowledged who Dean was to him, and every day more he spent avoiding the inevitable conversation made it more and more difficult to broach. But he’d have to, and soon— Sam had been sending him worried looks recently, as if he was gearing himself up to ask Cas what was wrong, and he’d found himself avoiding Dean, which was neither sustainable nor something he was enjoying.
“Hey, stranger.”
also today i spent way too long making a uquiz to assign people as the 5 ocs i made for a story i wrote when i was 12 that i still hold near and dear to my heart. plz take it i will love u forever u can find it
Would his relationship with the Winchester’s be different?
“I’m thinking I’ll stick with Castiel for now,” they replied. “Or, well, maybe just Cas. Castiel doesn’t feel
When we entered into this relationship, I did so fully aware of your history and the issues you still struggle with. Those issues were never going to disappear overnight. But I love you, as you love me, and nothing brings me greater joy than getting to be with you in this way, even on the hard days.”
Cas frowned.
“So you haven’t asked for help in the past because you didn’t want me to freak the fuck out and leave when I saw how soft and clingy you got as a result. That’s fair.”
from Cas, with all his other-worldly power, but another part feels that Cas would’ve made at least

Dean flushed, hand coming up to rub the back of his neck while a small smile rose to his face.
Dean groaned.
They were all awake enough by the time they Cas heard the tinkling that heralded the arrival of their first customer that he was almost unsurprised to see Meg’s posture change in a way that indicated she would be flirting with them (or encouraging
He thinks Sam knows, even if he’s had the courtesy to never mention it outright before. It’s obvious in the looks Sammy sends him sometimes, a silent encouragement and tease all in one.
this exists purely because i thought it would be funny as fuck if they ran into someone who knew jimmy while on their honeymoon. like seriously the panick™ they would feel
The second time Castiel came into the shop while Dean was working, he’d thought he was more prepared. He’d (barely) gotten through the rest of their first interaction without breaking any more mugs, which was definitely a plus, but he
“Oh, and Sam didn’t want to come along?”

“Now, Claire, you know perfectly well why that rule doesn’t apply to us teachers the same way it does to you guys. We’re generally on top of things enough to know when it is and isn’t okay to be checking our phones.”
Sam waved a hand dismissively.
, not by any stretch of the imagination, but he was as close to it as he’d ever been.
Cas smiled back, but hers was much more tight-lipped than Dean’s.
After a moment of tentative eye contact, Dean felt himself slumping again.

“We’re expected to conduct ourselves with propriety as well, don’t get me wrong, but it does seem like our families have different opinions on what that means. I hope that you find living here freeing, if nothing else.”
“They’re a brand of hand warmers.”
“I— uh— I got a call from the agency about half an hour ago.”
“Seriously, you’ve been worrying me, man. You can tell me if somethings going on.”
Dean sighed, undeniably fond.
“At least we wear safety gear!”
Dean had pinked and started to back away as the flood of words left his mouth, and Cas felt his cheeks darkening in response.
enemies to lovers cont (chaps 30, 60)— more pettiness, but some truths are being unintentionally signalled to each other
Sam couldn’t work out how to convince Dean into a break because he didn’t know
“There’s another couple of bags in Baby,” he admitted gruffly, and Cas’ pleased look grew.
a revelation was how deeply he’d found himself falling for the ridiculous man, even knowing that Cas would likely never care for him in the same way. How could he

“Wait— What are you talking about, Cas? Have you been having soulmate dreams?”
“I’m guessing these are our dimension travellers, then?”
“And then I accidentally told him how cute it is when he does that.”
He’d asked about it once, when Cas had painted them while sitting at the bench as Dean baked. He didn’t mean anything by the question, wasn’t passing a judgement on this new way Castiel had decided to express himself, so he was amused when Cas squinted curiously down at his half-finished nails for a few moments before glancing back up and shrugging in Dean’s direction.

“I... don’t really know if I have a soulmate yet, no.”
“Man, of
I know someone who went through a similar issue, about 10 years back. They swear on their life that you genuinely tried to help them, that you didn’t act like a typical fae.”
Cas cocked his head, the very picture of innocent confusion, but the glimmer in his eyes told Dean he knew exactly what he was doing.
“Yeah, don’t worry, man. I can understand your reasoning, just as I’m sure you understand mine. I’m just glad that everything’s out in the open now.”

The two of them, perhaps unsurprisingly, didn’t find themselves on dates that often.
His captors hadn’t noticed he was awake yet, luckily enough, but Dean had no idea how long his luck would last on that front. He was lucky to have woken up at all, because it wouldn’t be the first time an unwitting traveller had died in his sleep before being cooked into a meal by whichever creatures had gotten their hands on them.

at first, and probably wouldn’t have noticed if Cas hadn’t turned into a literal puddle in his arms as a result.
this chapter doesn't really have additions from the drabble fic excluding the ending bc i'd already written a lot for his perspective 💜
today’s drabble exists purely because I was like ‘how can I bring temporary dive into reddie back to destiel.... horror movies ig?’ side note I’m absolutely looking up crossovers later because my only other thought was somehow tfw have to deal w pennywise or the losers become hunters as mike does research and is like oh fuck there are More bad things out there??
The half-lie burned bitter on his tongue.

Castiel nodded seriously, noting their orders down on his phone, and Dean focused back in on his screen. They had a lot of work to get through, after all.
i was gonna wait till i'd seen more to write this idea as it involves jimmy and i wanted to see if he got like. an actual personality. but idk when that's gonna happen + it's not like I write from cas' perspective 90% of the time anyway even if the fic idea would suit it better in some ways.
Dean groaned.
so reminder. I’ve watched like 19 episodes of this show. none of them include castiel yet. fully basing this characterisation off fics I’ve read because its like,, my only point of reference for him lol. excuse the fact that this is probably horribly ooc
“Illiterate, or do you just not care?”
Dean’s not quite sure how they got here.
extravagant for the day, well aware that Cas didn’t want that, but no good birthday started without breakfast in bed.
Now Cas was wearing his ‘I’m confused about why you’re confused’ face, and Dean felt a little bad for putting it there.
Chap 156— dean would try to work out where they are but he's distracted by cas' general existence <3
“Should we… Go back down and tell her?” Cas asked, and Dean hummed.
Dean grimaced.
“Did you?” She responded, eyebrow raised, and he grinned.
Reminder that due to Life™ and having to wait for my mother to watch eps I’m still on like, season 4 of this show, but I love how chars like Charlie and Meg are portrayed in fic so I’m just. Using them and not worrying so much abt getting the characterisations perfect, as I know I don’t manage that for Dean and Cas anyway.

The fact that he asked you about them is… Out of character, to say the least.”

Sammy sighed and sent a tight smile in Cas’ direction, trying to convey that his frustration wasn’t with the other man.
“Yeah, if you guys have demons then there’s at least a

my brain is. very fried today. i spent a significant portion of the day doing/troubleshooting an entire assignment that was like. definitely designed to be done step by step as we learnt the relative skills lol. having chronic fatigue and being a chronic procrastinator really do not mesh well as even tho i cut shortcuts and shit and work fairly quickly i literally wanna collapse into bed now (I'm writing this a/n at 7:30 pm while i wait for my dinner to be finished in the oven, this probs wont get written and posted for another 2 hours due to my nighttime routine atm)
Maybe their eyes would’ve met, the way they always seemed to, and maybe Dean would’ve gotten over himself and leant in the way he always dreamed of. He didn’t have to wonder at how Cas would’ve responded anymore, at least, and that would’ve made it easier. It’s hard to worry about ruining a friendship when you
