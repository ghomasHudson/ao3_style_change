Steve couldn’t help but chuckles “thank you, Finn. This is really means a lot for me”
Once they arrive at their room, Tony put Steve down and Steve about to walk to the bed but Tony stops him by his collar.
Tony did listening him but he change the other tool and strapping the younger man and finally after like forever, he stopped. Tony again leaving Steve without giving him comfort and Steve bring his hands to rubbing his bottom. Steve can’t take it anymore, yes he accept for any punishment but this isn’t punishment, this is abusive. So he immediately grab his clothes before grab piece of paper and write something for Tony. After that he run from his house, didn’t care wherever he go as long as he didn’t have his shields anymore. Steve then decide took his motorcycle and leaving that places soon.
“Now, Steve. What I’m going to do when you decide to not listen to me” Tony asked him as he put his hand on his bottom.
Time passed, month changes. Six months later, since then, Tony didn’t hear any news about Steve.
“Okay, can I have safe words?”
Tony frowned again before he notice a red mark on his neck and his wrist
"Yeah, sweetie"
Tony didn't hear him, Steve's eyes are already watering like waterfall.
Sorry for disappointing you, I guess I can’t take it anymore. I can’t take my punishments anymore. You won, Tony. I won’t bothering you ever and I know that’s mean you won’t forgive me as well. Thank you for letting me know about you and guess our friendship is over. I’m sorry, Tony, for everything. I love you, Stark.
"Please" Steve finally begged when Tony landed third stroke with cane however he ignored him.
"No, Sam doesn't know about this and Natasha too. T'Challa said Steve doesn't want anybody to know where he goes" Bucky said.
"Steve?" Bucky knocked on the door "can I come in? There someone who want to meet you and wants to take you for vacation" He added.
Tony chuckles as he swats his bum “can’t wait to play with this bum of yours” he said as he walks to their room and Steve just giggles.
"Then, why don't you go find him? Go to Wakanda and ask the King, maybe he knows where he goes" Rhodey said.
Tony rolled his eyes and take his wrist before bringing strap into his bottom as they walking "ow, ow, sir, please" Steve begged and Tony ignored him once more and push him into the bench and forcing him to lay down on the bench.
"They were realized for what they had done, they rather on your side than me and I don't know why and Bucky, I don't know where he is now but from what I heard Fury has him after our battle"
“I don’t know how long it will going to be but as long as you can give anything that can make him trust you, believe me, he will trust you again” Bucky said and Tony just silent “take your time. Don’t worry, Steve has big heart and he has crush on you”
"Oh of course. Where do you want to meet?"
“Steve”
When the first subject is starting, Finn get in the class as well? I put my bag on my desk.
Back to Wakanda, where Tony visits the country, and T'Challa greets him and takes him into his room.
"I can walk and Sam will be here in minutes, go get him before something happens with him"
"Tony"
"Go sit down or"
"Yeah I think you right beside I need to do something today and tomorrow"
"What do you need, Rogers?" Tony ask him without looking at him.
“Thank you for doing this, Finn, I don’t know why even we only met one day, you already make me feel like safe and anything”
Once they collected the snacks and beverages what they want, they walked back to their seat as Bruce continues the movies.
“Because I didn’t listen to you and make myself like this”
"Tony, please. You can't do this, I love you"
“Hmm, let me to see” Tony said as he grabs the paper from him “hmm, interesting”
“Atta boy. Now why are you getting spanking?”
"Then forget about that, we forget our moments that we have, erase all of them because from now on I'm fucking hate you. Now, you better go before they drag you out of to the jail"
"If you decide to break the rules, there will be consequences" Tony said as he patted his bum "your bum will be paid anything from your behavior" he said "Jarvis, can you order me some stuff for him?"
After 3 years marriage and they seems happy together, Tony Stark and Steve Rogers decide to adopt kid which happening with young kid around 2 years old, Peter Parker, the cute and adorable boy from orphanage and he grew to become such attractive, sweets and smart and not only that he always tried to make both his parents to be happy with him until one day Steve pregnant and Tony seems happy and accept his second baby and soon the baby is born, every eyes getting into him and sudden little Peter forgotten. Every time, Peter tried to get them attention, they always push him around not even glance him for a second until Peter has grown by himself and find out he is Spiderman. At first, he doesn't know what he have to do with his strength at all since his jealousy and everything around him. He pushed to become Spiderman unlike his family who are bunch of superheroes. One day, He caught Tony and Steve play with their newborn baby and telling that one day the baby will be the person will change their lives. Wiping his tears away, Peter decide go away from them and living by his own. He thought if none of them care with him, then why should he have with his own live? Peter start to drunk and sometimes can use drugs not only that in school some people ignored him like he never exist which make him have pushed to use some drugs and not only that he also take some pills to get him distract and slice his wrist if it can make himself better. One day, Peter decide to back to Stark Tower only to find angry his father and when his father yelling him for being such ungrateful brat and slap him on the cheek that's when he start breakdown moreover until one day he meet with the only man, Finn Hudson, the guy from Ohio who decide to move into Manhattan after his graduated. What will happen the next with Peter? Can Finn help him before it's too late or maybe into the worse?
Tony? Why is here?
“Steve, I don’t know but I feel like your friends seems like looking after you right now” Finn said and Steve frowned “what do you mean?”
"Yeah, it's only for a while. Can you do that?"
"Yes, sir, whatever you want and whatever you feel like you can forgive me, go ahead, I'm ready"
“You what?” Bucky almost yells him “you punished him for something he didn’t do? For asking your forgiveness? I can’t believe this”
"Hush, I know you are sorry, baby. I forgive you but still we have another conversation about this situation" Tony said before he let Steve sit on his lap.
“You will spanking me as much as till I learned my lesson”
“Oh my god” the owner of the car “you okay?” He asks and frowning when he doesn’t respond “don’t worry, I’ll take you to my house now”
"Yeah, him"
My eyes widened at that words, Finn is my teacher? Wait what? Finn notice my surprised just wink at me and making me blushing.
Both Steve and Peter winces at the shouted because of his earing enchances and Tony notices Peter, he dragged the kid close and rubs his back
Steve looking at him before look at him and nodded, Tony leading him to inside his house and once they were inside,
Steve pouted as he rubs his bottom "but i'm curious, Tony"
Tony gasp once more “he what?”
“That’s why Steve seems distant to you and it will take some time to get him”
"Well, I gotta wait you here"
“I’m good, seriously who are you?”
I mouthed him ‘thank you’ as I accept the bottle and he gave me his smile before stretching himself.
“It’s okay, Finn. I’ve got you, let’s get you pack and we find your father” He said helping him to stand up and Finn following him behind.
"OH MY GOD" Natasha said "our fight must be giving a huge mess in the future!"
“Here is my number if you need my help, I promise, I’m trying to my best to help you” He said and giving me his number.
Tony looking at him once more before nod "if you say so, I want you now go to the corner and standing right there while I'm thinking about the punishment" He ordered and Steve nod before he get up and walking into the corner.
"Good, you can go to your room now"
"I know, Tony, I know, that's another reasons why I came here to you and why Fury has him, because he is in control Bucky and I don't know where I have to choose between you and Bucky. I was in hard position, Tony, so please forgive me or if you're not ready, you can do anything whatever you want to make you happy and trusting on me. Maybe you can give me another punch or maybe you can punish me"
“Okay” Steve said as he looked around.
"I’m bored” Steve suddenly said.
"Can I come with you? I promise, I'll be a good boy. I miss uncle Steve"
“Hey, Peter!” Finn call me making me turn around “yeah, sir?”
"Yeah, thank you"
I watched every single dad and mom walking around with their children, they were having fun yet I’m here just sitting by myself. I seriously don’t understand why dads doesn’t love me anymore. Was I’m not good enough? Was because I’m not like Harry? Suddenly,
"Hello?"
When Tony decide to find the Avengers, he meet with Bucky.
"Where are you?"
"How?"
“I’m sorry, I’m Finn Hudson and you are Steve Rogers? Am I right?”
"Hi," Steve said.
““Tony, when he was little, his father always whipped him no matter what he had done and not only that his father will slapped him and put him on the cupboard that full of rats! No wonder he scared of you because your actions really remind of him minus that rats!”
"Tony"
"Steve"
"Steve, come here" He ordering and Steve walk in front of him and standing in front of him.
"Oh, what the hell"
"Right away, sir"
As he about to leave, I call him “wait! What’s your name?” I ask and he shout “Finn. Finn Hudson! I’ll see you around”
Don't forget to leave a comments but please don't be rude! :)
"I have guest room to you use" Tony said before turn around and stopped when Steve catch his wrist "wait" and Tony about to looking at him when suddenly Steve decide kneeling in front of him.
Steve looking at his eyes once more as suddenly Finn’s phone beeping and frowning once more before he decide to pick it up,
Tony couldn’t help but wince at the image Steve’s father whip him on the back with his old belt and Bucky seems like read his mind.
"I'm sorry, Tony" Steve said as he dropping his shield and brought Bucky out of the base and leaving him alone.
“No, no. I’m agree though and I’m excited honestly” Steve said looked down.
“Well, look at this” Finn said as he showing his phone screen.
“Can we talk?” He ask me and I just nod before take a seat in front of him.
“Finn, what are you doing here?” Steve ask when he saw the younger man in the living room alone.
Steve blushes when Tony decide to spread his legs “now go write”
"So, this is his room before he left?" Tony asks Bucky, and he is nodding "he doesn't tell you where he goes?"
No response, Bucky and Tony looked at each other until Tony's feet are touching something. Frowned, he grabs the paper.
He threw the duffle over his shoulder as they began to walk away from everyone, eager to be alone and away from the eyes of others. As they walked, Bucky said, “I can’t believe you ended the contract you had with the hospital, Tony.”
I'm so sorry for the delay in posting. A lot happened in the past few weeks. A hurricane caused flooding and power outages to the area I live in. Nothing was damaged thankfully, but it was a pain nonetheless. My ex decided to make my life a living hell during one of his manic episodes, so I left the state for the first vacation I've had in ten years. A week in Florida was just what I needed to help shake off the funk of the last month.
Bucky almost whimpered as he kissed him, squirming beneath him, and Tony could feel him trying to rub himself against his leg. Tony deepened the kiss, sucking on Bucky’s tongue as his other hand moved down Steve’s chest and across his stomach. Tony claimed Bucky’s mouth as he finally wrapped his hand around Steve, causing the man to buck up into his fist, groaning.
Bucky’s eyes went wide and darkened. Tony could practically see the images his mind was producing.
“You will tell me if you are not comfortable or want me to stop.” He told him.
They fought side by side as they brutally made their way through the guards and into the factory. Tony used his new gun and began firing at the men in front of him. They fell before his feet as his shots found their mark. You didn’t design weapons for most of your life without knowing how to use them.
Steve nodded. “I miss him too.”
“I ask myself that every time you open your mouth.” Bucky told him as he shut his eyes, not threatened by the archer’s anger in the slightest.
“The drop,” Tony said. “What goes up must come down. Those chemicals we talked about will be used up, and the crash can be pretty hard for some people. You’ll be exhausted. Speaking can be difficult, and you could become uncoordinated.” He turned to look at Steve. “It will be the top’s job to care for him, make sure he feels safe and loved. Keep him warm and comfortable.”
“I told you already, Doc.” Tony said tiredly. “I can’t be there building machines and things for this project. My name needs to stay out of this. I can be a consultant or a technician in the background. There’s only one Stark that needs credit for this.”
Bucky just kind of shrugged and muttered, “Different.” He hadn’t really met any of their eyes since they’d come into the kitchen. That was alright, Steve thought; he’d get their at his own pace.
Tony gasped and clutched his hand to his chest. “How could you? You’re supposed to be on my side!”
“What are you talkin’ about?” Bucky asked. His straight face lasted a few more seconds before he burst out laughing. Steve soon joined in.
“Excuse me?” Sam asked in disbelief.
“I spoke to Lucille, Tony. I asked about the guys who ended up in the hospital while she was workin’. She said they sounded drunk or crazy, talkin’ about a shadow that moved too fast for them to see. Tellin’ them to make better life choices or leave Brooklyn.” He huffed out an almost laugh. “Or my personal favorite, quoting the bible to them as he beat the shit out of them. The book of Ezekiel, Tony? I had no idea you’d even read the bible.”
His voice was so small, scared and unsure. Steve knew what it must be costing Bucky to ask for these things so he didn’t make a big deal out of any of it. He wanted Bucky to know that he could tell Steve what he needed, like he always had.
“Tony, move faster,” Steve gritted out as he panted and opened his eyes. Tony looked like he was in…well the word bliss came to mind until Steve saw the small smirk.
“Excuse me,” Tony stopped a man walking past him, “Could you tell me the time? My watch seems to have stopped.” His watch hadn’t stopped. Tony had made it himself so he would have a portable gauntlet, and Tony’s tech didn’t breakdown. It still didn’t mean the watch was showing the accurate time. He’d arrived at the sanctum at nine o’clock, but the sun in the sky suggested it was much later.
“Please!” Steve groaned wantonly, “Please, touch me! Tony, I…” They both moaned loudly at the harder thrust Tony made as he picked up his pace.
“You’ll make sure I’m safe, Tony?” He’d asked as he looked up with those big blue eyes. It was a testament to how scared Steve must have been. Tony had promised to keep him safe.
James shrugs.
“I bet he loved that,” Clint grinned, but his words were good natured. “The good people of Brooklyn singing his praises. Tony Stark, the miracle man.”
“At least, you can admit it. That’s growth,” Bucky said dryly before continuing. “And Tony’s helped you see that. Think about it, Stevie. Everything Tony did after that conversation was an attempt to prove you wrong and show you that he was more than you’d thought. Almost dying to save everyone, rebuilding this tower for the team, helping me, it was all to prove to himself and you that he could be more than that.”
he is. We don’t really know, do we?”
“Ottimo! Grazie!” He turned to look at Bucky and Steve. “Ah, these are the friends you spoke of, yes?”
“Excellent! Now I won’t look like an old man with epilepsy next time I go out.”
Tony began moving as he took his first step toward the bedroom. “Steve,” he called, and when the younger man turned to face him, Tony cupped his hands around those delicate cheekbones and jaw to bring him in for a kiss.
“There are a couple that are similar.” Tony nodded, “There is definitely one that I want you to try since you love spaghetti so much.” They both perked up at this as Gianetta returned with their plates and wine. She opened the bottle and gently poured it into a decanter. “I’ll be back soon with your caponata.”
“Buy a paper, Mister?” The young boy asked him as Tony tried not to have a panic attack out here on the street.
Tony felt his fingers trace over his largest scar, the surgical one that ran down his torso.
“I wasn’t any better.” He admitted. “I called him a big man in suit of armor, told him he wasn’t worth the things he prided himself over, that he didn’t care about anything but himself. I told him he wasn’t a hero, all because I’d read a file and made an assumption based on someone else’s words.”
Her stare never wavered. “Then, he told me that my rent was now lower since the apartment was being occupied by one person instead of two. I don’t think I’d ever heard that stipulation before when renting.”
Steve smiled, weak but genuine. “I don’t know about right, but I do know better than to argue with him. I think he’s even more stubborn than I am.”
Erskine chuckled as he motioned for them to start walking. “Sadly, yes. I do believe that.”
Tony shook his head, not even bothering to lie since the man could easily find that out.
“Well, we’re safe now,” Bucky said, “so that’s what matters.”
“But why?” Erskine asked with true fascination. “Why be a simple repairman? With your intellect and knowledge, you could do anything, become anything. The world could be yours once again.”
Steve frowned slightly because she didn’t appear to even notice Tony’s presence at his side. “We were hoping to ask someone if they knew the status or location of the 107th’s last position. A friend of ours is assigned with the unit, and we hadn’t heard anything in a long time.”
Tony chuckled at that. “Well, no offense, Buck, but that makes me feel a tiny bit better. It would make this whole thing even more awkward, and it’s plenty awkward enough.”
, had come home around six looking dead tired. He perked up as he breathed deeply. The smell of the spaghetti filled the apartment. Steve had also taken the bread they’d baked earlier and slathered it with butter and minced garlic before toasting it.
Bucky could understand, at least in part. Steve took a deep breath and continued. “Now, I have you back. I really have you back, but Tony’s in trouble. Tony, who would also understand what it feels like to be trapped in a world that’s so foreign from what you know. Tony, who I now love as much as I love you. Tony, who I am failing because I can’t help him.”
“Why is his name Sutton?” Natasha asked.
Bucky opened his eyes to see warm brown ones filled with love staring back before he was gently pulled forward in a kiss. Behind him, Steve stood and grabbed towels. They all got out and dried as best they could as they kissed and rubbed against each other, slowly making their way to the bed.
Tony shrugged. “Good enough, I guess. It keeps me fed.”
Bucky watched as every screen and holo-bank in the room filled with pictures, footage, and documents. He couldn’t do this. He wanted to find Tony, but he didn’t want to know what he hadn’t already remembered. He didn’t want some half-assed explanation that was recorded down decades ago spoiling what they would soon be going through in his memories.
Tony already couldn’t wait for Bucky’s next letter.
Tony struggled to remain respectful as he stood up for himself against the grumpy colonel. “I missed your smiling face?”
“Exactly, people finally have money to invest, and it’s your job to show them they should invest in war bonds. Do you know anyone who is
When he was alone, however, or the news on the radio would be particularly dour about America’s first movements of the war in northern Africa, he would stick to his promise and ask his boys to hold him. There were several nights of them just cuddled together on the couch until his panic eased, and the pressure that had been mounting became bearable to live with.
his fault.
At that thought Tony remembered how alone and truly fucked he was.
Tony moaned again with his tongue still in Steve when Bucky pressed harder against his taint. It was almost too much and not nearly enough at the same time.
Bucky huffed, “Fine, I get it. I’ll be right back.”
“Well, there must be some misunderstanding because I am neither of those things.” Tony said easily.
Erskine’s eyes shone behind his glasses as he smiled. “Aren’t you taking a risk telling me this? What if I choose wrong now?”
They both continued to stare until Steve spoke this time.
Steve smiled at his best friend. “I’d like either of you doin’ it. You know how much I love your mouth, Buck.” He breathed in again. “But I was wondering what it’d be like to have Tony do more of those things to me. You know, hold me down and make me feel good.”
“Boys,” he stopped their questioning and just hugged them close. “It’s alright. I just had a friendly chat Mr. Byrne.”
Silence was the only answer Bucky could hear since he couldn’t take his eyes off Steve as the blonde turned back to him. “I know this is hard for you, love. You’ve had to remember so much in a short amount of time, and it’s got to be confusing after how you’ve been feeling these past months. Two very different parts of you are having to coexist together, but I promise you that I will be here for you. I promise you that I love you no matter what you’ve done or any mistakes you think you’ll make. I’m not ashamed of you, and we will get through this.”
He’d returned to their empty apartment and begun packing what was important, the truly priceless things that would most likely be thrown away by someone else. Steve’s art and sketches, their photos, letters and keepsakes from Steve and Bucky’s mothers were all packed away with loving care. Tony then went to visit Ruth. He’d handed her a notarized letter that stated the remaining contents of the apartment belonged to her. All of Tony’s appliances were for her. She was free to sell or donate whatever she chose.
**Avenger’s Tower**
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony probably shouldn’t have been surprised, but he was. He was a stranger, and they were just inviting him into their home? But this was Steve Rogers and James Barnes, they wouldn’t turn their backs on someone who needed help. Especially someone who they felt they owed something to.
Dugan handed him a canteen. “Drink up, Captain. Everyone else just had their allotment, and you need yours too.”
Steve’s jaw dropped at those last sentences, and Tony couldn’t blame him for his shock. That was beyond rude and degrading, especially since everyone else in the room had stood witness to it. Without answering Steve turned and tried to make his way off the stage.
“Really. In fact, if you really wanted to screw with him, you could just ignore him. None of this ‘yes, sir’ and ‘I’m sorry’ crap. He says something, and you just barely nod or shake your head. If he can’t speak civilly to you, then don’t speak to him at all.”
Steve didn’t, nor did he want to, know what had happened between the two men. For the first couple of weeks after Rebirth when Steve had begun to tour with group, the man would make comments about Tony’s presence there. He would make remarks about Steve hiring his own assistant. One day after making several of those increasingly rude comments, Steve had watched Tony follow the man into the room he was using as his office for that particular show.
“Well, now your friends here do, too,” Bucky said easily.
Tony turned back to Bucky, and he felt his heart start to beat faster. Why was this still so difficult? Why couldn’t he just ask what he wanted to know without it making him want to punch something in frustration and shame?
Tony tongued at the head, tasting pre-come while he worked into and around the slit as Bucky moaned. As Tony gently sucked and relaxed his jaw, and Bucky pushed farther into his mouth, Steve came around to settle between Tony’s legs.
Bucky then crawled onto the bed and settled between Tony’s legs. His eyes were darkened as he looked up Tony’s body to return his gaze.
Tony placed the bottle on the table as he took his seat and watched as a soft blush spread on Steve’s cheeks. Right. Not his business. He’d probably walked in on a private conversation. Here he was getting between the two of them again.
Dernier whistled and muttered in French. Gabe nodded and replied in the same language.
Tony swallowed his mouthful of pasta. “Not much. Helped Steve around the house. Didn’t disfigure my face with a straight razor. Learned how to not burn spaghetti sauce.”
Bucky closed his eyes, and the look of shame on his face broke Tony’s heart. “I’m so sorry.” He whispered brokenly in Tony’s hands. “I can’t believe I said that. What’s wrong with me? How could I like something like, something like
“Of course I’ve heard of him.” Tony admitted. Pretending otherwise would have been beyond foolish with the smart man questioning him. “It’s kind of hard to have not heard of him. He’s rich, famous and brilliant. Not to mention we share the same last name.”
Tony took a steadying breath. “Thank you, both of you, but what’s the occasion?”  He looked up worried. “Is it a birthday? Did I forget a birthday?”
“That’s right. It’s a bit different here, and I’ve never been very good at making new friends. Wouldn’t even know where to start.” Tony knew that he probably seemed like hermit, only leaving the apartment when he had to, but the less he interacted with people, the less chance he had of doing something inappropriate. He didn’t want to draw too much attention to himself.
“No way! One of the Commandos was in the circus? How did not know this?” The archer seemed genuinely fascinated. “Was he any good?”
“But ya see,” Bucky continued, “what no one gets is that
Steve’s fingers stopped their movement as he looked down to find Bucky’s face. “He would,” Steve said slowly, “but so would you, Buck. You were my fella too.”
by Sun Tzu along with some of the more popular works by poets like Emily Dickinson, Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, and Henry Wordsworth Longfellow. The first book was to prepare their minds, the rest were to replenish their souls.
“That part actually sounds really nice.” Bucky admitted quietly. No thinking, no worrying, just feeling. “Could I really do that?”
“You here that?”
“Really, Buck? That’s how you say it?” He asked disapprovingly because for some reason one of the only things that had transferred to this Bucky was that he didn’t like disappointing Steve. He wasn’t even sure if Bucky knew why that was. “He’s totally fucked, and we’re lucky there’s no corpse?”
Bucky lay silent and still next to Tony’s sleeping body and thought about the past few hours.
Steve pulled back from the kiss, and Tony tried to catch his breath before Steve pushed him down against the mattress. He turned to whisper something to Bucky as Tony panted watching them, wondering what would happen next. He kind of loved that he didn’t know. He was at Steve’s mercy in this.
As Tony inched his way toward Greenwich Village to visit Strange, the sudden blasting of Crazy Train from Tony’s phone let him know Pepper was calling. She had not been amused by her personalized ringtone, but he refused to change it.
“You could.” James said, soft and sincere. “You seem like the kind of guy who takes life and makes it the way he wants it. I know we haven’t known you long, Tony, but it’s plain to see that you don’t let difficulties hold you back. You said you fix things, yeah?”
Bucky smiled at the new bottle of cologne and hair pomade, both his favorite brands, along with the new hat Tony had gotten him because that man looked damn fine wearing one. Tony also got him a new lunch pail and work boots for “when you get your new job” Tony told him because he wanted Bucky to know that he had faith in him.
Steve circled a lubed up finger around his hole. Tony didn’t know or care where he’d gotten the Vaseline. All he knew was that he was about to be filled by both his boys.
An hour or so later, the bedroom door opened, and he watched as the two came into the living room only to freeze in surprise at the sight of the decorations and tree.
Bucky could see Dum shrug his shoulders. “I was born with six toes on my left foot. It’s gone now, though. My ma tied a string around it until it fell off.”
Tony watched Steve closely as his breathing settled and grew worried at the wheeze he could hear in the younger man’s lungs, but Steve just got up and made his way over to the dresser. That’s when Tony noticed there was a pitcher and two glasses resting on top of it. Steve grabbed them and brought them over.
“We’ve just never had to worry about somethin’ like that,” Steve continued for him, “and I know we only know pieces of your past, but I can understand why you’d learn to react to threats that way. We also know that you would never do anything to hurt us or risk what we have here.”
“It’s the eyes,” Tony told him seriously. “No one can say no to Steve’s puppy dog eyes. I think it’s one of those superpowers he has now.”
“I promise, Tony.” Steve assured him. “You know I will.”
Bucky’s voice broke as his eyes watered. “It’s not a crime to want the pain to stop. I can’t believe that, not for you or me. We’ve been through so much, Stevie, but we’re still here. Somehow, we both made it through everything to get here, and I need you to…” Bucky panted as his own tears fell, “I need you to promise me that you’ll remember that. Not wanting to live is not the same as killing yourself. Everyone reaches the point where they’ve had enough, but that doesn’t mean you should give up, Steve. You never have, and despite whatever you think of yourself, you never will. So don’t give up on Tony. Yes, he needs us, and we need him, but I have to believe that he is strong enough to keep going, keep trying. I have to believe that, and so do you. So stop taking the blame for the entire world and remember that even if it ends tomorrow, you are just one man who is allowed to be human.”
Just to rub it in a little more, Tony continued. “I mean, I’m pretty sure that should work. Right, Mr. Stark?” Tony’s voice was guileless, the perfect combination of uncertain and respectful. He almost felt bad for Howard. Almost. Tony could see how easy it would be to outmaneuver the man. Tony was forty-two and Howard was in his early twenties. He had nothing on Tony’s experience with these matters, both scientifically and socially.
Tony stopped and looked back at him. His face was cold, and his voice was colder. “You’re the genius, and this is your project, so
. I know we’re not normal, but I have to be,” he gasped, “have to be seriously fucked up to be like this. How can you wanna touch me after that?”
And Steve let out a long groan that signaled his release. It was soon followed by Bucky’s harsh grunt as he must have come while trying to swallow Steve’s.
“I’m Tony, by the way.” Feeling slightly silly he held his hand out.
Dum Dum shrugged. “Cuz I can only get a decent bit of shut-eye when you’re on watch,” he answered in the blunt way of his.
“Tony!” He jumped. Had Steve been talking to him?
He and Steve were doing as well as ever, and Bucky’s letters gave them both something to look forward to as they also helped mark the passage of time; however, there had been a new tone to the most recent ones in the past month and a half. Bucky seemed determined to do well in everything he did, and Tony wondered what had caused this change in him. He hoped that it wasn’t anything serious, and that Bucky just wanted to go into his advanced individual training with the most to offer.
Steve lied to himself and pretended it was just the water from the shower running down his face and not tears from being so overwhelmed that he felt fractured inside. It was a familiar lie since it happened almost every night. In this shower on his private floor, he didn’t have to be Captain Steve Rogers. He could just be the small, weak little guy from Brooklyn he’d been for most of his life, and no one would know. So he let the water run until it was only water on his face.
Tony burst out laughing. “Oh my god, you sound like Bucky when he’s drunk!”
With another huff of breath, the blonde countered, “I could do this all day.”
“That was supposed to be a surprise,” Tony muttered, thinking of the nearly finished washing machine he was keeping in the basement, and earned two smiles.
It wasn’t even because Bucky was angry at the deception. They had figured out early on that Tony couldn’t or wouldn’t do a certain amount of emotional vulnerability. Just as he wouldn’t bring up his past unless he was directly asked by one of them. Even then Bucky and Steve knew it was carefully spoken, each word deliberately chosen. When Tony had given his heart to them, the emotional walls had come down, and he was open with them. His thoughts, however, were sometimes still a mystery.
“Of course, Tony,” Abrams eyes shifted to his plaster-covered body, and Tony had to make himself not focus on how much every part of him was beginning to itch under his casts and bandages. He was fairly certain he had stitches in some places. He chose to focus instead on the doctor in front of him. “However, there was massive amounts of damage to your body. You appeared to have broken and shattered bones, damage to your spine, internal bleeding, cranial fractures…We were at a loss as to how you had survived.”
Tony remembered a few days ago when Steve had approached him after Erskine had told him about the project and asked if he knew about the procedure. When Tony confessed that he did, the blonde had sagged in relief.
“You are both angry, and it isn’t at each other. Stress does this to people, even people who love each other, and
Bucky sniffed. “I think I remember the rocket ships. We colored the cardboard blue, and the streamers were silver, right?”
Bucky threw his arms around Tony and kissed him breathless. His tongue practically danced with Tony’s. “Thank you,” he said wetly as they pulled apart. “Thank you for being patient and telling me to wait and find something I’d like. I’d probably be luggin’ boxes somewhere and hating every minute of it. I’ve never had a job I was excited about.”
He sighed as he squeezed Steve’s hip with his remaining hand. “I really would, beautiful, but I’ve got a dozen things to take care of today.” He said remembering his full work schedule.
(See the end of the chapter for
It turns out that nanotechnology wasn’t easy to transfer and manipulate with basic tools from the 1940s. He couldn’t rely on the watch itself because it had been glitchy ever since he’d been hit by that delivery truck. Go figure. His glasses could diagnose the problems, but they couldn’t repair the damage. Now, it was just a fancy looking wrist piece with a cracked glass face. At least his glasses had miraculously survived.
Steve’s eyes narrowed. “You’re askin’ for it, Barnes.”
Tony was in the process of removing his coat when he noticed them staring and paused.
It nodded. “Alright.”
Their words were hard to focus on and almost impossible to answer. Fuck, that was some shit to remember.
They just kept thanking him, not really believing that he would have gone through all this trouble over them. It made Tony’s heart swell at their happiness, but ache at the same time to think of how little kindness their lives had given them if a few modest gifts meant so much.
“Good night, baby.” Tony moved one of his arms behind him and found Bucky’s hand. He linked their fingers together gently before he closed his eyes. Tonight had been a night of wonderful surprises. As he drifted off, he couldn’t help but wonder what other surprises the future had in store for them.
“Steve?” He called out as he started shucking off his work boots. “Please tell me you started cooking. I’m starvin’.”
“Brigadier, huh? I heard you guys were tough bastards, but I think you’re crazy jumpin’ from planes.” he said as he looked around through the bars to the other cages, but Bucky didn’t see any other uniforms that matched with the British Major’s. “Are your men here, too?”
Bucky looked to Steve, hoping he would be the one to answer. All of this talking and sharing was still new to him, and he was beginning to feel drained by it. He’d gone seventy years where having an opinion of any kind wasn’t permitted. Hell, thanks to that fucking chair it wasn’t even possible, and although he knew he was now allowed to voice his thoughts without punishment, it was still hard to override the instinct that told him to keep silent and wait for orders.
“Several when you arrived. There was damage to your entire body. We’ve retaken different images over the course of the past four days.” Abrams hesitated then said, “Each new image seems to contradict the previous one. From organ damage to bone regrowth to tissue repair, it’s as if the x-rays came from different people or were done weeks apart. Nothing about your injuries or recovery can be explained.”
“Nope,” he interrupted. “Not hearing it. Up, up. Time to show me those moves.”
Steve moaned as Tony began licking broader stripes across his opening. “Fuucckk, so good.” He said as pushed back against Tony’s mouth.
The rest of the future Commandos were also staying here with Steve’s permission, but they were currently getting food at the mess tent. Dugan had promised to bring something back for Tony and Bucky since the others agreed that their Sergeant should be resting.
Jacobson was riding up front with the driver. The man had looked livid when he’d seen Tony board the ship to bring them here. Before he could say anything, however, Tony had just turned his head and stared the man down. His face had been cold, as if daring the man to speak and promising that he wouldn’t like the consequences of it. Jacobson had just turned and walked away.
Steve’s eyes were filled with emotion at the newly formed memory Bucky shared, but he still chuckled softly. “Go figure that the first thing he told me to learn to make was spaghetti. It’s his favorite food, and obviously required more than tomatoes, salt and pepper which I learned the hard way. Once we’d started living together when we were older, I’d began to wonder if Bucky hadn’t been trying to teach me how to take care of him.”
Bucky huffed wetly. “Well then, I still might give him hell for making me wait so long.”
So Tony tried. Within a few days, he was able to cover his emotions and fake that he was better. He would listen to the news with them without having another breakdown. He would go to work and talk with people before coming home to help Steve in the kitchen. He would let Bucky pull him up from the couch to dance with him in front of the radio in their living room. When the song was over, Tony had to make himself let go of Bucky.
filled the room. Tony wasn’t too familiar with the steps for this music, but he was a quick study, and Louise was a good dancer. They managed to make it through the first song without incident and followed it up with a plucky attempt at Fats Waller’s slightly goofy
Tony was doing well after the accident, better than that even. His aches and pains hadn’t lasted more than a couple of days after he returned home, and his bruises were nearly all gone. Only evidence of the worst ones remained, and they were the almost healed color of greenish-yellow, quickly fading to nothing. Tony found it almost funny that his bones could mend themselves in four days, but the bruises took nearly two weeks to recover from. Maybe because they weren’t all that threatening? He didn’t know, and with Bucky’s arrival so close at the moment, he didn’t care.
They were all in Bruce’s lab, but Bucky didn’t want to be here anymore. He’d done what he’d set out to do. He’d told Bruce and the others everything he could now remember about Tony’s healing and unchanging body. Steve had helped with some of the details, and they’d also shared all of the events they’d remembered to that point, the things they knew or guessed that Tony had changed in some way, including Bucky’s rescue from that HYDRA prison.
I made you feel good and safe and cared for. Just like I wanted to do.”
Tony could only grunt and choke in response.
“The thing I’m most upset over is that the two of you had to worry even more for nothing.” Tony told them as they stood away from the bus station and waited for a cab to hail. “I never wanted you to worry over me, especially not like that.”
Finally the other man said, “I believe I can do something for you, but first, you must answer one question.”
Tony stayed in bed for three days after that before Steve and Bucky grudgingly let him get back to work. It had been a long three days.
Bucky accepted that. This was what war was.
“Okay, the easy part’s over,” Tony said. “Good job, Steve.”
Tony shrugged. “I pissed off the wrong interdimensional deity and was sent here over two years ago. I’m trapped. I’ve already asked the people at magic central, most likely the same people you met, and it can’t be undone. I went from the one of the richest and most powerful people on the planet to a friendly neighborhood repairman stranded decades in his past.”
He had to see his sweetheart in the comfort of their home. He needed to make sure they went out the night of the Expo, and he had to make sure that Steve went to the enlistment office instead of wanting to come home early because he was worried over Tony. Everything was coming to a head, and Tony couldn’t let all of his careful planning go wrong because of this.
Bucky huffed next to him, his warm breath heating the skin it blew across. “No, I meant do
Bucky flashed to the moment he tried to take Tony’s shirt off. The harsh snap of Tony’s voice had shocked him so deeply it almost hurt. Tony had never spoken like that to them before, but once Tony apologized and explained why, Bucky’s heart melted a little.
Bucky turned to look at Steve now. “As glad as I am that you came to look for me, Steve, I can’t believe you brought Tony. You know how he is about war zones.”
“I wonder if I’ll be fightin’ Krauts or Japs.” Bucky said, looking at nothing in particular.
Bucky’s POV
“Get back? Where are you?”
I'm sorry for the wait my friends. I won't say anything more than one of the people I love the most tried to end their life. I was the one who rode with them in the ambulance. I waited all day in the emergency room until the doctors were sure they were stable for transfer. I watched as they were loaded into another ambulance to be taken to a facility. They suffer from PTSD and the anxiety and depression that are a result of it. It was one of the worst days of my life, and I was devastated. I only tell you this because I urge anyone who is suffering to please get help. Talk to someone. If you don't have anyone, talk to me. My contact info is in my profile. I hope you can appreciate why I needed to step away and take a break, especially with some of the themes in this story and where I had planned for this chapter to end before everything happened. I hope everyone and those they love are well during these scary times, and maybe this new chapter will distract you for a little while. I love you all.
Like Steve, Bucky’s dick was uncut and already half hard. He could tell it would get even thicker once he was fully aroused. Tony’s mouth watered, but he just leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Bucky’s hipbone before looking up.
It was a woman, a beautiful woman. She was bending forward towards the viewer. Her dress was half unbuttoned, and her large chest was all but falling out the top. Her hands were cupping each side of her breasts and pushing them together, nice and tight. On the edge of the picture was very clearly a man from the waist down. His pants were open. A long, hard cock held tightly in his fist.
“Well, yeah,” he answered as he picked up the tools he’d used. “It wasn’t much. Just needed to replace a few wires, tighten a couple of tubes, install a new coil. Those kinds of things.”
As he pulled on a pair of sleep pants, he looked down at his bare torso. All of his old scars still stood out against his skin, though the worst of them from his surgery had finally dulled a bit in color. He looked at the space on his stomach where one was almost entirely gone. The very faintest trace of a white line could be seen from where Joe Collins knife had sliced him open. Then Tony looked at the inside of his left arm. A year ago he’d gotten a nasty burn from an overheated engine. He’d actually had to go to the hospital for that one; it had been too bad to even try to treat it himself. He looked at the almost invisible mark. The only proof that it ever happened.
“Where is he?” Tony asks him
Thank you for your kudos! And i'm sorry taking this too long and I hope you enjoy with this! And I'm sorry if there are many grammatical error :(
"Well, he asked this. He chooses you than me" Tony reasoned.
"Steve, put em down or there will be consequences" Steve huffed but did
Steve pouted but did and continue to write on the note and not long, Steve done.
After another 50 strokes, Tony stopped and put both paddle and cane back to the original places. He looking at Steve's bottom that now is dark purple "I know you healing fast so I want you tomorrow after I dropping Peter, you have to stay here or else, understand?"
“Exactly. Do you know what I have to explain to the others when they find out about you”
"Yes, sir" Steve said.
Zemo smirks at him and Steve frowned at this sign and suddenly feeling uneasy on his stomach.
"Fri, tell me if he wake up" He said to his computer "will do sir"
“Steve?”
Tony shrugged "I don't think so and I called him almost ten times, but no response from him" Tony frowned "I don't know what should I do, the other feels I really hate him but your right I still care about him"
“Hello? Yeah, I’m Finn Hudson”
“Just because he asked you doesn’t mean you have to do that for a week and you know what? I’m glad he decide to run away from you!” Bucky shook his head “I can’t believe with you, Stark. I wonder how Peter feel when he know this”
“Well, he asked me!”
"You sure you want leave him there alone?" Bucky ask him and Steve shrugged "go get him now"
“Hmm, let me see, what I can do” Tony said.
"Steve?"
Tony raised his eyebrow "no, he never came here. Does Sam know?"
Tony didn't say anything as he lets Bucky keep continues.
Steve frowned again and cried "sorry! I didn't know that!"
Meanwhile,
"Yeah, punish me, I'll take whatever punishment you want. If you wants to slap me as much as you want, go ahead or maybe you want to kick me harder than our battles, go ahead, I'm ready to take it but please forgive me and back to the team"
Ignoring the pain on his legs,
Peter looked at Sam who comforting Bucky and Tony who been curious at Steve as Shuri nudge him to continue the movie and Peter just did, while the four people in their business, the rest of them in sadness.
Steve looking at his phone ‘Captain America missing’ and another things ‘Captain America missing, Iron Man broken hearted’
"You mean, I'm going get daily and bedtime spanking for a week?" Steve ask him and Tony nodded "but that's too much, I haven't been spanked for a while" his voice getting hoarse "and I-"
"Is he with you?" Bucky asks him.
"YOU DON'T DESERVE FOR THAT SHIELD" Tony yells at him the moment he steps out of the base.
Tony then helped Steve to lay down on his laps and he already hold the pen as the note in front of him.
"Okay, let's get over with" He said take his wrist and leading him into the punishment room.
Bucky chuckles "yeah he did"
"I can't take my promise, Buck. But again this the future of us, so we may have a second chance to stops it" Steve said rubs his back.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve sighed.
"So, he's not with you?"
"Why Sam, Clint and Wanda needs me when they were on your side? And where is Bucky?"
When Bucky saw him, Steve just walked away and Sam goes helping him. The trip to bring Bucky to Wakanda is so silence, only Steve's sniffles that can be heard. When they arrive to Wakanda, Steve goes to find T'Challa
“For a month?!” Steve asked even his erection feel otherwise.
“Hmm, okay”
T'Challa just nodded and with that, Steve is leaving Wakanda that day. Steve keeps running out of the country, ignoring the hunger. All he was doing just keep running until someone put something on his drink.
"Looks like someone is awake" a familiar voice made him turn into the voice "Zemo, what are you doing"
"Watch your language, young man. Also what did I say to not touch anything"
"T'Challa told me that he was leaving Wakanda a few weeks ago and he asked the King for not telling him where and I thought he was with you" Bucky explained.
"I can't do this anymore, not with you" Tony said ignoring whatever Steve's talk.
“TONY!” Steve tried to protect himself but Tony caught his wrist.
“Yes, I would like to do that spanking roleplay with you. As long as with you since you are my boyfriend so yeah, I would love to”
“W-what do you me-an?”
"Well, if you say so, Tony. But remember no matter what, I still love you and will do anything for you, even I have to gives my soul for you"
Tony keeps spanking his boyfriend as he frowns as he realizes something. Now Steve is a teenager and a lot younger than him and that means Steve becomes his responsibility and his job as the leader of Avenger will become a problem. Steve cried as Tony paused.
"Of course, I will give this to him and I'm sure he will like it. Well, I have to leave. I'll see you later"
"Uncle Steve?"
“Don’t worry, whenever team around, we can stay on the penthouse” Tony said “and I won’t tell them about this”
"Tony"
“Stark, what are you doing? Where is Steve?” He asks and Tony bites his lips whether he should answering him or not “Steve missing”
"Alright then, let me know if you need a help"
Tony smiled when he saw Steve is yawning "go get some rest" he said and Steve just nodded.
Steve just did at the same time Tony begin to spanks his bottom and Steve just lay there and letting out his yelps.
Tony, who is hearing it just stays silent because this is the first time he heard about Steve's childhood because even they were together, Steve never told him about it.
"What do you want, Barnes?" Tony asks from the other line.
“I’m the person who almost killed you earlier so I take you to my apartment, don’t worry you safe with me” the guy said “how you feel?”
"Okay, you too"
"He did it because he thought, I'm the last person that still alive from his timeline after Peggy dies. If you know much about him, you probably will understand why" Bucky continues "He loves you, Tony. The day after you give a ring back, he never smiles, or he just stays in his room."
"Hey, hey, take it easy, breath in and out"
The next morning, Tony is bringing his car to the Wakanda as he picks Steve and when Bucky took him out,
“I love you more” Steve said “now what I have to do?”
UPDATES!
Again Warning: this story has spanking included, so if this is not your things please skips it and ignored it :)
That night before dinner, Steve just finished preparing some food and decided to call his boyfriend in his lab and when he entered the lab,
“Wait me here” Tony said and Steve just did.
“Yeah”
Tony sighed and looked around, thinking about Bucky's words. Tony rub his temple and suddenly thinking about Steve.
Steve don’t know how long he slept and when he open his eyes, he couldn’t help but gasped,
All of those words probably right because none of my family actually care about me, all they care is only for ‘him’. Since he was exist, they suddenly didn’t care about me, heck none of them glance for a second, I’m just like I’m ghost. Since I was only 2, I don’t understand yet about this but time passed till now I finally understand with that look.
Tony then fetching the cane and the paddle before walking behind him and once that, he put the cane on the floor and take the paddle with him first. However, Steve's reacted different than the first time but he still stay since he won't disappointed the older man again. Yelping when paddle brought onto his bottom. Steve start to sobbing and wanted to reach back but he knew Tony will disappointed over him and after 40, he stopped before take the cane.
With that, Steve lay down on his lap and he buried his face onto the pillow while Tony wrapping his arm around his stomach and the other on his bottom with that, Tony raise his hand and began spanking him. Steve jerked at the first spanking but stay still on his lap. When Tony reach 30, he paused before pull down his underwear out of his ankles and put it along with his jeans before decide to spread his legs apart.
"Hands on your head" Tony said and Steve just did "now I want you stand there and think for what you just done while I'm going to tell the team about this situation" Tony said
Bucky keep telling the story about the real Steve Rogers after everything they only heard about Captain America.
"If you have a mission, there should be one or two people that come with you. You still can be a leader of team but you have listen to us and never do any stupid and I'm going to tell this to Fury later"
Bucky sighed "you don't know much about him yet, Stark."
Tony frowned "his father?"
Steve just smiles "you have him now, Bucks" he said pointed to Sam "he's that person who is going to be the end of your line"
Around 50, Steve start to sniffling and squirming around but Tony held him tightly and after 60, Tony stopped.
"Hush, save your sorry later once I'm done with you" Tony said as he lifted his hand and brought his hand down across his bottom and Steve yelped.
"I don't know what are you talking about. I hate him the moment he decides to pick Barnes over me" Tony said.
“I’m glad for doing this to you, Steve. That’s what’s friends are for”
"Stand up and lean on the arm couch please" He ordering and the younger man just obey.
Bucky frown “what do you mean he is missing?”
"Yeah, spanking. For a week, you can stay here and accepting your spanking. Right now, you will get your first bedtime spanking since it's midnight and after I drooping Peter to the school tomorrow, I'm hoping you already here and take your daily spanking. How that sound?"
"I don't know, I'm going to talk with him and have conversation with him"
Steve then just lay there while Tony examines the entire his bottom before he continues to spank his bottom again.
"Okay, I'll take the spanking" Steve said and Tony's eyes widened "as long as you can forgive me, that's okay"
After 10 calls, Tony finally give up and suddenly feel worried about him. Of course, Tony was mad with him and he hates him but it does not make Tony feel like he is such heartless. Tony still cares about him no matter what.
Steve wipe his tears away and it’s been six months since him and Tony are actually talking and he misses him. Steve sighed and grab his suitcase and found Tony on the outside. When Tony saw him, he just leading him into his car.
“How long?”
“I’ve said to the King, and he can’t be here because he had run to the country,” Bucky said.
Steve looking at the younger man who change his reaction after receive the phone and his dropping his phone.
I will Updates soon on Thursday :)
“Lift your hips” Tony said and Steve just did.
"We just started," Tony said.
"What? It's true like why the fuck he picks someone that was murdering my parents than me? I'm his boyfriend" Tony said.
“Okay, I’m going to asks Jarvis to buy the stuff for our roleplay” Tony said “now let me to finish it”
Bucky frowned when T'Challa told him that Steve is leaving him here without telling him anything. Bucky looks around and grabs his phone to call someone who belong to Tony.
Tony smiles lifted his chin “baby, me too” he said as he kissed his forehead and lips “I love you, baby”
Steve then looked around again and see another project and about to touch him when he feel sharp smack on his bum and Steve yelps,
An explosion coming out and Tony jumped "Steve!" his eyes widened as he panicked as he realized Steve wasn't there anymore "baby, where are you?"
"I have no idea who he is laughing for" Sam said.
“I’m going to pulls you down to my lap before I’m going to pulls down your pants and your underwear now” Tony said and Steve nodded.
"Yeah"
Meanwhile, Steve wakes up and doesn't know where he is and his hands are strapping into the walls along with his legs.
"Yeah, I hope so"
“How do you know me?”
"I had promised to him when we were young, and since then, he was my responsibility. His dad used to hit him and his mother."
"If you say so, can you give this to him please? I made this for him" Peter said as he showing his paint about baby Peter on Steve's shoulders while holding his shields.
Steve looked at him with his blue eyes "Tony, what's going on?"
Steve looks at him for a moment before slowly leaving him alone and Tony sighed.
How Tony will do that? Will Tony survive with Steve's misbehave behaviour adventure?
"I've been thinking yes I will forgive you after you can passed this punishments however the punishment I take is spanking" Tony said and notice Steve's eyes widened "spanking?"
Steve slowly snuggling himself into the younger man whom immediately accepted him and wrapped him around “it’s okay, Steve, you’re okay, you stay here”
Tony kisses his hair “I love you more, baby. Anything for you” he said “let’s we get some cuddles”
"Please"
"Yeah, Buck. It's me, uh, I'm using new number. Anyway can we meet up? There's something I need to tell you"
"I don't need your help! Rhodey is here and you can leave me now"
Once they were inside of the punishment room, Tony walking into the couch and take a seat "unbutton these, please" he said pointing his jeans and Steve just did and Tony immediately pull down his jeans and telling him to step out before put his jeans on the desk "lay down on my lap now"
Tony notice the look on Steve telling him seems excited with this but,
Tony then reaches his hairbrush "after this, I want you to stand in the corner and then we have a conversation about this" Tony said as he tapped the hairbrush on his bottom.
Meanwhile, Tony awake from his little nap and decide to check how Steve and frowning when he found the room empty and his eyes looking at the paper above the pillow.
“The first week is Teacher/ Student, then Dad/ Son, the third week is Boyfriends and the fourth week is random?”
"Who? Rogers?"
"I just talked to Bruce and some team will find out this soon once they are back in the tower. For a while, you will have to follow the rules that I made for you"
“Hey, you okay? Don’t worry, I’m not mad, I just curious” Finn said as he holding my hand.
"Steve No!"
“Where are you, Steve? I’ve been missing you lot, and it’s been six months since well, you know if you are coming back, I’ll forgive you” Tony said to himself as he looks at him and Steve’s picture.
“Hmm, carry me” Steve said as he wrapped his legs onto Tony’s waist.
"Hmm"
Finn couldn't stop crying as he packing his things as Steve helping him,
Hearing that, I sucked my breath and holding my tears. He know. Mr. Hudson know this and he will kicked me out from his class and he-
“Am I in trouble, sir?” I ask him and he sigh shook his head “no, it just, I keep saw you since the class started, you keep on your though and you seems in distress, you okay?”
Tony wish he could get Steve back to normal but the words that always came to his mouth making him can't do that so he decide to let him on his teen size and when they are out for Avengers business, Tony and Steve agrees to hide it from public even the Avengers know this but they are respecting this decision especially when it come to enemy who want take Steve so bad.
"Tony"
“Yeah” Steve said.
"Oh? About what?" Finn ask him and Steve just smile "you will find out later. Now you get done right? Let's get going"
Flashback over~
"Steve?"
Tony turned around "oh, hei" he smiled as he let Steve kiss his cheek.
“Tony, he used to abuse by his father and what you did was same like what he did to him!”
With that, Tony ended the phone and grab the flip phone from Steve and called him and sadly no response.
Steve frowned as Tony pulled down his pants and following with his underwear and Steve shocked,
"Just open the door and you will find out who," Bucky said.
“Steve, baby. Come here” Tony called him once he done.
I looked up as he sat beside me and he gave me his drink “here take this, I know you need it”
Note: If you guys don't know this book will be completely soft about Sambucky and SteveTony so if you guys a problem with that, just skipped it instead being a rude! Thank you xxx
“Ow!” Steve yelps but stay still.
"I'm sorry!"
“Sure, just write down here too” Tony said and Steve nodded.
“Okay”
"Two days before he left, I even heard the sound of cries from here, and I came to find him, but he never lets me to found him" Bucky added "you know with my conditions like this make me think that I failed him," Bucky said.
Flashback~
"Buck, was it Steve who called you?" Tony ask him and Bucky rolled his eyes "yeah that's him and now i'm on my way to meet him"
Tony’s eyes widened “please don’t tell him” and Bucky rolled his eyes “seriously, Stark. I, you know why he instantly accept your punishment?” Tony shook his head “because that’s how his father would do when he was younger!”
I look at his number, shall I call him? Maybe I don’t have to, I don’t want to be burden, heck I just know him an hour ago and I guess he seems like busy man. I don’t think that man give me his number in purpose. So after I change my clothes, I skip my dinner again.
"Steve, I-"
Tony looked at him feel betrayed and jealous at him.
"Uncle Bucky? You want to meet with uncle Steve?"
“Good morning, class! I’m Finn Hudson, today until forever I’ll be teaching you here after Mr. Anderson decide to leave this school last week” Finn said.
“Every morning, every night, his father will come from home looking so drunk and he will beaten Steve till I don’t know how long he can take it. Steve will show up on my house after his father did that and when I asked him what was wrong, he won’t tell me but I know what was going on”
"Please, not again" Bucky said whimpered and Sam who hear it rubs his back "it's okay, Buck. it's our future and we could stops it"
"Please sir" Steve cried as Tony brutally whipping him "I can't take it no more”
After my first class finished,
Steve huffed before he did sit on the chair as he waited for Tony to finished and when he can make sure Tony didn't see him, he decide to look at the weapon and touch it as suddenly,
"So, in other words you want me to looking after your friend while you away?" T'Challa ask him.
"I will do anything for you but please don't broke up our engagement, we're about to getting married"
Meanwhile, Bucky is currently babysit Peter on the compound when Tony walking into the living room, to find out Peter is curling up onto Bucky's side and he cooed at the sight when Bucky's phone beeping and he frowned at the unknown number.
Steve paused to write to checking on his bum through the mirror and he blushes again when Tony decide to hold his penis.
“Man, you know my step brother been crushing you? He won’t stop talking about how attractive you are”
“4 days ago, he came to my place, asking for apologize for what he had done to me and then he offering one thing that make me can forgive him. He said he can punish me and I did” Tony explained and he can’t see their reaction now.
"He is right, we can change our future" Tony said.
"Please no more!"
Steve nodded and lay on his lap again and Tony spread some lotion on his red bum and once he was done, Tony told him to get dressed in his pajamas.
"Hush, don't you want to have fun with me here? I know you and Stark are breaking up but looks"
Bucky frowned "I'm sorry, kid. I don't think our meet will be other things, probably about some adult conversation and I bet you will get worried after that"
The moment he hear him, Tony instantly blast him.
After ending the call, Bucky about to getting ready when some hands caught him.
"What was this?" Steve asked.
“Right. How I’m going to spanking you” Tony said.
Chapter One
Thank you for giving me your votes! I'm sorry for grammar since English is not my first language :)
"Don't" Tony pulled out of his ring from his finger and Steve's eyes are watering "here, your ring. I bring back for you"
"I still have no idea but looking the way Sam's speech, it might have related with Steve" Rhodey said.
Tony turned out into the voice from the corner and Tony letting out his screams "Oh my god" there in the corner is Steve currently sucking his thumb and he isn't himself but a teenager?
“If you want to go to vacation with me, I’ll wait you in the outside while you can pack your things” Tony added before leaving him alone.
Tony then scrolling his phone and looking the exact punishment that he deserve and his eyes landed into the one thing is spanking. Looking through the information, this is one of best things to do. After he put his phone,
"WHAT THE FUCK?!"
Tony then scrolled into his phone as something caught his eyes
"Tony"
and honestly Tony wanted to do this since Tony really admire Steve’s ass.
"I will stop once my hairbrush has a serious conversation with your bottom" Tony said as he began to smack his bottom.
"Wait, Tony" Steve squirmed "what are you doing?!"
"I don't know, he didn't tell me, he just said he will text me. Well, I must get ready now"
he could see how busy he was and Steve smiled at him.
“I know. That’s why I’m in love with you” Steve said “I always trust you”
Tony didn't respond him as he looking the younger man closely "you sure you want take any punishment?"
"Mom said the funeral the next week so I think you don't have follow me to Ohio, I won't paparazzi following you and your ex team find out you are here with me" Finn said as he finished packing.
Not long, Steve closes his eyes and begins to sleep.
"I'm currently away, why?"
"Since I still can't find the project to get you back to the original size and age, you will have to follow it. The rules are: no smoking, no party, not talking back, no swearing, and since you are turned to be a teenager, there will be more lot of rules and we will take a break"
Tony’s eyes widened “Steve?”
"Okay," Tony said, "why don't you wait for me and I'm going to follow you later?"
"I'm listening"
"Right away, sir"
"Oh my god"
With that, the guy pick Steve up to his car into his house and he was glad he just buy new apartment near where he almost killed him. He then put the younger man into the bed and grab some medical kit.
"Yeah. He's safe with me"
"You can stay here for a night, if you want" Tony offering him, even he is mad with him, he still has heart to not letting younger man stay outside after visiting him "and maybe we can talk about this"
Tony then begin to pulled down his sweatpants following with his underwear and let them out of his ankles, Tony spread both his legs.
Meanwhile inside, Steve is looking through the small mirror on the door and peaked saw Tony.
Tony decide to stop at 20 “you done” he said before he pulled Steve closer to him.
“Okay?”
"I'll text you later, see you in hour"
Tony frowned “I’ll be there tomorrow.”
Steve has hiding his identity when they were in public including they went to visiting Burt Hummel, Finn's step father. That's when he realize of something.
"I know you upset about him, and you hate him, but you know this isn't his fault? Like imagine if this yours and it's happened with one of your friends, you may be doing the same like him" Bucky said "you could think for forgiving him"
Steve then didn’t realize that in front of him there a car and suddenly, crack, he crashed into that car and his head knocking to the ground.
"Is Ross have behind this?"
Tony smiles “you can trust me, baby. I promise won’t hurt you in purpose”
Updates!! Sorry this is too shorts! DON'T FORGET TODAY IS TFATWS DAY !
Finn? I never heard that name before, he seems nice guy and I smile as he leaving the park. I decide to save his number before leaving the park as well. Once I arrive at my house, I saw Harry watching television with dads but they didn’t see me. I wipes my tears before run into my room.
Gasping at contain of paper, Tony grabbing his chest “oh God, he run away? Steve run away because of me? Because he really want to prove me that he is sorry for what he had done? He asking forgiveness and I just” He whimpering “shit, what I have done” he grip his hair before decide to looking at him.
“Yep, for a month we will do this roleplay spanking” Tony said “once the month we passed, we will do this again”
"Barnes told me Steve was leaving Wakanda a few weeks ago and he thought he was going to find me but well He's not here" Tony replies.
With that Tony leaving Steve alone without any comfort towards the younger man and after Tony leaving him, Steve finally letting his sobbing come out and rubbing his bottom.
"I'm currently working on my project and what about you?"
"Rogers, what are you doing here?" Tony ask him annoyed and crossed his arms, glaring at him "I came here to give you this" Steve said giving his shields to him "I guess you were right, I don't deserve have this after what happened with your father and this belong to you, only you"
"Tony"
"Hmm?"
Bucky sighed and Tony noticed it "what happened?"
Tony letting out his sigh as he looked at his boyfriend who currently still stood in the corner, Tony walked back to his room and entered the bathroom to pick the lotion and pick some new pajamas. Tony sits on the bed.
Steve bites his lips as he open the door and Tony almost gasped when he saw Steve. There in front of him, standing Steve Rogers.
Tony frowned “what?”
“Stark, he is here,” Sam said.
Steve slowly stand up as he walked into the corner and about to rubs his bottom but Tony stopped him,
"Alright, sir"
"Guys, I know we were in the bad terms right now but whatever happened in the future, we should stops it and we have to works together" Vision said.
Warning: Spanking! If this not your way and your style please ignored it!
“He uh run away after he came to me”
Just friendly reminder that in this fics
Tony sighed as he explained everything to the scientist and Bruce frowned "so, what we have to do now?"
"Well, I'm not taking his side but sometimes he has the right to do that because I'm pretty sure you would do the same with me," Rhodey said, "now, what his problem?"
That’s it, I couldn’t take it anymore so I grab him and hug him without realize and I was surprised he decide hug me back. I let my sob out and crying. Finn rub my back. Fuck this is the first time I feel someone hug me since I was baby, nobody hug me since then.
“So, for our warmed up spanking roleplay, I would like you to write down here whatever roleplay you want to play for a month”
Days passing, Tony still giving his hardest spanking towards Steve who honestly can't take it anymore until when day-4, Steve already waiting him into the punishment room, his hands around his head and naked from the waist down when Tony coming with bringing strap and leather strap.
"Huh?"
"Steve, honestly, I don't know what I have to do. You betrayed me. You didn't tell me what Bucky did to my father, you let him to killed my father"
"What are you doing?" Steve asked as he decided to snuggle on the older man.
"Who?" Steve asks through the paper and Tony frowned and Bucky frowned back.
"Damn! I can't believe it!"
"I know this is about me, the issues about us, but please don't ignored the others, they don't deserve all of this, it was my fault, not them. I was the person who making our team began like this but please don't give them any silent treatment"
“Nothing, sir. I was tired, yeah maybe I was tired so it make me I didn’t focus with class and I promise I won’t do that next time” I said looking down.
Steve looked at him “okay”
“What are you doing? I mean you sat here alone, by yourself” He ask and I looked at him who frowning “hey, you have tears on your eyes. Are you crying?”
Tony looked at Steve for a moment, even his beard suit on him, Steve still looked like a lost puppy and even he looked like he lost some weight since the last time what happened in Siberia. Tony then use his instinct to asks him.
Steve watches Tony pulled out the note and pen from his drawer and he pulled out the mirror,
Tony gasp before covering his mouth “oh my god”
“You bored?” Tony asked as he kissed his temple and Steve giggles before he pouted “I would like to do something fun”
Steve pouted "but I just want to see" he said.
Next morning, I woke up and ready to go to my school. I grab piece of toast before run leaving house. Once I arrive at school, I notice the same guy who give me his number yesterday. Finn notice me and smile on me as I smile back on him.
Tony frowned and looking at the flip phone on his drawer "I'm going to try to call him and let me know if you got info about him"
Steve just nodded as Tony lay him on his chest and Tony holding him protectively in his arms and not long Steve close his eyes and Tony give him one last kiss before he close his eyes as well.
SamBucky along with SteveTony are a thing so :)
Finn feel bad when he saw the older man’s reaction “hey, hey, it’s okay, Steve, you don’t have back right now, you can stay here as long as you wanted” and frowning deeper when Steve’s has panic attack “come here”
"You done and go stand in the corner" Tony said and when Steve still didn't move, Tony smacked him "now"
Tony let Steve to kiss his lips “why don’t we do this on our room?”
"I know you still care about him, Tones," Rhodey said as Tony frowned looking at him "what?"
"Where were you hiding, Steve?" Tony asked him and Steve finally looked at him, shocked but didn't respond him.
“Who?”
"Jarvis, keep on eye on him and make sure he didn't move while I'm telling the others"
"That's my project" Tony said "can you put them down? It's dangerous" Tony said.
Steve letting out his sniffles “I’m sorry! I didn’t know that!”
Steve nodded and walks back inside of the base where he found Tony is still laying on the ground where he leaving him.
It took few minutes to calm him and once Steve stop panicked, he looking at his eyes, blue meet black eyes.
"Oh my god, this is so gold" Clint said.
Bucky giggles hearing that 'that sound of sexc'
“Dammit, Steve. I know you secretly waited this” Tony thought when he saw his erection getting hard.
"Where do you guys want to meet?"
"I just made dinner," Steve said.
"Don't you dare you to touch him!" Steve snapped at him the moment Zemo mentioned Tony "where I am and what do you want from me?"
"I know this is my fault, Stark. But, you shouldn't have broken him as that" Bucky said.
"Yeah, I agree with Vis. Whatever it takes, we have to do this together, we're the Avengers" Tony said after a while.
“Finn? What happened?”
"Huh?"
After he make sure, Peter is sleeping, he walk down to his lab to upgrading his suit however his mind still crushing and keep thinking about Steve and also why He called Bucky instead of him?
With that, Tony walked out of his room before he pulled out his phone and called Bruce,
Once I feel like enough to cry, he gave his water to me drink and I accept it.
"Bruce"
"Punish you?"
Tony read the paper and see the list during their roleplay spanking.
“You have tears on your eyes so I’m pretty sure there are something in your head” He said “you know there are 4 kind of crying people and I’m pretty you feel it now” he said before wipe my tears away “talk to me, sweetheart, I promise, I won’t mad”
“Hey” a taller guy coming and I frowning this is the first person who actually notice me, notice my presence.
Tony bites his lips and when Steve about to hug his legs "please, Tony, joining with the team and meet with them, Bruce, Thor, Natasha, Clint, Wanda, Vision and even Sam are waiting for you. They really need you, they are nothing with you"
What happened when Steve Rogers accidentally touch one of Tony Stark's project and turned him to a teenager? What would Tony do with his boyfriend now? Like he just can't believe now that his boyfriend is a teenager and not only that Steve turned out to be a rebel teenager and always do something in the wrong way and leaving Tony have to deal with him to lead him back to the right path. When Bucky decide to visit them, Tony explained him and Bucky show Tony how to deal with naughty boy like Steve and Tony can't believe how inventor, and billionaire turn to be a babysit for Steve.
“Yeah, but he is so different. You better come here or maybe you should take him from here.”
