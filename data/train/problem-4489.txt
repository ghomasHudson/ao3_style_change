don't even want to be angry at him.” His lips twitched and he looked away, rubbing at his nose. “He gave me a hug. Tonight. Y'know, we've never really been huggers, exactly. But I was crying—he just stepped forward and wrapped his arms around me, tight.” Shaking his head, Dean added, “You're right. Part of me wishes it were simple. I was so geared-up for this to be the last time I saw him, the last time he spoke to me. I was ready for that—or thought I was. I would have known what to do with that, anyway: flip him the bird and drive off into the sunset to my happy ending with you.” Chuckling softly, Dean ducked his head. “What the hell am I supposed to do now?”
And if Dean failed, well... Dean was going to die an agonizing drawn-out death anyway unless he could find some escape from the human realm once the bond broke. Unbound Creatures never could stay long, but the shock of Castiel's death would undoubtedly speed the process. “She might...” Castiel realized, “demand that he pass more than one test.” He rubbed at his forehead. “From more than one person.”
Dean frowned, considering that. “I guess...that could be okay. But I was thinking more cowboy-themed.”
“No.” Dean shot Sam a glare. “No, I do not want to ask my baby brother for relationship advice.”
“Okay, but my point is,” Sam continued, “this isn't about Kinsey or Nick or Aaron or anyone else. This is about you and Cas. About how you feel when you're around him and how you feel when you're not. About how it feels to see him smile, or when he's sad. It's about how he's the most important person in your life and...it probably wouldn't hurt to throw in a compliment or two about his eyes.”
“Well...” Dean's gaze slipped away. “If you ever do get tired of me...” He scrubbed the fingers of one hand through his short hair. “Crowley says he knows a way to break a bond like ours, maybe even without injuring me in the process.”
“I wish I was gay,” Dean admitted, turning his half-empty beer bottle in his hands. It was—at least?—the third one he'd had that evening. They'd done a few shots as well. It was Friday night so neither of them had to work in the morning.
“Hey.” Dean rolled his eyes. “You're the one who was blushing.”
“It does,” John agreed, offering Dean a hopeful, encouraging smile.
Dean grimaces. “Right; I've got that on my side too, so unfortunately I know exactly what you mean.” It's some kind of ridge meant to keep the mattress from sliding off, apparently. Might make some small scrap of sense on a top bunk, but this thing's barely a foot and a half off the floor. Where's the mattress even gonna go?
After a quiet moment, Castiel said, “I apologize. I never meant to imply...”
“Benny,” Castiel commented, “is older than you and isn't married.”
one was angry and violent. We must remember this fight was to protect a child.”
“Why wouldn't you expect him to say yes?” Sam clarified. Dean stared at Sam until Sam added, “You do know he's gay, right?”
. You never bothered to update me on that.”
“Well...” Sam said, lengthening the vowel sound annoyingly. “Why?”
stand to—to lose you again.”
“It already is 'tomorrow',” Castiel said with a bit of a laugh as he stood up, sliding his phone into his pocket. “But thank you for the beer.”
“Healer Castiel Milton,” Judge Naomi Edlund said, voice ringing clear in the courtroom, “you stand today accused of wilfully and knowingly employing a malevolent Creature known as Dean Smith, feeding and harbouring said Creature in your home, and drawing upon his unclean power to do unlawful magics. How do you plead?”
Dean snorted inelegantly and flicked his brows upward. “Yeah, well, try to find a straight guy who'll admit to liking that sort of thing—or even one who'd ever try it in the first place to find out if he likes it. You're not gonna get very far.”
“Castiel is a friend from way back,” Sam filled in, saving Dean from having to explain who and what Castiel was to him exactly. “He practically lived here for a while there when Dean and Cas were in high school together.” Turning a smile on Jess, Sam added, “And Jess is my wife.” Looking at Castiel again, he clarified, “She and I met at university and we've been married for three years now.”
“At least we figured it out, huh?” Dean pressed a soft kiss to Castiel's lips. “Honestly,” Dean admitted, “loving you has been one of the simplest things in my life so far.” He'd never struggled with it like Castiel had, for years of agony, because, well, Dean had known right from the start that Castiel loved him back. It wasn't fair, but it had just been so much easier from Dean's side of things. And everything with Castiel, the kissing and talk of marriage and all of that, had just felt so
“They are asleep,” Castiel reasons.
“Benny,” Dean says, “I will punch you in the face.” Benny just chuckles again, and Dean heaves an exasperated sigh. Much quieter he says, “Cas, can we turn over?”
Edlund narrowed her eyes slightly at Castiel, her lips a prim line. “You deny all these charges against you?”
“All right.” With a final reassuring squeeze, Dean let Castiel's hand go and started the engine.
John stood up a little straighter, staring at Dean. “You and Castiel are—getting married.”
Dean swallowed roughly, managing just barely to say, “Yeah.”
Edlund pursed her lips slightly. “And it is my understanding from the officers who brought you in after that incident that you have refused to summon your familiar.”
“And how did he react to that?” Wesson asked. “To the prospect of battle?”
“Cas,” Dean countered with a teasing twist of his lips, “we've known each other for five years: I think anything we do at this point automatically qualifies as 'slow'.”
Dean shrugged, worrying his lip a little and looking back at Castiel. “I'm sure it happens.” Castiel shrugged noncommittally but he kept looking at Dean like he was
. “I'm not gonna risk burning myself on the stove,” Sam adds. “Or starting a fire.”
“More so than I have, anyway,” Sam commented just loud enough for Dean to hear and roll his eyes.
“You wanna call Adam and ask his advice?” Sam teased.
Dean sighed, draining the last of his beer and making an unimpressed face at the empty bottle. “I told him about my stupid crush on Doctor Sexy, about my college experimental phase...”
Castiel chucked softly as well and let his fingers trail down the side of Dean's jaw before letting his hand fall into his lap. “I suppose I am.”
no one asked.” Cringing, Dean wondered if maybe John or even Kate at that point had stuck their noses in. Dean hadn't heard anything about it, but that didn't mean nothing like that had happened. In any case, Sam and Jess were now safely married and apparently planning on staying that way for a good long time. Though maybe that's how everyone planned it, going in.
“Why?” Dean pressed his lips together, eyes burning. “He's changed his opinions. Everything's good now. It shouldn't matter what he said years ago because now—” Dean sucked in a breath and let it out. John had acknowledged that he'd been wrong. What more did Dean
“Well, I...” Dean rubbed at the back of his neck then reached over and set his beer bottle on the coffee table since he hadn't been drinking it for a while anyway. He scrunched up his face a bit. With a shrug, he said, “I guess it turns out you and I are a lot more alike than I thought.”
Castiel nodded slowly. “I see your point.”
“You can't budge back any farther?” Dean grouses as he tries to lie down for real. Everyone's taken a good long piss off the porch into the falling rain, the horses are good for the night, and Benny's assured everyone that he's got the fire set up to keep them warm until morning. Sam and Benny and Kevin are settling into what actually seem to be reasonably comfortable positions on the floor with no one in any apparent danger of coming into contact with the stove so long as none of them decides to do an unreasonable amount of flailing about. Sam got a bit wet again running out to check on the horses, but all told it seems like they're set for a pretty decent night. Except the bed really is narrow, and Dean's pretty sure there's at least an inch or two between Castiel and the wall.
Castiel's shoulders slumped, and he closed his eyes. “Fine. Please...elaborate.”
“Maybe that's why some people decide to have sex before marriage,” Castiel mused. “Because then there's no set date, no specific time when they feel like they 'have to'. Though...I suppose there is also some appeal to planning things so the first time can be special.”
“But not your dad?”
“Some of it,” Castiel replied. “If you'd be open to it.”
still jeans and a t-shirt so he hadn't exactly over-dressed for the occasion.
“What, you mean because of this?” Dean looked down at himself with a bashful smile. “This was just easier—I can make myself pretty again.” To prove his point he shifted into his fae form. He offered Castiel a smile. “See?”
“But you needed the other form for the rescue,” Castiel guessed.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Bi is a thing, Sammy. Look it up.”
an idea.”
Sighing, Adam picked up his fork and worried it with his fingertips. “I came out as gay,” he said bitterly. “And Mom couldn't deal.”
Castiel stared at him, hand still on the doorknob, for an awkwardly long pause. He didn't look particularly relieved or amused or...whatever Dean had been hoping for as a best case scenario. Dean wasn't really sure what he'd been hoping for. Finally Castiel said, “I...suppose that would be best.”
Dean rubbed a hand down his face. “These things with guys never work out. I told him about that, by the way, about Nick and Aaron. He thinks I'd be happier with a woman; he kept saying it.” Dean took a swallow of his beer. “He's probably right, even though I've never had a relationship with a woman last longer than about two weeks.” Snorting softly, Dean shook his head. “I was with Nick at least that long.” Dean's lips twisted in distaste at the realization, “Pretty sure Nick fucking Munroe was the longest relationship I've ever had.”
“It was.” Castiel nodded. He had neither been very young nor particularly inexperienced when he first met Dean. Perhaps Castiel had been naive, though, as he had never quite expected or properly prepared for this turn of events.
“About as boring as it sounds,” Castiel filled in with a small half-smile. He shrugged, adding, “But it's steady hours, steady work. I can't really complain.”
“There's really...” Sam observes, looking about the small room, “not a lot of floor-space in here.”
“You two are going to give me cavities,” Crowley said as Dean returned Castiel's smile all fond and warm. “You're so very gentle with him, Castiel. Honestly. I've often theorized that you could force a change in a Creature so close to the line as he is in an afternoon by simply submerging them in a vat of Blessed Water. In an uninjured subject—bit of fortifying magic ahead of time should forestall any unfortunate death-related side effects.” Tilting his head to the side thoughtfully, he added, “I've half a mind to try that with Meg one of these days.”
The heat from the stove is bordering on uncomfortably hot through the blanket against Dean's back, but the heat from Castiel's body is warm and pleasant against Dean's front. There's a bit of chilly draft nipping at the tops of Dean's ears, but if he tilts his head just right then the tip of his nose stays warm in the little bubble of air bracketed in between their shoulders and the back of Castiel's neck. Castiel's hair smells like sweat and the forest because it's been a few days since any of them have been near a shower, and rain doesn't count.
The gravel scuffed softly under Dean's own boots as he rocked his weight onto the balls of his feet and back. He gave the old broken refrigerator standing against the wall an unimpressed look. No wonder Kate had left. She'd always been neater, more concerned with cleanliness and appearances than John. They'd fought about it.
“What?” Dean shook his head and chased after Castiel's retreating form, catching him by the shoulder with one helpless hand. “Cas, please. Don't do what?”
“Yeah, uh.” Dean pushed himself up to follow Castiel to the door, head feeling fuzzy. Maybe he'd been this fuzzy the whole time and not minded. That was the point of alcohol, after all. “Maybe we could, uh, hang out tomorrow. If you're not busy.”
Sam, predictably, shot Dean an unhappy-disappointed look for that, but John just shrugged. “Wait till you get to my age.”
Castiel took a careful sip of the tea. “I suppose.” He grimaced slightly. “Though I...” He sighed. “At this point Dean and I can't return to that town or anywhere near it.” They should seek out Anna and Balthazar, perhaps rejoin them on their ongoing quest. Wherever they might be. Castiel winced. “I suppose I actually have no idea where we currently are.”
Dean let his eyes fall shut at the feeling. It was all too much. He was
“Right.” Dean's lips twisted with distaste. “So
It's a bit awkward, there being no way to adjust their positions without rubbing all over each other unless they actually want to fall off the bed. But they do manage to get turned so they're both facing the wall. And this is kind of better because now all anyone could see in the flicker of the firelight is Dean's back. He can wrap his arm around Castiel and put his hand in the middle of Castiel's chest without worrying that anyone will catch a glimpse and think it's funny. Or gay. Or funny because it's gay.
“I'm sorry.” Dean cleared his throat, suddenly guilty about where he'd unthinkingly steered the conversation. “I know you—you really don't like—”
Frowning, Castiel finished drying his hands and hung the towel up again then pulled his phone from his pocket and unlocked the screen. “I have responded to every one of your texts.”
Dean wrapped his arm around Castiel's shoulders, tugging him a bit closer. Pressing a kiss to Castiel's hair, Dean whispered, “I love you.”
“You are so beautiful,” Dean said without quite meaning to. His cheeks heated and he smiled self-consciously.
“Just don't leave out the part where I was drunk,” Dean grumbled.
“Yeah, and it turned out your mom lied to you when she said hers wasn't.” Dean shrugged. “That has to be worse.”
“Well, I mean...” Dean let out a breath, shoving a hand back through his hair. The beer he had left in the bottle sloshed a bit as he shifted to fold his legs under himself. “I'm over thirty now.”
Dean shrugged, flexing his hands against the smooth familiar curve of the Impala's steering wheel. “I mean, 'the worst' is
Castiel nodded. “Yes, of course.” When Dean hesitated again with his claw above Castiel's skin, Castiel added, “Go on; it's all right.”
All the hairs on Castiel's arms stood up. Narrowing his eyes, he looked at the sky just in time to see Dean burst out of the clouds like a clap of thunder, wings dark and imposing against the darkening sky.
The wood of the pole at Castiel's back felt solid as the guards bound him securely.
Walking over quietly, Dean sat next to Castiel and placed a gentle hand on Castiel's thigh, warm through the thin material of his pyjama pants. “Cas, I am so sorry.”
Castiel shrugged. “More or less.” His lips twisted a bit. “I think a big part of it was that they weren't you.” Reaching out, he put his hand on Dean's knee and gave it a squeeze. “I'm glad we found each other again.”
“Still have our happy ending?” Castiel suggested.
Chuckling, Dean dropped his gaze to his plate and poked at his remaining food. “Uh...I mean, I think we can wear whatever colours we want. We haven't worked out all those details yet.”
Leaning in, Castiel pressed a soft kiss to Dean's cheek. “You are especially beautiful when you're blushing.”
to be a total asshole?”
“He was injured in the battle with the Shade,” Castiel explained, “and retreated to heal.”
“Yeah, um,” Dean said, feeling foolish. The thing was, it was
“I have no idea what I feel,” Dean said, shaking his head. “I just...” He sighed, turning a wobbly sort of smile on Castiel. “I want...a lot...to spend the rest of my life with you. Is that—is that stupid?”
Castiel nodded slowly. “Again I can't really be sure, but it does seem...likely that I would have had some water already blessed by either myself or by Anna or Balthazar and would have used that in one or more of our early cleansing rituals.”
to do with him.”
“It can also be useful,” Dean shot back. Grimacing, he looked away. “Look, Crowley made sure no one would get...seriously hurt. I insisted on that, and as far as I saw no one did.” Crouching down, he sought Castiel's eyes, one hand gently touching Castiel's face. “Cas, are you angry with me?”
“I could switch with you, Dean,” Kevin offers. “If that would help.”
“But he was.” Dean shrugged. “He's got a daughter and everything.”
Castiel flashed him a warm grin. “Maybe we should save one or two things for the wedding night.”
A ghost of a smile tugged at Castiel's features. “You know the Lake of Fire isn't—”
Wesson cleared his throat. “It could perhaps be considered a minor offence to refuse to cooperate with officials in this manner. Though—” He glanced sideways at his companions. “—if the familiar is injured, attempting to summon him could in fact interfere with his recovery.”
idea anymore. It would be like copying off his brother's homework, and Dean was pretty sure a proposal was supposed to come from his heart. He finally settled on, “Your hands.”
Sam laughed in breathless disbelief and Dean elbowed him harder for that. Still laughing, Sam held up his hands in surrender—which looked a bit silly because he had a beer in one of them. “Sorry, sorry.” Grinning, he shook his head and took a swallow of his beer. “You gotta admit, Dean: you and I have both done some dumb things while drunk...but proposing is a new one.”
“He and I dated,” Dean snapped. “I even liked it at first. I'm pretty sure it fucking counts.”
“Dude,” Sam said, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Cas is crazy about you.”
jeans and a t-shirt he might wear on a date, but he was trying to do this right this time and it
“Missouri and Kevin tell me,” Wesson said standing outside Castiel's cell in the flicker of the evening torchlight, “that your testimony was sincere and also that you're definitely hiding something.”
“Do I get to be the best man at your wedding?” Sam asked, walking around the front of the car and shaking his hair off his forehead.
“Right, like that's an accomplishment,” Dean said, climbing off the car and stretching his limbs to get the blood flowing properly again. “I could go get engaged tonight if I wanted. It's not like it would be hard. Just walk into any random bar,” he reasoned, gesturing to his face, “looking like this.”
“Because then,” Dean reasoned, pressing even closer and tipping his face up so he could look at Castiel, “the two of us could get married.”
“Two of us could share the bed,” Castiel points out. “If we laid on our sides, we should fit.” He considers the bed, frowning. “If just barely.”
Castiel's eyes widened. “Have you...considered it?”
gets to find out that you've changed your mind, done a total one-eighty. Now you're all 'I love my gay son' here.”
Leaning in, Castiel kissed him. Pulling back he said, “A week ago, Dean, you told me you weren't sure you even found me attractive, and now you're begging me to touch you.”
“Every Monday and Thursday,” Castiel said, as though Dean needed the reminder. Maybe he did. He wasn't really sure when he'd last taken his own garbage out. Must have been Wednesday night. He would have noticed if anything was about to overflow, and just one person didn't generate all that much garbage anyway, so it was fine. Turning back towards the house, Castiel gestured towards the walkway back to the side door. “I assume you...wanted to come inside?”
“Kevin's still in school,” Castiel pointed out.
Adam shrugged, slumping a bit in his seat. “I mean, other kids have been through worse.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Dean rolled his eyes a little as he turned his attention back to his food. “I'm sure I got your genetic predisposition there.”
Castiel spreads his hands. “I mostly drink with you.”
“Sandwiches,” Castiel said, turning to walk into the kitchen. He nodded towards the cupboards and said, “If you could help by setting the table.”
Dean raised his brow even higher at that, one side of his lips curling upwards. “You been checking out Cas' abs, Sammy?”
Looking down at his hands, Castiel worried his fingers a bit. “I believe he understood I didn't mean to hurt him, that I was trying to help. He may not have...fully understood what I was offering, what it meant.”
Edlund frowned at him. “Was there some falling-out between you and your family?”
And especially not if you said it because you couldn't think of a better way to get him to stay.
Dad both quoting Bible verses at me while Jess nods her agreement and assures everyone the both of us are well and truly damned to hell.”
John shot Dean a hard look. “Whatever childish sibling rivalry you've managed to hold onto all these years, you have no right to try to make him feel unwelcome in his home or unaccepted by his family.”
“Yeah, well.” Dean wrinkled his nose and swallowed. “Guess that's what happens when you make stupid decisions like that.”
“I suppose...” Castiel's nose scrunched up a bit. “Objectively, it is.”
“Well, guess what?” Dean rounded on John, vibrating with rage. “
“Okay, but...” Sam frowned, shaking his hair off his forehead again. “Let's rewind back to that part where you didn't expect him to say yes.”
“Right, yeah.” Dean nodded. “Even if they ask stupid questions like 'who tops?' or whatever.” He wrinkled his nose. “It's just like when Sam was engaged to Jess, as far as I'm concerned—they didn't share details about any sex they may or may not have been having and it was none of the rest of our businesses, and I hope to
Castiel roughly brushed Dean's hand off and turned his head to look upon Dean with flashing anger. “Can we not do the thing where you're so desperate to get married you'd even consider
, Sammy!” Dean lets out an exasperated breath. “You and I are never going to have a conversation with these words in it. That is not a reality that exists.”
Sam stared at Dean until Dean was about to snap at him and then finally Sam said, “What universe have I been living in?”
“That...” Castiel gave his head a little shake and blinked a couple of times. “You wanted a sexless marriage.”
“All right.” Swallowing, Dean gave a jerky nod. His voice sounded strange to his own ears. “Sounds good.”
it...”
“Right.” Sam nodded. “Tough year. Or, it was for me. I found grade twelve easier, actually. Academically, anyway.” He shook his hair off his forehead. “So how is school going?”
“I apologize,” Castiel says, pulling back a bit—which is probably as far as he can, considering the extremely limited space.
“Many times, as is advisable for us all in ritual cleansing.” Castiel had been administering it quite regularly, though of course never directly; Castiel drank it and then had Dean drink his blood. Administering the Water directly, at least early on, might have killed Dean. At this point it would probably have been safe to try having Dean touch it, but Castiel hadn't been in a rush.
Wesson cleared his throat. “Healer Castiel, can you describe your familiar's mood and attitude leading up to the battle? Was he unsettled or upset? Agitated?”
Sam winces, looking about again, considering. “I don't think we'd even fit that way. Maybe if we were all as small as Kevin, but even then.” He worries his lip, shaking his head.
“You just want me to get rejected while sober,” Dean grumbled.
Castiel tilted his face up to smile warmly at Dean. “It really didn't feel simple at all for a long time.”
needed it.” Dean's gaze burned intense and insistent. “They were going to kill you, Cas. Did you have some other plan? Some better option?”
say that.” He shook his own head, trying to remember. “I couldn't have said that, wouldn't have.” Grabbing Castiel's shoulders, he gave him a rough squeeze and a bit of a frustrated shove. “I'm not going to consign the both of us to a life of monk-itude.” His lips twisted into a pained and horrified grimace. “Is that what you thought you were agreeing to?”
Castiel scoffed softly. “I'm sure he's happy to have us owe him our lives.”
Dean bit the inside of his lip. “Uh...just that...I wanted to marry him.”
“You need to stop drinking shit whisky,” Castiel comments, taking a swallow of the whisky himself before passing it on.
As much as Dean loves Sam and Benny and Kevin, he'd rather they all be somewhere else right now.
The guard caught Castiel's arm to steady him as he stepped onto the platform and Castiel murmured, “Thank you,” before realizing just how strange that was.
Wesson grimaced slightly. “Under the right circumstances, a skilled demon could probably fool most anyone—but perhaps more important to this discussion is the relationship between fae and demons. Considerable evidence suggests that fae and demons are in fact not two species, but one, and thus a single being may move from fae to demon and back in the course of their lifetime. This of course leads to your other question: how
“We're talking right now,” Castiel deadpanned as he reached for the towel. “And this is the first time you've come over since last weekend, so I'm not sure I—”
“You'd like that?” Castiel checked as he tugged gently on Dean's hands to draw him closer as he backed slowly towards the living room.
Oh, right. Castiel swallowed. Perhaps he couldn't make his voice carry quite far enough for most of the crowd to hear, but Edlund's scribe stood at the ready to record Castiel's statement. “In all the time I've known him, Dean was never malevolent.” Clouds darkened over the square and the air chilled. Several in the crowd looked up and about worriedly, probably rethinking their decision to attend an execution that day. Castiel made his voice as strong and sure as he could. “He's always been...kind. Perhaps it is easier to go about your lives judging people by appearances—”
Castiel nodded. “For the most part, yes. He's seemed...restless at times, always eager to find some activity to fill his days.” Castiel shrugged. “Though he does like reading, so long as there's a story.” Castiel's lips twisted wryly. “He's not keen on research tomes and the like. But he has from the start expressed both gratitude and affection towards me.”
good, and... Castiel pulled back, staring at Dean, and breathing, “Oh.”
Castiel dropped his gaze. “No,” he admitted quietly. His hands moved gently against the warm skin of Dean's arms. “I'm sorry.” Pressing his lips together he glanced up at Crowley again before seeking Dean's gaze. “But Dean...what could you possibly have paid him?”
“I uh...” John considered Dean for a moment. “I didn't realize there'd been another one.”
Dean stood outside Castiel's door, psyching himself up. Castiel's car was in the driveway so it was pretty likely he was home. And it wasn't creepily early or uncomfortably late. Dean was freshly showered and maybe he'd put on his
Castiel's gaze moved from Crowley to Dean to Crowley and back. “I...didn't want Crowley's help.”
It was funny in a way, but the house, the yard...it had never looked so odd when Dean was growing up there. It had just seemed normal, and even when Kate complained it had seemed like probably she was overreacting. But this just...wasn't normal. The people who'd called Sam and Dean 'hillbillies', 'rednecks', or worse when they were in high school might have had a point. When your clothes were hand-me-downs and you lived in a dump, well.
“Good?” Castiel asks, one hand hesitantly resting against Dean's chest.
Edlund inclined her head in apparent interest. “So you believe this must have been the Creature's true form?”
“Only two of us can fit on the hood,” Dean reasoned.
“And where is he now?” Edlund demanded.
how I'm your last resort and how that's supposed to be a compliment.”
“You could always ride horses on the beach,” John put in.
“Not at all,” Castiel replied. “Once Dean was enough recovered, I'd always planned to rejoin Anna and Balthazar, at least for some missions.”
“Well, Benny and I are huge,” Sam points out. “And apparently when you're trying to fit everyone safely in this one cabin for the night...”
“Such confidence you have in my skills,” Crowley commented from the doorway before walking over to set a tray down on the bedside table with a metallic clink. “Though, if anyone has need of any Blessed Water, I'm sure
Sam twisted his brows in incredulity. “You brought up kids?”
“It's not about 'evidence',” Sam countered, exasperated. He rubbed a hand over his mouth. “I think I'm starting to understand why this didn't work out.”
It took Dean a moment to process that Castiel was in the middle of trying to take the garbage out and Dean was in his way. “Oh, sorry,” Dean said, stepping to the side.
“Hell,” John muttered, stepping forward and pulling Dean into a hug. Dean stayed motionless for perhaps a beat too long before finally returning the hug, breaths shaky in his chest. “I'll always love you, son,” John said, holding Dean tight. “That's not something I can just turn off. And if you and Cas love each other—that's a
“As intentionally ridiculous as that suggestion is,” Sam counters, “we are trying to avoid the bad future where someone touches the stove during the night and gets injured or burns the cabin down, and stacking people wouldn't even help.”
“Is there something
“So?” Dean demanded. “Am I supposed to be scared? That you're angry? Scared of
Dean's lips pull into a crooked grin. “You hitting on me, Cas?”
as a viable option, despite all the obviously valid reasons that's a terrible idea? I don't need to be told
Dean nodded a bit as he pulled his claw back and a sort of ripple ran through his body with a gentle sigh as he shifted fully into his demon form, leather wings snapping a little as Dean's mouth closed over the beading drop of blood on Castiel's finger.
“So,” Castiel said after a beat, “we wait until everyone's had time to eat a decent amount but before they get a chance to leave the table. And then we tell them.”
Castiel winced. “I was aware that some go out seeking Creatures to bond, to augment their magic. And that some even resort to trickery or violence to achieve that end. I...suppose I never looked much deeper into the practice as I always found the idea abhorrent.” He let out a tired breath. “So no, I was unaware of the potential side-effects of initiating bonds in that manner.”
Castiel's hand found Dean's on his shoulder and squeezed it. “I haven't taken proper care of you.”
“He...” The image of Dean pacing the bit of open floor before Castiel's desk floated to the forefront of Castiel's mind. The familiar sound of cloven hooves against the wooden floorboards. One corner of Dean's lips flickering upwards as he shot Castiel a mildly impatient look. Castiel swallowed, feeling guilty. “He was hungry.”
With an annoyed huff, Castiel rolled his eyes. “In my youth there were some times when I did through inexperience cause some minor harm, but none of that was within this jurisdiction.”
“Sorry, I wasn't expecting visitors,” Castiel said as he moved past Dean, dragging the heavy bag to the curb. It took another moment for Dean to process that Castiel was wearing a stained white shirt and worn sweatpants.
More than anything, Castiel just wanted to see Dean. To tell Dean how very proud he was of him and how much he loved him. Had Castiel ever properly expressed that?
Edlund inclined her head slightly. “Thank you, Seer Missouri, Scholar Sam.” She turned her gaze back to Castiel. “Healer Castiel, can you describe your first encounter with your familiar and how he came into your employ?”
from him? “Hell, Cas. He's even helping brainstorm ideas for our gay wedding.”
Wesson leaned back in his chair. “If Healer Castiel's testimony is true, Dean must indeed be a fae.”
“I'm glad you all could make it,” John said, offering them all a grateful and slightly hesitant smile. Holding his hands to either side of himself, he said, “Let's ask the blessing.” Everyone joined hands around the table, bowing their heads. “Dear Lord,” John began, “we thank you so much for this day, for this food, for the table set before us and the people gathered here together this evening. We ask that you bless this food and our time that we have together. In Jesus' Name, amen.”
“Yeah,” Dean agreed with a damp laugh. “And if my confusing mess of a family wants to be there, to be a part of it...” He shrugged. “Might as well let them, right?”
Dean's dick jumped at that, hardening again as if the prospect of Dean giving Castiel a hand-job had anything at all to do with Dean's own dick. “I swear I can do other things too,” Dean tried. “I'm just...a bit rusty, but...”
Maybe the thought could help Wesson feel better, at least.
Castiel raised his chin. “Not guilty.”
!” Dean gestured broadly with the empty beer bottle. “How much more evidence does he need? I gave him...at least four pieces of evidence. That should be enough, I think.”
“I once had a man unzip his pants and stick his genitals in my face,” Castiel deadpanned. “I'm not sure how 'innocent' I could claim to be at this point.”
“This has to do with
Castiel paused for perhaps half a second longer than he should have but then said, “With Dean.”
Wesson nodded, frowning slightly. “Perhaps...” He shrugged, letting both hands slap lightly against the fabric of his trousers. “He could be in the fae realm. You wouldn't be able to summon him if he were there.”
Dean smirked. “Yeah, so you're officially smarter than
“I refuse to put his health and safety in peril,” Castiel replied firmly. “If it is a crime to refuse, then I will accept due punishment.”
“I'm just—trying to understand,” Wesson argued.
“Wish I was gay,” Dean repeated. Maybe this wasn't really...the sort of thing he was supposed to say out loud, but...Castiel was his best friend. His very best friend. And Dean was a bit drunk, and everyone said things while drunk they wouldn't say normally.
Rolling his eyes, Dean let out an exasperated huff. “Yeah, a hell of a lot more gay than I am; believe me, I am aware.” When Sam insisted on continuing to gape in apparent disbelief, Dean grumbled, “Look, I didn't actually 'propose'. I didn't ask him to marry me; I just said that I
“Well.” Castiel's cheeks pinked a bit and he cast his eyes downward. “A bit. I suppose I really don't know what it's like, and I'll admit...I'm a little curious.”
. Why can't things just go back to the way they were?”
“Dean!” Castiel exclaimed when they re-materialized and Dean carefully set Castiel on his feet on a smooth stone floor. But it...shouldn't have been possible. Gripping Dean's biceps for balance, Castiel glanced about the space until his eyes fell upon the one factor he apparently hadn't let himself consider, the robed man leaning casually against the wall with his arms folded and a smirk on his face. So, not the fae realm after all, then. Castiel's lips twisted with distaste as the realization twisted his gut. “Crowley.”
“Are you all right?” Castiel asked.
“Yeah, sure,” Dean says, because obviously this is gonna need to be a team effort thing like it was last time. This stupid bed is honestly barely big enough for one grown adult. The bed creaks a bit as they get re-situated, but thankfully none of the other three people in the room stir or make any sounds of waking. Dean tugs the blanket up over his shoulder and tucks his chin in towards his chest. Even if they are all deeply asleep, Dean's not really sure he likes facing them again.
gay.”
Dean flicks his eyebrows at Benny. “Yeah, well, just make sure you're the one right here.” He gestures to the space in front of the bed. “Then when I fall off, I'll land on you and then you and I can cuddle.”
all still in the room?”
much smaller than you,” Kevin points out.
“Well, technically.” Castiel's lips twitched a bit and he looked away. “I'm not
“Well, I
Dean let out a quiet huff of frustration. “I'm not gay enough for him. For one thing.”
Castiel shrugged. “It doesn't tend to go over so well amongst gay men, in my experience and understanding.”
Shifting just slightly back against Dean, Castiel replies in an equally quiet murmur, “Enough to sleep, I think.”
“Still,” Sam insisted. “I am sorry you had to go through that—but I'm glad you're here.”
“I'm not
“Dean,” Castiel said, quiet and wounded.
“What monster was that?” Edlund pressed.
Pulling back a step, Castiel looked down over his own body. “I think perhaps...I should take a shower before we do anything...intimate.”
Dean couldn't help grinning all broad and stupid at that thought. “Yeah?”
Dean rolled his eyes. “He didn't actually want you dead. Or me, I guess. He's not entirely evil.”
“I suppose—” Dean cleared his throat. “I suppose there's always an expectation there, just because that's what people expect. Even if they've already been having sex, I guess.” He shrugged.
“He's tired,” Castiel objected. “And also he's not your dancing monkey.”
“Of course.” Wesson nodded. “But, Castiel.” He fixed Castiel with a serious look. “He could die anyway. And you will die anyway.”
The metal bars made a clanging sound and Castiel turned to see Wesson gripping them with one hand. “Call him,” Wesson said. Grimacing, he added, “How could it hurt, really? They're executing you tomorrow.” Twisting his lips, he looked away. “When that happens...does he return to the fae realm?” Sighing, Castiel looked down at the straw-strewn floor. Dean may never have been to the fae realm and even if he could possibly enter in his current state he likely didn't know the way. “I can bless water,” Wesson pressed. “If I administer the test and he passes, Judge Naomi would have to overturn her ruling.”
Taking one hand off the wheel, Dean caught Castiel's hand where it lay on his knee and squeezed it in response. “I'm glad we did too.”
“I'm sure there is,” Sam commented.
With a frustrated huff, Dean leaned against the wall and folded his arms. “Yeah, after like seven to ten hours, and then it's just like one or two words, as if that counts.” He nodded his head towards Castiel's phone. “The most recent was me asking how's it going and you saying 'fine' six and a half hours later.”
“Just as there is of course between that,” Wesson continued, “and tying a Creature up and prying their mouth open to pour the blood in.” He shrugged. “I can't exactly call what you did unethical.”
“Okay, so, uh, there isn't enough room,” Sam points out, putting his hands on his hips and looking around the room as if maybe he's missed some key piece of floor-space somewhere. They're trying to lay out bedrolls, and they've already stuck the chairs and stump-stools they used for supper out on the porch. They'd take the kitchen cupboards out, but they're a bit too attached and no one thought to bring a crowbar. And Sam really is just so damn
Edlund raised a brow. “You claim to have never once in your entire life harmed anyone or their property, even by accident?”
“Sure.” Dean rubbed at his nose. Maybe there really was some way to fix this. Sam was smart. And he was married, which meant he might actually know a thing or two about relationships.
Dean rolled his eyes, scoffing. “This has
Castiel shook his head. Rubbing at his arm through the sleeve of his shirt, he said, “No. Well, not really, anyway. I mean, maybe at first I thought about it some. Like, is this even still possible, being gay and all? Is it still...'allowed' to wait until marriage? And I kind of...” He scrunched up his nose. “I kind of wanted someone to prove that it was, to show me he loved me enough to wait. But at the same time...the importance of writing my name on a yellow heart and sticking it to a red construction paper cross masking-taped to the wall...well, it faded over time. I didn't really feel like God, assuming he still wanted me after all, would really hold me to that.”
Castiel offered Dean a soft smile as he slipped his pyjama shirt on. “We should set a date. I'm excited for this beach cowboy wedding.”
Wesson's brown hair fell across his forehead as he ducked his head, shaking it. “Even if you are wilfully and knowingly protecting a partially-corrupted Creature, I don't believe that's worthy of death.” Grimacing, he shrugged. “Far from it. I begged for time to investigate more thoroughly, but...Judge Naomi is unyielding.”
“So, Cas,” Sam said, “it's been a while, man. What have you been up to? Working?”
“And your kin whom you mentioned being present for this event,” Edlund asked, “were they aware of your intentions? You are a family of monster-hunters; perhaps one of them may have been aware of risks that you were not. Did neither offer any warnings on this matter?”
Dean nodded. “That's the plan.”
Worry creased Castiel's brow. “Haven't you been eating?”
, because...you're the one I want to be with, the one I want to spend my life with, to grow old together...with. I don't really know what all of that means, but I don't think it's entirely platonic.” Swallowing, he added, “And if you don't want to marry me, that's fine. I could live with that. So long as you still talk to me, so long as we still spend time together and—” He blinked his burning eyes. “So long as I haven't ruined this completely. I just want you back, Cas. However you'll take me.”
Castiel nodded slowly. “I...remember.”
to hate him,” Dean objected. “Why would I want to hate him?”
“Well, I had to move...back here.” Adam's fork clattered against the edge of his plate and he shot John a helpless look.
Dean shifts a little closer, not like creepy close with his crotch grinding against Castiel's ass or anything, but like...nice close? Dean murmurs quietly so only Castiel should be able to make it out, “Comfortable?”
“Okay but,” Adam cut in, “who takes who's last name?”
“Dad's been growing.” Dean gestured to John with his fork. “Side to side, anyway.”
. I tried
to Dean, sliding one hand around to press against Dean's chest and pull him closer against Castiel's body.
“Maybe...” John tried, “in a few years when the little girl starts asking questions...” He shrugged. “The mother could change her mind.”
“Well, that's just the thing!” Dean let out an exasperated breath. “They never talked about any of that. They just got us group of dumb teens who didn't know anything about anything in a room and told us that sex was the end all: that one perfect and pure gift you could give once to one person. Sure, they talked it up about how it had to be our choice, don't pledge unless you mean it, all that. But who wanted to be the only one who didn't? And who wanted to...to go against God?”
“So you're really—?” Dean drew a breath, closing his eyes as rebel tears streamed down his face. His voice broke as he tried, “You're okay with this?” He gestured in front of himself. “With—me and...Cas?”
“Yeah, if anyone needs to take a shit,” Dean advises, “just use a log like we've been doing on the trail.” Sam makes a face at that, and Dean raises his eyebrows, asking, “You'd rather fall in?”
Sighing, Castiel turned his gaze out the window. “I think I'd really rather...know where I stand with your family, before I really get attached to the idea of them being
“Well,” Dean said, walking over and snagging his unfinished beer again before flopping down on the couch, “that's why I wished I could be gay.” He took a swallow of beer then gestured with the bottle. “It would simplify a lot of things. But unfortunately I like women too damn much. So I guess the best I could hope for is being bi.”
Dean dropped his gaze. “Just...” His fingertips ghosted over Castiel's wrist and along his fingers. He swallowed. “It's been...a while.”
“Wow,” Sam said.
Shaking his head as well, Dean chuckled softly. “I don't really see how any of this is simple.”
“Well, I did until he didn't want to!” Dean answered, gesturing helplessly with one hand.
“And talked to Kevin,” Dean added with a nod. “But Kevin the genius Bible scholar isn't going to be here tonight, and I doubt arguing is going to be much help.” He sighed. Swallowing, he added, “You and I both know that people can and do change their minds about stuff—specifically about this—but a shouting match over a family dinner isn't the place that's going to happen.”
Castiel's shoulders rose and fell in a small shrug. “I usually say I'm gay for simplicity's sake, but really...I'm a bit...bi, or 'bi-curious'...or 'homo-flexible' or whatever you want to call it. About a five on the Kinsey scale.”
“What?” Dean gaped at Castiel helplessly. “Cas, no. No.” Wincing, he squeezed his eyes shut. “I...I knew I explained things badly, because, you know: drunk.” He looked at Castiel with apologetic eyes. “I just...didn't realize it had been quite that bad.”
where you stood on homosexuality, at least when it came to your own kids, because you
Dean took Castiel's hands in a firm grip, seeking Castiel's gaze. “I have you.” Ducking his head, Dean pressed his lips to Castiel’s hands. With a little shrug he murmured, voice rough, “You’re the best option I could ever ask for.”
Castiel smiled, warm and bright, his eyes shining. “Yes, Dean.” Bringing one of Dean's hands to his lips, he pressed a soft kiss to the back of it then flashed Dean a radiant smile. “I'm saying yes.”
And then he was gone, the sound of the door somehow making the space feel that much more empty. Dean shoved his hands into his pockets, wondering why he felt like he'd done something wrong.
to yourself!” Dean demanded. He gestured towards the house with an open palm. “I mean, God forbid
The beat of Castiel's heart is steady and reassuring under Dean's palm.
Catching Dean's hand, Castiel squeezed it firmly. “But you spent all those years believing his love was conditional. Because he told you it was.”
of losing Castiel again. And what the hell were you even supposed to do when your childhood BFF came back after disappearing without warning for actual years of no contact and said he'd left because he was gay, in love with you, and convinced you were so straight and religious you'd hate him for it?
Clearing his throat, Dean looked away. “All right, uh...” Grimacing, he waved his hand towards the house. “Guess it's probably time we went back in there.”
Dean grimaced, looking away. “I just feel...upset. With my dad, I guess.” He shrugged.
“Oh, Dean.” Castiel ran the fingers of his other hand through Dean's soft hair, the petals of his flower-crown brushing gently against Castiel's skin. “I do like the flowers.”
“But we agreed we're getting married,” Castiel put in.
“Well, I'm open to almost anything,” Dean admitted. “I can't guarantee I'll be any good at much. Well, I'm good at hand-jobs, but what guy isn't? I'm sure that doesn't exactly...set me apart.”
Cas chuckles warmly and rubs his cheek against Dean's shoulder, rough stubble prickling just a little through the material of Dean's shirt. “Good.”
“Sure, text me,” Castiel said, pausing at the door. “Good night.”
“Oh.” Dean winced, lips twisting unhappily. “Yeah.” He cleared his throat. “Guess I didn't actually tell you about Lydia—that was just a few months ago now that she contacted me to let me know she'd had my kid. But that was it—just she had a baby girl, named her Emma. No pics or anything and I haven't heard from her since. Won't even give me an address so I can send gifts for Christmas and birthdays.”
“So let's go back to Cas, then,” Sam suggested.
“But, Dean, you're not gay,” Sam protested.
“Okay, well,” Dean suggests, rubbing at his nose, “since Cas and I are the normal-sized people, we take the bed—assuming we both fit—and the rest of you aberrations Tetris with yourselves on the floor.”
“All right.” Dean swiped at his tears with still-trembling hands. “That's...good—good to know.”
“Dean,” John pressed, folding his arms and leaning against the side of the beat-up pickup. The frayed blue tarp draped to keep the rain out of the missing window fluttered a bit in the breeze. Shaking his head, John looked away into the twilight. “You know, the longer you take to start talking, the angrier I'm gonna get.”
Castiel offered Dean a quiet half-smile. “Might as well.”
Frowning, Dean cleared his throat. “You said you 'had to' move back here.”
“Of course I find you attractive!” Dean snapped, suddenly defensive. “Didn't I just—?” He made a quiet sound of exasperation. “I just said that I was. That I was interested: 'that way'.”
Castiel makes a noncommittal hum. Pressing his nose into Dean's neck he nuzzles a bit into Dean's hair saying, “I suppose we would.”
“Missed you,” Dean said, voice a little rough.
Castiel nodded and worried his lower lip a bit. “There's a lot of...'one foot in the closet' accusations.”
And fuck, now Dean does have a boner. His brother is in the room, for God's sake. Dean tries his damnedest to will it down. Weakly he says, “I'd kinda hoped to go back to sleep.”
Castiel looked up from where he sat on the narrow dusty bunk. The thin excuse for a straw tick would be rather uncomfortable if Castiel had any inclination to sleep that night. “And what have you deduced from that?”
“You could!” Jess agreed, eyes shining like she was already planning out how to place glass candleholders to make artistic pathways in the sand like some Pinterest bullshit.
Damn, there wasn't a day that went by since that fateful moment in the bread aisle at the grocery store that Dean didn't thank God or want to pinch himself or both. They'd been through some less than great stuff since, through Castiel finally admitting why he'd left and Dean being a bit of an asshole himself because he was just
“I'm not sure I've actually met you,” Jess said with a bit of an apologetic smile across the table at Castiel.
“Did I ever say I was bi?” Dean demanded.
“Stuff like...?” Sam prompted.
Dean shrugged. “Well, I've never had any trouble finding women willing to go to bed with me.”
Dean waved a hand. “Don't worry about it. 'Two drink bisexual'; it's a stereotype for a reason, I guess.”
Dean chuckled. “Especially when I'm drunk.” After a beat, he added, “You should, uh, probably know that...there are, um, a few things I've never done. I know I dated a couple of guys, but...there's...stuff. That's going to be new to me. I mean, if you...if you wanted to do it.”
that he liked Castiel's hands, but how the hell did a person manage a compliment of someone's hands without sounding stupid? “I just, um...” Dean floundered. Maybe he could just try to be honest and hope for the best. “I like to—to imagine you running them though my hair. Or just—holding hands. If that was...a thing that we did.”
“That's...understandable,” Castiel said.
Clearing his throat, Castiel shifted a bit in his seat. “So that's why...I've been thinking about this more. I know we agreed from the start that we would never have to have sex. Like we read about on the internet, how some gay Christians do things.”
Crowley shrugged as he offered the second cup of tea to Dean. “Well, I've never seen anything wrong with mixing a little business in with pleasure, or the other way around.” He offered Castiel a small smile. “I find this particular business diverting—a man has to have some entertainment, hmm?”
Castiel tilted his head to the side again. “I always assumed you just wanted to be him, be like him.”
“Well, I...” Dean ducked his head, cheeks heating a little. He had, even while sober, considered this topic a bit too much to be fully comfortable admitting it. “I don't know, Cas.” He worried one of his thumbs with the other. “I mean, who else am I gonna marry?” Grimacing, he pushed on, “Which is why it would help a lot if I was
“Why would you be?” Castiel muttered as he opened the door.
“I swear I'm not offended,” Dean offered with a bit of a grin.
Dean shifted, adjusting his arms across his chest. “I dunno if he ever made me feel 'used'. Unhappy, sure.” Dean scrunched up his face and shifted again. “But I don't wanna talk about him.”
Sam grimaced. “I dunno, try to get his side of things, maybe.”
—” He pointed at Castiel. “—can manage a bit.” He flicked his brows upwards as he poured steaming tea into a cup. “But please do keep it away from my familiars; yours might tolerate it at this point, but they rather would not, I expect.”
Making a quiet sound in his throat, John shrugged and spread his hands. “A man's allowed to change his mind. People do every day.” Shifting his weight, he gestured with one hand. “When you realize you've been wrong, been too harsh, been unreasonable...you correct that.”
“No, no,” Dean says as his cheeks heat. “Uh, I'll be fine.”
need to hear about that.”
“You just happened upon an injured fae?” Edlund asked.
“Yeah,” Dean managed, voice rough. But he was supposed to be telling Castiel how he felt about him, and he didn't think he'd quite got that far yet, for all that things did indeed seem to be better. Maybe this was important. It kind of felt important. “Cas, I...” He winced, biting his lip and caught Castiel's wrist because as much as Dean loved the feeling of Castiel's hand on his face it was distracting and he needed to say this. He stroked Castiel's wrist a little, hoping he didn't feel rejected by Dean pulling the hand away from his face. “I know I'm not...good at this. At any of it. Feelings, talking about them. But, God, Cas, I just... When you're sad, I want to make it better, and when you're angry at me I feel like I can't breathe. When we're apart, I miss you, and the longer it is the worse it gets. When you smile at me, I want to do whatever I can to make you smile like that at me again. I don't think it really matters how bi I am or how gay I'm
And the fact was, for all that John did look a bit heavier he also looked happier and healthier than last Dean had seen him. Maybe he was finally starting to get over Kate leaving. Maybe it was the dinner, everyone here being cordial to each other over pork chops and mashed potatoes. But even the house looked cleaner. Less cluttered, less grungy. Maybe John had just tidied up a bit for Adam or for the family dinner, but it was something.
Leaning a little closer, Castiel rumbled, “I would love to get a hand-job from you, Dean.”
“Dean,” Castiel said, voice deep and rough, “if you're asking me to marry you...”
“Dean,” Sam said, rolling partway onto his side and fixing Dean with a serious gaze. “You need to tell him how you feel about him.”
Rolling his eyes, Dean cut in, “Don't you start.” With a chuckle, he added, “You're worse than Kevin. At least he has the excuse of actually being a certified expert; you've never even been to Bible school.”
Castiel put a gentle hand on Dean's lower back. “Dean?”
Dean's gaze hardened and a muscle twitched in his jaw. “I didn't either, but I needed it.
“Well,” John said, clearing his throat, “I'd be proud to have you as part of the family regardless.”
Finally, Sam rolled partway onto his side again and said, “Dean, you do really want to marry Cas, right?”
“What? Tonight, or...?”
“Oh,” Sam said, raising his brows before his expression morphed into sympathy. “I'm so sorry you had to go through that, Adam.”
remember! That's—the sort of thing you'd think maybe a kid would remember! Right? No kid is looking to get 'disowned' by their own father. I don't think we really knew what it meant, but it sure sounded bad.” Dean rubbed one shaking hand over his mouth. “It sounded a whole lot like 'unwelcome and unaccepted'. So you know what? You don't get to lecture
“Well, that certainly is good news,” John said through the chorus of congratulations.
“It does not,” Benny agrees.
, precisely?”
“A little broth?” Dean tried, picking up the bowl.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Look, just butt out. If the three of you are comfortable and think you can sleep, just get on with it.”
“And he's never reacted in a negative way to that?” Wesson continued.
the best case scenario. “Yeah. Damn, uh.” Dean rubbed at his nose, an embarrassed smile tugging at his features. “I just really...don't want things to be awkward between us.”
“Wh—” Dean shook his head. “Why would you be angry with yourself?”
“Outhouse out back,” Benny says as he comes in followed by drenched and morose versions of Castiel and Kevin. “Though I'm not sure I'd trust it.”
!” Dean jabbed one angry finger at John. “About how I lived the last twenty years knowing
“I didn't think I had to!” John shot back. “It hardly seemed relevant to bring up to my adult sons that oh yeah probably I was wrong this whole time about gay people. Sam was madly in love with Jess already and you were running around chasing every skirt that crossed your path, fathering grandchildren I never get to see...”
, Cas.”
“Oh?” John looked up expectantly.
Sam with his unfairly long legs reaches the door first and opens it, calling out, “Hello? Anyone there?” into the darkness as if it isn't perfectly obvious no one's been here in decades.
“Guess we'd have to, uh, stop talking,” Dean suggests.
Sam raised his brows. “Oh. Well, that's...” He swallowed. “That's good to hear, that you'll be closer.” He offered an encouraging smile. “We should do dinners like this more often.”
Dean focused on not tripping over his own feet as he followed. “Yeah! I mean, uh, they have...sorta manly ones, right?”
“What?” Dean frowned at him. “'Experimental phase'?”
“Huh?” Dean looked up, blinking and wondering vaguely how long he'd been sitting on the edge of their bed just zoning out. He'd managed to get his boots off and had his phone in his hands but the screen was dark.
“Yeah, we...haven't set a date yet,” Dean said, still trembling, “but...yeah.”
Adam sort of shrugged, poking at his food, and mumbled, “Thanks.”
Benny laughs, shaking his head. “Would you take it from me? 'Cause I agree with him.”
“He's my son,” John said firmly. He put a hand on Adam's shoulder. “You don't reject family.”
“We've...read the relevant verses,” Castiel pointed out.
Chuckling, Castiel reached over and gave Dean's knee a squeeze in response. “I think I'd rather take a nap with you.”
Benny chuckles, considering the bed. “About half of me, too, I think.”
Smirking a little, Dean looked away. “Yeah, shut up.” Standing up, he shucked off his shirt and tossed it at the laundry hamper. Pausing, he stared at the blank wall for a moment. “Cas?”
“Shit.” Dean thunked his head back against the wall, because he actually did remember saying that now that Castiel had brought it up. He blew out a breath, exasperated with himself. “Okay, so I was drunk, as we've many times gone over, and—apparently I was just spewing out every single dumb-ass idea I'd ever had even tangentially relating to you and me and marriage. But, Cas. Even if I
Dean shot him a small frown and Adam smirked a bit. “Well, when you stormed off like that...Castiel said...it couldn't be because you were homophobic, because you knew he was gay and were fine with it.”
Dean tried to smile, somehow feeling too jumpy to feel properly relieved. But maybe this
“We already have physical intimacy,” Dean pointed out. “To some degree.” They cuddled all the time. Which, again, not super-straight, if Dean was trying to keep score. When the silence began to stretch out a bit between then, Dean tried to meet Castiel's gaze and offered, “It's nice.”
“Unpleasant,” Castiel supplies. They've currently got all their saddles in a haphazard line along the porch rail, sheltered from the rain. The porch would be dry, certainly, but the smell of horse sweat and damp leather would be rather strong.
Sam nodded. “That's...”
“She's good,” Sam said, nodding and taking another sip of beer. “Work's been really busy but she's excited. Loving it.”
Dean hung his head in defeat. “This is just...the worst, Sammy.”
“It's an unfair stereotype,” Castiel countered.
owe him a favour,” Dean countered, steering Castiel over to the bed and making him sit. “I had no other options—do you think I'd have come to him if I saw some other way?”
