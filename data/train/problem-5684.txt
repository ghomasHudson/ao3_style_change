“Regardless of what childish fantasies you have been feeding, Captain, I’m sure you have heard Tony has a very extensive—and, uh, let’s say varied—list of conquests.” He lets the sweet taste of the wine flood his mouth, slipping it under his tongue before he swallows. “Does that not concern you?”
he says, pulling away merely an inch, his noses still touching, as if he can’t bear to be further apart.
There’s also the sexuality thing, which Tony can only imagine complicates everything a lot further. The sort of thing Tony wants, that he’s been dreaming of – kissing in public, holding hands, spending nights together - just didn’t
It's melted a little on his hand. Steve frowns, turning to the table to get a napkin. He cleans up his palm and takes the tip of his index finger to his mouth, sucking the leftover chocolate.
The fake funeral is a good party, Steve considers. He wasn’t sure about the idea when Bucky first told him, but now, thinking about it, it makes sense. Bucky was tired of being watched, of being followed by undercover reporters secretly waiting for him to go on a murder spree. He wanted the chance to take control of his life once and for all, and the funeral had been his way of doing it. Steve might not fully understand, but seeing the happiness in his face now, as he finds Sam and hugs his waist from behind, it’s impossible for him to be against it.
Silence stretches out between them, instead. Steve watches as Tony’s eyes dart away from him, to the table, to the floor, to the people dancing in front of them, and then back to Steve.
Tony can’t see his face, but he can vaguely assume he’s eating something. There’s a newspaper in his non-metal hand.
“I--” Steve’s voice sounds shaken, and Tony can’t help but look at him. His face is flushed, eyes wide as if Tony said something appalling, jaw clenching. “Tony. That… that wasn’t appropriate.”
“What did I say before? This is for my fun, darling.” He introduces a second finger, making a light scissor motion, and the pressure is just foreign for a moment, almost uncomfortable, as if Stark is really just opening him to get a better look. Tony’s fingernails scratch the back of Steve’s hair and he pulls Steve’s head back, his cock sliding out of his mouth just a few inches, before pushing in again. “You didn’t lie,” Stark breathes, and Steve shivers at the hoarseness in his voice. “So fucking pretty.”
Tony raised his eyebrows, apprehension crawling up in his chest. Of course, nothing about their situation was
Tony thinks, and he’s shocked by the sheer honesty of the thought. He is, at the end of the day, grateful to Steve for stopping him from doing that, stopping his rage from taking him to the point of no return. And he is also fucking mad at Steve, and he also wants to touch him, and fuck, how long is Steve taking on that damn run, anyway?
He’s not even angry anymore. Well, most of the time, at least. It’s just. That’s just how he and Steve work, apparently. It’s foolish to hope for anything else.
Steve blinks, trying to gather his thoughts together. The touch of Tony’s hand is nice, but he yearns for more of the overwhelming feeling from before. “Yeah,” he says. “You’re—you’re both wearing clothes. I think you should… not do that.”
“Hey,” Tony grins, his voice calm. He has done this many times before, Steve reminds himself. It’s nothing new to him.
Right now, though, things have calmed down, and Steve is a little shocked to realize Sam isn’t making a joke, but sincerely asking. Which is ridiculous, because, even in the off-chance of Steve getting…
“No,” Tony replies in a hurry, his hand flying to his pocket, ready to throw the damn phone out of the window if that’s what it takes. “No, it’s okay, I can just—”
Tony nods, slowly. He clasps his hands behind his back. “No worries,” he says. Steve’s eyes dart to his lips - should they kiss? Would kissing be an acceptable way to say goodbye? “I need to find Rhodey, too.”
Tony has never seen him look so peaceful. He associates Steve with an edge of tension, of discomfort – the lingering feel of being out of place, out of time. It was always in his posture, in his gaze, even in his smiles.
“It’s your funeral,” Steve replies blankly. Bucky laughs. It’s a loud laugh, like the ones he used to give before the war. He pushes a beer in Steve’s hand.
Steve took a moment to understand. The thought of Stark’s body enveloped around him - his arm over his waist, his chest against his back – made him shudder. “You, you’d—”
Century, which is a bit surprising, though not much – Steve being Steve, Tony rationalizes, he probably couldn’t want to just go back to the 40s after seeing the social advances the future brought.
“My what?” he says, only now digesting Tony’s words. The corner of Tony’s mouth twists in a lopsided grin.
Steve let out another sob, one that somehow escaped the muffling of the cushion, sounding raw and painful and just straight up
Sleeping inside the dream machine doesn’t work like sleeping in real life. For Tony, it’s almost as if time passes by immediately as soon as he closes his eyes – or, more accurately, he imagines, as soon as Steve does. Either way, when he sees sunlight creeping between the curtains of the bedroom’s window, he doesn’t feel any more rested.
it, damnit, and revealing the choice of his red, tight, and, according to certain tabloids, “characteristically tacky” speedo.
the intel they got with the captured HYDRA members to form future strategies to rally basis, because, as Fury put it, he couldn’t plan battles he wasn’t sure he’d be able to fight yet. Even if it was a matter of
Tony speaks a lot, but Steve forces himself to get a word in, from time to time. It’s a little awkward and Steve wishes he could be more at ease, but he can’t – there’s fire in his chest, curling at every movement of Tony’s body, at every sign of life he emanates.
Which was: Steve never actually got to spill the beans, because Tony, without doing anything that even remotely
“Right,” Steve breathes. He wishes they could kiss. Not a deep, passionate kiss while fumbling with each other’s clothes - just… a kiss, light and chaste, with Tony smiling when they pulled apart. “We’re—we’re pretty late.”
“But I want you to stay,” Tony replies, and right after the words come of his mouth he realizes that, yeah, this is it. This is what he should have said a long time ago.
There were no muddy shoes cluttered by the doors, no guns littered on the tables. The medical journals that Bruce liked to read were gone, along with the trash mags that were housed on the coffee table. Even the atrocious afghan that always managed to find its way back on the couch was gone. The bar had been cleaned, each glass painstakingly placed where it should be, the chairs turned over onto the tables, and all the lights dimmed.
Tony paused for a second, and Steve barely caught the quick flash of remorse dance over Tony’s face before it was gone, replaced by stone. “I can’t,” came the quiet reply, so quiet that Steve wasn’t sure it was meant for him to hear. With that, the helmet closed over Tony and he was gone, blasting off into the sky. People that had started to gather, drawn to arguments like moths to a flame, started to clamber around them, phone appearing to try and catch a picture of Iron Man in flight.
Steve gave the man a weak smile, and Tony couldn’t help but lean down and kiss it as well. “I’m glad you’re alright,” Tony whispered when he pulled away, words only for Steve.
Not waiting another second, Tony swept a leg under Barnes, causing the other man to crumple to the ground. He hopped over him easily, racing back towards his car when he saw The Captain pull out from the shadows, eyes locking onto Tony’s immediately. Tony ran faster, trying to beat the mob boss to his car. He scrambled for his keys in his pockets, sobbing in relief when he saw that he hadn't dropped them. Throwing the door open, Tony jumped in, narrowing missing the bullets that sprayed over his head and broke his windows.
“She said she’ll see you,” the receptionist said, finally hanging the floor up. “Forty-seventh floor,” she said with a gesture to the elevator.
“We have to go into witness protection, but we have to go separately.” Tony watched Steve swallow a lump around his throat. “That means we won’t be together. We can’t.”
Steve woke up alone in his bed. Listening in, he heard his wife making breakfast. He looked down and reread the numbers he had printed on his hand, forcing it into his memory. He closed his eyes. He knew they were coming.
A long silence stretched between the two of them, before he heard Tony snort. "We're both a couple of fucking saps, you know that?"
The Captain finally let his grip lax before pacing away. "Well, what about you? How do I know that you didn't go running to your lackeys about me? How many people know my face now? Maybe I'm the one who won't last the month."
Tony just shrugged. “Na, I think you would. But at least security will know who to be looking for. Now give me your shoe, Barton. You promised to spend the day with me. I’m not gonna let you ditch now so you can continue on your life’s mission of being a bed hermit.”
to decide whether or not its in their best interest of pursuing. HE wasn't going to waste time figuring out if Fury was the type to just write some shit down and send him on his merry way, or be in the minority that actually put on the blue uniform to help people. Fury probably wasn't one of them; those poor blokes get themselves killed too young. “I can’t imagine how much more light I could shed on the situation,” he finally grit out.
“We got a lock,” Tony responded. His inner battle with his status with The Commandos will have to wait for another day.
Steve watched as Fury ambled over to his kitchen table, plopping down in the nearest chair without an invitation. The chair creaked threateningly under the weight, but that was nothing new; the pair of antique seats that were salvaged from a Queens curbside seemed to protest anything over a sack of potatoes.
Pepper returned with an equally charming grin. “A pleasure, Captain. I’m terribly sorry for interrupting. I wasn’t aware Ton-Mr. Stark had a business meeting.”
Tony stared at the other man, completely in shock, trying to find any angle to spin the conversation away from the current collision it was heading for. “Well you’re shit out of luck, I’m afraid. It doesn’t matter what I feel; I can’t help you. I don’t have anything on HYDRA either. They’re gone. I can’t even find them.”
“The cowl, the cowl!” Sam’s hands shot out and pulled the cowl away from Steve’s head, the blonde trying to get a handle on his now ruined hair. Shooting Sam a final thumbs up, Steve took a deep breath before pushing open the sanctuary’s doors, stopping when all heads turned to look at him.
The Skull chuckled, the sinister laugh echoing around his mask. “How do you think he knew so much? How do you think
Steve liked to think of these movements, these reactions, as a personification of Tony’s brain. His thoughts, his ideas. His ingenuity was always flowing, his genius always turning gears.
From the groan that emanated from the smaller man when he looked down at the screen, Steve already knew what it was about. “Pepper?”
Pepper patted his cheek. “Good. I’ll see you tomorrow.” And with that, the redhead and her heels clicked back down the hallway, his son already dozing in her arms.
"You're right," Steve continued. "It's not his usual MO, but HYDRA isn't only making plays against us. They're responible for the bomb that put Hogan in the hospital, as well as the murder of your employees."
“I know! It’s just…I can’t tell him. Not now. With everything happening, I’m sure Tony wouldn’t like the added knowledge that I’m looking for Bucky behind his back.”
By the time Thor was finished, Steve could see the man struggle to hold on to consciousness, his head, moving to each side before flopping down into his chest. Steve gave Thor a nod when the other man looked at him, giving him the go ahead to remove the gag.
“I know exactly who you are, Mr. Stark.” The man walked towards Tony, stopping under the overhead light.
“NO!” Tony cried, yanking his body away from Rogers. “They weren’t your family! They were mine! It was my family, my friends, my
"I'll do what I always do. I'm a business man, Captain. I'm gonna fake it till I make it; get my way out of this with a deal. In fact," Tony eyed the Captain, "I'm sure HYDRA would get off my tail if I brought them you."
Steve flushed at Tony’s words, heat rising to his cheeks. “You decrypt the data we sent you?” Steve asked, quickly changing the subject.
But Steve knew HYDRA. They weren’t in hiding, they were biding their time. Waiting for the right moment to strike. And without any further leads from Rumlow, it seemed they were back to the beginning, left floundering while HYDRA slowly cornered them against a wall. The real question was whether or not they were planning their next move against Stark or against himself.
“Ugh, don’t ask,” Natasha moaned, kicking Steve in the shin as he started to chuckle. She looked up at the pair of them, and for a moment, it was like no time had passed. She knew it wouldn’t last, but was content on grasping it for as long as she could. “Where’s my present that you definitely didn’t forget in the car?”
Tony chuckled to himself as he slipped over to his computer, tapping away to bring up the location. JARVIS brought it up without a single command, and as he reached below the desk, Tony pulled out his padded suitcase that he originally brought the computer in, and slipped the tech and the acquired location inside. He grabbed the suitcase and dragged it back into the office, rummaging through the desk until he found some spare clips from his new,
“Was it really him, Steve? What did he sound like? What kind of mannerisms did he have?” Natasha asked.
Brown eyes trailed down the length of his body, before dragging back up to catch Steve's gaze. Tony whistled. “What a view,” he leered down at Steve.
Steve stood at the end of Tony’s driveway. Minutes ago, he had given Tony one last desperate kiss, and pushed him into Hill’s car. Tony should be long gone by now. Out in the distance, he could see a man in a truck pull up.
It was ridiculous, but Steve didn’t think he had ever been this nervous. Even knowing that, despite Tony’s grumbling he would never say anything bad about what Steve put together. He’d still claim to enjoy it, for Steve’s sake. The thought of that, however, sat worse in Steve’s stomach than rejection. Steve stopped Tony right in front of the fire.
Rogers was up in an instant pointing his gun back at Tony. And that’s when Steve saw it. Just like it had happened before.
“It’s because it’s a code,” answered Tony, walking over to the sign. “Back during the prohibition, discretion was key. People relied on codes and passwords to figure out where the speakeasies were located and when to go.”
the whole dating scene. You love me – well, actually not too sure about that right now – and I love you, so what more do I need?”
Steve looked up, where the lights of the buildings around him were getting swallowed by passing clouds.
Reasons like that were more than enough to call for more layers, maybe even shoes, but Tony couldn’t be bothered. Each morning he’d stumble out in whatever threadbare shirt that he’d collapsed into bed with, ratty pants, and worn socks that started to bear rips and holes from his walk outside from the days before.
Rubbing his eyes, he got up from his musty motel bed, walking over to the far wall. There Clint had tacked on any useful information he had gathered on Operation Brimstone. Which was a whole load of nothing. The packet he picked up in the forest had listed the head dogs of the entire operation, but after a month of searching, Clint had turned up zilch. All he had was a list of names and an old book.
"You," replied Steve grimly. "You're the only connection between each of the attacks. They're after you, Tony."
“But you can relax, mother hen,” Clint continued. “It’s been months, and no one’s suspected anything. I even got the slip on my handler because I have an alibi,” he grinned. “I was at work.”
“That’s just great!” Rhodes shouted, throwing his hands up to the ceiling. “You’re hooking up with him too!”
Steve groaned as he rubbed his forehead, wishing for ancient memories to stop swirling around in his head. This wasn’t the time get nostalgic; his team needed him.
A mop of dirty blonde hair stepped around The Captain, leveling Loki with an icy glare. “That would be me.”
“It doesn’t matter Steve! What kind of team doesn’t account for all of its members?! What if something happened to him, Steve? There could have been others here; they could have taken him! We need to find him, Steve. If anything happened to him because of us, I- ”
Steve couldn’t stop himself. He leaned over and retched, losing his stomach all over the floor, next to the bodies.
They were silent as they redressed, one passing the other their respective clothing. Tony was grateful that Steve didn’t mention anything when he slipped the blonde’s shirt over his head, instead of his own. He watched, nose buried deep in the fabric –
Tony didn’t answer, the man already out of his chair. If it wasn’t Rhodey, there was only one other army man that would come to his office. “Get rid of him, Pep. You can very go well and tell
Tony could probably count on his fingers the number of times that he had been given anything out of love. And after watching Tony cradle the carving against his chest, Steve vowed to get Tony to look that way as much as possible.
Steve sighed heavily and closed his eyes. “Yeah, it’s complicated.” Opening his eyes, he met Tony’s gaze while tightening the grip on his shoulder. “I do trust you, you know.”
Tony sat in the car long minutes after the kids hopped out, retreating back into the house. Just a few simple moments of silence before Wanda and Pietro would no doubt start a fight, or Peter would start crying.
It was a question that plagued him the whole ride home from the press conference. He’d kept secrets in the past. He’d know what to do. But how to get an answer from Steve without giving showing his hand?
Tony was sure that Barnes had no plans of letting anyone in on his little ruse – he’d managed to keep even Steve off his back all these years. But with everything that had happened, there was no way that Barnes could keep up with each blow that came their way. The crew knew for sure, Steve especially, given the way they’d been almost hyper aware of Bucky’s presence, the concern only taking a backseat for Clint’s dire situation. Everything seemed to finally be locking into place these past few days, and Tony was furious that it had taken him this long to catch up.
“Yeah, you’d like it. You can fish, camp, or whatever. I’d even lay out on the beach for you; you said you like to see that, remember?”
Steve’s heart was pounding. There was no way out of this. He had failed his mission. He had failed Tony.
Steve knew that he would never not be in awe of how brilliant Tony really was. He had lost count of all the times that he’d sat next to him, soaking up his genius like a wet sponge, wishing he could catch just a single glimpse into his brain, imagining how he would see an endless cycle of ingenuity, the neurons firing like pistons at Mach speed. Getting frustrated that he could never see the world the way that Tony could.
She darted into the elevator, hitting the button for the third floor. The descent was silent, leaving Natasha alone to her thoughts. She could only pray that there wasn’t anyone waiting for her on the other side. What’s more, she hoped that Pierce was still in the building.
This was the only life they knew, secrets and lies their only comforts. That’s why complete trust was hard to come by. Each of The Commandos had had a lifetime of constantly watching their backs because they half expected their coworkers to stab them in the back. You couldn’t get mad at the guy next to you for lying when you were doing the same thing; because of it, however, trust was never an option. It wasn’t until The Commandos were formed that Bucky found how wrong he was.
It used to satisfy him. That was, until he went to Afghanistan. He lost count of the times he found himself standing outside, head tilted back, mouth open wide, gaping like a fish. They all looked the same to him, but he could never find it in him to get bored, or to look away. He didn’t think he’d ever looked up more than when he was on tour. He sure as hell didn’t do it when he was at home. In fact, it was one of the easiest ways to tell the difference between a local and a tourist. Tourists look up; New Yorkers don’t. There was nothing up there of worth. No stars, just artificial lights; reminders of the millions who were also stuck in the concrete jungle, and looming buildings that, after a while, all start to look the same.
Tony quickly snatched an orange from the shelf and lobbed it towards the family. The fruit was right on target; it crashed right into a display of canned green beans, the cans going flying in each direction.
He knew then that she wasn’t talking about combat. They’d lost his father to the bottom of a bottle, not a bullet. Most soldiers don’t die from the war, they die from what comes after. And that had terrified his mother.
Tony’s eyes widened slightly, not missing the way Coulson’s lip twitched in a small smile as he saw that Tony realized where he’d heard that before.
Hill stood up with another fake smile. “Half of the city is out looking for these men. They’re dangerous; killers. If you see anything, you know who to call.” With that, Hill gave Tony a last nod, and headed out the door.
It was whispered so softly, Tony could barely hear it over the dancing flames that their small fire emitted. He leaned forward, starting the struggle to open his robe when a gentle hand lay on his shoulder.
“And isn’t that what you’ve already done?” Bucky questioned. “If Fury’s so smart, then how the hell did you get here without raising any red flags?”
The Captain must have gotten the notification, assuming that he and his men should be able to take on Hammer’s mediocre firepower. Keyword: should. Tony had told him it would be safe.
“I’m already in overdrive, what else do you want me to do! I may be a genius but even I have my limits.”
It was pitch dark out, the grassy area that Tony stepped out into not having almost no lighting. He walked a bit further, only to trip over a huge rock. Pain flared up his entire side, his injuries from the fire remaking themselves known. Tony stood up, grumbling, and turned around to be met with a gravestone.
While on any other day, Steve would be impressed, he ignored it, pushing forward, tucking his gun in his belt as he started to hop down the ladder and into the sewer. His eyes watered as the smell hit him, but Steve pressed on.
“Pietro, you’re an incredibly competitive boy and a bit of a show off. Which usually, any trait you get from me should be cherished, but it’s only going to end badly.
The reaction was immediate. As well it should have been. Steve had drilled protocols into their heads.
That was until he heard the sound of quiet breathing coming from the living room. Tucking into a defensive position, Steve reared, ready to attack when-
His chest clenched, like it had been doing in a more consistent pattern, upon thinking about the newest team member. He never thought a Stark of all people would manage to shoulder his way into his heart. In his defense, he sort of had a reputation for clashing with the people he would later consider his family. Hell, even Steve just about broke his nose when the two had first stumbled into each other all those years ago.
The handle jiggled again before the door swung open. Tony darted behind the doorway, head peeking out just slightly from behind the wall.
Steve startled, turning around to face Natasha, taken aback by her response. “Nat,” he started, giving her a glare, but she ignored him, looking back at Fury.
“Terribly well balanced, isn’t it? It’s all in the swing,” he heard Thor say next to him. Steve swung a few more times, clipping his collarbone and ribs, each thudding noise satisfying Steve’s rage. It wasn’t long before Steve dropped the hammer and resorted to his fists, his eyes closing as he blindly hit the helpless man beneath him, the only thing running through his mind was the way his hands looked in Stark and Clint’s blood. With one final knee to the ribs, Steve stepped back, running a hand through his hair, trying to get a handle on his racing pulse and pounding heart.
Tony took a deep breath and leaped over their cover, glowering at Obie. “There you are, you little rat,” he hissed, charging at Tony. Tony sprinted to the left, barely dodging a blast that landed behind him. He barely caught Clint dart the other way, running towards Tony’s other dropped gauntlet. Fate must have had it out for him because all of a sudden he was tripping over a piece of fallen ceiling careening to the ground. He scrambled to get up, but then Stane was there, delivering a sharp kick to his ribs.
“But-but I saw him die! There was a remote, and-and The Suit was there! I didn’t kill him in time. I killed Tony. It was my fault.” Clint broke off into sobs, caught in the dark memory.
“I thought about that, but no. Trust me, we’d be able to tell if someone else had been digging into their bodies.”
Well, Tony was going to kill him anyway. Clint had accepted the fact that he was already on everyone’s shit list, and probably will be for all eternity. He hadn’t even called Laura yet. That was one conversation that he was not looking forward too.
“Oh, God, Stevie’s gonna kill me,” Barnes whined behind him. Tony tried not to pay attention, but even he couldn’t ignore the ringing of his own phone. He looked over to where he had it sitting on the lab bench and looked back at Barnes, jerking his head back towards the ringing device, giving his permission for the other man to answer.
“You are somethin’ else,” Steve laughed, shaking his head in disbelief. His eyes were bright when they looked back up at her. “You gonna let us in?”
Another century passed by the time Tony bottomed out, but he found he didn’t mind. The dull aches had receded, leaving only the satisfied feeling of being full of Steve. If fact, meeting Steve’s groin was almost a disappointment, Tony immediately shifting upwards to start the process over again. He wished he had Steve’s patience, but it was like there was an itch he couldn’t stretch, and it wasn’t long before Tony had a steady rhythm, bouncing on Steve’s cock.
“Some random guy comes in to the station claiming that Tony Stark is missing. You think they’re going to accept that without asking questions? They’re going to want to know how you know, what your connection is to Tony, and where you were when he was missing. We have no cover story for you. How long before they match you with Joseph Grant?”
“Everyone here?” The Captain’s voice caused Tony to stir, finally taking in the rest of the room. He was happy to find out that Bruce Banner had been one to sit next to Tony, offering him a small smile when their eyes met. Spread around them were the rest of The Commandos, each in a different state of disarray; no doubt they had already heard what had happened. Odinson was leaning against the back wall with a stern face that Tony had never seen before. Barnes was seated next to The Captain, but was leaning away, most likely still licking his wounds from their earlier encounter. The brunette seemed to be blatantly ignoring the heavy looks he was being sent from Romanoff, but Tony couldn’t blame him. He didn’t think he could survive a look like that. Someone must have roused Barton, because he was there, sitting quietly with a lot more color than the last time Tony had seen him. The officer, Coulson, was there, and seriously, who let him in? The man was still in full uniform, gun and everything, and no one even looked at him twice. He was squished next to Barton, a blank look adorning his face, and an arm thrown protectively over the-
“And as soon as he so as much opens his mouth, put a bullet through his brain. That will send a message.”
Tony nodded, following Obie as the man got up from the bar, heading towards the door. “I’ll get you something.”
The Captain jostled against the hard bench, the book he was sketching in sent flying to the ground. “What the hell are you doing here?” he asked, his shining blue eyes opened wide, glistening in the sunlight.
for making that deal with Fury. How could they? Could they not see that even if HYDRA didn’t kill them, this would?
Tony put his hands up defensively. “Easy, killer. They don’t know anything more than the general public knows. I may be reckless but I’m not a complete idiot. I’m not bringing anyone else in unless we agree on it, pinky promise.”
Steve sighed, shuffling under the covers as he stretched his arm out to Tony’s side of the bed. It was cold, undisturbed – the way it had remained all night.
“No, Pep. This thing isn’t for two months, so how about we talk about it in, oh I don’t know, two months? I’ve got more pressing matters than- oh.”
Tony felt Steve’s arms tighten around him, frozen in place as blue light finally started to dance around in Steve’s eyes. “Oh my God,” the blonde moaned, fear etched clearly on his face.
“Go back to bed, Stark,” replied Barnes. “Eat a tub of ice cream and cry over a rom-com, or whatever you usually do on your days off. Just relax. I’ll send Steve up to entertain you in a little while.”
But, Tony got up and pushed on. “BARNES! JAMES BARNES!” he shouted, breaking off into hacking coughs. Tony tried to follow the clearest path to where he Barnes was last, crying out in relief when he finally saw a familiar body through the haze.
“I know I’m asking too much. But I need to ask it anyway, because I know that somewhere in that thick head of yours, you know I’m right. I’ll be as safe as I can be with The Commandos. Letting Tony Stark go on a rampage could ruin us all.”
Loki rolled his eyes. “The bomb at his business meeting, the bodies at his front door. You didn’t think they would stop now that your dear Anthony has left you, did you? HYDRA wants him dead as well.”
“I knew it,” Steve sneered. Inside, his head was pounding. Tony was Iron Man. Or was going to be. Tony was the mass murderer. Steve’s heart throbbed. But it couldn’t be Tony, not the Tony he knew. Steve put his hands into his head.
he thought as he surveyed his work. The bolt was half hanging off the wall already; a few more stabs with the knife and he’d be good to go. Loki rolled up his sleeves before getting to work.
So, that meant long and lonely nights in the lab, suffering in his terrors alone. But he would do it. For Steve. It didn’t matter what Natasha thought. What the rest of the team thought.
He hadn’t left his lab again; he knew that it was going to be a bad night. He didn’t want to be a danger to Steve or the team.
“Dead. There are manual overrides, here.” Tony showed them to Clint, helping the archer take each piece off. Finally, Tony was free, grabbing the assisting hand from Clint to stand back up.
“A true gentlemen,” Tony huffed, running back to the stairs. “When you catch up with me, try and avoid hitting the face, yeah? It’s my best feature.”
Steve huffed fondly, smiling at the brunette sitting across from him. “Not what I was thinking, but I’ll keep that one of the back burner, okay?”
Steve looked around. He had survived. He pulled out his watch, opening it to look at a picture of his wife. He stroked the picture gently, and then looked back up at the time machine.
he thought to himself. The phone offered more than relief; it offered the chance for healing, and Clint wouldn’t miss this chance for anything.
Natasha ignored the voice and assembled it in silence. She cut in half before bringing it over to the kitchen table and glaring down at the sandwich that looked as sad as she felt. Taking a bite was just as unsatisfying. Natasha threw it back down on the plate, gaze shifting to the refrigerator, where she knew she had a bottle of wine chilling. She’d barely put her hand on the fridge handle before shouts sounded from the other side of her door, in the hallway.
Tony swung the door open, quickly bringing him and his chair to the other side. He could see The Captain pushing himself up to chase him, but Tony hastily slammed the door shut, jamming his chair under the doorknob to prevent his captor from opening it.
Tony sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. He didn’t care. He absolutely did not care that Rogers was basically taking on a suicide mission. Nope. Not at all. “Good for him.”
Steve’s heart stopped. Tony never talked about Stane and Steve never asked. Steve had a general understanding of what happened in Afghanistan, but it wasn’t until late into their friendship that Tony had come in and thrust the file into Steve’s hands.
If they wanted something done, they did it. There was no half-assing, there was no convoluted bullshit or maybes. Steve was a straight forward guy and his mission was always clear cut. But it was always ever changing. Eradicating HYDRA and keeping Brooklyn in line was their main goal, but Steve never pushed any idea off to the side. If Sam brought him a dirty cop, if Clint showed up with whispers of domestic abuse, hell, if Natasha mentioned a grocery store clerk rubbed her the wrong way, Steve would drop everything and take care of it.
“Steve,” Natasha whispered, pointing back over to the pile of their fallen comrades. Red lights, blinking in time to the beeps, bled through the spaced between the bodies.
The Captain didn’t budge. “I know you have files compiled on every big time mob in New York. That makes you the expert here, so I’m gonna ask again. What do you think?”
Tony nodded, shifting the kittens into one arm so he could scratch gently at one head with the other. “JARVIS hasn’t sensed the mom yet, but at least these three didn’t end up like pancakes today,” he said with a smile. One of the kittens started to paw over their eyes. “Looks like I’m not the only one who need a shower, huh?” Tony continued gently, talking now only to the cats. “Let’s get you out of here. J, where’s the nearest shelter? Time to get you three cleaned up for your mama.” And with that Tony sauntered out of the collapsed building, right past Steve and Bucky wearing equally dumbstruck faces, seemingly without a care in the world.
Steve shot her another searching look, trying to decipher her. “Is that what you think? Did we make the wrong call here?”
“No deal? You said yourself you need those secrets, and I’m giving you me! What more could you want?”
“God, not now,” Steve groaned. “If you’re going to do this, please, just do it outside. I’m not sure what’ll kill me first: this headache, or you two.”
She placed a packet in his hands. It looked almost innocent, small even. Hill was right; if Project Insight was a complete success, Steve would be reading a book rather than a small pamphlet. He did save a lot of people. But there were still victims typed onto the pages. There were still people that didn’t come home.
“I was waiting on you, Captain,” answered Thor. “I have been told there is power in numbers,” he said with a beaming smile.
“Someone broke into their house, Mr. Pierce,” Steve replied evenly, trying to calm the man down. “Their policy clearly covers- ”
“Oh my God,” Steve moaned. “It makes so much sense. They snagged me and Tony off the street after I picked him up from the office the night before. They must have followed us from the office. It’s probably how they were able to locate and kill those SI employees earlier this month as well. You have a mole.”
Sitting next to Steve and talking to him soon became routine, just as routine as checking on his chart first thing in the morning when Tony saw him. Hearing stories about his life, his aspirations, and his hopes. Getting to know little facts about him like his favorite color being sky blue and that he loved to draw since he was young and had sketchbooks upon sketchbooks of the Avengers, especially Cap and Iron Man. Steve was the kind of man that could make Tony laugh.
When Steve and Bucky walked into their new dorm room, Steve had expected to be ignored by their third roommate in favor of Bucky. Most people assumed that Bucky was the one who called the shots in their friendship anyway, never mind that the one who was always picking fights and couldn’t keep his mouth shut was Steve, but their new roommate wasn’t like everyone else. Sam saw both Bucky and Steve. He joked with them both and it felt easy. Like they had been doing this their entire lives as opposed to only a few minutes.
“I don’t think I would die for them but I don’t think I would tell them.” Stephen answered and Tony nodded while not completely understanding the thought process. It would just be so much easier to tell the other person.
Eventually he gives in and shoots the Captain a text or who he figures has to be the Captain because there's only one phone number saved on the phone he was given. The phone rings two times before the call connects with a click and Tony hears the familiar voice.
“Plus they have pictures of all their writers at the bottom of the articles. Yours is a very good picture.”
Because it turns out that Tony's growing closeness with the Captain hadn't gone unnoticed. If the quiet footsteps trailing him near constantly was anything to go by. Every time that Tony would turn around to see who was following him though he would find nothing out of the ordinary. Just his fellow New Yorkers going about their days but he could feel the presence.
“I guess you pass muster Laufeyson. Go for it. Now, let’s see…how can our resident tech billionaire disappoint us today? I’m expecting actual updates Stark. None of your usual bull that you’re ‘researching.’” Fury continues and focuses his dreaded one eyed stare on Tony.
“Everyone does seem to be talking about that lately. One of my contacts mentioned that there are ongoing discussions in certain committees about potentially trying to address the issue through legislation but we all know that’ll take years. People are going to keep dying in the meantime.” Loki said with all the nonchalance that never ceased to surprise Tony. It was clear why Loki was the main reporter on the politics beat in their office.
Tony had managed to find a real life superhero, had managed to constantly himself in need of saving despite the fact he wasn’t actually that helpless, and had somehow in spite of everything had also managed to fall in love with a man that he didn’t even truly know. He knew it was stupid but by god was he really unable to stop himself from doing so. Because the things that he did know about the Captain were such good things. They were the sort of things that he wanted in a partner.
“Can you just stay with me for a while and talk to me? No one has come to visit me since I got here and I’m feeling a little lonely.”
“There’s still time for you to get the surgery. If we wait much longer the damage to your other organs will become irreparable. I highly recommend you take this choice into consideration Steve otherwise as ominous as this sounds the end is very near,” Rhodey said while checking the results of the tests they’d run on Steve earlier that morning.
“Aww Stevie you soft hearted sucker.” Bucky mumbled as he pressed into Natasha for a second more before standing up slowly.
“Oh. Well yeah I do know that stuff about her. But that’s stuff you know too because you’re her friend. What’s your point?” Bucky turned to look at Steve with a raised eyebrow.
The night of the text messages and his first set of blossoms was not Steve’s final night. While Tony had used his position to sneak in and see Steve, it hadn’t been his last night. Regardless of that he’d stayed with him like he asked and watched over him as he suffered through the night. There had been more days to spend by his side. Days where Tony had seen what seemed like countless rose petals leak from the blonde’s lips. It was a wonder how he hadn’t managed to drown in them yet. He was far too resilient to let his one-sided love kill him off so easily but even his resilience was running out.
He wouldn’t think about the fact that Carol reminded him an awful lot of Pepper. Never mind the fact that Tony hadn’t always felt comfortable around Carol because of the similarity in the situation. Rhodey was better suited for comforting that particular patient anyway. That’s what mattered and what would allow Tony to feel less guilty.
“You know? Didn’t get the best grade on it but my classmates really liked it. And who actually cares what their stuffy professors have to say on their work?”
At a certain point in every patient’s life, no matter what their original decision had been, Rhodey offered them the way out through the surgery. He made the offer while there was still hope for recovery from the surgery with a high likelihood of no further complications. The fact Steve had gotten to this point made Tony rather afraid. There would be no turning back soon and Tony wasn’t sure if he was ready to face that.
was Tony’s boyfriend. The engineering major found it amusing but it always made Steve slightly sad that Tony wasn't bothered, that Tony was used to people being so fake with him.
"I'm starting to think that you're looking for trouble." The Captain murmured with amusement as he dismantled the cuffs that had been keeping Tony from escaping.
“I love how competent this woman is.” Bucky muttered as he rose from his seat to help the redhead with the encryption.
“You’ll never get this flash drive!” The man growls and the Captain resists the urge to roll his eyes mid battle. This was ridiculous and the only reason he hadn’t already knocked the guy out was the fear of breaking the flash drive and giving his mission partner enough time to swipe the information that they needed.
It really wasn’t his fault that other people couldn’t handle the truth. Just because Tesla had threatened to sue hadn’t meant Tony was going to stop. Case in point he’d called in the Stark Industry lawyers to handle the issue so The Avenger lawyers wouldn’t even need to be worried. They had enough on their plate between Loki Laufeyson and Stephen Strange’s articles on politics and medicine respectively.
“It just feels like I don’t sometimes Buck. Tony knows me so well. He can anticipate what I’m going to say or how I’m going to feel. He knows the things I like and he never gets me things I don’t like. But sometimes when I give him things I somehow miss the mark. Or I end up catching myself because what I’m about to say to Tony isn’t something he’d like and I know that.”
“Hold still.” Comes a deep pleasant voice before the ropes holding Tony’s wrists behind his back loosen enough for him to slip free. Tony turned his head and met the Captain’s eyes. They’re the clearest blue eyes he’s ever seen. It’s honestly very distracting.
Yelena’s information was swift. She had clearly called in favors as soon as Natasha called regarding Hydra’s base in New York. They’d gotten distracted trying to clear other sources of trouble in the city and hadn’t focused on their original mission. But with Tony in danger, Steve turned all their focus on dismantling Hydra so they could find the other man. It had been days since he’d received the call and they were no closer to figuring out where he’d been.
"I prefer the first option honey." Tony murmured while setting down the coffee mug and carafe on the nearest counter. Tony moved over to Steve and wrapped his arms around the blond's neck to pull the man down for a soft kiss.
Tony huffed but pulled himself onto the window ledge before throwing a leg over it to get out the window. As Tony was pulling himself through the window, the door to the room bursts open and the Captain is soon trapped in a fight against five other men. Tony watches from his perch on the window with half his body out the window. It would be amusing if not for the fact that he was being rescued from being captured for too much curiosity.
. Tony was beautiful and lovable and so alluring. There was no one more perfect than Tony Stark in Steve’s eyes and there would never be anyone better than him. Steve was fully prepared to spend the rest of his life making that wonderful genius of a man as happy as he could possibly be because that was what Tony deserved.
The thug’s friends have joined the fight but the Widow is holding her own, dodging and swiping at the enemy with quick jabs that has them leaping away from her in fear. It seems like the thugs have forgotten that they’ve got guns at their disposal since they’re trying to take the Widow down with their fists.
“Well now that Van Dyne has put you all to shame again. Who is next? Hmm…politics? What do you have for me?”
“Dirty and tired babe. Did Steve make dinner, or did we miss that?” Sam replied and fell against Natasha on her other side.
Maybe being surrounded by all those sharp looking knitting needles had turned the ladies running the store into willing participants in the New York drug trafficking scene. Or maybe the ladies just liked a high as much as the next addict whether it be for cocaine or money. Tony wasn’t quite sure with them.
“Okay I get that but also I would like to submit for the jury: we live in New York. The New York Times is right there. Good reporting is in our city's blood, Pep.”
know a lot about Tony. It was just that by comparison Steve didn’t know nearly as much about Tony as Tony did about Steve.
“Now everyone here wouldn’t be in this situation if it weren't for the shorty.” The burliest of the men said while he paced back and forth in front of the hostages with a gun loosely clutched in his left hand. His friends were hanging back in the edges of the room. He stopped right in front of Tony for a second and stared him down before resuming his pacing in front of the other hostages. He seemed to be holding the gun more for the effect of scaring his hostages than for actual protection.
“Good. We’ll get the hostages out of here and take care of the rest. Winter, Falcon get the hostages out of here. Widow and I will take care of any remaining thugs.” The Captain responds.
Tony coughed up an entire vine of blood covered wisteria in his bathroom at home after getting the news via text from Rhodey.
, and all the other big bads that they seem to constantly be butting heads with. Still that being said, sending a soldier to do a journalist’s job? That’s just not how that works and we both know that’s the case. I have to be the one to get the information about them.”
“I’d definitely like something for the pain and maybe something light to stomach. I don’t think I can handle solid foods right now,” Steve murmured quietly from where he was reclining in his sheets. He was just a shade darker than the sheets he was unconsciously clutching onto and Tony knew the signs of a bad turn coming and coming fast.
Steve, like Charles, was in love with someone and suffering the consequences of that and Tony was interacting with him as if he was simply a guy he was getting to know. He was acting like Steve was a potential partner in some distant future. When he’d taken a wrong turn onto the wrong path he didn’t know but Steve had certainly just reminded him of how unavailable he was.
Tony moved to his fridge to pull out his favorite creamer, fumbling with his phone before catching it just before it clattered to the ground. The silence on the other side let him know that Rhodey hadn’t missed the clumsy moment. Tony cleared his throat before responding to his friend.
“Your chart was updated five times last night. You threw up three times and had two coughing fits. Your condition is progressing quite rapidly. I’m sorry to say this Steve but you won’t be able to go home now. Constant vigilance is now vital to your health. I’ll have to speak with Doctor Rhodes to see what we can prescribe you. We definitely can’t suppress the cough but we can give you something for the pain,” Tony said while going through his routine checkup and making updates to the medical chart.
They turned to smile at their clearly overwhelmed barista and ordered their drinks quickly before paying and leaving a huge tip.
“It’s not my fault the suit was so interesting and while good could’ve been better. Plus that was one time. I’m always on time otherwise!”
“I know all of that. That doesn’t change the fact that I wish it wouldn’t have to be this way, especially for Carol’s sake. Hanahaki is awful,” Rhodey said in a tone that always left Tony in an awkward place. It frustrated him that Rhodey continued to buy into that bullshit mentality that wishful thinking could actually make anything better, the media and society loved to push this idea, as ridiculous as it was, and yet it was understandable. It was relatable. Tony sometimes fell into the trap.
“Yeah, yeah I’m good.” Tony responds and gets up from his seat to move away from the escalating fight in front of him. The other hostages follow Tony’s example and move behind the Captain and Winter Soldier quietly, clearly shaken. Tony’s attention is drawn back to the fight unfolding before them.
Tony was tossed into a small room without preamble a few hours later. It was just three grey walls and a set of bars that no matter how much he tried he wouldn’t be able to squeeze through. His belongings had been taken and he’d been left with just the clothes on his back. The lights in the cell were dim and the air in that room seemed harder to breathe.
And it kept the flower petals at bay when he got to see the Captain more often as if his body thought that his continued presence in Tony's life was an indirect way of him accepting Tony's affections. It was a bandage on a knife wound but he'd take it.
And somehow years had gone by and Steve hadn’t noticed. He’d been so wrapped up in Tony and the way they seemed to compliment each other. The way they seemed to just fit together. Steve had started to plan his future with Tony in mind. He’d started thinking about Tony when he was making decisions because the other man’s opinion was important to him.
Because that’s what they were, friends, even if Tony didn’t really know anything personal about the Captain the generic pop quiz kind of way. The fact they were friends was something that Tony both loved and hated because on the one hand it made him someone special to the Captain but on the other hand he was just a friend. He wasn’t a lover, he wasn’t a partner, he was just a friend.
The Widow dropped down silently behind the man with the drive and met the Captain’s eyes. She nodded subtly and he pushed the man back again with the shield into her waiting arms. She quickly jumped up on the man’s back, wrapped her legs around his waist, and maneuvered the man onto the floor before the man completely realized what was happening. She knocked the man out and retrieved the drive, slipping it into one of her belt pockets.
From that moment they had become inseparable. They did everything together because Bucky had quickly learned that if left to his own devices, well Steve was likely to end up picking a fight with someone. It was just the way that Steve said things. It made other people mad. As they grew older and learned more about how shitty people could be well the more Bucky had become a solid presence in Steve’s life.
He clutched the other man closer as he heard gunshots coming from Natasha’s direction and briefly let go of Tony with one hand to reach for the shield with his right hand. He would protect Tony and keep him safe.
No one had reported on Tony’s disappearance either. The man had once told Steve that sometimes he’d go on writing binges for days and his coworkers knew not to worry. So it was on Steve to save him. Because no one else was going to notice something was wrong until it was far too late.
The next time that the Captain saved Tony wasn't even on purpose. Tony was chasing up a lead on another story he was working and just so happened to be crossing the street in the middle of a crazy motorcycle chase through the streets of Manhattan (which by the way was ridiculous because for crying out loud they're in Manhattan where there's negative road space) and had to be literally yanked out of the way by the Captain to avoid being run over.
Tony had cleaned up plenty of Steve’s pink petals when he was dozing after a particularly bad episode. He had once picked up an entire pink rose from a pile of vomit, and while he hadn’t been with him during the episode, he’d still been there after to clean up. The rose had been a beautiful shade of pink and awfully thorn ridden that Tony was honestly surprised Steve hadn’t vomited up a ridiculous amount of blood as the rose tore its way through him.
It almost made Steve forget about the weird limbo they’d fallen into a couple. One they couldn’t even really break out of because they never really had time to themselves to figure out what was happening. Why they were falling apart.
“They’re on the move. Seems like New York is the new base of operations. Only makes sense to follow from a distance. Time for you and Bucky to go home.” Natasha murmured and Steve hummed quietly. If Yelena’s intel was right (and when was it not?), then New York was their next stop.
The two vigilantes looked down at their unconscious opponent one more time before nodding to each other and slipping out of the lab.
“Start packing Rogers. We need to get going. Yelena has coordinated a flight for us and provided us with the identification to get into the country. I’ll take care of the rest when we get there.” Natasha ordered. She had moved to the computers they’d set up and was beginning the arduous process encrypting all their intel.
Steve was the kind of person that one couldn’t help but like. It made Tony wonder which lucky girl had won his heart and what kind of person she was because she clearly didn’t return the love. If Tony believed in love, well,  he’d want it from someone like Steve. Someone who could be kind, caring, and all other sorts of positive things that could brighten up his otherwise dismal life.
“Mmm. I’m currently focusing on a small series of articles on the rising Hanahaki fatalities. Fury insisted that I write something to address it. Something about despite my arrogant nature I have a pretty good ability to explain complicated medical issues simply.” Stephen responded and took a long slurp of his strong coffee.
"It's so good. I'm gonna drink the whole pot and then you're gonna make more babe." Tony said and proceeded to refill his mug with the carafe he'd grabbed a few seconds ago.
“I just wanted to know if you came to the store often to get your fix for knitting! I didn’t actually think that was some sort of code for your top secret drug smuggling operation. Which by the way is incredibly messed up of you. We already have a major drug problem in the US. We don’t actually need to exacerbate the situation more with situations like these. I’m just saying, maybe consider that.”
“Keep it in your pants for now Barnes. How about we start on the weapons while they handle the tech?” Sam said after setting down the snacks on the table and turning away from their resident super spies to help Steve with packing.
“You’d never do that Rogers. You love me too much.” Bucky replied with a grin as he pats Steve’s shoulder on his way to the bathroom.
, how are you faring?” Natasha continued with a warmth in her voice that was only reserved for her closest people.
He loved his friends, his family if he was being honest, but by god did they test him. They were obnoxious.
And later when they were out of this situation and safe again, he would tell Tony the whole truth and hope the other man wouldn’t hate him for lying to him for so long.
What a jerk. No one needed to have their safety so blatantly disregarded like that. God but he really hated hostage situations. They were not nearly as interesting in reality as they seemed in the movies. Definitely lack luster or maybe that was just the people who had taken him hostage.
As soon as the front door shut behind him, the torrent of tears wouldn’t let up as Steve headed for the stairs. Steve hoped Tony was okay because it wasn’t his place to care for him anymore.
“Thank you, Doctor,” he replied and even his voice sounded pleasant. It would just be Tony’s luck that the first man in a while to draw his attention was a patient.
“Sometimes but honestly most of the time I don’t. I rather think about the here and now. There’s so much to experience in the present that I rather not waste my time thinking about the future. Unless I really have to. Like what you and I can do together.”
“Well, I don’t know if I’d be very partial to a billionaire owning my work. That would be kind of strange considering at one point I did a painting that was basically the physical manifestation of ‘
gets brought up or not. It worked. You should be happy you didn’t have to watch your friend die.” Tony replied rather bluntly and the doctor beside him sighed but Tony knew he’d seen reason.
And that last message left him wondering just what exactly he was doing because his actions were not those of a man simply friends with another man. The message was like a bucket of cold water. It was clarity.
“I’m saying we can’t be together. I know in the long run that I’ll probably need to make an advantageous decision when it comes to my partner and...I love you. Please don’t think that I don’t because I love you so much and if I could just run away with you then I would but I can’t Steve.”
This was the sixth time that he'd been rescued by New York's vigilante heartthrob because at this point everyone both knew about the Captain and adored him for the work he did to keep them safe.
Tony nodded and then watched as the Widow on a sleek motorcycle seemingly appeared out of nowhere beside the Captain before he wrapped himself around her to take off after the other people in the chase.
“Mr. Rogers I wish I could say it’s a pleasure to meet you but these circumstances aren’t the best are they?” Rhodey said as he moved towards the foot of the bed where Steve’s most up to date chart was hanging. “I’m Doctor Rhodes and this is Nurse Stark. We’ll be your regular team so if there’s anything you need by all means come to us first. Everyone is here to help you but we’re personally assigned to you.”
A contentious subject given that ultimately vigilantes were people who would rather take the law into their own hands than let the system handle it the way it was supposed to be done. But Tony understood why the Captain felt he had to do it. Despite it not being Tony’s usual beat, he knew how corrupt New York had always been and how that corruption had only cemented itself more and more as the years went on. So someone feeling like they had no choice but step up to fight the corruption? Well that was the origin story of how many superheroes? Practically all of them if Tony was honest.
“Uh huh. That’s the only reason that caption bothers you? It’s not the massive crushes you have on both the Captain and the Widow?” She teases and moves forward in the line. Slowly but surely, they’re moving towards the front of the line.
But Steve didn’t want to say anything because if he did he feared that Tony would blame himself completely even if they were both responsible for the state of their relationship.
“The entrance should be just up ahead. I’ll open the doors for you.” Bucky’s voice came through over the comms and Steve hummed quietly as they reached the doors. A few seconds later the doors slide open with the hiss of pressurized doors.
Tony was the best boyfriend Steve had ever had. Not that he’d had that many, just two before Tony, but he was the best one. He was thoughtful and considerate. The sort of person who wanted to put Steve’s happiness above all else and apart from Bucky and his Ma, Steve had never really had that. He wasn’t used to people thinking about ways to make him happy. But Tony thought about it all the time and did everything he could to make it happen.
“They do?” Rhodey asked and Carol nodded before breaking out into a soft laugh that betrayed how she really felt despite the bright expression still lighting up her face.
For some reason his coffee machine was not doing what he wanted it to do. Maybe he’d spend his Saturday taking it apart and putting it back together to work better. Sometimes Tony regretted switching from mechanical engineering to journalism. Howard would’ve been much more willing to give Tony access to the labs of R&D if Tony had graduated as an engineer.
He released four other prisoners before reaching a cell that smelled sickly sweet of flowers. He peered in to find piles of bloody blue flowers littering the small cell floor and amidst the piles he found Tony. His body was moving before he completely realized what he was doing. Steve’s hands gripped the metal bars of the cell and he strained his muscles pulling it off the hinges. The metal groaned but gave way under his strength and he rushed into the room.
Despite all the odds to Tony that someone was the Captain. The Captain had earned his affections. He wasn’t concerned with Tony’s lineage or his heritage, and if he was then he had done a fine job of making Tony feel like that wasn’t the case. Tony didn’t think that the Captain had done anything in an effort to win him over like that though. The Captain didn't seem like the sort who wanted to take advantage of Tony. No he seemed like he wanted to be there for Tony and he seemed like the sort of person who would do that for any of his friends.
Steve had never expected Tony to be the one to start the dreaded conversation about their relationship.
the situation more: you or the situation itself.” The man mocks and Tony couldn't help but roll his eyes at the words. Really did anyone actually listen to him when he talked?
It wasn’t surprising, New York was especially volatile these days. People were just trying to do whatever it took to survive.
“And the two measly guards they had watching this part of the house have probably gotten around to calling in back up by now. So out the window before they get here.”
“We have Charles, Clint, Carol, and a new patient named Steve Rogers.” He responded while handing over the file of the new patient. Rhodey took it with a nod and began looking at the charts of their newest admit.  Tony had already reviewed it and found it to be as sad as all the others that had come before him.
"Hey Cap. I'm good. No trouble for once. I just wanted to tell you that I broke the encryption on the phone but there's nothing underneath it and I don't get it."
Steve hadn’t even really noticed how intertwined their lives were until he’d gone looking for a certain shirt in his closet only to realize he’d washed it and hung it up in his side of Tony’s closet. He’d had to borrow a shirt from Bucky and his best friend had just laughed at him.
And college was a perfect breeding ground for opportunistic assholes who just found excuses to take advantage of people. Steve hated posturing but sometimes the only way to get people to leave Tony alone was for Steve to be very blatant about the fact
Was he in love with Steve now? Was he dooming himself much in the same manner Steve had doomed himself months ago?
“Got it. I’ll just forward your number to all my friends and any enemy of yours that I can think of!” Tony teases and can’t help but grin broadly at the mildly annoyed expression on the Captain’s face that he can make out beneath the facemask covering the lower half of the man’s face.
“Hmm...well it’s all related to medicine. Researchers trying to find ways to create essentially human body friendly weed killers with nanotech. Something to help people get rid of the flowers without having to give up the feelings attached. But I don’t think that’s anything that’s gonna happen any time soon. Testing out the tech in itself would probably be pretty hard. Hanahaki patients are generally pretty stubborn people so they’re unlikely to want to give up their flowers and feelings in the event the experiment fails. It’s complicated.” Tony explained and the other two hummed in agreement.
“Do you want to break me while you’re at it?” Tony asked, pain and stress gripped his throat like a vise, “This hurts enough as it is Steve.”
“Nothing. It was a fucking bust. Total waste of time.” Bucky muttered and slinked his way over to the couch to snuggle into Natasha’s right side. She lifted her arm to draw him into her chest and pressed a soft kiss to his hair before wrinkling her nose.
Tony had grown up knowing that people were always expecting things out of him and always trying to get things out of him. To this day Steve was thankful that Tony, while initially cautious about their budding relationship, had never really seen Steve as being any sort of gold digger or manipulator who only wanted to get close to Tony for his wealth. Because honestly Steve had fallen in love with those pretty brown eyes and the mischief in Tony’s smile, not in the amount of zeros in Tony’s name or the legacy of the Stark family.
Except deep down Tony knew that his own set of flowers was going to either kill him or leave him entirely emotionless when it came to thinking about Steve in the future. In the end Steve was never going to love him back because he loved someone else and hadn’t been willing and continued to not be willing to give them up. Tony didn’t stand a chance there and he knew it.
"How is it?" Steve asked, a small smile and that adorable twinkle in his baby blue eyes that made Tony want to swoon.
He rubbed his eyes and looked around the cell he’d been tossed in. Everything looked the same as the last time he had been awake. Grey walls, sturdy metal bars that he could see through and no other cells in sight. Tony knew he wasn’t the only prisoner Hydra was keeping but they wanted him to feel like he was. As if Tony wanted to play mind games on top of trying to breathe deeply and not losing his shit the longer he stayed imprisoned.
“Mr.—right Steve we need to go through procedure. I’ll make it quick as I’m sure there are things you rather do than sit here and have to listen to this. You have contracted Hanahaki Disease which is an illness that arises as a result of one-sided love. You have been hospitalized which implies that your condition has gone on long enough that living a regular life is no longer entirely possible. Your options are now to share your feelings of love with the other person and in the hope that your love is not one-sided as you currently believe, remove the flowers and your feelings for that person through surgery, or wait it out. Waiting it out is always an option and one that we respect in this hospital so don’t feel as if we won’t support you if you choose to take that route. As it stands according to your charts currently your hospitalization is more precautionary than entirely necessary but your condition seems to be rapidly worsening. Have you already reached a decision in terms of which route you want to take or will you need time to think?” Tony finished and the handsome man sitting in the bed gave him a sad smile.
“Because my stuff will be there Steve. It’s not like the things you do. Social justice marches and poetry readings and all the other stuff we do together. Those things don’t last forever. You have to experience them in the moment before they disappear into thin air. My robots will be there though so you can always look at them later. The fact you care enough to ask about it is more than I could ever ask for.”
“Oh? That’s generous of you.” Steve smirked as he crossed his arms,” I wouldn’t pay for this if I was in your shoes.”
“Who do we have to see today?” Rhodey muttered as he slipped on his white coat upon entering the floor dedicated to Hana patients. Tony looked away from the computer where he was writing up an email to the in-house pharmacy to look at his usual partner.
“Like how much you know about her? Like you know her favorite color and her favorite food. Stuff like that.”
“What’s been going on?” Steve asked even though he had a good feeling he knew what the other was talking about.
“If you know what’s good for you Mr. Stark then you’ll keep walking and follow us to our vehicle.” The voice muttered into his ear. It was pleasant and detached. Tony hated it.
“Interesting style. It’s definitely not as serious as all the other pieces here,” Tony murmured while facing Steve’s art.
Tony could feel Steve’s smile form against where it was tucked into his neck. “I could ask you the same thing.”
He could hear Clint’s faint whining response to Bucky's question, no doubt muddled by the food he was still shoveling into his mouth. Steve chuckled to himself, throwing the plastic cartons and forks into the trash bag he held in his other hand.
He barely heard it, as he was more focused on watching Tony’s hands move gracefully across his tablet, not even pretending to pay attention to the meeting. On the infinite list of reasons why he loved Tony, his hands probably cracked top five. How his fingers danced across a keyboard, and how his callused palms dragged across his back, making him shiver. They were completely different than Steve’s, but an artist hand, no less. They could fabricate any of Tony’s thoughts into reality, working at the same speed as his massive brain, tough enough to mold metal, but delicate enough to work on circuit boards. They were as steady as a surgeon’s, and as firm as a politician’s. Oh, and apparently, they could support literal tons of concrete one second, then cradle kittens gently the next. He could almost feel his touch now, teasing, just like the rest of Tony, reaching into his pants and –
“Maybe," he asked, hiding the hand holding his firearm under the desk. The last thing he needed to be slapped with was a public arrest for endangering a cop. "Who the hell are you?”
Steve left out a quiet huff, his hand rubbing at the back of his neck. “Yeah, I guess you’re right.”
He watched the pair dart off, quickly disappearing within the yard. He started to backtrack himself, heading back to the speakeasy. Knowing the Maximoff twins, Clint would have Stark’s location by the end of the week.
Steve woke in parts, slowly coming around to the warm cocoon he’d surrounded himself in. It was dark out, the pale moonlight peeking in from in between the window curtains. He hadn’t realized he was that tired, but he had been too antsy to sleep while on his way to South Carolina, and once he saw Tony, well, he couldn’t seem to help himself.
It was late, and there was a steady breeze, but Steve wasn’t cold, feeling Tony lay next to him in the bed of the truck, surrounded by pillows and blankets. Dinner was somewhat undercooked, and dessert was a disaster, but Steve never remembered smiling as much as he did.
“Tony,” Obie sighed. “We’re a team, you and I. I’ve stood beside you for years, and never blinked an eye. I even stood by your drunk ass when you busted into a board meeting and tried to demonstrate your rocket powered roller blades.”
Steve gazed down at the small buzzer, testing it out. It worked like a charm. “Where did you find this?”
The lab was quiet, a rare feat in itself, and Steve’s echoing footsteps into the room felt like a march to the gallows. Tony was bent over a table, looking down at a mess of God-knows-what, but neither his hands or eyes where moving. His focus was clearly on Steve.
Tony shook his head, rising his eye line to meet the gazes of hungry reporters. "I came to realize that I have more to offer to this world than just making things blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down that weapons manufacturing division of - "
Steve felt his heart rate pick up again. They couldn’t find the bullet, but Tony was already in critical condition. If the doctors start poking around in there looking for a bullet, it could mean disastrous things.
“One hundred percent, Pep. The Captain and his men aren’t going to be a problem anymore. Now what’s up?”
Clint bit his lip, trying to step between the man and the car again. “Cap, let’s think about this. We don’t want to do anything rash.”
“You," Tony gaped. "You went to see Pepper. Steve, she knows who you are!” After flubbing out the last sentence, Tony cursed, slapping a hand over his mouth. “I mean,
Stark pointed to the corner of the projection. “That look fishy to you?” Sure enough, there was another figure that appeared on the photo. The quality was grainy, and with the added shadows from the buildings, Steve could barely make out his face.
Steve just hummed, breathing in the scent of Tony’s shampoo. It were moments like these, with Tony tucked under his neck, the pair just soaking each other in, that Steve could forget their life for a little while. Tony’s callused fingers wove through the hairs on the nape of his neck, the deft fingers making curls with the blonde strands.
The fiery redhead walked over to the two men with grace, but her face spoke volumes of harsh annoyance. “If I have to sit through any more of this pissing contest, someone will die. And, oddly enough, it probably won’t be the guy we brought here to kill.”
“Because that’s not all the photos he gave me,” Bucky said tersely. He pushed aside the photos of Steve and Loki. “Because Loki has been meeting with someone other than Steve.”
Clint crossed his arms, defensively. “Think about it. Cold at the entry wound and no bullet. You got any other theories?”
Obie glared at him. “You want to know why your father and I put so much into our weapons division? Because it will
“Like you wouldn’t believe,” Tony moaned. “This man made me sleep outside last night, Romanoff. I smell like dirt and squirrel.”
Stark gave a hollow laugh. “You’re really just a Hallmark card aren’t you? Actually, no. You’re more like one of those motivational posters. You know, the ones with the cat hanging in the tree? Except ‘hanging in there’ for you is defeating a rival mob instead of staying in school.”
“Only Stark knows,” mused Thor, leaning back in his chair. “He was at the warehouse with The Captain, and now he’s not. Steven won’t even talk about what happened. What if Stark was in on it? What if he was the one who- ”
“No, it doesn’t,” Bucky agreed. “Make sure Steve doesn’t leave,” he continued, pushing the door open and walking outside.
Steve lurched forward to look at the far wall, Sam barely managing to catch him. “It’s not there,” he whispered.
“Not when it matters,” said Steve. When they were younger, Steve wouldn't hesitate reaching out to Bucky, asking him for advice on what to say. Bucky was suave and grew into his body fact, quickly elevating his status on the school grounds. It seemed like he could day anything on the school grounds to make the girls swoon. But it was just for fun, a complete facade based on empty words and quick smiles. Enough to work on the common crowd, but not those closest to him. It had taken years for Bucky to muster out the strength that he considered Steve his best friend, the brunette biting his lip and kicking at the ground, as he wasn't sure his admission woud be taken well. “He can talk his way out of any crime, but God forbid that man actually says he likes you,” Steve laughed.
“The sewer system? That makes even less sense,” Steve replied. Maybe there was a build up that caused the pipes to burst? A lot of those systems were decades old - there had to be a level of water that they weren't able to bypass. But that couldn't be; New York hadn't had a storm surge that would cause any hint of flooding in months. He couldn't even remember the last time it had drizzled.
She nodded, looking around to take in her surroundings. There were plenty of times that she imagined what she would do if she ever got in the doors of the NYPD headquarters. Shame this would be a waster opportunity. They were in Fury’s office, the Commissioner dropping them off like school children, grumbling at them to stay put while he got his people together. Any chance to poke around the office was thwarted by an FBI agent posted at the door. Natasha was more than confident that she could get away with a cursory search, but she had promised Steve that she would be on her best behavior. Well, for the time being.
And then Steve was laughing again, a much better sound than the first time, Bucky easily joining in. It was like they were young again, bantering easily as they patched themselves up in their shithole apartment.
“This is what I’m talking about, Tony,” Steve continued, pulling Tony away from his lab table. “You work too much.”
Phil gripped the paper tightly in his hands. “She lost her boss and a close friend. You can’t expect her to be on top of her game.”
“It was to be an arranged marriage. Well, my dad referred to it as a business merger,” Tony huffed. “Obi was always nice to me, always telling me I’ll do great things. I thought that we would be perfect together,” he said with a watery smile, until his face turned stony. “But then my parents died, and Obi changed. He wasn’t the same man. He didn’t marry for me, he married for my power; I guess I forgot about that. He raped me. He beat me. He destroyed me until I couldn’t remember my own name. He took everything for me: my home, my business, my life! I tried to stop him, get the authorities involved, but they wouldn’t listen! Obi found out and tried to kill me. You saw my scars; you know I’m not lying. I was terrified; I-I couldn’t let him - ” Tony broke off with a shudder, gasping for air into his hands.
So, to see the man start to tidy up was almost wrong. He was stalling. Steve shifted a little closer, his moments hesitant. It wasn’t awkward between them, per say. It’s just that they hadn’t had a lot time to come to terms with what happened at the first attack. With everything else happening, there has only been a handful of times that Steve has found himself alone with Tony, and each time that he's there, he doesn’t know what to do.
“Then where did Stark go? Steve was asking for him when we got there, so he was obviously there at one point.”
“Tony?” He turned, barely able to hear Steve other the pounding in his head. A hand came to rest on his shoulder but he jerked back quickly. Tony accidently met Steve’s eyes, finding a look that was probably just as haunted as his own face. “Tony, I-I…,” Steve started again, shaking his head slowly. “I didn’t mean… God, Tony, it just slipped out.”
Clint shook his head. There were too many ambiguities in their situation. What if Stark was HYDRA? What if telling him could hurt the team? Could kill them?
It wasn't often that Steve had the entire family at base at the same time, due to different jobs and schedules, but it seemed like everyone and their mother was cramped in their small headquarters. Steve was met with respectable nods and smiles to anyone who met his eyes, but no one stopped their movement completely, shoving past and around Steve to continue their duties.
The warehouse was seemingly quiet as they walked up to it. Steve didn’t buy it for a second, his hands already itching for a gun. “I go in first,” Campbell said tersely. “Once my men have the building cleared, we’ll call you in.” Bucky gave Steve a side-glare.
He swam as hard as he could, arching around the building that had gone up in flames. The explosions had been so powerful that some of the buildings around the warehouse were also alight.
Tony flopped against the mattress and looked up at Steve hovering over him, chest already heaving. Steve stared right back, blue eyes burning like the center of a flame. Strong hands trailed across his chest, and Tony could almost feel them twitching for a pad and paper to capture the scene forever. The movements were gentle against his skin, but Tony watched Steve’s muscles shift as he continued his path down Tony’s ribs, a clear reminder of how much power lay beneath the surface. To have Steve like this, to have him look at Tony like this – it was indescribable.
“I’m just saying. Maybe someone less… affected, could be able to see a bigger picture you might be missing.”
.” The way he said it gave Steve shivers. “I know he did. But when I woke up, I didn’t realize at first, what I had just come back from.” His head gave a sharp nod towards the Pomeranian. “Then, the following morning, after everything had apparently been sorted out,
It’s the glow of the reactor in his chest that keeps him from falling for the nanites’ illusion. Tapping it will activate the process of turning the ones infecting Steve off, but he’s not supposed to do that yet. Still, he lets his fingers linger over it, comforted by the familiar feel. It hasn’t changed, its small triangular shape solid under his fingertips, reminding him none of what he’s seeing is real.
It is, apparently, the right thing to say, because Tony’s smile grows to blinding levels before he immediately snaps the phone back from his pocket and launches into a rant about the wave emitting tech that would be necessary for such a system and the algorithms one would need to create it.
“Everything okay, Stark?” Tony flinches at the use of his name (his father’s name). “You look like you’re gonna be sick.”
is literally anything that involves disagreeing with the little tyrant. I once turned for telling him he'd had enough treats.”
Finally, Anakin and Lola arrived. Lola settled on the empty space between Steve’s body and the couch, her face planted over Steve’s armpit; and Anakin found room closer to Steve’s head, resting his snout on Steve’s shoulder.
“Okay,” Steve whispers, his voice giddy and his eyes sparkling, and Tony feels like he’s cheating the world, for being the only person who gets to see this. This smile should be broadcasted on Times Square. For world peace.
Howard’s response to Tony wasn’t exactly a lie, even if it wasn’t exactly truth, either. There is a lot to consider. There is a difference between providing the rebels with a few shipments of weapons and soldiers, and promising his son to one of them. The first one ensures their favor if their revolution succeeds; the second one effectively makes the Starks part of their rebellion, as it ensures Tony will be by Rogers’ side, when he takes the throne.
“Uh… yeah,” the man said, after a moment of silence. “Yeah, yeah, he totally is.” He made a flippant gesture. “He’s probably just roaming around, it’s fine.”
“But Tony has a knack for—for making impossible things happen.” Steve’s voice wavered, and he looked down for a moment, a small smile curling his lips. “And the more time passed, and the more impossible it got, the more I… I fell for him.” He raised his head, staring straight at Ayesha. “I can’t even tell you when I started loving him. All I know is that one day I couldn’t keep denying that I did, and I do, and I don’t think I’ll be able to stop someday, even if he doesn’t love me back.” He paused, breathing heavily, as if a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders. “Anymore,” he added quickly.
, what with the way his pink lips curl and his eyes shine and he looks like he’s not even seeing anything else other than Tony. “Thank you. Really, Tony, I—To be honest, sometimes I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
He looked up to check the man’s face, as if it had somehow changed in the time they were there, and, yes – the resemblance was uncanny, but Steve had a hard time understanding what the hell a multi billionaire like Tony Stark would be doing in a dog park in Steve’s neighborhood (or, oh yeah,
“No,” Steve says, final. He leans forward and presses a kiss to Tony’s wet cheek, lowering his hands to rub the towels against his shoulders gently. “You’re a good boyfriend.”
“Siberia,” Tony repeats, his voice stronger now. “It was quite a mess back there. I’m not proud of how I’ve acted, but I mean, finding out like that…”
Tony presses his lips together. Ok, he thinks. So Steve is around, and using something Tony made for him. So they – here – are on good terms.
“If I’m a demigod,” Steve said. Part of him wanted to laugh at the entire thing and say Stark was probably pranking him, but a larger part of him believed the man, as ridiculous as everything sounded. “I’m a god of what?” At Stark’s gaze, he added: “You mentioned ‘special abilities’.”
He could feel Stark’s gaze on him as he settled in. Hurriedly, he pulled the covers up, not wanting to feel exposed.
Steve frowned, but he didn’t want to pursue that line of interrogation. From what he had gathered so far, Stark was a very strange man, and Steve needed some more useful information from him at the moment. “What
Tony glanced at her for a moment, and saw as she and her servants did a small courtesy bow. Then Ayesha smiled, apparently satisfied, and turned towards the door, walking away. The servants hurried after, seeming a little unsure of what they were doing.
Steve would reply, and they’d talk, and it’d be… nice. Sometimes it would result in Steve looking a little silly, grinning at his phone.
It’s Howard’s turn to clench his jaw. Annoyance sparks in his belly, though he still doesn’t fully understand why. Surely, whatever ulterior motive he was hoping to find doesn’t exist, so he should leave Rogers be.
“This will be fast.” Tony props himself up by his elbows to let Rhodey place electrodes behind his neck. “He’s gonna take one look at me and go ‘Uh, sorry, isn’t this supposed to be my happy place?’”
He finished drinking, taking the glass from Stark’s hand to take the final sip. The cold water helped to wake him up, like a breath of fresh air into his lungs.
After Tony swallows, though, he remains in silence. His big eyes watch Howard as they would study a new catapult, but Howard notices there’s a slight flush on his ears. For a moment, Tony seems reflexive, and Howard catches the spark of something that feels foreign in his eyes – hope.
“Come on,” he says. “Let’s give them a fair fight.” And then, unless Tony is actually delirious because of the sunlight, he perks his hips a little, grinning slyly with those damn flushed cheeks: “And then later we can, uh, brainstorm.”
Steve blinks. The sound of loud thunder roars outside, but he doesn’t jolt, too focused on the image in front of him to be startled by the noise.
And, oh—Tony really likes when he says that. It’s— recent, but it’s been happening a lot, lately. Each time, he thinks he likes it more.
. He wishes his grief and fury hadn’t blinded him to the need to armor himself to not let the wrong things come out. His stomach clenches and his chest tightens when he thinks of lying there on the hard ground, watching as Steve turned his back on him as he held onto Barnes, as Tony yelled at him like a rejected child.
Tony swallowed. Clearly, Steve had elaborated a little on their lie – and thrown some truth in the mix as well. All things considered, it wouldn’t be a bad choice, if it managed to make Ayesha—
It takes a moment for them to find the right angle without bumping their noses. Steve’s hands are a little hesitant on Tony’s waist, as if he’s afraid of hurting him if he holds on too strongly, and Tony can tell he definitely hasn’t kissed many people in the 21st century. The kiss is all enthusiasm and no technique, nervous and clumsy.
The scribe lets out a muffled laugh. Howard, with a rush of self-satisfaction, waits to see Tony’s cheeks flush with shame, but instead he only seems more indignant, hands closing into fists on his lap.
“I’ll have my chef send the recipe to your database,” Ayesha replied. Then she raised an inquiring eyebrow. “Say, I’ve heard humans heavily associate cooking with your females,” she said
“Whatever,” Tony groans. Steve turns his head at him, outraged at his dismissiveness, and he pinches the bridge of his nose: “Look, I was in this spot for most of last year, and it sucks, so I get what you’re saying. Just talk to him, okay? It might seem ridiculous, but it’s all that it takes. I know you’re thinking it’s not that simple because it’s what I used to think, but, really, it was for me, and I’m pretty sure it’s going to be for you too.”
You know what I’m talking about,” Rhodey says, a little desperate. “You’re too…” He presses his lips together, and Tony clenches his fingers around the gauntlet. They’re veering onto dangerous terrain, never before acknowledged. “You’re too… invested.”
The second he said it, something seemed to lit up in Steve’s head, like a lamp. “I,” he started, unable to not sound disbelieving. “I’m a god of…”
“Shit,” Tony says, grabbing it. “I’m sorry.” He must check the time on his screen, because his eyes widen. “Uh, okay, maybe not so sorry. Hm, Cap? We’re twenty minutes away from losing the flight back to Earth.”
“Hey,” he starts, exceedingly casual. “Was it too hard for you to handle us together? You know, after Siberia?”
“Let me go then,” Rhodey interrupts, landing his free hand on Tony’s shoulder. “I will be back before you know it. And you…” His dark eyes sparkled knowingly even as his expression didn’t betray anything. “You can watch over him.”
His worktable is in the corner of the room, next to the small forge. A faint smell of charcoal makes Howard’s nostrils itch. His stomach twists as he approaches the table and sees the pieces of parchment paper. His notes are illegible; the work of an overly excited drunk, and just looking at them makes Howard yearn for a glass of beer.
“Can I…?” he asks, hovering his hand in the air, and Tony nods. His eyes are big and gorgeous and impossible to read as Steve raises his hand to the reactor. His finger traces the sensitive skin around it.
Guilt curled in Steve’s chest, but he couldn’t bring himself to argue. He wouldn’t have minded nearly as much if it was Bruce seeing his naked torso. It was the thought of Tony’s opinion on his current body that scared him the most.
“Tony?” He asks, from the doorway. Something about his posture seems momentarily foreign and then immediately familiar, because, Tony realizes, it’s stiff. “What are you doing?”
“Yesterday,” Steve started, the word seeming to take great effort. Tony could empathize – even the suggestion of discussing what he had done made his heart jump to his throat. “I should’ve said something. I—I heard you.”
His intent was to keep the kiss chaste, making it a slightly longer than usual peck, but then he felt Steve’s arms flying to his waist, pulling him closer. Tony’s chest met the firm barrier of Steve’s, and he shivered in response, and then Steve parted his lips, and, well—Tony’s mind went completely blank, effectively shutting down at the heat of Steve’s tongue. Tony’s hands tightened on Steve’s cheeks, angling his head to give himself better access, and he could feel
still echoing in his head, and even though Steve is wearing a wedding ring and kissing Tony, he’s married to someone else—Barnes, Peggy Carter, literally
Fury sat back down in the chair next to Phil. “I looked him up, and oddly enough, the only Louis Ronin I could find in New York, which is where you vaguely answered that he resided, was a twelve year old kid. So it wasn’t a real name. But whose fake name was it? A quick search through the criminal database and I found him. Clint Barton. Ten years ago he used the same name to check into a hotel before robbing the place blind.”
“I thought he didn’t know about this place,” Steve said, leaning over Tony’s shoulder to watch the feed.
“Let me tell you something. Clint’s never leaving; you know that, I know that. He doesn’t know anything outside of this life. And where he goes, I go. I mean, the man can barely find his shoes in the morning; can you imagine him trying to survive a week without me? Besides, domestic live wouldn’t suit us. That’s a one way ticket for us to sit in recliners and get fat.”
He could have cried along with her, but there was no point. He had to pick up where his dad left off. His father had gone off to war for the wellbeing of this family and had died for that as well. Now, it fell to Sam to further the tradition.
So when The Captain decided to attack Tony in the middle of a rescheduled business lunch, he was about ready to shit his pants. None of it had been scripted; for a little while, Tony had been entirely convinced The Captain was actually going to kill him.
Tony Stark dismantling The Commandos from the inside, playing the victim card. Plant one bomb and suddenly you’re just an innocent. Stark had connections, and Lord knows how dramatic that man was when he wanted to be. He inserts his way into Steve’s side, and soon HYDRA would know anything and everything about them.
He saw a ball of energy form between the two of them, growing erratically as the power built. He could see when Obadiah caught on to his wavelength, the orb growing right in front of him. Exothermic reactions: the heat needed to go somewhere.
He was thankful for each day he didn’t have to Hulk out. Today showed to him yet again, that he shouldn’t pretend that he’s a hero. That he could actually help people.
“Well, she sure as hell isn’t here!” Mrs. Mason snapped angrily. She saw Natasha and scolded, “Stop inviting your derelict friends here before I call the police!” The old wench slammed her own door shut before Natasha could respond.
Just as soon as it started, the shower was stopped, Steve padding his feet against the tiles grab from the mound of fluffy towels, scrubbing his hair before wrapping it around his waist.
“And at least one employee that knows who’s in charge of the whole thing. And who really took out Phil.”
Natasha was always angry. Gone were her chiding remarks and soft hums. All that was left now was a mother that was too fed up in dealing with her children. Sam wasn’t doing much better. He filtered through the rooms of the speakeasy, trying to help everyone. Of course, when no one wanted it, Sam’s become nothing but constantly drained. Steve hadn’t seen Bruce or Thor in weeks. Bruce had ditched in the midst of another screaming match, the doctor always avoiding conflicts that brought up undesirable childhood memories. As for Thor, Steve wasn’t sure he’d ever come back. It wasn’t hard for any of them to put the pieces together on who was responsible for Coulson. One look at Clint’s face and Thor was out the door, guilt hanging over him like a cloud.
There were a few callers that would share their experiences and tips. Steve’s favorite was Sam Wilson, a vet working at a VA office down in Washington D.C. He was a regular caller, and always offered words that seemed wise beyond his years, as well as helpful programs to get them back on their feet. Sam had even promised to stop by and record with them in person this spring, when he’d come up to New York for a friend’s wedding.
Tony obliged, turning to look out of the window. He itched for his sketchbook again, wanting to forever capture the gape of Tony’s face when he finally saw it. “What the fuck is that?”
The shield was a lot neater, too. None of that clean up the blood stains crap. Not to mention, someone can survive a gunshot. One whip of the shield aimed at the left side of the body at close range, and down goes the target. The blow from the shield disrupts the electrical signals passing through the heart, causing it to stop beating instantly. It’s clean. Effective.
“I don’t care!” Steve yelled. “I am not wasting another damn second, Bucky. I’m getting down there to him!”
“Well, yes, but,” Phil sighed. “In order for me to talk about his offenses, I had to explain why I had the knowledge.”
“Fury said the only way he could get us together is in gen-pop. And we figured waiting this out alone would be better than all of us behind bars,” Tony interrupted.
Fury husked out a faint chuckle. “No, thank you. I won’t overstay be welcome. I just have a few questions.”
While Clint thought that The Commandos were some of the strongest people he'd ever met, he knew that each of them suffered from the same weakness: each other. It wasn't as if it was an easy fix - Clint knew that they were stronger together, but he would be blind to see that it couldn't be used as their biggest downfall. It was strange, as when they'd first collected as thieves and murders, it would have been laughable to Clint that he would consider them family, let alone trust them. But here he was, years later, so interwoven with the rest of the group that now he couldn't imagine leaving any of them behind. Steve was not immune to this affliction; recent events solidified that he was in the same boat as the rest of them: he would do anything to protect them.
“Because I know you, Stark,” continued Barnes. “You’re nothing but a sleazy businessman, and a threat to my family. I’m sorry to say that we’re not your typical cliental, however. We’re not swayed by your fancy words and your smart mouth. You’re not fooling any of us, so you can quit it with the knight and shining armor bullcrap vibe you’re trying to send out.”
Sam shot him an unimpressed look. “Well, we may have to wait on Hammer, considering you basically beat him within an inch of his life.”
pens - seemed a lot more interesting than they were before. He started to bat at one between his fingers, listening to it roll across his desk. He could feel the heat of Pepper's stare.
Clint was struggling in his arms, shouting, pleading for Phil to get up. Bucky would be wrong if he wasn’t mere seconds away from yelling the same thing. Coulson couldn’t be dead. He just couldn’t.
Steve sighed for probably the millionth time, looking over his shoulder to send his companion a dirty look. Not that he could see it. “Just a few more minutes!” he shouted back, turning back to the mess in front of him. Gratefully, Tony didn’t respond with another scathing comment.
He couldn’t breathe. It was like he was stuck back in his old body, his asthmatic lungs struggling to get the air in. It was like watching Bucky fall from the train, his screams echoing through the mountain tops. It was like watching Peggy stare at him with confusion, asking for his name again. Everything was suddenly too loud, too fast. Walls were closing in, Steve’s head pounding as he finally felt himself break into-
“You know you were the youngest Looper I ever hired? They thought you looked goddamn ridiculous. Just a scrappy little twig. I remember when my men brought you in. And I could see. I could see your life turn bad in front of my eyes. So what did I do? I changed it. I brought you in, cleaned you up and put the shield in your hands. I gave you something that was yours.”
Tony winced and jerked his head away, smiling over at the couple dancing next to them that had turned at them questioningly. “Maybe I just needed to get some air,” he whispered.
Steve sighed, sitting back down in his chair and began to wait until everyone would fall asleep. Then he would make his move. Then he’d finally save his family.
Part of Tony thought about powering JARVIS down and slipping through the back door where no prying eyes could catch him, but he knew that was a fool’s errand. Past Tony, in his infinite wisdom, had programmed an alert to The Commandos’ phones to tell them if and when JARVIS ever went offline. JARVIS was the first line of defense to the speakeasy; if anyone managed to get through his firewalls and into the building, at least the team would still be ready for whatever was coming. So, if he took J offline now, Tony would probably make it half a block before the beefcake twins downstairs would know what he’d planned.
Steve shot Bucky a dirty glare. “Real nice, Buck. She’s probably gonna go complain to a manager, now.”
is what people are calling it. Word on the street was that The Captain had been found linked to the injuries and deaths of Stark Industries, so Tony retaliated by revealing the mob man’s name. Others say that Tony was the one to start the fighting, The Captain forced into action. Regardless of who threw the first punch, the effect was instantaneous. Mobs were gearing up, ready to choose sides in this Civil War if asked. Tony had already been on the phone with Quill about it; his forces were already rallying, no doubt The Captain’s allies doing the exact same thing. New York was thick with tension, no want wanting to stay out past dark, no one wanting to go out at all.
Steve kicked the man, relishing in the pained grunt. “I know you’re lying to me. That’s okay, though. You see, I was lying too. You don’t get to leave. You don’t get the pleasure of a coward’s death. Sorry, Justin. Looks like you’re stuck in here with me.”
Tony’s thoughts zoomed through him, his brain working overdrive as shock set in. Screw the arm; Tony needed to get the out of there
“That man ruined my life. He’s trying to ruin yours. I won’t let that happen.” Steve turned back around to face Tony. “I just want to live my thirty years in peace. That’s all. I want my life back. He took it; and I’m going to get it back.”
Steve heard Clint snicker when he saw Stark’s position, although it was cut off with another gasp of pain. Bucky stepped closer, pushing harder against the wound to try and comfort his friend.
have had everything. And he would have made Pierce his number two. Pierce remembered waiting, pacing by the phone all night to hear the good news. The news of a successful mission. But instead, he wasted away in the night, dropping off to sleep, only to wake up to a very different story. He could barely believe what he heard on the news:
that got him up there. She’d always been a superstitious woman, but then again, almost everyone was down here. There was always a higher power at work, whether it be God or the Devil himself. Christianity, hoodoo, witchcraft, anything really, had a part to play down here. But Sam never paid that any mind. He didn’t believe in fate. He believed in people. People had driven him north, and people had brought him back down South.
“How naive of you,” murmured The Skull. “Surely by now you would have figured out that why you’ve survived as long as you have.”
Despite Barnes’s calm demeanor, Tony broke off with a shout, his face almost bright red from exertion. He knew Barnes had it out for him, but this was just insane. They were on the same side here; why the hell were they still fighting?
He heard Tony flop next to him, the man’s presence still a complete shock. Steve held him in sight, afraid that if he looked away for too long, the engineer would disappear again. It wasn’t long before the seats were filled; all but one. Steve frowned, looking to the vacant seat at his right. His heart rate skyrocketed unconsciously, his body tensing as he tried to jump into action.
but standing here with Steve, Sam could feel tears begin to well up in his eyes. A final confirmation needed to break the dam. Months of ignoring new stories and flipping channels, months of silencing the
The two stared at each other for what felt like an eternity. Then, his older self made a move, turning around. “Shit,” Steve whispered, throwing his shield. Steve’s shield bounced off the gold strapped to his back. Steve ran to his fallen shield, ready for another throw. When he turned around, he came face to face with his older self. The future him shrugged his shoulders before punching Steve’s lights out.
“Use your head,” replied Bucky, swatting Steve in the back of the skull. “Stark’s been missing almost all week and we haven’t heard a peep from his company. Don’t you think it’s odd that no one thought to ask about the man whose name is on the side of the building?”
“Now,” Fury sighed. “Tell me about this smoking gun? What do you have, that will get me to let you all off scot free?”
Natasha opened her mouth but was quickly stopped by Clint, his hand smacking over it. “Don’t,” he grit out. “Just don’t.”
“They were,” Stane hissed. “Tony hid out for a few days after the news spread about The Captain’s name, and then as soon as he came back, he’s been doing nothing but working out of the office. I never even saw him go home. We must have missed something.”
The guards tossed the brunette in the chair across from Steve, Tony's movements sluggish in retaliation.
“I know what you’re gonna say,” Tony interrupted. “And yes, I did not receive anywhere close to the amount of treatments that they got. So no, I’m nowhere near the level or breathing fire or making Johnny Storm look like a parlor trick, but it’s still in me, Steve. No matter how little I have, I still
There was a small kitchen to the right of him, matching the rest of the floor’s theme. It was laid out in an open floor plan, which Steve greatly appreciated. There were no confining walls, just open, breathable air.
Since Pierce had been adamant to finally capturing The Captain, it was easy for Hammer to fall on board once he found out that he had the bonus of dealing with Tony Stark as he saw fit. With the arrival of their new associate, The Monger-
Steve didn't respond. His head was whirling, waiting for the moment for Stark to laugh in his face, call off his bluff and blow the building to pieces.
Sam stared blankly at the other man, lamp still raised behind his head. Another second went by and Tony Stark peeked out from behind Steve. “What, you gonna brain us with the lamp?” he asked with a smirk, giving the light fixture a once over. “Actually,” he continued, “that thing is positively atrocious, maybe you should give it a good whacking.”
Steve broke out into a smile, the flash of white gleaming against his blackened face dampened by tears. He laughed, almost sobbing, as he pressed his forehead gently against Tony’s. “Yeah, Tony,” he whispered. “Home. We missed you.
He was just getting comfortable when he felt Steve start to shift. “Don’t,” Tony said suddenly, hands digging into Steve’s skin.
Steve sat up, moving his hands around Tony until he was seated in his lap. With this new angle, Steve hit Tony’s prostate with each thrust. Tony cried out into the night before grasping at Steve’s face for a brutal kiss.
“Since my friend was shot and left to bleed out not one hundred feet away from here,” Bruce replied evenly, walking back over to the body. “And since we aren’t getting the answers we should be.”
Tony ended his call and sauntered back over to Steve, not stopping until his face was pushed into Steve’s firm chest. Steve immediately brought his arms around the smaller man, bending down to breathe in Tony’s scent.
The water was still cold when he stepped in, but Steve paid it no mind. He didn’t want to waste time in there anyway. Steve just focused on scrubbing, washing away any evidence, thinking about his warm bed and equally warm engineer waiting for him there.
Obie hadn't seem to care much as he ended up at their funeral anyway. He didn't really remember the service, who came, or even the caskets being lowered into the ground. What he did remember was a comment, as he was finally leaving. Usually, Tony filtered everything out; it was usually the same anyway:
But this one was different. He wasn’t really sure how, but days went by, then weeks, then months, and it finally hit him.
Obie hummed, turning away to walk back to the vehicle. “You’ll get the gift you deserve,” he answered, looking back at Raza one final time, before looking to his guards. “Finish up here.”
Steve looked back outside. “I set up in the shed. But if I’m in there, and you’re in here, we’re going to need some way to communicate.”
Tony sat down in the chair carefully, groaning softly to himself. Although his arm was a constant throbbing, Barnes’s threats were the only thing plaguing him right now. Tony had been lucky that Cap was right there; he knew that Barnes could be a loose cannon if he wanted to. Tony would have to keep a closer eye on him; there was no way he would be able to win the war if he was fighting battles on both sides.
“Not exactly.” Steve rubbed a hand against the back of his neck. Bucky thought of his go-bag collecting dust in his closet. Bucky was ready. Steve knew he would be ready.
“Don’t do that,” Tony hissed. “How the hell did you even get here so fast? Were you in here the whole time?”
After hanging up with Sam, Steve immediately tried to reach Tony. He wasn’t surprised when he got his voice mail, but Steve decided to leave a message.
He spun quickly, rushing the last few steps until his body met the armor, the metal already shaping around his body. He could still hear Steve shouting at him, but Tony just blasted off, the damaged armor taking into a graceless flight.
Steve reached forward with a trembling hand, finally clean of both of their blood, lightly grasping Tony’s. He traced over each of Tony’s fingers, counting the calluses as he went. Steve had always loved Tony’s hands, how they were such an enigma. That even though, in Steve’s eyes, Tony was an artist, his hands were the farthest things from their typical limb type. His skin raw, hardened and cracked instead of delicate. His fingers were short and stocky instead of the long ones needed to hold a paintbrush. But they represented Tony perfectly. His palette was metal and fire, not watercolors. It was a reflection of Tony, Steve thought. Rough around the edges, strong and durable; cracked and chipped away in some places, but always fresh skin underneath, always regrowing, never giving up. Sturdy and rough when needed, but still always managing to be gentle.
“If you say so,” said Steve, a small smile playing on his lips as he rested his cheek in Tony’s hair. “You’ll be safe?” he asked quietly.
It was auto-pilot, stepping into the bathroom to do his business, brushing his teeth and splashing cold water on his face, all while ignoring the urge to look in the mirror. He wasn’t exactly sure what he would see, but Tony knew he wouldn’t like it. He hadn’t been shaving, hell, he’d barely been showering. But Tony knew the parts that weren’t covered in greasy hair would be worse; pale skin that had been showing an increasingly amount of bone ridges with each passing day. Food wasn’t exactly a priority either.
Tony’s heart leapt. There was an explosion at the compound. Steve had been there, and he hadn’t answered his phone.
his fault. And Clint knew it. And that whatever happens, regardless of whether Coulson survived or not, that bridge between him had Clint had burned. No, it wasn’t burned, it was eviscerated.
“It’s just,” she sighed, “we’ve seen a lot of people walk in and out of your life. And each time they do, they take a little piece of you with them. I know you’re invested, I know you love them. I’m just worried about what will happen if they decide to leave too. I’m afraid there won’t be much of you left.”
he hissed in return, grabbing at Steve’s hip so they can grind their hips together. The pair parted, only long enough to shred the rest of their clothing. Tony marveled at the miles of Steve’s pale skin, littered with scars and memories of his battles and victories. He looked down at Tony, his blue eyes radiating in the glow of the arc reactor. He was so beautiful.
Tony nodded, but forced his eyes away from Steve. Acting on impulse, Steve reached over and grabbed Tony’s shoulder. “It’s not that I don’t wanna tell you, Tony. It’s just. It’s…it’s- ”
“No, but I think as business men we can pick up where we left off. Especially with the information I have for you.”
Stark's poker face remained unfazed, but Steve could feel his heart rate skyrocket through the muzzle of the gun pressed against his chest. "You didn't squeal."
Rumlow scoffed. “Why does it matter? We’ve got this one right here! Let’s just call the doc and finish this right here. I’m gonna bring him up to see- ”
Steve took a step towards Bucky, but was stopped by the man’s answering glare. He jerked his head over to Clint. Apparently, Bucky still wasn’t in the mood to deal with the news about Phil.
“That’s the spirit!” Steve said, grabbing Tony’s hand. “I’ll even let you choose which one next you want to look at.”
Clint had done as Steve asked, and called Thor. Thor, luckily enough, was in the states on business with his family anyway, and was more than happy to pay The Commandos a visit.
Steve smiled to himself, pressing a kiss into Tony’s dirty hair. He could still smell the rubble in his hair. He shivered with anticipation.
Like the fact that he was sitting bound in an old iron chair, staring up at what Tony assumed to be some mob man’s muscle.
Barton however, remained unimpressed, staring at Tony with a blank face. “I haven’t been myself,” the man answered quietly. “I’m glad you’re back, though. The team is stronger with you here.” Tony could see the door starting to shut on his face so he stumbled forward, stopping it.
“Don’t,” he interrupted. “I know what you’re going to say. It wasn’t your fault; you couldn’t have known that would happen.”
Clint had laughed. He didn’t really think that part through, but he knew that Phil knew that. There was a part of him that thought he didn’t need to bother because no matter what he did, he’d never see Phil again. A part of him that Phil constantly proved wrong.
Tony glared at the door one last time, before turning his attention back to Coulson. “Who are they? The ones that are so powerful that have you quivering in your boots.” Tony paused. “Is it HYDRA? Did Pierce- ”
It was a short drive, but tense; the air was almost cackling with tension from its inhabitants. Sam pulled up in front of the warehouse, the windows already lit up from gunfire. The van was barely in park before the team piled out, charging for the entrance before a spray of bullets had them diving behind large crates.
Steve could feel his blood start to boil. “Tony has been missing for days and the police don’t know about it. Are you telling me that you want the police to
Steve furrowed his brows. “What are you on about? Stop stalling. You want to do business? Fine. You call your men off of my family, and I will go with you and tell you anything you want to know. Simple as that. As long as you stay away from my crew I will keep feeding you information.”
was something to make him wary. Steve wasn’t sure how long it took him to acquire this special skill, but he was always able to tell what kind of mood Bucky was in based on how he said his name. Years of companionship had given Steve ample instances to here it every which way. Whether it was carried with a certain lightness as Bucky grasped at his sides as he laughed at Steve’s joke, or weighed down with anger, as the brunette pulled Steve out of another side street gutter to take him home and get him patched up. Or when it was engulfed by terrified desperation, the broken cry sounding over a crackling radio as bombs blew up around them.
to drop everything and go to Paris with him just because Tony thought anything New York had to offer simply wasn’t good enough. Tony then finally caved and, rambling about how Pepper had talked up the MET’s latest exhibit at the office, asked if Steve would like to go see it on Friday. The way Steve’s face lit up at the suggestion made Tony mentally promise Rhodey a dozen new upgrades for his suit.
Sam and Bucky’s only comment was “Frodo is a better name than Monet,” so, all things considered, it went pretty smoothly.
The room is dark, lightened only by the reactor’s glow, and the realization makes Steve’s heart feel so tight he can’t breathe.
Tony scoffed. “I know you did,” he said, and he probably seemed incredibly dismissive, saying that and looking at the elevator and not at Steve, but that was probably for the best. Safer.
Stark hesitates, his lips pressed together. He looks at Steve as if his offer is dangerous – as if the entirety of him is. Steve frowns.
“Hi,” he said dumbly, and then, like an idiot, he turned his back to Steve and started walking in the direction of the elevator.
Steve’s hand caresses his torso, climbing up towards his chest. Tony’s heart rushes as he feels the weight of Steve’s palm over his shirt, just a thin fabric separating it from the reactor.
“Don’t make me cry,” Tony quips. Then, because this isn’t the real Barnes, and no one will ever know he said this, he adds: “Thank you.”
The offended one scoffed. “I should hope not,” he said, turning to Tony. “We’ll see you at the meeting.”
“I am being serious. Nothing says ‘happy couple’ more than being inappropriate in public. Besides, hey, better me than her, right?” He raised one eyebrow, not willing to let Steve reply. “Maybe we should try nicknames. You’ll be ‘sugar plum’, and I’ll be—”
– going out for a movie with Steve, holding his hand, kissing him after the night is over, asking if he wants to come up to the penthouse… If you ask Tony, there’s an entire universe of distance between these two ideas. They’re barely in the same astral plane.
He kept the massage focused on Steve’s upper body for a while, raising both hands to the back of Steve’s neck to firmly press his fingers, one by one, against Steve’s skin. Steve felt as if his neck was being elongated, relief climbing to his head and spreading all over his body.
Tony’s eyes softened, leaning into Steve’s touch. “Yeah, Steve. I’m not going anywhere. Not this time.” Steve would have been lying if he hadn’t shuddered when Tony used his real name. “Besides, there’s only one way we’re gonna beat these guys.”
Clint looked over at Tony. Of course Tony would figure it out. Clint tried to curl himself into a smaller ball. Getting chewed out by Steve was bad enough, but no one was as bad as Tony. Tony was a spit fire; the sharp businessman could reduce anyone to a quivering mess in seconds. Clint wasn’t going to make it out of here alive.
“No, you’re not giving up yet.” Sam sat down in front of him, forcing Steve to meet his eyes. “You’re not thinking clearly, Steve. You know this isn’t right.”
So if getting shot was what it takes to get back in the game, why not? It’s not like he hadn’t done anything worse to get less, and Tony’s always been one for the dramatic flair. Tony couldn’t help but silently preen whenever The Captain shot him some guilt ridden faces as he helped him back to their base. It was almost comical how wide his eyes were, the poor man twitching at every small groan Tony made. Plus, Tony was almost positive that he would have gotten a hard on when the man picked him up like he weighed nothing. That is, if it weren’t from the blood loss that he was experiencing at the time.
“Thank you,” Tony grinned, hopping off the bead and heading for the door. Barnes reached out and grabbed his elbow.
Hill glanced nervously at the window, staring blankly at the bright day outside. “When you finally managed to get a lock on the third helicarrier, you….. well, you were late.”
It was Hill, Fury’s right hand woman. She could sniff out anyone, no matter how well they were hiding. Tony letting her into his house was definitely not a good thing.
Clint thought. Around here, it didn’t matter what he wore. One step through the doorway and folks would know that he wasn’t from around here.
But today wasn't a compete victory for them. Last time, Steve hadn't seen the full picture until it was too late. He hadn't seen what HYDRA was truly capable of until it was too late. But this time, they'd shown their hand too early. If this is what they're willing to resort to, then the storm coming is far worse than what he'd imagined. But at least he's seen it coming, this time. He could protect them, this time.
Steve laughed softly before collapsing on the bed, smelling in the acquainted smells of his team, his eyes already drifting shut. He could vaguely hear Bucky push another bed next to him before clambering on top.
They both collapsed onto the sheets, neither man making a move to pull away from each other. Steve felt himself drifting asleep, so he curled protectively around Tony, pressing a small kiss to the back of Tony’s neck.
“Of course,” soothed Yinsen. “I can do my job without it. Mr. Stark has assured me that you are all good people. That is good enough for me.”
“Well, Mr. Stark. If you’re going to think of a plan, I suggest you do it fast, because it won’t be long before they bring in another hat. With the head still attached.”
“Then you’re going to have to be a little more specific, Buck,” Steve sighed. “Because I don’t know what you’re talkin’ about.”
“You’ll have to forgive me,” muttered Pepper. “It’s just a little hard for me to wrap my head around this. I mean, shootings and bombs? The Tony Stark I work for may deal with mobs, but he steers clear of anything that could be considered that messy.”
Tony had just spent countless hours with these people. He didn’t even know what day it was. Well, he wouldn’t know that anyway, but that wasn’t the point. The point was, was that Tony had gone off grid for a large amount of time. Pepper would be pissed. And that’s not even getting started on Obie.
Steve remembered cradling her lifeless body against his, sobbing into soft hair, cheek pressed against chilled skin. He remembered porcelain skin, lips stained the same color as her blood, and eyes – eyes once bright and full of life gone, clouded by a dull substitute.
Loki panted, his mind working slowly as exhaustion caught up with him. The tunnels that Barton led him through were twisted, the man seemingly taking random turns as if to throw off their tails. “Eventually,” Loki finally answered. “They all want the same thing, but for different reasons. How long before they realize they don’t need the other?”
“To what? Get in your way?” Tony’s eyes lit up angrily, his chestnut orbs looking almost like molten amber as he fumed at Steve.
Clint was speechless. Pepper had just ripped him a new one. It was like getting his ass handed to him by a middle school teacher. Except Clint had a feeling that this was worse.
Steve couldn’t help it this time, deep belly laughs emanating from his chest, Tony joining in with him. They laid there for hours, Tony talking,
“Oh, Phil! I’m sorry, I, uh- ” Steve broke off when he looked down at the state of his clothing, the dirty outfit covered in blood from the job as well as his latest art project with Thor.
Steve smiled back at the smaller man. “Look at the bright side. My life surely wouldn’t be as interesting.”
Steve sighed before slowly starting to trudge down the road. He could call for a ride, but given his current predicament, he opted against it.
Thor whipped around to find Clint Barton staring at him, a hand stretched out with a small glass of liquor.
Steve shook his head and chuckled, nosing into Tony’s hair, the smell of his shampoo mixing with the scent of bonfire. “People can make their S’mores however they like. I just like mine a little crispy.”
“I wouldn’t count on it,” Natasha replied with a sharp smile. Not with Sam on the loose upstairs. “It’s over.”
Dragging Steve back to the car was painstakingly slow, what with Steve’s weight and Barnes' own stumbling. When they finally reached the vehicle, they laid Steve in the back, Tony tucking his jacket over him again before crawling in behind him.
Tony led them further in, through the kitchen and past the freezers, and into a cramped storage area. The team stepped lightly, trying to walk over cleaning supplies and other storage items. “I suppose there’s a reason we’re all crammed back here?” Clint sighed.
“But I also know that I can’t make you do that. I can’t do that to you; I can’t use Steve against you. I won’t. If you won’t tell Steve, I swear to you that I’ll go back and tell him myself. You won’t have to get involved, hell, you don’t have to see me or any one of us ever again. So I’ll let you decide. It’s your choice.”
Steve had been so lost in his own head, he wasn’t surprised when he found himself alone on the common floor.
Bucky’s eyes darted between the pair of them, working out what Steve had said. “You’ve been at the same safe house?”
That’s what made Tony so powerful, how he knew that he was Iron Man. Tony’s TK was special, his mind able to control metal, use it to advantage, even the tiniest of scraps. There were pieces of metal in almost anything, including the human body.
Barnes obliged, quickly stopping the car along a beachfront lot. The two men scurried out, their eyes already looking out at the river. Tony looked down at the ice with concern. “You think he’s out there?”
Tony closed his eyes, tamping down the waves of betrayal crashing around insides him. After the gala and the meeting with Fury, it was impossible to deny, but this was the final nail in the coffin. Obie was everything to him – hell, he was more of a father to him than his own dad was. He never yelled at him, never called his ideas stupid, just said “Keep on building, son. All ideas are worth a chance.” Now, Tony could see behind the curtain – was he always just a meal ticket for him? What would Dad say if he saw him now? Did Dad know?
Steve was reaching for him again, but he dodged, backing away towards the suit. Tony was on fire even as his body froze over, searing tears burning as they spilled out over his now ashen cheeks. “Tony,
Clint’s shoulders slumped, breaking eye contact with his manic boss; he didn’t have any answer for him. Clint couldn’t imagine what Steve was going through; thinking he was so close to getting Tony back, only to realize that he was still at square one. “I’m sorry,” he whispered. “They probably just got a bad tip.”
Bucky rolled his eyes. “Oh, your heart hurt? Well how do think I feel, asshole? My God, I’ve been awake for two seconds and we’re already talking about you, you conceited little- ”
Steve sighed in relief when they found the missing agents, all alive, with minimal scraps and bruising. The offices they were in had shielded them from the brunt force of the explosion.
Tony had been pleasantly surprised at Barton’s work. Of course, Tony knew how talented each of The Commandos were; he had compiled files on each and every one of them he knew about, but Tony still found himself impressed. Barton’s initial description of the guy was spot on, the large man in front of him screamed ex-military and gun-for-hire. On top of that, Barton’s shot with his bow,
Steve saw the wave of surprise that washed over Tony, quickly replaced with a small smile. Steve returned the smile easily, slowly rolling his hips.
Bruce, as always, just gave an embarrassed smile while readjusting his glasses. Stark, mouth still gaping open, turned back to Steve. “Bruce Banner?
They were silent for a few moments, Tony syncing up with the deep breaths echoing out of the chest he leaned against, Steve’s calloused digits sinking into his hair.
Which is how Steve found himself in Tony’s office three days later. When Tony never called him after the incident, Steve took it upon himself to reach back out. Using his old disguise from the weapons demonstration, Steve had walked back into SI donning a fake military uniform, claiming to have a meeting with Tony Stark. A few lies and innocent smiles at a blushing receptionist, and Steve was in.
Steve's voice sounded off right next to him, causing him to jump. There was no way he could have been that close unless he was stalking the outside of the room like a worried mother.
Steve could hear pounding in his ear, feeling as if he’d been thrust back in the frozen tundra. “What are you saying?” he asked quietly.
It was the modern day Cold War; each side was just waiting for the other to make a move before striking themselves.
“Clint,” Bucky hissed as they started to move towards the pair lying in the middle of the street. “We need to go.”
“You too,” he whispered against the brunette’s lips before the man was gone, scampering out of the room. Steve frowned as he watched him leave before walking over to his desk to grab his gun.
Steve just sighed, not bothering to call him out on his tone. "Just give him time. He'll come around."
So of course Rhodey was at the meeting, winning over the last few skeptical parties for today's deal. He was always better at sweet talking the brass than Tony was.
The room was silent besides the nervous tapping of Tony’s foot against the hard floor of The Commando’s base. He couldn’t remember how long he had been sitting in front of his computers, screening for people accessing his hidden virus. JARVIS was running the back trace now; it shouldn’t be too much longer before Tony had a location.
Everyone thought of Captain America and thought of purity; the figure head that always knew right from wrong. A national icon. A hero. How wrong they all were.
“It’s alright, I’m here now," Natasha's voice filtered through his head. "You’ve held them all up for the past month. It’s my turn to help now.”
Hearing Steve’s voice made the brunette crumple, both him and Clint falling to the floor. Another voice shouted to get Bruce, no doubt seeing the blood leak out from Clint’s head.
I will try keep up with my 10 day spectrum for posting a new chapter, but if I go over a few days don't worry! I either just have writer's block, or I'm stuck trying to optimize modern control systems. Or both. It's probably both.
everyone, as Steve looked back over at Bucky, who had pushed himself into a corner, crossed his arms and locked his jaw, pretending to sleep. Steve knew what Tony was doing, and he knew that
“I’m above your laws.” Fury reached into his pocket, flipping out his wallet. A quick flick of the wrist and Phil found himself staring widely at engraved letters gleaming on a square of gold.
“Sam,” Steve scolded. He could see in the blonde’s face that there were lists of things he wanted to ask him but wasn’t sure where to start. “How are you?” he finally settled on.
“You’re kidding me, right?” snapped Stark, as he threw Steve another clip. “You were using a barrel lid for cover, Cap.
Steve’s jaw ticked. “If you’ve read my reports, then you’ll know that it brings me nothing but trouble.”
“If we aim them at each other, the beams with join, condensing and collapsing on itself to create a small explosion.”
Steve stared into the cavernous room, the flickering lights flashing evidence of disaster right back in his face.
He wasn’t exactly sure what his plan was when he walked into 1 Police Plaza. The NYPD headquarters was teeming with both security and tourists. Not to mention that all of the employees the building housed were experienced police officers. No, he couldn’t exactly walk up to the receptionist and ask for a walk-in with New York’s Police Commissioner.
Silence descended between the two. She could tell he wasn’t happy, but were any of them? This was a call that she’d made last night; it was something that needed to be done, regardless of whether or not everyone else was on board with it. Funny, how Steve and Tony had sat in this very room to barter for all of their lives, and her she was, not twenty-four hours later, potentially undoing the whole thing.
Thankfully, the hulking blonde appeared, looking just as pale as they did against the fire. “Take him,” Clint snapped, Thor quickly hastening to respond. “I need you to get him out of here,” Clint continued, watching as Steve flailed uselessly in Thor’s arms.
This was a man’s life, The Captain’s best friend. Tony knew he would be tearing up the entire state looking for Rhodey. He could do the man one final decency. Besides, with The Commandos so focused on Barnes, it would be the perfect opportunity for Tony to slip right through his fingers for good.
Three sharp knocks rapped against his apartment door, and Steve jolted, his free hand already reaching for the gun he knew wasn’t there.
Steve took off into a sprint, retracing his steps until he found his way back to his car. Typing in his destination to his GPS, Steve put the car back in auto-drive as he changed back into his tux.
“Now, look,” Tony explained. “I will be gone for two hours at most. If I’m not back by then, I give you pull permission to send Kujo after me,” he said with a nod towards Barnes. “Just let me go, Steve. I promise, I’ll be fine.”
When he finally spun around, he paused, taking in the woman in front of him. She was beautiful, crystal eyes with blonde hair pinned perfectly, dressed in a glittering gown that accented hear deadly curves. She was exactly the type of woman he would usually go for – for a time that seemed like an entire lifetime ago. In fact, by the way she was looking at him, the more he thought that he had already make a move in the past. He peeked down at her manicured hands and –
Steve stared at the ceiling. Natasha walked over to him, and straddled him. She tried to take off Steve’s shirt, but he stopped him.
But, it turns out God just liked to continue to fuck him over, as Tony was about five blocks downwind when he realized he’d left his briefcase back in the cemetery.
“Clint Barton,” Fury continued, “who is a known constituent of The Captain. You see, I had it all wrong. You weren’t helping Stark because you were friends with him, you were helping the man because you were friends with The Commandos.”
Sometimes it still surprised Steve, finding himself in moments like these. To be honest, when he was awakened from the ice, he was certain that he would never find a sense of happiness again. But it had been a few weeks since he and the rest of The Avengers had moved into Stark Tower, and Steve had finally found peace. It was weird at first; each of them were so different, it was almost impossible to see any of them working together, let alone living together. But they all fit, each member a unique puzzle piece seamlessly creating the perfect picture, the perfect team. Steve found footing with them, like they were his own personal lighthouses for when he found himself lost in the abyss of his memories. The funny thing is, Steve could find himself a new family here. A new home.
No point dwelling on it. All he could do now is count the minutes until Tony returned. As much as it would hurt him, they needed to finish their conversation about Fury. A throat clearing caught his attention.
“Take it slow buddy. Takes a junkie to know a junkie. I’ll give you the morning to rest but then you need to get the hell off my property.”
“An obligation that, if I remember correctly, wasn’t my idea,” Tony barked back, instantly regretting that words as they slipped from his mouth. Even if Peter had never been on his radar before, there was now no life that Tony could picture without him.
Curling his hands around the steaming mug, Tony strolled through the rest of the kitchen and opened the door onto the back patio. The first step into the open air always came with a blast of frigid air – his second alarm clock, he liked to call it. There was no snow on the ground – the chance of that was few and far between – but even the South was not immune to the cold grip of Winter’s fist. And in the mornings, before the sun could start to peek out behind the wooded surroundings, the breeze was a merciless as it was in New York.
Steve finally peeled his eyes away from the wall, glancing over at the other man. He looked tired, but then again, they all were.
“Fuck,” Tony moaned, rubbing a hand over his face. “You’re playing with fire here, Phil. This better not blow up in our faces.”
Fury stared at him hard for a long moment. “Fine, we can come back to it. There are more pressing matters to deal with.”
But now, watching as Steve returned from down the hall and slip an arm around Tony as he ushered him over to the couch, smiling gratefully as the brunette offered him a sip of his coffee, Sam couldn’t help but notice that a few of those holes had been filled.
“Pepper,” Tony placated. “Look at him,” he continued, pointing to Barnes. “He wants me to come with probably as much as you want me to go. But this is something they need me for.”
Tony giggled, ignoring the protests from his chest, and then he was laughing, unable to stop the abhorrent noises from escaping. He could hear faint shouting, no doubt the FBI rushing in to ‘save the day’.
Tony felt Clint scratch the top of his head. “Whatever you say, Mom,” he whispered. Tony barely heard the man slip through the door before he was already out.
So Barnes had sat quietly the entire ride, listen to Tony sob out his recent blunder with Phil. He stayed silent well after they’d gotten to the lab, Tony’s guilt getting the best of him, forcing him to tinker with something to alleviate some of the stress.
"Not much," answered Obie. "There weren't any weapons laying around, so the shipping containers took the brunt of the attack. Damages like that can be replaced."
“Because you were too busy moping over your crush,” Bucky chided. “Once again, I’m the one who has to swoop in and do all the goddamn work for you lovesick teenagers.”
“Hell, yes!” Tony cried, pumping a fist in the air. “Sorry, Pep, you’ll have to give my regards to the board. The world needs Iron Man right now. Score one for international terrorism.” Tony winced, looking over at Steve. “Probably could have phrased that a little better.”
“Fuck you,” Clint hissed. “I’m not leaving him again.” He tore out of Tony’s grasp, sprinting towards SI, Tony unable to do anything but follow.
Tony shot her another winning smile, but it came out more like a grimace, each heart beat sending waves of pain through his body. “Wilson,” Tony gasped.
Steve snapped his head towards Tony, blue eyes piercing into brown. Tony stared right on back, his eyes soft, a shy smile gracing his lips. Without thinking twice, Steve rushed to the other man, sweeping him in a tight hug. It was so easy to just wrap his arms around the smaller frame and bury his face into Tony’s neck, the man smelling of overpriced shampoo with a feint undertone of metal. All words that he could have thought of were thrown out the window when he felt Tony’s hands hesitantly grasp him back, Steve making sure to squeeze him tighter in reassurance.
Mind made up, he changed course, slipping into the far door, quickly scanning the room to find the showers empty. It wasn’t a surprise of course, as there wasn’t anyone else in the speakeasy except for Bucky, Tony, and Clint.
a cabin – Steve had wondered how they would make the switch into a more stagnant schedule. He waited for the growing tension. Sure, he and Tony had already been living together, but each day was another job, another fight, and was more than enough to keep them busy. And it wasn’t as if he and Tony had a lot in common, or shared life experience for that matter.
Barton sighed, his shoulders slumping in defeat. “This is why Nat should have taken care of this. I’m saying I was wrong, dickhead. That we were wrong. About you.”
“What do you think?” The man grinned, obviously proud; a smile that suited nothing but a dragon, showing off his horde.
Clint sighed and looked back up to Thor. “I can never forgive your brother for what he did to me, the team, the world. But the least I can do is thank him for being part of the reason you’re still here today.”
Tony’s mind was in overdrive. It was one thing to be in a one-on-one with The Captain, but this was something else entirely. The Captain doesn’t get nervous; he’s one of the most powerful mob bosses in New York. He doesn’t get nervous. He
Steve’s face softened, leaning forward enough to knock their heads together. Tony’s eyes slipped shut again and he breathed deep, shivering as Steve’s hands trailed through his hair. Tony trailed his own over Steve’s chest, curling them around his neck to feel the steady pulse. He wasn’t sure how long they stood there, sharing each other’s warmth. Loud footsteps sounded through the hall and the pair startled, the moment shattered by the harsh reminder of their current predicament.
Pierce sighed, knowing that yet again, The Monger was right. He had put more men out recently after the Rumlow debacle to try and keep up with The Captain and Stark again, even to try and look into the other members, but to no avail. The Captain was keeping them close. “For how long?” he asked, rubbing at his aching temple.
he had mouthed to his friend, not quite wanting to leave Tony’s side yet. But eventually, after looking back down at Tony’s frail body, Steve knew it was time to get off his ass and go kick some instead.
Pierce had implanted the use of the cyanide pills not too long ago. With such sensitive information him and his men were working with, there was no way they could let anyone get their hands on it. It was quick and easy, not to mention a perfect way to test loyalties.
“That was Tasha. Beattie wasn’t there but they think he was there with someone else at some point. Stark’s already looking into video footage from outside, so maybe we’ll catch a break.”
It worked the same way for Clint. Steve’s heart would always break a little when Clint would just gape at him when Steve agreed with his field strategies. It was if the archer had no idea why anyone would take his recommendation, use his maneuvers. Which was completely ridiculous. If anything, Clint Barton was the most skilled tactician Steve had ever had the pleasure of knowing. Steve would go down to Tony’s lab, just to watch him and Clint bicker over Clint’s arrows. Clint would always tell Tony exactly what he needed, what would work, what wouldn’t. In fact, there had been a couple times where Clint had just looked at an arrow made by Tony, and just shook his head.
Amand had found out about his brother’s death. Of course, he couldn’t tell his sister and mother, because they were dead as well. From the bombing in Dresden. How Amand survived was a miracle. The war cost him everything: his family, his home, his life.
Tony hummed, sinking into the expansive bed, Steve following quickly, accepting every kiss that came his way. He could feel Steve peel away the layers of his clothing, not leaving a single stretch of naked skin without a peck in his wake. They curled around each other, soaking up the other’s warmth.
“You have way too many mugs and they all have puns on them, but I love that when you pick a new one out, you smile as you read it, like it’s funny to you every single time,” said Steve.
Now that Steve was getting healthier, Tony started to notice how perfect he was. He was a monster of a man, with huge, tight muscles that could make anyone swoon. His sun kissed hair flowed easily in the breeze, and he had eyes that could rival the clearest ocean. But Steve’s smile? It was so bright and easy, Tony swore he hears angels sing.
Weeks passed; Steve gave Clint more jobs, Clint returning with more information, not even stumbling in his work when he found out more about Steve's background.
Stark hissed. “Well, excuse the fuck out of me. Who am I to disrupt Grandpa’s Sunday afternoon drive? You can go ahead and tell your chauffer that he best
Steve couldn’t help the laugh that escaped his lips, but he quickly muffled it when he saw Stark’s jaw tighten.
In the end, they decided to waste the money immediately, spending it all on a small ice cream cake from a gas station a few blocks over. The four of them stood there in the parking lot, crowded around the melting cake, their plastic forks fighting for another scoop. Clint got the majority of his ice cream on his face, Bucky stained Nat’s shirt, and in retaliation, she shoved her fork into his prosthetic. And Steve? It was the happiest he’d been in a very long time.
During those times, Clint had seen ‘the Captain’ disappear behind Steve Rogers, leaving nothing but a lost kid from Brooklyn, nothing but a broken shell of a man.
It was unlike Tony to be so hyped up on energy after a flight, no matter how involved it was. None of them usually were. Regardless of how strenuous the mission was, adrenaline would eventually crash, and they’d spend any journey back lounging, reading, resting, and such. Today was different, as Tony bounced around the jet like a popcorn cooking, much to everyone’s amusement. Well,
Steve snorted as he buried himself closer into Tony’s embrace. “No you wouldn’t. You’d get bored out of your mind.”
Tony shivered, plastering himself against Steve. "Sounds enticing. Although I'm sure the whole damsel in distress thing has its perks as well."
“This was his doing,” Natasha said, walking over to Loki’s cot. “You left your phone down here, Thor,” she continued, pointing to the sleek tech left on the table. “He got one his lackeys to spread the tip. The twins overheard it, and he just sat back and waited until he left.”
Instead of another teasing remark, Steve leaned down and kissed him soundly. “Can’t help it,” he said as he pulled away. “The way you feel, the sounds you’re making? God, it’s incredible.”
Steve finally pulled into the driveway as the sun was just starting to dip behind the neighborhood’s houses. A pounding headache throbbed against his skull, his ears still ringing from the incessant car horns and screeching tires of rush hour.
“Exactly what I was thinking,” Steve replied. “Let me take you out? I did promise you a date, didn’t I?”
Looking back up, Tony’s heart stopped. Across the sprawling lawn, he thought he saw someone over by the trees. Dropping his latest invention, Tony picked up his repulsor, and started to walk over to the back forest.
He gave it all to you. And you failed. I could have protected them; I could have done what you couldn’t. But he chose you. And you took them all away.”
Clint was getting antsy. It had been over a month and he had made no progress. This was not a good sign. The other eight are still out there, just waiting for their moment to pounce on the Avengers. Clint needed to find some answers before another one acts.
“So, tell me,” Barton snapped, jogging next to him. “Why the hell were you looking at those files? I could’ve gotten hands on them.”
It didn’t matter. He'd tried, he'd tried his damnedest, but there were just too many, and with any form of protection only on his hands, it wasn't long before Tony was out-manned.
“At least until after another check in with the fuzz,” Tony said with a shrug. “If your handler doesn’t act like anything’s off at your next meeting, then you should be good. I just don’t want to risk anything.”
“Look,” Steve sighed. “We can play this game all day, just sitting around trying to one-up each other with what we know. But this is a waste of all of our efforts. You know that we wouldn’t be here if we didn’t need something from you,” he continued, looking at Fury. “Just as we know you’d never agree to having a meeting with you us without immediate arrest if you didn’t need something from us.”
“Stay safe Tony.” The Captain says with a nod before disappearing and Tony can’t help but stare after the man like a swooning school girl because that was the first time the Captain had said his name.
Steve nodded as he settled on his new bunk and gently set down the leather carrier he kept his sketchbooks in.
“Of course.” Tony agreed despite the million things he should be doing instead of sitting by the blond’s bedside.
Still he hadn’t expected it to actually happen because the people who were likely to try something also knew that he was close to the Captain. For a lot of people that had seemed to be deterrent enough but whoever was following him wasn’t included in that group. As he walked through a crowd of tourists on his way to work, he found himself surrounded by people and with a gun carefully hidden pressed into his back.
Tony had been kidnapped before Steve had been able to get Tony alone to tell him the truth and now he had no fucking idea where the other man was.
“Hey,” Tony says, stopping them both and cupping Steve’s face with his hands. “You weren’t embarrassing yourself. It was a new experience, and I should have prepared you better, and, again, they’re kids, they don’t mean anything by it. Next morning they’ll already have forgotten all about—why are you looking at me like that?”
, really, because he knew what he was doing, couldn’t pretend he didn’t, as tempting as it was to blame it all on Stark, on his gentle smile and his warm voice and his… eyes. No, he couldn’t do it, because at the end he was being drawn to the warmth of Stark’s body, approaching his side of the bed like a moth to a flame, and as aware of the risk as one would be.
“Sure, sure,” Steve doesn’t sound like he believes it, but his voice is amused, as if he thinks Tony’s just being modest. “Anyway – I thought we could have a day in, then. I finished the paperwork with the latest mission reports yesterday.”
Rhodey doesn’t laugh. Instead he finishes placing the electrodes and sets his hand on Tony’s shoulder, letting him lie down again. “We’re ready to go.”
He’s not looking at Rhodey, but he knows Rhodey must make a face as he comes inside. Tony doesn’t blame him: it must be a somber sight, himself sitting at his worktable looking through endless data, some armor pieces scattered around in front of him, the only other living soul asleep in the center of the room.
Steve draws in a sharp breath. He thinks he gets what Tony is trying to do, now, and the overwhelming generosity of the gesture is such that he feels as if he owes it to him to stare in his eyes before answering: “I’d probably only embarrass myself.”
There’s a moment of silence, where Tony studies Steve’s face. His eyelashes, his beard. The freckle under his eyebrow Tony has never noticed before, despite having silently watched that face for so many years. It’s the tiniest freckle.
“Gorgeous,” he says, his voice hoarse. Steve blushes hot, can only imagine how he looks now, shirtless and exposed, his flush descending down his chest. “Baby, are you sure you—”
He asked that question a lot, Steve noticed. And he couldn’t bring himself to explain that yes, it was – everything was so much more than okay, and Steve’s heartbeat was steadying, and the images of the desert never seemed so distant.
Rogers then presses his mouth in a thin line, and even from the throne, Howard can see how his jaw clenches.
Tony shifted. He opened and closed his hands nervously, at a complete loss for what to do. Steve wasn’t—He
“Thank you,” Tony replied, because faking nonchalance was a good way to not let his own growing anxiety show. He noticed he had frozen mid-motion of putting food on his plate, and he hurried to finish it.
He can’t see Steve’s face, but he imagines he’s closing his eyes to sleep, and he wonders if he’s got that same peaceful expression Tony saw in his workshop, when he was imagining what could Steve be seeing to make him so happy.
“I’m afraid not yet, my lord,” Obadiah’s voice sounds compassionate, but there’s a glimmer in his eyes that leave no doubt this is the moment he’s been waiting for all night. “The rebels sent a raven to the city walls last night. Captain Rogers has requested an audience with you.”
“I missed you,” Tony says, and that, that comes out easily, even if it seems like Steve barely registers it, taken over by the despair of the realization. Tony holds his chin, gently pushes his face towards him. “God, I missed you so much.”
, years ago, when they started out this thing without words, which, at surface level, made sense, because words would have made it real.
Dummy stayed firmly over Steve’s thigh. Steve reached over his head to turn the living room’s lamp off. Normally, he didn’t like to sleep on his back, but today he was already resigned to this fate.
. Tony usually feels overwhelmed by the sheer number of feelings he’s capable of feeling at once - Steve, on the other hand, seems to always have one primary feeling for every situation, and he can grab onto it and make it his solid, unshakable stance. This is what makes him so amazing to watch and so infuriating to fight with. This, Tony realizes, is what would make it such a monumental experience, to be loved by him.
the situation in his boxers, at all. “It’s too confusing. Isn’t there something else we can call you? Anthony?”
“What?” The man said. “Oh, do you mean, the other dog?” His face twisted in a weird expression. “I… don’t know.”
“Right,” Tony said, his knees going weak. So, so much blue. “And I’m famous for being a man of few words. You know, all stoic, serious hero. No time for quips.” He brought one hand to Steve’s forehead, swiping back a lock of fine hair. “Except for my romantic speeches. I—I heard those are pretty great.”
