It stings, but it’s not entirely unexpected, and so he can’t stop himself demanding a reason, hoping that Dean will let him in this time. He was ready to be just friends with Dean, but now that’s being taken from him, too. “Why not? Why not, if we both want that?”
“My parents figured it out when I was like two or three, but I don’t remember ever not knowing. I used to get frustrated with the other kids because I used to just know things that they took ages to figure out, and then I’d get mad when they didn’t want to play with me anymore.”
“Don’t worry ‘bout me, I’m good. I got my man to bring me breakfast, after all.” He leans in and gives Castiel a kiss, which makes him smile.
“In the kitchen,” Cas calls back, and Charlie’s cheerful face comes into view, and she’s carrying a bag of Twizzlers. God bless that girl, Dean thinks. She knows what candy doesn’t make him feel sick to just think about: Twizzlers are awesome, and  Snickers can get fucked. Who needs that much shit in a candy bar, anyway?
Henrickson isn’t able to get into contact with John Winchester, but he leaves a voicemail insisting that he call back.
Oh. “Uh, no. Dad’s at work. He’ll meet us at home, though,” Mrs. Freeman sort of frowns at that, but doesn’t say anything.
“Must be having a hard time right now. Sam said he’s had a few off days.” There’s a long pause, and then she continues. “Not sure if there’s much we can do. It’s not like with—” she glances towards Dean, “—his last Guides. These two aren’t even together.”
“Did you bring it home, or something?” That sounds like something Cas would do, actually. Like that time they found the hurt bird and Castiel made them take it to the vet and they ended up paying for the bird to be put down, because “it would be cruel to do otherwise, Dean.”
“We’ve decided that you may continue to live with us for the remainder of the school year, so long as you agree to meet with Pastor Zachariah three times per week. If your decision to disobey your family and go against our wishes continues after you graduate from high school, you will no longer be welcome in our home. You will be home every night for dinner unless you are with the Pastor. You will not go out with friends. Are we clear?”
He pulls up to the emergency department shouting for help. A couple of orderlies see Dean’s condition, and one goes in to grab a nurse and a gurney.
“No, I think we’re right where we need to be,” Cas replies, irritation warring with something on his face that Dean might describe as pity, “you don’t think I want to touch you, even though I do because someone taught you that you’d what? Ruin someone just by touching them—”
Dean’s voice is hoarse and his words a little slurry when he responds. “Can’t even keep a regular girlfriend around, how’m I s’posed to keep a Guide around? I’m not gonna be able to, and he’s gonna leave.”
“Sleep would keep you going, too,” Cas frowns even more at him. “As would more food. You’re going to make yourself sick.”
A moment later, Dean whispers, “Sam’s gonna want to know a lot of stuff I don’t talk about. Ever.” Castiel nods. It sounds as though Sam is going to ask a lot of questions tomorrow, and he’s not going to accept platitudes. There’s silence for a while.
. To Castiel, he seems a moment from breaking down entirely, and Castiel can’t blame him. Dean is tense, eyes wide and confused, and when Castiel takes a stuttering step towards him, Dean takes a step back. The spell keeping them still and their eyes locked breaks, and Dean puts both his hands up in front of his chest in a motion that’s clearly telling Castiel to halt in his hesitant move forwards. His hands are trembling, and it makes Castiel want to grab them and soothe him until they stop. He forces himself to be still, so as not to startle the Sentinel in front of him.
He hears Cas’s quick gasp and knows that he must feel his panic. There’s no suppressing whatever he’s throwing out into the world right now, Dean has just enough brainpower to mentally apologize for the pain he might be causing Cas by doing this, but he has to stop the zone somehow. He hears Cas’s rapid footsteps coming towards him, around the bed, and throws his arm out to stop him before he reaches Dean.
Dean turns to face him, finally. “Of course you are!” He’s beginning to be annoyed that Cas is playing dumb. Aren’t Guides perceptive? Dean thought they were supposed to be able to feel people, or whatever. Cas certainly knows what Dean is feeling often enough, so why isn’t he catching on? “And you should be! I led you on, I know I told you we shouldn’t Bond, but I let you think there was hope, even though I knew there was no way in hell you should be Bonded to me. I let you stick around, even though I should’ve told you to go and find a Sentinel that would be better suited. You need a better Sentinel. I have to take fucking Sensinull to deal with being such a piece of shit, I’m not a good Sentinel, I’m not good—“
“Dean, I need you to try to stay awake for me.” Dean nods slightly, visibly making an effort to focus on Castiel. “Do you know how long you’ve been taking the higher dose?” Dean gives another slight nod and then points weakly at Castiel, who stares back, nonplussed. “Dean?”
They get distracted for a moment when Dean leans over to Cas to give him a good morning kiss, and it goes on for longer than they planned, but Dean considers this worth the distraction.
Dean jumps into it, false energy from the coffee loaded up with sugar he drank on the way to the appointment beginning to hit him. Bobby’s look of concern over Dean’s well-being doesn’t go away, but it does fade into the background as they begin to discuss Dean’s paper. He reviews Dean’s bibliography and admits that Dean is actually a bit farther ahead than he thought he’d be at this point, and to keep it up; he’s on track to be finished next spring, and then they can talk postdoc and employment.
He doesn’t look like other Guides, he knows. They tend to be outwardly emotional, a little touchy-feely. They make excellent counselors, social workers, and teachers, even those who become doctors tend towards general practice, especially with pediatrics. Not emergency medicine, and not surgery, as there is little personal connection to benefit those patients.
Dean squirms in his chair, and Castiel feels his extreme discomfort with the attention, so he turns to Jess. “You teach as well, correct? Sam never stops talking about you.” Dean’s relief at the spotlight being taken off him is palpable. At least, it is to Castiel.
Dean can tell that Sam is fuming, but he doesn’t know how to make it better. He’s at a loss, and he doesn’t know what to do. He knows that parents aren’t supposed to do the shit their dad did to him, but he knows that Dad did what he did so that Sam was safe.
Dean closes his eyes at the feeling of Cas pushing into him, holding his knee in the crook of his elbow, keeping him wide open. He slowly pushes in until his hips are flush against Dean’s backside. He leans down and kisses Dean, slow and dirty. Dean’s cock is leaking between his and Cas’ stomachs, but he can’t bring himself to even touch himself. He just wraps his hands around Cas’ arms and shoulders, gripping him and rolling his hips to encourage Cas to give him some friction, dammit.
Bobby puts out his hand, and Cas gives it a firm shake, looking Bobby square in the eyes while he does with a slight smile.
“Well, I move her around. Sometimes I like to drive out to where there’s no lights, but I don’t usually have time for that. Usually, I just park her wherever I can find space. Benny lets me park in the alley behind Recoult when I’m working the overnight shift.”
“Very good, sweetheart.” Dean smiles at the domesticity of it all, just like he does nearly every day at these mundane activities. Cas kisses her on the top of her head, her two bushy little buns getting in his way only a little.
A dozen cups of coffee and four hours later, Henrickson’s phone rings. Castiel sits bolt upright in his chair, eyes wide open while he hopes for news. He’s spoken to Sam and instructed him not to come down, but to wait at Recoult on the chance that someone calls, or stops in, or
“It’s not nothing, Cas. You know him. He’s traumatized. He’s not acting like himself, and I’m not sure what we can do besides make sure he knows we’re here for him.”
Tonight, John had been at the bar near their current pay-by-the-week rental, thinking about their situation. He reflects on his boys. Sammy, a year ahead in school of where he should be, and still getting advanced lessons in some subjects. That boy was going places. Dean was in advanced courses too, but John wasn’t convinced. When that school up in New York convinced him that Sam should skip a grade, he agreed, but he was skeptical of their assessment of Dean. That boy couldn’t get a lesson into that brain of his if it killed him. How long had John been trying to beat those lessons into him, and Dean keeps fucking up? Dean is lazy. He’s selfish. John sees how his son sometimes looks at other boys, too. No son of his looks at other men that way. He’s not having a goddamn faggot in his house. He’ll beat that shit out of him.
Castiel can’t even fathom it. Even when he was essentially disowned from his mother and father, he had a small trust to fall back on and an inheritance from an aunt who was mean to everyone but liked Castiel for some reason. Dean is intelligent, he earns good grades, and he is passionate about music, and helping people, and making sure that every move he makes is fair and right. Dean is righteous, and he doesn’t even know it.
“Okay, so I didn’t think this would happen, but we can still have dinner, right guys? You don’t have to like, bond right away?”
” he breathes out, and Sam seems to understand. Dean imagines he hears the ‘click’ of the situation registering in his brain, and Sam settles the weighted blanket back on top of his brother. He had been right that the weighted blanket was helpful, but it wasn’t enough to block the overload of everything else.
When Dean wakes up the next day, he’s not fine. It’s like everything his senses had been suppressing the day before has decided to remind him of its presence. He barely chokes down water all day (it’s too cold, too
, that doesn’t fit. Guides only care about Sentinels because they’re supposed to, in Dean’s experience, and from what Alastair told him. They can’t help it. They don’t care about the person, there’s no reason to. And there’s certainly no reason Castiel would care about Dean, in particular.
Dad leaves them alone again by the second week of December, and he doesn’t come back until after Christmas.
Dean walks along a footpath on his way to the library, contemplating a detour to the coffee cart near the science buildings; their muffins are pretty good when he's not feeling acute, but then decides against it. His thoughts wander as he continues on. His appetite has been low for several weeks, now. He's been relying on caffeine to get him through lectures, and he knows eating something will help him think better, appetite or not, maybe even help the migraine that's been building behind his eyes for the better part of the day… he's got a yoga class tonight so food is objectively a good idea. The top of the library building comes into view.
“When I say that I mean it, and not as hyperbole. In my line of work, it’s difficult not to. I’ve met some very weak Sentinels that didn’t even know about their abilities before they came to the ER, and I’ve met some incredibly strong ones, the first ones I ever resonated even a little bit with.” Cas swallows but continues speaking, watching Dean. “You’re right, in that I might find another Sentinel I resonate with. Someone stronger might come along. But I think you’re missing some essential pieces.
, either. Dean’s never actually met a Bonded pair, though he’s met plenty of Guides. And then there are people that don’t even need the full Bond to function; Sentinels that are so low-grade that they barely register on the spectrum who never experience a zone, and Guides who don’t even realize they’re Guides, they think they’re just very empathetic people.
Castiel is worried about Dean. He’s still not talking very much, and much of the food brought to him never leaves the plate. He feels like he’s watching Dean disintegrate, and he feels so entirely helpless to do anything about it. A few days after Dean comes home with him, he sits with Charlie while Dean sleeps in the next room.
All of these things and more, and Castiel doesn’t think Dean sees himself very clearly at all. The few things Castiel has heard about Dean’s father give him the impression that John Winchester isn’t a very pleasant man, emotionally abusive if not physically (and Castiel isn’t sure he believes Dean on that count), and even with how much Dean likes to brag about his brother Sam, Castiel doesn’t think Dean has seen him in a very long time. Dean deflects just about every question that digs deeper on the subject, and Dean constantly puts himself down. The man does
They eat their meals with some small talk in between. It turns out Cas’s brother is a chef at a ritzy club downtown, and his cousin Balthazar, who Cas talks about in a fondly irritated way, works in the same hospital as he does. His brother Michael is some kind of higher-up at what he calls a “mega-church” out of state.
Castiel mentally apologizes to Dean and then rests his hands on top of his friend’s. He positions himself as close as possible to the chair from the side of Dean’s desk, knees slotted together with Dean’s, face only inches away. He breathes in sync with the Sentinel and lets himself
Cas himself lives less than five minutes away by car. It would take Dean fifteen minutes to walk to his house. It’s practically a miracle they’ve never run into each other before, but now they can’t seem to stop. Besides this, Sam keeps showing up with him whenever their friends get together. And their friends like Cas, so Cas stays.
“Yeah. Turns out you were right to worry about the Sensinull, I guess. I was taking too much. It builds up, or somethin’. Turns out the dizzy spells and balance issues I’ve been havin’ were the side effects.”
“It’s got little pieces of metal on the ends! Leaves gorgeous scratches along your skin. I can’t wait to see it all flowing. You ready for more?”
“Uh, Dean? Everything okay?” Sam and Jess have frozen with them, clearly unsure of what’s happening. Cas can’t look away from Dean, but Dean is now looking away from him. He doesn’t dare take another step forward.
“I’m going to take such good care of you. I’ll carve you into something new, Deano. And when we’re done, you’re going to thank me.”
Dean blushes and looks away from Cas’s intense gaze, and Cas notices the freckles on Dean’s cheeks that he had seen fleetingly from a distance, but up close they’re nothing short of adorable. A moment later their gazes meet again. Cas is still holding Dean, and since Dean hasn’t pulled away yet, the discomfort must not be happening at the moment.
“Cas, man, this thing, it’s just—” Dean cuts himself off and Cas feels the tingly press of embarrassment from the Sentinel. “You gotta know I’ve been into you since we met.”
Charlie sends Dean a text message while he’s laying in his bed, his van parked in the Cabela’s parking lot after filling his freshwater tank for his sink. He immediately feels guilty for not keeping in touch with her more. He’s been busy working. And hanging out with Cas. And with school, obviously. He hasn’t had time to log onto World of Warcraft with Charlie for weeks.
“Uh, yeah? You think I can’t handle three glasses now, Cas? Which one of us works in a bar and a cafe, huh?”
They find the ice cream sandwich swing, and Dean gets an employee to take about a thousand pictures of them on the thing. They play with the magnetic letters in the cherry cloud spinner room, Dean spelling out “DEAN WAS HERE,” predictably, while Castiel attempts to find all of the letters for the chemical composition of honey.
“No, I don’t even want you trying to walk downstairs right now, your spatial awareness goes all haywire when you’re like this.”
“Now, now. Don’t get too excited. I had to switch to this metal chair for my next game, and it doesn’t let me secure your ankles. Don’t let me regret that. I don’t think you’d get very far, anyway.”
Still, even behind those barriers, they’ve made progress. Dean is less afraid to allow physical contact, as demonstrated by the way he’s pushing Cas against the wall of the shower to kiss him nearly senseless.
“You told Charlie it’s too hard,” talking makes Dean feel ridiculous. Speech isn’t supposed to take this much
“Yes, well,” Cas takes the glasses off of his head and slides them gently onto Dean’s face. He gives Dean a kiss on the cheek. Dean blushes. Even after two years together, Castiel’s random small reminders that he loves Dean come at a surprise sometimes.
Honestly, Charlie hasn’t really thought about it. But yeah, if it hurts to be hugged sometimes, she can’t imagine what sex must be like. Especially on Dean’s hypersensitive days. She remembers when Dean was doing the one-night stand thing. His slutty days, she called them. She had no idea he was in pain, oh
The night passes with Cas and Sam getting to know one another. Jo stops by to harass Sam (and she’s definitely grown into an attractive young woman, even if she
“Dude, everyone knows that. It’s not a spoiler when the movie is over thirty years old. ‘Vader’ literally means ‘father’ in Dutch.”
Still, Dean feels obligated to reply with a surly, “Sam should keep his mouth shut. And that was one time!”
Dean is temporarily shocked, and can’t say anything. After gaping at his boyfriend for a moment, he blurts, “what? Why?”
She shows them into a room that has a very strong animal smell, and walks over to a large pen in the corner from which small yips and scratching noises can be heard, motioning them to follow her.
“How’s your appetite? You’re a bit underweight, and I would bet you have a few vitamin deficiencies we’ll come across when the entire blood panel comes back.”
“It goes directly against the teaching of the Bible, Castiel. God created the Earth, and man, and all living things.”
“Gabriel, I’m sure you called for a reason.” He strips off his tie. A sweater and jeans will do nicely over top of his button-down, he thinks. Casual clothes were not welcome in his house as a child, leaving him lost on occasions that call for casual dress. Even now he occasionally forgets that he owns a pair of blue jeans.
“I applied at several but was accepted into Brigham Young, Liberty University, and Bob Jones, as well as Dallas Christian.”
Dean rolls his eyes, but Cas is kind of right. Dean might have only had a mild concussion that day he ended up in the ER, but Balthazar saved his life just by noticing the symptoms Dean was experiencing.
This kind of immature bond, echoes of each others’ intense feelings, it wasn't supposed to happen without a conscious effort by both parties. Of course, Cas’s research occasionally mentions that it happens with extremely compatible pairs, but the research on it is so limited, because those pairs typically Bond quickly.
“Dean, they were both terrible. Lydia was a self-obsessed, horrible person who wouldn’t give up a thing that was literally causing you massive migraines. And Ketch… Dean, I’m sorry, but he basically assaulted you for weeks. If not worse. Neither of them left you because of
John begins to search for places to stay that don’t require background checks. He only pays in cash. His paranoia pays off, somewhat. They can stay longer in one place (though never longer than a year). It’s when he uses a credit card, an insurance card, anything that can be tracked that is all goes to hell. When he leaves the boys, that’s when they’re safest. He can use his credit cards in other states and towns, it makes it harder to track where the boys are. He drills it into Dean:
Dean’s starting to feel like he can’t catch his breath, and he belatedly realizes that he was so fucking focused on his
That’s extremely unusual. Cas’s brow furrows, and he types quickly. There’s a fine line between friendly concern and overbearing, he knows, but he’s worried for Dean.
“I stayed with him for a little while after Dad left. Worked for him for a while. Then I uh, traveled for a bit. Worked short-term jobs, just trying to figure out what I wanted to do.”
Castiel cries. It’s so very painful for him to realize that these feelings are inside Dean all the time, even when he’s happy and in love. Dean doesn’t feel that he deserves the love that Castiel has for him, for only Dean, and it brings him a sharp stab of what feels like physical pain, a gaping wound that he wants to fill with his adoration for this man, who he wants to be he his, his husband, and one day, perhaps a father.
,” Cas emphasizes. “The Sensinull will be clear of his system soon, it possibly already is, which he’ll find out tomorrow, and Dean will discuss with his doctors the best course of action. You knew this would happen, that Dean might have more zones. And his panic attacks aren’t new, either. He’s learning to manage them.”
“Even if you don’t want to get lunch with me, you should still eat something, preferably with more protein than sugar,” Cas starts to move away, a half step backward, the first stage of saying goodbye to someone you’ve run into on the sidewalk. “Have a good day, Dean.” The thought of Castiel walking away is making Dean feel nauseated again.
It’s probably a good thing, Dean thinks. If Cas is frustrated with him this soon, he’ll be done with him that much faster. They’ve even shared a bed a few nights, though Dean stays strictly, painfully on the opposite side of the bed. Once, he woke up and he had moved into Cas’s space in his sleep, head on Cas’s chest, head tucked under Cas’s chin, their legs tangled together. He flew out of the bed so quickly and into the bathroom with his spare kit held tightly in his hand that Cas startled awake. He tried to talk to Dean, but Dean was busy trying to pull his shit together. He didn’t cut that day, but it was only Cas’s presence outside the door that stopped him. What if Cas came in and saw what he was doing? What if he felt it? What if Dean caused Cas pain by doing it so close to him? He can’t risk that. When Dean had finally opened the door, he dreaded having to give an explanation, but it turned out he didn’t have to. Cas’s eyes swept over him from head to toe, a visual examination of Dean’s state, and finding him in no physical danger, Cas quietly asked Dean if he was alright, and would he like to have breakfast?
Occasionally is right. Cas doesn’t like to talk to his mom when she calls more than once a month, and Michael and Cas talk even less than that.
Huh. He never thought of it as “getting what he needs.” What he needed was someone to help him control his zones, the way a Guide is supposed to. And he needed someone to trust him as much as he trusted them.
Dean laughs out a breath, but it sounds a little choked, and a little like he doesn’t believe her, and Charlie knows it’s bad. Her best friend keeps it together when it’s tough and is one of the most reliable people she knows, but sometimes, he breaks. And she wishes he would talk to her before he breaks instead of calling her to smoke, all maudlin in the backyard. Dean makes her think of sandcastles, sometimes. He’s all fortified walls with a moat, sand mixed with just enough water so that the walls stay sturdy, built so tall and wide you could probably stand on them if you’re careful. If you’re not careful though, it crumbles. And sometimes a big wave comes and washes it all away, and you’ve got to be careful to rebuild the walls, or else the rest of the castle falls down, too.
Dean bites the inside of his cheek. He will not cry. He is going to go to the pharmacy to pick up his new medication, and then he is going to drink tonight until he feels nothing or passes out, whichever comes first. In the morning, he will take his new dose and everything will be fine.
He works some hours on the weekends for Bobby, too (who hounds him about sleeping and eating enough). He works a few hours here and there for Ellen at her bar, the Roadhouse, as well, but mostly on the weekends when he’s in that direction working for Bobby. Dean’s doing fine. The fires haven’t found him in so long, he feels free. Not free enough to rent an apartment without worry, but free.
“If it’s been five years… maybe there won’t be any more fires?” Cas suggests, hopefully. “Maybe it really was your father setting them. They stopped after you cut ties…”
Dating Cas isn’t that much different than being friends, except now Dean feels less embarrassed when Cas catches him staring, or when Cas says something adorable, and Dean’s allowed to tell him he’s cute.
Bobby answers for him. “Boy’s worried about causing the fires. He knew they followed him around, so he figured if he kept moving like his dad kept them moving when he was growin’ up, they wouldn’t catch him. And it worked until now.”
Dean feels his cheeks warm up. He knows, objectively, that he’s not a bad looking guy, plenty of people have told him so, (and usually, once they hook up he never hears from them again, so clearly it’s just his looks) but hearing Cas call him attractive is unexpected. And also, Cas finds him attractive? The back of Cas's neck is pink when he turns away from Dean to fiddle with something on the countertop, and he lets the slightly awkward moment pass without comment.
“Dean, he has nowhere else to go! And if we take him to the shelter who knows what will happen? There are so many homeless animals that they can’t take care of him, they will probably put him down!” Cas looks so despondent that Dean can feel the hard line he had taken on the cat (oh, who is he kidding, he’s Frederick) shifting.
He hangs up and tries to call Dean, but the call is sent directly to voicemail. His phone rings again, it’s Gabriel.
They keep Frederick. Dean insists on calling him Fred, because “Frederick is completely ridiculous, Cas, I mean…”
When he gets out of the store, he checks his phone. He’s got a missed call from Sam, and a text that reads “dad’s home.”
“Of course they do, you’re an awesome doctor, Cas.” Dean can’t imagine not trusting Cas, of all people.
. It didn’t help that his oldest brother Michael embraced the lifestyle of their parents entirely, but it did help that Anna and Gabriel, twins and opposites in every way, did not. They helped by giving him a safe place to feel all the things that he was feeling. Anna was as calm as Gabriel was a diversion. He got overwhelmed easily in those days, and they were the ones that suggested he was old enough for the Sentinel-Guide Test.
“My mom died.” Mrs. Jones’ lips go tight, and she makes a noise in her throat that he interprets as pitying. He hates that and pushes forward. “My dad had to go to work this morning, but he signed all the stuff for Sammy. He said his number’s in there if you want to call him,” he smiles his most charming and innocent smile, the one he uses when he needs to get some noodles or bread when they’re out of money. It makes the store clerks less wary of him.
“Hurting yourself.” Cas clearly isn’t impressed by what he’s deduced, but Dean can admit to himself that he’s not wrong. Alastair might have given it a different name, but it isn’t inaccurate.
“I’m fine, Cas. Stop worrying. Now, will you please explain to me what the fuck is happening in this section of chapter eight? I know you took this course at some point, and this is just not working in my brain for me.”
One glance at Cas shows him with his mouth hanging open, face gone white. Ketch is doubled over, swearing a blue streak at Dean, but Dean’s focused on his boyfriend’s look of shock, chest heaving though he feels like he can’t catch any breath.
Both of them wearing pajama pants and t-shirts, Dean leads the way to the kitchen, trying to shake off the exposed feeling. He considers adding more layers of clothing but knows that it wouldn’t actually help.  Instead, he tries to remember what he has to make them breakfast.
Sam rolls his eyes and launches into the traditional argument. “I always know what you mean. Just be safe, okay? I don’t want to patch you up yet again because the girl had a boyfriend.”
Castiel, still in physical contact with Dean, probably would have felt the shame from the Sentinel even if he was across the room. Whatever Dean is about to say isn’t easy for him.
Castiel pulls the belt buckle apart, and unbuttons Dean’s pants, lowering them and helping Dean to step out of them. He stands up and kisses Dean deeply, then takes his hand and leads him into the bedroom.
Their conversation comes to a close, but Bobby doesn’t dismiss Dean. He watches Dean expectantly. He doesn’t know how Bobby knows he’s been keeping something from him, but he does, the sneaky old man.
They don’t exactly need to dress up to go out, but both of them have been home all day, so Dean hasn’t even gotten dressed, much less showered. And Cas worked outside for a couple of hours, so they both end up taking a quick shower. Which takes slightly longer because they spend some time teasing each other and then Cas gets on his knees to finish Dean off. And they can’t not make out for a little while after that.
“Your competition is Michael for that position. It’s not difficult to come out ahead.” He debates changing from his courtroom clothes. It seems far too formal to go to a dinner of cheeseburgers in a suit and tie.
Castiel nods in appreciation, and they turn into the driveway of a modest light gray craftsman style house with a bright teal door and a huge black car in the driveway.
Sam heads out with one last worried glance at Dean. Dean knows that Sam isn’t going to drop his line of questioning, but he’s fine. He’s
They sleep for an hour or so, and Castiel wakes when he feels Dean stir beside him. When he sees Castiel is awake, his smile is genuine. The darkness Castiel could feel around him earlier in the morning isn’t gone, but it’s dissipated somewhat.
“Cas, any way you can check Jason here over real quick? I think he’s okay, but might as well make sure.”
Not being able to run is an absolute nightmare, Dean often feels unsettled, especially in the evenings. Cas does his best to tire him out with his promised body-weight workouts, and they’ve gone to Benny’s class several times, which has been interesting. He’s had a harder time settling his mind for class, but he’s more balanced than ever. Benny even thinks they could go back to working on some of the advanced balance poses if Dean can continue at his current level.
Cas considers. “It’s possible that pansexual is the most accurate label, though I tend to find men attractive most often, I have slept with a woman once or twice. I am more or less indifferent to gender or sexual orientation.”
Cas steps through the door and is almost immediately assaulted by a hug, Dean inhaling deeply with his nose buried in Cas's neck. It’s the first time Dean has ever hugged Castiel or touched him with more than a fleeting shoulder bump or high-five, and Castiel is tired, but he also feels invigorated by Dean’s closeness. And then he begins to feel what Dean’s feeling. Their usual defenses are somewhat lowered, and Castiel
“No, no. This is only slightly more powerful than electroshock therapy. See, I wanted you to be able to
Methodically, but quickly because he needs to stop the zone from taking over, he takes out the little knife, sterilizes the blade, and brings it to his hip. Three slow cuts, two inches each, and the zone stops. His breathing evens out. His phone vibrates with a text from Cas.
Cas pushes his finger into Dean’s hole. It hurts a very little bit (water is not very good lube, after all), but Dean likes it. He moans again, and says “Cas, I’m gonna come,” but Cas just swallows him down even further and pushes his finger in and out until Dean comes down his throat.
“Wait,” his father interrupts, “Castiel, we can get you help, there are places that will help people like you--”
Dean’s eyes widen, and rather than the slow return to his senses he experienced that afternoon in Dean’s office, Castiel witnesses the panic blossom behind the Sentinel’s eyes, sees Dean try to jerk away, but he maintains contact with him, holding him firm and speaking in a low voice.
Maybe Castiel knows what Ellen was talking about, because Sam sure doesn’t. “What was she saying earlier about Dean?”
He shrugs again, “It’s not so bad. Mostly I just can’t believe they thought an exorcism was the answer.”
Sam makes his way back to work, and while he travels, he worries. He remembers what it was like, growing up with his dad “helping” Dean with his zones. He still remembers the day he walked in on Dean using a candle to burn his wrist. He pulled his brother away from the flame faster than he’d ever moved in his life, considering that, at the time, Dean was a good head taller than him. That was the first time he realized that Dean wasn’t just allowing his dad to hurt him, he was actively hurting himself.
“Move in with me.” At Dean’s shocked face, he pushes forward. “You sleep here more nights anyway. And this way you don’t need to pay for a place for your van. You don’t have to eat out nearly as much as you do. And I want to see you eating more healthy foods anyway. Splitting all the bills will be more cost-efficient.”
Getting Yasha back upstairs into her crate is easy, and she almost immediately lays down on the soft towel nest they made for her. He crawls back into his own bed, eager to get back to sleep.
“Dad had a job come up this morning that he took, Sammy. Look, he gave me all the stuff to give to your teacher,” he shows his brother the envelope with all the papers that his dad gave him, “he’ll meet her another day, dude. But we really have to get going.”
Dean learns that Castiel wants to be a researcher. He’s happiest in a lab, though his parents wanted him to join the clergy.
As long as he’s awake, Castiel figures he might as well be productive. Gearing up for a caffeine-fueled day, he packs his bag with some study materials and his computer and headed out to Recoult. If Dean’s there studying, maybe he wants a buddy. It’s three in the morning, but Cas is wide awake.
might be going too far. “That, and one time I freaked out because of the sound of the church bells. Right in front of the church. A bunch of them saw,” he gives a mischievous grin, “at the time it was awful, obviously, but imagine the looks on their faces. A kid is walking by and freaks out, right as your church bells ring? They must’ve thought it was the Devil himself.”
Cas narrows his eyes at Dean as he opens the side door to the garage. He follows Dean in, watching him open the back door of the van to collect some clothes for the two of them to wear for the night. Cas sees him grab an extra toothbrush, and follows him inside. There’s not a lot of space inside, with two fully grown men standing, so Cas takes a seat on the bench while Dean hands him a toothbrush loaded with toothpaste.
come out, and besides, Cas already knows some of this part, and so does Sam. Who is he really protecting, here?
The next day, Dean has packed up the small duffle he has with him at Cas’ place while the other man is at work. It’s sitting over by the door waiting for him. He’s sorting his medications at the kitchen counter, figuring out which ones he’s still taking, and which ones can be tossed, and figuring it will at least keep Cas off his case even if he doesn’t plan on needing them long, when Cas walks in.
“It’s okay, don’t worry about it, I was standing in the middle of the hallway. Have a good day,” Sam waves her off, and Dean raises a hand in farewell, too. “Dean? What’s up?”
It’s been two weeks since Dean was released from the hospital, and Dean keeps zoning. He’s frustrated because there’s no real pattern to it. He’ll go a few days with nothing, but then will zone multiple times in a single day. Cas thinks his sensory system is finally leveling out, though.
on his own. Dean tried so hard to take care of Sam, but it was never enough, because Dean’s not enough. He’s not good enough for anyone, and there’s no point in hoping for someone to come after him, now.
“Fine by me. And yeah, I’ll come. You sure you’re up for it, though? Looks to me like you need a rest, not a party.”
He’s returned to work at Bobby’s and at Recoult. He often appreciates having the counter between him and the customers at Recoult, and Bobby lets him minimize the amount of time he has to spend talking to people. Dean continues to feel a little twitchy, and sometimes he has a hard time using his words. He’s stopped working for Ellen, who told him off when he tried to come back.
“I can appreciate the need to get rid of it, but if it ain’t yours, then I don’t want to get in a whole heap of legal trouble when he reports it stolen.”
He sees some familiar faces from the engineering department and even gets a couple, “Hi Dr. Singer,” greetings from some, but he doesn’t stop, nodding his greetings in return and following Ellen. They weave between a couple of bodies until they stop where Sam is talking to a man with dark hair.
“Of course you can take care of yourself, but you don’t always have to. That’s literally what Guides are for. And how exactly are you supposed to stop a zone from happening?” Cas looks like he’s getting angrier by the second.
“D’you think Sam would want anything to do with you if he knew you’re the reason his mom’s dead? You’re the reason Sam doesn’t have a mom, and you think that little smartass wouldn’t abandon you the second he realizes he’s better off without you? I did you a
“Yes, sir. I finished my master's degree last year and now I’m working towards my doctorate. I’m afraid I’m not as altruistic as Dean-- I simply want to work in a research lab, and a doctorate goes a long way towards finding a desirable position.”
“Don’t see no guests here,” Bobby grumbles, and tucks into his waffle after drowning it in butter and syrup. Sam’s probably gonna put fruit on his, the health freak.
The following weeks are stressful, because Cas is about to defend his dissertation, and Dean is about to take his last final of his college career, and realizes that he hasn’t made any plans past that.
“I won’t say it, Winchester.” Castiel’s voice sounds hoarse and Dean is so close, now. Dean’s eyes flick down to Castiel’s lips. His tongue darts out to wet his lips. Castiel stops breathing.
When Alastair touches the knife to Dean’s forearm, Dean’s vision whites out with the pain of the burning metal. He feels it right down to his bones, and it feels like it never ends. When Alastair lifts the knife, the pain persists, but Dean is able to breathe through it. He can’t make himself look down at his arm.
“It was a good night,” Jess says. The rest of them make soft agreeing sounds, and then she continues, complaining a little at Dean. “If only you had worn the outfit I picked out for you.” Dean rolls his eyes in response while everyone chuckles at him. Practically Dean’s entire wardrobe has been chosen for him by Jess, Bobby knows, and she gets very put out when he won’t wear what she tells him.
“I’m just trying to make sure you’re okay. Dad’s leaving again today. I don’t want you to go out and get beat up again.”
“What van?” Sam asks, curious. He was still crying, but he finally landed on a question Dean could answer.
he can do on his own, but it actually has some really complicated coding in it. Anyway, it has to be done tonight, I’m anticipating a frantic text that he’s never going to finish it in time and a little bit of, ‘Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobe, etc. etc.’ from him at some point.”
Dean nods, frantically. He’s done it once or twice, and tonight definitely feels like he barely needs much else, he feels so close.
“Sure, Dean, sure. Once a whore, always a whore. You know,” and he addresses Cas, Dean frozen next to him in shock, “Dean here looks awfully pretty in a collar. Last time we set him up in a cage, and--- oof! Fuck!”
“He’s doing very well, under the circumstances.” Cas's response is calm, but Sam never has been able to stop his hot temper from taking over, especially when it has to do with Dean.
strange. You didn’t partake in the Benioff and Weiss bashing, what gives?” Dean realizes that more than anything gave him away. His annoyance at the last season of
Dean can’t go with him, not if he wants to keep his little brother safe from the flames. “Sam. I have to stay.”
Dean sighs and drops his phone on the counter. Cas has slumped into one of the chairs at the island while Dean finishes up with Jess, and now he’s got his hands over his face, elbows propped on the counter.
“Father, this isn’t a problem. My homosexuality isn’t a problem to be solved! I’ll be leaving as soon as I can for California after I finish school next month.”
“And you’re… worried about forming a relationship. Though frankly, what we have now is a form of a relationship, you must see that.”
“Nah, I wasn’t really paying attention. But when I smelled it, I looked up and saw it, and it made me kinda freeze, you know? Because I’d been running from it for my entire life, and nothing had caught in so long--” he choked out the words, trying to get the image out of his head. “--I started just booking it for Cas’ because I could tell it was coming from over there, and when I came around the corner, it freaked me out, I could tell it was his building. I kind of bumped into someone and stumbled, felt like a pinch or something on my neck, and that was it. Woke up tied to a chair with that asshole fucking
“It IS a big deal. Most people don’t work this hard. When you’re a paramedic it’s going to feel like a vacation—”
It’s Castiel’s turn to feel pain, apparently. Dean wouldn’t be who he is without his Sentinel abilities, they’ve shaped him as a person. And Castiel is in love with him. This Sentinel is everything Castiel has ever wanted, and he can officially confirm that hearing the person you’re in love with tell you they didn’t care if they died is unpleasant, to say the least.
Dean can’t help but jiggle his knee the whole time they’re waiting. He’s about to be expelled, he knows it. And then Dad will get angry, and when Dad’s angry-- No. He can’t think about that, because he might cry, and then he’ll get teased. If he’s getting kicked out, he doesn’t want anyone to see him cry.
Castiel buys them ice cream at Marey’s Diner, and Dean can’t resist getting the “sprinklepool” flavor, and Castiel gets “churro churro”. They share their flavors, and Dean is smiling so big that Castiel wishes to remember it forever. Dean should always smile this much.
He follows his routine. He teaches, he researches. He meets with students during office hours. He goes to his yoga classes, he runs. Benny checks on his shins, and when Dean says they feel much better, Benny doesn’t tape them again but reminds Dean to make sure he’s taking rest days.
“About what?” Dean’s the king of avoidance. He can smell the vinegar in the cleaning spray he mixed the other day and thinks he probably used too much if the scent is lingering in the kitchen the way that it is. He bumps into the wall when he turns the corner. He must be half asleep. Cas steadies him and Dean waves him off.
Dean can feel Bobby starting at the side of his face, but he doesn’t turn to acknowledge him. He hesitates, looking down at his hands. This isn’t a part of his life he likes to rehash. He hasn’t ever told Cas about it, much less Sam, and he never intended to.
How many times did he have to tell that boy to stay home with Sam before he got it through his fucking head? He doesn’t take the time to watch his brother, and he knows, he goddamn
“Oh, uh. Sorry.” Dean’s been calling him Cas in his head since they met but has been trying to avoid doing it out loud. He thinks people probably find it weird when he nicknames them right away.
“Arugula?” Dean wonders, smiling at the little puppy now trying to crawl over Cas’ arms into Dean’s lap to investigate him thoroughly.
Maybe that’s something for his list for Pam: he gives Cas attention. Jesus, he’s really scraping the barrel here.
“I’m sorry if this is strange, miss. But my boyfriend is a Sentinel. You’re diabetic, you said? Have you checked your blood sugar?”
Downstairs, his mother and father sit at the dining room table. They look up at his entrance, and their faces fall when their eyes land on the bag in his hands. His mother’s face quickly turns to anger, and she shakes her head on her way out of the room. His father stares stonily at him.
Dean wants a Bond. He wants it badly, but he doesn’t think he can have it. Cas should stay away until Dean can come to his own realizations with no influence from Cas, but he’s finding the very idea of staying away from his Sentinel turns his stomach.
“Have it your way. I’ve got something here for you, Tiger. It’s gonna hurt, but I can’t wait to hear you
Dean leans his head back just a little bit further until it’s resting against the cabinet, and urges Cas with his hands to thrust deeper. Soon, Cas is pushing in and out of his mouth, one hand on the counter and one in Dean’s hair, as Dean keeps his eyes on Cas’ while he chokes slightly on the cock in his throat. When Cas goes to pull out after Dean chokes the first time, Dean makes a negative noise in his throat and pulls him deeper.
“What,” Henrickson snaps into his phone. “You’re sure? There’re no other buildings?” He nods, listening to the person on the other line. “Get a warrant. Team rides in fifteen,” He pulls his phone away from his ear, ending the call. Castiel waits, barely breathing.
Castiel’s face goes through some interesting motions, though Bobby’s got to hand it to him, it’s one hell of a poker face. There’s something Castiel is thinking but damned if he knows what it is. He waits for him to respond.
When he’s almost there, he sends Dean a text, so that Dean’s waiting for him on the porch with an umbrella. This is the bay area in the winter, so of course-- it’s raining.
“You’re no fun. Cassie, you already know what to watch out for, and since you’re a Guide I’m not too worried about Dean falling into a zone while you’re around. However, we’re going to have to work together on identifying Dean’s triggers for panic.”
Cas smiles a little. “Different reasons. Looking back, I suppose I was a bit strange. My mother had us wearing what the other kids might be their Sunday best to school every day. I was quieter than many of the other children, and Anna told me that for a while I cried all the time.”
Recently, Gabriel told Castiel about his classes at Culinary School, and about how his roommate performs in drag shows as a hobby.
“Wow, that’s great, Sam! What did you do in school today?” She glances at Mrs. Jones, who has a smiley face. Dean likes that because it means she was probably nice to Sam. Of course, smiles don’t always mean
“I require a great deal of caffeine to keep me awake during my duties as a graduate assistant during Intro to Biology I.”
“Are you going to come for me, Dean? I want you to come, just like this, in my lap. Can you come without me touching your cock?” Dean whimpers, but Cas continues, “I think you can. Come on, Dean, I want to see it,”
“He’s the best.” Dean looks down at him with soft eyes, “I don’t think I would’ve made it through this semester without him. You know he brought me dinner when I was working on the yard for this old house down the road from the school? He saw me while he was riding by on his bicycle. He stopped to say hello, and when my stomach grumbled he figured out that I hadn’t had time to eat all day. He left and got me food, and even got the owner of the house on his side. Dude’s a menace.”
“I, I don’t think so. Sometimes he said stuff like he knew I was with someone, but I could never be sure if he realized why.”
Not that it was that far outside the realm in which Dean typically worked. Dean was working towards his own graduate degree in Magical Engineering, with the aim of one day creating racing brooms that far outstripped the competition. He often came to Cas for advice on how he could tweak the properties of spells and magical objects.
“Look who I found,” Ellen announces, grinning. Damn that woman, she knows Bobby’s not one for hugs, and she knows Sam won’t take no for an answer.
The bell dings for another customer, and Dean looks up to see a shock of dark, messy hair, under which, bright blue eyes look at the menu as he walks up to the counter.
The Sentinel-Guide Institute that administers the tests and leads the classes that he never got to attend is supposedly good at advocating for Sentinels and Guides—is made up of Sentinels, Guides, and their family members—but Dean’s never reached out to them. He knows there are rules and laws in place to protect them and allow Bonded pairs to work together even when workplace relationships are outlawed. But that ends his overall knowledge. His dad never wanted him to have much to do with the SGI, and Alastair sneered at their practices. They both were of the mind that the SGI only existed to catalog Sentinels and Guides, that no one
“I wish. Nah, that’s tomorrow. Tonight I have an overnight at Recoult. Kind of okay, though. Got time to study for the stupid lab test next week.”
“I’m uh, with my girlfriend.” Dean can picture his brother’s blush, and a grin spreads across his face.
“What!” Cas wants to shake him, shake the words loose. It helps his self control that Dean stays across the room from him, an ottoman and a sofa in his way to prevent Cas from throttling the Sentinel.
“Wait, dude. If it’s him, he calls again, remember?” They’re supposed to let it ring through, and then when a second call comes through, they can answer it.
“Dean is being a fucking moron,” Sam fumes, “it’s like he doesn’t give a shit what happens to everyone else, how everyone else feels watching him go through all this shit, and he
Castiel is more than willing to wash dishes if it means he gets to stand side by side with Dean. “No, I’ll help.”
Castiel already knows his name. He’d know this man in a crowded room with his eyes closed and suddenly he can’t breathe.
Cas had picked up a Zipcar earlier in the day, since their destination is not in walking distance, and Dean’s van doesn’t get the best gas mileage. Besides, Castiel wants to keep it a secret.
Cas sneaks a hand down between their bodies, adding another point of friction for Dean to rub against, and Cas feels the hot line of Dean’s erection through his pajama bottoms.  He senses Dean wishing there was
of the heavy cast iron grill on the grate of his stove doesn’t make him wince. He pretends that the smell of the beef as he pulls it out of the fridge doesn’t make him want to gag. He pretends so hard he almost believes it himself. He’s not sure how he’s going to force himself to actually eat, but one step at a time.
“Kinda. I was going to do mechanical, that’s what I did for my bachelors. But when I was out of undergrad, I had just left a job at an auto-parts manufacturer and moved out here by Bobby and was working in his buddy Caleb’s garage for cash while I looked for a new job. Anyway, Bobby convinced me to come to one of his lectures. He had this whole section talking about the physics of flying, and space flight, and the types of engines they’d used in the past for space travel versus what they’re using now, and the possibilities for the future, and I was hooked. I still hate flying, but the mechanics of it… man, it’s like magic.”
He swallows thickly and he turns to face the couch. Cas is watching him in the dim lighting of the living room. The only lights on are the colorful lights on the tree. His eyes flick down to Cas’ mouth, then back up to his eyes.
Cas and Dean look down into the pen to see six wiggly puppies. Two were a reddish brown color, one was nearly white, and the others were mostly black, with light brown marks around their eyes and on their chests.
“Fine, you’re no fun. Balthazar’s coming with me to the club tonight for dinner, and you’re coming too. I’ve got a new chef for my days off, and I want to try him out, so lucky you, you get to come with! Chef’s table, baby bro!” He presents this as a treat, though past experiences tell Castiel that if he attends, he’s in for an evening of loud music, bright lights, and yelling any conversation they might like to have. It’s not his type of atmosphere, and his brother and Balthazar know that well.
Still, he hasn’t known Dean that long. Perhaps he goes through these periods, some people do, he knows. He’s working on his doctorate, and Cas knows from his own experiences with higher-level education that it’s no picnic. He remembers many nights fueled only by coffee and manic paper writing and unhealthy snacks.
They all know. They know that it’s his fault Cas doesn’t have a home anymore. He’s so relieved he can barely think, thankful Cas is alive, but he’s homeless, Dean realizes. They probably know about all of the fires. They’ll know by now what he let Alastair do to him.
“As sure as I can be. Abandoned warehouse is one of the types of locations the arsonist has hit in the past. Always an electrical fire in the official reports, but it’s always a building that doesn’t officially have electricity running to it. There’s a building like that down there. Wait here.”
Not a mechanic, or an engineer. No, his baby wants to literally be a car. Cas tried to explain to her that she couldn’t, but it all ended in tears, so Dean told her that if she wanted to be a car, she could be a car. She’ll change her mind next week, he’s sure. She’s three, she doesn’t need to know what she wants to be when she grows up.
Cas’s face darkens somewhat in anger. Dean rushes to explain, “I wanted you to stay longer. We can’t Bond, not with me the way that I am, but I like having you around. It’s selfish. Shit, Sam’s right, I’m—sorry,” he looks over to the window, where he sees the rain that he had been listening to all evening splashing against the frame.
). But instead, he simply shrugs, “my best friend is a lesbian. She’d kick my ass if I ditched someone because they’re gay. And man, she’s tiny, but terrifying.”
Dean remembers. Nothing stands out to him, except Bobby and Ellen getting a little too demanding about Cas. “What do you mean?”
The man frozen across the kitchen from him with salad greens in disarray at his feet must be Dean. Castiel can see the family resemblance, though Dean has lighter eyes and he’s a bit shorter than his brother, though Sam is quite tall. His hair is a lighter color, closer to a dirty blond, or maybe a very light brown. While Castiel is taking in some of what his eyes are telling him, most of what he’s taking in is visceral.
to be alone, and he thought he was fine with it. But then Cas showed up and it was so nice to have a friend for a time. They could be more, but then they might be too much, and Dean is afraid.
“Feel like I’m gonna float away.” Dean hates how hard words are right now. It’s like his body is drunk, but his thought processes aren’t. Sam looks at him with something like pity, and Dean hates it.
Castiel’s heart wrenches. He knew their mother died when they were young, but he didn’t know that Dean had such strong memories of her. He should’ve though. Most Sentinels tend to have vivid memories, especially when tied with a sense. A song would certainly stick with Dean.
Sam’s graduating in a month, and Dean hopes the fire that he knows is coming holds out. His own high school graduation was cut off by one of those fires, which sparked almost immediately after he got his diploma. Dad wasn’t there, but he packed them all up as soon as Sam and Dean came home.
Sam looks pained. “I can leave tonight. I have a bus ticket. There’s a sort of summer program that I was invited to. I wasn’t sure if I could go, but I think it might be better if I do. This family is so fucked up, you’ve gotta see that, dude. You should come with me.”
Armand is a quick fuck, Dean’s relieved to find out. He’s barely inside Dean for five minutes before he pulls out, and then Dean feels him come across his bare ass.
The man Dean called Rufus answered, “Nah, he wouldn’t do you like that. Winchester’s a damn baby for following that old bat Ellen’s rules, but he’s got good taste in beer.”
“Don’t you ‘Bobby’ me. You look like a stiff wind would blow you over. When’s the last time you ate?”
Pam nods, and Dean jumps to defend his dad. He hates himself for it. “He had a lot on his plate. I was a lot of work, lots of doctor visits, and unexpected hospital stays and stuff. I was supposed to watch Sam, and I fucked up.”
Dean doesn’t look nearly as tired as he did when they met yesterday, but he can’t say much about the rest of it. His shirt, an old Blondie tee he’s seen Dean wear a thousand times, it’s a wonder that thing isn’t full of holes, hangs a little too loose on his shoulders, his cheekbones a little too sharp. But his eyes are bright and clear. And focused on Castiel.
“I’m aware,” he responds faintly. “Dean, he didn’t just have his license revoked for physical abuse. He sexually and mentally abused his patients. He told their parents—”
Dean didn’t expect him to be so spot-on with his observations, but Balthazar continues to watch him with a look on his face that expects some kind of response. Dean decides if it’s all gonna come out in the open it might as well
Sam’s whole world feels like it’s shifting as Dean turns the car into Bobby’s yard. He shuts off the car and when Sam tries to talk to him, he holds up his hand.
Castiel’s words throw Bobby back to a memory of Dean, staring down at a pack of applications Bobby had printed out for him.
Bobby walks half a step behind Ellen across Dean’s modest-sized yard and takes in the view. Dean’s got a couple of tables spread out waiting for the rest of the food to arrive or be set out, and he’s got two picnic tables set up for seating. Otherwise, people are scattered around in camping chairs. He’s got his firepit set up with some of those Adirondack chairs around it, and Bobby eyes the new setup. He had helped Dean out by getting him a deal on the gravel to build the firepit through one of his contacts in the landscaping crew up at the university, and he’s got to admit it looks pretty good. He knows Dean’s got plans to put some kind of pavilion toward the back with a pergola, and he makes a note to himself to talk to Dean about it.
Dean’s pulse quickens slightly at Cas’s words. What kind of wondering comment could Cas have? Is he finally going to ask why Dean doesn’t want a Guide? He knows Cas has been wondering, but he’s never really asked? Wondering at his instinct to run away when they first met—admittedly, most Sentinels would not react like that, Dean knows he’s fucked up. Is he starting to wonder at how Dean of all people, the idiot brother, ended up in a doctoral program? Dad always did, either ignored it when Dean did well in school or just seemed surprised during their infrequent phone calls to hear Dean didn’t flunk out of college, had actually told him in high school it would be better if he just dropped out and worked at Caleb’s garage, supported the family?
“Wait. Yeah, let’s go get lunch.” He hates himself a little for using Cas like human Pepto Bismol, but he hasn’t kept a meal down in more than a day and he
Castiel scans the letter, his eyes widening as he gets further along. “They want your assistance in designing… Dean, this is huge.”
“I know,” Dean concedes. Bobby’s gonna help him no matter what he says, so he might as well go with it. “So, how do we do this?”
Castiel and the twins, Anna and Gabriel, along with their brother Michael were raised alongside Balthazar in the summers. During the school year, their friend went away to boarding school in France, his conservative family not approving of the education that he received in the United States. Though he returned for medical school after shocking his parents by telling them to “fuck off” when they tried to marry him off (it was an enjoyable story involving his parents interrupting what Castiel called an orgy, and Balthazar called a “
“What makes you so sure that it’s me who needs to do the cheating? Why can’t it be you that doesn’t know the answers to the test, Novak?”
He sometimes knew things that the other kids didn’t, like when his third-grade teacher got a new boyfriend (he could hear both ends of the phone call, and Ms. Schafer smelled like something distinctly
“Okay. I’m just saying, from what you told me about Sam, he’s not going to hate you. And San Francisco is like the most queer friendly city in America.”
“Well,” Balthazar says, “that’s about it. We’ve packaged some blood draw kits for Cassie, he’ll take care of that for you.” Dean had agreed to have Cas draw his blood at home so he doesn’t have to come into the hospital lab every few days to have his levels checked, and as far as Dean’s concerned that’s a bonus. “You have my number, call if you need anything. We’ll schedule your follow up with the new medication once we get the all-clear from the labs.”
