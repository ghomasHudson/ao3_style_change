"Me and Sam are gonna use Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek from The Doors, so you have to be Robby Krieger or John Densmore. It just makes sense!"
Kelly stared at them all in shock. "Who are you people?"
He looked over at Cas, who was driving fast again, flying into the brilliant gold sky. It was a perfect moment.
Sam's puppy eyes were wide and understanding, but Dean could feel himself shutting down, the blood draining out of his face. He knew this tone of speech.
Dean wished desperately that everyone would disappear. He wanted to break things and drink an entire liquor store, and he really, really wanted to be alone. Why did Charlie and Cas have to be here to see this? His own mom throwing him and Sammy away.
Cas was just looking at him with that stupid compassion he had. Dean looked away again, staring at the blank television. "It was just a scary thing when I was a kid. I've seen way worse stuff since. It shouldn't have bothered me." He picked at his shirt, awkwardly. "I just don't really like social workers."
Sam stumbled in soon after the bacon was finished. Dean looked him over, but his brother seemed well enough, so he gave him a "seriously?" for walking on his burned feet, even bandaged and in slippers. Hopefully, Cas would be strong enough to heal him soon. Dean got out the milk and jam and settled in to eat.
"All over. I went back to Lawrence for a few days. And uh, I've been using John's journal to retrace a few things. Try to catch up on what I've missed."
"Wait," Sam stopped her, "Didn't you do exactly that? Before the wicked witch thing?"
Jody nodded like this was all a reasonable explanation. "Ok, you gotta stay calm. It's good to keep them stable, get a routine. Simple ones, like, we have breakfast at nine, we are going to learn something at 11, we're going to eat lunch at 12. Movie and dinner at 5, Shower and bed at nine. It should help keep their anxiety lower if they know what to expect."
"Mother says I killed them."
"I took two souls tonight because of a demon named Jael. But the one I took yesterday was not slain by him." She said pointedly.
"Alright, back soon," Sam said and headed for the door.
"Even I can hack a traffic cam. What else do you have?"
They gave the truck to Jody. Mary offered to drive herself and Charlie back to Kansas, but Dean had just leveled a glare at her and she had handed the keys over. Dean told her to give it to Claire as a present, but then Jody had reminded him of the truck's dubious origins (Cas had just stolen it from a guy trying to help him get off the side of the road).
- Get bigger table in kitchen? -Definitely
"I don't have any ideas that relate to primates at all," Cas said with wide eyes. "Do you have a gorilla, Dean? If not, I want you and Sam to stop tempting me with the idea of furry mammals."
"What?" Screeched Gail, "No! You can't! We must all die here together! We will enter heaven as a family!"
"Dean?" She called again, her voice muffled behind one of the bedroom doors.
"I don't know what else could have or
It still sent a shiver down Dean's spine.
"Oh!" She exclaimed, "That's why you look so familiar!"
Mary collapsed, and Dean rushed to her. "Mom, hey. Come on." He tried to help her up and was stunned as she threw an elbow into his face. Dean stumbled back, holding his nose.
"Cas!" He strode back out into the map room, and Mary and Charlie followed. Cas didn't even seem to notice them, his eyes locked on Dean.
Crowley shrugged and snapped his fingers, a contract appearing in thin air. Thankfully it was quite short and simply stated that Dean was refusing rescue of his own volition and that he was of sound mind. Dean signed and stormed back into the cabin.
In general, life had become a chaotic whirl of voices, giggles, music, running steps, sudden hugs, and friendly swats. Crowded dinners around card tables Dean had set up in the kitchen until he finished the one he was building. Arguments about what room they should set up as a tv room because they couldn't keep watching movies on laptops.
"It doesn't matter, guys," Sam said encouragingly. "This is our shot. We just gotta find out where he's playing tonight."

Winchesters, and the Campbells that preceded them, were a typically stoic lot. They shoved their pain down and down until it burst out like acid, burning everyone around. Unfortunately, this group of Winchesters had been dealt far more than their fair share of pain. Dean had been burned so many times by his father and brother's discharges, and he knew he had hurt other people in his turn.
Dean's eyebrows went up. That was actually a very interesting question. "I doubt they offer Intro to Guitar in the cage."
cranky."
Dean felt a very unfamiliar urge. He felt like sharing. Like talking about something real. That usually only happened when he and Sam had life-threatening secrets that needed to come out. But this was his mom. Surely he could talk to her? And maybe, even if he couldn't show her that he was worth loving, he could show her that Sam was. No matter how many mistakes Sam made, he was always worth loving.
"You live here?" She said with surprise.
"You and I will go do the tests on Missouri," Cas decided. Dean really appreciated it when he took the lead and laid out a battle plan. "Sam will load the car. We will deal with Lucifer when we get to Los Angeles." He led the way up the steps, and Dean followed easily.
"I said I'm not talking about-"
Cas followed him into the room. "I would wake you up," he said dryly.
Late one evening, Dean mentioned the difference as he sat with Sam and Mary on her apartment's balcony. "It's great but hard to get used to," he finished.
"Yeah," Sam said quietly.
"Let's just get the big guy back, and then we can relax a bit. I can't wait to talk to your mom!" She shook her head in disbelief that Dean understood completely. "Oh my god. Also, I'm really glad you're better." She said with a smile.
Sam slammed the passenger seat door, making them both jump. They hadn't noticed him come back from picking up snacks.
Dean closed his eyes. Fucking hell. "Ok, get out of the house and wait for us."
She went on, still pacing, "And I'm scared Mary will leave without me. I sleep in front of the door so she'll wake me up if she tries to leave. It's not even that I'm scared of losing her for you! I've got her phone GPS on, and her truck tagged. I can find her if she wanders off." Her head was in her hands now. "I'm just so scared of being alone."
"The wounds Christ received during the crucifixion," Cas elaborated. They were all pretty familiar with Christian ideology though at this point.
Dean had to hold himself still, the urge to punch his fist into the tree almost overwhelming. Of course, this wouldn't be straightforward. His brain spun as he re-strategized.
Cas put a hand on Dean's ankle. Dean dragged his eyes away and continued. "Anyway, apparently, one of Mom's friends came over while Dad was out and was...concerned. She must have called CPS because the next thing I remember was someone trying to take Sammy and me out of the hotel room." Dean choked a little and skipped ahead to his father's return. "Dad got home before they got us out of there. He was mad. I don't know what he said to them, but they didn't come back. We skipped town a really quick after that, anyway."
Yet another hunter, a thin guy in a bright red button-up and string tie, said eagerly, "Wait. Your brother here? Sam?"
"I agree," Cas said. The irritation was apparent in his voice. "The level of violence, it's completely unnecessary."
A breath caught in Dean's throat. "I was when you died." Was this what Amara had meant? She had told him she was going to give him "what he needed most." Had she really given him his mother? Straight from the night she died.
"Considering God created us before he created time, that wouldn't help you very much," Cas replied quietly. "But why do you want a birthday for me?"
Dean shrugged, "And we will stop him. We will. It's what we do, man. Now you," he pointed at Crowley, "need to go clean up Hell, so demons stop terrorizing innocent hunters funerals, got it?"
. And I would do it again, so I'm not even sorry. I just carry all the weight of everyone he hurts."
The chains were solid, and it took a moment of searching to find Lady Bevell's key. Dean shrugged in response to Sam's question. "Cas is up there somewhere. Do you know how many people there were?"
." Beth's voice replied.
"Something's happened," Cas managed, "something... Angel radio... There are so many voices."
"Well, we're working on that," Sam said. "Um, now the day she died, was Olivia acting strange?"
"Mom, you're hurt," Sam said, and Dean looked up to see a handprint freeze-burned onto Mary's arm, just like on the body they had seen at the morgue.
Mary stared at him. "But, I have to go," she said, confused.
"Excuse me," said Cas sternly.
"You like stories?" Max added. "This is the story everyone's gonna tell about you. Forever."
"Well, no, not anymore, I don't think." Sam stammered, and Dean wanted to facepalm. "But that didn't make me the Devil." And now Dean wanted to argue semantics. "It-it just made me who I am."
"What are they saying?" Sam asked.
Crowley looked at the handcuffs Dean was holding. "Enochian handcuffs. That's your move?"
This statement seemed to confuse the priest more than thinking they were all angels, and he shook his head slowly and then just kept staring at Cas. It irritated Dean, and he nudged the man's shoulder and repeated his question.
"Beer anyone?" Randy asked, and the others replied if they wanted some. He headed out for the kitchen.
"Lucifer?"
Cas said grudgingly.
"I know it wasn't, sugar, but I just needed to make sure you didn't start to think it. Now, where is she." Missouri marched down the stairs. "Oh, baby." She headed straight for where Magda had tucked herself in one of the Library alcoves. Dean just trailed along behind.
Climbing back into the car, he started to expound on the virtues of modern junk food. Sam was still filling the Impala's massive gas tank that would be empty again far too soon. Passing over the chili lime jerky to his mom, he gave her a small smile. She seemed happy with the snacks, but honestly, he had no idea what she really liked to eat. He was pretty sure she had given him the same pleased smile when he had shared mud cakes with her as a kid. Most of his brain wanted just to spread out his whole heart in front of her and just say,
"How do we help him do things differently? Should one of us go back in time?"
Mary nodded noncommittally. "Mm, maybe, but... all I know is that little boy who grabbed me, I..." She sighed. "He didn't want to hurt me. He was scared."
"Well, she's not alone," Dean said, coming up to stand to one side of Mary. Charlie flanked on the other side, nodding her head in agreement.
"Well, dear, I'm a witch," Rowena said with a light laugh. She waved a hand at Cas, next to her and then pointed around the group, "He's an angel, she's a psychic, another psychic, two hunters, and the one talking to you is a hunter."
"And you said you put the fear in Russell." Dean mocked.
Sam stepped in, taller than she would have ever imagined her baby could grow. "Hey," he said quietly.
"It's for positive energy," Beth explained. "I'm a Wiccan."
Crowley seemed genuinely confused. "We are?"
Dean nodded and breathed out slowly. "Okay. See, Sam, that's a reasonable argument against killing her. She's too crappy a witch. Let's go to the motel and read through the case files."
"I'm-I'm Dean. Winchester. I'm your son."
They divided up the team again, much to Dean's frustration. Cas went in the ambulance with Magda to the hospital to start doing tests, and Elijah got a ride there with Beth. Sam and Dean walked down the driveway to the car by themselves again.
Sam had climbed into the backseat, and he gave a disgusted sigh at Dean's snack enthusiasm. As Dean started the car, the radio came on, and "Born to be Wild" blasted out. Another sigh from Sam and a flick on his shoulder as Sam urged him to turn the music down. Instead, Mary reached over and raised the volume further.
"What do you think we've been doing all these years?" Abraham asked.
"There's someone alive here," Cas called. The group rushed over to him.
"But yeah, I'm pretty sure if Cas died, Dean would be the next one in line to take them," Charlie said.
"Um, wow." Dean scratched the back of his head. "Why?"
"Like, adult female Castiel?" Charlie pressed.
" Called the demon with Jody's voice. There was a clap of hands and a crash. Dean held his breath and watched Billie to see if she was going to go reap more souls. She didn't leave though.
"You still look exhausted.  So what have you found on Her Majesty's Secret Suckbags?" Dean asked, assuming Sam would have stayed up late doing research, wounded or not.
Ketch nodded. "Mm. The toys are the fun part, hmm?"
"I need to show you something before I sleep anyway," Dean said as he dragged Cas down to the garage. He had forbidden anyone from looking at his project until he was ready, though Magda and Missouri had been giving him annoying smirks in return for that order.
"You don't have- I'll be fine." Jody waved them off and turned away.
"But what if you were incapacitated and couldn't reach Sam or me in time, and then we were just all sleeping as they killed us all or something? Or what if you were on the other side of the bunker and couldn't hear us being murdered, and we couldn't wake our own sleeping beauty asses up?"
They all quietly drank their coffee until Mary came in, looking fresh despite her reported insomnia. There was a quiet round of greetings, and she reached eagerly for the bacon.
He sighed. Apparently, he was talking about this. Cas got up and sat on the end of the bed so he could look at Dean.
"How weird?" Dean asked.
So he dropped into the driver's seat and handed the phone over. "So I texted Mom a few days ago. She just texted back."
"Yes, let's get back to the point," Charlie said. She focused on Kelly. "The reason we had Crowley go get you is that we needed to get close to someone
Dean hesitated still and looked back at Mary. "Seriously, about the research and computer stuff, no one is as good as Sam and Charlie. It's not a problem." She smiled and nodded, so he got his coat. "We'll make it quick."
"Which means?" Mary prompted.
Cas opened his mouth to respond, but Sam started moving, and both of them put their serious faces on and readied for action.
The door above them squealed open, and Dean pushed the women into the hall behind him. Both were trained hunters and immediately went silent and wary. Footsteps pounded down the steps and into the map room.
Baby sat shining in the center of the garage. Mary stood stunned at the threshold while Cas and Charlie went around to the trunk to check their ammunition levels.
"Okay, listen up," Dean said quickly, "we don't have much time. Missouri and Charlie. Crowley's coming back for you. Missouri, I need you to calm Cas down. Charlie, you gotta work fast on keeping our faces off the news or get them changed somehow. I'm trying to avoid another Leviathan shitstorm. Kelly, we're gonna have to tie you up, and you're going to be the poor kidnapped bait, alright? We're trying to clear your name, so you don't go down for this."
"It's a little run-up to Canada, Cas, just a tiny trip, I promise. We'll be back soon."
Dean looked up at her sharply. He knew she was saying it on purpose, but, at the same time, it was true. There was no way Billie would take both of them through, and he couldn't leave Charlie alone out here. He rubbed his hands over his eyes.
"The Archbishop?" Dean clarified.
Cas sighed, clearly wanting just to leave. "Your mother. She was awake last night, and...spoke to me."
Charlie smiled. She pulled up a video feed that showed a woman descending the steps of a private airplane. "Is that her?"
"Do you have any idea what she's done?" Gail cried.
"The...basement." She managed. "Go!"
"What about a, uh, possessing angel?" Sam asked. Everyone focused now on Ketch as they caught the intent behind the question.
"That Carl paints quite a picture, doesn't he?" Dean commented. "All right. What can do all that?"
"Mommy's gone." The ghost said.
They exited the church into midday sunlight and headed for the Impala, parked at the curb. Sam said he wanted to get coffee from the truck across the street, so Dean and Cas just settled against the car to wait.
"Is that a-a computer?" Mary stared at the laptop in shock.
"But anyway, we've been dealing with this, um, entity, called the Darkness, who is basically God's sister. And I was out here alone because I was supposed to blow her up with a soul bomb. But then, she and God kind of made up, and I helped a bit. As thanks, she said she would give me something I needed, and I walked out of there and bam! There you are!"
He stopped back at the car to get his duffel and the other two hunters, and then they followed him to the motel room. Sam raised an eyebrow at the single key, but no one said anything. They dropped their things and settled around the table to start reading the case files.
Dean spoke quietly, "This was the closest I could get to giving you wings."
Then she turned to look at Sam and Dean. Dean was already looking at the floor in shame, knowing the scolding that was coming. "I'm gonna, I'm just gonna give you guys, some um, some family time."
"How long have I been gone?"
Dean turned to look closely at Sam. "You took her out to breakfast this morning." He looked at Sam more seriously. "Is it starting again? Are you saying things you have to say?"
"Ok, let's get all this straight. Cas, you know Charlie and vice versa. Charlie and Cas, this is Mary Winchester, my mom." Cas' eyes fixed on Dean's for a moment as that news sunk in, and Dean nodded back. "We will figure all the resurrection stuff out in a minute. Charlie..." Dean had to clear his throat, "died a couple of years ago. And at the time, I had a, uh, Mark, on me. And we got rid of it-"
"Let's hope so," Missouri said. "Otherwise, we're all dead."
"Yeah, but I mean, so was Asa." Sam protested. "Then a hunt went bad, and he ended up hanging from a tree, alone in the woods."
Ketch looked confused. "Oh, right. Yes, you did. That was strange. Anyway, fine job done there. I do personally enjoy more of a dramatic touch, but you got the bad guys to go away with no memory of the incident, so bravo you. And you should believe me. Where's the angel? He can tell you..."
Dean backed off as soon as Magda started crying. He made sure he'd actually closed the front doors and then went to find Cas and Sam. He pulled them into the kitchen.
"All I want is to keep my family safe," Dean murmured. "But everyone keeps dying. I don't even know if this is real."
They divided up the chore list. Charlie and Sam went with the teens to shop. They were going to split up in town once they picked up Mary. Mary, Magda, and Elijah were supposed to get things to personalize their bedrooms and get them clothing. Charlie was shopping for equipment to set up her "lair," and Sam would get groceries. Dean and Cas took the cars one by one to nondescript locations and photographed them thoroughly to be listed online.
Charlie grinned up at him. "That's just because it's not your brand of magic, Constantine!"
!" The women chanted again. "
The room was a mess.
There was a choice to be made at the hotel. Dean glanced through the window at Cas and Sam, still sitting in the car talking. It had been a long time since the three of them had actually gone on a hunt somewhere. Should he get a second room for Cas? Or just a cot like he had gotten when they had stayed with Mary?
"It was classic. Until you two," Bucky gestured at Jody, "snuck off for some sweet, sweet time alone."
"Wait," Sam spoke up, "Did you say, uh, 'going out on a hunt?'"
to go!"
Charlie groaned. "That was terrible, Dean."
"Yeah," Sam agreed. "I put in a dozen calls to the Chief of Staff. No one returned."
It was a very long day, but by the time they all collapsed in the kitchen again, Sam, Charlie, and the teens at the table and Dean and Cas leaning on the walls, the jobs were done. Photos taken, shopping completed, and shelves stocked.
"Dean?"
"Part of me is just so angry at Amara for doing this to us. Sam and I were doing fine. We were holding it together just fine. Why would she think that giving me my mom back was what I needed? Especially when my mom doesn't even-" He broke off, not ready to go there, even with Cas. "I just think she was happier in heaven with... him. With Dad."
Static flared across the line.
"You don't think she's going to?"
Cas was patting at him, concerned and trying to find where he might be injured, but then the singer began the vocals, and Dean just clutched a hand over his mouth to keep the laughter in.
Even the bunker wouldn't feel as safe as this, though, Castiel thought. The big black car, crowded with these fragile lives. A warm space in a cold universe. Sam was asleep in the front passenger seat, his head leaning on the window. And Dean was driving.
He turned, and Dean grabbed his shoulder. "Hey! What the hell does that mean?" Dean asked defensively.
"It's awfully quiet," Dean murmured.
"Seriously?" Charlie asked him.
She wrapped her arms around him, and it felt like... Dean didn't really have a good description. It felt like when hugging Sam after a miracle resurrection. It felt like hugging Cas when he found him in Purgatory. It felt like finding something impossible.
" Cas was emphatic. "
Dean spoke stiffly around the emotions lodged in his throat. "He gave himself up for me."
He also was mercilessly abusing his driver picks the music privileges to listen to iHeartRadio.
"What about sulfur?" Dean continued. "Did you smell rotten eggs?"
"I just want to say, that I think it's better for you if you come home. We can help you. I know you barely know us, but we understand the craziness you're going through more than Joe Plumber. We've seen death, we've all lost family. Everyone but Jody has been dead, though none of us as long as you, I'll give you that.
But Sam was missing. That needed to take priority. Sam was the center of Dean's entire universe, and even though he loved all these people dearly, Sam had to be found right now.
He brought his knees up and looked to the sky, waiting for the stars to appear as the song wound and changed and took strange loops. It really did seem like his life.
"Kelly...we need your help," Sam said. "You have time to make a choice about the pregnancy, but we have to get Lucifer out of the president."
!" Dean exclaimed. He got a couple of glares from nearby patrons. "If you want to come home, then come home."
"Men of Letters?"
"Hey," he protested. "Honestly, I missed most of it, I was outside talking with Charlie and Billie cause she was there to reap somebody. It wasn't any of our faults this time, either. Jody got a tiny bit demon-possessed, she's better now, ok, but other than that, we were all completely fine! I didn't even make any deals with Billie!"
"Oh, God." Kelly put her face in her hands.
In the next couple of days, Dean's list grew more detailed, but not much shorter.
Cas growled at Dean as they walked, "I told you they didn't use modern technology,
"You're not him," Crowley retorted.
"Frostbite. Yeah. Both victims died of acute hypothermia. In a 65-degree room. When I opened them up, their hearts were literally, and I mean literally, frozen." The thin man took a deep breath. "Want to tell me how to present that to the public? Or to their families?" He looked back at Mary. "So much for training wheels, huh?"
Sammy was supposed to be an infant who laughed at tummy raspberries and struggled to sit upright. He was supposed to be laughing at his brother's silly faces and napping on Mary's shoulder as she tried to fold laundry with one hand.
house." Moriarty rasped. "
"They held me," Cas told him sharply.
Mary looked at him sadly. "I know. In my head. But I'm still mourning them as I knew them. My baby Sam." She turned to look at Dean. "My little boy, Dean."
They started down the drive and noticed a utility pole that had been chopped down like a tree.
children. Forever." He pushed a hand onto Dean's chest, and a deep cold began sinking into him.
back? I would give anything, absolutely anything to have that. And it would scare the hell out of me."
"I don't know who you're referring to," Jack said.
"I don't know," Mary said. "I don't feel like I need to be anywhere
"It's... kinda mine now."
"Oh, Dearie, you are in deep trouble there," Rowena warned, which was not helpful.
"If we can time it well, I can knock out their power, so it looks like Cas did. Then Dean and I can come in from the back and catch anyone waiting inside."
"I don't get it." Sam protested. "Lucifer could be taking over Heaven and Hell right now, and instead, he's trying to act out some rock god fantasy?"
"Oh my god, I am right next to you, stop screaming in my ear. This is not that big of a car. Anyway, I blacked out the nudie bits with a marker so stop freaking out."
"That's the angel, right? I always thought they were more of a... stoic lot."
Crowley explained as he did something with Sam's laptop. "Did a little digging, acting on a tip. And I think I know the identity of Lucifer's newest vessel." He paused for effect, and Dean rolled his eyes. "Huh? Aha!" He turned the laptop so they could all see. "Gentlemen... I give you one Jefferson Rooney, President of these United States."
"We never know what we're walking into. We're hunters." The other two nodded in agreement and looked to Dean for the inevitable rebuttal. It came as expected.
"Not really. I mean... she was getting headaches. Bad ones, like super migraines. But we all knew she was working too hard."
A girl swaggered into the room with a couple of beers and said, "Amen to that."
"Yeah, when we're not on the road." He told her nonchalantly. "It's an old Men of Letters bunker."
"If you insist on old music...I'll be Freddie Mercury."
Mary chuckled and shook her head. "Oh, no, I had Charlie get me some newspapers while we were shopping yesterday."
Dean shrugged. He opened the hall door and led the way towards his bedroom. "What if something happens?" he argued. "You'd be all alone."
"Thank you."
"'Sweet, sweet time alone?'" Dean repeated, finally able to give Jody his own curious eyebrow.
"So," Charlie filled Dean in, "we got Mary a furnished apartment. It's about a fifteen-minute drive from the bunker, just like a grocery run. It's a nice little one-bedroom, and I was able to get her paperwork all sent in over email and phone calls. We just have to work on getting her a car as soon as we can. A legal one."
"Or at least me, since Sam probably told them you're dead," Cas said thoughtfully.
. But I can't go to the bunker. Not yet."
"So, do you want to talk about why you were so upset? I know her comment about families splitting up was harsh, but you seemed deeply wounded."
"Well, how about you put your gun down there and join us, then? I'm sure you don't want me blowing a hole through Sam's head now, do you?"
"It's alright. I just wondered if you would be willing to sign as another reference for Agent Novak's foster care file since you work closely with him. His records look good, but he seems a bit... awkward." Beth hesitated at the end. "It's not too late to call their aunt if he's uncomfortable."
"Yes, she was human," Cas replied before they both looked at Mary.
"Ok, so the plane was registered to," Charlie put on a fake accent, "a Lady Toni Bevell. Super hot but also, like, stupidly posh. Anyway, I managed to dig up financial's and got a rental payment for a farm in Aldrich, Missouri."
"I thought- I thought you were.." She trailed off uncomfortably.
. She has taken lives. Do you understand that by keeping her here, we're protecting you?"
"Yeah. To the priest, to Carl. Heck, on the way here, you wouldn't even make a pit stop."
"Magda is alive," Cas whispered, and Dean nodded. "Her mother is reading her scripture in Aramaic and forcing her to self-flagellate. Dean..." He looked at Dean seriously, "We're saving her, no matter what she did."
"We just want to understand what happened," Cas said calmly to the priest.
Jody just asked him evenly, "Are you?" curled up in her flannel pajamas in her plaid armchair.
Cas grunted and almost moved anyway to tackle someone. Dean wasn't sure who. But the gun flew out of the man's hand and into Magda's. She shook a bit as she held it but smiled in victory.
She came over to sit on the hood of the car next to him and took the flask from his hand to take a sip herself. "Wow, that's better than that horrible beer in there."
Mary was inspecting her bandage calmly, the towel that had been around her hair suspiciously missing. "Be nice to your brother, Dean."
"Look, we only have a few minutes until the agents shake off our compulsion," Cas warned. "What are we doing?"
Ok, I've got these three chapters up, and I'm working on editing the 4th and writing the 5th right now. I'm hoping for a weekly update schedule right now. The chapters are getting much longer. Chapter 4 got out of control and is 10,000 words right now. I hope to update on Thursdays for Cas because I'm a goof. Maybe after the holidays, I can update more often, but we'll see. I have no clue how long this is going to be, I'm sorry. Have fun!
Cas didn't look very happy, but Dean asked anyway. "Anything?"
He watched the back of Cas' head for a few minutes before speaking. "How did you know I was upset, back at the office? You reacted like, right away."
Dean pulled her into his arms tightly. "Thanks, Jody."
"Sorry, I hope I didn't wake you up. I-I uh, wanted to bring you this." He placed a cup of tea on the desk in front of her and back away quickly. He was even more hesitant and careful than Dean was, and Mary felt guilty that she was making them so nervous.
"Cas..." Dean growled. "Where's my whiskey?"
Sam still looked concerned. "You okay?"
"Hi."
(See the end of the chapter for
"No." She argued. "Vince didn't. He wouldn't have to. I wanted to, to show him, to make him happy."
"Well," Sam said, "I couldn't sleep much, so I was looking for a new case. And I found one."
"I'm a hunter, much like you are," said Ketch calmly. "Only I finish the jobs I start."
"And that means?" Ketch asked.
Dean waved that off. "Then campaign like every other son of a bitch. You have charisma coming out of your eyeballs. Just take the damn throne and convince them you deserve it. The rest of us are going home. Though you," this time he pointed at Cas, "need to call your kids and tell them you're alive."
"Oh, the world out there is all distractions. Consumerism, corporations. And the people, if they're not shopping or stuffing their face, they're sitting in front of some screen, watching fake people do fake things, while the real world just gets more and more screwed up."
"Yeah, Bucky's homebrew is not good." They were quiet for a minute and then he said, "I'm so tired of avoiding talking about how I'm doing. How are you doing since you got back? I know it's been chaotic, but... are you okay?"
"I spent a lot of power on the wards. I can stop the shock and stabilize him, but I will have to rest before I can heal his wounds."
"That sounds extremely specific, Dean," Cas pointed out. "Did she offer you a deal? Let me guess, you were stuck outside and wanted to get inside the damn
The voices on the phone went quiet, and Dean decided it was as good a time as any to try and get everyone out. He looked at Elijah.
"Alright, then," Dean said just as softly. "December 8th. Happy birthday, Cas." Dean walked around the car and pulled the tarp off the car.
"I'll tell her you said that. I think she'll understand.
Sam stood up from where he'd been sitting and staring at nothing in particular. "Well, we need him to have an alibi and no evidence here."
"CHARLIE!" he yelled.
"And then I burned." She whispered.
Abraham and Elijah made their way out of the barn and back to the house, and Sam followed shortly after. He looked as shocked as Dean felt. He pulled out his phone, but there was no signal, and Dean came up to let him know he was already here.
"Good," she said. "'Cause that would honestly be weird."
" Cas hung up the call.
"Yeah, we salted and burned all the remains," Dean put in.
"No, way, Sammy. We're all good. Cas is going to get you settled, and then we're going to drive home, and I'll tell you all about the crazy last two days."
Dean watched as Cas returned with an armful of snacks and a bottle of soda for Charlie. The angel arranged them around the girl, and she laughed and patted his arm.
"Before we came here," Magda spoke very quietly, "I wanted a new cellphone, but my mom wouldn't buy me one."
It was a few hours past noon before Dean got his mind settled enough to scrounge up lunch for everyone. He spent almost half an hour in the kitchen, making sandwiches for his mother and Charlie. Cas wouldn't eat anything, but the humans were getting hungry. Dean wanted to impress his mom, so he very carefully made sub sandwiches with actual vegetables thanks to Sammy's healthy shopping, with extra carrots and ranch for dipping. Girls liked that kind of thing, right? And moms, especially. It would be good to show his mom there was more than pork rinds and beer in their kitchen, even if Dean rarely ate any of it.
- Assign rooms officially
Cas nodded and then climbed into the truck. With a wave, they pulled out of the garage.
Billie took Charlie by the hand and pulled her off the car to stand. Then she walked around her, inspecting the human woman from all sides as Charlie stood awkwardly.
For Rowena, the cautious: "You are at a crossroads, choose bitterness to consume you or love."
The moment he was in the stairwell, Dean paused to orient himself. He grabbed the gun from his back waistband and held it ready, scanning the levels immediately above and below. There was a crash as a door closed on the ground level, and Dean bolted down the stairs. He shoved the gun back in his waistband, not wanting to frighten civilians. But when he reached the ground floor, there was no sign of the man in the crowded hallway.
"Hey, I taught you stuff way older than I learned it!"
"See," Abraham said, "I'm not good with all this." He gestured to the farm in general. "I was a computer programmer till about five years ago."
"Ah." Cas stared at Dean, then nodded. "Perhaps today should be my birthday, then," he said softly.
"Ok." Dean centered himself. There wasn't much he could do as far as planning went. "Well, we don't know what we're walking into. So I will go-"
did this to me. She did this to
"True. We've screwed up plenty knowing exactly what we were doing." Dean commented.
"Hey," Dean smiled at Cas, "glad to be home. You guys manage alright on your own?"
"Abraham," Sam started first, "your daughter needs help."
They came back with the news that it was a used-up vessel, some wealthy titan of industry or something. It seemed their theory on Lucifer working his way up the food chain was right.
"Stop saying that or we're not gonna make it to morning," Randy said.
"Hi." Mary gave a reserved smile in return for Charlie's enthusiasm. "Are you a hunter too? And are you two..." She trailed off with a speculative eyebrow.
"Yes, please give me coffee." She dropped onto the stool next to Sam and stole Dean's cup. He tried to get it back, but her thin fingers had it in a vice grip.
"Mary!" Charlie was pushing at her shoulder. "You can't do this."
"Yeah," Sam laughed roughly.
"Sorry, I knocked."
"Uh..." Sam said quietly, "I already tried calling. He didn't pick up."
Sam took over instead. "Dean and I didn't exactly have the same childhood. We tell you about things more from how it was for me." Mary looked confused. "We just don't want you to be mad at Dad. We've had time to deal with stuff and forgive him, but he's been dead for a long time now, and it seems cruel to drag stuff up that happened ages ago."
"Ah. Right." Cas settled a bit into the chair. He did that more often since his time as a human, settling into a seat instead of sitting on the edge. "Well, we visited Vince Vincente's sister and found that she had been healed of her paralysis. She mentioned a redhead traveling with him, and Crowley admitted that he and Rowena had had a," and here Cas held up his fingers in air quotes, "'rather embarrassing run-in'" with Lucifer. We also learned of a cabin where he used to go write his music."
"Well, I may have turned the bunker upside down looking for any reference whatsoever to the British Men of Letters, and all I found was this letter tucked into an old ledger, uh, from the 'London Chapterhouse.'" Apparently, Dean's assumption had been right.
The door opened and closed before they could be questioned about either of these statements. Dean thought it was a bit of a shame as he had a whole file of inside jokes about God in his head. A teenager they recognized as Elijah Peterson from the case files came in and whispered something to his father.
Opening the door to a pitch-black space was never a fun prospect. Dean figured coming into the basement gave up any element of a surprise anyway and flipped on his flashlight.
"I'm getting there, sugar. Let me tell my story." Missouri said. "The first time she came to visit me, she said her sister hadn't liked you boys, and she wanted a second opinion before she did something big. I told her I hadn't seen you in person in a long time but that you were bright, pure souls. I told her of your auras and your childhood and your father. She nodded and left.
First, Dean felt like someone kicked in his ribs; the pain from Beth's words and the memories that flashed through his mind were like a physical wound
"You'll just think I'm lying, like my bishop, like everyone. But I knew Olivia. She was a good person. I watched her get flayed alive by some invisible force. That was the devil's work. I've been told the church doesn't want us talking like that anymore- too old fashioned. But I know what I saw."
"Hey," Dean said, his voice still sleep-rough, "so you never caught us up on the Lucifer hunt." He noticed Sam leave off his work again to listen.
They all stopped and thought about it.
Dean shrugged and dropped into a chair next to Cas.
"I think we have to play it out. Ok. Elijah." He turned to look at the teenager, who still looked very confused. "You want Magda to be safe, right?" He waited for the boy to nod slowly, then continued. "Alright. I want you to drag my brother inside. Tell your mom your dad is still looking for the other two, alright? I'm going to turn one phone on and put it in Sam's pocket and one in yours so we can hear what's going on. Cas and I will be right outside. We will get you guys out safely, okay?"
"We're not looking to be your franchise," Dean clarified. "We're not going to copy your methods and rules and let you be the boss."
He grabbed Cas's arm and stopped him as he stepped up into the map room. "Hey, where are you going?"
"Hey," Dean said suddenly, looking at Billie, "you got in there to reap that soul. You can get me in there!"
"Mom?" Dean called softly. He felt huge and clumsy like he would smash something delicate if he made the wrong move. Everything she did seemed important and miraculous, and he was so scared of messing this up.
"And we both came back," Dean said gruffly.
"What?" Sam was stunned.
Billie turned to study the youngest of them closely. Her brown eyes were piercing. "No, you didn't. And you hate it. The look in your eyes, I've seen it before. It's a dead man's look- eyes that say no matter where you go or what you do, it feels like this world doesn't fit anymore. Like you're all alone."
"Randy." The other man held a hand out as well. "Randy Bull. Ah!" He pulled his hand back and held his fingers up like horns, "Watch out for the horns, right?"
And Dean.
"Body's right there, Agents. I can get her prepped to your-"
. An innocent soul, with pure archangel grace woven into it. There is no direction or purpose to it yet, no motives."
"Uh," Sam hesitated and then shrugged. "It was the eighties."
There were crashing sounds as someone, probably Sam threw themselves at fake Jody. A short silence, then "
"Yeah, let's keep an eye on him."
want to work for Satan? "
Hugo hesitated for a moment, then shook his head. He rubbed at a handmade bracelet on his wrist, and Missouri leaned over and touched it.
Cas alternated between driving too fast and too slow. He would lose himself on the open highway, and the needle would creep up until he started to smile. Dean hated having to touch his arm and bring him back down before they got a speeding ticket. He knew it was the closest to flying the angel got these days.
"I need to know if my brother Lucifer, who recently possessed me for half a year, does or does not currently wear a rainbow wig and fucking leopard prints," Cas said with absolute sincerity.
But Cas was in his guardian angel mode now. He put Sam to bed with a cup of tea and an old show running on the tv in his bedroom. Then he used his terribly unfair angel strength to steal Dean's whiskey and push him to his own bedroom.
"Um, is it really you? Missouri? I mean, it's been a... a while. And it's kind of a weird time."
"Agent, can I talk to you?" Beth asked Dean and pulled him aside. "Hey, I've gotten Castiel's paperwork. I guess Knowles was a name he was using on a recent undercover assignment?"
Mary looked at Charlie for the first time and tilted her head, "but I haven't been alone, have I?"
They got out of the woods easily now that there was a path to follow and light to see by. Dean gave Mary his wallet to buy some clothes while he stole a car to get them back to Lebanon. Thankfully they were only a couple of hours away.
"Why do you have teenagers?"
"Shut up." Dean finished the argument in the most mature way.
"Are you angels?" the priest whispered. "
"Do the wards keep out cell service?" He asked.
"The psychic from your hometown?" Cas clarified. "What is she doing here?"
"Yeah, but we checked the church and Olivia's house. We didn't exactly find any hex bags."
"Elijah, why don't you go find Magda and Charlie. It looks like something's going on," Dean said softly. The boy nodded and hurried off. "Hey, Cas, what's going on?"
Crowley groaned. "Why do I ever help you self-loathing monsters? Fine, but you are explaining this to Kelly. And also, you are writing a letter of pardon for me to give to your husband, so he doesn't fucking
"Yeah, yeah." Billie waved him off. "See, I'm a big believer in what dies, stays dead. Laws of the universe and all that. You all," she waved an accusing hand at the four, "are huge pains in my ass."
"I mean, not that it would've worked," Sam continued. "Lucifer blew town, but not before he slaughtered the entire staff. So we were on the right trail. Where's it go now?"
"For the third time, yes," Mary assured.  "Dean, it's analog. I'm good."
Ignoring the bed, he sat down on the floor by the door next to Cas.
"What did she say?" His voice cracked a bit, and Cas looked at him closely.
The now three-car caravan made it the rest of the way to the Plains Motel without incident. Missouri booked the rooms so that Dean wouldn't be on any surveillance tapes. They had chosen this motel for its double room cabins that were separate enough from each other that some noise, or chanting, shouldn't be a problem. They booked two full cabins, which gave them four bedrooms and eight beds total.
Crowley showed them a keycard. "I suggest we go check out his room. Vince is scheduled to be in the studio all day, so we're covered."
"There's been a massive surge in celestial energy." The tension eased a bit, and he swayed towards Dean. They got him settled into the chair as he explained. "A Nephilim has come into being. It's the offspring of an angel and a human."
Dean turned in his chair to face her more directly. "Now wait, your meatloaf was amazing."
"Magda, get out of sight." He opened the metal inner door. No one was there, which was a plus. Enemies usually broke through the physical outer door and were stopped at the warded inner door. He walked up the short tunnel to the outer door and opened it.
?" Cas asked. He seemed shaken. Dean worried that the angel was guilt spiraling again.
"I'll go talk to her," Crowley said casually.
"It's family drama," Charlie explained. "Cas is family, so his brother and dad are extended family, so we have to work on dealing with them."
"Okay, Sammy, let's tie this poor girl up and get ourselves arrested for kidnapping the president."
Missouri crossed her arms, "I'm not the felon, here, boy. You figure this one out."
Rowena dropped the final spell ingredients into the bowl. She reached to take Missouri's hand, and together they chanted the words over the candles, sigils, and bowl.
"Ok, let's get moving then, and figure out what son of a bitch is writing the script here, oh, shit, I think I already know." Dean definitely had a migraine.
"Pray harder," Elijah said with a sarcasm Dean appreciated. The kid seemed pretty sane, considering his very strange life. Not that Dean had room to talk.
Also, I had my first run-in with a fully crowded Impala. That's gonna happen a lot, guys. I've started writing chapter five, and it has happened, I think, every chapter since this one. I'm seriously considering buying Dean this van: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/30/45/37/3045379c45de0885f03e957caccf3cbe.jpg
Sam paused his ranting and looked interested. "You're playing against Mom?" Dean nodded, and Sam gave him a judging look. "The same Mom that didn't know what a cellphone was a month ago? Doesn't exactly seem like a fair fight."
"Did the Bunker's warding fucking
Dean opened the case and pulled out the blade to check it out. The cold metal felt familiar in his hand.
"I'm sorry," Dean interrupted, not sorry at all, "but who the hell are you?" He looked the man over and noticing the cross tattooed onto the back of his hand. He raised the gun and aimed it.
"Right, uh," He pulled a leather journal out from where he had been holding it tucked under one arm. "Dad's journal." He handed it to her. "His writing, his words. It helped fill in some blanks for me, answer some questions I didn't know I had. And you know, it- it- it keeps him with us, sort of."
"Mmm." Jody hugged the woman. "Loraine, of course. How you holding up?"
"Besides," Elijah said, more calmly, "Mary can't come to the bunker, right? So we would have to go there. And we can't change places again. It's too hard. We'll look after each other. Magda's eighteen, and I'm fifteen."
Mary stared at him and Dean realized he hadn't actually told his mother that little detail.
Dean wasn't sure why he was asking. What was the point of asking? He was going to die on this job at some point or another. It was just a matter of making it count, and making Sam safe and happy enough that the big idiot wouldn't drag him back topside.
Dean grumbled, "Yeah, maybe a third-tier agent."
"Yeah, I mean, you can just hang out and use my laptop or whatever and..." Dean trailed off as Cas raised a hand towards his forehead. "Wait, lemme lie down!" He lay down awkwardly and lay as flat as a board.
Charlie grinned and clapped her hands together. "Ok, good talk!" And the three of them strode off to collect their supplies, leaving Dean at a loss as to how he had so little control over this situation.
Cas smiled. "I know you didn't really get to meet the real one. She died far too soon. I think we need her to help if Dean is going to let go of his anger enough to pull us together."
"Uh, no?"
Everyone was surprisingly up to date on Lucifer developments. Dean wasn't very good at sharing how things were going, mostly when he felt he was failing. It turned out, though, that Dean was keeping Charlie informed, and Cas was for Mary. Elijah was shockingly good at putting pieces together and quietly eavesdropping, which they would have to discuss later. Missouri and Magda just knew what everyone was thinking, so that shouldn't have surprised them in retrospect.
"Hey," Dean protested, "sure, he's not great with new people, but he's a really good person. He really wants to help these two. And he's actually surprisingly good with teens. Uh," he smiled as he looked over at Cas, who was talking to Elijah, "so he's been really trying to build a relationship with... a foster daughter that moved out before he could get to know her. She was in a bad spot for a while, and he did everything he could. And then she got moved on to another home, but he still tried, y'know? He bought her this stuffed cat. It's so dumb. I tried to take her mini-golfing once... anyway, the point is. He tries. And she sends him Spotify playlists now when a year ago she screamed that she hated him."
They had listened to Charlie's recommendations about technology. Sam had dug up an older iPhone that Dean used as one of his other, other numbers until they could get her onto the friends and family plan the brothers had succumbed to buying, and Dean had also found an iPad that they had stolen from somewhere.
"Pleasure to meet you," said Abraham.
"Mom..." Sam was about to cry.
"Elijah! Where's your father?"
"I'd get these visions sometimes, and- and I could move things with my mind."
"You told people that she was speaking in tongues?" asked Sam.
"Okay."
Dean blinked incredulously. "What?" He had definitely made at least one pit stop. It was a six-hour drive out here to the middle of bum-fuck nowhere, Iowa. Also, they had stopped to change and get snacks an hour outside town. Was Sam forgetting things?
It was a six-hour drive to Aldrich, Missouri. That wasn't even a long drive by Dean's standards, but ninety-five percent of his cross-country drives were with Sam. They had routines and habits, and they had long ago settled into silent companionship. Even when Cas joined them, it didn't change much since he didn't eat, sleep, or use the bathroom.
With a wink at Charlie, she disappeared.
"So she covered her tracks," Dean said confidently. He opened the Impala's trunk and rifled through his pack for witch-killing bullets.
"No! I meant Indians from India!" She huffed, then paused. "Though, technically, it's true in both cases. Britain basically tried to colonize the whole world, and the rest of Europe bartered off the other bits. But regardless, yes, we are not letting them fucking colonize us. We may be a mess, but we are our own Goddamn mess."
"Jody," Dean started, but she went ahead.
"So he's what, an assassin?" Charlie asked as Sam dialed the phone. Missouri nodded.
"What are you doing here?" Mary asked.
Sam stuck to his guns. "It's not hair rock, Dean. It's hard rock. It's legitimate hard rock."
The last boy turned to look at Mary. Dean realized this was the one he had banished with the crowbar the day before. Mary nodded at the boy, and he too dissolved into light.
Cas looked at Jack. His adopted son. The most powerful being in the multiverse, yet only three years old. It was truly unfair that he had experienced so much chaos and grief in his brief life, and he was already burdened with such terrible responsibility.
Cas said at the same time, "He is my father. I met him once."
"What cover?" Cas asked.
There was a static silence and Dean looked up to see Cas's smile had dropped and the angel was glaring at him like he could smite him from three feet away.
There was a crash as the screen door opened, and Gail called out for her husband. It was cut off quickly, and soon Dean could see Cas pulling her around to the barn. That was better. At least the kids were safe now. He kept the phone up and headed for the front door.
"He's telling the truth about recruiting you boys," Missouri told Sam and Dean, ignoring Ketch. She walked around since he had seen her. Sitting on the edge of one of the beds, Missouri took Ketch's hand in hers and looked at it. Dean noticed the man flinch.
When Gail was brought out, she was shrieking at everyone in the vicinity, "She's the Devil! The Devil is among us! She must be cleansed! She is the Devil! Pray for us!" Over and over again. The local detectives helped her into the police car without responding. Abraham didn't put up any kind of a fight at all.
"All right," Sam said. "Um, thank you." Cas hung up the phone, and they all looked at each other. "So?" Sam asked.
Dean focused on finishing his project. It felt like all he could do.
They all stared at Sam. "What the fuck?" Dean asked Cas, who spread his hands in similar confusion.
"Hey Cas, how's it hangin'?" Dean leaned back against the Impala with a wide smile.
By dawn, his eyes were itching and his bones felt hollow. Every year the staying awake all night got harder.
They reached LA a full twenty-six hours after leaving Kansas because drive times are never anywhere close to actual times, especially when you add in three working bladders and stomachs. Dean was driving again because, as much as he hated city traffic, he also didn't really trust anyone else to get them through it. Cas was sitting next to him, glaring and holding out Dean's coffee every two seconds because he was convinced Dean would fall asleep at the wheel at any moment. He also had Dean's phone giving him GPS directions.
"He just really cares about helping kids in trouble," Dean said defensively.
"Then you are evil," Magda said sternly, and Sam sighed. "Mother says I'm evil, 'cause I hurt people."
Dean had been her entire world, even when Sammy came along and he had to share her energy and love. Her days were scheduled around his meals and nap and bedtime; his thirty minutes of Barney her one chance to go to the bathroom alone.  He was old now. Older than she was, even. And he was so much like her father. Stoic and hard, worn down by a life of hunting.
Mary seemed to struggle with herself. "I... want to, but it's like, I'm not... supposed to?"
Cas looked sideways at Dean, "Is that a name I should know?"
"Ah, he's a big boy. He can take it."
"I've been, well," Dean chuckled, embarrassed, "I've been fucking terrified to give you this car, Cas. Half of me is sure you're gonna take your little wings here and disappear off to handle things on your own again." He put a hand on Cas's arm and looked him in the eye, "But I trust you, Cas. You're my best friend. And I know you've felt like you had to do things on your own in the past. But I'm asking you, please, let us help you with this one, and with the one that comes after. We're going to fight as a family now."
Dean sighed. "Well, I like history, you know? Gladiators and outlaws, pirates. Hell, we're driving a piece of history right here." He gestured at the Impala.
"Hey, what are their names and ages?"
It felt a bit like seeing her for the first time all over again. He wasn't sure where all the air in the room had gone, but it certainly wasn't in his lungs.
"I don't think 'twerking' is a real word," Elijah said, and Dean realized he was looking over his shoulder at the phone. A message popped up on the screen from Mary at the same time.
"Anyway," Dean waved the thought away, "we gotta figure out what's going on. Sam and Mom are doing the whole following the script thing again. I convinced Mom to come to Lebanon at least, so that's good."
Dean froze. "What? Why?"
Dean poked his head around the corner. A glimpse of tan trenchcoat released a band around his lungs, and he could suddenly breathe. He smiled before calling out to his friend.
"Well, we're gonna come with you," said Dean firmly, and Sam agreed.
"Ok," he agreed, "it's you. I still don't understand. Why are you here?"
"Fine," Dean shrugged. He didn't mind all that much. The kitchen was a happier-feeling place anyway. "ELIJAH! MAGDA! FOOD!" He yelled at the top of his lungs. Charlie covered her ears, but Sam and Cas just gave him identical bitchfaces.
"See?" Loraine lifted her glass.
Dean held his hands up. "Okay! Missouri already convinced me. We won't do anything to the embryo." At a glance from Charlie, he amended, "I mean, unless, of course, you're uncomfortable with the whole pregnancy thing, especially knowing what you know now, because it is your body, and you
"Uh-huh," the priest nodded. He started to look upset. "Senior staff decided...handle internally and intervene.
Sam breathed harshly over the speakerphone, and Dean could almost hear the bitter laugh he was keeping in. "No. No, you're not. You're really not."
"Okay, listen to me," Sam said quietly. "I can help your sister, okay?" Dean was moving around to get the drop on Elijah in case Sam couldn't talk him down. "I just need you to trust me here."
," Mick Davies answered on the phone. Sam had set it on the bed so they could all hear. "
There was a crash and then the sound of a blade skittering across the floor.
He let go and walked away. Crowley stared at Dean in shock and then hurried to catch up to the angel.
"How?" asked Sam. Dean handed over the file so Sam could read it himself. "The victim's skull was filled with a goopy mush."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh no," Jody said, "you and Claire are never allowed to meet, ever. That is my new law."
"Billie?" Sam asked.
"Crowley doesn't know," Cas replied.
It only took a moment for Cas to heal Sam now that he was rested, and with five of them, the cleanup went quickly. Charlie tried to teach Mary a little about modern technology but turned out to be a terrible teacher as she kept tangent-ing. Sam took over after seeing his mom look like a deer about to be hit by a semi as Charlie started on a completely unhelpful rant about Atari. Cas and Dean went to look over the truck Cas had stolen to get to Lebanon and determine if it was road-ready.
"We have an aunt."
"Sam!" Dean yelled, reaching out to try and stabilize him. He was too far, though. Dean noticed Lucifer trying to hurt them, but nothing was happening. Lightbulbs were popping as the lights continued to pour into Lucifer. "Rowena! Now!"
Cas almost sounded petulant.
Dean glared at his reflection in the glass door and shoved his feelings deep into the lockboxes of his brain before following Sam.
second, can I?" Cas growled at him. Dean shivered.
" Jael continued, "
"It's my fault Lucifer is out here to hurt people in the first place!" Cas yelled. His eyes searched Dean's, and Dean wondered if he was looking for someone to accuse him.
"-I don't have a harp," Cas interjected. "And I barely have wings."
Dean Winchester was many things, but he was not an extrovert. Little in the world frightened him like walking into a house full of people he had to talk to. And this was a really big house with a driveway full of cars.
"This was John's car. Oh, she's still beautiful."
"Hey," Dean squeezed the hand on Cas's shoulder, "We're going to do this together. We'll find him together."
"Uh. So, Charlie, this is my mom. Mom, this is Charlie."
Cas picked up the narrative. "He regularly delivered groceries to the Peterson family, who Olivia Sanchez had a file on. I read through it last night. She had many notes about them."
Cas stood ready by the driver's side. Dean hugged Charlie goodbye and came around.
"Oh, ok," Carl agreed, "Um, but it's a weird'un. If you guys need anything at all, I'm-"
The others nodded as if that were the last word on the subject and went to pack their gear. Elijah trailed after Cas. Dean hesitated on the steps, though. It didn't feel right. They were children still, and shouldn't children be cared for?
So he gave her a big smelly hug anyway.
"But when new families moved in," she continued, "families with children, he coveted those children. So he took them. Killed them. Somehow that bound their spirits to his. That's where he got his power. He was so... greedy. Twisted."
"Pain purges sin." Gail continued as if he hadn't said anything.
"Dean-"
"Well, the one downside of healing you," Dean said to the priest, "is that now you're going to be the main suspect in this murder thing." Everyone looked at him in shock, and he held his hands up. "I'm not saying we shouldn't have healed you! I'm just saying we have to plan this! Ideas?"
"Hey, I didn't do it!" He held his hands up in surrender. "We're pretty sure Amara did."
There was a loud banging at the outer door at that moment.
There was already a certain car he was looking at for Cas. He may or may not have already emailed the owner.
"I got something!" Charlie called out, and the other three hurried up the stairs to join her.
?" repeated Mary in a rough voice. "That was more important than
"No, it doesn't," Sam said. "You're wrong."
"Who all is in there?"
"Uh, no, you won't, crazy-pants," Dean said, "because
"I WILL TURN THIS FUCKING CAR OFF THE ROAD IF SOMEONE DOESN'T ANSWER ME," Cas thundered. Everyone froze.
"Crowley – Lucifer." Sam tried to get them back on track.
"Ok, so, it's in Iowa. The headline reads 'Priest Claims Demons Walk Among Us.' In the middle of Mass, a social worker named Olivia Sanchez walked in with holes in her feet. She was apparently 'speaking in tongues' and being whipped by something invisible. Then she dropped dead."
"It's breakfast. It's Vince's rider." Crowley pointed out. "I've seen worse."
Dean Winchester stared at his mother. He had seen her face briefly on shapeshifters and in djinn-induced dreams. He had met her ghost. This figure was dressed in the white nightgown she had died in, so he wasn't sure what to expect.
"I didn't mean it." The tears were thick in her voice, even through the phone. "She was pretty, and she always smiled. And I thought that maybe she could help me. I couldn't talk to her, but I could hear her thoughts. And I thought that maybe I could make her hear mine. So I prayed. And I reached out to her... but she never came. And I did it again with the delivery boy.
"We're here to talk about Olivia Sanchez," continued Sam.
They had to park on the side of the main road as the drive up to the Peterson's farm was blocked by a gate with a large, handmade "NO TRESPASSERS" sign hung on it.
Jody looked confused. "Thank you?"
Sam nodded, "So, that was him three days ago." He scrolled and found another picture. "And this...is him last night at the opening of a food kitchen. Notice anything missing?"
Dean was well aware that his mental state was not exactly healthy at the best of times. He felt old and settled in his coping mechanisms, though, and couldn't be bothered to try and fix himself at this point. But probably wasn't healthy that he thought about Mary's short possession as a good thing. That it made Mary seem more like family than any childhood memories. It had only been a ghost, but still, that guy had been pretty intense.
