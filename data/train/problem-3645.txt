Thank you so much to everyone who has interacted in any way with this fic! I appreciate you taking time from your days to read this!
“Cas?” The relief was turning to ice in Dean’s veins. He placed both his hands on either side of Cas’ face and shook the man gently. But Cas did not stir. Dean felt a new wave of wild terror threaten to drown him. He swiveled and turned to the other three members of his family:
so he hasn’t really been able to deal with the legal side. And I’m not sure when he will have time to deal with that, due to Sam’s recovery. So I, was thinking of just starting the process for him. I’d like to help where I can. And I know you are very well connected. Do you know someone who might be able to talk me through the steps or, at least, help me understand the processes surrounding it?”
Dean glanced at him quickly and then looked back at the ceiling. “No, of course not. You could read out loud, you know, if you wanted to.”
“Hey, Castiel! What are you doing up so early?” Hannah called as she walked towards him in the slowly brightening dawn light. Castiel made a non-committal sound, not wanting to let her know that this was a usual occurrence for him. He knew she would suggest they make this morning gathering a usual meeting time for them. Castiel knew she meant well but there was nothing he could think of, at the moment,  that he would hate more than to have the sanctity of his soundless mornings interrupted by another human being. It was nothing personal and was in no way a reflection on her. He just needed time to himself. These moments of reflection helped him to work through the healing process. Pamela had told him it was important that he do what he needs to in order to recharge – regain his strength. So, he did this. He sat in silence and wrote about whatever thoughts he found clouding his mind before he started his day. On the days that the numbness stopped him thinking at all, he just did this in order to ensure he got out of bed.
Castiel shrugged as he headed towards the door, but turned back, “You,wash your face with cold water.”
to touch Dean’s skin, felt almost delirious with the need to press his lips on the elegant arch of Dean’s throat. Cas wanted Dean closer. He wanted
They drove off, towards their new home, all three of them tone deaf and singing at the top of their voices.
The one thing Dean would not have expected was how quickly Gabe and Meg took to Sam. They seemed to genuinely like the kid, and often when Dean got home from work, exhausted and covered in grime from the scrap yard, he would find Sam watching tv with Gabe while yelling animatedly at the screen, or he would find him discussing some sort of sociological concept with Meg. The latest one Dean had walked into was Meg lecturing Sam, a very willing audience, on deconstructing the male gaze in film. They were eating ice cream straight out of the container.
“Well right, how about we regroup in the war room in about an hour?” Dean asked. There was a murmured agreement.
Dean turned to look at Sam and Eileen and gave them a small smile as he finished drinking the purple potion thing Sam had cooked up.
“John’s violent tendencies started a while after the alcoholism set in,” Dean explained, “so by the time he started shoving and throwing punches, I was already around twelve. But Sammy, he uh, was only about six. A kid, you know? So, I just made sure Sam was somewhere safe whenever John stumbled in.”
“Yeah, look, it’s not satanic or some shit,” Dean said quickly, “I just saw it in one of Sam’s AP books or something, and I liked the meaning behind it.”
“Look, this doesn’t have to be a long conversation,” Gabriel started and then cleared his throat. “But I just wanted to apologize.”
“He’s there,” Jack said simply, smiling at Dean. Dean had never ran so fast in his life,  including the time he was chased by a pack of werewolves on a solo hunt in his teens.
Dean did not really know what to say. He wanted to respond. Wanted to say the right thing. But no one would ever accuse Dean of being a wordsmith. So, although he was scrabbling for the words, the only thing that came out was, “So that’s why Jody, on Monday, made a comment about you laughing…?”
When he closed the fridge door he was greeted to Dean’s frustrated. “Oh, for fucks sake!” He was eyeing Cas’ creamer like it had personally offended him.
“Shh, Dean, just breathe.” Castiel shushed him tenderly. He tightened one arm around Dean and swayed him gently while using the other hand to run up and down Dean’s arm in a way he hoped was reassuring.
. But he doesn’t get to give Cas the silent treatment. Not after Cas has been the only one trying. Dean had ignored all his attempts to reach out over the past five years. He doesn’t get to ignore him now too.
“No need to thank me,” Castiel grinned tenderly. Dean’s answering smile wasn’t his usual earth-shattering beam of light, but it was more real than the one he had had when Castiel first walked in. Castiel tangled their legs together and traced Dean’s eyelids with his index finger. He could see how sleep was tugging at Dean’s lids, how it took a little longer each time for them to open after he blinked.
He walked over to the head of the bed and gently swiped some of Sam’s hair off his forehead with the hand that was not holding onto Cas like he was a lifeline.
. Oh, how he’d missed that sound. Cas thought his knees would give out. He attached his lips to Dean’s neck, licking the expanse of skin as his hands dropped to the buckle on Dean’s belt. It had been so long since he’d done anything like this, since he even wanted anything like this. If his senses weren’t so completely submerged in Dean, he might even have been nervous.
“No, stay,” Sam said as he watched Dean’s reaction to Cas’ intended departure. Sam knew something was going on but was still, evidently, confused. There would be time to explain everything later. They had time.
It had taken six months of therapies and rehabilitation after the incident before Sam fully recovered. He had to repeat a year in school, but that didn’t stop him from absolutely excelling once he was back on his feet. His acceptance letter to Stanford was currently stuck to the fridge with a cowboy shaped magnet that Cas bought for Dean after they had spent a weekend in Dodge City.
Dean took control of the situation. He dialed Billie’s number to find out where he should switch off the water and talk about next steps. Meanwhile, Cas walked over to the bed and grabbed his clothes that had been strewn on the bed. He grimaced when he realized it was his last clean pair of boxers and his only clean t-shirt that was not Dean’s old shirt. He was grateful that none of his electronics seemed to have sustained any damage. He piled everything dry into his suitcase and carried it over to the couch in the living area. He then returned to his room to strip the bed of the wet sheets and pillowcases, he piled these with his sopping clothes and tossed them into the washer.
At exactly ten to three, Castiel put down his book and grabbed his maroon hoodie from where it hung on the back of his chair. He straightened out his bedding and slipped on his shoes before heading out the door. Castiel was currently the only resident that did not have a roommate, and he enjoyed the privacy this allowed, even if the room did not lock and the nurses entered without knocking.
“Aren’t you supposed to say I’ve got to do it for myself,” Dean sighed, a sad half smile pulling at his lips.
“Don’t apologize,” Castiel smiled, “And please, I want you to know. I am doing better. I am so much better. You can breathe again and sleep soundly.” Meg said nothing, just smiled and patted the side of his face gently.
And sitting here next to Cas now, as he watched everyone in the room inhale the food and make noises of appreciation, he thought he would never tire of the childlike wonder that Cas was watching everyone with now.
Dean opened the basket and pulled out a thick quilt. He draped it over Baby’s hood before hopping up and patting the side next to him. Cas joined him, although his scramble up was a little inelegant. Dean couldn’t help the rush of fondness that ran through him as he watched Cas settle down next to him.
Dean wanted to bang his brains out against the wall when, for the umpteenth time, he was treated to a highlights reel of his and Cas’ relationship. He thought of how Cas, in nothing but his boxer briefs, used to sit on the kitchen counter while Dean cooked, how he always tackled Dean into bear hugs when Dean passed his exams, how he almost burnt down his off-campus apartment in their junior year trying to make chicken soup for Dean when he got the flu.
“I am busy rebuilding heaven at the moment, restructuring it so that it’s no longer separate but interlinked,”
“I have missed you all,” Jack admits, eyes darting automatically to the place at the table Cas usually sat and his shoulders sagged visibly. Dean slung his arm across Jack’s back and hugged him lightly as he looked at the empty space that had caught the kid’s attention.
Cas smiled despite himself, his heart tearing with the warring affection and sadness that were both currently flowing through him.
Dean was unsure whether this was aimed at Dean’s very confusing behavior or the look the guy was giving him. He didn’t really care.
“Look, you’ve been travelling for over a day, I think you should just go to sleep. Call me in the morning, and we can figure out next steps, okay?” Meg suggested.
Dean, without really thinking about it, wrapped his hand around Castiel’s wrist that was abusing his hair. Castiel inhaled sharply at the contact.
“Jack?” Cas asked, looking at his son. His chest swelled with love and affection when his son looked back at him.
The words weren’t accusatory, but even Dean could hear how the betrayal he felt leaked into the syllables.
back in, he seemed incapable of masking any of it. He did not have practice in masking how he felt, neutralizing his facial features. This resulted in him being extremely expressive, his heart on his sleeve and his thoughts splayed out in his face. Dean hadn’t told him any of this, enjoying the play of emotions on his features too much to make Castiel self-conscious about it. So even though it was evident that he was trying to seem impartial, his entire demeanor screamed distrust and frustration.
There was a beat, a moment, a second of shared air before Castiel closed the distance, and his lips were on Dean’s.
Castiel turned to look at him. “I am excited about starting this new phase. I fear leaving here, leaving the structure.” He swallowed heavily. “I am terrified that I am not strong enough for the life that awaits me outside of this little pocket of unreality. I am sad to be leaving you, and then feeling idiotic for feeling as miserable as I do because it will only be for two weeks.”
“I confronted them, which I know is stupid, but hindsight is always twenty-twenty. I tried to get them to leave, but they kept saying that they wouldn’t leave without her. They just kept getting angrier and angrier. There were four of them. And suddenly, one of them pulled out a gun. Before I had time to think, a shot went off. But the thing is, Alex… Alex had come into the room. In the commotion, I hadn’t heard her. She jumped in front of me.”
Castiel had taken a liking to the young woman and felt a sense of protectiveness toward her. Claire was angry and often violent, but Castiel saw through the armor to the scared child she was, an echo of the fear that had lived inside him for so many years. At eighteen, she was the youngest person here, and although Castiel, at the age of twenty-three, was the second youngest person currently being housed at
… because Sam has been there, in that godforsaken hospital room, not waking up, and I.. I’ve been here, being
Also, a shout out to my best friend, who is a medical student, who talked me through the different stages of a coma. She didn't know it was for this fic but it really was brilliant information. If I have completely misunderstood what she was saying, she will likely inform me when she reads this, and then I will correct it. If you read it before she does, I am sorry if the information is incorrect. I love you L!
And these didn’t relent; Dean was treated to a torturous stream of memories, but as the late hours of the night bled into morning, these images became interspersed with things he really couldn’t afford to think about: the taste of Cas’ lips, the perfect scratch of Cas’ stubble against the sensitive skin of his inner thigh, the feel of Cas’ teeth digging into his shoulder while Cas moved inside him, the breathy desperate sound Cas made when he came.
Dean drew back, deliberately dragging his arm across Cas this time, chasing the feeling of skin on skin. He moved Cas’ hand from his chest and placed it on the side of his throat as he lay back down. His one arm propped below his head and the other grabbing Cas’ arm and pulling him down. Cas did not say anything but conceded to the unasked request, eyes never leaving Dean. He mirrored Dean’s position, one arm pillowing his head, but kept his other arm stretching the distance between them, his hand on Dean’s throat.
bed for the foreseeable future, he realized that the sleep that usually evaded him was now rushing at him with a breakneck speed . He was exhausted. He was not exactly sure why. Maybe the fact that he was still healing from the accident. Maybe because it was an exceptionally draining day. He wasn’t sure, but he felt his eyes burning and closing on their own volition, a lot earlier than he usually hit the sack. To compound this was Castiel’s soft breathing from across the room, which lulled him gently into that warm half-conscious state. But right before he could take that final plunge, dive into nothingness, a picture burned into his retinas. His mind’s eye projected a picture of a young boy with disheveled dark hair and expressive blue eyes cradling a jar of honey to his chest as his faceless parents scorned him. His heart jerked, and his eyes stung. He turned onto his side, so that he was facing the room and cautiously whispered, “Cas?”
“Yeah, blood pressure, heart rate, checking the brace around your chest, things like that. We usually do it daily, but given your medical history, we’re going to do it twice a day, at least for the first week.”
“No!” Dean panicked, his voice coming out way more emphatically than he intended. But the thought of Cas using his own hard earned, and very limited money, to try and fix a problem Dean created shot a line of all-too-familiar guilt through his body.
“Of course, Dean. You’re my brother. Even before what you mentioned earlier. I could see the effect he had on you. How his absences bothered you, how losing him killed something in you, every time,” Sam was speaking slowly, as if he was considering each word carefully.
“Well, you’ve been through a lot with the whole ‘being with a guy’ thing, and on Monday, when we were kind of holding hands, you pulled away when Jody knocked on the door.”
“Okay, yeah it’s a little confusing. Let’s backtrack,” Eileen clarified. She ran her hand through her hair as her face scrunched in concentration.
Dean got up and headed out the door, ready to start looking when a very familiar sound echoed through the halls.
“You heard my prayer?” Sam asked, smiling at his surrogate son while holding Eileen’s hand under the table.
“I’m here Dean. And I won’t leave you again. I’ll never leave you.  I swear it.” Cas’ voice filled the room, the sentiment making Dean feel as if his cobblestone heart was being cracked open.
“So… why?” Dean choked out. Cas started rubbing circles on his back, slowly and calmly. He breathed deeply, and Dean heard the sound and subconsciously copied him.
“I need to find Amara,” Dean repeated. No inflection, nothing but neutral. Castiel would have been concerned about the extreme change in emotion if it weren’t for the look in Dean’s eyes. His entire voice screamed indifference, but there was something brewing in his eyes, something behind the vacant look that had settled on his face.
When Castiel finished pulling on his pajama pants and one of Dean’s old T-shirts that he sneakily packed the previous night, he grabbed the last bag sitting at the foot of his newly made bed. It was a small paper bag containing a small, lined notebook. He had been looking for things to spruce up his room, when the A5 book caught his attention.
“… So, yeah. As I said earlier, she’s awesome. She keeps Sam in check, you know? But she really loves him. And after everything he went through, he deserves that.”
His words landed like well-aimed punches, striking Cas until he felt like he might double over from the pain, but Dean’s eyes were still simmering, the fire blazing there making it look like his green eyes were downright glowing. Dean wasn’t done. Cas watched Dean’s jaw as it tightened, as his shoulders jerked in shallow breaths.
Dean hadn’t really trusted anyone in his life. Well, excluding Sam and Cassie, that is. And even then, most of his nights were haunted by a panic that was in the shape of Sam growing up and outgrowing Dean.
“Cas,” Dean whispered brokenly, his knuckles turning white where they were clutching the doorframe. His body was taut and high strung. “Cas, baby, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean it. I… I don’t know why I get so angry. I just know… I know that it’s… i- it’s just always been there,” he inhaled sharply, his face twisting, as if the words themselves were costing him something. “And when things go bad, it just… it comes out. And I can’t… I can’t stop it. No matter how… how bad I want to, I just can’t stop it.” Dean crumbled to the floor of their room, clutching his chest.
Nothing about the string of men Meg insisted he talk to online even garnered enough interest to set up a date. Meg eventually took it into her own hands when Cas had been single for two years and insisted he go out with Balthazar. They had an awkward date and a disastrous kiss which ended with Cas breaking down because of how
In essence, after the incident with John, the force of the blow had caused a traumatic brain injury, which Dean already knew. The only severely complicating factor was the fact that Sam was comatose. They wouldn’t be able to tell the extent of the damage until Sam was awake and cognizant again. But, the good news was, although Sam had not fully woken up yet, the possibility of him not waking up, the godforsaken “
Secondly, I really want to say thank you to everyone who has left kudos and commented on this fic. Hearing your thoughts and your engagement with this story makes me so unbelievably happy and grateful. So, thank you.
“Dean,” Castiel said gently, sitting himself up so that he could take both of Dean’s hands in his, “I’m so sorry you went through that. And, whenever you want to talk, just know, I will listen.
Claire, the curious detective that she is, was the one who told Castiel that she had seen Dean sneak in at the start of both meals, inhale some food and leave before scurrying out again. This, of course, explained why he missed Dean, because he had been late to both meals as he was waiting for him in their room. Furthermore, she was also the one to inform him that Dean was no longer in the fishbowl. She suspected he was in Adam’s room as he had been without a roommate ever since Max was released. Castiel had gone to look after lunch, but he didn’t find him or Adam. He did find Dean’s jacket, however, hanging over the desk chair. After that, he had just gone back to their room and tried to read, but he mostly just stared at the empty bed.
“Not sure?” Castiel’s voice was barely above a whisper. The soft sound somehow incongruous with the bright sun streaming through their window – the security bars casting a strange shadow pattern on the floor.
“I’m here Dean,” came the angel’s reply as he placed his hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean was suddenly very distracted by the feel of Cas’ skin on his. With the lack of sight enhancing his other senses, Dean could feel every inch of Cas’ hand, feel each individual groove of his fingertips. Dean resisted the urge to lean into the touch and demand more.
He had expected to feel the loss of their presence severely today. Being with both of them, then watching both of them leave was something he had vehemently feared facing, the anxiety almost crippling in its ferocity. He recalled the bone-crushing fear he had felt when Meg had left after those first few visits, at the start of his program. How the loneliness had walked in and sat down next to him on his bed, all empty spaces and corrupted words. How it had whispered in his ear that this time, Meg would see him for who he truly was: a broken, disgusting shell of a person. How it had persuaded Castiel to believe that the weighted feeling of loneliness would intensify, would drag him down deeper into himself. How the chasm between him and the outside world would only ever continue to grow.
It was far from perfect, though. Dean was on the opposite side of the table, not next to him. They never touched, not even allowing enough proximity for accidental brushes of hands or legs. And Cas
Dean launched himself at the man and wrapped his arms around him tightly. Cas hugged him back, holding on to Dean as tightly as he held on to him.
Castiel ran his hand through Dean’s hair for a few seconds before replying, “That is the end goal, of course, but until you get there, it’s okay if the only reason you’re alive and safe is for someone else.”
“Uhmm,” Dean had scanned his brain, trying to think past the nonsensical flashes of memories, “picking up Sam from school?” The thought sounded more like a question, and suddenly, the panic surged and amplified.
“I showered and used some of your aftershave,” Castiel admitted as he walked Dean over to the one of the two beds closest to the far wall. He deposited him, not so gently, on the unforgiving mattress. Dean could feel darkness clouding his vision. A daunting, yet expected, effect Dean was all too familiar with from years of trying to use alcohol to numb his mostly self-inflicted internal wounds. But, he didn’t want to sleep yet. Couldn't. He needed to talk to Castiel. He needed to make this right -as much as he could.
“Yeah,” Cas breathed, and before Dean really knew what was happening, Cas had flung himself towards Dean, wrapping him in an embrace. Cas smelled heavenly, and Dean grinned as he fit his chin into the juncture between Cas’ neck and shoulder, relishing in the feel of the stubble gently scraping against his cheek.
He continued working Dean as Dean fumbled Cas out of his slacks. The second Dean touched him, his vision abruptly went hazy.
Cas swallowed and leaned down to grab his suitcase. He shouldn’t be this affected by Dean’s animosity. Not this many years later. It shouldn’t even register.
Dean huffed out a breath and then nodded. “Usually, you know, I didn’t let Sam near him. I never told Sam what happened when he got that way. But he saw it this time and he nearly goddam lost his mind. But I convinced him it was fine, that it wasn’t worth the effort.”
Dean grinned as he shut the trunk and gestured to the basket. “I wanted a little alone time with you.”
“Cas, is everything okay?” Dean asked as the other man started straightening the already straight sheets.
This was the third time Dean had seen Bobby since his memories returned. And Dean was one hundred percent sure that he wouldn’t have made it through the previous fourteen days if it hadn’t been for those visits and the phone calls.
“Castiel, are you still suicidal?” she had asked, completely straightforward. Her eyes trained on his face in a manner that had made him squirm. He was not used to being the center of the concentrated attention of another human being.  He’d spent far too long learning how to melt into the shadows to understand what to do with the spotlight cast by an unwavering look.
“You’re right. I just, sitting here with him like this… It’s difficult to not feel like a failure, you know? And I hate the idea of him being there, being out of reach.” Dean whispered softly sitting back down and leaning his head on the back of the couch.
“Dean, there was a reason you agreed to come here, hopped up on painkillers or not. Can you tell me what that is?”
so there were tons of handwritten notes (some in difficult codes) and there were also letters from different Men of Letters chapters in various languages. From what Sam could tell, some members had even attempted to enter the dimension, but very few were successful and of those that were, very few came back. They had spent the first week deciphering as much as they could. As they uncovered more and more lore, the information started making less and less sense and Dean was becoming increasingly hostile. Sam hated seeing his brother in pain and hated more that he could do nothing to ease his suffering.
“I thought you would want to see him alone first, but perhaps … would you want me to come with you?” Cas asked as his thumb stroked across Dean’s skin.
“Yes, but I said some things that could potentially make him angry,” Cas said. Just because finally admitting to Dean that he was in love with him was his ultimate happiness, his definition of unadulterated bliss, it did not mean that it was what the hunter had  wanted to hear. Cas may still be learning about humans and human emotions, but Metatron had put enough stories about unrequited love in his head for him to understand what Dean was going through. Dean was probably angry that Cas had admitted it, had changed their friendship, had added another layer of complication to his life. But Cas could not bring himself to regret his decision. Would never be able to. It had been as if a weight had lifted off his chest, a very heavy weight that had been dragging him under since he first touched Dean in Hell. A weight he wouldn’t trade for anything because it had meant being in Dean’s life, but he did not want to be held down anymore, he wanted to live his truth and cherish it. But Cas could explain to Dean that he didn’t need anything from him. He never had. He didn’t need Dean to reciprocate, wanted it sure, but he didn’t need it. He would stay by his side for as long as Dean would have him, with no expectations.
“But Alex was a runaway for a reason. Her biological  family weren’t good people, and they didn’t like that they had lost her. Alex had been one of the main breadwinners in a family of eight. They didn’t care about her. They didn’t love her. They just wanted to use her,” Jody’s voice caught, “So one night, long after all the court dates and papers and all of that, someone broke into the house. I’m a Sheriff, so I grabbed my gun the second I heard the glass shattering. It was them, her family, and they had come to either get her back or get revenge. I called for backup, and when I went to leave my room, Alex was already standing outside my door. I yanked her in, told her to wait there. I found them destroying the lounge.” Jody’s face paled and she closed her eyes.
Dean hated that they didn’t get much time to catch up, to talk about anything else, but there was a lot Dean had to get caught up on with Sam.
“Deal,” Dean said, as he pushed himself off the wall and started walking towards the kitchen. Cas’ heart was beating at triple the normal rate as he got off the couch to follow Dean.
As always, thank you all so much for continually reading, leaving kudos and leaving comments. It never fails to make my day!
When they were together, Dean and Cas never fought. Not really. They bickered, sure. Annoyed each other, naturally. But they never actually
One side of Dean’s mouth twitched up in a brief, half smile before his mouth fell into a hard line. “What is this, Cas?”
“Huh, God’s watching Moana,” Sam said incredulously. Cas smiled, “He’s right. Hay-Hay is very entertaining.”
“Dean, Stevie is sitting right outside…” Cas started, and Dean was too kiss-drunk to hear the hesitation there.
As the night started blurring into the early hours of the morning, he realized what the worst part was. The absolute worst part was watching himself, repeatedly, saying nothing. His silence was what hurt the most. He didn’t say it back. Dean jerked up, his mind trying to work through the smog of sleep deprivation. Had he ever said it? Had he ever told Cas he loved him? Even in a platonic, brotherly way? The answer burned its way into his consciousness – the fog around his brain dissipating instantly.
“Uh, it’s an anti-possession symbol,” Dean blurted out, trying to diffuse the pressure that felt like it was wrapping around his windpipe.
“And then, we were driving home, John and I, and I was telling him that he was done. That he was never to come near us again and then… he didn’t care. Of course, he didn’t. But he cared if I was going to report him to the police. Sam was unconscious, his blood still staining the back of the car we were driving in, and all he cared about was whether or not he was going to get fucking arrested.”
“Why do you ask?” Cas cocked his head to the side, the slight head tilt was now one of Dean’s favorite things, like, ever.
“The bathroom is over there,” Dean assumed Cas had pointed in the direction of the second bathroom, but he didn’t see it. He was perfectly content to keep his eyes locked where they were, to stare at this god-awful carpet for the next nine days.
Dean didn't let Jack finish talking and went back to hug the boy.  He didn't say anything.  He didn't have the courage.  He didn't even dare think about everything Castiel had said two nights ago.  Dean wept silently, tears so quiet that even Chuck wouldn't be able to hear them.
"Not much" He hesitated when he answered the angel's question and quickly walked towards the door still speaking
"I'm on the Highway to Hell too" Dean said smiling as he opened the door and saw Cas lying on using the shirt, but Castiel didn't listen, he continued with his eyes closed and his arms still over his eyes.  Dean soon realized that Cas was distracted.  It was usually something that never happened.  Castiel never seemed to be distracted or with his head away.  And when in the rare times this happened, when he heard Dean's voice suddenly took him out of the sinking of his thoughts he always got agitated.
Dean responded by raising his eyebrows.  The hunter patted Jack on the shoulder as he left the kitchen.  Before Dean walked away, Jack called him.
Castiel and Dean were sitting at the kitchen table.  Dean wore his usual gray hob partially covering his hot dog pijamas.  Cas noticed Sam's lost look when he entered the kitchen.  Dean was too distracted sipping the almost cold coffee from the cup as he fiddled with his cell phone looking for something funny to make Castiel smile.
Hey thank you for read! I know I took so long to release my second chapter and i didn't even finish. Those past months was so crazy. I'll won't promise to bring the PART II next week, but who knows?
In that moment, the only thing dean could thought about was Cas. The words he said to him. He touch the mark of Cas's bloody handprint on his jack. At this moment Dean put himself on knees and prayed to Cas.
And that something was Cas's death. Dean's body needed to put out everything Cas told him the night before. Word by word. Letter by letter. The fury of the moment, the death of his best friend, the hatred for chuck, it was all too much, there was no space inside him.
He closed his eyes tightly, but the feeling only got worse and worse. He clenched his fists against his closed eyes so hard he could feel death. And in that moment when he felt that old sensation of death, his stomach came running back to the place where belongs. He got up from the bed running and threw up in the sink.
An almost full bottle of white wine rested on the wooden center they had taken up there the second time they were all together. The wine had been there since the two made up, since Dean kneeling in purgatory prayed for Castiel and for one last time the angel was able to hear him. They celebrated, they didn't know what. Reconciliation, for sure, but they did not speak that word, they did not touch on that subject. They knew they had something to celebrate and that was what they did. Dean reached over and picked up the bottle of Chardonney. It was an expensive wine, from the year 2006, creamy, silky and vibrant. Dean knew all about that bottle of wine, it was Castiel's favorite. He knew that the wine was exclusive and awarded, he knew that the wine had been made with grapes from a single vineyard in Agliano Terme. and aged for 20 months in French oak barrels. It was the only drink that Castiel drank with pleasure in his eyes and not for convenience and custom like beers and whiskey.
Dean Winchester was empty. Empty as the world. Empty as hell. Empty as the heaven. And empty Dean walked through the bunker, his steps weighed tons he felt empty and heavy, as it was heavy to be empty. He didn't understand that feeling. How could anyone be full of nothing  and feel weigh like that?
“Don't blame yourself, Jack.  It's not your fault, he loved you.  He chose you as a son, any of us would have done the same for you because you are family.  It's hard to forget, but don't blame yourself okay?  Eat candy, fill yourself with crap, be sad, suffer, but suffer without guilt.  He was happy to love you too, to make you a member of the family, ”
Dean didn't know how time it was. How many minutes he interrupt himself in the middle of the pray to cry. Dean was full of despair and hopeless. When he said that he was hoping cas was hearing him, he as begging for hope. He begged cas for hope. Cas was the only hope he ever knew, and now he lose. Dean  didn't got back to the bad. He fell down miserable on the floor where his knees was, and fell asleep again.
How many times did he think Cas was different and that, perhaps in a million years, he could feel something too.  The Eternity passed to Dean without he even notice, and how many times he smiled sitting there imagining him and Cas living a life together after all this, a retirement, a normal job.  They would never be normal, he knew.  But with Castiel beside him, he could not even see a future of wars and battles, but a peaceful future.  A future of love.  A normal future.
They stayed there in silence until the night was fully settled.  They never brought it up again.  Castiel showed his colors to Dean and Dean kept the colors inside him.
"I hope so, fate is coming,Cas ... I feel it. It’s Do or die, but I am glad that we are together in this”
was his first thought but when Castiel moved his lips against his every thought he could have completely disappeared.
Dean heard behind him but he still couldn’t believe him, he thought for a quick second that maybe heaven was back to being how it was before and this was some sick memory.
“But Castiel, angel of the lord, the one who,” he made the best Cas voice he could, “Gripped me tight and raised me for perdition, CONFESSED ME BEFORE HE DIED. IS TOO BUSY TO SAY HELLO?”
Dean never thought he wanted a wife, an apple pie kind of life so he wasn’t too bothered about Sammy having one, he was happy about it.
“Explain. Now.” Dean tried his best to remain as furious as he can be while Cas looked the cutest angel of the garrison.
“Wait. It works here?” Dean just stared at his kid. He paused the show, this needed his full attention.
Dean couldn’t believe that a kid that he, his brother, and his angel raised as their own was grown up and did all of this.
“And I love my angel, too.” He smirked, he couldn’t believe he was saying it, to a blushing Cas no less.
“So let’s finish these pies and go over to my parent’s house. They are probably waiting for us already.”
Castiel looked around his place, the dark polished wood all around his house, the black couch with a big screen with his favorite episode of Dr sexy now, the bar area, the kitchen full of appliances, books with his favorite recipes, some pies he started to learned to cook half-done already and smiled.
I’m stubborn, I say things out of anger. You’ve always stood by me, even when I was wrong. You made me see that I’m not as bad as I thought I was.
He smiled like he was proud like he knew his house would look like this, he smiled like he loved him.
Even worse, you got out of that hell hole and didn’t even come to me. I’ve been waiting for you for ages, man.”
It was only when Cas said it to his face that he finally held to that hope of having the love of his life, loving him back.
“I... After the empty took me and I fell asleep, I suddenly was awakened by Jack. He explained everything that had happened and asked for my input on how to rebuild heaven.”
Dean was sure that even though Jack was definitely going to tell him what he asked, Castiel wouldn’t do it. He would still run.
First, he saw hopelessness, fear, anxiety. But after analyzing what Dean said it turned to a glint of hope, of love, of relief. All thanks to some words from Dean.
Sam was just next door, with his wife, and one day, he would be able to meet his son. Dean. He named his son after him. He smiled proudly.
With his confession, Castiel, the angel of the lord, all smite and swordy like, big man of combat. Castiel the soldier, God’s Father, went totally still. More than usual.
“I’m so sorry for telling you the truth if it made you feel uncomfortable, I’m really sorry but it was the only way I thought there was, I-...”
For as long as he could remember, Castiel was never one to run from staring at him while talking to him, either it be to argue back or just to tell him facts as they are.
for goodness sake, with 4 pies between himself and his angel, while holding his hand for everyone to see that the love of his life was next to him.
There was something funny in watching an angel helping him, with the biggest look of concentration, to prepare some simple homemade pies so they could bring them to his parent's house, Dean smiled again taking a sip of his beer.
When Sam facetime her, asking Eileen to come over he was scared.  Afraid to lose her again, and when she refused he get desperate.  They changed the subject, he didn't want to insist, he didn't want to go beyond the limits of Eileen's spaces.  She said she was fine, that she knew how to take care of herself and that was what he clung to with all his strength.  They continued to exchange messages for several late nights.  They suffered because they were apart and couldn't ve able to see each other that much, the cell phone and the messages saved them.
Four folding chairs always stayed on the roof of the bunker. Sometimes the four liked to stay up there, almost never to watch the sun go down. Often to have a beer on sleepless, hot summer nights. Sam, for example, liked to go upstairs to read and when Eilleen was home they both went up on the roof to talk, look at the stars and practice sign language. Cas, when Dean had a quiet night of sleep, he used to spend the late nights on the roof listening to music, he was a big Sam Smith fan. He had heard one day on the radio driving home with Jack. The two loved it and started listening whenever they traveled together. Cas listened beyond the car trips with Jack and felt that Sam Smith described some of his most untouchable feelings. He never let Dean know, so when he asked, he always said he was listening to Zep or any classic rock band. Dean didn't like to go to the roof very much, he preferred to stay at Deancave in his spare time, but that afternoon he wanted to go up, felt the need to watch the sun go down and wanted to remember that Tuesday. Maybe the sky was the same color.
The day before everything happened, the day before chuck decided to erase everyone, the day before Sam lost Eileen, the day before they last exchanged messages, at the day, the day before, she texted him at three in the morning.
“I couldn't sleep, I came to ask you for coffee or something in the kitchen, but I got here and you were snoring.  So, are you coming or are you going to continue sleeping? ”
Castiel remained silent, the hairs on his arms stood on end constantly. The song of the birds louder and louder lulled the soundtrack of that moment and then Castiel showed his wings, not their shadow. It was beautiful, incredible, Dean was startled to notice the angel's wings, it was not a common scene, the only time Dean remembers seeing the wings was also the first day he saw Castiel. But all he could see that day were the shadows of the wings. That Tuesday was different, Castiel's wings were palpable and shone with the colors of the sun reflected in. In the face of Castiel, who now had his eyes closed, shy of showing his wings, a rainbow was forming and spreading over the wings.
Dean smiled awkwardly. He noticed the sadness in the angel's eyes. Of course he did, but he felt comforted in some way, and that comfort was what made him smile. The feelings were always so confused when Cas looked at him like that, as if he always had something to say, as if he wanted to say something with those eyes, but Dean never knew how to decipher it. And God, how he tried.
Sam was awake as usual.  He left the room, the phone was in the pocket of his light blue sweatpants.  Sam walked into the kitchen, his head so full that he couldn't even concentrate on anything, he didn't even notice when he arrived in the kitchen and kept walking.
That night, the night before everything happened, the night before he allowed himself to be happy, the night before he last saved the love of his life.  That night, the night before I said goodbye to Dean for the last time.  That night, one last time Dean entered Castiel's room without knocking.
It was there in that kitchen that they so often made peace after a disagreement. Leaning on the counter while pouring a glass almost full of whiskey in an attempt to loosen the tight lump in the throat that Sam Winchester cried for the first time after Eileen was erased. He barely felt the hot tear burning down his face, he thought it was the effect of the alcohol. He closed his eyes as the whiskey slid smoothly into his body, it was as if the drink acted like the key to a portal freeing Sam from the prison he was feeling.
The green eyes seemed to have lost their vivid color. He didn't remember how he got to the bunker after meeting Sam and Jack, affter…
He didn't hear Dean arrive, he was absorbed in his thoughts as he let some music play on the headphones.  So much going on, so much to fix, to solve.  The end of the world was literally happening and no solution seemed to work, nothing seemed to be able to solve it.
He didn't throw up. He had no strength. Dean just staggered back to bed. If the void existed, it was inside him now.
A few moments before he had gone into the next bedroom, which Castiel used to spend the long eternal nights of listening to Dean sleep.  Watching his sleep carefully and when the hunter screamed absorbed in nightmares, the angel would quietly enter the room and calm his turbulent mind by freeing him from those horrible dreams.  Cas did this more often than he would have liked, but he didn't mind, he liked to listen and watch Dean sleeping.  The angel's heart always calmed when he spent a few minutes there in Dean's room watching him sleep.  A peaceful smile always formed on his lips, although he didn't realize it.
Thru his memories Dean winchester remember the days before Castiel die. The memories if those moments are like a comfort to him, Dean who now it's empty it's been trying so hard survive without Cas. He can't even think about the empty world, the only thing Dean think about it's Cas. The look they always shared, the talks. Dean pray to Cas every sigle day keeping the si gle light of his faith, of his hope on the tiny possibility of the angel hear your desperate and prayers of love.
Dean didn't go back to his room, he didn't want to pass down the hall. He didn't want to stay at home, but he we can do, if they couldn't leave?  He had nowhere to go. There was no one in the world but him and Sam and Jack. He didn't think about Chuck, he didn't think about Sam, Jack, the friends they had lost. Dean was empty, it was as if the world now without souls, with no one but the three of them, echoed inside him.
Dean rubbed the back of his right hand over his face but the tears continued to fall. He heard Sam Winchester scream from the kitchen. He was not frightened, he knew what it was, he knew how his brother must have been feeling, he thought, that if the scream didn't stop he would run. But what could happen at that time. The scream stopped. The sky was dark. Dean closed his eyes and dreamed of Castiel that Tuesday afternoon.
He raised his head and looked at his reflection in the mirror. His eyes was so deep and red. So many hours of crying that he barely remember how he fell asleep.
heeey, thank you for reading again! I appreciate every of you, i swear. It's been a huge week, my laptop broke so I'm writing on my cellphone. I don't know if you notice but I'm building a 30 days of Dean praying to cas, til we got cad back from empty and make them grown old together. So I'll bring these types if memories of Dean with cas to build the story. Thank you so much for reading 💖💖
But that night was different.  Dean entered on the room.  It was after two in the morning.  It even crossed Dean's mind that Cas was asleep, but he soon dismissed the absurd idea, Castiel never slept.  He didn't have to.  "He's an angel, your idiot" he repeated to himself as he walked slowly around the room to sit on the wooden chair beside the bed.  Dean's thoughts were very troubled by everything that was going on, but the fact that Castiel didn't notice his presence made his mind go blank for a moment in order to focus on a single detail:
“Dean, I, um… I've been calling him, I've been praying for Castiel, but he's… it's useless isn't it?  I'm sorry, this is my fault if wasn't for me he would be still here… ”
He screamed. The scream had been so powerful that it could be heard by any soul who was miles away from the Bunker, if there were souls in the world. Sam shouted anger, hatred, crying, miss them, sadness and despair; and then when the scream died, his body fell to the floor. There was no more numbness, he felt, he felt everything. Unlike the brother there was no place for emptiness in Sam, he was full to the brim and overflowing.
Dean looked at him, tenderness evident in his gaze, but there was something else there, something that made Castiel feel like he was burning from the inside.
Cas sighed, “Yeah, but I don’t think the mattress is going to dry out before this evening.” He patted the couch cushion next to him, “It looks like I’m going to become well acquainted with this couch.”
“I need… I need some air. I need,” Dean was out of the door before he could think twice. He turned back to face the room filled with the deathly silent members of his family. His eyes landed on Cas.
“Where were you going?” He mumbled while wiping at his eyes with his left hand. “Fucking off to the club I’m not allowed to join?”
Dean felt his body tense up at the sound, even full well knowing Billie could not reach them here. Not
Dean cut himself off , swallowing audibly and then lifted his hands to rip at his hair. Castiel caught his wrists after he violently tugged once. “Stop that.”
Dean, at least, was comfortable enough by now to walk straight into her office and pour himself a cup of water from the jug on the center of the coffee table.
“Dean, stop!” Sam cried behind him. But he could not, he would not. It felt so good, the agony in his shoulder and the agony in his fist as it continually connected with the rough bark were focal points, pulling him out of the tidal wave of emotions flooding through him. Dean did not know how to deal with the emotions eating at him, but he knew how to handle the physical sensations. He hit the tree another time, and he felt the bones splinter, the sound seeming to echo in the quiet night. But before he could hit it again, Sam grabbed him and pulled him back roughly.
“It’s not either. I mean, obviously they would have liked to have seen some kind of improvement in the past six weeks, but there has been none. But he hasn’t gotten worse yet, and that is a good sign. I’ll be honest with you, in most cases, coma patients wake up after two to three weeks, but there have been cases where people wake up years later.”
“Dean…” Cas tried again, but Dean kissed him once more, swallowing the sounds. He gripped Cas shoulder’s tightly as he brought his head down to suck on Cas’ neck and graze his teeth along the column of his throat. Dean inhaled as he nosed the hollow behind Cas' ear.
“I am chaos incarnate,” Castiel deadpanned, and Dean burst out laughing. The sound was gruff and uncontrolled. It was quickly becoming Castiel’s favorite sound, a melody that beckoned to him.
“I have since gotten an undergraduate degree and have done a vast amount of electives on various topics, including the humanities and topics such as sexuality” Castiel said and then shrugged, “And I have Meg as a best friend.”
“Dean, you were not in the right mind to look after Sam because you have not looked after yourself for fifteen years. And on top of that your mind and psyche was riddled with misplaced guilt. Dean, you are both important. You both deserve help. You were looking out for Sam, and I was looking out for you. And everyone else in your life who looks out for you agreed with me and my decisions, including Ms. Harvelle and Mr. Singer, as was mentioned to you before.”
Cas lowered his bag and turned around so that he could lock the door. While his back was turned, he closed his eyes and tried to inhale deeply. He tried, and failed, to ignore the eyes he knew were trained on his back.
Castiel sighed, but fondness bloomed in his chest, “So who do you want to talk about then? The porn stars?”
“I’m sure you are,” Castiel agreed absent mindedly and then blushed again. Dean’s own cheeks filled with a tinge of red as he eyed Castiel curiously.
want to. And you shouldn’t see them with the hopes of them admitting how ridiculously they fucked up. Because you know they won’t, and it will only hurt you. You need to focus on you now, Cas. You need to be your biggest priority.”
. And at night, they would all do something fun together, like watch a movie or play board games. Dean had been delighted, and admittedly shocked, to find that
Dean averted his eyes and stared hard at the faded mustard yellow carpet and huffed in his general direction. That counted as a greeting, right?
, with Cas wearing the cheap cowboy hat and his trench coat. He had looked so … undeniably Cas. And Dean had wanted to remember that, wanted to always come back to the joy he felt sitting in the car with the man he had lost and who had returned to him.
Dean pulled back reluctantly and dropped his arms. He looked to Cas. He wanted to say something. He wanted to say everything. He wanted his words to be an avalanche that drowned Cas to make up for those crucial minutes in which he was silent. But instead, “How the fuck could you do that to me Cas?” erupted from him.
Dean flicked his eyes towards Castiel who was obviously trying and failing not to look proud. They had made two pies in their session, enough for them, the other patients and the nurses. They had served it after dinner at the start of the movie night, and, so far, the response was overwhelmingly positive. Even Dean had to admit, after gobbling down two slices, that it tasted better than when he normally made it alone.
Thank you so much to anyone who has engaged with this story! It means so much and genuinely acts as fuel for my writing. I really appreciate it!
“My friend, Meg, confirmed. As well as my brother,” Cas replied, ignoring the thick feeling in his throat. He hasn’t seen his brother in just over a year and hasn’t spoken to him at all in almost the same length of time. Gabriel had a habit of disappearing to far off lands, failing to keep a cell phone charged or keep track of where wifi hotspots were. Last week, Meg had told Castiel, much to his chagrin, that she had finally tracked Gabriel down.  Apparently, he had found his way to Monte Carlo.
“Good. Now I’m going to call Charlie in here, and the three of us will discuss your schedule and if you have any concerns or need me to explain why certain things are there, I will. Happy?”
Thank you so much to everyone who has read, interacted or subscribed to this story! You guys are so amazing and I so appreciate every single view, kudos and comment!
Because maybe it wasn’t such a good idea. Maybe Cas wouldn’t like it. Maybe he had hyped it up with all the teasing and secrecy. He started to fidget a little as Cas stared at him.
“Does your good week have anything to do with that tall drink of water you were just drooling over?” Gabriel asked, waggling his eyebrows. Castiel cleared his throat but didn’t answer his question.
deserves that. Ever. Kids deserve to be loved, cared for, accepted and protected, both physically and emotionally. So, you did not deserve that.”
“Can I come in?” Gabriel asked. Castiel gestured him in with his hand loosely and dropped his arm back to the mattress.
Castiel also checked in with Jody a couple of times throughout the day. She was exhausted, as to be expected, and a little emotional. So, to distract her, Castiel asked about Alex-what she was like, her favorite bands, movies, what her friends were like. Jody, like Dean, seemed to be most in her element when talking about the child she was raising.
But Dean kept his distance, spoke more openly than he has in the past three days, but his guard was still up. He didn’t look like he was struggling with the proximity as much as Cas was. And that, in and of itself, was a very specific kind of torture. Knowing that he was the only one who had to surreptitiously shove his trembling hands under his legs to stop himself from leaning across the table and tangling their fingers. Knowing that he was the only one who kept replaying the scene earlier where Dean had held his face, and actively trying to remember how the familiar fingers with the unfamiliar callouses felt against his skin. It would somehow be easier if Dean felt the same longing Cas did, felt the same need to be closer.
“Yeah, I’m worried about him.” Sam said as he scratched the back of his head. There was a silence as the three men nodded. Dean had come to sit next to Cas. He scooped up eggs with a fork with one hand and placed his other hand on Cas’ thigh.
His question must have been obvious in his eyes because Dean cracked a grin, “You have pen marks all over your hands.”
Dean’s expression turned unreadable, but he studied Cas and didn’t break eye-contact. “No, but we can call Billie.”
“I want you to hear what I am saying now,” the angel continued. Cas pushed Dean, turning him slightly so that Dean’s back was flat on the mattress with Cas’ hand still firmly planted on the hunter’s chest. And with the momentum he lifted himself up and swung his leg over Dean’s legs, straddling him. Dean suddenly felt unable to move, pinned by Cas’ gaze, voice and body. Cas lowered himself until he was leaning on his forearms which were framing Dean’s face. The action grazing their naked chests together. Dean’s vision blurred as the sensation of so much
“Didn’t you just start a new medication?” Castiel asked as he started tracing nonsensical patterns onto Dean’s forearm with his free hand.
“Well, it seems that every demon captive they took with fell asleep, like their life force fell asleep immediately upon entering the Empty. And even when they came back the demon never woke up. Nor the person they were possessing. They were alive, they just were not waking up. When they couldn’t find a way to wake up the innocent people being possessed after a few tries, they stopped the experiments. There was no real conclusion but a couple of the people working on it had a theory that once their consciousness was touched by the Empty, they got stuck with the side effects of being there. The Empty is a very old, very powerful cosmic entity, and it seems that once it touched a demon their consciousness was almost enslaved by it. And no one wakes up without the Empty relenting its grip.”
And Castiel was unsure of a lot, but he was definitely not unsure about the fact that they would have a long run.
As Dean sat there, staring at his best friend, a memory popped up in his mind. Dean remembered that Cas once told him that there was a connection between an angel and his vessel which gave him an idea. He repeated the Enochian incantation Cas had used to call Raphael nearly a decade ago into Cas' ear. It had been one of the first times he had heard Cas speak his native tongue, and it had effected him in ways he would never admit to out loud. But he had spent hours repeating the scene over and over, watching Cas’ lips form the words, listening to the low rumble of his voice sounding out the syllables. No, there was just no way Dean would ever forget those sounds. He just hoped that the connection would reach past this life and into the Empty.
He immediately understood why Missouri had insisted that he be forewarned about Sam’s appearance. Even fully warned, his heart twisted at the sight of his little brother.
After another few minutes of silently torturing himself and wondering if he’d be able to manage not eating today so as to avoid Cas completely (which the answer, of course, was a definitive 'no' as he hadn’t eaten last night and he was
The silence that came after was ear-splitting. Missouri stared at him: no anger, no frustration, just an exceptionally neutral look. Somehow, this seemed to slightly lessen the intensity of the thunder in his veins.
Dean broke the eye contact first. He sighed and flicked his eyes away; they rested on what must have been his laptop. He shut it quickly and a little forcefully. The loud metallic sound of it broke the spell and Cas cleared his throat. “Well this is unfortunate.”
Well wasn’t that just fan-fucking-tastic. He really doesn’t need to have the memory of this when he is forced to interact with Cas later.
. I submitted the first chapter to my beta yesterday and I am likely to start posting that in about two to three weeks! It will still be angsty but will be dealing with less heavy subject content.
And then they crushed together - teeth and tongues and lips moving in an ecstasy of fumbling. Dean’s hands slipped down again, trailing Cas’ back until they landed on the angel’s ass. Cas groaned at the contact and Dean felt a manic possessiveness bubbling inside him. He wanted to be the only person who heard that sound, the only person who got to feel Cas this way. Dean pulled Cas in by his ass. The movement caused a friction that had Dean choking. With nothing but the barrier of their respective boxers between them, Dean thought he might explode when he felt Cas’ length hard against his own.
“Just, fair warning, do not ask about the prostitutes in Monte Carlo,” Meg said, a pinched look blooming on her face.
Cas felt his knees attempt to buckle at the sound of that syllable leaving Dean’s mouth. His voice saying Cas’ name unleashed a tidal wave of memories and emotions that he had spent the past five years trying to dam up.
Something hot shot through Dean, and he was suddenly very on board with being late. He grinned, and before Cas got another word out, Dean was on him, pressing his lips to his. Cas let out a breathy sigh as they drew apart, and Dean nipped soft, teasing kisses along his jaw.
Dean had to admit that this latest development between him and Cas definitely helped with his adjustment to
As far as awakenings go, this was one he could definitely get behind. He cracked open an eye, the lid still heavy with sleep and heard a very loud rumble emanating from his stomach. Dean was torn between warring instincts: to either stay right where he was, splayed out on his memory foam or to follow the heavenly scent of cooking bacon. The second rumble in his stomach was accompanied by a painful pang of hunger which seemed to be making up his mind for him. Dean closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, but this time there was another smell invading his senses. A smell that he knew belonged specifically to Cas. Dean bolted upright as the memories from the previous night flooded through him and a smile crawled slowly across his face. The smile froze halfway when he realized that he was
To stay away from the non-existent future his sleep deprived, and very masochistic, brain kept conjuring.
, just better. Apparently having angry sex with an ex was all he needed to get his brain to shut up and leave him alone for a few hours.
A deep sense of comfort washed through Dean as he tightened his hold on Cas. It was a quick kiss, but Dean still felt a little dizzy when he pulled away. He cupped Cas’ cheek in his hand, swiping over the soft skin on his cheekbone with his thumb.
Because Dean still couldn’t be honest with him, still couldn’t offer him a home and he couldn’t offer him protection. Dean instinctively reached out and grabbed Cas’ arm, jolting slightly from the electricity that seemed to flow from the direct skin-on-skin contact (don’t think about it).
“What, did you forget something?” Castiel asked quickly, taking stock of Dean’s appearance, noting that he seemed to have everything.
Dean held on to the photo for nearly forty-eight hours. He ran his finger down Cas’s jaw on the photograph, trying to imagine the rough stubble instead of the glossy page. Trying to hold on to the memory of the warmth he had felt that day, of that feeling of being reunited with Cas.
Besides Jody, she was the only person Castiel believed he had a genuine relationship with here, something that ran deeper than the mutual acquaintance of someone whose brain was the same flavor of broken as his own. Castiel had to admit, however, that being around others who faced the same things he did, had demons in the same shape as his, did bring him a peace he hadn’t experienced before. He did not feel quite as alone as he had, growing up isolated and scared in a small Alabama town. And even if he had to don a mask, this one felt lighter. This was one he could carry.
Which meant that, after dinner, as Castiel and Dean excused themselves to go and finish Castiel’s packing, a mere twelve hours before Castiel’s release, Dean was reprimanding him almost every thirty minutes.
As always, a wonderful thank you to my beta reader, Hellbreaker42 for his feedback and assistance. I appreciate you!
“But I need it.” Dean interrupted him, his voice finally coming back to him, as he watched the anxious movement of Cas’ eyes, the weary set of his jaw.
Fuck, he’d missed that sound. It sent a rush of blanket-warm memories of the two of them, wrapped around each other sharing stories and jokes, through his entire being, freezing him in place.
“It stopped the bleeding, but I know some shit’s still broken,” Dean shrugged. “I’ve been talking to Missouri about potentially continuing as an outpatient with her after things settle a bit with Sam.”
“Sammy’s hurt,” the words scratched out of his throat. Dean clutched his chest which felt like it was splintering, cutting open everything inside him so that he was just bleeding, bleeding, bleeding.
And then suddenly Eileen was gently removing Jack’s koala grip on Cas, bundling him under her arm protectively, as Sam surged forward and threw his arm around Cas and patted him on the back. When he pulled back, Sam was beaming, and Castiel felt a rush of fondness for the younger Winchester.
“Not much of a plan Sammy,” fell out of his mouth before he could stop himself. Sam looked visibly taken aback by the edge in Dean’s tone. A flash of hurt ghosted over Eileen’s face..
Dean felt as if he had just inhaled an entire tank of helium, even if all he could see was Cas’ back.
“Anything. Tell me your dating profile bio. For example,” he said, gesturing to himself, “My name is Dean Winchester. I’m twenty-one years old. I’m an Aquarius. I enjoy sunsets, long-walks on the beach and frisky women. And men.” Dean said. Castiel could have sworn the other man’s eyes flickered to his at that last part. His heart rate tripled, and he could feel it beating insistently at the back of his throat.
Dean pulled Cas towards him. As he hugged him close, he realized he hadn’t intended to say those words for the first time now, not in the backseat of Bobby’s old beat up car. But the words were true and the certainty with which he felt them propelled the syllables forward and out of his mouth before he even had time to think about it.
Gabriel’s eyes lit up. “Oh, absolutely. I know this lawyer, Billie, brilliant and terrifying woman and she owes me a favor.”
“Thirty hours? Did I miss a whole day?” Dean asked, trying to do the math. But his brain was not cooperating with him this soon upon entering consciousness.
“I have a lot of regrets about that,” Dean said after he could force sounds past the lump currently blocking his airway.
“You don’t know me that well,” Dean countered, but his voice was shaky. He looked at Castiel like he
Shortly after their conversation earlier,  Stevie had come in to fetch Dean, to insist that he sleep in the
“What are you referring to?” Cas asked, fully turning on his side, so that his body was mirroring Dean’s.
Dean got up from where he was lounging on his bed and dropped next to Castiel so that they were seated side-by-side on Castiel’s comforter.
If they even got that, because that was the total time awarded to visitors. And, when Dean remembered, he would want to see and speak to Sam, Bobby and Ellen as well. But, Castiel would make the most of it, call and visit as often as Dean would let him.
Dean used his free hand to start picking at his jeans. “Yeah, I can’t remember the week before I woke up in the hospital. Even my early days there are very fuzzy. Amara told me there was an accident…” Dean swallowed heavily, “ I don’t really wanna talk about it.”
Castiel just rocked him and ran his hands through his hair, down his arms, down his back. He placed soft, lingering kisses on his temple, his hair, his cheeks, his fingers, everywhere he could reach. If his words were not enough to convince him, then he would prove it through his actions.
Charlie had been extremely efficient, and the whole process took much shorter than Dean had ever dared to hope. And, she was very entertaining throughout, smiling easily and talking excitedly when Dean had commented on her Deathly Hallows necklace.
“Whatever you said, and I still don’t know because Dean refused to talk about it, didn’t make him angry Cas. It devastated him. I didn’t realize how much at first, I think the mission kept him focused, but as soon as Chuck was dealt with… Dean broke. I have never seen him like that. And I slept in the bed next to his when he came back from literal Hell,” Sam sighed as he rubbed his neck, “It started like the other times. But there was something so concrete this time, something so visibly wrong…”
“The medication seems to be working, the doctors are happy with the combination I’m on now,” Castiel said.
“It’s hard to be away from you when I feel like this, like an open wound,” Dean whispered as he moved his legs – sitting unabashedly on top of Castiel now, his legs straddling Castiel’s lap. Dean also changed the placement of his hands, wrapping them in the hair on the back of Castiel’s head. Dean tugged lightly as Castiel latched his hands firmly onto Dean’s thighs, and Dean couldn’t hold back a smile.
“Dean, that is a lot of pressure and pain for anyone to experience, let alone a child,” Missouri said.
So instead of trying to make sense of the hurricane currently tearing through him, he shoved off the bed and almost leapt to the other side of the room.
“Cas?” Dean dropped to his knees at the side of the bed, placing his hand on Cas’ forehead, reveling in the warm, very much alive, feel of the skin under his palm and counting each of the angel’s breaths.
“You’re not,” Sam retorted, but it was not a challenge – merely a statement. Dean shrugged and sipped his coffee, watching the steam curl around his vision the way the empty had curled…
Cas looked at him warily but did as he was told, as his arms finally lowered and settled at his side.
So, given that there had only ever been two people that he had ever trusted, it was a very surreal experience to suddenly feel the very unequivocal tug to trust this woman with the dark hair that only ever looked like she was humoring Dean when they spoke.
“Yes but that’s not the point we were thinking about. We were talking particularly about the siphoning. And what else one could potentially siphon. Well, one being Jack of course,” Eileen replied.
Dean pulled away slightly so that he could look Cast in the eye, “I’m sorry, man, I didn’t mean to intrude or anything.”
Meg was the Atlas holding up his cracked and run-down world already. He would not add to that, because he knew she would try to be everything he needed her to be. He knew this because if the situation were reversed, he would do the same for her. He would contort himself into any shape, any form, that kept her alive.
“Dean, you have nothing to be sorry for,” Cas said tenderly, “I spoke, and you listened. But Dean, I need to know that you’re okay.”
“Don’t say that,” Castiel said, smiling softly lifting his arm from Dean’s grip to run his hand through his own hair, the dark strands disheveled. Dean decided he had to introduce the new human to a comb before he left. A sharp bolt of pain blazed through his chest at the thought of leaving Castiel
Dean knows what that hair feels like sliding in between his fingers. He knows what those pale lips feel like against his mouth, his throat, his stomach. How they look stretched around his cock. He knows what that laugh, the one captured in that group photo, sounds like. He knows how that laugh warms him. He knows what it’s like to have those eyes focused on him. He knows what it is like to be loved by him.
Dean had balked. He hadn’t realized there was so much wrong with him. Although, admittedly, he hadn’t moved much during this conversation. He had tried to move himself a bit then and had winced when pain had lanced up his sides.
And, now, here he was, watching the sun infiltrate his room without a wink of sleep in his energy reserves.
“He’s in there,” Jack said plainly, “both his life force and his grace are intact.” And Dean had to admit that Cas
Castiel cracked open an eye and watched as Gabriel slid down the door of the built-in cupboard and dropped heavily onto the ground.
did not cry through, Eileen officially joined the Winchester family that she had unofficially been a part of for a long time. She kept her own name, though. Obviously.
Dean frowned, and his heart rate accelerated at the tense set of Cas’ shoulders, of the urgency that seemed to be screaming from the state of things. He stepped towards him, “Cas?”
“I’ve been trying ever since the whole thing with Chuck, but I can’t seem to get in. I don’t have any sway there, and ever since I took on this “godhood” it’s like my soul and my grace have merged into something greater than both but no longer either… so I can’t even get in on a “visitors pass” like Cas did when he went looking for Ruby.” Jack had a small frown on his forehead and he was fidgeting with his thumbs.
“Thank you, but it’s okay. It was a very long time ago. I don’t remember her much. And my father, John, I don’t know. He never really recovered. He wasn’t a great dad. He was a drunk, a bigot, and just so very angry at everything. He was… uh… violent. He found every reason to take out his frustration with how his life ended up out on me. I was the closest target. I figured, he was going to beat me whether I was fucking a guy or not, so, there was no point in hiding it. And the only person whose opinion really mattered to me was my brother's. Sammy, obviously, didn’t care, in fact when I came out to him when he was twelve, he brought home a whole bunch of books on bisexuality from the local library the next day so that he could understand my “point of view”, or whatever, better. It was really sweet actually.”
After Castiel had taken care of the Rit Zein, Ephrahim, Dean had offered to drive him home. In retrospect, that was probably a bad idea, but it was an idea Dean had stubbornly followed through with. The car trip had led to the very uncomfortable conversation in which Castiel had revealed that he was currently living at the Gas-N-Sip.
Castiel sat up and crossed his legs underneath him as he thought about his answer. Dean noticed that he tugged at the dark strands of his hair and chewed his lower lip as he pondered. Dean raised out of his crouched position and moved onto the bed, so that he was seated in such a way that he was face-to-face with Castiel.
“Well, Gabriel knows this really competent lawyer, Billie Reaper. She’s truly a force to be reckoned with, and she owes him a favor. So, he called it in, and I met with her, and if you still wanted to do it, she would help you with your case. Pro Bono. If you wanted – “Cas swallowed.
it,” Dean grinned as he dropped onto his bed. Cas moved to his bed and dropped down onto it, too. Dean stretched himself out, rested his arm underneath his head, as his gaze settled on the ceiling. He listened to Cas’ breathing for a while, relishing in the comfortable feeling that seemed to envelop the room.
I just wanted to extended my deepest gratitude to Hellbreaker42! Thank you for taking the time to always check my work, for making me laugh with your comments and spending time helping me when you are so busy! I really appreciate it.
The word somehow sat wrong, felt wrong. Home had never been a place to Dean, it had always been people. And for a long time, it had only been Sam. For nearly three decades, the only person who had ever brought him any semblance of joy and a feeling of security had been his brother. All he had ever needed was the car he was in now and the man sitting next to him. And for the longest time he hadn’t even believed that anyone else would be able to break into the fortress he had built around himself. He believed that the scene he was living right now, him and Sam driving in
it here,” Castiel pointed to his head, “but not here,” he said pointing to his heart. He hid his hand away again. “I just want them to
Dean’s jaw tightened, and his hand balled into fists, “Look, it was shit. Okay? I know that, but dwelling on it isn’t gonna help anyone. It isn’t gonna change him, isn’t gonna change what happened. So, what’s the point in talking about it? We survived. That’s what matters.”
The room was ghostly quiet for a full minute after the garage door swinging closed had been heard. Castiel felt cold all over as he dropped his head into his hands. Consequences were hard to face. When your consequence was Dean Winchester, the man you loved with your every cell and atom, it felt almost impossible to face.
“I am both the happiest and most terrified I have ever been in my entire life,” Castiel huffed out his conclusion.
“But I fucked up,” Dean said brokenly, “With you, last night. I was selfish, and I wanted it to just go away. I know that you should take the lead with the physical things. I fucked up.”
Castiel couldn’t imagine what hearing that must have done to Dean, who had spent his life shielding his brother, carrying the brunt of their father’s abuse and neglect, tearing himself in pieces so that his brother didn’t have to.
Dean felt an overwhelming wave of gratitude for Bobby in that moment, nearly drowning with the weight of the emotion.
The one upside of this emotional turmoil is that it had, at least, softened his dick. So, as to not rock the boat, he would need a
“Amara is always with me, she’s a part of me now. I feel what she feels, she sees what I see. It’s symbiosis – not like possession.”
“I’ve put him somewhere outside space and time. A little pocket I carved for him. I healed his vessel and am keeping it safe for when he comes home,” Jacks glances between Sam and Dean, “was that the right thing to do?”
“It looks like it was a bad accident…”  Castiel started, lacing his fingers with Dean’s, both of their hands tangled in his lap. The gesture was so casual and so
After, when his vision broke into a constellation of colors, they lay next to each other, Dean’s head resting on his chest, and his arms holding Dean close. Castiel’s own heartbeat was still loud in his ears and he suddenly realised how undeniably that heartbeat now belonged to Dean. And, so, he thought, in tandem with the hammering of his pulse: yours, yours, yours.
to find that tears were burning in his eyes, threatening to spill, “I’m a fucking, godforsaken train wreck.”
Sam and his long-term girlfriend, Eileen, had finally tied the knot in Dublin. The wedding ceremony was held in the same church where Eileen’s late parents had gotten married. It was very important to her as she never knew them - both of them passed before her first birthday. She had explained to Dean that this somehow made her feel closer to them.
And admittedly, there were times that he was honestly enjoying himself – these times usually happened when a certain blue-eyed character was at the center. Dean and Cas spent quite a lot of time together, but not as much as he would have originally guessed (or admittedly wanted) when he initially found out that they were going to be roommates. Their days were usually spent with the others, in sessions, in activities or just chatting in the
“So,” Dean started, but then got stuck. How on Earth was he supposed to start this, voice these thoughts? He had spent the better part of the past four decades avoiding any situation that would require this of him, literally only ever tapping into this side of him when the world was fucking
He did not smile often anymore. He didn’t find a whole lot of reason for happiness; hadn’t for years. But, hugging his best friend was one of those few moments that shot like a bullet of clarity through the haze that usually encompassed him.
“So nearly two weeks ago?” Castiel asked, trying to ignore the painfully suffocating feeling that constricted his chest as he thought of his parents. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
If by “drew his attention” he really meant "clutched his heart in a vice-like grip and squeezed so hard he almost let out a pained sound", then yeah, it did. At least the pain of the air bubble in his chest suddenly seemed irrelevant.
Cas expected a fight, expected Dean to flip him off playfully and say that they were fine. Dean did not act as had Cas expected. Instead, he walked straight towards him, pulled Cas into another hug and replied, “Yeah man. We really need to talk.”
Before Castiel was able to respond, there came a soft knock at the door. Castiel hastily untangled their fingers. Dean was startled by the suddenness of the movement, and although he felt a little hurt at the gesture, given what he learned about Castiel’s past today, he understood the instinct. He’s been in this situation before, been with someone whose self-preservation instincts caused them to withdraw. That didn't change the fact that Dean’s hand suddenly felt very empty and very cold.
Which, when you were in a self-imposed lockdown in a tiny-ass room, was less than ideal. In between his stoic-faced journeys to the kitchen, he tried to entertain himself. He tried to read, he tried to watch
“Yeah, couldn’t Amara be the new God?” Dean asked, “If she absorbs Chuck’s light that is in Jack right now, she wouldn’t be this destructive force, wouldn’t she? She’d be a balanced force.”
He trained his eyes on the small coffee table, too scared to look at Dean. But to his surprise, Dean just let out a short, but genuine, chuckle. “Yeah, I guess you did. Guess there’s a first time for everything.”
He sighed as he went back to his room to grab some clothes and a clean towel. After, he went to shower and brush his teeth. When he emerged from the steaming bathroom, there was a new plate in the sink and the last of the coffee was missing.
“Well, I don’t know about me. But he knew you loved him. And that’s what this conversation is really about isn’t it?” Sam responded softly. Dean’s head snapped up and he stared at Sam, searching his eyes for judgement but finding none.
It was only at the end of the second session that Dean realized the reason Bobby knew so much, and in such significant detail, was because he had been visiting Sam three times a day for the past eight weeks. Right before Bobby left this past Saturday, Dean had broken down and thanked Bobby for being there for Sam when he couldn’t.
“Dammit” Dean yelled hitting the steering wheel, breaking the silence that had settled around the brothers, “Fucking dammit.” The words tore from Dean’s chest and he hit his head into steering wheel.
The first thing Dean noticed when he opened his eyes again was that it was very bright. He blinked twice as the world came into view. He could barely remember the trip here, but he knew where he was:
“Sorry,” Castiel breathed, after he was able to stop the tears. He tried to pull away from Dean, who held onto him tighter, stopping his retreat.
The next three weeks passed in a very pleasant blur. Castiel had to admit, when he initially signed up for a twelve-week psychiatric stay, he never once considered that the experience would be
Dean had never felt this completely drained, not once in his entire fucking life. He felt hollow – completely scraped empty. He was exhausted, and the longer he walked, the heavier he felt, the louder the buzzing in his head became. Missouri had told him tonight was likely to be difficult, that she would be available if he needed her, he just had to tell Stevie to contact her.
Dean smiled at him as he walked towards Bobby, who pulled him in for a quick hug and a familial pat on the back.
going to be easy. When Sam wakes up, he is going to need you like he’s never needed you before – both physically and emotionally. And you are going to have to be ready. You are going to need tools to look after him and look after yourself. Because caring about people who are hurt is emotionally draining. It’s a traumatic event in and of itself. And you can’t help him if you are letting yourself drown.”
“Come in,” he called. Both Sam and Eileen inhaled sharply when they saw Cas. He really did look like what he was right now - a corpse. But just for now. Just for right now. Soon, he would be back. He would be here, the body below him alive with life, glowing with angelic grace. Dean would ensure it. If it was the last fucking thing he did, he would ensure it.
“No,” he spat out and stormed away, slamming the door to his room closed. The sound rang in Cas’ ears as he placed the creamer and the milk on the countertop. He rummaged in the drawers until he found a cloth. He dropped to his knees and started drying the floor.
Dean catalogued him as he stood in the silent room, save for the wonderful beeping that reminded Dean that his brother’s heart was still beating. His hair was dirtier than he usually let it get, the bald spot was almost completely covered – although there still were some wires stuck in his hairline. Both of his arms were scattered with the deep blue and purple of fresh bruises as well as the yellowing green marks of older ones. His face was thinner, the bones seemingly wanting to protrude from his skin which looked paper thin and somewhat translucent. The last thing he noted was the round, plastic tube leading out of Sam’s nostrils, hooked up to one of the multitudes of unfamiliar machines behind his bed.
“Yeah, well, I was actually going to ask her how to check myself out, but she wouldn’t speak to me unless I saw you.” Dean admitted, bouncing his left leg.
“What do you mean ‘to start’? You’ve been here for six weeks, how are you only ‘starting’ now?” Dean tried to keep his tone as neutral as possible, his gaze never straying from Cas' face.
He walked over to the couch and dropped into the worn leather cushions. He took another couple of sips before grabbing his phone from his back pocket.
“Dean, this is not up for negotiation. Not really. It’s either there or it is in the psychiatric wing of this hospital. This is the best option for you right now. But, given that you are this anxious about…”
The five of them waited outside the school for Sam to meet up with them, and when he did, everyone seemed to be competing to pull him into a hug. After about a minute of this, Dean hugged him close before clapping him twice on the back. “I’m so proud of you, baby brother.”
He needed to get a grip. He needed to calm down. The alternative would result in a spiral, and then he wouldn’t be in the right space to talk to Amara. So Dean did the only thing he could think of that would be able to be the eye in this hurricane.
And then, suddenly, and very briefly, Dean’ eyes dropped from where they were boring into Cas’ eyes, down to his lips. His eyes were back on Cas’ so quickly that if Cas had blinked, he would have missed the abrupt flicker.
“John came home unexpectedly,” Dean explained, “He’d been in my apartment for a couple of days. He got violent, as he usually did, and Sam saw.”
But Dean did not only talk about himself. He also asked questions, and Cas answered every question he was asked.
And although Dean was brilliant, witty and super charming, Castiel had also started to notice that Dean, definitely, no matter what he says, is not okay.
“For what it’s worth,” Dean said, “I am sorry that you didn’t get the love you deserved. I’m sorry that you were hurt by the people who were supposed to keep you safe. You didn’t deserve that.”
But in him staying quiet, had he taken something away from Cas? Because, with a sudden dawning horror, Dean could not remember one person telling Cas they loved him. A sharp electric feeling pushed into Dean’s ribs.
“Yeah, you slept for most of it. I mean excluding our conversations and other activities,” Cas said, leaning over to grab the coffee mug and shove it into Dean’s hands.
“Cas, please, not now. I can’t and I need… I need you to leave, okay? I need you to leave right now.”
“What is going on with Dean, is he alright?” he heard Jack ask Sam and Eileen. Dean was in his room with the door closed behind him before he could hear either of their responses to the question.
In their visit yesterday, they had discussed it at length. Gabriel, who had been living with Meg all this time, suggested the three of them look for an apartment together, a place that they could make their own. Castiel was surprised when Meg had agreed wholeheartedly. And when he questioned as to why she would be okay with living with Gabriel in the long term, she said that she had gotten used to the “overgrown toddler” and that living with him meant that the snack cupboard was always very well-stocked.  Castiel was decidedly excited about this new phase of life that he was headed into, and he felt stronger and more equipped to deal with this whole “actually
Dean felt like he was trying to navigate through an earthquake. The floor seemed to vibrate and twist below him as he walked beside Castiel to their room. Castiel had not said anything, and Dean did not want to be the first one to break the silence, did not think it was his place to do so. Castiel looked exhausted and he seemed quite dazed. His eyes were distant and he was clearly stuck somewhere between reality and wherever his thoughts were drifting off to.
“Hospital?” The panic Castiel felt solidified into dread, settling itself as a heavy weight in his stomach.
Dean nodded as Cas left the room and continued nodding at the closed door for a couple of seconds before his brain caught up with him.
Castiel suddenly felt sorry for the new admittee. He remembered how extremely anxious he had felt at that time, how being observed so clinically and fully had made him feel so small.
Dean put his arm around Cas’ shoulder as they walked towards Baby. Dean had to smother his smile in Cas’ arm when Sam copied him, his long arm dangling from Eileen’s shoulders.
“There’s a lot I’m endlessly curious about,” Cas said, his voice sounding rougher than usual, “But I am enjoying learning from my observations and experiences.”
“No, they’re not. They’re the people whose genes you carry. That doesn’t make them your parents. That’s a title that’s earned, not given. And they’ve let you down. You don’t owe them anything, Cas. You’ve spent years trying to make them happy, and it nearly killed you. So fuck that and fuck them. You have to do what’s right for you. A wise man once told me family don’t end in blood, but it doesn’t start there either. Family cares about you, not what you can do for them. Family’s there through the good, bad, all of it. They got your back even when it hurts. That’s family.”
“Yes, they never had any angels to test on. But it seems to reason that the effects would be similar as the Empty has a claim on both angels and demons after they die,” Eileen replied, sitting down on the couch that had been Dean’s bed for the past couple of days.
Castiel nodded as his hands moved higher until they snuck under Dean’s shirt, and he slowly started mapping out the contours of Dean’s stomach. Dean was on fire. He rushed to place another kiss to Castiel’s mouth – rushed to lick the seam of the pale lips he had fantasized about for so long. When Cas opened up to him, he thought he would pass out as all of the blood rushed out of his head.
“I do not know why you are here, though, Castiel,” Amara said, not unkindly, as she eyed him quizzically.
“Jesus, Dean! Fuck,” he heard Sam from somewhere behind him. But his vision was so dark now he could barely see his hand in front him.
Dean hadn’t gone far. He was on his knees at the end of the passage, his elbows planted on his thighs, his fists digging into his eyes while he rocked forwards and backwards erratically.
But avoidance was difficult when Cas’ trench coat was staring at him from the coat rack that was just a few feet away.
you. We came so close to losing each other and I just… I need you. I need you to stay with me and if you go off into the Empty without giving a fuck about getting back…” Sam exhaled and ran a hand over his face before pinching the bridge of his nose, “I can’t do this without my brother”.
He started a pot of coffee and opened the fridge to check if all the groceries he had pre-ordered were there. Dean saw that their items were placed on separate shelves in the fridge, their names written on the unpacked paper bags.
“It’s dinner time, you guys are late and it’s taco night. If you aren’t there in five minutes, I’m eating both of your shares.”
it… the thought of being stuck in this life is unbearable. It’s insufferable. Everything feels like a fight. And I am tired, I am so fucking down-to-my-very-bones exhausted. But…”
The first visit was very emotional. Bobby had threatened to strangle him if he ever did something so stupid in a car again. Or in life. Dean had never seen Bobby cry, but he definitely saw tears in his eyes right before he hugged him that first afternoon.
“Yes, you are. I have seen you stand so still I have literally confused you for a statue, but you have not stopped moving since you got in here,”
“Yo, grandpas”. The sound burst through the closed door before it was followed by three loud knocks. Castiel’s eyes snapped open, and he took a deep breath in as reality crashed into him violently. When the room came into focus, he could see that Dean was facing the same battle with coming to grips with consciousness.
He gripped Dean’s shoulder tightly, as he lowered his mouth, leaving a trail of slow, open mouthed kisses down his chest and his stomach. Dean made that breathy sound again when Castiel’s fingers dipped just below the waistband of his jeans. That was Castiel’s sound, the one he had made Dean make. The rush from hearing it was enchanting, and feeling Dean writhe below him was euphoric.
That thought was quickly doused, however, after looking at Castiel’s face for a few minutes. The expression Castiel gave made him realize that maybe he wasn’t as good at explanations as he thought.
Other nights, it would be slow and drawn out, and Cas would take his time slowly taking Dean apart, working him open, making him beg...They would have small traditions: having hot chocolate on the porch on the night of winter’s first snow, family movie nights on the first Sunday of every month.
“Dean,” Cas breathed. It was the first time he had spoken since Amara started talking. “It is, of course, your choice, but I think Amara is right.”
Dean nodded and stared into the eyes he never really stopped seeing. And then, Dean found himself leaning forward, his lips a breath away from Castiel’s.
Just because he couldn’t be with Dean right now, didn’t mean he couldn’t write down all the things he wished he could say. It didn’t mean he couldn’t tell Dean all the things he wanted to, every day.
“I need to chat to Charlie before we leave, and I think she needs to meet Gabriel, as well. And, you are going to keep us company on the walk to the nurse’s station.”
“After what I did to you, I didn’t know if you would’ve cared if I came back. I didn’t know if you even wanted to be around me” he said honestly, and the admission sat between the two of them, something heavy and painful.
“Dean you’re having a panic attack,” he heard from far away. He tried to make sense of the words, but they seemed to bounce off him.
Dean licked his lips, and Castiel’s eyes darted to follow the movement before they jumped guiltily back to Dean’s eyes.
It was the closest they had come to addressing the separation, but when Castiel looked into the green eyes of the man who had reminded him what it was like to really be alive, he also knew that not all conversations need to be had out loud.
but other times you just shouted about the accident, about how you weren’t supposed to wake up, things like that. So, that is when I was brought in.”
As always, all my thanks and gratitude to Hellbreaker42 for the beta work he did for this fic. It is so appreaicted.
There had only been one new patient admitted, Ava Wilson, although there was talk (mostly fueled by Claire’s snooping) about another three that would be joining within the next two months. Castiel was next in line to be released. One week from tomorrow he would be getting into a car with Meg and driving away from these buildings that had housed him for three months.
Dean was exceptionally proud of Sam, deeply and truly excited for him, but every time he thought of his little brother leaving for Paolo Alto, his heart clenched painfully. It was taking all of his willpower to not pack up all his shit and follow Sam to California. With Cas in tow, obviously.
“Did you ever tell Cas you love him?” Dean asked, avoiding eye contact with Sam. Sam was silent for a minute before letting out a very long breath.
The walk back to his room was rather stressful. He really wanted Dean to be there. He really wanted to put his arms around him, comfort him, make him feel safe the way Dean had done for him so many times. But the closer the wooden door came, the more he was convinced that he had been wrong to think Dean would go to the room, that he would continue playing this game of hide-and-seek.
Dean was out of his bed and banging on Sam’s door before the thought could lodge into the part of his brain that constantly relived all the ways he had failed those he cared about.
As Dean had expected, Billie was standing outside the ‘dungeon’. Her fist colliding with the warded door, the reason for the deafening sound playing through the Bunker.
Dean’s vision was swimming, and as he thumbed through the pages, he saw almost every page had writing on it.
“Thank you,” Dean said and he meant it with every fiber of his being. Cas placed a soft, quick kiss to his lips before drawing back, but he settled one of Dean’s hands between both of his own.
As if on cue, Dean walked through the front doors, and, as they usually did, Castiel’s eyes jumped to him, following his movement through the throng of people. He was obviously looking for Amara. When he glanced over to Castiel, he flashed him a shit-eating-grin and a wink before disappearing behind a set of doors.
“Cas, I fucked up. I let him down. Cas… Cas, I didn’t know…” the fact that the words were muffled against Castiel’s shirt did nothing to hide the naked grief carved into those words.
“But… “ he had continued reluctantly, “after seeing what it did to Meg... I don’t want to put her through that again.”
, if they weren’t the most beautiful eyes he had ever seen. The dark green eyes, alive with curiosity and something that he couldn’t quite place, framed by dark eyelashes that seemed like they could not exist naturally. Castiel blinked slowly, and the rest of the stranger’s face came into view. A constellation of freckles and on creamy skin, short caramel hair that framed cheekbones that Castiel was sure poets could write sonnets about.
Castiel turned to look at him. Dean was staring at the ceiling, his cheeks dusted with a light blush that was barely visible in the dark room. He was using that voice he used when he really wanted something but wanted to seem like he didn’t.
Dean jumped up from the bed and ran to the bathroom. He turned the cold water tap on and started splashing his face and neck, trying to calm his erratic breathing. He ignored the ache between his legs as he continually scrubbed over his face with the cold water.
icon. He only managed to look at the photos once this time before another external force acted upon him.
In his mind’s eye, he saw Cas on his knees, Cas straddling him, Cas running his fingers through Dean’s hair. He remembered how he chewed on his pens when he was anxious, how he’d helped Sam with his college admission essays, how he always kissed Dean twice before leaving for a lecture.
That word had poured over him like iced water, stopping him before he did something stupid like drop to his knees and tell him how beautiful he still was. Seeing him had ripped open a cut he long believed to be scabbed over and Cas’ words were salt. It was a very confusing, very intense, yet very short interaction.
“No, you will stay here for another forty-eight hours so we can just monitor your lungs, burns and those pesky cracked ribs.”
with it. Dean was spiraling, falling apart, literally ripping his own sanity to shreds while Cas was just standing there, all impassive and detached. Dean didn’t affect him in the same way.
Cas nodded, “Yes. For so long, I thought there was this malevolent God watching over us, wearing the mask of benevolence as he planned each of our stories, tested our faith, set us on what was supposed to be a virtuous journey, although fraught with unpassable tests… And I just don’t anymore. The longer I’m away, the more I learn… It’s like now I realize that there is no righteous path; it’s just people trying to do their best in a world where it is far too easy to do your worst.”
“The tattoo? What does it mean?” Cas was not lifting his finger and was not giving Dean the ability to think rationally.
“You can take a swing if it will make you feel better, if you want to hurt me,” Cas said as neutrally as he could, but he heard the way his words shook.
Standing in front of him, his face fixed in a mask of horror and disbelief, was none other than Castiel Novak.
“Good. Secondly, I just facilitated the cast you personally put around your own mind. I just made sure you didn’t go sawing it off before the bone was strengthened underneath.”
Castiel, who hadn’t even realized how much he cared for them, felt a painful tug when their respective forms had disappeared. But this was the type of pain he could deal with; it was bittersweet.
“Before I found the bar, I was just driving around in Baby, thinking about how I could possibly make this up to you. But, it’s not like I could ask you to come back yet. Even if I wanted to. And, I do want to Cas. More than anything. But, I can’t yet. So, yeah, driving didn’t help,” Dean babbled. “At some point during the drive, I pulled the car off the road. There was this lookout point.”
and letting himself fall down the online stalker rabbit hole. It was the inevitable outcome. Dean had known this from the second his eyes first glimpsed the image.
“Well, I’ve been thinking about it, but haven’t done a lot of research,” Sam said, “Getting Cas back was priority number one.”
“That is a brilliant plan, Dean,” Cas said, a smile pulling at the corner of his lip.  He had never thought that he would get to have this again. To experience the complete bliss of having Dean and having his son back.
Cas had only seen Sam awake a handful of times, and mostly during those times, Sam tried to convince Dean to pray to him as he was, “obviously, an
Dean shrugged and exhaled shakily. He hadn’t told anyone that, not since Cassie. He didn’t know why he shared this with Castiel now. His hand was still in Castiel’s, and he shifted his weight a bit as he tried to get more comfortable without breaking the contact. He winced sharply as the movement shot pain up his sides.
Castiel noted the way she said Stevie’s name seemed different to the way she usually speaks; it seemed, somehow, gentler. He still found it strange that he was able to pick up on things like this now.
Castiel closed his eyes, as if the words hurt him. He began to move, as if he was about to get up, and Dean felt panic rising in him. The idea of distance between the two of them making it hard for him to breathe.
I needed to stop bleeding first. And I needed time to regain my strength before going into surgery to set the bone right. So, it's like I came here, screaming about my leg, and only focusing on the blood. And once that was handled, I could actually look at the other reasons I couldn't use my leg yet. Does that make sense? I feel like I’m not making sense.”
“No, don’t,” Castiel pleaded. He could not bear to think of another person feeling any sort of guilt because of him.
And then the angel and the hunter crashed into each other. At the first moment Dean’s lips touched Cas’ lips, a supernova of colors erupted behind his eyes. He lifted his hands from the couch, and cradled Cas’ face with one hand and buried the other in the hair curling at the nape of Cas' neck. This. This is what he’d been hoping for. Been yearning for even when he hadn’t know it. And it was so much better than he could have ever imagined. Cas tasted like both rain and sunshine. His lips fit with Dean’s; his hands fit in the space above his waist.
Thank you so much to everyone who has read, left kudos or commented on this story.  This is the first fic I have ever written and I would not have been able to do it without all the interaction from you guys.
Castiel nodded encouragingly, as he gently pulled Dean from where he was all but crumpled on the floor. Dean followed his guidance. He directed Dean onto his own bed and took a seat next to him. He gingerly brushed some hair from Dean’s forehead. “You said so earlier.”
Sam lifted his shaking arm to touch gingerly at his head, wincing as his fingers met their mark. Whether this was instinctual or because the wound still hurt, Dean didn’t know.
“You’re the shiny wheels. We are the shiny wheels. Us. What we had...have,” Dean replied, thinking that he was excellent at giving very clear explanations of a nuanced language to fallen angels. He should write a book.
It made him feel safe enough that he could even talk to Cas, if somewhat cryptically and with great effort from Cas’ side, to decipher the words that just didn’t seem to want to leave the safety of Dean’s mind. He was the only person Dean could talk to about Sam, about how much he missed him, about how much he hated the fact that although he could write letters to him, Amara wouldn’t let Dean receive anything from the outside. Dean had nearly pitched a fit when Amara clarified this during their first “visitation”. He fucking despised that he couldn’t talk to Sam. He missed the damn miscreant so much, it felt like he was suffocating. And when the anxiety about this separation felt like it would drown him, Cas just held his hand or put his arms around Dean, and it was an anchor. It kept Dean tethered when it felt like he was being dragged under. Cas did that even when Dean couldn’t vocalize why he was suffering. When the hole in his chest and the black shutter in his brain became overwhelming, became painful - Cas was always there, and Dean always felt safe.
Dean was standing with his eyes glazed over, his face tight, a muscle in his jaw twitching erratically.
Dean stopped. He looked at Castiel again for a second, his eyes unendingly sad before dropping his head.
“It’s not for calming down, it’s for getting me in the right mindset,” she said smiling earnestly, “so I was listening to
But seeing as he was being punished, he had, of course, awoken with the most intense case of morning wood he’s had in – fuck –
and a questionable motel.  And the catch was that, if you were traveling alone, you would be forced to share the space with a stranger.
“Yes, he does. He is going to stay. He’s going to get well-acquainted with my couch,” Meg said quickly, standing up.
“Why would Sam trigger my memory if he wasn’t there?” Dean countered, his chest feeling unnaturally tight.
“I was just concerned that you may have changed your mind. That you may regret anything from last night,” Cas finished.
Dean plastered on a smile as he turned to the slightly disheveled looking man who twitched nervously as he stood in the doorway.
that takes a look at how conversion therapy gained traction, the damage it does and what forms it still exists in today. It is absolutely brilliant and important (but heavy, so please check CW) and I would recommend it to anyone.
Dean grabbed the pillow from underneath his head and shoved it over his face, under the blanket, and groaned into it. He’d left Cas to deal with the mess he made after he stalked off (or more accurately,
Dean. He got increasingly anxious, his heart slamming in his chest and his blood pounding in his ears, as he watched Stevie dial. He wanted to get back to Dean. He wanted Stevie to get back to Dean.
He was at least self-aware enough to realize that this was unhealthy and childish. He was also self-aware enough to realize he didn’t care. Not when it came to Cas.
Stevie had offered him a mild sedative, prescribed by Missouri, but he refused it. He didn’t want to be groggy when he spoke to Amara, and given that it was already light out, he was scared that it wouldn’t fully be out of his system by eleven.
Claire grumbled while the rest of the patients started filtering in. Conversation erupted as everyone hurried over to introduce themselves to Dean and then began discussing their respective days.
“No,” Cas shook his head, “Just twice. The rest of the time we slept in lodges. The accommodation was great actually.”
“Usually, people put their sheets and comforters on before they go to bed,” Gabriel scolded playfully.
Dean nodded; he could respect that. He would, however, struggle with not making jokes. This whole process was the most uncomfortable thing he had ever experienced (okay, potentially not as uncomfortable as his first time with Benny, but that was a vastly different experience to the one he was facing now) and joking about what he was going through had always been a way to lessen the intensity of what he was experiencing. It was as if the humor turned his emotions into shades of grey instead of full color.
After he’d used the asthma pump earlier, Dean had stared at him until his breathing returned to normal. His eyes had been hard, calculating but very incessant. Cas felt trapped under that verdant stare.
“Right,” Sam said, as he clapped his hands together and closed his eyes: “Jack, we really need to talk to you buddy. I know you were just here, but it would be great if you could come by. We won’t keep you long.”
“What are you going to do now, your first night as a free man and all that?” Gabriel asked after he drained the last of his drink.
“Usually, people don’t spend twelve weeks in a psych ward and then have their first full day of life,” Castiel countered.
By the time the four of them were back in the bunker, Dean felt as if he had just run a marathon. Which, he may as well have. His arm, where Cas was, was burning hot.  Sam was back next to Eileen, their arms around each other.
Castiel popped up his arm and leaned against it as he looked up at Dean, “Do you do that a lot? Push things down?”
Sam nodded, eyes drawn, “I was, but that means that I couldn’t think about it at first. Not logically. But in the years that passed, after I processed what happened to Jess, and I got out of the selfish –“
“It’s not silly. This is – Jesus, Cas, this is the most romantic thing anyone has ever done for me.” Dean was breathing unevenly as he repeatedly traced the gold lettering on the front cover. “I love it so much.”
It was a lovely evening, and Castiel was sure that Dean was almost completely back to his normal self.
“Fuck it, I’ll just run in screaming his name until he hears me,” Dean says downing a fifth of whiskey.
Dean looked awful, his eyes a glowing red, angry scarlet lines on his forearms where his nails must have scratched out his frustration. The numbness and anger were thoroughly erased, completely replaced with a haunted, broken look that somehow invaded his entire being.
When the final turn came up, Dean thought the ringing in his ears would deafen him. He pulled into a slightly overgrown meadow. He looked and saw that the flowers were almost glowing in the dusk light, the windmill in the distance creaking softly as the gentle breeze turned it. When he opened the door, he could hear the melodic sound of running water in the distance. He walked to the trunk and pulled out the basket he had placed there the night before.
Dean looked dubious, but at Castiel’s incessant stare, he bowed his head in acceptance. Castiel knew Dean didn’t believe him, but he also knew that, for now, this was the best he could hope for.
“You are mine Dean. In every sense of the word. And I am yours. You belong to me and I have always, always belonged to you.” Cas said between kisses and sinful licks down his chest and occasionally using his teeth.
It hurt Castiel deeply to think Meg still blamed herself, that Meg had taken on that burden and refused to share it.
He heard the bathroom door open and close. And once he was sure he was alone, Dean sank to the kitchen floor and buried his head into his shaking arms.
If it hadn’t been for his weekly visits and occasional phone calls with Bobby and Cas, he was sure he would have just stormed out the front doors days ago. Making a decision and sticking to it when his old anxieties came knocking was far more difficult than Dean had anticipated.
But finally, a couple of days ago, all the pieces came together, and in a beautiful ceremony, one that Dean
“She needs to give him his schedule, and he has his first session with Missouri today,” Jodi explained as she handed Castiel the coffee. Dean saw Castiel smile his thanks from his periphery.
She told a story of a young girl in a small town who lived what she called “quite an average life”. She spoke about how she now knows that she has struggled with depression her whole life, but when she was younger, she didn’t understand what was happening to her. Did not have a name for what she was going through.
it felt. Balthazar turned out to be a great guy; he hugged Cas comfortingly while telling him it was alright if his heart was still broken. They became friends that night and have remained friends ever since. They never tried taking it further again; they both knew they weren’t meant for each other. Not in that way.
“You can really do what you want. I don’t care. I would have liked some warning, maybe, before we did…” Dean couldn’t get himself to say the words. He abruptly stopped walking and dug the heels of his hands into his eyes.
Thirdly, I joined tumblr! I have absolutely no idea how to use it, but if anyone wants to come say hi that would be great! I don't have a lot of Heller friends in real life, so it would be great to chat to you! You can find me as AngelWithoutAShotgun there as well.
He knew he was being stupid, but he wasn’t ready for the instant replay of the worst night of his life that was sure to greet him when he unlocked his front door.
“Fair enough,” Dean conceded, “So, what vibe are we going for? Full debrief and discussion or do you want me to play ‘
He glowered at the pink stain on his hand and waited until the burn abated some before closing the tap.
Okay, Dean could help. He could do this. He’s been in many emergency situations. He ignored the shaking in his hands and let his training kick in as he slung his arm under Cas’ shoulder and helped him up from the ground.
“It was about a year after the adoption papers were officially signed that Alex’s past came back into our lives,” Jody was saying, her voice strained and heavy with emotion, “This was about three months ago. We had finally settled into a comfortable routine, you know? We were a family. She even called me her ‘mom’ once to her friends when she thought I couldn’t hear her,” Jody chuckled.
He grabbed Dean’s hands between his own, and tried not to take it personally when Dean flinched away. “Dean, I’m going to go get Stevie. Please wait here or go wait in the room. She will call Amara. Please, just, wait here, please don’t do something before she gets here.”
“I think if you don’t,” Dean whispered, the rough tinge of his voice becoming more prominent, “I might die.” The words fell like a confession from his lips.
“What I mean is,” Sam leaned back, clearly choosing his words carefully, “Nothing about how you guys ended sat right with me, Dean. The more I thought about it, the less it made sense. The reasons he gave you just – I don’t know. The thing is, you were so obviously everything to him. The way you guys were together, the way he looked at you –" Sam shrugged. “It just didn’t make any sense.”
facility, rather - nurses got antsy. So, to avoid any unnecessary attention or lectures from Charlie, at twenty past five, he readied himself to go to the cafeteria.
Cas whirled on Dean; eyes huge. He grabbed Dean’s face between his hands, “last night was unbelievable. It was everything I have ever wanted, more than I ever believed I had the right to experience.”
She shook her head but then took a deep breath in and nodded. She looked slightly green as she glanced down at her pages again.
Next week, we will returning to a little more angst from Cas' POV. And, don't worry, Dean's time to deal with his shit is coming very soon.
But it was enough. That fleeting look snapped the tightness inside Cas, and before he could think about it, he surged forward. He crashed his lips onto Dean’s forcefully, his hands on either side of his face. Dean’s mouth dropped open. Cas didn’t mistake the gesture for anything but confusion and shock, but Cas still pulled Dean in closer, breathing into his mouth. And Dean stayed motionless for another second before aggressively pulling himself away, completely out of Cas’ reach.
“There is, actually,” Amara said. This fact eased the guilt that was curling around his lungs. She reached into her bag and pulled out a long silver rectangular box.
He had barely been able to sleep the night before, a deeply unsettling mixture of jet-lag and well -
“I wanted to stop it. I didn’t want to say those things to you. I never want to say things like that to you. It just happens… I couldn’t stop it.” Dean went rigid in Castiel’s arms.
“Fuck, of course. I can start right now,” Dean eyed the recorder, trying to figure out how to get it to start working.
. He would not be able to stumble his way through the phrase that usually fell so easily from his lips. The words that would never be true again unless there was an angel in a trench coat in his eyesight. So, he didn’t say anything. He just drove.
him had created a deep and raw desire within himself to connect to others, but with no knowledge of how to do so. He had no idea how to get from point A to point B. Sometimes, however, with Jody or Claire, he thought he might be able to reach out across that divide, and find a
“No,” Castiel interrupted, “You did everything right. Scout’s honor. And, uhm, thank you, Dean. Thank you for listening and thank you for caring.”
“That’s a common question for people who spend a long time away from a coherent cognitive state. But yes, in particular, I wanted to find out how far back your memories had hidden themselves.”
“You think… he.. with like me or whatever?” Dean asked cringing slightly. Cas’ confession was one thing. But having further proof of Cas' feelings, of his inability to notice….
“You know what I mean,” Castiel said softly. Dropping his eyes as he continued eating the chocolate bar he had previously abandoned.
The idea of only being friends sent a sharp, agonizing pain straight through Cas’ heart, but he would take what he could get. He knew that. He just wanted back into Dean’s life in any role that he would allow him. He hadn’t even known how desperately he wanted this until he was forced to confront his feelings for Dean.
Cas was dizzy with desire; his entire body felt like it was electrified. He shoved Dean’s underwear and jeans out of the way so that he could close his right hand on his cock. Dean hissed and pulled his mouth away the second Cas’ hand wrapped around him. He closed his eyes and dropped his head back onto the wall, his hands digging painfully into Cas’ biceps. Good. He wanted bruises. He wanted to remember this.
Jack cocked his head to the side, and Dean smiled at the gesture. The kid really reminded him of Cas.
“I didn’t know what else to do or what I could say, because there’s a lot I can’t tell you, yet. Can’t, Cas, not won’t, okay? You have to trust that I wouldn’t do this if these weren’t monumental stakes.” His voice soothed, dropping into a whisper.
Thank you so much to all of you who have read, commented and left kudos. I really appreciate it and I am so grateful that you have spent your valuable time reading this :).
Castiel sighed as he took hold of the door handle. He would, however, “seek” if he had to. For as long as it took.
Dean remembered how Cas liked to mark him up, leaving a smattering of purple bruises in the wake of his beautifully sinful mouth. He remembered how tight Cas had held onto him the first time they slept together, how there was a distinctive hand-shaped bruise on his right shoulder for
And Dean stared at them, smiling sometimes and crying at others. But one photo never left his hand. A photo of Cas in a cowboy hat, staring at the camera with a slight flush of embarrassment. It had been the first case they worked since Cas got out of the Empty the last time. Dean had been so unbelievably happy at having Cas back, he insisted on taking photos of the angel. He joked it off at the time, telling Cas that they needed more photos of him for fake IDs. But it hadn’t been that. It had been the fact that they had sat together in
Dean’s smile faded a little before a different, falser smile was suddenly plastered on his face, “It’s gotta be better than
want to think about it. He isn’t even sure he wants to remember. And since Amara assured him that Sam was okay, he doesn’t feel guilty about not wanting to know.
“Fuck no. Are you kidding me? Go to one of the other apartments. There are like ten in this building.”
When the credits started rolling, Dean seemed more keyed up than before they started, whereas everyone else looked around lazily, sleep just in grasp for almost all of them. They all bid each other a good evening, and Castiel and Dean walked hand-in-hand back to their room. Dean seemed to be vibrating with energy.
“I’ve been having a hard time adjusting,” Dean offered weakly as a means of explanation to his current inebriated state. Dean had placed his forehead next to his hand on the wall and closed his eyes, trying to restore his fleeting equilibrium. He wasn’t reliving Castiel’s bewildered and indignant expression at the sight of Dean when he first  arrived at the Gas-N-Sip. Not at all. He was completely over it. As in
But if this, a superficial conversation and a table-length distance between them, was all he could get, Cas would take it, take it happily, take it gratefully.
Oh, God…What if the social worker showed up and Dean wasn’t there? Dean tasted bile, his throat constricted as nausea rolled in his stomach.
“I – uh, I have a call with Sam soon. So, I should, you know shower and stuff,” Dean spluttered out eventually, when the tension in the room became so thick Dean felt like he would choke on it.
Castiel wrapped his arms around her as she clung to him, her arms tight around his neck. Castiel pressed a kiss to the side of her head as the two broke apart.
So today, he was determined to get Dean to talk to him. If he had to push, shove or full-on bang on his door for an hour straight, Dean was going to talk to him.
“Jesus Christ. You did what?” Dean’s airways constricted and the blood drained from his face. His reaction seemed to knock Cas out of whatever stupor he had been in. He resumed the gentle movements on Dean’s back, taking a deep exaggerated breath to remind Dean to do the same.
“No need to rush, Dean,” Amara smiled gently. “I am going to be spending most of the day here. I need to catch up with Charlie, Missouri and Pamela anyway. I would also like to check in on Ava, see how she’s adjusting. Just get it to me before dinner, and I will take it straight to the hospital.”
He led Dean to the  food station line as he replied, “I’m Castiel Novak. I’m a Gemini. I like reading and watching bees. And…”
But, Meg consistently came back, week after week, and with each visit from her, the visits with the monster in his head lessened in both frequency and severity. And he was pleasantly surprised to find that, although he felt a little hollow after they were gone, the warm glow of their company remained and that he looked forward to their visit next week instead of wallowing in their absence.
Castiel leaned forward to gently kiss Dean. It wasn’t anything more than a momentary press of lips on lips. But it was intimate, a connection, a promise to stay and a promise to be there for him to hold onto.
Cas couldn’t read the expression on Dean’s face. Dean looked at him for a few seconds longer before clearing his throat, “Why don’t you come keep me company while I cook, and you can tell me all about it?”
“Sam calls it a fetish,” Dean dropped onto Castiel’s bed, star fishing so that he took up all of the space on the comforter as he stretched out. “I call it an adequate appreciation.”
That he was sorry? That he missed him? That his life had seemed a lot less worth living without him near?
“No. I didn’t. I did not do this on purpose. I did not try to upset you. I was trying to be civil and discuss your brother,” Cas tried to even out his breathing, tried to sound calm and neutral even though it felt like every muscle in his body was vibrating.
They decided to play a game after everyone had cleaned up and made coffee.Claire chose first, and she chose
“So I just grabbed the steering wheel. I didn’t really have a plan. I wasn’t thinking. I just wanted him scared. I wanted him to feel how I felt.”
“That’s what you meant by syphoning,” Sam said, and Dean could see the puzzle pieces falling into place. Dean’s heart went into overdrive. This could actually work.
Dean and Cas were already seated in the war room when Eileen and Sam walked in. Dean smiled at the two of them as they took their own seats. Dean thought, as he stared at the three members of his family, that he could get used to this. Could get used to the idea of a home full of people.
But they didn’t talk about that which was glaring at them-- about their lives when they were together, what happened that night and what’s happened since. They also stayed clear of the topic of any other exes or current partners.
Dean checked the time as he put his phone on the white, nondescript bathroom sink. Okay, so six twenty-five was a pretty shitty time to make this much noise in an apartment with paper thin walls. But firstly,  he didn’t actually care if he annoyed Cas, because fuck him, and secondly, he would be unable to start his day until he dealt with the problem Cas, although not actively (but whatever), created.
“I don’t know how he got his body back last time,” Jack says, annoyance clear in his demeanor, “but vessels can’t pass into the Empty. It’s only the life force that passes through. So, his vessel was there, on the outskirts.”
“A friend of mine, Benny. Just after high school, we had a bit of a friends with benefits thing going on for a while. But he grew up in a very, uh, traditional home. He sometimes struggled with it, so we never progressed further than that, but I realized that it worked better when he initiated the contact.”
“If you ever do, though, Dean, we are here. All of us,” Jody spoke for the group. The others murmured their agreement.
Although Dean had a wonderful start to the day, he definitely was not having a wonderful time right now. He stared at the clock next to Missouri’s door as he fidgeted on the yellow couch. He has had three individual sessions with her, and, so, today marked his fourth. They had already discussed far more than Dean ever thought he would ever be forced to confront, let alone analyze. He left her office, on Mondays and Fridays, feeling like his skin was flambéed. They had talked about his savior complex (which he didn’t have), his self-esteem issues (which he definitely didn’t fucking have), and Missouri had, in their last session, warned him that they would be discussing his relationship with John today.
“Wait, does that mean I have left the resident wordsmith, the linguist of the mental ward, speechless?” Dean asked, his cockiness flooding over the momentary vulnerable moment. Castiel rolled his eyes and just continued running his hand through Dean’s hair.
He says things that leave Dean reeling but, more than anything, makes him want to cradle the words to his chest, hold them gently, as if by keeping them secure, he could make them true. Like right now, when Cas is so unabashedly studying Dean, confessing how the world was more vivid with him in it. And Dean suddenly understood with certainty that, even though he never realized it, he had been waiting his whole life for someone to look at him in exactly the way Cas was now.
“When Amara comes,” Dean whispered unevenly, “will you be there with me? No pressure of course, I just, there’s no one else, and I don’t really want to deal with this alone.”
But Dean didn’t hear any of this. The buzzing in his head returned tenfold, and he could barely hear himself thinking.
“And so, the dead finally rises,” Sam called jokingly as he spooned the bacon from the large skillet he was holding.
about Cas’ resolve because he didn’t even come out for breakfast. This was unusual; Dean was the kind of person who woke up hungry. His first thoughts upon re-entering consciousness had always been about breakfast.
“Yes, you did. It was not really a conscious decision. You just did not want to live without your brother, and you wanted your father to face the consequences of his actions. It was a knee-jerk reaction in very emotionally charged circumstances. Most of the times you were semi-cognizant, you weren’t making any sense, and you just kept repeating the word ‘
The words had barely settled between them before Dean surged forward again, kissing him deep and hungry and perfect.
This response was so unexpected, Cas couldn’t help but let out a soft huff of laughter. Cas had tried to cook for Dean on three separate occasions while they were together. All three of those times had ended with a smoke alarm blaring deafeningly while Dean and Cas clamored to get all the windows open.
“I couldn’t stop it. I couldn’t stop him. I didn’t even know to look for him. I didn’t know he would... I didn’t know.”
saw very few new patients (in fact, no new patient has been admitted since Castiel arrived here six weeks ago), Castiel did not find it exciting in the slightest. He found it terrifying. He struggled with change and struggled even more with new people. The fact that this place focused on long-term inpatient care with no more than eight patients at a time, had been one of the main reasons he agreed to come when Meg shoved the pamphlets in his hands that night seven weeks ago: limited people and limited changes.
He was still wearing the green jacket. When Dean thought about looking at Cas's bloody handprint on his shoulder the nausea came again.
Sam Winchester read all the messages on Eileen's cell that afternoon. From the first they exchanged until the last, and as he advanced the dates of the messages exchanged approaching the last, the lump in his throat suffocated him. He finally got out of bed and decided to go after his brother, who knows, maybe a conversation.
Sam hadn't slept well in days.  Since Chuck started to surround  them, the hunter no longer knew what a good night's sleep was.  Sam and Eileen had been talking for days about her spending a few days in the bunker until everything was definitely settled.  Eileen didn't think it was a good idea. She had already left the bunker once and didn't want to go back again, not under those conditions.  But she understood that things were worse now and tended to end in disgrace in every way possible.
He doesn't find his brother, he doesn't look right, he feels too exhausted and the bunker looks giant to anyone who's been chained to as many feelings as he is. It's tiring. Once again in the kitchen. The kitchen works as a place of comfort, it is where they keep their drinks, where they smiled so often. The moments of happiness were so rare. Something was always going on. Always someone to save, always a problem to solve. But it was there at that table where they ate on normal days, when Sam made the coffee too weak and Dean always complained. It was where Cas always refused the beer that Dean offered and yet Dean insisted on bringing him one, and he always drank after refusing it. It was there that Sam and Dean found Jack again after he recovered his soul, it was there that Jack crying asked for forgiveness and it was there that he was forgiven.
Sam had a pain stuck in his chest. Latent and restless, hidden behind the scream and glued to the cry. Waiting for something that makes sense so that it can show itself and flow through the rest of your body.
"Do you think we're going to make it?" he heard Castiel's voice so clear he was even startled. The memory was so vivid that Dean thought he was delirious.
The metal chair creaked when Dean sat, if the floor wasn't concrete it would have sunk under the weight of the empty Dean was carrying inside. The sky was clear; shy blue and oranges painted the immensity, nothing that compared to that Tuesday's sky. But it made sense, Dean thought. There was no reason for a spectacle of nature that no one could see, and if he hadn't climbed onto the roof that afternoon, no one would have ever watched the sun saying goodbye on that horrible Saturday. Chuck should be resting, isn't that what God did on the seventh day? If he rested on the first seventh day, he is likely to follow that habit, that devotion to the seventh day through the millennia. Dean wished that nothing existed, that he did not exist, that Chuck did not exist. He wished with his eyes closed as the last rays of sunlight reflected on the freckles on his face, that everything would be different.
Sam was in the room searching Eileen's cell phone, he hadn't been able to drop the phone since he found it on the floor in front of the huntress's house. He would never forgive himself for being too late.
i don't know what to say right know, i hope you can listen. I hope more then everything for you to listen. I can't stop thinking about you, about what you said to me. You didn't get me the chance to say it back. H- how c- could… how could you?
Sam wincherter walked through the bunker that evening. He opened the door to Jack's room and found the boy asleep. Sam continued walking in the deepest silence, the silence of the world was his and now he carried it.
Nothing has ever hurt so much in castiel as loving Dean.  He knew, he always knew.  The moment he got his hands on Dean in hell he was lost, that was his downfall.  But falling didn't hurt, falling in love with Dean didn't hurt.  What hurt was to love him in secret.  Cas wanted to love Dean in bold letters.  He wanted to fill the bunker with flowers or with those bad beers that Dean likes.  He wanted to take him to fly and watch the stars up close.  He wanted to cook a thousand cherry pies just to see him smile and at the end of the day lie down next to Dean and love him as he deserved to be loved.  But knowing that he could never want to glimpse the mere possibility of that life, killed him.
Dean was leaning against the refrigerator remembering that night, the 4th of November, he was so lost, so deep in those memories that he didn't notice when Jack entered the kitchen.  The boy raised his right hand to greet Dean.  Jack was dejected, with dark circles around his eyes looking back from a night's sleep that didn't exist.
"Dean!"  he spoke almost breathlessly, his voice deep as usual but failing.  He cleared his throat again
The three were silent for a long time.  Sam leaning against the counter looking away and Cas and Dean sitting facing each other.  While Dean stared at his hands holding the cup of coffee extremely distracted and absorbed in thought,  Castiel looked at him with concern and an unbridled dose of sadness that ripped him apart every time he looked at Dean.  So beautiful sitting there, so distracted and stupid, so worried and yet so beautiful.
He took the cork out of the bottle and took a sip. Creamy. Silky. Vibrant. Dean winchester's eyes spilled as he swallowed the smoothness of that wine. He didn't bother, he let his eyes become a bowl and silently took another sip. This time the flavor changed, there was salt in the middle, the salt of tears, the salt of loneliness, the salt of emptiness. He prayed once again.
"Something stronger looks like it would be welcome," Sam replied as he reached into his pocket to touch his cell phone.
Two days passed and all Sam felt was a great numbness that extended throughout his body. He hadn't cried yet. I hadn't eaten or wanted to drink water. The tightness in his throat almost preventing him from breathing was what made him know he was still alive.
To say the minutes Dean spent sitting there watching Castiel closely, following the movement of his slow, controlled breathing would be impossible.  For Dean, it was like that moment was a little piece of eternity.  He could stay there for days and days and never tire.  How he loved looking at Castiel, silently and discreetly, but he almost never managed to do that without looking weird.  No, that someone was around.
Castiel had his eyes closed lying on the bed with his arms crossed under his head.  He didn't wear the suit and trenchocoat.  Dean had filled a box with clothes some time ago and left it there for him to use on quiet days and movie nights, the ones when they all got together in the deancave, Sam, Eileen, Jack, Dean and Cas.  Or even just the two of them.  Something that happened very often.  That night, for the last time Cas wore a brown AcDc shirt, sweatpants and socks.
"Sure-" he turns around and goes to the kitchen. As he gets their orders ready Lisa comes by, asking him why he's so upset. "Leave me alone, you ruined my life-" he walks passed her, his shoulder brushing roughly against hers on his way out. "Here you go." Dean says somberly to what he is assuming is two guys on a date. "Enjoy." he turns around when Castiel calls his name. "Yea?" he faces them again, looking utterly broken.
Dean nods, "I understand-"  but all of a sudden he feels angry and opens his mouth to say something stupid-
Dean takes the bucket of feed into the house once it's nearly empty and sets it down it gently by the door. "Why do you even have chickens?" and he's actually curious about it because his uncle hasn't killed one yet to eat it, or not that he knows of anyway.
I hate purgatory, the only way I made it through was because of Cas. Benny too. I didn't get a chance to feel sorry for the fact that Benny was killed, I had to worry about Cas first. To be honest, when I woke up- I thought Cas was dead. I prayed to him, I said I was sorry. I said I was sorry to make myself feel better, thinking that he would hear me. I couldn't live with the guilt, and I'm sure glad I don't have to. He was alive and when I saw
The dreaded question is asked and Dean hesitates to answer. He goes with, "Not at the moment-" instead.
When Castiel dropped Dean off at the house, his heart broke. He has been wanting to come back but he didn't know how. Does he just go in? he has a key but it just doesn't feel like home lately. All he and Dean do is argue and with the way that kid is, he'll start throwing punches. His reputation of being the school bully has gone around the town a few times- Dean Winchester charms the girls and fights the boys.
, in a friggin' church?!" he bursts out laughing and that brings Castiel's spirits down, eventually he notices so he shuts up. "Sure Cas- I'll do it if it means that much to you."
Dean swallows, "Can you just go? I'm tired." Castiel nods and leans in again for that goodnight kiss, Dean gags again. "Ew go away." he pushes him back.
"Ughhhh-" Dean's legs wraps around the mans neck now, keeping him there. "Ughhh-Daddy-" suddenly Castiel stops sucking him and he's positioning himself to fuck him once more. "Oh fuck-" he groans. "Again?"
After all, wasn't this just supposed to be about protection? This man wanted to protect him and take care of him, that's it, so why was the man falling in love with him. Was it a game? To scare him away because he wasn't doing his job as a his bitch? Maybe Castiel was trying to freak him out by saying I love you so that he'd run away, young boys get a bad reputation for running away when things get complicated.
Castiel says while making his way down the ladder, "Hows it looking?" eyes squinting upwards to admire what he's done to the porch. The yellow lights were now hung up and twinkling prettily in the looming darkness of the night.
"Doesn't he ever take care of you when you're sick?" Castiel asks, setting a bowl of steaming hot soup in front of him. Dean was smart enough to let it cool down first, he'd been pretty self sufficient- or as self sufficient as an eleven year old can be.
"No and I'm not going to-" he says through gritted teeth. "She'd think he was abusing me- call the cops- that whole thing." Dean plays with the straw of his drink mindlessly.
He's rinsing his mouth with water when Castiel steps in- "How are you doing?" his voice is soft and caring. He needs that.
Dean's eyes tear up against his will, before anger takes over and he shoves his full plate away and it accidentally falls off the table. But he doesn't care and gets up, rushing away from the cafeteria before he's grabbed by the guard that was always stationed at the door. "Inmate!" he yells, holding him in a bear hug. "Calm down!"
"Meet me in the bathroom-" he whispers before downing the rest of his beer and making his way to the men's room.
Dean watched, he was getting hard in his boxers. "Higher?" he asked, unsure. Castiel's expert hands moved higher, reaching his thighs and he let out a moan.
The teen crosses his arms at his chest and follows him around with the all too famous bitch face, "Are you sure you didn't?" the man turns around and simply gives him a goodbye kiss. "I hate you-" the words sound so defeated coming from him right then.
Meg sighs, "I knew he was gonna do it again." Castiel nods, worrying his bottom lip between his teeth. "You gotta leave him-"
The conversation left him pensive, he'd love it if they moved here. Plenty of open space, lots of fresh air. It's quiet, he likes quiet. But- Sam and Jack. He'd miss them, he hasn't seen Sam in a while- but they will always be tight. Jack's a new friend- who he wants to hang out with more often. Friends or
Dean's lips part but no sound slips out of him, because they both know that Bobby is inside the home not to far away. The man behind him man handles his body into a doggy style position. Again, he looks over his shoulder to see what's happening behind him. Castiel places one knee on the bed and looks to be contemplating something, looks like he decided against it because he steps back to pull his pants back up.
Castiel is pissed but he shakes the guys hand anyway. After a while he says, "I'll be in the car-" it didn't seem like their conversation was going to end anytime soon. Plus, his feet hurt from standing on them all day long at the hospital. When the mechanic finally joins him in the car he says, "Why are you lying, telling him that we're friends-"
"Good boy-" he looks away because he doesn't like keeping his eyes on his pretty son too long, people might think the wrong thing about him.
"Yea-" he sits up again, anger builds up in his body but he keeps it under control because he doesn't want to scare her. "-he told me. We had a fight and the truth just came out." he wipes his nose with the tissue in his hand.
"You still love me, right?" Dean says quietly after a few minutes. Castiel nods. "Then how could you leave me-" instantly he regrets it when he hears his step dad groan in annoyance, "-sorry." he adds.
"I'll bring you come candy, it's closed- we never touched it." Jack smiles sadly because he would love to have his friend join him on their traditional Easter egg hunt. "Do you like chocolate?"
"Baby-" Castiel's eyes begin to water now because it feels like Dean's trying to break up with him. "-are you breaking up with me?" he has to ask.
"Dean." Benny is the only cop that sets foot in the house, he smiles at them both. "You know this kid?" he looks outside the door and there's his ex friend Brady. He's leaning against the cop car, bloodier than Dean left him. The maniac probably hurt himself or smeared blood all over himself to make the situation worse. "He went down to the station, said you tried to kill him. That true?"
"He's working-" Dean says softly when he enters the kitchen, this would be the first time they actually speak in weeks. "We have cereal if you want-"
Castiel was one of the more handsome guys here in the prison, at least Dean thinks so. The man was always well groomed and put together, he often wondered what Castiel looked like before prison- what kind of clothes he wore, what kind of shoes- wondered about a lot of things. Was he the type to take his wife and daughter out for a fun time, or was he the kind of dad that liked to sit down at home in front of the television with a beer like his father.
Even though he'll be an adult in a few short months, the fact that he still might not have the freedom to do whatever the hell he wants haunts him since there's two over protective men ruling his life.
Dean blushes, "Yea-" before serving himself some pasta. "Wasn't expecting this-" Castiel pours him a little bit of wine into his glass. "I'm not eighteen-"
Castiel is kicked out of bed, "Dean!" He gets up from the floor. Hes pissed. "What's the matter with you?" He turns the light on again.
The ladies are chatting among themselves and walking around the home like it's a damn hotel lobby while Castiel prepares the refreshments. Dean doesn't like it at all, every damn chick in here reeks of repressed sexual tension. Not to mention their heels clicking and clacking with every step they take. He came here thinking he'd become the center of attention, but he's not.
Dean walks into class, late again and everyone stares at him- regardless if he fits in or not. He's coming to realize that maybe he's just a freak because he's dressed just like the rest of the other boys in the room and he's still getting weird looks. He's wearing a brown polo shirt, khaki pants and his signature boots. He's thinking maybe that's why he's getting looks, the other guys were wearing dress shoes or loafers and the girls were wearing flats.
Dean always fell short. Dean never could have a future...Could he? He felt a jab at his heart every single time Sam came home from school with his perfect score report card, and his had red marks all over it.
"What did he tell you?" Castiel gets defensive and she doesn't answer. "For two hundred an hour, I think I have a right to know what he talks about in here-"
"Thanks." Dean holds onto the shopping bag that contained his phone, he'd figure how to install games on it later. Castiel's guiding him into several stores, they aren't buying much, mostly browsing as a way to kill the afternoon. "Can we go in here?" he asks, looking into a store -
Dean hands the book to the older man for him to begin reading aloud, and snuggles next to him with his warm coffee and sweet snacks. Occasionally the teen looks up to the man as he reads softly, only loud enough for them to hear and feels grateful to have someone looking out for him in here. Honestly, this strange man is doing more for him that anyone has ever done.
Bobby nods in understanding because he remembers all too well what it's like to be a teenager, "Then hangout with one of yer friends, go do somethin'-"
It's Saturday - Castiel's weekends usually began on Thursday but lately he's been working every day. When the table is set with the breakfast he just made he goes in search for him.
The man falls back onto the bed with a sleepy grunt, ordering him to shut off the light already. The teen obeys quickly before crawling back into bed, underneath the covers and snuggles into his stepfathers chest, smiling when a heavy arm wraps around him protectively.
“ Open. “ Dean rasped right before his intense orgasm hit him. Harder than he’d like to admit. It had been a long while since he had come. Alone or during sex.
Dean nods before tossing the keys onto the table. "I get it, you want me to have a normal life or whatever-" he sniffles, wiping under his nose with the sleeve of his jacket. "I love him and I don't know-" his eyes are filled with tears. "He's a part of me, and I can't-"
Bobby almost feels terrible about this situation, but it doesn't make it right. "Ya gotta let em' go-" the teens arms are wrapped around him, his face pressing into his belly. "Let em' go-"
"I'm tired of guys playing with me." Castiel cried silently as he pulled up his jeans and zipped them up. "Are you doing this because I'm gay?"
"I'm giving it to Bobby." Dean rinses his hair, he whines in pain when he starts lathering up his body.
"I sort of am." Castiel looks at him, "I don't care if she keeps our secret. What I care about is you being a good friend to her so go fix it." Dean nods and watches his step dad go inside. He's just glad Castiel hadn't noticed that he was high again after he promised he wouldn't do it anymore.
It's unclear how long he'd been calling out for his father but eventually it startles Castiel awake who then rushes over to the bedroom. "Dean-" he flips the light on to see the boy in bed with wide eyes, "What's going on?" but the boy doesn't respond, only shows him his hand from afar. "What's on-" it hits him, "Oh-" so he sits down on the edge of the bed with a sigh.
"I wanted you to know that I loved you-that I love you, I'll always remember you Cas...I'm going to miss you so bad. I wish things were different-"
John grabs the batman cup and uses it to rinse his sons clean hair, "You think I like gettin' calls from school tellin' me to give you a bath?" he huffs angrily as he squirts more bubble bath onto his hands so he can wash his sons body next- and he does it just as roughly, his nails basically scratching every inch of his skin to get it clean once again.
The excitement quickly faded after cruising aimlessly around town for almost two hours. It was clear that John Winchester had forgotten about their family outing and had nothing planned for the day. But of course, in his defense this little family date was only talked about once and it had been over a week since either one of them had brought it up.
Dean steals the box of chocolates because they were for him anyway and indulges in a few of them with a sad far away look in his eyes. The question he's asked about their upcoming trip goes unanswered, eventually what was said is forgotten about and they have a wonderful and very romantic evening.
“Of course it does. Why would I create perfect heaven for all humans but especially for my dads, if I’m being honest and not give two of them away they can communicate?” Jack said as it was the most obvious thing in the world.
“So you’re telling me,” Jack gulped listening to his tone “that you’re God and you still make time to visit me cause you miss me.”
He didn’t even tell him his answer yet.“Dean, you know that he... he’s busy.” Jack said awkwardly, God or not, he was still his kid. And Dean knew when his kid was lying.
Everyone but him. Oh, and Jack too. But Jack did visit sometimes, saying that being God sometimes tired him out, like that would be possible even.
