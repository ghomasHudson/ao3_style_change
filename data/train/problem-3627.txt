“Dean, please look at me.” Cas waits for Dean to meet his gaze, then steps closer and settles his hand at the base of Dean’s neck. He asks softly, “Is this what you are hiding from?”
“I'm trying to, but it keeps moving,” Cas responded and pushed the buttons on the controller with more force. “This masked child is thoroughly inept. I don't understand why The Batman would require his assistance in battle.”
At some point while Dean was going down on him, Cas had managed to get his dress shirt unbuttoned, which now hangs open exposing a glorious expanse of tanned skin. He only has a moment to enjoy the view before the angel is tugging at his shirt and Dean is reminded that he’s far too overdressed for the turn of events. Dean lets out a hiss when Cas presses firmly over the growing erection trapped in his jeans and they quickly undress between biting kisses.
“I’m no longer an angel,” Cas says gravely when he appears behind the taller Winchester. He’s still in his sleep clothes and blinks tiredly at each of them. His gaze lingers on Sam, tracing over his drenched form, down to the small puddle at his feet before turning back to Dean – eyeing his cup enviously – and asking the most pressing question, “Why is there no coffee?”
, I love it when you talk dirty.”
Cas was joking anyway. He pulled him closer so their naked skin pressed into each other and their cocks slid together. Cas rolled his hips so they rubbed again and repeated the movement when it elicited a low moan from the hunter.

Dean felt the warmth in his cheeks and turned his head away from his friend. “No, I just want him to be happy.”
,” Dean mumbled. “And how the hell does she know about it anyway?” As far as he knew, Chuck's writing ended with the apocalypse and that stuff was never even been published.
know?" Dean asked, breathlessly. "I haven't exactly been subtle."
As the thing moved to attack the new comer, it was distracted by a loud high-pitched beeping and it turned to face the source of the noise. It didn't have time to react as a forklift sped towards it.
“I'm still not sure what we did there,” he added.
Dean didn't want to risk saying something that might change the angel's mind so he kept his mouth shut and shifted back behind the wheel. When the engine turned over and Dean drove them out of the bunker's garage, Cas leaned down and unbuttoned his jeans, carefully sliding the zipper down over his bulge. Dean's cock was straining against the thin fabric of the panties and the head poked out of the top, swollen purple and slick with precome.
.” Seriously, the guy could remember "Castiel", but not Dean? He was feeling an overwhelming desire to punch 'RuRu' in his stupid face. That would teach him not to start groping a guy right in front of his boyfriend... Wait.
inside of Dean's velvety heat.
“Yes, of course. Apologies,” Cas said and thanked Miguel again.
Cas swallows and nods. “I’m sorry,” he says quietly on his way out of the room.
Still, Sam was glad Dean seemed far more concerned about the missing Impala than the possibility of having just had a night of kinky gay sex with his best friend.
Cas stared at the message confused.
? We really gotta catch you up on the classics - and not that nerdy shit Sam and Charlie make you watch. But seriously, Cas, what's in the box?”
"Of course."
He’s on his way to the shower room when he comes to an abrupt stop. Cas is leaving Sam’s room -
night. We don't need to resort to petty theft to get by.”
When Cas is confident that Dean has everything he could possibly need within reach, he comes to kneel beside the bed. "Dean, I know this is difficult for you, but please rest and get well."
"I prefer being inside you," Cas answered matter-of-factly, as if simply stating the weather. He quickly rubbed more oil on himself then lined up with Dean's entrance and pushed in slowly.
“We'll need to get more of this soon.”
Castiel kicked off his shoes and Dean quickly followed suit.
“Uh, yeah,” he says. “Not gonna lie, I was pretty pissed.”
Cas nods. “I’m happy to be of use.”
"Guys," he called out as he looked around, relieved when there was no humping to be seen.
“Why?”
“Nah, I can handle it.” He lifted his hips and lightly jabbed Cas under the chin with the tip of his cock, urging him to continue. “C'mon, babe,” he added, hoping to garner the same positive response to the pet name as he did the night before. He looked down to find Cas staring at him through long lashes, his lips wet with saliva and precome and curled upwards in an adorning smile. “You like when I call you that?”
Cas took a sip and grimaced. "That's disgusting. I believe it's gone bad."
Dean wants to point out that it wasn't worth staying at all but he hasn't had coffee yet and not in the mood for his brother’s bitching. "So, how was the sightseeing in
. He sighed frustrated and wished Sam wasn't in the room so he could watch the video again. He wanted to see a version of himself, high or not, that was actually happy and didn't give a shit about labels and what other people thought. He wanted to see Castiel just as content and carefree in a way he'd never seen the angel before. But, he mostly wanted to see the way Cas looked at him with those inhuman cerulean eyes, like he was worthy of the angel's worship, devotion, and love.

Cas' whole body tensed.
Cas smiled at Sam referring to him as his best friend.
thing surprisingly well, considering. It's not like he was given much choice in the matter, but humanity did come with a few worthwhile "perks" as Dean liked to call them. His favorite of which was getting to enjoy food for the first time. He's found he is especially partial to pretty much anything with cheese, grease, or sugar. Dean, naturally, approves of his unhealthy choices and often indulges him; whereas Sam always chides,
The shorter man showed no reaction to Dean's attention and continued to ignore him in favor of slowly and methodically washing the last few dishes. At that point, Dean was convinced Cas was intentionally taking his time.
"Uh-huh," Sam replied skeptically, taking a few steps in to the room and crossed his arms over his chest. "Dean, you're in here alone, sitting in a giant leather chair with your fingers steepled ridiculously and a stupid smirk on your face."
“Not really,” Kevin responded. “It mostly involves constant migraines and everyone trying to kill me.”
“Does it feel good?” Dean asked.
“Regarding?”
He’s immersed in a tome on Aphrodite and love magic – with surprisingly erotic details – and doesn’t hear Cas enter the library until he’s standing at the table and reading the ridiculous title of one of the New Agey books Dean has already gone through.
“How far do you wanna take this?” Dean had to ask. He knew they were moving too fast, and given Castiel's (still maybe? he should probably ask) virginal status, he didn't want to push him. Also, Dean had no idea how this worked with another dude. Apparently, he had thought of that last night when they decided to go watch a gay porn for “educational purposes”, but since he couldn't remember anything it was still mostly guess work. He thought they could probably just grind together like they had been, but he really didn't want to shoot in his pants. Especially considering the rest of his clothes were in the other room.
“You’re an idiot,” Sam tells him before following Cas out of the room.
Well, it all made sense now, Dean thought. What had happened with Cas that evening, and really, what always happened with Cas, seemed so natural for them (barring his oddly timed arousal) that he didn't think twice about it. He certainly never considered how other people might misinterpret their relationship as anything more than what it was. Although, it did explain why all of heaven and hell seemed to be under the impression they were gay for each other and often made snide comments about it.
It hurts, but he gets it. He had plenty of time to think last night while he was wallowing in self-pity and regret.
Cas leaned down to remove the hunter's boots then slowly worked open his belt and jeans before sliding them off. Dean shuddered feeling the cool air on his cock, which was barely being contained within the panties. Cas' eyes traveled over his exposed body and lingered on his crotch.
“You meant it though.” Cas stood, pulling away from Dean's touch. “There's no need to apologize. You're right, Dean. I'm a- I believe the apt term is 'fuck up',” he ended, using air quotes.
“The only thing I plan to do for the foreseeable future is
“Why didn't you wake us up then?” Dean asked irritated. Now he was going to have to rush through his shower and other morning routines and didn't even have time for coffee first.
The video started on the close-up of Cas' boner tenting the dark blue fabric of his boxers.

“Jesus, what other way is there?” He threw his head back and glared at the ceiling in an attempt to hide his embarrassment.
and failed when he tried to snatch the remote away. Cas accused him of being “insubordinate” and changed the speed setting to high. Dean didn't try to take it again, or argue when Cas put the radio station on classical.
"C'mon, Cas," Dean sighed opening is own door and stepping out.
Dean hoped that if kept as much distance from Cas as he could - which wasn't easy considering they lived and hunted together - his brain (and body) would remember that he wasn't gay, especially for his best friend. What better place to reaffirm a man's heterosexuality than at a club full of naked women?
“I contacted a rescue in Des Moines,” Sam continues, “but they couldn’t take them until Monday, which is why we needed to stay the weekend in Iowa. They told us how to care for them until then, so we got what we needed and took them back to the motel.”
Dean held his phone with the text message between the computer and his brother's face. Sam read it quickly and his head snapped up, looking somewhat guilty.
No, Dean didn't want to think about that stuff, but his mind could conceive nothing else.
When he rounds the corner near the bedrooms, he hears a creak as Sam’s door is opened, flooding light into the dimly lit hall and his brother’s voice saying, “-- back or he’ll get suspicious.”
. “Where the hell'd you get lube?”
Cas alternated between sucking and biting and using his fingers to trace over Dean's skin. While continuing his ministrations with one hand, he resumed his work with the vibrator, probing around until he found the little gland and pressed into it.
“Okay. What club did you go to?” Sam asked.
"You ever had a blowjob, Cas?" Dean asked, fairly sure the answer was “no”. Then again, Cas did have that weird thing with Meg a while back and who knows what that demon bitch did to him when they were alone at the psych ward. Suddenly, Dean wasn't so sure he wanted to know the answer.
Cas moves from his mouth to lick down the angle of his jaw, nipping at and sucking over his pulse point before moving lower. Dean’s eyes close and he shivers as the other man’s stubble scraps over the newly bruised skin, heightening the pleasure. He thrusts into Cas’ fist, urging him to pump faster and the grip around him tightens – too dry and a
Dean could feel the ex-angel smirking against his skin when his hand finally slipped down and wrapped around him. Dean groaned loudly and rocked into Cas' tight fist, chasing his release. Cas pounded harder, the slick slide of his cock prodding the little bundle of nerves and Dean couldn't hold back. With a groan he spilled out over Cas' hand, shooting hot white streams over the tile floor. Cas stroked him through the aftershocks of his orgasm and pushed into him a few more times, burying himself deep inside the hunter as he came with a stuttered gasp before collapsing on top of Dean.
“Y’know, part of the excitement comes from slowly undressing your partner,” Dean informed, amused with the ex-angel’s eagerness.
Dean grabbed Cas by the arm and pulled him over to the car door, pushing him in the backseat before he could protest. Kevin reluctantly climbed in after him and Dean took his place in front. Sam wasted no time speeding away from the bar (and crime scene) and headed for the bunker.
Dean turned his head to look at Cas, whose face was much closer than he anticipated. Their noses brushed and their mouths were so close he felt Cas' hot breath on his lips. Dean froze for a moment, his eyes wide before he panicked and jumped back, hitting his elbow on the wood-paneled wall. "Ow, shit! Jesus, Cas,
, Dean,” Cas stuttered out. He angled to push against the sweet spot again and kept the position so could hit it with every thrust.
bothered to show up and help.
a black plastic bag from the top drawer.
“Dean, look at me.”
"Hat?" Dean managed to squeak out as the pace quickened and the sound of grunts and slapping skin increased.
"Dean, get Cas out of here," Sam ordered. "Look guys," he said turning to face the other two angry men. "We're all a little drunk and we're not trying to start trouble." He released the man he was holding as a gesture of good faith just as Dean was pulling Cas though the restroom door.
, so you can go on without me.”
he breathed out.
"Y-yes," Cas stuttered nervously and couldn't stop himself from rubbing his own swelling erection against the hunter's. Both men gasped when their clothed cocks made contact and Dean's arm tightened around him. "I wasn't sure you wanted-"
“So, wait,” Sam starts, “is that why you’ve been acting like a bigger jerk than normal?” Sam, the bastard, laughs. “You’re wrong, Dean. You are incredibly stupid.”
“Really?”
Sam groans. "Just ignore him, Cas. It's the meds kicking in and making him loopy."
As everyone turned their attention back to their plates, Dean risked another look at his partner (they were avoiding the term "boyfriend" because Dean didn't like the sound of it). Unlike the others, Cas wasn't eating, but rather staring back at him with a sly grin. The brunet discreetly reached into the pocket of his pants and retrieved a small remote control, holding it up just above the edge of the table so only his hunter could see.
“There's also something written in ink on the back,” Cas added. “Rainbow Cabaret? There's a street address.”
Oh. He didn't think it was possible to feel more aroused than he already did, but the realization of what Dean was saying hit him with a flood of excitement. "You, uh--" his mind ran through a dozen half-remembered scenarios featuring bright green eyes, and even a few explicit clips from the pornography he'd taken to occasionally watching on his phone. Unfortunately, he knew they were both too tired to do much of what the men in those videos did with one another. Not to mention the lack of sufficient lubrication required for such activities. He wasn't completely clueless, after all. "Kiss my chest."
Cas rocked his hips against Dean, sliding his erection between the cleft of the hunter's ass and pushing the cotton fabric of his boxers into his crack. Dean pressed back to give his partner more contact and Cas thanked him by twisting his hand and swiping his thumb over the slit of Dean's weeping cock. Dean groaned, already feeling the pressure building as his partner's strong hand worked him towards a quick release. He reached behind him and grabbed Cas' hip, pulling their writhing bodies even closer.
“What about the two of you?” Dean snaps back. “It’s not like either of you gave a shit about hurting me when you started sleeping together.”
“Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it,” Kevin yelled in excitement.
Cas gives the younger Winchester a look Dean can’t decipher and turns back to him. “I was hoping we could continue our ‘binge watch’ tonight, but if you need time for yourself, by all means, don’t let us stop you.”
“They’re cute,” Dean says, watching as the tiny animal begins to stir under Cas’ ministrations. “Sam filled me in on everything.”
When Cas finally decides to stop pretending to be distracted by his drenched clothing, he turns to face the hunter and waits expectantly for him to start yelling again. Dean
"Fuckin' finally," Dean groaned, relishing the intrusion and resisting the urge to push back on Cas' dick, despite the burn.
"Son of a bitch!"
a low groan and it pulled Sam's attention to his brother and the ex-angel. Dean was flushed, staring open mouthed at Castiel who had his eyes closed and was sucking down his own finger. It made Sam (not for the first time since Castiel moved into the bunker and started sleeping with his brother) want to stab himself in the face.
Dean shook his head. “Why do I feel like this whole damn thing has been a conspiracy to get me to open up about my feelings?”
was utterly intoxicating and he thought he could probably orgasm just from kissing him. That theory was almost proven seconds later when Dean's own tongue joined the party and he languidly rolled their hips together. Cas' groan was swallowed by the hunter, who seemed amused by his reaction, and Cas could feel him grinning before he abruptly broke the kiss.
Dean snorts, casually leaning back in his chair and props his feet on the table. “Relax, Sammy. Have some joe,” he responds and pretends to drink from his regretfully empty mug.
After putting on his shirt, Cas threw the sheet off and swung his legs over the bed to slowly pull on his boxers and pants. Cas already had his jeans halfway up before Dean realized he hadn't looked away and watched the entire time as his friend did a reverse strip tease. When he glanced up to make sure Cas hadn't noticed anything, Dean's eyes locked onto two curious blue ones. Cas was definitely aware he had been watched and he didn't seem to mind.
"I don't know who that is," Cas admitted. "Your costume came with what seem to be fury antlers and a red glowing ball to wear on your face for some reason. I assumed you would know."
Cas stood at the sink humming softly to himself and swaying his hips as he washed the dishes from dinner. Dean watched him for a moment before abandoning his task of putting away the leftovers - because his stupid lazy bitch of a brother decided he was too good to help or something - and wrapped his arms around Cas' waist.
"Yes, Dean," Cas answered firmly. "I'm extremely aroused and currently stimulating your erect penis with my hand," he gently squeezed Dean's dick for emphasis. "The only thing I am unsure of is why you are not touching me. Are
“Hey, I didn't-”
Dean instinctively jumped between Cas and the man who was twice his size. "Hold up, dude. My friend's drunk off his ass, just ignore 'im."
“I wasn't trying to be.”
"Let's go," Dean said to Cas and started to walk towards the door.
"Is it the plaid shirts?" Kevin asked, only half joking.
“Y'know, I'll probably need a tetanus shot,” Dean mumbled into his pillow. “Hope your precious water was worth it.”
“You think?” Sam asked.
. His
Sam responded with a grimace and thumbs up.
Dean’s always preferred action to words anyway.
"Come on, Dean," Cas said, slipping off the lab coat and letting it fall to the floor. "Suddenly a shower sounds
Maybe someday Dean will figure out how to actually be happy that his baby brother and best friend were able to find something good in one another. But for now, he has no choice but to suck it up and accept it.
“Psh! Years,” Sam responds. “Are you guys together now?”
Dean grunted his disapproval and lifted his hips, seeking any sort of friction.
“No, I also wanted to apologize for the way I've been acting lately.” He took a step closer to the other man. “I shouldn't have pushed you away, but I had to figure things out.”
He let out and exasperated sigh. Dean just wasn't taking his plight seriously.
Cas threw his head back and let out a moan of his own feeling Dean tighten around him. He shifted his weight, getting closer to the man
crap can't hold up to all this." He flexed his muscled arms and smirked.
“Get the fuck out of my car!”
The color drained from the ex-angel's face and his eye went round. “Wh- why are you asking me this?”
"This seems a bit one sided, man."
“Really?” Sam sounds hopeful but skeptical.
“Right,” Dean said, glancing sideways at his brother, who was gripping Cas' arm as the ex-angel helped the taller man to his feet. “Even if I believed you, which I don't, why else would you spike us with roofies if you weren't planning to roll us?”
“You’re a real asshole.” She steps back out of the car, slamming the door shut –
After Suzy left to give the orders to the kitchen, Sam could no longer hold in his laughter. Frankly, he wasn't sure how he managed to suppress it so long. "Oh man, Dean, you're such a moron."

“Considering you were sneaking around and lying to me for days?” Dean asks.
“Lemme smite 'em,” Cas yelled and attempted to kick the man.
"Sounds like your little bitch-boy don't need you to protect him," the man sneered.
“Did you?” Cas' gravelly voice replied with a false innocence that wouldn't fool anyone who had actually met the former angel. Dean could hear him turning the tap to adjust the water temperature. “Apologies, I must not have heard. You know my hearing is not what it used to be.”
"Ugh! Do you mind?" Kevin wrinkled his nose. "We're trying to eat here."
the bathroom to take your clothes off, Cas.”
important I didn't think twice about handing my keys over to a couple of strippers I'd just meet?”
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean moaned. He held onto the former angel's waist and rolled his hips upwards. Cas gripped the back of Dean's head, running his finger through his hair and mashed their lips together. He sped up the pace to match Dean's thrusting and worked his tongue into the hunter's mouth. Cas lifted up, pulled almost all the way off then slammed back down. Dean grunted obscenities and met Cas' hard thrusts with his own.
to go see what his friend was doing. He heard Sam apologize to the girl and they kept talking in hushed voices.
"You think I'd kick you outta bed over a poorly executed kiss?"
“We don't know what happened. What can you tell us?”
“Why would you?”
going to need to watch some videos soon.
“That's helpful.”
“I'm embracing humanity,” Castiel answered, his gravelly tone sending blood straight to Dean's dick.
Dean let out a satisfied groan and leaned in to crush their mouths together. They stayed like that for several minutes, kissing, and caressing, but just as Cas' dick was starting to stir again, Dean pulled away and flopped down on the bed next to him.
“Fair enough,” Dean nodded. “To address the second issue: I didn't want you to leave the room. I actually like bunking with you more than Sam these days. You don't stink up the place with rancid farts and you don't snore like a freakin' moose in heat. And if you really wanted to 'ease my discomfort' then you wouldn't have made your little masturbation confession.”
Cas throbbed with anticipation. Every press of Dean's lips and swipe of his skilled tongue left the former warrior of God a writhing mess. He wondered if he should hold back, but Dean seemed to be enjoying his reactions, so he couldn't find it in himself to feel ashamed. Dean took his time, teasing and sucking at the skin around his groin and between his thighs. When Dean turned his head slightly and rubbed his stubbled cheek against his neglected cock, Cas let out a string of curses in multiple languages that surprised even him. "Dammit, Dean! Stop messing around."
not freakin'
“I didn't mean it like that. It's just somethin' guys say to chicks,” he argued and shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “Look, just because I'm not all PDA with you doesn't mean I'm gonna go and hit on someone else. Jesus, Cas, I wouldn't do that to you.”
“That's it,” Dean offered with a small shrug.
For half a second nothing happened until the blood started to rush back to the areas causing painful tingles. “Sonuvabitch, we are never using those again.”
“How was that?” Dean asked with a smug smile.
“'Cause I know a thing or two about this stuff and things like unhealthy coping mechanisms.” Cas' head tilt gave away his confusion so Dean decided to be blunt. “Keep in mind that I'm not complaining, but what's with the sex toy fetish, Cas?”
Dean's grin widened. Who knew Cas was such a flirt? “I'm gonna need you on the bed for
Dean hummed when Cas dipped his hand under the elastic waistband and took hold of his cock, pumping him to full hardness. He lazily began to thrust his hips into the former angel's fist, seeking more friction and Cas tightened his grip and moved with more vigor.
The next morning Dean woke to someone knocking on his bedroom door.
“Why do you say that, Cas?” Sam asked, still trying to look anywhere other than the scene before him and not sure he really wanted an answer. He was caught between wanting to laugh and wanting to evaporate out of existence.
The three men stepped out and scanned the building. There were several other vehicles in the parking lot and the place seemed fairly busy for a Saturday afternoon. Then again, it was Tampa. Walking up to the main entrance, Cas tapped Dean on the shoulder to get his attention and pointed to a sign that was advertising the 'XXX Theater' posted near the door.
"You taste like cranberries," Dean commented after they broke apart and slid off the table to stand. He noticed Cas' erection had deflated slightly so he pulled him close and began to stoke him. "So how do you want me," he asked eagerly when Cas' dick was back at full attention and ready to go.
Dean's cock swung aching and neglected between his legs, demanding to be touched. "
“Who wouldn't?” she asked rhetorically and playfully hit the hunter's arm. “But it doesn't have to be one or the other, or either for that matter. Sexuality can be a fluid, fickle bitch of a thing.”
Cas chuckled softly along with Dean as Sam and Kevin sat confused, but amused at imaging the once angel of the Lord drunkenly smack talking a redneck.
Without slowing, Cas pulled back and surged in again, aiming for the spot and reducing the hunter to a mewling mess. He gripped the back of Dean's thighs and lifted his ass higher, increasing his speed.
“Okay.” Sam cleared his throat. “Well, you should, uh...put on some clothes. Cas too. Then we'll figure it out.”
and pants. Cas pulled back before Dean could free his erection from the confines of its denim cage.
“Don't be silly,” she responded, already tapping away on the phone's touch screen. “A conspiracy implies that there was ill intent involved. Now, I'm going to do my thing while you go get that angel and repent your sins. Don't worry, I'll be out of here before you get back.”
Sam had been waiting by the diner door to give them privacy, so when he saw Cas climbing in the backseat and Dean going to the front he headed towards the car and hoped for a tension free ride back home.
“Is there a problem, Dean?” Cas asked casually.
“Again, we didn't steal anything,” the redhead said. “You were too busy to take us home so you gave us the keys and said to bring the car back today. We went to the hotel this afternoon, but you'd already left so we brought it here.”
“He injured his foot,” Cas informed, taking a sip of his coffee.
"Yeah, thanks Cas. I guess," Sam replied exasperated. "I'm going to see if Kevin needs help with translations or something."
About the time his eyes landed on the boots a loud growling noise echoed down the hall. Sam headed in the direction of the strange sound to
mouth, as well.”
When Cas walked off, heading for the bathroom, Dean leaned back against the cold brick wall and tried to calm himself. His jeans were uncomfortably tight and the pleasant feel of the plug wasn't helping matters. He was just glad Cas no longer had the ability to turn the damn thing on whenever his kinky ass felt like it.
“Yes, it feels-” Cas panted and his words turned into a moan when Dean sucked on the spot again.
smirk is stupid. What's your point?"
“Sam,” Dean warns.
– please let me come.”
Thankfully, Cas allowed him to finish his breakfast in peace and they both excused themselves as soon as their dishes were clean.
Kevin sighed and the three of them went back to watching the screen, turning the volume up to block out the sex noises that were suddenly coming from Dean's bedroom.
), and a new box of Kleenex on the nightstand. Sam also watches him with an amused smile, but offers no assistance.
“Yeah, don't mention it.” Dean clapped him on the shoulder gently as he passed, headed to the queen-size bed in the center of the room. He pulled back the already rumpled sheets and flopped down on his back, causing the springs in the old mattress to squeak loudly in protest. “Seriously, not a word of this to Sam. First thing in the morning, go back to your room.”
As soon and the thing was off, Dean scooted his chair back to get the hell out of the kitchen (and take care of his raging boner), but Cas stopped him before he had the chance.
really?”
Dean cast a glance at the cluttered table behind him. "Uh, we probably shouldn't fuck on the table we eat at" he said, more because he didn't want to stop and clear everything off (like he should have already done) and less out of concern for sanitation. He didn't seem to fool the former angel and Cas eyed him skeptically. "Alright," he conceded and reached back to shift everything to the far side of the table before hoisting himself up and hoping the fifty year old piece of furniture would hold his weight.
,” Dean groaned and lifted his hips just enough to get his hand between them. He took both of their lengths in his hand and pumped them together as best he could considering neither were exactly small. Mixing the warm liquid from their weeping cocks, he spread it down the shafts as they slid against each other.
Dean cried out and thrust into Cas' mouth again, twisting his fingers through the dark tresses and tugging hard. Cas hummed around him and the vibration on his cock combined with the stimulus to the sweet spot inside was too much. With a final thrust he released, shooting hot spurts in the former angel's mouth.
“It's not ruined, Cas,” Dean said and moved his hand to rest on the other man's knee. He knew Cas had overheard him admit that he loved him but so far the former angel hadn't mentioned it. Dean was by no means a sappy romantic, but that wasn't exactly how he imagined saying it out loud for the first time.
“Well, you’re too old to act like a bitch, but here we are.”
“Do you know how to do it?” Dean asked. He really didn’t mind a sloppy blowjob, and the thought of Cas doing it to him was making his cock throb.
'Did they seriously just pass out?' Mia asked in a quiet voice.
“Just forget about it and eat your damn breakfast before it gets cold,” Dean snapped. He knew he was flushed and his voice was probably betraying his arousal, but dammit, he could at least pretend to be in control.
, Mr. Winchester?"
At the sound of his brother's voice, Dean was instantly awake. He sat up, startled and wide eyed and after a few moments of glancing between Cas, Sam, and Sam's phone he seemed to process what was happening. "Jesus, Sam, what the fuck," he yelled, dropping back down on the bed and throwing the covers completely over himself and the former angel.
“I'm thirsty.”
“Uh, Cas, I'm not sure that's the best position to be in for this.” Not that he was an expert, but he always thought gay guys did it from behind. He was
'Dean, are you asleep?' Cas asked, rocking their bodies together. 'Please wake up. I require your mouth to do indecent things to me. Dean?'
With a surprised yelp, he pulled the door shut just as Cas was starting to slide his pants down and he turned to find Sam waiting next to him in the hallway. Dean was seriously wondering how open Sam would be to wearing a bell around his neck so he couldn't keep sneaking around the bunker like a goddamn giant ninja.
blue eyes. Goddammit, it was the sexiest shit
Dean pulled the bag from the trash bin- which was thankfully empty except for the cock ring- and made quick work of throwing all of the sex toys he found into it. He ignored Cas' curious stares when he pulled open the nightstand drawer and retrieved the lube and anal beads. When they were sure that every trace of their night had been cleaned up, they went down to meet Sam in the lobby.
Not at all.
“Stop being a jackass,” Dean snapped back. “Just hurry up, and save me some hot water.”
“Okay,” she narrowed her eyes. “Well, not technically, but I see what you mean. Is that really a problem, though? It's not like you haven't been attracted to men before, this is just the first time you've acted on it, right?”
"We can always wear them tomorrow."
“Dean?” The barely-there smile drops from his friend’s face. “Is there a reason you’re asking? Did something happen while you were out last night?”
“We're not doing anything,” Dean lied.
“Hey, pause the game real quick, I want you guys to meet Charlie,” Dean said to Kevin and Cas as soon as they were at the door and the two stood to greet the newcomer.
You know how he gets without caffeine in the morning.”
day to do laundry.”
He sleeps several more hours after that and doesn’t wake again until late morning the following day. The thought of eating, and subsequently throwing up food, is unappealing but the protest from his empty stomach makes him want to at least try to keep something down. He grabs his phone to text Kevin to bring him something and notices he has several unread messages.
“Oh, alright,” Cas said, failing to keep the hurt from his voice. “I'll leave then.” He moved to the door, but Dean grabbed his arm and twisted him around so they were face to face.
Cas had said as much.
"Ah," Dean nodded. He wondered why those guys had it out for them in the first place. They seemed to be under the impression that he and Cas were a gay couple, but he's not sure why the fuck they would have thought that in the first place. It wasn't uncommon for two dudes to have drinks together, or to help a wasted friend to the toilet. Racking his admittedly alcohol influenced brain, Dean was unable to think of a single reason that would justify an outsider perceiving them as being anything other than platonic and completely straight friends.
"I found a recipe for apple pie," Cas said to Dean when he had cleared his plate. "It looks complicated, but I would like to try it." Dean placed a hand on Cas' thigh and squeezed when he heard
The car was quite until Kevin spoke up again. "They saw you messing with Cas' shirt."
“Dean!”
Dean turned off the lamp, wrapped an arm around Cas and closed him eyes. He was completely content and sated for the first time in a very long while and sleep came easy for once.
“There's an outdoor performance of King Lear a few towns over,” Cas answered. He held onto his box and started walking towards their bedroom “Sam needed very little convincing, but it's my understanding that Kevin was taken along against his will and I am now indebted to him.”
In general, Castiel thinks he's been handling the whole
“Dean,” Charlie repositioned herself on the bed to directly face the hunter. “I'm not an expert but from what you just told me, it sounds like you want to be with him. I think you already know that. It's
Sam hoped for the sake of their potential (and possibly inevitable) relationship that their first time had not been drug induced. They both deserved better than that.
want him to stay?”
He lets Dean’s spent dick go and brings his come soaked hand up to lick away the mess. Dean can only watch enthralled at the display and Cas fixes him with a heated gaze, his eyes dark with lust, when he leans down and captures Dean’s mouth. Cas’ shallow thrusts pick up and he drives in with more fervor, sliding his arms under Dean to encircle his shoulders and pull him closer as he plunges into him. His movements become erratic and his pace quickens, thrusting in a few more times before he buries his cock deep and Dean feels his insides flood with hot release.
started to play. Dean laughed when he heard it and leaned back with his palms flat on the mattress. 'Not entirely appropriate, but I'm not complaining.'
“What?”
"Because I'm not you!" Sam snapped. Apparently he was just going to have to come right out and say it. "Cas needs
Although, playing Subway Surfers without Dean judging him sounded far more appealing. He was about to open the game app when his phone vibrated and a text message popped up.
"I don't think I had any of Sam's cranberry sauce at dinner," the former angel said suddenly, getting Dean's attention and making him wonder why the hell Cas was thinking about food when there was a perfectly good dick he could be sucking. "I would like to have some now."
Dean had been watching Sam make googly eyes at the Kerstin chick and didn't notice Cas bending over in front of him. He ended up walking crotch first into his friend's raised ass. Cas was pushed forward by the impact and Dean instantly grabbed him around the waist and held him tightly against his own body, keeping him steady.
It didn't take long before he had Cas worked up enough that any talk of the plethora of reasons they shouldn't do it in the kitchen was forgotten. He licked along the underside of the shaft, gliding his lips up to close around the head and suck. Cas held onto the counter with one hand and raked his fingers through Dean's short hair with the other, rocking his hips slightly. He swirled his tongue over the crown then plunged down to take as much in as he could, bobbing his head along with Cas' shallow thrusts.
"Dammit Cas, just stick it in."
"C'mon," Dean said, completely unashamed to be practically whining. "Rub it down real quick and get started. I can't wait much longer."
It was Dean's turn to roll his eyes. “Not sure there's a
want to keep watching. He was curious to know how far they got and how good they looked together. He had a vague image of himself on top of Cas, looking down into bright pools of blue. At this point he couldn't be sure it wasn't a fantasy his mind concocted, but he thought it was probably a memory from their night.
Dean watches the former angel leave before turning back to look at his brother and is met with an expected bitchface.
All three men turned to find Cas standing off to the side carrying a case of beer and a plastic sack.
Sam shrugged. "They had it coming."
“Not that,” Sam says amused. “Cas has been in my room so much because he’s worried about them. They weren’t doing so well the first few days and he pretty much nursed them back to life.” He looks at Dean expectantly.
," he slurred, flushing and taking a few tentative steps to the sink. "Feels better than a 'blow job'."
Dean's eyes snapped open and he looked at the half-amused, half-sympathetic expression on the brunet's face. “Just get it over with,” he said as his bare chest continued to rise and fall in rapid breaths.
Dean glared unamused. "Stop being a perv, you
“Whatcha doing?” Dean asked as casually as he could muster, walking up to stand next to the former angel.
"It better.”
look intimidating if the former angel's mouth hadn't been red and swollen from being sucked on by his horny older brother.
“Please clarify.” Cas unfolded his legs and scooted to the edge of the bed. “Are you uncomfortable discussing your feelings with a man, or discussing your feelings
Laid' plan that suddenly popped in his head. He had to deal with his own gay sex life first. “We haven't even had sex yet so it's not like we'd have a baseline to compare it to. Besides, I don't want him to think I'm only doing it because he wants it or that I'm gonna push him away again.”

"It's only a four-hour drive and you are
“Of course you are, Cas,” Dean answered sarcastically. He really wasn't trying to argue, but he was incredibly stubborn and defensive and Cas' tone set him off. “How exactly has making your own decisions worked out for you so far?” Dean knew it was a low blow and he regretted it as soon as the words left his mouth.
“Uh, you're welcome?” Cas said, unsure if that was the correct response to the redhead's rambling.
town.”
He ran his hand over his face and glared at himself in the mirror. There were very noticeable marks of different shapes and shades of red around his neck and down his torso from where Cas had sucked and nibbled his way over Dean's body. He was surprised Sam hadn't made any smart-ass comments because there's no way he didn’t see them. Dean sighed. He hadn't had a hickey since he was sixteen and now at age thirty-five, he found himself covered in them; given by a man who used to be a freakin' angel.
"Then what makes you think I'd do any better? You're the one into all that touchy-feely crap."
'Fuck, this is awesome,' Dean said, rubbing his hands over Cas' chest and stopped to tease his nipples. 'I wanna make you feel good, Cas.'
“We are,” Sam says when he reappears cradling a small bundle in the crook of his arm. “Them.”
"Come
Cas swayed in his seat to the beat of the music, which became increasingly less terrible the more alcohol he consumed. The cacophony of friendly conversation and music filled the bar and at some point, the two had moved so close to each other their thighs were pressed together. If Dean noticed, he didn't seem to mind.
Cas rolled his eyes at the impatient hunter. "Please don't rush this."
Ugh. Dean's stomach churns thinking about the copious amounts of disgusting bodily fluids he always ends up soaked in when they hunt witches. Nausea returns full force and his legs feel weak. He reaches for the chair again but stumbles and trips over the duffel on the floor. He hears Sam's panicked voice shout his name and fully expects to crack his head open on the tile. He has a brief moment to consider how stupid 'killed by duffel' is going to look in his obituary, when he feels two strong arms wrap around his waist from behind and he’s pulled back to his unsteady feet.
“Oh,” Dean grinned. “Awesome.”
“For fuck sake, Cas, wake the hell up,” Dean said, forcing himself to look anywhere but at the naked man in bed. “We gotta leave soon.”
come back to bed,' Cas called and held out his arms, beckoning the hunter to return to him. 'I
Surprise flashed across Rubin's face before he plastered his fake smile back on. “Kinky.”
“What did we say?” Cas asked.
“I no longer drink tea,” Cas informs him. His voice sounds far grimmer than the statement should warrant and Dean glances up at him curiously.
Dean thought in horror.
“Dean?”
“Sonuvabitch!” Dean groaned. Of course the kinky bastard would make him walk around all day with a giant plug up his ass. “Couldn't pick a little one?” he said out loud, dreading how uncomfortable it was going to be wearing it for several hours. Cas would understand if he refused, but Dean liked to indulge his former angel and if this was the weird sex game Castiel wanted to play - and the reason Dean was denied the opportunity to get or give some morning head - he was damn well going to go along with it.
Cas paused, but Dean didn't respond so he continued. “It's true that I didn't want to go to the strip club any more than I wanted to go to that brothel a few years ago. I don't actually hold the same interest in strippers, prostitutes and having sex with strange women that you do. The only reason I went along and why I usually give in to your whims is because I enjoy being in your company, Dean. It's not that I'm letting you 'boss me around', I'm trying to make you happy. I happen to like the way you smile and how your face lights up when I agree to whatever it is you’re asking of me. So even though I was angry last night, I still decided to go because you wanted to and I wanted to be with you.”
'You're such a freak,' the redhead said just as camera moved to her left to show Dean and Cas holding hands and walking towards them.
“They’ll die,” Sam adds.
It had been two weeks since their disastrous trip to the bar in Lebanon and Dean's failed attempt to get his friend laid. Two weeks of Dean trying to avoid lingering glances, touches that lasted too long, and pretty much any and all non-hunter related conversation with the former angel. He found it surprisingly difficult.
“Just a few.”
Dean’s not sure why he feels guilty all of a sudden.
“He’ll get over it.”
Dean found the videos easy enough, but hesitated before playing the first one.
“I told you,” Dean says, disgusted. He knows exactly what type of “ingredients” witches uses for their nasty spells. “Freakin’ witches!”
“You don’t know the half of it, lady,” Dean says with an unamused snort. “Now piss off.”
“Do you wanna keep going?” Dean asked and Cas didn't hesitate to nod his head. Dean sat up on his knees and pulled his shirts off. Cas' eyes traced over his muscular torso, lingering on the scars and moving back up to his face, he smiled. Dean reached down and tugged at the t-shirt Cas was wearing. Cas understood and sat up as much as he could with the hunter on top of him and Dean pulled the shirt off, tossing it aside. Cas laid on his back again and Dean took a moment to appreciate his body. He placed a palm on Cas' chest and could feel his heart was pounding just as fast as his own was. He ran his hands over the smooth, flat chest and leaned in again to kiss along his collarbone. Cas lightly scratched his nails down Dean's back and ran his fingers through his short spikes.
“Do you expect me to ask how your night was?" Sam sighs. "You made your plans pretty clear.”
“Uh, yeah,” he answered, suddenly feeling embarrassed. “You don't want to?”
“Duh,” she said and passed Sam the popcorn. “They've got like five years of built up sexual tension to pound out. Bet it's like a sperm bank in there.”
“But I don't-”
Miguel smirked. “Anyways, Blue Eyes got upset about that and pouted until Lips gave in and ended up buying him everything he wanted. It was incredibly adorable, in a throw up in my mouth kinda way.”
,” he panted through the sudden spasm. “I can't- I need
“Is that why you have been distant these past few days?” Cas asks.
When they made it to Hastings, Nebraska a little over an hour later, Dean was already regretting his decision. Cas got bored halfway through the trip – which may or may not have had something to do with Dean's taste in music – and began teasing him with the plug. Dean complained about
Sam and Cas let out simultaneous sighs. Dean's cocky attitude was going to be insufferable the rest of the evening, they just knew it. To be fair, they both thought the case would be a bust and said so more than once. Dean however, insisted they investigate the sightings of the “Real Life Swamp Thing” reportedly living in the sewers of Tampa. As it turned out, the creature was not only real, but by the time they had made it down to Florida it had escalated to killing people.
"Oh, there's definitely going to be some
“All this stuff with Cas,” Dean said uncomfortably. “I'm just not sure.”
Cas holds Dean’s weight with one arm and trails the other around the hunter’s backside until his fingers nudge at his opening again, one by one sinking in without resistance. Dean knows he’s been ready since Cas used his mojo, but he lets the angel take his time exploring and stretching until he finds the little bundle of nerves that sets Dean’s insides on fire. He moans as Cas presses into his prostate once more and his hips rock down to meet the deft fingers taking him apart.
Dean shifted in his seat. “'S'nothin'. Drop it,” he said through a mouthful of Cas' abandoned fries.
“I was getting cold.” Cas gestures to the fleece blanket he got as a souvenir a few weeks ago after solving his first case as a real boy. “Sam packed it in his bag yesterday, so I stopped by his room to grab it.”
and why would we require three of them?”
Dean strode forward and slapped the dildo out of Cas' hand just as the former angel began making the thing wiggle obscenely. “Because we don't know who they belong to or where they've been. It's...
lip before capturing it between his teeth. Dean thrust his hips up until they met Cas' and the friction of his cock sliding
“Doing what wrong?” Kevin asked, setting a plate of bacon and a large bowl of scrabbled eggs in the middle of the table before taking a seat.
Only after inspecting every inch outside of the car for damage and taking inventory of the trunk was Dean satisfied enough to climb inside and sit behind the wheel. His wallet was in the front seat and a quick check revealed that all cards and cash were accounted for.
"Fuck," Cas swore again and arched up to rut his leaking cock against the hunter. "
“We're having breakfast,” Cas stated as if Sam was the one acting weird. He looked at Charlie next to him for confirmation and she smirked and nodded in agreement.
Dean turned to look at the dark haired man who was still passed out and
"That's not-" Sam ran his hands over his face. He really did not want to be the one to address the big rainbow colored elephant in the room. "I've tried talking to him, Dean. It doesn't help."
appealing."
Cas pulled back and smirked."I made no such agreement," he said before stepping away to grab a bottle of olive oil from the counter. "If you're suddenly worried that someone will catch us then perhaps you shouldn't have initiated this in a common area." He opened the bottle and poured some out to coat his fingers.
"Didn't take you for a cuddler," Dean commented and wrapped his arm around Cas' shoulders.
“Great! Mind if we hang around for a bit?” Sam asked, flashing her another smile.
“I don't know, maybe,” Dean answered. “I mean, wouldn't you be freaking out?”
Cas looked at him with an indignant expression and Dean captured his lips before he could say anything else. Dean maneuvered them so Cas was on his back and climbed on top. The hunter broke the kiss and moved down to Cas' groin, stopping briefly to pay homage to the warding tattoo with his lips, and continuing on to Cas' cock.
“I like the way these look on you,” Cas remarked as his fingers traced over the zebra patterns in the fabric.
Dean laughed then, having found one of Cas' nipples and made the smaller man jump at the contact. "I can think of ways to warm us both up," he responded, not really caring how cheesy he sounded. He turned his head and slowly kissed along the exposed skin of Cas' neck, working his way up to lick a wet stripe down the shell of his ear before taking the lobe between his teeth and sucking.
“Yes, thank you,” Sam said after stifling a laugh.
thinking? How dare he betray Sam like that.
"Dean-" Cas' breath hitched when the hunter tugged on the waistband of his boxers and freed his half-hard cock. "Dean! We're in the kitchen. Someone might come in here."
“So you sticking with the 'Cas is just grumpy' story or are you going to tell me what really happened?"
“I believe you've referred to it as a
Sam reluctantly took his hand for half a second then ushered a still stunned Dean and confused Castiel out of the building.
Sam rolled his eyes and pointed at the phone in Dean's hand. “Watch them already so we don't have to waste anymore time trying to figure out what the hell happened to you.”
Dean stopped rubbing and smirked at the brunet. “Where'd you hear that?”
“The two girls that were with you,” Miguel shrugged. “Strippers, I think.”
Cas raised Dean's legs up to rest on his shoulders and lifted his hips to line his cock up with the hunter's hole. He pushed forward, breaching the opening and sliding into the tight, velvety heat. He bottomed out in one thrust and Dean hissed and clutched at the sheets, waiting a few moments for the split open feeling to pass. Cas gave him all the time he needed to adjust and when Dean was ready he started to move; rocking his hips at an agonizingly slow pace.
Cas smirked.
The video ended.
Dean nodded in agreement. “We probably should. I hear I have
Dean shifted nervously and side-eyed Cas.
Dean turned to see his brother putting a couple of greasy paper bags down on the table by the door. Oh, yeah, he was definitely going to make Sam wear a bell.
“Alright, that's enough,” Dean cut in, not liking the direction
Cas pulled away from Dean as soon as the door was closed and went to the urinal to relieve himself. Dean went into one of the stalls and was thankful he only had to pee because the toilet was disgusting and there was no way he was going to touch it. As Dean was using the last of his urine stream to blast through some brown grime on the inside of the bowl, he heard Cas make an obscene moaning sound from the other side of the stall's half-wall. For the second time that night, Dean was very aware of his dick and the effect Castiel was having on it.
“Guess they were telling the truth,” Sam observed.
he said quickly, pretending to panic.
“Thanks, Charlie,” he said and headed for the door.
Dean turned the ignition and, despite his sour mood, smiled as his Baby purred to life and he pulled out of the parking lot. There was a rustling sound from the backseat and Sam turned to see Cas digging through a large plastic bag.

of the white coat Cas was still wearing, put his other hand around the nape of Cas's neck and pulled him into a passionate kiss.
“It's fine, just don't do it again,” Dean said, still covering his eyes and moving away from the bathroom door so Cas could go in.

His phone buzzed when an image came through, followed by Dean's message.
“Kinda busy here,” Dean says, turning his laptop to show Cas what’s on the screen. “Season 4 is getting good.”
so Dean could get used to being stretched out around his thick cock.
He refuses to accept the only explanation his mind was giving him, because there is absolutely no goddamn way his baby brother and his best friend spent the night together.
“You're an ass, Cas,” Dean seethed.
doesn't know how to pick up their shit.” He shot a glare at Kevin then got up carefully to pour himself a cup of coffee. “Can we please drop it?”
rolling his hips
With his free hand holding the base of Dean's length, Cas licked around the tip and flicked his tongue over the slit before sliding further down the shaft. When the head hit the soft palate of Cas' mouth, he swallowed around it to create a suction just as his prodding fingers found the sweet spot inside and pressed into it. The hunter moaned loudly, bucking his hips to thrust into Cas' mouth and simultaneously fucking himself on the angel's fingers - which violently shook the table, making the glass dishes clatter nosily and causing the basket of dinner rolls to end up on the floor.
“My name is Dean,
“Yeah, he did,” Sam responds. “It’s not like he has anyone else to confide in.”
“Dean, you were right that they shouldn't get away with what they did,” Sam said, defensively. “I really didn't think anything would come of it since you didn't file a police report and there was no way to prove it.”
Dean chose to ignore the quiet "I'll bet” from Kevin.
He slid a hand under the elastic band of Dean's boxers and rubbed his palm over the hunter's growing erection.
“What?”
Dean grunts and drops his phone on the mattress. If Cas was so concerned about his wellbeing, then he'd already be home. He's sure it was Sam's idea to stay longer in order to avoid getting sick himself. If he feels up to it later, he’ll make a trip to Sam’s room to lick stuff.
“'S nothing,” Dean answered, adjusting his flannel overshirt to cover the semi he was sporting in his jeans. He carefully picked up his cup and slowly made his way back to the table, sitting down with more caution than the first time. He didn't have to look up to know that all eyes were on him for the moment. He glanced at Cas across from him. The former angel looked back with an expression that, to anyone else, would have appeared blank, but Dean could see the delight, underlaid with lust in his eyes.
“We weren't,” Dean responded, irritated with her perkiness and having to watch his brother get hit on for the second time in under an hour. He noticed Cas looking at one of the displays and left his brother and the
to deal with, on top of adjusting to a new range of emotions that he rarely needed to bother with before.
Miguel let out a put-upon sigh. “Sure. Blue Eyes there,” he nodded at Cas, “wanted to get a vibrator; one of the big expensive ones with a million different settings.” He gestured to Dean. “Fish Lips told him
He thinks of what the crazy trucker said to him:
He greedily sucks them in, using his tongue to work over the digits and coat them in saliva.
Dammit! Those were exactly the type of bad thoughts he was trying not to have.
Dean noticed Cas moving away and scratching the back of his neck nervously. “Are you going to give me an answer?”
“I'm not gay, though,” he stated firmly. “I still like chicks and big boobs and all that.”
Dean leaned forward to kiss him, but Cas turned his head away shyly.
“Cas, have you seen my dick more than I've seen yours?”
When they broke apart for air, Dean gave a cocky grin at the state of Castiel. The former angel looked wrecked. His lips red and swollen, pupils blown, and his hair tousled more than usual from Dean running his fingers through it.
Cas’ voice is soft and sincere and Dean can’t stop himself from glancing down at his lips. When he looks up again, he finds Cas’ eyes wide in understanding and turns his head away.
Dean didn't miss when Cas' gaze flicked to the mysterious package sitting on the floorboard before answering. “Let's go home.”
Dean watches them leave, a little offended that the assholes couldn’t spend more than two minutes in the same room with him. He finishes off his coffee, then digs out the ingredients he needs to start breakfast. When he ends up with only enough batter to make pancakes for himself and Kevin, well, maybe Sam should learn to cook his own damn food, since he’s so
“I'm sorry, Cas.” Dean sighed. “I know it's gonna be awkward, but please just give me some time, okay?”
What. The. Fuck.
happened, just don't wanna make it more than it was.”
Cas reached over to the nightstand and picked up the whip. He threw his hand back and
“That guy's a douche,” Dean grunted as soon as they were in the car.
Dean nodded, his eyes cast down towards his phone. Cas moved to sit fully on the bed with his legs crossed. “Dean, do you realize how hypocritical it is to accuse me of being self-deprecating when you continuously undervalue your own self worth, and have done so most of your life?”
“Are you sure?” Cas asked, still not entirely convinced. “It seems a sudden change from your earlier denial. Your friendship is more important to me than anything, and I don't want you to do something you will regret.”
Sam laughs at the empty threat and pulls out a bottle of beer from the pack on the table. “So,
“Most women do not appreciate being referred to by patronizing nicknames, Dean,” Cas said matter-of-factly. “Her name tag clearly said 'Beth' and it was inappropriate to call her anything else.”
"Get some sleep," the former angel orders. "I have spoken with Kevin and he will be checking to ensure you are taking your medicine and drinking enough fluids. You may text him if you need assistance, but he would like me to inform you that he is not ‘your bitch' and requests that you only summon him when necessary."
your soul.”
“Do you know when he'll be in?”
“C'mon, man,” Dean said, standing up and moving to sit next to Cas on the other bed. “I wanna go have some fun.”
Cas sat back and cocked his head. “What do you mean?”
"Shut it. The Tonys were the only thing on TV the other night."
He reached down and rubbed Cas through his jeans. Cas pushed into his palm with a wanton noise and Dean used his other hand to undo the buttons on both of their jeans. He sat up in the bed to get his boots off. Cas did the same and took the initiative to strip off his pants and boxers while he was at it.
Sam looked up from the computer screen, startled by the sudden movement. “Going somewhere?”
and Cas, huh?”
Cas nodded and wrapped his hand firmly around Dean's ankle, elevating his leg. He moved his other hand to grip the end of the small paper clip embedded an inch into Dean's foot and pulled it out in one swift motion. He avoided getting hit with a single spurt of blood and immediately covered the tiny wound with a band-aid. “It's a miracle you don't need stitches.”
surface. Tonight however, Cas insisted that he wanted Dean on their bed.
“God, I hope not,” Sam said with a small laugh.
Dean blinks at her dumbly. He was expecting a demon attack, not to be chastised by a hippie trucker for littering. “What?”
“Of course.” Dean leaned back, his swollen lips meeting Cas' and captured the ex-angel's lower lip between his teeth. He pulled both hands away from their teasing positions and slowly began to unbutton Cas' (
“Shh, you two are giving
“Of course, a kiss works best if

A light blush returned the color to Cas' cheeks and he looked away shyly. Dean found himself thinking grown men shouldn't be that adorable. “I'm sorry, that was inappropriate and I-”
exclusively when I do it.”
Cas was still in the lounge when Dean left his room. He, Kevin and Sam sat on the sofa in front of the TV, now playing a fighting game. Dean leaned back against the wall and waited for the match to be over. He didn't think Cas would appreciate being distracted since he seemed to be winning the round.
The door opens further and Cas appears standing next to Sam, squinting at him in confusion. Dean tries not to think about the fact that he's the reason the former angel's lips are still wet and kiss swollen.
“Whatever,” Sam said, flipping his hair out of his face theatrically. “Just don't do it at the dinner table.”
Dean thought.
“I'm not a child, Sam,” Cas snapped back. “I would appreciate it if the two of you stopped treating me as such and answer the damn question.”
The pungent aroma of coffee combined with the even more pleasant smell of bacon cooking brought Dean out of another night of restful slumber. As his eyes fluttered open and he reached out for his partner, he was hit with a tinge of disappointment when he realized Cas had already gotten up, leaving him alone in bed. It was the first time in a month Dean had awoken without the other man behind him, and the first morning he apparently wouldn't be getting a quickie in before they started their day.
He saw the faded sign, barely making out the words Kurt's Bar & Grill and pulled into the graveled parking area. He didn't fail to notice the only other vehicles in the lot were several beat-up old pick-up trucks and half-a-dozen motorcycles. Dean didn't think that boded well for what they would find inside, but it was still quite early in the evening so he wasn't too worried just yet.
“Dean, I-” Cas’ words dissolved into a loud series of “
,” the redhead pointed at Cas and gave a cheeky grin. “You really don't remember?”
and desire company other than myself and your brother.”
The video suddenly cut to Mia playing with the dildos while the two men made out and dry humped on the bed next to the other sex toys. It skipped ahead again to show Dean dancing in front of the bed wearing only his t-shirt and the pink zebra panties.
After a few moments, he eased his finger out of his hole, wiped the jizz on his already soiled shirt, then got up and headed for the shower.
Dean grumbled, but gave in and hit play.
Cas hit send then realized his mistake and quickly typed another text.
“No.” Dean shook his head even though Sam couldn't see the motion.
Dean let his head fall forward, resting his forehead on the tile wall, letting the rivets of water wash over his sensitive skin. He didn't know what to do. He had been so sure of what he wanted the night before, but as soon as he woke up, all of that certainty was gone. The really messed up thing was he didn't even know what part of it exactly was freaking him out. There was the obvious “gay” thing which while technically they didn't have sex, they had some great non-sex that led to him getting off several times – once with Cas' mouth wrapped around him – and that was
That was just creepy.
Dean watched the brunet set the vibrator aside and grab another item from the box. He was glad that so far he didn't see any weird BDSM crap. “We're always loud, Cas,” he responded with a grin.
Dean shifted to get a better angle to work open Cas' pants, popping the button with his thumb and taking the zipper down enough to fit his hand inside. Cas was still soft under his palm and Dean rubbed him through the thin fabric of his boxers until he felt him starting to stir and swell.
“I do not wish to be a burden,” Cas states.
Sam responded and was unable to hide his grin. Dean's involuntarily cringe did not go unnoticed by his brother. “Everything okay?”
Dean spends the rest of the day watching them while they sort through the extensive Men of Letters archives. Cas disappears occasionally but Sam never follows, so at least they aren’t sneaking off to suck face behind the stacks. He doesn't notice anything out of the ordinary. Sam and Cas nerd out over ancient lore while the latter amuses both brothers with his snarky comments over the inaccuracies in the MoL angelic research and the “flagrant disregard of celestial hierarchy" when they find a particularly contentious document ranking cherubs higher than seraphim. Castiel, it turns out, is classist.
"I appreciate your confidence in my ability." Cas smiled softly at the other man. "However, you're not the only one I'm doing this for. I want Sam and Kevin to like it as well."
Hide and Seek for a reason."
“That's so wrong.” Dean shook his head, watching Cas. “Sam, will you wait for us outside?”
The rest of the weight shifted off of him and Dean found that he was able to move his body again. He rolled over to lay on his stomach, unaware of how close to the edge of the bed he was and suddenly found himself hitting the floor. There was a stinging pain when his knees scrapped the carpet and he let out a hiss.
“We were up late,” Dean explained and opened the door enough to reach out and grab his bag.
he did,” Sam muttered. “Sorry, but no porn on my laptop guys. Of any kind.”
Cas sat back up and flicked the whip across Dean's chest a few more times, putting more force into each blow. He then ran the strips down over Dean's cock and balls and down between the crack of his ass.
“It's fine,” Sam said. “You're a lot more helpful than the guy at the first place we went.”
Cas parts his lips, threatening to break the tense silence, and Dean leans forward to seal their mouths together before he can think better of it. He expects to be pushed away in anger or disgust, so when Castiel,

muscle. Cas took the length of him in his mouth, slid down to the base and then moved up slowly, repeating the action a few times before moving back up, swirling his tongue around the tip and then pulling off.
When the cars parked, a girl with short red hair stepped out of the Impala and went to meet with a brunette from the second car. Dean was the first out, followed by Sam and Cas and they ran to catch the girls before they made it to the side entrance of the building. When the girls noticed the men headed for them they screamed and tried to get away, only to be blocked by Sam, who had gone around the other side. The redhead immediately pulled a taser from her oversized purse and pressed it to the younger Winchester's chest.
“Mmhmm,” Dean grunted out trying to keep his voice even. “Foot.”
, and I've been caressing your freakin' skin." Dean draped an arm over Cas' waist and pulled the former angel flush against him to press the hardness of his length into Cas' thigh. There was no misinterpreting
The waitress, whose name tag said "Suzy" grunted and looked at each of them. Her eyes lingered on Kevin briefly before apparently deciding that she didn't get paid enough to check ID's. "I'll be right back with those," she said and walked off to presumably fetch the beers.
That train of thought was quickly interrupted by a triumphant whoop from Kevin when they finally defeated the robot. Kevin held up his hand and Cas gave him a quick high five then slumped back down on the couch as the game went on. Grinning to himself at the scene, Dean left them to it and made his way to the kitchen for a beer.
Sam and Cas looked at Dean, surprised. “Dude, where's your phone?” Sam asked, trying to keep the annoyance from his voice. It wasn't really Dean's fault, but if he had only checked his phone, it may have saved a lot of running around.
"Of course, I'll be careful, Dean," Cas responds seriously. "I won’t let any harm come to your brother."
"He means pissed as in angry, Cas," Dean informed out of habit. He turned to look at his drunken friend and laughed suddenly. "I can't believe you called that guy a 'little bitch' then Pillsbury Doughboyed him. That was so freakin' awesome."
He was grateful that Sam had not made any cracks about the events of the morning, or afternoon as it turned out to be. Dean knew that if their positions were reversed there would be no end to the teasing he'd be doing. Hell, he would have taken pictures and sent them to all of their friends- which sadly only consisted of two or three other people, but still.
“I don't know either, really. I just wanna make sure that all this stuff,” he waived his hand around the room where various sex toys had been discarded, “isn't your weird ex-angel way of dealing with all the crap that happened.”
“The Rainbow Cabaret,” Cas answered. “We found the address on the receipt.”
The explanation checks out but Dean senses there’s still something important being kept from him. He shoves it down for now and makes himself as comfortable as he can on a lumpy, second-hand sofa with Cas’ ankles digging into his thigh and presses ‘play’ on the remote.

“Whatever, jerk.” Sam maneuvers past him and goes to the refrigerator.
Dean resisted rolling his eyes at the other man's blatantly false innocence. “You know what I mean, Cas. The
Dean's eyes narrowed. “What do mean 'finally happening'?”
“No freakin' way, Cas. I wanna go find my damn car.”
"Next time?"
She smiled to herself and was thankful he was looking away from her. “I think he probably wants the same thing for you. Has he told you how he feels?”
“Hiya, Sammy,” Dean said as cheerfully as he could muster in his still half-asleep and not particularity jovial state.
Dean decides to wipe the smile off the smug bastard’s face by grinding down to run the crease of his ass over Cas’ hard length. His satisfaction in the way the angel’s breath hitches at the contact only lasts a moment and then he’s the one keening when his friend leans down and seizes one of his nipples between his teeth.
Stepping out of the bathroom twenty minutes later, Dean barely had time to register his brother's angry bitchface as a bottle of bleach was roughly shoved at him.
“Mm, I
“It's just an expression,” Dean informed amused. “Are you sure though? Don't wanna over do it.”
Dean was no longer looking at Cas though. He was too embarrassed. He glanced across the table at his brother, who seemed to have found something incredibly interesting on the ceiling above them. Next to him, Kevin had his phone in hand and was just as focused on whatever he was doing. Both were visibly uncomfortable.
Cas twisted around to meet his mouth with his own and pulled the jacket and plaid overshirt off the hunter's shoulders, letting them drop to a pile on the floor. He proceeded to divest Dean of his t-shirt next and tossed it aside.
They held each others' gaze - far longer than Sam thought two completely “straight” guys normally would - only breaking out of their private moment when Sam decided he had enough and forced an awkward cough.
Cas was holding a sex harness swing and reading the instructions on the back of the packaging. “This seems very complicated.”
“You're damn right,” Dean said proudly, not listening to a word Cas said after "you were right" and missing the insult. “I say we go celebrate. The night is young and we're in the strip club capital of America.”
How had they ended up in some kinky sex freak's hotel room?
Cas pulled off and glanced up at the hunter. “You should stop the car while we do this.”
It's not so much that Dean's upset that Cas drove his car (maybe a little), it’s that he had been looking forward to being the one to teach his friend to drive. Sure, it wasn’t his main priority and he focused more on training Cas to fight and hunt like a human, but it’s not like he meant to blow the guy off. He's somewhat irritated that Sam swooped in and took that opportunity from him.
Cas frowned and looked down at the clipboard in his hand. "I would
"Cas?"
“You can make it up to me with a second.”
“Uh, 'kay,” Dean responded. “Not gonna hurt is it?”
“Better leave, and get the fuck outta Lebanon while you're at it,” Terry sneered as he and the other man started to walk away. “We're a
“Are those rats,” Dean asks, taking in the white fur speckled with black spots.
Dean tugs and pulls him a little closer. "Watch out for the witches."
Cas' eyes widened in surprise. “You want me to penetrate you?”
“Smartass.” Dean bumps him with his shoulder.
Cas chuckled and thrust forward, grinding their groins together. 'Your erection is for me?'
“Tape on the faucet? Real mature!” Sam grouses and peels away a clump of hair that’s plastered to his face. “It sprayed everywhere!”
“Dean.” Sam warned. "Don't."
." He threw his arms up in frustration. "Dammit, Sammy, what's wrong with you?" Dean cleared his throat and continued ignoring the widening grin on Sam's face. "I was saying I'm going to help him pick up a
Dean set down his fork and took a swig of beer. "You're really gonna make me a pie?"
“Dammit, fine!” Dean let out a defeated sigh. Honestly, he was glad to have Charlie there since he had been unable to work things out on his own. He wasn't about to tell her that though. “What exactly did my nosy ass brother tell you?”
“Dammit, Dean! Move!”
“Look at me,” Dean said and when cerulean eyes met his he continued. “I'm sorry I suck at this stuff and I'm sorry I didn't tell you before now, but
, how exactly do you feel about that?”
There’s a distinct sound of the squeaking springs from Sam’s shitty mattress as someone shifts on the bed and Dean strains to hear what’s being said.
Cas makes a disgruntled noise, like he had been hoping Dean would sympathize with his plight and let him in on a secret stash. The hunter ignores him and continues looking for anything that will get him out of the bunker for a few days. He only looks up again when he hears Cas shuffle away sadly and pushes down a pang of guilt. Missing one day of coffee isn’t going to kill the guy, and it’s not like Dean was aware of Cas’ recent aversion to tea when he salted the coffee. Witches really are the worst.
When Dean called his name, Cas stirred and opened his eyes, glaring up at him like he was the most vile thing in existence for daring to disturb his slumber. Dean was glad Cas no longer had the ability to smite, because the look he was getting indicated he'd be dead for sure. He handed Cas what was left of the water Sam had given him. “Drink this. It'll help.”
“You ladies better get to talking,” Dean said, taking a step closer. “And so help me, if you put a single scratch on my car-”
. Then there were the commitment issues he developed as a result of his hunter lifestyle. He didn't even know if he was capable of making something long-term work since he only ever tried it once and it was a complete disaster. There was also the fact that he didn't actually know what Cas was expecting of him. They really hadn't taken the time to discuss it before ending up naked in bed and now he didn't know how he was supposed to define their relationship. Where they friends? Fuck buddies? Lovers?
“Yeah,” the brunette nodded. “And for the record, dickbag, I make good money managing this club. Plus we each average five hundred for dancing, and that's on a
“Just – just need a moment,” Cas gritted out. “You're much larger than the plug.”
Cas whined when Dean pulled away with a grunt and climbed off the bed. He went to his pants and fished out his keys, tossing them at Mia. 'Take the car.'
“That's an excellent point, Castiel,” Sam said and smiled smugly at Dean. “Shotgun
He knew he never should have let things get as far as they did so quickly, but as usual, his dick was making all the decisions, and clearly, Cas had the same problem. Dean frowned and pulled himself away from the wall to start washing. He didn't have time for another bout of self-refection. He'd have to sort his feelings out on the drive back to Kansas.
“Well, ‘most people’," Cas starts and Dean rolls his eyes at the use of air quotes, "get to spend their first few years of life acquainting themselves with their body’s needs.” Cas huffs in frustration. “I’m still adjusting and learning to...read the signals.”
While Cas worked on stretching Dean's hole, pushing in a second finger soon after the first, he resumed licking up the cranberry sauce from the hunter's stomach. Cas' tongue glided over the sticky skin, agonizingly slow in Dean's opinion, before he finally, mercifully closed his mouth around his cock. Dean gasped at the combined sensations of the sudden wet heat around him and being scissored open.
Two hours into the drive, they stopped at a diner in Gainesville for lunch. Dean lingered behind the others until they both sat down then squeezed into the booth next to his brother. Hurt flashed over Cas' face for a second before he managed to hide it behind his usual stoicism. Dean pretended not to notice and when their food arrived, they ate in silence. Cas excused himself from the table after he finished most of his burger, and Sam took the opportunity to question Dean.
Dean moved the hand from Cas' thigh to the nape of his neck and pulled him in until their lips met.
Even though his knees were killing him and his own neglected erection was throbbing in his pants, Dean didn't want it to end. He knew he should probably pull off and finish with his hand, but Dean fucking Winchester didn't do anything half-assed and he made a quick decision to go with it. If Cas could do it, so could he. He sucked harder, bobbing his head erratically and hollowing out his cheeks like a pro. The fingers in Dean's hair pulled harder and Cas loudly grunted out his name, thrusting forward as he came, shooting hot streams down the hunter's throat. Dean swallowed as much as he could, ignoring the taste and trying not to gag on it in favor of listening to the filthy noises Cas was making.
Dean heads back to Sam’s room and is not surprised to find Cas still there safeguarding his new charges.
“I know,” Cas responded. He wrapped his arm around the hunter and pressed light kisses onto his warm skin until they both drifted off to sleep.
They lay stuck together for several moments, breathing heavily, then Cas slowly pulled out and lifted off the other man. Dean cringed when he felt some of Cas' warm semen spill out and drip down his thighs. "I need a freakin' shower," he said raising up to stand on shaky legs.
him and brought their lips together again as his hips began to move in shallow thrusts.
The voice startled Dean from his (completely heterosexual) thoughts and his head shot up to look at his over-sized brother. Sam was leaning in the doorway of the bunker's library and watching him with both amusement and slight apprehension. Dean wondered how long Sam had been standing there because it was highly unnatural for someone that large to move around so quietly.
"Holy fuck," Dean said, his eyes going wide, his breath quickening. "When'd you get so kinky, Cas? And where the hell did you even get this stuff?"
She knocks again with more force and when he continues to ignore her, she yanks the front driver’s side open and leans in to glare at him. “I’m talkin’ to you, douchebag.”
“No!” Dean scoffed. “Why would I?”
"Are you angry?" Cas asks.
Cas finished getting dressed and went to shower, leaving Dean alone in his room. Dean quickly stripped down to his boxers and got on the bed, resting his aching leg muscles. He had planned to wait to get his release, but his boner wasn't going away and he didn't want to be on edge for the rest of the evening. He wanted whatever was going to happen with Cas later to last and he knew he wouldn't make it two minutes if he didn't take care of himself now. He pulled the elastic band down just enough to get access to his cock, then grabbed the lube from his nightstand and squirted some into his palm. Wrapping a firm hand around the shaft, he began stroking it furiously. He licked his lips, still tasting Cas' come in his mouth and it made his dick pulse in his hand. It didn't take long before the familiar heat started to pool in his belly and he pumped himself faster. He spread his legs and brought his free hand down to rub a finger over the tight ring around his opening. He didn't know how Cas' dick was going to fit inside him, but gay dudes and freaky chicks did it all the time so he figured with enough prep, it couldn't be that bad. He brought his hand back up and coated his index finger with a slick mixture of lube and precome and went back down to rub it over the puckered hole. His grip tightened around his cock, pumping hard as he pushed the digit inside to the second knuckle and move it around. The unfamiliar, but not unpleasant pressure was enough to push him over, arching his back as he emptied out over his fist and the fabric of his t-shirt.
Rubin seemed to consider the question. “Well, you guys said you were from out of town and that Angel from the Emporium sent you.” Rubin sighed and scratched his head. “Sal, my partner, did say something about two girls that came by looking for you. He checked the rooms, but couldn't find you so we all assumed you finished your

may have fooled him once upon a time, but it was a lot harder to believe now that he was frequently subjected to overhearing the ungodly noises his friend made in the throes of passion with his older brother. He was honestly happy for them both, but was it necessary to be so damn
“Well,” Cas called back after a moment. “I'm already under the water, so you can either wait until I've finished or you can come join me.”
He was simply extra sensitive lately because he hadn't fucked anything other than his own fist for quite some time. He couldn't even remember the last girl he picked up. He vaguely recalled a brunette with pale blue eyes he'd meet on a case in Ohio several months earlier, but the experience left him empty and unsatisfied. The realization of just how long it had been since he had sex with another person, and actually enjoyed it, hit him like a freight train.
Dean sat on the bed and buried his face in his hands.
Dean ignores his brother’s messages and types out a quick response to Cas.
. "I was gonna tell Sam to switch rooms with me so we could talk, but you seemed pretty wiped out. Figured it could wait 'til we get home tomorrow, but fuck," he ran his hands over Cas' toned chest, moving down to trace the sharp line of his hip bones, "is this really happening?"
“I was curious,” Cas explained and reached in his pocket to turn on the anal plug.
That explains why Cas has been spending so much time with them in Sam’s room.
