Prompt from Boo: "Dean and Cas meet in residence, Cas has just gotten away from his stifling, uber religious family that never let him eat junk food or really enjoy food cuz blah blah gluttony blah blah sin (also homophobic as fuck family). But he’s got a full ride to school, money in the bank from a trust fund and a roomie in Dean that is all to eager to intro the art of decadence into his cute roomie’s new free life. Also, maybe Dean and family range from a bit chubby/stocky/well fed, but Cas leapfrogs them in no time."
"Yeah, just takes a bit of elbow grease," Dean replied, flexing his flabby biceps. They didn't bulge in the slightest. "And anyways, it's not really all that tight. Her seat doesn't go back anymore, but it's okay. I still fit."
Sam immediately brought his other hand to Dean’s belly. He worked his fingers gently, and rather than focus on how not even Sam’s giant mitts could hold the entirety of his gut, Dean was mesmerized by how good it felt. This felt so much better than when he did it. Dean let out the breath he didn’t even know he’d been holding, and his middle nudged Sam’s knuckles. Just a friendly belly rub between bros, that’s all it was; no way Sam felt the same way as he did.
"Hey," he grunted, trying to be nonchalant despite the fact that he was sitting in his underwear on the couch, surrounded by beer bottles and empty plates, visibly chubbier than before they'd left. "How was the hunt?"
Dean licked his lips and he took a gulp of his milkshake, keeping eye contact the whole time. Oh sweet merciful god, they were double chocolate. He thought it was a great choice, and he informed the waiter of this as he rubbed at his gut happily. The waiter's pupils dilated.
Castiel giggled, because the nurse definitely hadn't said anything about that last point, but nodded anyway. He drifted off shortly after and was woken up by Dean's light prodding, because he'd brought Cas dinner in bed, a dinner completely comprised of dessert foods, because he was amazing. Cas said as much as he stuffed a cookie in his mouth and moaned.
Halfway through the third week, Dean got a call from Cas while he was eating Doritos and watching Cupcake Wars. "'Ey, Cas," he managed to get out around a mouthful of chips. One dude's cupcakes came out all weird and deflated, and Dean grumbled, "Idiot."
Lucky for him, it didn't stop there. Dean's belly grew and grew, the little gut swelling until it strained at even his baggiest shirts, even the new jeans getting tight around the waist. Dean ended up popping the button off his new jeans in the middle of a rather spectacular dinner, and Cas had to excuse himself from the table to take care of his... rising problem. He silently replaced the ruined jeans the next day with yet
Though Dean hated cardio and refused to run unless something was chasing him - his words - he frequently lifted weights at the school gym, and it showed. His arms pulled at his shirts just as much as his stomach. He was wearing a tank top today, as it was an unseasonably hot day for early October, and his biceps bulged enticingly as he stripped off his shirt, no qualms about his own nudity even though he always seemed to turn into a blushing mess whenever Cas so much as rolled up his sleeves.
At Cas's raised eyebrow, Dean continued. "You pick it up with your mouth," he explained. Cas still looked lost, and Dean had a very, very bad idea. "Here, I'll show you."
The next day was even worse. His back was still sore, so the workout was even more painful, and Cas felt a twinge of pain every time his hefty belly bounced back into place over his shorts. He didn't have to do extra jumping jacks this time, but he
"Oh my god, Dean," Sam said, "just let me do it." The butter packets were all open and smeared on the biscuits within thirty seconds.
Dean hummed in agreement, his belly stuffed so full he felt like he was floating. He moved his hands under the table to rub the very underside of his belly, and his hand accidentally brushed his cock. Dean had to take a huge breath - deeper than any previously - to keep himself from visibly reacting in any other way, and as he let it out, he felt the seam on his obscenely tight shirt tear.
Several berries later, Dean opened his mouth again only to be met with the cool rim of a champagne glass on his bottom lip. He raised an eyebrow questioningly, as Cain himself had been the one to teach Dean about the proper way to drink champagne, and it certainly wasn’t supposed to be guzzled down like this.
“Totally. You always used to look so tired and pale. I’m pretty sure those disgusting smoothie things were killing you, dude. You look way better now, even if it comes with a few less, um, sharp edges.”
When they woke up the next morning, it was to a snow day. Westfield generally didn't call off classes for weather, but the power was down and it was
As he finally got sideways, Dean spread his legs to let his gut drop again and let out a long breath. He looked around the restaurant for the buffet, but his eyes found their waiter first. He was partially hidden behind a partition, but Dean could clearly see his dropped jaw and the tent in his pants. Dean winked at him, and the man's eyes widened as he ducked completely behind the barrier.
After a moment, without opening his eyes, Dean grunted, "Lemme pay," through his heavy breathing. "'S my idea to go to dinner. An' we were supposed to-" he hiccuped "-be celebratin' you."
As Dean's hand delivered the final bite of pie to his mouth, he leaned all the way back and moaned quietly. Both hands now devoted to giving himself a belly rub, Dean took a deep breath and released it all the way, groaning a little when the action pushed his stomach up into his lungs. Nevertheless, he continued to breathe deeply and rub himself down, whining for Sam to rub a spot on the apex of his belly. He could no longer reach it, as his gut was too big and bloated. He'd never been this big in his life. He'd probably put on a few pounds during this meal alone.
“First of all, you’re not unprofessional, not by any means. You’re the most hardworking person I know, and a few pounds aren’t about to change that.” Sam knelt by the toilet and Dean forced himself to not look away. “You’re certainly not a slob, and yeah, maybe you need some new clothes, but that’s okay. You’re not gigantic, and it’s okay that your body is changing. It’s not a bad thing, and it doesn’t make you gross, or ugly. Anyone who can’t see that is an idiot.”
He wasn’t the fastest runner by any means, and his hits were solidly mediocre, but when it came time for the pitching exercise, Dean’s pitches whizzed through the air at amazing speeds and hit their targets every single time. Even Michael was impressed, and Michael was never impressed.
He spread his legs wide and let his gut settle between them. It brushed the seat between his thighs and Dean gave it a fond pat. That was new. Usually, Dean had to lean forward for his belly to rest against his seat like that. Right now he was leaning back, and not by a small amount.
But now wasn’t time for complaining or self-reflection, now was time to face the facts, so Dean levered himself off of the couch and trudged towards the bathroom. Towards the scale. Dean needed to man up and see the damage before he figured out how to fix it. He turned it on with his toe and stared straight ahead as he stepped on, steeling himself. The last cleanse had left him at about one eighty five, and he’d probably gained fifteen or so pounds since then, but it couldn’t be too bad, not yet at least.
"'M fine, don't need friggin' babysitters," Dean said petulantly as he dropped a hand to his belly. Damn, he was full. "Good luck on the hunt."
Dean set the shakes down to his left as he lifted his mammoth gut once again. Fuck, this wasn't any easier the second time. He huffed and puffed as he slowly pivoted to the right, chins and breasts wobbling as sweat dripped down his back. Was it hot in here, or was it just him?
Dean let Cas go and smiled up at him. "I'll stop eating so much food when it stops tasting so good. And don't pretend like you don't love it," he said with a wink as he slapped the side of his gut.
He actually felt a lot better, too; the tear had allowed his belly to expand somewhat, but now that Dean knew how much his shirt was constricting him, he wanted it off
Checking his watch again, Sam noticed that it was now 7:24. The restaurant had a cancellation policy for reservations missed by half an hour or more. Ignoring his ongoing embarrassment, Sam said, "Dammit, Dean! Fine, look, I'll push your stomach in with one hand and pull with the other. Suck in as hard as you can and give me a hand."
So yes, Dean spent most of his abundant free time lazing around the house, and it could get pretty boring. It wasn’t anyone’s fault - Dean just had a short attention span and there were only so many times he could die playing Fortnite before he lost interest. He thought about working one out, but nah, it was always better when he waited, and Cain would be home eventually.
“Um, Dean Winchester. I’m a senior, just moved here,” the guy said, grasping Cas’s hand, and Cas noticed that he was blushing a bit too. The cute boy - Dean - opened his mouth to say something else, but the coach blew his whistle loudly and the other boys jogged over to the pitcher’s mound. He shrugged apologetically and turned to join them, and Cas almost had a heart attack; if he thought the view from the front was good, the view from the back was even better.
This is really becoming an even mix of chubby!Dean and chubby!Cas, isn’t it? I’ve got another fic ready to post in a few days, and one more I’m working on, but leave me some more prompts!!
As Cas worked at Dean's bloated belly, he heard a suspicious-sounding clank. He looked up to see Dean smiling guiltily, ice cream spoon raised halfway to his mouth, and Cas sighed again.
sexy, Winchester. Dean stopped just before the door, one thick-fingered hand already reaching to open it, and he swallowed audibly before he forced out, “Thanks for lunch, buddy.”
Castiel tentatively stabbed a small bite of his apple pie and raised it to his mouth, eyeing it as if it might jump off the fork and bite him. His Mother and Father had always told him that gluttony - added sugars, processed foods, and eating for pleasure - was a path that led straight to Hell, and Cas really had no desire to go to Hell. "Dean, I'm really not sure-"
"That would be much appreciated," Cas said. He wasn't too worried about his weight gain. He'd always been on the skinny side, and getting some more meat on his bones would just make him solid, more mature-looking.
#1: There’s a not-insignificant age difference between Dean and Cas, though it’s nowhere near underage.
“What, bitch?” Dean asked defiantly, taking a seat at the map table. He grimaced, his abused jeans not taking kindly to the action, and cupped his stomach with his hand. Fuck, this wasn’t comfortable at
to accumulate, or so Dean said - in just over two months, Cas didn't hear what Dean said next. "What?"
"So what do you do, Cas?" Dean asked, breaking his personal vow to never make small talk with a customer.
. Never in a million years had Castiel pictured himself growing so large, large enough to not fit through doors, large enough to tire after a mere two minutes on his feet.
"Come on, babe. You gotta admit, this was pretty genius - what could I have possibly forgotten?" Dean asked smugly, quirking an eyebrow.
The guy was beyond attractive, big eyes and hooded lids and plush lips and high cheekbones combining to form a face surely shaped by God himself. His baseball jersey showed off his broad chest and thick arms, amazingly developed for a highschooler, and hugged his plump belly deliciously. He pressed every single one of Cas’s buttons, and Castiel struggled to tear his eyes away.
“You’re starving our child,” he whined, and his stomach growled. “Do you hear that? I’m wasting away!”
his body, but sometimes he got tired of his belly always getting in the way. But, of course, Dean realized that he had to get used to it. He loved being fat too much to lose any weight, and he loved food too much to stop
Dean stuck his credit card in the folder with the check and immediately leaned back to continue his belly rub. Sadly, a combination of his stuffed belly and overall laziness caused him to doze off, and when Sam smacked him in the belly to wake him up, the check was paid and the hot waiter was gone. Dammit.
Dean remembered that night. Cain had been weirdly clingy, wouldn’t let him leave his side even to get drinks. “Jealous much?” Dean asked with a lazy grin.
plates tonight. He'd never eaten that much at a buffet. Hell, he'd never eaten that much period. The waiter finally made eye contact again, and there was a glint in his eye. He knew this would be a challenge. Dean heard a growling noise, but rather than his stomach, it had been Dean himself that made the noise. Oh, sweet
- Dean put his hands behind him and pushed. Every bit of him jiggled as he stood up. The whole ordeal was a little tiring, if he was being honest, but he was a man on a mission.
He had to have gained at least a hundred pounds. No part of Cas was recognizable any more except for his face, and even that looked different, chubby cheeks and double chin hiding a previously angular facial structure. His hips, which had always been the skinniest part of him, were curvy and soft, almost like a woman's, and he actually had an ass now. Thick rolls hung where his flat stomach used to be, chunky arms were forced away from his body by generous love handles, and fat thighs ground against each other. And he'd stuffed himself in the cafeteria before changing, so he looked even bigger than normal, and this outfit left nothing to the imagination.
Dean narrowed his eyes. "Watch and learn, asshole," he muttered. He produced a box of large safety pins from his pocket, smirking triumphantly. "'The full might of heaven' don't mean shit when we got Staples on our side."
“But I thought you were a growing boy,” Cas challenged, eyebrow raised, and Dean took the bait easily enough. He eagerly sucked down his third milkshake and sighed afterwards, leaning back in their booth. He unbuckled his pants with a dumb smile on his face and hummed when Cas, feeling bold, placed a hand on his gut.
"Cas," he mumbled sleepily, turning his face towards Cas's until they were breathing the same air. Dean's eyes cracked open and he smiled, humming. Cas felt the breath catch in his throat and his eyes dropped to Dean's lips, a multitude of thoughts swirling, jumbled in his head.
“How do I look?” he joked, turning to Sam, but his mouth dried up at the way his shirt stretched over Sam’s shoulders, barely contained his biceps. “Uh.”
When they were finally in bed, just a few minutes shy of two, Cas snuggled up behind Dean and ran a soft hand over his overfed stomach. "I don't know why you do this to yourself, Dean."
Maybe it all had to do with how different he was. All the other bartenders were young, muscular, and charming, while Dean was the exact opposite. He was solidly middle-aged, hadn't gone to the gym since he'd dropped out of high school, and mainly grunted to communicate with his customers. He lifted weights at home to keep his arms impressively large if he did say so himself, but still. Maybe he just checked enough weirdos’ boxes to merit the cash. Whatever it was, he wasn't complaining as long as it kept the tips up.
Cas tried his hardest to focus on all his potential teammates that day, but his eyes kept getting drawn back to Dean. At first it was because he couldn’t stop staring at his ass (and face, and belly), but then it was because Dean demonstrated that he had the best throwing arm their school had seen in decades.
Armed with the knowledge that Dean liked him back, Cas... did absolutely nothing. He didn’t want to start something and then screw it up; he liked Dean too much. So the tension built and built, and the team got more and more annoyed, and Dean got cuter and cuter.
Castiel just shrugged and finished his first slice eagerly. His stomach was really protesting now, gurgling unhappily, but Cas ignored it. He still had another piece left, after all.
In case you’re wondering, I chose Cole Trenton as the old ‘college flame’ mostly cause I needed a character that I didn’t mind using as a plot device. I didn’t tag the character or pairing because it’s not really important. Thought about making someone up, but his actor isn’t known for being the nicest guy anyways, so I’m not super torn up about it lol
“Fuck off,” Dean said, but he grinned as he eagerly unwrapped the paper plate piled high with snickerdoodles. He shoved one in his mouth and sighed happily. Lunch wasn’t for another three hours, and Dean needed this like he needed air.
Cas and Dean both grew quiet after that, Dean’s mouth too full for conversation, Castiel focused on a form he was filling out for a customer. Dean ate slowly and took tiny sips of coke between bites, and fifteen minutes later he was in the middle of his fourth piece when he gave up. His temples hurt from chewing, his ass was sore because of the old couch, and his belly staunchly refused to accept any more food.
Dean told himself that this was what he wanted, that he wanted to start working out, that he wanted to toss aside this podgy frame he’d made for himself and get back to Lean Mean Dean. But he felt tired and hungry the entire work week and counted down the days until his gym card was supposed to arrive, dreading the day it did. Because then he’d have to actually go, and Dean hadn’t been to the gym in years; he’d kept in shape by dieting and occasionally working out at home, but Dean was bad about setting a work out schedule for himself and he didn’t think he could go back to salads now that he’d had a taste of freedom.
Although Dean wanted to brush it off, pretend like all was fine and dandy, he instead asked, "You think so?" in a quiet voice. Dammit, he usually didn't care about other people's opinions, but he really liked Cas, and it had kinda hurt when he and Sam had made fun of him. He was used to Sam's teasing - it was practically in his job description as little brother - but everyone needed a little validation now and then, especially from their... from their Cas.
Dean sighed. He was being a crappy friend, and he knew it. “Date with Cole was shitty,” he said. “Nothing really there anymore.” It wasn’t a lie, per se, but Dean wasn’t about to tell Sam that he was grumpy because he was up thirty-five pounds, barely fit into his silk PJs, and had resorted to buying men’s shape wear.
, Dean thought - and his eyes flew down to Dean's belly-shelf for a split second before returning to his eyes. Dean couldn't blame him; it was pretty hard to miss in general, but when Dean's gut was on display like this, it quickly became his best feature. He made direct eye contact with their waiter as he fondled his underbelly, licking his lips as he amended, "Actually, get me two of your favorite."
Once Dean’s stomach had the chance to settle a bit, he and Cas paid and drove to the Winchester home together. Dinner was delicious, pulled pork sandwiches and potato wedges, but Dean only took a thin sandwich and small handful of wedges for himself. He ate slowly, shifting uncomfortably atop his chair, picking at his constricting waistband, and stifling burps all the while.
During the next few weeks, even though Dean and Cas were officially a couple now, not much changed. They held hands in the hallways, made out in their room (plus a little more), and pushed their beds together so they could share, but they were still friends. They still hung out with their group of friends and got dinner together every day. And if Dean sometimes fed Cas from his own fork, or rubbed his belly after a particularly large or decadent dessert, it was nobody's business but theirs.
," Cas said loudly, effectively cutting off his rant. "I know. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be hurtful. The extra weight looks quite good on you, actually."
“It’s because you’ve totally fucked with your metabolism, man,” Sam told him during their weekly drink meetup. “Those horrible ‘cleanses’ you used to go on weren’t good for you. Like, at all.”
Somehow, Cas managed to finish his last lap without passing out, throwing up, or dying. He leaned against the (cool, oh so cool) wall and tried desperately to regulate his breathing, cursing Westfield Academy and its physical education requirement. His old school didn't have anything like this.
Although he was angry and tired and fed up and embarrassed, Cas stood, knowing better than to back talk Walker. Still panting, hands trying to rub out the cramps in his sides, Cas thought he heard wrong when Walker said, "Fifty jumping jacks, now!"
Dean couldn’t help his ugly laugh. “Oh yeah, I feel hot as fuck right now. Just me and my gut, reeling the ladies in left and right.”
By the fourth plate's completion, Dean was starting to feel full. Not full to bursting, by any means, but full enough that he could have stopped if he wanted to. The type of full where any normal person would have stopped eating.
"Perfect," Cas said, his legs bracketing Dean's, one foot on the floor and one squeezed tightly against the seat. He scooted closer until he was sitting right in Dean's lap - the part of his lap not taken up by belly, at least, which wasn’t much - and his thighs pressed into his stomach. Cas flexed his legs and Dean sighed, the slight pressure nothing but a pleasure.
“You trying to get into my pants or something?” Dean teased as Cain set everything down next to the tub and slid in directly beside him. “You know I’m not that kind of boy.”
I... may have taken some liberties with the prompt, but the premise is basically the same! Just several years AFTER s13 instead of during.
Dean was not pouting, thank you very much, but he was a tad bit annoyed. Stupid fuckin' demon had thrown him down a flight of stairs last week, and now he had a broken leg and was stuck at the bunker while Cas and Sam got to go up to Maine and hunt werewolves. They'd left this morning, and although Dean had enjoyed a rather thorough goodbye kiss from Cas, he was still grumpy and bored (
“‘M good,” Dean reassured her, but she just frowned even deeper, so Dean ate another potato wedge with a forced smile.
Dean slumped back in his chair with a sigh as Cas began rubbing, spreading his legs wide. Cas rucked his shirt up above his belly and stroked angry-looking stretch marks with his fingers as his hands worked. It really was amazing, Cas thought, how big Dean had gotten in only two and a half years.
Cas scowled at the nickname and pinched Dean’s side, and it was only after Dean’s embarrassing yelp that he started to trudge towards the entrance. Little trickles of sweat were running down his face by the time they made it to the door. Dean let go of Cas momentarily to unlock the door - “Crazy, right? Being friends with the owner has its perks.” - and offered Castiel a hand after opening it. They wouldn’t fit through side by side, not in a million years, but Dean still wanted to help and Cas still needed it.
“Huh?” Dean said aloud, and Sam was standing right next to him when he looked up. He instinctively hunched over again, tried to hide his protruding stomach, but the sudden movement made him groan.
Either he was too full or too lazy to lean forward and get it himself. Whatever the reason, Cas eagerly handed Dean his next (and last, damn, already?) treat, and it was gone in seconds, the only evidence of its existence an apple core and the sticky caramel on Dean’s bottom lip. He licked his lips and rested his hands over Cas’s, right on top of his massive middle. It sat like a boulder in his lap, heavy and hard, and Castiel would have been worried for the child inside if the doctors hadn’t already reassured them that Dean’s weight shouldn’t cause any difficulties, that a more than healthy appetite was not a problem. Still, it had to be hurting
“That sure as hell ain’t getting any easier,” Dean wheezed, hands resting on his knees. Cas grunted in agreement and shut the car door behind them, his own breath shallow after such a task, and he knew that he wouldn’t fit in the truck for much longer, Dean’s jokes aside.
Cas pulled his shirt up above his stomach and huh, it did kind of look like his binging had taken its toll. His stomach sloped slightly outwards where it had previously been flat, and when Cas poked at it curiously, his fingertip pushed in more than he'd expected it to. When Castiel looked back up and dropped his shirt, Dean's face was red.
And Dean liked it too, if his increased staring was anything to go by. Cas rocked his hips as he walked to the table, making sure to put a little extra bounce in his step, all so Dean had more to look at. He sat down heavily in his chair and spread his legs a bit, something he'd been doing lately, as his belly mounded uncomfortably high in his lap if he did not.
"What the hell, Cas," he said, gesturing at the skin-tight slacks as he angrily shuffle-stepped over to the doorway. "I thought you'd bought a new suit already!"
Third grocery trip of the month and Dean's belly was really tugging at his shirt now, a little crease in the fabric evident where it was starting to bunch up above his stomach. He tugged the sweats' waistband a little lower, too - he'd just had a whole medium pizza and cinnamon sticks, give him a break. Weirdly enough his nipples were also more evident, and when Dean pinched at one to see what the deal was, there was a little more to pinch than normal. Interesting.
Cas's pants had busted for a reason, and his full belly definitely didn't need more food. It gurgled pitifully from where it rested lightly on his thighs, still not happy about the way Cas stuffed himself with junk even after ten weeks of the same treatment, and against his better judgement, Castiel slurred, "Thanks, Dean," and took the opened bag. Damn, the drinks were really starting to hit him now.
Dean groaned loudly and made a show of ever-so-slowly reaching a pudgy hand up to his gut, curled his fingers around the brownie, and made another slow trek towards his mouth. Biting and chewing and swallowing took just as long, especially with the way Dean stopped to heave great breaths in between each bite. His mountainous belly poked out of his shirt, almost perfectly round, and shoved apart the unbuttoned flaps of Dean's fly. It groaned and moaned as much as Dean himself, still angry at this treatment even after years of it.
Eventually, Dean started writing at the bakery, too. He'd bring his laptop with him when he went, right after lunch, and stay all day, snacking and typing and chilling in the same booth until he left to make himself dinner at six. His pastry intake rose with his increased presence, and pretty soon, Dean realized he was eating close to two dozen goodies over the course of about five hours. Definitely not helping him keep his weight down.
"Buddy, I don't know if you need any more," Dean laughed, but he sat next to Cas anyway, leaning against the headboard. He squeaked when Castiel flung a leg over him and hauled himself into his lap, their bellies squashing together (was Cas's actually bigger than Dean's?), Cas clutching Dean's sides like handlebars. "Um, Cas?" Dean ventured, sounding nervous, though Cas noticed that his hands went straight to his love handles.
By the sixth plate, Dean was puffing a bit. This was real work. His gut was pretty damn full by the end of the sixth plate, and this is when Dean usually would have stopped eating. But he didn't want to disappoint his waiter - yes, he'd started referring to him as
"I like cooking, and I like eating, and I'm almost forty, you dick, so sorry if I don't have rock hard abs! And I also happen to like my body, thank you very fuckin' much, so if you don't-"
out there who took care of that type of stuff — no need for him to pick up the torch. Sam heartily agreed, so only two things came out of their supernatural escapades: a new friendship and the loss of Dean’s diet. What could he say? Staring death in the face had a way of making you question your priorities, and Dean Smith, now very much aware of his mortality, decided that he didn’t want to spend his life chugging liquified kale.
The walk back was always the hardest, Dean weighed down and content, his back protesting the strain put on it by his massive, hanging belly. He'd graze on the donuts while he shuffled down the sidewalk, and by the time he got to his house, the donuts were almost always gone and his gut almost always full to bursting.
"Oh crap," Cas heard from the doorway, and he turned to see Dean standing there with pink cheeks. "Sorry, man, I didn't know you were changing."
He still had ten left when the end of school bell rang, and he'd never been more grateful for it in his life. Cas was thirsty, tired, sweaty, sore, and a little nauseous, and he really just wanted to cry, take a nap, or both. Probably both. Thankfully, Mr. Walker had football practice immediately after classes, or else Cas had the feeling he would've been held back and forced to do more jumping jacks. The look in Walker's eye certainly suggested that.
cake was even better than pie. Cas managed to say as much between bites, and Dean scrunched up his nose.
The teacher ordered one student - two, after a quick glance at Cas - to help Castiel to the nurse's office. Cas heard him muttering about 'clumsy fatasses' as he hobbled towards the door, a classmate helping him at either side, but he didn't care, because he didn't have to run a mile today. He smiled widely in spite of the pain, his whole day made better by his throbbing ankle.
“Maybe,” Sam said, and Dean huffed out a laugh, wiped at his face. His friend’s eyes were soft, and that little bit of something he’d seen in them earlier looked stronger. It felt like butterflies were fluttering in Dean’s already very full stomach. Sam was the first person he called after a bad day, his favorite person to hang out with, and quite possibly the object of a building crush that Dean had been suppressing for a long time now. And here he was, taking the time to sit in a coffee shop bathroom and give Dean a heartfelt pep talk.
Swallowing, the taste of whipped cream still on his tongue, Dean whipped up another shot and set it down. Cas leaned down slowly, eyes never leaving Dean's, and effortlessly stretched his mouth around the rim of the glass. He picked it up and drank, slamming the shot glass down when he was done. Dean reached down and adjusted his suddenly hard dick in his pants, thanking whoever was up there that the counter was high enough and his belly big enough to hide his embarrassing and completely inappropriate hard-on.
Dean snorted. "Of course I knew you were replacing my clothes," he said, as if it was the most ridiculous question in the world. "I've had most of these clothes since my twenties. You really think I wouldn't notice that my entire goddamn wardrobe changed?"
Castiel hummed, squeezed Dean’s belly. “I’ve been wanting to do this for months, ever since I first saw you. And it seems that my cookies and pies have only made your middle softer.”
“The man knows what he wants,” Dean said with a laugh, already dialing the local pizza place’s number. Yeah, he knew the number by heart, sue him. You didn’t get to Dean’s size — five hundred and fifty-eight pounds, last time he’d checked — without a lot of pizza.
“Oh, I don’t mind if you take a nap,” Cas said. “I was wondering if you wanted the rest of my pizza. It seems that my eyes were bigger than my stomach.”
He slid in the hot water up to his waist and shivered in delight. Dean had never been in a hot tub until getting with Cain (well, aside from that time he and a buddy of his jumped a dude’s fence, but they’d only spent like ten seconds in it before fleeing a rather large dog, so it didn’t really count), but now he was of the belief that he couldn’t live without one.
“Seven hundred and thirty-two pounds, sweetheart.” He shuffled forward, grabbed two big rolls at Cas’s sides and pressed his face into his belly. “That’s fuckin’ ridiculous,” Dean said, words muffled.
Dean sucked it up and took a bite of his new sandwich, but Cas could see and hear how unhappy his stomach was with him. It gurgled and pushed up his shirt, sat in his lap, big and bloated and heavy. If he hadn’t changed out of his jersey after practice, Cas had the feeling that Dean would be down a button or two.
Spotting a pair hidden in his many slacks, Dean dug around and snagged the jersey-like material. He checked the tag apprehensively and discovered that they were a size medium, grit his teeth, and pulled them on anyway, figuring that the elastic would help. And it kind of did, but he still had to situate the waistband under his stomach. His love handles swelled over the sides, previously slim thighs now pulled the fabric tight, and his gut stuck out in a stretch-marked mound and refused to submit to the waistband. The shorts even felt tight across the ass, so Dean had to be putting on weight there, too, which was rare for him. Hopefully the shirt would cover most of it.
Dean’s the last one to apologise, daring to move his eyes up towards where his mum was standing by the sink of the kitchen now. And he’s not sure he can take much more disappointment.
Dean watches as Chuck plunges into the water, there is a roar of noise from the group below before they all start to quickly realise that Chuck is nowhere to be found, and hasn’t actually come up from the water, since slamming into it moments ago.
When they get there and start to walk up the construction scaffolding, it begins to make crackling noises like it’s going to come crumbling down from their weight, but as Chuck looks back down the ladder, it’s too late for him to chicken out, so he just keeps walking up the ladder, following Dean Winchester above him.
“I arrived about an hour ago but you guys weren’t here yet....It's cool though...I just waited till you guys turned up, no biggie.”
“Probably is gay, too....considering he’s the pastor’s son and all...” Lucifer interjects after laughter and a disgusted face from both girls at what Victor had said is shared between them all. Lucifer bringing a hand around Meg's shoulder. Victor was the only supposedly gay one out of the group.
He says and Dean stops what he’s doing and tenses up, as he wonders if that was somehow directed at him. He knows Castiel had heard of Dean’s reputation with the ladies, more than half the school had at this point. But Dean just takes it as a church bible thing, and goes with the fact that it’s probably to do with the fact that lying is one of the ten commandment, or something along those lines. Instead of the fact that Dean was lying about feeling anything for the girls he had dated or fouled around with in school. And so he goes back to going through the cardboard box of old donated equipment. His mind wondering and passing about, with thoughts of someone he knew and somewhat still knows, but is completely different now.
Sam utters to Dean before giving him a smile and waiting for the retort he knows is coming from Dean, his older brother.
“I Just said it was a nice night for a drive....ended up at the cement factory, found a guy on the ground, tried to give him some help, but then got spooked when I’d seen the security guard and ran.”
Dean explained, knowing all too well that his bullshit of major proportions was only bought because Chuck backed his story up, just before he was carried into the back of an ambulance. And Dean respected him for it, he didn’t have to lie to save his sorry arse, but for some reason the kid had done so. And Dean was grateful, feeling bad as he re-told the story of what happened after the cruel joke they had played on Chuck went wrong.
He moves closer toward Dean and he stands just a little above Dean, proving just how much they had both changed. When they were younger, Dean was the one who would stand taller, when they stood together. The one thing that hadn’t changed was how ridiculously fast Dean’s heart rate beats, he’s pretty sure that anyone paying attention can see his pulse about to rip out of his neck.
His mother Mary doesn't even have to say anything, the pure look of disappointment over breakfast, when he does finally get up out of bed and makes himself ready, walking into the kitchen for food, is enough.
He plays it cool like he’d always done, even when they were kids, watching as Castiel looks down at his lips, wondering if the same memory of them kissing behind a tree that was in Castiel’s old backyard, in his old house that still stood beside Dean's own house now, was playing out in his mind.
Victor screams in the background as the group walks away from Chuck, leaving Dean to talk to Chuck now.
As if in queue, Sam walks into the kitchen then, sitting down at the kitchen table ready for some breakfast before they left for church, his long hair a contrast to the sharp features of the rest of him.
And he doesn’t even care that his time is going to be filled with mopping the hallways or even scrubbing gum from the bottom of the tables, but he can’t believe he has to spend time with Castiel of all people, why this guy, he thinks. And not because Castiel was the furthest thing from cool, but because they had history that Dean had since forgotten a long time ago about, things he doesn’t want to deal with, things that don’t fit in with his life right now.
His British cockney accent making his voice sound more pissed off than what he probably was, but Dean wasn’t going to kid himself into thinking Crowley was anything other than pissed off.
They finally see a lifeless Chuck floating in the water and everything freezes for Dean, before he’s jumping in the water, the seriousness of just how wrong this could have gone, now only just hitting him like a wave.
He looks to the ones involved, first to Lisa, who’s sat with her parents somewhere near the front of the church as she moves nervously in her seat from the gaze the pastor gives her. Before looking to victor, Lucifer and Meg, who all sat in various places of the church, before finally landing on Dean, and signalling with a tilt of his head to command the singing choir to start singing. As if he knew exactly what had gone on and who was involved.
He says straightening the top of his tie up and clearing his throat before Dean agrees to being Crowley’s bitch, and his mum is pleased, thanking the man before she leaves for home to get ready for work, and Dean is left to the mercy of Crowley as the man shows him to his first task of the day.
And there is a silent, “yet”, at the end of that sentence that isn’t spoken, because Dean knows he can’t skip school and stay home forever. Mary just takes a deep breath, opting to mention John instead of getting furious at her son. Knowing that the mention of his dad, would be enough to get Dean to spring into action of wanting to get out of the house, instead of talking to his father. Dean hated his father, although at some point, way back when, it wasn’t always like that, it was quite the opposite at some point. Where Dean would almost worship and do anything his Dad said, and would agree to everything, with a simple “yes, sir” but that was before Mary and John broke up due to an affair that had resulted in a bastard step brother named Adam. In which his younger brother Sam had used as a gloating moment to rest his case that dad was no good.
Victor says giving Dean a fist bump with a smile that contrasted the white of his teeth to the dark skin of his face, as both Dean and victor laugh.
Dean tried not to look towards Castiel as he walks past them, he hears Lisa say “nice sweater” And Castiel actually momentarily stops walking to say “thank you” with a small smile.
Someone that if hes honest with himself and admits to himself, he wants to get to know again. If for no other reason, so he can learn how to control his heart beat and flustering around Castiel. And his stupid blue eyes and stupid tall self, and those stupid lips that he wants to push Castiel against a wall and press his own lips to, just so he can have a taste of what they feel like again.
Dean says as they walk away from the cars. Meg and Lisa holding hands as the rest of the guys walk behind the two girls. Victor, Dean and Lucifer walking together as Chuck trails behind them.
Castiel says with a gruff voice that sounded more manlier than the squeaky voice they both had back when they last spend some time together, when they where younger and pastor Gadreel and Castiel still lived next door before they moved away. Before high school started, before both he and Dean spent a summer apart and found new friends of their own, that wasn’t each other.
And Dean doesn’t even know who says it, but he gets Chuck to the side of the water anyway, somewhere on the concrete ground, out of the water.
Dean questions, because Castiel must of known they would talk shit at the fact that he was admitting to the reality that his sweater had been once his fathers.
“Okay, here’s the deal, your gonna jump from up there, into here.....that’s it, and then your one of us.”
Dean reassures him that there is nothing to worry about again. Placing a hand on chucks shoulder this time.
And Dean is all about ready to barf at the song choice playing in the background, he’s about to try and find one of his friend, whichever one is nearest to him, so he can roll his eyes at them, indicating to the song choice, but when he can't find anyone his eyes glance forward, where a pair of navy blue eyes, dark hair that is wild and untamed, although someone’s tried hard to tame it, falls perfectly in an imperfect manner as Dean stares at the reverend’s son, Castiel.
Dean responds with a devilish smirk as he starts to walk towards the stairs with Chuck following behind, removing his jacket before he begins to walk and that fleeting moment of clarity is gone from Chuck as quickly as it came to him.
Lucifer questions in a manner that he can’t decide whether he wants to be serious or burst out laughing, but just about makes it come across as sincere.
“Now, you have two options...one, be expelled and I never have to see your skrunny face again! Or two, you do what I say, when I say, and you better believe you'll be doing everything from janitor duties, from scrubbing the floors to removing gum from underneath the tables, if I so please, am I clear!?”
The man sat opposite from him begins to bring out empty bottles, one after another, until there is a handful of empty bear bottles placed on his desk, as if he's proving his exhibit's, exhibit A,B and C, for his court case, a court case that Dean has no doubt is coming his way. Crowley had wanted Dean out of his school for a very long time now.
Chuck wants to say that he thinks maybe they were playing a joke on him and that they weren’t actually coming, but making him come out there for no reason, but instead he’s just happy to be a part of the gang, and that this isn’t some stupid prank.
Dean slowly made his way to the kitchen and grabbed a popsicle out of the freezer. The best lighting was by the bay windows, so Dean wandered over as he peeled off the wrapper, opened the camera once more. They were miles from their nearest neighbor; Dean had no qualms about taking slutty selfies in his underwear in plain sight.
Nothing really changed after the whole ghost incident. Screw killing ghosts, Dean was good at the job he had, and there had to be
"Dunno. Nine thirty, maybe?" Dean said, words muffled by the ice cream spoon once again sticking out of his mouth.
A low groan tore itself out of Dean's throat as the sweet, slightly tart flavor burst across his tongue. "Oh my god," he moaned after his first bite, immediately going back in for another. "Benny, this is fuckin' delicious. What is it?"
Once they'd finished dessert, they somehow ended up making out, Dean still in his chair while Benny tried his best to sit in his lap. Dean didn't have much of a lap anymore, so Benny mostly ended up straddling Dean's belly with his thighs, but whatever.
Once Dean calmed down a little, Cas hummed and sucked his dick down to the root, face smushed against his soft belly. Dean gasped and clenched his fingers in Cas's hair, the sensation almost making him come right then and there. He tried to suck in his gut, to give Cas more room to work, but it didn't help much. Cas took his mouth off Dean's dick, and Dean let loose an embarrassing, needy noise.
He found an empty patch of gym floor easily enough and sank to the ground before Walker could decide his exercise for him. Sit-ups seemed like the least painful choice, after all.
“Wait.” Cain stilled and raised an eyebrow, clearly wondering why Dean would want to stop now of all times.
I’m fairly certain this wasn’t from a prompt, but it may have been??? All I know is that this has been in my drafts for over a year. I cleaned it up and here it is! Just a couple things before you read:
“I don’t like other people looking at you,” Cain growled, and he squeezed Dean’s belly possessively. “You’re mine.”
"Seriously, dude, it's okay," he assured, trying not to stare at the guy for too long. Fuck, what was wrong with him? Change the subject, Dean. "Uh, can I get you a drink?"
Dean adjusted the waistband of his pants again, trying to make them more comfortable around his hips. The pants had always been tight, as that was how they were supposed to fit, but lately the elastic had started to dig into Dean uncomfortably. Mostly because when Dean got settled, he got fat; a well-paying job had steadily added to his weight over the past month, and Dean was seriously considering asking for a size up. The tight waistband was slung low under his belly and it still cut into him, leaving deep red marks under his stomach and love handles. Dean lifted his gut out of the way to massage the marks and rolled his eyes when the action garnered several wolf whistles and a tenner thrown on the bar. Jesus, you'd think he was a stripper or something, but he was really just a fat guy in tight pants who wanted to go home and eat his leftover pizza.
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit. Dean’s brain stopped carrying out all higher functions and all he could do was stare. Could a cute, smart, nice guy actually like him back? God, Dean felt like a teenager, his palms sweaty and doubts racing through his mind. But he was an adult, dammit, and before he could chicken out, Dean grabbed Cas’s hand and jerked it forward a little too zealously. It jabbed into his stomach and Dean made an embarrassing noise.
He did, however, have to let his belt out a notch or two, and by the time the fourth week of classes rolled around, Castiel was wearing his belt two holes looser than he used to - three if he'd just eaten dinner - and his pants felt snug around the waist. When he mentioned this to Dean, his friend slash roommate (slash crush, though he was loathe to admit it even to himself) just laughed.
Cas shivered in anticipation, excited at the idea of finally getting to know his own weight. He’d outgrown their scale four years ago when he’d reached four hundred pounds, and it was kind of difficult to go to the doctor’s office when you didn’t have a birth certificate, social security number, or any real proof of your existence. He knew he was big, but he’d love to be able to put a number on it.
"I'm surprised you can button them at all," he chuckled. "You've really been packing away the calories, buddy. You out-eat
"Dean, it's rude to flirt with the waitstaff," Sam admonished. "And get your stomach off the table! Have some self respect!"
Dean eyed Sam’s shirt and slowly stripped off his own, exposing the way his fat spilled out over his waistband all the way around. He snatched Sam’s polo and tugged it on quickly, anxious to cover up his rolls, and threw his own shirt at Sam.
Sam wrinkled his nose. “Gross, Dean. I’m just saying, those clothes haven’t fit you for a while and you sure as hell aren’t getting any smaller.”
“Oh,” Dean said. His heart skipped a beat. “Same, for the record. And I guess I didn’t? Kinda thought you were straight.”
Tucking his cell in his pocket, Dean shimmied forward in his chair and groaned as he stood up, belly spilling out of his lap and settling low in his overalls, heavy and round, the sudden lack of support a little jarring. It growled and Dean patted it consolingly, began the short walk to the break room with a hand still resting on his gut.
Dean nodded and Sam sighed. He sounded more sad than disgusted or disappointed, surprisingly enough, but that didn’t keep Dean from feeling embarrassed.
Cas had brought Dean a total of three milkshakes, three slices of pie, two of Mary’s gigantic cheeseburgers, and about a pound of french fries over the course of their evening. He ate whatever Cas gave him. It really was astounding, how much Dean could put away, and lately Cas had noticed the buttons on Dean’s jerseys getting tighter and tighter around his gut. They’d also stopped at Target the day before so Dean could get a new belt, as his usual one wasn’t up to the job anymore.
Sam sighed. He normally wouldn't mind Dean's tardiness, but he had just finished his finals a couple days ago and was still a little on edge. Dean had suggested dinner to take Sam's mind off of things - and to celebrate Sam's upcoming graduation from the University of Kansas School of Law - but Sam was starting to regret this decision. He was tired, he was stressed, he was hungry... Ugh, maybe he should've taken Jess up on her offer to have dinner with her family that night.
The mechanics and Dean talked for a while, people slowly trickling out of the room as they finished eating, and by the time the pizza delivery person called, only Dean and Cas were left.
"It's quite all right," Cas responded, pulling a button-up over his pudgy torso and buttoning it quickly, a little embarrassed to be seen shirtless. He tried to ignore how it felt a little snug near the belly. Maybe he should lay off the sweets. "How was your workout?"
"Your check, sirs," he said. Dean found the energy to open his eyes just enough to give his now-customary wink to his waiter but said nothing, his panting getting in the way of anything he might have wanted to say. He closed his eyes again, and the waiter gave Sam an awkward smile as he walked away.
"Glad to hear it," Benny said with a hearty chuckle, not-so-secretly eyeing the spot where Dean's hand rested on his belly. "Think I'm gonna call it the Leviathan. Want the rest? I can't start sellin' it now - too late in the day - and I sure as hell can't eat a whole pie by myself."
"T-thanks, darlin'." Apparently it was Dean's turn to stutter. This guy was just getting bolder and bolder, and damn if Dean wasn't into it. And when he winked as he walked away, Dean's dick twitched. Oh yeah, he loved this place, not only for the food but also the eye candy and the crappy flirting.
Almost a year ago now I promised starthief that I had a Smith/Wesson fic in the works - this is that fic. I tried to make Dean and Sam a combination of their real selves and Sandover!selves. It’s been in my drafts for a while, and it’s been through some serious revisions, and it may have gotten a bit out of hand length-wise, but here we are!
Against his better judgement, perhaps, Dean decided to unbutton his vest. He just couldn't deal with all the skintight leather tonight, and something needed to give. Since Dean certainly wasn't about to bartend without pants on, this was the second best option. He was moderately certain that it wasn’t a health code violation.
"'Cause I know you'll take care of me," Dean said on a yawn, lazily turning his head to snag a quick kiss. "Love you, Cas."
"Our reservation was for almost half an hour ago, Dean," Dean said to himself in a high-pitched voice, watching as Sam walked away. God, his little brother was such a nerd.
“Don’t be.” Cain rolled up the lingerie and threw it on the office chair that was still sitting there. He kissed one of the newer stretch marks on Dean’s belly before rising to his feet. “We can talk more about dinner once I get back - I’ve got a little surprise for you first.”
“I asked if you’re feeling okay,” Sam said with a raised eyebrow, looking pointedly down at their food. “You’re a pretty shitty conversationalist tonight, not to mention the fact that you’ve only eaten like a third of what you usually eat. And you always love hearing about the IT gossip. What gives, dude?”
He dozed off and woke a few hours later to some guy with crazy hair and a beard waxing poetic about sloppy joes. Damn, that actually
Sam gave him a once-over and Dean really, really wished that he could cease to exist. He’d been doing such a good job of hiding his weight gain from people, of hiding his belly, and one little slip up was apparently all it took for one of his best friends to get an eyeful.
Dean stood upright after a couple seconds and took a deep breath, his fat middle making his shirt ride up. He gave his belly a lazy scratch, pulled the hem back down, and wrapped an arm around Cas so he could help him walk. “Let’s get goin’, tons of fun.”
That was how Dean Smith ended up ordering shape wear. He ordered something called a ‘belly buster belt’ and a few high compression tanks to tide him over, got express shipping, and almost managed to convince himself it was nothing to be ashamed of.
he wanted to lose it — because he wouldn’t mind being Sam’s pillow, and he really liked being able to eat whatever he wanted — but, well. He had a date with a hot IT specialist who liked him for who he was, and he’d just gotten a first class belly rub from said hottie, and he was feeling good and a little bold.
Dean’s shape wear arrived the next day, and he was a little embarrassed to find that he needed a tank and the belt to hide the majority of his thick belly. Still, he looked a lot skinnier, and his suspenders actually did their job for once because his pants were now a bit loose. His shirts also fit better, the buttons no longer straining to stay closed. It was harder to breathe, and Dean found that sitting down put quite a lot of pressure on his lower stomach, but it was worth it, because Dean Smith was starting to look like his old self again.
For the past five weeks or so, some angel at the garage had been leaving plates of goodies in the break room. Dean honestly had no idea who it was; none of his coworkers had owned up yet, and every note attached simply said ‘for whoever,’ never signed. ‘Whoever’ generally ended up being Dean, much to his delight, as everyone had heard the tales of the infamous Winchester appetite and knew better than to stand between Dean and food, even unintentionally. The type of food varied, though it was usually some type of homemade sweet, and although at first it had only happened once or twice a week, a plate of cookies, tin of pie, or box of donuts had been left on the table every day for the past nine days, and Dean wasn’t complaining.
"Dude, no offense, but you're mom's completely, abso-fuckin-lutely wrong," Dean managed to get out around a huge mouthful of burger. "Eating one measly slice of pie ain't about to 'enslave you to a life of gluttony,' or whatever the hell she says. Now grow a pair and eat the damn pie."
Dean patted his belly and debated his options. He could either go home to his sad little apartment and sleep - alone - until his next door neighbors decided to wake him up with their fighting... or he could go get pancakes with a gorgeous guy and live a little.
"Will you be my taste-tester?" Benny asked, handing the pie off to Dean, a slight blush high on his cheeks, and Dean
Well, maybe he wouldn't call Lisa. Maybe he would go home, finish the pie, and try to jerk off around his mountainous gut to the thought of his waiter. Of "Cas." And then he'd call him in the morning. The whole "72 hours" rule was stupid anyways, and Dean wanted to get to know him better ASAP.
Cas did indeed love it. He loved it when Dean fed him, when he came home from work with bags upon bags of fast food, when he pushed Cas past his limits and left him unable to move for the next hour. Castiel also loved his huge body, and Dean did, too.
Just eight or nine years ago, Cas had been an angel of the Lord, able to move at the speed of light, to fly wherever he wanted within seconds. Now he was human, unable to walk a dozen paces without needing a rest, so fat that he couldn’t even get his belly rubbed without difficulty. He should be ashamed of himself.
Dean groaned dramatically but accepted Cain’s help regardless, pulling himself up with one hand while using the other to keep his gut somewhat steady. He wasn’t about to make the same mistake as earlier and let it just flop into place, thank you very much - he was way too full for that.
Just three weeks after Cas had started joining the Winchester family for dinner, when Dean went to stretch during practice, arms high above his head and a deep breath held in his lungs, a button popped off his jersey. All the guys laughed, including Dean, and Cas rolled his eyes and offered to go to the supply closet and look for another jersey with Dean. The coach warned them against any funny business and gave Cas the key.
Cain returned with his wheeled office chair, and Dean settled back into it gratefully. His belly spilled onto his lap, round and heavy, and Dean sighed. Much better. He felt like royalty as Cain rolled him to the glass double doors, and he caught a glimpse of his own reflection in the fading light. Looked like royalty, too, with his expensive lingerie that barely contained him, his lightly tanned skin that emphasized pale stretch marks. Dean was the picture of decadence, and he loved it.
When Dean went back the next day, he knew that his love affair with Devilish Delights was meant to be when the cute cashier, different from the day previous, winked at him and gave him a free cookie. He wished Dean a nice day in the most
Using his good leg and a crutch, Dean hobbled to the kitchen and yanked open the fridge. As he'd remembered, there was the pizza box in all its glory, and when he opened it, he found that more than half of it was left. Hell yeah. He grabbed the box and clumsily walked back to his room, the task a lot more difficult with an occupied hand, but he made it there eventually. Dean plopped back down on the bed, swung his legs up, and got to work as some guy on the TV pulled a burnt lasagna out of the oven.
Dean gave another long sigh as he readjusted his tight leather pants and clingy vest. Part of the 'uniform,' if it could even be called that. All workers at Purgatory wore some outfit of leather, lace, or both, and Dean was just glad he wasn't in the frilly getup that Victor had to wear. Poor guy had to chafe like a bitch.
“Fuck,” he wheezed. For crying out loud, he was supposed to be at the gym right now. Instead he was sitting in his house in his underwear and robe, belly distended to the point of looking pregnant, unable to move due to how obscenely full he was. At least he didn’t have anything to do today now that his gym plans had been cancelled. Except get drinks with Sam, but that was hours away. He could afford to be a pig, didn’t have to see anyone until then.
Dean tried to shimmy off the couch without success, his distended stomach impeding his progress and weighing him down, making it difficult to breathe, let alone move. He stopped trying after a few seconds and wheezed, ashamed that Castiel was seeing him like this, stuffed past the point of being able to get off the couch. Yeah, Cas knew he was fat — it wasn’t exactly a secret — but Dean was making a fool of himself.
Realizing that he was making Dean uncomfortable, Castiel backtracked quickly. Eight plus years as a human and he still didn’t get the intricacies of their speech. “No, Dean, I didn’t mean it like that. I think you look more beautiful than ever.”
“You can repay me by going to dinner with me afterwards.” Sam smiled again, and the butterflies that had taken up residence in Dean’s stomach went on a rampage.
Dean flopped down on the couch with a huff. He didn’t feel particularly sexy right now — he’d embarrassed himself in front of a sort-of-friend, was too fat for his jeans and shirt, barely fit into his pajamas, and he’d heard more and more of his coworkers gossiping about him. At least it wouldn’t be too difficult to avoid Cole for the foreseeable future. He thought about calling Sam to bitch about it.
Dean rubbed his belly through dessert, through Cas's single-handed destruction of a whole pumpkin pie and half a can of whipped cream, and helped Cas rub the stitches out of his side after he hauled himself up the stairs. As Cas leaned against the wall by the top of the stairs and panted, sweat at his brow, he still couldn't help but smile. He'd just had his first Thanksgiving meal, his doting boyfriend was massaging his side cramps away, and he was happy as a clam.
Dean generally ordered some combination of a dozen goodies and pastries to eat while he was at the bakery, varying between their pies and cupcakes and muffins and croissants depending on his mood, plus the free cookie he always got. He'd devour it all, table moved as far away from him as possible but always a light pressure against his gigantic gut, the increased breathing room still not enough to leave him entirely comfortable. Still, the slight discomfort and humiliation was nothing compared to the fantastic view of the cashier his seat provided, and even when he wasn't working, Dean needed to stay at the bakery to eat anyway. He couldn't exactly carry a dozen sweets
