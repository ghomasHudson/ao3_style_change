The Bunker, like everything else in Dean’s hodge-podge life, happened because Cas wanted it.
Dean hands the bakery bag over. “Two cake donuts with icing and rainbow sprinkles, one chocolate and one vanilla.”
Dean splutters. “You don’t even smash
He’s never liked this office. It’s a corner office, which he guesses is nice, with the pretty Kansas City skyline making a striking backdrop at any time of day, but the rest of the room is sleek, sterile. The carpets are plush, dark grey, and his father’s desk is all chrome and glass. Two black bookshelves adorn the walls, each lined with awards that Winchester Motors has won and the kinds of books that have their titles stamped in gold leaf on leather spines. He doesn’t know if his dad has ever read any of them or if he just thinks they’re the books he should have read but that’s not really the kind of question he can just
Dean feels absolutely blindsided. Careful wording aside, he’s been sort of taking it for granted that he’d become CEO when John retires. It’s what’s always been expected of him, so it’s always been what he expected. He’s really never anticipated that there would be doubts on any side.
“That won’t kill me, you know.”
She hesitated, he could see her change her grip on the blade, she didn’t want to do it. “What about the others? What if they come after me?”
Emma finally interjected, “It’ll still happen, Heaven and Hell wanted it to. They’d do it still and there’d be nobody around to stop it. You could end the world by doing this, you get that right? I mean you’re fine gambling with our lives because it’s three people and they wouldn’t really be dying right, but it’s billions of people on the line if you screw this up. Michael and Lucifer would have decimated the planet if it weren’t for Dad and Uncle Sam, are you willing to risk all of them? Your son could end up being one of the people you’d let die by changing things, and his death would be on you this time. So what’s it gonna be?”
By the time they got to asking him why he was asking for John and let slip they were related, Abaddon was coming through the portal and flinging them against the wall to get to Henry. Stabbing her with the demon blade got her attention and annoyance but gave them just enough time to get to the car and drive off. Sam let Emma have the front seat rather than let her sit next to a man they knew nothing about other than he was asking for John, and well, considering John’s track record with other hunters there was a good chance he probably wasn’t terribly fond of him.
After checking in to make sure everyone was okay Dean explained Cas leaving with the tablet to them while pointedly ignoring his own confession during the retelling. He could barely think about it and there was no way he would be able to say it aloud again, it was better off not talked about anyway. Cas had left, he knew where they stood on that matter now. If someone leaves then that’s that, it says it all. He talked to Sam about the trials and what Cas said about him not being able to be healed from what they had done to him while Emma and Meg worked to try and fix up a couple cuts they’d gotten from the fight. Nothing bad enough to need more than a stitch or two at most, but the more they could do now would make it easier to fix up later.
So Regarding Dean comes around and he doesn’t have his memory. He forgets Sam, he forgets Emma too. He can still kinda tell she’s important to her and he’s even more adamant about trying to remember her name when Sam and Emma tell him who she is but it’s still slipping. And that hurts but Emma gets it’s the spell and not him.
After Emma got behind the wheel, he showed her how to adjust the mirrors, seat, and how to grip the wheel for the best control. She was hesitant, a bit nervous about the power of a car, but during that first lesson she only swiped a curb once with the wheel as she turned. Dean let her know it was fine, she hadn’t done any damage and to just be a bit more careful. He was careful to not convey his own nervousness because he knew that wouldn’t help. He refused to raise his voice during the lesson, A) it wouldn’t help, and B) it was part of the pact he’d made with himself after finding out about Emma, even before she showed she wasn’t going to kill him he decided that he had to be better than his dad whenever he could be. Overall she did really well and was clearly much more confident by the end of the lesson. Since they were already there and she seemed okay he had her try and park a few times, one time for every circle of the lot. Not very good the first few times, very much in the middle of two spaces the first time, angled all to hell the next, but after a half a dozen she was doing alright, and he had her try and park near curbs and in the crappy small spaces partially taken up by the concrete planters. She got to being consistently good and they swapped seats so Dean could drive them back for the day to keep her from being overwhelmed on her first lesson by having to drive around other cars.
Emma has a friend in Rowena
So I think with Magda’s trauma around everything supernatural and her psychic powers I think she’d be much more hesitant around Emma if she knows from the get-go, but if Emma helps save her then she’d probably connect hard. And I think Emma would push to have Magda stay with them for a little while at least to get her powers under control (okay I just want to save her but it’s my au) so Magda moves in. And Sam is really into the whole teaching the new gen of psychic kids because he knows how scary it is, and Emma helps keep her calm and focused because that was big for her learning to control her powers. And Sam is a good teacher because by now he’s had a good bit of practice helping with Emma’s school stuff, ASL, and general hunting crap and also is drawing on what he remembers about his own powers.

Emma hated having Chuck in the bunker, God or not he was annoying and disruptive to the flow of their lives. Plus he never seemed to wash his own dishes and she was half tempted to break his stupid #1 Dad mug over his head. #1 Deadbeat maybe, but #1 Dad he is not, she had only met a few angels for any length of time but she knew enough that he'd royally screwed the lot of them up in one way or another. Cas absolutely felt abandoned by him and would get the same kind of look on his face at times when God was brought up as Dean did when her grandfather was brought up and that told her enough right there. She'd read John's journal and if God was anything like John, then well, a mug would be the least he'd be owed. The main thing that kept her from doing it was the fact that he said he could help them with Amara, and getting rid of her was too important to ruin their chance on that.
12x16 but with Emma
She threw herself completely into trying to figure out how to bring him back, going over tracking spells in the library, she tried to figure out if Sam would be able to cure him and make it through because of the trials remaining incomplete but started by his hand, and at the same time searching with less and less hope each day that she’d find some new bit of lore on the mark.

They got her out of the bathroom and onto one of the shitty couches in the living space and she explained what was going on. Demons were searching for Lucifer’s crypts in order to find an angel tablet. Now that was interesting and potentially helpful. After Meg got them up to speed on the basics they moved back to the house with the now dead demon in the kitchen.
Dean was right, It took a few months to get it back in shape, only a few of the parts had gone bad from sitting around for as long as it had. The biggest problem they ran into was finding replacement parts that weren’t ridiculously priced because while they weren’t exactly hurting for money with the cards Charlie set up, some old habits die hard. They were even able to find a new stereo for it that would let her play tapes or, to Dean’s exasperation, hook up the iPod Sam had gotten her when Dean was in Purgatory.
His gaze flicked towards the wrist she’d flashed him earlier to gain his sympathy, she could practically smell her own burnt flesh again as he looked. She looked at him again and set her blade down. “Okay,” she took a deep breath, “okay so what do we do now?”
Before she could respond and ask what the Men of Letters were or what kinds of powers she had, Sam and Dean came back to the table. They got up to date with what Henry knew about Abaddon and were as confused about what the Men of Letters were as Emma had been. He convinced them to drive four hours to what was now a comic book shop to try and show them what they were apparently legacies to only to find that the old chapter house was completely gone. A bit of googling sent them further out on their chase to a cemetery in search of the grave of Albert Magnus.
“Tell me what you need!” Castiel cried and then stopped short of the bed. “Did you just call me ‘
Cas was sort of looking down at his shoes, sneaking a little peak at Dean. “I just wondered if you still liked Batman, is all,” and it was so quiet Dean could barely hear him.
“Because Dean and I are brothers. We’re not…you know.”
“Oookay,” Dean said slowly. “That hadn’t actually occurred to me, but now that you mention it,” and he smiled at her with his best leer, which wasn’t a very good leer, really. He was still only twelve, after all.
John whacked Dean on the back of the head before settling in the chair opposite him. “Watch your mouth.”
“I’m sorry, Dean. I can’t get comfortable in this bed. It is far smaller than the last one.”
Castiel rolled so he was facing Dean, their breath mingling together and Castiel’s big blue eyes blinking sleepily at him.
Dean groaned and stood up. “Cas, man, that’s just wrong. We’ve talked about getting the food
“No,” Castiel sighed over-dramatically, as he was prone to do these days. “Dude, this sucks.” He was also trying out some new phrases, though Dean had no idea where he’d picked up that one.
?” Sam echoed.
“Of course. I am versed in pop culture.”
And okay, Valentine’s Day was
“You ate some of my potatoes,” Cas chided, but he was smiling when he reached across the table and swiped a piece of hash brown off the corner of Dean’s mouth. Cas licked the piece from his finger and then sucked the end between his lips.
“Not funny, old man. So I don’t have to help Sammy with his?”
“Your mind is always in the ditch.”
“Where do you come up with this garbage?” Dean asked him, but later he thought about it.
“What?!” Dean cried. “Why do I have to help Sam? He can do it himself.”
“The Mists of Avalon.”
“I, uh, those look great, I have to…you got this right, Sammy?” and Dean headed for the far corner, just to grab Castiel some socks.
“If you auditioned for this show, they’d have to cut you,” Dean said around a mouthful of nachos. “On account of you being such a freaking hulk that no dance partner could possibly be tall enough for you.”
“I’m just saying,” Sam went on, picking at a thread on his sleeve, “it’s sweet, but he really does need his own clothes. But I maybe over-stepped my bounds. Sorry.”
“I dunno, something in some book they read at school.”
“Why are they like an old married couple?” he asked.
“I don’t know if you are allowed candy,” Dean said, not completely sure of himself, which he was sure had never happened to him before.
“Telling Caleb about the magic frog.”
“What do you think it is then, Dean? What is wrong with Sam?”
Dean looked in the direction Sam had just fled. He vaguely remembered doing this exact same thing with an even messier little Sammy, once upon a time. “Don’t know,” Dean said and then looked back at Cas.
Cas started dealing the cards again.
worth it.
“Break any of ‘em and you’ll need a day job just to pay me back, got it?” Bobby growled at him.
bear. That’s totally hardcore,” which okay, maybe it wasn’t, but Dean didn’t want Cas to think he had to be ashamed of the present, especially since Dean liked it so much.
Dean blinked at him. “No. You’re not.”
“Tongue,” Charlie told him, like Dean was ridiculous for not knowing that. “Give a girl some chocolate, make her feel special, get a little tongue in return.”
Dean’s head jerked up a little at that. “What?”
“What the hell for?” Dean exclaimed. “Wasting all my hard-earned money.”
“They act like such an old married couple,” Dean said and waved his hand at the TV screen.
“It’s good, you and Dean, you know?” and Sam let himself out of the room.
To be honest, it
Castiel burrowed even further against Dean’s side.
“But it’s a
Sam started for a second at Castiel’s movie knowledge, then pressed on. “They could. And it’s true, Dean and I have known each other longer than you and Dean have…”
Dean took his new pencils up to the sharpener at the front of the room then. He broke in two pencils and when he turned around, Castiel was standing there, staring at him with wide blue eyes.
On the other side of the store, Dean was trying not to look back at Cas.
“Yeah,” and Dean pulled the box of chocolates out of his coat. “It’s not the biggest sized box, but it’s not the little box either.”
“You know what else is nice to do without purpose?” Dean asked him and Castiel just tilted his head at Dean.
“Then I’ll just get you something awesome next month for your birthday,” he said instead.
But then Charlie threw the soccer ball into the middle of the field and everyone quickly got distracted with a game.
Dean groaned out, long and low and real. Castiel’s breath caught in his chest and his eyelids fluttered closed. Dean leaned down and inexplicably kissed each one. Castiel gripped the back of Dean’s neck, fingers clutching desperately at the short hairs there.
“Huh,” Dean said and did the same.
“Dude,” Dean said with a smirk, “you should see your face right now. It’s
“You’re happy right?”
“I happen to enjoy Sam’s taste in literature. Beside, it is nice to read without purpose on occasion.”
,” Dean reminded him, pulling away with just the barest of movements, voice teasing and happy, and Castiel smiled against Dean’s lips.
, Dean repeated in his head, but reached over and ran a hand through Castiel’s hair anyway.
“Because he’s graceful?” Sam asked.
Bobby looked up from his stack of paperwork. “Hi, kiddo. How was school?”
Cas rolled the other way and Dean shoved him until the other man’s face was almost into the wall. “Better?” he asked.
A really quite skanky and, most likely, cheap hooker.
“Here, Cas, let me…” and Dean flicked a finger down and across Castiel’s chin, swiping up the cream and licking it from his finger.
“You got someone special in mind?” Bobby asked, because Dean regularly changed which girl he liked and Bobby couldn’t keep up anymore.
Anyways, Dean had figured it wasn’t any big deal – his dad was used to having to pick up those boxed cards for him for school, and of course he would have to buy some for Sammy too, which would make the blow of demanding their dad spend money a little easier. Sammy had this way of getting John to be happy about wasting money on stupid things.
Dean stood up from where he had been tying his shoe. “Batman? Yeah, I don’t know if I’m getting Batman cards again this year. I may go with The Avengers, just to mix it up. But I mean, Batman is still the most badass superhero there is,” and Dean looked around real quick, just to make sure no teachers had heard him curse.
Dean pulled out the next card – Hawkeye shooting an arrow through a pink heart – and started filling in Pamela’s name.
Dean trudged into the back of the auto shop and knocked on the open office door.
The End
,” Dean said.
,” Dean said and continued to stare at the place where Castiel’s finger disappeared into his mouth.
“Hey, Dad?”
you two do, having him wear your clothes, or whatever,” and Sam shifted uncomfortably in his chair.
“Dean, I was enjoying myself.”
The blue stuffed bear had been kind of squished under all of Dean’s textbooks and homework but when he pulled him out, Sam squealed in delight.
“Somethin’ on your mind, boy?” Bobby asked and made Dean’s day when he pulled a box of cookies out of the desk and handed them over.
“Yeah, Cas?”
Dean had to agree.
“Did Sammy give it you?” Dean asked and crawled up the bed to sit next to Cas. “Cuz if he did, then it’s a chick book.”
Castiel glanced at the clock. “Nearly twenty minutes.”
Dean was sitting at the kitchen table filling out his Valentines in as neat of hand-writing as he could muster – per the teacher’s instructions – when John came in and pulled a beer out of the fridge.
“For who?”
Dean kind of couldn’t stand Charlie’s sister, so that was really no help at all.
“I suppose I have a girl problem,” he said at last and Bobby looked both amused and horrified. “See, the thing is, if I want to buy something special, you know, like for
There were a couple of girls in Dean’s class he wouldn’t mind calling his girlfriend, though he wasn’t sure what that entailed exactly – passing notes and holding hands and sitting together at lunch seemed to be the norm. But the thing was, he could probably only afford to buy
“Cas,” Dean sighed and pulled the other man towards him.
“Sorry…and there is no way he’ll give me any extra and I need some extra, Uncle Bobby. You know, for Valentine’s Day.”
“I’d love one. Thanks, Cas.”
“What the hell is this?” Sam asked, without looking up at the TV.
After a moment of silence, Dean said, “That one I call
“Oh good lord,” Sam shouted and threw open the car door. “I
And that was kind of not-so-dumb.
kind of dumb. Dean was twelve and a boy and teddy bears weren’t really his thing. But even from here, Dean could tell that the Batman outfit was handmade.
“You know what,” Sam said and threw his hands up in the air, “I don’t need to hear about you guys having a threesome,” and he stalked off and climbed into the car.
“Cherry filling,” Cas told him.
Cas opened to him immediately, let Dean tilt his head a little more, press their lips together a little harder. When Dean’s tongue came out, Cas met it with his own, the softest of touches, no urgency at all.
“Huh?” Castiel asked and let Dean wrap an arm around him, pull until they were flush against each other.
“Don’t be stupid,” Dean answered and put a straw in Castiel’s soda. “No one thinks Cas is mentally disabled.”
“Sure. What’s up, Sammy?”
John got up then, headed over to the counter to start dinner.
“It’s my fault…”
for those.
“Your
Sam handed Dean a picture frame made of popsicle sticks – painted blue with green hearts all over – and in the middle of the frame was a photo of Sam and Dean sitting on the hood of some old beat-up truck in the salvage yard at Bobby’s house.
“I didn’t say that,” Castiel bristled.
Castiel watched him until the door fell closed.
Dean shrugged. “Can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em,” and he passed the nachos over to Castiel. “I bet Cas could totally win this show.”
The former-angel turned so said ass was right in their line of sight.
“It’s a
“Huh,” Dean said and stood up to fetch himself another beer.
Fifteen minutes later the TV was droning CSI in the background and Dean was down twelve bucks at the table. He threw his cards down and scowled at Cas.
“You should have ordered your own bacon,” Castiel said and snatched his piece back from where it was hanging out of Dean’s mouth.
not getting in the middle of that one.”
“I’ll just…” and Sam motioned off down the dirt path and took long strides away from them.
But it was a long time before Dean did.
“I told you two to behave back there,” Sam said and kicked at the back of his seat.
“A little too much,” Dean said and then looked at Castiel’s crest-fallen face. “Man, Cas, if you want to hook up with a chick, that’s cool. Just not
There’s a buzzing in the back of Dean’s head. “What?”
“Well, I dunno. You been keeping an eye on supper?”
“Yes?”
them.
“I don’t… Dean, I still don’t think I spoke in haste, but…” Cas sighs, and tension seems to drain from him along with the gust of air from his lungs. “But okay. Yes. You can stay. For a while.”
Once Dean graduated with his own degree, he sat Sam down and told him the truth about vampires, werewolves, and the supernatural. He laid everything out for the boy, whose eyes got wider and wider the longer Dean talked. Once Dean finished, Sam sat in silence for a few moments before the yelling began. As far as Dean has come with his therapy (Cas thanks whatever deities are listening for Dr. Moseley every day), he still doesn’t do well with loud confrontation. He got right back into Sam’s face, matching Sam shout for shout. They ignored Cas’ attempts to calm them down until Sam stormed out of the room, intent on finding Bobby and “getting someone who’s not
Asa looked at Dean appraisingly. “You’re a good man, Dean. Cas is lucky to have you.”
Gabe’s nose immediately wrinkles. “Ew, don’t get your sincerity all over me.”
Something is pressed to his lips and he can tell that it’s been torn open. Something wet and
It makes no
Dean stormed out when Castiel wasn’t able to bring himself to answer his question right away. Balthazar, in a rare show of restraint and diplomacy, stayed silent while they disposed of Uriel’s body, and continued to stay silent on the drive back home. There are no words to describe how grateful Castiel is for his old friend.
Dean thinks mournfully when he finally returns to the farm. Night has fallen completely, and the only sign that anyone is awake is a lantern burning in the kitchen window.
Because Cas wanted it.
“Like I went three rounds with a bear,” Dean croaks, his voice rough with sickness. He frowns a little. “What’re you doin’ here, Cas?” He starts to pull away, weak though he is. “Gon’ get you sick.”
“Do you… Can you…” She takes a deep, deep breath and seems to steel herself. “Can you read me a story, Papa?” she asks, the words bursting forth from her.
“Hey,” Dean says gently. “Are you okay?”
“Ca, if you don’t want to do this, or if you’re uncomfortable with it, we can find someone else to-” A loud, rumbling snarl. “...
Despite everything going on, Dean’s lips twitch upwards into a smile. Cas, too, relaxes a fraction, and they share an amused glance over her head.
It’s probably a bit counter-intuitive for a houseful of vampires to have followed a human child to California, which is famous for sunshine and beaches. If they were going to leave Kansas, it would have made more sense to go to South Dakota where Bobby Singer lives.
Charlie looks up again, watching them twirl around the dance floor. Mr. W effortlessly spins Mr. N, and for a moment, Charlie sees them as they were when they were younger. They’re not
“No,” his husband grunts.
A sparkle in those blue eyes tells Dean that Cas knows exactly what kind of effect he’s having. If Dean wasn’t so fucking gone on him, he’d say something about it. As it is, he gives into the endless desire to be as close as possible to one Castiel Novak.
Cas is resplendent in a black robe with pewter accents down the front. It makes his eyes glow in an unearthly way. Dean knows it's just stupid polyester over what Cas was wearing earlier, anyway, but it gets him hot under the collar.
He has, by virtue of what he is and how long he’s been it, almost unlimited resources. But it’s been so long since he interfered with humans, and so long since he had a companion. Does he even know how anymore?
Dean grimaces again. “Well, that’s not cryptic and ominous or anything?”
“I know where Naomi will be,” Cas says grimly. He looks over at Dean, who gives him a supportive nod and squeezes his thigh gently.
“It wasn’t brigands that shot me, it was a mark. Uh, my… Victim, I suppose. He got wise and chased Sam and me out of town on the wrong side of a pistol. That’s why Sam and I split up. We got a system to meet ninety days from the last day we saw each other in the closest town to the closest river. One of us will have a room in the easternmost inn under an assumed name.
“Hey, we gotta go, babe. Lucifer has someone coming to clean up, but we’ve gotta scoot.”
The silence stretches for almost a full minute before Castiel breaks it.
Finally, he reaches the last door on the left. There’s so much to sift through here - pain, confusion, loneliness, dark humor, terror, and a terrible sadness - but it’s all undeniably the same flavor, the same note that so affected him last night. He hesitates for only a moment before looking through the small window into the room.
They follow her around the building to a second door. In letters four feet high along the path, the word ARBORETUM is displayed and lit up with minuscule spotlights as they walk. The foliage is thick, beautiful, a testament to the skill required to cultivate it. There’s another set of glass doors at the end of the path, and halfway to them, the scent of blood starts to fill Cas’ nose.
Derogatory slurs at the beginning of the chapter.
“I think he’s telling the truth,” Cas says, pulling Dean’s bleeding right hand into his lap and opening the first aid kit. “He knows your father, at least well enough to not like him. He seems quite earnest.”
The shape of the situation has started to form in Cas’ mind, and the only thing he can think to say is, “Under the circumstances, it seems more appropriate for you to call me Cas, doesn’t it?”
She couldn’t say why, but there’s something… Slimy about him.  He’s never anything but a perfect gentleman to her, but she doesn’t trust him. He wants something that he’s not saying.
Cas looks up from where he was focusing on Dean’s leg and cocks his head to the side. “I beg your pardon?”
The sun is beating down on him, searing his skin and hurting his eyes. There’s a fair amount of dust in the air from the hard-packed dirt plain, and when they’re walking over grass, there are insects

It’s a problem for a different day, however. For now, Cas cups Dean’s cheek in his hand and runs a tender thumb beneath his eye.
“I’m sorry if I startled you,” he says as she takes it. “I’m Dr. Smith, touring the facility.”
his space, and the fact that he had to means that Dean has failed as an alpha, as a provider.
“I don’t know why she came back down, the dust hadn’t even properly settled, and I don’t know why she was so angry, but she pulled me down off of the wall with no more difficulty than she would have had retrieving a dressing gown from a hook, put me on my knees, and proceeded to hit me.
A collar that Cas is reaching up and yanking at to straighten it.
Dean dies in this chapter. It is described in detail.
“I can see that,” Cas murmurs. Over one arm is a massive basket filled with several dozen roses, as well as a few bunches of herbs. He sets the basket down just inside the door and makes his way into the house slowly, almost warily.
“I find that I am… Incredibly nervous.”
“When Gabriel became an adult, he asked to be turned. It took me a long time to agree, but Gabriel and Joshua’s faith in me allowed me to change him without harming him permanently. Once he was able to keep himself under control, he left the church to travel. After a time, I did, too. The cloth, Joshua’s life, while it was simple and healing, wasn’t for me.
“It’s Charlie.”
After a beat of silence that must be incredibly awkward, Dean clears his throat. “Uh, okay. Do you wanna show us…”
Dean, who’s holding back his orgasm with the last shreds of self-control he has.
“Sheriff,” Dean says genially, “Fine day we’re having.”
For now, he squeezes Dean’s hand where it’s held in his and lets Dean look around to his heart’s content.
When he does look over, Sam is scowling, but he yanks Wisdom’s reins and vers to the right. Dean lets himself be relieved. There’s only one man chasing them over the dry, dusty plain somewhere in the Missouri territories, and he can’t pursue both of them. Hopefully, he can smell that Dean is injured and come this way, so Sam can-
Dean’s brain stutters to a halt.
it. That’s why I got so mad, Castiel, I was so
Dean rolls his eyes. “Great. Let’s go. We’re meeting Sammy for diner. Prepare for an interrogation, kiddo, Sasquatch is six and a half feet of puppy dog eyes and ‘wanting to get to know you.’”
Dean is well-versed in Castiel’s nightmares. He knows about the variety of psychiatric institutions Castiel’s mother forcibly admitted him to as a child, about the kind-hearted nurse, Missouri, who figured out that Castiel wasn’t insane and helped him become emancipated at sixteen, about the struggles Castiel still has with anxiety, overstimulation, and self-worth.
“It’s unnatural, what you’re doing.”
Because this is how Dean has always reacted when Castiel has been even the slightest bit injured. Always a bit accusing, a bit angry, and mostly worried sick. Dean is muttering about getting blood into him when they get home, ignoring that Dean himself has a few wounds that are just this side of significant.
“I beg your pardon?”
“We need to split up!” he shouts instead of answering Sam’s question.
Without saying another word, Castiel turns and darts back up the stairs. Gabriel shouts, and there seems to be a scuffle behind him, but he doesn’t turn back around. Once he gets to the bedroom he and Dean share, he leaves the door open behind him and goes to sink down onto the bed. He rests his elbows on his thighs and buries his face in his hands.
“And why is that?” Oh yes, his lips are quite numb. He’s a bit surprised that he’s still conscious.
Castiel refrains from pointing out that Dean has already asked a question. “Mhmm.”
He wants to be with Cas. He wants to watch him smile and laugh and frown and concentrate and eat and hunt and sleep and read. He wants to be with Cas forever.
The choice is taken from him when he’s abruptly swallowed by blackness.
“You’re
In the moments after Cas’ hesitant offer, Dean only thought of how good Cas smelled, how nice it would be to have the omega close while he did something as domestic (and, if Dean’s being honest with himself, submissive) as shaving Dean’s face. He thought, briefly, that he might be able to lose himself in the fantasy, even just for a few moments.
He goes inside, orders, and finds a corner table to settle down at and think.
Dean clings tighter, wordless in his gratitude and confusion and need. Cas stays with him like that for a long time.
“There,” Cas murmurs, finally breaking the silence that had settled over them. “Good as new.”
Cas beams up at him, unselfconscious and beautiful. “And I, you, alpha.”
- I love and hate this chapter equally, tbh. But it's here, written and posted, and I'm done fucking with it. Tell me what you think!
“My apologies.”
He feels, as if it’s going on very far away, a sort of
Claire whoops in excitement and scrambles into her father’s lap. She’s radiating elation, her scent sweet with happiness. She settles herself eagerly and leans back against Cas’ chest with the book open on her own lap.
The thought tastes sour in the back of his throat. He lets his mind spin and wander for the rest of his run, making no attempt to rein himself in or make sense of his thoughts.
“Fine,” Cas says, but he’s softened a little, looks a little less on edge. “Let’s go to our seats and get this over with.”
(The closer they were, the more it would hurt when she lost them.)
That hand curves around his jaw and gently coaxes him until he turns his head to look into Cas’ eyes, warm and blue and so beautiful it makes the breath catch in Dean’s chest.
“Quite convenient, then, that we have an opening.”
There’s an awkward beat of silence that Cas genuinely doesn’t know how to break. What Dean is suggesting is outrageous, insane, and borderline offensive. If it wasn’t for the earnestness with which he insisted that they’ll both get something out of it, Cas might even accuse Dean of outright manipulation.
That’s… Actually a really good point. It’s the first time Dean’s ever heard of anything like this, and his parents wouldn’t hide it from him if it had happened before. As long as they shut it down hard and fast, nothing will come of it.
Castiel laughs. “I beg to differ.”
“Cas, who is it?”
Cas is dressed in a Star Wars t-shirt that’s almost old enough to be called vintage (and almost certainly began life as Dean’s), a ratty pair of jeans, and a pair of converse. His hair is a mess, and he’s still got the grumpy, squinty-eyed look he has in the mornings. He’s so sexy it hurts.
Unfortunately for Gabriel’s flair for the dramatic, everyone who lives there is far too used to his antics. Dean doesn’t bat an eye as he returns from the kitchen with two steaming mugs of coffee, placing one in front of Sam. Sam doesn’t even look up from his work, just wraps his hands around the mug and grunts his thanks. Balthazar is still making faces at Sam.
Dean doesn’t really like running.
Dean needs to get something to clean them up with. He needs to open the window to clear out some of the heavy scent before Claire inevitably comes knocking early in the morning. He needs to get Cas a new nightgown out of the dresser and maybe take his soiled
running a con on you, Cas, I swear to the gods.”
Benny’s not proud of those years of his life, but he doesn’t lie about them, either. He was in a gang, a violent one, and it was a bad crew. It wasn’t until Andrea was lost to senseless violence, a gunshot no one could tell him the origin of, that he got out.
Castiel doesn’t lower himself to respond verbally. He spins on his heel and stalks out of the school.
Therein lies the problem. Castiel Novak is polite and apparently quite kind, but he is
*is actually made of iced coffee now* 'Sup, y'all? Bet y'all thought I was dead.
“That’s it, baby,” Dean murmurs. “I’ve gotcha, just let me take care of you.”
But Anna is already pulling her purse out of her desk drawer. “Where are we going?”
“Hey.”
(See the end of the chapter for
an insidious voice whispers to him late at night when he’s in bed with Cas.
“Hush now, Dean,” Cas murmurs, “just rest, I’ll do everything.”
“After that, the traps must be checked and reset, then anything that’s been caught must be skinned and prepared. Then there’s the midday meal, and I have to check on Claire’s reading. As long as that goes smoothly, there’s embroidery, alterations, and darning to be done.” At Dean’s inquiring look, Cas goes on. “The young man from down the road who sells my rose oils in town, his name is Mick, he also picks up sewing work for me and takes the completed work back. I’m quite adept with a needle, if I do say so myself, and that and the roses give us enough to buy wax and oils for the lanterns, and new fabric for clothes and shoes.” Castiel smiles a bit, looking out the bedroom window fondly. “The cow, the chickens, and the traps keep food in our bellies, too, but it all keeps us quite busy.”
Even if he let Claire be in the room, even if Dean got her name and her sass and her small, barely-there smile, Cas doesn’t trust him.
- Hi. This is where I tell you that I don't actually have a problem with mental health institutions, doctors, being medicated, or anything else that Castiel seems to condemn in this story, and neither does he, really. These places and these treatments have their place - Dean's is an extreme and

Dean kisses the base of his spine. “Yeah? You think so, sweetheart?” he asks, his voice rough and low and smug.
He lets Dean lead them until he realizes where they’re going. He pulls away, ignoring Dean’s protesting whine.
“I love you, too,” Dean says in a rush, almost a gasp, a relief to finally have the words out loud, hanging in the air between them. “Cas, of course I do, you know that.”
The warm feeling bursts back to life in Dean’s chest.
“Pretty sure yelling and breaking shit is the wrong way, babe.” Cas starts to protest, but Dean waves it off. “What does the kid want?”
Benny, walking in behind Dean, laughs out loud. “You’re not wrong, cher.”
fairly pretty if he does say so himself.
It’s over now. In a moment, Dean will ask him to leave, and he will. He’ll go, and he’ll hunt down that bitch Naomi, and he’ll put her down for good. He doesn’t know what he’ll do after that, without Dean, but he doesn’t want to think about it. He’ll murder his mother, avenge the only man he could have realistically called father, and he’ll go from there.
“Very well, thank you,” Cas answers politely.
“I’m his half-brother,” Adam says simply.
“Cas,” his voice is soft, gentle, “Cas, baby.
Whichever comes first.
“Son,”
“It’s okay,” Zeke soothes, “I know, you’re too good, you’ve taken care of so many people. It’s okay if you don’t remember. I’m disappointed, of course, but it’s to be expected. I knew, though, I knew you felt the same way.”

makes him want to growl and snap. Which is entirely nonsensical and he refuses to think about it.
hiring.”
Castiel and Dean surge to their feet at the same time.
His words dry up on his tongue when he sees the soft look on Cas’ face. His eyes are shining and his lips are pursed, just a bit, just enough to let Dean know that he’s holding back strong emotions. When Dean smiles, a bit more tremulously than he’d like to admit, Cas beams back at him.
“Tell him to wait for me.”
“Not… Not for murder, no>”
“That’s right,” she says, satisfaction oozing from every syllable, “lay it on thick, my loyal subjects.”
She’s chattering away at about a hundred words a minute, clearly to keep him occupied and there.
This his mother gave to him.
Cas is.
Gabriel asked, of course, after they fled Naomi’s house, about the First. Castiel tried to keep an open mind, tried to let Gabriel make his own choices, but ultimately told him everything he knew. That all of the research he’d done for Naomi to track down Lucifer had come up empty, useless. She’d never been happy about that particular report, but in the end, Castiel had never found anything.
- The boys interact next chapter! I promise!
- It just felt right to post these 3 chapters together and get this situation nice and resolved for y'all. Have some light angst and fluff.
All he knows is that one day he was flirting harmlessly with Bela (it means
“Love you, too, sweetheart,” Dean whispers, pressing another kiss to the top of Cas’ head. “Come on, you big mutt.”
He’s wigging out - he’s gotta get out of here. “Anna, I just quit my job.” He ignores her gasp and the way her hands fly to her mouth. “Now, you can stay here if you want, but if you don’t-”
Dean grins and kisses him again, then bends to whisper in Cas’ ear. “And when this is over, we’ll ditch the graduation parties our parents have worked so hard for, get in Baby, and drive ‘till we hit the west coast, gorgeous. You and me.”
Blood has always meant something more, something profound to Dean (though he’s just as passionate about their chosen family). To discover he has another brother, one he had no knowledge of, whose life he has not been in, and who he has had no opportunity to protect, but who is ultimately a stranger, must be quite confusing.
Dean stares down at the omega in his arms and tries very hard to keep whatever he’s feeling out of his scent. He must not do a very good job, because Cas blushes scarlet so fast Dean worries he’ll swoon into a dead faint.
One dark, sculpted eyebrow raises. “Yes, Dean?”
“You are,” Cas says with a smile, “about to say something terribly noble, I think. It’s just who you are, you can’t help it. But before you do, you should know that I have precisely
“Yes, dear? What is it?” he asks, which would be polite if it wasn’t for the grumpy tone in the bitten off words. Affection swells so much in Dean he’s not sure he can contain it all.
Cas is sitting on his bed, propped up against the headboard, reading in the low light of the lamp beside his bed. He looks up when the door opens and gives Dean a small, tired smile. Dean’s heart thumps hard against his ribcage in response.
“Good night, omega.”
“Help with what?”
And Mr. N makes sure he’s warm, along with everyone else, with his soft, worried blue eyes and his soft, handmade hats.
However she did it, she must have made them seem important enough for Lucifer himself to meet with (words Castiel genuinely never thought he’d have a use for) them as soon as they’re settled in their rooms.
When he thinks about it, it’s honestly the closest Castiel ever feels to his mother.
“We’ve already spoken about disturbing Dean,” Cas says, “and you still have chores and reading to do.”
He follows Dean out of the car with no more idea of what to do than he had before.
They go into the building, and the signs become clearer as they approach.
of distress.
“When I turned twenty-one, she revealed to me that she was a vampire. I didn’t believe her at first, but it… Didn’t take her long to convince me. She had to do considerably less than I did to make you believe, dear- ah, Dean. It was a different time. Fantasy and reality were much more difficult to separate.
The hall, so bland before, is littered with bodies and blood spatters every wall
Dean nods. “Yeah, but we need to go now.”
His eighteenth birthday party is tastefully decorated, delectably catered, and well-attended by all of his mother’s peers, colleagues, and several representatives from area colleges. None of Cas’ friends have been invited, save Balthazar, who has been miserably stuck to his own rich, overbearing mother’s side.
With supper thusly begun, they set to cleaning up their mess. Claire continues to chatter and open up, and Dean soaks in every word eagerly. He notices that she tenses up as they get closer, so he tries to keep a healthy distance between the two of them. It puts her at ease, and he’s grateful again that his history has given him such keen observation skills.
Before Dean can respond, Cas is sinking down on his cock, making his vision blur as he’s suddenly sheathed in white-hot tightness.
Assured that Cas is entertaining Claire far away from the windows, Dean puts on the most ragged clothing he owns and goes to take care of that bastard, Michael.
(If he’s being honest, he’s a

“Any food that tastes a bit off?” Ketch continues. “Any places ‘round there that it might be a little
“I’ve worked here my whole life! How much more attached do they want me to be?”
Cas doesn’t take his eyes off of Zeke,
He’s pulled away from his thoughts by Gabriel jabbing him in the side.
“There’s a reason I don’t take Claire into town, Dean, and a reason that Mick comes and takes the orders back and forth for us. Stop that rumbling, alpha, you know Mick is just a nice young man! My point is that I doubt the townsfolk are going to care much one way or another if they’ve only met you the once, they’re still going to gossip right in front of you, if not right
Dean’s world stops spinning. It’s a gentle stop, but final, silent.
Dean blinks. “Come in, Sam.”
Cas laughs softly when they try to whisper over each other, then says, “Kiss me, alpha,” affection and warmth thick in his voice.
Finally, the man shrugs a little and says, “My name is Castiel. And yours, if I may know?”
The Bunker is basically one giant room. In the middle, dominating the space, is a raised dance floor. On one side of that is an even more raised dais, able to house either a DJ’s set up or a live band. The rest of the room, the lowest level, is dotted with tall tables and stools, all gleaming. For now, the stools rest upside-down on the table tops and all of the lights except the ones from the kitchen and above the bar are turned off.
Now that they’re older, his favorite Cas when he’s getting ready for bed in the winter. When it’s cold out, Cas sleeps in old, faded long-sleeved tee-shirts and flannel pajama pants. He’s all warm, cozy softness then, and Dean can’t get enough of it.
Dean grins. “You won’t love me if I get fat?”
Dean has heard Cas play before, of course. Cas practices obsessively, one hour a day after school and a couple a day on weekends. He knows, sort of vaguely, that Cas is pretty good.
he assures himself.
Nick came to her when she was alone and
It’s not long until Castiel comes back. He has two thin rabbits and one fat pheasant on his belt. He blinks at Dean and Claire, who are at the table, side by side this time. Dean leans back from where he was reading along with the pup in one of her workbooks and eyes the game Cas is carrying.
Dean plans one hand on the wall next to Cas’ head and looms close. Cas’ breath catches, almost unnoticeable. Then again, there’s not much Dean doesn’t notice about Cas.
For a moment,
Dean’s hands tighten on her tiny body where he’s holding her, but she doesn’t seem to mind.
He knows that Cas is embarrassed about his state of dress, of course, and Dean would love
Dean said yes. Because he’d do goddamn anything for Cas. He’d walk through fire, shoot himself in the leg, drive Baby right off a cliff if Cas wanted him to. Cas is such a loving, soft soul beneath his analytical, too formal exterior, and the fact that he loves Dean’s battered, broken ass means that Cas gets what Cas wants. No question.
you like, right?”
“Weird,” Dean said and then disentangled himself from Castiel to head to the bathroom.
“That’s different.”
, Dean thought.
“Did you need something from me?” Castiel asked, without looking up, his voice rough from hours of not using it, hours spent sitting on the motel bed in the dim light, flipping the pages of his book.
The saleslady probably knew too.
“Driver picks the shotgun,” Dean said.
“Is everything alright with Sam?” Castiel asked, the sound muffled as Dean tried to coax him out of his tee.
, dude.”
The End
Sam threw his hands up in the air. “I don’t need to hear that,” he said and climbed into the backseat.
Dean just smiled and dragged Castiel into the room after him.
Dean turned back to his stack of cards. Valentine’s Day was

“Why would his name be

Charlie came over then and plopped down right on top of Dean’s desk.
“Could so,” Dean said, lip pushed out in a pout. He was a little offended on Castiel’s behalf. Cas could totally do some of those fancy twirls and shit. Dean would bet he was a very flexible guy.
“Language.”
too small. “Face the other way. So your back is to my chest.”
“Good night, boys! Sleep well!” he called as he disappeared into the room marked 1E.
“But there
“I ordered you a burger, that’ll come next. Try these first.”
“So You Think You Can Dance,” Castiel said, from where he was perched on the edge of the other bed, shoveling in a Dairy Queen burger.
“I dunno. I mean, I got a few people in mind. I just gotta play my cards right and pick the right one.”
“Okay,” Sam said, rather loudly, “first of all, I don’t need to hear what you think about his body. Second of all, he could not win So You Can Dance, or whatever it’s called.”
“Cas?”
“Knock it off,” she told him. “I just saw it and I didn’t want to have to wait until like Christmas to give it to you. Just be cool about it, would you?”
“Turn around a little,” Sam added then and made a motion for Cas to rotate.
earned money, I believe would be the correct way to phrase that,” Castiel told him.
comfortable vibe going on,” he said and then scrunched up his eyes. “Kind of like you and Dean.”
Dean had gotten a couple of really fancy cards from some of the girls. One had nearly a hundred pink hearts drawn all over it, while another had so much glitter in the envelope that it stuck to Dean’s jeans and he couldn’t get the glitter off for the rest of the day. And Pamela gave him a postcard that had a picture of Jimmy Page on it, which was
“Some what?” Dean asked, because even Charlie wasn’t stupid enough to think any girl was putting out for a teddy bear.

“Cas? Man, what happened? What’d Sam say?”
Dean shrugged. “Dude, it’s Cas, he has no personal bounds.”

The bed was still slamming against the wall, Castiel’s face was flushed and Dean’s chest was heaving.
Castiel kicked his feet out and they collided with Dean’s knees.
Castiel already was.

Dean smiled pretty much the rest of the day and even his little brother being jacked up on sugar after school didn’t ruin his day.
“I don’t need to see that,” Sam muttered and shoved away from the table.
“So,” Dean said, “Sam gave us our own room.” He uncapped the bottle and leaned against the mini-fridge in the corner.
Dean didn’t know what Sam’s problem was, but he figured it was done and now it was his job to show Castiel the ropes.
“Not like that,” Dean said, because now
“Why are we watching this?” Sam asked and slurped his milkshake.

“What’s a hickey?”

“I’m sorry, buddy. That sucks.”

,’ but the other man was warm and draped half over him and breathing pleasantly across Dean’s throat and…
Dean took a cookie from the box, bit into it and chewed slowly, mulling over the answer.
Dean was staring at Cas again because Cas had stopped talking and was licking his dry, chapped lips – his pink tongue darting out and wetting.
“M’not an angel anymore,” Cas mumbled from his side of the room.
“I’m sure he doesn’t mean anything by it,” Sam said, his voice soft. “He probably is talking to her about last night’s Daily Show or something.”
“I. Heard. Him.”
“Yeah, but some of that mojo and grace had to hold over. Plus, you’ve totally got a dancer’s body.”
“Batman is better,” Dean said because it was an old, familiar argument between them.
“Thanks, man,” Dean said and tried to play it off, so Charlie could save some face.
“Cas, lay still.”
“Don’t be silly, Cas. I have important things to teach you and I need you
“I’m not hitting on you,” Pamela told him, when Dean went over to her desk to tell her ‘
“Well,
“Pants too?” Castiel asked him.
Dean slid his hand up, carded his fingers through Castiel’s hair and pulled the other man against him. “Nothing to fix, Cas. You’re perfect just like this.”
“Yeah, dude, Batman is The Man - that’s why they call him
“Thanks,” he said, then chewed it slowly. “What’d you get?” Dean asked, while Cas ate his own piece. “Mine was dark chocolate caramel.”
“Fuck, Dean, fuck!” Castiel screamed and slammed the bed against the wall again.
Being twelve was hard.
of them.”
The kiss was over before Dean could really register what had happened, but his heart was still pounding super fast and his palms were all sweaty and Cas was making the best face ever, eyes half-closed and lips slightly parted, and the only thing Dean knew for sure was that he wanted to do that again.
find it easy to read you,” Castiel replied and shrugged.
“Dean?” Sam asked, after a moment of silence.
“No foolin’?” Sam asked.
“Hello, Dean,” he said. “I’m not hiding.”
“That’s it,” Dean said, and then louder, “Come on, baby, let me hear you. Don’t gotta share the room tonight, you can make all the noise you want.”
“You know,” John said after a moment of silence, “it’s okay if you give Valentines to boys.”
“Is everything alright with Sam?” Castiel asked.
Cas sighed. “I can’t say their very first names in any language that a human can understand.” He squirmed and then tensed against Dean’s side.
Dean reached out to take the teddy bear. Their fingers brushed together then and Cas’ hand was warm and soft. Dean studied the teddy bear carefully and then smiled at Cas. “Thanks, Cas. I love it.”
“Okay. When did you start reading chick books?”
Charlie shrugged. “It’s cool,” he said and slapped Dean on the shoulder, before going back to his desk.
Dean glanced at Sam, who had voluntarily gotten into the backseat of the Impala. “Huh,” Dean said and then looked back at Cas.
“Huh,” Dean said, watching the way their fingers fit together, and then looked back at Cas.
Dean slapped him on the chest. “Loosen it up, baby,” and then he grabbed a fistful of Castiel’s shirt and slammed him against the wall, hard.
not worth this.
“Is everything alright with Dean?” Castiel asked.
It wasn’t that Dean opposed prostitution. In fact, he was a big supporter of the career.
Dean thought about the box of chocolates and the teddy bear stuffed inside his desk, but Pamela would laugh at such girly gifts and anyways, she wasn’t hitting on him.
John swallowed the last of his beer and pointed a finger at Dean. “That isn’t even a little bit funny, Dean.”
“No,” Sam corrected. “It’s ‘driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cakehole’. My cakehole is shut, but I get shotgun.”
Sam snorted.
But, he reasoned, it was probably best not to let Cas get an STD in his first year of being human. And this woman definitely had an STD. Dean’s heart raced a little at the sight of her dirty hands stroking down Castiel’s bare arm. His face heated up as he wondered what would have happened if they’d stayed in the pawn shop any longer.
, he thought, then shook his head to clear it from going down that road.
“I got you something,” Cas said so quietly that Dean almost didn’t hear him.
“Wait, what?” Dean asked, as Castiel slid back into the other booth.
And he had to find a way to get some money on top of it all.
, Dean thought.
, Cas. I think I needed to hear that.” He stood and motioned at the door. “I’m just going for a walk, for a bit. And…Cas?”
“Thanks, Sammy,” and Dean half-smiled at his little brother. “Just don’t tell no one, okay?” and he tugged Sam along behind him.
He wondered what had happened that he hadn’t gotten a card from Cas. He knew Cas had given out cards, because Dean had seen him walking around the classroom, passing them out. Maybe it was an accident. Maybe Cas had overlooked him somehow. Dean hoped that was it. He hoped Cas wasn’t mad at him for something, even though Dean had no clue what Cas could be mad at him about.
voice.
“Think you’re cheating over there, buddy.”
Sam looked over at Dean and then at Castiel, still staring at himself in the mirror. “Well, it’s good to know you have progressed to the no-personal-bounds stage, but I’m just saying, you know, whatever.”
Cas opened the box and was staring in at the chocolate like he had never seen anything so grand in his life.
“Come on, baby, beg for it,” Dean said.
Dean was sliding into his jacket for recess when Charlie came up behind him.
Dean chuckled. “I think you were going for ‘

.” And Dean bounced up and down on the bed, making the old springs creak and groan. “Fuck me!” he yelled towards the wall and then turned back to smile at his friend, huge and bright. “If you understand what I am saying, Cas.”
“Maybe I should buy you a bookmark,” Dean said softly and leaned in to press his lips against Castiel’s own.
Dean figured his dad was probably right about that. He flipped through his stack of cards, looking for the perfect one for Sally. He decided on Thor swinging his hammer and saying, ‘
“You can’t get him to shower or lay still to sleep or not twitch everywhere in the backseat, but you can get him to shove nasty food down his throat and watch bad TV,” Sam whined. “Like it’s not enough that we accidentally turned him human, now you have to turn him into a mini-version of you as well.”
“I don’t mind, Dean, really,” Castiel told him.

“You just…you just finish your cards and then help Sammy with his. Got it?”
“You’re a whiny emo
Dean cocked his head, looked at the way the jeans fit snug across…
It was a small bear and he was dressed in a Batman outfit.
He was stretched out on the motel bed, back against the wall. Castiel was next to him, working on a crossword puzzle.
“If that’s what you kids are calling it these days.”
“Yes, Sam?” Castiel asked, looking up at him.
“I am not cheating, Dean. I can just read your facial expressions. You are an easy read.”
“Sorry,” Sam said, though he didn’t really sound sorry. “It’s just, I love the way you ordered for him. The waitress either thinks he’s mentally disabled or like, your boyfriend.”
So Dean was surprised later, when Cas came up to him and asked, “Are you getting Batman cards again this year, Dean? It’s
So that was all settled, until Dean’s friend Charlie had pointed out what a great opportunity this could be for them.
Dean vacuumed Bobby’s house and wiped down all the surfaces he could reach and hand-washed all the good plates.
“I mean, Angels are graceful and shit, right?”
“Huh?” Dean asked. “What
Dean laughed and started bouncing on the bed. He reached over and took Castiel’s hand in his own and urged the other man to bounce with him, the bed creaking ominously under their weight.
“Uncle Bobby helped me with the picture but I did the rest at school,” Sam told him and he looked so proud of himself.
The former-angel was sitting on the edge of the bed, staring transfixed at the TV screen, a bite of nacho and cheese halfway to his mouth. Some of the cheese was falling off the chip and dribbling down the grey t-shirt he was wearing.
“I can’t leave him alone for two seconds,” Dean said and stalked over to slide his arm around Castiel’s shoulder. “Sorry, ma’am,” he drawled to the woman. “This one’s with me,” and he dragged Castiel back in the direction of the car.
Dean just scowled at him.
“Tony Stark is the king of all things,” Charlie said and Dean would have thought it was coming out of left field, except he had given Charlie the best Iron Man card in the whole box and then made sure that no one else got one like it.
“All good, Dean?”
Castiel reached out and took the chocolate and Dean felt a little flutter in his heart, even though this time their fingers didn’t even touch.
“Cas likes it,” Dean chided. “Be nice.”
“Sure, Dean,” Sam said, “he is
“LL Cool J,” Dean said, like that was the only answer Sam could possibly require.
“Sam,” Cas said quietly and slid forward to the edge of the bed. “I’ve held Dean’s soul in my hands and stitched him back together. That was an

girl – if that even – and Dean had to decide who.
John shrugged. “I dunno. But look at it this way – there will be cookies and candy and no schoolwork for like a whole hour, right? So, enjoy that.”
“I’m just…I’m just saying, it’s okay with me.”
“Other than being on the rag?” Sam replied without hesitation.
“Cas gets shotgun.”
Sam leaned forward to catch Cas’ attention. “They’ve got that
Sam glared over at Dean and then turned to the television. “What the hell is this?”
“I don’t mind wearing Dean’s clothes,” Castiel said quietly and then turned to look at himself in the mirror.
“Is the bear’s name Rupert?” Sam asked and grabbed it up in his arms.
Sam snorted and Dean glared at him.
“Like hell I am. I have a poker face, dude.”
Though, honestly, Dean was kind of surprised to realize how upset
cookies.
“Hey, Sammy,” he said and stopped his brother’s rambling about each and every Valentine’s Day card he had gotten at his school party.
“You know, like in the book.”
“Huh?” Dean asked the disappearing back of his little brother and then looked back at Cas. “Yeah, everything’s great, man,” and he pulled Castiel’s head back down to rest on his shoulder. “Everything’s great.”
“I don’t need to see that,” Sam said, grabbing his milkshake and practically running for the door.
All of Dean’s anger drains out of him in an instant in the face of the wave of disbelief that washes over him.
supposed to be the monster when humans treat one another like this? He frowns up at the second to last fluorescent light in the ceiling. It’s flickering, lending an even more desperate bleakness to the place.
Except at The Bunker.
Castiel has often admired how little Dean tries to hide his emotions. Dean feels everything, positive or negative, freely, openly, unashamed. To someone as restrained as Castiel is, it’s fascinating.
“They will pay for this,” he says solemnly, a promise to a father figure he didn’t protect and a sister he can barely look at.
“Of course.”
A gentle finger pressing to his lips stops his rambling, and Dean is torn between annoyance and gratefulness. He’s trying to

She met Mr. W and Mr. N at the little diner Mr. N worked at and where they offered free wifi. Mr. W would cuss at his laptop and make moon eyes at Mr. N, and Charlie found herself hopelessly charmed.  She told herself that was as far as it would go.
There is such raw, honest pain in Dean’s voice, such profound confusion and doubt, that Castiel finds himself speaking without his express consent.

The omega visibly hesitates, and if Dean had ears like the wolves those religious whackos think they all came from, they would perk up with eagerness.
It’s not a bad offer, even if it’s not a particularly compelling one, either. But the sight of his mom’s signature on the original contract hits Dean like a punch in the gut. His sentimentality over this, something she clearly wanted to keep intact, probably would have gotten him to sign no matter what. Getting someone as hot as Cas in his office is really just a bonus.

“Once upon a time,” and Dean will be damned if Cas’ voice isn’t suited for reading stories to little pups, “there was an omega princess. She was very beautiful, but alas, she had not met an alpha she could bond with, and was wasting away…”
Lucifer nods, eyes a little wide. “All aboard the crazy train, huh? You’re not hurt, you’re insane.”
Dean is rolling his eyes irreverently. “You’re such an asshole,” he says, but the blush that’s spread across his chest and up his neck reveals his arousal as surely as his hard, leaking cock.
“First, if this changes your mind about me staying here, it’s okay. I can be gone before Claire wakes up, or I can stick around to explain it to her. I won’t do anything… Untoward, all right?”
It’s not until years later that he learns that, as clearly as Dean’s pain called out to him, Dean heard his oath just as clearly.
Charlie blinks and looks around. Sure enough, there are a few people (Mr. W included) who have on bright green t-shirts with the word VOLUNTEER emblazoned on the back. They’re handing out tickets, numbers to pin to the leashes of the contestants, and lists of rules for the owners who have submitted their dogs.
“Truly a queen worth serving,” Dean says with a grin, his eyes dancing. “Anyone would be lucky to be but a handmaiden in your court.”
Olivia drinks bourbon.
He listens to Cas putter about but doesn’t open his eyes. Gods, but he’s
Admittedly, she’s not at her best. Her hair is thrown into a messy bun that’s actually kind of a genuine mess and not artfully tousled. Her eyeliner’s a little shaky, she knows, and she just
Not that Cas gets to do much scolding or glaring. It really sinks in for Dean in those few days that Cas is
Dean grins. He was worried, bringing a stranger (blood relation or no) into their little family, because it’s not something everyone can do, working at The Bunker. This kid, though. This kid gets it. “Good man.”
“Well, we’ll have to have an NDA drawn up, and we’d have to be discreet, but there’s no reason this marriage should interfere with our… Uh, personal lives,” Dean finishes with a wince, as if he knows how absurd it sounds.
01/24/1989
To his great surprise, it’s rather like persuading a brick wall. She plants her hand on her hips and gives him a look stern enough that he thinks even
For just a split second, she sees Mr. W, thinner, with features that could be classified as delicate, eyes sparkling at his partner. And Mr. N is almost scrawny, still with his solemn air but his eyes are twinkling back at Mr. W and his lips are tilted up at the corners.
“Naomi, please-” he tries to say.
I finish my rounds," she says imperiously.
They don’t talk much after that. Cas helps Dean to the chamber pot (which makes the alpha blush, but Cas doesn’t mention that or the scent of embarrassment, so Dean doesn’t, either). He checks the wound on Dean’s leg and declares him improved.
(Claire has a lot of opinions about grown-up talk.)
Dean comes with a shout, striping Cas’ belly and cock with white. He works himself through it, whimpering brokenly. Cas is helpless to do anything but watch reverently.
He tries to tell himself that it doesn’t matter. The chances of his past catching up to him here are slim to none, really, and what good would it do to tell them, anyway? They both have fought so hard to trust him at all, and he wants to destroy that? For what? So he can sleep easier at night? So Cas will be able to knowingly place his full trust in Dean? So that, gods willing, when they mate, they’ll both go in with their whole selves in the others’ palm?
“It was, I believe, until he came out to her.”
She looks, of course, the same. Her hair is shorter, stylish, which he should have expected. She had grey woven through her dark tresses when she took him from the orphanage, and they’re as striking as ever. Her strong features and ice blue eyes, far colder than his own have ever been, are almost enough to send him back into the past, into his dark memories.
- Poor baby Cas.
“The advantage,” Cas says, face still smushed against Dean’s skin, “of owning your own shop is that when your husband makes a life-altering decision, you can close that shop to spend the day at home with him. At home and ideally
Dean drops back onto the bed and glares at the ceiling.
“Okay,” he whispers. “Okay, Dean.”
“About some of the… Shenanigans you got up to as a kid.”
“Is this because of Cas? Because they wanted me to settle down and I didn’t settle down the way they wanted me to?”
*strolls in a month later with iced coffee* 'Sup, y'all.
Dean’s breath hitches, but Castiel’s eyes fell closed some time ago, and he can’t open them now. He has to get the rest of this out of him, express the rest of this poison from himself, and he cannot face Dean while he does so.
“First Corinthians, thirteen-four,” Mr. N says.
“You’re a ray of sunshine, Cas.”
Cas smiles wider. “I’ve grown quite fond of you, Dean Winchester, and I plan on keeping you, if that’s quite all right with you.”
Deans not stupid. He knows what he looks like, and he knows what another man’s interest looks like. He just doesn’t give a fuck. How could he? He has Cas.
Cas’ gaze is solemn, but not sparkling with hate or anger like Dean would have guessed. His hand moves from covering Dean’s mouth to tenderly cradling his jaw.
Dean clears his throat. “I, uh, I wouldn’t have hurt her, y’know.”
Naomi gives Castiel a chilly smile and folds her hands atop her desk. “James. You look well.”
Gabriel has the mask pushed up to the top of his head and is wiping tears from his eyes as if that’s not the third group of children he’s scared in the last hour. “Oh, Cassie, it’s too good. It’s too
With a deep growl, Cas surges forward until he blankets Dean’s body with his own. At the same time, he pushes a third lubed finger into the boy. Dean chokes on his next inhale, shuddering in Cas’ iron hold.
Nick sets down the silverware and raises his hands in surrender. “Yeah, yeah, all right.”
“Quite frankly, the idea of someone else biting you makes me want to tear someone’s throat out.”
Dean is aware that he has what’s probably a dopey smile on his face, but he can’t help it. The little girl is so earnest, so serious as she works out whether or not to tell him her name. He might already be a bit besotted.
“Fine. Cas said you took a semester off. You’re gonna tend bar part-time, you’ll stay with us, and we’ll figure out school when the time comes. Got that?”
Cas, too, seems to relax a fraction. His gaze softens and his scent is still cautious, but it has at least lost the sharp tinge of fear.
"Novak! Winchester!"
“Would you like me to look into him?”
So she very quietly panics and loses sleep over the next two weeks.
’,” Dean whispered in his ear.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel whispered and slid his hand across Dean’s chest, to rest over his heart.
And Castiel smiled back at him.
Dean looked over at the former-angel, who was holding aloft a potato skin wedge, little dribble of sour cream running down the side of his face.
“I, uh…my little brother wanted to eat them but I wouldn’t let him. He has a terrible sweet tooth,” Dean said, because Cas wasn’t saying anything and he suddenly felt odd and awkward.
Bobby smirked. “Well, I’m sure Caleb is enjoying that immensely.”
and Dean,” Castiel said to Sam.
“Yeah, Dad, sure. A card showing Captain America holding a heart instead of a shield is all Zach needs to completely turn his life around. Good call.”
do not need to hear this. Can’t you two behave for like two seconds?” and Sam stumbled out of the car, tugging his quilt along with him.
Dean shifted, tried to push at Castiel’s head. “Dude, come on, turn your head or something. Your mouth is like all over my neck. You’re gonna give me a hickey.”
Castiel pressed their lips together again and this time it was Dean who opened to Cas, soft and slow and completely sure.
,” and pointed upwards to the night sky.
12x06 with Emma
"Charlie told me what stuff to avoid before giving them to me, don't worry."
They heard that Sam had to go through Purgatory to get to Hell and Dean wasn’t doing well, he knew what it was like and unlike hell, it was almost guaranteed the dinner bell had rung the second Sam arrived. When they got back to the spot Sam was supposed to come back through and found the reaper dead he started to panic. How could they get him back? How was Sam gonna get out of Purgatory alive when it had taken Dean as long as it had?
So when Claire gets bitten by the werewolf Emma is absolutely at her side the whole time, she understands the fear of being a real monster and what could happen if she loses control so she’s trying to help keep Claire calm and assuring her she’ll be okay and pull through and that she can choose not to be evil and that she’ll help her adjust
Rowena thinks it’s sweet and is fond of her, not as much as she was of Oskar but far more than Crowley. They go out for lunch sometimes, and Rowena is teaching her some minor spells. There’s some things she can’t do well and others that her heritage makes her more suited for and Rowena loves the power she brings to their mini little coven, who needs the grand coven when you’ve got an Amazon in yours? Again dean not a big fan but does appreciate how much the hex bags and spells can help on hunts and that she is doing less front line hunting because as much as he doesn’t want her risking her life like that she’s too much of a Winchester to ever sit back and let her family do it without her
Her initial thoughts are too hyper, too enthusiastic, and a total doof. But he grows on her over time. And he ultimately becomes like an uncle to her. Not quite Bobby, but just as loving and willing to take her in when there’s a case. After he gets turned the two of them have some emotional talks about what the monstrous sides of them mean and who they are, if they can really choose to overcome the instincts that come with that.
“Really, I didn’t know they were still around. The Men of Letters have never found anything to suggest that they were, what sorts of powers do you have?” Henry lit up, ever the academic he wanted to know as much as possible about everything. It was why he’d been so drawn to the Men of Letters in the first place. The latter half of her statement captivated him enough that he chose not to think about how long his boy had been dead. Thinking of that was anguishing enough without thinking of how he could have died while his boys were fairly young.
Emma will occasionally take the time alone at the motels to do the laundry and she finds the old ring he used to wear, it's been rattling around the bottom of his duffle for a couple of years now and she steals it. When he notices his heart stops for a second because that ring had been his mom's, then he took it, and now it's Emma's. She wants to be like him and he hopes with everything he's got that her wanting to be like him is better than him wanting to be like his dad.
But even going human again didn’t remove the mark and its influence on Dean. And it got worse after that, almost like it had tasted the corruption it could wreak in his body and seemed like it wanted to do it again and make it stick this time. He was more violent in fights, he was more irritable, and thinking about his promise to Emma was one of the only things he could do to try and pull himself back and take back control from the mark.
“It’s good to have you back Cas.”
“It’s not really you.”
This chapter is also on Tumblr with pictures of the car here: https://scarecrowmax.tumblr.com/post/657917708102516736/pt-17-of-my-emma-lives-au-all-but-the-first
Taxi Driver rewrite with Emma, this one is more or less in line with canon with some minor adjustments.
Emma has nightmares, almost impossible to avoid in their line of work, but sometimes it felt like she had nothing but nightmares. They came in all types, reliving hunts, failing to save people by inches, dreams of who she might have been, dreams of her own death, endless possibilities of what would happen when she got to Purgatory, and the occasional one about her father as a demon- what he would have done if he’d caught her in the bunker during the cure process.
“Dean!” Cas hollered and batted at Dean’s hold on him.
. Sometimes it’s nice to kiss, even when it isn’t going anywhere.”
“It’s perfect, Sammy. I love it.”
“Would you care to play some cards? Sam taught me how to play Rummy.”
After school, Dean walked to the store and picked out a box of chocolates and a stuffed blue teddy bear. He spent all but 30 cents of his money and shoved the gifts way down in his bag so none of the guys at the garage would see them and start teasing him.
John choked then, on his own spit or beer, Dean wasn’t sure. His face turned red and he sputtered out something that may have been the word ‘
book!” but Sam’s outcry was muffled because he had shoved his face into the bear’s stomach and was rubbing it against his cheek.
When Dean made this remark to the girl who sits next to him, Sally, she pointed out that true hippies wouldn’t celebrate such a commercial holiday in the first place.
,” Dean answered and when their lips met against each other, everything else fell away.
“Nothing, no,” Sam said and shrugged. “Just checkin’. It’s cool, man. I’m happy for you then.”
“What?” Cas asked.
“Okay.”
Once Cas was gone, Dean grabbed a forkful of hash browns off the other man’s plate.
Cas stood up from the table abruptly and his chair rattled to the floor. “Dean! Are you alright? Are you hurt?”
Now Dean was just trying to understand Cas.
“Sorry, Cas, sorry. Here let me…” and Dean readjusted, let Cas turn on his side a little more. “Here, put one of your legs over my hips, like…”
“Cas, babe, I…” Dean swallows hard. “I know this sucks, but you gotta tell me what’s going on.”
It’s a strange feeling that he doesn’t know what to do with. His life and career have required a certain moral ambiguity, an apathetic attitude when it comes to taking advantage of others, using them or mooching off of their kindness. He’s never felt bad about flirting with someone and then disappearing without a trace, or faking being ill or injured to gain favor or sympathy, or using other people in any way.
“Morning,” he grunts.
side of the bargain?”
Jody Mills-Hanscum cuffs Gabe lightly on the back of his head. “We’ve been here for an hour
Right now, though, Cas is frowning down at a bag of “veggie pasta,” whatever that means. There’s a furrow between his brows as he reads over the ingredients (and, really, how many ingredients could “veggie pasta” have in it to begin with?) with an air of solemnity that would be right at home investigating crimes or slaying demons, but is a touch out of place in a grocery store.
Dean manages to generate enough paperwork to keep them both busy, but he thinks Anna’s wise to his scheme. Either she’s grateful to not be harassed every day, or she’s too nice to call him out.
Dean whimpers and Cas manages to pull his gaze away from the sight of Dean’s cock bobbing with his every movement and looks up into Dean’s eyes. A myriad of emotions dances in their green depths, lust, affection, desperation, mirth, and defiance. His complexity has always made Dean even more beautiful, and now is no exception.
and he follows their gazes silently.
Claire draws herself up and huffs. “‘M not,” she mutters. “I was only introducing myself, Papa.”
! Often becomes nonverbal for long periods of time. Docile. Minimal medication recommended.
Finally, a man had stepped into the women’s bathroom, propped the door open behind him and knelt beside her. He’d swept her long hair into capable hands and rubbed her back as she finished vomiting and shaking.
So why is the omega so suspicious? Why was there so much anger in his scent? Who hurt Castiel, and why does he think others will do the same?
His heart shudders to a stop, then starts thundering in his chest. Dean feels his own face heat in a blush. Cas chuckles a bit, and they’re mercifully interrupted by Claire waking up and calling for Cas.
“Get what?”
But Cas is here to sate Dean’s desires, and he adores it.
A snort. “‘Undesirable.’ I thought the whole ‘bond between sire and child’ thing was a myth.”
When they needed a hostess? It was a no-brainer
Honestly,
When they open the front door, five friendly faces greet them. All named after mythical creatures from the lore Cas loves and collectively dubbed The Pack by a lazy Dean, most of their dogs are too high-strung to take to work. Only The Colonel comes with them, since he’s laid-back enough to snooze on the dog bed they keep in the office for him, and he’s been registered and trained as an emotional support animal for Cas.
Claire doesn’t call him “alpha,” she calls him by his name. She’s never shied away from acknowledging his designation, whether she understands the full implications of it or not, but she doesn’t address him as such. It’s such a… Well, it’s such a
A frown that probably shouldn’t be as endearing as it is creases Cas’ brow, but he sits up next to Dean, both of them leaning against the headboard. Dean tries not to let the sight of Cas’ bare chest and the way the sheets pool around his waist distract him.
It’s okay, I’ve got you, sweetheart. I’m here.”
“Dean,” he says before he realizes he’s going to speak. “I love you.”
“I know, and I’m sorry. I think-”
Zeke doesn’t seem to hear him. “You got with that
Cas is reaching up to wrap his arms around Dean’s neck, bottle dangling from long, elegant fingers. “I am,” he admits, always bending easier when it’s just the two of them.
“Dean,” Cas says, “would you be opposed to trying this? I think we should take steps to incorporate more vegetable-based products in our diet and eliminate some of the animal-based foods.”
“you turned thirty-two this year and you’re not married. You don’t even have a long-time girlfriend.”
It’s not all pain, it rarely is once you start to get to the heart of a place. There’s the soft crackle that accompanies healing, the jarring jolt of realizations and revelations, the abrupt
Cas smiles, almost dizzy with relief. Then, because he knows how hard this is for Dean, “Thank you.”
But for the opportunity to see Dean, handsome and smart in a simple black tux, nothing about prom night would be worth Castiel's time.
“I can take care of myself,” Dean says, just a hint of a growl beneath the words. He stalks past the sheriff, unties Impala,  and swings himself up into her saddle smoothly. “You’d do well, sheriff, to keep
“Dean puts on a fundraiser for the local animal shelter every year,” Mr. N says with a soft, adoring smile on his face. “This year, we did a dog show, and our regular vet clinic graciously agreed to host it, since we spend so much time there.”
As he starts to sort through the books that have been donated in the last few weeks, putting the appropriate color sticker on the spine so he can shelve them according to genre, he lets his mind wander again to his husband and the way their life has been lately.
she asks in awe.
Dean lays a sweet kiss next to Cas’ ear, just above his jaw. “Is that what you wanted, darlin’?” he whispers. “Gods, you
That's never been Dean’s greatest strength.
Castiel stays silent, because any lie that he might offer is so entangled with what is actually the truth that it may as well be truth itself. He’s never been able to reliably lie to Dean, anyway.
None of them say a word as Anna unlocks the door and leads them down a hall, then into a room to their left where the scent of copper is strongest.
Castiel’s breathing is still too fast when he feels warm, damp huffing against his face. The Colonel nudges his cheek, whining sofly. Castiel doesn’t hesitate to bury his fingers in the thick fur and press his face against The Colonel’s shoulder. The big dog is warm and soft and infinitely comforting.
This is the opposite of a problem for Dean, except that he wishes Cas didn’t feel so on edge all the time.
“Naomi," he rasps, his voice harsh, "stop this madne-”
“An indefinite contract for Heaven’s Light Shopping Center. No raise in rent from what you’re paying now. No change in terms. No expiration date, forbearing the dissolution of Winchester Motors.”
Castiel scowls, but cannot think of anything else to say.
He won’t admit it, at least not here, but he
“The most beautiful thing to ever walk the earth,” Gabe says cheerfully.
The night is dark and crisp,though, wonderful for many reasons. It’s almost midnight as they turn down the street Gabe pointed out, but the free emotion in the air has Castiel energized, walking with a spring in his step for the first time in a very long time.
He doesn’t really have an opinion on Nick yet. He knows Dean likes him, and he trusts Dean. The new bartender seems to be friendly enough, and the rest of the team likes him.
talk about, however, is a mate.
“Well, your Papa works hard, doesn’t he?”
“I’ll have to find a way to thank you,” Dean purrs right up against Castiel’s ear. He shudders, and his pants are suddenly a bit tighter.
Winchester, Dean (N/A)
Castiel knows, though. He has seen past the (admittedly, rather lovely) mask and into the vulnerable, beautiful soul beneath.
Dean thinks fast, really just the work of a few moments. “I was on my way to visit my brother,” he explains eagerly, “he lives just off of the river. I was attacked on the way there. One of the bast- uh, sorry, one of the brigands managed to get a good shot in as I was getting away.”
“All right, all right, settle down, everyone! Let’s do one last review before we call it a night.”
or anything, but she’s in her early twenties, and they both have grey starting to show up at their temples (very attractive, she’s assured by those who fancy that particular gender).
The Bunker, Anna often thinks, is a good place.
“What is it?” The most profound emotion is coming from only one person. Castiel can feel it ringing through his bones like a struck tuning fork.
Cas shivers and comes, striping Dean’s belly in white. He somehow maintains his grace as he falls forward to collapse on top of Dean, gasping through the aftershocks.
Castiel piles the dishes and the pitcher on the tray. Dean is starting to drift when Castiel speaks.
that being able to sweet-talk a mark is a hell of a lot easier for a pretty omega than for a tall, broad alpha, even if Dean
He’s still in his own pajamas in deference to both the early hour and Cas’ comfort. It wouldn’t do to accost the poor thing fully dressed while he’s still in a nightgown.
Cas stares between the two of them for a beat before sighing. “Cut from the same cloth,” he mutters.
“Let me order lunch for everyone,” Cas says firmly. “I’d like to show my appreciation for the two of you assisting me.”
Dean kisses his temple. “Damn right. How’re you feeling?”
“Why… Why would we fight about that?”
That boy has been through quite enough, and I won’t stand by and let you take him somewhere he’ll get even more of the same.”
He tears his eyes from the omega only to have them snag on the scene behind Cas, the room he’s stepping out of. There’s a bed, but it’s small and short, even if Dean can only see the foot of it. There’s a very small chest of drawers against one wall, too. On the floor, there’s a thick pallet of blankets laid out perpendicular to the small bed.
The thing is, there aren’t a lot of people around who care about Kevin these days. In fact, it sometimes seems like no one at all cares. Not about him, or if he’s eating, or if he’s doing his homework, or if he’s warm.
“Why…” Charlie shakes her head. “Wait, why wouldn’t he just
- Hi, everyone! Sorry for the delay, holidays, you know. This is a bit short, but that's kind of how the chapter lengths fell. *shrug* I also went back and cleaned up Chapter Two, so if you're a rereader, you might notice some updates. Thanks for reading!
Cas aims a hard kick to the leg of Dean’s desk. The jolt wakes Dean up. He blinks sleepy green eyes and grins at Cas, who has to work not to find it endearing.
“Dean,” a soft, urgent voice murmurs in his ear. “If you don’t want to die, you have to drink.”
The thought gives Dean the courage he needs to meet John’s bewildered, angry gaze. “You heard me, sir,” he says softly, no need to be loud. “I’m quitting.”
Cas falls silent for a minute or so, and Dean lets him, loathe to interrupt what almost sounds like the opposite of the dismissal he was expecting.
Claire’s eyes are wide when lays them on her father, but she quietly scrambles out of Dean’s lap and darts out the door. As soon as she’s gone, Cas rounds on Dean.
Dean frowns. “Who’s Naomi?”
How he got from that, to getting caught, to Mr. N pulling him aside, to sobbing in Mr. N’s arms in a tiny office while he wailed about missing his mother, Kevin will never really understand. He knows, though, that Mr. N started letting him come in after that, started texting him about homework and new shoes and “come here for dinner, please, I’ve made far too much.” Mr. N and Mr. W introduced him to the crew at The Bunker, the people who have become his family. Mr. W helped him get his driver’s license, buy a car, and talked him through the first panic attack he had when he wanted to ask a girl out.
Dean just watches him, feeling foolish but unable to stop. He’s never even been
Today, however, he’s not thinking about Dean’s bare, glistening chest. Instead, Castiel is thinking about the hundreds of ways their plan for tomorrow could go wrong.
“Regardless of how you feel about his lifestyle,” Castiel says dryly. “He will decide with his reactions today what our next step must be.” He picks up his suitcase and tugs at Dean’s hand. “Let’s not keep him waiting.”
“Jesus,” Dean breathes, but that, too, is far away.
“We aren’t
Is it worth the risk that Cas will want nothing to do with him? Is it worth the risk of breaking the hearts of these two people who have come to mean so much to him?
When they finally part for more than a moment, Cas whispers, “I want.. I don’t want… Dean, I don’t want to sleep in Claire’s room anymore, but I don’t want you to move to the living room.”
If Cas wants him even a fraction as much as he wants Cas, then all of that other shit can wait.
It’s not that he’s whipped, per se (cue Sam’s obnoxious moose-snort, the traitorous dick) (and for that matter, cue Cas’ lecture about the patriarchy and all the sexist overtones of the term “whipped"), but it’s that Cas asks for so
frowning at an inventory book) when Colonel sits up and
- Also, this is set in the year 2015, because I wanted Dean to be pretty young, which explains both his wonky DOB in the first chapter that contained his patient chart, but also why Cas has a cell phone.
in their eyes, though it’s the first time he’s wanted the other back so badly.
Dean grins. “I’ll help you air out all that alpha stink to boot before you go to bed.”
- Hi, y'all. You may have noticed some slowdown in updates. I got the news that I'm going to be an aunt (WHAT) unexpectedly, and the pregnancy is very high risk to both baby and my sister-in-law. I'm pretty much a nervous wreck at this point, so I'm channeling all of my anxiety into fiber arts and crocheting a baby blanket instead of writing. I'm still writing a little, but updates and replies will be slower than usual for a while. Sorry, fam.
“What about when he goes back to school?”
Cas puts a gentle hand on Dean’s shoulder to keep him in place. “Shh, I’ll be fine, Dean. Rest.”
Dean shudders and closes his eyes against the mischievous heat in Cas’ gaze. He slowly releases Cas’ cock, ignoring the needy noise from the back of the omega’s throat, and slowly trails his hand down until he’s circling Cas’ entrance, already wet enough to coat the tips of Dean’s fingers.
Cas sits up a bit and smiles, because this is his next favorite part of the plan (second only to Dean).
Dean is frozen in surprise, and remains so as Cas slowly leans forward and presses an oh-so-gentle kiss on his scruffy cheek. He watches in awe as Cas flushes a bit, pink dusting his cheekbones, but meets Dean’s eyes fearlessly before he quietly gathers his supplies, bids Dean a good night, and slips out the door.
“This isn’t about the board anymore.” Dean straightens up, looks down at his father, and sees for the first time that the desk John sits at, the suit he wears, and the job he has is nothing,
Dean has taken over the majority of the cooking, delving into cookbooks from Needs Must and recipes he can find online to try to make something new every night. Cas fusses and insists it’s unnecessary, but Dean ignores him and continues to shamelessly feed his husband. Cas’ praise is music to his ears almost every night.
Dean shakes his head. His mother always told him that he let omegas get into his head too much. “Too much of your papa in you,” she’d say fondly. John Winchester always had trouble, too, with letting omegas get into scrapes, or standing by when one of them was in need of help. It’s something that’s come back to bite Dean in the ass more than once during a job, but he can’t help wanting to help an omega in distress. Never has been able to help it, either.
So it’s with a giddy, almost disbelieving smile on his face that Dean turns to press gentle kisses against Cas’ face, across the bridge of his nose and his high cheekbones, down his jaw and finally ending up at his full, smiling mouth. Cas shakes gently with raspy laughter.
It’s her family, anyway.
No one takes offense at her acidic tone, too used to her prickly demeanor. Cas just looks down at his notes again, suppresses the urge to ask again if everyone is
Look away Cas does, however. They have an essay due the next afternoon, and Dean’s ego doesn’t need more fuel ( as far as his looks go, anyway).
Bobby has been a surprisingly vital asset. The old hunter has an extensive network of people who are “in the know” about the supernatural side of things, and they provide massive amounts of information.
“I don’t think I want to ‘fix things,’ or whatever you’re talking about.” He waves vaguely. “I quit.”
Cas' words are harsh, and Dean is certain his collar was just fine, but he lets Cad push him around and "fix" it without taking it personally. Really, he thinks it's cute that Cas is nervous. Cas will sit in front of hundreds of people and play until his fingers bleed, but he's scared of walking across a stage and getting a diploma.
“Anna,” Dean says, frowning. “I don’t have anything lined up. I’ll do what I can for you, of course, but I-”
- I'm alive!
“You’re gonna be great,” Dean says when they pull apart. “You’re good at everything, Cas.”
So The Colonel sits solemnly next to Castiel, big brown eyes trained steadily on Adam.
Mary and John married for business, sure, but they ended up falling in love, anyway. She was the brilliant epicenter of their family, whimsical and romantic where John was hard and driven. When she died only a couple of years ago, it was the last time the three Winchester men were united unequivocally. It was in grief, but still.
The pup blushes and darts forward to plaster herself against Cas’ leg. She buries her little face in his pant leg and says nothing else.
“We caught one of them. One of the Lightbringers.”
A soft gasp from his left. Hester, then. She’s the youngest, only fifteen, and she hasn’t learned the advantage of keeping a good poker face yet.
the cheeky thing, and rakes his nails down Dean’s back harshly. Dean growls, overcome
Dean gets her to send it to him and he sets it as his phone’s background.
Castiel winces. “Please don’t call me that.”
“It wasn’t the first time Naomi laid a hand on me in violence, but it was by far the most severe. I kept her off of Anna until she wasn’t angry anymore, but the cost was dear. I believe she came close to killing me that night.” He reaches up to touch a faint scar on his chest almost without thinking about it.
Without moving her face from where it’s hidden against Dean’s chest, she starts babbling incoherently between sobs. Dean can’t make out much more than the words “bad dream.” He gently kisses the top of her head and makes sure to hold her closely, securely.
“Cas, I wasn’t lying to Claire. I want to stay for a while, find a way to help you in the long run.” Cas hasn’t turned around, but his head has tilted. He’s listening.
And brutality is something he long ago deadened himself to.
to be more than the angry young man he had been at sixteen. He put aside his resentment and opened his eyes to the privilege he had. He’s worked his
Dean winces. “Look, Cas, like I said, if you don’t want me sticking around now, I get it. And if…” He swallows hard. “If you hate me, I get that, too. I can go, and I have some gold that should help you out. Unless you don’t want stolen coin, which I suppose I would underst-”
If pressed, Castiel isn’t one hundred percent certain he’d be able to articulate why he finds himself back at the asylum the day after Halloween.
going off, it’s not actually on his nightstand, because it’s still in his pants, which ended up somewhere over by the door. Colonel is probably lying in the living room with his eyes glued to that same door, waiting for one of them to wake up and let him out.
“Who said it?”
Head Nurse Moseley - Dean is very sweet when he’s present with us. It is my opinion that he does not belong in so harsh a facility. No family visits since his tenth birthday.
Dean’s heart is thundering away in his chest. There’s so much to parse out. Cas’ seemingly easy acceptance, Cas’ remark about his past, the words “my alpha” on Cas’ lips. There’s just… So much.
Sam nudged Dean in the arm. “Hey, man, when I said he needed his own clothes, I didn’t mean to step on your toes or anything. I didn’t realize it was some kind of
Dean and Sam came out of the pawn shop, where Dean had been trying to find some electronics to make an EMF detector for Castiel, to find the third member of their party chatting up a hooker.
“Do you think?” Cas asked and then rotated slowly, holding his arms out.
“You better. My dad is taking us to play paintball.”
a purpose, Dean. There is always a purpose, every time our lips meet.”
“I got you something for Valentine’s Day.”
“Hmmm?”
“What?” Dean asked, but Sam was already sliding a key into his palm and walking off.
“To remind you that I love you. It’s
Dean nodded. “You know it, right?” he asked and smiled down at his friend. “You’re perfect just like this.”
Castiel turned his head up, met Dean’s eyes through wet lashes. “Alright, Dean?”
’, but yes, Cas, I do. And I don’t think that’s the reason.”
The former-angel just smiled and clasped Sam on the shoulder. “I am going to relieve myself. Do not let Dean eat my breakfast potatoes.”
“What’s its real name?” Dean asked him.
“I thought…I thought maybe the other boys might make fun of me for giving you a teddy bear.”
Dean put the teddy bear on his desk next to the pencils and the stack of Valentine’s cards. He figured he should be embarrassed by it, but for some reason he just felt warm and good. And anyways, the only person who would dare tease Dean about the teddy bear was Charlie, and he wouldn’t really mean it.
The school party was pretty lame – much as Dean had expected – but Andy’s mom made sugar cookie hearts with pink frosting that were delicious and the teacher gave them twenty minutes of free time, so it wasn’t a total waste.
“It’s cool, man,” Dean said and shrugged like it was no big deal, even though he kind of felt like he could explode from warmth and he wasn’t even sure why.
“Hello, Dean,” he said.
“I like this one,” Castiel said and pointed at the bowl of sour cream.
Cas had made it himself.
Castiel stood there for a moment, stock still and stared at Dean. Dean just crashed the bed against the wall again and made an obscene noise rise out of his chest.
“Uh, no,” Dean answered. And then, “What’cha reading?”
It took him a few minutes to find Cas on the playground. The other boy was back behind the tree-line, where they weren’t supposed to go, but sometimes they did anyways just to see if they could get away with it.
“Dude,” John said with a grin, “you should see your face right now. It’s
, this way Dean watched Cas, was a lot like the way Cas used to watch Dean,
Dean just smiled and slammed the headboard against the wall again. “Oh God, Cas, come on, baby.”
Cas was always so intent when he was reading.
“Just trying to get comfortable, Sammy.”
There was no law that said he couldn’t enjoy himself along the way.
But he was nervous and kind of excited, because he’d never done anything special for Valentine’s Day before, so when he picked Sammy up from school, he pulled the presents back out and showed them to his little brother.
“How come you want the house so clean?” Dean asked.
,” Castiel replied, but slid closer to Dean on the bed.
So much so that Cas rarely noticed Dean watching him. It didn’t escape Dean that
“He said, you like those cuddles from…” Cas started.
Dean stopped and looked at his little brother. “Yeah, I’m good, man.”
“I’m getting Spiderman cards,” Ash told them and that wasn’t really helpful either. Or surprising. Ash wore his Spiderman shirt almost every day. It was kind of gross.
“They’re called potato skins,” Dean said and pushed the plate towards Castiel. “These bowls hold the various toppings you can dip them in.”
“If you can’t eat without getting food on your clothes, then you can eat without your clothes on,” Dean said and started lifting Castiel’s shirt up and over his head.
“This is ridiculous, Sam,” Dean called out.
“What did Sam mean by a
“I was gonna, but then you did. Did we forget to teach you about sharing when you became human?” Dean asked playfully and grabbed for Castiel’s last piece of toast.
“Try ‘
Sammy had a sugar kick like nobody Dean had ever met, so the first words out of his mouth were, “Can I have a chocolate?”
“What?” Sam asked in his incredulous,
Dean just slid his arms around his friend’s back. “Go to sleep, Cas.”
“Hmmm? What’s that?” Dean asked and placed a soft kiss to the corner of Cas’ mouth.
Dean just scowled down at the stack of cards. “It’s ridiculous, Dad. There are like twenty-three kids in my class. That’s a damn lot of cards.”
,” and John raised an eyebrow at Dean so he knew that one hadn’t slipped past him, “is for someone to show him a little love.”
“Oh no, you
Dean wanted to say something really sarcastic and smart-mouthed, but he could tell it took a lot for his dad to say that, so Dean just nodded and went back to Pamela’s card.
Dean went back to his desk and put the Zeppelin card inside his math book so it wouldn’t get wrecked. He sat down then and went through his stack of cards one more time.
Dean looked down at the key, labeled 1D, and then back up at the room Sam had entered.
“I dunno. I figured I’d let my sister pick out whatever she likes and go with that,” Charlie told him.
Sam gave Dean the big puppy eyes of hurt, but still said, “I liked the bear, Dean. I think Rupert’s very nice and he’d make a good friend.”
Castiel licked his lips until they were wet and shiny and …
“Dean, your elbow is in my ribcage.”
“Or that’s what
“Would you like a chocolate?” Castiel offered him and Dean reached in and took one.
“You like The Avengers?”
.” It was a funny joke, so Dean winked at Cas during the punch line.
Cas just nodded three very quick jerky nods and said, “Okay,” before running off in the opposite direction.
“Dude, lay still or I will totally hold you down and
Sam was kind of freaking out about it, constantly apologizing and muttering about how they were all going to Hell for corrupting an Angel of the Lord.
?” he asked.
And if Dean asked Cas about it, the other boy would just be embarrassed and upset to think he had forgotten to give Dean a card.
“Don’t do that,” Dean told him. “Samantha can sew it just fine by herself.”
“Would you like another chocolate?” Castiel asked him and his voice was shaking, but he was smiling and Dean was smiling too.
“Yeah.”
“Just try it on your side.”
“It’s not that big of a deal,” Charlie said and winked over at Anna, who gave him a confused look and turned back to her friends.
“Shut it,” Sam grumbled from the front seat. “We’re all too tired to keep driving. It’s just for a few hours.”
Dean closed his eyes, tried to remember what Castiel always told Sam, whenever the younger Winchester would try to apologize or when one of them caught the former-angel feeling for where his wings used to be.
“Oh, please, Dean, please,” and Castiel was bouncing and out of breath and flushed and…
“How about you mind your own damn business, boy?” Bobby said, turning a smidge red and stomping upstairs.
“Huh,” Cas said and slid into the passenger seat.
Dean looked him up and down, noted the way the jeans clinched at the hips, the way the jacket set across his shoulders.
“Hey!” Sam objected and then flicked Dean in the side of the head. Everyone in the room knew that comment was Dean’s fault.
“You’re welcome,” Cas said and Dean didn’t miss the smile that crept across his face.
“I thought he needed a good home and nobody could love him better than you,” Dean told him.
“Dean!” Castiel hollered again and then looked at Dean pleadingly.
Or maybe it was just Dean. Maybe Cas had just always been trying to understand Dean.
“I call that one
true, since he hadn’t bought the gift specifically for Castiel, but it was close enough to the truth anyways.
“Somehow I think this is all Charlie’s influence,” Bobby grumbled, but that didn’t stop him from helping Dean out, in the end.
you lay still,” Dean told him.
Dean put on his best pout. “I said
“Dean,” he gasped out. “Oh, Dean.”
Dean was stretched out on the hood of the Impala, gazing up at the stars. Castiel was next to him, nearly pressed into his side. Only because they were big guys and there wasn’t really room on the Impala’s hood for them both.
They pulled briefly apart, Dean’s breath ghosting across Castiel’s lips, then he pushed back in again and Cas opened his mouth wider and pulled Dean’s body closer to him on the bed. His hand wandered from Dean’s thigh, up to his waistline, fingers trailing up under Dean’s t-shirt, brushing across the skin of his stomach.
Cas had a bit of cherry cream on the corner of his mouth and it looked delicious and Dean’s heart was sort of flipping and hammering in his chest.
So, they’d accidentally turned Castiel into a human. It happens. Dean wasn’t going to sweat it too much.
“Why are we watching this?”
“Take it off,” Dean said and waved his hand at Castiel’s shirt.
“Hazard of the job. Am I ruined?”
“What’s his problem?” Castiel asked and pressed up against Dean.
The longest conversation they had ever had was when Dean had stopped him outside the school and asked Cas a question about what chapter they were supposed to be reading in their history book and Cas ended up giving him an impassioned speech about how brothers had to fight against each other in the Civil War. It’d lasted nearly four minutes and Cas had been so fired up, he had started dropping the ‘
“Is everything alright with Sam?” Castiel asked. “He seems troubled.”
“Smart-mouth,” John muttered.
John took a swallow of his beer. “It’s just…it’s not…it’s not really my thing but you know, it’s a new millennium and you are of a new generation and I guess those things aren’t that big of a deal these days.”
“Man, I have no idea what you’re saying. But it’s cool, Sammy,” and Dean reached over and ruffled the younger man’s hair.
“I don’t think I can even remember their names anymore. Not their
“My mom is sending homemade sugar cookies,” Andy told them all and everyone nodded enthusiastically. Andy’s mom always made the
“It’s better than wearing Dean’s old clothes all the time, isn’t it?” Sam asked, from the other chair outside the dressing room.
“Where’s your brother?” Bobby asked.
“Watch your smelly butt,” Dean told him and shoved him over before all the Valentine’s cards fell on the floor.
Dean grinned. “See, Cas, Sam thinks you and I need some
Cas was blinking up at him. “Dean?”
Cas slid closer, settled one hand on Dean’s inner thigh and brought the other up to stroke gently across his cheek. “Remember page 251 for me, yes, Dean?”
“I can’t decide,” Dean said sullenly, because this was a hard decision to make. He looked at the teddy bear and the box of chocolates, sitting on the floor of his locker now.
For Dean.
“Yeah,
“I’m getting Last Airbender cards,” Castiel said quietly and looked surprised when Pamela offered him a high-five for that.
The End
Castiel pressed his head against Dean’s shoulder and Dean let him.
Cas looked down at the plate, disgustedly. “Can’t I have a burger?”
“Yes, Cas,
“Hey, Cas,” Dean answered and tried to step around the other boy.
Dean counted three Barbie cards, two Disney Princesses, two Twilights, three Scooby-Doos, two Pixar Cars, one Shrek, one with pirates and about seven with varying degrees of superheroes on them. When he counted, he came up short by one and it suddenly occurred to him that there wasn’t an Avatar: The Last Airbender card in there from Castiel, which he had kind of been looking forward too. Dean had all the seasons on DVD – he’d saved up for
Castiel shook his head. “Nothing. Good things. Sam said good things. It’s fine.”
He tapped Dean on the head and said, “Hey kiddo, don’t look so disgruntled about spreading love, okay?”
“It’s not. And it’s a hazard of the job. Things get ruined. We fix them. Sam’s just a whiny emo today.”
“That’s Paddington.”
Dean shrugged and waited for Bobby to fish around in the desk, pull out a small package of crackers and toss them to him.
Cas looked a little shocked, his eyes blown kind of wide and his lips slightly parted. “Like, a
“Got company coming over on Wednesday,” Bobby told him and helped him shove the vacuum back in the over-crowded closet.
“Sorry. But…don’t you think I’m a little old for this?”
Sam hugged Rupert to his chest and smiled up at his big brother. “This is the best Valentine’s Day ever!”
“Dad, seriously…”
“Look, spend a little money on something nice for a girl and she is totally going to give you some,” Charlie said, his patented smirk fully in place.
“Dean likes it,” Castiel chided. “Be nice.”
Castiel threaded his fingers through Dean’s free hand.
“Kind of like
Cas blinked up at him with wide blue eyes and Dean straddled the smaller man, leaned down and whispered in his ear. “We’re going to slam this monster into the wall together, Cas. You ready?”
“M’sorry,” Cas mumbled and shoved the rest of the chip in his mouth. More cheese dribbled onto his clothes.
“Isn’t Wednesday Valentine’s Day? Who you got comin’ over on Valentine’s Day?” Dean said with the kind of grin that usually got him whacked on the back of the head.
“What?!” Dean cried and accidentally kicked Castiel under the table.
Dean was half-surprised because they had let the Valentine conversation go as soon as the soccer ball had hit the field. And the other half-surprised because Cas
