And maybe they wake up and shower together and go out for lunch and realize that this probably counts as their first date.
It’s after that, that Cas starts a conversation with Dean for the first time.
Dean huffs, and says: “Maybe. So, what about you…?”
Most of them are gathering to share an Uber, but Cas and Dean are lucky enough to live five blocks away, so they link arms and stumble their way back to their apartment in the gentle rainfall around them.
“Ah,” Cas returns, stomach growing a little cold. He knows better than to let his brain run away imagining things, but he can’t help but think about how this man must act outside the hospital. A macho, through and through, trying to use violence to gain respect, or something equally idiotic and dripping with toxic masculinity. Cas can just imagine how he would react if he knew that Cas is trans. Maybe he’d start the next fight right then.
“Promise me,” she demands, brows knitted and lower lip pushed out.
Cas watches him for a beat, his soft-looking smile, and says: “Sure. Just let me know beforehand. Maybe I can try and make myself presentable.”
The reality is almost too much to grasp, his hands shake a little when he tries to raise them to
She laughs softly. “Thank you,” she says, “And now: Good night, Mr. Novak.”
A look up at the clock above the door tells him that it’s only a little after 5 a.m., which thankfully means there is still a lot of time left until someone will come with breakfast. The simple thought of having to sit up and move his arms and eat makes his stomach turn.
Which makes it even harder for Cas to try and deny himself these nights with Dean.
He hears giggling, and decides that maybe it’s safe to let them know he’s awake now without ruining their moment.
Dean gets so lost in the feeling of Cas above him, around him, touching him, that he almost misses the soft words Cas speaks against his skin. He hides them between kisses, mostly sweet nonsense, but Dean catches something that sounds a lot like a whisper of “So gorgeous,” and then afterwards, buried beneath a little sigh against Dean’s racing pulse, something like “God, I wished for this”.
“Yeah? Does that mean I’ll get another date after this?” Cas chuckles, leaning in for a second brief kiss.
He closes his eyes, ready to try and wait the wave of pain out, when the door to his room suddenly opens and a wave of chatter and noise enters.
Cas falls asleep to a soft murmur of “Sweet dreams, Cas,” and it feels maybe a little too intimate and important, but he’ll worry about that tomorrow.
Some wiggly-happy form of pride surges through Cas’ chest, and he starts to carefully stroke Dean’s cock and listen to the noises he makes. He doesn’t get far in testing what movements Dean enjoys, because seconds later Dean wiggles his hand into Cas’ pants and the second Cas feels his fingers, everything else fizzles away.
And then he’s out of his chair and tackling Dean to the floor, and Dean looks all kinds of confused and he opens his mouth to ask, but Cas can’t help it anymore. He kisses Dean, soft but sure, and most importantly, sober. He kisses Dean sober, for the first time in their lives, and it’s better than anything he has ever experienced.
“Fuck,” he swears, hand coming up to his head as he shuffles back from the table and stands up. “Fucking shit, that hurt.”
When Cas sits down on the bus the next day, amidst sweaty people and elbows he has to save his body from, he almost regrets promising to visit Dean without even considering how he’d get back to the hospital.
“I really like her, too,” Dean answers, smiling as he shifts to the side to allow Cas to sit down next to him. He’s not sure what makes him say the next words, maybe the warmth of Claire in his arm, maybe the softness of his heart. “I really like you, too.”
— I mean, but you were drunk, so maybe you didn’t even-”
Cas and the nurse wobble their way over towards the bathroom, where she leaves him to pee and wash his hands.
Date nine and date ten, well, Cas isn’t so sure they count as dates. Mostly they were filled with talks and kisses that have him dizzy just thinking back.
“You not the chatty type?” The man asks, a little more gruff, and that’s when Cas realizes that he spent ages staring —  without saying a single word.
Charlie was right, Cas is pretty sure this is what heaven tastes like, and he tells her so around a mouthful of cream-cheese frosting.
"Sam! Get your ass in here now!" Dean yelled out to his brother as he kept his gaze on the distended stomach of his husband. Castiel had a look of absolute shock painted across his face as he put a hand on his abdomen. Dean followed suit and placed a hand beside Cas'. There were two distinct fluttering heartbeats coming through the skin and fabric.
"My name is Castiel. My husband is out of town and I was kind of sad. He usually comes to bars when he feels similarly, so I tried it. It s not working like I thought it would." Cas admitted, taking a sip of the beer. It was cold, but bitter. Cas had only had beer one other time, and that had been solely out of nervousness. He decided it didn't taste too bad, so he took another swig.
"So, Cas and I were talking, and we decided that you two are going to be the godparents." Dean announced. Sam dropped his jaw and Charlie gasped with a smile spread across her face.
"WHAT? No! Cas!" Dean yelled, both out loud and through the bond. Naomi chuckled.
The Winchesters deal with the news.
"Thank you two so much! But, where is Dean? He told me he was getting the gift. Its been a while since he left." Castiel inquired. Dean sat up straight and smirked behind the ribbon.
"Ugh. I am huge." Cas declared, cradling his belly tenderly, but scowling at it. Dean laughed and kissed his husband.
Dean glanced in the rear view mirror and saw Cas sitting with his arms crossed over his chest in a perfect impersonation of a petulant, sulky child. Before Dean could say anything else, Castiel snapped the bond, cutting it off. Dean suddenly felt alone in his mind, something he hand't felt for nearly five months and is scared him. His eyes got blurry and his chest felt constricted. He tried to keep his eyes on the road and not crash, but he was barely successful as he pulled into the parking lot of the Walmart. Sam noticed that something was off between Dean and Cas, and he was going to get to the bottom of it. He grabbed his brother's arm and pulled him to the side.
"Dean" kiss "wake" kiss "up." Cas pleaded. Dean peeled his eyes open with extreme difficulty and looked at his lovely blue eyed angel. He tried to talk, but his throat betrayed him and closed with relief of seeing him. Dean pawed lightly at the bond, attempting to open it, but failing. Castiel touched the connection and it instantly flared open in a wonderful display of scarlet, sapphire, emerald, and magenta. Only Dean and Cas could see it, but it was an intimate feeling. They regained each other's mind, and Dean wasted no time in reclaiming the angel for himself.
"Its gonna be okay, Cas. We are going to find Dean and then you and him are going to have a pair of kids that are gong to drive me nuts, got it?" Sam scolded, smiling softly. Cas nodded his head and wiped away the tears. He grasped Sam's shoulder and stood up straight.
Everyone at the table laughed beside Dean and Cas, and Dean sighed and smacked his face. “C’mon, Cas. I’ve told you that you don’t need to tell people about that. Sorry, guys. He’s… not the best with social cues.” Castiel seemingly had an idea that he decided to roll with.
“Uh, thank you so much, but no thanks. It’s just the three of us for now, and too much business at once wouldn’t really work out. Especially from people as famous as you guys.” Sam turned it into a compliment, making Jonathan smile and look away.
"You see...we have decided to not take Castiel. However, the abominations are still a threat, so we need to be rid of them. We need to monitor Castiel without him knowing it. Hadraniel? Bring the skin walker." She said quietly. Another angel appeared besides her with a young girl who had a large smirk. "You will come with us and this will take your place. So now, cut off your bond with Castiel."
"Could you please wait until we finish before you jump each other?" Sam groaned. Castiel blushed and went back into the changing room. They ended up getting him four new shirts and two pairs of pants. Cas insisted on getting another trench coat since his would soon be too small. They got back to the bunker and immediately, Dean followed Cas to their room.
"Cas? Cas, wake up babe." Dean nudged Castiel's shoulder with his fingers, thinking the angel's face was so adorable while he slept. He didn't even think about the fact that Castiel never slept.
"Wait, you're afraid of heights?" Castiel blanched.
A drink was put into his hand, and he tossed that one back, wincing at the stronger burn in his throat, this one resembling the feeling of hot coals tumbling down his esophagus, yet it just felt so satisfyingly hurtful.
They kissed lightly before getting into the car and driving back to the bunker.
Castiel bent and pressed a final kiss to Dean's lips and then tried to get up. Dean laughed when he saw Cas struggling, but helped him up and hugged him. Castiel nuzzled into Dean's neck affectionately. Sam coughed as he saw the pair getting closer and closer.
Dean relaxed at hearing the reassuring voice and calming precense of the angel in his mind.
"Let's continue in our merry making, shall we?" Dean grinned as he took a swig of alcohol.
"Why can't I feel you?" Dean asked, his mind feeling empty. His chest began to tighten as he started to hyperventilate. Castiel looked briefly into his own mind and smiled lightly.
"Cas is starting to get a little bigger and he doesn't have any clothes that fit him any more. I almost passed out when he freaked. He is totally turning into a chick, worrying about his weight and stuff." Dean explained with a laugh. Sam chuckled and grabbed his wallet. Castiel came out from the room with a gray pair of sweatpants on, a large jacket and Dean's Led Zeppelin t-shirt. He shuffled up the stairs to the front door and turned to face the brothers.
Dean heard the squeak of a chair that Cas sat in, then the rumpling and ripping of paper. Small "thank you"s and gasps of surprise came from Cas as he opened each present. The only two that remained were the cribs. And Dean. Dean heard the chair screech against the concrete floor, like it turned around. The presents were taken away and Dean could see that he was right. Sam and Charlie stifled giggles as they looked at Dean in the pink and blue paper with the bright red bow,, but they kept it together and Cas opened the last two.
He panted. Dean immediately searched through Castiel's Grace, hoping to find out what was going on. Dean found it at the same time Cas did. They looked at each other with wide eyes and gaping mouths.
"Thank you guys. This has been a wonderful day. I think I will take Dean to our room now. Have a nice evening." Castiel said after cake and talking. Well, Dean remained still beside Cas, and he never spoke out loud through the entire party. But talking through the bond? That was different story.
"Fine, sorry. Next question. I think you have...five siblings." Dean guessed, and Castiel nodded.
"Everything is wrapped, and I am definitely NOT bringing those in here. He can go out to see them." Charlie huffed. She put her hands on her hips and looked around. "Impressive boys. Good job." Dean nearly thanked her, but he felt a stirring in the bond, which meant Castiel was waking up.
"Who's side is he on?" He asked, wanting to know more about his new friend.
"I can't, you moron. It is something a little more...personal. I was going to tell you the sex of the baby, but since you are so adamant-" Crowley started before Cas cut him off.
Dean excused, hoping to assure his new mate that he wasn't actually yelling at him.
"Hey, hot stuff. I told you I was gonna regret it if I didn't bring you home." He said, getting uncomfortably close. Cas stepped away and sneered at him.
Dean shuddered involuntarily at the nickname, and he took Castiel's hands and took him to his-their room. Now that Castiel needed sleep, the bed belonged to both of them now. They reached the room and Castiel used his Grace to close the door behind them. They got undressed until they remained only in their boxers and Dean pulled back the covers, sliding into the sheets. They wrapped their arms around each other and Cas laid his head on Dean's chest and sighed.
Cas pulled Dean to him and gave him a long kiss, giving Dean all his feelings and love through the bond, he also threw in a thank you.
"Cas, a baby shower is...well its a party that celebrates you being pregnant." Sam explained. Cas nodded with understanding.
The hunter got up and took Castiel's hands and led him to his room. Together, they laid on the mattress with Castiel in Dean's arms, as they found themselves most of the time. He laid on his chest, fingers entwined on one hand while Dean played with Castiel's hair and Castiel traced the planes of Dean's muscular chest. They were blissfully unaware of the surrounding world in that room, they only felt each other. That was, until Castiel felt another movement in his abdomen.
"After that rude comment, I may just leave. But I came all the way from Kansas to do this with you, so you better make it good. Why don't you tell us what we'll be doing today?" Dean asked, putting his hands on his hips and looking at Castiel.
As the night progressed, Castiel lost track of the number of various shots he took, but the world was beginning to get confusing, especially when he couldn't see Dean or Sam anymore. He just kept drinking whatever was put in his hand, and he was beginning to ramble to Noah.
It took far too long for the two of them to finally realize what they felt for each other, but they finally did realize this. A hunter and his angel. Or an angel and his hunter. However you looked at it, they belonged to one another. It was always the two of them.
"How much has he been sleeping?" Sam asked once he was out of the room. Dean shrugged and laughed a little.
Tan led the way out of the library, leaving behind the other men so he and Dean could get to a place to shop. This would be fun. It wasn’t often he had such a specimen of a man to dress, and he knew exactly what to put on him.
"Don't go too fast there." The man chuckled, watching Cas' throat as it worked around the liquid to get it down as quickly as he could. "I'm Noah, by the way." He said, swallowing down another comment, and Cas nodded, taking another shot, used to the way that his angelic Grace would quickly eliminate any foreign threat, such as alcohol. He had only gotten drunk that one time because of his failing powers and the use of so much liquor at once.
"Dean says 'Shut up, bitch.' And what is in the box?" Castiel asked, going to the table and opening the white box. Inside was the cake Dean picked out. It was relatively simple. It was white frosted with pink and blue swirls around the edges. In the middle, there was black icing scripted in the words 'Congradualtions Cas" Then beneath it was an additional lettering of 'I love you, babe'. Castiel turned to Dean and pulled the ribbon from his mouth to give him a brief kiss, then he replaced it.
"Sorta. Alright...I see your song as being..."Moonlight Sonata" by Beethoven." Dean asked hopefully. Castiel raised his eyebrows.
"Good morning Dean. Sam, I would appreciate if you abstained from calling me human. Please? Though, I enjoy the term 'my angel', Dean." Cas said politely between bites of cereal. Sam shrugged, and Dean blushed through the bond.
"Cas had an angelic mood swing when Charlie ate one of his Oreos." Dean explained. Sam winced jokingly.
"What else would he do? Wait around the Bat Cave for us to come home like a freaking house wife? No way. We are, of course, going to take some further precautions, but damn right we are still hunting." Dean said, putting his chin on Castiel's shoulder. Castiel nuzzled Dean's cheek affectionately.
(See the end of the chapter for
"H-How could you have known? I went off on my own." Cas mumbled, blaming himself for what had happened. If he had just gone with Dean, or been smarter about it...maybe it would not have happened.
"Well, look behind you." Sam prodded. Cas turned around with a furrowed brow, which immediately turned into one of surprise.
Dean put another chaste kiss on Castiel's lips then went to get the Sasquatch from wherever he was in the bunker.
“Yes,” Cas blurts, before Dean can stutter out more. “Yes, please, if you’re serious about this. I… I would love a shower. If you’d really take her for a bit?”
“Dean,” he says against Dean’s lips, very quiet and very gentle, and the way his warm breath brushes against Dean’s mouth has Dean shaking out of his skin with anticipation and need.
Gabe’s eyes snap up immediately, but they aren’t teasing or mean, like so often. He looks soft and genuinely happy. “Lookin’ good, little brother,” he says, raising an arm to gently punch Cas’ shoulder. “Now hop in, let’s get you home.”
“We, yes, we should,” Cas agrees, but then
The man smiles, something cocky and sure.
Fuck.
“What about you?” Cas asks, praying that he will just start talking about himself instead.
Cas looks miserable, suddenly, tired and drained, but when he looks down at his daughter, a loving smile stretches across his face.
Dean sends him a smile, genuine and wide, and nods. And that settles it.
“I want you so much,” he mumbles into the skin of Cas’ tummy, and it’s all Cas can do to pull him up and into another mind-numbing kiss.
Jo huffs next to him, and the elbow she rams into Dean’s side shoves him even closer towards where Cas is sitting on the couch by Dean’s left side.
She helps him back into his binder, congratulates him, tells him to not do any type of sport or heavy lifting for the next five weeks, to be careful and gentle with himself. And then she says goodbye, tells him to call whenever he has a question or worries or anything goes wrong. She tells him he’ll get his prescription for meds when he gets checked out, and to take three of them a day until he runs out.
“Oh, she — we haven’t had the best few days, to be honest,” Cas says softly and his hand is still gently patting her back. “Claire has been having tummy troubles, so I kind of have to keep rocking her, or she’ll start crying again. It started yesterday morning, her doc assured me that it’s nothing out of the ordinary. But she just… I can’t put her down.”
Dean’s face does the cutest things when he watches as Cas pulls out Ellen’s burgers and fries from a box.
“Sure,” Cas answers, even though something inside him is shaking and sick. He feels good about his chest now, but the scars are still there, still red and prominent, and Dean has never seen them before.
“Cas,” Dean says against his neck, breath hot and sending shivers down Cas’ spine. “Need you, hurry,
Because it can’t be. It can’t. Dean wouldn’t say he loves him. Dean doesn’t love him, doesn’t want more than this friends with benefits arrangement they have got going on. He doesn’t. Cas knows.
He grabs the blanket from the trunk and helps Dean out of the car even though he huffs about it, and then leads him over into the middle of the field and beneath a big oak tree, where he spreads the blanket.
. It means he can now hold Cas’ hand without feeling bad about it.
“You alright there, man?” His roommate asks, and when Cas can’t answer through clenched teeth, he speaks again: “Hey, are you in pain? Wait, I’m gonna call a nurse for you.”
“Well. Good!” Cas frowns and looks absolutely too adorable doing so.
And he doesn’t have to wait, since Dean’s fingers are still resting against him and start to move immediately with his plea. It’s kind of a miracle, the way Dean makes him feel and ache and want. It doesn’t take much, with the way Dean’s come is still warm on Cas’ side and the sparks Dean’s fingers are sending down his spine. A few more strokes, and Cas comes, pulsing and spasming and kissing Dean hard and biting.
Cas can tell how close he is by the way his noises are cresting, growing higher, and so he reaches between them with one hand to grab hold of Dean’s hard, leaking cock.
There’s a laugh bubbling from Cas’ throat before he knows it, and he breathes: “I really did, didn’t I?”
But at his core, it feels a little bittersweet, leaving Dean and this bubble they’ve been living in for the past days.
Cas gets a few nights a month where he can be as close to Dean as he wants, physically. And with time, it feels like they are somehow growing closer emotionally, as well.
It’s only a quarter past midnight, but all of them are
Cas tilts his head, a soft smile stretching over his lips as he looks at Dean’s gaping mouth. “No.”
And when Dean has his number, Cas’ phone vibrates on his nightstand with a text that says: “Hey there, you come here often? ;)” and Cas texts back “At least once more, tomorrow” and they both dissolve into giggles and aren’t even quite sure why they can’t stop.
“So,” Dean interrupts, clearing his throat. “So, wha-”
It takes him a while of uncoordinated blinking and thinking until he realizes where he is, why he’s here. And then the giddiness comes, sudden and overwhelming, when he looks down at his chest and there
“I will probably get to go home after my check-up today,” Cas says, and even to his own ears, his voice sounds sad.
“Heya there, roomie,” the man says, and that’s what helps Cas shake away the intensity of his deep green eyes and notice the rest of him, the split lip and the purplish bruise covering his entire cheek. One of his legs is raised on a pillow and in a chunky white cast, one wrist bandaged and an angry red scar stretches along his chest down where it’s hidden beneath the collar of the white hospital gown.
“Huh, alright,” Dean breathes in response, coughing over Benny’s snort of laughter. “Okay, but, c’mon on. Some hair pulling, right? Doin’ it doggy?”
Before he can really work himself into a haze of anger, though, a nurse comes in and interrupts his truthfully not very intimidating speech. “Good morning,” she greets them. “How can I help?”
They only have a few more hours until Cas’ doctor will visit and then hopefully only a handful more until he’ll be allowed to go home.
“Date eleven, today. Told you I’d have you as long as possible. Longer than ten dates, if you have me.” There’s the most gentle of smiles on his lips, and he leans over to press a kiss to Cas’ lips.
Dean makes a soft noise against his lips, and Cas brings his hand up as far as he can, until he can press it to Dean’s stubbly cheek, thumb stoking against his beard.
Fuck, Dean is so lost.
There are fingers dancing along the seam of his underwear and Cas briefly thinks that maybe he has never wanted anything as much as he wants Dean’s hands on his bare skin right now. He decides to take the first step, pushes his hands down to cup Dean’s dick through his underwear, and when he gives it a little squeeze, neither of them can contain their moans.
They have apple pie for desert, because Cas knows Dean too well, at this point. The last few pieces are a bit of a struggle, with Dean feeding him bites, watching with dark eyes as Cas wraps his lips around the fork. It’s charged between them. It has been charged for weeks, and both of them have a hard time holding back by now.
I really hope to see you again
Once he’s back in bed, she connects him to the IV. It’s heavenly when he feels the cool liquid rush through his veins, and he thanks the nurse more than is technically necessary. She leaves, and so does Cas’ pain, quicker than he thought possible. He sighs softly, wiggling into his pillow, and his eyes fall closed.
He and Cas matched. He liked Cas, and Cas… liked him? Cas
“Got a broken rib. ’s why they want to keep me here for a few days to make sure there won’t be any bleeding, or something. Bullshit, I tell you. I had a few broken ribs in my days, it’s never been a problem —  just had to rest a little,” he huffs, shuffling around on his bed. “Whatever, though. At least I got a good roomie, huh? We’re gonna have fun.”
He must have slept through Dean’s check-up, because when he wakes back up, Dean is sitting up, his left wrist no longer bandaged but showing angry red bruised knuckles where it lays atop the blankets.
“Not even… a little smack?”
Holy shit, I kind of really feel like a fucking dick for making that “sex accident” joke when we first met. Pls don’t hate me, I swear I’m not that much of an asshole
It’s soft, at first, just their lips gently pressing and testing. But then Cas wraps one arm around Dean’s middle, pulls him in until they fall back against the door and Dean is pressed up against him — and then it turns frantic.
He manages to keep straddling Dean while he jerks his cock, until the very last hot drop falls onto Dean’s skin, and then he collapses. He falls down on top of Dean, and this time it’s Dean who leans for in to capture Cas’ lips in a breathless kiss.
Dean can’t help it, he has to open up the pictures again. He’s staring at the rainbow covering Cas’ face when Gilda interrupts.
“We could — well, we. I mean.” He’s never been in a situation like this, never in his 26 years of life has he ever felt something like this. It’s ridiculous, because he’s only known Dean for three days. But never, ever, has anyone seemed interested in him the way Dean does. “We should, if you — want to.”
“Can I?” Dean asks carefully, watching Cas’ eyes for clues.
Fuck.
Dean has seen the guy a handful of times, mostly at Charlie’s parties or when out and about with her — it’s only been six times that Dean is aware of, actually. Not that he counted. Well. He did, maybe, count a little.
Likes good food 🍔, being outside 🍂, going for runs 🏃🏻♂️ and animals 🐶🐱🐰.
Dean starts with careful brushes down lower and lower, until he arrives where Cas is hot and pulsing and a little wet for him. His mouth finds Cas’ lips again, kisses him dizzy, while his fingers work between Cas’ legs and find his most sensitive parts.
Dean clears his throat, puts the pan down on the counter and grabs a rag to wipe away the grease from the floor while Cas puts away the bacon. “It’s okay,” Dean says, voice a little shaky. “I made breakfast. I hope… I hope that’s alright? If you wanna stay?”
Dean grumbles, and she reaches out to punch his shoulder. “Hey, ouch! Don’t hurt the patients! Rude.”
His phone buzzes again.
They are only interrupted when there’s a knock on the door, a nurse wheeling in a cart with their lunch, and all three of them are rather surprised when they notice that the clock climbed past noon while they were chatting.
“So,” Benny interjects pointedly, already raising his glass. “Never have I ever touched myself in a public space.”
As soon as possible
Cas looks up abruptly, eyes wide and smile wavering. “You — Even with Claire?”
And maybe they still leave parties, giggling and whispering. But they start kissing way before that, make their leave an hour after the party started, unashamed and hand in hand and cheered on by their friends.
Cas looks up at him through his lashes, hair rain-damp and crazy, and breathlessly asks: “Yes?”
They are only a few more blocks from Dean’s apartment, so Cas falls into a clumsy sprint, with Dean catching up and grabbing his hand in a second, fingers intertwined. He isn’t sure how they make it up the stairs of the apartment building without hurting themselves on the way, or how Dean manages to get the key into the lock with the way his hands are wobbling and shaking — but they do, and then they shed shoes and jackets and pants and stumble until they land on Dean’s mattress.
Date three is Mario Kart and Asian food at Cas’ place. Dean beats Cas a lot during the races and is very smug about it, but Cas gets his revenge by laughing over how terrible Dean is at eating with chopsticks.
“Of course. I’ll be back in a minute,” she says, and then she’s out of the room to get something.
Cas nods stiffly, once, and then forces his eyes from Dean’s face and back down to his phone, starting the first reply.
When Cas awakes the next morning, it’s slow and blurry and his head is still throbbing a little. He yawns, moves his arms above his head to stretch, and is a little surprised when his hands hit the bare wall instead of the cushioned headboard of his bed. He blinks his eyes open, slow and careful to survive the brightness of the room, and only then does he realize that he’s not in his own bed.
Ryan, 28 — blonde —
Dean nods eagerly, helping as Cas pulls off his pants and then removing Cas’ pants all the way. They are left in nothing but their boxers, Dean’s a deep red against Cas’ light blue ones, and Cas is momentarily distracted by it until Dean leans back up over him and kisses him once more.
Because those are most definitely Dean’s favorite dark blue sheets. The ones Cas fucked Dean on last night. And fuck, did he seriously fall asleep after sex? Why didn’t Dean kick him out? Because this has never happened — this should have never happened.
“No,” Cas laughs, head thrown back in a way that exposes his entire throat and makes Dean feel all weird inside.
Cas laughs again, looking a little flushed by now. “No, Dean, not even when I fuck someone from behind. I could just brush my fingers up their hips until my hands fit into the grooves of their waist, and then I’d have all the leverage I need to pull them back against me, instead.”
When Cas wakes up again, it’s to soft talk and the clattering of dishes.
He closes it behind his back and leans against the cold wall next to the glass door.
to do with the fact that, for whatever stupid reason, Dean feels all fuzzy and happy and warm around this stupid, scruffy, handsome, dark-haired and blue-eyed Cas-guy.
“Cas,” he breathes, voice rough and needy already, and then he kisses Cas again in a way that makes him forget everything else but the softness of Dean’s mouth and the line of his cock, hard and clearly outlined even through his jeans. “Jesus.”
At that, a shiver runs through Cas’ body, breath, heart and hands trembling, and only then does he realize that he’s still just holding onto Dean’s cock. He tries to focus on making this good for Dean, through the haze of pleasure that’s washing over him with every stroke of Dean’s hand. He moves his hand, lets his fingers dance over the length of Dean’s dick, lets his thumb brush through the wetness on the head.
Cas tries to keep his eyes closed, but he hears a muffled “Thank you, really. I’m so proud of you.” and what sounds like the ruffling of blankets and cloth.
“Morning,” Dean answers, soft and without making a move, hoping desperately that maybe this way Cas will just lie back down and cuddle with him a little longer. That maybe they can pretend a little longer, before he has to leave Cas’ bed and the magic of their night together. Before he has to pretend it never happened.
” and his fingers slipping into Dean’s tight heat. He’s barely up to two fingers when Dean’s hands come down to pull him out. His eyes are half-shut and his lip bitten red when he says: “Fuck me, Cas,” and then, really, all is lost.
It’s hot and heavy and involves frantically grabbing hands, tongues and high pitched moans Dean will never admit he ever made — and he never wants to stop, ever again.
It’s all a bit of a whirlwind then, her and a nurse moving towards Cas’ bed, pulling closed a curtain in the middle of the room to shield Cas from Dean’s gaze, and he couldn’t be happier about that.
Today, it’s
Cas’ answering smile is so soft, it has Dean’s heart skipping a few beats. And then he hands Claire to Dean, and it takes a few minutes of carefully shuffling her, but he eventually manages to hold that tiny squirming bundle against his chest in a way that is both safe and healthy, according to Cas.
“So you, like, you don’t like rough things?”
There’s a petite redhead next to his bed on a chair, speaking in a choked voice and sounding a little heartbroken.
He’s got Claire strapped to his chest, rocking her gently while he walks, her tiny blonde head against his chest. He has one big, broad hand on her back, the other one gripping a half-empty bottle of milk while simultaneously pushing the stroller in front of him with the hand not patting Claire’s back.
Dean wakes up groggy, but also feeling safer than ever, more content and warm and happier than he has in a very long time. It’s been a while since he last woke up in someone’s arms, but even then, it never quite felt this way.
And Dean can only nod like crazy, his hands finding their way to the hem of Cas’ shirt and starting to pull without his permission. As soon as Cas’ shirt is gone and Dean gets ready to reach for his pants, Cas’ hands interrupt. They come down on Dean’s clothed stomach, dance around to his sides and up his back. Cas is watching his face with amazement, lower lip pulled between his teeth as his fingers explore Dean’s arms, make their way back down until they catch the hem of his sweater and gingerly pull it up and over his head.
He makes air quotes with his fingers, and Dean wants to both scream and kiss him. All he actually manages to do is blink with wide eyes.
“Sure,” Cas smiles, leaning back against the headrest and enjoying the way the sun shines at his face through the window. He puts his right hand between his chest and the seatbelt carefully, to minimize the pressure. “But could you please, for the love of god, drive a little smoother. I’m not sure I could survive one of your sharp turns today.”
But before he can finish that thought, Cas steps into his space, until their chests are pressed together and their mouths are almost touching, and Dean loses all breath and brainpower.
He drops down and kisses him, and it’s a messy, uncoordinated thing, but it’s better than even their first kiss. Dean can taste his own come, can’t stop gasping for breath against Cas’ lips, still reeling from his orgasm, but he would give everything he has for this kiss to never stop.
She helps him out of his hospital gown and removes the gauze, and then he catches glances down while she explains about healing and stitches and warns him about bruising. What he sees is colorful, mostly blue and black, but it’s
Cas has barely buckled himself in when Gabe starts the car. “What do you say, shall we get Wendy’s on our way?”
loves him.
— he swipes: Like.
Dean feels a cold shiver run down his spine, in stark contrast to the fire burning across his cheeks, and he realizes that he has to get out of this kitchen before he makes even more of a fool of himself.
And as if he’s reading Dean’s mind, Cas’ fingers slip beneath the legs of Dean’s boxers, dance along his thighs, until they hold onto the fabric and carefully pull it down. As soon as the fabric slips down low enough, his cock slaps up against his stomach, accompanied by a delighted little sound from Cas.
When Cas’ doctor comes in again, Dean is turned away from them and putting his headphones in before she can even pull the curtain closed. Getting the bandages off and being cleaned a little is the same as yesterday, cold and uncomfortable, but then the drains come out and it hurts like
Cas gets up after, for the first time all alone, and walks to the bathroom and carefully cleans himself a little, uses deodorant and brushes his teeth.
“Something weird, huh? Sex accident?” His voice is teasing, and Cas really isn’t sure whether it’s mean or good-natured.
He feels a little wobbly on his legs and is very grateful for her help, because with her guidance, getting up is only half as painful as it would have been alone. She hands him the pair of sweatpants he brought so he can slip them on, conveniently figuring out that the pockets are at a height that allows him to slip both drains into them.
“Ouch,” he grumbles, holds onto the nightstand and makes his way back up.
“She mentioned I’d probably have to stay for another day, and then come back in a week to get a new cast,” Dean sighs, gently touching the scar on his chest. “I can’t believe I’ll have to live with this huge chunky thing for another three to four weeks.”
“No, I’m — I prefer soft kissing and nipping, rather than biting and sucking,” he says, and the way he does so makes Dean shiver and sink deeper into his couch cushion, hands in his lap. “No biting or spanking or hair pulling for me so far.”
They pull their collars up as high as they can to keep the cold rain from dribbling down their necks, their arms intertwined and Dean’s head dropping down to Cas’ shoulder every now and then. Dean has a moment of bright, glaring gratitude for the fact that Cas has never held back with his physical affections, because it means in all Dean’s years of quietly pining, at least he got to sit close on the couch during movie nights, clap Cas on the back and the shoulder and let his touch linger, hug him
They may even end up talking after switching off the lights, about their favorite fairy tales and Disney movies and favorite foods, and they only stop when their eyes start to droop and their voices grow tired.
“Hmm,” Dean agrees, but beneath the confidence, there seems to be a bit of worry left still.
“Dean, are you sure? This is a little much, to ask,” Cas says, as he steps towards the couch and unbuckles the straps holding Claire against his chest.

Cas carefully gets his shirt back over his head, and she pulls the curtain back open.
uses emojis. And then again, when he realizes that Cas is on Tinder and not looking for one night stands — but rather something serious?
But he can’t, can’t risk fucking up their friendship beyond repair. They have been good friends for five years, now, have even shared an apartment for a while in college. And this arrangement doesn’t seem to put a strain on their friendship at all — if anything, it feels like they are getting even closer. They share more with each other now, from random details about their days to serious things regarding work, family or friends.
. Let’s get… let’s get upstairs?”
He doesn’t even try to keep a distance between them, just lies down half on top of Dean again, one leg thrown between Dean’s, upper body and arm thrown over Dean’s chest. It should feel weird, being wrapped around each other like this, completely naked and vulnerable, but it’s bliss, being allowed to touch so much of Cas’ bare skin, being able to hold him and feel his breath against his neck.
“We’ll see,” Dean smirks. “Depends on how much you’ll kiss me after this delicious meal.”
Cas shoves his boxers down to mid-thigh, and Dean is so damn sure that he will finally get what he’s been hoping for — when Cas does even better and moves up, sinks down on top of Dean, and kisses him. He hadn’t even noticed how much he’d been wanting Cas’ lips on his own again, Cas’ tongue tracing his bottom lip, Cas’ weight against him, until the very moment he got it all.
Cas grumbles, and it’s really not what Dean was hoping to hear in response. He takes a shaky breath and prepares for a retreat, hands carefully guiding Cas away. “Sorry, Cas. I know, um, I hope this won’t change things. I
But that’s only because the guy is seriously gorgeous, and also seems to seriously hate Dean. Like, frowns and dark stares and leaving the room when Dean enters it. And that is most definitely the only reason why Dean keeps track of their meetings. It has
“See,” Cas laughs dazedly, “And I didn’t even smack your ass.”
The heat pooling in Cas’ stomach isn’t stopping, and he suddenly desperately needs to touch Dean. His fingers are already working open the button of Dean’s jeans when his lips manage to pull away and form some words: “Can I? Need to touch you.”
As soon as he swallowed and coughed his way through the burning liquor, he blurts: “Dude, seriously, never?”
His doc is telling him how to and what he needs to cover his nipples for the next week, how to clean and shower, how to react if something starts hurting, turns red or weird. She informs him how good it all looks already, when the bruising should be gone, how the stitches will dissolve and when he can start treating his scars with the balm she gives him.
He shuffles in bed, yawns and blinks open his eyes. When he looks up, Dean is looking over with a smile, holding up a fancy cupcake and saluting with it.
. This is — this is perfect.”
And then they fall into bed together and, as good as possible in their sloppy, drunk state, they fuck their brains out.
When he deepens the kiss, Dean moans against his lips, pulls him up and over him until he’s straddling his lap almost like that one memorable time on Dean’s couch. Cas spends a few minutes just enjoying sinking into the kiss and hovering above Dean before he remembers that this time, he doesn’t have to worry too much about hurting Dean, so he allows himself to sit down and kiss him again even harder.
“Just like that, yes, yes, yes,” Dean breathes after a few minutes, his cock pulsing in Cas’ hands until suddenly all his moans and panting accumulate in a low, wonderful groan and he stills, his dick jumping as he spills across Cas’ side and onto his stomach.
But Cas notices that, as well. He keeps mouthing along Dean’s cock until the very moment it truly becomes too much, until Dean’s shaking and moaning isn’t from bliss anymore, and then he moves back on top of Dean’s lap.
Dean makes a soft noise against his lips, and it’s all Cas can do to pull away and look into his eyes, green and clear and very very focused, and say: “I love you too, Dean.” And then Cas is pulled back down into another kiss.
“Yes, Mr. Winchester. You’ll be here for at least three days. We will bring your clothes and belongings in a minute.”
He thinks he knows Dean by now. But there’s still that tiny bit of worry shaking under his skin. That feeling of not looking quite like who he feels he is. Of not being quite what Dean wants him to be, expects him to be. It rears its head sometimes, but usually Dean is very good at kissing it quiet and making the feelings in Cas’ chest turn from spiky ice to blooming warmth in an instant.
It’s the best part about those nights out, to Cas, when he gets to sink into a mattress with Dean and touch him all over, kiss him as needy and messy as he always longs for, make him feel good, make him come undone.
I love you, and that I’m so unbelievably grateful you defended Gilda and I from that bigoted fuck-face. But, for heaven’s sake, Dean, I didn’t want you to get hurt for it! I thought you’d just show him out, not start a fist-fight with him and his minions of homophobia.” She takes a break, a deep and shaky breath. “I love you. Thank you for looking out for me. But promise me, you absolute moron, to n
“You good?” He asks with a grin, settling back against his blanket.
Dean just nods, eyes closed and a look of bliss on his face.
“Like, bruises?”
The last thing he hears before falling asleep is: “Told ya.”
And leaves Dean with a wildly beating heart and Claire babbling in his arms. And he has never felt better.
“Sit,” he tells Dean, who in turn just huffs another laugh but does as he’s told.
So they meet and get drunk and talk about life, most of the time. Sometimes, though, like today, they play drinking games.
Takes another look at his phone, realizes it has been ten minutes since he left.
It’s date eleven, and Cas has picked Dean up and is driving them into the woods, to the small place he found with some friends while hiking years ago. A little clearing just beside the road, where he can drive right into and Dean won’t have to walk.
— and are growing increasingly dirtier, until Charlie giggles to herself and slurs: “Never ’ve I ever — ever slapped my partner’s ass durin’ sex.”
And that’s how Cas finds himself gushing about his job as a librarian, how they end up sharing their favorite and least favorite books, movies and tv shows, The Hobbit universe, mythology,
“Not even… even a tiny lovin’ little clap? Y’know, when their ass just looks
look it was, but Dean suddenly started looking forward to seeing Cas, even just from across the room. Even just listening in on Cas’ conversations with Charlie like a creep, keeping his distance but catching glimpses.
to focus on something else, anything else.
It feels
“Yeah? Me too,” Dean replies, dazed and happy and warm.
And then he stumbles past Gilda and their lump of bread and out of the kitchen, into the hallway and further, until he reaches the patio door and slips it open to slide outside into the cool air of the evening.
Cas feels his chest burn even more, but with anger instead of pain this time. “You don’t need to baby me,” he pushes out, breathing slow so he doesn’t hurt too much. “Who do you think you are — ”
Dean smiles, something soft and not at all cocky anymore, and then he licks his lips and says: “Can I kiss you, Cas?”
Cas watches him for a bit, the glint in his eyes and flush on his cheeks, and falls impossibly harder. “Sure,” he laughs eventually, stumbling faster to match Dean’s steps. “Sure.”
“I thought… as an ode to date one,” Cas says, handing Dean his food.
“See you, bitches,” she says, and then she’s out of the room and leaves them with a smiling nurse that hands them their food and leaves, too.
The second he really sits down, he feels Dean’s budding hardness, and then Dean bucks up against him with a breathless noise.
But now it happens semi-regularly, whenever they both get drunk together — which is neither hard to plan nor rare to happen. They are in the same friend group, they both are close to Charlie, queen of parties and alcohol-fueled game nights. They get drunk together at the very least twice a month, go out and play or dance and have fun with their friends, and then instead of going their separate ways home, they end up stumbling back to one of their places together, arms almost brushing, giggling like they share a secret. Like nobody could ever guess what they were up to just by looking at them.
And there’s his face, in a small bubble — right next to Cas’.
Dean whines low in his throat, and Cas uses that moment to switch to Dean’s right nipple and let his hands wander down to pop Dean’s button and pull down his zipper, careful over the bulge in his pants. He lets his teeth graze over Dean’s nipple one more time before pulling away and moving lower, trailing his tongue along Dean’s soft stomach while his fingers tangle in his belt loops and pull his pants down over his hips.
Cas is — Cas is out of this world.
The nurse smiles at him, checking his IV and then walking to the other side of his bed. “Please remember, you can use this button to call us anytime you need something. Please don’t attempt to go to the toilet on your own, we’re here to help.”
“I just —” Dean starts, the same second Cas starts to talk, too.
“Yeah, well. Let’s talk about something nice? Tell me about your life?”
There’s something swirling in his stomach, moving lower and pulling, and Cas can feel his body starting to react to Dean’s touch, his presence, his words.
“See,” the man says, and Cas can hear the smug smile without even looking up at his face.
“Yes,” he blurts, without thinking about possible repercussions. “If you mean what I’m thinkin’ you’re meanin’, then:
Dean laughs breathlessly, mumbles: “Yeah. Told you so yesterday, but it’s still true.”
And suddenly Cas remembers the reason why he even slept over. The reason why he kept kissing Dean until they both fell asleep. He remembers thinking he misheard Dean. He remembers imagining that Dean told him he loves him — and he realizes.
Dean can’t explain what it is about men with children, especially small ones, but they do things to him.
mouth can do — without biting, or sucking bruises, or hands pulling on hair.
Dean is… so close, and so gorgeous, and looking a lot better than when he was first wheeled into the hospital room. His split lip is healing alright, the bruise on his cheek fading a little. The way the sun dances across his face, his hair looking lighter than usual, he looks so incredibly beautiful, it makes Cas ache somewhere deep down in his stomach.
“I can’t, Charlie,” Dean says eventually, voice gentle. “I can’t. I’d do it again, you know that. You’re like my little sister — but even without that, I’d have done it. It might have taken me a while, to accept myself, but I won’t ever let anyone get hurt the way I was. So, can’t make any promises.”
"I do not wish to speak with someone so inebriated. You may say something you will regret later." Cas suggested with a scowl. The man laughed and leaned forward.
"No, sugar, you shoot it all at once. You don't sip it." He grinned, and the smile seemed somewhat inviting, so Castiel swallowed the entire glass in one go, like he remembered doing years ago with Ellen Harvelle. The liquid burned his throat, but something about it was just...satisfying.
"Shh...don't worry baby, I'll take good care of you." Noah whispered into his ear, before dull teeth started to nibble on the lobe, then Noah pulled away just enough for Cas to open his mouth to respond. Instead of words, a garbled sentence came out.
"Cas, when you are done, come out and show me please?" Dean called out. He heard a grumble from behind one of the doors as it opened to reveal Castiel with the jeans on and the long sleeved polo covering his growing baby bump. Sam came from around the corner with a heap of clothing draped over one arm.
” He was determined that they could help more than one person in this bunker, and he would not let them leave until they did all they could for this strange, complicated little family.
"Alright, let's see..." Castiel clicked on the play button, and he smiled when Dean started to talk.
"Thanks. Went on a longer jog than normal. Saw you texted but didn't see what was up." Castiel said between breaths, and Dean sat down across from him.
"I've mentioned the number in my videos before, Dean. It is not something random that there is no possible way of knowing it. Yours, however, was a bit ridiculous. There are so many songs to choose from. There is no possible way to know which is your favorite." Castiel said logically, which made Dean huff.
on the top. Dean thought for a second and asked the baker if he could write something else on the cake. The baker and asked what he would like to be on it. Dean smiled and told him, causing the baker to smile as well. The cake went into the white box and Dean payed for it. He met up with Sam at the exit, and Sam had a bag that was opaque, so there was no telling what was inside. When he asled what it was, he only received a shake of the head, so, in turn, Dean did not allow Sam to see the cake he got. Seemed fair.
Dean was on edge. He knew that the ninth month of Cas' pregnancy was going to be stressful, but he had no idea how stressful. Cas was constantly lying down somewhere around the bunker, asking Dean for food through the bond. However, Dean and Sam had to redecorate one if the rooms and turn it into a nursery for the babies. That in itself was a challenge. It stemmed whole arguments.
The bed looked imposing, like it was mocking them. At least to Dean. Dean got in on the left side, sliding under the soft sheets and resting his head on the pillow. Castiel plugged in his phone, then got into bed too.
Castiel assured him. Dean felt a swell of pride in his chest and a small chuckle from Cas.
"Of course, Dean. I wouldn't think to do anything different." He promised, and they boarded the plane.
"Hello Dean." Cas said without looking away. Dean went over to the bed and put a kiss on Cas' lips.
"So, Crowley and this chick named Naomi know about the baby? Crap." Sam muttered after hearing the experience at the super market. Dean nodded.
Dean was happy.
"How do you know about the baby?! Who the hell are you?" He growled at her, raising a fist in preparation to punch her. She remained emotionless, which hinted at being an angel.
"Where did you hear about it?" Sam asked him, curious. Castiel shrugged and finished off his cereal.
episode and your end goal of changing Dean Winchester.”
“I don’t exactly know what there is to learn. The three of us are all in the same line of work, and we work together whenever possible. That’s pretty much it.” Cas shrugged. “Dean once tried to take me to a strip club.” He had once called it a den of iniquity, but had since learned about the actual name of it.
They got to the hotel, yes hotel, not a motel, Sam and Dean had a separate room from Cas and Charlie, who was going to be staying with Castiel, as well as getting him ready for the next day. Dean and Sam decided to have a small Bachelor's party between the two of them. Beers, burgers and pie were brought to the room as they enjoyed their night, until a knock came at their door. Sam furrowed his eyebrows and went to answer it.
"I'll go. And I'll cut the bond." Dean gave in. Naomi smiled cruelly and nodded at the shifter girl. She walked forward and touched Dean's arm, then stood back and began to take off her skin, turning into a perfect replica of Dean. The real Dean felt into his mind for the bond, feeling only a slight warmth, sent the strongest wave of apology and warning he could muster, then closed the bond. "It's done. I closed it. Now leave them alone."
"Don't blame yourself though, Cas. It is never the victim's fault. It's the rapist's fault for being a complete dick and waste of living space." Dean spat, letting Castiel lean on him, knowing that he needed it. "You couldn't have stopped him. He would have gotten you there one way or another, but that's because he's awful, not because of anything you did or didn't do."
"As if you really wouldn't go. This is only your second event. You went to PAX East, but you didn't go to West." Castiel teased. "But I'm glad you got that back. We have a few hours until the plane takes off, so how does leaving at 2 sound?" Castiel offered, and Dean looked at his watch. It was almost eleven and their plane left at 4:45. That sounded about right.
"Thanks Cas! We're starving!" Sam exclaimed as he dug into his pizza.
"Just leave them alone! You have me! Just leave them." Dean growled. She scoffed and ran a hand across his face.
"But Dean...what about you? This will mean that you will be nothing but a soul for thousands of years. You could...you could become just a spirit, and you will never go to Heaven." Castiel said with wide eyes as he looked up.
"You...you're, pregnant?"
“Henny, you’ve worked with us how long? We basically share the same brain. They’re totally on board, don’t worry. But please please please
"Did you ask Cas about the color?" Sam inquired as they made their way over to the check out counter with long paint rollers in tow and the supplies Cas asked for.
"Yes, that's right. But that means we're tied. I either have to get both of these right, or you have to fail on the last one." Dean sighed, then he looked at his card. "Uh...okay, birthday...I'm going with...February 12th?"
"I do not see the advantage of wearing a paper bag, Dean. It would not cover much of my body." Cas said with a confused expression. Dean laughed lightly and kissed him, no matter how much Sam grimaced, Dean didn't care. He needed Cas to know, even if he was mad, that Dean still loved him.
. Dean prodded at it mentally until it opened again, once more flooding Dean's mind with Castiel's thoughts and feelings. One of the foremost emotions was adoration.
"That is nice. I am glad that he had you when he truly needed someone. You are a good big brother. I wish I could say the same. I haven't been there for most of my family recently, especially since I started YouTube. They all think that it's weird, and after my last video that revealed my true sexuality...well, they haven't been overly supportive. I wish I could have a brother like you." Castiel looked over at Dean, and there was something in his eyes that just wasn't there before. He blinked slowly, and he took in all of Dean, his kind smile, his spattering of freckles, the way the lights in the room shone on Dean's tan skin, and he just beamed brightly, happier than he had been for a long time.
"She. Ate. My. Oreo." Cas fumed, his eyes blazing in their azure way. He wasn't quite furious yet, but Dean could tell he was on his way. Charlie widened her eyes and raised her hands in defense.
Immediately he noticed that they had gotten the wrong room.
"Hello Sam. I came in here to tell you that you should probably call Charlie back. Perhaps a baby shower would make us too happy. Can't risk it." Castiel turned to face Dean on the last words, then walked out the door again.
"Thank you, beloved." Cas responded fondly. Sam looked between the two and furrowed his brow.
The whole thing went much smoother than Dean had imagined. He did throw up once or twice, but he lived, and that was the most important part.
Cas got up and led Dean to their room, and once they got there, Cas pulled the door closed behind him and grinned widely. Cas pushed him down to the bed and leaned down to whisper in Dean's ear.
"There is something. I can feel an addition to my Grace. Almost like it is there, plus some more. It feels uncomfortable, but not painful. Dean. I don't like it. It doesn't feel right...it doesn't feel normal." Castiel admitted as he looked at his hunter with azure eyes. A pair of jade stones met them with concern and love.
"Heya Cas! We're home!" He announced. He stripped off his boots, pants and shirt and slid into the warm bed beside Castiel and wrapped his arms around his mate. Cas was still shocked slightly that he was here. Dean felt the confusion in his mind and laughed lightly. "I woke you up when I knew we were close. I drove all night so I could be back with you as soon as possible."
Text me to let me know you’re not dead. Might come and see u? Would even bring some comfort cookies. Tell me your room number
He ignores the man’s snickering when the nurse comes back with an IV bag, filled with something to lessen the pain.
He turns around, and then the words die on his tongue.
past tipsy already.
“Got into a fight with an asshole,” the man scoffs, and Cas can just imagine what type of fight it must have been. A drunken bar brawl, probably, what with it being early morning and the lilt in the man’s voice.
He has to admit, the prospect of more gruff and hyper-masculine dudes in this room is not the best, but at the same time — who is he to deny Dean? If he actually goes to the lengths of asking, it would be plain rude to say “No, I’d rather not have a few more meatheads in here”.
Things like agreeing on maybe just straight up calling it “dating” instead, things like smiling lips meeting in more desperate kisses. Things like taking care of Cas’ morning wood, and like finally showing Cas what
Dean trembles against him at a particular twist of his wrist, so Cas repeats it again and again, enjoys the way Dean shivers and shakes and gets unintelligible and pants against his mouth.
When he manages on his own, the nurse leaves again and Dean gets back in bed, his leg raised on a pillow again, crutches leaning against the bed.
“Damn, this place is great,” Dean exclaims when they make it through the thicket of trees and arrive by the small clearing.
In the aftermath, Cas slack and gasping for breath on his space on the blanket, Dean sinks down on top of him, head on Cas’ heart.
“You’re so hot,” Dean murmurs, only breaking their kisses when he mumbles praise of pants for breath. “I can’t wait to suck your dick someday.”
Also, Cas is drunk. Cas is so drunk, he feels his heart in his stomach and his chest on fire. He’s so drunk, his ears are ringing and his fingers tingling. He’s so drunk, he imagined. He must have.
“Shut up,” Cas growls, at this point not caring about being friendly anymore.
And maybe Cas sleeps over most of the time after that.
“I’m not a dog. Or invalid,” he mumbles, arranging his legs on the blanket.
Castiel, 26 — that’s
Dean huffs, and there’s a soft pink blush forming on his cheeks. “Well, yeah. Didn’t think you heard that. We, um. We were out to celebrate a friend’s birthday, and we were at this pretty cool gay bar in town, right? And it’s always been a safe space, so far, but there was this burly, all-American, bigoted asshole, hauling slurs at Charlie and Gilda when they kissed. And I just —” He breaks off, looking down at his knuckles. “I just wanted to show him out, told him to shut the fuck up. But outside, he had his posse waiting. Things escalated a little.”
“I’m Castiel,” he says, and then goes for his food. He hadn’t realized before, but he’s really really starving.
“You could always — I mean. Not that you want to, probably, but. I mean, you could visit me tomorrow,” Dean mumbles. “No, that was probably a horrible idea, you want to get out of here and not come back for as long as possible.”
“Well, I don’t!”
It squishes him, as it should, but with that, the cleaning of the scars and all the moving of his arms he did, the pain comes back and he asks for another dose of pain meds before his doc leaves again. She also helps him into one of the wide soft t-shirts he brought, and he immediately feels better, covered up.
And with the next swipe, Dean almost drops his phone.
He drinks some more, enough that the world blurs around him and he can mostly keep the hundred questions he has for Cas buried down where they are trying to make their way up his throat. He also learns way too many very, very disturbing things about both his baby brother Sam and his little sister Charlie —
It makes him hope, desperately, that the man doesn’t notice the drains or where they come from and figures things out. He doesn’t dare look up to check if he’s watching.
Cas feels like his heart might burst.
“God, you’re the best,” Dean mumbles, eyes big. “Date eleven,” he adds quietly, when Cas goes back to unwrapping his own food.
.” The words are a little slurred, and Cas’ ears still feel a little like filled with cotton from the loud music at the party, but their impact is very clear anyway.
When Cas ends up just opening and closing his mouth, for a little while, Dean helps him out by saying: “She’ll be here around twelve, before lunch.”
He pushes, and pulls, and Dean shudders apart beneath him, mumbling meaningless words into Cas’ shoulder, fingers buried in the muscles of Cas’ back. He’s pushing down against Cas, soft moans falling from his lip with every push that hits his prostate just right, rising and rising and rising.
Even when they are not twisted around each other and drunk, it feels good.
“Welcome back to the living, Cas.”
And so they slip right back into their conversation from last night, and it feels like the most natural thing.
Dean takes a deep breath, his phone still squeezed in his hand. When he looks down at it again, his breath rushes back out of him shakily. It really happened, then. Cas and him? No, it must have been a joke.
They’ve talked about Cas’ transition, that he’s been on T for a few years by now and that top surgery was his first surgery ever. About how… how he feels, with everything being the way it is. Dean knows more than anyone ever has, and Cas knows he will be gentle with him. Knows he won’t laugh about scars or wrinkle his nose or be weird about it. Or hopes so, at least.
And maybe Cas falls asleep to nap on Dean again, later that day.
He takes his time, placing licks and pecks and wet, open-mouthed kisses on the length of Dean’s cock, making him shake and whimper and wordlessly plead for more. Cas mouths down until he can pull one of Dean’s balls into his mouth, and Dean whines loud enough for Cas to pull off with a throaty chuckle. “Cas, please,” Dean murmurs, fingers brushing through Cas’ hair frantically, pleading for more, for everything Cas is willing to give.
Cas’ gentleness, he’s craving soft lips and touches and he’s desperate for Cas’ broad hands on his hips as he softly guides him into position.
That rips Cas’ attention back towards him in an instant. Is Dean asking him for his acceptance? His consent? To have friends over?
Kisses
Whenever they aren’t wearing clothes, when he’s wrapped in Dean’s arms, when they are buried in each other and nothing else matters — all he wants to do is tell Dean how much he’s loved, how much
“I’m sorry, dude, do you — Do you need help? I’d be more than happy to help, I mean, if you trust me with her, I don’t, um,” he stumbles over his words, ears surely bright red.
Cas is still smiling softly to himself when Gabe pulls up in front of him and jumps out of the car to open the passenger door for him.
“Cheers,” Cas laughs, and does the same, raising his cupcake as well.
Because that — that’s Cas. That’s Cas.
Cas laughs, watching the way Dean’s eyes are bright, his freckles even more pronounced in the sunlight. “Well, you told me exactly how you like your bacon cheeseburger several times. And even if you hadn’t, you seem to be a regular there and everyone knows your order by heart, if Ellen is to be believed.”
“Dean,” Cas breathes, and then he comes all over Dean’s lower stomach with soft, quiet whimpers and fast breathing. “God, Dean.”
That’s also when his eyes fly open and down until he can watch, can see Cas’ cock for the first time, uncut and huge where it’s sticking out from the fly of his jeans, Cas’ hand wrapped around it. “Fuck, Cas,” Dean mumbles, dazed and dizzy, and grabs to hold onto Cas’ hip, to let his other hand cup Cas’ jaw, thumb dancing along Cas’ pink bottom lip. “Shit, Cas,” again, and the way Cas stutters, gasps, has Dean wishing for a faster recovery time.
“Oh my god,” Dean sighs, opening the wrapping and taking a bite. “Oh my god, Cas, you are the
“I’m — ” he starts, then stops. “I would rather not talk about it,” he ends up saying after an awful while, and the way the man raises his eyebrow seems like he’s trying to taunt Cas.
“Dude —
And Cas gives — he finally, finally guides the head of Dean’s cock into his mouth, and Dean almost sobs when the glorious wet heat of Cas’ mouth is wrapped all around him. And then, with uttermost care, he sinks down on Dean’s dick until his head slips down Cas’ throat, until he’s buried as deep as possible.
“Okay,” Cas says softly, feeling like an asshole about how glad he is to hear the singular female pronoun. Maybe his girlfriend, then, and wouldn’t
And then it’s time for pain medication and lunch, chicken, rice and vegetables, and Cas gets up to give Dean his chicken and take half of his vegetables instead. He somehow ends up eating in the chair by Dean’s bed instead of on his own bed, and he spends his time watching Dean shovel food into his mouth and feeling way too delighted by it.
“Hm?” Dean grunts, unsure what to do and where to go.
But Cas just smiles down at him, fond and a little dazed, and Dean wishes he could tell if it’s from the alcohol or maybe actually because of him. And then Cas finally closes the distance between them again, but instead of meeting Dean where he’s already craning his head to capture Cas’ soft, chapped lips with his own again, Cas ducks down and starts peppering kisses against Dean’s jaw, makes his way down to Dean’s throat.
“He—” he breaks off with a cough, voice raw. “Hey. Hello.” He glances over to Dean’s guest with a careful smile, and she beams and waves a hand in the air as soon as their eyes meet. “I’m Cas,” he tells her with a smile.
Once the food is gone, Cas puts the plate back onto the cart next to his bed and eyes the pill-box that was left there by a nurse. There’s a big white one in there for mornings, so he takes it with a gulp of water and leans back against the bed. His doctor told him before the surgery yesterday that she’ll visit him before noon, and he honestly can’t wait.
But before he has time to react, Cas moves down, makes his way to Dean’s chest. He takes a few seconds to smile up at him, wide and a little giddy, before he wraps his lips around Dean’s left nipple, and Dean’s eyes drop closed with a moan.
Their breakfast comes soon after, and they eat together in silence.
Thank you for telling me, I’m sorry I was a little dumb about making words. I’m real happy for you! Hope you’ll still consider coming by tomorrow? 😊🤕
“That’s — That’s really, really amazing of you, to defend your friends like that. I’m sorry you got hurt like this, though,” Cas says quietly, and Dean smiles softly.
So he kisses Dean, long and deep and hard, even though he goes off-script by doing so. They don’t usually touch more than necessary after sex. They pull away, clean up, and then they call an uber and part ways.
“Fuck, Cas,” he sighs, twitching in Cas’ grasp. “I’ve been thinking about this so much.”
And that should have been a lot of work, considering that the workshop is a “Medieval Baking Class”. Yes, Dean likes baking. But… what types of desserts did they even eat, during medieval times? Is it worth the struggle of baking things if they won’t turn out tasting like Dean’s apple-cinnamon pie anyway?
“I’m Dean, by the way,” the man says, a little off-hand but with his eyes never leaving Cas. They follow when Cas carefully reaches out to grab his plate, filled with slices of bread, eggs and the honestly clumpy-looking cheese-spread Dean mentioned, and ignores the burning pull in his chest in order to gingerly pull the plate back onto his lap.
But he also knows the shape and feel of every inch of Dean’s mouth and lips now, knows the way Dean whimpers when it all gets too much and they have to take a break. Knows the way Dean feels hard against him. Knows the way Dean makes him feel, makes him ache for touch, when he hasn’t felt this way in ages — or ever, really. Knows how it feels to be scared shitless of going further, but also how comfortable and confident Dean makes him feel.
“I was very rude, and cold, in the beginning. I had certain ideas about you, I thought I figured you out right after meeting you and — I now know my first impression was wrong. I was very wrong and I’m sorry I was harsh and unfriendly because of that,” Cas says, fixing his eyes somewhere on the wall to Dean’s left.
When he unlocks the door, he gets a second message.
“I brought burgers, since you wouldn’t shut up about this place on main street?” Cas says, pulling Dean’s burger from the bag and handing it to him.
A nurse he remembers from admission rolls in a man on another hospital bed, stopping to put it against the wall by Cas’ side. The nurse speaks in a hushed tone, but the man has no such qualms. “So this is my room for the next couple of days, huh?” he asks, voice a little rough.
What the actual —
There’s a lump in Cas’ throat when he answers, because it’s been a long time since anyone ever met and got to know him with so little qualms and prejudice. “It was really nice to meet you too, Charlie.” Softer, he adds: “And I’d really like that.”
It’s hard, when his sober self is well aware of how much these shared nights are hurting him, how much stronger they make the fiery want in his stomach whenever he’s close to Dean. But it’s even harder to deny himself this, this single best thing in his life.
“Shh,” Cas breathes against his lips, and then he pulls back and gently pushes Dean back down to the bed, replaces his hands with his lips and leaves soft little kisses on Dean’s stomach, the groove of his hips. “I want to make you feel good, Dean,” he murmurs.
There’s something anxious flitting over Cas’ face, but then he takes a deep breath and says: “I would show you again, whenever you want. However you want.”
It’s not quite like he remembers, there’s no alcohol around, there are safety stickers on the edges of the coffee table, fuzzy carpets all over the floor. Chew toys on the table, baby blankets spread out on the couch. Dean knows he’s ridiculous, but it kind of melts his heart. Cas is doing so well with Claire, and Dean is weirdly proud. He remembers quite a few drunken nights of Cas sharing his worries. None of them came to be true, just as Dean assured Cas it would be.
Cas is not shoving him towards the bed once they break their kiss for air. He links their fingers again and guides Dean, eyes full of a soft adoration that makes Dean wonder, for a brief second, if maybe he’s not alone in this. But then Cas speaks again, a lot more hoarse: “Do you wanna continue this, Dean?”
Broken away from each other’s lips, Cas grows bold enough to fumble his way into Dean’s underwear and in turn gets to watch the way Dean’s head drops down against Cas’ chest with a soft groan when he first touches him without any barriers between them.
Cas sways this way and that, eyes full of something between amusement, confusion and wonder. And then he just looks at Dean bluntly, and says: “You want me to show you?”
It’s the first time he even thinks about looking for his phone, and he’s thankful to find it in arms-reach in the little bedside table beside his bed.
Cas isn’t entirely sure how or why they started this arrangement, who of them first suggested the idea.
who brought up the entire thing, what with five years of pining and the desperate and growing need to be close to Dean.
He feels Cas moving on top of him, but it takes his orgasm-muddled brain a long while to register what the sound of a zipper in the otherwise relatively quiet room might mean. But when Cas starts to shudder, his breath stuttering against Dean’s lips, when his head falls down until his temple is resting against Dean’s cheek, that’s when Dean finally realizes that Cas is touching himself.
The evening goes by faster than expected, and before he knows it, Dean is pressing wet kisses to Charlie’s, Row’s and Gilda’s cheeks in a
He knows about Dean’s past relationships now, knows about his parents and his childhood, knows about how he realized he’s bi, how involved he is in the community. He knows about his favorite things and people and music and movies. And Dean knows all those things about him too.
Cas swallows around him again, lets Dean’s cock fall from his lips but dives back down after it, licks and kisses it clean until Dean is sobbing, breaking apart with pleasure and pain,
He’s ducking down to look beneath the wooden table on the patio when he hears the glass door slide open behind him.
. There’s the distinct raise of swollen skin, but it’s flat, and Cas can’t help but tear up a little, even though most of the sight is disgusting and the scars are bright red and covered in scab.
“I want,” Cas starts, and then wonders where he was even going. He wants everything with Dean, but he’s not sure what he can ask for already.
The kiss grows heavier, hotter, but Cas has to break away in a soft moan when he feels Dean’s hard cock twitch against his thigh.
“Hm?”
Dean’s grin only grows. “So you’ve met Ellen, huh? Introduction to the family will be a lot easier now, if you have her on your side already. Seriously though, thank you so much. This is amazing,” he says, leaning closer to pluck a fry from the bag on Cas’ lap. “You’re amazing.”
“Are you happy?” she asks quietly, and Cas chokes a little on a sob and nods a heavy, smiling, tear-stained
And then, at both of their insistences, Cas gets into the car with Dean and they drive him home first.
They barely have time to get out of their shirts and underwear before Dean rolls them, maneuvers Cas on top and between his legs. Cas hides a smile in Dean’s shoulder, plays it off by pressing kisses along his hot skin, making his way up along Dean’s neck and towards his mouth.
“So,” Cas starts again, a little unsure of where he’s even going. “So you’re looking the way you are because you defended Charlie from someone?”
They keep talking while Cas packs up his stuff and his stomach grows heavier, and when the nurse comes in for Cas’ shot he feels a little sad.
And when Cas pulls a bag of food from his backpack and sees Dean’s face light up, he knows that even the drive here was worth it.
The man only snorts, reaches for the call button and presses it. “You’re not looking so okay to me, dude.”
Time races, they only get interrupted once or twice when nurses come to help them to the bathroom or one makes Cas walk up and down the hallway once, and suddenly it’s time for dinner and Dean is telling Cas about his little brother Sam and their relationship around bites of his sandwich.
Cas finds Dean sitting up, eyes fluttering open as he pulls his headphones away. He’s humming softly, and Cas feels like his whole body is tingling.
“Yeah,” Cas agrees, moving his hand until his fingers are buried in Dean’s hair. “That was — amazing.”
But he’s here, kneading the dough he and Gilda have prepared to make bread and watching Cas, across the counter, licking raspberry juice off his finger where he’s making pastries with Kevin and Charlie. He’s here and desperately focusing all his willpower on not chubbing up in his pants as Cas pulls off of his middle finger with a pop of soft pink lips.
ducks in again and kisses Dean, careful of his split lip but not quite ready to give up the giddy feeling in his chest just yet.
“Yes. Especially with Claire,” Dean smiles up at Cas, hope burning in his stomach, and then he carefully leans a little closer.
to tell him, anyway. Not like he should, but like he wants to. To get it out of the way, have Dean know. See how he reacts, if it even makes sense to feel this way, to come back tomorrow to see him. To make sure he’d still like Cas.
Date seven is meeting Dean’s brother Sam and Sam’s girlfriend Jess at a small Italian place. Cas is enamored with them, and Dean seems really happy about the way he and Sam connect over university and professors, and Jess and Cas find common ground in their love for painting.
. Well, he can clearly see some bumps beneath his gown, but he
“We should,” Dean starts, and then he ducks back down and kisses him again, longer this time, lips moving gently against Cas’. When he moves back, he shakes his head a little, grinning. “We should eat, probably, before the food goes cold entirely.”
It shouldn’t be allowed, to be this goddamn gorgeous. Someone should arrest him, or something.
It’s not a text from Gabe, like he expected.
Cas shuts off the engine and smiles, happy that Dean seems to be already enjoying this place as much as Cas himself usually does.
He moves carefully, never raising his upper arms or shoulders too high, to avoid pulling on the stitches. He eats his breakfast a little too fast, maybe, and every time he glances up, he finds Dean watching and blushing a little when caught.
Cas looks up at him with eyes so wide and blue, Dean feels dizzy. “No.”
Dean takes a step back and gestures for Gilda to take over the process of getting their dough into a decent shape.
“C’mon, dude,” Dean says into his direction, a mischievous grin on his lips. “Hurry
It’s another one of these days, today.
“I really am, yeah,” Cas breathes back.
Dean kisses him even softer than ever before when he pulls down the zipper and pushes Cas’ jeans lower on his hips. “You wanna lie down, Cas?” he asks, and Cas complies, gets off of Dean and lies down on the free space of the blanket. Dean follows as if bound to him, falls down with him until their lips connect again.
“Yeah?” Dean asks, somehow cocky and coy at the same time. “What are we gonna do about that, Cas?”
And he has a date, tomorrow night.
“Good. I’m really glad.”
That is also when Cas gets his first good look at the guy, and unfortunately finds himself a little flustered, too. He must be about Cas’ age, his hair blonde and sticking up into all different directions where he’s half-buried in his pillow, eyes an intense green Cas can’t help but notice even from the distance.
And now that his thoughts have quieted down, he can hear the sizzling of oil in a pan, can hear Dean humming a song under his breath while he cooks. While he cooks… breakfast. For… them.
Cas doesn’t want to spy or listen in, but he can’t really help overhearing them.
Dean laughs, giddy and genuine, and agrees with a nod. “That is very true. Pretty much every desert will suck now that you got a taste of Gilda and Charlie’s baking, I’m sorry.”
“That the loved ones, wanting to know how you’re doing?” Dean asks from across the room, smiling softly.
“Why… I’ve never hit someone durin’ sex? Because I never felt the urge, I guess? I’m more — more into soft touches and kissing.”
Dean has never been happier.
“Yeah, just — A second,” he says, and then, panicking at almost having been caught, he screenshots the pictures as quickly as he can and then — he swears it’s all on the shock of
Mark, 30 — dark hair and brown eyes, tons of muscles. Nope.
“I wish you the best of luck, Castiel,” she says with a last smile, and then she walks out.
Hey baby bro, figured u’d be out from under the 🔪 by now. Let me know how it went?
“Hello,” Cas says, still all gruff and deep.
She turns towards Cas, a soft smile on her lips: “Can I help you, Mr. Novak?”
His hair is ruffled like crazy, he hasn’t shaved in a while, and there is a questionable stain on his jeans on left thigh — and Dean absolutely fucking loses his mind. How in the world is this guy even real. How is he this cute when he looks like an absolute mess.
That contradiction in tone and words startles a laugh out of Cas, and subsequently jostles Dean a little on top of him. “A hundred times,” he answers, massaging Dean’s scalp. “A thousand.”
He blinks his eyes open, and the first thing he notices is the fact that his chest is feeling okay again. Not great, not painless, but okay.
Dean looks over to him, pulls a headphone from his ear and gives him a wobbly thumbs up.
“Yes.
There’s a moment in which Dean feels bad about not having touched Cas at all so far, but that only lasts until Cas’ warm breath and spit soak his boxers, make them cling to his cock. When the way Cas mouths against him makes Dean shake and shudder, silently begging for more, there’s nothing he can think about except his desperate need for Cas’ lips on his dick. Dean’s fingers slide through Cas’ hair, petting and scritching and waiting, desperately, hips raising and sinking against Cas’ mouth.
He finds Dean giggling, curled up with his hands on his stomach, still hard even through this outbreak of laughter. “Shut up,” Cas grins, reaching down to open the drawer and pull out lube and a condom, and then crawls back over Dean.
Cas takes mercy on him and interrupts him, guides him back down to his mattress with a warm palm on Dean’s shoulder. “Dean,” he says, a frown on his face. “Dean, I knew very well what I did. What we did. I’m just sorry you didn’t get… the ‘full experience’. I mean, if you wanted it.”
Dean is, for the first time in his life,
She’s wrinkling her small nose, tiny fingers grabbing and holding onto Dean’s shirt, and Dean’s heart burns in his chest. He barely notices when Cas leaves for the shower, can’t tell how much time passes until he steps back in. The fact that his hair is still damp, that he’s wearing sweatpants and a wide shirt that slips down his shoulder, shows his collar bone — that’s the only thing that manages to pull his attention from Claire for a little while.
And Dean tries so, so hard to focus on the questions and the drinking and the laughing — but at the back of his mind, he can’t stop thinking about Cas, naked and tangled in the sheets and trailing soft kisses along the column of Dean’s throat, up until his lips can reach behind his ear. About Cas, looking up at him with wide blue eyes from where he’s perched between Dean’s legs, kissing and nibbling on soft thighs, trailing his fingers down, letting them dance between the bedding and Dean’s asscheeks.
When they stop in front of his apartment complex, Cas leans all the way over the middle seat and Dean’s chunky cast and kisses him again, maybe more than once and until Charlie laughs and chucks a crumpled paper bag at their heads. “Get out,” she says, but only manages to look stern for a few seconds. “And come back soon.”
Huh. Jenny, 24 — thin and blonde and has a nice smile. Nope.
Something in Cas shakes, and again, he’s not sure whether that’s good or bad. “I think —  I’m going to sleep now, I think,” he says, trying to turn to his side to get comfortable, gasping when the burning pain increases. He sinks back down on his back, hoping that maybe he can try to sleep it away, but it feels like he’s being pulled apart and he can’t help a whimper.
Which is also why he’s currently on his way to Dean’s place from Charlie’s, Dean walking beside him just a little too fast to pretend he’s not at least a little eager for what’s to come, too.
So he gets drunk enough to ignore his sober, responsible and mature thoughts. Gets drunk enough to stop resisting Dean’s pull.
Not looking for ONS.
Cas, standing there, covered in flour and wringing his hands and looking at Dean with big blue eyes. He looks… nervous. Hopeful?
And with being stuck here, he finds himself leaning back against a cabinet and pulling out his phone.
Cas doesn’t need to be told twice, so he dives down and catches Dean’s soft lips between his own. He tastes of tequila and lime and salt, and Cas feels suddenly very drunk on more than just cheap tequila. He doesn’t move away from Dean’s lips while he moves up, swaying a little on his way, to lean on his left elbow so he can let his right hand trail down over Dean’s chest and stomach.
“Wow, Gabe, this is possibly the nicest you’ve ever been to me,” Cas laughs, setting down the bag on his seat before turning towards Gabe, who is awfully inappropriately staring at his chest. “Stop that.”
Because… now that he thinks about it, nobody has ever been as gentle with him as Cas’ short little descriptions make him sound. And Dean, he
“I twisted my ankle when I was twelve, and having to keep still and sit around was… usually not a hardship for me back then, to be honest. I enjoyed reading and painting. But even for me, it grew boring after a week. I kept hurting myself a little more and more when I tried to walk, to get out and spend time with my friends,” Cas says. “But you have so many people who care about you, it seems. I’m certain they will come by and visit and feed and entertain you. Maybe it’ll be easier then?”
“A — a few
He’s still only breathing through clenched teeth, and however much it annoys him, he has to admit defeat. “Actually, yes. I would — do you think you could give me something against the pain, please?”
Opening Dean up is a blur of moans and “
The nurse secures his bed, changes his IV, and then leaves with a flustered expression.
And Cas’ brain shuts down, so he presses his lips to Dean’s and kisses him as he shakes apart as well, coming inside of Dean with short, desperate thrusts. He doesn’t let go of Dean’s lips for a while, can’t pull back and look at him.
He’s not even by the reception when his phone buzzes in his pocket, and he rushes a little through signing everything, pocketing his prescriptions and instructions and thanking his nurses for how lovely they cared for him, before he walks out the door and pulls out his phone.
“So that fruit salad was disappointing, after Charlie’s cupcake.”
“C’mon,” Dean says again, this time a lot more breathless and a little pleading. “Kiss me.”
“Hey, there, you lazy idiot. Gonna help me get this into the oven, or what?” she asks, shoving his shoulder, and Dean startles so hard, he almost drops his phone again.
And now that Cas kisses him deep and needy and so goddamn soft, now that his jean-clad erection is pressing against Dean’s, his naked chest against Dean’s, their hearts beating against one another, he doesn’t want to let go ever again. He actually feels a lot like Cas is taking a part of him with him when he pulls back, but Dean thankfully manages to only make a tiny sad noise while he watches Cas sink back down between his legs.
When Cas wakes up again, there’s sunlight tentatively streaming through the window to his right.
But during the past few weeks it has also gotten harder to not just jump into Dean’s arms in public once he’s drunk enough. To not kiss him in front of all their friends. To not lean over and whisper “Come on, let’s get out of here,“ barely an hour after the party began.
“Yes. And maybe I could give you my number, so you can text me when you feel ready for a visitor?”
And, thank whatever god is around and listening, Cas
and stumbles out of their apartment with the rest of his friends, all of them scattering out into the night in small groups.
“Sorry,” he says, rushing forward to pick up the bacon. Dean just stands back and watches, something on his face suddenly closed off. “Didn’t mean to startle you.”
Cas trips out of bed faster than ever, and has another brief panic trying to decide if he should put on more than his boxers to join Dean in the kitchen. He decides on pulling on his jeans as well, but leaving the rest of his clothes wherever they have been tossed last night, and pads out through the hall and into the kitchen on bare feet.
When he gets back out, there’s a nurse finishing up on giving Dean his daily thrombosis shot. He’s out of his hospital gown now, too, wearing a thread-bare ACDC shirt and basketball shorts with legs so wide he managed to fit them over his cast. The nurse is helping him out of bed after the shot, showing him how to use his crutches and hobble around the room on one leg. It’s hard for him with his hurt hand and ribs, and every time he winces, Cas just wants to rush over and help him back to bed against all his better judgement.
“Awesome,” Dean sighs, burying his face against Cas’ skin.
“Cas,” he mumbles, dizzy and warm and tingly and so in love.
“Gosh, guys, I’m so sorry! I promised Gilda to be home for lunch, I’ll leave you to it,” Charlie babbles, and then she gets up and leans down to press a kiss to a grumpy looking Dean’s forehead. She gathers her bags, moves over to Cas’ bed too, looking at him with a careful but very bright smile. “Cas, it was so nice to meet you. Maybe we’ll see each other again?”
“Come on, Charles,” Dean says again. “You promised me one of Gilda’s heavenly chocolate cupcakes. Pay up.”
Cas is walking by again this morning, and Dean just stepped outside to grab his mail, still in his pajamas on this fine Saturday. And now he’s standing and staring, again, he knows he is. But there, across the lawn, is Cas. Castiel Novak, single parenting a seven-month-old girl named Claire seemingly like he was made for it.
“I think I’ll miss you,” Dean blurts, and he looks as surprised that he said this as Cas feels. His cheeks are pink and he babbles on quickly, seemingly wanting to distract from his words. “Well, then. You didn’t give me an answer yesterday, about apple pie. What’s your favorite type of desert? Will I ever get an answer?”
Every other week, Charlie and Gilda and Row, Jo, Garth and Kevin, Benny, Chuck, Sam, Dean and Cas get together to get drunk — or, depending on preferences, high. They meet up and sit around the apartment of the week, though honestly most of the time it’s Charlie, Gilda and Row’s, simply because their place has the biggest living room. And also because Row is very particular about having their place stocked with good drinks at all times, which… is another big advantage.
“No — it’s,” Cas takes a carefully flat breath. “I’m okay.”
“Sure,” Cas says, blinking hard to keep his eyes open. He climbs off of Dean, drops his jeans and underwear to the floor and makes quick work of switching off the lights, padding through the dark room and climbing back to bed.
His eyes are pressed shut during it, but then they flutter open again and reveal something wild. “Fuck, Cas, sorry. Didn’t even consider,” he slurs, nodding down towards Cas’ stomach.
Date five was supposed to be a Scrabble night but ends in a lot of kissing on Dean’s couch and a few Scrabble letters poking Cas’ ass when he ends up sitting on the table between Dean’s spread legs, hands in Dean’s hair.
It takes Dean almost a minute of very embarrassing staring and gasping as he desperately tries to figure out whether Cas is joking and making fun of him or actually, seriously, earnestly propositioning him right now. He notices, through all the gaping and the haze of alcohol, that Cas’ cocky smile slowly falls away and turns a little anxious — and he just can’t have that.
“So are you,” Cas murmurs, and Dean pulls the fry back from where it was on its way to his mouth and blinks up at him from under dark lashes.
Cas tries not to laugh, but what he ends up with is a little snort, and slowly raises his arm to take the cupcake from her. “Thank you, then! And Dean, you’re welcome. It sounds like I’m doing your arteries a service.”
“Mhm,” Dean answers, voice a little cocky. “So you’d try that again, with me?”
And he looks so worried, almost a little broken, as he says it. It makes something in Dean flare up protectively. “No,” he says, a lot more certain than he feels. “No, not an accident, Cas. What about you?”
God, this guy is ridiculously cute.
Tonight, Cas kisses Dean until he grows soft and slips out of him on his own. Tonight, Cas stays draped over Dean, buried in the softness of his skin. Tonight, ignoring the fuzz of alcohol on their tongues and the sweat and sticky come covering their bodies, they fall asleep in each other’s arms.
And then the man even dares to speak up again, and Cas sees red. “My roomie there is in pain. Didn’t allow himself to call for help.”
. He yawns, drops his head and buries his face in Dean’s neck. He spends a while like that, breathing against Dean’s skin while Dean desperately tries to will his racing heart to slow down. Eventually he softly murmurs something, lips moving against Dean’s pulse point and somehow both tickling him and making him desperate to arch up and demand more.
Dean clicks back to read Cas’ bio.
Hannah, 25 — red hair, green eyes — Nope.
“A lot,” Cas promises, and then laughs when Dean sends him a satisfied nod and dives into his burger.
Mostly, though, it has gotten harder to hold back all the sweet nothings and compliments and words of adoration he wants to share with Dean.
There’s a twinkle in Dean’s eyes when he leans over the edge of his bed to grab his phone from his nightstand. “I’m ready, tell me.”
“Do you…” Dean starts, voice shaking a little. “How do you feel about taking our shirts off?”
Cas helps and sits up, waits until Dean has his shirt pulled off of him entirely before sinking back down. Dean’s eyes are soft and wide when he casts them over Cas’ face, down his neck and over his chest, his stomach. Before Cas can even decide how he feels about it, Dean’s ducking down and peppering whispers of kisses all along the path his eyes drew earlier. When he reaches Cas’ chest he’s especially gentle, and Cas’ heart sings.
Cas wakes up before Dean the next day, and he bathes in the long minutes he gets to look at him unabashedly, taking in his tousled hair, long lashes fanned on his cheeks, lips soft and slightly open.
And Dean tries to catch his breath for all but ten seconds, before he realizes there are more important things. Things like pulling Cas down and kissing him soft and gentle, morning breath be damned. Things like wrapping Cas in his arms and telling him: “Yes. Whenever, however. As many times as you want.”
?” There’s a shrill tone in his voice that has Charlie falling off the headrest of the lounge chair and right into Row’s lap with laughter.
“Hey, Cas?” he says, blinking up at him. There’s a weird, sad little crease between his eyes, and Cas already knows what’s going to come, so he trains his eyes on his plate and just nods. “I wanna say that I’m sorry. I didn’t — I didn’t mean to slip up like that. I know you… I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable. I’m so sorry.” His voice is breaking a little, and Cas’ head flies up to catch his eyes, glassy and unfocused. “I’d understand if you wanna — end things? I know you’re not, like, feeling —”
So he has his bag carefully slung over his shoulder, his nurse already outside and waiting to guide him out, when he looks at Dean, and his way too adorable smile, and says, a little like ripping off a bandaid: “Top surgery, is why I was in. I’m trans.”
He spreads the food between them and then settles across from Dean, who’s blushing a delightful pink, and starts to open the tupper boxes one after the other.
“Was this — Sorry, um, I wasn’t sure if this… Was it an accident, on your part?”
Then, with a soft smile and blinking up at him with knowing blue eyes, he wraps one hand around the base of Dean’s cock and gives his head, red, pulsing and leaking steadily, a careful little lick. It’s so goddamn gentle, barely even a touch, but after all this teasing it has Dean’s legs twitching in shocked pleasure where they are laid out around Cas. Cas grins up at him, and then starts leaving soft licks up and all around Dean’s dick.
“Good night, Dean. Thank you. I really like you too.”,“ Cas murmurs, and then he closes his eyes and dozes off in a heartbeat.
They’ve been through quite a few rounds and two bottles of Row’s fancy tequila by now, had to switch to vodka a few minutes ago, and the questions are straying away from sneaky secrets they know about each other —
He shoves his phone into his pocket, tips his head back against the wall and takes another deep breath. It must have been a minute or two, already. He waits with his hands clenched to fists by his sides, watching the world dim around him as the last rays of sun disappear.
He only gets them up to a 90 degree angle when pain shoots through his chest, the strain of raising his arms pulling on tender skin and muscle-tissue. He bites down on his lower lip to quiet his whimper, carefully putting his arms back down onto the mattress again. He takes a few breaths, not too deep because that just makes his chest feel like it’s being pulled apart, ignores the stinging smell of disinfectant and curls his fingers into the bedding.
Cas is on his way up the stairs when his phone buzzes.
Good morning, dear, hope you’re all right? I met the loveliest ladies last night, tell me if you feel up to listening to my chatter and I’ll come by?
He watches until Cas’ deep breaths start to grow a little irregular, until Cas’ fingers twitch against where they are wrapped around Dean’s upper arm. But he doesn’t avert his eyes when Cas blinks his own eyes open, when he looks up at Dean with soft surprise. He clears his throat, raises his head from Dean’s chest — and Dean already misses his touch, his warmth. “Morning,” Cas rasps, voice full of sleep and something like wonder.
. He looks fucking gorgeous in his first picture, wearing a black shirt and a jean jacket, smiling into the camera all soft and friendly.
Dean snorts a little at the crazy amount of emojis, then feels his heart do a stupid little jump when he realizes that
“Hey, Cas,” he says, rubbing the throbbing spot on his head one last time before dropping his hand back to his side.
“…I think there’s flax in my asscrack,” Dean mumbles.
Cas has long abandoned the film for more interesting things. He runs fingers through Dean’s hair and marvels at the nebulae of freckles that cluster on his shoulders, scratches through the short hairs on his jaw. Dean grins and playfully nips at his wrist, never looking away from the screen. He is lovely and unguarded and Castiel is suddenly, overwhelmingly aware that he’s stumbled into a great love without even trying. That Dean knows him in every way there is to know another person. That he loves him
The concrete is hard under his knees and it smells like gasoline and fries—and, more immediately, the funk of unwashed crotch. The john shoves forward and Dean chokes around his mouthful, swallowing and making an attempt to better open his throat. He’s drooling and there are tears in his eyes, but there’s an edge to the biting humiliation that’s not so bad. It makes him feel kinda—good. Powerful.
Century.
. He’s still a little flushed from the shower—shared earlier, with water pressure to die for—and freshly shaven. His damp hair curls against his forehead.
“Fuck, I knew you were a slut the minute I laid eyes on you. You need it, huh?”
Cas grins back. “No, I’m not.”
“Baby,” Dean murmurs. He takes Cas’s face in his hands. Presses a sweet kiss to his lips. “Sometimes, it just happens like this. Sometimes, sex is a disaster—which, by the way, this wasn’t. Remember that Xarthusian?
Dean swallows thickly. “M’relaxed.”
“Marry me.”
“Mm.”
The box of flax multigrain cereal is his last hope.
By the time they reach the boulder, Cas is sure he’s less than presentable, but there’s no time; he dismounts, hastily pawing at his hair, pulling at his clothes and —
Dean snorts but obliges, mumbling about finding a spot in town. Cas nods and shoves a hand down the back of his boxers. Hums. Squeezes. The ring sits heavy on his finger and he can’t stop himself from grinning.
“Happy new year.”
Castiel reaches up to clutch at the glowing light blue stone underneath his shirt. Those credits would be the first of many things he gave Dean. With time, Cas would give him his hands, his mind… his heart, first a thing borne of admiration and loyalty, then turned soft and sweet with affection. Castiel’s heart—his friendship, his love—is the most precious thing he thinks he has ever owned. He thinks, maybe, that it is the most precious thing any person owns, and so to receive it is an honour beyond honours. He thinks, too, that for all its importance, a heart is laughably easy to give away.
. Before she can turn on her camera. But Dean would recognize Sam’s dumb, loping stride anywhere, so he’s off like a fucking rocket, turning on the camp stove, starting coffee in the camp stove. All their gear is laid out ready to go, but Dean checks it once, twice, three times anyway. Makes sure their snacks are out and there’s enough room for them to sit and rest for as long as they need.
“Is that a question?”
He presses a fuckin’ embarrassing little kiss to the tip of Dean’s cock, head pillowed on his freckled thigh as he grins and presses a kiss there, too. Still heaving from his orgasm, Dean throws an arm over his face amid a stuttered breath. “Jesus,” he mumbles.
It’s one of those nights; when Cas’s blood races and he
“Run away with me.”
It’s a new fuckin’ millennium. Or it’s gonna be, in—two hours. Dean snorts into his whiskey: the year 2000. Shouldn’t there be… flying cars by now, or something? A chip that downloads all knowledge directly into your brain? A robot that follows you around and feeds you snacks?
Dean barely manages to raise his hips enough to help Cas get his jeans down his legs before the way Cas is looking up at him through his lashes makes him sit up and catch Cas’ lips in another heated kiss. “Cas,” he breathes against his mouth, not really sure where he’s going, but he feels like he’s bursting with things he wants to say.
And Cas smells so familiar, so comforting, so perfect, Dean’s head gets all cloudy again. And that’s when the words tumble out of his mouth, only a block left until they are back home: “So, Cas. Really. You — um, never had rough sex, huh? How’s that... going?”
“She really likes you,” Cas whispers, looking down at where Claire is sleeping in Dean’s arms. “I’m impressed.”
They stay outside until they grow cold, talking and laughing and, a few more memorable times, kissing.
Dean sings along to the songs Cas’ favorite 80s radio station is playing, loud and enthusiastic, his head back against the headrest, and the sun is shining through the windows and lighting him up.
He’s scraping the last eggs off his plate, throat closing in a way that makes him feel like he’s gonna choke if he takes one more bite, thinking about how to best make his way out of this situation without making Dean regret ever even taking him home — when Dean interrupts his thoughts.
Dean pointed to where he was staring- he pointed to the pacifier. “I… I didn’t know if I could get it myself, Daddy.”
The two finished their meal and started to walk hand-in-hand to their room. Dean gave Ellen a small wave and a quite "thank you, ma'am," as they left. As they rounded the corner to the ODT offices, they ran directly into Gabe.
He walked into the room and sat down heavily in the chair. D turned over to face him with his brow furrowed. "D, I think you are a man that appreciates honesty." There was no response. So, Castiel figured he would keep talking until D growled, snarled, or screamed. "I know I do... D, you're in some serious trouble with your health."
As the alpha allowed muscle memory to take him through the motions, he closed his eyes and enjoyed the sounds of Dean's quiet humming and occasional splash. Before he knew it, he was rinsing his hair and joining in with Dean's wordless rendition of When the Levee Breaks. The knowledge that he was in his omega's presence and that neither of them were in danger allowed a weight to be lifted from Castiel's shoulders. It really felt like it was easier to breathe. For the first time in five weeks, he felt truly happy and relaxed.
News of Dean's "first words" spread like wildfire around the corridors of the hospital. When Castiel walked to get a drink from the vending machine during the night (which was less than five hours after Dean spoke, mind you,) he could feel eyes on him. He heard hushed tones and sounds of awe as he made his way to his destination. Apparently, this was big deal to everyone in the hospital.
Cas hummed in acknowledgement. "Can I do anything to help? Would you rather do an online checklist? It's less personal. That has its own pros and cons."
"Fair point." Dean took Cas' hand in his. "I can't wait for you to be able to smell me. I mean, I get that you like me and everything, but man, it is a totally different kind of experience. It's like... I don't know how to put it into words. I just know that for once in my life that I have what I need."
Cas knew that the trial was just over the horizon. Three days away. The trial would last a while, but this? This perfect omega warming his bed and filling an emptiness that he didn't know existed? That was for the rest of their lives. He could deal with the worries of the trial for a few weeks. This was a a war worth fighting. This was his Dean. This was his best. His best life, his best friend, his best future.
Dean rolled his hips. Neither of them were hard, considering all of the emotions they had been focused on earlier. Regardless, it felt fantastic. "Mhmm." He bent down and sucked Cas's earlobe between his teeth. "That happens when your True Mate makes everything better. You want to thank them..." He rolled his hips slower and harder. "Properly."
"Wonderful. Would you like to ask the questions or answer them first?"
Castiel would have never guessed that Sam's family was well off considering the too-big suit he fashioned at their previous meetings and his run-down car. He admired Sam for his integrity and work ethic, but also felt elation that Sam wanted to know about his family as much as Dean did.
“I know you hate it, but—“
"I'm aware." It was obvious to Dean that Cas was not going to help him at all. So, he lifted himself one more time before lowering himself all the way onto the silicone cock beneath him.
He smiled at the thought. As Dean opened the door, he dropped his lunchbox on the floor and unlaced his work boots. As he stood, he flung his over shirt into the living room. "Honey, I'm home."
Dean clapped Sam on the shoulder and steered them to the building. "Bought her yourself, huh?"
"You foiled my plan. Fine. Well, before I left home for that date, Gabe met me outside. He lived a couple of houses down from us growing up. He asked me a lot of questions about the date and the girl and his last question was 'do you have protection?'"
Dean moved his head slowly up and down and watched in rapture as Daddy came all over his back. It was so hot, Dean thought he may have some red marks after this from the heat of it all. It felt like Daddy was branding him with his cum. It eventually registered with Dean that the timer was going off. Daddy closed it and threw the phone onto the chair in the corner. “How did it feel for Daddy to cum on you and you had to lay there like a good boy?”
Cas chuckled. “Yes, my prince his right here.” He laid down beside Dean and pulled him into his chest. “Tell me what you did today, baby.”
Dean stood up and stepped over Castiel. The alpha wasn't sure what he should do at this point, so he stood as well and leaned against the wall. Cas watched Dean and his heart broke for him more and more as the omega continued to let out his anger.
When Cas tried to let Dean go, the younger man grabbed his wrist and rubbed it along his neck. "Wanna smell like you. New place."
Dean laid in Cas’ bed and closed his eyes. Thank goodness the power was back on. He wouldn’t be able to enjoy his current position if it weren’t. He had on his boxers and Cas’ loose Led Zeppelin shirt. It was almost see-through it was so old and worn. That’s why Dean loved it. It had a few holes starting to form around the hem and would no doubt be turned into one of his shop rags soon. Cas hated throwing clothes away and would always give them to Dean to use at the shop. He found his current use of the shirt much more enjoyable. He was able to feel the barely-there fabric drape over him and his nose was filled with the scent of Cas’ laundry detergent and body wash.
Cas chuckled and kissed Dean's nose. "If we hadn't had such a hectic day, then yes. Of course. Today was a bit stressful, though, and it's not over yet. I think that it would be better to wait. Unless you are absolutely sure, that is." Cas knew that Dean wasn't ready, but he didn't mind throwing out the idea of mating his omega that very moment.
"Hello, Meg. How are you doing today?"
"Never going to leave you, baby boy. Never leaving you."
Dean turned over and kept his eyes closed as he opened his mouth. "Thank you, Alpha."
"Stay here and I'll be back."
"Yea... that's my 'mega. Dean." Cas looked over at his mate and smiled proudly.
Bobby gave him a knowing smile. "I understand. It's horrible what happened, but it's good that he's going to pay."
“Yea, you do. Look at me. What are you good at in bed, baby boy?”
Castiel never let up his assault on Dean's hole, but brought one hand around to grab his omega's cock. It took one, two, three strokes, and Dean was coming all over the wall and shooting slick down Cas' throat. As he came down from his high, Cas licked over Dean's rim slowly and rubbed up and down his back.
When he opened the door, Cas didn’t say a word. He simply grabbed Dean’s wrist and walked him to the couch.
Castiel felt his chest rumble with pride. "Yea... I'm your alpha, sweet boy. You're mine. Always."
Cas nodded and yawned as he slowly got out of bed. "So damn chipper," the alpha whispered under his breath.
Dean was still crying a little, but he gave a quick half-smile as he heard the compliment. "That's right. You're the best patient I've ever had. The best Dean I've ever met. The best superhero fan in the whole world. The best friend Bee will ever have."
Dean sighed and rolled onto his back. "What?" He cut his eyes over to Castiel. The kid was clearly still upset at their previous conversation, but he wasn't about to shut down on Cas. Good, that was good.
Dean had already begun dozing when his bedside lamp turned on. “Scoot over.” Cas left no room for argument.
"What..." Dean held his finger up for Castiel to wait while he thought. "What... on top?"
"Be nice." Dean chastised Cas gently. Then he nodded with his head and whispered, "Pie."
Dean smiled a knowing smile and nodded.
Sam's mood changed a bit and he looked up from the floor. "Yea! Mom just had a meeting this morning and is off the rest of today. Dad just needs about an hour of notice and he can come."
I am not planning on updating everyday, but I want to get several chapters out there before I go back to work on Monday! Unlike my first work on here, which is probably going to remain a WIP, I have a very clear plan for this story. Please let me know what you think! Thank you for all of the support!
Dean laid beside him and rubbed his nose along Cas' jawline. "M..."
"Yea."
Dean nodded nervously.
They exchanged so many kisses.
"I'll get some after while. Hey, come in here for a minute, and I'll let you know the run down of today's schedule. It's not too much." Gabriel balanced his pie from A Little Slice of Heaven in one hand and fumbled with his office keys with the other.
<<From Cas: What?
Dean sat and smiled. Hmm… Daddy was giving him some wiggle room, today. He could eat a big breakfast have some independence, but still under his Daddy’s thumb. Oh, this was fucking awesome. He began eating the pancakes and slowly worked his way through the entire breakfast spread—even the berries. His favorite part was by far drinking from his special cup that Daddy had bought him. It was so thoughtful of him to give him a cup that he really liked. Dean sat and looked down. He was so stuffed. He loved this feeling… his mouth full of the cup or paci, his tummy full of Daddy’s breakfast. Now he just needed Cas to fill that one part of him that Dean had been fantasizing about for years. His cock tried to stand up again, reminding him “Hey, it’s our day off. Let’s do this.”
"So, about six months into this gig, I am loving it. Making good money, doing a pretty easy job, got a roof, and a bed. Nothing to complain about. Sure, I felt like crap robbing people, but it was what it was. Arthur told me that his boss was moving into town and that they wanted to meet with me about a promotion. Said I was so good with locks that they wanted me to work on some of their own security. I jumped at that, man. I could still get paid and stop robbing people. It was a win-win."
"Well, I'm glad you like me, D. Guess what?" The omega peered up over the bee. "I like you, too."
That was all Cas could think of as light slowly made its way back into his eyes. How in the world could he, an alpha, leave his omega- his True Mate- for the sake of their damn jackets? He should've stayed. He should've held Dean tightly in one arm and a knife in the other. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Cas was in panic mode and he knew that people did careless things when their adrenaline started pumping. He didn't care about physiology. It was not an excuse he was willing to accept. He abandoned his mate and now Dean had to face the consequences of his impulsiveness. How could he be so careless?
"You're my perfect boy." They stared at each other for a moment, smiling wide, before Cas decided they both needed to be cleaned up.
Cas sat in his usual spot and pointed to Dean's chair which he had moved to directly beside himself, rather than across the table. High chair? It was just
Fuck. Suddenly, Cas was gone and walking to another room. As warm as he had been, that's how cold Dean was now. He took it to fucking far! FUCK! Why the hell had he said anything? He knew he was going to fuck this the fuck up.
Cas pulled a pillow between their torsos so the only part of their bodies that could touch were their heads if they laid down. Which, Dean seemed to want to do. So, there they were, a medical professional and an neglected omega, as close as they could get when Dr. Roche walked in.
"Of course," Cas finally broke the silence. "Thank you so much, Doctor. We cannot thank you enough."
"Is there anything I can get you?"
"Yea, you... you are my perfect Daddy."
Dean looked up at him and winked. "I've heard a lot of it and dished just as much in my day... you're going to have to try pretty hard."
"Oh, don't you worry, bitch. I know you'll be happy to have this down your throat.."
"More than you'll ever know."
“So, what all does Charlie need us to do today? I never got any details.”
"Say it again." Dean wrapped his arms around Cas' waist.
“Oh, I’m sure. In fact, they’re calling for it to be back this afternoon. No thunderstorms or anything. I checked. It’s just so wet.”
Dean turned back to Sam. "Yea, give your number to Cas and I'll text you whenever I get mine set up."
"There is no way you got laid after this, huh? Poor, little baby alpha all by himself." Dean sounded sympathetic, but his smile betrayed him.
Another grunt.
"Cassie! Dean! I'm so happy to see you two up and moving around."
“If you can’t handle this type of punishment, now is the time to say so, baby.”
The receptionist's demeanor changed instantly. "Oh, are you from the ODT? Thank goodness. This kid needs all the help he can get. I heard him screaming last night, the poor thing. I can't even imagine what he's been through."
Ever since Dean was four years old, he has been petrified of thunderstorms. A bolt of lightning hit a transformer box and started the fire that took his mother away from him. A thunderstorm made him and Sammy orphans. It wasn’t just noise. It wasn’t just scary lights. It scared him to his core. He couldn’t let anyone see that—especially Sammy. Normally, he can cope with it. Thunderstorms usually pass after a few minutes. This one was freakishly long and catching him off guard. He felt raw… vulnerable…
Dean wrestled out of Cas's hold. "Hell yeah, let's go!"
Dean nodded. "That's a good point. Alright, well, you probably need 5W-30 oil. Don't buy any of that overpriced bullshit, either. Store brand does the same thing for half the price."
Dean put his index finger to Cas's lips, but kept his eyes trained ahead on their two strangers in the window. "I know you left because you were trying to get things we needed. I'm not mad at you for going with your gut. I will never hold that against you. You're my alpha, but more than that, you're my friend, Cas. I know you were trying to look out for me."
"Hey, no, none of that. They've been arrested. None of them know you're even alive. No one is going to come for us. Trust me. Those assholes are going away for a long time."
My next update will hopefully be this weekend, but for sure within one week!
Dean glanced around the room when he walked in. It was nothing spectacular. Clean lines and sharp contrasts were Cas’ style. Very clean. Very neat. Dean wanted very much to fuck with that. Make his Daddy lose some control. While looking around the room, his eyes fell on the desk. Yes, the bag was there, but there were also a few pictures. Pictures of Cas and his brothers. Cas and his stupid pimp mobile. Hmm… None of Dean. That made him sad.
Cas nodded. He knew that many of his prior patients would chew on pen caps, bite their nails, and chew gum constantly because of the calming effect it had. He went out on a limb and figured it would help Dean calm back down, too. Not to mention how good it felt to his inner-alpha.  "Always, baby. Are you ready to go home?"
"Of course." Sam stuffed his hands in his jacket pockets and and tapped the heels of his shoes on the floor.
"No, Cas, I really appreciate it, and I want to go with you. I want to so damn bad that I feel like I'll die without it, but it'll put you in too much danger. If one of Alastair's men came looking for me and you got hurt--"
Castiel stood and moved to the other side of the bed. He laid down and pulled Dean into his chest. "Do you want to scent me?"
"You got him? Are you serious? You got Alastair?" Castiel immediately smiled and clapped his hands a couple of times. "Oh, wow! Gabe, that is wonderful! We've been trying to track him down for what, five or six years?"
Around three in the morning, the siren of an incoming ambulance woke Cas out of his sleep. Groggily, he reclined the chair back further and turned on his side. After a few moments, he opened his eyes to find Dean staring back at him.
The two alphas stood and shook hands. "Thank you for your help, Mr. Singer."
Dean rolled his eyes. "Yea, because we're True Mates--"
Dean leaned in and kissed behind Cas's ear. "When you gonna mate me?"
Fuck.
For the first time since they left the restaurant, Dean gave a small smile as he looked at Cas. "I have terrible morning breath."
“Yes, Daddy. I know.”
"Or get dirtier." Dean gave an exaggerated wink to Cas. Apparently his scent gave away his thoughts.
Castiel shuffled them around  so Dean was laying on his stomach between Cas's legs with his head on his shoulder. Cas pulled the blanket over them successfully, albeit a bit awkwardly. He wrapped them up tight. He knew he would burn up during the night, but hearing Dean's sigh of contentment made him not care quite as much. The omega found his favorite spot on Cas's neck and began making small circles on it with his tongue.
"Yea! And maybe like, on the nightstands, we could get picture frames? And, holy shit, his and his hand towels?"
On the way out of his house, Castiel also grabbed a couple of books he had been meaning to read, just in case the omega needed sleep. This was his responsibility now, and he had every intention of staying with the omega from the time visiting hours started until they forced him out. He needed human connection and Castiel was going to do everything he could to help him.
“Fuck! Yes! Now how the hell am I supposed to go to sleep like this?” Dean gestured to his groin and looked at Cas with a you-better-fucking-take-care-of-that look on his face.
Dean gave a little half-smile and rolled his eyes. He shook his head a little and Cas was not having any of that. No, his baby needed to know how precious he was. So, he did what any rational human would in this scenario. He lifted Dean as much as he could and plopped him down on the bed. He quickly found Dean’s ticklish spots and showed no mercy. “You, young man, need to show yourself some respect.”
Dean's eyes crinkled as he smiled and shrugged. He held his hand up with his thumb and index finger close together.
Cas could not wait to write in his case files. The patient was able to communicate his wants! This was huge! He was able to use gestures to explain a two-step process. Castiel never considered that D would still have these skills. He moved the chair beside of the omega and began writing quickly. Soon enough, he had an entire page of anecdotal data to provide the ODT. He was ecstatic. He didn't even notice D had turned over. Cas startled a bit when he saw D looking up at him. He was still holding the bee and it covered most of his face, as he had buried his nose in the toy. "I'm glad you like the toy, D."
Dean walked into the bathroom and let the water begin heating up. As he did, he stripped off his boxers and threw them in the hamper. Then, happy as he could possibly be, he walked back into the kitchen with his cock hanging half-hard between his legs. “Hey, babe, are the towels already in the closet?”
“I need genuine compliments, Dean. So give me specifics with that one.”
Castiel quickly shook off these feelings of dread as Dean squeezed his hand. He was sure that his body wash was completely gone by this point in the evening and Dean was picking up on his mild scent of worry. Cas knew he was just imagining things and being overly protective after their experience with Dr. Roche, but he couldn't help it. His omega's smile certainly helped to ease the tension in his shoulders and put thoughts of Roche far into the back of his mind.
Cas chuckled. "Not now, sweet boy. Do you want Charlie back in here or do you want to spend some uninterrupted time with your alpha?"
Castiel could see blood pooling beneath of Roche. Dean had bit and he bit hard. The alpha let out a groan and hauled himself to his feet. He stumbled his way inside.
"Alright, man. We'll see you soon."
"Six and a half." Gabe's demeanor did not improve.
“Oh! Dean, you masturbating does not help you properly deal with your prob—“
"Wonderful, thank you for letting us know."
Dean thought about that one for a minute. Taking a nap sounded great. He slept the night before with Cas, but it was not a very restful sleep. He never woke up, but his head was filled with dreams. Dreams of this little thing going further and further until Cas had him full… in all the ways he wanted.
Castiel began thinking over any mention of a brother, or of a close friend, from Dean's childhood, but he came up blank. The omega had never mentioned any connections of import to him except for his abusers. Castiel remembered that Dean had mentioned having an imaginary friend named Sammy when he was younger, but surely Dean would have remembered that he had a younger brother.
"Burnt toast it is. Oh! And then can we listen to music or watch TV or something where we can cuddle in an actual bed?"
At that, Dean threw his head back and laughed. "Seriously?"
“You’re good at what?”
"Well," Sam gave a small smile. "Those are the two articles that I found. So, clearly, I found your parents. Maybe... I don't know, Mr. Novak? Mr. Singer? What do you think?"
"That's the first letter, Daddy."
"Fucking psychopath."
“Baby, we need to go to bed and we need to talk.”
As I said in the previous chapter, I want to give you wonderful people all that I can before I start back to work on Monday. After that, it will be more of a once a week update.
“Good. With all this damn rain I bet it’s been a bitch to get everything inside.”
"Alpha, you shouldn't be jealous of him. He's the kind of guy I want to get a beer with and hang out with while we watch TV or throw a football around with. He's not the kind of guy you are."
Day two of D and Castiel's visits.
Cas rolled off of him and shook his head. “Dean, we have been friends for so long. Our first time isn’t going to be rushed or pressured. We’re going to take our time and work up to it. When I take you for the first time, I’m going to need hours. Not minutes.”
"That's the thing... there's a reason that he is healing so quickly with me as his ORS."
Dean laughed and walked over. "Hey, Sam. Rough start to the day, huh, man?"
Cas must have heard Dean’s quiet moans. “Close your mouth and suck, baby. Can’t be a proper punishment without you being a little hard and needy for me, can it?”
"Cas, baby, I love you with all of my heart, but I hope you know that I will be sharing this with every person that I know."
But, that's not at all what happened.
“Hmm.. still can’t hear you.”
D pushed the bee into Cas' hands and looked at him expectantly. Castiel knew that it probably wasn't the healthiest thing, but he rubbed his wrist on the plushie a few times to put his scent back in the fabric. As soon as it reached D's hands again, he took a deep breath, settled into his spot, and looked at the television.
Instead of introducing herself, the woman wrapped one arm around each of their necks and pulled them down to her height for a hug. "It is so good to finally meet you." She let go, but left a hand on Dean's arm. "Sam has told me so much about both of you. Especially you, Dean."
They were going home.
It had been less than 48 hours since they met.
"Ready to go, alpha?" Dean was staring down at his boots.
Cas smiled softly and pulled Dean in close. Soon, the omega's breathing was deep and even. Castiel stared at the ceiling while he thought about everything that had happened over the past few days. He just couldn't figure out how Dean was improving so quickly. He was of course excited that it was happening,  but who was this man that could so easily defy Death itself?
Cas just chuckled darkly and spanked it again. "I'll give you kisses when you learn to be good and take what Daddy gives you."
Dean sat with his jaw on the floor. Seriously, he was pretty sure he could feel the linoleum on the bottom of his chin. “D-daddy?”
While Roche had his head thrown back in anticipation, Dean's green eyes darted to the open kitchen door and caught Castiel's blue ones. His eyes widened for a millisecond and then he winked. Quick. His eyes were back on Roche so fast that Cas thought he may have been hallucinating. "Come on, doctor. Don't leave an eager patient waiting. You know what I need."
"You too, man. See ya around."
"Do you think he wants it to be positive?" Dean had his hands in his pockets and seemed determined to kick all of the rocks on the sidewalk out of his way. He was looking down and Cas could tell that his anxiousness was getting the best of him.
Cas stared at her. "There's no way. Not with the amount of communication he can give. Sure, it's minimal and nonverbal, but it's something. His mental state seems stable."
This caused Dean to stop for a moment. He tried to start a few words, but his lips ultimately crashed into Cas's. The alpha couldn't help the surprised noise that came from his throat as he wrapped his arms around Dean. "My alpha. No one else gets to have you. You are mine."
The first pacifier he tried was a light lilac color. It was a little larger than the one Dean had been using. He sucked it for a while and calmed down his earlier thoughts. It was comforting to have something this large in his mouth. It was a little shorter than his thumb, but it felt enormous. It was so wide. It felt right. The next pacifier was a in a little clear box with a different store name. It was very different than the other two. It was for adults. Fuck. Dean could tell. The part that he sucked on filled his mouth completely and if that wasn’t a giveaway, the navy letters “Daddy’s Boy” on the outside sure was. This was his favorite. It labeled him as his Daddy’s.
The two then kept reminding one another of different words Cas's story every time there was a pause in their laughter, like 'endeavors,' 'hugged him,' and 'pepper spray,' until they could hardly breath from laughing. Cas rolled on top of Dean and they continued laughing with Cas's forehead resting on Dean's shoulder. Cas tried, but he couldn't think of a single time in his life where he had been happier.
About half way through the movie, the cafeteria staff delivered the standard soft foods diet to room 327. "Oops, we forgot to put it in your lunch order." D just shrugged and kept his eyes on the television. One hand refused to let Castiel go get his meal and the other was holding Bee under his chin. "After the movie, then." D just gave a quick, almost irritated nod, and rested his cheek on Bee while keeping his eyes on the screen. It looked extremely uncomfortable, but D seemed happy to watch the movie sideways.
"That's not the stupid part. If that had been the end of it, then I may have had some dignity left over by the end of the date. Maybe I could've turned it into an amusing anecdote to share at parties. Sadly, I didn't realize that Gabriel's long-time friend Kali worked at the pizza joint we went to that night."
Cas beamed at Dean. He was so proud of his boy. He was lucky to be his Daddy.
Dean pointed to Bee. "You may not know this, but this is Bee."
Dean turned to her slightly, but he was absolutely rigid. He tried to look confident and Cas was certain that everyone else in the room bought the act. He knew better. He knew that his sweet boy was scared to death of what this woman was about to say. "Yes, ma'am."
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas chuckled and sat up with his back against the headboard of the bed. "Well, talking about your nightmares could certainly help. That helps because it allows you to process what happened and start to gain an understanding of--"
"Dean... sweet boy, I'm not angry with you."
Thank you for staying and supporting this work.
Castiel could not contain the smile that spread over his face. Holy shit. Yes, yes, a million times, yes. This was a dream come true. He tried to tamp down his excitement before speaking. “Of course, baby.”
Dean's words were cut short by a nurse that Castiel didn't know came into the room. "Good morning, boys. Breakfast order needs to be in in the next few minutes. Mr. Novak, could you get that done while I help our patient with his morning needs?"
"If Sam's my..." Dean blinked hard to try to erase his tears. "If Sam's my brother, then I have gone twenty-three years with a family and I didn't even fucking know it. If he's my brother, then I left him. If he's my brother, then... someone... some family didn't... why didn't they want me, too, man?" At this question, Cas saw Dean truly cry for the first time since they had met. He was jerking and sobbing uncontrollably.
Cas gave him a small swat on his arm. "Hey. None of that, now. You have the right to feel nervous or unsure about this. It doesn't make you a baby to feel scared. It makes you human."
"I don't know..." Dean looked around and scanned the shelves from top to bottom.
"Take what you need, D. Whatever you need, it's yours." Cas turned and kissed Dean's cheek.
"There was a cut on his leg. A deep one. It was mildly infected. Nothing some cream, two stitches, and rest couldn't take care of. No one thought of it as being very important. But, with D... without being touched, his immune system is shot to hell. You can look at the lab reports yourself." She handed Cas a folder. "It's gotten into his blood stream and he has a negligible amount of white blood cells left. His care team met and decided that inducing touch would likely put him in a comatose state or induce a severe seizure. Therefore, it is their conclusion that he will either die from this infection within the week or die from touch shock complications."
Cas furrowed his brow and nodded slowly. "Well, I supposed I will go there tomorrow. Do they know of any possible identification? Anything I could use to connect to his old life?"
“Do you need anything before I go?” Castiel was excellent at reading his best friend, but this was like unchartered water and he really didn’t want to swim in it longer than necessary.
“You are mine.” Daddy’s lips trailed down Dean’s chest and sucked his right nipple into his mouth as his hand found his left. “Your nipples are mine. Mine to bite and suck and leave wanting more.” Dean was sure that he was going to cum from that stimulation alone. Cas could play him like a fined-tuned instrument. His mouth moved lower and his drug his teeth down Dean’s stomach. “Your tummy is mine to fill with yummy food and butterflies, but right here,” Daddy moved down a little more and bit right above Dean’s belly-button, “right here, Daddy fills you up with his cum.” Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. It was finally going to happen. Right? Fuck, it had to. Cas straddled Dean and pulled his cock slowly from its confines. Dean’s jaw dropped and he could feel drool on his lip moving to his chin. He knew Cas was big. He just didn’t expect his cock to be so… pretty. The thickness was proportional to the length and the thick vein underneath was slowly pulsing with want. Daddy was at least two inches bigger than him and any fake cock he had ever taken. Fuck.
Castiel approached room 327 with caution. He took a deep breath and knocked lightly. He didn't hear anything, so he slowly opened the door. The omega appeared to be sleeping on his side facing the wall. Cas was sure that he was faking. So, instead of approaching the bed, he sat in the chair that was beside the window. He decided not to talk directly to the omega and to simply read in silence.
…But he can become one, for Dean.
The clock reads 12:01am.
“Tell me.”
Cas turns to him with a sticky finger caught between his lips. Dean promptly loses his own train of thought.
Castiel kisses him. It’s ridiculous—pointless, fruitless,
it, he just wants to be given their medals so they can go shower and celebrate and sleep. He still needs to look each of them over to make sure they don’t have any injuries, he needs to get them fed, he needs to spend an entire night cuddling and worshiping Cas for being the
he is so often called. His dirk slices through the ropes holding her halter and he squeezes his heels into her sides, jumping the fence and shooting down into the valley.
Sarah inches closer to him, perched delicately on the edge of the mattress while she, Dean and Sam stare at the motel’s shitty TV. Fingers brush Dean’s own and he feels his cheeks get hot. Sweat gathers at the back of his neck and under his arms and he swallows thickly.
Des stares. Dean stares back.
Cas flops back onto the bed.
It’s a blessing to have to wait until the horse paddock before saying their goodnights. Dean watches raptly as Cas sorts out the mare, cutting new ropes to re-tie her in the stall, giving her food and water, another apple. Thanking her. He barely has time to jump the fence before Dean presses him back into it with a series of joyful little kisses.
, but they beat out
Dean had been confused at first, and upset: he’d wanted to reciprocate.
Cas turns to glare at him, the expression crumbling as Dean rubs at his cheek and presses kisses to his chin. “C’mooon,” he teases. “Let’s get some leftover chili and watch old Earth movies.”
She kisses him fast: a soft, dry press of lips that has Dean’s face flaming and Sam recoiling in disgust. “Ew,
As in, they’re finishing the race. They’re done. They’re finishing the race and they’re done.
, because… because even twisted and conflicted as you were, you radiated love in all the ways I didn’t know I craved to feel. How was I supposed to pledge myself to an absent father when you were right there? When my own doubts were later echoed in your hands and the steady beat of your heart a hundredfold?
“You just—” Dean shakes his head. “You say all this epic crap about me like you didn’t change me, too.” He looks down at their joined hands, frowning as he brushes a thumb over Cas’s knuckles. “I didn’t really have any friends before you. Or not like you, at least. Hunting… you kinda gotta keep people at an arm’s length. And you—y’know, you helped me be myself. Made me brave. So, uh. Thanks. I guess.”
“Mmhm. I just had to learn the right notes.”
is on.
“Is the Pope a Catholic?”
“Happy—mmph!”
“Really?” Dean teases, a flush exploding across his cheeks and chest and the tips of his ears. “That’s it?”
Not that it’s like—a
“Sorry,” the dude says sheepishly over the noise. It’s him. The guy. The man. With the hands.
“Hey—!”
Cas pulls away with a smile, fingers moving to brush the blush on Dean’s cheeks. It’s weird that he never learned to be embarrassed by public displays of affection and kissing and all the millions of other things people get weird about, but—it’s kinda nice, too. Like he isn’t ashamed. Like he’ll never be ashamed.
“You’re not having one?”
“And that’s what happened to you. Hypothermia.”
They’ve barely started, Dean shovelling large spoonfuls into his mouth in comparison to Cas’s more sedate pace when he nudges Castiel with his elbow. “Hey, Cas?”
It’s an embarrassingly short affair. One, two strokes and the warmth at the base of Cas’s spine sends a tinging up to the base of his skull and down to his fingertips. He crushes Dean to his chest as he spills over his fist, crying out into the juncture of his neck.
, he’d said, flushed and gorgeous, fondling Cas’s half-hard prick with a gentleness he had adored him for.
Dean swallows thickly. “You wanna fuck my mouth?”
Castiel slides their palms together, threading their fingers. The way Dean holds his hand brings a helpless, hopeless smile to his face. Cas kisses him once and only once; the kind of familiar, dry press of lips suited to spouses. “Sleep well, husband.”
Cas swallows.
Someone told him, once, that there is no way to become wrapped up in another person if not for sex.
To his right, Sam’s sitting like he’s got a rod shoved up his ass. He’s practically vibrating: glaring daggers out the window, fingers digging into the leather backseat and shoulders hunched up to his ears. The more it goes, the easier it is to set him off, and Dean’s not in the mood for an argument tonight—especially not one on his behalf. He sighs.
It’s a thought that barely registers, Cas too preoccupied with holding and being held. His gasps in the aftermath, slowly coming back to himself as Dean lays kisses on his half-bared shoulder. “…
“Whatever,” Dean waves off. “Doesn’t matter. I’m having a great time tonight. Are you?”
Cas laughs.
“Yeah.”
“Handfasting first.”
“Uh… nothing,” Dean says. “You’re gonna spoil your dinner.”
“It was my privilege to choose you,” Cas says. He sounds confused.
“Haven’t heard anything over the radio, so… that’s good, right?”
“And Benny was a total rock, Dean, I’m telling you…”
Dean grins.
I’ll — I’ll run away with you every night for the rest of my life,” he says haltingly. He looks up, and Cas feels his heart swell and break all at the same time. Feels his vision start to blur. He knows he’s lucky; knows he’s beyond fortunate, but sometimes he wishes —
Cas has learned that the newlywed excuse goes a long way anywhere, but works especially well when paying outrageous amounts of money in a fancy hotel. He expects they’ll also leave the champagne bottle.
He’s got his phone pressed to his ear as Cas grabs the ice bucket and nods at the door. “I think we have some beer left in the car.”
He savours the moment his fingers card through Dean’s pubic hair and wrap his around the base of his cock. Dean’s arms tighten around him, body arching in an attempt to bring them closer even as he breathes too heavily for kisses. “Fuck,” he mumbles, “Fuck, Cas, I —”
He laughs when Dean tackles him into the pillows.
“Cas is right there!”
God, he hates early mornings.
Cas squeezes his hand and the corner of Dean’s mouth tugs up in a grin.
It really, truly is.
They get settled with coffee, for the first time maintaining a respectful distance between them. It’s oddly hurtful, and the longer they remain apart the more awkward Cas feels. He’s practically shaking out of his own skin when he suggests they go back inside. “You’re tired,” he says. “We should just go back to sleep.”
Dean stares at the bathroom door until some asshole walks through it, immediately whirling around to frown at the mirror. His eyes start to prickle and he squeezes them shut.
Freckled legs wrap more firmly around Cas’s waist, and they suddenly both become very aware of Castiel’s hand placement. A slight shift on Dean’s part have his fingers dipping into his crack. Cas bites back a groan. Dean smirks.
“Sorry, you just—”
His eye’s gonna bruise and he’s pretty sure he has a cut on the apple of his cheek—his nose is definitely bleeding. It’s nothing more than he deserves, though. Maybe.
“Yeah. ’Sides, this is nice.”
“Of course,” Cas mumbles.
“I’m having a great time.”
“Seeing me naked is a privilege, Castiel.”
They’re
, would you let go of the box? Just—”
It’s funny; for all that he has been told he is an abomination, Cas has never felt more holy.
“…Something steel, huh? Eighteen years is steel.”
working to—to love myself
“We can share? I could only grab three.”
Cas looks down at his hands. “I think… I think I always had the potential to become—this. To get here.” He shifts, moving to idly play with the hem of the sheet. “You have to understand, Dean: King David, Solomon’s lover, Delilah, Judith, Bathsheba—they are nothing to you. Achilles wished Patroclus was so lovely of face and pure of heart. I remember thinking, strangely, that such radiance was just for the Righteous Man who will bring about Paradise. And yet for all the beauty I’d seen; gods and goddesses, kings and queens and commoners, the loveliness in every far corner of this world, that—
“A single,” Dean repeats. “For me and my hubby.” Jason keeps staring. “What, you ain’t never seen a pair of husbands before? This is California!”
, over bitter coffee and burnt toast, cheek resting on his palm as Cas methodically slathered the two black slices in his plate with honey. He’d seemed surprised by it, too, like sleep had dampened the ever-present iron grip on his own heart.
Cas hums, one hand working himself while the other braces himself against the ground. Dean looks like what he imagines one of th old gods to be, bare and flushed and sated in the grass. Like some kind of radiant thing worthy of ballads and poetry. Lost in his own pleasure, Cas doesn’t realize Dean has moved until he’s touching him; hitching up his thigh as he captures his mouth in a messy kiss. He bats Cas’s hand to the side and wraps fingers around his slick prick.
Jo’s hair is stringy and streaked with mud, Benny’s racing shirt has the sleeves ripped off and Sam’s not wearing anything but those dumb Patagonia shorts of his, scrapes and bruises on display for all to see. They look exhausted. They look ecstatic. They look like they just went three rounds with Mother Nature and lost.
Or so he’d thought.
“Sorry.”
“Can we get two more over here?” Des flags down the bartender.
Dean smirks against his mouth, giving a loud, exaggerated moan as he buries his hands in Cas’s baggy tee. He’s laying it on thick, stumbling back to block Jo’s path to the coolbox and Castiel can’t help laughing as he’s pulled along. They bump up against the counter and Cas pulls away, playfully pushing Dean’s face away when he draws near. “Don’t you have a ship to captain?”
Dean fucking loves him.
“You ready?”
~ * ~
“Yeah, earned it! As in, had to keep hiding the dumb thing every friggin’ five seconds because you kept cleaning and cooking and—mmph!”
Dean picks up his hand, cradling it, palm up, in both of his own. His fingers gingerly trace the lines there. He bites his lip. “
“Dean, you’re being unreasonable. Body heat —”
aware of in a
“Dean—
“That’s it, take it.”
“With my symptoms? I stopped, I woulda died. We’d run into some bad luck and lost the emergency blanket, and everything was fucking freezing because of the water. Stripping down and huddling together wasn’t gonna help me; I needed serious medical attention.” His nails bite into his palms. “It’s the coldest I’ve ever been.”
~ * ~
“That seems—”
Cas smiles, though he knows the thing doesn’t reach his eyes. Truthfully, he doesn’t even know why he’s disappointed; they can’t leave Scotland. Moreover, Cas doesn’t want to — he’d be asking Dean to leave Sam and Ellen and Bobby and Jo, not to mention Castiel’s own family. And with the ever-worsening relations between the Scots and the English? He and Dean have a duty to protect their loved ones. To keep their traditions alive. To fight for their country, should it come to that.
“Seriously, dude,” Dean says. He’s beaming, now. “What?”
it led him to the deepest, darkest hole in the Pit. It had been no hardship to hold Dean Winchester close and fly him out of Hell, to sing for the first time in eons, so loud and clear and joyous it was heard in the Ninth Sphere:
Dean’s eyes flutter open. “Now?” he asks, caught between sleep and incredulity.
Another step, and Dean curses as he’s forced further into the cold water. “Cas, if you come any closer, I swear —
“I’m happy you chose me,” Dean breathes. “I love that you chose me.”
Happy fucking new year.
Outside, nebulas smear themselves across space-time, but their colour pales in comparison to the riotous blush of Dean’s cheeks. Even after all this time, the colour reaches his ears. Cas smirks as he pulls away, starting to divest himself of his own clothing. The smirk turns into a grin as Dean does the same, and soon enough Cas is hooking a freckled leg over his shoulder, turning to leave a line of wet, biting kisses all the way to Dean’s groin. He rakes his fingers through the reddish, wiry hair there.
in his ear, like he’s not huge, like this isn’t a big deal, like Dean isn’t getting fucked up the ass after being eaten out. Like the ghost of John friggin’ Winchester isn’t rolling over in his grave. Like Dean isn’t gonna die in a couple months.
They hold a ceremony at the bunker a week later.
“Uh—”
—their appreciation for beauty, their seriousness in all things—that Castiel saw reflected in his own self.
“What would you like for breakfast?” Dean opens his mouth and Cas rolls his eyes. “
~ * ~
He’s smiley when Cas kisses him.
sweet on him, and there is no one else Dean feels comfortable whining to.
It’d taken months, Dean remembers. Months of slow, hard friendship: of arguments and blowouts and unbearable wanting, until on one totally regular, run-of-the-mill Tuesday, Cas had kissed him in the middle of Doctor Sexy. Things had been a little less slow-going, after that.
“I can explain,” Cas rushes to say. He’s in front of Dean in two strides, reaching for the box that Dean definitely does not give him because there are two rings in there why are there two rings in there sure they’d settled on a small commitment ceremony but why the fuck there are two rings in there.
Cas stares back.
“Dude, we’re not leaving in the middle of the Miracle Max scene.”
for me,” he echoes. “Christ.”  Dean takes Cas’s bottom lip between his teeth, splays his hand over the small of his back. They stumble towards the boulder and Castiel presses him up against it, grinning wide and wolfish as the man starts to fumble with his shirt. Dean’s right leg hitches around Cas’s waist even as his clever fingers grasp and pull in handfuls, until Cas’s shirt is half-hanging over his kilt. He toys with the woolen material and Castiel groans, ripping himself away. He pants clouds of humidity into the cold air and grins as Dean follows him until he’s too far away to kiss. Dean's hair is a mess from Castiel’s fingers, and the sash of his kilt is caught in the crook of his elbow. Cas’s left palm slides further up his thigh, under his kilt, and breathes out shaky into the crook of his neck. “
“Yeah,” Dean says, eyeing the camera warily. She gives him an encouraging look, and he sighs. Fuck reality TV. “Ah… I’m a pretty big dude to carry, though. Um. ’Specially when half the team was in danger of hypothermia, too. Benny and Sam couldn’t drag me; everyone was too weak. Jo weighs like ninety pounds soaking wet—”
And that shit shouldn’t make him blush, but Dean feels his cheeks heat, anyway. He clears his throat and presses a kiss to Cas’s knuckles, twining their fingers. “Me too, Cas.”
“Yes.”
, Cas, I—” He abruptly loses steam, here. “…I love you.”
Cas kisses him quiet, pulling away with a grin so wide it threatens to break his face.
“C’mon, man, you gotta—” Dean cuts himself off. Shakes his head. “I’m not cut out for this stuff: dates, romance… you gotta know that by now. And I haven’t been with anyone long enough to, y’know, even get to the part where we’re mushy and shit. But… it’s not because I don’t want to. I mean, flowers and chocolate? Not my thing, but you
“Yeah?”
He wriggles his brows like a lecherous old man, and Dean laughs and shoves his head, giggling through a yelp when the asshole
Dean wraps his tartan around Cas’s shoulders and offers him whiskey and slices of hard cheese. They sit in the lee of the hill, swaddled and half atop one another, and eat and drink and kiss until their lips are sore and their bellies are full. Castiel doesn’t think he’s ever been so in love.
He carefully extracts himself from their bed, padding into the other room and closing the bedroom door. The sun is beginning to paint the first impressions of light on the horizon; the water is calm—it’s going to be a beautiful day.
Dean smiles and takes his hand.
Cas, though? Cas looks in his element. The stubble makes his jaw look sharper, the dirt brings out his eyes. He helps haul the boat onto land and Dean can see the play of his muscles under his shirt. He’s flushed and filthy and
They’re married.

was a disaster.”
In the freezer? They’ve been slowly cleaning it out to keep from going to the grocery store.
, Dean spreads his legs as he pulls Cas’s hand down. It’s easier for Dean to wrap his legs around him this way, easy to ride the crease of his thigh. Not slippery enough, though. “My mouth?” Cas bites the question into Dean’s lips, soothing the hurt with flicks of his tongue as Dean groans. He pushes at his shoulders and gets a smirk in return.
Castiel laughs as Kevin reaches for the bread disks, hand darting out to claim one for himself before they get passed around again. Spiced to perfection, buttery and soft and just—delicious. He narrows his eyes as Dean plucks the bread from his hand with a wolfish grin, reaching to pick another two and quickly depositing them on his own plate. Immediately following, a booted foot toes up Cas’s calf. Dean’s grin has turned crooked and shy, and there’s a flush to his cheeks as he shoves the disk in his mouth. He chews with his mouth open.
It takes a second washing up, though this time is different than the last; it starts much the same way — the teasing, the complaining… but play gives way to staring like they haven’t since they first began courting. Cas catches Dean looking and he turns away like some blushing maiden, peeking back like he didn’t just have Cas inside him, like they aren’t bound in all the ways two people can be. Castiel grins down at his toes.
that way.”
Fuck.
“Tonight,” Dean agrees. “Every night. I’ll say I’m ill —”
Dean pushes Des away just in time to puke all over the sticky bar floor.
, you numpty —”
“Marissa,” the girl answers. She’s got a great smile.
“Yeah.”
“Wait, why?” Dean frowns. He has foam on his upper lip. Cas wants to kiss it away.
. “You’re such a dick,” he huffs, drawing him up and rolling them over. Cas goes willingly, throwing a leg over Dean’s hip and grinding sweet and slow. Dean smirks.
It’s these moments Cas likes the most; when Dean is soft against him, pulling a blanket over their nakedness to stave off the chill. They need to fix the generator—they’ve been needing to for at least three systems, but Cas suspects this has little to do with Dean being unable to find the parts and more with the reasoning that colder temperatures provide a better excuse to cuddle.
There is nothing more satisfying to him than giving his partner pleasure. It’s his favourite competition—besting himself, over and over, finding all the ways Dean can writhe and moan and beg and then giving him exactly want he wants, what he needs, better than before. Pleasing him and loving him, tangibly. It isn’t that he doesn’t like sex; it’s wonderful for the closeness it brings. For its more physical joys. It’s just—the physical act of sex is like scratching a mildly annoying itch. Or eating a bland meal. The pleasure is in giving, taking for himself is… lacklustre.
“Other than the obvious,” Cas grumbles.
“Tell me something.”
Dean narrows his eyes. “You got me a
Castiel likes the liminal space he occupies in the moments between sleep and wakefulness, where everything glows. It’s warm and wonderful and he draws it out for as long as possible, the minutes dragging along by way of tender touches. It reminds him of the peaceful parts of angelhood.
Dean snorts, continuing to drag his fingertips down Cas’s ribs to his hip, over his ass and thigh. “Yeah,” he mutters. “Totally unresponsive. You’re not blissed out
Dean’s too busy biting back noises to answer.
Hand twisted in the side of Cas’s shirt, dragging up
“Cas…”
“Mm. About you. When you were an angel.”
The Impala is not a fine ship. She used to be; before the days of lightweight polymers, all machines were made like her; pure steel and alloys… a sharp paint job and a spacious interior, designed for long-distances and harsh conditions while sacrificing little in the way of comfort. Her galley is sizeable, her rooms decent, and despite other ships her age oft finding themselves in scrap yards across the twelve systems, Dean keeps Baby in the best metals money can buy.
His cheeks are so red they’ve droned out his freckles, and Cas can’t stop himself from reaching to run his knuckles over the flushed skin. “I don’t remember a lot of it,” he murmurs. “Some of that is Naomi, I’m sure, but—some is also just being human, I think. I’ve been writing it all down, so I don’t forget.”
Cas gives his cheek a smiley kiss. Like it’s no big deal. Like this whole thing isn’t a huge, terrifying, fucking wonderful trust exercise. Like it isn’t a leap of faith out of a goddamn plane. "I'll be back. No green pepper!"
On their eighteenth anniversary, they retrace their steps. It’s little more than a fluke, Castiel knows; Eden is one of the biggest trade hubs this side of the Empyreanic belt—but it’s nice, all the same. To feel the spongey dirt under his shoes, smell the greenery… Cas thinks he can consider himself well-travelled at this point—thirteen systems and two galaxies are nothing to sneeze at—and the colours in Eden are still some of the most beautiful he’s ever seen.
The Neanderthals were poets, and Castiel would spend hours reciting their words of love to himself, over and over, marveling at them. Certainly, there were other creatures who loved and loved deeply, but there was something about
“I want to blow you.”
“Are you sure? I don’t want this to be something you regret—”
In this part of the country, there are few trees; the ground smooth with grass and uneven with rock. It’s almost a shame that theirs cannot be a clandestine wedding in some romantic wood in the south, or the closer outcropping known for its view of the loch. People get married there all the time, in secret — couples with child or star-crossed lovers or rebellious young people. Men and women.
It’s kismet that
He presses a kiss to his bare ring finger. Slides the ring on. Kisses him there again.
“Not without orders.”
“’Kay,” Dean mumbles. “C’m back.”
Sammy’s wailing on the lumpy couch; boxed in by pillows and covered in his baby blanket. Dean’s baby blanket. His old one. Sam screams and screams and screams like he's got an extra pair of lungs in that tiny body of his, and Dean wonders how he can stand to be so loud when the world is always already yelling.
, Dean is gonna mcfreaking lose it. The thing came in a discrete little box eight hours before they were forced inside for who knows how long, and he’s lost count of the amount of times he’s had to relocate it since.
“Further north,” Cas continues. “We’d go as far as the ocean, up where people don’t care about who you are or where you came from as long as you keep to yourself. We could live in a cottage on a cliff, and sleep in the same bed, a-and…” he trails off. “Or we could get on a ship. Travel past England and to Rome, or Greece — Balthazar said men laying together is more common, there. And that the water is warmer.” He shakes his head. “Imagine bathing in a loch that isn’t cold?”
As long as… as long as you marry me, in return.”
“That’s mighty presumptuous of you, Castiel.”
“Every night.”
“You know those Terran traditions are ancient, right? We’re talking mid-20
They pick their way down the lee of the hill, where moonlight illuminates the bank of a small stream. Dean pulls him to a patch of grass among the rocks and grasps his hands tightly. “How —” He clears his throat. “How d’you wanna do this?”
before kissing him again. And again. And again. He pulls away and moves back when Cas chases, a crooked, goofy smile tugging at his mouth. Cas feels himself start to grin in response. “What?” he asks.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut. Runs a dirty hand over his mouth. He tries for a smile that must look more like a grimace, refusing to look at the camera pointed at his face. Eco-Challenge is known for being a sufferfest in a metric fuckton of different ways, but the film crew adds a special layer of hell. “Look, Trace, I know that these little interviews are part of the whole race thing, but I ain’t a racer. Just doing my job. Waiting.”
“I don’t think so,” Cas replies, running fingers through Dean’s hair. “I don’t really feel like it, either.”
Cas frowns against Dean’s left pec, eyes looking up at him from where he’s laying his head on Dean’s chest. He feels a hand card through his hair and rub at the base of his skull. He hums into the contact like a cat, closing his eyes in contentment as he feels Dean’s unabashed stare. He rolls off of his chest so they’re nose-to-nose, fingers brushing in the space between them as they lay on their sides.
He lifts his gaze from Dean’s cock, shiny with his own spit, to find him looking down with wide eyes. Gorgeous. Cas licks a stripe up the inside of Dean’s thigh and dips his middle finger into his mouth, tracing a line with the wetted tip from across his perineum to his hole. His own prick is hard enough to crumble stone, but besides the aborted thrusts of his hips he ignores it. He wants — he
“JESUS, DEAN, GET OFF OF HIM—”
Castiel is by no means an expert at sucking cock, but it is something he enjoys very much. He likes burying his face in Dean’s groin and letting him ride his face, enjoys licking and kissing along his length and taking him into his mouth. He knows Dean’s noises and his movements; how to tell when he’s close, when he enjoys something immensely and when he doesn’t care for it at all. He likes the act of swallowing, likes the way his jaw aches after. Likes the way Dean looks at him. Kisses him.
“What, you sweet on me or somethin’?”
Despite the time crunch, Dean parks Baby like the queen she is before bolting from the driver’s seat like a friggin’ rocket. Sam’s not hard to spot: he’s got an overgrown head of hair and is more bean pole than teenager. He’s awkwardly standing beside some equally awkward girl and Dean physically resists the urge to smirk. Across the room, a different girl in a crop top catches his eye. She’s not a dumb kid and she’s too young to own this house, so she must be the sibling chaperone. Dean winks. She raises an unimpressed brow.
Cas hands him a plate piled high with bacon and eggs and pancakes and grins.
“No way, I earned it!”
