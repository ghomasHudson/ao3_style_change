“Yes, that is true.” The angel seemed to think about that for a minute. “Maybe you can try to make a harness?”
The deep voice startled Dean, but when his brain caught up with what was said he released a small confused chuckle.
“Give me your notebook with your pencil. I will write every step that you will need to follow. Even if Sinclair doesn’t have any listening device in our cell, I don’t want any undesirable attention.”
He tried to get up but heard snarling just next to him. He turned his head to see where the monster where and it was a bit disconcerting to see that the blond one was just a few feet in front of him with her head looming over him. The second one still had her hand on the arm of her friend.
“Thanks. I meant why do you need it? I thought we were supposed to go. We’re in a bit of a hurry here.”
Every eye focused on Dean and even if he liked scrutinizing eyes every other night 40 pairs were a lot.
“You’re my best friend and at first I thought that was just that, you are having a special place in my heart because of that. But time passed, I made new friends, a new family and I understood that the feelings I had were more than that. Those feelings were something I never felt before. And I was scared. Because you’re an angel and I thought that you couldn’t be able to reciprocate them. That’s why I never said anything to you. But then, Jack and I met an angel and a human, living together for millennials. But I was still afraid that you couldn’t feel this way. But then you said it and I never said it back. But now I can say it and I’m saying it again: I love you Castiel.”
After a few hours of reading journals, Sam didn’t have anything interesting for them, but Dean was, on the other hand, well engrosses in the article wrote in front of him. It talked about pie. All the kind of pie he wanting to taste just a few hours away.
“You said he can change to a dog, right?" Castiel nodded, "so I supposed I can’t just put hit around his leg?”
Now that the spell was on, he took a few moments to observe the beauty of the young man face. His skin was tan, and his cheeks and nose were cover by an infinity of freckles. The collector moved his hand from the forehead of the boy to stroke his sandy blond hair. The boy’s eyes were still closed, but he heard from his staff who tranquilized him, that they were a lovely shade of green. He was impatient to see them.
The smell of breakfast helps him found the motivation to leave his bed and put on his dead man robe. Miracle follows him to the kitchen where his crazy brother, who just got back from running (because if you choose to wake up early just to run, you’re a crazy person) is making breakfast. When he arrived the toast just pop up from the toaster.
I'm sorry that I disappear again for so long. I had a big writer-block and I couldn't find the motivation to work on that fic... I had ideas to start new fics but leaving this one in progress and starting a new one made me feel bad and, in the end, I didn't write anything...
“You’re not crazy if this is what you’re thinking.” He continued “I’m just your friendly neighbor who’s annoyed by all the commotion you make!”
He was examining the room with the morning light, but his eyes quickly focus on a little tray just in front of the weird door-wall thing.
“I love you to Cas” It feels good to have said it and Castiel is looking at him like he’s the most precious thing on the planet, but he must feel like Dean isn’t done because he doesn’t interrupt him.
Castiel’s eyes narrowed even more even if he didn't understand the innuendo. Those eyes were almost closed, how could this guy still see him?
Dean still feels like he’s dreaming when he’s seeing all these people sitting at his table. He gave everyone a beer before sitting.
Well, it looks like he didn’t have any other choice than opening his sensitives eyes. Everything was feeling so weird, but he was pretty sure he didn’t go to a bar last night to drink. He was pretty sure that he didn’t even leave his motel room.
Soon enough he could hear someone knocking from the other side. It was a rhythmic sound and the young man couldn’t be happier that his father taught him Morse code when he was just a kid. Like his old man will say: You never know when things will come in handy.
Dean slowly went to Castiel’s door and turn the doorknob. Like his own before, it wasn’t even lock. Behind it he found the same hallway that he had found after his own cell, the only difference was some weird drawings behind the door. Dean never saw something like that before but it probably some magic sigil like the one Castiel told him to draw on his bounds to deactivate the magic link. Castiel seemed to be someone who knew a lot of supernatural stuff, maybe Sinclair chose to humiliate the fellow hunter using his own techniques and knowledge against him.
That would probably mean that the guy was ok, and that situation wasn’t a big surprised for him. The young man hoped that they could talk again later.
“What Metatron is trying to say,” started the guy from the other side of the wall, “is that they are supernatural creatures invited in Sinclair’s zoo every day. That is what he wanted to scare you about earlier. Every day, one kind of supernatural individuals are invited and apparently today is the fairies turn.”
Content with his job well done, Dean smiled up at Castiel who was staring at him again. Dean stared back with a big smile for several seconds but a movement of Castiel’s wing put his head back on track.
He tried to open the door carefully because he didn’t know what was behind it. He really thought that it wasn’t going to be that easy and that he would lose a lot of time trying to unlock it, but the door wasn’t even locked. Maybe he was lucky (like that already happen in is life…), or maybe Sinclair was really underestimating him. Soon he will learn to never underestimate a Winchester!
Anyway, this chapter isn't perfect but I felt bad to just disappear without news so I choose to post it. Hope you like it anyway <3
“Look, Castiel, we can’t just kill him like a pig in a slaughterhouse. It would make us the monster of this story and it will be very messy, and we can be sure Sinclair will put his best man on our asses!”
He quickly took off his clothes and change into the guard’s uniform. It was a simple black jean and an assorted black belt with a blue shirt and a black vest with written Security in the back and on a pocket over his chest. Dean took off his shoes and put the black boots Castiel have given him. With that look, he could probably pass as a guard without any issues.
Castiel gave him back his notebook through the vent and Dean spent the rest of his morning reading and preparing for their escape, asking some questions to Cas.
He proceeded with hast and it was done a few seconds before the end of the time limit. The design of this last one was a little sloppy but it looked good enough for Dean and he even if he wanted to, he didn’t have the time to start over.
Because he didn’t have a choice, Dean stayed right where he lost his dignity on that floor. He kept an eye on the vetalas while they turn around to live the room. The door shut behind the blond one who was still giving him the stink eye.
“You’re really is more important than that. I know that you probably don’t believe what Sinclair said about you, but he was right. You’re special in the eyes of Heaven.”
“Yeah?” Dean answered with a mouthful, but he couldn’t care less about table manners right now and the guy sounded like an ass anyway. “What’s your name by the way?”
“I’m so sad. But please just don’t yell preparing your plan, it’s annoying and I’m pretty sure it’s not a good way to make it work. Now shush, I’m trying to work.” How could he sound so annoyed in just one sentence, Dean would never know.
He could see from the corner of his eyes, the door open to let enter two guards. One was carrying a tray loaded with a huge plate of spaghetti with tomato sauce as well as a pitcher of water and an apple.
“Yeah. Thanks, man, I’m okay.” Dean reassured him. “But what does Tinkerbell’s army wanted? Why were the kids looking at me like I was some kind of unicorn? I understand now that this is some kind of zoo but, why I’m here?”
Dean stared a little dumbstruck before doing what he was told. Together they look at every cabinet in just a few minutes. They found everything that could be useful to them like first aid stuff and some drugs Castiel said that they could use against different creatures.
He was oddly glad that he found himself in the middle of the room, without any possibility of movement while the door opened before him.
The collector drew a heavy and full set of keys from the inside of his costume jacket and opened a heavy door to step on the cell and fully observe the beauty of his prize. He knelt in front of the lying man. He was so young, maybe between 20 and 24, perhaps the word boy would still be more accurate in comparison of his own old age.
The young man denied his brain who wanted to make another remark about how this was kinky to defuse this stressful and serious atmosphere.  He opened the door and push his prisoner outside the cell.
Dean was really starting to feel frustrated. The two dudes were talking about some bad things that were supposed to happened to him but neither of them wanted to explain anything. There were too busy insulting each other than clarify the situation.
With an enormous 6-foot wingspan, the wings were impressive. A magnificent set with hundred of feathers. Most of them were beautiful, with a shiny charcoal black color and some of them had some deep color like green or blue depending on the light, just like a spot of oil on the asphalt.
“Dude faith? Really? I need proof, not some stupid pastor-bullshit. And by the way, I still don’t know your name and I have no clue how you know mine ‘cause I’m pretty sure I didn’t tell you.”
“Dean, you’re really tired, you should try to sleep.” His angel said like he was concern that Dean would just drop on the floor in exhaustion.
Dean looked at his new friend with a huge proud smile and step in the hallway. He was sure that the guy was following him but at mid-way, he looked for the guy without seeing him at his side. He turned over and saw that he was still standing in the doorway with a glare aimed at Dean.
The girl sighed loudly, like doing her actual job was a big task that she just didn’t find interesting to do.
Dean followed Castiel in the hallway and he really wasn’t expecting that. It was beautiful with high ceilings, clean wood paneling, and giants paintings of angels and heavenly things.
“Sinclair is a powerful warlock that uses his power to enslave all sorts of creatures. Some of them here are killers and use violence like it’s a form of art. It’s not the place for a human and you can’t hope to get out of here alive on your own. What you can see here he just the tribune he keeps for the public, but he does his business in the back where it’s all chaos and destruction. I don’t have the time to explain everything right now, but you need to trust me when I tell you that you need me. We will need to traverse that zone to leave this estate.”
Dean stood up, approaching Cas so he could touch his face, just to assure himself that he wasn’t dreaming. Their eyes meet and Dean saw the tears in Castiel’s eyes. He wasn’t sure if they were sad or happy tears, but he had some stuff to say that hopefully will make them happy.
There were three chairs in front of computers but only one of them was occupied. The only guy here had his work boots on the desk and was snoring loudly. The big guy with his fluffy hair and large tummy looked more like a tired teddy bear than an armed elite guard.
Dean arrived at the end of the hallway where a door stood proud in front of him. He had found some bobby pins in the bathroom (why did they give him that was a mystery to him, he didn’t have ridiculous Disney’s princess hair like his brother - thank you very much). With them, he had planned to open the lock of the door like he saw people do on tv.
Sadly, Dean was done with his spaghetti. He eyed the apple with distrust, but he was still a little hungry. After all, apple pies were sent on earth by heaven (at least in his eyes) so he decided to eat the apple. Of course, Sammy will not know that he ate that fruit.
Castiel was talking animatedly. That was a big contrast with his usual matter of fact-robot voice he used so far. And for what Dean could hear, he was becoming completely crazy. It sounded like the fact that Dean just came back from the bathroom was the most amazing thing that his neighbor heard in weeks.
Dean is just done with his brother while said brother just laughs “I wanted to do that for a very long time! Oh, you’re right I do feel better.”
Since the only furniture in this room was the desk, Dean hopped the key was there. He went to look for it, walking without making a noise as his father told him when he trained him to be a hunter. It was easy since the guard was snoring like his life depend on it. And bingo! On the desk, in a big mess of folders and half-eaten bags of Cheetos and Skittles was a box with several little transparent compartments with numbers on it. Dean could see a shiny little key in the one with the 2 on it but nothing in the on with the 3, the number he read on his own door. That could be what he was looking for since he hadn’t been chained.
“I wish you were there too, Cas. I’m trying to live my life but it’s so hard without you. They’re so many more things I would like to tell you, but it’s just felt so wrong if you’re stuck in the Empty.” Dean dropped his head, looking at his hands on his laps, trying not to cry again.
The hunter turned away to find a tempting pile of strawberry pancakes waiting for him on the table. There was also a mug of coffee with sugar and cream place next to it.
“Metatron quit bothering the human.” The new voice startled Dean. It came from behind him, but nobody was there. Dean slowly turn around. Nobody was staring at him from the weird pavements and that’s good news, but he couldn’t see where the new voice came from.
They walk a couple of minutes in that hallway before reaching an intersection. Castiel made him stop and hide behind a plant in a massive vase. The angel wings concealed him since the angel had his back to him but Dean pushed one of the wings a little to be able to see his companion face.
He came to see if his personals werewolves’ assistants did their job correctly. Obviously, it what just a title. It’s not really a great idea to call them slaves when you worked as a daily basis with other members of their species, even if because of his powers the slaves and the public would never be able to know the existence of each other. He asked the werewolves to take care of the preparation of the brand-new object of his collection.
“What? But there nothing here. Come on.” Dean could understand this guy. First, he was all 'We can't afford to waste time' and know he was blocked by an invisible wall?
Dean is bored and even if he wants Castiel’s sacrifice to be useful by living a normal life, life just is not easy without his best friend.
“Huh, thanks I guess?” The human looked at the stethoscope in his hands, still very confused about what just happened.
“Hum guys…?” Dean started, not really sure how to say that without sounded like he was crazy “There are Tinkerbell and her big brother watching me.” He still sounded like a complete idiot but at least that was clear enough.
In a short time, Dean scratched enough of the sigil paint on the door for Castiel's taste. The man asked Dean to move over and open the door leading to the sort of control office. He didn't have any more issues with it, so he started to make a few steps forward.
The two guards were two young girls, probably not older than Dean. One had beautiful blond long hair with big clear eyes and the second had pretty brown hair. They seem inoffensive enough. They didn’t have yellow eyes, long teeth, weird sulfur smell and nothing like a weird number of eyes. They seemed human enough so maybe they’re were human victims of the weird psycho just like him.
If looks could kill, Sam will already be dead but yeah, laugh while you can. Having the pie on his face doesn’t stop Dean to take his fork to his face to scratch the pie so he can taste it.
A strange guy stopped in front of his cell. He was wearing an ugly green suit with an even uglier weird bow tie. His hairs were neatly styled.
Now that he had the key, Dean just needed to find his new friend in this hell and get out of here together as fast as they can.
Dean could see the importance of stuff like band-aids and scalpels, but he really didn’t want to know why the angel thought that they would need some laxatives. ("Bowels movement are very important Dean")
Without anything better to do right now, the young man picked up the book he left on the table before. He settled down comfortably on the bed to continue his lecture about the hierarchy amongst werewolves and what differences between them existed to make “Alpha” socially more important than “Beta”.
“Easy my friend! You’re exactly where I wanted you to be. Now, I came here to see if you were settled and if you needed anything.” The guy sounded like he was talking to a child.
He heard one asking what he was reading to Sinclair and every pair of eyes turn their focus on his book. He used his pencil to write on one of his notebook pages with big letters before showing them:
Dean tried to ask Sam if he tried to contact Eileen but apparently, they just talk through texts. They didn’t try to see each other since the world almost end and Jack brought her back with all the other people Chuck Thanos-snapped.  Dean didn’t ask further questions.
I'm sorry for that long break between updates but life was a hectic this past two months and during my free time I just didn't have the energy to English anymore.
“You deserve the right to be an important piece of the greatest collection of the supernatural, Dean. Now, I think I’m needed elsewhere.” he said while taking his phone in his hand, “I must go but if you need anything, a book for example feel free to leave a note with your dishes after you ate. I will send my staff later to bring you your breakfast. You should go back to sleep now, you look tired and it’s still very early, goodbye Dean.”
“You should remove your clothes.” The angel turned around to face Dean with a stack of clothes in his hands. He looked at the human expectantly. The young man watched the clothes and slowly realized that it looked like the uniform the Teddy Bear Guard was wearing before.
When he couldn’t hear the voices anymore, he saved is page in order to continue to read later and slowly stood up. He walked carefully to the edge of the room to try to take a pick in the hallway, as if a sudden movement could cause Morgan le Fay’s army to come back.
Soon enough he found himself in the bathroom. A robotic voice coming from a speaker on the wall told him that he had 5 minutes before he would go back to the other cell. He remarked that above the door, there was a timer so that he could know how much time he had left.
I hope that you like today chapter, it's short and kind of a filer but I wanted to publish it anyway because I felt guilty just disappearing without saying anything.
He decided that he would stop hunting, just helping the other hunter like Bobby used to. All their contacts know to call them if they need to strengthen their FBI cover or just info from the lore (after all they still have the best books collection in the united states). Just like the call he had from a couple of hunters chasing people wearing weird masks who kidnapped kids and leave people tongue-less behind them. Turns out they were just vampires that their dad already hunted years back.
The plan was to draw the sigil on all the bands around his wrists and ankles and the collar to deactivate everything so Dean could try to run away, and only when he was free, try to remove everything else.
Like always Castiel seemed sure of himself so he took his razor blade and tried to scratch the thing on the door. It was a little difficult but soon Castiel was able to come in the hallway. The guy went straight ahead like nothing could stop him, before he was abruptly stopped when he saw the sigil on the door at the end of the hallway.
Just when that ugly-suit-Cuthbert-guy was going to finally make sense he was cut by the voice of a French singer coming from his phone “Non, rien de rien, non, je ne regrette rien…”
“He asks all the people who died helping you if we wanted to come back here or stay in heaven” add Charlie. “Your parents said they wanted to stay together and wait for you to welcome you when your times will come.”
Dean turned his head to face the glass wall, and he almost had a heart attack. On the pavement there was a couple of little kids. A brown hair boy who looked not older 8 years old was holding a little blond hair girl who looked like she was only 6. Both of them were looking at him with big eyes filled with awed.
Dean reaches out for his angel and puts his head on his chest using the angel as a pillow. That way he could hear his vessel’s heart beating and he was sure that Cas wouldn’t disappear in the middle of the night.
“Well, I think it’s just because it’s really expensive and I’m not sure if it’s something that hunters would spend their money. They are more used at identifying their prey by normal sight.” Castiel sounded slightly confused, like he didn’t know what Dean was talking about with his hunting, which was weird in Dean's opinion because Cas knew about the monster, so he knows about the hunter too, right?
Dean left his friend with his book. He found some pajama clothes next to his bed then push the button to the bathroom to prepare for bed. He took the notebook and a pencil with him to be sure to have them in the bathroom for the next morning. With his limited time, he didn’t really have time to look for the escape plan right now, and that way he wouldn't forget to bring them while sleepy in the morning.
Dean’s dream was abruptly cut by one of the worst wake up call he had since his father left. Still sleeping, his feet just projected him out of the bed.
The brown hair girl caught the arm of her friend just as she was throwing herself at Dean revealing sharp teeth and blue snake-like eyes. The hunter instinctively tried to dodge out of the way but: unmoving feet. At least Sammy wasn’t there to see him faceplanting on the floor.
“That sounds like a great book Dean. Do you have access to the vent trap? You can give it to me from there.”
“Hope you get your girl, Sammy.” That’s really the bare minimum that Sam deserves after all the things he did to save this world.
THAT was a response like he wanted! At least the second dude was starting to make sense! But wait… What did he just say?
He went to the plate in the middle of the room. It’s smelled great and his stomach was growling so why not taste it? After all, he already ate stuff they gave him here and he wasn’t sick after. And if the Sinclair-dude wanted him dead, he could just have unleashed his monster on him while he was unarmed and it will be quick enough. This plate smelled soooo good!
He stood slowly and walk toward the tray. He found a big water bottle, some snacks, a piece of cake and a big plate greasy bacon, some eggs and even some pancakes. The smell was heavenly, but he couldn’t touch it. He was already stupid enough to fall asleep in this weird place, he’s sure as hell not going to eat the contents of that weird plate. He just couldn’t believe that he didn’t wake up when somebody open the door to leave that here. If his father was still in the picture, he would kick his ass for that fact and for thinking of eating that food.
They open the door again and Castiel walk first in. The angel didn’t try to be discreet and just storm in there so Dean didn’t bother either. The angel arrived next to the snoring guard and stopped next to him, on the guard right.
The place was just gigantic, and all corridors looked the same to the human. Dean did a lot of confused noises when he saw another hallway looking just like the first fives that they have passed. Castiel had to explain to him in a whisper that even so Sinclair was an incredible magician who could make big indoor places fit into small indoor places TARDIS-style, he didn’t have a lot of imagination for the decorative part of things. To be honest, the two of them were just very lucky that their diversion worked very well. The only guard they saw was just a running kid who looked even more lost than them (must be a newbie).
Dean tried to see the guard but it was impossible behind the wings. He tried to put his hands on the angel shoulder and push just hoping that the guy will just understand that he couldn’t see anything and just bend his knees or something. Of course, the guy didn’t get the memo and Dean pushed so hard, bringing force with his legs, that he ended doing so weird gym above the guy's wings. Seriously the angel was like a horizontal bar.
“If you try anything funny, it would be the last thing you’ll ever do.” Dean tried to sound threatening, but it was pretty difficult when your only weapon is a razor blade in your pocket and your hands are slightly shaking.
He didn’t know how much time has passed since he arrived here, but he thought that he didn’t have a lot of alone time remaining. He used it to try to find an exit, but the door was firmly closed, and the ventilation system was just a little thing that could count as an exit only if you were the size of a fly.
First of all, apparently angels were real. Well, at least that’s what the crazy guy just said, but he also said that Dean was supposed to be an angel condom or something apparently... That was just bullshits. If there were angels somewhere, why didn’t they do anything to stop the demon that killed his mom? She used to say that angel were watching over him when he was a kid, but if they’re real, why didn’t he heard of them before? No hunter ever talked about angelic omens or anything. Hell, even Bobby never mention a book about angel and every respectable hunter knows that he’s basically the best living supernatural library you could ever dream of.
Dean shouted some colorful insults to his attention, but nobody seemed to be able to hear him. His annoying neighbor wasn’t saying anything anymore even if the young man was screaming louder than ever.
“I’m sorry I couldn’t stop by myself this morning,” it was that ugly-bow-tie dude voice, “but every morning you will have access to that room to do what you have to do to be presentable. You have half an hour before you will go back to your room.”
He took a quick shower and because that morning sucked so much he was done and ready for the day with the clothes he found on the shelves in less than ten minutes. The young man spent the 20 minutes he still had to write everything he could see in his notebook as Castiel asked him yesterday. Bless past-Dean to have bring it yesterday.
“Umh, yeah, that what I said.” Dean didn’t understand why this seems to be the information that Claire focused on.
Dean wants to tell him that there no such thing as angels, but the big wings just continue moving behind him. There were way too real to deny their existence. But seriously? Angels?
“I miss you, Cas. I’m sorry that I wasn’t capable of responding to you that day, and that I wasn’t able to say what I’m about to say sooner” Dean knows that he’s taking his time, but he needs to think about what he’s talking.
“Are you hurt or are you eating again?” The poor guy sounded so confused and worry it made Dean smile and swallow his food. He’s kind of glad that the table is not far from the wall and he doesn’t have to yell to talk to Cas because he really doesn’t want Metatron talking to him again. And the fact that they could talk far away from the glass wall was great because speaking so low, they couldn’t be heard from the pavement.
“Your kid happened.” Bobby starts explaining, “he’s doing some reconstruction in heaven with his angels. He said that the old god just killed us for shock value. That our deaths were just for his little personal pleasure to see you both sad and give something that he could use for his storyline.”
What he didn’t expect was to find a white bathroom with a toilet in a corner, a shower in the opposite corner, and a sink with a toothbrush and toothpaste.
“Yeah, I need to pass a weird corridor to go there but they’re a spell to take me there. Apparently, I’ll have access to it for thirty minutes every morning and five if I push a bouton.”
“We need to gather everything that could be useful and try to fit everything in the guard backpack. Take first aid supplies and everything that you think you could turn into a weapon.” Castiel said that without hesitation and started to open the different closets.
If you like it please leave a comment or a kudos, it means a lot to me and motivates me to write more!!
The young man's eyes were darting between Castiel's eyes and his back while his face lost all his color. Behind the guy, he could see an enormous set of completely dark wings. How did he miss them?!  There was the most beautiful and scariest thing he ever saw!
“What’s wrong? He's sleeping! Just go!” Dean was becoming quite impatient to move already! He was now whisper-yelling just in Castiel's ear because apparently, personal space wasn’t an issue when it was for moving this gargoyle of a man.
Ugly-bowtie-Sinclair was leading the crowd and gather them in front of Dean’s cell. He was making some big movement to the crowd, like some weird touristic guide.
Defeated and still exhausted because of whatever they used on him to knock him out, Dean turn back to the bed. He took off his shoes and flannel shirt but keep his pants and shirt just in case. He got under the cover, the pillow feeling weird under his head without a weapon under it.
Okay, so the dude who kidnapped him was a very religious weirdo. Dean had absolutely no idea why he was here. He clearly is more a sinner than an angel, and he doesn’t remember a time when he did a prayer since his mom died when he was just a child.
Cluberth? Or whatever his name was, started again like he forgot something “You probably already realized that the toilet in your room is fake. It hides a small button that you can push so that you can come here for 5 minutes. And know that there his now camera here, I value your privacy. I will see you soon Dean.”
Today is a new day! Everything from yesterday will stay in the past and now it’s time to look at the present. At least that what Dean told himself when he woke up a little later in the morning. He felt way better than before. His head didn’t hurt him anymore.
First, he tried to listen to any noise anyone could make but he didn’t hear anything. Then, the young man took the risk to look around. The door opened in what seemed like a big circular room with various doors everywhere. Most of those doors had a little sign with what was probably a name on it.
When he was done, the angel just dropped his hand, like he didn’t just break every personal space rules Dean could find. He seemed glad about his work and tell the human that.
Dean finished his little monologue, not as glorious as the one Cas did, but it just feels so good to have it out of his chest. Cas is beaming at him and slowly Dean approaches him so their lips can meet. It’s sweet and tender, just expressing all their love in this small gesture.
Dean carefully stood up after he made sure that he was truly alone in the room. He crossed the small distance straight to the pavement but was brutally stopped just a couple of steps before it by something that look like a very thick Plexiglas wall.
Using toothpicks he found in a drawer while doing his inventory the last day, he started the drawing on his collar while watching himself in the mirror. because he clearly didn’t want to think of a magic leash that could restrain him. He used a few drops of blood on the sink to use as ink.
“I still don’t know if I want to continue hunting but, in any case, I’m going to give myself a break from all this. Probably going to see Eileen. Now that there is no God to dictate our action, ask her if she wants to try something between us.”
At least, Dean could see that the teddy guard that he has seen earlier was still peacefully sleeping in front of his screen.
For now, he had decided to let him in his own clothes because he noticed that it was something that had calm a lot of the other individuals of his collection when they opened their eyes for the first time in their cells.
That’s how Dean found himself, his brother, and his loyal little Miracle driving the Impala in the direction of pies. It’s not even for a case, but Sam doesn’t need to know that.
He had time but he didn’t know how long exactly so he started with important stuff which could be useful like the razor he found in a drawer. He wanted to put that in his pocket right away, but he feared that if Sinclair knew he took it he would search his cell and the hunter wouldn’t have access to it anymore.
Dean doesn’t know how to ask politely what is in his mind, so he just blurts: “You don’t know your girlfriend?”
Dean moved to the side to try to see more stuff, but all he could detect was more paintings and sculptures. He really didn’t give two shit about art, even if he really like the beauty of the sword in front of him. All the stuff he could see was picturing angel and heaven things.
Now with the knowledge that the spell was working it was time to activate phase 3 of their plan: get to Castiel and get away from here!
They passed a lot of doors and other hallways. Dean was completely lost and could not remember the path they took. The young man couldn’t go back to his cell even if his life depends on it. But Castiel was sure of the path he took apparently. The young man didn’t know what to think about it, he wasn’t used to relying on other people but they’re no way he could have got that far without the angel. Said angel that said he already tried to escape but without going far.
“Dean? Thank god! I really thought this number was disconnected!” Charlie excited and relived voice sound in his ears.
“You can call me Metatron, but that’s not important right now. I just found you uncharacteristically quiet. I imagine that you may ask yourself why Sinclair wants you contented, so I just wanted to warn you. The fun part will begin soon.”
But now, finding that key for Castiel’s chains sounded a little difficult. He looked around, imaging that an old looking key would be hanging on the wall beside the door. It was worth a shot since everything was so cliché so far but no. Life wasn’t a bad movie.
I hope I didn't burn your eyes with weird typos and that everything was understandable. I should probably not be editing when I'm this tired.
That sounded like a great idea. That way, as a dog, he would be completely entangled before he could even try to follow them.
He was still tired as hell and apparently completely trap in that weird room. He didn’t have a lot of things he could do because his headache was making everything quite fuzzy and he couldn’t think about what was happening to him. He chooses to lay in this bed a little in hope that could help his head.
But that wasn’t the weirdest part. The thing that had made Dean speechless was the wings they were sporting. Both sets were iridescent and glittery, but the boy’s ones were more of a yellow shades and the girl’s a red one.
“HOLLY SHIT!” The male voice startled Dean and made him turn around using his chair in front of him like a weapon.
On the bed, was sitting, facing him, the guy with the bluest blue eyes he never saw. Those eyes were looking at him like they could see his soul and Dean was hypnotized by them.
Dean took a look around just to be sure there was no camera. The guy didn’t lie at least. He saw a small piece of furniture with two shelves. The one closer to the floor were a “dirty laundry” tag and the one on top a “clean clothes” tag. There was a boxer, socks, and a black t-shirt with a black pants.
Dean slowly took a few steps towards the right wall, the one with the second guy who sounded a little more on his side. The kids never stopped looking at him.
Dean open the compartment carefully and took the key. Everything went smoothly and the guard wasn’t disturbed in his nap. But really, an asteroid crashing behind him would probably not wake him.
“You will find out soon enough.” Well isn’t that ominous… Apparently the guy didn’t believe in the power of nice straight answers.
When the 5 minutes where finished, Dean’s feet were magically bound again while the door opened. They quickly made him cross the hallway to return to his usual cell. He looked at the other door at the end of it, wondering how he could find a way to get to the other side. Now with a friend, he was sure it was just a question of time before he found out how to get there.
And if you want to talk to me, I'm on twitter @Mikey_Ran ! I'll love to speak to anybody who watches the show even if I'm awkward and shy!
The angel stopped in front of a normal-looking door that looked just like all the other in this building. He opened it like he owned the place and dragged the human inside without closing the door behind them.
Dean was preparing a smart comeback when a little flute melody resonated in his room. His binding started to glow. In a second, his hands were linked behind his back and both his ankles felt like tied together. He could move neither his limbs. He was standing like an idiot in the middle of the room, facing the weird door-wall with the remains of his chair around him.
But since I selfishly write this story for myself first, I choose to not put so much pressure on me.
“You know Dean, even if it’s pained me to say so, he probably is right.” Castiel, always the pragmatic one said with a lower volume level. “But you’re right, your place isn’t here. We need to find a way to get you out.”
He moved his hands along the glass and find out very fast that there was no opening in it that he could reach. There was a little space of approximately 4 inches just on top of the wall.
Castiel nodded and obeyed the young man. He placed the guy in the center of the bed then turn his laser focus on Dean and stared. Okay… No pressure then.
His feet started to move without his own accord. They dragged him towards the door and even if he was happy to move from that room, he hated that he couldn’t move freely and couldn’t defend himself.
There was no breakfast and no new exit. And unfortunately, there was nowhere where he could empty his bladder because there was no way he was going to use the thing with the folding screen. That thing looked like made of polystyrene and the screen was way too transparent, thank you very much.
Cas turned and look at Dean expectantly, waiting for him to go in there first. Guess it’s the infirmary then.
“He’s even more stupid than I thought…” Metatron sounded weary and completely done with this conversation.
It was a little disturbing doing so with a reversed image that was a little sloppy, but he quickly finished his task. Time was of the essence, so he continued to draw the sigil on both cuffs on his ankles. Then he draws the one on his left wrist while his hand was clutching around a tissue to stop the bleeding.
Dean followed the instructions he was given. The sigil needed to be drawn in blood so he cut the palm of his left hand with a razor blade to do just that, just after stuffing the pocket of his jeans with sterile pads, antiseptic and all sorts of bandage for later. Drawing in blood should sound completely crazy, but then again, blood magic was known to be one of the most powerful sources of magic so it sounded kind of logic for the young hunter.
Dean got himself six different kinds of pie to try and he walks back to his brother, just saving the pie from getting smash by a guy who doesn’t even look where he’s walking.
Dean supposed that the door wasn’t locked just like his, but he couldn’t just go in there first. Castiel said that he needed to find a key because unlike Dean, the bounds he had around his ankles were chained to a wall. The other man said Sinclair did that because it wasn’t his first attempt to escape. That means if Dean was caught, the next escape plan will be more complicated because his security will be reinforced. But that wouldn’t happen because he was not going to get caught, Dean was sure of it. After all, the first step to succeeding in a plan was to believe in the plan. Right?
Dean explained his plan to Castiel briefly. The other man agreed but said that he will still knock the guard out before doing anything. Safety measures and all that. Dean agreed because it’s fair and it’s still better than death.
Against the wall opposite Dean, there was what looked like a workstation with several computers. The hunter tried to take a look at the screen but from his point of view, he could see what looked like a stupid Facebook game and a live stream of the camera in the cells. The quality of the image was an awful pixelated black and white thing. Honestly, Dean just guess it was the security camera because the layout just looked like it came from a spy movie. From this far, it was almost impossible for him to detect a human shape on those screens.
“Did you find a way to stop the weird please-hold-my-hand-while-I-take-you-to-the-bathroom spell, or am I going to support that every day ‘til we get out of here?”
He left his stuff in the bottom shelf knowing that he maybe will never saw them again. He didn’t really care because now his t-shirt had a hole and his jean was slightly ripped. The only thing in one piece was his flannel shirt that he left in the other room.
The hunter raised his fist and knocked on the wall. He wasn’t hoping for a response and even if he got one, they couldn’t talk without hearing or even seeing each other. But even if Dean would never admit it, he was a little spooked about that whole zoo-situation, and he really needed someone friendly to talk to. Everything around here was just too weird and too intense to deal alone.
“Your body has needs!” That’s was that enthusiastic tone like earlier. It was weird to hear because Dean was becoming used to that robot voice of him. “They need to let you have access to a bathroom and I know that you don’t have one in your cell.”
“You want to kill the poor guy? But he didn’t do anything! He’s probably just under a spell or forced to be here!” Dean was raised to think that if you see a monster you shoot first and ask questions later but here, he started questioning himself about that ideology. It's something his brother and father always have disagreements about and teaming up with someone with feathers sprouting of his back makes you think a little about the definition of what is good or bad. If he wanted to get out of here, he needed to think that maybe all monsters weren’t bad. And something about killing this soft looking guard without hearing him first felt wrong.
Anyway, know that I'm sorry that I took so long and that I'm really thankful to anyone who took the time to read my work! Thank you so much! <3
“We? You’re going to help me?” The young hunter was hopeful because even if the other one believed the crazy stuff the witch was saying, he really was in need of some help.
With that, she threw her stethoscope at Dean and bolted out of the room like her life depends on it. She left behind her a stunned Dean and a Castiel who look at the human like he was proud of him.
“Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to my Heaven area!” Sinclair’s voice was loud and clear, so Dean didn’t have anything to do besides listening to him.
Then he brushed his teeth, savoring the flavor of fresh mint. He was still angry to be here, but he felt so much better now that he was clean and smelling good.
“Yes. But I never have the chance to get far while I was on my own. But I may have the beginning of an idea.”
The young man was about to scream something hoping that he would finally have some answers if he was loud enough, when he felt eyes boring in his head.
The young man, future star of is next exhibit, was still unconscious on a mattress at the opposite of the room. He was facing the door. The spell the collector used on him will make sure he stayed that way for at least a couple more hours. His right hand and his left foot were enchained to the wall behind him, and he was also wearing a collar and cuffs on his other limbs.
Before he knew it, Dean found himself in the middle of the room, facing the door without control of his limbs while a small flute music was heard escaping the loudspeaker in a corner.
Just a fair warning : this was written and edited way too late. So if you find a huge mistake my midnight editing missed, please tell me in the comments!
“Dude wasn’t really making any sense last night. All I know is that he’s a collector or something and that I was his “pied de restance” whatever that mean. But I don’t know what he wanted to say by that! And who are you? How do you know my name, by the way?”
Then he just walked away. Like that. Like it was a right explanation as to why Dean was there. And Dean was just there staring. And then he was back to plan the murder of that Cuthbert-guy. Stabbing him in the gut sounds like a good start in his imagination.
He took a long run-up and swing the chair in the door. The noise from the impact could probably be heard a few miles away and only the back of the chair was still in his hands.
The moon was high in the sky when the door creaked open slowly. A man took a few steps in the hallway and stopped in front of a window where he could watch inside a very small room. He had brown hair and brown eyes and was probably in his late thirties.
Everything in his body seems to be waking up far too slowly. He didn’t hear anything that could tell him that he wasn’t alone, so Dean slowly rolled on the bed to watch the room.
I started working on the next chapter but finals weeks are coming at uni so I probably will not have the time nor the energy to English, so I'm sorry but it will come in probably at least 2 weeks.
I want to apologize for these few months without updates... Irl's life was crazy has a healthcare student during a pandemic at the end of the school year was filled with internships and finals. Then, because I've got no self preservations, I choose to do a summer job in a hospital. Even my colleagues tell me that I'm crazy :)
“I’m behind the screen, I can’t come closer.” Judging by the deep voice that had responded, Castiel wasn’t afraid to be heard by anyone.
“It appears that I can’t pass the door.” The dark-haired man narrowed his eyes at the door like it personally offended him.
“This angel hurt his wing and he needed to come here so someone could take a look at it” Dean tried to sound like he knew what he was talking about and not just like he was trying not to shit his pants.
Dean let his head fall against the door with a thud. He will find a way to get away from here. He was quietly trying to make an inventory of his option when his nose caught a delicious smell and his stomach starting to growl.
Like he saw last night, there was a pavement just in front of him. On the other side of it he could see a big bronze statue in some weird alcove. On a pedestal, he could see something that look like an angel with the halo and the wings. The dude had a full medieval armor from the boots to the helmet. He was branding a sword to slay a small dragon climbing the pedestal. The statue was beautiful, everything made of bronze except for the sword. The light was just striking the sword, creating a beautiful contrast and made the weapon shining with a pure white color. The sword was highlighted by the color, clearly the important piece of the sculpture.
Thanks a lot to the persons who commenting while I wasn't there, you give me so much motivation back to continue this story! <3
“I’m not sad-Sam.” The look Dean gives him just told him that he don’t believe any of his bullshit. “I’m just… I’m thinking about Cass, and Jack… I’m thinking about being here.”
“Oh, you're bringing me lunch! That’s so nice of you” even if he couldn’t move his feet right away, he tried to bring his famous Winchester-smile hoping that maybe they had a way to let him move.
Back straight, head held high and with an air of confidence on his face, the young hunter was pushing his prisoner to the infirmary. In reality, Dean didn’t have any idea what he was doing and Castiel was often pretending to fall so he could redirect them in the right direction.
Dean put a small kiss on Cas’ lips before going to lay under the cover. Cas started to go sit on the chair Dean had next to his bed when Dean did a small sound of disagreement. The angel looks at him to see him patting the bed next to him in invitation.
“Do you see somebody on the pavement outside? Do you think I can come?” Dean wanted to be sure that the way was clear before coming and risking ruining their plan foolishly.
Castiel said he wanted to knock him out so Dean expected him to just give him a big blow on the head, but apparently, that wasn’t the idea. Castiel just put his index and middle fingers above the guard sternal notch and pressed hard. The guard's eyes open wide with a 'What the hell is going on' expression, so Castiel pressed harder and the guy just lost consciousness from the lack of oxygen.
Thanks a lot for reading and please if you have time to leave a comment or a kudos, it's always very appreciated!
So, there was a bed, that was pretty obvious in the middle of the room. There was a little bookshelf with a dozen books. He found a desk with a few pencils and notebooks. There was also a little folding screen with a toilet behind it.
Every hallway basically had a piece of art on a wall that was put to fit the theme of the zoo part. Just like they were a few angels painting where they came from. Castiel said he knew the way because he memorized the different paintings that they had to pass in front of. Dean had no idea if this was because he had to go to the infirmary a lot or just because the guy had an awesome memory. After all, he was an angel. Since Dean didn’t know the extent of Castiel power the young man couldn’t define which options scared him the most.
Dean had awful wakeups calls before. After all, with a hunter as a father, he had some “exercise” early in the morning. You need to be ready fast if a rugaru or a werewolf say hello in the middle of the night.
For the curious people around here, the statue described in front of Dean is called “Saint Michel terrassant le dragon” from Emmanuel Fremiet but it's the bronze version that you can find in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and not the golden one from Mont-Saint-Michel.
The show isn't very popular in my country (well it's more that nobody I know seems to have heard about it), so I would love to speak to fellows fans online! I'm super shy but please don't hesitate to come talk to me <3
If everything worked, they should be far away when bedtime will come tonight and he couldn't be more hopeful.
“I’m just eating. Some monster-chicks just brought me dinner.” Saying that out loud, he realized that he had missed something. “Is it already dinner time? I only had breakfast!”
Dean pushed the door slowly to enter the cell of his friend. He just took a look inside the room but a folding screen just behind the door didn’t let him see a lot of things. The screen wasn’t totally opaque, but the young man could just see black stuff on the other side, without any real shape visible.
I should probably read everything to make sure I didn't lose myself somewhere but to be honest, reading my own stuff makes me cringe so I'm just going to hope for the best right now...
Castiel put his hand on Dean’s back, just feeling his human warm skin next to his own. Dean felt a warm sensation enveloping him when Cas put his invisible wings -remade by Jack- on his back.
The young man took a few careful steps inside the room. He looked on his left and see the name “Castiel” and the number 2 on the next door. The name was written in small letters under a much larger word that Dean couldn’t read because it wasn’t in any language he knew. He wasn’t even sure if he already saw that alphabet before in his life.
His vision was a bit troubled, but he could see very clearly that his wrists and ankles were wearing some big metal bound. He moved his hand to his neck and yes, he was wearing a heavy collar to. He was facing a wall of what looks like your regular small cabin lost in the mountain. He was lying on a twin bed with fancy looking sheets and the light behind his back there was a small lamp on a bedside table.
This time, Dean didn’t get his answer right away. When he started to think that maybe his friend was already tired of him, Cas spoke like he had an illumination.
Dean felt crushed by a wall of feathers in his face and with a shelf or something digging in his hip. Castiel used a switch on the wall to turn on the light. The young man realized that the angel rushed him in a small closet, like the protagonist in a bad teen movie.
He didn’t want to make that phrase into a question, but he stretched the sentence a little too long under the angel gaze.
I’m sorry that I took so much time but my computer die just when I could take some time to write… But now, I'm back with a new chapter which is a little shorter than the others but it's a transition that needed to be done. I’m already working on the next chapter but because I’m back in school I don’t know how long I’m going to need to finish it.
Dean took a careful step back, resisting the tempting plate. Trying not to listen to his stomach who was growling “Eat the damn thing!!” he turned around to watch what he could see from the strange window-wall.
He didn’t know exactly how much time he had left so he started drawing the one on his right handcuff. That’s was probably the hardest one because Dean clearly wasn’t left-handed.
Castiel looked young. Older than Dean but not by much. Maybe 26? He was dress in black pants and a weird toga looking shirt. His dark hair was a mess. He was wearing socks and as expected, his left foot was chained to the wall just next to the bed with a small chain.
Dean just blinked under the dissecting gazes. He wasn’t sure if he understood everything about what the guy just said. Right now, he couldn’t care less, he just wanted all those weird guys to stop staring at him! There even was a child around 5 who just jump against the glass to try to come to Dean, producing a big “bong” before he was reprimanded by his mother. The hunter didn’t though he will be happy about the existence of that wall before.
That was kind of crazy that he trusted this guy so much. After all, he met him only yesterday and he didn’t even saw him. But he was the only nice guy around here who talk to Dean like he was a person and not some kind of freaky animal that you want to observe. And Cas was really motivated to leave this place with Dean and clearly, that was a good point in Dean’s eyes.
Dean’s face just loses all his color and he can only crack a little word “How…?”  He would love to ask more intelligent things, but he can only do his best fish interpretation at the moment.
Dean could understand the need to be careful, so he did as he was told and carefully slid his precious note through the trap of the ventilation system.
Please, note that this story isn't and never will be an A/B/O story, I just used it at the beginning of the chapter for characterization reason.
The lock and the chain where gone, Castiel was now left with the same four cuffs that Dean had. Castiel noticed how Dean stared at the symbol drew on them.
Dean would love nothing more to show Cas how much he loves him, but he feels too exhausted tonight. And Cas must see this too.
I everyone! I'm so terribly sorry that I disappear for so long... At first, I didn't have time to write because of college kicking my butt, then I had my English finals and started doubting myself a lot. You know that English isn't my first language, I probably said that at the beginnings of all my chapters, but I'm still afraid that what I write isn't understandable. Especially since I write in the evenings when I'm tired because it's the only moment I have time.
When he came back, the sun was down so he took his book to read on the bed until his eyes were too heavy to continue. He killed the light and try to find some sleep, hoping that tomorrow at the same time, Castiel and him will be far away from this place.
He left is bed to start his search of an exit way he could have missed in his state of grogginess yesterday. He was also hungry so why not to go looking for that promised breakfast.
“Since we were killed by hellhound we ended up in hell” Dean is horrified by what Jo is saying but he doesn’t stop her explanation, “apparently your Jack talk to the Queen of Hell, she agrees to let us go to heaven like we deserve or bring us back here and live our life but risking going back under if we do something that will deserve such treatment. Of course, we choose to come back here with a clean slate.” Elle gives a soft hug to her daughter.
The sigil he needed to do was some weird little circle with what appeared to be Enochian letters, according to Castiel the language of angels. Dean never heard of what was Enochian before, but his neighbor was so sure of himself that Dean trusted him, and really, it was his only chance to get away from here, so he didn’t have anything to lose while trying that.
“This bathroom could be our way to leave this place, Dean. When you go there tomorrow, you need to note every little detail every object of that bathroom that we could use.” Dean already had the same idea. After all, there has to be a way out but that corridor.
“Well, when you take your time thinking about that, I’m going to find that restroom button.” With that, Dean walked to the other side of his room where the weird fake toilet was. He pressed the button hoping that, like he’s been told, it would let him go to the bathroom.
“Yeah, that makes sense, I think. And how can you forget the food dude? Food is life!” That sentence was said with great enthusiasm before he remained his task of inhaling is plate.
Castiel removed his clothes to stay in his underwear, like he used to sleep when he was human, and slip under the cover next to his charge.
“She was a werewolf Dean. By saying there was a problem with them you just give her the perfect reason to leave us alone here. That was truly intelligent.”
Dean wakes up groaning because he really never was a morning person and even after saving the world, mornings still feel like hell. A happy bark resonates in the hallway before Dean is attacked by a big fluffy and happy dog. Dean hugs Miracle to his chest, just happy that Jack brought him back to him.
The Sinclair-guy was probably some rich psycho who used his money to kidnapped human to show around supernatural creatures. After all, Dean was just a normal guy and it’s not like the fairies could have verified anything the guy said to them. And the kids were happy to see a boring human, the hunter guessed that for them it wasn’t something they used to see every day. The lore about fairies was clear that the fairies was for the biggest part a peaceful species who used to live hidden from the world.
I wanted to have a regular schedule, apparently I can't. Real life and especially the end of my internship kicked my ass. But here I am with a new chapter and I will be working for another for next week!
“Yeah, but no,” Claire responded. “For now, I’m just a nursing student but I’m the only person Sinclair found who wasn’t human so here I am, trying to study.”
“Dean, behind that door we will go in a long hallway. We need to go stealthy, so we don’t attract the guards' attention. They probably still trying to calm the vampire/werewolf situation but if they hear us they will come looking for us.”
Dean was looking at the man in front of him with wide eyes and an open-mouthed. If a fly was there, he’d probably have caught it. Without any idea of what was in front of him, he didn’t know if he should be impressed or if he just should turn over and run as fast as he can.
There was a young girl in a white gown behind a desk looking like she was bored. Or maybe it was just her resting face because she couldn’t look older than Dean and young 20-something often look like they were bored out of there mind. She was blond with bright blue eyes which were currently looking at Dean up and done while judging him.
He just stared at him, like he was analyzing his breathing pattern or something. Dean arrived and put himself on the opposite side of the guard to try to block him in case he wakes up.
“You really believed what’s that crazy guy saying about Heaven? The guy just a lunatic with a superiority complex. I don’t care if he’s some kind of super-witch, but one way or another, I’m getting out of here.” Dean practically yelled the last sentence as if it will give him a sudden illumination. The truth is that he really didn’t have the beginning of a plan, but maybe if you sound confident enough one will come to him. Right?
He closed the door with his key and left the ward with a happy loving smile. After all this time, he finally had the Michael sword in his collection!
“I think that makes sense, but why I am here? Do those creatures never saw a regular guy before? And if the visitors are supernatural guys, don’t they care to see their peers on the other side of the glass?”
Of course, they would be vetalas. Those scary snake-like monsters were known to hunt by pairs and to be very protective of their master when enslaved. They were no way that Dean could charm his way out of here with them. And he couldn’t hope to kill them and run in the corridor because he didn’t have any silver knife.
He found himself in a small white hallway. It was completely empty except for a little security camera in a corner. There were only two automatic doors. The first one was at the end of the hallway and the second was on the left wall.
“You’re welcome, dude. Now I’m just going to the bathroom really quick to prepare for the night, then I’m going to sleep so I talk to you tomorrow. ‘Night, man.”
Even if Dean didn’t exactly know their purpose, he took a few careful steps and when nothing happened, he just looked around to find the same camera that he found in his own hallway. The young man wasn’t so stressed to be caught since apparently, the big bear wasn’t going to wake up anytime soon.
It’s after dinner and the brothers are together on dishes duty while their friends discover their new rooms or rediscover their old for Kevin. They all needed some rest after all the emotions that coming back from the dead give you.
“So that’s the fun part I was talking about. That’s what happened when you’re in a zoo, dummy. And apparently today is fairy day.”
“I never saw any regular camera in the compound before. I think it’s a thermal camera like the rest of them. Sinclair uses them to see the movement of his personal and it’s really useful to differentiate a vampire from a ghoul per example. Every monster that you now use a really specific heat signature. When you are used to recognizing them it’s really easy to classify a monster.”
Dean needed to try something. He was not going to spend a day in here! Sure, trying to open the door in the wall didn’t work when he projected his shoulder, so he needed to try again. He took one of the chairs at the table. In the worst case, he didn’t need two after all…
Dean decided to continue his conversation with his apparently nice neighbor, the one who didn’t try to insult him every sentence. The guy probably was just another victim of the psycho, but he probably had more experiences about all that. Maybe he could tell Dean if the visit from monsters really was a daily event around here and maybe he had answers like why the Sinclair-guy had such a weird address book.
“Jack needed my help to rebuild heaven” he lowers his head and looks at his hand in front of him, a human sign for nervousness that Dean found so endearing. “And I didn’t know if you wanted to see me again.”
Castiel went to the chair the guard occupied before and move it to the side. He bends a knee and retrieved a backpack under the desk.
But unfortunately, before Dean could do anything to attract his friend's attention, soft flute music resonates in his cell again. It wasn’t the same as the one he heard before his first bathroom trip this morning.
His poor neighbor sounded really confused and a little worried, so Dean swallowed to be heard a little more clearly.
Now wide awake and close to the heart attack, the young man was walking toward the corridor. His head felt a little fuzzy after standing up this quickly. The door opened in front of him and a few steps after he found himself in the bathroom watching his own wide eyes face in the mirror while clutching to the sink with both hands trying to stay upright and understand what just happened.
As always English isn't my first language so don't hesitate to help me do better by telling me if you spot any big mistake that burns your eyes! (I probably should stop my habits to edit late...)
Anyway, don't hesitate to leave me a comment or a kudo, they give me so much motivation for this story!
“No, it’s an angelic name. And I know yours because, as I said before, you are known in Heaven. And Sinclair told us that you were coming here.”
Dean was lying on his bed. He was trying to learn the sigils that Castiel did in his notebook. He had ripped the page with them and was studying them while pretending to read his book about werewolves and their differents categories that he had already finished.
The new specimen was really beautiful. He could see that they take care of giving him a bath, wash his hair and dispose of that beginning of beard that he collector despises.
The young man groans softly as the voice of his friend slowly faded away. He tried to turn away but, again, because of a new spell his stupid feet didn’t want to cooperate.
