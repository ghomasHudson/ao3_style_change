Dean glared at the room, his confusion clear as he had no idea where the hell he was and what this place held. Held seemed like the appropriate word. He tried to examine his surroundings.  While the place was a bit aged, it was functional, and even with the weirdest of every surface covered with the symbols, there didn’t seem to be any personal items of any kind.
“Cas…I’m right here. Open your eyes. Let me see those pretty blues looking at me...please, Cas,” Dean whispered against his love, as the Omega stirred and mewled against him while he fought whatever was happening in his mind.
Crowley cleared his throat. “Well, he has the necessary four members backing him up to be taken seriously by the Elders. He’s contesting your role as Head Alpha, because you haven’t claimed Bela, who is viewed as Head Omega, and you’ve ‘replaced’ her with an unworthy Omega. He’s claiming that you are not fit to continue leading. In short, he wants to do this barbaric dance with you to get Bela and be Head Alpha,” Crowley finished as he rolled his eyes.
Dean watched them leave, his calculating eyes never wavering from the threat, and his wolf roared, wanting to jump out and chase the petite brunette until she was gone. He felt a gentle hand on his back, and all the pent up fury inside of him seemed to evaporate with that single touch from Castiel… He instantly felt calm and a warmth surged through him. As he turned to look down at the pretty Omega and those beautiful blue eyes gazed up at him, he realized the happy feeling was coming from Castiel through the bond. Dean couldn’t help the dopey side-smile that graced his face as Castiel smiled up at him.
Castiel nodded numbly. Too eager and in a daze just from feeling his husband's hands upon him, demanding, groping and caressing as instinct urged the Omega to scramble up onto the bed and present. With slick already easing from his hole, he buried his face in the pillows as Dean kneeled behind him. The heat that came from his Alpha’s skin, the scent of his arousal and the touch of his large hands on his flank made the Omega keen. It had been much too long and a distant voice reminded him it was his fault for always being away, yet he pushed away the voice and frantically keened for his Alpha, arched his back and spread his legs just so that had Dean growling in approval.
Castiel groaned and felt completely stupid for his reaction and Kevin’s words only reminded him that yes, Dean was infuriatingly handsome.
His eyes hadn’t left the flames, so he hadn’t noticed the large circle of people or the suspicious and confused looks directed his way. Castiel was surrounded by the whole of the Winchester Pack, hundreds of members had gathered to mourn… Adam is—no,
Jimmy smiled sadly at the old man. Rufus was like a father to him, and he had always found his help and advice to be invaluable. Despite being a gruff and short-tempered man, when it came to Jimmy, he was a bit softer around the edges.
Charlie closed her mouth abruptly and then smiled at him sheepishly. “Look, Dean is a pretty oblivious guy, but it's not totally his fault. I’ve known Dean practically my whole life and like I said, almost anyone he comes across is attracted to him. And, well, he seems to either be able to just ignore the aroused scents, or it just doesn’t register to him unless it's someone he’s with. But yeah Cas, Dean cares about you, he mother hens you and Lily because you are his. So you two moving your relationship into something more intimate wouldn’t exactly shock anyone,” she teased, but when she saw Castiel’s shoulders sag, she bit her lower lip and tried again. “You’ve never talked much about Adam, and I can understand that it may feel ‘wrong’ because Dean is his brother, but you’ve told me yourself Adam viewed Dean as a hero, and I’d like to think that Adam would want you to be happy too. Falling in love with his brother sounds crazy cliche, but this isn’t some raunchy Omega novel... You are mated to a man that’s a genuinely good person and Alpha. Stopping yourself from pursuing more, over technicalities that quite honestly don’t matter at the core of the situation, is just you making yourself miserable.”
“Nooooo!” Michael cried as he rushed Dean, a small blade glinting in his hands. Surprised yelps came from the crowd, and Bela screamed, horrified. Michael’s cowardice only served to enrage Dean more, and he caught the desperate man by the neck and snapped it in one swift movement. A nauseating silence followed as the knife fell from Michael’s limp grasp before Dean released him. The body dropped, its dead-weight thumping on the green grass in the remaining rays of the setting sun. None of this gave Dean pleasure. It only made him feel grief. This had been senseless and the man hadn’t even fought with pride, instead he’d brought a weapon. Dean felt numb and out of sorts at ending his life. The wrath that had awakened at the prospect of a real fight had turned into disdain and he still felt… twisted with disappointment. Dean paced irritably while Jody and Jo checked on Michael, pronouncing him and calling the coroner's office to transport the body.
“Very much so,” came the sleep-husky voice of his Alpha, and Castiel glanced up quickly to see him slip in from the stairs and go directly for bacon.
“I think, I need to talk to the girls first, especially Emma. I just… you were what I always thought that I-” Her words trailed off. She had to let go and if she could still have some form of friendship with Dean, then wanted that. But she knew it would take time. She had so much resentment and anger inside of her still, only now she was beginning to see that most of it was at herself… she had made the decision long ago to hold onto him, even though she had always known he was meant for another, somewhere out there and it turned out to be Castiel Novak.
“Omega Novak will do no such thing. She is his daughter as well and deserves to be in her life.” Charlie countered only for Bela’s hazel eyes to gleam with challenge.
Sam nodded his understanding, and studied his brother and his Omega. This hadn’t exactly been how he had hoped to meet his brother’s Omega. Dean had raved and gushed about Castiel while on their hunt after Mating Season. He had been excited about introducing Castiel to him, and to the clan and Elders. Then everything had gone horribly wrong. Sam’s heart ached for Dean. His brother looked so worried and confused as to how to help his mate.
All eight pack members quieted and most sat back down. Dean’s eyes roamed over them all: Cole, Michael, Anna, Hester, Ruby, Gordon, Andy and Jake. All good and strong members of the pack. Each played important roles in the community and helped to make their town strive. They had quickly taken a liking to Bela when Dean started officially courting her years ago, and they had all remained loyal to her. They always preferred to approach her with any problems or ideas for the pack instead of Dean directly. Dean had always known it was because he didn’t exactly get along with everyone despite his best effort, but some people weren’t reasonable and could be pushy. Dean didn’t care for that.
Castiel nodded his understanding. Adam was Lily’s sire, but he wasn’t here… Somehow Castiel still felt like his late husband made sure he and their daughter ended up here, with Dean. And Dean… Dean wanted to be her father, not only as her Alpha, to be involved in raising and nurturing her as his own Castiel was overjoyed that Dean reinforced his hopes. “I believe Lily has already claimed you as her father,” the Omega stated and Dean beamed, making the butterflies in Castiel’s stomach go wild.
He loved this man, wholly and fiercely. He couldn’t imagine his life without him, without his love. The bomb that was Dean Winchester was powerful and addicting. He was a large and dominant fixture in his life and that of anyone that loved him. Like a sun that beamed and you couldn’t help but need and seek out that warmed that came from just being in Dean’s orbit.
“I already texted Charlie to prepare the downstairs guest bedroom at the house. She’s excited to meet our new pack member. If it’s alright with you, I’ll assign her to Castiel,” Benny informed Dean, who nodded as he rubbed his eyes.
He turned on the lump of a mattress and felt something beneath the poor excuse of a pillow. Dean flipped over the pillow and found a book. He sat up and picked it up, and once he uncovered it, he realized he was looking at some sort of journal.
Castiel’s eyes widened ever so slightly in the darkness of the cab and a genuine, beautiful smile graced his face. “Yes of course.” He realized then that it was Dean’s scent that was keeping him calm. The pine and bergamot aroma was swirling in the cab, even muting most of Benny’s cedar and petrichor smell. The Omega knew it was because Dean had claimed him, his body and wolf was already familiarizing itself with his essence, keeping him content and safe because he knew the Alpha was near. Castiel smiled as he let himself look over Dean swiftly before he closed his eyes. He was sleepy.
Castiel looked up at him, and a flash of pain slid over his face before he smiled again. “Yes. Adam used to love calla lilies. So I thought I would name her Lily.”
Castiel watched as she glared at his brother, and a coldness that had always unnerved him about her seeped through. “He should be dead. The only reason he is breathing is so I can study him and make sure no one else will be affected.”
“Alpha Asmodeus, while I regrettably must decline my own meet, I do have proud houses that would love to host and perhaps meet possible mates. It would be a pleasure to have our packs unite as such.” Dean dreaded all the political lingo, but he would happily use it to avoid unwarranted wars being waged for the sake of wounded pride.
A son. Jo wanted to cry. Castiel Novak was everything she wasn’t. Male, exotic, young, and had given the Alpha she loved, the highest honor, giving him something she hadn’t been able to, a son. Society had always viewed male offsprings, no matter the sub genders, as the biggest honor in strengthening the family name and honor of lineage.
“So what now?” Bela asked as Sam still struggled to make full sentences, his mind too shocked that his brother was somehow gone.
“I think you’ll discover a very different view of subgenders in the Winchester Pack. You won’t be belittled because you are an Omega. We are not less than an Alpha or Beta. In fact, we have quite a few skills in our arsenal that Alphas could only ever dream of,” she finished with a wink. Castiel was utterly, yet pleasantly, surprised at this new piece of information. It was interesting and liberating.
Dean grinned and looked up at his brother over his laptop. “Yeah, I’m sure. It doesn’t exactly change much, since the pack believes I’m her father no matter what, so this will just legalize it.”
“No! Every fucking promise! Every single one you made has been broken! Always overturned by some excuse concerning your precious  patients who couldn’t give a flying fuck about you, while your family at home was there, waiting and hoping that mama would get his head out of his ass and come to a soccer game, or hell just be home once, just fucking once for a family dinner! Or I don't know, to play with your daughter who is confused and doesn’t understand why mama is always leaving or gone. No, I tried Cas, all of this has been said so many times and I can’t anymore, I… I just can’t… at least you were right about not mating. I never was what you really wanted-” Dean licked his lips in frustration as he tried to keep his emotions in check and keep his tears at bay.
Already, he could feel himself going cold, putting distance between himself and the angel in his arms. In an eerily tangible way, he saw himself standing at a crossroads. The road to the Rubicon to the right and a thousand miles of Nowhere to the left.
“I’m, ah, going to be convalescing for a little while. I’ll spare you the gory details, but I’m not exactly in top form,” Cas said, the memory casting a shadow over him. A quick, burdened smile darted across Sam’s lips, and he nodded.
Immediately regretting the suspicion, he nodded. He was. Dean walked up to the foot of the bed, resting his hand in Cas’. Meeting Castiel’s gaze with his, at once seductive and stoic, Dean moved to the open side of the bed remaining hand in hand. The two centered themselves on the mattress as Dean laid on his side, retaking Cas’ hand and coming to rest with his other hand over the angel’s shoulder. Sleep did not come quickly. Eventually, though, Dean was laying slack against the seraph’s side, one of his legs unconsciously venturing to rest over Cas’.
Smiling and laughing, Dean collected himself. Nothing too sexy was going to go down on a floor littered with glass shrapnel. “For now, a sheet’ll have to do.” Dean carefully let Cas out of his grasp, making certain the seraph could hold himself up out of the glass before he stepped away to an overturned cabinet lying face-up in the aftermath of Cas’ deliverance. He wrenched the stainless-steel door with some difficulty, finding clean linens inside.
Looking like he wanted to say something, Dean suddenly became keenly interested in the toes of his boots.
Nodding, Dean accepted the fact without question. There was an unmistakable tenderness to it when he spoke. “We gotta get this shit outta you. I’ll be
Pouring the shot for Cas, he handed it over with a subdued smile. Dean took a long swallow from the bottle himself as he pulled his desk chair over to the bedside. The bleeding from Cas’ foot was the worst by far. Dean capped the vodka and set himself up to begin work there.
He had no idea how long it took, but the storm’s onslaught eventually subsided. When he could finally spare some awareness, he found himself drained and adrift on the sea of an emotion so vast he knew there was no end to it. He was off the edge of the map he used to define himself. Like every explorer throughout history, he discovered the world doesn’t end where the maps say it does. That consolation, however, did nothing to take the edge off the ominous olde-tyme mapmaker’s warning:
“You don’t mind?” Cas asked, his tone regretful. He straightened up, looking Dean in the eye from what would have been much too close once upon a time.
“Yeah... not much I can do about that. Just lookin’ to steady up my hands, and I’m guessing you’re thirsty,” Dean replied. Cas’ smile and appreciative laughter told him he’d guessed right.
“I was a little too tall - could’ve used a few pounds. Tight pants, points hollerin’ out. He was a black-haired cutie with big blue eyes and points all his own, sitting way up high. Way up firm and high. Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy, out in the back seat of my 60’s Chevy, workin’ on mysteries without any clues. Workin’ on our night moves...”
Cas answered his fears with patient, hopeful affection. “No. I’d... rather not spoil anything for myself.”
The heart-wrenching pain wracking Castiel’s being in that moment was more than he could bear. Now that It had broken into him, discovered the hope he had never allowed himself to surrender, the worst tortures would begin. Castiel was determined he would face it in the manner and form of his choosing; as the human being who had been the lens through which he experienced humanity. He laughed bitterly as a smile formed on familiar lips. It was his one act of defiance, resisting the Emptiness in a form so diminutive, whatever pride it possessed would be offended. The insult would provoke greater torment, but, at the end of all things, there was nothing—not an angel or anything other—that he would rather be. If It would deceive his senses, construct and imprison him in a ruse that would force him to face—touch—Dean again, it was this body he would use for the purpose. No other. A body that could express—that could mourn and cry—that could breathe, speak, feel and smell... that could love in the most visceral ways Cas would ever know.
It’s been years since Dean last felt Cas’ mouth on his. But hell if it ain’t just like riding a bike. Cas opens up at once, sighing into Dean’s mouth. He lays one hand on the curve of Dean’s shoulder, and the scar may be long gone but Dean still shivers at the warmth of Cas’ palm. In return, Dean slides his hand up Cas’ neck into his hair, and the sound that Cas makes then has Dean reconsidering his previous statement. It ain't just like riding a bike. It's like doing two hundred on a Kawasaki.
, not that Cas is a messy kisser or that Dean is covered in blood or that Cas is a dude or that they’re still mad at each other or that the Apocalypse is friggin’ nigh.
Cas grabs him by the jacket and tosses him like a ragdoll, and his fists slam into Dean’s face like cinderblocks. Dean tastes metal.
“--Knowing you has changed me.” Cas almost laughs after that, a shallow, shuddering sound. That smile, that fucking smile, remains, and the sincerity of it pierces Dean, like a sword through a dragon.
Dean’s never going to see Cas again. But he’s never gonna forget him, either. And at least he’ll have this to remember.
Cas stares at him, looking like he’s about to say something that Dean won’t be able to handle hearing.
, or at least, the screwed up, freewheeling, hippie-ass, stupidly tragic version of Cas he meets in Zachariah’s messed up 2014. So maybe it’s Zachariah’s fault, technically. Dick.
Dean blinks hard, cold dread coiling in his stomach and crawling up his throat, wrapping around his tongue. “Why are you telling me this now,” he forces out.
Cas follows Dean’s line of sight to the offending object and says, “Oh.” He reaches down, pulls a bright pink bottle out of the bag and presents it to Dean. “It’s called Fun Wine.”
Standing a couple yards away, knee deep in the unmown grass off the side of the road, Cas holds his arms out in front of himself, twisting them from side to side and stretching his fingers, like he can’t believe he has a body again. Dean stands quietly, awkwardly, leaning back against the hood of his car with his arms braced behind him, definitely not trembling, not even a little bit. Cas is just-- there. Looking exactly the same as when he went. Trenchcoat and all. (Dean had packed a spare set of clothes in the backseat, just in case Cas showed up in his birthday suit. Honestly, he’s fucking relieved he won’t need them. He’s not sure he could handle that on top of everything else.) Cas drops his arms to his side and cranes his neck up at the sky, eyes closed. Dean watches him, heart racing like a rabbit’s.
“You know, why don’t, uh-- why don’t Sam and I take it over to him, and you can get back to your mission?” Dean suggests. He takes a step backwards. Cas takes a step forward. Dean lets an edge creep into his voice. ”Finding the other half of the demon tablet, that is… priority, isn’t it?”
Tearing the curtains into strips is almost too easy. He wishes they'd be tougher, that they'd resist his pull, that he'd have to strain and rip and curse. But they're soft as cheesecloth in his grip. There's no fight to them.
Cas goes on, his voice tender in a way Dean simply didn’t know was possible for him. “Because you cared, I cared. I cared about-- you.” He holds Dean’s gaze for just a second, before smiling at the floor. “I cared about Sam, I cared about Jack.” Cas’ breath seems to hitch in his throat. “I cared about the
“Yes!” Dean shouts, and smacks the dashboard. “Yes! It’s fucked up! Giving up like this, it’s not you, Cas!”
Dean thinks as Cas bites down on Dean’s lip, because Cas certainly wasn’t this-- wasn’t so-- well, it certainly wasn’t like
Dean clasps his hands together loosely. “Yeah, poke around, see if the God Squad can’t tell us how you got out.”
“Come here, dumbass,” Dean snorts, and reaches out and grabs Cas’ tie. “Can’t let you walk around like this in public.”
, Dean thinks, imagining himself with an eyepatch), and as they stumble out the back door, Dean laughs and laughs and laughs, because yeah, it’s fucking
Cas is already inside the car. Dean breathes out through his nose and shakes his head before clambering inside as well.
And then they both seem to come to their senses, jerking apart at the same moment. For a few seconds, they just sit on the ground, glaring at each other, chests heaving. The scents of ozone and blood, like bleach and rust respectively, fight to take up primary residence in Dean's nostrils. “Cas--” Dean starts, and Cas growls, “Shut up, Dean.”
But he’s wrong, because then Cas goes, “Because if I see what Heaven’s become, what I,” he trails off, glancing away again, “what I made of it...” Cas turns his gaze back to Dean. “I’m afraid I might kill
Dean thinks, shellshocked. The realization pounds in his skull, thumping against the back of his eyes, and he feels sick from it.
“When Jack was dying. I--” Cas’ voice breaks a little on the syllable, but he soldiers on “--I made a deal. To save him.” He gazes at Dean, eyes suddenly shining with wetness, and that, more than anything else, scares the shit out of Dean.
Cas is silent. Dean’s breath rattles out of his lungs. “Cas,” he says, for the hundredth, thousandth, millionth time, like a magic word, like a prayer.
“Cas, Cas,” Dean rasps. Through his one good eye, he sees Cas raise his arm, a glint of light traveling down the length of his blade as he hefts it high. “I know you’re in there. I know you can hear me.” Dean has to believe Cas is in there. Dean has to believe Cas can hear him. “Cas,” he pleads, “
Cas struggles out of the vest and Dean says, “That’s a little better. Alright.” Dean takes the vest from Cas' hands. “Yeah, there we go. Alright. And, uh, your buttons-- why don’t you unbutton it,” Dean instructs, gesturing at his collar.
Cas barrels on, staring Dean right in the eye, and Dean hates that he can't look away. “No, Dean, listen to me. Dean, you mean something to me that is--”
Cas gazes at him, undisguised gratitude practically shining through his pores, and Dean feels something thrashing around in his stomach, like a fish drowning on land.
Cas gazes at him, like he’s drinking Dean in. Dean hears a sudden sound behind him and whips around. An oily blackness is seeping through the wall, bubbling and coiling like it's ready to spring--
Dean works his jaw a little, unsettled and wary. “Well, he’s not that far. I’ve been meaning to… go check on him, bring him some supplies.” Dean reflexively tightens his grip on the rock. The lightness in his voice sounds fake even to him.
bang a few gongs before the lights go out?” Cas concludes, coming across more sardonic than anything.
“You know, ever since we met, ever since I pulled you out of Hell--” Cas pauses, and a tear drops down his face. Dean is struck with the thought that he can’t remember ever seeing Cas cry before. More than a decade, and he’s never seen Cas cry.
Dean nods, holding himself stiff, and stares down at the sticky bartop. “E.T. goes home.” He knows Cas probably won’t get the reference, and that’s why he says it. He can’t just
Cas breathes in and out once, and then abruptly leans forwards, across the table. “Dean,” he says, quietly urgent, flicking his eyes up to meet Dean’s. “Those bombers-- you don’t really think that I--”
"Cas, I--" The next few words stick in his throat, so he seals his mouth to Cas' and hopes it gets the message across.
with his lips and his tongue and his hands and his hips. "Cas," Dean whispers into the other's chest, shirt buttons digging into his chin.
Dean lets go of the sleeve in bewilderment, and then feels Cas’ hand drop immediately after. Dean’s eyes fly open.
Dean chews it over for a bit, before deciding to jump on in. “Don’t get me wrong, Cas, I, uh… I’m happy that the... stick is out of your ass, but… what’s going on--” he stutters for a second, but plows resolutely onwards “--what’s with the drugs, and the orgies, and the love guru crap?”
” Dean snaps, concern sublimating into anger. “Cas, you don’t have to die with the rest of them, with-- with him, the other me--”
But when Cas steps forward without a word, Dean immediately stumbles backwards, bluff called. Something’s gone very wrong here. “Just tell me how you got out of Purgatory,” Dean hears himself say, pleading.
He braces his hands on the table, glances up at where Cas’ nose is making a peak in the draping of the sheet. It looks so stupid. Absurd, like Cas is hiding under the covers, holding his breath. Dean wants to fucking scream from it.
Cas goes back to his own side of the car. “I’ll keep that in mind for next time,” he says seriously.
Dean looks up sharply, the rock already in his hands. He eyeballs Cas for a few seconds. “No, we will take it to
In small, secret moments over the years, Dean had thought about Cas being human. He had thought about human Cas wearing different clothes. He’d thought about human Cas breaking his arm. He’d thought about human Cas learning to wash his hair. He’d thought about human Cas figuring out which foods he had a taste for, and if Dean would know how to cook any of them. (If not, Dean thinks he could learn. He would learn, for Cas.) In especially small, especially secret moments, Dean had thought about human Cas kissing him.
“I know,” Cas says. His eyes are wide and his jaw is set. “I’ll need help. Adjusting to humanity again.” He levels Dean with a look then, and Dean gets it, suddenly, like a baseball bat to the back of the skull. “Will you help me this time?”
Dean grinds to a stop on the shoulder of the road, in a place where it’s flat and green and empty and open as far as the eye can see. The sun beats down overhead, and as Dean swings his legs out of the car he squints and brings up a hand to shield his eyes. He wanted to pick a day like this, though. Cas likes sunny days. Dean doesn’t want Cas to come back and immediately be faced with an abandoned cabin or a dingy basement. He wants Cas to come back and feel the sun on his skin, first thing.
Dean can admit that blasting Cas’ ass to Timbuktu was a bit of a dick move. He’s not one hundred percent certain how the banishing sigils actually work, but since the angels never do seem happy about it, Dean has to assume the process is fairly uncomfortable. So he can get why Cas would maybe come back pissed. He just hadn’t thought the motherfucker would get back so soon. Or
“We never should’ve left Sam and Jack.” Dean’s voice is low. “We should be there with them now.” Bang. “Everybody’s gonna die, Cas. Everybody.” He straightens, but can’t meet Cas’ gaze. “I can’t stop it,” Dean says, quietly, almost in awe of the realization. This is it. He can’t fix this one. It’s the end.
Dean finds himself trying to crawl into Cas' lap, but Cas just sort of sinks down backwards so that Dean ends up propped up diagonally over him. Which is fine. Cas' coat ripples beneath him like silty river water and he stares up at Dean with those pale blue eyes and when Dean presses a hand to Cas' waist the bulb of the lamp on the nightstand starts to buzz like a cicada.
Dean is so surprised he gasps, actually gasps into Cas’ mouth, and his grip tightens into an iron manacle around Cas’ wrist. He falters with his other arm for a moment, unsure of what to do with it, before deciding to sling it around Cas’ back and pull him flush against Dean’s chest. Cas still has Dean’s face cupped in his hands, and he’s kissing him like he doesn’t need to breathe-- which, wait, he doesn’t. Dean, however, does, so, with no small amount of effort, he separates their mouths and tucks his forehead into the dip between Cas’ shoulder and neck, just inhaling and exhaling slowly. His guts are flip-flopping, his heart is pounding, but Dean thinks, feverishly, that it’s gonna work out. Cas is back and whatever’s happening, whatever’s going on with the tablet and the gates and Naomi, whoever that is, they’ll figure it out. They’ll figure it out together. Because this-- this means-- this has to mean that Cas is sticking around.
. He holds tight to Cas' lapels, knuckles white, drinking Cas in and allowing himself to be drunk in turn. Cas sips tenderly at Dean’s mouth and Dean feels like maybe if Cas wanted to eat Dean alive, Dean would let him. Like if Dean was gonna kneel at any altar, it would be this one.
“I brought you back,” Dean blurts, still frozen in his position against the car. “I-- Jack told me how. Kind of. He’s basically the big cheese now. We-- we won. It’s-- a lot happened, and we’ll catch you up later, I swear, but we won, Cas.” Dean swallows. “So I brought you back,” he says again, somewhat lamely.
Dean jerks back. "Did you just shock me?" he asks incredulously, lifting a hand to his mouth. "With your
Cas’ mouth works like he wants to say something, but he doesn’t. Dean smiles hollowly at the ground. “All because I-- I couldn’t hurt Chuck.” He bites the name out violently.
Dean thinks this rejection might actually be fatal, so it’s great when Cas shakes his angel blade out of his sleeve. Thank God. Put Dean out of his misery. But then, Cas holds it out to Dean, hilt first.
As Dean crashes their mouths together, crowding Cas up against the passenger side door, Cas brings up one hand to clutch at Dean's shoulder, and Dean swears,
If what he's about to do doesn’t work, Cas is going to kill him, and so be it, because Dean doesn’t think he can live with having said this if it’s all for nothing.
“Dean,” Cas says, eyebrows slowly drawing together, “You didn’t need to. I did this to keep you safe, I-- I was at peace with my decision.”
Dean’s too busy getting slugged in the face to care about the weather, but he reels back, nose gushing blood, to notice that all of a sudden Cas’ gaze is drawn somewhere else-- the tablet, revealed, lying on the ground amidst chunks of the rougher stone shell.
They clamber inside together, Dean slinging his bag into the backseat, and Cas cradling his to his chest. “You got the graham crackers?” Dean asks, mentally running through the list.
with me-- for the first time since you’ve been back-- and this is yours.” Dean indicates the rock with a jerk of his chin.
Dean removes the hand in question from the hood of the car and wipes it self-consciously on his jeans. “I-- yeah. Blood. For the spell. It’s nothing.”
.” He holds the words carefully in his mouth as he says them, like he’s having a fucking revelation, like he’s got the answer to life the universe and everything. “It’s in just
They spend the rest of the drive in total silence. Eventually, the sun starts to peek over the trees, all rosy and soft like it doesn’t know that the Apocalypse already came and went and nobody’s happy to see the sunrise anymore.
Dean sees every single time it’s gone wrong. He sees every single time Cas has gone away. He sees a cloudless day at Stull Cemetery. He sees a rift on a grey mountain. He sees Cas’ back turned in the bunker. He sees a poisoned reservoir. He sees the Devil’s crypt. He sees the night sky above a lakeside cabin. He sees psych ward whites. He sees an armchair. He sees a dimly lit bar. He sees a cavalcade leaving Chitaqua. He sees a garish motel room in OKC. He sees a ring of fire. He sees the wrecked kitchen of a prophet. He sees all of these, and more. He sees Cas, distraught across the library table, prevented from saying the thing that Dean knows in his heart Cas is about to say now.
Cas rolls his eyes, like Dean is acting unreasonable here. “You said it yourself. I’m driving to my death. And, hey, call it selfish, call it sentimental-- I wanted one last goodbye kiss.” He pauses, tilting his head like the thought is a ball bearing rolling around inside his skull, and he's trying to coax it into the hundred-point divot. “How
Cas sighs, deep and exhausted, like he’s expelling every single breath he’s ever taken from his body. Then he kisses Dean.
Dean whistles as he comes around the side, and Cas turns around to face him. Dean raises his little plastic bag up, shaking it around, like,
Dean doesn’t like to think about the fifth time. He was a fucking idiot for believing it could ever end up any different. And Cas is a fucking asshole for-- all the rest.
Cas seems to understand that Dean’s not leaving without an admission, so he answers, “Long enough to destroy Metatron, I hope.” He levels his gaze at Dean, one eyebrow arched slightly, as if to say,
He sinks back down to meet Cas' mouth, and there he remains, for what could be three hours and what could be three seconds, and it's
Dean gives him a little salute, which Cas returns with two fingers, and then they’re off to complete their respective missions.
it, like an earthquake, like an avalanche, so forceful Dean almost thinks he can see the air wobble from the soundwaves-- but that may just be dizziness from Cas trying to make Dean's brain into a martini for James Bond.
This time, Cas obeys. He hits Dean again and again and again, and Dean’s head snaps back hard with every one. Over and over the blows rain down, battering Dean’s face until he feels the sickening crush of his cheekbone caving in, the snap of his nose breaking. And Cas keeps going. Dean can barely breathe, let alone speak. But he has to try.
“And she’s gonna kill you. And then she’s gonna kill me.” Dean spits that final word out; it leaves a sour taste in his mouth.
Cas looks up, but not at Dean, instead gazing at the space on the wall above the shitty motel TV like he’s cataloguing every single ding in the paint.
For a few moments Cas is stiff as a corpse and his lips are sealed shut and Dean is just about ready to go,
Dean, discomfited by the earnest worry in Cas’ face, has to look away briefly. “Cas, you just gave an entire army up for one guy.” Dean closes his eyes for just a moment to gather his strength, and looks back at Cas. “No. There’s no way that you blew those people away.”
The seventh time it happens, it’s-- it’s not anything. That’s just another favor. Helping a friend out. Because showing is always more effective than telling. That’s the mantra Dean repeats in his head while he’s driving away afterwards, white-knuckling the steering wheel.
human being… I will ever know.” And then, there it is, this, this wide, wet smile, unlike anything Dean has ever seen on Cas’ face before.
Dean closes his eyes briefly, heart hammering out of his goddamn chest like he’s sixteen goddamn years old, before looking Cas dead in the eye. His hand is still wrapped around Cas’ wrist. “Would you. Would you still want me? Because, Cas, you… you can have me.”
“Hey,” Dean murmurs against Cas’ lips. He pecks a quick second kiss to Cas’ mouth before drawing back and shifting into reverse. “If you wanted to sell me on the Dumb Wine, you could’ve just led with that.”
“Hey,” Cas says, so Dean stills and looks back at him. Cas puts one hand on Dean’s thigh, leans across the seats, and kisses him. Dean closes his eyes. It’s been years by now, and sparks may no longer literally fly, electricity may no longer literally crackle between them-- but it never, ever gets old. Dean is gonna be kissing Cas for the rest of his life, no two ways about it.
-- but Cas is too quick, practically teleporting right in front of him. Dean throws a punch on instinct, but Cas catches it in an iron grip. A sharp twist, and Dean’s wrist snaps, crackles, and pops, just like the cereal. He falls to his knees, overcome by a wave of bright-white pain and nausea. His hold loosens on the rock. Lightning flashes outside, scattering light around the crypt.
Then, without warning, Cas shrinks back, turning away from Dean and curling in on himself. His voice rips out from his chest, raw and horror-struck. The words don't make any sense. “What have you done to me-- Naomi--”
Finally, Cas looks over, and meets Dean’s gaze. Dean is tense, half expecting to see anger or fear, to get chewed out or punched. But Cas just looks… confused. He tilts his head to the side, and Dean thinks, with his chest so tight it hurts,
On a sunny day, Dean dumps a bloodstained jacket, a box of salt, a lighter, and a knife into the passenger seat of his car. He goes alone, and Sam doesn't question it.
“Dean,” Cas interrupts. “I got everything on the list.” And with that, he hefts the bag down into the footwell, between his knees.
Cas, with practiced nonchalance that he maybe should have practiced a little more, turns a page. “I’m fine.” A classic move, right out of the Dean Winchester playbook itself.
Maybe it’s because Dean is so worried about the guy lately. Dean doesn’t wanna be a dick to him, not when he’s just gotten back from friggin’ Purgatory, with missing memories to boot. Cas
else, Dean would have marched over there and snatched it out of their hands. The intel on monsters, fine, but there’s-- well, there’s
“Okay. Fantastic. So,” Dean says. Finally, he removes his other hand from the hood behind him. “Don’t freak out?”
“What, and I’m just the closest warm body around?” Dean snaps, freaked out and pissed off, but also weirdly stung.
Cas glowers at him. Then he raises two fingers to Dean's temple, and blackness floods across Dean's field of vision.
sort of direct response to the awkward, halting speech Dean just made. What Cas says is: “You’re hurt.”
Dean doesn’t count when it happens anymore. He’s got much more important things to think about nowadays, like running errands.
Dean is already in a bad mood, and he’s not feeling patient. “No, you’re not,” he hits back. “How long you got?”
, and because that’s all I know how to do.” The words rip out, unbidden, and when they’ve left, Dean almost doubles over with the sick feeling that comes of admitting a shameful truth, bracing his hands on the back of the chair to keep himself from curling up on the ground and dying there.
He leans in, closes his eyes, and presses their lips together carefully. He keeps it soft and gentle, and focuses on the dry warmth of Cas’ lips, the roughness of Cas' stubble, the unnatural intensity of Cas' body heat, the electric tingle where grace runs alongside blood beneath Cas' skin-- Dean tries to commit it all to memory, to score down deep troughs in his brain and fill them all to the brim with nothing but this moment.
This time, however, Cas made it pretty clear that he wouldn't be digging himself out: all part of his stupid, infuriating, beautiful, heartbreaking, selfless plan. He went willingly and intended to stay gone.
Dean curls his fingers around the edge of the sheet, flicks it back in one motion. He’s left Cas in his coat. Since, this time, Dean has a body to burn, he can’t imagine sending Cas off in anything else. Dean allows himself one last look at Cas’ face. He can’t handle it for more than a second.
For a moment Dean is fiercely reminded of a Cas from many years ago, who slanted his eyes at Dean outside a motel and said
Cas twists his head around, and Dean catches a glimpse of his face in the uneven light-- stricken and wild-eyed as he pants-- before Cas’ arm strikes out, backhanding Dean so hard he flies into the wall. Dean scrambles to his feet almost immediately, snatching the rock from where he dropped it--
“I can resupply the prophet, Dean,” Cas says. His tone is dispassionate yet deadly, leaving no room for argument. Dean is reminded, chillingly, of a Cas he met in a warehouse over the crumpled bodies of Claire and Amelia Novak, a Cas who said he served Heaven, not man, and certainly not Dean, a Cas who was resolute and inhuman and dangerous.
Cas doesn’t answer. Instead, he sinks to his knees, heavy and inexorable as a rockslide. Cas takes Dean’s face in both of his hands, swiping a thumb over Dean’s newly reconstructed cheekbone.
face, complete with half-assed shrug. “I think it had something to do with the other angels leaving, but uh… when they bailed, my mojo just kinda--” he makes a noise like
Cas, his face carved in profile, answers, “Yeah. I know.” He picks up the bottle that Dean slid his way earlier and drinks. Dean averts his eyes briefly when Cas’ lips touch the rim.
Dean scoffed, shaking his head. Dreaming about it was one thing; doing was a hurdle of another order of magnitude entirely. “Cas... I’m
Satisfied he knew enough to sprint for the finish line, Dean picked up his pace. He managed a hit to the money spots he’d mapped out every stroke, turning Cas into an alternately bucking, writhing, moaning, grasping mess, the drops of leakage on the flat of his stomach growing in number every few passes. Spasms of release began, and Dean slowed but kept his hand at work until what had to be the majority of the cum Cas had to give was on his stomach. He shifted back and leaned down, sealing his mouth over the string of skin in the upturned cleft of the head in an open kiss to the hypersensitive organ twitching against his lips. Dean ran his tongue up into the vee, twanging that guitar string with the tip of his tongue until a surprising, ecstatic cry escaped from Castiel’s lips. Right on its heels came, “Dean!” The angel’s grip on his leg tightened, fingertips pressing into the skin and muscle.
Letting his head softly rest on the pillow once Dean was out of sight, Castiel felt the tension he carried in his upper back, shoulder, and neck dissipate, though he still found himself shivering. His eyelids fell closed.
Smiling and letting his eyes fall closed, Castiel focused his attention on the rhythm of the heartbeat next to him, gladly abandoning himself to a place where the only thing that anchored him was the sound.
Dean half-smiled as he let out a chuckle and nodded. “Yeah.” The one he’d been holding had gone warm anyhow. He turned toward the galley, freezing in place when another chorus of metallic clatters sounded from the direction of the infirmary. Glaring back over his shoulder at his brother, Dean’s expression went cold, the muscle wrapped over his jaw visibly winding itself tight under the skin. Sam took a steadying breath as he slowly stood, wordlessly falling in behind Dean as he headed to the galley for the concealed weapons they kept there. Sam’s handgun was loaded with silver bullets, Dean’s with ammunition able to kill anything divine.
Castiel opened his many eyes, blinking, an unnerving feeling taking hold of his heart. Floating in the Empty void, it gnawed at him constantly. A torturous, painful itch—like maggots slowly eating away dead flesh—was one of the precious few things tethering him to awareness of his own existence. He felt it every time another minuscule piece of him was devoured. Maddening eons—a seeming eternity—would pass before the Emptiness’ multitude of mindlessly feeding mouths finally consumed a being of his magnitude. The terrified screams of the lost echoed in the blackness as the nothing consuming them drove each one insane in turn. Some more quickly than others.
glad you’re here.” Dean had spent the last few months with his toes peeking over the edge above six feet under. In the previous couple of weeks, he seemed to do little more with his time than peer over the edge. Clearing his throat and chasing the tears out of his eyes, Sam collected himself, managing a quick smile and steadily meeting Cas’ gaze. “Make yourself at home. This is
Tears began to make their winding way down his face. Whichever direction was down was in a constant state of flux. The angel held himself unmoving but quivering, afraid, still afloat in the void.
is in order. Lay back. Close your eyes. Don’t look.” Having been somewhat on his side, Castiel laid himself out on his back, flat and comfortable, never breaking his eyes away from Dean’s gaze. Though his expression was stone-still, the look in his eyes burned hot as the sun. A slight nod from Dean reminded him to close his eyes. A closed smile formed on Cas’ lips as he did, letting his head fall to the side, facing Dean.
Cas spares Dean a single glance before returning to the journal. “I’m fine,” he says again, and fuck if after so many years on the road Dean doesn’t know an off-ramp when he sees one. Dean keeps right on driving.
Cas is all lit up. He’s gripping the tablet in both hands, light radiating from it like a white-hot furnace, illuminating every crevice of the crypt, while a high-pitched ringing drives spikes into Dean’s skull. Cas’ eyes glow like twin stars, boring unrelentingly through Dean. The light builds and builds, until Dean has to shield his face for fear of going blind.
There’s another burst of pain, like Billie’s punching right through his ribs to clench his heart in her fist, and Dean gasps-- and then nothing. It’s gone. Dean straightens, turns around, and collapses back against the shelf, still panting.
Dean picks his head up, parts his lips. Gives in. “It’s from a movie,” he says quietly. “About an alien who crash-lands in California and makes friends with this dorky kid. And the alien learns about life on Earth. And he and the kid have this freaky special mind connection. And he can heal people. Sometimes he glows.”
“Well, hey, you still got us.” Dean knows he and Sam don’t really count for much right now, and certainly not compared to an army of angels. He still tries for a smile anyway, aiming for reassuring but ending up somewhere around hollow.
None of that happens, of course, because Cas is really dead. No deus ex machina is coming this time. God isn’t around anymore. Cas is dead, and his body is only getting off the table if Dean carries it.
mean the angel type of falling, here. But Dean knows he doesn’t. He means the more metaphorical type of falling. The human type of falling. This is too much for Dean. He snaps his jaw shut so fast his teeth clack.
Sam’s warning shout echoes through the bunker, and in an instant the two of them are on their feet ready to brawl. It ends up being Gadreel. Dean ends up trying to kill Gadreel. Cas ends up stopping Dean from killing Gadreel. And then Dean ends up dead. And then Dean ends up a demon. And so on, and so on. They never quite get the chance to pick up the conversation again. Ain’t that just the way.
Dean has to get out of here as soon as possible, hit something, slam something, before he fully freaks on Cas.
Cas is completely still and silent for the entire drive back to the bunker, and when they get through the doors, he's the first down the stairs, practically power-walking towards the library before Dean and Sam can start to tear into each other.
Dean gives Cas a once-over, considering him holistically. If Dean was a chick, would he go for Cas? “Um… Yeah. Good. Alright.”
Jack is hands-off now, of course. Says Cas made the choice to summon the Empty of his own free will and Jack can't mess with that.
Cas breaks into a little smile and slips the bottle back into the bag. Dean reaches for the gear stick.
As Sam spreads a map across the table, tracing black marker lines with a fingertip, Dean catches Cas staring at him, pale and-- Dean doesn’t know what the expression is on Cas’ face, he doesn’t want to think about what it is, so he just tries to subtly plead, using the corners of his mouth and the muscles between his eyebrows, for Cas to just forget it. Forget it ever happened. Don’t let Sam think something’s up. He can’t know about this (
Cas nods faintly. Dean’s breath shudders out of him. “I’m sorry,” he whispers to the floor. There’s an aching silence.
. This Cas should never have existed in the first place. Dean can barely stand to look at him, but he also can’t get him out of his head.
But then Dean hears Sam’s key rattling in the lock and in three seconds flat he’s leapt up and just about vaulted across the room to what he thinks is probably a respectable, heterosexual distance from the bed, Cas’ spit still drying on his lips.
“No,” Cas replies. “But I thought we could try something new together.” He tilts his head at Dean, managing to straddle the line between beseeching and challenging as only Cas can, with nothing but a subtle quirk of the eyebrow. God, this guy. God, Fun Wine.
This kiss is a hello. Hello, forever. Hello for the rest of our lives. Hello every morning and every night. Hello for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Hello always.
Dean slots the key into the ignition, feeling more than hearing his baby’s engine rumble to life. He’s got one hand on the steering wheel, ready to peel out, when he looks to his right and notices that Cas' tie is still askew.
the canon divergence line here is a little weird. sort of starts with “can’t say i can argue with that”-- however, some of the dialogue following is actually based upon an earlier draft of the end’s script. more on the info that i used as a frame to write this scene here:
He could feel Castiel’s laughter move his chest before he could hear it. Moving his palm to rest under the crux of Cas’ collarbones, Dean let himself breathe out in relief. “That’s my name,” Castiel growled, sarcastic affection evident in his tone, a groggy smile on his lips. Dean took in and let out a breath through a shaky smile.
“Yeah, there’s a fair share of that goin’ around. Still, you’re here. That’s what matters,” Sam said, tears coming to his eyes, resting his outstretched hand on top of the seraph’s shoulder as though he needed the contact to believe he was actually there.
Rigid but poseable, Dean let himself be moved, recognizing, in the moment the back of his head rested on Cas’ shoulder, that what he was feeling wasn’t revulsion. It was potent fear.
home now, Cas.” Looking back to the literature spread out on the table, Sam’s feet followed the lead, walking him back to his work.
Dean shook his head almost imperceptibly. “No.” Cas, having been the audience to more than the momentary indecision, knew what was coming next. He limped, turning his bad leg away Dean, putting an arm over his shoulder and around the back of his neck. A short hop with his good leg, and he was up in Dean’s arms, resting his forehead against the side of his neck. Taking his first steps carefully, Dean backed toward the infirmary door, glass chips under his bootheels snapping deeper and sharper under the weight of two men.
am its master now.” With shaking arms and allowing himself a few moments of relieved laughter, Castiel embraced the boy who became God. Contently resting his chin on his shoulder, smiling, he found in that moment the peace he’d been bidden to. “Hold tight to me,” Jack instructed. “The Emptiness agreed to release you from perdition, not facilitate it. Our escape will be... energetic.” Jack smiled, chuckling impishly as he and the angel in his arms disappeared into a fissure of light that existed for no more than the barest instant. A thunderous crack resonated throughout the Emptiness in its wake...
On... and on... and on it went. Moments passed like centuries. Time lost meaning and became one with the nothingness, leaving Castiel only thought and feeling with which to define himself in this empty place. When all else ceases to exist, one clings to pain as desperately as any other sensation—more so, even. As one of the most potent feelings, little else serves as such a firm anchor from which to perceive existence...
Keeping one shoulder to the near wall, Dean stepped out into the hall bringing his weapon up as Sam hugged the far wall. A thunderclap sounded from inside the infirmary that left the brothers disoriented and cringing, deafened. The lights in the hallway went out, slowly flickering back on as the emergency generator kicked in. Sam witnessed the instant the heavy metal door heaved outward, and it set his heart racing. The two were strung high and tight as they closed in. Sam stepped to the far side of the door with quick, practiced ease, resting one hand on the door’s handle. He looked to his brother and waited for his nod before wrenching the door open wide. Sam cleared the space he could see, signaling Dean forward.
Blood rushed to his ears and cheeks when he realized the shape of the sheet over Cas’ hip was changing. Returning his focus to his own hand, he was pretty sure of where the nerve he was tagging was. “Oh.” Dean was about to pull his hand away when Cas quickly reached out, resting his hand over Dean’s. Lightly at first, then completely when it became clear Dean no longer looked like he was itching to take flight. Cas curled his fingertips around to the underside of Dean’s hand. The two stayed that way until the bleeding eased enough to take pressure off the wound.
Unfolding the sheet to half-width, he looked up, the sight of Castiel standing naked as the day Jimmy was born sending a surprising pang straight through his heart. Heat permeated him, flushing his cheeks. Dean averted his eyes momentarily before getting a grip. Forcing himself to meet Cas’ gaze as he stepped closer, Dean handed him the bedsheet. A sensation arced between them when Cas’ hand touched his during the exchange, giving Dean a start that went straight to his belly, sending a flock of butterflies into flight.
A part of her had always known that one day, Dean would meet someone that did spin that fairy tale love story, and of course the bastard had even met his true mate of all things…
Adam was dead, there was no changing that. It just felt wrong, like Dean had been robbed of the idea that he had time
Dean slipped into the quiet house. The last two weeks had kept him incredibly busy. Lily’s birth had bought a bubbling happiness that spread throughout most of the pack. However, Dean had spent most of his time being briefed on all the rampant rumors. Somehow, despite everything Dean stood for, despite his long relationship with his (now ex) Bela, many believed that Lily was in fact his daughter. That Dean was in her sire. Rumors that Castiel was Dean's secret Omega for years under everyone's noses, the most popular rumor being that he had been obligated to bring Castiel into the fold only once he had pupped. Dean had tried to set the record straight. He had repeated and growled and barked, but in the end it was futile. No one wanted to hear the actual truth, people loved scandal and apparently this was one that they latched onto. Dean was always the topic of gossip, no matter what he did or didn't do.
Dean laid Castiel down carefully on the ‘bed’. He sat down next to his Omega, and watched over him. Cas had to wake up, he’d just found him. The Alpha caressed Castiel’s cheek gently, and his heart sped up as the Omega turned into it. “Cas…”
Rufus sighed as he sat down on the rolling metal stool and regarded the young man with a concerned frown. “I wish I could help you, son. When you washed up on the beach…” Rufus rubbed his right hand over his face and sighed. He looked into the confused wide sky blue eyes of the young man he had grown to care for as his own son. Jimmy had been unconscious and unresponsive. He had been covered in an array of angry wounds all over him in a way that Rufus, in all of his thirty five years as a medical professional, had never seen. Being the main doctor of the small seaside fishing town for most of those three decades, he had seen many fishing accidents, and some had been devastatingly deadly no matter his best efforts. However, this case with Jimmy...there was so much more to his story, and everything in the old weathered man knew it in his very bones. “Nothing else ever washes up that could help us help you figure out anything about your past. This amnesia of yours, well, maybe you are the one blocking the memories out. I don’t know, but if all it does is cause you these piercing migraines, it might be best if you focused on your life now and your future.”
“Why is that the only thing that fucking matters to you!?” Now it was Dean losing his temper. He was too fucking tired and the whole Head Omega business had always annoyed him. “You are my fiancee! You are my Head Omega! That's it! Nothing has to change!” he growled out.
“Of course.” She promptly turned on her low heels and started down a hallway, leaving the group to follow. Crowley and Pamela stayed in front of Dean while Benny covered him from the back. Although Naomi or anyone from the Styne Pack had not shown any kind of hostility, Dean was still a high-ranking Alpha in a stranger pack’s territory. One couldn’t be too careful.
“That Alpha Cecaelia’s name was Asa. He was a savage and respected Warrior among our clan. He was kind, giving, and helped anyone and everyone that needed it. He was my son,” Lorraine stated.
Since then, it had happened a few more times over the years whenever he would see pregnant women. Those feelings and that action filled him automatically. He was just more aware of it now. Yet now, with this latest confusing flashback,he didn’t know what to think.
Castiel looked back down at his ravenous little one and nuzzled her, her jasmine and pine scent making his heart swell. “How long was I out?”
“Dean, I didn’t know they would do this! I don’t condone this!” Bela said as she too hurried to dress, ignoring the others.
In his fury, he didn’t see the other small fleet of soldiers aiming two of the vast bolts at him until they hit him. Dean cried out as one went through his left wing, and as he turned, the second hit Michael. It was a direct hit, knocking his rider right off his back, and the man he had been bonded to was now an empty shell in seconds, falling lifeless. Dean’s mind was now painfully blank and empty of their bond. The sudden silence was deafening and he turned to face the soldiers. He saw that Sam was somehow still
“I, um. Well, this wasn’t how I was hoping to introduce you two, but Sam, this is Cas, my pretty mate. Cas, this is my little brother,” Dean introduced, as Castiel’s cheeks pinked.
“Look, it was a really messed up situation when we got there… It was the only way I could save him and the baby…”
“Yeah?” Dean arched a brow at her as he smiled. “And who is the lucky Alpha?” He was genuinely happy for her. She was a strong and capable Omega, and any Alpha good enough to get her attention was damn lucky, he knew that and would always cherish what they once had.
Dean felt completely numb at her words. He was powerless to do nothing but nod and agree with her because this was what it was, the deed was done. And despite this painful situation with the woman he had loved for the last five years, in the depth of his heart he felt no guilt for saving Castiel and the pup, he felt right with that decision and so did his wolf.
“Dean.” The Alpha turned his head ever so slightly towards Benny, not wanting to take his eyes off of the Styne pack members. Dean had never felt so enraged and revolted by others. He knew damn well there were plenty of packs around the world that were much worse than this. Hell, some were considered down right cults, instead of happy packs of decent communities of wolves that simply wanted safe and well-rounded lives, but this was wrong in every sense. They were fully prepared to murder a child—a pup that was still in its mama’s womb, still growing and developing—without an ounce of compassion.
Time slowed somehow as the screams from his fellow members and his brother sounded around him. The Werewolves’ snarls and growls mixed into the fray as the ground shook beneath him, and the grey sky drowned Castiel as the rain drops started to fall faster. He blinked rapidly with the need to keep his eyes open as the pain in his leg simmered down to a slight throbbing reminder as his stomach turned into knots and twisted. His hands ached, and his feet tingled as his body continued to tremble. Castiel closed his eyes as his head pounded in pain, and his jaw felt numb. A sliver of desperation filled him, and fear swirled about him as he felt lost, with no control over his limbs as he laid limp in his brother's arms.
The Alpha stood and stretched, the popping of his exhausted body screaming at him, needing to release his grumbling wolf, when Dean’s eyes landed on Castiel. The Omega was asleep in the lounging chair, his broken arm in a cast, laid at a weird angle against his swollen stomach. He looked much worse then Dean felt, and he couldn’t help but hope the Omega would feel welcome here. A big part of Dean was actually looking forward to having a tiny pup in the house, and his wolf stirred in excitement at being
Missouri stepped around him, holding up the body paint bowl and looking up at him questioningly. Traditions were always an odd assortment of practicality mixed with exaggerated grandeur, but Dean wasn’t one to complain, not when he was in a great mood. He nodded to her and she started to paint the Head Alpha pack markings across his bare chest, arms and face. Dean was bare-chested and barefoot. He closed his eyes as Missouri traced the symbols across his body, marking him as the pack leader, as the strongest warrior and protector of their realm. The pack thrived under Dean’s leadership, following ancient traditions and honoring the moon.
He wasn’t going to last, heat pulled in the pit of his stomach as his toes curled when Dean slid his index finger between their cocks, adding to the delirious intensity as his climax started to slowly unravel throughout his limbs.
The Omega’s eyes however quickly flicked over towards the man that walked in behind her. His soon to be ex-husband was dressed in dark jeans, a white shirt and a light grey plaid blazer with its sleeves rolled up. Dean was clean shaven and despite the dark circles under his eyes that matched Castiel’s own, he was handsome as ever.
Dean’s hand came up to caress Castiel’s thighs and hips. “I had to think of a creative way to still have our romantic getaway if the weather decided to ruin it.”
Castiel had woken up out of habit, and was surprised to hear the Alpha’s voice through the baby monitor. He found himself smiling at the thought that even though he and Lily hadn’t been able to spend any time with Dean in the last few days because of his duties to the pack, the idea that Dean went to see Lily every night because he wanted to—needed too—filled the Omega with a sense of belonging… It was a significant moment. The Alpha truly saw Lily as his, loved her fiercely, and his instincts as a father were genuine and effortless… Castiel found Dean so endearing and the Omega was feeling needy and bold…Perhaps it was his sleep-hazy mind or the fact that the Alpha was in fact shirtless, his broad powerful freckled tan skin was on display. Or maybe it was Dean’s dominant pine and bergamot scent, smelling of happy sleepy Alpha, that hit his sensitive nose as they stood a mere foot away from each other in the hallway. For whatever reason, Castiel would never regret his actions that followed.
The silence between them was deafening and the tension was wound so tight Dean felt like he could crumble from the pressure at any moment.
“He will Cas, but you have to make serious changes. You have to prove to the both of them that you do love them and that they are a priority.”
“Wha—” Dean wanted to argue and yet, he could indeed feel something… feel Castiel across their new bond. The male Omega was… content, and despite his present situation with Bela right in front of him, his wolf felt a wave of pride at having his Omega, Castiel, happy in this very moment. Dean swallowed the lump in his throat. He had no idea how to fix any of this.
Castiel couldn’t believe how beautiful the room was. He picked up a stuffed lion from the wicker rocker, held it against his chest and nuzzled it. It smelled like Dean and he smiled as he looked over the room. He felt ever so grateful to his Alpha for doing this. The crib was strong and sturdy, large enough to last for a few years. The bedding was plush and the soft colors that gave him a soothing feeling he couldn’t and wouldn’t ever want to be without. The blanket had safari animals on it, and he smiled as he spotted the little giraffes and elephants. Dean had spent countless days doing all of this, getting every detail perfect, down to the soft new rug and the wallpaper that made the room look warm and well-loved… Castiel turned to see Dean was smiling and watching him as he looked over the room. A part of Castiel hurt that Adam couldn’t be part of this, and yet he knew in his heart that his late husband would want him to be happy, to live in the now with their little one. Castiel couldn’t help but believe that Adam had a hand in making sure Castiel ended up here, in Ohio, in Germantown. Here with the brother he looked up to as a hero, who had stepped up in spite of everything to be Castiel’s Alpha, to protect and provide for them… Castiel caressed his stomach and yes, he was happy.
If Castiel had possessed a beating heart, it would have stopped the moment the boy spoke. “Peace, Castiel. Do not be afraid. I am
too damned long,” Dean managed to say between a laugh and a sniffle, his tone taking a decidedly stern turn. “Don’t do that to me again, ya hear?”
Keeping his fingertips pressed to and moving around Cas’ head, Dean rose, looking for a kiss, his lips bringing with them a salty, metallic but far from unpleasant taste. “Cas...” he said softly, sliding his forearm under the seraph’s neck. Cas’ eyes shot open at another spasm of pleasure, knowing intuitively Dean had lifted the restriction, watching as Dean kissed him. He wrapped the crook of his arm over Dean’s neck, his own open kisses lascivious replies in return. Dean slowed himself, pulling away, Cas’ lower lip coming with him for a split second. Smiling, his gaze met Cas’ for a few wordless moments, taking in the euphoric expression he wore.
An undefinable amount of time passed before Dean found his way back to his senses enough to take in the air required to form a whisper of a three-letter name in the space between kisses. “Cas.” The confusion in it was the only thing that slowed, then stopped Castiel. He realized Dean was shaking his head, not just shaking. “Can’t think,” was the next thing Dean said. The only thing he coherently knew was that his heart was jumping like it was being electrocuted and needed to slow down. Cas chuckled and smiled, resting his cheek against Dean’s, satisfied the depth of his affection was clear. The angel realized Dean had been in a state where he couldn’t form a coherent thought or emotion to protest, even if he wanted to.

Cas wove involuntarily as he tried to secure the bedsheet around his waist, letting out a pained hiss as his step strayed onto broken glass. Dean closed in instantly to hold him steady. Leaning heavily into him, Castiel gingerly lifted his foot off the floor, fumbling at holding the sheet in place when it wouldn’t stay put on its own. Dean closed his eyes and took in a deep breath. Opening them, he stared heavenward, uncertain, and at an agonizing loss.
when confronted with absolute darkness. As the edges of his consciousness began fraying, apparitions, more often frightening than friendly, would manifest themselves then flow away like shapes perceived in the clouds—mirages designed to kill the spirit of souls lost within the Emptiness with a thirst for those left behind.
“Relax, Dean. This place ‘goes bump in the night’ every now and then,” Sam replied patiently, looking up from what he was doing with a partial smile on. It lessened when he took in the sight of his brother’s face – eyes red and swollen. A pang in his heart wouldn’t let him send Dean back to sleep right then. “I could use a beer. You?”
Boots, socks, shirts... and jeans. Each, in turn, joined the bloody bedsheet on the floor by the door. Dean turned to face Castiel, unable to bring himself to look up at first.
A scoff layered on top of a laugh escaped Dean. He nodded, smiling, running the tip of his tongue across a canine tooth. “Yeah, I, uh...” Dean cleared his throat, shuffling his feet.

Jack’s laughter was unrestrained as he drew nearer to the beloved man he esteemed as a father, reaching out to put an arm around him. “I learned from the best.”

“Dean, Sam... everyone. They’re long dead... gone... in their hearts, they have, most likely, left me behind. Even if they are in Heaven, I can never go back...” Cas said languidly, remaining limp, his gaze vacant. All the while, his son collected him up into his arms, giving his head subtle, knowing shakes.
Time will take us all, and turn us into stone. It leaves us with regrets and picks apart the threads, hung over fragile bones.
Castiel smiled, chuckling, appreciative of how torqued tight the body in his hands was, though also aware that Dean wasn’t perfectly comfortable. “Relax, Dean.” Again, having heard the words, he just
The bedsheet hit the floor beside his feet, his palm braced against the edge of the door, keeping it closed. Each breath that ticked by, Dean became more and more keenly aware that there was someone with him now without whom every breath taken since the Empty snatched him away had been empty.
“Dean, I’m only going to say this once, ’cause I shouldn’t have to say it at all: you deserve to have something good happen for you. You’re my
Dean stretched an arm over Cas, pulling a pair of boxers out of the bedside table, using them to wipe his hands. He picked up as much semen from the angel’s still-heaving stomach as the fabric would catch, tossing it back onto the bedside table. Giving Cas one last kiss in passing, propping himself up on his elbow, Dean let his forehead hang to rest between Castiel’s shoulder and chest.
“I’ll leave most of the cuts undressed. Clean the blood up after it dries. They’re better off being open to the air to heal.”
Dean withdrew his hand, blinking and retaking the focus touching Cas had hijacked. “You’re not healing...” he observed as he helped Castiel maneuver himself into a position where he didn’t have to lie on his injured side.
-- he's had so much fun tonight-- it’s been years-- and then Dean just says, quiet, matter-of-fact, "Hey," and tugs on Cas’ tie and leans a little closer and kisses him.
“Cas,” he begs. “Cas.” He can’t say anything more than that single syllable. He can barely move his battered body. He’s too weak to push Cas away. So he grasps at Cas’ arm, clutches the fabric of his sleeve, and holds tight as the killing blow moves ever closer.
Dean drives for a long time, tapping his fingers on the steering wheel with equal parts anticipation and anxiousness. There’s a lot that can go wrong here. The spell could be a dud. Or someone else, like Lucifer or the Empty itself, could hitch a ride to Earth. Or-- and this option is the most terrifying to Dean-- Cas may not want to come back. Cas might hate Dean for doing this.
Dean’s pretty unimpressed with Heaven’s locksmiths, seeing as how he was able to jimmy the container of the all-important angel tablet open with a rusty knife. But whatever. Who’s he to complain about them making his job easier? Dean pops the lid open, while Cas scans the crypt warily, like he’s expecting demons to start pouring into the room at any second.
In one swift, smooth motion, Cas pulls Dean close and kisses him, firmly and reverently. Dean feels the wetness of Cas' tears against his cheeks, anointing him. He can't breathe. He's outside of his own body, paralyzed and glued to the spot. It can't be happening like this. It's not enough. He's not ready. It isn't
“You did a lot of damage up there, man,” Dean ventures. He knows he probably can't appeal to Cas’ sense of preservation--
Just as he’s tightening the first of the bonds around Cas’ ankles, he has to stop and squeeze his eyes shut, breathe through his nose. Cas is dead Cas is dead Cas is dead Cas is dead Cas is
Dean breaks the kiss and for an infinitely long moment he’s just hanging in the air, their mouths centimeters apart, and Dean has two choices now, he could pull back and let Cas go, or he could lean forward and press himself against Cas’ lips again and see if Cas opens up for him and damn the consequences, damn Heaven and all its assholes, damn the cupid, damn responsibility, damn every other time he tore himself away from Cas’ mouth, damn Dean (for the second time), and damn anyone watching him.
. If he phrased all those wants as orders, would Cas listen? Would Cas stay if Dean told him to? Would Cas be happy if Dean commanded it? What about if Dean just asked for it?
for somebody to see him before he jumped back into the water. He almost lost his mind; that was thousands of dollars lost.” Benny laughed and it was contagious. Jimmy could picture it, and it was hilarious--and the exact distraction he had needed.
“Don’t worry so much Castiel. Ignore Crowley and just focus on the pup. Dean will take care of everything, don’t you worry about anything.” Pamela reassured him as Crowley winked at him.
Benny hummed and smirked as he eyed him. Dean rolled his eyes; he knew Benny well enough to know that his burly friend had something he wasn’t saying. “Out with it Benny.”
Castiel loved tending to the eggs. They were beautiful, so many different colors and textures,and the blue Omega had loved cradling them and singing to them. Castiel had a beautiful melodic voice. Many Merfolk loved it as well, and would come near the creche to enjoy listening to  him sing to the little ones in their shells.
Dean smiled at him. The honor he felt in the conviction of his lover’s words pulsed in the waters around them. The Alpha brought his Omega’s face to his, and kissed him tenderly as he deepened the kiss possessively.
Castiel jolted, startled from his thoughts by Bella’s quiet, wistful voice. She smiled at him, although it was with a bit of sadness, and came to stand next to him. Her eyes stayed on Dean and Lily.
His younger brother frowned at him but knew better than to question him when Dean was obviously extremely upset. Bela slid down into the side chair, her light grey-blue eyes watched her lover with confusion, but she too knew better than to ruffle Dean when he was upset.
They stood in the hallway on the open ground floor and Castiel eyed the gorgeous, large kitchen in awe.
He had already failed his family with Lord Samuel’s rejection and Castiel mentally thanked Duke John Winchester’s decision to send him here. Castiel had yet to meet the elder brother and Lord. He hoped he wouldn’t reject him. Castiel would beg and plead, do anything not to return to his father’s home. He would prove himself to be the best Omega… he had to.
“Okay…” He knew Sam was family and that the large Alpha wouldn’t hurt him, but it didn’t stop him from grasping Charlie's hand all the same. He was scared and he hoped desperately that nothing was wrong with his little girl.
“Alpha Masters!” Ketch was suddenly there, and rushed towards them across the lawn. He looked outraged, growling as he came closer.
“She’s getting really big,” Pamela observed as she watched Castiel videotape the duo playing. Dean was massive compared to Lily, but he was so careful as the lil one attacked him, biting at his paws and ears and trying to climb all over him, while he simply rolled over for her. “He just makes you all warm and fuzzy inside, doesn’t he?” Pamela teased, and Castiel blushed at being caught watching the Alpha so intently.
“Yeah, I’m guessing the Styne Pack didn’t bother with those? Or maybe they called it something else. Hosting is when a pack invites families from neighboring packs in the hopes that they will meet, mate and marry, which unites the packs and ensures peace between them. Most of the time it's for protection, land or profit of some kind,” Dean explained. “So make sure you wear your collar and please don’t go anywhere without someone you trust. There will be Alphas, and we don’t know much about this small pack. I don’t want anything to go wrong.”
“I know… I’m sorry.” Dean had no idea what else to do. The words cut him to his core, and yet everything in him was screaming at him to get Castiel to safety and worry about his hurting heart later.
Dean pushed Castiel towards the building as Benny followed. They were greeted by Jody and Sam as they entered.
“What the fuck is that thing?!” Castiel and Michael spun around to find several of their MoL members holed up together by the side of the forest’s tree line. Many had injuries, and most of them were terrified. Castiel’s eyes widened as he realized these were mainly the researchers and medical staff, while the warriors and hunters were inside the bunker fighting.
Dean decided against responding to the comment. He was so tired, and tomorrow… tomorrow he would say goodbye to his little brother.
The Mermaid hesitated and looked over at Dean. The Cecaelia brought him flush against him and kissed him before releasing him, silently nudging him towards Rowena.
“Nice.” The burly man went about fixing up the Impala. Dean was too lost in his thoughts to pay attention to anything he was doing, and instead unlocked the car and sat in the driver’s seat, soaking in the familiar smell of leather and the perfect way the seat hugged him as he leaned back into it.
Castiel, among many, had never been told the names or any kind of details beyond the monster Cecaelia taking an unwilling Omega Mermaid away from her intended. Tears swam in the blue Merman’s eyes. So many had suffered because of Zachariah. It went back so far. It was a  war that had occurred over his bruised ego and the rejection of an intended mate that never felt the same; that had never wanted him, but had simply wanted to have a life with the Alpha she had loved, and an innocent Cecaelia Alpha whose mother, after all this time, still mourned him and hurt for him throughout her long life.
Dean clenched his jaw. He had no words, no way to even begin to explain that, hell he hadn’t even really noticed it until the night of the challenge. Castiel had just appeared at the front door, his round form glowing and those bright blue eyes filled with worried curiosity, and Dean and his wolf had all but melted… The Alpha swallowed and rubbed at his face. He didn’t know what to say…
He wasn’t sure how long he’d been standing there when he heard a door open. He turned to find Castiel, adorably sleepy as he smiled at Dean and leaned against the door frame. Dean smiled and glanced at Lily again before he started towards the door.
Dean gently pulled Castiel up into a kiss and he decided to grind down, gaining a groan from his lover. They started to move together, Castiel rolled his hips down, meeting Dean’s movements. Dean’s hands grasped and groped at his ass, making Castiel moan and whine.
Dean leaned against his hands on the counter. The Alpha sighed as he heard the rain turn into a downpour… His body felt heavy and fatigue was wearing him down. Every was flipped upside down and he hadn’t the faintest clue how to begin sorting it all out. He still couldn’t fully wrap his mind around the fact that Adam was gone… And somehow Dean had made a series of decisions that had him sitting here, on what was meant to be his first morning as a married man, with a heavy heart on the day of his baby brother’s funeral… It was a hell of a somber way to examine one’s life path.
They spent hours making love, alternating between slow and gentle and hard and fast. Both of them were exhausted, and Dean was thankful for the tray of water and snacks Charlie left outside the bedroom door.
It had been a week since Bela had moved out, and she’d found a nearby house to rent. Dean was still struggling to accept his own feelings. He wasn’t upset, and that’s what worried him. Here was this remarkable woman, this special Omega, and he’d fully believed in their love and relationship, had planned to marry her, the whole nine yards, and yet… she left the house, her belongings all gone, a spare space in the bedroom closet, and her scent dissipated… and he felt like he could finally breathe… He felt like a complete asshole for letting her go. Yet everything in him knew that if he had argued to make her stay, they both would have continued on in a pale imitation of what had once been a strong, loving and fun relationship. That relationship no longer existed.
Dean came to stand next to him and leaned on his hands against the counter, looking at the beautiful Omega. “What do you want for your birthday?”
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Sam sigh in exasperation. A pointless death indeed, but Dean had always been a fair man. As Michael launched at him, Dean shifted back into his human form, caught Michael mid-attack and broke his jaw with his right fist. The sickening ‘crack’ echoed across the courtyard and Michael fell backwards in the grass. Dean bared his teeth and snarled over him, his eyes glowing redder as he watched his opponent whine and cradled his face. But the bastard tentatively stood back up after several attempts.
“Poor Garth worked his ass off all night to make sure the second was ready,” Pamela added as Dean looked at the collars with wide eyes. Garth Fitzgerald IV was the town’s best seamstress and tailor. He was an odd yet incredibly kind Beta.
Castiel was knitting, and Dean couldn’t help but notice that he glowed, looking serene. His sandalwood and jasmine scent had  taken on a heavy dose of pine, the Winchester’s primary scent, and it made Dean’s wolf puff up with pride. This sweet and humble Omega was carrying a gift that Dean couldn’t wait to get to know, to nurture and love.
“I have no doubt he and I are the same, and yeah, he was definitely exiled, but we aren’t from the same clan. The memory loss is ...something that was done to him. It's not natural. Even the doctor agrees that  it’s  a unique form of amnesia. Plus, the scars.” Meg rubbed at her arm. Her own banishment hadn’t been without a physical scar, yet it was nothing compared to what Jimmy had clearly suffered.
