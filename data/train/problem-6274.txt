"Sure," Steve nodded a little too enthusiastically. Leaving the ball in Tony's court was the easy way out, and for once Steve was going to take it.
The fights is... Quick. Tony wasn't just posturing with his confidence, and to Thor's obvious surprise they manage to take Thanos down if not easily then efficiently. Maybe it's because his urgency is gone, or maybe it's because he isn't able to control the gems to gain the advantage, or maybe it's that all of them together, Avengers, Guardians and villains, is just too much for one entity to withstand for long. Or maybe, a small voice Steve's trying hard to ignore ever since this world's Tony mentioned Pepper's name, maybe it's because Tony and Steve together, fighting side by side will always win.
Steve shook his head. "No. Tony dates supermodels and actresses. He just likes to give people stuff."
The thought of Tony giving up is shockingly sharp, a clenching of Steve's heart that makes him realise that maybe Tony's right. Maybe he can feel that way. The man in front of him is nothing like the one Steve thought he knew. Not necessarily because it's a different world, but maybe because Steve hadn't known the other Tony at all.
Steve opted to be on their ship as they went to find Redskull, while Rocket, Thor and Natasha attempted to lure Loki out of hiding. He knows he couldn't have brought himself to leave Redskull to other people, but he sure wishes he could. "So, where to next?"
Steve focuses on breathing, on remembering where he should be, what he was doing the last he remembered. "How did I get here?"
"I have no idea. But I know it was him," Steve said, stroking a hand up the opposite arm. The shirt was damn soft.
"Went a little crazy until we realised it was actually improving my brain and not scrambling it. Then he ripped me several new ones and got JARVIS to agree to block my workshop access unless I was supervised for the next two weeks."
"We'll see," Peggy said calmly. No one stopped Peggy when she was set on something, a fact Steve should have learned by this point. For all that Steve was the trouble maker of the group, he suspected that his role would soon have been usurped had Peggy been caught in most of her misadventures.
Bucky pats him on the shoulder with a wry grin and heads for a bookshelf full of board games. "They took away Monopoly, too much fighting, but there's a couple of games left that aren't a total loss."
"Upset?" Steve resisted the urge to laugh at the absurdity. "Over something some nobody said to you? You hear worse every day from people who actually matter."
"Thanks." Steve self-consciously smoothed down the already smooth shirt and batted Bucky's hands away from his hair.
"Why not? It's not like I give their numbers to random strangers," Tony said. "They'd know I'd vouched for you."
"Yeah," Tony says. "Never go to bed angry thing. Either one of us could die at any given moment, so not a good idea to stay mad at each other for very long. Plus, being mad at you kinda sucks, and you being mad at me sucks even more."
He was wearing the skinny jeans and a Superman t-shirt at the next group session and had to grit his teeth when Tony whistled at him.
Or at least he thought he was. Two hours later as they watched the end credits to a film Steve couldn't even remember the name of, let alone the plot, he was about ready to snap. Tony had barely touched him from the moment they walked in the door. Just the occasional hand on his arm, a slight nudge with his shoulder when he thought something on screen was particularly funny.
Tony huffs a breath of frustration. "We're not entirely sure. We know Dr. Foster held the reality stone, Loki may well have held the mind stone without the scepter and even if he didn't, that close proximity for-"
That's the final straw, and Steve storms off to find something he can punch without leaving permanent damage. He'd almost forgotten for a while there that this Tony Stark is still Tony Stark. Sure, it's a version that has a vested interest in making Steve like and trust him, but at his core he is still the same man. A man Steve can barely tolerate on a good day. A man whose stubbornness and arrogance raise Steve's hackles like nothing else.
"At least one of you has the balls to actually share," Fury said. "Please, give us a rundown of how this happens."
So Steve does. Through SHIELD and Ultron, and The Winter Soldier, and HYDRA, Tony's mouth getting tenser and his eyes getting harder with each new detail. Steve skips the boring days, the months and months of attempted normality, the ins and outs of searching for Bucky, but he relays as much as he can remember about people and significant events. Every mission, every world event, the things he heard about the other Avengers and Tony.
"But there is a reason," Steve pushed on. "A stupid reason and one I should have figured out long before I did, but one I'm hoping you can understand."
Tony smiles and kisses her hair before getting out of bed. Getting the coffee is the least he can do.
Virginia sighed as if she was humouring a small child she didn't much like. "My cab driver kept calling me 'sweetheart'."
"How was your trip?" Steve asked, and pretended he couldn't see Bucky facepalming in his peripheral vision.
"Have you considered that that may not be your height that's causing that?" Tony interrupted. "Maybe it's your smug self-righteousness or your propensity for using violence instead of words to solve your problems."
When he appears on the threshold, letting light in from the hallway beyond, Tony wakes, squinting towards him silently until he finally crosses into the room and swings the door softly shut behind him. Tony says nothing as Steve buries himself under the covers, just lies back down and slings a warm arm over Steve's torso.
It still isn't easy to fall back to sleep, images of Redskull's face and Thanos's gauntlet and Bucky dying drifting across his mind no matter how hard he tries to dismiss them, but the presence of another human being beside him eases some of the terror the images bring with them and he does eventually slip into the black.
"Let's just get some rest, get you in to get your head examined, and I'll make some calls while you're in with the doctor, okay?" Tony cuts him off. "I know whatever this is has gotta be terrifying, but I'm not entirely convinced you're not having the super soldier equivalent to a night terror or something. Maybe it'll all be better in the morning."
Virginia made a noise like he'd confirmed her expectation. "And if he doesn't want anything to do with you?"
"Thank you," Steve says. He hesitates a moment before deciding that maybe this world's way of doing things isn't so bad, and maybe he should start using it himself. "I don't know if I'll ever be the man you married again, but I hope you know that things are different for me now. I care about you, even if it's not how you want me to."
"But why this? Why can't I wear something not gifted to me by a drunk asshole?" Steve plucked at the shirt in its position on his bed.
"You're you again, aren't you?" Tony asks after Steve has proven without a doubt just how much he wanted to be involved with a turned on Tony.
"I am. I'm very, very excited. Extremely excited," Tony argues. "And once I've had coffee I will prove just how excited I am."
Tony nodded. "Cool. Okay then. See you next week." He turned to walk backwards halfway to his car. "And remember to do your deep relaxation tonight."
"Hey, we can order more dessert. I'm pretty sure they'll even let us take it to go if we ask nicely," Tony suggests with a grin that makes Steve relax despite himself. "We can ditch the ties and eat it at home in front of the TV."
"That depends," Tony said. He looked Steve in the eye, "If we're going to do this I need to know that you actually want to, and that it's not just some weird poor self-esteem fuelled fantasy."
Tony didn't seem to be feeling any awkwardness, just delighting in Steve's. He sat calmly watching while Steve fumbled for a way to get from saying to doing, and displayed no inclination to help him out.
Tony blatantly checked Bucky out before turning back to Steve. "You wound me. And I thought we had such a bond." His eyes flicked to the bouncer. "Larry, it's cool. Let 'em in."
Tony nods and leans back. "What about stuff about your life. Is it just your relationship with me, or do you have different friends here? Did you have other stuff going on back home? A hobby or a volunteering gig, or maybe a girlfriend? Boyfriend?"
Tony nods like he's won the argument and moves to go back to the coding upgrades he's been making to the Iron Man suit.
At one point Steve was helping a little girl with her robot and Tony came to look, congratulating the girl on her design and taking it from Steve's hands and easily fitting a part that Steve had been struggling with before handing it back. Tony's hand grazed down Steve's back as he left and Steve shivered.
They chatted for a while, Tony flirting on and off and Steve trying to ignore the fact Tony wasn't anywhere close to rejecting him so far. It was easy and fun, and Steve was getting a little drunk by the time he realised a couple of hours had passed along with more than a few drinks.
"God, I wondered why this world's version of me would marry you," Steve replies with all the venom he can muster. "I thought 'maybe this version of Tony is better, maybe they work well together'. I guess it'll remain a mystery."
And Tony. When he'd first got here, Steve hadn't known how any version of him could marry Tony. Arrogant, vain, flashy Tony. But also, he's discovered, affectionate, dedicated, reasonable Tony, who hasn't pushed him once during this whole ordeal but who has shown him love and support despite his resistance. Tony who hasn't kissed his husband in months, but who hasn't complained or tried to rush anything, who's dated him from scratch as if it's a privilege to do the whole thing over again.
"Okay," Steve muttered, and psyched himself up. He moved in closer to Tony, leaning into his space at an angle that only made it feel more unnatural and forced. Then he decided to hell with it and flung his leg over Tony's, shifting into his lap. He took a moment to enjoy the slight look of surprise on Tony's face before kissing him.
"You look like you've just been scolded by the headteacher," Peggy said as Steve climbed into the car with her.
"Well, you see, my company works in green energy," Tony began. "Pretty important stuff, I'm sure you'll agree, but my shareholders, old gents that they are, have decided weapons is still the place to be and we should still be selling people stuff to blow shit up with rather than stuff to save the planet with. It's an uphill battle, but we all have our burdens to bear."
"Now that's we've all had a little catharsis, we can get back to our regular group," Fury said, gesturing them back to their seats.
After the success of their last outing, even if Steve had mislaid the girl's phone number, Bucky managed to talk Steve into another night out. This time he didn't even have to enlist Peggy and Angie to get Steve to dress up in the clothes Tony bought. He did, however, have issues getting Steve to do anything with his hair. Steve just wasn't one for the tousled look, he didn't think he could pull it off.
"Jessica. I broke some shit, including someone's arm," Jessica all but snapped, arms folded tight across her chest.
Neither Steve's own friends nor Virginia and the confusingly dressed server seemed inclined to give them a moment or offer any kind of assistance.
"I went to sleep last night in Wakanda and woke up here. I don't even know where here is," Steve starts. "I have no idea why we were in bed together, or why Bucky is in hospital, or why JARVIS is here calling me 'Captain Stark', but I do know this isn't where I'm supposed to be. It must be the reality stone, or magic or something."
Steve tried to ignore him, but sessions had a strict no phones rule and there was little else to give his attention to.
After their last session Tony had left the box of clothes lying on the floor when he left, and loathe to waste anything Steve had picked it up. It was stowed in his closet, untouched.
The auction went well. Steve bought a bunch of the kid's paintings and sculptures but he wasn't the only one. Tony bought a picture of a robot and a few people in the crowd bought random pieces. Steve himself had a collection of panel art posters up for auction and they all went. Steve tried to ignore the fact that they all went to Tony, who as far as Steve was aware didn't know they were his work. They raised a surplus by the end of the day, and not only would they be getting a careers and training center, but two new computers and a printer to boot. Tony even offered to install everything for free himself so they could use the money they would have spent on installation on buying printer ink and paper.
"She helped after Ultron," Steve explains. "I don't know exactly how that went down here, but she was a real asset in bringing him down."
Steve wakes up from a bad dream to find a cheery woman on the TV talking about a workout DVD, Tony curled into his right side, warm and heavy and a perfect counterpoint to the nightmare-memory of waking up in that not quite right hospital room all alone. Clint once asked him if he ever dreamt of the ice. He doesn't. He dreams of the train, the plane, Redskull, waking up all alone in a new century, the battle of New York on occasion. But not the ice. Not explicitly. He just wakes up feeling cold.
Steve cleared the haze of lust from his mind as much as he was able and thought back to Tony's question. "Not just a sex thing."
Tony shrugged with a grin. "I rock it. You look more like you got dressed out of a lost and found box."
"We do work well together, you ass," Tony grumbles but surprisingly doesn't rise to the bait. Instead he drains his coffee and gets back out of bed. "Clearly keeping you calm and rested is a no go. Do what you want, but I'm restricting you to the mansion until we get you checked out. I'll be in the workshop."
"It it Tony? Did you guys have a fight or somethin'?" Bucky asks. The way he says it, it doesn't sound like it'd be the first time.
"Yeah, sorry," Steve says, and starts up a conversation about a trashy show he watched that morning. It's nice, and relaxed. And it's more of Bucky than he's seen since the train.
Thor furrows his brow. "Thanos had no reason to keep him alive or to lie about it and it was he that felled Loki."
While waiting, he ran his eyes over the other attendees. A meek looking man in a sweater with curly dark hair and a pair of glasses perched on his soft features sat to the right of the sunglasses guy. To the left of sunglasses guy was a redheaded woman with a perfectly sculpted pontytail and a very expensive looking outfit. To her right sat another woman, this one brunette with a leather jacket and a posture that screamed 'look at me wrong and I'll cut you'. Standing by the coffee machine were a shorter guy with dirty blond hair and another redheaded woman. The two remaining men were to either side of Steve himself. On his left a tall man with an eyepatch and a glare that could kill. To his right a huge blond guy who looked far too cheerful to need any form of anger management, though he looked rather uncomfortable with the situation.
"Yeeello? What can I do for you today Captain?" Tony says as he answers. His voice holds neither the affection of the other world's Tony, nor the resentment of the Tony from Steve's world. It's... refreshing. A new start.
Steve watches as Tony, Rocket and Nebula all gather around to pry the stones loose as carefully as they can, arguing over the best way to go about it the whole while. Thor and Loki have crowded around Thanos with a respective frown and smile that somehow manage to convey the same sentiment. Steve isn't sure he wants to know what the two Asgardian royals plan to do to their enemy.
Tony's smirk turned into a glib grin. "Sweetheart, I don't just take responsibility for my own actions, I take responsibility for everyone else's too. While you're running around picking fights, I'm changing the world. Saving it, actually. What have you ever done that's worthwhile? Tell me, what exactly have you done that's so good that you got rewarded with that nice high horse you ride around on telling other people they're assholes?"
Steve shakes his head. He's sure there's something the sorcerer isn't telling him. "I guess I'll get going then."
Strange rolls his eyes. "Everyone knows when you started dating Tony. It was a top news story for months. Impressive when we'd only recently had an alien invasion."
"Okay, I'm thinking memory loss might be a more logical explanation," Tony says, then holds up a quelling hand when Steve opens his mouth to protest. "I'm not dismissing the idea, and we'll look into it. But we're also going to the doctors in the morning, or I guess later in the morning, to get you a proper CT scan and the opinion of a professional. But right now, JARVIS says you're healthy enough and no one is going to appreciate being woken up by our shit at this time of night yet again, so how about we get back in bed and try to get some more rest before then, okay? JARVIS will monitor you, make sure nothing goes any further south."
Thor beamed as Bruce gestured him into his turn. "A man at the coffee shop this morning insulted my dear Jane. Though, as always, she defended herself admirably I must confess to an almighty urge to punch him."
"Alright," Fury said, regaining the attention of the room. "You're going to say to your partner what you want to say to whoever pissed you off last. No holding back. Tell them exactly what you think. Verbal abuse only, please."
Once they've picked up Dr. Foster, they don't quite know what to do with themselves. They're still waiting for word from Thor, leaving them with no idea where they should go, and nothing to do until then. Steve doesn't quite expect the painful clench of his heart when Tony says he's going to go see Pepper and let her know he's alright, or how sick he feels when Tony makes a rude joke about catching up with his fiancee. He supposes he should have.
Steve wonders for a moment how it would have gone if Ultron had been good. He automatically pictures JARVIS but with Ultron's capabilities, and he can see why the idea appealed so much to Tony and Bruce.
"Fine, just... bear in mind I'm fine now, okay?" Tony says. He turns his own attention to the album and licks his lips. "So a few years ago Pepper got hit with this tech virus. Made her all glowy and hot, in ways even Pepper isn't usually glowy or hot. I found a cure and in the process, figured out how to manipulate it, make it safe. So I used it on myself so I could have the reactor removed."
"The word you're looking for is bisexual," Tony said. "Or, you know, if you want Pansexual probably applies. Hell, show me an alien and you can probably use Omnisexual like Doctor Who guy." He paused. "Also, just so you know, there are male supermodels. It's not a gendered term."
"Just remember," Strange calls out as he leaves. "Sometimes the 'why' is just as important as the 'how'."
The next time Steve saw Tony it wasn't at group. Bucky'd dragged him to some trendy club in yet another attempt at getting him laid, and the bouncer took one look at Steve before denying entry.
Tony winces and meets Steve's eye. He raises his chin and shifts his stance as if expecting a fight. "Redskull."
Ten minutes later Steve had been called a cur and a cad, which Steve had only ever seen written in the novels he had to read for high school English, and had told Thor he was a spoiled rich brat with no respect for anyone. They've pretty much run out of things to say. Thor genuinely didn't seem to be an angry guy and Steve couldn't bring himself to keep ranting at his friendly, open face.
She smiles at him, and he gets the unbearable impression that her face isn't quite used to smiles. "Sacrificing yourself is hard enough, but letting someone else decide what that sacrifice means? You must trust him a lot."
It took a brief moment of psyching himself up, not because he didn't want to but because it turned out once he actually knew he was attracted to him, Tony had the same effect on him as an attractive woman. Tony's face remained calm and observant as Steve took a breath and clenched and unclenched his hands. He didn't attempt to offer any reassurance or doubts, just stood there. Waiting.
Steve rolled his eyes. Sure, they were nice clothes but that was overdoing it more than a little. "Take a good look. They're going back in the box and back to Tony."
Steve freezes with his hand on the door. He really doesn't want to. But this time around he knows better than to keep secrets, knows better than to think Tony can't handle the truth or that they won't figure it out together. "Yeah, of course. After coffee."
Steve floundered. He had no idea what to say. In the end he blurted out, "I tried to join the military when I was twenty-one."
"Vision? My Vision had a thing with Maximoff?" Tony says, mock aghast, and Steve wonders if that was the nail in the coffin for his believability.
"That is a shame," Thor said with a sad frown. "You are both fine men, and would doubtless achieve much by each other's side."
Tony's hips jerk and he comes again, body trembling. Steve lets the mechanic's fingers go so he can grab hold at the damned white tee, watching as Tony (a grown ass man, mind you,) whimpers his way through an orgasm. Tony's still hard at the end of it, pressing his face to Steve's neck and cursing.
Steve leans down and places his tongue flat on the base of Tony's cock. Tony's hips try to jerk, desperate to roll as he reaches his release, but then Steve's tongue - his touch - is gone and Tony can't help but cry when he doesn't get an orgasm. His cock leaks cum, and Steve smirks up at Tony when the mechanic looks down, slurring together sounds to try and beg. Christ, nobody in the Stark family has
Steve thrusts his finger slowly, laying a strong hand on Tony’s stomach, holding him against the mattress. Tony’s shaking in anticipation, knowing Steve’s going to fuck him, and that thought is enough to get Tony to take a quick glance at the other man’s cock where it rests against his thigh. It feels like a fever dream, as
"Keep your hands up there." Steve growls, and his tone has Tony trembling again. The arousal flowing through the mechanic's blood won't let up, cock twitching and leaking by the time Steve pulls Tony's underwear and jeans down. "Shirt off," Steve kisses Tony's thigh, amused at the way Tony takes a second, obviously caught up in the feeling of it all. Tony can't think. Steve does it for him.
Tony’s mind goes blank. The need has gotten worse now, and there’s not enough touch, not enough contact. He
"Tony, are you okay?" Steve spins the stool Tony's sitting on to face him, and lays a gentle hand across his forehead. Tony almost starts panting. Yeah, something's not right. "You're burning up. I think we should call someone. I'll get Bruce. You stay here." Steve's hands leave Tony and the mechanic almost has a stroke, grabbing at the closest limb. It ends up being Steve's arm, and the Captain looks confused.
Steve seems to understand that touch helps because he wraps himself around the mechanic. Tony can't help but slip his hand up Steve's shirt, just trying for more skin, desperate for it. God, he feels like a horny teenager with a bad fever. Tony's hand flattens out on Steve's stomach and he groans, because
he's standing behind Tony again. Steve lays a hand on Tony's shoulder, at the base of his neck, and Tony is brought attention to how hard he is between his legs. It doesn't seem normal. He's very out of it.
Tony’s mind is still managing to provide thoughts, and Tony is shaking with arousal when Steve’s flat, warm, soft tongue rests at his hole. He really shouldn’t move, Tony knows he shouldn’t, he tries not to, but his hips jerk and it gives sweet friction to his sensitive cock head.
Tony raises his hand to Steve's mouth, challenging him, and Steve bites down gently on Tony's fingertips. Just because
"Tony, what happened? Did you–" Steve seems to catch on, eyes widening. Tony wants to die. "Holy shit. That's– Oh, my god." Tony groans again, humiliated. For Christ's sake, he's a middle aged genius and here he is, in the middle of his own lab, sitting in the arms of a super soldier that looks like he could be God if he really wanted to be. Not to mention that he's a needy, horny mess.
The blonde presses a kiss to Tony's lips, and it's soft but heated at the same time. It's their first. Tony's almost brought to orgasm by the way Steve's tongue slides across his teeth, disconnecting their lips and pressing a finger onto Tony's tongue. Tony doesn't hesitate to lap at it, eyes drooping and his body covered in sweat. The mechanic doesn't think much of Steve's now wet finger until it's pressing at his hole, and then his hips thrust against Steve's and he whines. Just a little more and then he'll cum again. Steve presses the finger inside. Tony's a man of his word.
"Not yet. I have other things to do. Not that your suit needs much, just need to run it over and make sure it's all smooth. I've got my hands full with Clint's arrows." Steve hums in response, and he's definitely closer than he was, standing a few inches behind Tony. He towers over the mechanic. Tony would hate to admit he's gotten off a few times thinking about someone of Steve's size covering him, surrounding him, holding him down and choking him with their thick–
his cock looks fucking huge, much bigger than Tony’s. It’s wider too, and Tony can’t do anything but groan when he realizes that it’s going to be
"Not going to lie, Stark," Tony might have ascended for a minute at the stern use of his last name, and how has he never noticed how hot that is? "I'd love to see it happen again. Just so I can watch it this time." Tony
"I need to get undressed, angel." Tony's mind takes a bit to catch up, overloaded by the drug, immediately burning up when Steve's hands leave him. Tony squirms, breaths coming heavy, and
he's so close and there's no strain on Steve's end– Tony grabs onto Steve's shirt, burying his face into the soldier's neck as he trembles through an orgasm, groaning into the skin of Steve's throat. Steve stops, concerned.
The soldier lays his hands on Tony's hips, ignoring the unconscious thrust for friction, and leans down to drag his tongue
Steve's shoving him down into the mattress and fucking him harder, grunting and groaning as he plunges deeper into Tony's overheating body.
Tony can't stop the moan from slipping out of him when Steve starts a brutal pace, dragging Tony by the thighs with every upward thrust. Steve puts one of his hands on Tony's stomach, pressing him back to the blonde's chest, sweaty and so fucking
Two weeks later when he wakes up in Tony's bed after their usual nightmare support system, Steve stares at Tony without waking him. It's peaceful and comforting. None of the anger or fear or grief is there anymore. Whatever happened back- No. Whatever Steve remembers happening, this Tony didn't have anything to do with it, and even if he was looking at a Tony who did... Well, this world's Bucky just goes to prove that maybe it's more about what Steve did. It's hard to be angry when evidence of Tony being right surrounds him.
The fact that Tony himself raises the idea is confusing to say the least. Why on earth would he suggest that? Maybe it wasn't real and this was Steve's mind trying to tell him that through Tony's image. But that didn't seem quite right.
Tony winces. "I already called Helen Cho while I was getting coffee. She's on her way, but she won't be in the city for another couple of hours, and she's the only SHIELD goon I trust, doctor or no. She told me to get you to calm down and rest until she gets here."
"This what it's all about to you, isn't it? The anger issues and outbursts, the holier-than-thou attitude, the overcompensating with the military applications and the volunteering, and now this," Tony said. "It's all about you thinking the world sees you as this worthless little guy and you trying to prove them wrong. You don't get into fights because you're angry at people being assholes, you get into fights because you think it proves something. Why use your words when you can try to prove you're not a weakling by using your fists instead, am I right?"
Steve considered his options. "When you said we'd see how it went with the whole 'level of acceptable groping' thing, I thought that'd mean there was, you know, groping."
The food had arrived promptly and they'd demolished it before they were two thirds of the way through the movie, and so now there was nothing to distract Steve from how far apart they were on the couch. It wasn't a gaping chasm, no dramatic amount of space, but it was at the level Steve might expect from a friend, not a date. As nervous as he'd been when they first sat down, by now he was just frustrated. He may not have experience with guys, or much experience at all, and he may have only admitted to liking Tony or any man very recently, but he wasn't one to shy away from what he wanted. And what he wanted was Tony.
"Thanks," Steve says. He glances around at the billboards and lights and signs, his eye catching on an advertisement for the new solar powered Stark Phone charging port. "Do you have a direct number for Tony Stark?"
"Yeah, you know. Geeky t-shirt, skinny jeans, wiry twink thing. All you need is some thick rimmed glasses and a sculpted beard and you'd be the poster boy for the hipster trend," Tony elaborated.
Tony froze. "Okay, there are two things we need to address here, because holy shit. Firstly that you have self-image issues like woah. You should really see someone about that, 'cause you're kinda acting like a crazy person. Which brings me to the other thing, which is that I'm beginning to think you only asked me out as some weird test of my sincerity and that you never actually wanted to go out with me."
Somehow whatever nervousness Steve had surrounding the situation or his inexperience with men got shoved to the back of his mind at the taste of Tony's mouth, still sweet from the cola they'd had with dinner. The feeling of Tony's arms wrapping strong around him didn't make him feel small or overpowered, but wanted, like Tony wanted him so much he needed to press them together tight enough that nothing could take Steve away.
The thought of dancing out there where everyone could see was bad enough, the thought of doing it while with an actual celebrity whose presence would attract the attention of half the room to Steve's awkward flailing was unthinkable. "I prefer to avoid public humiliation where possible," he said with a wince.
Tony put the box on the floor and turned back to where he was talking about something that sounded far too complicated to be coming out of Tony's immaculately groomed face with Bruce.
as before, moaning in overstimulation. His head falls back onto Steve's shoulder with a groan, cock aching without any touch. Steve growls, low and dangerous, and then plants his hands back on Tony's hips before he lifts up off the bed and switches their position without a second thought. Tony moans as he's placed face down ass up with Steve fucking
They track down Redskull easily, and disturbingly, he's only too happy to go with them. Steve's guess is that genocide only appeals to Redskull when he gets to choose who dies.  He's still going to keep more than one eye on the villain though.
Steve can't. Unlikely? Yes. Surprising? Definitely. But it does all make a kind of sense. Here, instead of fighting and keeping secrets, Tony and his Steve are partners. He has his doubts over what they've achieved, but who knows? Maybe without the secrets and the division things could have been this way. "How did we fall in love?" He asks. Not because it's impossible or doesn't make sense. As odd as it still seems to Steve, he's already seen how good they can be together here in this world.
Tony doesn't look away from the scan. "I told you I would. I also told you he'd want to see the scans."
"What am I going to do? Try to stop you?" Tony scoffs. "It'd be pointless even trying, but I wouldn't anyway. The guy's been through a lot."
"Maybe that wasn't the start of it, maybe it's just one of the symptoms. I don't know much of what happened in this timeline, for all I know it could have been something that happened while I was travelling, or even when I was still in the ice." Steve shrugs helplessly. "It could take forever to work out what the first difference really was."
"Just... Take them back." Steve had no idea what Tony was talking about, but the gist of it being that Tony didn't know his personal details was a little reassuring.
"I don't know what you thought you were doing, or how the hell you got my measurements and address, but it's creepy as hell and you can have these back," Steve told him.
Bucky made an apologetic face. "Sorry, but you know I've got a point. You should dress nicer, you look good like this. Really good."
"I don't understand why you're not doing something," Steve pushes. "If your Steve is really out there somewhere then don't you want to get him back as quickly as possible?"
"Why would it be just a sex thing?" Steve asked, put on alert by Tony's overly convincing casualness. "I did a whole airport movie moment thing. I know guys like me have to put in a little extra work, but don't you think that'd be taking it a little far for just a sex thing?"
The power is tangible as it seeps into Steve's pores and links him to Tony where their hands meet. As it washes over him he deliberately resists any thoughts that could be interpreted as instructions beyond keeping Tony safe, and as he does so, he sees Tony relax. The tingling pressure builds to the point of pain and then keeps going. There's no sign of discomfort on Tony's face though, and that's what's important here. Steve knew the risks when he put his hand over Tony's. If he's truly honest with himself, Steve isn't entirely sure about letting Tony do this, letting him be in control and leaving him to deal with the aftermath, beyond trust in Tony's good intentions Steve is well aware of the difference between intention and reality. But he's fought Tony before, demanded he cede control, tried to take it from him, and it ended with half the universe dead. And if it all goes wrong, well, at least Steve will find comfort in the knowledge that he and Tony both did their best.
Tony doesn't flinch, either taking the question for what it is or ignoring the sting of what was accidentally implied. "Same way anybody does. We spent time together, got to know each other. I gave you a proper introduction to the twenty-first century and thoroughly abused the process. We figured out we were attracted to each other, talked about it, got around to the romantic stuff and the physical stuff. It's not some mystical process."
It wasn't the answer Steve was looking for. He was looking for the reason why this Steve and this Tony gave each other that chance. "But you still fought on the helicarrier?"
"He didn't survive," Steve protests. He can't wrap his head around the idea that Redskull is alive. He doesn't want to. "He touched it and he disappeared. It... vaporised him or something."
"Rhodes said you have security on the suits so people can't steal them," Steve says. "So only preauthorised people can pilot them."
"I'm... totally gonna... tell Thor... how mean you are... and he'll... give you that... disappointed face... you know... the one," Tony got out around kisses.
"Anyway," Steve said, trying to get back on track. "My size and my health have always been this... thing. This obstacle. No one takes me seriously-"
"It's not that I don't believe you. I really do think you've got this whole other version of events in your head, that you honestly don't think this is where you belong. And who knows? Maybe you're right. But from what I've heard so far, the stuff you remember differently is all worst case scenario. All the things you were afraid could've happened, all the nightmares you wake up sweaty and shivering from," Tony says. "We're not together, Zemo won, Ross is still on the Accords. And I'm betting if I ask you what happened to Bucky in your world it isn't going to be a happy story."
"The Tony I know would be spouting theories on alternate universes by now," Steve says and realises it's true. The Tony from back home probably wouldn't have even thought of calling the doctor first.
"But I'm fine! No ill effects!" Tony says cheerily, arms splayed wide. "I might actually make it into my low hundreds now, when before... well, let's just say I wasn't about to break any longevity records."
"What does that even have to do with anything?" Steve was close to pulling his hair out. Or actually hitting Tony. It could go either way.
"I moved away," Steve said. "It was instinct! I tried to move back in but he'd caught on that something was off."
Steve meant to answer promptly but got distracted by just how hot it was that Tony couldn't even shut up when they were making out, something Steve never anticipated finding attractive. Was it weird to find that attractive? He didn't really care.
Steve can't imagine a reason why he wouldn't want to be involved with that and expresses this sentiment with his hands.
Steve doesn't know what to do with that, like a lot of the stuff he learns about this world and this world's Steve and Tony. It's too perfect, too flawless. Sure, Tony still built Ultron, but he did it with Steve's knowledge, and he did it with safeguards in place, and they won and JARVIS didn't get destroyed but Vision still got created, and Wanda and presumably Pietro got locked up but neither of them died and they're safe. It's all neat and tied up and nothing like the messy reality he knows.
"Aww, c'mon. Seriously? How did I not know about this before?" Steve complained. "You're usurping my coming out."
Bucky takes one look at his face and pulls him in for a gruff hug, hand patting solidly at Steve's back.
Tony leans back a little to look at his face. "Or whatever. Doesn't have to be one of those two options. We could play a video game, or go spar in the gym for a while, or, I dunno. We could go clubbing I guess, but that's more of a me coping strategy than a you coping strategy. Or maybe... Okay, I'm tired and believe me when I use that as my excuse, but I'm out of ideas."
The only full length mirror in their apartment was in the bathroom and it was all fogged up after Steve's shower. A traitorous part of him wanted to go look, see if Bucky really wasn't exaggerating. He'd never really been bothered about his looks, but it'd be a lie to deny he'd like to look more attractive. With a best friend like Bucky he was never going to get much attention, but it'd be nice to feel like he was worth a second glance.
Steve doesn't even try to argue, either about it not being him that did it the first time or about not wanting to do it. He gets the impression Tony might forget about it if he lets it slide. "Was it our first date?"
"I don't mean to be harsh," Virginia continued after another moment of examining Steve. "While I don't condone your actions and I am deeply angry with you for hurting him, I understand that these things are not always intentionally hurtful. However, Tony has more on his plate than any one man should have to deal with, and I will not let you add to the pile. He's a good man, he doesn't deserve the fallout of whatever it is you're going through right now."
Steve's way to deal with his problems was usually to draw or to go punch things at the one gym in town where he didn't get stares when his enthusiastic attacks on the punch bags resulted in asthma attacks. Bucky refused to have a punch bag in to apartment in case Steve killed himself with it.
"I can see more clearly here. Fewer distractions. Not to mention if there had been anything more I could do for you, the majority of it would have been done here," Strange says. "That and you were the only Avenger who hadn't paid me a visit here yet." He grins. "I do like to finish collections."
"Tony, come on," Steve said. "I may be capable of getting a date myself, but I'm not exactly supermodel level. None of them would be interested."
"So you have a waist after all, I was beginning to wonder," Tony said, dropping into the seat by Steve's side that Thor usually occupied.
"I'm sure that's true, but that doesn't make everyone attracted to all bodies," Steve argued. "Especially not supermodels."
"Hell yes, and I made sure the whole board knew about her history with the male anatomy. They're terrified of her, it's great," Tony said, standing to go deal with whatever it was Virginia had asked.
Clint shrugged. "I dunno, I was pretty pissed off when my alarm went off to remind me to come here. Does that count?"
Tony flails for words for a second. "Was that before or after she messed with my brain to get me to create him, then worked for him to try to destroy us all?"
Tony pulled a bag of trail mix seemingly out of thin air and popped a small handful into his mouth, chewing in mock deliberation before answering. "Does existential anger at the shortsightedness of the human race count?" He grinned, still chewing.
Is it a punishment? Showing him a life he can never have, where the people he cares about are safe and happy? Is it a distraction? To keep him off the playing field where he can't help his friends and his world? Or maybe it's about the other Steve, maybe he's the one being punished by being sent to the world Steve came from and they just traded places. It would make an effective punishment going by his conversation with this world's Tony.
Steve thought about it. The Bucky voice piped up again. "Fine. Here goes." He took a breath and ordered his speech in his head. "I came to apologise for what I did. I hurt you, and there's no excuse for my behaviour. I would like to make it up to you and offer an explanation if you're willing?"
"You gonna help me out here? It's kinda difficult to have a conversation, just me asking questions and you giving short answers," Bucky says on a sigh. "You don't have to talk about what's bugging you if you don't want to, but you do have to talk about somethin'."
Tony pulled a face. "Don't you think that'd be a little bit over the top? Why the hell would I take it this far to humour you?"
A flicker of hope passes through Thor's expression before vanishing. "I do not know if such a deception would be possible. If it were, then my brother would certainly employ it, but even if he lives, I know not where he would go if not to find me."
Steve pulls him into a hug as soon as he's within arm's reach, and Bucky responds in kind with a chuckle. "Miss me already big guy?"
Steve ground his teeth. "Saving the world, huh? Is that before or after you sold weapons to mass murderers?"
The next group session Fury had them ranting at each other again. This time, in a strange reversal, Steve found himself partnered with Tony without having anything Tony related to rant about.
"No," Tony interrupts with enough unleashed fury to shut Steve up. "This isn't about me giving a shit about you killing yourself. This is about the fact that whoever is in the middle of this circle gets to control the fate of the known Universe. I don't even really trust myself to do this, but for some reason these other people do."
"Because no matter what problems we have, you and I together, we're pretty good at solutions," Steve says confidently. Then softly, "I need you. The whole universe does."
Steve walked out of his first therapy session feeling even worse about having to attend than before. Most of the others were okay, but Fury was a little standoffish for an anger management therapist, and Tony's attitude had the exact opposite effect as the one the sessions were supposed to have.
Tony's expression grew even more baffled. "Which of the numerous times I've hit on you or called you hot or pretty didn't clue you in?"
Steve shakes his head. "There's no reason to think that'll happen. And if it does, then we'll deal with it. But I can't sit around not living my life because of 'what ifs'."
his skin prickling. He was fine a few minutes ago. What's happening? Steve does Tony's body a once-over, and his eyes stop on the obscene tent in the genius' jeans.
Tony’s salivating, body trembling as Steve lowers him, splitting him open. It’s so good, Steve’s so long, and Tony can barely track how he’s feeling or his own movements, craving
"Tony, we should move somewhere comfortable. I can't stand here all day." Tony slides his hand from Steve's stomach to his hip, still touching the Captain's bare skin. "Alright," Steve sighs, hands leaving Tony's sides for a short moment so he can place them on Tony's thighs. Tony gasps, immediately trembling. Tony's embarrassed to admit he whimpers, a soft 'oh, god' reaching Steve's ears.
"FRIDAY, call Doctor Banner." Tony couldn't care less about how desperate he seems, because Steve lays his hands on Tony's burning arms and the mechanic shudders. His body feels like it's going to implode, rock hard in his pants and
that feels, Steve’s hard cock sliding through his legs, smooth and Tony can feel the way it twitches every time Steve thrusts forward. Steve can tell he likes it, a shit-eating grin tugging at his lips.
Touch-ups to Steve's suit and Clint's arrows need to be worked on, and Tony had yet to do the monthly check-up of Bucky's arm to make sure everything was working smoothly. It was sometime mid-day when Steve came down to check in on Tony. He looked well-rested and clean (yay for Tony, who has to deal with Steve's presence when he'd rather be alone).
"I'm sorry, I just– you–" Tony can't get it out, praying that Steve sets him down soon because holy fuck Tony's rock hard again and whatever happened to a refractory period? "That was– that was
Steve presses in a third finger. It’s dry, but Tony doesn’t mind. The stretch has Tony trembling, body tense. He aches, cock still rock hard even after so many orgasms, his fingers tense where they’re latched into the fabric below him. It’s soft. Of course it is. Tony’s so much more aware of it now, so much more aware of everything. Steve pulls his fingers out, and Tony whines at the loss. He’s left empty, aching even more now, a startled gasp slipping off his tongue when Steve pushes Tony’s legs up and pins them against his chest. That shouldn’t be hot, but it is, the mechanic now on full display for the blonde.
Tony moans, grabbing at the sheets, his cock shooting come again. Steve chuckles lowly, slowing down to grind against Tony's ass, balls deep.
“I don’t know, I kind of like this.” Steve uses a hand to tap at Tony’s thigh, causing goosebumps to break out, and Tony’s jerking into the touch as if he’s dehydrated and it’s a cold glass of water. Steve thrusts back into Tony’s thighs, and sets a pace, hips meeting the backs of the mechanic’s thighs. Tony’s glad he shaved, he always shaves before missions. Tony gasps when Steve’s balls brush his, cockhead barely nudging Tony’s shaft with every thrust into the tight space between the mechanic’s thighs.
he wants Steve to come inside him, buried deep and breed him. Steve moans, other hand coming up to Tony's shoulders, pulling them as flush as possible and then Tony can feel him coming. Steve stays buried inside him for a few moments, catching his breath.
Steve starts fucking into him again; Tony comes. He doesn't know how long the drug will stay in his system.
"Tony, you just–" Steve's head drops to Tony's shoulder and Tony might be having a heart attack because the blonde groans like a wounded man, "And just because I picked you up. Do you have any idea how," Steve pauses, "how hot
drowning in arousal. Steve picks up the pace again, shifting the angle to he can fuck down into Tony, pressing the genius farther into the bed.
it really kicked in. Tony's squirming before he even has a chance to register Steve's thumb pressing at his nipple through his shirt, arching into the touch. Steve's body is so much bigger than his, and that's unbelievably hot. Tony whimpers when Steve doesn't allow him friction, and he's aching for it, hips pressing up to find something that can relieve the ache of his erection. Steve abandons his neck, undoing Tony's pants with one hand (he's definitely well practiced at that, and Tony might die. Or orgasm. Maybe both).
hurts, his hands leaving their place to try and grab at anything his can, body arching in pain. It feels like his organs are boiling, the heat scorching through his stomach. Tony can't make any noise. The pain abruptly stops. Steve presses his body close, cock now twitching against Tony's thigh. "Hey Tony, I'm right here– yeah, see?" Tony swears he's never felt worse pain in his life. He feels like his brain is fried. Steve kisses his temple, laying hot opened-mouth kisses along his jaw and throat.
The touch-ups on Steve's suit are easy. By the time Tony's done, Steve is finishing his drawing. "All done." Steve looks up, obviously startled by the sudden voice, nodding and standing. He stretches his limbs, pulling his arms above his head, and Tony has to put in actual effort to swallow because the gray tee he has on comes up to show his v-line. He's seen Cap shirtless hundreds of times, and Tony swears it never gets any easier.
He’s ready for Steve to slide into him, skin on fire, and pants when it doesn’t happen. The blunt head of Steve’s cock rests at Steve’s hole and
please just," Tony breathes a sigh of relief when Steve begins to walk again, and they move past the couch (which is where Tony thought they were going,) into the spare bedroom that Tony has connected to the lab just incase he's too tired to actually trudge upstairs to his bedroom. Nearly every member of the Avengers has used it at least once, including Steve.
even when Steve’s fully seated inside him. Steve breathes out a heavy breath from behind Tony and pulls the male against his chest, driving a sharp cry from the male when his cock presses into the mechanic’s prostate with the new angle. Tony doesn't have to move, Steve does it for him, hips rolling up into Tony insistently. The drag is
Tony thinks Steve is the real genius. This position offers the most skin-to-skin contact while making it good, Steve's cock buried as deep in as it can get. Tony loses himself in it for a moment and then his brain tumbles out of him when Steve's hands slide down to Tony's thighs for a better grip and he thrusts up hard, fingers pinching just enough.
Steve places firm hands on Tony’s hips, manhandling him, and all of a sudden Tony’s back is pressed against Steve’s chest, hips tilted up.
Tony thought the thigh grips were bad, but it got so much worse when Steve picks him up. His hands find themselves on the underside of Tony's thighs, close to his ass. The lift took no effort at all. Steve's face is still twisted in concern, and curiosity was added into the mix, and
“Steve,” Tony plans for it to come out sterner, but instead it’s breathless and needy, “I need it, please,” Tony goes with his needy tone, begging for it, and Steve slides his hips back to thrust into the space between the genius’ thighs. Tony’s winded at how
"Oh, bite me." Tony winces at how breathless he sounds, praying Steve's hands don't move anywhere on his thighs because if they do, he'll be done for.
"No, no, don't leave." Tony doesn't know why he's so desperate for Steve to stay, but the hand leaving his skin
Tony’s body jerks with each snap of Steve’s hips against his thighs, squirming. His cock throbs because Steve is obviously enjoying this, his eyebrows furrowed and
It doesn't take long for Tony to get bored of the arrows. He decides they can wait until later, when he's done with other things, and begins working on Steve's suit. Tony can see him in the reflection of some scrap metal that's sitting on his desk. The Captain is focused on his drawing, and Tony wonders what he's referencing.
Tony hears hurried footsteps, and sees Bruce rushing toward them. "I know exactly what it is," Bruce pants, grabbing Tony's chin and ignoring the way his body trembles at the extra touch. "Nat gave me her suit because she found a weird substance on it, and so I tested it. It got to her too, we're lucky Clint is willing–"
not as much lube as there should be, the friction almost unbearable. Tony tips his head back, groans with a heavy exhale, sinks further into Steve's embrace.
“Stop moving, Tony.” See, there’s the problem - he would, if he could. Tony has no mind power to make himself stop, mindless and needy and desperate for any stimulation that would bring him to another orgasm. Steve leans back up, shifting so he’s positioned facing Tony, looming over the male. He pulls Tony’s legs back toward him and Tony moans at the loss, cock left leaking on his stomach. Tony realizes just how wet his thighs are with his own fluids and his head hits the bed with a dull
happy to hang out with Tony for a while." Steve cracks a smile, although still worried, and Bruce rushes out.
Tony's stomach pushes out against the hand as he arches, taking Steve's cock deeper with every down-stroke. Steve groans deep into Tony's ear and Tony comes, gasping through it and clinging to Steve arms as Steve continues to fuck him. Steve
"Hey, Tony." Steve's presence is made clear as soon as he walks in, and Tony sighs to himself. Why does he have to come into Tony's area right
voice rough. Tony was to ask what Steve knew he would like, although he thinks he knows, but the Captain beats him to it, "Knew you would like being fucked into the mattress." Tony moans, shoving his hips back, and Steve laughs again. It's mocking and Tony
Steve presses forward to stretch the muscle before he’s sliding away from Tony’s hole and sliding between his thighs. Tony gasps, a desperate noise punching out of him, thighs held tight by Steve. Tony squirms, grumbling to himself. Does that asshole not understand he needs it?
The mission they were sent on ended up being a long one. The fight and clean up lasted days. It was a Saturday when the Avengers arrived back, which meant it was one of their free days. Clint, Natasha, Bruce, and Bucky all disappeared quickly – everyone took showers and went to do their own thing. Pepper was in Maryland sealing up business deals which meant Tony had the lab to himself. For the most part.
Steve leans down to nip at Tony’s throat, “Other people sleep in this bed sometimes.” He says, and Tony knows that, so why would he bother saying it in the first place? “I wonder how many of them would want to after I’ve fucked you into the mattress.” Tony moans like a whore, and he’s not ashamed to say it, because he’s craved this moment since Steve moved into the tower.
fucking him? Tony wants Steve’s cock in him, wants to be fucked into the mattress. Steve does press him into the mattress, but Tony’s not being split open, instead he drives his hips hard into Tony’s thighs a few times and then his body shudders, he groans and he’s cumming, cum spurting over Tony’s cock and stomach.
he would love to mess with Steve, he slides his fingers in further and the super soldier just takes them, smirking even with the digits in between his lips. Tony's looking to make Steve gag, but it doesn't happen, and the mechanic's fingers are pressed all the way back–
Tony’s hips rock, squirming, and his mind flies off somewhere, focused on the drugs now peaking in his system. Tony’s never been so aroused in his life. He almost forgot about it. Steve pulls away from Tony’s thighs, laying his legs on the mattress, climbing back over the mechanic and then leaning down to suck on Tony’s nipple. He lays an open-mouthed kiss over the arc reactor and Tony sudders, trying to wrap his legs around Steve’s waist for
Tony pulls out his phone and fiddles with it a moment. He slides it across the table to Steve. "Since you came back from your tour of twenty-first century America. It took awhile before things got serious, but that's when we started."
"You said we fought, in your memories," Tony says. "What if you suddenly 'remember' us being enemies again and start fighting me? Or any of the others? What if you 'remember' a world where you never were Captain America?"
"Wow," Tony says. "If I'd have known all it'd take to get our love life back up and running was fancy chocolate cake..." he trails off at the expression on Steve's face.
"Absolutely," Tony affirms. "But having forgotten this place even exists, I don't think you know what your favourite food is."
If Steve steered them back towards the club they bumped into Tony in last time, well it was a good club. Nothing wrong with that. He also wanted to see if Tony was right and the bouncer would let him in now he was dressed nicely.
"Right," Steve says slowly, because he remembers being told about something similar in his own world.
Tony grins. "Baby, that was the best date of your life, and if you don't get back to normal soon then we're going to do it again to refresh your memory."
"Understood," Steve agreed gratefully. He couldn't say he appreciated the interrogation or the invasion of privacy, but it was worth it. Looked like he was going to get a dramatic airport scene after all. Bucky would be thrilled.
"Before I let you interrupt the trip I had to work my ass off to get him on in order to get over you, I want to hear your apology," she said. "I want to make sure it's an actual apology and I want to hear the sincerity in it."
"Yeah," Tony nods. "Voluntary treatment for PTSD and brainwashing. He's doing okay. You visit a few times a week when there's not a mission."
"Okay, I'm gonna go out on a very arrogant limb here and say this is all gonna be the same right up until you get back from your road trip," Tony says. "Which means whoever and wherefore revolves around us. Me and you."
"No," Bucky said. "Peggy and Angie are heading over as we speak, and they will be on my side in this, and you will go out wearing this."
"Then you're pretty much the only person in the country," Tony said. "I've been out since I was nineteen."
Bucky fixes him with a look that says he knows Steve is holding something back, but he lets it slide for now. "I'm doing good. The, uh, the new meds seem to help with the sleeping thing. Finally found a dose that doesn't wear off before I've even hit the pillow. Got nine hours last night. Feels like I'm brand new."
Tony turned to him with a puzzled frown. "Um, yeah. I thought that was pretty clear. But, you know, you're the one who asked me out, so..."
"Hey, I'm not the one who started it. You told me I pissed you off before I'd ever said two words to you," Tony said. "Then you called me an asshole and blamed me for Obie's double dealing."
Steve fidgets. There's something he's been wanting to ask and now seems like it might be the time. "Tony?"
"Because we don't generally ask for help from people who tried to kill us?" Tony says slowly. "If you want to go down that road then I'll be honest, it does give us a lot more options, but I'm not sure if they're the kind of options we want."
"Hello," the guy with the curly hair and the regular glasses spoke up and then cleared his throat. "I'm Bruce. My temper gets the best of me a lot, and it's like I change into a whole other person. I want to learn how to stop."
"It's... hard. To think about how things went for you, when I know how they went for me," Steve admits. "That just us being together makes that much difference... it doesn't seem real."
The waiting was hellish. The lounge was comfortable enough, with deep sofas, large windows and a TV playing the latest news segment fixed to the wall. A woman who wore a uniform that looked several times more expensive and professional than Steve's best suit but also like she might step into a nightclub at any second kept bringing them refreshments and a digital clock on the wall kept them informed of the local time in at least six different places, making the whole thing seem more like they were the ones on a private jet waiting to land. It was over an hour before Virginia returned, Tony a little way behind her, eyes covered with obnoxiously large and expensive sunglasses and attention on the cell phone in his hands.
"Hi," Steve managed through his suddenly dry mouth. It would be a lie to say he hadn't pictured having to give his apology in front of an audience, his exposure to an inordinate number of romcoms meant he'd pictured everything from the dramatic airport scene to the heartfelt confession in the middle of a rainstorm, but picturing is a lot different than doing.
Steve nods, mind stuttering over the part where one of them has to die. He's bet his right arm that Tony plans on that person being him. He can't let that happen. Tony has Pepper to go home to, a future, a clean energy company that deals with disaster relief that the world desperately needs.
Virginia met him outside the building, or he would genuinely have had no idea where he was going. Apparently Tony didn't do aeroplanes with other people and had come in on a private jet.
Steve fumbled for a reply, because sure, what he did was a little messed up, but he'd been over this in sessions. He wasn't ashamed of being a little guy, he knew he had value.
