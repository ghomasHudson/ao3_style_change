“Mmm!” Sherlock groaned, throwing his head back as John immediately started abusing his neck. The hot water cascaded down around them, soaking their hair, tingling their skin. Sherlock was desperate to be touched, desperate for release, desperate for John. The blond seemed to be intent on teasing him though, running his tongue along Sherlock’s skin, nipping at his collarbone, in short, driving him insane. He needed more. He reached down, and shoved his hand between johns legs.
He could feel more fluid leaking from his cock, his underwear undoubtedly soaked. John was getting so turned on by the noises Sherlock was making, and by the sight of him rocking his hips, throwing his head back, his lips parted in a silent scream. John moved to place his lips on the sweet spot where Sherlock’s ear and jaw met.
Sherlock did as he was told, and allowed John to push the pillow underneath him. He shuffled about to get comfortable, then lay still while John sorted out the lube. He squeezed a generous amount of it on to his hands, then after a nod from Sherlock, gingerly applied it to the brunette’s hole. Sherlock gasped, and tipped his head back. He sat back up after a moment, and watched intently as John coated his cock with the gel like fluid. The blond inhaled deeply, and moaned quietly as he breathed out. Once he’d sorted himself out, he settled himself in between Sherlock’s butterfly spread legs.
He set the fire extinguisher he’d been using on the table, and took off his goggles. John grabbed him by his waist, and rested his head on his shoulder.
The pair stumbled out of their room after getting dressed only to find Rosie, Molly and Irene sat on the sofa.
He puts his hands up in mock surrender, and puts his head phones back in. Lunch time comes around, and everyone filters in to the dining hall. Mike and I sit in the far corner with a few other inmates including Henry Knight, Billy Wiggins and Philip Anderson. I don’t like Anderson, and the feeling is one hundred percent mutual, but he hasn’t tried to shiv me yet, so the jury is still out.
I feel every protective instinct I have for Sherlock desperately trying to over ride the confusion, the rage, the disappointment I also feel towards him right now.
“The posh twat wanted to get pissed.” Irene chuckled as she tried to pull her leg out from underneath Rosie.
I mean, I’ve only just got settled back in to knowing how much time is passing me, god bless clocks, but it’s not just that.
I bite down hard on the makeshift gag in my mouth, the image of John’s face burnt on to the inside of my eyelids as my cock spasms, a steady stream of ejaculate shooting from the end, filling up the sock.
“Right, you’re gonna lie down, and I’m going to check your vitals. I don’t think you’ve OD’d, but I’d rather know for sure.”
“Skip the fucking cocktails.” He breathed finally. “Sorry girls, I just remembered we have a thing we have to go to. Ummm... here’s some money for the bill... catch you later.”
John, desperate to chase after the pleasurable sensations he was feeling didn’t hesitate before bucking his hips forwards.
“Opening a tin. What does it look like?” Sherlock snarked, the tin of pineapples clearly getting the better off his emotions.
The housekeeper, a young woman, maybe in her early 20s, took the pie, and placed it on top of the arguer before leading
Sherlock was stood behind her mother in the kitchen, trying to convince her to let her go into town with John.
John stared down at her big blue eyes, then at her plump lips. The pair didn’t hear the last few numbers as they stared at each other, gradually leaning closer.
John was in complete bliss, waves upon waves of pleasure hitting him with every thrust. He only wished Sherlock was enjoying it as much. As it went on, he continuously asked her if she was ok, and each question was meant with a firm, positive answer.
“You’re so beautiful. So clever. So talented. So strong.” John murmured between kisses. “And I love you more than anything.”
“Sherlock! Go out! There’s £20 in my coat pocket, take John out for dinner!” They heard Mycroft yell through the wall.
John squeezed his thighs harder, gently grazing his milky skin with his nails as he pulled him closer. Sherlock got louder as John’s movements got faster. By this point, he was having to hold Sherlock down by his hips as they bucked off the bed at a rapid pace.
Sherlock watched as John walked away, shifting his weight from foot to foot, fiddling with the keys in his pocket. He eventually walked over to the changing rooms, and leant up against the building as he waited for John. The blond finally reappeared, a grin forming on his face once he spotted his companion. After a quick look around him, he grabbed Sherlock by the arm, lead him round the back of the building, and pressed him up against the wall as he attacked his lips.
“I don’t actually want them to catch us, I just like the thrill that they might. That we might get caught...” Sherlock purred the last bit in to John’s ear as he reached down between them to tug at the blond’s cock.
It’s Christmas lights, not candles; it was orange juice and pasta for dinner; it’s not a king sized bed, it’s sofa cushions adorn with pillows and blankets, but I don’t care.
“John... I need you now.” Sherlock whined, bringing his hand to his lap to palm at himself through his skirt. John turned around at this, and Sherlock quickly removed his hands. John saw what he was doing, but pretended not to notice.
Johns focus was slipping away as he was grasped by the sensations caused by Sherlock’s mouth, the stimulation maddening. He bucked his hips up, ramming his cock down Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock gagged a little, but he didn’t let go. He continued to bob his head non the less, ignoring the tears springing in his eyes. They had an understanding that if Sherlock wasn’t comfortable, and he couldn’t answer with his mouth full, he would use hand signals, or blink repeatedly. John watched him cautiously for his reaction, but he simply looked up at him with wide blue eyes, and carried on moving his mouth, his lips reddened, slick with saliva and pre-cum. John took initiative again, and held Sherlock’s head in place as he began to frantically thrust his hips off the bed.
I know I’ve already told him I want him to, but he seems to have either forgotten that in the midst of his pleasure, or he just wants to warn me in case I’ve changed my mind.
Long chapter here, hope you enjoy! 1914 won’t be long, and romance will blossom soon! Let me know how much ‘sauciness’ you guys would like. ;)
He gasps as the cold steel pushes in to his flesh, warm blood collecting on the front of his khakis.
I still can’t feel my legs. I’m still counting seven fingers on my right hand. I am however, aware of John tucking me up in a blanket, and holding me close to his chest.
“Yes, I am familiar with his work.” I murmur before I start tearing my face off, and shred it in to a million pieces.
A sob wracked the brunette’s body as he sank his teeth in to johns flesh, causing the other boy to let out a cry of his own.
“Oh yeah?” John drawled, running his hands down Sherlock’s spinal column and coming to rest on his hips.
“Oh, I liked him too.” She said, realising the final verdict rested on her. “Charming, not so much to be cocky, and awkward enough to know he was genuine.”
Sherlock could feel John’s erection pressing into his back, which fuelled his arousal. He shuffled awkwardly as he desperately resisted the urge to turn around again. His jeans were tented up in front of him, the inside of his boxers already damp.
I cannot help myself but thinking of this analogy as I throw my arms around johns neck, pulling him closer.
“What a good boy. You took your punishment so well.” John cooed, reaching down to stroke Sherlock’s cheek.
“Shit. That’s hot.” John rumbled as he slowly pulled them down so they were bunched around his knees along with the attached garters. Sherlock grinned to himself at Johns reaction. He watched as the blond reached over for lube and a condom.
Sherlock slowly swirled his tongue around the head, taking in the taste of pre cum. John groaned loudly, and threw his head back. Sherlock began to bob his up and down, comfortable with the weight on his tongue. He knew he could get four inches back before he’d start gagging, so he took in a little more.
“I’m your mother darling. I thought there was something special between you, although at the time I just thought it was a very special friendship.”
Sherlock stopped squirming for a moment, and whined, a whine that became a moan as John slipped his tongue into his ear with expert precision.
The brunette was reading a chemistry book in the library, some notes scrawled on a notebook beside him.
At the time, John had been horrified at her words, but now he felt he understood what she meant. Whether he cared or not, his friends would still be dead, and all the soldiers in the trenches would be their mourners.
Honestly, I hate people sometimes. Work was alright, but some dick on the road cut me up. I stalk in to my flat, and settle on the sofa to watch the football. After the match, I flick over to one of the porn channels. It’s one of those cringey ones with shitty dialogue and a shitty plot. That doesn’t mean its not turning me on. I watch for a little bit, but I’m very quickly distracted by images of the boy from yesterday... I still don’t know his name... but his gorgeously chiseled face is etched in to my brain. I take my aching cock in hand, and begin to pump my wrist up and down. It’s stress relief, if nothing else. I’m not even watching the television anymore; the image of the boy in only his towel is enough to have me moaning and arching my back. I bite my lip to silence myself as I cum hard, some of it going on the floor, but the majority goes in to my hand. Normally I feel relaxed and soothed after, but now I feel nothing but shame. I have to be back at work again in just under five hours. At least for now, I’ve satisfied some of my urges.
Sherlock was correct, up to a point. Mycroft had always been a chubby child, but after a massive growth spurt, he’d seemingly been stretched out like play dough, and had dropped all the weight.
This chapter is a smutty one, but if you don’t want to read it, it’s not so key that if you skip it, the next chapter won’t make sense; It’s really more of a bonus chapter. Hope you enjoy it.
Sherlock paused her singing, and looked down at the once again sleeping baby. She sighed in relief, and slumped back in the chair.
Sherlock leant in by johns ear, and whispered low enough that only he could hear. “That’s actually where I bought the panties you love so much.”
John pulled out as gently as he could, and disposed of the condom before going in search of his jeans.
“I hear from Harry that she and John are to be returning today.” She pointed, eyeing Sherlock over her tea cup.
John pressed an open mouth kiss to his lips, swiping his tongue along Sherlock’s briefly before pulling back with a grin.
His dark locks frame his face, a few stray, ebony curls hanging over his brow-bone; the Christmas lights casting multicoloured shadows about his porcelain skin.
He lined his throbbing cock up with Sherlock’s entrance. He placed his hands on his hips, the band of the panties between their skin. He inhaled deeply, and thrust into him.
I don’t have permission to look there. You’re special, and I don’t want to... I don’t want to do that.”
As John pulled Sherlock in to the room, he thought about how this was pretty much all down to him. Then again, Sherlock was always full of surprises, and he might have some knowledge of the carnal variety locked away up there.
I bob my head up and down a little faster, swiping my tongue, gently grazing the soft skin with my teeth.
I watch the blue eyed boy as he moves around his cube, reading, pacing. He paces a lot. A few times, I think I feel him watching me in the bubble, but I never catch him looking. I get moved to the warehouse in my last hour, so I don’t see him for the rest of the day. That doesn’t mean I don’t think about him though. It occurs to me at some point during the second half of the rugby match that I don’t even know his name. That’s my mission for tomorrow.
Sherlock is defiantly playing up to the role to the best of his ability, digging his heels in to the ground, cursing, shouting, attempting to break free of my grip on him as I drag him across the grounds.
Sherlock felt a wave of confidence hit him, and grabbed John by his tie to pull him down to his lips. It was tentative, and sweet, their mouths opening slowly to allow their tongues to gently caress one another. When they broke away, they were both breathing heavily.
“Yes.” I say finally. “It is. They spend time together, asking questions, swapping stories, finding out what they have in common.”
John leaned in towards him, and pressed his lips up against Sherlock’s. He would have pulled back after if he hadn’t felt Sherlock’s hands move to grip his shoulders. He could feel that the narrow teen was shaking. Sherlock, who was so sure of everything, and confident to the point of obnoxious, but was reduced to a simpering mess in johns arms. John snaked his arms around Sherlock’s waist, pulling him closer. He felt him relax against him at this. John ran his tongue along the brunette’s soft, plump lips. A small moan escaped Sherlock, which turned into a whine when John slipped his tongue into his mouth. When they pulled apart, they stared at each other, eyes hooded.
John followed Sherlock into the bathroom, where he hoped the sound of the shower would drown out Sherlock’s screams of pleasure.
Sherlock let out a strangled moan when he heard John refer to himself as ‘Daddy’. He was so desperate to cum, his limbs shaking with arousal, his head fuzzy.
John couldn’t help but smirk to himself as he watched Sherlock squirming, one seat over, one row in front, knowing all the while that he was the reason. It was extremely hot. He knew very well what he’d be fantasising about tonight.
Yes, I know this isn’t what you guys were hoping for, but they will get togetherness soon. I cant have Sherlock being too young.
“I need to have my bandages changed. My mother needs to contact a nurse.” He flinched when he ran his fingers over a particularly sensitive spot.
John took a moment to catch his breath, then reached over to his bedside table to grab some tissues and wet wipes.
“I’m so... I’m fucking useless... I can’t... I just needed to turn my brain off... just for a minute... just to make it stop. I...”
I’m not able to offer him a verbal response just yet, so instead I place a badly aimed kiss to his temple.
No one was sure how Greg’s name had failed to sink in to Sherlock’s head, but they knew for sure that it wasn’t something he forgot on purpose. They simply corrected him, and carried on, although it didn’t matter how many times they told him.
Falling asleep here is always difficult. Either it’s panic and fear surging through you, the sinking feeling we call loneliness, or it’s the fact that the beds are really uncomfortable.
He doesn’t seem to mind, in fact he seems very enthused as he gently pushes his tongue passed my lips.
“Jesus...” he sighed in a cross between exasperation and pleasure as he felt his morning wood press in to the mattress.
I feel a fluttering in my stomach, and I have to bite my lip to prevent any embarrassing noises from escaping.
Sherlock’s voice is barely above a whisper as he leans his head up, and props himself up on his elbows.
“I do understand, I suppose.” I say after a moment, my gaze now drifting to the floor. “I... I guess he just didn’t want me to end up like...”
Sherlock stared down at the plate of food in front of her, and picked up a forkful. She  hesitated for a moment before forcing it past her lips. She only managed to swallow another two mouthfuls before she felt sick. She pushed the plate away from her, and took a big gulp of water.
He kissed Sherlock till they were both breathless, the. left him with the promise that they’d make out in the storage cupboard at school on Monday.
I give him a questioning look, and he catches on, thankfully, eliminating my need to actually ask him the question.
Sherlock halted in his steps. This was just one of the names people had called him over the years. 'Freak, creep, nutcase, lunatic, basket case, looser, dork.' He bit back tears, and tried to put those memories at the back of his mind. He hadn't noticed the other two teenagers had gotten closer to him in his daze.
John nodded. He felt relieved that his mother at least supported him. He moved closer to her and rested his head on her shoulder.
Sherlock’s moans got louder and louder as the minutes went by, as did johns. The blond came to the conclusion that he needed to pace himself if he wanted this to last. He felt loose enough to try the vibrator. He grabbed the green object with a shaky hand, and brought it up to his hole.
Once John got over his surprise, he moved his hands down to cup Sherlock’s thong clad ass, pulling him closer. He felt himself salivating as he looked down at Sherlock’s erection straining against the thin fabric of his lace panties.
“I must say, I do appreciate it when others prepare for events, although this is a little different from what I think they had in mind in the scouts.”
That was this morning. He’d decided to leave out the change in plans as he wanted to surprise Sherlock. In the end, he ended up being the one surprised.
“Let’s try this again.” John ginned against Sherlock’s lips as he lay him down on the bed. He positioned himself between Sherlock’s legs, his hands either side of his dark head, his muscled arms trapping the slighter teen. He kissed Sherlock’s lips hard enough to bruise them, nipping at them with his teeth, running his tongue along their smooth surface. John moved his head down to Sherlock’s alabaster neck, and began sucking there, leaving dark love bites.
“You climbed up the trellis...?” She said in a half query as she looked past him and out in to the dark.
As sexy as Sherlock looked in his little outfit, John preferred him completely naked. He made quick work of the corset, and pulled it off.
She eyed him for a moment before taking another inhale. She didn’t cough this time, and instead let the smoke envelope her insides.
The next morning, I feel relaxed, almost calm, not completely, but close. I go down to the showers, get washed and dressed, then off to the cafeteria for breakfast. Everyday the same, like clockwork.
Sherlock sat up, and pulled his knees up under his chin. John sat down, and pulled the brunette’s long legs over his.
“Oh!” Sherlock squealed in surprise as John dropped them both on to the bed in a tangle of long, gangly teenage boy limbs.
Sherlock sat as still as she could as Mrs Hudson combed her hair into two pigtails, which tamed it for the most part.
“I like to hear you. Like to hear you scream my name.” John groaned, thrusting his hips as fast as he could.
As his dressing gown hid what he was wearing underneath, he looked exactly the same as earlier, and John failed to look up.
“Dad is going to go ballistic when we go home, in fact he might even call you first in a fit... and ummm... i’m the reason why.”
John raised an eye at the usually blunt, and brutal teen. Even Sherlock thought he may have been laying it on a bit thick, but it seemed to be working.
“These are going to have to be burnt...” he grumbles as he looks down at his trousers with abhorrent distaste.
John pulled back from her to look at her. He found himself sobbing when he realised it could be for the last time. They heard a conductor ordering the men to get on the trains.
I frown at him, but close them anyway. He takes my hand, and leads me for the remainder of the walk.
John’s lips pulled into a smirk as he looked at Sherlock. His cheeks were flushed, his mouth was parted, and his eyes were wide as he vied against the handcuffs. John felt his cock ache at the sight before him. He loved seeing Sherlock like this. Desperate.
“Ah!” He groaned when Sherlock immediately pushed their bodies flushed together. The brunette moved his lips down to johns neck, biting and sucking. John moaned loudly as Sherlock continued his decent down his body, slowly sinking to his knees as he went.
“Ummm... Do you have a diaphragm?” The blond asked, his voice husky, knowing full well the odds of which were very unlikely.
Sherlock turned around, and headed for the lab, stopping by the door to make sure John was following him. They entered the room, and sat down at the front of the still empty classroom.
His back arched as John stretched him, his mouth gaping in pleasure. John slipped in another finger, grinning when he felt Sherlock convulse around him.
He looks vulnerable as he sits there wrapped in my basic grey towel, his dark tresses dripping water down his face, hence the need for a towel.
John could hear Sherlock mumbling the words 'colleague, promotion, and lipstick' over and over again as he wandered around the living room.
He reconnects our lips in a passionate kiss, and sucks my tongue in to his mouth in such a way that I am very concerned that I’ll cum untouched.
Sherlock helped John clear up the plates, then they awkwardly stood in the kitchen as Mrs Watson put some food and a drink on a tray, presumably to take up to Harry.  They moved back into the living room after she went upstairs, and sat down together. John had curled up in the corner of the sofa, and was staring at the wall, his eyes completely glazed over.
“Yes! Yes! Yes! Don’t stop! YES! YES! OH FUCK! YES, JOHN! AH! AH! AH! AHH!” Sherlock screamed as he came hard all over his thighs and the bedspread.
“Moly dear, would you like a cup of tea?” Mrs Holmes asked, placing a hand on the young nurse’s arm.
“Indeed.” John grinned at Sherlock in the candlelight, his eyes soft, warmer than they’d been in a long time.
He brought his tied wrists up to his face, and stuffed his fists into his mouth. He let out muffled sounds of pleasure as John continued to smack his ass, no doubt leaving marks all down his skin. Sherlock felt Johns breath right by his ass, followed by a bite. Sherlock cried out in ecstasy, his fists falling from his mouth.
“Ok. Ok.” He cooed, tilting Sherlock’s chin up so he could press their lips together. “I’ll pay... attention... to you.”
“He essentially is the British government, yes.” I nod, wondering why my ‘oh so successful big brother with the amazing job at only 26 years old’ has to do with anything. “Why?”
Sherlock blushed. Although he definitely knew he was a boy, he preferred the compliments normally aimed at girls. Pretty, not handsome.
I move my fingers to his collar and begin unbuttoning his shirt. My lips travel further  down his body, planting kisses on each inch of newly revealed tanned skin.
John got up from the chair, took the laptop from Sherlock, and typed into the search engine. He sat down at the edge of the bed, the laptop resting on his thighs. He clicked on the video, and turned the laptop so Sherlock could see. Said curly haired boy leaned in closer so he could see, only a few inches away from John.
Sherlock grinned, and made his way across the floor. He dropped his dressing gown, and John licked his lips. Sherlock was stunning. Long legs, perfect cock surrounded by dark curls, smooth skin, lightly toned stomach, sharp cheekbones, and glistening silver eyes. Silver eyes that were focused on John, hungry.
“If you do intend to befriend him, I’d be more than happy to do homework assignments for you, or turn a blind eye when you get in trouble.”
The wonderful thing about having a mind palace is that one really can concoct the most vivid fantasies.
They quite often went to each other’s lectures if there were spare seats as their subjects occasionally overlapped.
“Ahh...” Sherlock whimpered as John began to toy with his nipples, the sensitive buds hard from arousal.
John blindly excepted the mug and took a cautious sip, knowing full well Sherlock’s lack of ability to make decent tea.
John positioned the pillow under the small of Sherlock’s back and positioned himself between his long legs.
“I appreciate how dedicated you are to him, darling. I wish I could stay with him, but my back can’t handle the sofas.”
The elder looked up when her sister’s presence was made known by her slightly heavier than usual footsteps.
While they dealt with all the formalities, Sherlock eyed up Greg, and made her deductions. Avid smoker, pipe not cigarettes, owned a large dog, social drinker, sportsman.
“Tear it, rip it, I don’t fucking care.” Sherlock hungrily attached his lips back to johns, carving his lips with his tongue.
That moment, right before you kiss someone, it’s filled with tension, heat, a desperate yearn for the other person. What I feel right now, it’s something much deeper than simple attraction or desire. I can tell by the look in his eyes that he feels it too. That need, that avid thirst is what makes him eventually lean in.
Mrs Holmes placed a pair of navy blue, pyjama trousers and a long, white sleeved shirt in his hands.
He reconnects our lips again in a sloppy, messy kiss, muffling the quiet whimpers that escape me as he begins to pull out.
Sherlock smiled in to the kiss, and reached up to tangle his hands in johns hair. John responded by hoisting Sherlock up to straddle his waist. The brunette moaned softly as John gripped his hips and began to rock him back and forth. John tugged at the hem of Sherlock’s pyjama top before pulling it over his head, only parting their lips for a second.
John attached his lips to Sherlock’s neck, drawing the soft skin into his mouth, and leaving love bites all the way down to his shoulder.
Sherlock and John have to make a decision that may throw them both in danger and challenge their morals.
As I look at the brunette, eyes wide and youthful, a constant reminder of how, while not inadequate, as he put it, how very innocent he is.
He stayed still for a moment braced on his arms, his lip chewed between his teeth as he tried to deny the intense pleasure he was feeling.
As in tune as are we, he seems to get the message, and speeds up. Not only that, but he lands a sharp smack across my bare ass cheeks.
I lean in and press a kiss to his lips, my heart all but fluttering when I feel him smiling in to the kiss.
“I don’t have wipes in here. I should probably take a shower in all honesty. Are you ok here?” Sherlock asked as he stood up to grab for his dressing gown.
The guard turns around, and I come face to face with him. The blond guard. Oh, he’s even more gorgeous up close. His eyes are a deep, stormy blue, his skin is a warm, tanned hue, his lips are thin and pink... his lips... I look back up at his eyes. He hasn’t broken focus. He’s still looking at me.
Todd Jefferson, a tall lad with spiked, black hair that contrasted with his light green eyes was stood at the bottom of John’s bunk.
The bell rang, and Sherlock was already on his feet, and leaving the room before molly could ask him about tomorrow. First lunch, then English, and finally Chemistry. He liked that. Not only the subject was enjoyable, but he was rather fond of his teacher, Mr Lestrard. He was a tall chap in his early 20s, and had endless patience for Sherlock’s bullshit, even though he knew the teen thought he was smarter than him, and regularly tried to prove this. He found himself an empty table in the corner, and quietly sipped on his milk. He felt someone walking up behind him, and started coming up with a nice way to tell molly to go away. He was surprised when instead of molly, stood a dark haired boy of average height, a pair of spectacles balances on the end of his nose, and a blazer that really didn’t fit him. Mike Stamford.
He was panting heavily, his chest rising and falling rapidly as he used his ankles to pull John to him.
“We don’t really have time for this... and yet...” Sherlock coos softly as he runs his hand up my inner thigh, dragging his fingers over my hard on.
He bit down on Johns shoulder as his orgasm hit him, waves and waves of pleasure crashing down around him. It didn’t take very much to send Sherlock over the edge, but that didn’t make it any less rewarding. John couldn’t help but moan as well as he watched Sherlock come apart. Sherlock was in too much pleasure to pay any mind to the fact that this was now the second time John had made him cum in his underwear.
The gift had come. It was a small gold locket. John had sent a letter to Mrs Watson to buy it at the Jewellers, and she’d brought it by in the afternoon. A few months back, John had sent a photo of him and his troupes. After swooning over John in full uniform, Sherlock had cut the photo to size, and put his photo in the locket. She hesitated for a moment before shoving the tin back under her mattress, and going down stairs. She tried to sit in the parlour, but her mother came bustling in, insisting she went outside.
“How would you know? I never talk to you about anything.” John hissed, his hands curling into fists.
Soon, Sherlock’s trousers and underwear were gone too. He was completely naked in front of John. There was an odd sort of thrill to it as John drank him in with hungry eyes. John ducked his head, and kissed Sherlock’s hipbone. His pelvis tilted upwards, a small moan escaping him. He watched as johns lips travelled further down his body until they were at the tip of his throbbing length. Johns eyes locked with his in asking. After Sherlock’s nod, the older boy shot him a wink, then wrapped his mouth around his cock.
I go back to kissing him, my accuracy a little hindered on account of how addled my brain is by arousal.
Sherlock rolled her eyes, and threw a bundle of blouses on to the space on the bed behind her. Their mother had made Mycroft try on about a hundred.
While John was a little chagrined at the notion of telling anyone about the intimate details of last night, but he was also rather elated at the bonding moment that was occurring between the two of them, something that had become increasingly rare throughout the years.
“Then stop acting like a little girl! You’re supposed to be my big sister, but I’m always having to look after you!”
I can’t find the words to tell him that loving him is no arduous task, that in fact it is one of, if not the greatest joy that I have the fortune of knowing. Then I realise, I don’t need the words.
He was rather taken aback by her stance. He was expecting her to greet him with as much enthusiasm as he had shown to her, especially after not having seen each other for near three months.
“Well,” He starts, moving across the room towards me till there’s only a few inches between us. “I was ‘intending’ on doing... this.”
The brunette squirmed and whimpered as John bucked forwards, thrusting his cock up inside his clenching channel.
He didn’t exactly want to bellyache to Sherlock about his pains, but his body felt as though he had taken a beating from the entire football team.
He stills his hips completely, and reaches under me so one of his hands is on the small of my back. Then, he lifts me up so I’m straddling his lap.
The next day, he’d learnt how to crotchet, the following day he put google eyes on all the appliances, minus the blown up microwave that I have yet to throw out, and the day after that he’d painted the Manhattan skyline using paints he’d made himself. It wasn’t bad.
“Bloody, bloody woman has gone off on leave again, and there’s no bloody stand in! I can’t leave, I’ve got a young man here with a case of what I believe is hepatitis. There are a few inmates who haven’t had their vaccinations against it, and the last thing we need is an epidemic. Could I trouble you to go and round them up?”
He pressed a kiss to John’s lips, one that continued down to his neck, and his chest once Sherlock pulled his shirt off. He kissed all the way down to his waistband, sinking to his knees where he felt John’s clothed erection hit the underside of his throat. John was watching him with hooded eyes as he slithered down his toned body. Sherlock rested his hand on johns legs, hoping he couldn’t see how much his hands were shaking. He was still nervous, but the shaking was also from excitement. He gingerly slid Johns football shorts down his legs, and let them pool at his ankles. Without the outer layer, Johns hard cock was very prominent in his boxers. Sherlock felt a pulse of arousal in his abdomen and his groin as he looked at it. He’d felt Johns cock against his leg before, but he hadn’t really got a good look at it. By Sherlock’s measurements, he’d guess six and a half inches. He returned his gaze to john’s face. John hadn’t taken his eyes off the brunette, his mind swirling. Sherlock made sure to maintain eye contact as he reached for the waistband of John’s Calvin Klein’s. After a nod of permission, Sherlock pulled them down. Sherlock inhaled sharply as he stared at Johns cock. It was long, and thick, larger than his own. It was a slightly different shade to the rest of his skin, and almost red in some places, flushed with blood, angry and pulsing. He’d just begun to feel confident, but after coming face to face with it, Sherlock felt rather intimidated. How was he going to get it in his mouth.
“John, John, don’t stop.” Sherlock panted, leaning forwards to place a hot and hungry kiss on his lips.
“God, there are so many things I want to do to you.” John groaned, his eyes hungry as they roamed Sherlock’s lithe body.
That evening, she’d gone to her trinket box. That was were she kept all the letters from John. It was also were she kept all the gifts from him. Wrapped in a square of velvet was the telescope he’d bought her for her birthday. She’d gone up to her window, and looked out at the stars. She knew it was cliche, but she couldn’t help but wonder whether John was looking up at the same stars.
He’s stood at attention, second nature to him of course, watching over a few of the inmates who are out getting their morning exercise.
John rolled his eyes, and ignored her. He took the bottle he bought for occasions such as this one from the back of the cupboard, and filled it with hot milk. When he got back to his bedroom, Sherlock was on the floor.
“Oh fuck.” John chuckled as they tried to reorganise themselves. Sherlock giggled, and buried his head in Johns neck. They eventually managed to stand up, and stumble in to Sherlock’s room.
That was always what he called him, never John. His father made it seem as though he was only proud of his athletic achievements. Calling him ‘champ’ almost made it seem like they had a coach/student relationship. It was so impersonal, John thought.
As I become more comfortable with the weight on my tongue, and manage to fight off the intrusive thoughts of ‘oh my god, John’s cock is in my mouth’, I begin to experiment a little.
He had grown up so much since the first time she saw him. He now had a sharp jawline, traces of stubble there from where he’d started shaving, and he’d grown about a foot in the last two years alone. Despite the changes, he was still John, and rather handsome at that. She was lucky John hadn’t noticed she was staring either.
Sherlock followed johns gaze down to the back of his skirt which was stained with sticky, white fluid.
Sherlock looked up John, kitten ears still perched amongst his dark curls, some of which were stuck to his forehead with sweat.
“I see.” Mycroft said, casting her eyes down at the clothes surrounding her sister on the floor. “Wait here a moment.”
“I know last time was hard, but we managed before, and we’ll manage this time.” John said softly, squeezing her hand between his.
Drunk Sherlock was more aloof than sober Sherlock, and she certainly had lowered inhibitions in this state.
John nuzzled Sherlock’s nose affectionately, inhaling the brunette’s scent of coffee, mint and honey, this time with the addition of the distinct smell of sex.
John pulled away to capture her lips in another kiss, hungry and desperate. Sherlock brought her hands down between them, and began fiddling with johns zipper.
Sherlock all but shoved John through the door, and quickly closed it behind the pair of them before his mother could argue with him.
“I don’t understand why he likes that game. I understand why you like watching.” She said when she noticed the small grin forming on her friends face.
Suddenly, the door to the dorms swings open. I pull away from him, and sit back under his desk, my heart thumping as panic sets in.
Sherlock nodded, then dismounted John. The blond chuckled as the other boy squirmed in discomfort as they walked up the stairs to the bathroom.
“Hey, I know you two went in here... even though I can’t see you... ummm... there’s like cake? And ummm you have to be there... I don’t...” she murmured before departing down the corridor.
The imagery of Sherlock in between my legs, on his knees, his pretty little mouth round my cock... that coupled with the knowledge that he got himself off last night to the fantasy of my words.
“Obviously there’s a problem, or you wouldn’t be here... and I’m assuming Holmes is the source. Not that you’re a problem, Holmes, I just meant that-“ She cuts herself off, and pulls a face as she berates herself. She always has been a babbler.
I look past Moriarty’s shoulder, and see Mr Lestrade standing in the corridor. He’s the man in charge around here, something I’m grateful for as he’s actually a nice man.
“There are so few opportunities in which that sentence is valid.” Mycroft mused as she took her empty tea cup out to the kitchen.
He brushes his fingers along my waistband, then gently drags them up my spine, making my hair stand up on end. I roll my hips forwards again, more violently then before, pressing my body as close to his as I can, but it’s still not close enough... I press my pelvis in to is, causing his raging hard on to rub against mine, and oh fucking hell thats not enough either.
“Alright, I’m going out. Please keep the sex confined to your bedroom. Not that I care, but Molly and Rosie might throw you out if they find anymore of Sherlock’s underpants under sofa cushions.”
I think he knows this too as he brings one of his hands down to my ass, running his fingers down the seam of my trousers.
Sherlock frowned. He hated clubs. Dancing with John was fun, but Sherlock argued they could do that in their living room.
Enjoy! Thanks for the lovely comments, and the prompt for this chapter (Sorry can’t remember who it was)
“I didn’t, I just gave him the keys... look are you going to do this or not? Because I’m sure Lestrade would love to hear that his favourite guard has been fucking the local basket case.”
She cautiously placed her hand on John’s other knee, and smiled when he placed his hand over hers. He seemed to have relaxed a little since that morning, the physical pain distracting him from the emotional.
“Jake Smith. He’s the one shouting at the ref.” She sighed. “I’m Rosie.” She extended her hand to the lanky teenager.
“I’m gonna call Mycroft and tell him he might be getting a visitor.” Greg said, then took Rosie with him as he went outside to make the phone call.
Of course, such with anything of the likeness, these moments are juxtaposed with the hours of harrowing emptiness that follow.
He groaned loudly when john moved cube on the base of his throat. The irony of feeling on fire while you had ice cubes dragged across your skin was not one lost on Sherlock as he yanked his arms forwards in vain. He gasped when he felt Johns breath on the wet spot on his throat, keening in to the blond’s touch.
Mrs Watson chuckled, his softened exterior and charm working on her. She was in her late forties, a natural blonde, but now had to dye it to hide the grey, had a job in the city, was an only child, and had divorced no fewer than five years ago.
The air had finally started to warm, the days were longer, the sun peaked through the clouds, and the wind was nothing more than a friendly embrace.
Sherlock reconnected their lips, salty from where beads of sweat had rolled down from their Cupid’s bows.
He’s gentle at first, but soon he’s forcefully thrusting his tongue in to my mouth while he runs his hands down my body. I can’t help but let out a series of moans between kisses as pleasure courses through my veins. I feel myself getting hard as our kisses deepen, a rather noticeable tent forming in the front of my trousers. I don’t have much time to think about this before John grips my hips and hoists me up on to the table.
I just feel myself sinking in to them, and god I almost hate myself for it, but I trust him whole heartedly.
Johns eyes flew wide when he realised what she was getting at, but before he could comment she’d grabbed his hand and was pulling him down the street while he desperately tried to hide his arousal with his coat.
John darted his tongue out to lick his lips, a smirk forming on his face. He kissed Sherlock forcefully, emitting a groan from the younger teen.
He didn’t need to be told twice. He walked briskly out in to the courtyard. He then remembered then that John had football. He quickened his pace, and hurried over to the football grounds. He spotted John doing ‘keepy-upies’ across the field.
“He Just left. I’ve been there for him, not her, and he’s gone to see her!” Sherlock wailed, balling his fists in mycrofts shirt.
John paused for a moment to allow Sherlock to relax. He nodded for John to continue after a moment, his shoulders dropping. He mewled when John slipped another finger inside his passage, the ring of muscles tensing around his digits.
It was in this moment that Sherlock was truly great full that other people weren’t like him. If John had been like him, he would have noticed his tears, and asked him why he was crying. He could hardly say he was crying about geography homework. He’d have to lie.
“Sherlock, come here so we can talk.” He said calmly from where he stood only paces away from where she’d stopped on the lawn.
Sherlock steered them into his room, and fell on top of his bed. He very quickly mounted johns hips, straddling his waist.
John couldn’t help but marvel at the odd sensation that enveloped his over stimulated cock as Sherlock giggled around him.
Sleep was definitely a necessity, and the pair finally drifted off the sleep, neither of them worrying about the fact that Mrs Hudson had heard everything.
Without a warning, John felt the cord in his abdomen break, and with a cry of her name, he reached his climax.
“Ok.” Sherlock nodded enthusiastically. He definitely wanted to pleasure John, but a blow job was probably starting in the deep end. Sherlock climbed back on to the bed, and knelt down beside John.
When you go to a new restaurant, and the starter is absolutely marvellous, you cannot wait to try the other options the menu has to offer, despite only having a small amount of knowledge on the their repertoire.
“What is it?” John asks, slowly moving to stand closer to me, his fingertips just brushing mine as our hands hang limp between our bodies.
John was kissing him again, heated and passionate as ever. His fingers were in Sherlock’s hair, and Sherlock’s arms were around his neck, his legs wrapped around the blond’s hips.
Sherlock waved her off as she left down the lane, then went back in to John. He was staring down at the table, his eyes glazed over. His breathing was ragged, and harsh.
John strode over to her, and detached her from the bramble. She tumbled out of the fence, and into his arms.
John finally calmed down, his breathing steadied. His eyes wandered over Sherlock’s face, taking in his catlike eyes, his sharp nose, pale lips, and the little dimples in his cheeks as he grinned. He was so close if John moved about an inch their noses would be touching. If he moved two, their lips would be too.
I can tell that what is perceived as arrogance by other people is really just a desperate search for approval, validation, praise. This is just how he relates to people, and it rubs them up the wrong way. Although, I will say he is a bit if a show off. That might be underplaying a little...
“Good point. Let’s just hope that I’m not here long enough for my child to be able to write me letters.”
The bathrooms were empty as they tumbled through the door, lips on lips, hands tugging at clothing, nails raking skin.
I notice Sherlock hesitate for a moment before he complies, and pulls his sleeve up to expose his arm.
He opened his mouth to say something, his lips quivering. He closed his mouth again, unable to get the words out.
“Well, I suppose I’ll have to handcuff you. You obviously can’t keep your hands off yourself.” John said harshly, shooting a glare in Sherlock’s direction. The brunette wisely kept his mouth shut, and held his wrists out.
Mrs Holmes smiled sadly at John, then quickly glanced at her own son before disappearing into the kitchen.
“I like it very much.” John took a step towards Sherlock, and slipped his arms around his waist. “Very, very much.”
Ten years had passed since the war had begun. John’s night terrors were infrequent now, and if ever he had one, Sherlock was there to sooth him back to sleep. The battle scars were still there, if only now little silver lines.
God, everyone was so stupid. This was a thought that ran through the curly haired teen’s head nearly everyday. He was sat in his history class, wondering why he needed to know what methods the ancient Romans used when farming. He’d also fallen asleep in maths, and completely zoned out in P.E, resulting in being hit in the face by a dodge ball.
Sherlock was familiar with the mousey looking young woman from her appointments at the clinic in town.
“What I find it difficult to get my head wrapped around is the fact that you, a... genius... got caught.”
Sherlock had been lost in thought since he and John turned on to different roads at the end of the street.
This was of course a lie. Sherlock knew that John would go home after this, and he’d have to share him with other people. Here, he didn’t have to fight people for his attention. John would get bored with him, and he’d be alone again. Alone was there for him before John, it would be there after John. Alone was all he had. He blinked away the tears he felt brimming in his eyes.
Sherlock hung up, leaving John alone with his left hand, a bottle of lotion, and his imagination. Normally he would just take a cold shower, but he knew that if he didn’t get rid of this energy, he’d likely ravish Sherlock before he could even close the front door. He began to move his wrist up and down as thoughts of the curly haired boy raced around his mind. It didn’t take long for him to reach his climax, doubling over in intense pleasure as he shot his load on to the bedsheets. They needed to be washed anyway. He fell back panting, his eyes rolling in to the back of his head. He lay there for a moment to catch his breath.
Despite her protests, Sherlock had been sent to school. She spent the entire day worrying about John, and accidentally wrote his name down as the answer to an algebra question. ‘What must it be like to be in a war?’ She wondered as she stared down at her English book. Although John was home now, there was still a fight going on inside his mind. She could practically see the cogs turning in his head throughout the day.
“You’re obviously not, but if you don’t want to talk about it, you don’t have to. Just know that you can if you change your mind.”
“You need to remember to clean that up.” John said eyeing the slender boy as he threw himself down on the sofa. He stuck his tongue out, and disappeared from sight. The blond went to the fridge, but faltered before opening the door.
I scratch that thought from my mind, forcing it away so I can focus on the task at hand... at mouth?
Her eyes were empty and vacant as she stared out in front of her, a teacup full of lukewarm tea clasped in her shaking hands.
Sherlock grumbled, but kept his mouth shut. He slumped down at the breakfast bar, and picked up a newspaper.
It was normal for John to come back to the flat to find Sherlock setting fire to something in the kitchenette.
I spot him in the break room, cup of tea in hands, bags under his eyes, a discarded newspaper lying before him, fulfilling its duty instead as a coaster as he places his too full mug down upon it.
Sherlock forced himself to look away, his cheeks flushed red, and started walking towards the school doors.
Their bodies were so close, Sherlock could feel Johns heart beating by his shoulder blade, and his warm breath on his neck. He moaned when he felt Johns lips follow, trailing kisses from the sweet spot under his ear down to his collar bone.
“I don’t know. But whatever it was, I don’t recommend it. Kept seeing penguins the first day I took it.” I wheeze out a pathetic chuckle before my knees go all wobbly, and I fall.
Once Sherlock was settled amongst the pillows, John climbed back on the bed, and moved over to him. He pressed a heated kiss to Sherlock’s reddened lips while he cuffed his other wrist, and bound him to the headboard. John moved his head down to Sherlock’s wrist, and kissed his pulse point on each before returning to his face.
Sherlock sighed in agreement. If Molly knew what they got up to, she’d have to scrub her brain out with bleach.
They reconnected their lips, desperate for the others touch. John ran his hands down Sherlock’s chest, then paused, confusion plain on his face.
He attacked Sherlock’s mouth with his own, forcing his tongue past his lips as he lifted the brunette up so he was straddling his waist.
Normally, I do this as a necessary release, but there is defiantly something different about doing it for pleasure.
Henry doesn’t have either of his parents, but I have observed him attending visiting hours with a variety of friends.
Sherlock looked down between them, and saw that there was no simple defining point that he ended and John began. He switched his gaze up to johns face which was contorted with pleasure. He was clearly trying his hardest to resist from just slamming right in to Sherlock, again and again until they were both howling.
I turn towards him and kneel up. When I press my fingers to his neck, his skin his very warm, and his pulse is through the roof.
There was no point trying to deal with him during this phase, and the easiest way to get him to the next one was to actually treat him like a toddler. John had made this discovery on Sherlock’s birthday. While trying to get Sherlock to stop biting him, John had shoved Sherlock’s thumb in to his mouth. The brunette calmed down, suckling his thumb, and fell asleep on John’s shoulder during the cab ride home.
Sherlock ran her fingers through his hair, damp with sweat, and gently ran her other hand down his back.
John eyed the brunette over his teacup with a smirk playing at his lips. Sherlock was always innocent, and well behaved out and about, but at home, alone with John, he was naughty little slut. When the two crossed over, it was more than John could handle. If they weren’t in a public place, John would have him on the table, on the floor, against the wall, but for now, that would have to wait. The thought was exciting, thrilling.
Everyone could tell she was devastated John wouldn’t be there, but she hadn’t so much as mentioned his name the past month.
John spun around in his chair, and lent on his hands as he watched Sherlock make tea, the way his muscles moved under his shirt, the way his curls fell over his eyes as he bent his head. When he reached up into the cupboards to get the tea, his shirt rose up, revealing the smallest sliver of pale, smooth skin just above his belt. John quickly adverted his gaze as he felt his cheeks heating up.
He gently tilted Sherlock’s chin up so they were facing each other. Their lips connected in a tentative kiss, Johns tongue slipping in to Sherlock’s mouth. He pulled back to breath, and to pull of his boxers. He couldn’t help but grin when Sherlock, despite having seen John’s cock before, licked his lips.
Sherlock is curled up on a plastic chair in the common room, book in hand, tea in a mug on the floor, long legs folded up under him.
Sherlock lay back on the grass, hand rested underneath her abdomen as if it needed to be cradled, comforted.
“You said you wouldn’t ask for details.” John chided as an insistent Harry followed him in to his room.
John couldn’t help the string of curse words that fell from his lips as he watched Sherlock add another finger.
A room, an old break room I think, has been decorated with fairy lights, actually, Christmas lights that dangle from the ceiling, and a blanket is hung off the back of the sofa, pegged up on a bookcase and a table, creating a canopy over a pile of blankets, pillows and sofa cushions.
John started slow, sliding in inch by inch, enjoying how Sherlock got louder as he took more of his cock.
“You’ll have to borrow a pair of Sherlock’s pyjamas, although they will be a bit big. I can pop your stuff in the wash over night if you drop it downstairs.” Mrs Holmes said as she rummaged through Sherlock’s draws.
“I’m glad we did this.” He says when it’s time for me to go back on duty. “You’re right, I never get to hear this sort of thing. I only observe ‘useful stuff’. I never get to hear what matters.”
“She starts throwing objects and insults when she’s having one.” Mycroft murmured, referring to the box of tissues Sherlock threw at her head whisky calling her a tosser.
2 months then he’s out, and he gets to go home... does he still live with his parents...? Is he going to come back with me...?
John lifted his head up to look at Sherlock. He was dressed in high rise jean shorts and the crop top with daises and bees. John drew his lips into a smirk.
The athlete pulled back to admire his handwork. Sherlock’s neck was dotted with hickeys, flushed with blood, lips glistening with saliva, eyes dark with arousal. His cock throbbed from where it was still sheathed in his trousers, painfully hard. Sherlock snapped him from his daze when he sat up, and grabbed a fistful of his shirt, pulling him back to him.
John began to build a rhythm, sinking most of the way in, then pulling almost all the way out. It was torture for Sherlock, Johns cock just missing where he desperately wanted it, needed it.
John snapped out of his daze, and turned to look at the brunette, who was regarding him with his piercing, puppy dog eyes.
“You know...” he starts, pulling me to him by my hips. “one morning... we will wake up beside each other... and stay like that for the rest of the day.” He murmurs as he presses kisses in to my hair.
“She’s alive, but you need to call an ambulance. Now, Mum!” John yelled, moving his sister to the floor, and putting her in the recovery position. Mrs Watson was hyperventilating, and appeared unresponsive.
“I’m gonna... oh sherlock... you’re going to make me- ah- cum- oh!” John groaned, followed by a mumbled string of profanities when he saw that Sherlock didn’t remove his mouth, and instead, carried on bobbing his head. He then experimentally swallowed around johns cock. It was clearly the right thing to do, as john’s whole body spasmed suddenly, and a low, strangled moan of Sherlock’s name escaped him as he came in to the brunettes mouth. Sherlock gagged as the hot, salty fluid rushed down his throat. He pulled away, then looked up at John, and swallowed. This boy was going to be death of him.
She was warm, and deliciously wet, her walls enveloping him in the most intense sensation he had ever felt.
“While I appreciate the double entendres, John, if I had done exactly that, I wouldn’t be in this mess.”
Sherlock blushed, and drew his lips between his teeth. John brushed his nose against Sherlock’s nose and cheeks, breathing each other’s air. He pulled Sherlock’s t-shirt off slowly, grazing his ribs with his knuckles, making him shiver. He rejoined their lips in a passionate kiss, opening Sherlock’s mouth, and dipping his tongue in to his mouth. Sherlock made short work of Johns button down, which joined his t-shirt on the floor. John rolled Sherlock back down in to the pillows, pressing them both into the mattress.
The younger two were sent to the play room with hot chocolate and biscuits, and the older two went upstairs.
He could feel himself throbbing between his legs as he touched her, this new experience mind blowing.
“It would be an understatement to say he has never been full of brotherly love, but I was still rather surprised to find out it was he who had caused my arrest to come about.” I say matter of factually, perhaps in a vain attempt to convince John that, although having many an argument that may or may not have involved rather spectacular insults in Latin, this was extreme even for Mycroft.
Mycroft stuck his tongue out at his brother when he heard him giggling. Sherlock also stuck out his tongue in retaliation.
He paused for a moment before running his hands down her body to where her slip was tucked into her skirt. He slowly pulled it off, revealing her milky skin inch by inch. He couldn’t help himself from staring at her newly revealed breasts. They were of ample size, round and pale, tempting, with dusty rose coloured nipples on the top. He licked his lips subconsciously as he sat there, mesmerised.
Less than an hour ago, John was inside his body, fucking him for all he was worth, and NOW he was blushing?!
Anne and Kate were off to a charity ball with Mr Holmes and Mr Watson respectively, and all four children had been left with Mrs Hudson. Mycroft actually tolerated Harriet, because she had some interesting views on politics which the brunette was more than happy to discuss. John as it turns out was jolly good at chess, and gave Sherlock a run for her money, even though each game ended with a stalemate.
Sherlock causes drama on April fools. John doesn’t do pranks, but he sure knows how to get him back.
“As I’m sure many others, himself included, have informed you of his lack of practice at entertaining guests.”
“Now, that is interesting. To me, at least, but what interest is it to James?” Sherlock queried, leaning over johns shoulder to get  a better look.
Well, being a high functioning sociopath has its perks, he thought to himself, trying to prevent a chuckle from escaping his lips.
John smiled, and turned back to sit with his mum. Sherlock watched him as she munched at the biscuit, focusing on his smile, and the little dimples that formed in his cheeks. They left about an hour later with promises of dinner some time next week. Sherlock was excited, but she knew the hours would feel like days, and the days would feel like weeks.
“Photo?” Jefferson asked as he settled down in his bunk opposite John. “Sorry, I don’t mean to pry.” He said when John met him with a blank stare.
I gently tip his head back using two fingers under his chin. There are some purplish marks, finger tip sized at the base of his throat. I’d love to replace those marks caused by pain with those inflicted by pleasure.
“You’re so beautiful.” He said finally, using all his will power to look up from between her thighs.
John turned his attention back to Mrs Holmes, who continued asking him questions, seemingly oblivious to what her son was doing underneath the table.
We both look up to see Moly has wandered in to the room, Tupperware box of what I think is risotto grasped in her hands.
He gripped his leaking cock, and slid the condom down the length, moaning from the contact, already so on edge. He quickly glanced up to Sherlock, who nodded for him to continue. He didn’t hesitate before pushing in to Sherlock’s hole.
“Ok, ok. I’m going to pull out, we’re gonna get cleaned up, and then we’re gonna wait and see if it gets better.”
“Alright. But...” John drawled, lowering his voice. “You have to stretch yourself... whilst I watch.”
“The theory of aphrodisiacs is one that has been disproved many times, John.” Sherlock murmured as he stared down at the deserts before him.
“We don’t have to do anything if you don’t want to.” John said honestly, looking at Sherlock with sincerity.
He stayed as still as he could as John tied the blindfold round his head. He gasped loudly when he felt satin ties round his wrists.
John shrugged his shoulder, seemingly satisfied with this answer, and followed Sherlock in to the living room.
“Now, darling, I know you’re old enough to have sex, but being mature enough to deal with that responsibility is something else entirely.”
Sherlock wriggled, a smile on his face. He was so turned on he thought he would fall off John’s lap. John was attacking his lips again in seconds, thrusting his tongue in and out of his mouth. Sherlock started to rock his hips against johns faster than before, desperate for friction. He reached down in between them, and gave a few pumps to Johns erection, already hard again.
Mycroft looked as immaculate as always with the exception of her eyes, which ever so slightly crazy. One was bigger than the other, and she wasn’t blinking.
The two other girls chuckled, then turned their attention to the only member of their group who hadn’t been asked.
He grins in a manner I can only describe as seductive. I might not have his gifts, but I can see he’s flirting with me. I feel a rush of excitement go through me, followed by a hollow, nagging feeling as I walk away. I can be with him here, look at him, talk to him, but then at the end of the day, I go home, and I lock him in behind me.
Almost as soon as he’d got through the door, John ran in to Harriet, wrapped in a dressing gown, clearly disturbed by Johns return.
John couldn’t get enough of him. He wanted to touch every inch of him, kiss every inch of him. He moved his hands down Sherlock’s body, lightly raking his skin with his nails.
He stopped in his tracks, and turned to look at John. A smile appeared on his face upon seeing the blond.
“To think I could have been stuck there for another 19 hours.” Sherlock shuddered. “Either the battery would have given out, or I would have.”
John placed his hands on Sherlock’s knees, and rested his weight on them so he could lean down to kiss him.
John hung up, and went to his room to get his jacket. When he wore this uniform, he wasn’t John anymore, he was a soldier.
“I thought... mmm... we could do something like last time we wanted to get away... But umm... when I disobey you... you take me away to get... disciplined.”
John held back a chuckle at this, impressed with how much patience Mrs Holmes had for her, at times, infuriating son.
Sherlock careful positioned herself on the sofa in a way that John’s leg wasn’t at risk of being kicked. John wrapped his arms around her, holding her close. She lay still, staring off in to the space in front of her while she waited for johns breathing to even out. It was gentle, and warm on the back of her neck as he fell asleep, his grip on her never loosening. It was almost as though he was afraid that if he let go for even a second, he’d lose her. She knew the feeling. She snuggled closer to him, and fell asleep herself, john’s heart beating rhythmically against her back.
His eyes are screwed shut, and his mouth is parted, all sorts of ungodly sounds falling from him as ropes of creamy, sticky fluid shoot from the end of his cock.
John gestured for Sherlock to jump up and wrap his legs around his waist. Sherlock did as he was instructed, and reconnected their lips almost instantly.
“We shouldn’t have to apologise. It’s Irene that wound her up.” Rosie said, pointing a finger at the brunette.
No matter how in-tune we are with each other, we run in very different circles. This prison, this hell hole... it’s my home, for now at least.
Now I’m here, hidden away from the watchful eyes of others as I engage in secret libidinous shenanigans with a correctional officer.
I don’t have to worry about twitching as his gloved fingers come in to contact with my skin, and more about letting out noises of a more erotic variety.
Sherlock creased his eyebrows for a moment, then his eyes went wide and his lips parted as his brain caught up.
He smelt as he always did after a game; dirt and sweat, with the subtle undertone of his aftershave. John chuckled, and wrapped an arm around the lanky teen.
John woke up the following morning to find a pair of blue, cat eyes staring at him from behind a curtain of dark hair. He jumped back in surprise, his brain still a bit slow from sleep.
Sherlock stopped in his tracks, and turned to regard his companion. Before he could come up with a response, an arrogant one no doubt, John grabbed him by his coat collar, and pulled him down into a kiss. Sherlock was surprised at first, but melted into it after a moment, his arms wrapping around John.
Mycroft was the smart one, as he constantly reminded me, as the little voice in my head continues to do so.
“Mmmmm!” Sherlock moaned in to his mouth, providing John with an opportunity to slip his tongue past Sherlock’s lips.
John got off the bus a stop before his mum, and wandered in to the cafe beneath Mrs Hudson’s flat. He took a seat and ordered himself a latte before Sherlock sauntered through the door.
This landed him a blow to the abdomen. He fell to his knees, hunched over in agony. A blow to the head knocked him out cold.
“I... I can... I can always see in to peoples’ heads... but hearts... that’s much more private, and I’ve never bothered... it umm... confuses me... but you... I can see in to yours.”
It was around the third mouthful of the pathetic excuse for casserole that I spotted one of the new guards. I’d never had one of those moments where everything just stops. Everyone else around you becomes invisible, and the only person you can see is that one person. He’s blond, average height, muscular build, tanned skin, and very, very attractive. He’s just looking around himself curiously, taking in the scenery. He isn’t jumpy or skittish like like the other young guards. It usually takes them weeks to settle down, but he seems right in his element. It’s normally only the more mature guards who settle in straight away because of past experience. Surly he’s too young for that. There’s a reason why he’s so calm though. There must be.
“Fuck me as hard as you can... hurt me... treat me like the dirty criminal I am...” he gasps in a raspy whine as he rolls his hips up in to my touch.
His face softens immediately, even what may be a smile tugs at his lips. His eyes quickly drop down to scan over my form, lingering for a split second on the towel covered portion.
Sherlock waved to the blonde boy as she wriggled through the gap in the fence that divided their houses. She wondered whether John really would come over at the weekend. She made sure they had chocolate bourbons. They were johns favourite.
“I’ve seen you with Sherlock a fair bit. Are you just as surprised or am I complete idiot for missing something?”
Happy birthday. I’m sorry if this gets to you late, I’ve been swamped. I won’t bore you with the goings here, although I will say that my bloody bunk mate is still snoring. He gave me a pack of cigarettes for Christmas though, so I’ll let him off. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the gift, if of course it gets to you at all.
Just the notion of food had the brunette running for the bathroom and throwing up the contents of her stomach.
“Umm... I was meant to send you back down to medical tomorrow, but I can just have a look at you now. I just need to check for any bruises.”
Sherlock yanked off John’s hoodie exposing his toned chest. He ran his hands down John’s back, lightly raking his tanned skin with his nails.
John swallowed and nodded his head before capturing Sherlock’s lips in a messy, open mouth kiss. Sherlock squealed in astonishment when John pushed in to him again.
It’s not long before they’re all jostling my sides and taunting me with various jabs and jibes of a certain variety. I make my leave when I can, and go to bus my tray. I keep my eyes down, not sure I’ll be able to look at the guard. No need to add to their theories by swooning. I’m about to leave when I’m called.
“Ok, ok,” John starts, and grabs me by the shoulders. “I don’t want you to think I’m pressuring you, or trying to coheres you, or anything, I mean we can just spend time here cuddling, or we can forget the whole thing- I shouldn’t have have done this. I’m sorry, I-“
The words, no matter how cliche they sound, they’re still hot as fuck coming out of Sherlock’s mouth.
“Thank you for this.” He says after a moment as he rolls out from under me, instead moving to lie on my chest.
John managed to remove the hot pink plug from Sherlock’s pulsing hole, and turned off the buzzing object. Sherlock visibly relaxed, and flopped forwards on the bed, cheeks flushed pink, eyes rolling about in his skull.
Mycroft inhaled sharply. Her mother didn’t need to say anything more. For the first time in her life, Mycroft had nothing to add either. She simply nodded her head in understanding. Mrs Holmes finished her tea, then made her leave.
“Now I want you to know I’m not doing this to do the right thing... I’m doing it because I don’t want to waste another minute of my life without you. I know we’ll have to wait till I get back, but this is a start...”
John nodded, and remained where he was. Sherlock dropped his legs off Johns shoulders, and just lay there, catching his breath.
We all but fall through the door as we pull at each other clothes without removing them, stealing each other’s air with suffocating one another.
Mycroft took Lucy from her pram, and gently placed the fussing infant in John’s arms before all but collapsing in to a lawn chair. John gently rocked Lucy back and forth, making soothing sounds as he did.
“He saw me entering some confidential information for one of our under protection inmates... and he threatened to give the contact details to an ‘interested party’ ... if I didn’t edit his status to ‘allow visitors’...”
John grabbed Sherlock by the arm, and all but dragged him out the door, and continued in this manner almost all the way to the top of his road.
John attached their lips in a passionate kiss as he rubbed the bud, all the while bucking his hips in an increasingly unsteady rhythm.
“This time I have two reasons to come home.” He chuckled as he pressed his flattened palm against her abdomen.
Sherlock was in too much discomfort to have sex again quite yet, but he made no objection to the blow job he received in the disabled toilets.
John started to pump his fingers in and out of Sherlock’s warm channel. After a few moments, Sherlock relaxed.
Sherlock obeyed, and wrapped his legs around johns waist. The broad teen reached in between them, and lined his rock hard cock up with Sherlock’s entrance.
And that marks the end of the story. Thank you so much to everyone who read it and commented, it means so much. If anyone would like a sequel, I’m open to it.
John continued to pump his hips, desperate for release. Sherlock came down from his high, and fell back, panting heavily. The sensations of Johns cock still inside him were almost painful in his post orgasmic state. He let out a series of whines and whimpers, his legs and arms shaking. Johns rhythm had grown sloppy, and erratic as he got closer. A few more thrusts, and he reached his high.
Sherlock turned around, and saw a pasty faced boy, and a dark haired girl. He recognised them as Phillip Anderson and Sally Donovan. He continued on his path, and briskly walked away. He knew they were following him. In a battle of wits, Sherlock could beat anyone, no doubt about it, but he was less experienced in the physical kind.
“I want you so bad... I want to know how it feels to have my cock inside your tight, pretty little ass.”
Sherlock titled her head in contemplation before shuffling closer to John. He bent his head, and gently placed a kiss on the bruise. Sherlock felt a blush spread to her cheeks, and quickly ducked her head.
His beautiful Sherlock, who had his head propped up on pillows, his dark hair splayed about around him like an ebony halo.
“The water bill is going to skyrocket.” John chuckled as he swept Sherlock’s dripping fringe out of his face.
Sherlock grinned as he gingerly pulled johns football shorts and boxers down. This was weirdly familiar. But this time, he wasn’t going to screw up. He paused a moment to admire john’s cock, fully erect, and leaking pre-cum. Sherlock felt his dick throb, and his mouth water. He could do this. He could do this. He wanted to do this. He made sure John was watching as he moved his head closer, and experimentally darted his tongue out to lick the tip. John tasted interesting. It wasn’t unpleasant at all, just bizarre.
“It isn’t, but it’s close to John. Almost like boys called billy when their dad’s name is William. That sort of thing.”
“J-o-h-n!” Sherlock yelled out each letter of John’s name between pants as the broad teen pounded into him.
“You might want to stop... or this is going to be over before it even starts.” He chuckled somewhat nervously as he pulled his briefs back up.
My brain goes in to overdrive as I sprint down the halls, my heart pounding in my chest, pounding so I can run, pounding so I can feel fear.
She found her hands going to the locket around her neck. She had been all alone in the world, and John had found her. She had sent a letter to him two weeks ago, along with a picture of Lucy, asking whether he knew the words to the song she’d been singing, but explaining a tune to somebody via a letter was rather difficult.
"St John's Ambulance course." John said as he checked under Sherlock's curls for any bleeding, or bumps.
Sherlock followed John down the stairs and into the kitchen, where Mrs Hudson had laid out spaghetti.
Sherlock surprised himself as the words fell from his lips. And they were both surprised as Sherlock sank to his knees in front of John.
He cried out the name of the gorgeous blond before falling back on his bed, exhausted, and elated. He couldn’t help but marvel at how wonderful his body felt, practically buzzing with endorphins. He could only be sorry that he’d been asleep for his very first orgasm. He would have stayed there all day if his mother didn’t come knocking for him.
“I know, I’d sooner shave my head than go there.” Sherlock mumbled, then paused as she noted the randomness of her own expression.
I remember just how awkward, rushed, and messy it was, but what I remember more than anything was how as soon as it was over, we quickly got dressed, and hurried back downstairs before anyone noticed we had gone.
It’s definitely hot in here. It’s definitely hot, this bed is uncomfortable, and the polly cotton blend of my vest is very itchy. He places the blood pressure cuff around my wrist. If he takes my pulse, I’m screwed.
“Yes, and you can’t go to prison, which you will, because this...” I say, gesturing between us. “Is a crime.”
“Get on your knees then.” He leant in so his lips were millimetres away from Sherlock’s ear. “And take my cock like the little slut you are.”
She gave hugs to both boys, and eagerly invited them inside for tea, unknowingly adding to their caffeine intake.
“Your parents aren’t coming home any time soon, are they?” John mumbled as they stumbled up the stairs.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, so John continued, slow, gentle stokes from base to tip. Sherlock knew he had little experience to compare this moment too, but it was mind blowing. John kept their lips connected as he pumped his wrist, enjoying the moans and whimpers that Sherlock emitted. He clawed at John’s shoulders as he felt waves of pleasure wash over him.
“Here you go. The trousers are drawstring, so they’ll be ok. The sleeves on the top will be a bit long, but I’m sure you’ll cope.”
“He’s like a baby giraffe. I told you your legs were too long.” Irene said to him as she tried to keep him upright.
“He’s not. I guess he just found someone who also has no interest in emotional attachment. ‘Purely physical’” Sherlock said in quotations.
He pressed a sleepy kiss to the corner of John’s mouth, then wrapped himself in his fluffy dressing gown. He waved at John before disappearing down the corridor.
John used the remote six more times during brunch. By the fifth, Sherlock was teetering on the edge, squirming in his chair, painfully hard. He was about ready to whack Johns fork out of his hand, drag him in to the bathrooms and demand that the blond fuck him there and then. But instead, he kept quiet, and simply watched the athlete sip at his coffee, quietly coming up with a plot on what he’d do to him when they got home. Sherlock’s reactions were subtle; his eyes would close, his fists would clench, and his breath would hitch, none of these things eye catching. But john was watching. John knew he was acting on pleasure. He was hard himself just at the knowledge of what was going on. He loved watching Sherlock wriggling about, readjusting himself, desperately trying to follow the intricate story Molly was telling him. The sixth time, John left it going just a little longer. If it wasn’t for the upbeat music, lively conversation, and general ruckus of the diner, he’d be afraid someone would here the buzzing. Sherlock closed his eyes momentarily, clenched his fists at his sides, and held his breath. It made John chuckle quietly as it dawned on him that if this was happening to anybody but Sherlock, said brunette would have guessed what was going on straight away. But, it was Sherlock, and he was having a very difficult time keeping himself together. His legs were shaking slightly now, and his cheeks were a dark shade of pink. Not wanting to be cruel, John turned it off again. Sherlock exhaled a shaky breath, and took a gulp of his coffee.
Sherlock followed johns movements as he took his hand, and coated his fingers with lube. He obeyed as the blond guided him back on the bed, pulled his underwear down, and pushed his legs open.
Sherlock’s whole body seized up as he felt John shoot his load inside him, just as he asked. So good, so good, there- right there-
“Mmmm...” John groaned low in his throat as Sherlock worked his lips, his hands finding their wait to sherlock’s slender waist, gently grazing the exposed skin where his shirt had risen.
His hands had stilled, and were now gripping her ribcage just below her breasts, his nails lightly digging in to her skin.
He gives me a sultry grin before slipping through the door, and creeping back to his cube, and out of sight.
Sherlock sauntered out of the room, a grin that could only be described as evil playing on his lips.
The blond was staring at him intently, his eyes darkened with arousal, which was also evident by the tent in his jeans. Sherlock licked his lips as he stared down at the bulge, his own cock throbbing.
They turned to look at each other, a smirk playing at the corner of Johns lips. Five minutes later, Sherlock and John were fighting down johns staircase with two wooden swords. John had a bandana tied around his head, and Sherlock had a pirates hat balanced atop his unruly curls.
After some fumbling, John managed to unclip the garters. He pulled the panties down too, leaving Sherlock in only the socks. Perfect. John reached around for more whipped cream, and squirted another dollop on to Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock hesitated for a moment, then opened his eyes to look at John. He felt a wave of courage hit him as they stared at each other.
“These are all getting a bit melted now. I suppose I’ll have to resort to torturing you some other way.” John growled, lightly pinching the skin on Sherlock’s hip bone.
“My mother’s exact words were ‘oh fabulous. We can order pizza.’ I’m not quite sure why she thinks we can’t have pizza if we don’t have guests...”
Sherlock had never seen John cry before. She still remembered the first time John had seen her cry. She’d fallen off a chair whilst trying to reach a box of checkers, and he’d kissed her knee to make her better. John was hurting on the inside. She wasn’t sure how to make that better, but she went with the first thing that popped into her head. She leaned in, and captured johns lips in a kiss. His lips were warm, and soft, and tasted ever so slightly of ginger. It was only for a second before she pulled back. John was staring at her with hooded eyes. He didn’t say anything. He simply moved his arms in order to allow Sherlock to lie on his chest, where he stroked her hair till she fell asleep.
“Fuck- oh fuck- John...” Sherlock moaned, rolling his head from side to side as he felt himself getting closer.
He connected their lips in a passionate kiss, and felt the slighter teen relax almost immediately. Sherlock was confident and cocky in every other aspect of his life, but here now, with John, he was vulnerable. It was rather endearing and somewhat of a turn on to see him like this. John used his hands to slowly roam Sherlock’s body, enjoying the way he tensed and shivered under his touch. He ran his tongue along Sherlock’s full lips, asking for entrance. Sherlock moaned softly into John’s mouth as he allowed him access. John began exploring Sherlock’s mouth with his tongue, using it to brush against Sherlock’s own tongue, and using his teeth to bite at his lips. Sherlock’s hands had found their way from John’s shoulders, to his chest, then his waist. Sherlock experimentally drew in a breath, his lips still connected to John’s. This move proved effective as John groaned softly, and moved further into sherlocks space. Sherlock felt arousal course through his body as he felt something hard poke against him.
“John!” Sherlock shrieked, trying to bat John away. A few more ‘vicious’ attacks occurred, including Sherlock trickling the chocolate sauce inside johns shirt, and down his chest. John went to retaliate with a combination of what was still left on the plate, but Sherlock grabbed his wrist before he had a chance to wipe it on him.
“Hey, mike. Yeah, I just got here.” The blond smiled, thrusting his hands in to the pockets of his leather jacket.
“Why... why isn’t he here?” She wailed, finally accepting comfort from her mother as she sat down beside her.
John couldn’t help but think that this might be the lowest of the low as he sunk down the door and took his aching length from within the confines of his trousers. He only had the few beads of pre-cum that had dribbled from his tip to lubricate as he began to stroke his shaft.
Their foreheads were pressed together, glossy layers of sweat between them, sharing each other’s air as their lungs worked in overdrive.
Our stand off has caught the attention of the rest of the grounds’ crew, and there are now at least four inmates watching us.
Sherlock, normally quick on the uptake, was at a complete loss for words. He stood, non verbal, non blinking, just staring in to space.
“Thank fuck you’re back. Moly ‘testified’  against moriarty. That bastard has finally been kicked down to maximum where he belongs... Why are you looking at me like that?”
The low groan of his name had John reeling. He felt his climax approaching, followed by the dread that it had only been going well for about thirty seconds.
Johns lips and teeth attacked his skin, drawing all the blood to the surface. He continued leaving hickeys all down Sherlock’s body, only stopping at his waistband.
Her mother sighed loudly, and left the room defeated. A moment later, there was a knock at her door.
Maybe it was because he was familiar with the shop; maybe it’s because Irene wasn’t throwing underwear at him; or maybe it was the gentle touch of Johns hand on the small of his back.
"Jillian Cooke, murdered last week by her coworker in a crime of passion, obvious, and yet none of you have solved it."
“I can tell.” Sherlock giggled before looking down in between them then back up in to johns eyes, a sultry grin on her face.
“You are. But I love it. Now...” He pressed his lips up against Sherlock’s neck, mouthing softly at his jaw. “I wanna see how loud I can make you scream tonight.”
She sighed, but took the band from him regardless. John couldn’t help it stare at the blossoming beauty that was Sherlock
“Ah, John. And who’s this?” She asked, her eyes falling on the slim brunette. “Oh, this must be Sherlock.”
“Oh fuck...” Sherlock groaned as he slipped a finger inside himself, and threw his head back, eyes squeezed shut.
I turn my head back again when I hear a commotion coming from the far side of the room. The other inmates are jostling the blue eyed one, who’s blushing profusely. He doesn’t seem upset, embarrassed maybe, but otherwise unaffected. He’s got his head down as he comes over to bus his tray. I can’t see his ID from this angle. I can’t let him leave again.
“I’m going to get dressed.” Sherlock said, then left before John could stop him. He sat in front of his mirror, staring at his uniform clad figure. He was tall, pale, and lanky with dark hair. John on the other hand was tanned, muscular, with beach blond hair. Their differences extended from those of the physical type, and on to their personalities. Sherlock couldn’t see those looking in the mirror, but he knew they were there. He knew people were confused by their friendship, and for the first time he actually cared what other people thought of him. He cared what people would say to John about him.
“Not surprised. She hasn’t been home since Friday.” John mumbled, which earned him a sharp glare from his mother.
“I aught to come to your games more often.” Sherlock mused as he looked down at the small amount of space between them.
She just stood there, frozen, staring at him. This was a man who’d seen the hardships of war. Her breath hitched when he spoke.
He walks us backwards until he’s sat in his chair and I’m in his lap, my legs bent as I kneel either sides of his thighs.
Sherlock turned to see Mycroft lent up against his doorframe. He was basically a cat, always sauntering around, and inviting himself in places.
Sherlock draws his bottom lip between his teeth, and turns to look at me, his focus going in and out.
“Sherlock, if you go with your mother, I’ll play chess with you.” Mrs Hudson said, crouching down to be eye level with the small child.
Sherlock locked eyes with Mycroft for a moment, then looked down at the floor, his eyebrows furrowed. Was he in love with John? He knew he’d developed feelings for him, but love? Sherlock slowly rose to his feet, turned on his heal, and disappeared up stairs. The brunette collapsed on his bed, and fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow. Being sad really made one feel tired.
Sherlock grinned, and continued to dance. He reached down to the hem of the hoodie on his bare skin, and pulled it of slowly, careful not to knock the ears off his head. He pulled of his trousers in the same, seductive manner. John eyed him with a predatory look in his eyes as he revealed more and more inches of pale skin.
It’s not weird, it’s nice, although she does make a few flirty comments, I don’t pay much attention to it.
“This was the only thing I could attach myself to that was steady... and I knocked the keys off the bed with my knee- ah...”
“I’m fine. A little case of strangling never hurt anyone.” I shrug. “Well, apart from the people who die...”
Sherlock has truly mastered the art of kissing, his plump bottom lip between mine as he slides his velvet like tongue in to my mouth.
She smiled to herself as she looked out the window of her kitchen and spotted John on the lawn, a small girl playing on the floor before him.
She was wearing a yellow summer dress that was loose enough so as not be indecent, but tight enough to give away the unmistakable bump at her navel, her left hand adorn with an ornate ring rested protectively upon it.
“That’s hardly ever the case. It’s like when you receive a yellow telegram. They could be missing, but they’re probably dead.”
“God, I want to do things to you.” John groaned as he brought his hand down in between their bodies.
Sherlock was sat on the sofa opposite John, a plate of chocolate cake, topped with vanilla frosting, strawberries, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream between them.
“What a coincidence?!” She exclaimed, slapping her hands down on her knees with great vivacity, making her intoxicated companion jump.
“I’ve been working alone since Wednesday, after I told Sasha Hopkins she was an idiot for thinking electrolytes and electrolysis were the same thing.”
“Right, well I’m not your friend, I’m your commanding officer. From now on, you’re Thompson.” John said coldly. He regretted his tone of voice instantly, but didn’t say anything. He couldn’t afford to care about Thompson. He would probably end up dead. There was no point getting attached. But he could have been kinder. He knew first hand how daunting it was to arrive here. You wouldn’t know how long it would be till you could see your family. You would have to sleep in a cold, hard bed. And no one could prepare you for the knowledge that death was always following you, pressing a barrel of the gun to your head, waiting to pull the trigger.
“I... I was...” John gulped, his voice shaky. “I was walking... I was... I had my gun... and he was just there... pointing his gun at me...”
I imagine what would have happened if I’d continued to disobey John. Maybe he would have shouted at me, maybe he would have degraded me, maybe he would have dragged me away down the corridor to teach me a lesson.
They tumbled in to their room, never breaking the kiss, not able to get enough of the other. John pinned Sherlock to the door with his hips, running his hands down his body.
Sherlock was stood in front of his mirror trying on the black crotch less panties. They were high rise, with two extra bands, one that went just below his belly button, and the other sat on his hips. He’d decided he wanted to wear one of the new things he’d bought, but he wasn’t quite ready to wear anything that would show. This would be his little secret; One that he might let John in on. He pulled on a grey T-shirt with the ‘queen’ logo on it, and a pair of black skinny jeans, the two bands peaking over the waistband. He rearranged himself when he felt the denim push the fabric of the panties flush against his skin, sending a little shiver down his spine.
