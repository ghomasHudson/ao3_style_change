"Well, I can't claim myself to be a professional Thai masseuse, but I know the basics," Sherlock muttered, clearly unhappy about having to admit he was an amateur. John grinned and looked at the card again, sipping on his coffee. "Mmm, alright then. When will this relaxation occur?"
Next day there was a case in the morning and then a long list of rather questionable experiment materials that Sherlock insisted were necessary for the case. John spent the morning and most of the afternoon running around and fetching the things Sherlock needed to experiment on.
Sherlock nodded, looking at their joined hands rather than at John. “That was just an idea, it’s not –“
John didn't seem disturbed by the silence, and the fact that he'd just came voluntarily with Sherlock somehow calmed the detective's mind. Maybe he could trust that John wouldn't run away as soon as he really got into the case. That was as far as Sherlock allowed his thoughts to go on that matter and when they reached Brixton, his mind was completely focused on the case.
"The case was left in the car they came with. After the murder it couldn't have taken more than five minutes for the murderer to realise his mistake. Like everything else, the case had to be pink so all I had to do was search every alley wide enough for a car within five-minute-drive from the crime scene. Didn't take me too long to find the right skip."
So, they went to see the ballet, and John appreciated it. But he appreciated everything that Sherlock had shared that day much more.
“I have to admit now that I see the costume, that a living, dancing lollipop isn’t the most dignified of roles,” John giggled, watching Sherlock pull his costume on.
They also made miniature versions of each other and propped them up at the entrance to the gingerbread castle. John noted that the figures looked like they were up to something, to which Sherlock simply stated that they were looking for a quiet corner for a quickie.
"Angelo!" Sherlock took John's wine glass the doctor had barely touched and, like it had been the plan all along, threw it on his face. John flinched back and could only stare as Sherlock patted his face with a napkin, the man smelling like an old drunk now. Angelo arrived and before anyone could even start to say anything, Sherlock was throwing the napkin away.
One night in the fridge wasn’t nearly enough to melt it, so together they made sure the microwave wasn’t contaminated ("God knows what you have put there, Sherlock") and then let the turkey melt there as the oven heated. Sherlock was keeping an eye for the temperature while John cut the carrots and tried his best to make something edible out of the beans and cranberries and the mix of spices Mrs. Hudson had recommended.
Sherlock wrapped himself around John and snuffled into his neck before falling asleep, whatever had troubled him now forgotten, and John soon followed him.
“So we’re never going to eat on the table again,” John sighed, following Sherlock and starting to pull the ingredients out of the fridge. “With the speed you pile new stuff on it, you’ll never get it cleaned like you promised…”
"Now and then, yes." Sherlock must've seen that John wasn't really thinking he had done it, because the man relaxed somewhat and gave John a lopsided grin. Still half-squatting on the armchair, he nodded towards the suitcase.
He should’ve known better than to stroll out like he always does, it was freezing. Luckily, being the graceful little shit that he was, he managed to only break one wrist instead of his whole skull. John had to guiltily admit that when he heard the horrifyingly loud crack, his first thought was of the awful boredom sulks. Oh god, the detective was going to be so bored.
“John,” he just said, stopping in front of the doctor’s armchair and pulling an envelope from the pocket of his dressing gown. John took it, and read the card quickly. “’John Watson appreciation blog post’?” he raised his eyebrows, looking at Sherlock.
Sherlock had apparently refused to take a case yesterday just so that John could come with him today, even though it must’ve been an interesting one. John grinned even wider, wondering how no one else could see how precious the man was.
One of his friends got splinters on his abdomen and died during the surgery. John had spent over an hour trying to remove all of them, and the man’s Words ("You really just said that?") were the only thing John could remember clearly. They had been the first thing he remembered when he had woken up from a nightmare the next night.
Aziraphale was making little sounds, trying not to moan aloud. The expression on his face went from the usual initial embarrassment to pure bliss when Crowley started pulling the waistband lower, and he actually shifted his hips a little to help the demon wiggle the trousers and underwear low enough to allow access to his groin.
Sherlock was laying on his back, other hand sneaking underneath John’s shirt while the injured one was stretched above his head, hanging half off the sofa so that it wouldn’t get on the way.
"Don't worry, we’ve got all sorts around here. Mrs. Turner next door, she's got married ones." Oh, Sherlock was going to
They didn't really talk about what happened again, and truthfully the whole situation kept bothering John. Especially when, after a week or so, Sherlock had a nightmare.
Not to seem desperate, John fought the urge to head to Baker Street for hours. When the clock turned eleven, he decided it would be acceptable to pack most of his things in a bag which he left by the door. He didn't dare take it with him just yet but it would be easy to come and get it when needed. If needed. He then stared at the duffel bag for almost half an hour before making another kettle of tea and resuming his staring contest with the bag as if it held all the answers to his problems.
“Yeah, oh indeed. You do sound very nice when you’re getting a massage.” John climbed off Sherlock and slid up again to sit with his back on the headboard, his pyjamas embarrassingly revealing his current state.
“Oh? Well, they look quite nice, don’t they?” John smiled, wrapping an arm around Sherlock and leaning into him.
So he really had spent some time thinking about his Christmas present to Sherlock and now he had one idea. But they would have a proper first Christmas together, with or without gifts.
"Noo, it was just two bottles. Glad they didn't try to give us a cheaper brand, I would've noticed." Sherlock was almost lisping by now and John was feeling the alcohol in his own blood too. He laughed and hugged Sherlock closer.
It was crowded and impossibly noisy and something hit Sherlock on the back. He was barely able to register that it was someone’s shoulder before almost falling to the floor of the coffee shop he was in. The brunette was quick to gain his footing again, but not before someone managed to grab his arm to help him. The man had stood up suddenly, phone in hand, and bumped onto Sherlock in an awkward angle, hence his embarrassing stumbling.
After he dealing with his hard-on, John just spent a moment thinking about last night. Sherlock had been very enthusiastic, but that was probably the alcohol talking. He had been getting bolder though, and John just hoped Sherlock wasn't trying too hard again.
“Definitely. You’re good enough for a small part, there’s no doubt about that, and it’d be good practice for the bigger roles. Everyone starts somewhere, you know that,” he said, smiling widely at Sherlock.
At first the dancer had changed into his ballet attire at home, pulled on his trousers and shirt before leaving and then waiting until they got home to shower. But he seemed to get comfortable with the studio after a few weeks and started to change and shower there, claiming that it was nicer than walking home sweaty after all.
"I think that's for the best." Oh, at least Sherlock wasn't mad at him. John had no idea why he was so afraid of upsetting Sherlock, especially when the brunette seemed to have no similar worries. Luckily, eating made John feel calmer and more confident and there was something really interesting going on.
Sherlock raised his head to give John a lopsided but radiant smile. “I recon they are quite lovely.” John had actually done that. Tiny hearts. He had taken such care with each one.
He finally opened the list during his first break at work, realising the list had at least two hundred things on it. He only managed to read the first twenty or so during his break, completely overwhelmed by the gesture.
John nodded gratefully, sipping on the coffee. “Wow, this is some sort of Christmas coffee too, isn’t it?” he asked, glancing at the chalkboard above the counter. “Cardamom, clove, orange and vanilla,” Sherlock reiterated, nodding. “I thought it would be appropriate.”
John had read about the suicides from the papers of course, but realising that there were real policemen and a real suicide that was actually a
The doctor took another look around. He suddenly felt quite lonely and he really had no idea what to do. Lestrade was going to go back to the body with the team, but then remembered John. "So who are you? His friend?" The DI turned to face John, looking dubious.
(There'll be a third chapter with almost-smut, because I can't write a decent Christmas fic apparently.)
Sherlock huffed a dramatic breath and put his tea down. “It’s my hard drive, I only put things in there that are useful so I can find them later.”
“I didn’t know, I saw. You are clearly a man with a military background, it’s in your posture and haircut. And you’re a doctor because of the smell of disinfectant that’s oozing off of your clothes. You still use it even though you only work part-time. You have quite fast reflexes, and you immediately checked me for possible injuries, probably subconsciously.”
Even as he paid the cabbie he was half ready to turn back, but somehow he managed to walk to the door of 221 and knock.
“You’ll see it later, I thought you wanted to sleep now,” Sherlock smiled and laid down, pulling John with him too and cuddling to his side. John looked at him suspiciously, but complied and snuggled close to him, falling into a doze after a while even though he kept wondering what Sherlock could’ve possibly come up with.
The dancer just nodded and started to roll over. “’M fine, just, watching you… like that. Too much input, could’ve gotten distracted ‘s all,” he mumbled, the blush painting his cheek now appearing on his neck.
"Mrs. Hudson!" Sherlock called out as they stomped down the stairs. "John will take the bedroom upstairs, please go dust it. You can change the sheets too; I have spare ones on my closet. Take those for now." The landlady was already in the hallway wiping her hands on a towel and just spared a fondly tolerant smile at the brunette. "Just this once dear, I'm not your housekeeper. You're lucky that John here seems so nice."
Oh, this wasn’t his day. Lestrade was being even more idiot than usual, he had had to actually talk to
A while later, most socks had found their pairs and all the shirts were hung up of folded neatly. They carried their sock haul to the chest of drawers, Sherlock tucking each sock pair neatly in his drawer while John just tossed them in his.
But when they were headed to bed, Sherlock noticed that John took a few more minutes in the loo than usual. John had brushed his teeth already and Sherlock couldn't hear the water running anymore, and when John finally emerged Sherlock could see how he slid his phone in his robe pocket before draping the robe over a chair. He pulled the edge of the duvet in a silent invitation and John slipped under the covers next to him, pulling him closer and nuzzling his neck before falling sleep.
“Looks very professional to me,” he nodded, trying to sound smart, and smiled at Sherlock. “And the colour will fit you perfectly, it’ll look very nice on you.”
“But Greg asked for a day off as well for Tuesday, and you know I’ll be at the show,” Molly twisted her hands as he looked at John pleadingly. It was her day off work, but she sometimes liked to come by for a cup of coffee and a chat.
John looked up and grinned at the mistletoe above him, looking back at Sherlock and pulling him close. “Oh, just come here and kiss me,” he grinned, sealing their lips together. A small noise escaped Sherlock’s mouth as he kissed back softly.
John smiled and kissed his forehead before resting his chin on top his curly head. “I love you a lot too,” he said, stroking his back.
"We're going to go get your bag, obviously. Don't really know why you didn't bring it with you." He opened the door, and John realised he hadn't actually taken off his jacket yet. No need apparently.
Sherlock blushed a bit and huffed, stepping closer to kiss John’s cheek. “I’ll be in the dressing room,” he mumbled with a grin before walking off. John grinned to himself before remembering the fabrics and rushing off.
On the plate was a pile of extremely tiny gingerbread hearts, only slightly larger than Sherlock’s thumb print. Somehow, they had managed to maintain their shape even in the oven, but Sherlock could see they were a little different from each other, unique. John giggled a bit. “I cut them freehandedly, took me ages. Now take the tray, will you. There’s a new batch coming and they’ll burn in seconds if I’m late.”
"An expret- exeprim- experiment." Sherlock frowned at his pronunciation mishap and John almost fell over, laughing loudly. “Time for bed, Sherrrlock.”
John watched him go, looking only proud and smitten even as the costume jiggled and bounced with every step Sherlock took. He was proud, of course he was very proud of him.
"Well you seemed quite interested in coming with me before. Or you can stay here, surely Mrs. Hudson would love a nice chat and crap telly."
John had forced Sherlock to spend the rest of the day home, and the pair had cuddled on the sofa and watched crap telly.
“Doctors always have awful handwriting and you are trying to learn to use your brother’s – who is a drinker I’d say – old phone you only just got,” he said, nodding towards the table next to them where the man had placed his phone before stripping. Seeing the blonde’s shocked face made him shut up before he could really scare the man off completely, if he hadn’t already done that.
John moaned a little and reversed their position, Sherlock against the mattress while John sat on his abdomen, pinning his wrists next to his head. “Yeah? Ride you?”
"I want to help. You know how agile I am with two hands, I'm not that much worse with only one." John sighed but took the container from Sherlock. "Okay then, but you have to be careful." The brunet nodded and glanced at the arrange of spices on the table. "Let's get started then, I'll measure the ingredients."
"I mean... like hobbies, interests, friends... Girlfriends, boyfriends, what people usually have." Sherlock's face moved back to the almost bored look. "Oh. Hobbies are dull."
He could always tell the difference between summer rain drop and other drops, he could smell the moment spring died and summer was born. Only then he would greet the world with a wide grin and run out for the first time in months.
“Sherlock, you need to eat, before it goes cold. You can do that mind thing later.” Sherlock sat up and turned to scowl at John.
John woke up next morning as his phone started ringing. Sherlock just let out an unhappy sound and rolled over, so John escaped to the hallway to take the call. When he noticed it was Mrs Hudson, he frowned and answered. “John Watson.”
After a while he nipped at John's lower lip for the final time before pushing the doctor upwards, immediately tugging at his t-shirt again. John got the hint and pulled the garment off and tossing it to the floor.
"Yeah," Sherlock whispered against John's lips. As John started to tug at the string, Sherlock had to add: "Just the pajamas though, if that's fine."
He couldn't help chuckling a bit at the excited look on Sherlock's face. The man was clearly itching to get to talk about the case. "Serial killers are always difficult, had to wait for them to make a mistake. And now we have one."
The two men spent the cab ride to the crime scene in silence. John watched the changing scenery through the window, and Sherlock kept stealing glances of the man. He would definitely have a moment to sort out his feelings towards this whole thing. But right now, all he could think of was the case. He'd been following the situation closely and now he finally had a chance to get into it, so he would make the most of it.
“Oh, that could be nice,” John nodded, smiling back and then looking at the dogs. “So, you’ve come here before?”
"Hang on, I'm still working on the number," John had to chuckle. Sherlock seemed a bit impatient as he jumped off the sofa and paced the living room.
make fun of your interests. I really appreciate that you’d show me all this, that you trust me with this.”
He was steeling himself and about to turn away and climb the steps to the third damn floor, when John laid his hand on Sherlock’s arm. “Would you like me to… I could -”
Starting on the turkey, John spent a fair amount of time trying to figure out how to season it. He tried researching a bit but every site he found had different suggestions and John ended up knocking on Mrs. Hudson's flat, hoping she wouldn't be too bothered.
Just like last time when they got home, John had to practically haul Sherlock into the bathroom, so he could take a shower while John made them something to eat before bed. Sherlock had been practically bouncing with adrenaline-fueled energy the whole bus ride, but he deflated as soon as they got home, complaining that he was way too tired to do anything anymore.
Quizzing turned into a tickling match which then turned into snogging. Sherlock still tried to ask about chemical reactions in between kisses, and John giggled and answered every single one wrong until Sherlock gave up. In the end, they cuddled up on the sofa and watched the telly until John yawned and suggested they went to bed, where Sherlock still ran his tongue over John’s ear and neck, tickling him until they both fell asleep.
They drank the wine and chatted about nothing in particular, occasionally taking each other’s hand or reaching over the corner of the table to press a kiss on the other’s lips. John was glad and a little smug when he realised Sherlock had set the table so that they were almost next to each other instead of sitting at the opposite ends, making kissing much easier.
John swept through the things quickly, having no idea what Sherlock was after. "Uh, no? Who did I just text? The murdered lady?"
"Ugh, I'm sore everywhere," John groaned the next day as he walked to the living room with a hot cup of coffee. "We should exercise more often, the running alone isn't clearly doing the trick," he muttered, nearly flopping down to his chair. He’d woken up with a sore bum, but by no, the stiffness had reached his upper back and thighs as well, making him look frankly ridiculous as he was mostly waddling around.
John sighed but shook his head again, tying off his apron. “I’m sure Greg doesn’t need it as much as I do,” he muttered. “You know I’ll be helping with the props, and you know as a dancer how much it would mean to Sherlock as well that I’ll be there. Besides, I let you know about it before Greg did, didn’t i?”
The main thing now was John. He seemed simple and ordinary but as it turned out, he had a completely different side to him too. A dangerous side, though Sherlock couldn’t feel anything but intrigued by him.
“That’s a yes then?” he asked, crouching down too to pet the puppy, who greeted him with wet kisses too.
The last show was on Friday, and John managed to sneak presentable clothes and a floral bouquet to the hall in his backpack. After making sure Sherlock was gone to get his stage make-up done, John changed into the black khakis and a button-up, trying to smooth down the creases on his shirt before grabbing the flowers and rushing to get a seat at the front row.
"How much?" They had agreed they'd always set the limits first. Sherlock looked up and considered for a second.
"The blue one... ha, here!" He announced triumphantly, holding up a lonely blue sock. "Now where's the pair..." He rummaged the drawer, frowning deeply. "What. I just had it in here!" He groaned, throwing his hands up before moving to look through the shirts. "Where on earth did I manage to lose it?"
Sherlock chuckled, starting to put his skates on. John followed suit, and soon they both had laced up their skates. Sherlock grinned and gave John a pair of warm, knitted gloves, a knitted beanie and a helmet. John scowled at the helmet, but pulled it on as Sherlock showed that he had one too.
The mistletoes were probably John's favourite thing so far. He liked the way Sherlock would get up from the sofa suddenly when John was about to walk under the doorway. The detective would practically run towards the kitchen so that he'd "happen" to walk under the mistletoe at the same time as John and that way get to kiss him shyly (and a few times not-so-shyly) multiple times during the day.
"It was broccoli not gai lan, John. The menu was lying." Sherlock hiccupped and reached for John. They were currently walking home from a Chinese place they were trying out.
“To get aroused. And I might even want to watch you get off,” he added with a smirk. John immediately felt how his blood shifted place. “You would? Isn’t that… I don’t know, selfish?”
It was almost fun to watch Sherlock realise he had been so obvious with his pain that John had noticed. He immediately stretched his legs and gave a seemingly nonchalant do-what-you-want-I-don’t-care hum. John just smiled and went to the kitchen to get some water. He paused to take a look at the damage done to his dinner plans and decided to pop into the store just in case he could still find something. As he gave Sherlock the glass and the pill, he told the detective to not to try anything. Not that the cast would allow him much – he couldn’t even move his fingers – but John wouldn’t put it past Sherlock to find a way to make it worse if the mood stuck him.
John smiled through Sherlock’s fumbling speech, holding his hands gently and then leaning in to kiss his cheek. “You mean you want to keep bees when we retire?”
"He's always like that. Do you need me to text him?" Lestrade was watching him from the top of the stairs, which made John rather uneasy. He could feel his leg throbbing with the familiar pain. He'd been leaving the cane home for a few weeks now, ignoring the pain, but now he would've needed it.
When he finally couldn't take it anymore, John dumped his mug in the sink and pulled on his coat with a peeved sigh. He was so nervous even his hand had completely stopped shaking for a while. Hopefully things worked out because John really wasn't very fond of feeling so uncertain all the time.
The detective was far gone, and when John reached up to suck a small bruise to his throat, Sherlock shouted out breathlessly and rubbed his groin against John's belly briefly before pulling back a bit to look at John.
One helping turned into two, and John insisted he try the Christmas pudding and the fruit cake as well, so now the detective was sinking into the sofa like an overstuffed sack of potatoes while John put away the food and baked the gingerbreads. He was almost sleeping when John came back with a plate. “Here Sherlock, try these.”
When they deemed the bird warm enough, John got a dish for it and then piled everything there, hoping the broth would seep into the meat like Mrs. Hudson had said. He added salt on top of everything, just in case. He didn’t dare make either of them take a taste, saving the possible disappointment for later.
Past caring, Sherlock was just about to turn and continue his venture towards the door when the man finally managed to speak.
"How... Oh never mind." John slumped down on one of the armchairs, balancing the cane on his leg, and took a look around again. It was strange how familiar the place felt already. He reached to pick up the Union Jack pillow he actually could remember seeing the previous time from the floor and plucked it behind his back. "So why did you run off yesterday? It seemed to be important."
As soon as the cab stopped, John handed the money and followed Sherlock inside and up the stairs into their flat. As soon as the door clicked shut behind them, Sherlock was pressing John against it and kissing him heatedly. John hummed and hooked one leg around Sherlock’s hips, pushing their groins against each other.
Soon he found himself laying on the couch, shirt off and pants pulled to his thighs, Sherlock's head bobbing up and down on his prick, and the detective thrusting two fingers in and out of him.
"I'm sorry, that wasn't exactly how-" He was cut off by Sherlock's hips pressing upwards, Sherlock's hardness making itself known. John's breath left him in an involuntary gasp and he ducked in to kiss at the brunet's neck vigorously.
John actually giggled and shook his head. "Of course you'd recognise it. Now if you'd like, I would love to practice my deepthroating. You were quite inspiring again," he suggested with a wink.
“That’s because you don’t know much at all about ballet nor all the nuances associated with it.” John giggled, kissing the top of his head. “Most people don’t, you know that. It was great, and you’ll have two more chances to perfect everything.”
Okay so yeah. It's been almost half a year and this chapter is quite short (managed to cross the 10,000 word count though, yay) but I'm working on a new one (along with my other fics) so one so let's hope it'll take a bit less time.
“Oh, god…” Sherlock moaned as John sunk down, trying to keep his hips still for now, letting John choose the pace. As John started to move, Sherlock’s hands came to rest on his thighs, feeling them flex as John lifted himself up. Not soon after Sherlock started thrusting too, both reached their climax and John leaned down to kiss Sherlock to muffle his moans.
Sherlock basically peeled John from his clothes, pushed him onto the bed and got on top of him, running his hands all over John’s torso and arms. He only had to brush his thumbs over John’s lower stomach to get him to harden, smirking to himself as he fixed his gaze on John’s groin.
Ever the steady doctor, John just calmly closed the front door after himself and went to hail the cab they were going to take anyways. Of course, instead of the murder scene they were heading to the hospital. John expected Sherlock to argue and say he was fine enough to solve the case, but the detective merely muttered unhappily. That alone told John how much the wrist had to hurt. The fact that by the end of the cab ride Sherlock’s talking had been reduced to mere grunts, cradling the damaged wrist protectively on his chest, was a dead giveaway that the detective was in pain.
Next thing John knew was that the able was occupied by a warm plateful of pizza and the fussing aura of Angelo. Honestly, the loud Italian seemed to fill the space and air for a while with his questions and wines and pizza and before he knew it, John had a glass of white wine in front of him.
"We can talk about it tomorrow. We don't really even have to give each other any presents, just having you is enough."
They did catch the murderer the next morning when her supposed next victim called the police. Apparently the victim had grown suspicious about her brother's wife after the brother's two clients got killed and called the cops after the wife turned up at her door.
"I want to touch you. And I want you to touch me." Sherlock sounded out of breath and his cheeks turned pink when he answered, but his gaze was steady. "I want this so badly. I want you."
Sherlock took a deep breath, lowering his leg from the barre and turning around so that he was facing John. Neither said a word as they met in the middle, running hands over each other’s shoulders as they kissed.
Sherlock moaned and moved his hand underneath John's shirt, almost scratching the skin with his fingers. John sucked on the skin gently and pulled back again, panting heavily.
"No, don't worry. This is today's surprise. Or well, the thing we're going to be doing today," Sherlock said cheerfully, peeking into the bag without letting John see. He seemed to be satisfied with whatever he found there, because he left the sack there and stood up, heading to the kitchen to tend to his microscope and whatever he was researching with it.
Sure, as John looked at his phone, there was a notification about a new contact. It must be a feature that John didn’t know about. Of course Sherlock would be showing off like that. He saved the number and tapped ‘call’. As Sherlock’s phone started to ring, the brunette took a quick glance at it and smiled. John let it ring out for a second more before pressing red and tucking his phone back into his pocket. He smiled at the thought of Sherlock saving his phone number. A feeling of something more solid, more permanent.
“It was from a hand gun, they told me," John stated. "Mrs. Hudson was more worried about the rug and you were all over the place so I was the one to give a statement. Not that I could help much, I don’t know a bloody thing about this whole thing. You disappeared and when I got back the whole place was covered in tape. Then I saw Mrs. Hudson...”
. Sherlock gave John a slightly desperate-looking face and John just shrugged back. Then he went to the kitchen to check on the turkey which was indeed ready. Sherlock helped to clear off some space on the table for John to cut it and to scoop the rest of it in a separate dish.
John laughed and without further thinking got up to carefully straddle Sherlock’s waist. He marveled again how comfortable it was for him to be with Sherlock, how easily intimacy just happened between them. He had never gotten anywhere with other guys before, too awkward to even try really. There hadn’t been any barriers with Sherlock, despite the fact that Sherlock lacked sexual drive most of the time. He did love to cuddle though, and that worked better than fine with John.
“John?” Sherlock called his name tentatively, coming to the living room with a piece of clothing clutched against his chest. John frowned at him and lowered his textbook.
They spread elaborate tablecloths onto the coffee table and the desk (after clearing it from all the clutter), and the desk also got a festive table piece with candles in the middle of it. Sherlock got the honours of hanging the fairy lights around the mirror that was hanging over the fireplace, while John hung up the festive red curtains with tiny stars on them to the windows. “I didn’t even know we had these,” he noted, rather liking the sight of them.
“Well, I intend to celebrate, but it’ll happen at home,” Sherlock said in a low tone, making John’s heart beat a little faster for a moment. “Oh, I see,” he grinned, licking his lips. “We better get home quickly, then?”
“Oh, don’t thank me dear, I’d gotten a bigger role for him if they hadn’t all been filled ages ago. But I’ve got to dash, tell him I said hi.”
Sherlock threw a dramatic arm over his face with a grimace. “Apparently I have never really danced ballet. I’m sore
Pulling back for a second, John got lube and condoms before getting rid of both their pants. As John prepared himself, Sherlock watched him heatedly and stroked his thighs, his pupils blown wide. Soon, John rolled the condom on Sherlock, kissing him softly as he added lube. "You were so brilliant on that stage," he mumbled, sucking a small mark on Sherlock's jaw. "So graceful and brilliant."
"But John. You wanted to talk. Presents." The brunette was clearly drunk, waving his hand in in the air dismissively, but he had his gaze fixed on John. John reached for his glass of wine. Sherlock must've thought it was something important if he bothered to remember that.
After they broke the kiss, Sherlock pulled the chair John had used and hung the tinsel and the mistletoe on the doorway leading to the kitchen. When he was done, he stepped down and was immediately pulled under the decorations by John.
2) I thought it'd be nice to add the pics here, I've done quite a lot of visual research for this fic and I wanted to share some of it :) so there is a pic of the wine glass I imagined to the candlelight dinner, and the hedgehog cookies of course
Sherlock took his while to enjoy the lovely crooked smile John gave him and then relaxed against John once again, stroking his back and hair, feeling immensely happy.
John nodded and kissed him, letting go of Sherlock’s wrists so that he could run his hands up and down his chest, pausing at his nipples to tease them for a moment. Sherlock made a sound, sucking on John’s lower lip a little. “C’mon John, please.”
Sherlock chuckled too and put on some Christmas music before sitting down on the floor as well. "Well, why not? I promised to surprise you every day, and since you're so surprised when I'm helpful..." Sherlock shrugged with a big grin on his face.
"You shouldn't have gone through any trouble for us." John was feeling both grateful and a little bit coddled. "Not that I'm not grateful, but I'd still like to do the turkey myself, I just couldn't find any helpful tips."
John gave a sigh, almost protesting again but instead he gave in and got dressed. Sherlock smiled happily, picking up the two pairs of slippers and heading back to the hallway. “Excellent, now let’s go.”
Sherlock spent the next few days working himself to a frenzy over the fact that someone else was going to see him dance. John was one thing, he would be impressed by mere pliés – not that he knew what those were, or anything else about ballet.
Sherlock moaned, rolling his hips, and the finger slipped inside. John took his time preparing him, adding a second and a third digit with loads of stretching in between. By the time he’d taken the third finger, Sherlock was a gasping, moaning mess, practically rubbing himself off against John’s stomach.
The detective opened his mouth and released a small breath, but the thought we had been about to voice escaped him and he just continued to blink like an idiot. Somehow he felt like he should try to impress this man, but on the other hand he was terribly afraid of driving him away. And the feeling itself was something he wasn't sure he wanted to have. But this man, this particular man, doctor John Watson, was his soulmate. It had to mean something.
John smiled fondly and rolled to his side, watching the dancer. "Sherlock, I'm sure you'd be an amazing dancing candy."
The driver! He was shot here, wasn’t he? Sherlock managed to free himself from the infuriating sheet and bolted up. And swayed dramatically.
John laughed and giggled and then pulled Sherlock into a kiss, cupping the detective’s cheeks with his mitten-clad hands. Sherlock kissed back and then they skated some more before they got cocoa and headed back home, both smiling happily with their red noses and blushed cheeks.
Suddenly Sherlock was hugging him from the behind, resting his chin on John’s head. “You survived just fine, it’s not that…” he mumbled quietly.
Something for just the two of them. He knew from the past that Sherlock didn't really care for Christmas, but he had also realised the man would sometimes pretend not to care to avoid rejection. After they got together, John had thought Sherlock wouldn't need to do that anymore, but then July happened.
“Of course I can come, I’ve still got almost a week to study. Will something special happen tomorrow?”
“Good shot.” John halted his monologue and stared at Sherlock. Then his eyes flickered to the window. “Yeah, must’ve been. Right from across the street there-”
“Finally, that must be it,” John spoke at the same time, lifting his eyes to Sherlock. “Oh, sorry. What is it?”
There, right on top, was a lonely blue sock, exactly like the one on top of the drawer. John slowly paired them up and then looked at Sherlock who was laying on the bed already, looking expectantly at him.
"I need to set everything up first, you can finish your coffee and then take a quick shower," Sherlock said, getting up. "Oh, and if you liked the ice-skating, I've sort of planned to repeat it next week. Just letting you know if you'd rather have a completely new surprise every day," he added, sounding just a tiny bit nervous.
When he’d taken care of his part, John found his way to the dressing rooms. As he was weaving his way through the other dancers making their way out of the dressing room, John realised he could very well get used to this, the buzzing and rustling of the costumes. Stepping inside, he found Sherlock in the dressing room, already in his usual clothes and his bag ready.
Sherlock wanted to hug someone. Finally, something real to do! He had been running around, trying to get clues from his homeless network, but even the homeless people seemed to miss the serial killer now working in London.
John had woken up with no Sherlock on the bed, but as soon as he’d reached the bathroom to brush his teeth, the detective had rushed in and announced there was a case. So, John had ditched the thoughts about a warm shower and headed right to the kitchen to make a quick breakfast.
“You do that. Thank you, for the help with the props,” Mrs Hudson smiled, shaking his head. “I’m getting too old to take care of this all by myself.”
“What’s this?” John asked, confused when Sherlock gave him a piece of clothing that seemed to be… “Are these tights?”
The rest of the journey was spent in silence. As was the visit to John's. And the cab ride back. John was getting restless despite the fact that he usually enjoyed having a bit of peace and the silence the men shared was still comfortable. But he didn't still know the man, so John couldn't help feeling unsure. He tried to catch the brunette's eyes on the way back to Baker Street but Sherlock kept staring straight ahead, his hands under his chin again.
“I didn’t use anything suspicious, the bathbomb makes the foam go orange,” Sherlock said, motioning for John to strip. John did just that, smirking at Sherlock. “You use bathbombs?” he teased, quickly getting rid of his clothes.
?” John read out, chuckling and looking at Sherlock with a grin. “This is great, but how do you plan on getting to ‘cheerful’?”
When Sherlock decided they had done enough, John was sweating and shaking out his tired legs. “Okay, that’s actually difficult,” he admitted, even smiling a bit.
, a voice said in his head. He looked at the man again. It was true, he knew nothing about the man. But he definitely wanted to find out, and the brunette had invited him to see a flat. Suddenly living with Sherlock didn’t so sound bad at all.
"Yeah, sure you would've. And it was three. Three bottles." They kept walking in silence for a while until Sherlock scoffed.
“Boys! Clear up a table, would you dears.” She appeared at the door, carrying a large tray. “I heard you preparing the turkey, and it’s probably ready soon so you’ll have time to set the table for your dinner.”
I didn't mean this to be a multi-chapter story but something happened, hopefully something vaguely good...
John giggled a bit and sat up properly. “Alright, so what’s today’s surprise?” he asked, smiling at Sherlock, who bit his lip a little.
“Mrs. Hudson agreed to give us a discount, for now at least, she’d really like to see who you are… But I did, um, I asked Molly if I could get more hours at the café, and since Greg’s been busy lately she said it would work out well, I can work some of his shifts. And I’m almost finished with my studies, so I’ll get proper shifts at the clinic too soon.”
John had to smirk at Sherlock’s concern. “I’ll be fine, plus I’ll get some savings too so it’s not all for just you.” The brunet shook his head while still watching John. “You keep amazing me, John, you really do. Just let me know if you get tired, please,” he added with firmness that John didn’t dare to dismiss.
"I told you," he said firmly, pushing Sherlock back towards the carpet, "keep deducing. The client will be back soon and you'll want to finish before that."
“Alright, alright,” John chuckled, kissing back and pulling his fingers free, wiping them on his shirt as he pulled it off. Then Sherlock stripped him from his pyjama bottoms and boxers before straddling his hips again. “Now hurry up,” he pleaded.
They both enjoyed the dinner, but especially John appreciated the thought since the food was delicious and the candlelight made everything a thousand times more romantic.
"Well put it on, we're going out. Come on." As John got up, rather slowly due to his confusion, Sherlock's gaze dropped to John's feet, scowling. He was already at the top of the stairs. "Where are your shoes? This is inconvenient, now hurry up. If murders make you this slow, we must rethink this arrangement." It was delivered with a little smirk and John's worry dissipated.
Just as he turned the key of 221, Sherlock's brain suddenly came online and he realised where he was.
This seemed to catch Sherlock slightly by surprise. The brunette raised his eyebrows and then frowned somewhat, his nose crinkling in a way John noticed he really liked.
"I can't, my socks need indexing," Sherlock replied, kissing John's neck once more before pulling back. They tidied themselves up and then attacked the basket full of dry, freshly cleaned laundry. "I can't believe I've lost three white socks again!" John groaned, tossing a now-pairless sock back into the basket. Sherlock hummed, busy with his own pile of socks.
Sherlock started fidgeting, now playing with John's fingers with his hand. "We had one, last year. It was the best Christmas I've had and... this year I forgot." He swallowed heavily. John finally got a grasp of the problem.
“Wow, this really looks great,” John sighed, looking at Sherlock, who nodded. “I’m glad you liked it,” he muttered, taking a few steps closer. The detective’s eyes flicked from John’s face to something above the doctor’s head and then back as Sherlock came even closer.
When he reached the police tape, the Donovan woman was by his side. "So who are you? Did the freak follow you home?"
So, one day John put a blindfold over Sherlock's eyes and sat him at the kitchen table. He had bought at least a dozen different vegetables, breads, pastries, spices and even more wine types.
As he settled for sleep, he couldn't help thinking that he would probably be as eager to see Sherlock Holmes again, soulmates or not. The man was no doubt the smartest person John would ever meet and he couldn't wait to know him better and to see how he worked. He couldn't tell if that interest was returned at all and that was a thought that kept him from sleeping almost as effectively as nightmares.
"No, I mean this is where I live, but I was doing something before you tried to knock me down. I have to go back."
John stared at his phone for a good moment before being startled out of his mind by getting his coat thrown at his face. Picking up the garment, he looked at Sherlock who was already wearing his coat and scarf and was standing at the doorway.
“I noticed Sherlock setting up a lab on the table and figured you weren't going to get anything done so I decided to help out a bit,” she explained. John just chuckled.
The next day Sherlock had woken up to find John was already in the shower. Apparently convinced John was leaving him ayways, the detective had been desperately trying to clean the flat with shaking hands as John had got out of the bathroom. The detective had kept on pleading and had promised to clean the whole apartment and rid all of his experiments if John just promised to stay.
"You just masturbated." John felt himself blushing right away. He should be used to how observant the other man was by now. "Umm," he mumbled and headed to the kitchen.
After Sherlock’s so-called audition had gone very well - in John’s opinion at least, and Mrs. Hudson had seemed very happy but Sherlock still seemed to think he hadn’t been perfect, they had agreed that Sherlock would start there (Mrs. Hudson had almost insisted, which made Sherlock blush fiercely) with weekly private lessons. Since the dancer had asked John to come with him already and John had then tagged along again and without prompting, he wasn’t actually surprised when Sherlock made sure his practice wouldn’t coincide with John’s rugby practice. "Just in case," he had said, feigning nonchalance, but John had given him a soft smile at the somehow sweet gesture.
"Sherlock," he started, "I thought we talked about this. I don't want to pressure you into anything, and I most certainly do not want you to pressure yourself. I don't want you doing anything before you're ready."
The doctor decided to go home, he'd visit Sherlock tomorrow. Maybe Sherlock could learn from his "mistake", though John wasn't entirely sure the man worked like that.
"No, I - it's... nothing, nothing happened." John could see Sherlock wasn't hurt, just quite tense and blushing slightly. But nothing major had happened so he decided to drop it. He could get so insecure about making mistakes and it didn’t do any good to probe around, so John decided to let it be, Sherlock would tell him if it was something important.
For a really short second he considered starting dancing too, just so he could make sure Sherlock couldn’t dance duets with anyone else. But the thought of Sherlock trying to pick him up gracefully almost made him giggle aloud. Looking up at the stage again, he could see Sherlock’s knowing gaze across the hall and grinned back.
"Two," he moaned obediently, arching his back and whimpering when John cupped the offended cheek again. "You're doing fine, Sherlock," John chuckled, jiggling the cheeks slightly before spanking him again.
"You should unpack now, might need your help in a bit. There's just the bedroom upstairs, think you can find it just fine." With an almost dismissive wave of his hand, he resumed his work with the suitcase.
John had a nice morning with a good breakfast, a still-clean fridge (yes, he was still happy about it), and his laptop. He had read the news, made a few notes about their latest case and scrolled through a few interesting articles by the time Sherlock came home, carrying a big bag and a suspicious bucket.
John started to descend the stairs, looking at Lestrade over his soulder. "Yeah, well it seems he's not quite the people person, running off like that."
As John started on his pajama bottoms again, Sherlock raked his nails down John's back, harder this time and moaned faintly. The doctor backed off for a moment to pull the pajamas off completely before crawling back to kiss Sherlock.
“Oh, you soppy bee,” John sighed, smiling and kissing him softly. “I might get you something anyways, I’ll always be on your side, so that’s not really a gift.”
John watched as Sherlock opened his belt and jeans. When the detective yanked them down and mouthed at his erection through his pants, John wound his hands into Sherlock's curls and pulled lightly. Sherlock moaned, a tiny noise muffled by John’s pants, and John was nearly rock hard already.
He read the list on his lunch break and on his way home. By the time he reached Baker Street, he had read through every point on the list and was quite eager to kiss Sherlock and tell him a few things that he loved about the man in return.
John nodded and squeezed his hand briefly before turning to one of the dogs that was eagerly begging for John’s attention. “I wouldn’t have thought you to be a dog person, but it makes perfect sense,” he said, smiling up at Sherlock while petting the dog.
, John thought bitterly. Remembering how badly Sherlock’s interests had been received by the world, even his parents, so far was an endless source of angry, adrenaline-filled energy for the blond, and he opened his mouth before he chickened out again.
“The sun’s almost out, it’s not going to rain,” Sherlock chuckled and they started towards the station building again. But before they reached it, Sherlock stopped on his tracks as the first light raindrops hit his nose and looked at John with a funny expression, a sort of awe mixed with confusion. Then the skies opened and they were quickly getting soaked. Sherlock looked as if he was trying to say something.
John hoped he could see the show from the audience, maybe on Friday when they’d dance for the last time. With all the costumes and props and Mrs Hudson’s fussing as she sent dancers out to the stage and greeted those returning from there, it all seemed very official and professional.
But they survived without any bigger bruises, and Sherlock seemed quite happy too, which John thought was quite a big thing. He’d loved rugby – still did even though he didn’t play anymore – so it was satisfying to see that Sherlock could like it too. John wondered if Sherlock felt the same way about John’s respect towards ballet too.
"I'm aware I may have forgotten you at the crime scene yesterday and I realise that might have been a bit... not good." Surprisingly, Sherlock seemed slightly nervous too, or maybe John was just reading his own nerves into Sherlock.
"What's this? Oh, John," Mrs. Hudson creaked the door open. "Come in dear." John shuffled in, noticing that Mrs. Hudson had been cooking something delicious-smelling. "I hope I'm not interrupting, it is a bit late."
Sherlock was just about to consider the fear of accidentally driving John closer when he heard steps on the stairs. He quickly went to the window, and when the door swung open, he turned to face Lestrade.
John was humming to himself when Sherlock wrapped his arms around his waist again, kissing the back of his neck. "John. The program lasts for an hour and thirteen minutes," he announced, and John rolled his eyes fondly at the clear hint. "You're really high maintenance, you know that?" Sherlock just sucked a mark on John's neck as a reply, making John's knees feel a little weak. "Damn, alright. You win," he grinned, turning around and kissing Sherlock deeply.
"Honey, if you don't want me to touch your index, you'll come and help me right now," John called out, peeking his head out of the bathroom.
Sherlock made them some more tea and then they cuddled up on the sofa and continued with Doctor Who until they heard Mrs. Hudson climb up the stairs, already hooting for them.
“No, wait. I don’t have a jumper like that,” John noted, looking at the dark brown jumper with white snowflake patterns on it.
Actually, not many were there for private lessons since Mrs. Hudson was running the place mostly on her own and she didn’t have the time to tutor each dancer privately. John wondered if Sherlock would soon join them in group classes, but he didn’t think it was his place to ask. So, he let Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson figure it out. Sherlock seemed to be advancing pretty quickly after all.
“Well, I think that’s definitely amazing.” Sherlock gave him a smile at that, but turned to face the window again. John wasn’t sure what that meant. Maybe the brunette was just shy? John wished he could tell.
“Maybe later if you’ve got the stamina,” the detective grinned at him and pulled John into his mouth, immediately sucking on him gently. John struggled to keep still and not buck his hips towards Sherlock as the genius worked up and down his shaft.
“So, you think it qualifies as a Christmas calendar surprise?” Sherlock asked, pulling a slightly crumpled envelope from the pocket of his dressing gown. He gave it to John, who pulled out a small card with a huge number 1 on it. The other side said ‘clean, well-stocked fridge’. John had to chuckle, smiling at the card fondly and then lifting his gaze to Sherlock.
And then, finally hearing his Words, even though they were shouted at him in anger, made him feel high in a way he hadn’t been expecting. Of course he had envisioned this moment time and time again but reality still overpowered it all.
"I mean - are you sure? I'm not... I’m not the easiest man to live with, everyone’s said that.” Sherlock gave a small sound, almost like a sob. “I’m broken, I’ll push you away some day.”
Sherlock blinked a few times. No one had said that before, never. He was a freak, rude, always insulting people by saying things like that, not thinking about what was coming out of his mouth as long as it was true. Everyone he knew said he was a psychopath.
Sherlock shook his head, tugging on the duvet while John tightened his hold on the garment. "No, it's your day off. But Jooohn," he complained, pulling John's pillow from under his head.
Without a word, the man stepped aside to let John come in, which the blonde man did with a quick "see you later" at Mrs. Hudson. He entered the living room and turned to face Sherlock. After just looking at each other for far too long to be comfortable, John had to try to say something. Apparently Sherlock got his brilliance working again at the same time too, because John's amazing attempt of "uh, so, umm" got drowned by the brunette's baritone.
They kissed for a good while, just standing there on the kitchen doorway with their hands on each other’s hips. Eventually, Sherlock pulled back and sighed a little, a small smile lighting up his face. “Let’s get the groceries in the fridge, and then maybe you could kiss me again…”
Sherlock scoffed, glancing at him. “John, don’t be ridiculous.” John just giggled and shook his head, lifting his hand as the bus arrived. They got two seats and sat down before Sherlock looked at him.
John took the shopping bags and headed for the kitchen. Luckily, he had taken the time to clean and put the liver away so that he now had a relatively clean fridge with enough room. Then he went back to the living room.
He met Sherlock, whose sulks never respected seasonal changes. John settled down – so to speak – and at last spent his years like a completely ordinary person, somehow managing not to shut down completely when the leaves started to fall.
They were sitting on the sofa, Sherlock’s lithe feet resting on John’s lap. The brunet had arrived home just half an hour ago, having spent the last two hours practicing at the university’s gymnasium which had been the only place where he could practice for free that day. Sometimes he got a few minutes at some local dance studio when a student cancelled but that was rare, and Sherlock kept complaining how he could never get better due to the lack of proper practice.
And Sherlock did. He gave a long, ridiculously erotic moan and went rigid on top of John. After giving him a moment, John turned them both to lay on their sides and watched as Sherlock came down from his high. Finally, he opened his eyes and looked at John.
She still insisted on coming upstairs to see the turkey, and they figured out the perfect mixture of herbs and spices for it. She also gave John tips for the gingerbread dough and also the canned-beans-dish that John wanted to try even though it did sound like a disaster from the beginning. She agreed to lend a few carrots and her leftover blackcurrants for John to experiment with.
John was about to protest, but Sherlock turned around and silenced him. "I know, we've talked about this, you've said you can do without sex, but
“You haven’t even seen the table yet,” Sherlock scoffed, wearing a small satisfied smile. John followed him into the kitchen, stopping on the doorway when he saw the table. Even Sherlock’s microscope had been stored away, and the table was completely empty except for a white tablecloth and a woven Christmas table runner. John noticed that Sherlock had also cleaned the cupboards and the stove and put up a few tiny poinsettia wreaths and more dark green tinsel around the kitchen, making the room look very Christmassy without being too tacky.
"I know it's... fine. I think I should point out now that I consider myself married to my work, so if you –"
Time went by, and two months after his brother's downfall Sherlock took what he decided to be his last shot of cocaine. That was a year and a half ago, and he'd been clean since. It did hurt, being clean, but the look of pity on his brother's face when he'd paid a visit to Sherlock's flat after he’d got out of hospital was something Sherlock never wanted to see again.
. They were watching him. Not the pizza though, that was what he was going to order. And he could dismiss the date thing entirely and see if Sherlock would to the same. Yes, that's a good plan, though John wasn't entirely sure how long it had taken him to come up with it.
"Now, I know you're close, why not come?" He growls and Sherlock's thrown overboard with a moan. He comes, coating the corner of the desk and slumping against John. He feels John's climax inside him, triggered by his muscles clenching as he rides his orgasm.
Sherlock glimpsed around. Nobody seemed to be watching them, like they had somehow entered a secret time and space bubble and no one else could see them, even when this man seemed to be stripping himself right there and then.
John wanted to point out that he still knew absolutely nothing about ballet or the clothes needed in it, but he held his tongue and lifted what he now recognised as one of those one-piece garments which most of the other dancers wore, but he couldn’t recall the name of it. It was dark green and made of something light and silky, and John nodded as he ran his fingers over the material.
“I’ll look at them next time,” John promised, grinning. He got up and walked closer, hugging Sherlock from the behind as he packed his bag. “You’re brilliant, you know that? I don’t know why Mrs Hudson didn’t put more glitter on your costume, you deserve to be noticed up there,” he mumbled, hugging his waist and resting his head against Sherlock’s shoulder.
He had also noticed that Sherlock tried to hold himself back at crime scenes. He hadn't even replied when Donovan had blurted out something extremely nice about him. He had at least defended himself before, and seeing he didn't even return Donovan's or Anderson's insults if that could end up upsetting John only made the doctor feel worse.
“I will definitely come with you every week I can.” John’s voice sounded slightly out of breath due to the massage, and that was probably why Sherlock’s answering “yes” was more like a moan than his usual witty voice. John found a particularly good spot between Sherlock’s shoulder blades and managed to turn that single moan into a longer series of breathy sounds that were almost too much for the blond’s self-control.
As the evening went on, the sky got darker and darker, highlighting the fairy lights hanging basically everywhere, and John had to admit it was pretty damn romantic. They went to the rink for another go after finishing their drinks, Sherlock got to show off the few skating tricks he knew, including an impressive pirouette, while John just circled around slowly and watched him.
John wondered if the detective had done something to earn the insults. Donovan bit first, and Sherlock just seemed to defend himself. The Anderson guy was even worse, but again Sherlock definitely fought back.
“So you managed to find the most Christmassy café in London?” he teased, glancing at Sherlock who gave him an envelope (the card said ‘coffee shop date’) and then pushed a spoon and one of the cups towards John.
But Vern had an intense obsession with trains, and sometime during the vacation John found himself almost intrigued by all the things the older boy knew about Eurostar and London underground. Verner had even brought a few miniature models with him and his ringtone was the sound of some old steam engine.
Suddenly John yanks his weight off the table, pulling him up and holding him up by his shoulders and throat.
“You were much more nervous before the show on Monday than you are today,” John noted, stroking his arms. Sherlock’s nervous mood before the show seemed almost surreal compared to this moment, when they were calmly standing in the momentarily-empty dressing room.
John couldn't help himself and giggled. "It's a week until Christmas. I thought we could have a real Christmas for a change."
Sherlock jerked his gaze up to John. “I’m… They’re very, uh, symmetrical.” John came to sit next to Sherlock, setting the mugs on the table. “I don’t know why I did that, really. Just popped into my head, the idea.”
After they got home, they ate dinner quickly and then Sherlock told John to shower and dress up. John found a garment bag on their bed when he came out of the shower. He frowned and opened it to reveal a dark grey suit and a natural white dress shirt.
Next stop was a place John hadn’t been completely sure they could get into, but he’d written it there in the hopes that it might happen.
"I'll have pizza, please. Just some sort of pizza." Angelo nodded and left with a mild frown and John let out a breath of relief.
Luckily Sherlock just chuckled at him. "No, they don't. I'm a consulting detective, meaning that when the police are out of their depth - which is always - they consult me."
They started with the simplest and quickest breakfast of eggs and toast, which had been a very common type throughout John’s school years. Then they headed to an old school gym to meet up with an amateur rugby team.
The army training base was as busy as he remembered it to be, and he instantly got hit by the nostalgic feeling when he saw a group jog by. They found a soldier who could show them around, and John was surprised to see Sherlock practically soak up all the information available like a dry sponge. He stared at the poor guy and asked questions, stopping at every small detail and fixing his deducing gaze into every passer-by.
"Umm, yeah, that was uh... Not good. I mean," John started to babble awkwardly. "Anyway, I got home alright and had some time to think about... things. Like – "
After that, it didn’t take much time. Massaging Sherlock had already gotten him so close to the edge, and knowing the dancer was lying there, watching him, it all did him in eventually. While John was still panting from his climax, Sherlock got up and headed for the loo. He turned to look at John from the doorway with a cheeky smirk.
He seemed very happy with the studio, and John loved the big grin he always wore at home before the lesson. He seemed to love the professional-looking studio, and he even ended up buying a better pair of ballet slippers after Mrs. Hudson recommended them. John caught him trying them on in the bathroom, grinning widely down at his feet before doing some sort of ballet-posing. John left him at it, smiling to himself.
"Ah, that's the case," Angelo said and rolled up his sleeves. John could only sit and watch in horror as the man grabbed Sherlock by his coat collar, wrenched him up and out of the restaurant, shouting at him.
As the night started to fall, John finally got up and started on the dinner preparations. Sherlock stayed on the sofa, drifting in and out of sleep, still a bit distracted by everything. John brought him a few pieces of toast with a good helping of cold cuts as a very late dinner.
At that, the brunette abruptly stood up on the armchair and unceremoniously jumped on the floor, pacing towards the door.
Sherlock kissed him for a while and then broke the kiss, nodding towards the fridge. “You were about to make breakfast. All this hard work is making me hungry,” he stated, sitting down at the kitchen table, which was still as cluttered as always.
Sherlock noticed John's staring and just shook his head slightly. "She's just worried I'm going to destroy the flat." John took another look around the cluttered living room and smirked.
Sherlock shrugged and straightened up at the words. “I guess I should be happy that I got a role at all, given how late I auditioned,” he mumbled, tugging on the hem of the candy-shirt before lifting his head, nodding to himself and marching towards the stage.
P.S. let me know if I fuck up some ballet-related term or something, I'm really not a professional at all.
John smiled fondly and got on his tiptoes to kiss him, his eyes sliding closed. Sherlock kissed back with enthusiasm, which made John pull him closer still. “Mmm, we’re in the dressing room,” he mumbled when they pulled apart, running his hands up Sherlock’s back and resting them on his shoulders.
Not that John really wanted to care, his mood too good to be ruined right now. It was the end of summer, the hottest part gone but not yet quite autumn. But the threat of cold winds was there, earlier than last year. And he could tell it would start raining soon, any minute now. The aphids were already seeking refuge in the underside of birch leaves.
“Oh my God, Sherlock,” John cried out, one hand burying itself in Sherlock’s curls when he brunet took his tip into his mouth, suckling a little. When Sherlock started bobbing his head, the doctor glanced at the fairy lights hanging over the headboard before focusing his eyes on the curly head again, smiling widely to himself.
After they finished the bottle, Sherlock produced some biscuits and another bottle from somewhere. After a while John felt himself getting drowsy.
And of course there was a catch, there always was. You could die without your soulmate. Naturally, everyone dies in the end but the ones who did find their pair always died peacefully, usually of old age. The "soulmate deaths" were clearly different. Mostly it would be violent or just plain painful. They could be shot or stabbed, or they could commit suicide, have a fatal cancer or whatever. But the wound or tumour was always right where the person's Words were on their body, and no one knew how long they had.
