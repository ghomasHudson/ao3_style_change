“Same here. I am actually killing time before I go out with someone. I’m not really sure what it is, but now that I’m sitting here, it's starting to feel like a date and I don’t know what to do with myself.” Dean released all of that in one big breath, like a sigh of relief that it was finally said.
One moment, Dean was sprawled on his back feeling vulnerable, with Cas towering over him, and then Cas was on him. Everything was lips and teeth and tongue. The kiss was messy and sloppy, but fuck him if it wasn’t the best kiss he’d ever had. Cas tasted of remnants of the pie that they’d shared earlier. Cas was controlling the kiss, hands everywhere, tongue pushing in and out of Dean’s mouth. Cas brought his hands up to Dean’s shoulders, pinning him down, and he pulled off the kiss.
Dean found he really enjoyed having the cat. He liked coming home to unwind and play with him. He liked being able to talk to the cat about his coworkers, or about Sam. At this point, Sam was still the only person, besides Pamela, who knew about Fluffy, but he had never met the little guy. Sam was an animal person, but he still wasn’t extremely fond of cats.
When Cas was done slicking himself up, he grabbed hold of the butt plug, shoving it roughly deeper into Dean and then pulling it all the way out. Cas gripped Dean’s hip and ground his hard length against Dean’s begging hole.
It wasn’t so much that Dean didn’t like cats, it was more that he didn’t trust them. Dean read somewhere that the average housecat is the world’s most vicious predator, and they were the only ones that played with their food before they ate it. They had knives on their paws, and in their mouths. They could be perfectly content one moment and ripping your hand up the next. Dean just didn’t particularly like them, and he wouldn’t even if he weren’t terribly allergic to them. But screw him if Bella hadn’t magically turned him into a freaking animal person, and screw him if he couldn’t just leave this cat to suffer.
Cas made it down to the waistband of Dean’s jeans. He nibbled at the skin just above the jeans while he undid the button and pulled down the zipper. Then, Cas ghosted his hot breath over Dean’s inner thighs and pulled his boots off, throwing them across the room. Dean’s socks came next. And then, before Dean knew what was happening, Cas ripped his pants right off him. Dean was just sitting there in his black boxer-briefs, feeling like a piece of meat as Cas appraised him.
“Hgnn. Cas!” Dean was thrusting back harder now, thoroughly enjoying the treatment Cas was giving him. He was pushing back, wanting friction on his cock, wanting a bigger stretch, wanting something! Cas slammed his forearm on Dean’s lower back, pinning Dean down, as he thrust a second finger in with the other two. Cas was suddenly a very eager participant, in that he was shoving his tongue and fingers in and out of Dean’s hole.
Castiel sighed. “I think so. However, this is a two way street, so if you don’t like it, then I won’t stay in your life.”
“Well, it sounds like a date with a psychopath, but a date nonetheless.” She said, letting out a nervous giggle. “How did you guys meet, anyway?”
“Fuck boy, you’re so good, begging for my dick. You want it, baby? You want me to give it to you?” Cas was smearing precome and lube all over Dean’s hole.
Cas struck the right side, just a little bit harder. “Two,” Dean managed to squeeze out. Cas just kept it up. Every time Dean counted off a lash, Cas took that as a signal to get one with the next one. Every lash was harder than the last. Every lash had Dean suppressing a whine and a groan and clenching his muscles tighter.
When Dean opened the door, he came up short, almost falling over himself. On his doorstep, he found a black ball of fluff, that seemed to be curled up on itself. He leaned down, and saw that it was moving a little, breathing. So Dean placed his palm on the little guy, which promptly woke it up. It was a little balck cat. It lifted its head up and yawned and opened its eyes. The cat had these brilliant, deep blue eyes. Dean had never seen eyes that blue let alone on a cat. It was like staring into the depths of the mariana trench. Dean pet the cat a little, brushing its shoulder. The cat flinched suddenly, and Dean pulled his hand away. The cat stood up, but it held its paw, the left front one that Dean had just touched, close to its body. The paw looked like it had dried blood on it, and it also looked like it was twisted in a weird way.
Both men readied themselves for bed in silence. Dean tucked himself in first, while Cas finished whatever he was doing and shut off the lights and crawled in bed behind Dean, immediately taking the position of the big spoon. Dean fell asleep quickly and easily, excited for what the next day had in store.
Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath, before turning and walking out of Bobby’s office. Goddam, he really didn’t want to go home to an empty house, but he couldn’t very well tell Bobby “no” so he just packed up his stuff. He did it as slowly as he could, even though he knew he was just being childish.
Dean decided to leave the cat stuff for now, since he didn’t know what else to do. He finished cleaning the house, even cleaning the oven, which he hated, but then he had three hours still left. What the hell was he supposed to do now? He sat down and put on more Dr. Sexy, MD because his life basically revolved around that show.
“No Benny. I haven’t had sex or killed anyone, but thanks for asking. No, I just had a good weekend. Is that a crime?” Dean asked, setting his things up for the day.
With the hardest strike yet, Dean cried out and started grinding against the chest. He felt his orgasm fighting to be released, but it was trapped; it was being held in. Dean felt tears falling down his cheeks, but he took note of it absentmindedly, like maybe someone was pouring water on him, but he wasn’t crying.
Then Dean turned on the TV and watched as much “My Cat from Hell” as he could stand. And he learned kind of a lot from that weird Jackson guy that he couldn’t help but like. He started blinking at Fluffy, and it took almost no time at all for Fluffy to start blinking back at him.
When he stepped into the living room, he saw Cas standing next to the couch. Dean walked up to his master, bowing his head and waiting patiently for instructions.
“Okay,” Dean said warily, “but I have a couple of questions.” Castiel just looked at him expectantly, so Dean continued. “Why me? I mean, I’m not a witch.”
In the master bedroom, Dean and Cas had a little table, one that looked like it should be attached to a vanity, where the collar and the rules resided. Dean spent a very long time searching for his collar when they finally decided to get him one. At first, he wanted one made of blue leather that would match Cas’ eyes, but none of the colors were right, and if they were, then they were too lacy and frilly. In the end, he went with a simple, lightweight black collar. It was about an inch and a half tall, and was made of two layers. The outer layer was heavy-duty leather, and it held the clasp, the thick metal d-ring, and a little plaque that said “Property of Castiel Novak.” The inner layer had some soft fabric that would be gentle on his skin. The collar as a whole sat on a little navy blue crushed velvet pillow atop the table. Hanging on the wall above that, was a frame containing the rules written in Cas’ scrawling handwriting, with both of their signatures at the bottom.
“Sir?” Dean finally said, looking at the floor in front of his feet, “I’m done with the chores. Is there anything else I can do for you?”
“Oh,” Cas looked down at the table between them,  “I had been staying with my older brother, Michael, until I found you. But, I’m not sure if I can do that anymore.”
“That is valid,” Mr. Tall-Dark-and-Handsome said. “Let us start from the beginning. My name is Castiel.”
Dean tried to savor his coffee, he really did, but he ended up just chugging the whole thing as quickly as he could. He grinned at Cas when he had emptied his mug, and Cas sent him a placating smile, and moved his finger in a “come here” motion. Dean dropped to his hands and knees, crawling over to where Cas sat. When he reached Cas, he nuzzled into his leg. Cas ran a hand through his hair.
“Hey, Dean? I need you to talk to me baby. What’s your color, love?” Cas asked in his softest voice.
“At first, it was purely convenience. Your house was the closest one, and you took me in. But after a little while of being with you, I felt as though we were kindred spirits; like we were bonded. We familiars are told what to look for when we find a witch that we were meant to be with. All the things I was told to look for, I found in you. That is why I stayed.”
The next morning Dean woke to the strangest sensation. He felt something warm, wet, and rough touching his ear. He shook his head to get rid of the sensation, but it persisted. Finally, Dean opened his eyes, only to find Fluffy curled around his head, licking inside his ear.
“You did so well, pet. You are such a good boy. Now that you’ve been punished, I’m gonna reward you for giving me such a nice surprise. How does that sound?” Cas was smiling, caressing Dean’s body with his gaze.
When Dean was not wearing the collar, he could go into The Box and use whatever he wanted. But when he was wearing the collar, even a glance in The Box’s direction would earn a harsh word from Sir.
“Oh, hush you little baby. I’m helping you!” Dean growled at the cat, suddenly very upset that this little creature, who would surely leave him a sneezing mess for days to come, was being an ungrateful punk. It was also very hard for Dean to understand how such a cute, fuzzy cat could muster such an unimpressed look.
So the bartender called him a cab, and when Dean pulled out his wallet to pay his tab, she took out his driver’s license and wrote down his address. Dean was so busy fumbling with the cash to come up with the right amount, that he didn’t even notice. When the cab came, Dean slumped in the backseat, and the bartender gave the cab driver the slip of paper with his address on it. Dean must have fallen asleep for the drive home, because the next thing he knew the driver was shaking him awake. Dean managed to pull a twenty out of his wallet and shove it at the driver, before practically falling out of the cab. He walked into his house and pulled his boots off, before going up to his room and collapsing into bed.
Dean had just finished folding Cas’ laundry and cleaning the downstairs bathroom. He was heading upstairs to clean the master bathroom, when all of the sudden he found himself being shoved against the kitchen counter. Without a word, his plug was ripped out and replaced with Cas’ cock.
“On your stomach,” Cas said, still looking at the bottle. Dean flipped over on his stomach in a hurry, pillowing his head on his forearms.
“No. Many are, because once a familiar and a witch are committed to each other, then a very profound bond is formed, and this often leads to a sexual relationship, but not all are like that. Every bond is unique.”
“Okay. I’ll come join you in a moment,” Cas smiled tightly and got right back to scribbling away. Dean looked on his husband fondly, and went upstairs to their room. When Dean was in the attached bathroom brushing his teeth, he heard Cas come up and begin to change out of his clothes.
“Really? Are you sure?” Cas looked at Dean from under his long lashes, and Dean wondered how this shy little creature had fucked him into oblivion mere moments ago. Dean gave a half-hearted smirk in Cas’ direction.
“I gotta be honest, man. This is all pretty weird,” Dean said, giving Castiel a skeptical look. Castiel deflated a little bit. “But for some reason, I don’t want to run for the hills. So what’re you thinking? What do we do now?”
“Barkeep!” he yelled in the direction of a cute, short, curvy black woman who was slightly older that was currently talking to another guy at the end of the bar. Hearing yelling from that direction, she walked over to Dean and raised her eyebrows. “Another round if ya please!”
Cas started pistoning his hips faster and harder, and with a shout he came deep inside Dean. Dean clenched down, milking Cas and helping him through the high. Cas left his softening member in Dean for a while. When he eventually pulled out, he watched his cum leak out of Dean for a moment, before he unceremoniously shoved a glass butt plug in Dean’s ass.
“No, this is not about Bella. This cat with a broken leg showed up at my door and I couldn’t just leave him there. So I helped him. You know, until he gets his feet under him again.” Dean walked over to his living room taking a seat, with Fluffy following right at his heels, and then curling up in his lap.
“It ain’t a crime ‘nless you’re bein’ an idjit. You on something, boy?” Bobby walked out of his office and eyed him suspiciously.
When Dean got to the base of the stairs, he was confronted with an empty kitchen; it looked like nothing had been touched this morning except the coffee maker. Usually whoever was up first made breakfast, at the very least for themselves, but Dean didn’t see any evidence of that. He poured himself a cup of coffee and walked to the living room in search of Cas.
In the Novak house, one had to live by several rules. Castiel (or more specifically, his obsessive and anxious nature) demanded order. Anyone who lived under the Novak roof was also subject to these rules. The main ones were as follows:
After a half an hour of still feeling restless, he decided to call Charlie. She picked up on the third ring.
“Honey, I told you the last round was it for you. Don’t you remember that?” She answered with a slight southern drawl.
“You are such a good whore. You were built to be fucked by me; that is your only purpose in life, pet. You are simply a whole for me to use until I tire of you. You are a toy, built to deliver me pleasure and nothing more. You are nothing, but a tool for me to use. You are nothing. And you fucking love it. You are such a cockslut, and I’m the only one who can satisfy you.”
They settled into a casual silence, waiting for the apple pie to come. Both men were leaned across the table, noses inches from one another
“Huuuuung! Cas, fuck!” Dean rose up on his hands and thrusted back onto Cas’ long, fat length. Dean’s entrence burned like he’d been lit on fire, but fuck, Dean loved it. He could feel every smooth, hot length, and he felt almost too full, like he would explode. Cas slammed his hand down on Dean’s shoulders, forcing his face down in the pillows, while Cas’ other hand gripped his hip in a bruising hold. Cas moved his hand to the back of Dean’s neck. Dean could barely breathe, as his nose was crushed against the pillow underneath him, and the wind was knocked out of him with every thrust.
Dean was very thorough in the shower. He also just took his time, trying to relax a little bit. It worked, to some extent, but he was still insanely tense. He got out, took a little longer doing his hair than he normally would. He put on his nice cologne and went to find his best jeans, the ones that hugged his butt just right. Then he found a tight, black henley that he thought made him look hot.
Fluffy gave a little purr from deep in his chest, and then rolled over on his back, swatting at the finger that Dean pointed at him. When they played like this, Fluffy never used the claws that Dean was positive he had. No, Fluffy only used his claws when he was making biscuits and sitting on Dean’s lap, stabbing his thighs. When they were playing, Fluffy would only hit Dean with his little, adorable pink pads and Dean couldn’t help but smile at him.
Dean sat and thought about it for a moment. He didn’t really feel like he could make heads or tails of the situation. He guessed that this man wasn’t going to hurt him, but that was more of a hunch than anything else. Dean decided to look the man over for a second. Castiel was an inch or two shorter than Dean himself, but the guy was built. His torso and pecks were sculpted like some kind of Greek god. His shoulders were broad and his arms were thick. His legs were like tree trunks, and what was between them wasn’t too shabby either. His hair was the same dark brown color as Fluffy’s fur, and it looked like someone had been running their fingers through it.
Already, Cas looked much less tense. His shoulders weren’t making out with his ears anymore, his forehead wasn’t a mess of frown lines anymore. Now that Cas was putting his skills and his anxieties towards something good, something cathartic, it was much less taxing. It was something he could do that was fun, but that also satisfied his need for order.
“Wow. Read for round two already? I might need a couple more minutes before I’m ready.” Cas slapped his ass lightly at that.
So Dean brought the rest of Bella’s food into the store, and came back out with two litter boxes, a huge box of cat litter, cat food, catnip, cat toys, scratching posts, and no scratch spray. Jesus, cats were a lot of work.
“Bed,” Dean barely managed to gasp. Cas released Dean’s neck, and they both sprinted up to the master bedroom.
“That sounds fine pet,” Cas was now in front of Dean. He grabbed Dean’s chin and yanked it up, forcing Dean to meet his eyes. “But that was not what I was talking about. What is this?” Cas roughly pulled Dean’s hard cock, and Dean let out a whine through gritted teeth.
The two men sat in silence for a little while more, lost in their own thoughts. “Dean,” Cas began, his voice quieter than it had been all night.
They walked out to the Impala, and Cas admired her for the first time as a human. Dean appreciated the fact that Cas liked her, and that just gave Cas all the more points in Dean’s book.
Dean went about doing the laundry. He dried or hung up Cas’ things, and started washing his own clothes. While he waited for the loads to finish, he cleaned the bathrooms, starting with the downstairs ones. Mostly, he wanted to occupy himself so that he wouldn’t get hard again, because the more often he was aroused, the more difficult the day would be.
“So anyway, the witch somehow got the boy to come back to her house with her. The witch had decided that Oscar was going to be her companion and she was going to do everything in her power to keep him. The problem with her plan was that Oscar was a human and he had no desire to become a witch. You see, anti-aging spells are mostly used by witches and the spell gets its magic from that of the witch. Obviously that wouldn’t work for Oscar, so the witch had to improvise.
“Sure, if you’d like.” Cas reached across the table and took Dean’s hand in his own. Dean gave a little squeeze in response, and they sat in companionable silence again.
“Move,” was all that Cas said. His master stretched his arms along the back of the couch, while Dean placed his hands on the firm chest in front of him. He started off slow, lifting himself almost all the way off the hard length, and then lowering himself all the way down. He repeated this a couple of times. Dean started bouncing more rapidly, throwing his head back. His thighs were burning and his ass hurt and he could barely contain the tears that were threatening to fall, or the moan that wanted to escape.
His friends started to worry about him. Sam called him and used that special voice that he used when he was concerned about Dean’s mental health, and his safety. Dean just rudely assured him that he was fine, thank you very much. Eventually, people started to get very annoyed with him and his surly mood that just refused to go away. God, everyone experienced loss, why did Dean get to have a harder time than everyone else?
“‘Not a date’ my ass,” she whispered as she turned around. Dean flipped her off, causing Cas to laugh. They ate in silence for a while, never letting go of the other’s hand.
“He’s worried about me. And I mean, I don’t blame him, I would be worried if I was in his spot. But I’m good. I’ve got you -”
With a sigh, both man and cat got out of bed and went downstairs to see about getting some breakfast. Dean put Fluffy down on the counter, and the kitty started hobbling around on the smooth surface. He was watching the fuzzy guy eat for the first time when his phone rang.
When Cas finally pulled his zipper all the way down, he ripped his pants off in one quick, fluid motion, causing Dean to jump slightly. Cas busied himself getting naked, and Dean let himself get an eyeful. If Dean thought Cas’ arms were big, then his legs were something else. Dean could swear that every muscle in the human leg was full and defined on Cas. And his skin, looking so silky smooth stretched over the taut muscle, making Dean’s mouth suddenly water.
“Good morning, love,” Cas responded. “I thought I would let you have your coffee before we started. I almost decided to put your collar on while you were sleeping, but I knew that you would not respond well to any of my commands if you didn’t get some caffeine in you first.” Cas chuckled at that, and Dean tried to smile, but he was too busy trying to get control of his erection to pay much attention to the joke. The thought of going to bed as normal and waking up as Cas’ pet? Good lord, that would be hot. And yeah, Dean probably wouldn’t be a good sub without coffee, but a man could dream.
“Fluffy? Where are you, buddy?” He called in a sing-song voice, as he started to systematically search the house, his anxiety making itself known in the center of his chest. Chances are, everything is fine. Fluffy probably just found a nice patch of sunlight and decided to take a nap. Maybe he’s playing. You’re overreacting, Dean. Snap out of it!
Walking in to the kitchen, he grabbed one of the bottles in the fridge and put it into warmer. While he waited, he lightly hummed as he rocked Dean.
Dean’s body shook listening to every word Meg had said. They were going to make him forget, forget Daddy and Gabriel and maybe even forget himself. They can’t do that, he didn’t want to forget his Daddy. Daddy was the best thing that had ever happened to him. It was only till now he fully realised it, Daddy was kind and loving and gave the best cuddles. Castiel had been more of a father to him in the shortest of time than his real one. Castiel really did love him, and he really loved his Daddy.
“Right. First off Mr Novak, you are the spit of health. I checked your arm and the cuts seem to be healing nicely,” Dean winced at hearing about Daddy’s arm. He was surprised Daddy hadn’t mentioned it before.
Dean stop wiggling. He didn’t like the sound of having something strapped to him and Gabriel sounded like he wasn’t messing around. Seeing Gabriel let go Dean kept the paci in his mouth, but didn’t suck on it.
“Look who’s having a cuddle with his second favourite uncle?” Gabriel said, smirking when Michael glared at him.
Looking up Dean saw his Daddy. When had he come in? Castiel was smiling down at him, leaning his head in his hand against the top of the crib.
“Not to let myself in until someone opens the door,” the girl pouted. “Sorry mama. I was excited to see Uncle Cas,” the young girl looked up at Hannah with puppy dog eyes.
Michael had been bombarding him with contracts and files on the AB program deals with the neighbouring state for the past few days. After reading numerous files on different candidates, Gabriel got half way through them before giving up for the day. He was starting to wish he could just be on holiday with Castiel. As soon as the meeting was over he legged it out of the office as fast as his legs would go, missing the unimpressed look Michael was giving him. He just wanted to be out of there and with his favourite family members.
“Shh…it’s okay baby. These are just to stop the diaper leaking.” Not bothering with a sleeper, Castiel picked his baby up and placed him on his hip.
After taking a minute to realise what had happened Gabriel started to laugh as well, “Well, they do say revenge is sweet,” he said wiping the stickiness off his face.
Checking Dean’s diaper, Gabriel smiled when he found it dry. He really didn’t want to have to deal with a wet diaper too. Walking over to the rocking sofa, he made himself comfortable with a crying Dean on his lap. “Come on baby boy, I think a nap will be good,” he said rubbing his fingers along Dean’s damp cheek. The poor boy looked so tired, he could relate. He was feeling sleepy himself, as he thought about it he got an idea. “You know what Deano? I think I might have a nap with you.” Standing from the rocker, Gabriel picked a pacifier before walking out of the nursery into Castiel’s bedroom.
Dean looked down at the colourful bricks Daddy held in his hand, they did look fun but he wanted to watch his show. He was really enjoying watching this cartoon Daddy had put on.
Dean knew he wasn’t Castiel, but he was hating looking at Michael because he looked so much like the man he was missing, making him want to cry when he thought of his daddy.
Dean watched his Daddy. He knew Hannah was trying to distract him but he wasn’t going to fail for that.
“Uncle Gabe must still be asleep hmm,” He said down to his tired little boy. Crying had really taken the energy out of him.
Sitting quietly for a moment Castiel watched his baby look at him. He wished he knew what Dean was thinking. He was hoping the boy was starting to see that all he wanted to do was love him, but even he knew it was going to take a while for Dean to truly trust him. Castiel knew he had to work on that, but for know his boy looked content in his arms.
Dean lifted his head, he wasn’t sure if he did or not, even though he had bad memories of his dad with this car, he also had good ones, like when they had to go on long trips he would play with his little brother Sammy or if they were driving at night Sammy would lean into him while he slept. Every special moment he remembered in this car was with his little brother, god he missed him.
Dean’s bright green eye’s meet with his, looking confused after hearing Gabriel talk. It was obvious that Dean wasn’t listening. Castiel chuckled, his baby was very cute in his chair with his pacifier bobbing under his nose.
Feeling the blanket being pulled away, Dean felt his limbs fall to his sides. Wiggling around, he found he still couldn’t move fully. The most he could do was lift his head and wriggle his arms and legs. The man must have done something to him.
“Okay I’ll get them. Sammy I’m just going to get your new clothes, Uncle Mick will be in the next room,” leaning over his boy, Gabriel kissed Sam’s forehead. “I won’t be long.”
Dean watched his Daddy and his new Uncle. He could see there was something off between them. He remembered Michael, he was there when Gabriel saved him. When Gabriel gave him back to his Daddy, he remembered Castiel getting mad at the man and blaming him. But it wasn’t Michael’s fault, Gabriel said so. So why are they being weird around each other?
Coming out of his thoughts, Gabriel looked down at the boys in shock when he heard Dean. It was Dean telling Sam off. The boy looked mad towards his little brother, before glancing up toward Gabriel giving him a look like he was saying sorry for Sam.
Seeing a small bit of fear in Meg’s eyes, Michael walked out of the room after his brother. He knew the first thing he was going to do when he got back to work was have a clean out of staff with the AB Program.
“Excellent, I have a few for sale further back,” Crowley said, ushering his arm for the men to follow.
Sighing, Michael took the clothes and headed to the bathroom. Just as he was about to close the door he heard the doorbell. “That’ll be Sam’s clothes.”
Feeling a warm hand on his cheek, Dean dared to open his eyes a little. Looking up he could see a pair of big grey watery eyes looking down at him. They look just like Gabriel’s, holding his hand up, he felt the man’s lips with his fingers. When the lips kissed each finger Dean opened his eyes fully, let out a heartbreaking squeal when he realised that it was really Gabriel in front of him.
How can Daddy say it was okay? John had abandoned his little brother, he had to go get him, he couldn’t leave him. But he couldn’t, his body didn’t work like it use to, he was stuck.
Castiel eye’s widened, “Yeah...the demand for adult babies was getting to high so the government decided to offer people who were going to jail an alternative sentence, to live as an adult baby/child or go to prison. I heard it didn’t work so well.”
“Oh Deany, you don’t need to be sorry. I understand. You want to be big for Sam, but you don’t need to be. He has Gabriel as his new Daddy, also now he’ll have you and me.”
Dean watched as the doctor checked his Daddy’s lungs and heart. Seeing Castiel’s chest, Dean noticed another tattoo across the side of Castiel’s stomach. To Dean it looked like a bunch of wiggly lines, but he could tell it was some kind of language he couldn’t read. In the short time he’s known his Daddy, he didn’t even think that the man was the tattoo type.
“God, the boy weighs nothing Cas,” Gabriel said pushing Dean’s limp body into the car. Pulling Dean in under his arms, Castiel placed the brown haired boy’s head into his lap as Gabriel places his legs in and shuts the door. Dean looked peaceful as he slept. Castiel smiled as he combed his hand though Dean’s greasy hair. Feeling the car start, Castiel didn’t take his eyes off his boy as they drove to Gabriel’s house.
But if Sam wasn’t with John like Daddy said, that means his baby brother was in that hell hole. Alone!
Gabriel grinned into the boy’s skin at hearing Sam call him Dada. It felt so good to hear him say it. Not letting up, Gabriel didn’t stop tickling his baby. “Are you still sure you’re a big boy Sammy?” Gabriel asked, still tickling his belly.
He knew the reputation he had. People saw him as cold, distant and well, a bit of a Scrooge, but he didn’t really care. If people didn’t like him he wasn’t going and cry over it.
“Okay baby let’s get you fed. There is no way you’re eating that gunk.”  Hugging Dean close, Castiel placed one last kiss on the boy’s head. Moving Dean to rest his head in the crock of his arm, Castiel picked up the bottle from the table.
Nodding, Castiel understood, he also wouldn’t mind finding John Winchester and have a not-so-kind word with him.
Castiel watched as his baby stared up at him. He couldn’t figure out why his baby was so fascinated with him, his boy seemed to just like looking at him. It didn’t bother him though, he loved that he had his baby’s attention. Sticking his tongue out, Castiel pulled silly faces making his baby giggle.
“I’m nearly done,” he added when Dean cried as he rubbed the cream in. Letting the cream dry, Castiel pulled out one of the cloth diapers and rubber pants. “Deany, I’m going to put you into a cloth diaper tonight. It’s a bit more bulker then your normal diapers but it’ll be softer on your bum.”
“Didn’t you say you were going to change Dean’s name to Daisy and put him in pretty dresses?” Gabriel smirked, waving the dress in front of Dean.
Dean wriggled under Castiel’s hand, he couldn’t remember wetting his diaper. Frowning to himself he ,groaned into his pacifier.
Taking Dean from Gabriel, Castiel bounced his boy on his hip. He felt better now he had his boy back in his arms. “Baby this is Crowley, can you say hi?”
If there was one thing Gabriel knew it that he wasn’t a light sleeper, Castiel use to say that even if the apocalypse was happening he would sleep right through it, which Gabriel didn’t disagree with. So, when he woke to a loud crashing sound outside his bedroom door, he startled in confusion at what was going on.
“No. And he’s not going to. He wouldn't have let Cas have Dean if he knew. Michael has made it a rule that only couples can adopt the AB’s that he has come by. If Michael found out before I sorted the legal stuff he’d take Dean away,” Gabriel stated, looking rather serious.
Dean was still laughing while Castiel cleaned his face. Even though these men had taken him against his will he hadn’t felt this happy in years. Having a laugh was something he had always thought was what families did, but he never experienced it for himself until now. It felt good, so good that Dean even starting to think he liked his new life.
When she got back at her desk, Lilith looked at her boss. She couldn’t believe what she had witnessed. Michael didn’t order her to call the Bouncers to have the little collected, he was obviously not thinking straight, he was going to risk everything and for the stupidity of his brother. She never like Castiel or Gabriel, mostly Gabriel. Before she became Michael’s receptionist she used to work for Gabriel’s department and she never thought he appreciated her the way she deserved.
“I had help,” Gabriel smiled glancing over to Michael, who was standing in the door way, looking a bit sheepish.
Castiel gave him a side smile before letting out a sigh. “We’re okay. My baby isn’t so happy with me.”
“He’s okay, just got a little scared because I left the room,” Gabriel said, standing up with Sam in his arms.
“We are going to look at cars baby. Would you like that? Help Daddy and Uncle Gabe find one for me and you?” Castiel said.
Dean lifted his head in shock. Was it Michael’s fault he was taken away from his Daddy? Feeling a tap on his check, he turned to see Gabriel shaking his head at him.
A short while later they arrived at the local mall. Parking up close to the entrance, Gabriel opened the bout getting the stroller out.
The last time he saw Sam he was ten years old. He went by the house to check on his little brother, but it didn’t end well because John spotted him and kick the shit out of him for trying to see Sam. When he tried again a year later he found that they had moved away.
Sound asleep in his bed he found his brother with his arm protectively around his baby. They looked so beautiful he couldn’t stop himself from taking out his phone to take a few pictures of his precious family.
Smiling, Sam snuggled into Michael. He hoped his Daddy was right, he couldn’t wait to show Dean the toy he got him, he hoped it helped to make Dean like him again.
Suddenly in the silence there was a knock at the door. Hearing the door crash, Dean’s eyes shot open, looking round in a panic. Hearing something running loudly down the hall he held on to his Daddy tightly.
After Sam’s nap, Daddy had got a phone call from his brother. Dean’s Daddy, Castiel, had said it was okay to come over.
“Daddy hurt himself Dean. Yes, you did drop your bowl on the floor because you were angry and that was bad, but Daddy didn’t look where he was going, and fell over. Daddy doesn't blame you.”
Standing up from his chair, Castiel picked up the diaper bag before heading down to the back of the store with Dean.
“It’s okay Gabe, I forgive you,” Castiel placed his hand on the man’s shoulder. “Just next time think with your head and not your dick.”
Bring it down closer to his lips, he lightly kisses the back of his Daddy’s fingers before placing two of the fingers into his mouth.
“I’m coming to look at Dean’s nursery I didn’t get a proper look then I got the blankets,” he explained as they walked into the room.
Walking to into Dean’s nursery Castiel lay him down onto the changing table. Picking up a diaper and cream he placed the diaper under Dean bum then put some cream on the end of his fingers.
“It’s okay Honey, Daddy will make it all better,” Castiel tried to hold in his anger. Whoever had hurt his baby would pay for this. Taking out some wipes he slowly cleaned Dean’s skin.
“Hey..hey little man, why are you crying?” Placing the bags down on the bed, Gabriel lifted Sam up into his arm, “Baby, what’s that matter?”
Snuggling into Castiel’s chest Dean closed his eyes as he continued his bottle. Huffing with a smile Castiel kissed the top of his baby’s head, he really did have a cute baby.
Castiel smiled his brother, having a stuffed animal from him would be special for Dean, and could show his baby how much he cared. Nodding, both men turned back to Dean.
Sitting on Gabriel’s lap in the back of Gabriel’s landrover, he kept his eyes closed, trying to avoid seeing Michael driving in the front.
“It’s okay baby boy, Daddy’ll help you.” Lifting Dean’s jumper up, Castiel started to rub Dean’s belly.
“Don’t encourage him Ca...Cas” Feeling both his brothers tackle into him, Michael let out a small yelp as they fall to the ground. Looking down seeing gold and blue eyes shining up at him, Michael couldn’t stop himself from laughing as he wrapped his arms around his little brothers. Remembering when they were little boys doing the same thing, they use to always cuddle him like this when they were younger.
“Deany -Deany do you want to come to my birthday party? It will be loads of fun! We can have cake and -and dress up and -and play loads of games!”
I hope you like it. At the time I was thinking about making Michael kind of the bad guy, but I just couldn't do it.  please let me know what you think, I'm in the middle of working on the next chapter, I'll post the next part in a few days. xxxxx
Gabriel pushed Castiel up the stairs with his hand on the man’s back. Dean could see his Daddy’s arm covered in blood, he had really hurt himself. His eyes clouded over with tears and Dean looked away, feeling ashamed.
“He’s not your baby yet Castiel. He’s a boy we’ve kidnapped,” Gabriel said seriously “And I don’t want you to come because some of the stuff I have to do might upset you. I don’t want that for you. Just wait in the living room and when I’m done you’ll have a your baby boy,” he added still with his arms out, he knew his brother too well. If he saw what he had to do to the boy he wouldn’t like it. He didn’t like thinking about himself, but he wanted his little brother to be happy.
Michael had thought he had been seeing things, that he was just tired from work and imagined seeing his brothers walking down the street with a stroller in hand. But he had seen them, he even made his driver turn around to pass them again to make sure. After he walked back into his office, Michael ordered his receptionist Lilith to bring him any recent files that involved Castiel’s or Gabriel’s names in an adoption.
Dean nodded his head, feeling his cheeks blush. He really wanted to stay here with Daddy but he had been so naughty.
“Dean, I was going to wait till I got you home to tell you this, but I feel like I should do it now,” Castiel paused. He had to tell Dean how he felt. He just hoped the small boy would understand.
Hugging for a long while Gabriel pulls his boy forward to make Sam look at him. “Right my little man, I think it’s time we head home,” He said, smiling happily.
“Thank you baby.” Taking Dean’s hand, he placed his lips around his little fingers, licking of the chocolate.
Smiling to himself Sam crept back out. Even though he had a very wet diaper he didn’t want to wake the man.
Picking Dean up, Castiel could see Dean had tears in his eyes, he must have looked very funny to his baby. Feeling the cold, Castiel held Dean close to his chest using the softness of Deans jumper to stop him shivering.
“Dean’s bee, didn’t you give it to him?” Castiel didn’t wait for an answer when he saw Rosie sitting in Dean’s swing. Picking it up Castiel rubbed the bee’s fur between his fingers. “I’m just going to go give this to him.” Not bothering to hear Gabriel’s opinion Castiel, he heard him say something about him being soft on Dean, so what if he was his baby was upset and needed him, he headed back up the stairs. Opening the door he was shocked to find Dean wide awake.
“What...no, toys first...ohh or the sweet shop, right Deano? We don’t want boring clothes first, do we?” Gabriel whined, pretending to pout.
Pacing around Gabriel’s living room, he was starting to doubt that what they were doing was right. He remembered the first time he saw Dean.
Gabriel grinned. Dean was more than cute, he was adorable. “You’re welcome munchkin. I’m more glad you like it.”
“He’s Dean’s little brother,” Gabriel watched Michael’s face change to shock, he should have really explained to him why they were here, if he was honest he didn’t know why he was ether, he just had the feeling he needed to do this, for himself or for Dean he wasn’t sure yet.
“Hey hello, someone please help me!” Dean called out, but all that came out of his mouth was a muffed babble. Trying again he made the same noise. “Why can’t I talk?” he thought. Wriggling as much as he could Dean screamed as he went crazy trying to get loose from his claustrophobic prison.
Not really caring for her excuses Gabriel turned his attention back to the boy, “I want to meet him,” he said, opening the door Gabriel didn’t bother waiting for Meg.
“All’s forgiven Baba.” Kissing Sam’s forehead, Gabriel moved his baby to lay in his arms. Seeing his little boy’s sad, puffy eyes looking up at him, he smiled softly, hating seeing his baby upset. Picking up the bottle, he held it to Sam’s pouting lips. “Here baby, this will make you feel better.”
“Yes honeybee. Dean is very little,” Castiel turned his attention to his quiet boy in his arms. Dean was holding on to his shirt tightly, his boy looking up at Charlie as he shyly bit on his lower lip. Picking up Dean’s pacifier, Castiel held it to Dean to save his poor pink lip from more damage. He could understand his baby being nervous, this was the first time Dean had met another little.
Dean smiled. Closing his eyes, he leaned into his Daddy’s warm body, breathing in the man’s scent. He felt truly happy for the first time in forever.
“Casey, come here,” Gabriel whispered. Putting his arm around Castiel’s shoulder, he turned them to face away from Dean. “Cas, why don’t you go find Dean a stuffy or something,” Castiel looked up into his brothers grey eyes looking confused.
“Oh my god isn’t he a cutie? Hello little one, aren’t you pretty?” Getting up close one of the women pinched at Dean’s cheek, making a cooing noise. “Is he yours?” the other asked Gabriel.
Gabriel felt a lump in his throat, he knew that voice without even having to look up. “If I recall Michael, Dad left the company to all his sons, not just you,” Gabriel said, finally looking up at his older brother. The man in front of him stood tall in a clean cut, grey suit close to his desk. Michael looked very similar to Castiel. His dark hair gelled back perfectly and blue eyes shining, only unlike Cas’s blue eyes being bright and loving, Michael’s were a blue like ice. Amongst the staff Michael wasn’t known to be very nice, most tried to avoid him if they could, which did upset Castiel, especially when the staff mistake him for Michael.
Hannah knew she wasn’t going to get anything out of her friend, he was hurting so badly. She just couldn’t understand why Dean had been taken. Gabriel had been so careful making sure all the paperwork looked legitimate. The only person with the power to take Dean was Michael, but even though Michael could be a jerk she never thought he would hurt his own brother. Gabriel had warned her about Michael, but she just didn’t want to believe anyone could be so cruel.
Gabriel didn’t think so, “Deany, Daddy’s not very good at picking cars. The last one he got was crappy...oh what was it?”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Castiel chuckled “I know baby, Daddy wants to stay and cuddle too, but someone else needs the room. When we get home we can cuddle on the sofa, but before we go Daddy’s got a surprise for you.” Picking up his bag, Castiel pulled out his gift and held it up.
“Guess he was. I’m going to head home Casey, do you need anything before I go?” Gabriel asked, placing a pacifier on the arm rest.
Taking his last picture, Castiel jumped when he heard a loud knocking on the front door. Moving quickly he ran down the stairs. As he walked to the door he could see the shadows of two tall bulky men through the frosted glass of the door.
“Trust me, Gabriel, John Eric Winchester will soon be getting what is coming to him,” Michael smirked drinking his coffee.
Taking the man’s hand, Michael hid his displeasure at having to be touched by him. He wasn’t a fan at being touched by people he didn’t know.
Watching his Daddy walk over to the wardrobe, Dean saw him pull out a white sleeper with feet and mittens attached with a matching sleep cap. Snapping the buttons down Dean’s leg Castiel lifted his baby into his arms. “My beautiful boy,” he whispered.
Hannah walked over to Gabriel, letting him say his goodbye. “Come to me, my special flower. I'll walk with you and mommy to the car.” Taking Charlie in his arms again, Gabriel headed out, chatting away to the girl.
“Oh Betty...sweet Betty I really would love a coffee. I don’t think I’ll last much longer,” Gabriel smiled at the lady, running his hands down his face.
Pulling up onto the drive Dean could see that Daddy had got home before them. Seeing the man walk up to his door Dean smiled behind his pacifier, making grabby hands to his Daddy.
“Can you take the girls to bed?,” Michael asked the staff that was in the room. Seeing them look to Meg, they waited for her to nod her head to do as they were asked.
Hearing the noise Castiel quickly turned with his bowl and glass in hand to check Dean, heading over to his boy without noticing the red liquid on the floor Castiel slipped making himself and his bowl and glass fall with him. Letting out a loud cry Castiel felt his arm land in the broken glass, cutting into his skin.
“Probably not, but I’d do anything for my little bro and new nephew,” Gabriel smiled, looking back at Dean dozing in his arms. Seeing Dean still sucking on the nipple Gabriel removed it, replacing it with a pacifier Castiel had at hand.
“My precious boy, it’ll be alright. Daddy’s with you. Daddy will never let you go.” Castiel was trying really hard to hold his emotions in check, seeing his little one so worked up was getting to him in ways he had never felt before. He just wanted to hunt down everyone that had hurt his Dean and make them pay for what they have done to his baby.
Jumping at the loud bang of his front door, Castiel held Dean closer. Hearing Dean let out a whine he shushed his baby while rocking him gently.
“Good boy Deany, get all the air out. We don’t want an upset tummy do we? No we don’t,” Dean let out one big burp before Castiel stopped.
“Cas…” kneeling down in front of his family, Gabriel rubbed his brother’s knee, making Castiel look down at him with glassy eyes. “Cas, you alright?”
Feeling his cheeks warm at Daddy’s nickname for him, Dean glanced to Sam to see him watching him. “..Hun..gry..”
“And your uncle doesn’t understand the pleasure of a good lay in, does he Sammy?” Hearing Sam giggle into his neck, Gabriel kissed the boy’s cheek.
“I’m going to take Dean to change him.” Without hearing his brother out, Castiel grabbed the stroller with one hand and headed to the nearest changing room.
Gabriel rolled his eyes. “When is he ever happy? He wasn’t pleased that you didn’t tell him yourself, but I convinced him it was okay and he still doesn’t know about Dean.”
“I’ll think about Casey, but for now let’s just enjoy a beer and watch something that doesn't involve singing,” Gabriel said, taking a sip of his beer.
“Alright..alright silly boy we can get closer, but we can’t touch these cars okay?” Gabriel said moving up to the side of the car. “I don’t think Crowley would be best pleased if we touch his babies,” he added.
“I love you too baby,” Castiel whispered, hugging his boy. He was just so glad Dean still wanted to be his baby, he didn’t know what he would have done.
“Hannah this is Dean..he’s a bit shy,” Castiel tried to lift Dean’s head from his shoulder, but Dean was having none of it. Hearing his baby whine into his neck he gave up. “Deany it’s okay. This it Hannah. She works with Daddy and Uncle Gabe. She’s nice, she even has a little girl like you.”
Gabriel could feel himself smiling. Feeding Dean was the best thing he had ever done, the boy was so adorable. Castiel watched his brother and baby, they were too cute together.
Opening his eyes, Castiel stretched out, feeling parts of body pop. Looking round he saw light coming through the window. He was in Gabriel’s living room. Taking a moment, he started to remember the night before. Castiel sat up quickly in a panic. “Dean?”
Castiel wasn’t sure how much time had passed, he really didn’t care. Sitting with his sleeping baby in his arms was the best feeling he had ever had. His little boy looked so cute with his bee tucked into his chin and his paci slowly bobbing under his nose. He couldn’t think of anything more beautiful than his Dean.
“I can’t see him,” Castiel said, looking out the window. It was late in the evening, pitch black outside. Castiel had learnt that Dean usually was in the archway by now, but his boy wasn’t there.
Holding up his hand Sam pointed two fingers. “Your two huh, such a big boy,” Gabriel said making Sam smile wider. Seeing Sam look up behind him, Gabriel turned to see Michael and Meg coming up behind him.
Seeing his boy so worked up Castiel hugged his baby close. He knew what Dean wanted, he wanted to go save Sam. Even after being away from his brother for so long Dean still wanted to protect his little brother. He was sure if he was in Dean’s shoes he would be the same.
Letting out a light sigh, Gabriel turned his attention back to his screen. “Right, Dean Winchester. Let’s get you officially adopted by that sappy little brother of mine,” Gabriel got to work filling in all the forms and information, he had done some research online to see if he could find anything about Dean, turned out there wasn’t much to find. He had found the boy’s birth certificate and the last school Dean was registered at on the government database, but other than that there was nada about the boy. Bring up Dean’s school records he found Dean had a hard time fitting in at school. Had left school at sixteen without graduating, after that Dean disappeared for a while till he got into trouble with the police a few times for robbery and breaking and entering.
“I don’t know Gabriel. Dean’s been very sensitive today, I think what ever happened in that place has really got to him. Maybe it’s too soon for him to see Sam, especially when he sees that Sam is a Little as well.”
“Yes, Castiel, believe me, you were not the easiest baby, Father could never calm you and the nanny’s use to pray for me when I got home from school, you would not stop screaming unless you were with me, it even got to the point they put your crib in my room.”
Dean held onto Gabriel’s shirt with all the little strength he had. He wasn’t going to let go of his Uncle for anything but his Daddy.
Walking over to the changing table, Dean whimpered as Castiel slowly lay him down on the mattress. Feeling the mess against his skin Dean couldn’t stop the tears run down his cheeks. He didn’t like it, it made him feel icky, he just hoped Daddy wasn’t angry with him or think he was gross. Lost in his thoughts, he felt Castiel’s soft lips on his warm cheeks. Daring to open one eye he saw his Daddy smiling down at him, not showing any trace of being disgusted. “My brave little bumblebee, you’re okay. All babies mess their diapers, Daddy is going to clean you up, and then me and you are going to have breakfast and after we’ll go play with some of your new toys. That sound good?” Rubbing his thumb along Dean’s eyebrow, Castiel waited as his baby started to calm. He understood Dean feeling upset. It couldn’t be nice to wake up with a messy diaper. Seeing Dean’s green eyes looking upset he could feel his heart ache seeing his baby so sad. “Come on my beautiful boy, where is that gorgeous smile?” Tickling Dean under the chin Castiel smiled hearing his baby giggle. “There it is!” Staring at each other Castiel kissed Dean’s forehead, “My precious angel,” Castiel whispered.
Walking down the baby aisle, Castiel looked up at the toys. He really didn’t know what to pick. He didn’t want to get Dean toys that his boy wouldn’t be interested in. I knew a few other parents that didn’t give their babies a choice, but he didn’t want to be one of those parents. He wanted Dean to enjoy and want to play with his toys. Still looking at the toys nothing stood out to him. He wanted something special for his baby from him.
Hearing the bathroom door open, Gabriel turned to see Michael step out rubbing his damp hair with a towel, all dressed.
“Sammy!” Handing Dean over to Castiel, Gabriel stood to pick up his fallen baby. “You need to be more careful.”
“Oh, you’re hungry!” Castiel sighed with relief when Dean noded his head happily. Feeling the panic leave him, Castiel chuckled to himself, feeling silly. “Let’s get my special boy something to eat, shall we?” Standing up, Castiel held Dean on his hip. Moving round the table he stood in front of the high-chair. “Aright baby, in you go.”
“I lived with my Dad, he made me come here,” Sam mumbled with his eyes on his bear, he felt more comfortable looking at his friend then Gabriel.
When Dean first saw Sam in Gabriel’s arms the first thing that came to his mind was how big Sam had gotten, he had grown so much since the last time he saw him. Dean just couldn’t believe it, he had his Sammy back, and after all these years he finally was with his brother.
As Castiel lowered him down Dean let out a high squeal, trying to hold on to his Daddy. He didn’t want to go into the chair again. “Aww Deany, you have to sit in you high-chair baby.”
Taking out what he needed, Castiel started to undo the snaps of Dean’s jeans and bodysuit. Dean whimpered when the smell of his diaper hit his nose. He really didn’t like using his diapers. Looking at his Daddy he was expecting him to have a look of disgust, but in all honesty Dean thought Castiel looked a bit proud.
“Well, when your child has a wet diaper again he’ll just have to wait for you to wake up from your lay in,” Michael said looking unimpressed.
“Let me tell Dean when he wakes from his nap. If he is okay with it, we will come over to yours, but Gabriel I’m not promising anything. I’ll text you in a while.”
“Sir, I found something.” Coming out of his thoughts, Michael turned in his chair to see Lilith standing in front of his desk with a file in her hand.
Dean felt his heart stop in his chest, the last car was something he never thought he would ever see again. In a glossy black with shining silver sat a Chevrolet Impala. It looked exactly the same as his Dad’s most treasured car. His Dad loved that car, maybe loved it more then his sons. Dean remember one time he was playing with his brother outside, while his Dad washed his car, Dean slipped in the water hitting his head on the back door of the car. When his Dad saw, he started to yell and scream at Dean for hitting his beloved car. Without a caring if Dean was okay, his Dad grabbed him by the arm, dragging the boy into the house locking him in his room.
“I’m sure you’re not too busy to talk to your boss, surely?” a hard, gruff voice said above his head.
“You ready Baba?” Gabriel asked. Picking his boy up into his arms, Gabriel gently bounced his shy little boy.
Hearing his Daddy Sam frowned when he saw the hurt look on the man’s face. “No Daddy,” he said pouting up at him. Why would Daddy ask him that? Sure, he had been embarrassed about Daddy talking about his diaper, but he was okay with that. Dean didn’t seem bothered so he knew it was fine.
Nodding Sam hugged the bee close to him. He wished he had one to. Maybe Dean would share her with him?
Gabriel raised an eyebrow before looking down into the stroller. Dean looked up at him, frowning at both the men with his bee close to his cheek. He looked so mad, but so cute at the same time.
As they walked down the halls, Gabriel tried not to look round in disgust. The place was just disgusting, the walls were dark and grim with cracks from floor to ceiling and the smell was over bearing of bleach and shit but didn’t look clean at all.
Gabriel looked at his brother. He could see the love shining in his eyes. “It’s okay baby bro, I’m just glad you are happy and you’re going to be the best Daddy in the world to this special little man,” placing a kiss on the top of his brothers head, Gabriel moved to leave. “I’ll call you in the morning. I’m going to go into work and sort out the paperwork and maybe I’ll pop by to see my nephew in the afternoon.”
Picking up a yellow jumper, Castiel turns to his bored looking little boy. “What do you think of this Deany? Do you like this one?”
“Michael your not going to..” Feeling his heart in his thought Castiel watched as it looked like he was going to spank his baby.
Letting out a quiet groan Castiel quickly moved Dean back into his arms when he felt Dean dig his nails into his skin.
“Oh, right, okay. So why was my baby taken in the first place? You can not tell me it had nothing to do with him.”
“Here we go gents. These are some of my best I have recently come by,” Crowley said, indicating a handful of cars lined up along the back wall of the warehouse.
Hanging up the phone, Castiel rubbed his hand across his chin, he couldn’t believe it. Gabriel had adopted a Little, and not just any Little, Dean’s brother. Out of everything that had happened he didn’t see that coming. The poor boy was left all alone just like Dean had been. He knew Dean had a little brother, he just assumed he was with John Winchester, but it turned out that poor excuse of a father had abandoned all his children, the selfish asshole.
“It’s over baby boy, it’s all over. You were such a good boy, my brave little man, you can have whatever ice-cream you want.”
Biting down harder when he hears Gabriel cry, Dean suddenly felt himself drop to the floor with a thud. Collapsing onto his back Dean glared up at Gabriel, who was rubbing at the spot Dean’s teeth had been. Gabriel looked down at him, his face was like thunder. Smirking, Dean just glared at the man proudly.
“Oh shush you,” Gabriel felt his face warm. Seeing Sam clap his hand over his mouth, he knew Sam was finding Michael rather funny, which was just odd in his opinion. His big brother wasn’t the funny type, but it was good to see Sam was getting on with Michael so well and that his brother was trying.
Sighing to himself, Castiel gently pulled Dean closer to bring his forehead his lips. “Please baby, come back to me,” he whispered, stroking Dean’s damp cheek with the side of his finger.
Pulling up on to the drive, Gabriel turned to look in the back. Castiel was still gazing at the small boy. He had to admit he could see why his brother was smitten. The young boy was pretty. He just hoped what they were going to do worked to make both his brother and Dean happy.
Hearing Dean let out a whimpering sound Gabriel felt a knot in his stomach. He just wished he could take back everything he said and done.
Castiel looked at his brother worryingly, it didn’t normally take such short time to get the new babies ready. “How are they ready? it takes three to four weeks for them to be ready, they need time to get settled in their new lives before going to any family.”
Giggling at his Daddy, Sam held up his arms to be picked up. He loved when his Daddy said silly things.
“I know where the boy is and we’re going to go get him, but first I want to know why he was taken in the first place,” Michael said, looking very angry towards Lilith.
Michael was loving watching his family. He was secretly looking forward to this shopping trip, it was nice to be away from the office, but he was mostly enjoying being able to spend time with his brother and new nephew.
“Tongue back in your mouth Mr Novak, that’s where it is meet to be,” Dr Bailey said, tapping Castiel’s tongue with a small wooden stick. “Your Daddy is very silly Dean, isn’t he?”
“Hey don’t look like that Cassie. I said I was going to help you didn’t I?” Gabriel smiled, picking up the file to put it back, “I know how to perform the treatments they do to get the babies ready. All I have to do is grab the things we need, get Dean and we can do it at my house. As for the paper work, I'll sort it so it looks legal that you adopted Dean before the change. You earn enough money to support Dean so I doubt anyone will question it.” picking up his jacket Gabriel came to stand next to Castiel.
Trying not to think about it Castiel turned his attention back to Dean. His boy looked relaxed, asleep in Gabriel’s arms. Sucking lazily on his pacifier Dean held Gabriel’s shirt sleeve slowly rubbing it between his fingers.
Gabriel looked at his boy then to Michael, he knew Sam was asking to see Dean today but he knew they couldn’t just yet. He hadn’t even spoken to Castiel since bring Dean home.
“Dean was bought here today by accident and when we came to get him, we found out you were here too.”
Shaking his head, Dean shut his eyes tight. He knew he was imagining hearing his Daddy. Daddy was gone, that nurse said Castiel wasn’t his Daddy anymore and that they would make him forget him.
Standing up from the floor, Gabriel lifted Sam up with him. Placing him on his hip, even though Sam was rather tall, Gabriel was shocked at how light his new little boy was. Placing his hand under Sam’s bum he recognised the feel of a diaper. “Do you need a change before we go?”
Castiel rolled his eyes still smiling. He doesn’t think anything could make him stop. “Dean kissed me.”
Nodding, Castiel smiled down at his little boy. “Yeah we’re all fine now, Dean told us off. Said we were being silly, didn’t you baby?”
“Dean’s been...he had nightmares and has been very clingy, he wouldn’t leave me except for when I managed to get him to have his nap. Every time I tried to put him down he would cry, he asked for you a few times. And then when you called about Sam, he even told me he didn’t want to be my baby anymore. But thankfully when I told him Sam was a little too, he changed his mind.  I’m so worried Gabe, I think whatever happens at that hospital has really hurt him.”
“Well, we best get your check up done quickly, especially when there is ice-cream involved! It won’t eat itself.”
Michael had all the power when it came to rules and conditions of the AB program. There was nothing to stop Michael from taking Dean from him again if he wanted to.
“Well I’m glad he likes them,” Gabriel said, placing his and Castiel’s plates on the table. All three sat in silence as they ate. Castiel ended up giving Dean some of his as the boy kept moaning for more. When they finished Castiel saw that Dean’s lips and cheeks were covered in sticky syrup. Suddenly he came up with an idea. Putting his mouth close to Dean’s ear he started to whisper.
“What are you doing up so early?” Michael asked. Standing from his chair he picked up his cup to get himself another coffee. Looking the young boy up and down he noticed Sam’s diaper.
“Well if you put it like that, I’ll forgive my little man,” he said, leaning down kissing his boys warm cheek.
“Good idea, it has to be suitable for Dean to watch,” Castiel stated making himself and Dean comfortable under a blanket.
Nodding, Michael watched as his little brother walked into the bathroom. Dumping his towel into a basket he picked up the bags. He pulled out trainers and socks, a navy onesie and cream overalls with a cartoon dog stitched on the pocket and he lay them neatly on the bed. Smiling to himself, Michael was rather proud of the clothes he had picked for his nephew. Though he had very little experience with children or Littles, he thought he had good taste in clothes for them.
Once they finished eating Castiel put the plates in the sink before grabbing a cloth with Dean’s bottle from the warmer.
Dean just sucked on his pacifier nervously, he didn’t want to go out in public like this, but Castiel has promised it was going to be okay. Nodding a little, Dean felt Castiel stand, holding him tight.
Looking at his Daddy, Sam couldn’t believe he had asked him, “But..it pink,” he stuttered behind his pacifier.
Gabriel knew if Dean liked any of the cars he would have got it for him, even if his little brother was against the idea he would have done it anyway.
“My sleepy baby.” Cas said, kissing Dean’s forehead. “Dean, Daddy has some very important new to talk to you about.”
Wincing at the thought he could still feel the stinging across his bum and thighs. Feeling hand cup the back of his head, Dean realised that he must have made some type of noise, making Gabriel give him comfort.
Shaking his head, Dean smiled, bringing Rosie close to his face. Rubbing her soft, furry body against his check Dean sighed, happily resting his head back on Daddy’s shoulder.
Nodding Sam grinned bring his fingers to his mouth. Sucking on them he soon felt Daddy holding his paci to his lips. Taking it, he glanced to see Dean watching him, causing his cheeks to redden and he spat it back out in embarrassment.
“Let’s get you clean Deany.” Squeezing some shampoo into his hand Castiel got to work, rubbing it into Dean’s soft hair. Dean couldn’t say he didn’t enjoy his Daddy scrubbing at his head, it felt blissful having Castiel’s long, gentle fingers rubbing at his scalp.
Feeling his nerves kick in, Dean couldn’t help but suck on the pacifier. He felt scared. He didn’t know who Gabriel was taking to him to, what if he was mean or wanted to hurt him or worse?
Hearing Dean let out a light snore Castiel came out of his thoughts. Smiling down at his boy, he carefully got up from his chair.
“Yea we’re fine. Just needed to reassure my baby. He thought he couldn’t have anything pink coz John told him it was for girls.”
“Is he okay?” Michael asked, looking at them in the mirror making Dean jump at the new voice, he really wasn’t sure about Michael yet, but hearing the man’s cold, still voice did make him feel glad that he didn’t have the same warm but gruff voice as his Daddy.
“Dean, listen to me.” Cupping Dean’s face in his hands, he waited to see Dean’s green eyes looking at him. “Baby, Sam is safe. Gabriel went back with Michael late night and he took Sam home with him.”
“I love you baby,” Castiel whispered. Dean sighed happily, he was starting to think maybe he love Daddy too.
Really thinking about it he couldn’t remember the last time he actually spent time with his brothers outside of work. After their father died, Michael took over the responsibility of the family business and worked to make it the most successful in the whole country.
Feeling something rubbing against his lip, he opened one eye. He saw Daddy holding his pacifier, opening his mouth, he sucked on the nipple before closing his eye again.
Nodding her head Meg looked up at him nervously, turning away from him she lead them through the hospital.
“Let’s get you changed, the it’s nap time,” Gabriel said. He might be mad at the boy but he wouldn’t leave him in a wet diaper as a punishment, plus Castiel would probably kill him if he did. Dean stayed silent letting Gabriel quickly change him, he didn’t want to make the man any more angry than he already was. Letting out small hiccups Dean tried to stop himself crying but he couldn’t seem to stop. He wanted Daddy to come in and cuddle with him, tell Daddy he was sorry.
Feeling his Daddy’s voice vibrate, Dean turned around to placed his ear over Castiel’s heart. Dropping his bottle, he lay his arms around the sides of his Daddy’s torso, hugging the man close.
Watching Castiel and Dean go into the kitchen, Gabriel moved Sam to be cradled in his arm. “Are you doing okay Sammy?” he asked as he rubbed his finger along Sam’s warm cheek.
“Oh! Ice cream?” Dr Bailey smiled towards Dean. “You didn’t say you were going to get ice-cream, Dean.”
Dean sucked away, drinking down the cool juice. When Castiel showed him the bottle he wasn’t so keen to try it, but surprisingly when he sees Castiel frown a little he lets the man put the nipple in his mouth. He didn’t know why it bothered him but he didn’t like seeing the man upset.
Looking over to Dr Bailey, Castiel noticed her starting to undo Dean’s diaper, he knew Dean wasn’t going to be happy with her looking down there.
Taking in a deep breath, Castiel tried to compose himself for what might happen. Sitting Dean down on the edge of the table, he pulled carefully to remove Dean’s arms from around his neck. Soon as he removed them Dean started to scream at the top of his lungs.
“Leave baby...no one is leaving. I’m not leaving you ever sweetheart, and I don’t want you leaving me because Daddy would be so sad,” Castiel watched as his baby let out a small sigh. Is that what he was worrying about, poor baby? “Baby were you worried Daddy will make you leave?”
“You have a bad habit of laughing at your Daddy, baby boy?” Castiel grinned, once the doctor was done.
“It’s okay honey, just try and remember in future. Now Becky, you can head home we’ll see you tomorrow.” Seeing her babysitter nod before leaving the room, Hannah kissed Charlie’s cheek before turning to Castiel. “I’m sorry Castiel, I wasn’t sure how long you were going to be so I asked Becky to pick Charlie up from daycare and bring her here. I hope it’s not too much trouble.”
Grinning, Gabriel watched his big brother smile as he started to talk away with his boy. He didn’t know what it was about Sam, but he could see his baby had a way of getting to Michael’s soft side, which Gabriel considered a miracle in itself.  He hadn’t seen this side of his brother in such a long time that he had started to think that the brother he had grown up with was gone. When they were kids, they were all so close and Michael took his role as big brother very seriously, he was loving and very protective. He wouldn’t let anyone mess with his brothers, but he also never let Gabriel get away with anything. It did annoy Gabriel when Michael acted more like his father then his brother. And he always thought Michael was softer on Castiel then him, but he had to admit so was he. Castiel was the baby and never really got into as much trouble as he did.
“Not really...just got to finish this last bit of work then I’m off to see Cas.” Nodding to his computer Gabriel sat back in his chair, holding his cup close to his chest. He always liked the feel of the cup’s heat warm up his skin.
Groaning as slowly awakened, Dean felt stinging in his eyes as they adjusted to the brightness of the lights above his head. Lifting his head, he tried to sit up, only to find that he couldn’t move his body. Moving his hands slightly he could feel something soft rub against his fingers and when he turned his head to the side Dean felt the same softness against his check.
Humming again, Dean pulled Michael’s hand closer to where Castiel’s hand was resting on Dean’s belly. Placing the men’s hands together Dean put his on top so they stayed in place.
Gabriel got up from his chair and pulled out a file from his cabinet. “Do you remember the government’s A.B program?”
Sam continued to silently cry, which Gabriel thought was worse than wailing. His baby looked really hurt at not being able to see his brother.
“Fine, only coz you asked so nicely,” Gabriel said sarcastically, getting up from his chair Gabriel headed to the kitchen.
“Sammy, you don’t have to be sorry,” Gabriel said. Pulling him way from his chest he waited for his boy to look up at him with sad puppy like eyes. “Baby, you have nothing to be sorry about. It’s okay,” he added, kissing Sam’s damp cheek.
“Only the best for my little bro and his baby. I order the best survive the company did, they decorate and install the nursery and they also set up things like the high-chair,” he stopped to point at a light green high chair sitting next to Hannah. “And the playpen and bouncer are in the living room,” he added.
Nodding Sam turned away, not making a sound. He didn’t want his new Daddy to think he was weird for wanting something girly.
Rolling his eyes Castiel pulled one of the chairs over to sit on. It was going to take a while to get this stuff in his boy. Tapping the spoon on the bowl’s edge, he tried to think of what to do. For a few minutes he sat having a staring competition with his baby before he came up with an idea.
Dean honestly didn’t know what he was feeling. Castiel had spoken with such honesty and emotion, he knew none of what the man said was a lie. Castiel genuinely wanted him, he thought Dean was special. Dean knew he should hate this man that forced this life upon him but he just couldn’t find it in himself. This life Castiel was offering wasn’t something Dean thought would ever happen to him, but even he would admit it is a better life than the one he was living.
Holding the bee tightly, Sam shook his head, glancing at his brother with big puppy eyes. He was enjoying cuddling with the soft bee.
Nodding, Dean turned back to his Daddy to see him looking a lot better. He was just glad they made up.
“Good boy,” Gabriel said. Slowly picking him up, Gabriel placed Dean in his arms, resting the boy’s head in its crock. “Let’s go find your new daddy, baby boy. I know he is dying to see you.”
Gabriel tried to keep a straight face when he sees Dean look at him, the boy looked like he was begging for help. “Give it a try kiddo.”
Clutching his new car, Dean tried to look over Gabriel’s shoulder as he was lifted out of his seat. He couldn’t see any cars yet, all there was was a big warehouse. Maybe Gabriel got lost or something…
Gabriel stood behind, watching his little brother. He really couldn’t understand why it was difficult for him to just pick. Looking down at Dean, he saw the boy watching Castiel too. The boy hadn’t taken his eyes off the man the whole time, the baby must be warming up to him. Suddenly, an idea popped in his head.
After about the tenth smack Dean cried silently. He didn’t like being spanked, Daddy never did this to him.
Leaving his baby to have some alone time with his brother, Castiel walked into the kitchen followed close behind by Michael, to find Gabriel placing three cups of coffee onto the table.
Realising what Dean was doing Castiel wrapped his arms around his baby. His boy was trying to make him feel better. He really did have the sweetest boy in the whole world.
Meg looked at him with pity. She knew this was going to be hard for the poor boy to adjust, but he was going to have to if he was to be re-homed.
“Gabriel, where are you? You’ve made me worry all morning, I thought you would have come over to see Dean.”
“Sammy, we won’t be able to go see Dean...” before he could finish he sees Sam’s smile disappear, big tears start to form making Gabriel’s heart wince.
Hearing light footsteps, Sam see a smiling dark haired man walk out of the living room. Studding him, he looked very like Michael only a little shorter. With shining blue eyes, the man looked happy to see them.
“Ohh no. Don’t look at me like that baby boy. You hurt Daddy’s feelings.” Unfolding his arms Castiel leaned in close to Dean. “I think Daddy has to teach his little boy a lesson.”
“Don’t do that baby,” hearing his Daddy, Dean looked at him with sad puppy eyes. “Do not blame yourself for this. You didn’t know, this was all John.”
Walking up the stairs Castiel thought he had better check in on his boys, it had been some time since Gabriel had taken Dean up for his nap. Stepping into the nursery he had expected to find them sitting on the rocking sofa cuddled up only to find the room empty. Where were they? He thought. Leaving the room he moved to look in his room. Entering his room he stopped in doorway at the cutest thing he had ever seen.
“Casey I was starting to worry. Is Dean okay? He just started to cry, those women just came up to us and….” Castiel raised his hand up to stop his brother talking,  Gabriel looked like he had been in a panic but Castiel didn’t care right now. All that mattered was that Dean was happy.
Smiling, Castiel kissed his forehead, “As you wish baby, Daddy’ll sing for you, let’s go get changed and comfy in bed first. I think you can say with me tonight,” Castiel whispered, really meaning every night, he wasn’t letting Dean out of his sight ever again.
Dean’s eyes widened hearing Gabriel. He really didn’t want to hear this. It was bad enough knowing he was wearing a diaper, but these men expect him to use them? Lying in this Cas’s arms, Dean groaned hoping they wound stop talking.
“I thought you made it so that single people can’t adopt, only couples?” Lilith said, looking confused.
Soon as everyone was cleaned and ready Gabriel left theml to go put the stroller and diaper bag in the car. Castiel sat on the sofa with Dean feeding him a bottle. The bottle only had orange juice inside, Castiel didn’t want to give Dean formula yet after eating a big breakfast.
“Let’s get Deano comfy in his stroller and head in Cas. Just got a text from Hannah, the workers have started doing Dean’s room. They should be done after about lunch time,” Gabriel said as his put his phone in his pocket.
“Wow. Michael must like you Sammy. He doesn’t tend to do things like that for anyone.” Sitting with Sam on his lap Gabriel looked to his brother with his cheeky grin.
“Cassy, I need you to listen and now. Michael had nothing to do with this, he helped me get Dean back.”
“No... really? I thought it was cute,” Castiel said, looking at the jumper again as he put it back on the shelf. He soon saw Gabriel walking up to him with arms full of clothes.
“Dean did not hurt me, the glass did. Anyway, what did you do with Dean? Did you put him down for a nap?” Castiel asked, walking out of the bathroom. He should go check on him.
Smiling, Castiel holds Dean close. ”They get kisses!” Bringing his lips onto the boy’s neck, he took a deep breath before blowing a deep raspberry into Dean’s skin.
“Anyway, while I was talking to Gabriel he said that Sam really wants to see you, would you like that?”
“You want to just watch cartoons” nodding his head Dean looked up smiling to his Daddy glad the man understood him.
“You changed him?” Castiel said, sounding disappointed, It did annoy him that his brother got to change Dean’s first diaper. He wanted to have that moment with his baby. Looking back down, he saw Dean was still looking at him, looking very tried. His baby seemed shockingly calm to him.
Humming as he stretched out his limbs, Dean yawned as he snuggled into something. Scrunching his closed eyes he could feel a warm breath against his forehead.
Castiel felt like leaping in the air. His baby had smiled at him! Not wanting to make a big fuss and make Dean uncomfortable, he smiled back.
“What do you think bud, isn’t this awesome?” Gabriel grinned as he bounced Dean on his hip. Dean didn’t respond, he was too busy staring in awe at the beautiful machines. Seeing a classic light blue Chevy, Dean nudged his body into Gabriel to make him move closer. Seeing that the man didn’t move he let out a whine.
The next thing he knew, he was turned onto his belly forcefully, still crying loudly he suddenly felt something hit him hard across his diaper bum. He felt it again and again harder every time, turning his head he sees Meg was smacking his bum. Staring at her, Dean went quiet in shock, this was the first time he had been spanked since he was a kid.
Castiel moved around the table to get closer. “Uh huh. He loved them so much he wanted to give you something,” Castiel smiled, standing next to Gabriel with Dean in the middle of them. Nodding to each other Castiel leaned Dean into Gabriel. As Gabriel turned he came face to face with Dean, who smacked a big sticky kiss on the man’s cheek.
“We have been shopping, haven’t we Samuel?” Michael said towards the young boy on his brother’s lap, “I’m sure you noticed the nursery arrived.”
Castiel frowned. It did worry him what exactly has his brother had done. He really hoped Gabriel hadn’t gone to crazy. The man wasn’t known to do things normally.
“I think our baby boy likes his toy car and is excited Uncle Gabe, we had better get there soon.” Castiel smiled as he turned back to face the front.
Feeling Dean’s head sink into his lips, Castiel smiled as he pulled away to look into his baby’s eyes.
Hearing his brother’s words, Gabriel could feel a lump in his throat. That was the most loving thing Michael has said in a very long time. It was nice to hear that his big brother truly loved being Sam’s Uncle and wasn’t just pretending.
Gabriel looked at the boy in his arms in shock, why would Sam ask him that, “Why would I get rid of you? I just got you five minutes ago,” he half huffed, half laughed.
“I’m sorry baby, I thought you might like to play now. We can keep the tv on.” Castiel said as he sat them down on the floor. Sitting, Dean in his crossed legs, Castiel pulled over the bag of blocks they had bought yesterday. “Do you want to help Daddy build a tower, baby boy?”
Breathing in Dean opened his eyes when he took in a bad smell. Moving his legs again he soon realised that he had a messy diaper.
Once he was on his own, Gabriel realized how he acted was wrong. Dean couldn’t physically hurt Cas, he was just a baby. Castiel was right, it was an accident, thinking of what he said about spanking Dean if he was his Daddy made Gabriel wince. Rubbing his fingers across his forehead Gabriel couldn’t believe he had been so stupid. He was glad he wasn’t anyone’s Daddy, he wouldn’t be a good one.
Dean face dropped. His Daddy didn’t look happy. It wasn’t his fault he thought Daddy’s face was funny. Pouting, Dean looked up with puppy eyes.
Castiel didn’t know what to say to this, he had never liked the way Michael did things sometimes, but this was too much. Just thinking about it made him feel sick. What if Michael had got to Dean before he did? his baby would have gone through the same thing and he would be with a family that wanted a mindless thing.
After Sam finished his bottle, Gabriel sat his boy down with Castiel to go order takeaway for their dinner. Leaning into Castiel’s side Sam cuddled his puppy to his cheek, looking at his brother with watery eyes.
“It’s going to be okay baby Dean. You’ll like your new daddy. He’s going to love you.” bring him out of his head, Dean realised that Gabriel was talking to him. Still crying, he watched Gabriel remove his wet diaper. Feeling the cool air hit his privates Dean shivered when he felt something even colder wipe around his balls.
Dean tilted his head trying to look around his Daddy but he couldn’t see with the man standing so close to him. “..No!..Dada..” he pouted, looking up with big green eyes.
“Are you sure you don’t want me and Charlie to say with you Cas?” Hannah asked, standing in the doorway of Castiel’s front door with Charlie asleep in her arms.
“Let’s go have a look at your room, Deany,” Castiel whispered, looking down at Dean, who was now looking round from Cas’ neck.
Giving a weak smile Castiel tried to make himself relax. He knew Gabriel was the best at sorting these things, but he just couldn’t help but still be worried.
Sitting in his office chair facing the full wall window, he couldn’t get the image of how happy his brothers looked, especially Castiel, out of his mind. He couldn’t remember the last time he saw his little brother smile so happily.
“Whatever your planning in that scary mind of your Michael, please be sure the boys never find out what you are up to,” Castiel said knowing if their older brother already knew that little bit of information, Michael had a plan for John Winchester and it wasn’t going to be good.
“Deany….Dean, you okay?” Castiel asked, looking concerned. Looking up at the man Dean nodded, trying not to think.
Sitting in his carseat in the back of his new Daddy’s car, he watched the world go by, excited as they headed to Dean’s house.
Jumping out of his bed, he opened the door to see a large grumpy looking man in the hallway caring a heavy looking box.
Sam smiled into Gabriel’s shirt. He couldn’t believe how lucky he felt. He had never been treated like this before, even in the hospital the caretakers didn’t play with him like Gabriel did.
“Right this minute I’m going to forget you said that, but if I find out that you’ve hurt my nephew more then you say, we’re,” he stopped glaring at her, pointing between himself and Meg, “We’re going to have problems. Do you understand?”
Castiel and Dean smiled to each other as they watched their brothers, they really did look so cute together.
Feeling Daddy tug on his jumper Dean whimpered, he didn’t want his clothes off in front of the lady doctor.
“I think Dean is too tried to play today, baby girl. It’s nearly Dean’s bedtime and we need to get you home for your bedtime too.” Hannah said, picking Charlie up again.
“Oh Baba, he’s so happy.” Seeing his baby smile, Gabriel grinned, patted Sam’s diaper he noticed it was very wet. “Sammy, why didn’t you say you were wet?”
Dean came out of his thoughts when he heard Charlie squeal, laughing at Gabriel playfully blowing kisses into her hair.
Stepping into the room, Sam look up at him with the biggest smile. Seeing Sam jump off of Michael’s lap his new little boy ran toward him wearing one of his old shirts and diaper.
For the first time in his life Michael didn’t know what to do. If it was anyone else, he would order for the little to be collected and sue the person. But this was Castiel, his little brother. Could he really do that to him? If he did he would risk the little relationship he had with his brothers, but if he didn’t and certain people found out he would be seen as hypercritical. He can’t make the rules then let his own family break them. But he couldn’t do it, Castiel and Gabriel might not know it but he loved them more than he loved his business.
Dean looked along the row. Two of them were mid 90’s Ford Mustangs, another was a 70’s Cadillac Eldorado, there was two new cars one was a Ford SUV and the other was an Audi Q3.
Leaning his head on his Daddy’s shoulder Dean breathed in the man’s scent of dove soap. With one of his arms around Daddy’s neck he started to play with Castiel’s damp, soft hair.
Dean giggled at Gabriel. He didn’t disagree. Castiel might be a nice guy but he really hoped the man didn’t pick anything else like that jumper.
“Sammy, Cas is going to love you,” Gabriel said, trying to sound reassuring. His little ‘nerves had clearly been making him overthink.
Thank you all for all your lovely comments and kudos, was upset to see that my story offended someone and I do apologise for that, I never thought my story would do that, but I have added warnings now and again I am sorry I'm rather new to writing on here and I wont let it happen again.
“Why did you get Dean a dress?” Castiel asked, sounding a bit angry. What was his brother playing at?
“Shh Cas, I’m not going to do what you think,” Michael said not taking his attention off the baby on his lap. Slowly swaying his legs back and forth, Michael started to hum as he rubbed and patted Dean’s back.
“What if Michael finds out? And Dean...Dean probably won’t do this willingly.” Castiel started to panic a bit.
“Alright baby, but you have to hold ether my hand or Mickey’s hand at all times, okay?” Gabriel said, trying to sound a little stern. He didn’t want to lose his baby on their first outing.
“Sorry Daddy.” Sam said, wiggling out of Gabriel’s hold. Picking the box up again he drag it closer to Castiel so Dean could see, “Look De, it a race track.”
Dean turned when he heard his name. Feeling his heart leap, he stretched his arms out as much as he could towards Castiel, still crying. He just wanted to get away, away from all of this. Making grabby hands, Dean didn’t stop till he had ahold of the man’s shirt.
Jumping at the sting Dean started to cry again. He really didn’t want to be here, he just wanted to get out. Dean would have wanted to go home, but he had no home to go to. His dad had kicked him out when he just turned sixteen, leaving with his little brother to a different state. Leaving Dean to look after himself, which didn’t end well what with him living on the streets.
Taking a seat on the sofa, Castiel and Gabriel sat with their boys on their laps facing each other, while Michael sat in the recliner close by.
“I did,” Gabriel laughed, “I don’t mean that, I mean his diaper smells. You need to change your baby. I’ll grab the changing stuff.”
“Cas...Castiel,” running up to his brother, he lifted him up to his feet. “Cas come on we need to get going.”
“I found your name written in your old coat Dean,” Gabriel reassured the boy when he sees Dean open his eyes. Letting out a loud sigh out of his nose Dean continued his bottle, hoping that was all Gabriel had found out about him.
Michael’s heart stopped when Castiel waked away. He knew his little brother would not forgive him, he had hoped he could have explained, but it was clean Castiel wasn’t in the mood to listen.
“Shh..shh..I’m just going to change, Deany. I’ll be right here, then we can cuddle hmm...I’m not going anywhere I promise.”
Relaxing into a happy sleep, Dean listened to the words his Daddy sang quietly. Letting out a small sigh, he smiled into Castiel’s chest. No one could replace his Daddy and nothing could ever make him forget him.
Taking a moment to think, Dean made his decision. Lifting his arm up he touched his fingers against Castiel’s stubbed chin. “...Da..ie...”
Dean snuggled into Castiel’s shirt breathing in his scent, he was just so happy to be back with his Daddy. “..Miss...uw..”
“Oh shut up,” Gabe said feeling his face warm up. “I’m Sammy’s Daddy now. I’ll do anything to make my baby happy.  You didn’t see him Cas, he’s so lovely and sweet and the fact that his father tried to sell him, just makes me want to find the bustard and make him pay for what he has done to them, boys.”
“Hello, Mr Novak. I see you are in for a checkup for you and your son,” she said, smiling towards Dean.
“I’ll do this quick,” she said, with a sympathetic smile. Seeing the boy look so calm, she wasn’t looking forward to making him upset.
Sam sighed, happily sucking on his pacifier. He couldn’t remember the last time he giggled like that. The way Gabriel made him feel was confusing and amazing at the same time. The man had been so nice he was starting to think he was dreaming.
Taking his hand away from his face Gabriel beamed. His boy thinks he’s the best! He hadn’t been a Daddy a whole 24 hours yet and he was already the best.
Gabriel was his new Daddy, but he had said that Dean was his nephew, so Dean was closer to him then he was. What if Dean said he didn’t want he around, would Gabriel take him back?
“You ready to go baby?” Castiel asked, rubbing his finger along Dean’s cheek. Dean looked at him shyly. He wasn’t sure he could do this. A part of him knew if he went in there he could try and cause a scene and get taken away from Castiel and Gabriel, but the other apart didn’t want to leave Castiel. Sinking into his seat Dean felt his chest tighten. He didn’t want to go in.
Once Dean had finished eating Castiel handed Gabriel the bottle. “Casey, I’ve never done this before,” Gabriel said, holding the bottle looking unsure.
Shaking his head Dean looked up with teary green eyes. Sighing to himself Gabriel put the fork back on the plate.
Taking a seat at the table Castiel sat Dean across lap. Using one of his arms to support Dean, Castiel pulled the plate closer to the edge. Smiling, he sees that Gabriel had cut up Dean’s pancakes into small pieces. “Thank you Gabe,” Picking up the folk he stabbed a piece covered in maple syrup. Castiel brought it up to Dean. “Open up baby.”
“Hello Bumblebee, are you feeling better, you scared your Daddy and Granddaddy,” Castiel asked rubbing his thumb along his baby’s cheek.
Gabriel didn’t have to guess why Dean wasn’t with his father, the boy either ran away or was kicked out, but it didn’t really matter as Gabriel knew Castiel would give the poor boy the love and affection he truly needed. “That poor boy has been through some shit,” he said to himself.
Pulling back the covers he climbed out of the bed. Looking back at the bed he found his pacifier on one of the pillows. Picking it up he put it into his mouth, and sucking it he started to feel calmer.
“You’ll have to take him tomorrow. We’ll go look at cars this afternoon and if we don’t find anything I'll take you.”
Dean couldn’t help but wonder who his so called new daddy was. Maybe he could reason with the man, convince him to let him go, tell him that this was all a misunderstanding, that Dean didn’t want to be a baby. Feeling the blanket being wrapped back round him tightly, Dean looked down at Gabriel to find him holding an overly large pale blue pacifier in his hand. As Gabriel tried to put it in his mouth Dean shook his head, trying to get away from it.
Castiel worked fast when he hears his baby cry. He made Dean a bottle of formula and a bowl of one of the AB meals he found in the fridge. To him it looked a lot like baby food but he remembered hearing it had all the nutritions and protein for an adult. It was highly recommend to feed babies this for the first few months. Looking at it Castiel turned his nose up. It didn’t look very appealing, but hopefully Dean would like it.
“Home...” Sam grinned, he had a home and a Daddy. He was finally getting out of here and he was going to see his big brother again after such a long time. This was defiantly the best day of his life.
Next thing he knew he felt a sharp stab in his butt cheek. Opening his eyes fully, Dean let out a screeching howl.
“Guess he’s busy,” he whispered to himself. Sighing at his phone he scrolled down his names to Michael’s phone number.
“Oh, you liked Rosie hmm?” Feeling a small nod, Castiel smiled towards Gabriel who grinned shaking his head. This was clearly the quietest fight over a toy they had ever see. When he and Gabriel were little they use to scream at each other over whatever toys the other had, not caring who’s feeling were hurt. But watching Sam and Dean it was clear they were trying not to upset each other.
“Ohh, my baby. My Deany,” hugging Dean, Castiel kissed every part of Dean’s face. “My baby...I’m so so sorry.”
“I’m not a baby,” Dean glared at the man when he hears himself mumbling again. What the hell had happened to him?
“Hmm, I think we’ll have scrambled egg and toast. How does that sound?” Castiel asked, looking to his boy.
“Okay, baby, it’s your turn. It will only take a few minutes, then we can go get ice-cream with Uncle Gabe.”
Sensing a change Gabriel started to walk over to where the pink body suit was. Seeing it, he picked out one he knew would fit Sam, “Would you like this sweetpea?”
“Gabriel?” Turning round Gabriel found Michael standing behind him with shoe boxes in his arms. “Everything okay?”
Dean groaned when he felt Dr Bailey start to feel up his legs and belly, he didn’t like the feeling of her cold hands roughly pulling at his body.
“No one hurts my family, you should realise that by now,” Gabriel smirked tapping Michael near the small burse on his chin.
Dean wasn’t sure where he was. He had been crying so hard, he didn’t really see anything till he was dumped in a dark room. Looking round with tears fallen from his eyes he noticed he had been put into a metal crib. The mattress was hard and plastic. It wasn’t nice like his crib in his nursery.
Gabriel laughed. “Michael would sell us if he made money out of it, he’d just see what we did as money loss. He doesn't care about anything but himself and profit,” He could see in Hannah’s face she knew he was right.
Gabriel huffed with a smile. “Let’s just say that was pay back for biting me yesterday. I got the dress for Hannah’s little girl for her birthday and I thought I’d have a laugh,” picking up a different bag Gabriel pulled out a pale green onesie and a pair of denim overalls. Handing them over to Castiel he pulled out a pair of white socks as well.
“Sorry Daddy,” Sam hiccuped into Gabriel’s neck, he really was, he didn’t like Dean and Daddy being upset with him.
“Oh Deany...shh, its okay. You’re okay, Uncle Gabe is here. I’m here,” Gabriel lifted the crying boy into his arms. Holding him close he hugged the poor boy tightly.
“He...my...”Dean choked back his tears. He was suppose to be Sam’s big brother and he wasn’t there to protect him.
Giving a weak smile, Michael tried to relax as he drove to Castiel’s. He just hoped that his little brother felt the same.
Quickly moving into the room, Castiel picked up tired little boy, “Shh my poor little bumblebee, aww my baby is so tired.”
“I’m sure he’ll call when he wakes up Bumblebee. It would take a lot to wake that Uncle of yours.” Castiel said, chuckling to himself. He knew full well how hard it was to wake his brother, it was like trying to wake the dead with a heavy metal band, it just wouldn’t happen.
Gabriel let out a sigh before putting his spoon down. “Michael’s scientist have made a new serum. It’s called a mind wipe, it was made to clear a person’s mind, making them mindless, they forget who they are...they forget everything. It would be like they were newborns.”
Seeing Castiel checking Dean all over after hearing Sam explain, Gabriel’s face softened picking up his crying boy. “Oh Sammy, it’s okay Baba, I’m sure that was scary. Why didn’t you call us?” Using his thumb to wipe away tears Gabriel kissed his baby’s forehead.
Sighing to himself, Castiel turned his attention down to his baby. Dean lay quietly with his face pressed against his chest. With his eyes closed, the boy looked so peaceful, he almost looked like he was going to sleep.
Sitting at the table was Michael, with a happy looking Sam sitting on his lap looking at a laptop on the table.
“No! Hmm. Are you going to try something like that again?” Gabriel raising his eyebrows, looking serious. Dean shook his head again faster. “Okay then baby…. I was going to let you regain the used of your legs but I’m starting to rethink that idea.” Walking past Dean, Gabriel picked up a readymade syringe. flicking it with his finger Gabriel approached Dean quickly to inject it into the boy’s neck.
“Shh..shh Deany boy, everything’s okay. Hmm, are you hungry baby boy?” Picking up a folk full of omelette, Gabriel held it to Dean’s mouth.
Quieting down, Dean looked up to see a man looking down at him. The man looked older than him, but it couldn’t have been by much. He didn’t look very tall ether, but Dean couldn’t really tell as he was lying on his back. The man smiled as he pushed his light brown hair out of his grey eyes. “Did you have a good sleep baby?”
Nodding in agreement, Sam cuddled into Gabriel. The man was right. It was rather late into the night and he was feeling hungry and sleepy.
Seeing Hannah laughing behind her hand, Castiel glared at her. He couldn’t see what was so funny. Standing up, Hannah moved next to him. Making him move over, she knelt down in front of Dean. “Hey sweetpea, I like your bee...” she waited for the boy to look at her to continue, “He looks very soft.”
Soon as Dean did as he was asked, Castiel got to his feet. Holding Dean close to his chest, he turned towards his nephew. “Sammy, could you do something very important for me?”
Moving quick to get out of his clothes, Castiel slipped into a pair of sweat pants. Not bothering with a shirt he climbed into his side of the bed. Moving Dean on top of him with his baby’s back on his chest, he picked up the bottle and held it to Dean’s lips.
“His father, a John Winchester. The records say that he demanded money for the boy, but when we did a background check on him, he found out and did a runner, leaving the boy here.”
Turning back to Gabriel, Dean gave him a small smile before opening his mouth. Hearing both Gabriel and Daddy laugh, Dean waited for his uncle to feed him.
Hearing Sam, Dean felt his heart swell with joy. He hadn’t heard Sam call him De in a long time. Holding out his arms, he made grabby hands towards his little brother. “Sammy.”
Rolling his eyes, Castiel grabbed the stroller walking away. Dean watched him go, his insides gurgled seeing Castiel leave. Worse, Gabriel was holding him very tightly, which wasn’t helping his bladder.
“Will you sit in your chair while I make it?” Castiel asked, sounding a bit of hopeful. Seeing Dean frown at him he pretty much got his answer. “Never mind, Daddy can cook one handed… I think.” Pulling out everything he needed Castiel placed the bread in the toaster. While the eggs cooked, Castiel walked around the kitchen, swaying Dean to the music. “How I love the way you move, and the sparkle in your eye, there’s a colour deep inside them, like a blue suburban skies.”
“Come on Mickey, get into this cuddle fest,” Gabriel smiled holding out his arm making a grabby hand towards his big brother.
“There we go, all clean,” Castiel said, patting his hand on the front of Dean’s diaper. “Right, what shall we dress you in today baby?”
“What are you up to Gabriel?” Jumping on the spot, Gabriel looked up the stairs to see Hannah looking down at him worryingly.
Gabriel rolled his eyes, “It was a last minute thing Michael. You know what Casey is like, he never thinks ahead before doing anything, and besides, our little brother needs a break and he hasn’t used any of his holiday time.”
“I’m nearly finished Dean, just one more,” Dr Bailey said as she rubbed her free hand across his back.
Walking into the kitchen Castiel stood in front of the high-chair. “In you go baby boy, Daddy’s going to make you breakfast.”
Hearing his Daddy, Sam groaned, feeling his cheeks warm. Why did Daddy ask that? Now Dean will know he uses diapers.
Dean let out a loud groan, he was watching that. Why was Daddy moving him? Dean frowned up to his Daddy.
Castiel chuckled to himself. He did love how bold Charlie was. The girl might be a “little” but she was an old head on young shoulders.
Dean smiled, nodding. Splashing the water Dean giggled, doing it again getting it onto Daddy’s shirt.
“We need stuff for Dean. I only grabbed a handful of diapers and I don’t have a baby stuff here. You need diaper, bottles, cloths, food and formula, I’m just going to get what we need till tomorrow when we do get the bigger things for your house like a crib and other stuff.” Gabriel grabbed his wallet and keys and headed out the door without saying goodbye.
“I think celebrating is in order. Shall we order take out and have a little party, just the five of us?” Castiel asked, smiling at his family.
“Na, he’s fine where he is,” Gabriel looked up at his little brother, smiling. “I like this,” he added before turning his gaze back to the baby.
“What are you doing baby?” Castiel asked, only to be answered with a hum. Not sure of what Dean was trying to do he leaned forward so he was face to face with his determined little man.
“I’m so, so sad. What can I do to make my baby forgive me?” Turning to look back at Castiel, Dean sees him peek one eye up at him before hiding again, pretending to cry.
Hearing nothing, Gabriel started to panic, “Cas...Cas are you still there? Look, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you. It all happened so fast and I couldn’t just leave him there in that place, and oh my god that place it was hell. He just looked at me and I fell for him and he’s just the cutest thing and...”
Dean sighed. He wished they could hurry up. He just wanted to get back to Castiel and get out of here now.
Walking into Dean’s room, Gabriel lay Dean down on the changing table. Undoing the snaps he checked Deans diaper to find it wet.
Opening his mouth Dean sucked on the nipple. Closing his eyes, Dean let out a hum as the warm liquid filled his belly.
“Did your first Dad have that car?” Dean nodded, happy his Daddy understood him. Feeling Daddy hug him close Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel neck hugging him back.
So why could he still remember? Why can he still hear his Daddy’s gruff loving voice in his head? Letting out a sob, Dean couldn’t stop himself from crying loudly.
“You go to sleep now Dean. I’m very upset you made Daddy hurt himself, that was very bad. Hopefully when you wake up you’ll be ready to say sorry to Daddy.”
Hiccupping as he cried, Sam lay his head on Gabriel’s shoulder. He really hoped what Gabriel said was true. He didn’t want Dean to hate him. “See him?” Sam mumbled into Gabriel’s shirt.
“I’m sure he isn’t now. I don’t think my boy would fall asleep on you if he didn’t like you,” Castiel said combing his fingers through Dean’s blonde hair. Feeling Dean lean into his touch Castiel grinned at his sleeping baby, he looked so peaceful in his brother’s arms.
Castiel looked up at the men with wide eyes, they were here for Dean. “What are you talking about? I am legally his Caregiver, I have the papers to prove it,” Castiel could feel his anger rising with every minute, he was not letting anyone takes his baby.
“We’ll be okay Hannah, but thank you, thank you for all you’ve done,” Castiel said, looking at his friend with tired eyes. Today had completely drained him. It had been one of the worsted days of his life and all he wanted to do was curl up with his baby and sleep.
Dean’s eyes widened in shock. It’s a dress, but he’s a boy...man, why did he get him dress? Dean looked to Castiel in a panic but by the look on the man’s face he was just as shocked as he was.
“Cas? Cas where are you?” Dean knew that voice it was Gabriel. Sinking into himself Dean knew he was in for it now.
“Charlie….what have I told you about entering people’s homes without permission?” Hannah said, frowning at the girl on her hip. Looking behind her she saw the babysitter come into the kitchen not long after Charlie.
As they walked up the warehouse Dean eyes wondered, looking at the cars going past, he recognised some of the cars from when he lived with his Dad, his Dad had fixed many classic cars while he lived with him, but because his Dad didn’t let him near them, this was the closest he had ever gotten to see the amazing machines.
“Here you go.” Coming out of his thoughts, Michael looked up at his brother, holding out a pair of jeans and t-shirt, Michael turned his nose up.
Dean smiled up at his Daddy. He like that tattoo even more now he knew what it meant. Holding his arms up, Dean waited for Daddy to pick him up. he just wanted to cuddle the man forever, for being so lovely.
Hey All, I'm still here, I lost this chapter to technical problems and two-year writer's block, so that sucked, I've actually able to get something out and I've finally got some ideas  I'm just sorry it's not as long as I would have liked. let me know what you think. Thank you for all the kudos still even after so long xxxxxxxxx
Chuckling, Castiel brought his mouth close to Dean’s ear. “I think if you show Uncle Gabe your pretty green eyes he might make you his special pancakes,” he whispered.
“Mama?” Coming out of her thoughts Hannah looked up to see Charlie walk up to them, rubbing one of her eyes with her fingers.
Dean didn’t want to answer that one. He still wasn’t sure about Gabriel. He wasn’t as charming to be around as Castiel. Dean didn’t see the point in complaining again. The man was going to take him whether he liked it or not. Feeling a hand on his cheek, Dean turned to see Castiel stroking his face with his thumb.
Smiling wide behind his pacifier, Dean couldn’t help but get excited. He remembered Gabriel saying they were going, he just didn’t realise that they were going to go today. Feeling something on his lap Dean looked down to find a red rubber toy car on top of him. Picking it up Dean hummed at how soft it felt. Hugging it into his chest Dean looked back at his Daddy grinning even wider.
“No,” Dean responded, holding his other arm out he tried to sit up so he could get closer to his brother.
Lilith’s face scared face changed when she heard Gabriel talk to her. “Because Michael has worked too hard on the AB Program for it to be destroyed by his stupid brothers,” she said, glaring at Gabriel.
Dean just looked at him. He didn’t know if he should tell Daddy. He didn’t want Daddy upset and think he ruined their day.
Tickling Dean’s sides Gabriel beamed hearing his nephew laughing, he could tell Dean was a car lover, he had been watching him since they entered the building, the boy was trying to look at every car frantically so he didn’t miss any.
“No..Dada,” Dean moaned, blinking up at him tiredly. He didn’t want to go for a nap, he was playing with his blocks with Uncle Gabe and was actually enjoying himself. Looking to Gabriel, Dean pouted, hoping the man would be on his side.
Turning back to look at his Daddy, Sam felt his stomach drop. His Daddy looked like he was almost going to cry. He didn’t mean to upset his Daddy so badly, he just wanted to play, not make his Daddy cry.
“I never wanted this. I never asked you to go this and now because of you my family is hurting,” Michael yelled, slamming his hand down on her desk and making Lilith shake.
He was very proud of his work and he knew he was good at it, but because of his dedication he lost having a close relationship with his brothers and that hurt him most. But he would never let anyone see anything upset him.
As he made his way around the store looking for his brother and baby, Castiel heard crying coming from nearby. Poor little thing sounded so upset, Castiel felt sorry for the parent that had to comfort the sad baby. Turning a corner Castiel finally caught a glimpse of the back of Gabriel’s head. Hearing the crying getting louder, Castiel soon saw Dean. The poor boy looked red in the face. Getting closer, Castiel heard Dean’s heart wrenching cry. It was his baby that was crying so loud. Jogging with the stroller, Castiel hurried to get to his boy.
Gabriel looked down at the sad little boy in his arms, his heart melted at the sight, he just wanted to cuddle the boy and never let him go.
Gabriel couldn’t believe what he was hearing. How could any father do that to their child? First, he abandons Dean, then tries to sell his other son. What kind of man did that? One thing Gabriel did know was he was glad he’ll never meet John Winchester because he would have killed him.
“Of course, you don’t need to ask Gabe. I’m sure Dean’s diapers will fit Sam, so just use what’s up there,” Castiel said as he picked up the warm bottles. “I’ll leave Sam’s bottle on the table for when you come back.”
Sucking on the pacifier Dean felt his head start to hurt. Looking at the back of Castiel’s head, the man was sitting in the front seat chatting away to Gabriel about things he really wasn’t listening to. The dark haired man, from what Dean had learnt in the short time he had been with him, seemed to be a genuinely nice guy. He had been nothing but kind and loving and he hadn’t shown any inclination that he was going to hurt Dean. This was the problem that had Dean feeling so confused. A part of him was actually enjoying the attention.
“Let’s go find Uncle Gabe and thank him shall we?” Dean looked at his Daddy before nodding his head.
“Why De?” Sam asked. He couldn’t understand, why was Dean mad at him? He wanted to make his big brother happy. But his gift wasn’t working.
“You’re all ganging up on me, you’re making my baby laugh at me,” Gabriel said, playfully pouting at his family.
“I guess I can’t, if Samuel wants me to come then I shall.”  Grinning towards Sam, Michael got up from his chair. “We best get ready then, I’ll have to stop off at home to change.”
Laying his head onto Castiel shoulder, Dean hummed happily. He didn’t say anything, he felt like he didn’t need to, he knew Daddy knows how he felt.
Walking in Sam gasped at how big and busy the mall was. There were a lot of people walking past them trying to avoid walking into them. Sam looked around in amazement. There was so much to see that he didn’t realise it when they stopped.
Gabriel looked to his brother, seeing what was clearly love in his eyes. He had that look that Gabe made seen many times before with some of his clients. “Oh Cassie….I think I might be able to help you.”
“D...Dean,” Sam started to feel his eyes tear up. he hadn’t said his big brothers name in so long, his Dad had band him from talking about Dean. If he even mentioned him, his Dad would get angry and hurt him. Whimpering Sam hugged his bear to his chest, he felt so bad, he missed his big brother so much.
Gabriel drove through town not caring about the laws of the road. He had to move fast and nothing was going stop him.Not bothering with parking he stopped his car at the front of the office entrance. Storming through the building he didn’t give a shit for anyone in his way.
Baby! Wait, he was a baby, Sam couldn’t see him like this! What would he think seeing his big brother treated like a baby. He needed to normal again before he sees his brother.
Sighing, Gabriel started to chew on one of his fingers. “I’m sorry Cas, something came up. How’s Dean?”
Looking down, Dean smiled as he looked at the creamy rainbow of options. He could not decide which one he wanted, they all looked so good. Looking back at Daddy he shrugged his shoulders.
“Deany, I’m sorry I was mean to you earlier. I really am sorry baby boy. When I saw your Daddy was hurt, I forgot myself and took it out on you. I hope you can forgive me.”
“Baby’s pancakes are on the table Cas, still doing ours,” Gabriel said, not looking away from the pan.
Dean gasped when Daddy opened the door. The room was amazing. The walls were painted a light, pale blue with a white wood panel border. In the corner close to the large bay window was a beautiful dark grey crib with blue and white stars covering the bedding. Above the crib hung a mobile with shiny three dimensional stars and moons.
Gabriel didn’t try and hide the anger on his face, it was probably because of her why Dean was so quiet and withdrawn.
Dean could feel his cheeks redden. He had never felt so exposed before. He had been in just a diaper when he was with Daddy and Gabriel but that was different, now he was naked in front of a stranger. Cuddling into Daddy, Dean felt Castiel’s soft skin against his. Closing his eyes Dean lay his head on Castiel’s shoulder, it felt kind of nice being this close.
Dean held onto his Daddy tightly as they walked through the house. The inside was even more amazing. It looked modern, with an old fashion and cosy feel to it. Dean was starting to feel dizzy trying to look at everything at once. He couldn’t believe he was going to live here, it was the nicest place he had ever seen. With all the looking around he was doing he didn’t notice someone walking in the hallway from the kitchen.
Walking into the mall the sound of people suddenly surrounded them, making Dean sink into his seat. Anxiously, he kept his eyes on Castiel, who smiled down at him.
Sam thought he was going to be sick. He was feeling so nervous to the point that he could feel his whole body shake. He just couldn’t believe it, he was going to see Dean. After so long he was finally going to be back with his big brother.
“I use to do this with you,” Michael whispered continuing to rock Dean. “It was the only way to get you to stop crying.”
“I could be your Daddy,” Gabriel whispered, he never thought he would make a good Daddy, he didn’t think he could be like Castiel. His brother was loving, caring and protective everything. Gabriel thought he wasn’t, but when he looked into the face of the cute boy in front of him he wanted nothing more than to have Sam with him.
Deans face dropped he was starting to regret his acting out. Shaking his head, Dean looked up to Gabriel with tears in his eyes “nu….nu.”
With Deans birth certificate he used it to find out about Dean’s parents. Dean’s mom had died when he was very young and his dad was registered in a neighbouring state with his other son. Looking at the police reports it kinda showed John Winchester wasn’t a good man to be around.
Once he was back in the living room, Castiel let out a long sigh as he looked around the room. He didn’t like being on his own. Hearing his phone vibrate on the table, Castiel quickly picked it up to see Gabriel’s name flash up.
Walking in they were stopped by an old man sitting behind a desk. “Can I help you gentlemen?” he asked.
Castiel breathed in heavily, looking at his brother. Gabriel looked like a kicked puppy, with his grey eyes shining. Castiel was closer to Gabriel more than any of his other brothers. He trusted him above anyone else. He really didn’t want to not have Gabriel around Dean, but he would if he had too.
Once Dean was dressed again, he had stopped crying to the point that he was only whimpering into his Daddy’s shirt. Castiel gave him his pacifier, hoping it would help his boy.
“Dean doesn’t like it, so I put it back,” he said, shaking his head at the pair of them. He really didn’t see anything wrong with it.
Without saying a word, Castiel held out his free arm to his big brother. Moving closer, Michael came up beside his youngest brother, soon as he was close enough he felt Castiel grab his t-shirt pulling him into the hug. Sighing happy Michael relaxed as he hugged his baby brother, he was so happy Castiel was okay with him.
Once the movie started Castiel started to feed Dean small amounts of his lamb korma. Dean hummed at every mouth full. The rich, creamy taste made him never want it to end.
Nodding, Sam rubbed his face into Gabriel’s neck, watching anxiously from his hiding place. He held onto his Daddy as they walked up to the front door.
Dean’s heart stopped when he saw a women standing in front of him and Castiel. She looked around the same age as Castiel but she was slightly taller. She stood her distance from where Dean was, which Dean was happy about he hoped she didn’t fuss over him like the last lot he met. Thinking about the mall, Dean pressed himself closer into his Daddy there was no way he was leaving the man again.
Dean listen to his Daddy. Daddy wasn’t being mean, he couldn’t believe how he acted towards him.  Thinking about it, he had been really silly. Seeing Daddy smiling at him Dean snuggled into him. “Sorry.”
Feeling his head sting, Castiel let go of Dean’s hand to rub at the pain. With his mind fully on Dean he had forgot that he had been hurt yesterday. Feeling the scabs under his fingers he winced when he rubbed against the large bump. It was really hurting but he wasn’t going to let it bother him. He wasn’t going to let yesterday ruin today. And today he was enjoying being with his baby.
(Sorry I posted without editing, sorry for my spelling and grammar, that was so bad, I've never been a good spell but I didn't realise my grammar was so bad, I found a website that checks it all now, but please tell me if its still bad. thank you for all the kudos :-) )
“I want to go back and check something, will you come with me?” Gabriel asked, Michael looked into his brother’s grey eyes, unsure.
Leaning into his touch, Sam lay his head onto the man’s shoulder. Breathing in Gabriel’s scent of candy and coffee he started to feel calmer. He didn’t know why, but he liked being close to him.
Without waiting for Dean to say anything, Castiel lifted up his jumper. Pulling down Dean’s jeans Castiel lay them on the chair next to him with his shirt. Unsnapping the bodysuit, he pulled it up over Dean’s head, leaving him in just his diaper.
“Gabriel.” Looking up from his phone, Gabriel came out of his thoughts when he saw Castiel walking towards him pushing the stroller.
Castiel smirked. If Dean knew the power he had with those eyes of his he would probably get away with everything.
“No worries, so what can I do for you ladies?”  Crowley asked in a strong British accent with a cheeky grin.
After paying for the clothes, they headed to the massive toy store at the end of the mall. The sound of the children and other littles filled the air. Dean watched from his stroller as they all run around the store excitedly playing with all the different toys. One of the littles had caught his eye, it was a “little girl” she was wearing frilly purple dress with her long blonde hair in pigtails. She was sitting at a table on an older-looking man’s lap, playing with a doll. The man held his one of his arms around her waist while using the other to help the girl brush the doll’s hair. The man had his head close to her head whispering things, making the little girl smile. Dean couldn’t hear anything they said but he could see she was happy. Dean looked back at Castiel. Would they ever be that close, he thought.
Sam watched in amazement as Meg left the room without a word, he had never seen anyone talk to her like that before.
Opening his mouth wide Dean let Castiel put the folk in, soon as the warm syrup hit his tongue Dean hummed with delight. They tasted so good. Quickly chewing, Dean opened his mouth for more.
Castiel stood, holding Dean close, “Bye bye, honeybee. We’ll see you soon,” he said, placing a light kiss on the girl’s pink cheek.
Sighing, he lifted the shy Little up, “Samuel, I will not hurt you. I would never hurt you.” Kissing the boys cheek, Michael felt shocked with himself. He hadn’t kissed anyone like that since he was young and looking after his little brothers. Looking into Sam’s bright eyes he smiled, patting the boy on the bum.
Walking up to the small group, Gabriel watched as Samuel looked up at him with big, fox like eyes. Gabriel could feel his nerves kick in, he just couldn’t stop looking at the beautiful boy.
Michael glanced up to his brother, looking confused. “What do you need?” he said wiping his eyes with the back of his hand. He would do anything for his brothers right now, just to make things right.
Feeling another sob coming Dean clutched onto Castiel’s shirt for dear life. Suddenly he felt Castiel’s fingers under his chin. Looking up he saw his Daddy’s bright blue eyes looking back at him. “Dean, Daddy will never leave you. I would never ever get rid of you, Daddy’s heart would break if I didn’t have you, and all you did was have a tantrum which is what babies do honey, and you’ll probably do it again and Daddy will still love you.”
“Gabe?” Dean interrupted, he had been wanting to see his uncle, he really wanted to thank him for saving him.
Castiel turned to see his baby staring up at him, smiling. He quickly popped his night shirt and bottoms on. Climbing onto the bed Castiel sat next to his baby. “Are you hungry baby?” Dean nodded his head, he was looking forward to having takeaway.
Walking out of the building Gabriel got into his car. Stopping off at the nearest toy store he decided to get Dean something. He spent some time looking up at the shelves of stuffed toys nothing really stood out to him. Walking down the aisles, he past a bin full of soft rubber cars. Dean had shown interest in cars, he thought. Picking up a red, mustang-looking car Gabriel smiling to himself before he headed to the check out.
Meg looked down at the quiet boy, he looked miserable and broken, she had never seen any of the others look so mournful. For the first time in her time working, she actually felt sorry for one of the poor souls they were about to change.
“I think the toy store first, oh and then the sweet store,” Gabriel said, grinning licking his lower lip.
Seeing Hannah walk in, Castiel smiled hugging Charlie tightly. “You’re the sweetest girl in the world Charlie, but your Mama is right. Goodnight Sweetheart.” Handing Charlie over Castiel gave her kiss on the check.
“Yes, I am quite a beauty, aren’t I baby?” Castiel laughed, bouncing Dean on his lap. Dean just looked at them like they were crazy. Pointing to the Lion King, Dean snuggled into his Daddy.
‘Piss off’ Castiel mouthed to his brother. Hearing Dean laugh behind him, Castiel grinned to himself. He loved Dean’s laugh.
“He’s fine, he’s so lovely Cas. You’re going to love him, he’s really looking forward to seeing Dean,” Gabriel said, sounding hopeful.
“You’re not buying two cars Casey, you’re buying the Q3,” Gabriel laughed, “No, I am buying the Impala.”
Castiel was loving how happy his baby looked, his boy was so cute as he waited with his mouth wide open for more.
Still with his arms wrapped around Sam’s neck, Dean peeked at Gabriel to see the man smiling at him.
“When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of neon light, that split the night and touched the sound of silence.”
“..ye..” Dean said pushing the nipple out with his tongue. Scoffing Castiel put the bottle down on the floor next to the recliner, his little boy seemed to really like watching his show. He didn’t think Dean would enjoy watching such a young age TV show. Lowering his legs. Castiel stood with Dean in his arms.
“Okay, you’re right. I won’t say anything,” she said. Nodding to each other Gabriel and Hannah decided to leave it at that.
Michael moved to sit next to Gabriel on the floor, “Do you really think that low of me Gabriel? I might want our company to be the best and I know I’ve been putting work first for a very...very long time, but I’m still your big brother and I’m always your brother before I’m anything else. And I know what people think of me and I don’t care really, but I never thought you and Cas would think of we like they do. I never wanted my brothers to hate me so much.”
Once the food was finished Gabriel got up to take the plates away. Looking down at Dean, Gabriel smiled at seeing his nephew. The poor boy had his tired eyes blinking heavily at the screen, trying to keep them open.
Feeling a tap on his chin, Castiel looked down to see two big tried green eyes looking up at him. Seeing Dean staring up at him upside down with his bottle hanging between his teeth, Castiel chuckled to himself thinking how cute his baby was, “Okay baby, finish your bottle. Daddy will sing.”
Seeing the shy young boy hide into Gabriel, Castiel smiling at how cute his new nephew was. He was very pretty, just like his big brother. Noticing Sam’s long legs he could tell that he was taller than his Dean.
Dean listened to his so-called Uncle. He did sound upset, but Gabriel had been so mad at him, he had left Dean all alone in his crib. Gabriel had every right to be mad, he had hurt Daddy, but Daddy said it was an accident. Dean could feel his head start to hurt, he was so confused.
Smiling to himself Gabriel hugged the boy close, he was going to be a Daddy, he couldn’t believe it.    He was buzzing with excitement.
Soon as the brothers made eye contact, both Dean and Sam stared at each other in silence. Sam could feel his heart beating through his ears. It was Dean, his Dean. Looking his big brother up and down he didn’t know what to do. Dean was dressed in full body suit with a pacifier clipped to the neck. He looked just like the younger babies back at the hospital.
“My name is Gabriel,” Gabriel held his hand out, “Sam. That’s a cool name, how about Sammy? Can I call you Sammy?”
Coming out of his himself, Dean could feel something on his face. It was so warm and soft. Leaning into it he started to feel calmer, and opening his eyes, he recognised the arms wrapped around him. Glancing up he found a pair of teary blue eyes looking down at him. He knew those eyes, he loved those eyes.
“Deany, I promise this will be nice. Look, I’ll even try it.” Putting the nipple in his mouth and drinking a small bit, Castiel let out a hum. “Ohh, it is very nice.”
“Yes, very yucky. Never again.” Castiel shook his head, remembering the horrid taste, and threw the jars in the bin. Dean smiled, glad Daddy thought the same as him.
Walking into the living room they find Gabriel had moved all the cushions and blankets onto the floor, making it all cosy around the coffee table.
“Right Cassie, I need to explain what I have done. Baby Dean here is pretty much just like a normal baby. He can’t walk or talk because of the muscle and vocal relaxant. It’ll take seven to nine months for the muscle to completely wear off but it’s fine, if you want to work on him crawling or to walk you can. The vocal takes about five to six months but he can make noises, he’ll have to wear diapers he has no control anymore.”
Dean gave a slight sniff, feeling his stomach flutter at hearing Daddy’s voice. He knew he hadn’t been in his crib for long but he had missed his Daddy. “..sorry...I..I..sorry Dada.”
He really like Gabriel. He was funny, and always smelled like candyfloss. But a small part of him was still worried that this was too good to be true and it would all end when they went to see Dean.
“You’re wrong there, Daddy,” Dean thought. smiling behind his pacifier. Shaking his head, Dean giggled. wiggling himself more into the man’s body.
It all change really when their father died. Michael took over the company, with constantly working and business away, Michael had just become more distant from his family.
Once he was done changing Dean, Gabriel picked up his teary nephew and placed him down into his crib. Laying Dean down he turned on the shining star mobile above the boys head.
“What makes you think you can just take him. He has not been though the mind treatment and you haven’t been through the right channels for adoption.”
Castiel watched his baby, he was happy to see his boy so excited, this was defiantly one of his brother’s best ideas.
“You’re very welcome Dean. Enjoy your cars gentlemen,” Crowley smiled, shaking each man’s hand, including Dean.
Feeling Daddy pick him up, Dean came out of his thoughts. He looked down at himself to find that Daddy had him dressed.
Sam looked up at the man, he didn’t want to spoil the mood. “Like you,” Sam said, giving a shy grin.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Okay then, let’s get going. I think we’ll order takeaway tonight celebrating Dean getting his first car, what do you think Daddy?” Gabriel asked, tickling Dean under his chin.
Feeling a weight on his forehead Dean stretched, making himself comfortable under his covers. Peeking through his lashes, sucking lazily on his pacifier Dean smiled, falling back asleep feeling that happiest he had felt.
Opening his mouth, Dean started to drink down the warm vanilla milk, this was different to how he usually had his bottle. It felt nice being in his Daddy’s bed, he just wished Daddy was here with him. Having Gabriel was okay, but he wasn’t his Daddy.
“Hey Honey,” he smiled, picking the small girl up into a big hug. “Thank you for giving me the best cuddles, I feel a lot better. Are you going back to bed?”
Dean didn’t bother responding. He knew he couldn’t do anything to stop them, in the time he had on his own he just thought of his Daddy, trying to remember every detail of his face, his beautiful blue eyes, his loving smile, in a small hope he could remember him somehow.
“Dean, baby look at me,” Dean shook his head. His mind was being so cruel, he thought he could hear Uncle Gabriel.
“Hey Honey, you okay? Can’t you sleep?” she asked, glancing back at Castiel, who was still staring into space. He hadn’t notice Charlie come in to the room.
“Yeah..Dada...” Dean smiled pushing away his bottle. Trying to sit up, Dean whined when Michael sat him more comfortably on his lap. He needed to get his gift for Sam. “Dada..” he moaned, making grabby hands towards the stuffed dog sitting next to Gabriel.
Glancing over Castiel saw Hannah was looking away from them, clearly trying not to laugh. His baby on the other hand looked at him nervously.
“Because when they look at you they’ll see my gorgeous baby boy, that’s why. And you’ll be with your Daddy, who will always keep you safe,” Castiel smiled. Holding Dean’s face in his hands he kisses his little boy’s forehead.
Sighing, Gabriel tried to hide the disappointment on his face. Picking the boy up he walked over to on to the benches near the shoe area. Placing the boy on his lap he watched Sam stare down at his feet like they were the most interesting thing in the world.
Castiel wasn’t sure what he was; more nervous about the fact that he and his older brother had kidnapped Dean, or the fact that he was doing to be a Daddy.
Walking up the stairs, Castiel walked into the bathroom. Sitting on the edge of the tub with Dean on his lap he put in the plug. Turning on the water he added a small bit of lavender bubble bath, knowing it would help his boy relax and get sleepy. Turning to Dean, Castiel lowered him down onto the floor. Laying Dean down he started to remove his baby’s overalls and onesie, seeing Dean in just his diaper made him look so vulnerable and cute. Removing Dean’s wet diaper Castiel lifted him up and placed him in the warm water.
Castiel sighed looking at the bowl, he really didn’t want to do it but he had to convince his boy. Placing a spoon full in his mouth, Castiel held it on his tongue. He couldn’t really give a name to what it tasted like, all he knew was it was disgusting. Quickly moving to the sink he spat it out. Turning round he hears everyone laughing loudly.
Sighing, Dean turned away from him again. “Now, none of that pretty boy. I just want to know my precious baby is healthy, and plus Daddy did say we are having a check up so that means I am too.”
Once Dean had calmed down, Castiel walked into the kitchen to grab one of the ready made bottles in the fridge and placed it into the warmer. As he waited he checked his phone to find no messages from Gabriel.
Seeing Dean nod a little Castiel could tell he boy wasn’t listening. Sighing to himself he left his baby, feeling a bit disappointed, he had really hoped Dean would have wanted to play with his toys with him. It was something Castiel had always wanted to do with his own little but he guessed he’ll have to hope Dean might want to do that later.
Taking Dean from Gabriel, Castiel kissed his boy’s cheek. It was clear to Castiel that Dean knew if he used calling him Daddy Castiel would do anything, he was really wrapped around Dean’s finger, but he didn’t care, he loved his baby.
But seeing his new family, the way they laughed and played, was nice. It made him feel warm and happy.
Hannah looked down at Dean, who had his eyes on his Daddy. “Bye bye Dean, we’ll see you soon.” Rubbing her hand across Dean’s soft brown hair she placed a kiss on his crown. Dean scrunch up his nose. Everyone was kissing him. He wasn’t sure he liked that, he didn’t mind Castiel doing it but it felt different when Daddy kissed him.
“I’m sorry baby, I shouldn’t have left you,” he whispered, kissing the back of Dean’s head. whimpering, Dean rested his head on Castiel’s shoulder. He was just happy to be back in the man’s arms.
“Hey my Bumblebee, did you have a good nap?” Picking his boy up, Castiel checked Dean’s diaper to find it still dry. Sitting down in the rocking chair, they sat quietly letting Dean wake more.
On the other side of the room Dean saw the changing table and wardrobe. The table was the same colour as the crib, with a light blue mattress on the top. The table was fully stocked, with diaper and changing surplus. At the other side of the window was a soft, sofa-rocking chair. It looked big enough for two to sit in and be comfortable. Hugging his bee close Dean felt tears in his eyes. This was his room. He had his own room! He knew having a crib for a bed was part of being a baby, but he didn’t mind that. Anything was better than the cold concrete floor he had slept on for the past three years.
Lifting up the rail Gabriel sighed. He felt slightly sorry for the boy. He did look like a crying mess, but he was still mad that Castiel was hurt, so Dean would have to wait till everyone had calmed down. “You can say sorry after your nap.” Turning on the baby monitor, Gabriel walked out the room, shutting the door behind him.
Dean shook his head. There was no way he was letting Daddy put that in his mouth. Dean looked over to Gabriel pouting. Why couldn’t the man make him the pancakes again? They were awesome.
Coming out of his thoughts, Gabriel rolled his eyes at the same question his older brother kept asking. “For the last time, Yes. It’s fine, you’re a part of this family, so you’re coming,” he said sternly. This was making him feel really odd, having to be serious with his normally up tight big brother. “Plus, Sam wants you to come, right Sammy?”
Shutting the door behind him Castiel let out a low sigh. Standing on the spot for a moment he looked down at his baby, “I’m so sorry Dean,” he whispered to himself.
“Would you like that bud? Then your car will stand out and be the best looking car in the whole town,” Gabriel grinned to Crowley for his quick thinking. Seeing the baby nod his head everyone relaxed, glad that there were no tantrums.
“Deany..shh it’s okay, I’m still here.” Lifting Dean into his arms quickly, he started to gently rock his baby to prevent him crying. “Daddy’s not going anywhere,” he added patting Dean’s diaper.
Taking a sip he hummed in delight at the strong rich taste. “Ah Betty, I wish you would marry me. I couldn’t live without your amazing coffee.”
It had been a few hours since Gabriel had taken Dean. While pacing the room Castiel hears the door open and heared crying coming towards him. Seeing Gabriel walk in with Dean wrapped up in the blue blanket his heart skipped; his baby looked so small in his brothers arms.
“Uncle Castiel nice?” Sam whispered shyly. He knew that Castiel was Daddy’s little brother and Dean’s Daddy, but he didn’t know anything about him. He might not be as nice as Gabriel or Michael. He might be mean and not let him see Dean after today.
“Of course not Hannah, we really should have told you more of what was happening. I’m always happy to see my special girl,” Castiel smiled, winking up at the curly hair girl and making her giggle.
Sam looked up at Gabriel unsure, looking the man up and down he nodded his head giving Gabriel a small smile he shook Gabriel’s hand while still playing with his teddy bear.
Turning his attention back to the boys, Castiel rubbed his hand across Dean’s belly making Dean glance up at him. “Baby, can you let go of Sammy’s hair for a moment? Daddy needs to stand up for a second.”
“Ahh yes, he had a cheap looking gold 1970’s Lincoln Continental.” Hearing a giggle, both men saw Dean snickering behind his pacifier. “...Anyway, what I was getting at is, would you help Daddy find a car, bud? Maybe in a few days me and you can drag your Daddy car shopping, make him realise he has to drive his boy around in style not make you walk everywhere.”
“Oh you’re a big boy hum?” Nodding his head, Sam looked pleased. Gabriel smirked at how cute he looked. Turning the boy to be cradled in his arms Gabriel laughed when Sam squeaked at the quick movement. “Are you sure you’re a big boy?” he asked, grinning at his boy.
“I’ll see you soon Castiel. You take care of that cutie and don’t worry about work, I’ll cover for you. I’ll arrange for you to be on holiday, god knows you are due one,” Hannah said, picking up her bag.
Plating up one of the omelettes Gabriel cut it up before bring it over to the table. “Hope you like cheese omelettes kiddo,” Gabriel said, giving a side smile. Seeing Dean’s green eyes look up at him sadly Gabriel could tell the small boy was still scared of him.
“Uncle Cas…” Hearing a small voice behind him, Castiel turned around to see Charlie walking up to him with her arms out for a hug.
Walking in, Castiel locked the door to the private toilet with a changing table. Placing Dean down he grabbed the diaper bag he started to unsnap Deans overalls.
Dean lay still, letting Daddy moved his limbs into the soft fleecy fabric. Close to sleep Dean let out a wide yawn, making his eyes water.
“I’ll sort out Dean. Go wait for me, you’ll need help getting the glass out,” Gabriel said as he unclipped the tray. “Why was Dean having a tantrum?” he asked, lifting the boy onto his hip.
Rolling his eyes, Michael rubbed his hand over his chin. He knew very well the lengths Gabriel will go to keep his family safe.
“Yeah honey, your Uncle Gabriel has adopted Sam as his little, he didn’t want to leave him in that hospital.”
Both Castiel and Gabriel watched their boys with tears in their eyes. Its couldn’t have gone any better.
Castiel scoffed to himself. It was clear his big brother had fallen in love with being an Uncle. Maybe, just maybe, he would be a good Daddy to someone.
“..Say..orry...o..Gabe,” Dean said, using his eyes to point to the man sitting behind his little brother.
Gabriel bit into his bottom lip, holding back his own tears. He had to be strong for his baby brother. “I’ll get him back,” he said hugging Castiel tightly, he was going to get him back.
Sam pecked from his hiding stop, seeing the anger look on Meg’s face, he thought she was going to snatch him out of his new Daddy’s arm, but looking up at the said man and his Uncle they had scarier faces then she did.
Nodding his head again, Castiel took his hand away to wrap it back around his baby. Leaning in Gabriel kissed Dean’s forehead then Castiel’s. “I’ll see you soon.”
Grinning proudly, Castiel lifted his baby from his brother’s arms, “Thank you Bumblebee, tell mean old Granddaddy to leave your poor Daddy alone.” Kissing Dean’s check, Castiel smirked to Michael as he turned to leave the nursery. Seeing Michael rolling his eyes, Castiel laughed happy to have his family back both old and new.
Frowning at his Daddy, Sam started to rip at the cardboard, he wanted to show Dean his new track now.
Seeing Castiel frown, Gabriel knew Castiel didn’t want to hear this. “Cas, Michael saw us in the high street, he was going to come see you and just talk, he wanted to just talk. But he made the mistake of talking to Lilith about it and she went behind his back and called the bouncers.”
“Hello, my name is Michael Novak and this is my brother Gabriel, we are the leading benefactors of the AB Program, we have come because their has been a misunderstanding involving a Little that has just been taken in.”
Yawning, Dean blinked up at his Daddy. He still felt sleepy. He wanted to go back to sleep. Closing his eyes Dean snuggled into Castiel’s shirt, happy at being held by his Daddy.
“Hello there Dean, it is very nice to meet you.” Even though the boy wouldn’t looking at her Hannah smiled encase the boy changed his mind. “Where is Gabriel anyway?” she asked.
When he woke from his nap, he could hear his Daddy yelling, as he opened his eyes he saw a large muscular man standing over him. Screaming at the top of his lungs, he tried so hard to fight the man from picking him up. Kicking and punching as much as he could, it didn’t stop the man walking down the stairs taking him away.
Castiel stomach shivered when he felt Dean touch his skin. Looking down, he watched what Dean was doing, happy that Dean was distracted.
“Okay Sammy, you can talk freely with me now,” Gabriel said. Smiling at the boy he could tell Sam was a bit weary of him. “So, can you tell me if you remember anything from before?”
Dean eyed the high-chair. It did look comfortable, but he didn’t want to sit in it, he wanted to stay with Daddy. Feeling his bum on the soft cushion Dean held onto his bee with one hand and the other on to Castiel’s shirt of dear life, “..nu..”
“Oh I’m sorry. She looks very soft,” Hannah patted the bee’s head. Looking up at Castiel she pointed her eyes to his hand. Catching on, Castiel pulled Dean’s fingers off of him, and as soon as he was free Hannah moved to be in front of Dean fully. “Does your bumblebee have a name?” she said, keeping the boy distracted.
“Shall we go find your uncle? He’ll make my baby boy feel better.” Laying Dean down in his stroller, Castiel handed him his bee before wrapping his blue blanket around him. Letting out a displeased moan Dean snuggled into his blanket while Castiel said goodbye to the doctor. He was just glad it was over and he wouldn’t have to come back in a very long time.
“..Da..Da..” Dean said. Frowning, he buried his head under his Daddy’s chin. His Daddy didn’t need to apologize, it wasn’t his fault. “..no..Dada...”
“What are you thinking about baby?” coming out of his head, Dean shyly looked at Castiel, giving him a small smile.
“Okay then, I’m heading out.” Bending down Gabriel rubbed the top of Dean’s head with his thumb. “Goodnight kiddo, you be a good baby now.” Seeing Dean lean into his touch Gabriel smiled at his new nephew.
“I need you here so you can open the back door when I bring your baby over. We need to be quick so be ready.”
“I’m joking Daddy, I have two Disney movies here,” Gabriel held up two dvd boxes. “What one do you want to watch Deano? We had Lion King or Beauty and the Beast. Daddy is the star of the last one,” Gabriel smirked at his brother.
Closing his eyes again Dean hoped he was just dreaming, that he wasn’t being treated like a baby. Feeling something cold touching his bum check Dean flinched, thinking this man was going to hurt him.
Lifting his head up Castiel grinned, “Ice-cream? Daddy did promise Ice-cream, but first we need to have a check up.”
Dean was feeling pretty awful, he was tired and hungry. His eyes were stinging from all the crying he was doing. He was alone just like before. Even though he was comfortable in his soft blankets he was wishing he was cuddled up with his Daddy, but he guessed that wasn’t going to happen anymore. They were probably arranging to have Dean taken away because he was so bad. Feeling his eyes start to water Dean groaned. He didn’t think he had any tears left but just thinking of leaving made him feel even worse.
Hearing Dean let out a groan from his knee, Michael carefully lifted him up to lay across his lap facing him. “Aww little angel, have you run out of tears hmm.”
Sighing Dean nodded. If Daddy said it was okay, then he’d stay as he is for now. And if he was being truthful with himself, he didn’t want to stop being Castiel’s baby. Castiel has been the best thing that had ever happened to him.
Castiel could feel his heart against his chest as he paced up and down Hannah’s hallway, looking at the front door. He knew he was working himself up, but he just wanted his baby. He needed to feel Dean in his arms to know in his mind that Dean was back and safe again.
Taking out his phone Gabriel sighed to himself, he really didn’t know what to do. Holding his phone to his ear he walked out of the toy store to sit on a bench outside.
Dean just stared at this man holding him, he couldn’t stop looking into the older man’s bright blue eyes. They were sparkling, which Dean surprisingly found comforting. Sucking on the pacifier, Dean didn’t try to move, he didn’t feel like the man was going to hurt him but he didn’t want to risk it by trying to escape.
“Deany, I think I know how we can get Uncle Gabe back. I know you might not like it but I know for a fact he will hate it,” Dean looked him in the eye a bit unsure but his boy soon nods his head to listen to his idea.
