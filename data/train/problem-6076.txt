Bhim laughs. “Well, when you come to us and you ask for help, how can we possibly say no? Especially after everything that you have taught Pavitr.”
“Definitely,” Steve says, cheerfully, and embraces her tight, letting her go on her way with her date.
Tony’s rushing forward long before the men are actually dead, scooping the children up into his arms, clutching at them tight, and that part of him that he’s missing, the sliver that’s been carved from his soulmate, he finally finds where it’s been hiding, and he can feel it throbbing against his heart now.
The album tracks Steve through the ages, from newborn to proper baby to toddler to a pre-schooler. Tony and Natasha and Pepper feature in the photos every now and then, along with their friends Bucky and Rhodey, who moved away when they were in elementary school because their parents got jobs elsewhere.
“Second, I spoke to your assistant, Pepper, and it looks like she’s actually been worried about your mental health, so she’s glad you were taking some time to rest today. She even gave us strict instructions to tie you down to the bed if you tried to do any work, and then, made it very clear that if we
“That was… that was just a kink, I mean-” Steve flounders for words.
“You are the love of my life,” she says, her voice tender and soft. “I will never love anyone the way that I love you.”
“Did you find him?” Steve asks, quietly.
“Steve gave me the necklace. He bought it for me. I tried very hard to convince him against it, but you know him. He’s-”
He finds himself in the middle of streets, listening to the slightest sound, but there’s nothing, not even a dog barking. He turns and looks down between the houses, deep into a dark alley. He goes deeper, deeper into the shadows, and he pauses every now and then to make sure that he isn’t missing anything, a knot of tension winding in his belly, as though the killer will come screaming out at him at any second.
The man looks up at him, the darkness of the bar previously hiding his golden hair. His milk-white skin in a place where that would definitely not have gone amiss, considering there are more white men than Indians here at this time of night.
“No TV, no phone, forget the homework,” Jarvis says, sternly.
It would have been more difficult, he supposes.
Or are they a hotel couple? Does she invite him for a cheese platter and a champagne bucket in a four-star hotel room that smells like new, breakable things and tastes like opulence and they have sex on a million-thread-count sheets and Steve feels like he’s in the lap of luxury without the tiresome existence of adulthood and marriage and children to spoil his fun? Tony could give him that, if that’s what he wanted. He fails to see any possibility where Natasha Romanoff could buy Steve luxury that Tony, being one of the wealthiest people in the world, could not. Or maybe it’s a cheap motel room, with the cockroaches and the semen stains all over the walls, a Dateline special in its making, where they feel as tawdry as the sin they’re committing on dirty sheets, watching grainy porn on the television set that hasn’t been seen in a household since the early 90s?
Steve’s shoulders slump. “Oh,” he murmurs.
, because they’re allowed to, because society doesn’t really punish them for it.
Tony turns in the direction of a familiar voice and watches, with a slowly furrowing brow, as a beautiful redhead on the arm of a handsome man approaches their table, the redhead’s face lighting up.
“That’s not fair,” Steve repeats, his voice gentle.
The rage burns through him hot and fast, as he imagines his own children, his sweet, kind babies, who like Dora the Explorer, at the hand of someone like the man that James had killed the first night that they met.
“No, not until you tell me what happened tonight,” Steve says, stubbornly.
A fist comes for his head before he can even protest, and he sees nothing but black.
But they
“Why not?”
Steve narrows his eyes. “Seriously?” he says, flatly.
isn’t the one who answers it.
“Neither Steve or I wanted to hurt you, Sam. We… we never wanted any of this to touch you or touch Wanda, and you don’t… God, it makes me miserable that Wanda is lying here because of us. I love her too.”
He throws a switch on his console, and the vita ray reactors come online. Finally, he turns the power dial, and a piercing whine fills the room. On one of the gauges on Tony’s console, the needle begins to climb.
question.”
“I’m not a fucking snitch, and I… I’ll always protect you, James,” he swears. “I don’t care if we’re not… if we’re not anything anymore. You’re still… fuck, James, you’re still my friend; you were my friend before you were anything else. I’ll always protect you. You’re one of my
He knocks on the door to Wanda’s room, chewing on his lower lip, and Sam looks up from Wanda’s bedside, from where he’d been clutching at her hand, smoothing his knuckles back and forth across her forearm.
“Tell you about James?” Tony clarifies.
Tony bats his hands away at first, bares his teeth as if to ward James off; he’s always been one to dislike the touch of someone during comfort, a lone wolf when he can’t help the emotion welling up inside him like the first rain in the desert, and James is no different, even if they have history.
It’s always his day.
“Yeah, well, you have skill, but I have smarts, and I also have the ability to control every country’s weapons’ system and fire nuclear bombs at will,” he drawls.
“But your father left for a few weeks on a business trip, and you were still scared, still terrified, still being hurt, so it wasn’t him. I thought, I went through everyone that we knew, even your mother, Steve, and it wasn’t any of them. That left Obadiah. So, I came to you, and you were in tears, and I asked you if it was Obadiah doing this, hurting you, and you nodded. You told me it was him, and I told you that I would make everything better.”
Tony hits him a third time. “I am not a fucking prize,” he growls, his eyes flashing hard. “You can’t
“And he told me to bring the kids with me, and that he’d raise them as his own. So, yeah, that’s why I know that the kids aren’t going to be a deal breaker for him.”
“Then, kiss me,” he says, softly.
Steve’s jaw flexes, and he clambers to his feet, stretches his hand out for Tony to take. “Okay, then, let’s go and talk to her.”
you it wouldn’t work.”
“I…” Tony flounders for words. “You can’t ask me that, James. You can’t.
you; they might have… they might have made you exactly like me; they might have shoved you in that fucking chair and removed everything that made you
“So, you didn’t tell him that I was a friend who’d seen you naked,” James says, slowly.
Steve laughs. “You love it. Don’t lie.” He pauses. “And if you’re still talkin’ so much, clearly I’m not doin’ this right.”
It wasn’t important.
“If he loved you, he wouldn’t be shacking up with his secretary,” James replies, not unkindly.
Steve clears his throat. “I just… I remember it was a little while ago? They had just turned four. And they were playing, and I was at home one day, and I was at the bottom of the stairs. I was watching them, and then, Peter was falling down the stairs, and I… I didn’t know how to react. I was just watching, and then, he was on the ground and crying and he was clutching at his arm, and I didn’t know what to do,” he says, almost stunned by his own reaction. “It was broken, I knew that, but I didn’t… I didn’t know how to react, what to do, and then, Tony was there. JARVIS must have called him – that’s our artificial intelligence, he runs the house – and he was there, and he was just… reacting. He reacted. He swept Peter up into his arms, and Mouse was rushing down and he had Mouse in the other arm, and he was in the car, and I was following like a zombie, and he was comforting Peter and getting him to stop crying and making him laugh, and all I could do is drive. Peter was doing everything else, and he didn’t even stop. He didn’t need to stop. He got us into the emergency room and distracted Peter as the doctor set his arm and gave him the cast and he was the first to write on it, and I was just… useless. I was useless.”
Finally, Steve signs all of the autographs, and it’s Tony’s turn.
What Steve does next surprises him, though.
“Is that why he doesn’t spend any time with you?” James asks, voice practically a taunt. “Because he’s putting himself between you and the kids and anything that comes for you? For fuck’s sake, Tony,” he says, full of derision, “don’t you have any pride?”
Tony finds himself leaning in, curling up against his side.
HYDRA, so I justified it to myself, and he asked me not to make a scene. Even pointed me to the guy’s phone, which had some…” he closes his eyes, “let’s just say that the guy that James killed liked kids, kids younger than ten.”
“That’s all you need to be a good father,” James says, confidently. “Which is something that your husband doesn’t know about.”
Natasha, though, huffs out a laugh. “No, no, I’m not.”
But the cell is now deserted, save for Natasha, who is sleeping peacefully.
. This is where Krishna lived.”
“I’ll still hold
“Okay, okay,” he says, roughly, blinking away tears.
Steve’s fingers are tracing absent, random patterns over his pectorals, over his lean abdomen, before they start plucking at the waistband to his sweats.
“That wasn’t so bad,” he comments.
James sighs heavily through the phone. “Look, don’t worry about it. I can manage-”
Steve pulls out the transponder, which is shot to pieces. “Sorry, couldn’t call my ride,” he says, slyly.
kids. And clearly, they don’t. So, I’m furious, and I’m going to go after them, and I’m going to bring our kids home, without a scratch on them, because I will
Tony narrows his eyes. “You believe in anything?”
Tony straddles him. “It’s nothing too hard or anything. I'm just going to...
“I got your back, jack,” Tony says, with a grin.
Tony wishes he were an alpha, wishes he were strong enough, powerful enough to take up a sword, to run Obadiah through and to sit on the seat that was once his father’s, have all of those alphas who looked down on him, on their knees before him, kissing his hand.
sorry about Barnes and Sam,” he murmurs, nuzzling at Steve’s throat. “I know you don’t… I know you don’t talk about them, and I think you don’t talk about them because you think that I don’t want to talk about them, or that I won’t approve if you
His throat is raw and swollen on the inside; his eyes feel like they’ll fall out of their sockets at any point in time, and each breath feels like swallowing a lit candle.
Both of their gazes travel towards Tony, who’s leaning against the wet bar, completely silent, an odd state of being for him.
“Because someone cut her, while I watched.”
“Okay, get out of here.”
“Would you, in the future, feel comfortable telling Steve when you are happy, when you feel neglected, unloved, unwanted, when you have suspicions the same way you did before?”
“Yeah, I’m sure she told you that.”
Basically, a horror show.
Tony turns shock cold. “What are you talking about?”
Tony’s heart is pounding in his chest. “I don’t know how to believe anything you say anymore.”
, because frankly, he was pretty shit when they first met, a complete and total virgin and without an inkling about what he liked in bed, but he had saved him for ever having to suffer idiots like that on top of him anymore, with the brief, fleeting hope that he might come from it.
“You’re right.” Tony pauses. “It doesn’t mean much.” He clears his throat. “Good night, Jarvis.”
Grant continues to accost him, here and there, his lusts and wants clearly not having been slaked with one night.
“Hi,” Tony replies, with an unsure tongue, because he’s not quite sure what she’s doing here, standing on his doorstep.
“I can probably make it so that you’ll avoid a court martial,” Phillips offers, ignoring Tony.
Steve sends him a sardonic smile. “You thought I’d jump at the chance?”
“So, how did your husband fit into it all?” James asks, curiously.
“Tony!” Steve shouts and then, starts coughing.
“I’m coming. Just a moment!” he calls back after them.
James narrows his eyes, peers closer. “East Colden Avenue,” he drawls.
. Sometimes, he expects me to give him… him orders, and his arm hurts, the metal arm, and it hurts him, and he’s scared to get help, like he thinks he’s not supposed to be hurting. He refers to it as
Maushmi slides to her feet, stretching out her hands in front of her.
He knows the bracelet. He gave it to James years and years ago, wrapped it around his wrist and everything.
“Oh, jeez,” Steve mutters.
“I was sitting at the bar on my own and this idiot frat boy with his collar turned up like a douchebag came up to me and started hitting on me. Not even nice flirting, you know; it was the
Behind him, the starburst is blazing, and then, it’s suddenly over. He makes his way back to the settlement, which is suddenly ablaze, and the fire has quickly spread to stacks of supplies on either side.
I should have told you, but you, I have pictures of you at this guy’s apartment. I know that you visited him constantly. I know that he was in our house, when no one was at home, and I know that he met the kids. I know you helped him get rid of SHIELD’s bugs. I know you were helping him avoid us, and you know what the worst thing is? You’ve fucked this guy before. You told me that. You’ve had sex with him before, and what, I’m supposed to believe that the two of you haven’t rekindled your passion for each other since he showed up again? That you were just helping him out of the goodness of your fucking heart?”
“As you wish sir” the voice answers him and the iron armor takes a detour to the big green monster
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hi, nice to meet you Captain America" he gets closer with his hands on his back "You know? For the guy Tasha is infatuated with, I was expecting something... better” he says and Steve remembers, Tasha! He and Maya were after her
“So what your dreams are about?” she looks at Bruce apollogetically, she doesn’t like spilling the contents of her subconcious, not sober at least, especially when most of her nightmares diverges to Howard at some point. And she’s definetely not telling her new family about the extent of dear old dad abuse, bad enough was that Rhodney knew, she was always careful with that information, hell not even Aunt Peggy, Aunt Angie nor the Hollowing uncles knew about it, that was how good the Stark family was at hiding their dirt. She sends a pointed ‘
“Right, right, exactly” she thinks for a minute
“Oh god! Steve!” she screams, hisses because damn her leg hurts “A little help here!”
“Yeah, Aldrich Killian” Steve thinks about why the name sounds familiar, he believes he heard it when Tasha was talking with Pepper, still, he has to get Coulson to run ID’s, for now, he focuses on getting to the hotel, on one piece preferably
' Steve thinks
“Well, so I run his credentials. I make him. Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in... where were we in ‘06? the science conference?”
“I’m fine, I’m just.... sorry, I gotta split, I’ll call you platypus” Rhodey takes a step back as Tasha gets up and flies away, she needs time to process the fact that maybe she is not quite over the New York Battle as she originally thought
“It’s Clint’s fault” Nat deadpans
Natasha Stark is a genius, a patient and strategic woman who doesn’t do anything by pure impulse (Rhodey calls bullshit) so it’s all in her plans when she flies firstly to her tower in New York, despite what everybody else would say about being dangerous with the possibility of Loki being there, she has to change her suit to a more functional, less turbine damaged armor after all, so she is actually not doing something reckless and unnecessary, (shut up Rhodes).
“Well, my repulsors aren't working correctly so I’ll have to walk to him, we have to find Steve, quickly” Tasha explains the situation briefly before closing the faceplate again and start running a bit off due to the armor with both Widow and Hawkeye taking care of the remaining guards; her phone rings and she answers from inside the suit
“What are you doing?”
“Yeah”
”What? That this was somehow their fault? Captain America saved my life, wherever any of them are, I wanna say thank you”
“How is it that you believed her to be legal? She barely even looks legal now and she’s 23!!” Steve sounds completely outraged
“Well, I guess that leaves with a decision to make, we can either save the president or Steve, we can't do both”
“Tasha... the Captain isn’t wrong not trusting me, I can’t control it after all” Bruce also looks appalled by Tasha’s sudden sadness, she looks at him with a determined look
She mutters under her breath and hits lightly her arm a few times before doing the same movement, this time a whirring is heard and one of the gauntles fly to her attaching itself to her arm and extending, along with a part of the armor that acomodates in her shoulder. She turns to another table and tosses her right arm in that direction, the other gauntlet flies to her as well, she laughs delighted ordering her electronic butler to send all the other parts to her. She lifts her leg to welcome one of them, she looks smug until the helmet crashes with a glass protecting a suit, the others fly in every direction. Soon she is getting ambush by her own invention as it attaches itself to her, the one in the back hurts a bit and makes her go down, but before she falls face first she stabilizes her body with the repulsors, she tells JARVIS to cool it down a little bit, and after the chest plate is in place the only thing left is the face plate. She coos at her metal piece and habor to take it, she lands with a bad-ass pose, inside the helmet comes to life and the interface is shown
“Move aside Tash, I’m going to get you” he says taking a jumping stand
“Yeah? How many of them are we talking about?”
A.K.A: the third most memorable bar fight on Tasha's life
The battle keeps on going, everyone is fighting with no exception, Steve is against Killian fiercely, both serums on the test, Clint is almost out of arrows and has to engage into physical fight from time to time since the damn EXTREMIS’ users are fast and get inside his range almost every five minutes; he doesn’t have visual of any of his friends, so he just hope they are still on one piece, he knows that Nat is okay at least
“But you can control it...” he quietly says, a little appalled by what the kid had to suffer so young
"I don't know Tash, you tell me..."
“You didn’t come here because I bat my eyelashes at you” she deadpans. Tasha looks at them surprised, Nat flirted with Bruce? She sooo needed that story, ‘
“Told you” Nat smugly says at Clint’s groan
Tasha Stark is back on the track minutes later
“Howard?” what does his old friend and father of the genius has to do with anything?
“Guys....” Black widow calls in warning of the increasing enemies
The music snaps him from his musings, it's a slow melody that gives him the perfect excuse to do what he planned all day, he walks to the group and politely interrupts
“Miss, we have more incoming” JARVIS informs her ending just a tiny bit of her goofy mood, the things keep coming and it's annoying
“I used to go to SHIELD headquarters when I was a kid.... an actual kid” she adds feeling Steve’s disbelief, a soft smile appearing in her features “Sometimes I’d be with uncle Nick, sometimes Phil would take care of me while Howard and uncle Nick worked” her eyes looks far away, lost in the memories “Then, after Afganistan, he looked out for me, took care of Obediah’s death and the whole Iron man ordeal” she looks back at Steve “He really is a nice guy” her smile turns fond and she chuckles “When I was a girl we used to bond over who the biggest fan of Captain America was, it was really a sight to behold, just imagine a 30 something-year-old man passionately arguing why he was Captain’s America number 1 fan to a 5-year-old” she explains and starts laughing, which prompts an amused smile from Steve, he then remembers what Coulson told him earlier when they arrived at the Hellicarrier
?” Tasha raises an eyebrow in a silent question “Don’t even try to pretend, you scared the hell out of us last time with your screams, and I know for a fact there’s a reason you are refusing to close your eyes for more than 10 minutes, so who is gonna be? Me or Clint? I would add Bruce but we know how moody he gets if he don’t rest well...” Banner’s grateful for her not mentioning how posible is to hulk-up if he cuddles with Tash in a bad night “And I don’t trust you at all to sleep with Rogers” the soldier slightly blushes
“Look... I brought you damn file, you take it and go” she pushes a bunch of papers towards her “Whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it” Tasha eyes her curiously
“I surely hope not” she deadpans and Rhodes snorts, that’s just like her
“This boss of yours... does he have a name?”
“Yeah, sure, just gonna try and get my beak wet real quick, you know what I mean” she winks stepping outside
“He’s got to heat the cube to a hundred and twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier” Banner answers with a deep thinking expression, Tasha looks at him trying to not let her fangirl tendencies show, but still unable to suppress the exciting glint in her eyes
I'll try to update every night if school lets me
“For taking on Loki alone” her eyes turn harsh, trying to hide the pain and the impotence
"Who took it from you?" he asks purely out of curiosity
“Don’t even think about it” Tasha gently advise the man but he just smirks and stomps on the cute little watch “Hey! That’s rude! It wasn’t mine to give away” she scolds, her armor must be arriving any minute now and, if the shadow that passed in front of the window 5 minutes ago is any indication, her back up just arrived “It was of my little brother’s sister, and that’s why I’m gonna have to kill you first”
"Why, of course, Captain, it would be an honor" the girl puts her hand on top of his "If you excuse us, gentlemen" she says as they walk away. Steve takes them to the little dance floor and puts his free arm on her back, Tasha quietly laughs "What's this about Winghead?"
He really wishes that she would’ve waited to go with them in the Quinjet at least (leaving him with Nat so she could stab metaphorical knives on him for what happened in the lab had nothing to do with that desire).
Tasha was 20, almost 21, looking like 17 when Agent (almost uncle) Coulson went to the newly Stark tower to ask for her help with a special Avengers mission, she agreed after some coercion from Pepper (while internally fangirling about Captain America, recently defrosted, and Bruce Banner being in the team) and put herself to research Selvig's work.
“You know what my old man used to say to me? One of his favorite of many sayings... the early bird gets the worm... but the second mouse gets the cheese” he gets close to her and lightly caress her cheek with the back of his finger, Tasha subtly moves her head out of the way
“I’m in a control room, I can see Steve from here, he looks weak, but at least he is awake, you are closer to him, I’ll try to see what can I do to block Killian’s transmission” Tasha makes an affirmative hum
“Uh... For saving your life?”
Natasha Stark stops working for a full second before throwing her arms to his neck and kisses him on the lips, Steve is surprised but kisses back immediately, a little scared that the moment breaks, until the genius seems to remember who she is with and stops
“But if that thing gets up to speed, you’ll get shredded” he sounds a little breathless at the idea of Tasha being possibly hurt
“So...” the super soldier looks at her with all the fake charm he learned from the USO as soon as he's back “Who are you?”
“Perhaps another time?” the man named Yinsen tries to call her but to no avail, the teenager is too drunk to recognize any good opportunities with fellow scientists
“Why don’t we let the guy blow off some steam? I’d love to meet our other member” Tasha says with a grin, Steve looks at her as if she had grown another head
“You look damn good, Mr. President, but I’m gonna need that suit back” Rhodey tells him
“Yeah... the bad news is that I missed the president... and the good news is that Nat and Clint blow the airplane up”
“We have out methods Stark... is there anything you and doctor Banner can do?”
“Toni” she scrunches her nose, he is the one of the only three people that still calls her that, especially since he knows she doesn’t like it that much “I’m assuming you saw the news”
“You are a maniac” Tasha whispers trying to get rid of the shock
Natasha Stark and Rhodey are hiding in the dark, walking quickly but being stealthy. Clint went to get Bruce and Nat Romanov is on the other side of the boat looking for clues on Steve location, Tasha looks completely focused... too much for Rhodey's comfort
“Let’s play some then” Bruce followed her lead with an amused expression
“Well, even with your genius, I can’t see how would you escape from here, but hey nobody ever accused me of not being grateful, so I want to repay you with the same gift of despair that you so graciously imparted to me” she groans
Next minute, they receive a phone call from Nick Fury who tells them that SHIELD's going to personally take the situation on their hands
“I was wrong director, the world hasn’t changed a bit” Steve says solemn, making Tasha feel slightly bad for him, the guy fought and sacrificed a lot for the country... a country that apparently didn't learn from their past mistakes
“Do you have PTSD? Are you going completely mental? I can stop, so you want me to stop?”
Up in the air, the Mark XLII opens an entry in the plane and proceeds to crash the glowing man to one of the airplane walls
“Is everything a joke to you?” he asks rolling his eyes, ‘
“I need some air” Steve whispers getting out and walking to the cliff where the house’s entrance was hours ago “Common Tash... where are you? Why won’t you let us help you?” at that moment he feels a vibration in his pocket, is his StarkPhone, the screen is blue and there’s an input code, Steve types ‘Zero-Two-Charlie-Three-Five-Delta-Blue-S-S-Zero-Seven’ he keeps both of his thumbs in the lecture code, then the ‘access granted’ message appears, Steve put the phone to his ear, the machine tells him that he has a new message, that almost makes him choke
"Of course we'll stay котенок, we need to stay close in case you do anything that stupid again" Nat says ruffling her hair as well. Tasha pouts
“Apology noted and appreciated” she turns to Bruce again “You were saying?”
“Ms. Stark” he greets her in Mandarin
“JARVIS? JARVIS? Please... please don’t leave me now, buddy” she begs to no avail, her friend is down, she is all alone. But she is gonna get out of this, she is Tasha Stark for god’s sake. She drags her armor through the snow, all the way to a little store, where she first stoles a poncho (she lefts a few dollars on the entrance shut up) and then she proceeds to call her security server, so it can transfer her message to all her receivers, she sends one to Nat’s code and one to Steve’s code
“We’re not finished yet” Thor interrupts her babble
“He was a great person, even when I had nothing I had Bucky, do you know what’s that like?” Tasha nods fondly and knocks her glass number 'only God knows at this point'
“No, you are in a dungeon, I’m free to go whenever I want” Tasha raises an eyebrow her ‘
“Yeah, I’ve noticed, working on it” she sounds a little breathless and Steve can only imagine that she is moving the rotors. Losing focus, Captain America slides off the railing, only managing to grab onto a loose cable at the very last minute
“Please, it’s not like I’m five” the reply comes in automatic
“Research. Say, your redesign, your big rebrand, that was AIM, right?”
“I can assure you.... I was better at taking care of myself when I was five” she deadpans again without thinking
“On it” it’s all her reply. She and Steve are walking through a debris-filled hall, she turns to him and says “Find engine three, I’ll meet you there” She walks into another room, most likely to get her armor. Steve leaves to suit up and find the damaged engine. When he gets there he sees that is, in fact, completely dead
“It’s still different” He tries to look at the screen, but Tasha slides it so he sees her
"You know where she is every time she is stressed" the spy says tilting her head slightly to the bar's direction, Steve nods and with a polite motion, he walks away trying to find his best friend
“Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract, this doesn't mean that we’re...” Tasha moves the screen and shows them plans of the weapons
“That’s a low blow Haps, even for you” she sisses
“You couldn’t do it even if you tried it, мой котенок” is what Tasha doesn’t hear
“Sure shellhead” Steve said biting his tongue to not protest about the alcohol, even if she looks like a kid she already is on legal age, or at least is going to be in a couple of months if Nat’s earlier teasing is anything to go by and only she knows what she needs to get over her nightmare
comments and kudos are well received :3
“Forty-seven, Miss may I ask please just a few hours to calibrate...”
“You’re the most gifted woman I’ve ever met” she blurts without thinking
“JARVIS has been running it since I hit the bridge, in a few hours we’ll know every little secret SHIELD wanted to hide” Tasha holds out a bag of dry fruit “Blueberry?" Steve shakes his head and sighs
“We will have to do further analysis about it” Bruce says as he approaches the group, recently un-hulked
Steve closes his eyes, the light is too bright and the dizziness is filling everything, just one thought stops him from letting him fall into darkness... Tasha... he can’t let him have her... he has to get out of there
“Captain, the bank on 42
This is mostly Steve's POV
“Your speech was great, girl!” a man tries to come close to her and Happy stands between him and his young boss
“oh no no no, just us”
“Bride?” Tasha smirks
"Lucky me I have my knight in shiny tuxedo to save me" she jokes and Steve smiles. They swing with the music, Steve never danced before, he wanted to have one with Peggy but destiny tore them apart before that much could happen, so, while everyone was extremely busy with the Mandarin's clean up, he had taken the chance to go to ballroom classes... or at least he would have if Nat hadn't stopped him '
“You are leaving again?” she chooses to ignore the older man's reprimind. All and all it wasn’t weird for the doctor to travel to strange places, Bruce left for good 3 months at least twice before, she still pouts, but he just tosses her hair affectionately
thank you for following the series, I have to think if I'm going to write the other movies (TWS, AoU, CW >:v, etc etc) I would love to read your thoughts about it ^^
“Is there any way of tracking the phone call?” Clint asks frowning
“So... you took Killian’s card, yeah, I think I can remember that... If I squint very hard”
She is young, spoiled and selfish, and she doesn't mind breaking a few hearts just to get what she wants. Who would've thought that the demons she created that night would come back to hunt her? surely she didn't
“Oh honey... trust me, I will after he had given us what we want, then, we will leave his corpse alone, and you know what? We haven’t even talked about salary yet, say... what kind of perk package are you thinking of?” Aldrich takes out an orange syringe and puts it on Tasha’s neck, she looks at him defiantly “Now... while we wait... how about we test the last updated version of EXTREMIS?” he is about to inject her, she can feel the point of the needle pushing her neck when Maya intervenes
Here's an advice: don't let your homework to accumulate and sleep!!! don't be like me!! really guys! I don't even know what I'm writing at this point
“I did?” her ex-security guard seems confused
“Look, I’m titillated by the notion of working with you, I’ll ditch these clowns and I’ll see you up on the roof in five minutes” she slurs and bats her eyelashes, the man blushes a deep shade of red at the flirting
A chapter to celebrate my almost end of semester
“Whoa whoa whoa, he’s here... he’s here, but he’s not here, he’s here, but he’s not here, you know what I mean?... I....It’s complicated... okay? It’s complicated”
“Ready to go?” Clint asks all the heroes in Quinjet "Where to?"
“Racing, isn’t obvious?”
He's trying his damnedest not to lose it, not to buck up into Tony and end up back at square one
“Good,” Tony echoed. “Let me know if anything changes. I’m gonna be here for a long while.”
Steve did feel the slide of Tony’s palms from his knees to his shoulders, rubbing him down like an overworked horse. He must have been chanting Tony’s name out loud. “Yes, Tony,” he managed, then gave himself over to moans and gasps. Tony massaged the tension out of every muscle, turning him to a pile of jello.
Tony arched into the bruising kisses to his throat, shivering with each nip of sharp teeth. Steve continued his path down until the cotton button-down got in the way. He paused to rip it away, buttons scattering across the floor in all directions.
“This isn’t Captain America,” Steve corrected. “This is Steve Rogers. I care about you, Tony. Of course I’m glad he’s dead.”
Steve kept the first kiss chaste and warm, pressing softly for only a second or two, then pulling away only an inch. He met Tony’s eyes, searching.
“Look over there, Iron Man,” Tony said, nodding toward Steve. “Looks like we’ve got an interested audience.”
But then, would that really be so bad?
Sacramento lights up the horizon at sunset, and though the skyline is not as impressive as the one at home, they admire it all the same.
“Wanna come, sweet thing?”
“Sure,” he said, powerless, trailing after Tony as if under a spell.
“I’ve been hard in my uniform since you took out that laser cannon,” Steve admitted, biting at the skin of Tony’s throat. “I need you.”
“Did you take a second one?”
“I’m afraid not. It will only take a minute.”
“Say, you know who you guys look like?” the tour guide asks a little loudly. They move on.
“No, I’m sorry, dear,” Tony said, and his voice sounded truly apologetic. “This is the game we’re playing now. We can play a different one later, when I’m bored of this one.”
“You sure know how to throw a party, Tony.”
“Your wings,” he started.
“Yeah, it’s starting to get really annoying,” Clint grumbled.
“You’re so lovely, debauched like this,” Tony told him affectionately, running a hand down his flank. “I almost don’t want to clean you up.”
“I know what I saw,” Steve said calmly, diplomatically. “Eidetic memory, remember? Besides. The blast pattern didn’t show any sign of a second vehicle close by.”
He came, his mouth open in a silent “o”, his legs tensing around Tony. Tony thrust once, twice, three times more, then buried himself to the hilt, shuddering his own release. They panted into each other’s hair and tried not to shake apart.
“M’fine,” Iron Man slurred, sounding so much like Tony just had, it made Steve grin. “Got hit in the stomach a lil bit. M’ out of the suit, got patched up.”
“Not—yet,” Tony bit out between thrusts. “Gotta—let him—fuck me first.”
Because they haven’t touched since then, and really, that’s all Tony needs to know.
Tony could see the bob of Steve’s throat as he swallowed. “Okay,” he agreed shakily.
But the thing is, Tony really enjoys it here. He feels like a kid for the first time in a while, surrounded by science in nature happening real time, before his very eyes. He takes a billion pictures to send to Bruce. He gets too close to a fumarole and almost falls in. He sets up an impromptu science lesson for a school group on a tour, pissing off their guide but enchanting the children and parents alike. Even on the one day it rains, he is exploding at the seams just to get the chance to observe the changes in the ecosystem. Steve watches him with a fond gaze, always at hand if Tony wants him, but mostly enjoying Yellowstone through Tony’s eyes.
“That’s exactly right.”
All they’d done was kiss, and Steve felt so enchanted already. He felt somehow more naked in the panties than he would have without them, feeling like Tony’s hands were pressing more intimately than ever. Maybe it was true, or maybe it was only his imagination, but it didn’t matter. The next moment, Tony had flipped them so Steve was on his stomach, Tony hovering above him, their legs tangled together.
“Tony!” Steve gasped, “Are you—”
The helmet nodded, and it made short work of the button-and-fly on Tony’s levi’s. Down his legs they fell, and the armor stepped back just enough to let Tony step out of them before its hands were back on his hips, holding firm. “Jump,” Iron Man instructed, before lifting Tony effortlessly so that their cocks lined up. Tony’s legs hugged tight around the armor’s middle, and he could feel the shifting plates recalibrating to hold his weight.
Clint wanted to call out and tell Stark to just ask him, but he had resolved that his best recourse was to ignore anything he heard while under the effects of the magic, and then pretend it never happened afterwards.
But, he grabbed the towel from the side table and wiped Steve’s sweat away. He got up and put out the candle, then came back with a wet cloth, and cleaned his saliva from Steve’s chest. Lastly, he pulled aside the ruined panties, and patted clean Steve’s utterly spent cock.
Edit 10/27/18 I got ten days further than last year! If I keep up this year-over-year improvement, I'll be able to actually complete an october challenge in 2020 ;)
“I’m not going to last many more nights like last night, darling. I’m soft, and my back needs to be pampered. If I don’t treat myself right, I’ll start aging again. Do you want to be dating a crippled, wrinkled Tony Stark?”
“My pleasure, Mr. Stark,” the armor replied. He casually saluted towards Steve, and with a “Cap,” and a nod farewell, the Iron Lover turned out of the bedroom and boarded Tony’s private elevator down to the workshop.
“Remember, you can’t come yet,” Tony offered. “Why don’t you take it easy? We’re not even to the main event yet.” He heard Steve’s sigh and saw him reluctantly drag his hand away from his cock.
This time both eyebrows went up.
“Sure, but which—which one are you, ah. Gone on?”
They find some hiking trails in the Blue Mountains that have horseback tours, and Steve looks like he will cry if Tony doesn’t come with him, so they end up on horses for an hour. Tony complains of back pain. It backfires, though, because Steve refuses to touch him until he’s feeling better. Tony grumbles under his breath, pressing his boner pointedly into Steve’s hip until he falls asleep.
“Tony, Tony, tell me,” Steve was calling from his chair.
Tony’s fingers touched his ears, and he knew they were red from blushing and lack of oxygen. He tried valiantly to shove Tony’s dick father down his throat.
But what was perfect about this moment wasn’t that it was with Captain America, he thought as Steve lined up. It was because it was with Steve, because he was giving Steve something unmeasurable, and Steve was giving something of himself in return. It was that they could trust each other, no one else, with this, with these moments where one or both of them felt less than human. They could bring each other back from that brink.
“Ughn,” Steve managed as his cock was set onto Tony’s tongue.
They stay like that until Bruce wanders in a half hour later and calls out, “They finally got their act together!” His announcement is met by a chorus of “Finally!” from the kitchen. Tony has to move then, so he can throw a pillow at Bruce’s retreating head.
was why he put up with the press and the paparazzi. This moment, and moments like these for every out person and every closeted person, were why he was so unapologetically loud. Because everyone deserved to have this moment, even Tony Stark. Even him.
Someone bangs on the wall behind his head, making him jump and accidentally choke Steve further before he pulls off. They grin at one another.
Steve grunted as he came on Tony’s cock, his hips stuttering uselessly against the brutal pace his Alpha had set. He whined deep in the back of his throat, high on the endorphins, mind whizzing out to space and leaving him floating, peacefully blank and light.
“Just a little something I thought you might like,” Tony said as casually as he could muster, though he tellingly couldn’t rip his eyes away from Steve’s. “Open it.”
Steve takes a moment to reflect on all the things that brought him here. He wonders when it became normal for his greatest problems in life to be nightmares. Not even his own nightmares—though, there are plenty of those, too.
Okay I'm late on this one but i was on a date and i forgot to post before I went out ok pls forgive me
“…He is,” the AI allowed. “But he is not taking visitors.”
Tony whined as the armor removed the fingers from his ass, but he couldn’t help breathing harder as the cold, rigid head of Iron Man’s cock lined up, brushing teasingly against his ass. “Oh god,” he moaned, letting the gauntlets settle again on his wrists and hip. “Oh god.”
“I’ve never been so happy,” Steve murmured. “I’ve been thinking about you, ever since the invasion. God, Tony, I am so gone on you.”
Tony freezes, going rigid. Then he relaxes, breathing all the air out of his lungs in a long exhale. “Steve,” he tacks onto the end of it, almost an afterthought.
Find me on dreamwidth
A third metal finger teased at Tony’s hole, stroking the heated skin. The coldness was a relief, really. It slipped inside on the next thrust, angling just right to nick his prostate. “Ah!” Tony yelled, throwing his head back against the wall. “Fuck, do that again.”
Iron Man,” he breathed, hardly believing it even as the pieces all fell into place.
.o0o.
There was a moment or two of shuffling as Tony grabbed something from the end table, then there was the *snick of a lotion bottle opening, and Tony’s deft hands were gliding over Steve’s back. They smoothed the lotion into his skin, not really massaging, but giving a nice rub-down. Steve would have turned entirely to liquid if he knew how.
With that announcement, Tony fell on him again, his hands suddenly everywhere and his mouth leaving wet, sucking kisses across Steve’s abdomen. Steve couldn’t help but buck under the sudden attention, his heart beating faster and his breath coming shorter.
Steve shuffled his feet uncomfortably. “Um, both of you? I mean, both. Tony, and Iron Man.”
Steve felt himself contract helplessly around Tony, his body milking the thick come out of his cock like he was hungry for it. Tony pulsed and obliged, and Steve imagined he could feel the stream of come inside him, adding to the pressure. His prostate was pressed against Tony’s girth, and every hitch of breath and stutter of his hips brought them into shocking, brilliant contact.
“Let’s go booby trap the bathrooms,” She suggested, and suddenly the anniversary party got a lot more entertaining.
“Mmh hmmh,” Steve agreed, trying not to visibly shake with anticipation. Tony was going to fuck him. Tony was going to fuck him in panties, going to pull them aside and slip right in, like a filthy secret, like a promise. Tony was going to–
"Tony... Tony, please-- I'm gonna--"
“Mr. Stark has a second car. He likes to travel with options. He, ah, slipped in and drove off at the beginning of the fight.”
Steve pulled back to reply, but Tony’s petting hardened to fists as he held him on his cock. Keeping him where he wanted. Steve sighed and relaxed into Tony’s hold. “Clint knows what Natasha knows,” Tony continued, sounding much less affected than Steve. “Thor is the god of fertility, you know. He has a sixth sense for when people are horny. and Bruce would take one look at your ears turning such a pretty red and instantly know what you were thinking.”
They were still sitting so close, Tony practically on Steve’s lap, their heads close together. Steve thought maybe he could lean in and press a kiss to Tony’s forehead. He tried not to remember how he’d imagined this exact scenario, but with Iron Man in his place. He had to stifle a laugh, then.
he reaches a hand back to feel Tony pumping three fingers into himself, and it's wet and slick and so good
After he hung up, he expected the nervous energy that had been plaguing him since the first phone call, hours ago now, to fade. But knowing that Steve had been MIA on a mission, even for only half a day, had him on edge and jittery.
“They said–” Steve cut off. He grabbed at Tony’s hands, lifting them up to inspect them in the light. “They said they would cut off your fingers.”
"Tony-- Tony, I can't... I-- please, Tony..."
.o0o.
Steve would probably have responded, but just then Tony ducked suddenly to lick a hot, wet stripe up the middle of his sac. He only just stopped himself from whining again, and damn, maybe Tony was right. Maybe they should do this more often if this was how Steve reacted to being teased.
Steve shrugged. “I enjoyed myself. Really. And I’m not usually one for parties.”
Later, after the fight was done and the aliens had destroyed half of New York, Rogers cornered Tony in a SHIELD conference room post-debrief.
“But they
“Please remain where you are,” JARVIS insisted, sounding apologetic. “Miss Potts will be here shortly to triage and do threat assessment.”
During debrief, Tony hadn’t had the chance to shower yet, so he wasn’t back in his civvies like normal. No, he was in that thrice damned
Steve cried out as Tony pushed further and further in, filling him just right. “Yes, yes,” he chanted, feeling complete as Tony bottomed out.
Steve fucked up into him like he was a dying man in search of water. He pressed into Tony until his weight surrounded him, keeping him locked against the wall where only Steve could touch him. They rocked together, fast and rough, until Tony was exhaling in a high whine with every thrust and Steve’s cock scraped across his spot.
“Having a good time?” Natasha asked.
Steve’s chest heaved in a sigh so bone-deep, Tony could feel it even from across the room. “Thank god,” Steve murmured. “You called, and you sounded like you were nervous, and then...you said…”
“No, Tony,” Steve insisted, running his palms up and down Tony’s arms in an attempt to warm him. “I’m not doomed. I’m safe. We’re both safe.”
“Yinsen—”
Tony nods desperately, doing his level best to arch into the grinding thrusts Steve is giving. When they slow and stop, he groans out a protest.
Tony wasn’t sure if Mike meant he would do great at telling Steve, or at having a baby inside him, but either way, he appreciated it. “Thanks.”
“Jesus,” Steve murmured. “You really thought of everything, huh?”
Tony Stark was a little harder to explain away.
“Sir. it is 3 am in Texas, where Colonel Rhodes is stationed. It is 5 am here. Perhaps—“
Iron Man had always fascinated Steve, of course. The armor was the first thing he drew after waking up. Its sleek curves and flashy power were attractive to him in a way he couldn’t quantify. Plus, Iron Man himself was a good man and a brilliant fighter. The snark merely put Steve over the edge into full-blown crush territory—he’d always had a thing for snarky, brilliant people.
The armor had yet to pull out, but it dropped Tony’s wrists down to its cold chestplate. The hand at his hip supported his weight, but it no longer kept him pinned quite as strongly. “Let me down, Iron Man,” Tony said, bracing for the pull-out. Iron Man complied, sliding out of Tony’s well-fucked hole smoothly.
More than one person in the room let out a murmured “Gross.” Cap, predictably, flushed red.
“Saint Joseph, Michigan,” Steve explains, pulling off his helmet to reveal sweaty, tousled hair. “You know, my ma always liked Saint Joseph. Jesus’ pa, you know? And, well. I suppose her pa wasn’t around, and with my pa gone…” he sighs. “We coulda done with a father figure, I suppose.”
“Shh, take it slow. There you go, big guy. Nice and easy.” Tony worked Steve’s hips for him, encouraging him to thrust in even, slow drags, before returning questing fingertips to his ass and thighs.
.o0o.
Rhodey isn't Tony's therapist, okay, but no one told Tony that.
Steve helps Tony out of a nightmare.
“Steve,” Tony bit back teasingly.
[He doesn’t like to be cold,] Stark reminded himself, [but maybe he’d make an exception for sugar.]
“Call him,” Mike suggested. “If he’s unavailable, call your friend Colonel Rhodes. Sit down and talk it out with someone, decide what options you want to consider.”
All too quickly Steve can feel his dick getting hard again, never really having gone soft in the first place
.o0o.
Day fifteen dawns hot. It’s the hottest weather they have encountered since the beginning. “I’m grateful,” Steve grins cheerfully at Tony over breakfast. “It means the mountain temperatures will be nicer.”
“Do it,” Steve breathed. “I want it, do it.”
“I must have done something fucking
“Threat assessment! What on earth—”
“Shut up!” Tony chucked a pillow at him. “I’m being serious!”
He’s right, of course. As they ascend from forty-five hundred feet to over fourteen thousand, the temperature drops dramatically, almost to the point that Tony needs a jacket. The top of Grays Peak looks out over many more mountains and valleys, mottled with the shadows of hundreds of fluffy white clouds. The air is so thin up here, it feels like there’s something constricting his chest when he breathes in. He nearly panics, but then Steve’s warm hand is on his back, and he takes deep breaths, and he is suddenly exhilarated.
They sat and ate on the ratty couch, Tony gesturing with his chopsticks as he chatted about the armor repairs. Steve stayed quiet, but he listened calmly, making sure to nod along and ask questions when Tony paused. It was the same as it had always been—Steve didn’t feel awkward now that he knew the truth.
Steve opened his mouth to say that Tony made a pretty swell picture himself, but what came out was a startled yell, for Tony chose that exact moment to twist his nipples sharply. The zing of pleasure-pain shot down his spine. Tony petted his thumbs softly over the buds, soothing the hurt, before pinching again, making Steve buck under him.
Clint stood still in pure shock for about ten seconds before continuing on his way. But he didn’t leave before Stark’s mind flitted to imagery of Steve in soft, cuddly pajamas, not at all sexy, just warm and comfy. He sighed into his cup of coffee as Bruce pointedly changed the subject and Clint ran for his safe room.
.o0o.
“Coffee, oh thank god.” Tony stole the mug out of Steve’s hands, tilting it back to swallow half of it in one go.
Still, he sometimes wondered if the person who shared his pattern would ever come forward to meet him. It was hard to tell, anymore, with half his wings gone, but once they had been a glorious dark red, his undersides a burnished gold, and his flight primaries tipped in shocking white. He wishes he could see his wings again, just once. Even if the person attached to them wasn’t meant to be with him, like the old wives’ tale said.
He turned around. The heart-shaped top hem framed his ass and accentuated the roundness of it. The lace formed a lovely pattern in the back. The center of the pattern rested just over his hole, hinting and drawing the eye. He swallowed again, feeling bare and so, so strong at the same time.
“He’s just getting to that part,” Tony elaborated. “Can you take my jeans off first, Iron Man?”
typed in bold font, both on the sign and on the paving in front of the spot. Steve rubs the back of his neck, embarrassed. “When I asked if I could pay for long-term parking here, they insisted.”
Tony petted Steve’s balls with teasing fingertips, so close to Steve's dick, but still on such a sensitive spot. He wanted more, he needed more but Tony just smirked and lightly ran his fingers over his sac again and again and again. Steve was going to die.
“Um, Harder, yeah, give it to him harder,” Steve agreed. His hand was flying over his own cock, the other pulling his balls to stave off his release. “Tony, I need to come.”
“Can I check—” Steve asked, but before he could finish the thought aloud, his hands were already coming up to peel Tony’s tank top out of the way and feel at Tony’s bandages lightly. He brushed a palm across the gauze, feeling the heat from the wound, noticing that it wasn’t bleeding through. Tony’s skin was peppered with goosebumps—was he cold?—but otherwise he was clean, uninjured, and standing tall.
Steve’s blush did not deteriorate. Tony ran his hands down from Steve’s shoulders to his hips, glancing up for permission before feeling the outline of Steve’s dick in his pants. Steve moaned wantonly and shifted his hips.
stings. But Tony soldiers on. They have work to do, and he can’t waste time worrying about how Steve might react to being stuck with Tony as his other half.
Steve smiled sheepishly. “I was going to, yes.”
you have it?”
A few minutes later, with little fanfare, they pull out of the airport and jump on the highway. Steve wants to make it to Toledo by dinner.
“It was sickeningly disgusting,” Clint pronounced, grinning. “I almost died from sap overdose.”
“Yes.” Steve’s voice cracked. “Need you. Want all of you. Inside me. Tony.”
“Tony.”
Natasha raised a pointed eyebrow at them when they returned to the quinjet to fly back to the tower. Steve was red as a tomato, and Tony was smug as a cat. They held hands the whole way home.
“No,” Steve cut him off. “I love it.”
.o0o.
Tony gasped as Steve lined up their cocks and thrust hard. Even with the material between them, muting the friction, it was too much stimulus.
Tony sucked in a breath through his teeth at the feeling of Steve’s hand on him, when not even a minute ago he’d been sure Cap was about to give him a lecture. It was whiplash of the best kind.
Steve was whining and stroking himself still, his eyes shut tight against the messy scene before him, as if a single glance would push him over the edge. “Steve,” Tony called, his voice wrecked. “Steve, look at us.” When Steve met his eyes, gasping for breath, Tony looked him dead in the face and ordered, “Come now.”
, Tony Stark, getting it on with Iron Man?”
. But he let the moment pass, and instead offered, “I’m glad you had a good night.” This was growth, right? Maturity, or something? Tony would have to ask Rhodey later.
“I’m real,” Steve reassures him. “I’ve wanted to do that for weeks.”
Tony huffs. “Yeah, alright.” Then, a moment later, “I’m drunk.”
“And really, I can’t blame him. Used to be, there were six people who knew his identity. Now, half the people on that list are dead. He probably wants to stop people from being close to him, to protect them.”
magic, too, as if Clint hadn’t had his skull fucked around with enough. He should sue.
Tony takes the time to wreck Steve that evening, tonguing his cock and balls until he shudders from overstimulation. Steve is still staring blankly at the ceiling, chanting Tony’s name under his breath while Tony rubs off against his thigh. As he comes, Steve murmurs “I love you,” with as much voice as he can muster. Tony explodes all over the sheets.
He was already touching himself through his clothes, despite Tony’s word not to come. His palm pressed into the front of his jeans, mouth gaping open, eyes blown dark. Tony could see the peaks of his nipples through the thin cotton of his t-shirt.
Tony had been respectful of Steve’s old fashioned values and waited until the third date, but that was ending tonight.
“Iron Man,” Captain America called, stopping Tony in his tracks as they were all piling out of debrief. “I’d like a moment. Could you follow me, please?”
Steve did openly sob, then. But he couldn’t stop himself from thrusting down, from feeling that wet silk cling and release from his skin. He was in hell.
And when Tony has to pull off of Steve's dick to let out the most wanton moan Steve has ever heard, Steve is quick to sit up and pull Tony into his lap, kissing into his mouth and tasting himself on Tony's tongue
“You don’t even like popsicles! You’re like the only anti-ice cream guy I’ve ever met!”
Steve’s smile was blinding, so Tony figured he must have gotten something right. “Say,” Steve murmured, walking over to where Tony had been picking up plastic champagne glasses, “Need any help with cleanup?”
“You know I won’t be able to sleep, J.”
The Rockies were just as gorgeous the second time around. Steve spent the remaining daylight hours sketching them. They watched the foothills turn vibrant orange in the dying light, and Steve swore that he’d never get the color or scale to translate onto paper.
“Would you like me to initialize Phase Two, Cap?”
“Come on, relax for me, darling. That’s it, shh, you’re so gorgeous, you’re doing amazing.” Tony kept up this stream of praise and direction as he pushed in.
Tony relaxed into the teasing. Teasing, he could do. “I was waiting for some poor sap to come along and get roped into helping me,” he snarked back, joining Steve on his knees to collect more of the mess.
“Yes, Iron Man,” Steve ordered. “Begin Phase Two.”
“You’re really good at pulling me out of those.”
"Tony, I-- I can't Tony, you--"
Howard was ignoring him, too, which was really par for the course. The reels came out and father couldn’t think of anything else.
This ficlet has religious undertones, so if that type of stuff bugs you (discussion of gods, demons are mentioned, etc) then maybe skip this one.
Steve has real tears streaming from his eyes, and it hurts, hurts so good and Tony isn't faltering, Steve is still hard and so sensitive
Tony’s smile grew wider. “Captain America’s kinky. Who knew?”
“Shh, Tony, it’s 2013. You’re in the tower, in your penthouse. I’m here.”
“Why the hell not?” Tony scowled. “I know it will be useful to you in the field.” Tony knew this, because Steve preferred useful gifts over extravagant ones. Tony was not too proud to admit that, beyond the symbolism, he was trying to find a middle ground between ‘practical’ and ‘Tony Stark normal’ here.
“Hell yes. This is going to be so much
“I should’ve done, should’ve known,” Tony was mumbling, almost to himself.
“I still want to take you out, if you want. Go steady. Soulmate or not, I’m really into you.”
“Myself and Rhodey, of course.” Colonel Rhodes, Steve’s mind supplied. They’d met twice, and he was introduced as Tony’s best friend. “Director Fury. And now, you.”
bully Fury with his entire legal team until he caved and allowed Steve the choice to go about his Captain America business with his wings un-dyed. Steve, gratefully, accepted the offer, and revealed his true wings immediately. The press had a miniature heart attack, of course, but eventually the new normal was to see Captain America, dressed in his white-and-blue field suit, with red, white, and burnished gold wings.
That was apparently the wrong thing to say, because Tony leaned back on his heels, looming over Steve and pulling those teasing touches away.
Sooner than he would have thought, JARVIS spoke up. “Sir, Captain Rogers has just parked his motorcycle in the garage. He will be up presently.”
.o0o.
Afterward, Steve snorts when Tony answers what had brought on their impromptu lovemaking. “
But Tony knew, when Steve got like this, how to help him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I wouldn’t be calling you if I wasn’t gonna keep it, Mike,” Tony scoffed, even though the idea of keeping and raising a baby hadn’t even fully occurred to him until he said it. But he knew at once that he would keep it. Of course he would.
Steve only stared back, his eyes probably blown dark, and watched Tony’s head dip to suck one ball fully into his mouth. Steve gasped.
“Amazing,” Tony murmured, collapsing into the mess he’d left on Steve. “We’ll get cleaned up in a minute.”
“What the fuck, Stark?” The words poured out of his mouth before he could get a handle on his impulse control, interrupting Coulson’s briefing.
Steve wasn’t much for speculating about other people’s personal lives. After seventy years of being speculated about, it’s not a surprise he doesn’t like to participate in that sort of thing. But lately, he’s found some interesting exceptions.
“You with me, Steve, darling?” Tony called, and Steve met his gaze.
Cap whirled and pinned Tony to the cold tile by his hips, grinding into him like he couldn’t bear to keep away. He was rock solid in his uniform—how had Tony missed that?—and he was looking down through blown, lidded eyes.
“They’re alright,” Agent Coulson promised from the other end of the line. “No injuries.”
“I know you are, darling. You’re performing amazingly, you’ve been doing so well. Just a little longer, hm?”
Tony crawled down his body, letting his chest rub against Steve’s as he went. He finally settled between Steve’s legs, stroking over his crack through the panties with one finger, letting his hot breath caress the pale skin of Steve’s thighs.
“You like this?” Iron Man asked, and maybe it was Tony’s imagination, but he swore the eye sockets were glowing brighter as they looked down at Tony’s bobbing cock, his stretched rim.
“I need to make sure he is okay. Is there any way I can talk to him? He was hurt pretty badly.”
He grabs the complimentary bathrobe from the hook on the wall and stumbles down the hall until he finds stairs to the main floor. There, a continental breakfast with coffee is being served. He fills and empties three cups before Steve returns.
“Tony!” Steve shouted. “Please, fuck me!”
Steve chanted in his head.
Steve only laughs at him some more, and then presses a dozen kisses to his face and neck. “Thank you for protecting my virtue.”
“You’re so receptive,” Tony commented, “It must be really hard for you to be still. But you’re doing so well for me.”
Tony’s eyebrow raised. “With who?”
“Shh, no need to beg. You know I’ll always give you what you want.”
Tony arches an eyebrow and gives a crooked grin. "Well, I'd be happy to give you a hell of a lot more that you never thought you'd get from anyone."
"Ugh, of course he does," he rolls his eyes, salty about Bucky being a good person in any respect. "I still don't like him. Is that gonna be a deal breaker?"
Now Tony scoffs. "For being with me like we were. Or anything that's like that that I can have now that your soulmate's in the picture." For once, there are no air quotes or mocking tone with that word.
That makes him all the more sure of his inferiority, makes him doubt he's ever been what Steve needs, even briefly, and emotional pain strikes his features. His hand loosens, almost giving permission to what Bucky is doing to him.
That makes Bucky laugh and he nods. "Yeah, let's go back. I'm very curious what inappropriate things Captain America comes up with."
Steve moans a little as he feels Tony on top of him, smiling into the kiss. Suddenly he has a thought though. "Do you.. I'm not... Like, it matters that it's me who makes you feel loved, right?"
Steve swallows and looks at Bucky for a long, long moment. "I think there might be some things we need to talk about first."
Steve wraps his arms around Bucky's neck and doesn't seem ready to let go for anything. "Take me back to bed, please?"
"Anything you want, baby," Steve says immediately. "You're the one that counts here."
It's not the first or the second or even the fifth time Steve pulls away because Tony enters the room. And while Bucky understands where he's coming from, every time it happens it hurts. So this time, when Steve lets go of his hand, he doesn't just accept it. Instead, he gets up. "I'm going to go for a run," Bucky declares roughly.
"Tony! That would be an enormous waste of money." He can't help but blush a little and busies himself with unpacking his sweet treats.
Helplessly, Steve clenches and unclenches his fists. "I love Bucky. And Tony is incredibly important to me, too, but he's not..."
Steve has the decency to blush a little.
. Which, by the way, we fucked up royally because here we are."
"Yeah. I guess I just had a bit of a relapse. I'll get back on top of it. You know, it's really too bad none of the Avengers are also a licensed psychologist."
Tony glances over for half a second, and it is a good question."I guess because you're worth it? I've never dated a guy I turned out liking enough to out myself for."
Steve relaxes quite quickly, taking in the sights around them. "Where are we going exactly?"
"Well..." he draws out the word, "When you put it that way, it does sound a little harsh. And I wasn't so much implying as... doing some information gathering." Tony shrugs, brushing it off.
"I'm not sure what you mean..." He's been hurt too many times to get his hopes up now.
pure but I can definitely try harder." His hands find Tony's hip and neck with a gentle touch, pulling their bodies together before kissing him. Surprisingly hard. He just can't help himself, there's too much pent up want and need inside of him.
Bucky still has Tony pinned and gets his cock out as well now, starting to stroke it together with his own. At that sight, Steve lets out a little whimper.
That comment has him frowning and Bucky stills. "He didn't. There's no way he would do that."
"It won't be the first time I've chosen you over everything and everyone else," he whispers back.
"But... didn't you
"I, uh, I wanna try it out," he says with a shrug, acting a lot more casual than he feels. "See how it goes. One time. Not going in with any expectations of it ever being more or happening again. Just trying out this fantasy we all have, no strings."
"Move on? Re-light that candle? Nat, Bucky is my soulmate. Even if it's unrequited, I'm happy just having him by my side as a brother for the rest of my days," Steve explains with a crooked smile. "And it's not fair to be with Tony when there's someone I need and love more. Doesn't matter if I get him or not."
Tony smiles crookedly, a little embarrassed. "Yeah, my physical interest. Like, how much I wanna be close, and touch you, and kiss... various parts." He clears his throat and is suddenly taking great interest in a little spot on the kitchen counter, apparently, because he certainly isn't looking at Steve anymore.
? Like, not even a little bit?"
"What are you looking for?" Steve runs a hand through his hair and takes another few deep breaths, willing his erection down.
"You want me that bad, huh?" Tony grins, but then shakes his head. "Nah, it's a fantasy and it can stay that way. You can have what you want without that."
"You're gorgeous," he murmurs against Steve's skin. His attention with his mouth intensifies, a distraction while he gets the other man's pants open and his hand inside.
Buck fists his human hand into Steve's shirt without really noticing it. "You... so we... I mean, if we ever... If
"Yeah?" Bucky pins his with his metal arm and kisses him again. "How? How are you going to fix it?"
He's absolutely perplexed by that. "What? What does that mean, I don't have to?"
"Thank you." Steve falls silent, eating and drinking his coffee. Well, and once in a while he moans again.
Hearing it put so plainly like that, that Steve wants to be physical with Bucky, it does sting. But remembering that he isn't because at least in this, he puts Tony first, helps a lot. "Maybe... maybe we could just... try it out? The three of us. And neither of us does that kind of stuff with Bucky alone until we're all sure that we're comfortable with that happening. Could that work?"
"Because being with both of you would make me happier than just being with him," Steve explains quietly and ducks his head, still somewhat ashamed for feeling that way, even though so far people seem to be okay with it.
They get up before dawn. The slow seep of fog between the towers of the Manhattan skyline greets them, and though the crowd of traffic is unrelenting, this seems as close to sleeping as New York ever gets. Tony yawns into his coffee mug and snuggles closer to Steve’s side as they take a cab to the airport.
, the thin, skin-tight material which always made Steve’s tongue feel heavy. He wanted—he
“I just–it was a joke, I don’t really expect–please forgive me, Tony, I–”
The words send Tony’s mind reeling. “What? No. You—you don’t want that. And it’s fine, I get it, I would be disappointed in me, too. No pressure. But, ah. I think it’s best if I take some time off. Not because of—of you, or anything, I just. Need some time.”
Steve turned around, and there was Tony’s heart, cradled in the space just under his collar bone, glowing bright and sure. Tony suddenly felt like crying.
“Tony,” Steve mumbled against his lips.
“I guess I’m glad you find my shitty brain convenient,” Clint deadpanned.
so he sits up and pushes Steve's shoulders until he's laying back on the bed and very very slowly starts licking and kissing down Steve's neck and chest and down to his waist.
“There are so many wonderful things we can do while leaving these on,” he explained. “Do you want me to lick at you, get you wet?”
[Slice the jugular. Knife in left boot. Strangle. Garrotte hidden in bra. Bludgeon with chair leg.] Natasha, of course. She said thinking of ways to kill whoever was speaking helped her get through team meetings without going crazy.
“Hormone levels are elevated, sir,” JARVIS allowed. “I’m afraid my systems are not sophisticated enough to confirm anything else.”
Tony grinned slyly. “My voice, put through the Iron Man filter,” he confirmed. “But more on that later, honey. Now, we’ve got to get to work.”
“It’s no trouble, Tony. Many hands make light work.”
This one is so bittersweet jfc
“Tony,” Steve moaned like a prayer.
They made it to Savannah on the evening of Day twenty-three. Tony sees the end of their national road trip in sight, so he convinces Steve to stay an extra day and make the trek out to Hilton Head. It’s a lovely island, and Savannah’s historic architecture makes Steve nostalgic, so he agrees. They have drinks on the beach, using the time off the road just to talk and tell stories. It’s one of Tony’s favorite stops.
Steve gasped as Tony thrust again. “No, that’s not quite right,” Tony said, nipping at Steve’s earlobe as he stroked his cock in time with his thrusts. “You want me to
The worst thing that happened that weekend, though, was magic. Of fucking course it was. Wasn’t it always? And it had to be
“Steve,” Tony whispers like a prayer.
“Like that?” Steve asks coyly from his position straddling Tony’s thighs, keeping him pinned right where he wants him.
“Need you,” Captain America panted, and Tony realized slower than he should have that this wasn’t an Iron Man-and-Cap interaction, this was a Steve-and-Tony interaction. Those were way more fun.
“Ahh,” he let out, “Ahh, Tony.”
Usually Maria would come in and shake her head, pull Tony away before the more violent clips began. But Tony’s parents had been screaming, last night, and Maria was in Paris now, so Tony was alone with his father.
“Sensitive,” Tony commented, still licking occasionally at the now-ruined panties.
Clint Barton was not having a good weekend.
Still, he sometimes wondered if the person who shared his pattern would ever come forward to meet him. It was hard to tell, anymore, with half his wings gone, but once they had been a glorious dark red, his undersides a burnished gold, and his flight primaries tipped in shocking white. He wishes he could see his wings again, just once. Even if the person attached to them wasn’t meant to be with him, like the old wives’ tale said.
. No one can know, or it will be bad. I can’t—I can’t do that to anyone, even if I trust them. Even if I trust
you again.” When Steve groaned in agreement, he laughed. “You want to be on my knot all day, want me to use you and fill you up. That what you want, honey?”
“Shh, shh, it’s okay,” he promised, letting Steve clutch at his wrists. “It’s okay, take what you need. Come on, Steve. Fuck me.”
Fortunately, the next day’s traffic was much less. It was noticeably more populous than some of their previous stretches of road, however, with more towns and cities the further east and south they went.
“I’m gonna reprogram one of the suits,” Tony mumbled into his shoulder. Steve thought he might be talking shop for a moment, but then Tony continued. “Gonna find a way to get it to hold me down. Put on a show for you, like you said.”
Steve finds Tony in the corner of the workshop, two-thirds of his way through a bottle of bourbon.
“Huh?”
This wouldn’t have been a big deal if Tony didn’t notice every time Steve so much as twitched his wings how they shimmered so evenly in the light. His own spotty gold belied years of off-again on-again plucking from stress. He felt ruined and damaged, and Steve was always around to show him, in excruciating detail, exactly where he failed.
But Steve is smiling, Steve is brushing his hair out of his eyes, Steve is bottoming out and holding still, giving them both a few moments to get used to this again, this crystalline intimacy.
The hands on his thighs shifted periodically to check his bonds and make sure he wasn’t rubbing himself raw. His cock was never touched, not even when Tony lifted him up onto his knees briefly to look and confirm this wasn’t hurting him. Nothing hurt, except the pounding of ninety percent of his blood in his groin, and the orgasm he’d been wishing to have since they started this cruel game.
“Red, white, and…”
Tony was so charismatic and funny, and he took Steve’s introduction to present-day New York pretty seriously. They spent time at arcades and record stores, so Steve could get a taste of some of the things he’d missed. Tony would drag him from store to store, shoving clothing at him to try, until he found more modern styles that he liked. They went to concerts, conventions, museums, art galleries, and once, memorably, the circus. They giggled at how dumb they looked in the gossip rags the next day, sharing a bag of cotton candy and wearing balloon animal hats.
The fingers thrust hard again, and then again, and soon Iron Man had set a brutal pace. He finger fucked Tony up into the wall, making his hips jerk and his hands slip against the wall above him. Steve groaned loudly. “God, I need to come,” he begged.
“Yes–ye-es, Tony,” Steve cried.
“What if you hadn’t been able to wait? What if you’d crawled under the table and blown me right there, in front of everyone? They all knew you wanted to,” Tony reminded Steve, and now he was thrusting in time with Steve’s sucks. “What if you hadn’t been able to hold back?”
“Trying,” Steve tried to mutter, but it came out like a plea. “Trying hard.”
Steve’s type.
Oh, no. Steve fantasized about Iron Man and Mr. Stark with
“Do you wish we had stopped more? Done more things? The Grand Canyon, Saint Louis, New England, all of Texas…” Tony asked Steve.
Steve nodded, taking over the grip on the two fighter’s necks. He noticed the smaller of the two was only a kid, maybe sixteen.
Tony withdrew more often as the weeks passed, to the point that he would miss mandatory Avengers meetings and debriefs just so he wouldn’t have to pretend not to stare longingly at Steve whenever they were both in a room together. The others clearly noticed, but blessedly said nothing.
Just as they rounded the corner to enter the kitchen, Stark strayed close enough to Clint that the archer got a little more context than he really wanted. They were discussing some Captain-America-lookalike camboy that had gone somewhat viral recently, and how Bruce got roped into listening to Stark talk about sexytimes was beyond Clint, but here they were.
They spend the day indoors, occasionally raiding the tea cupboard but otherwise enjoying the sight of rain drenching the beach and one another’s company. By this, Tony means they fuck on every available surface when they get bored. The whole apartment stinks of sex by the time they’re finished.
in Steve’s perfect handwriting.
Tony stilled. It wouldn’t have been so worrying if Tony wasn’t always moving, but being frozen like that was a clear red flag.
“You’re so red,” Tony murmured, his eyes trained on where his finger penetrated Steve. “So needy. Huh, Steve? Aren’t you?”
“Of course not,” Tony said haughtily. “They never could. No, this is much worse. They’re discontinuing the Captain America popsicles.”
“Shhh, good. You’re so good for me,” Tony murmured. Then the straps of fabric were gone, and the ropes around his wrists were removed, and he clumsily followed Tony’s urging to flip onto his back. He left behind a wet spot of precome, darkening the silk.
The dirtiest his thoughts ever got was imagining them kiss, Mr.Stark’s thigh trapped between Iron Man’s, their tongues mingling. The suit shone in low light, and Mr. Stark sported smudges of grease on his hands from tuning it up. Iron Man brought up one gauntlet to gently move Mr. Stark’s hair out of his eyes, and his ever-shifting imaginary face smiled down at the engineer.
“You are wicked,” he accused, and Tony only smiled beatifically.
This was one of those times where Tony was on his knees, pressing Steve’s hips into the wall of a supply closet with one hand, and using the other to guide his prize carefully between his teeth.
So when the Captain America-themed popsicles became available in stores, no one expected Tony to be the one that stocked up.
“I’m on my way,” Steve assured, rushing to the garage. He ran past the empty spot where Tony’s car had been parked to his motorbike, gassed and ready to go. He straddled it and flew out into the street, dodging traffic like a stunt driver.
Tony stared up at him for a moment before responding. “Just a mild one. I made JARVIS wake me up every couple hours, make sure I wasn’t going to die.” He startled, seemed to notice how close they were standing, and took a measured step back.
“Yes, yes, please, yes–”
“I’m already close to you,” Steve disagreed softly. Tony’s eyes looked so bright, up close like this. “I can’t help it. You pull me in. I’m so—” Steve cut himself off. “You’re the person I’m closest to.”
This time, Tony felt under his sac to press against his perineum with a feather-light touch. It wasn’t to give Steve pleasure, just to remind him that Tony could, that if he strayed a little lower, Steve would be unable to keep himself from coming on Tony’s fingers jamming into his prostate. Then his hand slipped up to cup his balls and weigh them in his palm.
The phone rang once, twice, three times, then finally a labored voice answered. “H’lo.”
“Oh, you know. A few weeks, probably.” Six was a few, right?
“Sure.”
Steve finds him in the corner of his workshop, leaning against the leg of the most recent Iron Man armor. The suit is powered up in sentry mode, and its imposing figure standing tall over Tony’s hunched frame paints a very dark picture.
“I understand, JARVIS. You were only protecting Tony. He’s lucky to have you. Lucky to have…” Steve was about to say Iron Man, but he remembered again. “To have you, too, Miss Potts.”
Steve spoke to Tony once about Iron Man’s schedule, and asked if he had any free time at all.
“He is finished with the mission, sir, and can take your call. Would you like me to connect you?”
“Ahh! Fuck, oh fuck!”
[I would like to end this topic of conversation.] Bruce was broadcasting, and Clint didn’t need to look at him to know he was giving off his standard “leave me alone” vibes. Stark, for his sins, was one of the only people in the world who could get away with ignoring those vibes.
“Please, yes, Tony, please,” Steve whined. He was ready to beg more, and his cock was almost purple it was so hard. But Tony, benevolent even in his cruelty, lifted a single hand and ran the palm flat across the head of his cock with little fanfare.
This ficlet was inspired by an anon who asked Sabrecmc on tumblr if there were any good Steve-Riding-Tony fics. I couldn’t not do it.
Steve has never felt so hard in his life and he needs some friction soon, he needs to feel something because his dick is aching, he needs to touch Tony because he feels like he's going to burst at any second
“You’re so desperate,” Tony agreed, petting at Steve encouragingly. “Look at you, dragging me aside in the first free moment. Did you even pay attention to debrief? Or were you doing your best not to eye-fuck me in a room full of our respected colleagues?”
Tony's hand has disappeared beneath his waist and Steve doesn't even know where Tony got the lube from but when Tony's breath hitches suddenly and his eyes slip closed as he swallows around Steve's dick he realizes Tony is fingering himself open, getting himself prepared
It really was unfair, too. Because he’d been so clever during the fight today, and nothing got Steve’s engine running like his lover being ridiculously clever. Living with the serum, he was used to having a higher sex drive, and getting more boners at inopportune times. But something about watching Tony today had completely reset his brain to sex mode.
Bruce, tellingly, did not respond.
A pause, then JARVIS replied. “He has agreed to take your call. Shall I connect you?”
“J, run a full scan. Tell me…” Tony couldn’t bring himself to say the words out loud. “Tell me if there are any abnormalities.”
“Maybe…”
It also had a metal cock, which could be stored inside, but now jutted out proudly from the sculpted pelvis. It was red and gold, naturally. Tony had built in options to heat the metal to body-normal or leave it iron-cold. It could also vibrate, and there were thirty-five thrusting patterns installed.
“Mike! Hi, It’s Tony Stark.”
.o0o.
“I mean, let’s be honest. Anyone who is attracted to guys on any level has thought about the real thing. There’s no way this would hold a candle to that, I mean, have you seen Steve’s abs? But it has got to be a close second.”
“Let’s go, then.”
Steve may have moaned or sobbed, he wasn't sure, but he knew that he couldn't come like this, and he wanted to come so badly, but Tony was in complete control and he didn't want to do anything to make Tony stop, to make Tony go back to the miniscule grinding motions from before
“No,” Steve denied, and Tony looked down to see what he meant. “Don’t keep yourself quiet. I want to hear you.”
“Tony, Tony, Tony,” Steve cried out, thrusting shallowly despite Tony holding him down. “Tony, m’ gonna–”
“Give our Captain thirty minutes or so. I have a feeling he’ll skip the debrief tonight. Romanov and Barton will be staying on base.” Tony appreciated that about Coulson. He didn’t like letting his people out of sight either.
“Listen, I noticed you’re going through my range programs a little bit faster than normal, and like, I know it’s a coping mechanism to shoot things, so. If you want I could update the system? Give you a little more to play with while you’re waiting for Thor to get back with his mom’s magic tea.”
“I’m safe, Steve. I’m in our home, with you.”
“Hey! Come here often?” he asks to Tasha in a mocking way, he steps on top of her, her armor grunts in protest “No, no, no, don’t get up sweetheart” he turns the heat up on one of his fingers and touches her chest plate “Is it me or is getting hot in here?”
“Shh! Keep it down, come, close the door”
“Yeah, sure, there’s also only one Steve right?”
Steve Rogers, the super soldier from the 40's, Captain America, has been beating a punching bag since two hours ago when the nightmares started to be too much to endure. Each swing is like a memory trying to be repressed until he tears the bag open.
“Tasha!!” she can hear Steve voice clearer, which means that he’s getting inside the house, she can’t have that, it’s too dangerous, super serum be damned, she shoots her soft repulsor at the heat signature of Steve inside the house to send him flying back, she falls with the house
Tony couldn’t move, but he was so grateful when Steve closed the final gap and pressed his lips to Tony’s. They kissed, and even though it was well past midnight, it was still perfect.
“Just, think about it, Tones. And maybe stop giving the guy such a hard time, yeah? He’s looking out for you.”
“They’re perfect,” He murmured, opening his eyes to meet Tony’s. His lover smiled up at him.
“Do you still have sex with other people?”
Tony watched Steve’s face grow pinched, and he couldn’t stop himself from opening his mouth. “It’s not, um. Anything. I shouldn't have called, really. I just. You know, we talked about. But. It’s fine, if you. Uh. Changed your mind.”
