The Count didn't have the faintest clue who that was, because in truth he had probably killed a lot of people's mothers over the years. A few things were clear, though. He was outnumbered, with a vampire at his back and the greatest swordsman he had ever seen in front of him - one apparently with a furious need for vengeance. Count Azazel was no coward, not generally, but he was also no idiot. He'd have to get away first, then perhaps gain the upper hand, or at least lose one of them.
The two angels realized what they'd revealed, and suddenly they were both lurching towards him with their Angel blades. But Dean was already moving. He jumped aside to expose the bloody symbol that had been hidden on the wall behind him.
Count Azazel blinked, having no idea why or how this vampire knew his name, or what he hoped to accomplish by saying it aloud.
You squeeze yours eyes shut and try to keep the flood at bay. "It's my fault. I should have told them that Jack wasn't well, that he might accidentally be a danger to himself and others but..."
Cas seems to read the anxiety on his face. "No, I mean, because you're going to get sick now," he explains.
Rowena felt quite fond of them all, which was a rather a new experience for the witch. So it was with a tinge of sadness that she spared a thought for the following day, when everyone was destined to go their separate ways.
"I know you don't love me, Dean, and I've never asked for it. But I've grown fond of you and want your happiness. But - if Castiel does not return- will you please consider me as an alternative to suicide? I still need someone by my side to run this kingdom and would be glad to have you."
The door of The Pit opened, interrupting Kevin's thoughts. Count Azazel strode in, surveying Kevin with yellow eyes.
The Queen's face lit up with recognition. "THE Dean Winchester? My brother never shuts up about you. Although…not in the best of ways. He plans to kill you, you know."
Loud sounds were coming from somewhere far off, perhaps on the castle grounds. Chuck looked distractedly over his shoulder towards the chapel doors.
Castiel smiled slightly. "Just a flesh wound, Dean. All things considered, I'm pretty pleased we managed without worse. Do you still have some borax, though? We can never be too careful in here."
Benny smiled. "You know, most people wouldn't give a vampire the time of day, even if they're reformed. You're really one of kind."
The usual angel guards were missing from their post when he got there, and it was then that the Prince finally knew terror. Hoping against hope, he hurried into the room that housed Amara's cell.
"Well, if that's the case," Benny said slowly, "then we need to go that way." He tilted his chin towards their left, through the overgrown trees.
, and apparently interested. Who knew Dean would be swapping solo movie night for something that was beginning to feel more and more like an awesome first date?
Once he was beyond them and in the castle, he began to walk more quickly, following the mantra of directions that were stuck in his head.
Her death opens the floodgates of burning hatred, his insides become an empty chasm to be filled with bodies and blood. Dean sees his look and, for once, is the reasonable brother.
A few more incidents on the job. He's enjoying the kill too much, more than he ever had before, they say. They don't like it.
Dean felt his spirits lift slightly. If he was being honest with himself, there was a part of him that was happy to hear that Cas was queer because he was cute, and it opened up the possibility of something happening between them. But mostly he was just happy to have someone he could hopefully relate to, at least about that one part of his life.
Rowena softened slightly. "I know, deary. I suggest you lot lay low for awhile, perhaps camp out somewh—"
But not Azazel. The Count had turned away from Benny when it became apparent who the real threat was. Now it was just the three of them. Castiel was somewhere out of sight, two guards had fled, and the rest were strewn along the floor, dead or dying.
Benny could not keep up with Sam. His side was bleeding freely - perhaps the wound was deeper than he thought. Certainly hurt like hell.
And so Dean tried the window lock to no avail, but when that was a bust, he couldn't help but revert to his natural instincts. He was still a hunter, and hunters got things done.
Cas peppers a few kisses along a sensitive spot on Dean’s neck, and tries to give him a moment to adjust, but Dean is well past that. “Move,” he commands, and though Dean’s on bottom, it’s somehow still Cas who submits to giving Dean what he wants, exactly what he wants.
Dean flushed, heat radiating from his neck to the tips of his ears. Cas raised his sword. "Didn't get the memo?" he challenged. "The wedding is off."
Amara nodded sympathetically. "Well, we're currently in need of Royal Guards, and you two are more than qualified. Although," she glanced at Castiel, "I've heard tell that the Dread Demon Cain has...gone to ground. Perhaps you would prefer the open sea?"
Rowena had no response to that, so she willfully chose to ignore it. "I'll go help the boys get ready. I'm sure they'll be down to fetch you soon," she said, then left Cas alone to wait.
Except, except, except. It never happened like that. At least, he's pretty sure it didn't. Not real. Maybe none of it was.
Count Azazel and the Royal Guards drew their own weapons. The Prince advanced menacingly on Castiel. He was a god. He needed no weapon.
There was a section of the castle in which Dean had never stepped foot. In fact, he had no idea that the lower chamber existed, or that Queen Amara herself was held captive there. For more than three years, she had been her brother's prisoner, her powers bound by an ancient spell.
The note had instead fallen into the hands of an unlikely trio. Rowena, Kevin, and Charlie had arrived at the castle after it had already descended into chaos. The main gate was open wide to all, and guards could be seen running this way and that, shouting at each other. It was clear there was some confusion as to who they were meant to be fighting.
Sam knew it was true. They decided to head back out, and by sheer luck or because they'd already handled most of them, they ran into no guards on the way. The stables too were unmanned , and together Benny and Sam brought out four horses.
Another dream. He's fighting Dean to a bloody end. They waited too long and he can't remember why he asked Dean for this. He doesn't want to be buried in this tight little box. The Mark is hungry. Dean's blood is on his fist. They've done this before.
As it turns out, The Empty may end up waiting on you for a very long time after all. Perhaps forever.
And then he placed a hand on Dean's shoulder and began pulling him along, although not as roughly as he could have.
The change this caused in Sam was something quite terrific to behold. Suddenly his power and fury came through in every thrust of his sword, faster than he had been, stronger, no longer tired.
He took comfort once again in Baby, brushing her coat and petting her sweet, trusting head. He loved that horse, and even more so now that it was his last connection to his father (whom he had not been able to see since the engagement), and of course, to Cas.
Chuck turned his gaze to Dean, his expression softening slightly. "I see. A misunderstanding! If that's the case, then I am indebted. He has returned you to me, and good timing too, with our wedding coming up so soon!"
It was less than a minute, but it felt like it had been an eternity when Castiel finally gasped and coughed aloud. It was a raspy, choking sound, dry as death, but Dean could not have been more thrilled to hear it.
The great thing about Prince Chuck was that he trusted very few with his secrets. The guards at the main gate had no knowledge of his more dastardly plans than Dean himself had until recently. They had no clue that the prince would very much like to see Dean dead in the near future.
Dean laughs in relief. "Hate to break it to you, Cas, but I'm already sick. My throat's been burning since I woke up. But guess what?"
Impossible to notice for most, Benny's sharp vampire senses picked up on a slight, familiar scent wafting through the air. He recognized it from the cliffside – The Man in Black. Benny looked nervously over his shoulder.
"Okay," said Charlie, and Kevin nodded his agreement. "But be careful, and try to meet us back in the front hall?"
"But have you ever considered that Castiel may not want you now? You were a bit cold to him when we left, after he fought so hard for you. You didn't even say goodbye."
. Cas takes his time, and Dean’s hand is in the angel’s hair as Cas bobs his head and takes him deep.
Dean, however, did not have much interest in the villagers. He had only a few hobbies - hunting monsters, riding Baby - his beloved horse, and teasing the former angel and current farmhand, Castiel.
They started to move, Dean following Cas at a quick pace. "I know a shortcut to my ship, just up ahead. You're not going to like it though."
Dean bit his lip, thinking hard. Queen Amara was a powerful goddess, and perhaps the only one that could rival Chuck. It was clear that the only reason the prince had not killed her was because they shared a cosmic blood connection. Hurting her could destroy him as well. It was no wonder he had trapped her and lied to the public about her health instead.
It's his turn to shrug. "Long enough to feel reasonably sure that it isn't going away. And yes, I did research. I wanted to be prepared, just in case. But I honestly didn't think…are you interested in this, Dean?"
"Sorry," Sam said. "It's just. By tomorrow it could all be over. All the time I've spent learning to fight and looking for the yellow-eyed man. It could really be done tomorrow, for better or worse."
"It's his own fault if he's not. I'll leave it to you then to do what he couldn't. Finish him. Your way."
“A book?” To tell the truth, he was a little disappointed, but tried not to show it. It had been a long time since he’d gotten a present that wasn’t somehow sports-related. “The Prince’s Groom,” Jack said, reading the title out loud. “Is this a girl book, Dad?”
"Dean, there's already like a 90% chance I get you sick from this. Stop touching everything and just tell me your damn password."
Without warning, The Count raised the back of his hand and struck Kevin hard across the face. The young man staggered backwards against the wall. Before he had any chance to defend himself, The Count had him by the throat.
Dean hurried over to them and sprayed liquid over each monster, be it body or head or both. Those with the ability screamed bloody murder as their entire being dissolved horrifically, leaving behind clothes, bits of bone and not much else. Dean, experienced hunter though he was, still had to resist the urge to gag.
Suddenly Chuck was aglow in a strange light. The ground began to tremble under foot and the sound of it was like thunder. From nowhere a lightning strike cracked and struck out at Amara, but a black smoke had erupted just in time to absorb the blow.
He was nearly to floor three – with no clear thought of how to find Dean except to go on – when he had heard the sound of the shattering glass. It was coming from the hallway off the nearest landing.
Chuck just had time to turn an incredulous look at the angel before Cas's eyes were glowing blue again. He lifted his hand and the Prince grew stiff as Cas's power enveloped him.
Benny, Sam, and Castiel traveled as quickly as they could towards the castle, although the wheelbarrow certainly did slow them down. They stopped only once, in the early afternoon, to eat the food that Charlie had packed. Much to Cas's embarrassment, Benny had to help him eat, since he still didn't have use of his limbs.
Azazel snorted like a wild boar. Kevin closed his eyes, waiting for further punishment, but it did not come. The Count removed his hand and let him slump against the wall. "Was that so difficult, Kevin?" he asked.
Dean gets up, heads to his medicine cabinet, and pulls out the aforementioned cold syrup and lozenges. He hands them to Cas. "Couple spoonfuls of this may help your nose situation," he explains. "Now go back to bed and I'll help you get set up."
Michael had let the guards try their hand, but he himself had tried to stay out of the conflict until absolutely necessary. He was afraid that in the chaos, either the giant or the vampire might get in a lucky shot and take him out. Which couldn't be allowed, since he was the keeper of the castle gate key, which hung around his neck.
"Mawidge," Gabriel began, intentionally mangling the word. "Mawidge is what bwings us to-gether to-day."
in closer. He has always seemed to love a good post-coital cuddle, or at least he always has with Cas.
Benny made one last valiant effort to turn the tables, but The Man was ready for the attempt. He quickly poked the syringe into the skin of Benny's forearm. He pushed the plunger down just as Benny gained leverage to flip him. Benny let out a groan before collapsing heavily on top of The Man.
She talks for awhile more about the girls, but doesn't let you avoid the real question for long. "Why are you here, Castiel?" she asks softly.
Sam pulled the dagger from his belly and pressed against the wound with his hand. He stepped forward, sword raised and pointed towards the Count. "Hello!" he shouted. "My name is Samuel, son of Mary. You killed my mother, prepare to die!"
He found himself praying that every knot would hold. There was no time to double-check them; every second Castiel sank farther out of reach.
The man who bested Crowley. Who had bested them all. He could find the yellow-eyed man, Sam was sure of it.
Michael's eyes flickered with interest. "Azazel is a scab. What the Prince sees in a demon like that I will never know. But as much as I'd like to see the fleabag get what's coming to him, I am duty bound to keep the likes of you out. Say goodbye to the vampire."
Dean meets him there about ten minutes later, arms full of supplies. He sets down his laptop, which is open to Netflix, and places it down next to Cas on the bed. Then he sets down the glass of water and box of tissues on the side table, along with a plastic bag.
Sam was faring a little better, but quickly getting worn down. Constant parrying, his feet dancing like they were on hot coals, every move immediately followed by another to prevent attacks from landing.
The Prince turned back to Dean and Castiel. He put a hand on Dean's shoulder. "Farewell, then," he said to Cas. "The Count and Guards will stay and see you safely to your ship."
"I sincerely hope you find him someday," said The Man. He stood up straighter. He put the waterskin away and this time, when he reached for his sword, Sam didn't stop him.
They resume the movie. They watch Westley return from the dead and Inigo avenge his father. They watch Buttercup and Westley finally reunite and Fezzik save the day with four white horses.
There was steel in his blue eyes as Casreplied. "I appreciate your concern. I really do, and I am grateful for what you have done for me. But Dean is what matters. I will risk whatever it takes, I will sacrifice everything for Dean. Even my life."
"They don't. But that's them, not me, brother." Benny paused thoughtfully. "Did you kill Sam? The giant?"
Now they’re getting hot and heavy again, and everything is going just about par for the course, until all of sudden Cas is leveraging his body and pushing back and possibly using a little extra angel strength to flip the script. And then it’s Cas above him, kissing hard and eager and dominant, his weight warm and heavy over Dean. It does feel good, but they haven’t done this in particular, and he’s not sure he’s ready for this new development.
Part of you really believed that he'd stop you from leaving. That you'd make it to the door and he'd say your name in that sad mournful way of his, and then he'd say sorry for what he said, that he didn't mean it, and you would say it's okay, you know and understand. You'd say you're sorry too, for Mary and Jack and for not being good enough to keep them safe as you promised. And he'd cry it out on your shoulder and you'd be strong for him, hold him until the broken pieces of both of you mended into something salvageable.
He can feel Cas watching him, and finally Dean says, "Listen, you can't sleep and I can't sleep with you coughing up a lung. And I know you should rest but laying here tossing and turning isn't going to accomplish that."
He cared not for the Count and had no grief for him, only bitter disappointment that Azazel had failed him as much as the rest. He kicked the Count's unmoving legs in a fit of petty anger.
Cas also stood and pushed in his chair. He helped Dean finish clearing the table, then leaned against the granite countertops to stare at Dean appraisingly.
And then a terrible shrieking began, and Dean felt something moving in the water just to his left. With horror, he realized —
Cas grinned slightly. It was clear he was enjoying having Dean as an audience. "I'm getting to it. 'I am not the real Dread Demon Cain,' he said. My name is Timothy, but no one would have been afraid of the Dread Demon Timothy. It's the name that inspires the proper fear, that leaves the legacy.' He told me that he had inherited the name of Cain and his ship from a man named Cain, who was also not the real deal. His real name was Ryan, and the name and ship had been passed down several times even before him. When the current Cain wants to retire, they choose someone else to take over."
Cas was ahead of him when it happened; he stepped on what had appeared to be solid ground only to find that it was very much
"Hello, boy," replied one of them, with an accent Dean couldn't place. "I'm Crowley, and my friend here is Benny. We've been trying to settle a bet, do you think you could help?"
Amara clutched her chest and let out a grunt of pain. But still she stood and even took a step closer to her brother. The smoke was all around her body, like a shield, and more strands grew like arms at her command. A few managed to spike sharply out at Chuck, and then two tentacles of smoke were wrapping around the Prince's neck.
"It would be my pleasure," said The Count. "But right now, we must get you back to your ship." Even as he said this, the Royal Guards were closing in a circle around Castiel. Most still had their swords at the ready.
He regained his breath, then stared daggers at the Queen. Lightning flashed again in the dark sky, menacing. The air smelled like burning metal. "Well, Amara, what now?" he taunted. "We can do this all day."
He needn't have bothered, Kevin had absolutely no intention of tangling with even the giant, let alone a bloodthirsty vamp.
"Cas!" Dean yelled. He made to run towards the angel, but Charlie had grabbed one of his arms to hold him back. He attempted to shake her off, but she clutched him even tighter.
Slowly but surely, inch by inch, Dean dragged them closer to the surface. It was getting even harder to breathe and he could barely imagine how Cas was getting along.
"Lay down our weapons and try to kill each other like civilized people? Alright then," The Man agreed. He dropped his sword to the side, and Benny likewise tossed Dean's Demon blade to the ground. The two men began to circle each other, arms up and ready, prepared to defend or attack.
"Um, fellas, shouldn't we get to the gate to meet Castiel?" asked Benny. "Quick get-away and all that?"
"Must have been a trick of the light," said Crowley, trying not to laugh. "Shall we drink? Me from my glass, and you from yours."
John Winchester coughed uncomfortably, but Prince Chuck paid him no notice. "Will you make me the happiest of cosmic beings and be my partner and husband?"
When they finished eating, they laid together and stared up toward the sky, watching the way the oak tree leaves rustled in the wind.
Cas nodded slightly in confirmation. "Well, the story I told you was true. Heaven's Great Council sent me to Hell as a human. They said the power of the angels would provide a good cover and distraction while I got the real intel. But I knew it was still part of my punishment for having fallen."
Benny grimaced and saw the same distasteful expression pass over their captive's face. "Man," Dean said, "I know your kind can't help it, but that's sick. If I got turned, I'd rather die than drain some poor bastard."
Chuck was ready for both Dean and Benny. He snapped his fingers once more, and both gasped and bent double just as they reached Cas, who was also still kneeling in the clutches of pain.
Dean shrugs a little. "I don't know, maybe once or twice a year for me? More for some people, less for others."
"I am not left-handed." Sam tossed the sword from his left to his right hand and caught it easily before renewing the fight, now with more energy than ever. There was power behind every swipe and every thrust. The Man in Black was breathing heavily as he attempted to protect himself, and at the first opening he saw, he retreated far back from Sam and away from the edge of the cliff.
It was enough. Because in the instant he was held by Castiel, Amara took the opportunity provided. The black smoke reached out again, and a thick stream of it curled around Chuck's whole body like a python. His arms were forced to his sides, and another tendril wrapped around his blade and yanked it from his hand.
Suddenly, the witch's hand began to glow on Cas's chest, radiating heat and light and – hopefully – life.
From what Chuck had gloated to her in his monotonous monologues over the years, it was clear that he had duped the entirety of Heaven. He had corrupted the Great Council and many of her Royal Guard, and lied to the rest. Even the common folk believed that the Queen was still in charge, yet too sickly to make public appearances. The queen had, he told them, appointed Prince Chuck to speak on her behalf.
Once again, Kevin found no will to disobey the giant, who looked almost unhinged with urgency. "It's the Queen's old Remedy Woman," he said. "She lives in a crappy little shack not far from here. If you follow the river to the east, you'll end up right at it."
But when she opened the door, she found a face she did not recognize. He was young and slight of build and had a sizable bruise on his left cheek. "Who the hell are you?" she asked.
"What about this?" asks Cas, pointing to the lower left of the screen. He glances at it, then back to Cas. "You want to watch The Princess Bride?"
He could not wait until Castiel regained his strength. They had to move, before Azazel could have any chance to slip away or do more harm. It was foolhardy, but the time had come to boldly take his vengeance.
The glass exploded outward and the drawer went with it. The sound of shattering was music to Dean's ears - he had worried that Chuck might have made it impenetrable. With renewed purpose, he carefully began knocking out some of the remaining glass and threw one end of the sheet out the window.
Benny was startled, not in the least because he'd never seen Sam cry before. He laid a hand on his friend's shoulder. "But – how do you know?"
been the one to find the note, for at that time he was still being rather unceremoniously dragged through the halls as Benny and Sam took turns fighting off guards and pulling him along.
Rowena set immediately to work. She began to gather materials from around the room. She pulled some ingredients from the cabinets and brought them to a small cauldron in the corner. She mixed everything together and with a twitch of her hand, she lit a small flame beneath it. A haze of purple smoke rose from the newly simmering concoction.
Just as he said it, Michael felt the point of an Angel blade against his own back. "Drop it, Michael, old friend."
It was a mess of splintered wood, but still they could just make out the shape it had once been. It was the remains of a dresser drawer, mixed in with shattered window glass.
Cas nods, eyes glazed and miserable, and something about that makes Dean just want to…just wrap him up or something. He resists the urge.
“Look, I’m not gonna lie. A few girls in the past got a little…experimental and -- it didn’t really do much for me. I’m just not sure...”
And then the day of the wedding dawned, bright and sunny. The ceremony was a hazy blur, but just like that, Dean and Chuck were married.
Castiel practically growled in frustration. "I don't care. We need to get to Dean. I have no doubt that Chuck intends to kill him. With any luck he'll wait until after the wedding to make some kind of big dramatic storyline, but I'm not going to give him the chance."
And it's stupid, really stupid, because he knows he can't help Cas and he knows it's just a cold, but he finds himself heading towards Cas's room anyway. His eyes are fairly well-adjusted to the dark by now, so he doesn't bother turning on any lights, not wanting to wake Sam. He knocks lightly on Cas's door.
He watched and waited until The Man in Black came into view. His eyes were alert and searching, but he didn't see Benny hidden among the branches. Suddenly Benny felt a wave of remorse.
And then, there it was. Even as a seasoned hunter who was used to finding small details, it would have been easy to miss. The section of wall was unassuming, and the large stone in the center was no different than a hundred other stones throughout the castle. But Dean knew its secret, and upon closer inspection, he could see the thin gaps separating that section of wall from the rest.
"I told you, Dean. I am indebted to you. All of you," she said, staring around at the wayward, mighty group before her. Then she looked down at Sam. "And that includes him."
Cas and Dean looked at each other, unsure of what to do or how to help. A little way behind them, Kevin and Charlie were also stunned, and Sam was still unconscious.
Benny let out a groan as he got a shallow slash in the abdomen. As a vampire, it wouldn't kill him, but it would slow him down. Which would still kill him, once they managed to get a chance at his neck.
Words from Prince Chuck's own hand. His cockiness had allowed him to write his schemes as stories, but Dean would make him regret this folly.
Much news was shared between all of them. Dean learned of Cas's untimely demise and resurrection, and Kevin learned that his his tormentor, The Count, had been justly killed for his crimes. Eventually, the details of the whole affair had come together for them all.
Rowena read their apprehension correctly. "You'll do fine, my dears. I saw the way you disarmed that guard without my help. Just stick together, alright?"
"If a hunter falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does his body make a sound?" And then Crowley's eyes flashed black.
Crowley looked over at Dean with a scowl. "You'd do well to mind your tongue, if you don't want me to rip it out of you."
Sam paced at the top of the cliff. He hated waiting while Benny and Crowley handled Dean, who had proven to be difficult and potentially dangerous. Sam needed this to go as planned so that his portion of the demon deal would be complete.
Dean stood up from his spot on the ground and heaved a heavy sigh. He pet Baby's head, hoping it would not be for the last time now that his mission was more dangerous than ever.
I'm not going to lie, fight scenes are definitely difficult for me... Anyways, reviews always appreciated!
The first thing Sam did was reach for his sword. Not because he was fearful, but because it was a comfort to him. It had been his mother's, after all. The hilt was cool and reassuring in his grip. Slowly, he sat upright. He looked from face to face with increasing wonder and confusion. Finally, his gaze landed on Benny.
Pain could do wondrous things to humans, angels, and demons alike. The Count loved to test the tolerance of his subjects, and had worked long days and nights in an effort to perfect pain-inducing methods.
Dean decides to leave Cas alone for a bit, mostly because he knows there's not much else he can do for him and partly because he doesn't want Cas to think he's pitying him or something lame. That's not what this is.
By the very next morning, however, those little worries became irrelevant. What actually came to pass was something they had never thought of, and was far worse than what they had feared.
Blue eyes stare back at him from the other pillow. There's something so soft about Cas right now, in the early morning, with bed head and warm blankets surrounding them both. Dean feels his own nerves vibrate in his every cell, in every fiber of his being.
Benny shifted his weight from one foot to the other. He could feel the energy of the place, and while nothing seemed sinister, magical resonance had always made him uneasy. This was clearly the room in which Remedy Rowena worked spells of all kinds.
"I want to marry a mortal to further progress the relations between my kind and yours. You, Dean, are the very best of them. A righteous man, a skilled hunter, and from looking at you, probably a pretty good lay."
He considers going to grab the heater from his room when Cas says quietly, "We can share the blankets if you want. I don't mind."
Dean stared angrily back, rage building in his chest. He pulled at the bonds around his hands, but they didn't give way quite yet. "I have loved more deeply than a demon like you could ever imagine."
Dean felt grieved and guilty. He had intended to find out where Cas was and set off to rescue him immediately. But though The Pit was mentioned, clues as to its precise whereabouts were not. The Queen's location, however, was there in the fine print - including the secret entrance.
The hunter went off to find Prince Chuck to give him the letters, but he wasn't in his study. His desk was as messy as ever, parchment scattered around and blotches of ink staining the wood. Dean was grateful that Chuck had not asked him to read any of his work lately, but now that he was alone in the room, he felt his curiosity spike. What did a god find worth writing about these days?
Cas doesn’t need telling twice. He sinks into Dean, again and again, letting go of anything holding him back. The sound of the bed springs and Dean’s heavy breathing fills the room. Dean bites his lip when Cas hits his prostrate directly for the first time. It sends shivers down his spine and he aches for it, for more, for everything Cas can give him.
"The loser is nothing, only Dean matters," he replied, and so the group followed the trail that had been cleared of brush.
Sam opened his eyes, tears clinging to his eyelashes but refusing to fall. "That was The Man in Black," he said.
"Before we fought, he told me of his quest to avenge his mother. I didn't want to be the one to stand between him and achieving that goal."
When the wedding ceremony was over, after he'd sent Dean back to an empty but re-locked bedroom, Prince Chuck had set off at once to check on the Queen's prison chamber.
"Let's go see, then look for Castiel and Dean. I really hope Cas has found him by now, you know he won't leave here without out him."
"You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? You beat my giant, so you must be very strong, and strong men conceitedly think that death will not come for them. You'd likely put the poison in your own goblet, counting on your strength to save you."
Prince Chuck, Rowena knew, was not a good man. Not just because he'd fired her, though there was that. He was a killer. He was a warmonger. He was a pompous idiot. He was bad for both the Kingdom of Heaven
The spell was especially glitchy when people exited or entered. Had he been in his right mind, he probably would have been more cautious when stepping out the door, but as it was, he was not. He stepped out right into the path of a giant and a vampire, the 'scenery' behind him flickering to expose the truth of the building for all to see.
The Count smiled twistedly at his servant. "Kevin, we have a new subject. I'd like to you to dress his wounds so that he will be ready for The Machine later."
Benny had sudden inspiration. "Hey, are you a witch too?" he asked. "We're trying to get our friend here back to life, but we can't afford the ten thousand. Any chance you'd do it for cheaper?"
"I'm kidding, Dean. It's a nice thing to do for him." Sam's look of open sincerity is too much, and Dean suddenly thinks he'd prefer the teasing.
There are hunters you know who once lived in the bunker as well, but the ones still alive have no trust for an angel and you don't blame them. They only ever tolerated you because a few people they admired once vouched for you.
Count Azazel scowled. He caught the eye of the Guard directly behind Cas, and before the former angel could even turn, he felt the blow directly to the back of his skull. He crashed to the ground, sight and mind going dark all at once.
"Do you need some aspirin? I have some in my medicine cabinet -" he says, already moving to get up. Cas stops him with a hand around his wrist.
"Listen, Castiel," said Chuck, sounding almost regretful. "It's not personal, alright? You just don't fit with what I'm trying to accomplish. What you and Dean have together, that love? It's the stuff of storybooks, the stuff of happily ever after."
. He can’t help it; he thrusts into Cas’s mouth, several times in fact, and the angel takes it like a god damn champ.
He shrugs. "Metatron gave me the knowledge of it. It sounds highly amusing and relaxing, but I've never had the pleasure of watching it for myself."
"That was level one," said Azazel. "I may one day go as high as five, but I'm not entirely sure what it might do to you. So now, if you could rate your pain for me? Don't be shy."
He'd seen her before, in the village, and believed her name was Hannah. He watched Hannah sidle up to Castiel beneath the tree. She flashed a smile Dean could see all the way from his window, and he saw Castiel return it graciously.
"Sort of. I'm not sure if you're aware, but Cain has a passion for sailing nearly as much as he has a passion for torture. He took me to his ship. I wasn't allowed to leave it, and I'm ashamed to say at that point I was too afraid to try. But from then on he was nothing but gracious to me. I met his crew and I became an apprentice, I guess? I helped the chef cook, and scrubbed the deck, and learned about sailing. In the evenings, he taught me the ways of the sword. I certainly wasn't very good at first," Cas said with a small smile.
They reached the base of a large cliff. The ship in the distance was edging closer. It was definitely following them.
was situated outside of Baby's stable stall, and the truth of the last three years was staring him in the face.
Dean rubbed his face in agitation. He should have known it would not be that easy. "Okay, so…to get your powers back, we need a witch?"
Something hard in his reach, too hard. It cracked in his grip. Brittle. A bone, he knew it was the bone of someone long dead and buried. Dean dropped it and continued his blind search, attempting to swim through the immaterial sand.
The crowd clapped and cheered loudly. Except one man near the front of the crowd. Instead, the older man booed and jeered at them with a raised fist, anger in his eyes. The Prince took notice at the same time Dean did. "Arrest that man," he said to the guards.
Cas is alternately licking and sucking, doing just about everything to drive Dean crazy. It’s working,
Sam and Benny had left the former angel a ways outside the castle grounds so that he could regain his strength during the battle. The plan was that Sam would go back for him once the gate was clear, but there was Cas now, somehow managing to stand on his own two feet.
As Chuck spoke, his rage grew and the pain the three were suffering intensified to unbearable levels.
Dean sulked for several weeks after Castiel's departure. He found no more pleasure in hunting the monsters of the Wood, took no joy in it. He found himself more often than not at the bottom of a long drink, numb to the world. His father urged him not to lose himself to grief.
Though Uriel was just as bored with his post, he could never find the candor of Zachariah. "You're blaspheming again, Zachariah. You're lucky the prince is not here."
The Man took the two wine goblets and took back the vial, then turned away from Crowley so that he could not see what he was doing. Then he returned the goblets to the ground between them, setting one in front of Crowley and the other directly in front of himself.
Benny made as if to leap left, but then swerved in midair to catch The Man to his right. He'd gotten hold of his arm and wrenched it backward, but The Man managed to spin out of his grip and used the remaining momentum to kick out once again. This time his heavy boot connected with Benny's kneecap. He groaned and went down. The Man was on him in an instant, wrestling him all the way to the ground and pinning him there.
"Well, Your Highness," said Dean. "Cas and I have been discussing this for the past few days. Before this all began, we wanted to travel throughout Heaven together and then settle down eventually. We still want that."
Dean sighed. It was rare that he had unexpected visitors, and he was tempted to ignore it, but in the end he thought that might be too rude, even for him. He went and opened his door, and found a somewhat familiar-looking man standing there in the darkened hall.
Then he turned his head to the other side and found a pair of dark determined eyes staring hard at him.
Kevin pulled the vial out from his pocket and showed it to Rowena. The witch took it from him. Just like Kevin, she too could feel the raw power she held in her hands. She thought about what the boys were facing, and how much of a difference something like this could make.
Chuck had searched much of the castle for Amara, and yet the only things he found were signs of general battle and havoc. Some of his best guardsmen lay dead in the halls, and when he found Azazel in the same fashion, he was blinded by rage.
"Who says I'm here to help you," said The Man, and Dean was taken aback by the sudden cold tone. He was even more thrown when The Man grabbed him by the arm and began to drag him along, just as his other captors had done. "I'm taking you to my ship. So this Prince you love so dearly can keep his money."
"Goodbye, boys!" said Rowena, waving as the small group took off down the road, Benny walking and Sam pushing the wheelbarrow with a disgruntled Castiel in it.
Sam made excellent use of the rocky terrain, moving with more grace than most would think possible for a man his size. He was fast on his feet, but his sword was even faster. Still, The Man in Black was managing to parry every attack. Every time Sam thought he'd gotten the upper-hand, he was proven wrong by a countering flash of steel.
"Alright," said Benny. He wasn't honestly sure what to do with himself now that Crowley was gone, but sticking by Sam was the only thing that made sense to him. "But let's get you sobered up first, huh?"
Dean was all too happy to have Castiel at his beck and call. He loved to make Cas do a variety of mundane chores for him. Castiel never once complained. He'd merely look at Dean, with those eyes that were the color of the sea before a storm, and say, "As you wish."
Cas nods, then smiles reassuringly. “That’s okay, Dean,” he says, sliding off and coming to rest beside him on the bed. He runs a hand affectionately through Dean’s hair. “But maybe think about it, for the future? It’s just, the thought of being inside of you…” he trails off, rapidly starting to blush.
Sam eyed the leftover rope that was resting near the edge of the cliff. "I could do that," he said. "But will you take it? I'm actually only waiting around to kill you."
She could help him. She could get them into the castle and protect him on his mission. Together they would be much more likely to get the grace to the fallen angel. It would be dangerous. It could even be suicide.
Chuck turned to face Amara, who was gazing stoically at him through the bars of her cell. "Sorry you had to see that, Sis," he said. "But don't worry, there shouldn't be any more visitors bothering you."
Since Dean had stopped ordering him around, Castiel found that he had a lot more spare time on his hands. He spent much of it reading under the old oak tree just across from the farmhouse. Dean couldn't help but watch him from his bedroom window and admire him from afar.
And then the Prince reached out and placed a hand to Dean's head, putting him immediately to sleep. Before his body could crumple to the floor, Chuck snapped his fingers and relocated Dean to his bedroom. He would stay locked there until the wedding. For his own good.
"Well, after a month, he told me was done torturing me. I assumed he meant to kill me, so I said: Please, I have to live. And amazingly, he listened to me speak of you. He was quiet for awhile, thoughtful. Then he left me alone in my cell that night, and the next morning, he let me out."
Dean slides his arm around Cas and presses closer until their bodies are warm against each other. He leans over to whisper in his ear. "Totally worth it," he says, and kisses him again.
John Winchester watched the color drain from Dean's face as he read the news. "Son, are you alright?"
Charlie scowled at the witch. "Rowena, we don't need to scam people. Couldn't you please do the decent thing for once?"
Dean released the breath he was holding. He couldn't believe it was over, that they were free. He looked at Cas, and his eyes watered slightly as he felt the weight of the world leave him.
Cas glanced at him before returning his sights to the trees, wary of movement. "Well, you were right with your first guess, Dean. I am the Dread Demon Cain."
Sam turned away from the ugly scene and began to walk back the way he had come, through the broken double doors. He kept his fist pressed against his stomach wound. He wasn't sure how bad it might be, but he was determined to see Benny and Castiel again, even if it was the last thing he managed to do.
Cas turned towards him, beaming. "Then you aren't married, Dean, and we are quite free to...if we ever wanted. Officially."
To Benny the vampire, it was as loud as a bell clanging against his head. He and Sam were together in the forest, searching for the alleged secret dungeon. Benny put his hands over his ears to drown out the noise, and was surprised when Sam did not do the same. Instead, his large friend closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, as though concentrating with every part of himself.
Dean was far too used to demon showboating to be intimidated. "I just want you to know that, in the unlikely event that I don't break free and kill you all, Prince Chuck will find you and do it anyway. He may be a little self-centered, but he is a powerful being who won't take too kindly to the kidnapping of his future husband."
"I will only say this once, Chuck. We were - are - family, in spite of the way you have treated me. You and I both know I cannot kill you and you cannot kill me. But...I can make you hurt, if I have to. Surrender yourself now and it won't come to that."
It echoes. And then Dean reaches for him, his palm settling on the nape of Cas's neck, pulling him close, lips bridging the gap. A tingling down Cas's spine. Joy. "Come to bed, Cas," Dean says. A whisper, a plea. A prayer.
, thought Dean. His father had never been the same since he lost his wife several years prior. John tried to be a decent father, but he was often distant and left the farm for days on end. By the time Dean was a teenager, he was essentially raising himself.
Though Dean had suspected that Cas was looking for him, he didn't think it was smart to wait in the very room in which Chuck had placed him.
"Or stay with us!" interjected Charlie. "It'll be nice to have some other company. You know, Rowena has been sulking since the Prince fired her, but you guys really liven the place up. Well, except him, I guess," she said, nodding awkwardly to Castiel's sleeping form.
This chapter has some canon-typical violence. Monsters get the brunt of it, and I don't think it's exceedingly descriptive/graphic, but I'd say it is more so than other chapters so far. Figured I'd add a warning to be safe.
Crowley began to shake with laughter. "You nitwit. You only think I chose wrong because I switched the goblets when you weren't looking! You should have known better than to challenge me! You may be good, but I'm Crowley!"
Weeks passed. Dean awoke each morning and worked the farm. He hunted at night, killing all monsters that strayed across his path. He drank himself to sleep.
Two people were running towards them from the castle. Dean braced himself for a fight, but the concern on their faces made him think that they were perhaps friends, not foes.
Rowena sighed. "It's admirable, I suppose. Foolish, but admirable. I'll never understand you heroic types."
"Good to hear," Benny said. "Now, about the rest of this plan. I know you guys wanted to fight, but after everything, I think running is our only chance."
It was hell, it was unbearable, it was the worst pain he'd ever known. It was pressure and heat and sharp as a knife to his every nerve, every organ, every atom of his being.
Dean closed his eyes and braced himself for pain and torture, but then a crashing sound off to their right made his eyes snap open again.
Dean and Sam nodded their agreement. Dean took Baby's reins himself, and the group made their way towards the front of the castle.
Cas felt a heaviness return to his heart. He'd used up a lot of energy getting to this point, and had placed a lot of stock on reuniting with Dean in person. But still, there was no other choice. He agreed to the plan and left the door, walking back to the stairway. His legs were feeling weak and shaky again, and his breathing was coming hard.
Dean took a moment to process all that information. It was a lot to digest, but in the end, only one part of it really mattered. "I'm glad you made it out, Cas. I'm glad you made it back to me."
Prince Chuck's eyes went wide and wild. He snapped his fingers immediately, attempting to banish Amara back to her cell, to be locked away again.
The Man grinned slightly. "In your dreams," he said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a syringe with a deep red liquid in it. "I do apologize if this counts as a weapon."
This one was ugly as sin, a big male Leviathan, scabbed face and dark eyes. "Hello, human," it said. "Ready to die?"
It was supremely uncomfortable to be unable to move while a gang of people gawked at him. Cas felt exposed and angry. His eyes found Sam, who was hovering near him. "I thought your job was to kill me. Why bring me back?"
"She's not a witch, she's my –" Rowena couldn't seem to finish the sentence. There was suddenly awkward tension in the room. Charlie had narrowed her eyes.
The fire in Sam's eyes burned hot and then turned into a beaming grin. The difference it made to his face was remarkable; he now looked more like an overgrown puppy. Without warning, he threw his arms around Kevin in a bone-crushing hug.
The Count produced a piece of parchment and pen from his pocket and marked down a note. "Very good," he said.
Soon enough, they had made it to the top of what should have been the insurmountable cliffs. They hurried out of their harnesses, and Crowley grabbed a blade from his pocket and began cutting through the rope. The Man in Black was more than three quarters of the way up.
Cas doesn’t answer, instead positions his body over Dean’s. His eyes are dilated times a hundred, and if Dean didn’t know any better, he’d say that Cas looks downright hungry. He can feel Cas, hard against his thigh.
Rowena, who had some knowledge of the castle from her Remedy Woman days, lead the way. Though it was Castiel they were searching for, the intended destination was the hunter-groom's bedroom. What better place to look for the fallen angel, who was himself searching for his love?
Dean sighed. He would not risk the safety of his only family, and since his own happiness was already out of range, he felt apathetically resigned. He met Prince Chuck's gaze. "I can be your husband, Prince Chuck, but you must be aware that I can never love you."
Cas nodded his head in stoic acknowledgment. Dean said, "But, Your Highness, may I ask - where is Chuck? Is he really secure?"
Queen Amara nodded, and then moved on to Kevin. He looked at her nervously. "Kevin Tran. Your bravery in helping return Castiel's grace was instrumental in Prince Chuck's defeat. I thank you for that. However I confess that I'm not sure what to offer you in repayment. So please, name your request."
The Man in Black was making progress pulling himself up the cliff, but it was certainly slow-going. Sam pulled out his sword and slashed the air, his footwork precise and steady.
"I believe we are at an impasse," said Crowley. "You're trying to take what I have rightfully stolen. I'm no match for you physically, and you're no match for my intellect."
Castiel was slumped in the giant's strong arms. "This is ridiculous," he said, head lolling awkwardly to the side.
Dean turned away from the sickening sight and back to the others. Even the bodies of the ones that had been decapitated were still crawling towards their severed heads. Dean wasn't surprised – the lore said they could survive beheadings and put themselves back together like some nightmarish puzzle.
The young man went and retrieved a towel and a small vial of diluted angel grace. He set to unbuttoning the man's shirt to have better access to his wounds. He soaked the corner of the towel in the grace and began dabbing at the torn skin.
He stripped his mattress and tied some of the sheets together, then tied one end to the sturdy leg of the bed. It wasn't likely to get him all the way down to the ground, but it would get him lower, and he might just have to risk a rolled ankle if it came to jumping.
Prince Chuck made a show of thinking it over. "Alright. I'd never wish to cause you distress, Dean. He will be returned to his ship and free to go as he pleases."
When a knock came to their door for the second time in as many days, Rowena knew it couldn't be a coincidence. Something must have happened to Castiel, Benny, and Sam, and now they needed more magic. She sighed. That was the problem with being generous. People always needed more, and it was exhausting. Even though she liked the trio, she was going to have to cut them off after this. Healthy boundaries are important, after all.
"Cas, I didn't know what soup you'd like. We have chicken noodle, split-pea, tomato, chicken and dumpling…"
Cas smiles, then reaches down and places a finger at Dean’s entrance. He watches Dean’s face as he sinks in, gentle but deep. He allows Dean a moment to adjust. “This is weird,” says Dean.
Dean felt white hot rage shoot through his stomach and into his chest. He pounded down the steps of the farmhouse and across the yard until he stood in front of the two.
played as a terrible mantra in his head. "He will come back for me," Dean said, with more certainty than he felt.
He tags Dean’s prostate again, and the grunt the hunter lets out as he comes is completely unguarded, raw and desperate. He clenches around Cas, and the combination of that and the beautiful sights and sounds and emotions – it’s all overwhelming and perfect. Cas thrusts again and follows Dean into oblivion, his climax strong enough to practically see stars.
Dean closes the gap between them and then he's kissing Cas, sweet and slow and soft. Cas melts into it for a few moments, but then pulls away, frowning. "You shouldn't have done that," he says.
Sam nodded. "If we even can run. Not sure where we could go that Chuck won't find us. But you're right, we have to try. We'll need a quicker get-away. I saw the stables out back, maybe we can ride out on some horses?"
Benny, Dean, and Cas regained their footing, but they might as well have been invisible for all the notice Chuck paid them now.
Rowena gave him an unmistakable look of pity. "Don't take this the wrong way, dear. It's just…all the fallen angels I've ever known – they act rashly. They take their new mortality for granted, and it usually costs them greatly. So. I just wanted to ask. Are you sure taking on Chuck is worth the risk? Even with your angel powers it would be difficult, without them…"
Following the river with the wheelbarrow and its cargo was difficult, but Benny and Sam managed pretty well, occasionally taking detours over less rocky terrain as needed. Luckily, they had not run into anyone along the way and had thus avoided any prying questions about the body.
Dean shook the cannister to test it. He had used quite a bit but there was enough left to get them through in a pinch. He hoped it wouldn't be necessary, though.
The large man sat outside the local pub, a tankard of mead in one hand and his sword flashing carelessly in the other. He was slurring his words and yet still amazingly spry whenever anyone from the brute squad tried to approach.
He would have to hurry, though. Chuck would notice the missing story soon enough and might very well figure out Dean's intentions.
Cas is on him before Sam or Dean can get there. A hand to his throat. Eyes bulging. Someone screaming. Sam and Dean manage to rip him away. Cops are called and they flee before they can be arrested.
A woman's voice, close at hand, rang out across the grounds. There was power and strength in every word; not a hint of fear could be detected.
Dean shook Prince Chuck's hand and had to hide his disgust at how sweaty it was. "And yours," said Dean.
It was a moving speech, though Cas couldn't help but lament that he was forced to give it while lying flat and motionless on his back.
"This is my finest work," said Count Azazel. "It is the greatest instrument of pain known to man, angel, or demon. It will burn your insides and for every twist of this dial -" he pointed to a knob with numbers etched around it, "you will lose a year of your life. We'll start slow though, shall we? Prince Chuck has informed me that he doesn't want this to be quick in any way."
"Well, here goes nothing," said Sam. With that, he stepped up to the door and knocked. Some of the rotting wood fell away against his knuckles.
As they had walked, Purgatory had grown more oppressive around them. Rustling from everywhere kept them on edge, and Dean wasn't sure if he'd rather just face some monsters and get it over with. Still, the hunter in Dean couldn't help but appreciate Purgatory. In a place with only monsters, no innocents could be caught in the crossfire. "It's not so bad," he said casually as they ambled through. "It's pure, you know?"
Sam lowered his sword slightly, ready to surrender if it was needed to save Benny's life. "Listen, sir, we have no qualms with you. I'm seeking the murderer, Count Azazel."
Benny, Sam, and Dean had just made it back to the main gate when Prince Chuck appeared directly before them.
They were surrounding Dean, teeth bared and long shriveled fingers reaching for his arms and face. In that moment, he knew he had met his untimely end. All he could hope for was for it to be quick, and that somewhere beyond Heaven and Hell, he would at least be reunited with Castiel again.
Kevin didn't make it a habit to talk to the subjects - it was too painful to know them - but for some reason, he could not resist this time.
Queen Amara remained where she was, and Prince Chuck felt a sinking of his gut. He tried again, but again there was no result, not even a flicker.
It was a hard pill to swallow, she thought. Not that her brother would stoop so low - he had always been a rat - but that no one had bothered to look for her. Had she been that bad a Queen that she had simply not been missed? The angels had always been Chuck's lot, so she wasn't surprised they obeyed him without question. The mortals knew less than nothing about the politics of the kingdom. But the demons? She had always been fair to them and had let them run Hell as they saw fit. She knew that balance needed to be maintained, unlike her brother, who sought wars for his own amusement. But not one demon, nor witch, or even a lowly vampire had ever sought to save her.
The guard by Benny turned at the sound of his own name, and then Sam saw those awful yellow eyes for himself.
Hell, maybe you'll find a woman, probably some desperate prostitute, and she'll be all too willing to distract you and take your money.
His eyes were glowing, a radiant unnatural blue shining from their sockets. And on his back, great black wings were unfurling outward. They were massive and powerful-looking.
"Beg your pardon, sir," said Hannah, blushing crimson. "I'll just be going now and leave Castiel to his work." She shot an apologetic glance at the former angel, who looked altogether unaffected by her departure or even by Dean's anger. He stood up, straight as a rod, and looked at Dean with those endlessly blue eyes. "As you wish," he said, and made to move towards the stable.
So for now, Kevin would do as he was told. His eyes strayed to the man on the table. Despite the injuries to his chest and arm, he looked strong. But Kevin knew he would not be strong enough to endure what was coming, and pitied him.
Count Azazel nodded, as if reproaching a small child. "Good," he said. Then he gently pressed Kevin's rapidly-bruising cheek. Kevin had to repress a shiver at the touch of those awful fingers. "I trust you will need no further reminders."
Kevin had had to close his eyes and ears when Castiel died, and yet he was still sure that it would haunt him until his own dying day. Now, though, he was slightly more relaxed if only because he was alone. He had the unsavory task of building a funeral pyre ahead of him, but at least it would be a distraction.
"Tell you what. It's a pretty full house but we've still got couch space. And well, I guess you don't even need it, do you? You don't sleep, right?"
Dean realizes too late that he didn't think this entirely through, didn't consider the fact that the only logical place from which to watch a movie in this scenario is right beside Cas on the bed.
"Wait. Stop," Cas says. "I don't think we should do this if you're not sure. I've done some research and found that it's incredibly important to receive verbal, enthusiastic consent in these types of situations."
It was hard to see since the person was backlit, but Benny's sharp eyes missed nothing. "I'll be damned," he said. "It's Dean."
Kevin carefully released his grip on Cas, and Charlie instinctively braced the former angel to compensate while Kevin dug around in his pocket.
Benny and Sam looked at each other, then back to Amara. Sam sighed slightly. "You know, I was hunting the yellow-eyed man for so long, I'm not sure what to do now."
They reached for each other at the same time, Cas pressing a hand softly to the skin of Dean's cheek. "I told you I would return for you. Why didn't you wait for me?" he asked softly.
"No!" Dean woke up yelling. The wedding was still two days away. His heart was hammering in his chest, loud as thunder. Cas. He let him go. He let him go.
Castiel smiled slightly, though it didn't reach his eyes. "They have agreed to return my wings and powers to me so that I may fight for them. And when the war is done, they will be mine to keep, along with my freedom. We can fly anywhere together, travel wherever we desire, and make a home."
Benny chuckled. "Alright, off with you," he said. "Any more goodbyes and we'll be standing here all day."
And you know that this why you sought out Jody Mills. She's got experience in anchoring the untethered, and patching holes in sinking ships until they're seaworthy again. You don't know if it's enough for someone like
John and Dean stood at the doorway as Prince Chuck rode towards them, followed by his Royal entourage.
When the Prince walked into Azazel's secret dungeon, the Count was allowing Castiel a brief recovery from the torture, though it hardly felt that way to Cas. His whole body was in pain beyond anything he'd ever known. His insides felt like fire, his bones felt heavy, his skin felt torn to shreds - but no physical damage could be seen on his body.
The more Prince Chuck thought about his current situation, the more furious he became. Crowley was supposed to murder Dean, Hell would be to blame, war would break out, and the ensuing events would be great fodder for his stories. The clash of angels and demons, my, just think of the drama!
Chuck looked up from his writing. "I've never intended to force you into anything, Dean. You have free will, after all."
Prince Chuck merely sighed and snapped his fingers. The boys were thrown back by the unseen force and fell away into crumpled heaps upon the ground.
"Aye," said Benny, but he didn't look pleased about it, and watched rather forlornly as Crowley pulled Dean away.
The lid opens. Too bright. He closes his eyes. Hands on him, shaking him. "We found a way, Cas. I told you I'd come back for you."
“Hi,” said the man awkwardly. “Uh, my name is Castiel Novak. I just moved into the apartment across from yours.”
It was all in a letter with the Heavenly seal upon the envelope. War had not yet broken out, but tensions ran high between the two kingdoms. Castiel's troop had been sent on a secret mission past Hell's gates and been discovered by the Dread Demon Caine.
Suddenly Dean's pain was gone, a mere ghostly ache of itself remaining. He turned his head and saw a hooded figure silhouetted near the open gate.
"Aye aye, Captain," he said. Benny paused to retie Dean's hands, and the hunter groaned at having been discovered. He had been so close to loosing the knot again. "Brother, give it a rest. There's no way out of this one."
Rowena opened the door. The group made perfunctory introductions, and then Sam reached into the wheelbarrow and hoisted Castiel's prone form into his arms. When they entered the shack, both Sam and Benny were shocked to see the outer appearance was entirely misleading. The interior was practically regal and appeared much larger on the inside than out. There was a grand staircase to the left, a marble statue of what appeared to be the witch herself, and a magnificent chandelier hanging above their heads.
After their fiery entrance, Sam, Benny and Cas found more trouble within the castle itself. There were extra guards in the hallways, and Sam had a hell of a time fighting them off. Benny helped when he could, but mainly he had to keep Castiel on his feet.
Night had finally fallen just as they arrived at what could only be described as a 'crappy shack.' The vampire and the giant stared at it. It was falling apart. The windows were shuttered and part of the roof seemed to be collapsing. There were spiderwebs on the eaves. It looked very much like no one had used it in some time, except for the fact that smoke was rising from the chimney.
They don’t say it aloud, but they don’t have to – it’s in everything they do and it’s in the way Dean says his name. It always has been.
"Don't touch me!" he snarled. "I remember you! You're a coward, aren't you? I beat you in a sword fight so you poisoned and paralyzed me! You'll pay, I swear it."
Sioux Falls is a reminder of better times, and you didn't exactly plan it, but you find yourself there anyway. There's a slim chance you'll find a friendly face, and you'll take those odds.
"And now, I am strong enough. I will never stop searching for the yellow-eyed man, and when I find him, this time I will not lose. I will say: Hello. My name is Samuel, son of Mary. You killed my mother. Prepare to die."
Unsurprisingly, this started a bit of a panic at the main gate. Demons were one thing, but THE Dread Demon Cain was infamous. And a massive flaming figure might alarm anyone, no matter the name.
After a few weeks of deep depression, Dean caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. He seemed to have aged a decade. Once clear skin had been replaced by lines of worry. He'd gone soft around the middle, no doubt from the excessive drink and lack of hunting.
The Prince narrowed his eyes. The light glowing around him transformed into several bolting beams. They pierced through some of Amara's dark smoke.
Cas took a bite of his burger. “Mmmm,” he hummed. “You were right, these must be your specialty. It’s delicious.”
Two hours later and Dean can't sleep because Cas can't sleep. He can hear the former angel's hacking coughs from all the way down the hall. They sound painful as hell, and Dean's heart is twisting at the sound.
It was a wretched voice, a broken one, and Dean could not bear to look at the pain he was causing Castiel. But this was how it had to be. He could sacrifice his own happiness for Cas's life. He could sacrifice anything for that.
Gabriel grinned a little too heartily. He looked over at the grooms and at the audience behind them. There were members of Heaven's Great Council, the Royal Guard, a smattering of rich noblemen among the crowd.
He departed, and Count Azazel turned to Kevin. "Dispose of the body," he commanded, before he too left the dungeon in an angry huff.
Their world came back to them. The ocean was lapping against the rocky shore, the sea air smelled sharp and refreshing compared to the vaguely decomposing scent of Purgatory. The sun was rising and beginning to reflect beautifully off the water. Just down the shore, Castiel's ship was still anchored and swaying with the tide.
His mask had come off during the fall. He had a short beard that he hadn't had when he left, and he had aged just as Dean had in the last three years. But his eyes - how had Dean not recognized him? His angel had returned.
“Ah,” said Dean. “You’re right, that does sound like a pain. Come on in while I find you something.”
The giant was an even more imposing figure than usual, standing atop the wheelbarrow which added another two feet to his already massive height. And, as mentioned, he was literally on fire. The flames were licking over the Holocaust cloak, but Sam felt no pain. Benny was hunched behind him, pushing the wheelbarrow with all his might. Luckily, all eyes were on Sam.
Dean feels heat in his cheeks. "Don't make it weird," he says, "but yeah, you're welcome." Then he goes to see what type of soup options they have in the kitchen, while Cas scrolls through his Netflix choices.
Cas chuckles and Dean softens slightly – a little embarrassment is always worth making Cas laugh. He types in the password. Netflix is still open from earlier, and the two lean forward to peruse the options.
But Cas sniffles throughout and, halfway through, has to pause it for another fit of coughing. Once again, Dean can't help but feel an ache in his chest at Cas's mild distress (even knowing he's suffered far worse in the past). There is this crazy urge to comfort him, and Dean can't resist pressing a hand to his back and rubbing a slow circle there.
It didn't take long before Kevin found it. Near the back, on the third highest shelf, stood a vial. It was full to the brim with effervescent, swirling grace. It had never been diluted or used for healing, at least not yet. Written in small cursive letters: Castiel.
Dean did all he could do in the meantime - he wrote a note to Cas regarding Amara's imprisonment and tucked it under his pillow with a corner peeking out. Even if Dean couldn't get the Queen out before the wedding, perhaps Cas could.
Dean blushed. "Just, you know, everything should be in order in case we ever want to...officially, I mean."
He was indeed a giant of a man, legs and arms that went on for ages. He had luxuriously long hair and kind eyes, oddly enough. "Sorry about punching you, man. But you know, that's the job."
Rowena fought back her embarrassment. "Your brother fired me, Your Majesty. I believed what he told me - that it was under your command. He said I was clearly unfit since your illness was getting worse."
It was all he ever said, and it took Dean several months before he realized that when Castiel said, "As you wish," he really meant, "I love you."
Cas grinned. "Actually I swiped it back from that vampire after I knocked him out." Cas reached into his bag, pulled out the weapon, and handed it to Dean.
Benny agreed, and the two had started towards the front of the castle with the horses in tow, when a sudden sound of shattering glass erupted from somewhere above them. It was followed immediately by a crash directly in their path. An indistinct object had fallen to the ground, and warily they went to investigate.
The first thing Benny noticed was the blood coating Sam's shirt, and the way he was holding his fist against it. "You alright, brother?"
“I hate to bother you, it’s just, I was wondering if you had any extra flashlights or candles I could borrow? Mine are all packed up in boxes still and it’s kind of a mess trying to find them without any light to start with.”
Eileen dies. He didn't kill her. At least, he doesn't think he did. He's not sure. It's been years, right? He can't be expected to remember everyone he ever put in the ground.
Then she looked up and beamed at them. This note - calling for a witch to save the Queen, and detailing how to find her prison chamber - it was like fate. It was like a gift from, well, not God apparently, but someone far more helpful.
"My brother is in a prison of his own making. But his powers are bound now, and with Rowena's help, I have strengthened precautions against him. He will not be able to escape his cell nor get his powers back in the manner in which I did, not even if he tried. And trusted guards will be added to his security shortly."
Ten-year-old Jack Kline was laid up in his room, sick with the flu. Even though his whole body ached and his stomach felt gross, he wished his mother would let him out of bed. He was an energetic kid who loved baseball and climbing trees, and was not content to lay still. After three days of being trapped inside, even his favorite video game could not keep his attention.
The Man in Black sighed slightly, repacked his bag, and then turned to Dean. He removed the hunter's blindfold, and they both stood up.
He made his way down the first flight of stairs in this horribly slow fashion, and then the real trouble started. He felt a sensation of pins and needles start in his feet and progress upward. His body needed to rest...but no, he needed to move! Dean was waiting.
Angry tears filled Dean's eyes. He stood as straight and defiant as he could. "I died when he did," he said. With a great heave, Dean managed to rip free of the rope at last. "And you can die too for all I care." He didn't have a weapon anymore, so he did the next best thing and used his newly free hands to push Cain down the steep ridge.
Years ago, Castiel had disobeyed an order of Heaven's Great Council. As punishment, he was stripped of his wings and angel powers, and sent to live and work among commoners. Dean's father, John, who had no great love for Heaven's Great Council either, took pity on Castiel. He gave him his meager living circumstances. Castiel worked the farm, tended the stables, and of course, acted as servant to the young Winchester.
It only took a moment for Dean to get his head together. He looked around for anything available to anchor him. There was a tree close to what he assumed was the edge of the pit, and it looked sturdy enough, but there was no living vegetation on it. He hadn't noticed any rope in Cas's bag, either.
Castiel was still coughing, but he had opened his eyes. The expression he had was so tender as he allowed Dean to clean his face.
Dean swallowed. He didn't want to entertain the idea that Cas might not come for him. "Okay," said Dean. "If he - I'll write the letters."
The condescension infuriated Kevin, more than being struck. Even more than being forced to be a servant to cruelty. The Count was so damn smug, and Kevin's hatred was so deep that he was sure it would burn him up from the inside.
"Are we sure about this?" Benny asked. For now they were walking through a quiet hall, all guards subdued behind them for the time being. Cas turned his head to face Benny, and Sam looked his way as well.
Just as Sam opened his eyes and was about to ask The Man what he meant, he felt the hilt of the man's sword crash into the back of his skull. Sam collapsed onto the ground, vision replaced by the dark embrace of unconsciousness.
At night, he began to hunt again. The vampires of the Wood had grown bold in his absence, but he returned with a ferocity that was unmatched. He cut down those that strayed too near the village homes. He defeated werewolves, wendigo, all manner of evil.
He started with a hot bath. He scrubbed his body and face thoroughly, until he was raw and fresh, free of dirt and dead skin. The next day, he visited the local barber, and had his beard shaved away and his hair cut short and clean.
"Not remotely! Because everyone knows Michael was an archangel, and archangels are used to people not trusting them, as you are not trusted by me, so clearly I cannot choose the wine in front of you."
Charlie and Kevin took Benny's place kneeling over Sam, checking his pulse and fretting helplessly. The giant was getting paler by the minute.
It's a flimsy excuse, Dean knows it, and for once he doesn't care. He's already under the covers, crossing one more line tonight isn't going to kill either of them.
She pulled the bellows away, then leaned in to speak directly into Castiel's ear. "What's so important, handsome? What about this rotten world is so worth sticking around for?"
Cas coughs again, spastically bringing a tissue up to cover his mouth. After recovering, he says, "It was certainly more convenient. Especially with full power and wings – flight, near invincibility, and none of these mundane human aches and illnesses…"
Like now. Chuck wanted this fallen angel - this Castiel - questioned and punished. Azazel was more than happy to oblige.
They were at each other at once, every move precise, any mistake now certainly fatal. The Man in Black was unlike anyone Sam had ever fought. Another few steps forward, a few steps back, more clanks of steel colliding. Sam was definitely breaking a sweat just in his attempts to fend off his opponent.
"I can't marry you," Dean said without preamble. "I belong with Castiel. And if you say I must marry you - well, I don't intend to live without him."
There was nothing for it. He had no blade that would work on angel. On a good day, he might manage to wrestle a weapon away from one and come out the victor.
Sam returned his hand to his own stomach, and it was then that Dean noticed Sam's wound. "Man, should you even be walking?"
Benny was on a search too, but it was not going well. He had no idea where Castiel had got to, which was odd because, last he knew, the fallen angel barely had the strength to stand.
Sam took the crash into the next room with as much grace as he could manage. He quickly regained his balance and tried to scan his surroundings, but he was not fast enough. Count Azazel leaped out from behind a pillar and, with a practiced aim, threw a dagger in the giant's direction. It whizzed through the air and landed with an unthinkable sound in Sam's gut.
Sam and Benny smiled at the angel and at Dean who was beside him. Benny placed a hand on the hunter's shoulder. "This isn't goodbye forever, brother. I'm sure we'll see each other again, one way or another."
You're not sure time will ever be enough to fix this, but you don't mention it. "Thank you, Jody. You don't know how much this means to me."
This is what it's like to belong to nothing and no one. Your line is cut, and you are unanchored from them, from everything. Pushed and pulled by the whims of an unforgiving tide.
Back at Remedy Rowena's 'shack', the twelve hours were fairly inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. Rowena seemed to have warmed up to them and even shared some spell books and basic magic tips with Sam when he'd shown an interest in her work. Charlie was also a pleasant host. She made them tea and didn't even flinch when Benny contritely asked if they had any animal blood he might partake in instead.
The group hurried down the stairs. Castiel was awake on the table, but he had not moved an inch. Because he
Count Azazel had hurried to turn off The Machine, hoping to salvage what was left of his subject, but it was no use.
You find yourself missing sleep from the days of your brief humanity. You just want to rest. What would be even better would be the eternal, dreamless sleep you've been promised. The Empty has staked its claim and you'd welcome it now, the nothingness. But you know it won't take you like this. It wants you happy so the punishment can matter. It will not take you while this hateful misery is etched in your every bone and seeping from you like some foul odor.
Dean knew it was true, but he still hated it. He prayed Cas could hold out for him, and it pained him greatly not to be going directly to his rescue. If he had any inkling of where The Pit was, he would have gone without question, Queen Amara and her power be damned.
"Have you ever thought that this is overkill, Uriel?" Zachariah asked his companion. "Like, does Prince Chuck really need us to guard Amara when her powers have been bound, and no one has ever come looking for her?"
Sam used his long reach to extend from afar, prodding and slashing through the air. Soon he had forced The Man in Black to the edge of the cliffside and every step now became twice as dangerous. The rocks were loose beneath their shoes, and more than once they slipped dangerously close to disaster.
The man called Moose grumbled a bit but sped up his pace with the oars. He used his strong arms to maneuver them through the water, but the ship became larger in their vision even as they attempted to pull away.
"What the—" Sam began, but Benny turned his head upward. A figure stood silhouetted in a window frame, three floors above them.
They kissed with all the love and passion that had only grown in their three year separation. In that perfect instant, it was as easy and as necessary as breathing.
Dean felt encouraged enough to press into Cas’s space, and was elated when Cas leaned in even closer.
And that's how you find yourself at Jody Mills' home for wayward youth, and you know you can't stay for long (she has enough on her plate), but she's invited you in and that's something.
They all go to a diner one day. There's a man groping the blonde waitress. She's too scared and young to protest. Younger than Claire is. Was.
Having not known what type of soup Cas would like, there's about ten different cans spread out on the counter. So Dean's not that surprised when Sam jokes, "Starting a soup kitchen?"
When they made it to the outer courtyard walls, they ditched the wheelbarrow at the edge of the forest and snuck up the stairs to gain a better vantage point. It was not an easy feat, and Sam worried the whole time that they would run into guards along the way. Luckily, they met no one and were able to take in the scene below.
Steel clashed against steel and Sam downed three men in record time. Benny was holding his own as well, disabling his opponents, smashing legs and punching out fellows with his vampiric strength. They were outnumbered until they were not, and then one man was left.
Sam got to him first. He attempted to lay a reassuring hand on Castiel's shoulder, but it had the opposite effect.
"If you promise not to hurt him…if you return him safely to his ship and let him go…I will return with you. We can get married as planned."
He does check on him a bit before bed that night, though, just in case he needs anything. "How's it going, Cas?"
Cas bit his lip and his eyes shimmered. "There are rumors that the demons of Hell are plotting against the Kingdom of Heaven. The Queen has requested that every angel prepare for war and serve should the time come."
As they reached for each other, their hearts felt impossibly light and free. It is said that since the invention of the kiss, there have been five kisses that were rated the most passionate, the most pure.
Dean left the study and hurried out to the Royal Stables, where Chuck rarely went due to his hatred of the animal smells. Dean could probably read there in peace for hours, and he prayed that would be enough time to find something.
Dean looked back at Cas and Chuck, fear spiking through his heart. Cas might be an angel again, but Chuck was a god of immense power. Was there really any chance?
"You may have heard that my sister – Queen Amara – has taken ill. It is unfortunately true, and I fear the worst. Though I'd much prefer her return to health, I have to face the possibility that I will soon inherit the kingdom. And I have come to the conclusion that to instill the proper respect and admiration of the people, and to ensure my own happiness and safety, it is time that I married."
Cas noticed him at the same time Dean did. "I'll take care of that one," he said. "You finish the rest." He pulled off the bag on his shoulder and tossed it at Dean, who caught it. He shot him a questioning look. "Borax," Cas replied in answer, and the hunter understood immediately.
Chuck closed his eyes and forced himself to think properly. Amara was free, but she had no hope of recovering her powers without a witch. Therefore she must be fleeing even now, out of his grasp.
It's only when you make it to your truck that you fully realize how there's absolutely nowhere for you to go.
But Kevin forced a pitiful look onto his face. "No, sir. Sorry, sir," he said, though he was not sorry at all. He was fed up. He may not have been a fighter, but he could still bring about Azazel's end. He would just have to wait until the ace in his pocket could be played. He would need help, but he would make it happen.
She looked at Rowena and Charlie first. "Rowena, you helped me immensely. If it would please you, I would love to have you back as my Remedy Woman. With a salary twice what it was before, and luxurious accommodations here in the castle. Charlie, you are of course welcome to join her and fill your days as you choose. If there is any role you desire, it shall be yours."
The Count wheeled over a strange looking machine from the corner of the dungeon. It was connected to a pulley system, had many gears, and several wires coming out of it, which ended in little suction cups.
"Imagine how I feel, Dean. Angels don't usually…fraternize in this way…with humans. But I'd like to try to find out – if you're – if there's any chance here."
Sorry for the long delay, I've finally caught up to myself writing-wise. I do have enough ideas for the rest of the story though, so hopefully I can keep up some momentum. Thanks as always for reading!
He bore the Mark well. Dean knew Cas, knew The Mark, knew how to soothe - not his soul, of course, since he doesn't have one - but his entire being.
The Man in Black could hear the pain and sincerity in every word, the heaviness with which the giant spoke. "Throw me the rope," he finally replied.
The Count looked up at the Prince's arrival, while the shadow that was Kevin sunk further back into the corner. "Ah, your Highness. I didn't expect you to join us so soon. I've hardly had time to break him in," he said, nodding in Castiel's direction.
They have awoken together, beside each other, and something has changed. A cosmic tilt in the universe.
Dean was about to thank Cas but there wasn't time. Three more Leviathan jumped towards Castiel, at least one with a weapon. The former angel was able to knock two back with his sword, but the third managed to slash Cas across the chest and upper arm with a flailing dagger.
The witch looked at Charlie. Though things were complicated and undefined between them, Rowena could admit she had a soft spot for her. The woman who always believed in her. The woman that was always convincing her to do the decent thing.
Benny, Crowley, and Dean had made it further along and were now surrounded by vegetation. The trees blocked most of the sunlight and made everything look dark and wild. Crowley was hacking at some underbrush with a long knife, making a poor attempt to clear a path for them while Benny had Dean's own Demon blade pointed at him for extra security.
Though she was quite regal in a beautiful new gown, she looked at them as though they were not subjects, but dear friends. She stood up from her throne and spoke softly. "I've called you all here because I want to make offerings of gratitude to each of you."
“I’m sorry, Jack. It’s freezing out and you’re still sick. I don’t want you getting pneumonia on top of everything. Maybe you and your dad can do something else together.”
This pronouncement was met with silence as Castiel thought it over. His memories were coming back to him. That dreaded Machine…
He cursed himself for being so stupid. The castle was no use to him, and it was the grounds he must search now. He snapped his fingers.
. But there's a chance I may fail, and even if I don't, we need all the defense we can get. I will go down and free the Queen. But Castiel is somewhere in this castle, and he still needs his grace. You two should continue to look for him."
Gabriel hadn't volunteered for this, but generally as an angel, when the Prince said fly, you asked, how high. That didn't mean he couldn't have some fun with it, especially since Prince Chuck seemed far too preoccupied to punish him at the moment.
Sam engaged with four at once, which was generally his upper limit. Benny grabbed one before he could swing his blade and practically tossed the smaller man down the hall. Three more guards approached him, and he had to dodge the tips of their swords; there was nothing to be done but to survive.
Cas fought the anguish building in his chest, and instead turned to the matter at hand – Count Azazel. His yellow eyes glowed ominously, and Cas tilted his head. "I know someone who'd very much like to meet you," Cas told him.
There's a mixed CD in the truck's dash that you can't bring yourself to play because he made it for you. You can't believe the same man who looked back at you with such disdain once cared enough to share his music with you. He once gave you a piece of himself that you could take wherever you might go.
"No-human diet, huh?" she asked, handing him a vial from Rowena's cupboards. "Well, speaking as a human, I certainly appreciate that."
Purgatory had a smell, like sulfur and plant decay. The trees were many, but they were bare and their spindly branches looked like twisted bones reaching up to the sky. Night had fallen, although it was hard to be sure if that had anything to do with time, or if it was just perpetually dark in this new land.
Dean wasn’t usually the type to invite near-strangers for dinner, but he was feeling in the mood for company now that his movie-watching plans had fallen through. And if Castiel’s apartment really was still a mess of boxes, it would probably be a nice reprieve for him as well.
For a second, he's Cas, Dean's Cas, again. He remembers all the best of his life. Jack. Claire. The Winchesters. He cries then, even though angels don't cry. "Dean?"
Dean checks in on Cas again. He's laying there propped up against pillows and gazing rather uninterestedly at some movie playing on the screen in front of him. He still looks pale and miserable. His hair is wet though, so he must have made it to the shower at some point after all.
a voice whispers. Sometimes it sounds like his own voice, mostly it sounds like Lucifer, occasionally it sounds like Chuck. "Go to hell," he tells his brother, but Lucifer just laughs.
Benny turned towards the wafting scent of The Man in a Black. He was close now, within a hundred yards, but the dense foliage and trees would make him hard to see. Benny decided to get a better vantage point and climbed to the lower branches of a sturdy tree.
, either, but there's nowhere else. You know her love and loyalty is for the boys, but for you she is still a beacon of something right in this world. A kickass hunter, an amazing caretaker, a kind and resilient soul.
Chuck was intensely annoyed. He knew he should have asked another angel to officiate. "Gabriel, how dare y-"
It didn't really, but the name seemed familiar for some reason. He sighed. "I'm Kevin," he said, continuing to dab at Castiel's wounds, which immediately began to heal at the touch of diluted grace.
On his heels, two smaller figures could be seen exiting the castle behind him, but Dean could hardly take his eyes away from Castiel.
Dean took a few bites of his burger, then said casually, “Well, I guess we skipped the small talk. Any deep dark secrets you wish to confess? Murder anyone lately?”
Kevin stood up straighter and looked directly into Amara's eyes. "Your Majesty, I have been a – a hostage to Count Azazel for the past few years. All I really want now is to go home. I'd like to see my mother again."
They were just about to turn another corner when all Hell broke loose. Benny could hear, by his estimate, no less than ten pairs of feet charging towards them. The vampire made a split-second decision and shoved Castiel as far away from himself as possible, in the opposite direction of the incoming party. He staggered away, but Benny had no time to watch if he stayed upright.
And you're not gay, but your hand is suddenly on Cas's cheek and you're seriously considering kissing him, and he's looking at you with that squinty-eyed confusion which is possibly the cutest damn thing you've ever seen.
Cas snorted over his beer, and Dean felt a swoop of disappointment. But then his neighbor shot him a warm smile. “I’m sorry, I just can’t believe the coincidence. I am
His hands and legs tugged within his restraints, but the leather straps did not give way. His eyes found Kevin's face. "Where am I? And who are you?"
"Rowena," The Queen had said. "I thought - has Prince Chuck not turned you against me? It's been years since you were my Remedy Woman and you never came to my aid."
He tries to get up but Dean pushes him back down with a warm hand to his chest. "You're crazy if you think I'm gonna let you infect the whole kitchen."
After walking out of Amara's court together, they all felt more relaxed and cheerful. Benny cracked jokes, Sam chatted with Charlie, and Dean and Cas flirted uninhibitedly.
"I agree," said Castiel, to no one's surprise. They all knew that if circumstances had allowed, he'd be halfway to Dean already, with or without them.
Dean awoke with a pounding headache, his hands tied behind his back with rope. He was on a boat, in the middle of a smooth sea, with his three captors. Now the one that had taken him by surprise was sitting right in front of him, staring.
Cas runs a hand over his face, looking supremely agitated. "I'm not good at this, Dean! I don't know how it works. I didn't know I was capable of feeling this and wanting…what I want."
Rowena narrowed her eyes suspiciously. "You're a terrible liar," she said. "Did he lose a bet to you? He owes you money, doesn't he?"
Back in the woods, Benny had disappeared, but evidence of his tussle with The Man in Black remained. Prince Chuck, along with The Count and his trusted Royal entourage, had tracked the kidnappers to that very spot.
he thought, and so he did. He ran towards the duel and gave the can's trigger a quick pump in the Leviathan's direction. The spray hit the monster's face just as it was going for Castiel's neck. It screamed as its skin began to burn, bubble, and melt away.
Zachariah and Uriel were bored out of their skulls. Guarding Queen Amara's prison chamber was always desperately dull. The two angels would much rather be out traipsing around the countryside, smiting demons and vampires and the occasional human when the mood struck. They would much rather be preparing new angels for the war Prince Chuck had promised them.
The hunter turned on the spot and slashed haphazardly with his Demon blade, but Prince Chuck merely disappeared and reappeared out of Dean's reach. "Really? You know that won't kill me."
Rowena's hand stopped glowing and her eyes refocused as she finished the chant. Castiel's chest glowed with a handprint for a moment longer, but that too faded away to normal.
Benny nodded at Castiel's body. "This man we have here – he was killed by Chuck, and his true love is still arranged to marry him. If you bring him back…well, I wouldn't bet against him making Chuck pay."
Down the main hall. Left. Right. Down two flights of stairs. Right. Past the painting which depicted Lucifer's Fall from Grace. Another right. Another left.
Rage flooded his heart, but he fought it off. Chuck was smarter than Dean had ever given him credit for, and confronting him about all this would only end with Dean dead. He needed a plan. He needed to find Cas and rescue him. Then perhaps they could figure out a way to escape together, although he had no idea where they could go that might be out of the prince's reach.
They caught each other's gaze. Cas's eyes were no longer the glowing supernatural blue – they had faded back to their normal color, but no less beautiful than ever.
Prince Chuck had used his powers to zap them all the way back to the castle. They were now in Prince Chuck's study. There was Chuck's desk, messy as always. The chandelier above them cast ominous shadows on the walls, and nothing about the room gave Dean any sense of warmth. This castle had never felt like home, and now, knowing that Cas was still out there somewhere without Dean – well, it never could be.
And unlike Dean, who was currently looking for a note and feeling reassurance at its absence, so now Chuck was seeing an absence as well and feeling nothing but fury and dread.
But he never calls you back, never says your name, and the door to the bunker closes with a resounding click behind you.
The Count ran and ran. He blew around corners and through a thick set of double doors, which he barred behind him. His knowledge of the castle was certainly coming in handy.
It's the best sleep he's ever had, and it's with great reluctance that Dean opens his eyes the next morning.
Uriel frowned, and Zachariah squinted slightly, confirming for Dean that it really was just the two of them. It was all he needed to know.
Cas was covered in the black goo of Leviathan blood, but he looked powerful, with his sword still in hand and eyes a blazing blue. A monster's worst nightmare for sure. Dean would have thought it was over, but all the dropped Leviathan were still moving, writhing. The one Dean had stabbed through the gut was even standing again, weaker but with wrath etched in every line of his face.
And so, to the surprise of them all, Count Azazel bolted down the only way that wasn't blocked - the hall to his immediate left. Sam was too stunned for a moment that the monster he had built up in his head might actually flee. But then his brain caught up. He flew after the Count, and heard the sound of Benny's footsteps right behind him.
Outside his window, the sun was almost down, and the wedding would be set to start soon. But surely Chuck couldn't force him? Could this really be happening? And Cas, oh Cas, was he really...?
"I loved her very much," Sam confessed. "I was only ten, but I challenged the yellow-eyed man to a duel. I lost. He left me alive, but just barely. My Uncle Bobby found me later that night, broken body curled around the sword and lying next to my dead mother. He took me in after that, taught me all he knew about sword fighting, hunting, and lore."
"I won't move!" Sam shouted, to no one in particular. "I am waiting for Crowley," he said. "If we got separated the pl-plan was to return here. Crowley will come and I'm not l-leaving til then."
Because he now knew the truth. The Queen was not ill. She was a captive, just like Cas, and had been for years. She was a figurehead for her brother's combative rule. Queen Amara had not called Cas back into action so long ago – Chuck had.
Cas nods and reaches over to open the drawer, removing a small bottle of lube. He pops the cap and spreads some on two fingers, Dean watching with mild apprehension. Cas notices, tries to reassure him. “If you’re sure about this Dean, you should relax.”
Sam blinked guiltily up at him. "We're sorry about that, really. But I swear, we're on your side now. We've been helping Castiel storm the castle."
The Man nodded. The two picked up their goblets. "Cheers," said The Man in Black. The two bumped glasses and each took a solemn gulp of wine.
"Everything is more real when you're human, Dean. The colors, sounds, tastes, of course. And…the feelings."
A brute squad had been formed, and they were incredibly efficient at clearing out the village. But none of them were strong enough or brave enough to take on the giant.
A third almost took her by surprise, but to Rowena's astonishment, Kevin was there with a right hook, and then Charlie yanked the guard's arms back and wrestled away the sword. That gave Rowena time enough for a spell, and she opted to put the guard into a deep sleep.
Chuck rolled his eyes. "Very well, Dean," he said. Chuck snapped his fingers, and suddenly Dean was down below among the crowd, and standing right in front of the booing man.
Cas gave him a concerned look. "I suppose," he said. "I'd rather not run into any Leviathan, though. The stories made them sound quite unpleasant."
Dean let go of the sheets and dropped like a stone, but Sam was there as promised to catch him in his giant arms.
After a particularly close call for The Man in Black, he decided to go on the attack rather than continuing to defend himself. He arched his arm up and came down smoothly, flicking his wrist upward at the last second to catch Sam in his right bicep. Sam grimaced slightly – the sword had sliced through his shirt and grazed his skin in a shallow cut. But the giant smiled. "I have to admit, you're better than me."
“You’re staying,” said Dean matter-of-factly, and he was already on his way to the kitchen to start making up a second plate. “Come on, burgers are my specialty and I made enough extra. Lettuce, cheese and tomato okay, Cas? Do you go by Cas?”
"Hello again, Prince Chuck," said Cas. His tone was pleasant, but his hand flexed over the handle of his sword. His blue eyes were simmering with a barely disguised rage.
The next morning Queen Amara joined the group at the outer grounds of the castle to see off those that were leaving. For now, Benny and Sam had decided to stay in the Queen's service, and also keep Rowena and Charlie company.
The clang of metal on metal was added to the far away sound of the sea's waves lapping against the shore.
Dean paced his bedroom as the meeting went on down below. His heart was racing in his chest, and when Castiel returned looking grim and with all his possessions packed in a bag upon his back, Dean knew all their plans were ash.
Cas smiled, his eyes sparkling with amusement. “Not lately, no,” he said, and Dean chuckled. “The whole moving across country has been a little time-consuming, you see.”
Since there were rumors that another attempt might be made on Dean's life, Chuck had ordered that all the lowlifes from the Thieves' Forest be rounded up and held until the wedding was over.
Kevin picked up the vial. It was warm to the touch and his head spun a little as a powerful sensation washed over him. It wasn't unusual for grace to affect humans at close range, but none of the ones that Kevin had ever handled gave off a feeling as strong as this. He looked around the dungeon to ensure he was alone, and then, without knowing exactly why or what he planned to do next, Kevin slipped the vial of Castiel's grace into his pocket.
A few days after Chuck's imprisonment, Queen Amara called all the major players of that fateful day into her court for assembly.
Amara smiled. "Then I'll give you whatever you need. A carriage and driver perhaps? With food for the journey and traveling attire, if you'll have it?"
