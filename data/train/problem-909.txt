“Oh, so I ought to be flattered then," Watson responded, strangely more amused than anything else. "And why should he consider me important?”
The man’s hands now stilled, one pressed against his neck where John had shown he would kiss, and the other clasping the edge of his sheet, holding it up against his shoulder. In the poor quality of the video call window, John could just make out his eyes darkening, pupils expanding.
Sherlock thought of the book of poems he’d once stolen from John’s car, in which Mary had purposefully used his middle name to annoy him, and mocked his trapped state with their pretend romance. He had never interpreted an object so incorrectly in his life.
It felt like a current running through him, and John was immediately frozen in place, his body assuming parade rest. It should have been nearly impossible for John to see from that distance, but Sherlock’s brow was furrowed, offset by the intensity of the man’s unwavering stare.
Similarly, John was too preoccupied with Sherlock to realise he’d left his cane outside the door of the restaurant.
“You are getting ahead of yourselves,” Murray said, breaking the tension. “The results were inconclusive.”
I'm going on a business trip next Sunday [7 years of groaning] which is normally when I do all my last minute writing and editing, so I may be off my weekly schedule for this next one : (  so see ya kind of soon ?
“You have four arms,” John commented, elbow deep in the bot’s front compartment, “and I suppose not a single one of them is going to help me here.”
“No, no,” Sherlock said, lowering his hand. “I’ve minorly inconvenienced them, is all. You’re not regretting the suggestion, are you?”
We're back, and I think this is the longest chapter yet ! As always, this would not be possible without Soli basically coaching me through it, and cleaning up after me <3
“There’s a good fire in the library now,” Lestrade said, raising his brows meaningfully. “Might be a good idea to warm up a bit after being out in that rain.”
Sherlock’s eyes darted to Mrs Hudson, who was busy inspecting the damage to the wall, and back to John. Lowering his voice, Sherlock said, “I wouldn’t have gone to the palace on my own. You being there—it helped.”
“Not really,” Sherlock replied, delayed in the doorway by Mrs Davis offering him sweets from her bag, which he accepted with reluctance (even though he would most certainly eat them later).
“A dog named Howard? Right. Yeah. I guess unusual pet names go hand in hand with believing in ghosts, why didn’t I see that one –“
. “Before you get any ideas, just to be clear, I’m not a bot and I don’t speak bot. I’ll be unimpressed with you if you tear me open for fun.”
“Sir,” Lestrade said from the door, “Will Mr Watson be back shortly? It’s only, there’s a gentleman here asking to see him.”
John guessed that Sherlock was likely just as inquisitive about John’s form as John was about Sherlock’s. However, John would have hazarded a guess that Sherlock’s curiosity might not have run in the same vein as his. Knowing Sherlock, they probably had a purely academic interest.
John tongued at his fraenulum one last time, drawing off just as Sherlock began to come in big, aching gasps of wonder. Sherlock was at last deafeningly loud in the quiet room as John’s hand worked him through his orgasm, which seemingly lasted for ages. By the end of it, Sherlock’s chest was heaving, pressing up against his completely ruined dress shirt. John was quite certain he had never seen anything sexier in his entire life.
When Sherlock reached the first outcropping along the crater’s side, John was still several meters above him along the slope, and watched as Sherlock crouched down and gripped the edges of the rock. Sherlock eased themselves along the protrusion’s side, rather than continuing their descent to the bottom of the crater. John followed suit, swinging his body down to where he found Sherlock perched on a narrow ledge at the bottom of the outcropping.
John paused, thinking that over. Then, bizarrely, he smiled. The expression was reminiscent of the time John had watched Sherlock feed the homeless network.
The early morning dew on the petals of the rose garden beneath their window reminded Sherlock too much of dripping, red paint. He redirected his attention to the lawns that stretched out into the woods, and the Happy Valley beyond. Shortly, the gardeners would be on the grass, Gladstone nipping at their heels. Molly would prepare the masters’ breakfast, while Robert dropped the glassware, and the dusters would air the morning room and fill it with fresh lilacs, as they had been newly directed. Manderley went on regardless of what darkness occurred within its little world, and regardless of whether John, or he, was there to see it. Perhaps that at least was a small mercy.
Sherlock turns away from peering through the foliage to give him an exasperated expression. “For God's sake John, that was psychosomatic.”
How would he tell John he was leaving? Perhaps they would meet in the lounge, and they would exchange the awful formalities associated with polite farewells. There would be a pretense of writing each other no doubt. John would ask a passing waiter for a pen and paper to write down his address, as if that was needed, while he’d think, 'Four and a half more minutes to go. I shall never see him again.'
As he’d learned, Irene Norton’s seductions turned on and off like a light switch.  “I’d rather not find out anything of the sort, Lady Norton.”
“You mean by working as a servant. Oh, I see,” Sherlock said, attempting to gain an advantage. “You realized Magnussen wanted Manderley for himself. That’s why you didn’t assist with the blackmail letter. He tried to get the upper hand on you.”
“No maiming,” he promised, and he could feel himself smiling. The kind of smiling when you know something someone else doesn’t.
your company, indeed. He owns your company, John,” Sherlock sighed, rolling onto their back in the tight space. “And he’s my brother.”
The flower’s petals were crushed and bruised, their once white colouring stained around their edges. However, as he rubbed it against his palm, the scent of the flower became strong and sweet.
Living separately would have made this even more unbearable. So, instead of checking on his spores in the kitchen, Sherlock sat on his bed and sipped. The syrupy sweetness and metallic tang were the same as always; the coldness he was still getting used to. It was never very pleasant, even if it was hot. As he drank, his nose scrunched up and his mouth rearranged itself into a moue, not unlike a child being forced to eat his vegetables.
Sherlock’s arms had been outstretched in an aborted ‘ta-da’ gesture, but they now dropped to his sides. Sherlock’s face fell. John was really being quite unbelievable about this.
“Yes,” John said, his quiet voice loud in the silent room, everyone collectively on the edge of their seats, all wondering where this line of inquiry would take them.
“At least those damn reporters might be good for something,” John commented ruefully, causing Sherlock to smirk back at him. Sherlock would always have an appreciation for John exposing his natural anti-socialness.
“How did you know I came from London, Mr Watson?” Magnussen deflected, moving away from him to walk around the room. The conversation was apparently not enough to hold his attention.
Sherlock shook his head, drawing his knees up to his chest. “A month has come and passed,” he said. “I need more time, John.”
Sherlock’s response was to shuffle back into his bedroom, shutting the door connected to the shared toilet behind him.
This was enough to make Sherlock smile; John made note of that. “Yes, I know,” Sherlock said, one eyebrow lifted. ”I have seen a photo of you, on your blog.”
“They’d notice if something like that went missing Sherlock, and I don’t think I need to remind you that this needs to be kept discrete.”
Which is how John finds himself, once again, outside of what appears to be a perfectly average looking residence for a place that has a supposed supernatural reputation.
His agonizing over the subject must have shown in his face, as John’s expression was beginning to crumple in apology. “Sorry, I’m sorry,” John said in a rush. “That wasn’t on. I know you don’t like to -- sorry.”
When he returned to the waking world, it was with a hazy recollection of the events of his dream. The full memory of it was elusive. Like trying to hold water in cupped palms, he would catch it for a moment before it slipped away again. However, even the vague understanding of its nature was more than enough for him to know Wilkes would mock him endlessly if he ever found out. Which was foolish - how could Wilkes possibly know? And know what, exactly?
Unable to contain himself any longer, John snickered. The next thing he knew, he was in a fit of shoulders raised, fist covering his mouth, body-shaking laughter. Sherlock regarded him in open confusion for a moment before joining in with a deep, resonating chuckle.
The Witch matched John’s pace up the stairs easily. When John grumbled, the Witch laughed and said, “You should try it in heels. Why are you bringing that dog with you, anyway?”
For a moment Sherlock was concerned he was experiencing an episode of arrhythmia. That wasn’t right - it was
“I don’t care about the boots,” Sherlock said. Then, after a pause, “I gather you didn’t find any—stars.”
This could easily be their last night together. Or one of their last nights. Who knew what tomorrow would bring. John must have thought the same, given that he’d been reluctant to let Sherlock out of his sight, even to take a bath.
Sherlock’s half-baked idea might actually work. John stepped forward with the intention of besmirching Sherlock’s fake name, followed by a quick exit.
The poacher’s smile in response was filled with crooked teeth, and a touch of surprise. “Have you grown attached to it? You’ve rather shown your cards there mate. Now I don’t even need to point a weapon at you. You’ll put yours down on your own I think.”
“John, you’re an idiot,” Sherlock said, still breathless. “We are already tied to each other, whether this happened or not. This is just the declaration. I want this, and you. I want this marriage, and whatever comes with it. I want it to be real. I won’t let them hang you, but even they do, we’d both go down together.”
At the door, Sherlock’s mouth stretched wide into a cheshire cat smile, with no resemblance to the one John had seen grace his face earlier. One arm fell straight down along his side, while the other knocked with command. Presumably, they were on the case. John peered back at the window. Perhaps there was a dead body inside, or markings on the wall in blood, or—
They were standing as close to one another as two people could without touching, but which somehow left enough room for Sherlock to crane his head downward to better scan John’s face.
Wilkes declared all this while facing the rest of the room with John behind him. He might not have continued if he had been watching John’s expression, though knowing Wilkes, perhaps not.
“And you’re sure, er, Howard was in the house that night when you went to sleep?” he asks, trying to not sound too doubtful.
He reopened his eyes in frustration – even with his memory palace, the recollections were not perfect, not exact. They were distant cousins to the real places and things and events. Five more minutes had gone by. Soon they would reach their unspoken time limit and have to return to the hotel.
“You asked me to trust you,” John said, exhausted. “And I’m now asking you to do me the same courtesy.”
Why did John look like that, and where had the man with the open-book expression gone? Who was this person he couldn’t read at all?
Only, being angry with John ultimately meant thinking about John, and the true source of his frustration. Which had only been mounting. The sweet kisses from the day before, which John had broken off. The figure he cut in his suits. His still-tanned skin, all covered up beneath starched white collars. His tongue peeking out to lick his lower lip. Maddening.
“I’m not sure I see another explanation,” the Coroner responded, and Sherlock had to appreciate that the stickler was at least willing to cling to the easiest answer. “Sir, please remember that your handiwork is not on trial, and no one is suggesting you are to blame for Mrs Watson’s unfortunately lax sailing in a bad spot of weather.”
Maybe he was beating them off regardless. Sherlock searches for the usual signs that John might be seeing someone or be in a relationship. Shirt well ironed but he could be doing that, this wasn’t the dark ages. Shaving cream behind his ear – no then, probably not. He was single. Available.
“Is this the rest of Mike?” John asked, motioning to the parts next to them on the floor of the crater. “Are there any more?”
> I just figured you’d probably get them to swot up first beforehand, so you’d already have some readers at your disposal.
Sherlock wants to know whether the man would need his cane when put into a high adrenaline situation. He’d also like to know what the exact colour of his hair is - blond, brown, grey? It’s hard to make out based solely on the reflection in the glass. His eyelashes seem very light.
“Are you all right?” John asked. Sherlock realized the fingers drumming against his leg had grown sporadic. Possibly twitchy.
He knew the painting she was referring to of course, it was the first one that had caught his eye when he’d arrived at Manderley. “Isn’t that more of a pair costume?” he asked. “Besides, isn’t it going too far to dress as one of John’s ancestors?”
The sounds Sherlock was making were intoxicating, driving John absolutely wild. He was high off of being able to touch, and from just the act of being
He realized that at some point he had moved very near to Watson. He had tilted his face down and towards Watson to speak, as if not wanting to be overheard. Most people reacted poorly to their personal space being invaded, but if anything Watson had only moved closer in response.
Everything he had kept to himself, that he thought he could hide from John, he could feel coming to the surface. Like the sea he could just see a glimpse of through the window, the waves of his dissatisfaction were at last reaching the shoreline, and foaming as they hit the shingle.
John looked heavenward, appearing both amused and exasperated. “Lestrade, would you mind checking to see if the broken thing is beneath the desk?”
They passed beneath a tunnel of flowers, the whole area beyond picturesque, till they suddenly reached a cove. The difference in atmosphere was dramatic - behind them was the valley, azaleas and trees, and ahead there was the sea breaking hard on the shore and white shingle. He could see now why Harry had never swam here. The beach wasn’t overly inviting.
“Sir, I've already spoken to the exchange about putting calls to Manderley to the office,” Lestrade had offered, the morning following the boat being dragged from the water. “Robert and I will screen all the calls, and only forward on those from within your acquaintance.”
He realized perhaps playing with the dog on the ground was probably not master of Manderley behaviour. He looked up to catch Harry’s eyes on him. Her look was puzzled, almost reflective. He imagined her thinking to herself,
That joke was getting rather tired. “I think it’s time you took off, if you had any intention of reaching London by a decent hour.”
The clock ticking on the wall was a comfort. He was able to ground himself in reality via that reliable steady sound.
Sherlock had actually expected a meeting with Moriarty post trial, but perhaps he should have known that Jim preferred to keep his servant guise in tact.
John almost laughed, but it died on his lips when all the blood in his body rushed south. With a particularly vigorous thrust, the man’s sheet had fallen off his body.
But he didn’t care to dwell upon the previous afternoon. He couldn’t shake the feeling that outside of this room, everything was a part of Moriarty’s net. Even if he went outside, Moriarty could be watching. There were so many empty rooms, not just the West wing - all the areas that had once been occupied when John’s parents were alive. He understood there used to be significantly more entertaining, and more servants. Hard to believe, but this Manderley was a downgrade from its previous livelihood. It would be easy for Moriarty to slip into one of those empty rooms and peer out from behind the drawn curtains. He felt certain Moriarty had eyes and ears everywhere.
He wasn’t related in any conceivable way to anyone involved—how would anyone trace it back to him? Impossible circumstances made for perfect murders.
“The lifeform said you were out on one of the routes,” the man remarked, pushing the prod harder against Sherlock’s neck. “Bad news for you that it was wrong.”
You see, goats can scale mountainsides. They can walk along almost vertical inclines. This goat lived on the mountain, knew all the best places for salt, and he’d been told about the ram who lived half-way up it. As the goat came toward the ram who lay there injured, the ram couldn’t believe his eyes.
Five minutes passed before he and John were alone again, and by then John appeared to be recovered and happy to eat sandwiches. “Having all that crowd over must have put me into a mood,” John said,  “Harry does always rub me up the wrong way.”
Though many would have considered it foolish, John didn’t hesitate to take his hand. “John Watson. And thank you for that. I don’t know if I would have left that encounter without a few bruises.”
“Fine, yes. Do your thing,” John said, before grabbing Sherlock’s forearm with his good arm. “Just—don’t make me regret it.”
John signed once the man could see him, and the man obeyed, continuing to crane his neck backwards in a position that couldn’t possibly be comfortable.
He had likely made a fool of himself already, and would be the fool twice over with a heartfelt farewell. In John Watson of Manderley’s life, he was no different than that young boy on the road, waving at the glimpse of a car flying past.
Sherlock’s hips were rocking up against him, and John started to move, as if he were just a piece in a Newton’s cradle. It was a slow grinding, John’s thrusts shallow, gentle, the perfect depth to rub against the prostate John has heard so much about, and the perfect closeness to rub Sherlock’s cock against his sticky abdomen. John’s arms were bracketing Sherlock’s face, and John learned from up close that the tears he had seen earlier were merely part of Sherlock’s experience, who was egging him on with legs clamping down and spindly arms wrapped round and round.
He was overwhelmed with all that they weren’t saying. And ever since he’d seen the West rooms, he couldn’t help but wonder - were the rooms kept like that, untouched, unchanged as if Mary had never left, under John’s orders? Did John ever go there, like Moriarty, to touch the dressing gown over the back of the chair, or the brushes on the dressing table, or to peer into the wardrobe doors, and at the nightgown on that bed? And was this why John let Moriarty get away with whatever he wanted, an agreement between them, an understanding - Moriarty had been Mary’s man, after all.
When Sherlock jumped up from his table and dashed outside, John chased after him, attempting to keep pace while staying out of sight. Luckily his footfalls were light, and Sherlock was far too preoccupied with predicting the cab’s movements to notice any hanger-on.
Jesus, John thought. The kid still lived with his mum—thank God he didn’t have to hear anything else sexual from him.
“John,” the man began again, “why do you suppose this trip was scheduled to be longer than the others?”
“Are you feeling all right, John?” the Hudson asked, somehow managing to sound concerned. “The in-ship bot is on board, where I always am. Currently on the bridge, waiting for instructions for how to handle the alarm. Alarm code TRF 201202 is unidentified ship landing.”
John raised his eyes, wanting to see Sherlock watching again. He wanted to make Sherlock see it—his own cock disappearing in and out of John’s mouth, the
All John can think, apart from getting his mouth on more of Sherlock, and grinding up against his erection, is that this is what they had needed, their lives were always about drama, danger, excitement, all they’d needed to take this step from chaste early-beginnings sweethearts to lovers was a moment like this, out of their home routines, back in the action –
“I wouldn’t mind taking the call, if he weren’t so insistent,” Molly said, catching onto his reluctance. “I mean—he is quite dishy, isn’t he?” she whispered with a shy smile.
John reached around once more, testing the waters as his climax approached, rubbing down Sherlock’s chest absently. While still propping themselves up against the wall, two of Sherlock’s hands grabbed John’s, and pulled it down to their cock, sighing when John began to stroke them again. They pushed back to meet his more forceful thrusts, but Sherlock seemed mostly focused on bracing themselves against the wall as the momentum of John’s own desperate movements drove them forward with each snap of his hips. Sherlock’s pleasure was vocalized by a low whir that only grew louder, the vibrations of which John could practically feel in his cock as he slid against them, harder and faster.
John was speaking to him, telling him things that were indescribably inconceivable, and he felt nothing. Though that wasn’t quite right either. It was rather that he felt too much. He couldn’t settle on any one feeling. It was quieter now, but there was still a slight buzzing in his head. His entire skull had been packed full of cotton again, as it had been when John had asked him to marry him.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, his voice hardly louder than an exhaled breath. “You have surpassed them, in every way.”
It was just a public dinner. Something to do with the county. Only, accidents happened all the time.
"There's a local man, always around that cottage,” David said, already triumphant. “He’s odd, sleeps on the beach. I bet you anything he saw it.”
“We’ve just been told that the boat had been purposefully damaged, Mr Watson, and that with the seacocks open and holes drilled into its sides, it would have sunk in a matter of minutes. I think we can agree that rules out the possibility of earlier damage, as the boat would have already sunk before Mrs Watson went sailing. Do you agree?”
“Someone who had intended to murder wouldn’t feel this kind of regret. And you’re not stupid enough to have premeditated such an easily unearthed crime,” Sherlock said confidently, his strength returning to him in the face of John’s doubt.
“You had better not sit like that while we have company – No, no, not over there, honestly! – Listen, anyone who is anyone in Monte will be coming to see me tonight, so you’d better not be up to any of your usual tricks," Wilkes instructed, again, with his attention rather divided as a staff member had almost put a chair in the wrong spot. "In fact, don’t speak unless spoken to. And please, no repeat of that other night with Watson! I’ve already had someone run an invitation to him, seeing as you weren’t around.”
If he had been restricting himself from the wing out of respect, it was out of character. However, fearing what he might find there was even more illogical, so it must have been the former. Whichever it was, it was all rather foolish.
John pulled back at the sound, and Sherlock managed to put himself together enough to shout, “For the love of God, don’t stop!” John proceeded to lift Sherlock’s legs over his shoulders, raising his hips, and opening him impossibly wider. John started again, circling his rim with his tongue, and then pushing back in, repeatedly pulling out and returning with his tongue, lapping at his own come while stroking Sherlock’s cock in time. Sherlock’s entire being was a litany of high, breathless gasps of “ah, ah, ah,
I can still escape all this trouble, allowing me to remain unsullied in the eyes of the public if they convict you.”
Having confirmed that Sherlock’s wound was well cared for, and that Sherlock was not in a chatting mood, John clapped the back of the chair one last time. “I’m for bed, I think.”
John read the implication loud and clear: he had killed a human to save a non-human. And he’d do it a thousand times over, if need be. For this particular alien, at any rate.
Wilkes recovered admirably. “Shocking! Oh, of course I must delay my trip. The poor thing has no one to give him away at the altar! And you’ll need help planning the event itself.”
“No, John’s had the suite in the East wing done up for us,” he replied, his defence of the change beginning to sound weak to his own ears.
He saw John ambushed by people near the library, presumably performing similarly, accepting thanks and ushering people out. The great hall eventually became vacant once again.
Sherlock rounded on her then, face twisting into a dreadful sneer. “And why should we care? Do you have any idea what you have—” Sherlock broke off. “Can you even fathom it?”
Stepping out into the small hallway, John opened the only other door on the second floor. On the other side was a small bathroom, which managed to fit a porcelain sink, a claw-foot tub, a toilet, and an impressive collection of what John assumed were homemade washing supplies. The sink and shelf above it were packed to the brim with them, and several bottles needed to be moved out of the way just to use the taps, so he could splash cold water onto his face. John regretted not bringing any other clothes with him, but resigned himself to a wash in the sink to freshen up.
John’s brow furrowed, taken aback. Ah, so not that then. “I was going to say fetish,” John clarified, with an aborted laugh.
John looked at him oddly, his confusion only growing. “He didn’t tell me anything about you -- if anyone was going to be getting slandered, it was me. He asked me what my
His eyes were drifting closed, and the bed looked remarkably comfortable. And John slept on the left side, not the middle. Almost as if he were waiting for someone to fill in the right. Yet, John never brought any of his women back to the flat. Probably because he didn’t want them meeting Sherlock.
Kept disappearing. Multiple disappearances. John stops in his tracks outside of the flat. He suddenly feels like he’s onto something. Don’t bad things normally come in threes?
“Does starting at the back and moving to the front apply here as well?” John asked, chin dipping down toward Sherlock’s lap.
“So where are your parents now?” John asked, imagining a painful split, dividing the family line —but then, maybe he was projecting.
“No dear,” the Hudson bot replied, wiping his arm down with a towelette pulled from its front compartment. “Sherlock went to the BAK 2212 base.”
John wrapped his right hand around both of Sherlock’s wrists, holding the arms above Sherlock’s head in one hand, and using the other to trail back down to the zip of Sherlock’s ruined coveralls. John kissed Sherlock’s neck near the gills once, then twice. John left his hand on the zip, unmoving, waiting for the sign.
As he was about to leave he heard a footfall behind him. He turned to find himself facing Moriarty, approaching him from the ante room. He moved backward instinctively in surprise. Was the man just constantly in this wing, waiting to spring himself on people?
“No, Sherlock. I’m wondering if I should have brought rose petals to scatter on the bed, but other than that, there’s no problem.” Sherlock rolled his eyes, but he was smiling again soon enough after.
“I - ” John began, bending down quickly to retrieve the towel. John cleared his throat. “Sorry, but, have we not been recently doing a bit of that, or -”
He pressed his foot into the handle of Watson’s forgotten cane, causing it to snap up into the palm of his hand in a move he hoped looked smooth.
The Royal Wizard hummed, and then, as if John and he were well-acquainted, “He was my best pupil, you know.”
Sherlock turned over, forcing John to draw back from his crouched position lest he be kicked in the head. There was a wet spot where Sherlock had been grinding, John was delighted to note. Sherlock’s abdomen was glistening with it, and John had the urge to bend down and lick it up.
“See John, I just looked up ‘Sherlock Holmes book’, and nothing!” A phone stretched out towards him, the small screen showing exactly what John had already confirmed when he’d done the same search. “Why are you making up stuff about us as kids? Did you also hit your head or something?”
“Hello Molly, can you tell whoever is responsible for this room that the flowers need replacing, and the room needs airing,” Sherlock requested motioning to the wilting hydrangeas.
John’s restless pacing along the footpath is thankfully interrupted by Greg and two other officers pulling up in the driveway.
John hadn’t known Sherlock’s mortality was a bit more robust than that, but the gesture had been... inspiring. Sherlock had needed to keep John, right away, and had needed to be near him as much as he was able. Living together was essential, and wasn’t nearly enough. Sherlock still felt the urge to check in on John during their brief moments of separation, and he had a poor track record for resisting urges.
“He was also Mary’s confidante,” David declared. “They were together for years before coming to Manderley, and he won’t be under Watson’s thumb like our last witness.”
“I’m not hungry.” He was thinking, about what Lady Norton had said, and Harriet as well for that matter -  he had to think….
Sherlock took John’s place in the armchair, hands steepled beneath his chin, and waited for the news. He needed to review all the facts, and discover what areas he might be missing. Sherlock, with eyes shut tight, relived the story he had just been told, based on the specifics John had provided. Sherlock imagined he had walked along the path to the cottage that night with John, and that after the act was committed, he watched John wrap his bleeding shoulder, knowing he would need to move a body regardless of the wound. Sherlock watched John carry her body to the cabin, drive holes into its planking, open the valves, all the while injured. John, on his last legs, cleaning away the evidence and stumbling back up to the house, his hand pressed into his shoulder, John knowing he would need to see to his own wound. John hiding in his room as the storm fully hit, the rain and wind howling, and finally, the confusion and guilt catching up with him.
John walked alongside his new acquaintance, though at a distance, and began the journey back to their ride. He kept one eye forward, and the other on the unidentified humanoid next to him. The alien walked without issue despite the low gravity, and appeared to be completely docile. This seemed almost too easy.
“What?” Sherlock’s chin must have been against his chest, his head had dropped so far. His voice was softened, almost groggy.
John thinks this is rather an excellent point and shoots Sherlock an eyebrows raised ‘get on with it’ look which earns him an irritated glance.
Despite keeping his face turned forward, he could see Lestrade’s head whip towards him. If Lestrade expected to be able to read his expression, the man would be disappointed. He was prepared for his own interrogation, and had no interest in giving an inch.
“Quick, back through the door!” Feathers sprung out around Sherlock’s neck as he spoke, and wings unfurled from his back. “I’ll take you there, it’s quicker this way!”
“You’ve proven yourself adept at apprehending thieves,” Sherlock observed, speaking over the top of Watson’s shoulder.
“How many do you need to take apart to satisfy your curiosity?” John asked, incredulous. He’d had to make the return trip to BAK 2212 God only knew how many times, and it had apparently been out of
The Coroner, older, feeling entitled to a certain degree of respect, John responding harshly. Oh God, what if John really did come under full suspicion? An image he’d seen millions of times before in the paper presented itself to him, of men being taken away from court to be held for a full trial.What if they didn’t let Sherlock see him?
Indian forgotten, John pushed the styrofoam container aside, and clicked a few too many times to open the message.
The edge of the door had been sealed over and the knob had been removed and covered, but after removing more of the paper and jamming his pocketknife into the filled-in knob the door starts to give.
When Sherlock sneered at him like that, John could understand why people might think he was a heart-eater.
When John only eyed him warily, Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Fine, I’ll start then. I’ll present the facts, as one should never reason without them. You seem to have known the details of Jennifer Wilson’s murder before it even happened, and I seem to know your name without ever having met you.”
“You’ve never - done that. Before. Described me like that,” Sherlock said in a low, almost hopeful voice.
As always, a million thanks to Soli writemeastoryofsolitude for her beta'ing, and also to Anna nondeducible for providing her Anna Fact Check TM
They were all shown into a drawing room which attached to a room further back, likely the one used for patient consultations. Murray scanned their small group again, confusion still obvious, prompting Colonel Barclay to initiate their discussion.
“Yes, okay, yes, I did! I wanted to know what you were always, uh—” John waved his hand between Sherlock and the depleted bag on his table. “But that still doesn’t come anywhere close to coming into my room at night, Sherlock, or coming in while I’m showering.”
“Look, I’m not really interested in force feeding you. Mr Watson mentioned you had actually only mimed eating during dinner.”
They had reached the slope of a hill, and the path through the woods twisted into a valley banking a stream. Azaleas and rhododendrons flanked them on either side, surrounding the area in pastel colours. The earlier darkness and muted tones of the forest was behind them. He inhaled deeply - the air was full of the flowers’ scent, amplified by the rain.
“I just thought maybe we should slow down –” John attempted to explain, but at the mention of slowing down, Sherlock only gripped John tighter. Imitating John’s earlier move, Sherlock began grinding himself against John without any self consciousness, and covered John’s open mouth with kisses till John was too dizzy with receiving everything he’d ever wanted for so long, he forgot why he’d ever suggested stopping.
Yes, he supposed. He’d on occasion thought of his future. He’d thought about watching as fluid pulled its way up from a vial and into a syringe. Mixing the exact concentration for a perfect dose, in the perfect place, on the perfect high. The perfect high that would never end. Or end everything, rather. He used to think the perfect place was London, but maybe now it was Monte Carlo.
“Pardon me sir, but it was you who brought him in,” Moriarty said, and it was darker than his earlier voice, and he could hear the smile in the words. He could imagine Moriarty’s skull-like face, with lips pulled back across his cheeks.
“Nevermind.” There went that, then. “I ran into your landlady on the way up,” John continued, attempting to make conversation.
This did not help with Sherlock’s apparent frustration, as their head hit the wall behind them with a soft thud. Sherlock shut their eyes again, but John’s hand on Sherlock’s zip was still clutched to their chest.
John’s eyes begin to adjust to the darkness so that he can see the interior of the living room. Sherlock begins moving about the room towards the side table which hosts the family picture frames on it, where he pauses.
“The client was a chain smoker, amongst other things,” Sherlock said, with a nonchalance not reflected in his body language. He finally turned to face John, who reluctantly met his gaze rather than focusing on the backsplash.
The rest of the night continued on in a whirl, the costumed nature of the evening creating a strange sequence of snapshots in his mind. A Tudor woman in dark velvet, spilling champagne on her husband’s mistress to the Destiny Waltz. A sailor swindling an Arabian knight at cards to the Blue Danube. A phantom stubbing out a cigarette in an overflowing ashtray to Vienna Blood. It was truly to be waltzes for hours. He dreamed of escaping to the terrace for a cigarette, but his torment did not cease. If he had to hear Strauss one more time, he thought he might break a violin in half. He was saved from committing this sin to an instrument by the fireworks on the lawn, when the band finally paused for the guests to rush out to the terrace. He used the opportunity for a smoke break, unable to enjoy the abrasive lights and sounds through the night air. They had been meant as the climax of the evening, but little did their guests know, that had come and gone long before they had even arrived.
“I’ll look it up and see if it sparks my memory, will that make you happy?” Harry pulled out her mobile, quick on the draw, her thumbs already moving over the keys.
When Sherlock opened his mind’s eye, he was in the entranceway of the Hotel Cote d’Azur. His mind worked in mysterious ways, at times surprising even to himself. His organization system, which had once been a childish assembly, an unconnected collection of places used for storage, had reoriented itself. And of course, it had done so around the place he had first met John.
“What is the problem Sherlock?” John asked, voice raising. “I can take it. Or is that just an excuse? Is it something to do with me? You only feed on people who went to Eton?”
“What are you talking about?” Sherlock demanded, sick of games. His heartbeat reminded him of the time ticking by, and of how long he could stall Moriarty before he remembered Sherlock had gotten it wrong, and that he had lost the game.
He had to make John interpret his silence as fatigue. John couldn’t know he was dreading their arrival at Manderley.
“Well, don’t tell John then,” he said in response. Worrying John was definitely not the intention of his actions. “Not like how you’ll likely tattle to my brother.”
John shook the hand, wishing he was wearing a pair of gloves that soft and supple to the touch. “As you might have gathered, I’m John.”
What had he been doing? He felt as if between John leaving, and this exact moment, several weeks had passed at the very least.
“All right,” John reassured them, instantly drawing away his other hand from Sherlock’s groin. “What’s wrong? Should I stop?”
> You figured all that out, and had everything back to the museum within one night, Sherlock! It was incredible.
“Don’t you?” The quip was asked with one eyebrow artfully arched in disbelief. “The gun-powder stains on your fingers say otherwise.”
John was looking anywhere but at him, and lifted the cover from a silver platter and began to cut into a piece of ham.
John always told him he should apologize in these situations, which might be enough to calm John down. “I’m sorry,” Sherlock said, a question mark almost hanging at the end of it.
John paused, hovering over Sherlock’s crotch. Looking up to meet Sherlock’s eyes, John slowly leaned forward, and began to mouth at the bulge currently tenting Sherlock’s threadbare pajama bottoms. Sherlock’s moans were gratifying, but John pulled back before he got carried away, leaving a damp spot behind where his mouth had been.
Watson cast a smile his way, and he couldn’t help but feels his lips twitch in response. Oh, but Watson was a bit glib. He found he rather liked it.
John still looked unconvinced, his forehead crinkled in its funny way. He leaned forward to kiss it.
What else could he have faked? Or, did faking end up being necessary? Janine and Sherlock seemed to get along almost immediately at the wedding. John had seen them, chatting, Janine standing close to Sherlock. John had seen them, and had walked over, and touched the small of Sherlock’s back.
“How can you be sure?” she asked, pausing to cough. “They say that the Wizard Holmes wants the heart of every young girl in town.”
“Yes?” John asked again, but his hand was already resuming its path downward, till it finally skated across his erection, jutting up from his nightshirt obscenely. He exhaled harshly as John lightly brushed his hand over him, drawing down and then up, stroking from the root to the tip, pausing over the growing wet spot in the cloth.
He realized it was something similar to what he might do to Gladstone. John liked him, rather in the same way he liked Gladstone. A pet to give pats and affection to, when it was convenient.
The rest of the word was rather garbled as Sherlock had chosen this moment to close the distance between their mouths, and formed a tight seal around John’s parted lips. John stopped speaking abruptly, eyes wide open and fixed on the face inches from his own. John held perfectly still.
“Never wanted sex?” John finished. He wondered if this was a very late in coming brush off, and guiltily removed his hands.
John however did question him about it, and Sherlock answered to the best of his ability. John’s curiosity was piqued at unpredictable times, and his questions came in waves. Either it was not addressed at all, or John wanted to know everything.
Back on Earth, Watson was being thanked profusely by the damsel in distress, who was now happily polishing tomato sauce from her newly reclaimed jewelry. Watson was ever so gracious, no signs of his supposed bad manners, and smiling at her entirely too winningly.
paper before, can you imagine? Mr Watson was right to have something done. It’s never been used except for occasional visitors. But, Mr Watson wanted the room for you.”
While reluctant, John headed upstairs, and into bed. He was in part relieved that his gallantry hadn’t been accepted; he was fond of Sherlock’s bedroom, as he had never had any issues sleeping in it. He had even grown fond of the spiders running amok in the canopy overhead.
John’s eyes on him were burning, and Sherlock smiled coyly. He loved it. “You’re already begging,” John commented, low and gruff. “And I haven’t even touched you yet.”
Sherlock was the first out of the car when they eventually arrived at their destination in a largely residential neighbourhood. If Murray was still in practice, he must have earned enough money to start one of his own from out of his home. Colonel Barclay and David parked nearby, and they all met in silence in the path outside of the house. There was little to say, beyond confirming that this was indeed the correct address. The Colonel inclined his head, and Sherlock and John walked towards the entrance, with David close behind.
If the staff complained to John about how he snuck about the place, John did not let on. Every room in the house was kept pristine as if Manderley was in fact a museum, and likely he mussed things up as he went about, but what else was he to do? Why have a home that couldn’t be lived in?
John let him speak, and waited. There were no threats, or kicking of ottomans. Was John not angry with him?
“Did you get your wires crossed and mean to say idiot?” John asked, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth while his lined face scrunched in confusion.
Well, that had been a faked relationship though, hadn’t it? Probably getting a bit of her own back, good on you Janine. Probably all drivel.
Sherlock slipped further forward in his chair, as if to crowd John for the answer, but then pressed him for something else entirely. “Humphrey?”
Sherlock realized that he had truly made the largest error one could make - reasoning without all the facts. John, John, who was always so gentle with him, always so careful, trying to do right by him, but not knowing how, and not knowing what it was he wanted. John, all this time thinking that his husband had made a rash decision, that he regretted the marriage, that he didn’t
“Your fears are the same,” she says instead. “Isn’t that a bit silly?” She continues to smile, simultaneously staring directly at him and not at all.
At last, he heard a bark from beyond the rocks to the right of the beach. “He’s climbed over this way!” he called back to John, as he immediately hopped up to climb over the terrain separating him from Gladstone.
Sherlock looked up from the floor, and stared at John as if they were seriously considering their answer.
“Conclusion: there’s something you aren’t mentioning, there have been more odd events than just Howard’s disappearance. However, you only sought out help now, meaning these things didn’t distress you enough to act previously.  What those odd incidents might be I haven’t the faintest, but I have a strong suspicion they are related to your very recently deceased husband,” Sherlock concludes, in his usual rapid-fire pace.
“A scarecrow? That’s not much of a walking stick.” After observing the scarecrow’s friendly expression, he said, “Not much of a scarecrow either.”
Had this been overly invasive of him? He had a habit of stealing people’s things when they annoyed him, and rarely felt any guilt for it. It had been in Watson’s glove compartment, hardly personal.
“There’s been messengers milling outside the door looking for Wizard Sigerson,” the boy, Archie, said. He ran up the steps, and then slammed to a standstill, staring agape at John.
The man’s shoes were nearly silent as he moved across the floor, as if he had planned ahead to avoid the sound of a heavier sole.
Sherlock tilted his head towards John on the carpet, curls squashed against the rough material, making him look terribly young. Sherlock’s smile, which was a touch impish, only added to the effect. “I was thinking about JHW.”
There was a growing warmth in John’s chest that he didn’t think was going to go away for a very long time. He leaned forward, pressing his nose into Sherlock’s dark curls. They smelled nice.
“No. Not alright,” John responds. He hasn’t been able to stay in the house. Waiting for the police felt like centuries. Every moment of him doing nothing–
“Are you quite finished?” Sherlock asked, his back still turned. He hated the thought of Moriarty being able to read the tension in his shoulders, but it was better than showing his face. “I know nothing about it.”
Sherlock allowed his breathing to even out. The topic had returned to what he wanted to discuss, at least.
Magnussen sighed. “Do you really think I’m bluffing Mr Watson? This is my last offer before David is returned his letter, and contacts the magistrate instead.”
‘He must know’. He supposed he likely did know, as he knew most things. John had been unsure if he could make a new marriage work. He would have to convince John that he could, but not against John’s wishes. How was it that something so intangible could cause such an acute physical pain?
Before John could point it out, Sherlock said, with a tinge of regret, “Those things are still after me. Till next time, John.”
The atmosphere aboard their safe haven had shifted. John wasn’t sure if this was due to the transfer between them, or from being shown Sherlock’s ship, or both. John had been provided with the pieces to the puzzle of Sherlock’s origins, and the possible reason as to why people would be looking for them in the first place; John wondered if Sherlock regretted revealing so much.
“It is typical to present witnesses,” Sherlock pointed out, unable to resist poking holes in David’s accusation. John glanced at him. Sherlock got the message - he might have picked the wrong moment to be a smart-arse.
“I’m an interfering bore, aren’t I?” she asked, finding his reaction hilarious, clearly. “Don’t mind me. You must know I’m devoted to John, though we always fight when we meet. I do really congratulate you on his looks. We were all very worried about him this time last year, but of course you would know the whole story.”
“A horrible tragedy,” Wilkes had said in hushed tones over soup in bed, “the papers were full of it for ages. They say he never talks about it, never even mentions her name.  She was drowned you know, in the ocean, in the bay near Manderley...”
He was grateful for his lack of shame when John rushed back to him at once, one hand holding his hip, the other reaching to touch the back of his neck. John guided his head down towards him once more and Sherlock allowed himself to be pulled, unresisting. He was ready this time, and when John’s lips finally touched his again, he kissed back with everything he had.
John moves around the room looking for, well he’s not sure what, but Sherlock would have looked for something. Something to tell him more.
They would hear the sound of wheels on the drive, and the bell ringing out once, and in unison he and John would announce, “Visitor.” He would deduce the arriving personage based on the sound of the tires, and if given enough time, their shoes clicking in the entrance hall. His conclusions were always confirmed by the cards delivered to them on a silver salver. John would muffle his laughter into his fist. “Stop, they’re almost in -” John would choke out, before they would assume their assigned positions, in their pantomime of the obliging, newly married couple.
“Was that what you were actually trying to ask me earlier?” John asked, still propped up over Sherlock’s lap. “Because you could have just - you know - said that.”
For once, Sherlock felt driven to take a risk. “I actually love to dance,” he said. It was abrupt, judging by Watson’s surprised reaction. “I’ve always loved it.”
“We've argued in a circle,” he said. They’d arrived back at the original argument, in fact. This was stupid. “Somehow this all began because I broke a cupid in the morning-room. If I hadn't broken the cupid none of this would have happened.”
John breathed in heavily, and lowered his head. His right hand came up to rub his forehead, and cover his closed eyes. He knew what this meant of course. There was about to be a reason the Captain felt the need to tell them this, rather than simply leaving them in peace.
John had been contemplating growing older (a minute and a half spent looking at himself in the mirror, and eyes skidding over hair dye targeted at older men while shopping), and several hours later asked Sherlock whether his people aged.
He wanted to be with John, but just the two of them, without all the trappings. He wanted John and him traveling, or perhaps in a busy place like London. Not to be arriving at an estate, which John was to be the responsible master of, and him as husband to John Hamish Watson.
John noticed now that the man seemed to read his lips almost exclusively, barely even glancing at John’s hands when he signed. Even that pissed John off. What was the point of John searching his memory for the right gesture, when the man could apparently lip read perfectly?
The man didn’t need to sign anything else to communicate that he doubted John’s list very much, but simply shrugged his sheet-clad shoulders.
“Then we’re at disadvantage. I know far more about you.” Realising that made him sound like a stalker (which maybe wasn’t far off?), he clarifies himself. “I’m a consulting detective. I’ve deduced things about you.”
Once caught, the scarecrow apparently felt no need to conceal that it was capable of movement, and continued hopping towards John.
Watson smiled, though his eyes remained grim. “I’m afraid he wasn’t a very good husband, Holmes, which she realized too late. In fact, I imagine she regrets her decision most keenly.”
He heard the band play a quick tune with the fiddler announcing “Mr Watson!”, with a flourish he appreciated, as he walked forward onto the landing. As he stood at the top of the stairs, he felt one of his few genuine smiles growing across his face. He was practically giddy, the excitement of unveiling his costume buzzing through him as he descended the stairs.
Unfortunately, there hadn’t been specific dates in the book, and John’s lack of knowledge was driving him round the bend. Who knew when the idiot would let himself get taken away by a cab at his door. The fourth suicide could occur at any time, after which it was only a matter of hours between Lestrade asking Sherlock to come look at the body, and Sherlock becoming the next victim. John was well aware that the police wouldn’t release that information to the public fast enough for John to react, even if John knew how to react.
“Ah!” Sherlock cried as the kettle boiled, ignoring John, and rushing to pour the water into the pot. Once he was finished, he loaded up the tray, and turned back to John with a smile.
“Even with both of us,” Irene began, after a long beat, “there is not enough power to move it. But, it can be concealed.”
John looked at him rather queerly for a moment. He relished his ability to shock and intrigue John, though in this case he wasn’t entirely sure what to make of John’s expression. John eventually shook his head as if to clear his thoughts, and relocated himself to his armchair and newspaper.
suggested it, John would host the ball even if it made John miserable. Ergo, it was essential someone other than himself float the idea to confirm or disprove his hypothesis. And Lestrade was no help.
Luckily the question Sherlock was most afraid of, and that he would not have known how to answer, John never asked.
“Christ, Sherlock!” John cried, turning away from him for a moment in anger, before swiftly facing him again. “I don’t bloody think like that! I’m not like you, I don’t have double and triple motives for every little thing I do!”
After an hour of laboured walking, his hand stiff where it gripped the handle and pain shooting up his leg, John came to almost regret that decision. At a particularly annoying twinge, John cursed his leg, and threw his cane onto the ground. The cracking sound that followed was the cherry on top of John’s charming afternoon.
John took to carrying the last novel in his front left-breast pocket. It was small enough to fit, and easy enough to slip out on brief breaks to reread the used, dog-eared pages.
The table stretched out in front of him, separating Watson and himself. They might have stared at one another for quite some time, at an impasse, if not for the sound of footsteps on the stairs.
Faces he knew and others he did not were paraded past, and he and John greeted each and every one with forced aplomb.
“I had a plan!” Sherlock protested. “I was going to allow him to kidnap me and then outsmart him, which I could have done easily. Hope, the man was called, thought he was very smart indeed. Thought he’d been chosen especially for this task.”
The Man is sitting down again and in a stroke of luck the seat directly next to him becomes vacant two stops in. Sherlock slides into place. His leg is inches from pressing up against The Man’s.
He adjusted himself in his pants before standing, and turned as soon as he was up, intending to leave before he made a real fool of himself.
There were spells Sherlock worked on without John, which John suspected were from before he’d arrived, like the one involving hearts. There were days where Sherlock would work at the table in complete silence, then drop everything and sprint upstairs. The wheel above the door would be turned to green-side down or blue-side up, and Sherlock would disappear without a word.
“I swear I won’t go back in the cottage, just - you won't send me to the asylum, will you?” Anderson pleaded.
As he passed beneath the archway, he noticed the door to the West corridor had been opened again since last he’d passed it. The sound of the sea was no longer a part of his imagination. He felt he knew exactly what led down that way. He wasn’t sure he was ready for that, either.
The tone of the email could not have been more clear than if, when it had opened, the sound of a record screeching had been played. John’s question had not been with his current partner in mind, which now definitely made John seem like a cheater. John rushed to clear his good name, for the second time in his short history of interaction with SH.
He had rummaged through the desk drawers, and happened upon a rather complete account of the ‘Guests at Manderley’. The volume detailed when visitors had arrived and left, which room they had stayed in, what food they had eaten - she had been meticulous.  As someone who indexed his socks, he had to appreciate the attention to detail. Beneath it, he found a stack of thick creamy writing paper. He had assumed they were all blank, until he lifted one from the drawer to find ‘Mrs Watson’ written in bold print, with ‘Manderley’ written in the other corner. He dropped it as if burned, and forced the drawer shut. He looked around, as if someone might have been watching.
“How so?” Sherlock asked, in an attempt to distract. “Everyone wants to change their tune on that subject.”
‘Watson thought you were abominable, and he pitied me for being stuck with you’, he thought. Despite feeling spiteful, he remained silent, a talent he had mastered in his time as a companion. He opted instead for closing the door in Wilkes’ face. There was enraged spluttering from the other side, but he wasn't concerned about Wilkes. He would presume it was just his companion being odd, and would forget to be affronted, as he so often did.
“You were always so distant,” John said, his brows knit together. “You were so independent, finally able to do your work in peace, without Wilkes hanging over you. You were either out in the woods or about the house with Gladstone, and working all night instead of coming to bed - and I
“Did Mrs Watson have enemies?” Colonel Barclay asked the room at large. “Money-lenders, blackmailers?” John seemed only able to shake his head, and David was at a complete loss.
It was fortunate their room was entirely shrouded in darkness, as he felt his already flushed face grow hotter than if he’d had a fever. He whipped his head away from John, with the rest of his body shortly following suit. For good measure, he scooted himself to the other edge of the bed.
“Good boy, accompanying our guest to the palace,” the man in the floating chair told the dog, and John released an annoyed breath.
His nap was cut short by the sound of voices and of cars pulling up onto the gravel outside. So, the Lady and her fleet had arrived. And he would have the chance to meet with them before John, if the soft snoring behind him was anything to go by.
“Save it Lestrade,” he said, his feet under him once more. “Don’t try to trick me. It won’t work. Are you going to pick up your pen once we’re inside, or will you wait till I’m thoroughly occupied with something else? ‘Today sir your baby brother implied that something
