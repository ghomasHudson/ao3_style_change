Sherlock produced his violin in the evening, playing
"Ha. Well, I'm never bored." John laughed lightly.
Sherlock had immediately known the reason for his son’s presence. He vaguely remembered John inviting him under the duvet in the early hours of the morning. Hamish, his eyes wide and frightened from another nightmare, had scrambled between them and buried himself under John’s arms, his hands unconsciously seeking the dog tags. He’d come to their room, seeking confirmation that they were both still there, so the nightmare had been about them. Though his eye lids were drooping indicating his fear to fall asleep again, they were not red raw; he’d not cried this time. He was curled into John, clutching possessively at the dog tags; the dream had been about John, then. Sherlock watched as Hamish’s thumb trailed absently over the engraved letters. He traced his son’s line of sight as it flickered briefly to where the chain rested over the scarring on John’s shoulder and then to the metal tags resting in his hands. He’d dreamt of the war again. He’d thrash in his sleep, crying out just as John did, plagued by nightmares which weren’t even his own.
John's roaring inferno eventually dwindled and they fell into silence. They didn’t speak for the rest of the day, and as the sun retreated over the horizon, as if retiring into a trench before rising again on the war zone the next day, the silence did not falter.
John shot daggers at him, his expression screaming
“You were told to stay put, Hamish.”
pastime for someone his age...but it
He understood the redundancy of the sentiment before it'd even left his lips. Mrs Hudson's niece would have already seen to it that the flat be tended to.
Changes in his temperament so subtle that they almost weren't there; just gentle shadows and slivers of progress, but Sherlock's sharp edges had softened. The coarse shards of his character had become velvet. And yet, he still became guarded and withdrawn in the face of these new truths. He folded inwards, like the delicate new petals of a flower shying away from their own beauty. The man he had become still unsettled him, still caught him off guard, still
“Ah. No...we can't. Courtesy of the Taliban” George responded grimly.
“Shh, John”, he whispered soothingly. “Come back to me. Come on. It's okay.”
John wasn't sure which possibility he liked least. He shared a glance with Sherlock, and they both nodded an agreement. Priority: getting their son out of there, out of danger.
“I make it difficult enough by myself, thanks” Hamish mumbled beneath his breath, turning his face away briefly before withdrawing his mobile phone from his pocket. As he did so, it buzzed in his hand, indicating an incoming text message.
“Someone who simply inspires you to be the best version of yourself you can be, that’s the true meaning of hero”. He paused, smiling warmly before continuing. “Now, I’m no detective, but even I can tell where your heart really lies.” He gently replaced the sketchbook he’d removed earlier into Hamish’s hands. “Maybe you should start listening to it.”
Hamish's scowl faltered as his mouth quirked upwards slightly. "When have you ever known me to be normal?" John couldn't deny the obvious; Hamish nothing if not extraordinary. That much was certain, but John couldn't help the slight pang of sorrow that Hamish seemingly viewed this as anything less than the blessing that it was. His doubt was promptly shattered as his son's grin widened, indicating his jesting nature, and he continued. "I mean, I didn't stand much of a chance with my parentage did I? After all, one of my Dads is arguably one of the greatest minds to ever live..." He paused briefly, looking away from John as he allowed the words to settle as a gentle warmth over him. "...and the other is Sherlock Holmes."
Sherlock cared. Sherlock loved him, wholly and truly. John knew that he always had. Love and adoration was such a rare thing for anyone to achieve from a Holmes, and John could never undermine the value of the trust he'd gained that allowed Sherlock to leave himself and his heart open to him. But being with someone who didn't display his feelings as openly and honestly as anyone else did was difficult. Everyone needed to see sometimes. Sometimes just
Still not a word was uttered. The nurses had vacated the room now, it was just John and Sherlock. The silence was deafening. John wanted to scream and shout, colour the walls of this damned hospital with his curses and cries. He wanted to wail his lament so every single person could feel every ounce of his pain. He dried his hands, biting down on his top lip with excessive force to keep himself from making a sound. As he turned, he found himself in Sherlock's arms as he pulled John into a vice like embrace. Still not a word came from either of them as Sherlock held him, as John allowed the gravity of their situation to manifest itself into choked sobs. They stood that way for a time which neither of them cared to quantify. They stayed locked and pressed together like the only security the world could offer them was each other.
. Not to his parents though – Sherlock understood him. Despite Sherlock's reluctance to admit it, Hamish was going through the same turbulence that he'd always suffered growing up. Hamish often found himself contemplating what a lonely childhood, no, what a lonely
“It's statistically more likely”, Hamish responded simply. “Now, look.” He directed the mouse to point at the word 'sorry' carved into each of the victims backs. “

John swallowed thickly, granting the man stood in the doorway of 221B a double take. He'd been trundling through his regular morning, typing up the most recent of Sherlock's cases on his blog. Then there had come the sound of those old wooden stairs groaning under the tread of an old friend, and the appearance of Private George Benson had thrown John's 'regular' morning completely. John wasn't sure at which point in his gawping and staring assessment he'd actually risen from his seat, but now he was face to face with his old comrade.
And if the accusations that Sherlock Holmes didn't have a heart were true, it was because it'd just crumbled into ash inside him.
“Are you even listening to me?”
“Do you really think I'd ever knowingly put him in danger?” Sherlock's voice was small now, but not half as small as Sherlock seemed as he continued even more quietly. “You don't trust me.”
, were left implied, and John finally understood the growing restlessness of his son to solve this case. He was still fighting to save whoever was unfortunate enough to have been earmarked for butchery today.
Birthday, relatively simple murder, what Sherlock had called 'an easy starter'. His Dad had been fuming when he'd found out.
Then came the kiss. (Well, then came the punch and an imaginative assortment of colourful words. The kiss was a result of the aftershock.) And just like that, in a flurry of stolen breath and desperate, longing lips, John had trusted Sherlock all over again: trusted him as a lover. Trusted him with his heart.
Of course not. Hamish was already feeling foolish for having doubted him. After all, this wasn't the first time Sherlock had taken him out of school for cases. He smiled to himself the memory of his first case: his 14
John was left, staring blankly into the void he'd left, the empty Sherlock-sized space in the room. He swallowed, his throat tightening, before moving to take a seat at Hamish's beside. He mirrored Sherlock's action by taking hold of Hamish's right hand, and ran the pad of his thumb absently over his son's palm in a soothing motion. Quite whether he was trying to sooth himself or his son, he didn't care to dwell on. He looked back up, into the empty space where Sherlock had been stood, and whispered solemnly “I love you”, before burying his head into the hospital bed clothes and permitting a fresh, but silent, cascade of tears.
“You too, Cap’.” He gave a grave chuckle, casting a brief glance at his leg. That damned leg. “Seems I missed you so much that I went and got m’self injured just to follow your sorry ass home.” He noticed the look in John’s eyes, he’d seen it so many times in the time they’d served together. John had an absurd habit of blaming himself for everyone he couldn’t save. “Long story short”, he continued seeing the unspoken question in John’s eyes, “About 5 months after you were out, routine morning patrol. Wind picked up, you know what that sand and dust is like in those storms - visibility goes to complete shite. Got me separated from Sampson. Before I know it I’m off the beaten track and being thrown in the air by an IED. That was it, goodnight Vienna. Woke up minus a leg in the field hospital.” He gave a good-natured chuckle, offering John a reassuring smile. “Perks of the job, eh?” he added finally.
Suddenly John yearned for his company; needed it like air. He rejected the solitude, he didn't want to be alone anymore.
“She's something of a fan”, Hamish clarifies.
“What does it mean?” he asked, his voice quiet but raw. Sherlock knew he was starting to piece it together; the tags, the scarring, the nightmares. He’d have already deduced the origin of the wound, even if he didn’t understand the circumstances. Sherlock had no doubt that he’d be able to provide an accurate description of the gun model, its range and caliber  the shooter’s distance from its target, maybe even their frame of mind. Hamish was still young, though. Sherlock didn’t want to insult his intelligence by trying to hide John’s past from him and he also didn’t believe in babying him. But he did believe in John, and John was not yet comfortable with burdening their son with that knowledge. Sherlock suspected it was too late for that. They’d have to talk about it soon, but not now.
Fuming was the only word for it. If this had been a cartoon, George could have sworn he'd have been able to see the steam coming off John in the passenger seat. In all the years they'd served together he'd never seen John angry like this. He'd seen him angry in the
“Oh god no...” Hamish looks panic stricken and horrified, but Sherlock's already seized his hands to stop another attempt to gag him.
He had gently prized the notebook and pencil from Hamish’s limp grasp as he’d sat down. Curious, he leafed through the sketches within. Page after page were sketches of aircraft, some which Benson recognized form his time on the front line; Typhoon jets, Chinook helicopters, others which were older than his lifetime but their position in British military history making them known to him: the Spitfire, Lancaster Bomber.  He made a mental note of this for later. He had some favours he could call in, and this kid hadn’t had much of an 18

Lestrade fixed them with a glare. “Do you mind not doing that?” He gestured vaguely in the space between them. “Gives me the creeps.”
Hamish shoots daggers at his Dad, but answers simply “Léa”. John nods his understanding and turns to face the camera, offering a warm smile.
"George, I'm sorry...It's just, you think you've done everything you can for a kid you know?" He ran his hands over his face, puffing out a short breath. George found himself wishing he hadn't met John's eyes then, because in that moment he'd seen a man more broken than the one who left him behind in Afghanistan. There was something more torturous than just hurt in those eyes; it was a sense of
“Relax”, he said, holding up a hand and offering a reassuring smile. “It's nothing but collateral damage. It's not like I haven't lost this leg before, eh?”
, and it was almost wounding, because how could John ever turn him away from a desire like that; a motive so pure?
He vividly remembered the first time he'd called his Uncle “grumpy guts”, aged just five years old; the way Mycroft's features had shifted like the shapes in a kaleidoscope, aligning in a new model of discontent.
“He’s on his way. Behave.” John said, pointing sternly at his son.
“That was the conclusion I reached”, Sherlock replied. He had known that John would want to do whatever was best for Hamish, and he wanted the same. Sherlock had accepted, whether John wanted him around or not, that he would want them to present a front of solidarity for the sake of their son.
Hamish gave a sharp nod before sinking closer to the ground to re-evaluate his earlier conclusion. Sherlock, of course, was right. The body had been dragged, yes, but there were clear marks of more than one set of shoes having moved through the tracks.
John didn't know what he'd expected to find, or who. He wasn't even sure if he'd wanted Sherlock to be there but he couldn't help the slight twist of his gut upon finding the flat empty. The worry had started to nag, tapping ever so slightly at the back of his mind. Sherlock had left the hospital some hours ago, distraught and sorrowful, yet he'd not returned home.
It was suffocating him. If keeping the odd case here and there a secret was what was required to keep the peace, surely that was a price worth paying?
. John was trying
“Is that not one your Dads are better suited to?”

Hamish had said it himself. The accusation had been flung and it was making a beeline straight for John's rapidly sinking heart. How were they so out of tune? When did they start traversing different roads and end up so

been trained on them and poised to shoot, and only their son's somewhat clumsy handling of the chunk of wood and miraculously impeccable timing had stopped either one, or both, of them from having a bullet lodged in their brain.
Benson’s response came almost instantly.
As they settled into the drive through London's streets, with Scotland Yard as their first port of call, the pair felt a somewhat haunting familiarity wash over them. The Private had been reunited with his Captain. It was time for old friendships to reignite. Private Benson had been certain he'd put his army days to bed, but it had transpired that the old beast was waking, and preparing for a new mission.
“I know that one.”
John could make a judgement on whether to trust a man in mere seconds, because often in a war zone that's all the time you have to know a person – and where's the humanity in damned men not trusting one another?
” Without so much as another word, Sherlock was waltzing across the room to retrieve his coat, the coattails flapping as he pulled it on with a flourish.
For the sake of this fic, I'm going on the assumption that the conflict in Afghanistan ended shortly after John was invalided home, so around 2014, and was thus over when Hamish was born. Of course, there are still servicemen and women out there at the moment and my thoughts and support are with each and every one of them, and no offense is intended in any instances in which the war may be referred to lightheartedly throughout this fic.
“I didn’t know you did literature, ‘Mish”, he commented.
Something snapped, and the speed with which the halves of the strands snapped back, pulling away from each other in the cluttered noise of John's head, was enough to give him whiplash. He barked a sickened laugh.
“So the real question here is...” Sherlock encouraged.
“That's 'The World's Only Consulting Detective' to you”, John corrected with a smirk. He shrugged. "Same as living with anyone else. Except Sherlock's...not like everyone else."
“Hold on. Why? If there were two of them why was the body dragged - because it clearly was. What was the second person doing, just watching? Bit chuffin' lazy if you ask me, but

left his lips. In that moment the pieces of the puzzle that were the Holmes boy adjusted and manoeuvred to accommodate each other, not quite harmonising, but co-existing, and George Benson had seen and heard all he needed to. He had not completed his day's work, in fact he had not even started it. He left that unremarkable school soon after the remarkable boy. He'd placed the look in the boy's eyes, and there was no mistaking it, and that was how he found himself at 221B Baker street.
“It destroyed me. I was consumed by guilt, every waking hour, that I’d never done enough to spend time with him. That I was so focused on everything else that I forgot to be his son.” He swallowed hard at the lump in his throat. “So I compensated after he died. From then onwards,
. You trust them because you have no other choice; it's reckless and restrictive and exhilarating in one fell swoop. Joining the army is a leap of faith. You trust in whoever you end up with, because you have to. The choice to trust is stripped away because it's a requirement of the job. Lacking that trust puts everyone's head on the chopping block, because if you can't trust your own then you're fighting for the wrong side. And this was why John trusted Sherlock, because if there was one thing war had taught him, it was how to read a man's heart.
Hamish quirked his head back towards where the painkillers were being fed through his IV drip. “This stuff’s pretty good, I just try not to move too much. Getting shot hurts like a mother-”
Beat.
As they moved off in opposite directions, John indicated for his son to walk ahead of him. “I need you where I can see you”, he clarified, adjusting his grip on the gun in his hand, and levelling out the angle of its barrel. “Stay alert. I'll cover you.” The silence which followed hung heavy and unpleasant, tainting the air with a bitterness which crackled and stung like static electricity between them. It almost paralysed John; afraid to move or speak or
John felt the wind being knocked out of him, like the force of the words had physically propelled him backwards. He looked up, meeting Sherlock's eyes properly for the first time. He'd expected Sherlock to be scathing, sarcastic, nonchalant even, but he'd not expected this. He'd not prepared for the haunting vulnerability in Sherlock's eyes or for the naked and raw honesty with which he'd presented himself now. The sincerity of it had drawn the air from his lungs, and John was drowning in it, suffocating in the aching and wounding and
Sherlock rolls his eyes and groans. “Even

Benson paid regular visits. Daily, in fact. Sometimes his wife joined him on these visits bringing with her offerings of home-cooked food. The scent of lovingly-crafted, sweet, cinnamon buns and warm chicken soup that drifted through those double doors after her brought with it a gentle hum of nostalgia. She provided the kind of mothering that reminded both John and Sherlock so warmly of Mrs Hudson. She, like the nurse, never overstayed her welcome. She offered enough comfort, but gave Sherlock and John valuable time alone, time that they needed, even if they don’t know they needed it.
John was a doctor, and George knew that he was aware that Hamish would not wake or be brought to consciousness by the medical team any time soon. There was no risk of him missing Hamish's return to the waking world. John knew that George knew this, and yet he still contested the demand that he return to Baker Street for even a few hours.
he said, echoing his flatmate's words when John himself had inquired about the skull all those years ago.
He adjusted himself slightly so he was sitting up a little more, and the nurse reached behind him to adjust the pile of pillows propping him up before going about her duties.
at all.
angry. He didn't want to go running to Sherlock this time. He didn't want to be the one to give in and cave first – Sherlock needed to understand that sometimes he was in the wrong, and that John wasn't always going to come running after him to patch things up and check if he was okay. For once John wished that Sherlock would approach
“Why would I think that?”
I am to see you pursuing the family business with such gusto, dear Hamish.” His voice was dripping with sarcasm. “Your parents must be so proud”. Hamish bristled beside him. The mockery he could deal with, but he wouldn't be held responsible for his actions should Mycroft descend into slurs against his parents – of any shape or form. He gritted his teeth, desperately holding his tongue, resisting the urge to deploy a ruthless retort about Mycroft's
John wasted no time in crashing through the door, causing both Hamish and Sherlock to look up with a start, both sets of pupils blown wide by his sudden entrance.
, Private or otherwise, was going to halt him in his mission. Hamish could hear the distinct thud of George's prosthetic as he broke into a run behind him, trying in vain to catch up.
He paid little attention to the fresh clothes he was putting on – he knew that they were clean, warm, and comfortable and that was all he needed. He packed a few more spare items into a duffel bag to take back to the hospital. He moved over to Sherlock's wardrobe, his hand hesitantly hovering over the handle for a few seconds before swinging the door open and retrieving some spare clothes for Sherlock too.

John quirked an eyebrow. “You reckon? I don't know. Seems a bit out of the blue for him, I've never seen him express an interest in it before."
“I'm a Holmes. Make a deduction!”

“Hang on, no, wait...” John began, bewildered. “Where did you even learn to do that, 'Mish?”
“Why?”
He proceeded to pad, barefoot, through the flat and into the kitchen in search of something to satisfy the hunger which had been impatiently swelling and calling from the pit of his stomach since he’d left the hospital. His search of the fridge and so-habitual-it-was-almost-subconscious manoeuvring through the experiments, body parts and
And John laughed too, because everything really was going to be okay.
“When he was 9, he steadfastly believed that Oregano was an illegal substance, and threatened to call the Police when he found it on our spice rack.”
Hamish spied the man's destination: the last empty table only a couple of feet from where he was stood. He observed the man's approach silently, eyeing him with a tempered curiosity. He watched him fumble with the handle on the case, attempting to extend it in order to drag both it and the display board simultaneously. In a few strides, Hamish had moved to meet him, silently taking the display board from the man's grasp and leading him to the waiting table. His hands found their way back into the pockets of his school trousers and he resumed his earlier observational stance. The man looked at him, his grey eyes yielding curiosity. Hamish wasn't used to looks like that, people would usually run a mile, but this man was utterly unphased by him. Battle worn eyes, older than the rest of his face, withered and aged by war. Hamish was acutely aware of the fact that the man's hands had halted in their habitual actions of unpacking leaflets and information packs from the case onto the table. He straightened, turning fully to face Hamish.
“Two sets of DNA. Our victim's blood, and that of his killer. Our messenger here cut himself whilst carving out his apology.”

John gave a grateful nod, pulling his phone from his pocket as they descended the stairs and left the flat. He composed a new message to Lestrade, grimacing slightly as he hit send.
“Benson”
He swiftly cleared away his dirty dishes and returned to the pile of post on the desk. He shuffled through the selection of envelopes, casting only cursory glances at each of them as he wandered into the hallway towards the bedroom.
“I’ll only be a few hours, call me if you need anything, okay?”

Sherlock answered his son in a quiet but level tone, stating simply; “It means he’s a hero.”
Maybe he finally understood what was at stake. He had the aura of a man who had lost everything, and John was struck with the realisation that Sherlock had spent his time
John threw hasty accusations that Sherlock had created a rift between them and Lestrade, that his stupid stunt had made their friendship and working relationship uncomfortable. Sherlock, to his credit, tried to defend Lestrade as far as he could, trying to take the brunt of the blame. But John was like an angry bull, and each of Sherlock's frantic excuses, each of his desperate attempts to apologise and to calm John down, acted only as another red flag. His rage was white hot, scalding and bitter, and then it was red, a fiery passionate rage. It was the sizzling heartbreak all over again.
“Not a word.” John cut Sherlock off sharply, his voice steady but firm. “Outside now.” Sherlock Holmes seldom listened to a soul, much less took orders from them. But something about John's steely composure, and the hard glare he was fixing Sherlock with, startled the detective into obedience. He followed John from the room without a murmur, leaving their son in the company of Private Benson, who had sat himself opposite Hamish as he eventually turned back to his microscope.
In which Hamish visits his first proper murder scene, and is thrown in at the deep end with a case inherently more intriguing than Sherlock had expected.
Sherlock finally raised his gaze, and nodded sharply, yet remained silent.
sulky teenager was a difficult cocktail of characteristics. But, as he was with Sherlock, John was hopelessly and stupidly at Hamish's mercy. The boy had a way with words, those piercing blue eyes, that soft innocent look to his face which he had mastered in manipulating to his own ends. He had that overpowering
John was silent. He simply had no more words left to express how sickeningly and dizzyingly angry he was. In front of him was the very person he'd banished from this excursion, panting and breathless and eyes wide with a mixture of panic and adrenaline. It was Sherlock who spoke first, his voice thin and his mouth drawn in a tight line.
that Mycroft could never quite place in the ex-soldier. John scoffed. “Or so I thought. I look out for your brother, and you help me out when I need it. That's pretty much been the status quo from
“Well”, Mycroft continued, “My brother can be quite stubborn on matters concerning you.” He turned to look squarely at his nephew, “he was quite adamant that I escort you personally to the crime scene. Quite what difference he believes it makes is beyond me. But then, he is so often deliberately obtuse.”
to make these two halves form a cohesive whole.
“Sorry?” John asked as he settled into his armchair with the morning's paper.
It took him considerable effort to keep the grimace from his face as he chastised himself internally.
A silence fell again, but not the companionable silence they'd held before. This time it was suffocating and uncomfortable. George swallowed thickly, fixing his full attention on the road, meandering through the throngs of traffic. John was left to his thoughts. The traffic was infuriating him. The claustrophobia of the traffic jam just made him more irritable, and he cursed London for conspiring against him like this. The city he loved so well was throwing bloody
"I'm sorry to disturb you, Doctor Watson," she began shakily as she tucked a stray strand of chestnut hair behind her right ear. "I know you said no visitors, but this man is quite adamant."
“He didn't mean family business”, John stated grimly. “He meant
All words readily applied to John as the day had run it's course. As he looked over at Sherlock, and noted the way the muscles in his shoulders were drawn tight, and his arms were stiff, his face solid and unyielding, he thought that Sherlock at least had the common decency and courtesy to be angry
Sherlock Holmes never missed a thing. He made it his
“Sherlock,” he whispered, blinking a few times to allow his eyes to adjust to the shy beams of moonlight.
Hamish was looking up at Sherlock, his bright eyes open and inquisitive, his small hands gently curled around the dog tags round John’s neck. He’d always held them, since he was a baby, whenever he was in John’s arms. His little fingers would entwine themselves in the chain, the pad of his thumb resting comfortably on the engraved letters of John’s name. John would always wear them on the inside of his shirt. He didn’t like to draw attention to it, but he still relished the feeling of the light metal resting against his chest. It was silent pride, remembrance, respect for his fallen comrades which motivated him to continue wearing them. They were a part of him; not an accessory but and extension of John, a
Later, Sherlock found himself restless, and John found himself to be irritable in response, thrumming with a prickly energy. In fact, he was furious. He was so angry he could barely see straight. It was his only Son's
Here they were again, the air crackling with the static of silence around them. When Sherlock eventually roused himself from his reclusive thoughts a minute or so later, he smiled tightly; a smile that struggled to permeate his gaze.
He unfolded the last two thirds of the paper and, after a moments hesitation and a reassuring nod from Sherlock, began reading:
Hamish grinned. Perfect.
Hamish was looking at his hands now, a sadness passing across his features. He knew where George was coming from. The story was different, but it was the same in so many ways. He poured his heart into becoming the man who would do the Watson-Holmes name proud, into being a perfect reflection of the best of both his parents. He took immense pride in his family, and he adored and admired his parents, but George had made him realise that what he felt every time Sherlock congratulated him on a deduction well made, or every time his Dad ruffled his hair with pride, was a form of happiness, but it wasn’t his. He liked the detective work, and he

“Chisenhale Works. Lovely old abandoned warehouse for a delectably cliché hideout.”
Benson halted typing for a brief second, cocking his head slightly as he smirked. “You broke into the Baskerville research facility. I don't think you're in a position to throw stones here, Watson.”
Sherlock didn't have the luxury of two parents who understood him like a skilled watchmaker could decipher the most intricate workings of the most beautifully complex clock. The way an engineer could understand the elegant mechanics of an aircraft, knowing exactly which pieces made her purr beneath her pilot's fingers. No, Sherlock's life had been lonely and isolated, before John anyway. Sherlock had John, and now Hamish had them both. But he still couldn't keep the dark spectre of that loneliness from haunting him, not always. He withdrew from his thoughts as he opened the door of the sleek black car waiting for him, swiftly changing his expression, smoothing the creases of his furrowed brow.
“Case?” Hamish inquires. Sherlock simply shakes his head in response and Hamish gives a small sigh. “London's criminals are so dull these days, it's borderline rude.” They share a glance and break into light giggles. Sherlock reaches a hand to ruffle Hamish's sandy blonde curls before moving back to his typing. John finally makes an appearance two minutes later.
John was longing and he felt
Sherlock, sat at the desk, tapping away at the keys on John's laptop, quirked an eyebrow. John responded in kind with a short shake of his head, a clear
John’s face split into a grin as he said one last goodbye, and as he left the hospital he felt lighter, drifting in the aura of his son's apparent fondness of his old army companion. There was an affection in Hamish's voice, a softness in his face as he spoke of him, the jovial remark towards Benson's trouble making nature that John knew all too well was wholly accurate.
Sherlock woke slowly with the growing sunlight, before becoming aware of the small warm form between himself and John. John was lying on his back, his legs splayed at an obscure angle, sleeping soundly. His arms enveloped their son, one hand resting delicately on the mop of soft curls.
John silently sank into the soft and welcoming cradle of his armchair before pulling his knees up to his chest and wrapping his arms around them. Sherlock took his bow in his hand once more, and began to play his newly completed melody. The music wasn't as lively and melodic as some of Sherlock's compositions had been in the past, and yet it wasn't at the other end of Sherlock's musical spectrum; it wasn't dark and brooding. The notes danced in the space between them, tenderly coming together to form a soft lullaby. John let the music cloak him, work around him, easing the tension from his muscles as he sank further into the plush fabric of his armchair. Sherlock's movements, as always, were elegant and fluid; manipulating the bow and strings to sing his own soft hymn. Sherlock's arms, gingerly cradling the instrument, span an exquisite harmony, weaving a composition of silk and sweetness.
Apologies for the delay on this one. I've had some personal stuff to sift through and this week has been quite emotionally draining, I've had neither the energy nor motivation to write. Do forgive me. :)
So John had trusted Sherlock: trusted him as a comrade.
“I didn't even know he'd applied for University.” John said finally, dispelling the brief silence that had occupied the space between them.
Beat.
For the first time, Hamish considered how his Dad would feel when he discovered that Hamish had decided to pursue an investigative career. Would he be disappointed that Hamish was following the blazing footsteps of Sherlock Holmes, and not taking after him? Hamish suspected this was an impossibility. His Dad was a kind spirit, a gentle man with an honest heart; he did not harbour such inane feelings as jealousy or disappointment. Yet, Hamish couldn't help but gnaw on that nagging feeling in the back of his mind. When would he be able to tell his Dad? When would
John found himself almost wounded by it.
“How would you describe me, John, resourceful, dynamic, enigmatic?” he'd said as he swanned in, emerging from the shadows, his striking form and smooth tone more than answering his own question.
proud of him. Sherlock impossibly so, though he'd never confess as such. Hamish could see it in the way he looked at him lately, like nothing in the world could ever taint the pride he had in his son, his son who'd followed him so ardently into the career he loved so much. Hamish knew he had a long way to go to reach the levels of finesse with which Sherlock solved a case, to be able to dissect something with such precision, but each time he'd made a spot on deduction or pinpoint accurate observation, he would steal a look at his father. He revelled in the look that crossed Sherlock's features when he made progress, each time his skills were sharpened just that little bit further. Yes, Sherlock was proud of him, there was no doubt. Hamish was certain John was proud of him too, but it was difficult for John to be proud of a talent he wasn't witnessing blossom before him in the way Sherlock was.
“Shh. Shh”, John cooed, hushing him. “We're gonna be okay.” He kissed his son's head before straightening. Hamish was whining now, the tears free-flowing, as the pain ripped through him on every breath. “Hamish. Look at me. Look. We're going to be okay.” And John wasn't thinking again. His hands were working and he wasn't thinking. He was just looking. Holding his son's petrified gaze and whispering soothing words as his hands took over, working with such haunting familiarity as they had so many times before; the life or death of a gunshot wound and the threat of a punctured lung waiting for them like an old friend.
"Not the weirdest I've seen, believe me." John chuckled, taking a sip of his now lukewarm tea.
“Come here.”
“Of course she is – it's in the Benson genes.”
“You didn't tell me.”
“You honestly think I'd ever do something that my Uncle asked?” he asks giving a wry chuckle.
?” He ran a hand through his hair, musing the thick curls. He turned his back to Sherlock, and mimed dragging a corpse as he continued his monologue. He could see Sherlock out the corner of his eye, his face passive, giving nothing away, but he knew he was listening. “Our vic' was dragged, on his front, like this. The person dragging him was moving backwards. Look, here.” He pointed to an area of disturbed soil. “Scuff marks. He stumbled.” He spotted two more similar marks as he moved further. “Several times”, he amended. “Not the mark of an organised, experienced criminal.”
John shook his head, giggling. “Best not to go there.” Benson gave a knowing smile, he could see the look of pure warmth and adoration in John’s eyes. He’d already observed the way his eyes seemed to light up whenever Sherlock’s name was mentioned. It was refreshing to see an old comrade so happy, previous reunions had never gone so well. But John was happy, he’d built a life for himself, and George found himself thanking every deity he could fathom for the blessing of seeing his Captain Watson so contently settled. He thanked them for the blessing of Sherlock Holmes for making him that way.
, heroes too. He was overwhelmed by the pressure of just trying to make them as proud to call him their Son as he was to call them his parents.
“You start then, if you think you can do better!”
Hamish couldn't refrain from grinning. He was buzzing in a post-deduction haze, unashamedly impressed with himself. “Eh, I have been working on it.”
I did was in his name. I woke up every single day and asked myself

“Well I was told to make sure you did some studying – so which subject do you want to start on?”
John looked down at where his hands were clasped around his mug, but offered a gentle smile before giving a slight nod. John had been lost on his return from Afghanistan. Benson had hit the nail on the head really, indirectly, – it was his life with Sherlock that had drawn him away from it all. The war, and what was his life now, felt like the memories of two separate people to him. There was a time when the images of his service would play over and over in the forefront of his mind, plaguing every waking hour and only intensifying whenever he closed his eyes at the end of the day, but being with Sherlock had scratched at the film. Now they merely flickered like an old movie – nothing but a horror story.

By the time the ambulance finally arrives, John feels as though he’s already gone half mad with worry and frustration and the looks on the paramedics’ faces do nothing to appease his fears. Both he and Mrs. Hudson end up coming along in the ambulance. John really feels as though he ought to say something to her, she must be just as shocked and horrified as he is, but nothing comes to mind and he’s honestly too wrung out to open his mouth, so he doesn’t. Mrs. Hudson seems to feel the same and so they sit squeezed together in a corner of the ambulance, both pairs of eyes fixed on Sherlock’s pale face as the paramedics do their best to ascertain his condition and stabilise him, neither of them uttering a word all the way from Baker Street to Bart’s.

But it’s also a stark reminder. John is not the only one with scars. Sherlock has scars too, scars which John has only seen one time. That had been in the harsh, unforgiving lights of the bathroom where they look even uglier than they do under normal circumstances, but it still doesn’t erase the sudden fear that John will look at them and find them unsightly. John’s scar might make him look wild and untamed, but Sherlock’s own scars just make him look like a failure. Someone who wasn’t smart enough, someone who wasn’t fast enough and who had to pay the price for his mistakes. He prays that John won’t be able to read that story in his scars.
John’s whole face lights up.
For a moment, silence. Sherlock waits. Listens to his own heartbeat. One… two…
John nods as well, mostly to himself. He seems to consider Sherlock’s words for a second, turning them around in his head, before he meets Sherlock’s eyes again.
“Yes, there are.”
But now, as far as John is concerned, it’s all done. All the obligatory letters have been written and sent, all the decorations have been hung up (not that there’s that many of them – with the combination of Christmas ornaments and Sherlock’s experiments posing a constant fire hazard, they’ve found the balance through a painful process of trial and error), all the food has been purchased and what can be prepared in advance has been prepared in advance, all the presents have been bought and wrapped (well, alright, he ran out of wrapping paper last night with three presents left to go, but he’s picked up some more today, so wrapping those three is about all that he needs to do before he’ll be all set to go).
The realisation hits him from one second to the next, inevitable and irrevocable.
John swallows. And then swallows again.
It’s raining. Of course it is. When half of London’s cabbies are on strike and there are delays on the Bakerloo line so he, God forbid, has to rub shoulders with depressed businessmen and hungover students and generally endure the cloying company of ordinary people in the claustrophobic enclosure commonly known as the Tube, of course it has to be raining when he finally makes it out on the other side. Mycroft would complain that the universe seems to be conspiring against him today if he did not consider himself thoroughly raised above such utter nonsense.
Not once has he consciously aired the thought of leaving Mary. He’s married to her, he loves her and he’s made her a promise to be by her side in sickness and in health. He owes it to her to at least give it a fucking chance. They’ve been married less than four months, for God’s sake. Considering leaving her now isn’t really trying.
It wasn’t his intention to say this much, much less to raise his voice.
“Well, you’re a doctor, what do you have to say?” Sherlock speaks slowly, sounding tired, but there’s no denying that a certain gleam has been creeping back into his eyes during the last couple of days.
As it nearly always happens these days, John manages to keep himself together as long as Mary is there. They get into the car, John in the passenger seat. They haven’t even left the cemetery parking lot before Mary starts talking of random things, a movie they have just watched, her last conversation with Cath, that elderly man who always comes into the clinic complaining of first this and then that. Before John knows it, they have left the cemetery behind altogether without him catching a last glimpse of the pine. He tries to tell himself that that is a good thing.
“I can’t…”
Sherlock’s denial sounds muddled to his own ears in comparison to the screaming confusion in his head.
This time, there’s no mistaking the look on his face for anything but what it is: sadness.
“All I want is for him to be safe. For him to have a normal childhood, Sherlock.”
He found himself pondering the course choice in Hamish's sleeping hours. He was curious, he'd not seen any inclination towards the subject previously. Then again, he thought, he seemed to have missed a lot regarding his son lately. Maybe this was just the latest in a long line of things he'd not allowed himself the time to notice. He figured that Sherlock's theory was plausible enough, but he couldn't help the tiny little tapping of doubt from somewhere right in the back of his mind.
Sherlock was stood at the window; his dressing gown hung loosely from the lean form silhouetted against the amber glow of the sunrise. His violin rested neatly under his chin as he managed to scrawl a few notations on the sheet music in front of him. Before he cold resume, taking his bow in his hand once more, John spoke.
Sherlock must have had.
he was. How blessed
Across from them, Sherlock was lounged back in a chair, his gangly legs propped up on the desk, tapping away impatiently at the keys on his phone. He huffed irritably. “Are we getting anywhere?”
he considered, most certainly not for the first time. He was just like Sherlock in that sense. Always the outsider, always the
In which George and Hamish have a heart to heart, and Hamish learns something about himself.
Sherlock moved to stand by the bed, looking down at their son where he lay connected by a web of wires to every machine imaginable; keeping him breathing, monitoring his heart, pumping him with fluids and medication to keep him sleeping. The recovery would be long and slow. Hamish looked so broken, and Sherlock thought he may as well have shot Hamish himself – his blood would still be on his hands.
“That's what I thought at first. But then I looked closer. The letters, they're ragged, rushed even. So they were cut quickly and urgently by someone in pure desperation. This isn't a murderer's calling card – it's a genuine apology.” Hamish registered the presence of Sherlock stood next to him, he'd risen from his seat, his interest piqued by this new depth of insight from his son. “So, working pretty much on a hunch”, Hamish continued, “I took some swabs of the scarring and ran a DNA analysis. The results were finalised whilst you two were out there having a domestic.” Both Sherlock and John fixed their son with a heavy glare. Hamish cleared his throat slightly, sheepishly mumbling an apology.
Hamish raised one questioning eyebrow “How to make your own boots?” The corner of his mouth quirked up in a lopsided, cheeky smirk.
John took considerably longer to convince that a whole night in his own bed was a good idea. When he finally gave in to an insistent and stern George Benson on the other end of the phone, and had been reassured that everything was fine, he slipped silently into bed. He'd been surprised to find Sherlock there too, but then he asked himself where else he'd expected Sherlock to sleep. This was
George was good. He was stability. He was something to cling to. John gave a slight nod and the nurse briefly disappeared back out into the corridor. She emerged a few seconds later, pushing Benson in a wheelchair.
It went unsaid, but they both knew what Lestrade had done for him, they both knew that Sherlock would forever be grateful, and they both knew he was too proud to admit it. Greg had made sacrifices for Sherlock, and Sherlock knew he had never once done a single thing to deserve it, but he did know that his son deserved every ounce of Lestrade's attention and adoration which came his way. That and more, because Hamish returned that sentiment. He was like Sherlock in that he often treated Lestrade like an idiot – deservedly so, mostly, because Lestrade
John is cackling by now, but just about regains his composure enough to participate in the mission to embarrass Hamish which thus far seems to be going swimmingly. “That's not even the best one...” he begins. “He still sucks his thumb when he goes to bed.”
“Ah. Well, this is where it gets interesting.” Hamish's eyes were bright now, and he was alive with the blinding aura that always consumed Sherlock whenever he was dancing through a case like this. “They were all beaten pretty badly. The amount of bruising and broken bones would lead you to believe overkill...but the reality is the first victim was

“Am I what?”
There’s a brief pause.
But Sherlock also longs for John and he hates himself for that too. He longs for his smile, his daring, his humour. He longs for the way John doesn’t seem to understand him, yet still manages to get just about everything right every time without Sherlock having to speak a word. He longs for the way John makes everything seem as though it’s alright, encouraging Sherlock to become someone he’s never been, to evolve, to push forward and chart new territory, to be the best version of himself, yet doesn’t berate him when he fails to do so. He longs for John’s acceptance.
He turns to Mary. She looks different too. The easy-going, pleasant, almost jovial expression is gone from her face. Her jaw is now set, pulled up tight, and her lips are pressed together. She doesn’t look unkind, not exactly, but there’s no doubt that the friendly air of the afternoon has shifted and she’s ready to get down to business. Almost as though Sherlock was a child who needed to be put to bed before the adults could talk.
It’s intolerable, it really is. Unbearable. He should be stronger, but he’s not. Time ought to be the cure, but it’s not. His wounds aren’t bleeding anymore, but when was he ever cured of anything the moment he stopped bleeding? Why should he start now? His wounds are scabbed over, that’s what they are. Closed enough to permit him to return somewhat to what could be described as real life and yet ready to be ripped open at any moment. A long coat in the cue for the check out. A mop of dark curls on the other side of the road. A violin in the score of a movie. Two years and he still feels a short, infinitely painful stab at the smallest reminder. No, time definitely isn’t the cure for this ailment. John has grown tired of waiting and changed his tactic.
John raises an eyebrow. “You agree?”
Sherlock raises an eyebrow quizzically. “Of course.”
and in the process altering the way he
So... I started on a one year MSc, moved to a new country, then moved back two months later due to corona lockdown. My mood hasn't been the best and my education leaves me with very little spare time for fics.

Of course, it happens in the least refined way possible. The burst of wind to set off a storm.
Perhaps he smiles a little. At least that’s what he tries to do, whether or not he’s successful in this endeavour is beyond his current level of assessment.
If only his voice didn’t sound so unsure, so defeated. So weak.
, damn it. But how can he when Sherlock pleads with him not to push further? When he looks at John like this, miles and miles of sadness and regret and pain and loneliness and other things John has no idea how to interpret emanating out from him?
John swallows.
Why can’t people see?
Sherlock is quiet. He doesn’t have the faintest clue what he’s supposed to say, what he’s supposed to do, how he’s supposed to respond. In hindsight, he’s been skirting around this for ages. He’s glimpsed it time and time again, but there’s always been those few crucial puzzle pieces missing.
Knowing, or thinking that he knew, that Sherlock was dead… that certainty that he was gone for all time… that had been worse than this. Sherlock is alive. That simple fact matters more than anything else in the world. Focusing on the rise and fall of Sherlock’s chest sends a soothing relief through John, unhampered by everything else. Sherlock is alive. After the Fall, John should actually be surprised by his own worry. Surprised by his fear that Sherlock may not make it through this. Sherlock survived jumping off a seven-storey building onto the pavement below. Now he’s just survived a serious drug overdose. There’s a part of John that genuinely believes Sherlock to be nigh indestructible. A very silly, childish part of him, perhaps, but it’s just about the only comfort he can think up at the moment. When Sherlock had returned after those two years… well, he could have said that he’d survived an avalanche, a volcano eruption and a meteor strike in his absence, that he’d walked through fire and water on his way back to London, and John would have believed it. That Sherlock has lived through all this… that’s as close as you can get to a proof of immortality.
When they finally break apart for more than just a quick breath, it’s not for lack of want. John has not had enough by a longshot, but he accedes that perhaps they ought to slow down just for a moment. It’s a certain level of embarrassment to be kissing like raucous adolescents when you’re both circling 40, John just after and Sherlock just before.
Quiet and empty and deserted inside
Because Sherlock might be alive and that might be what matters… but he’s not awake,

smile, warm and comforting. A little teasing perhaps. But it still always manages to make John feel instantly at ease, no matter how misguided that feeling might be at the moment.
Sherlock makes a quick correction on the music sheet in front of him and starts over. It sounds alright as far as he can judge, though it’s still far from fully satisfactory. Is it even possible to dance to this? Despite copious amounts of research while composing this piece, he still isn’t quite sure how well it’s going to work in practice and this isn’t something he’s willing to compromise on. At least the music ought to be on point, even if there’s only so much a man can do to improve the dancing ability of one John Watson in the course of just one week.
It’s not a lie though. John does miss her. He’s just missed Sherlock more. It’s been a couple of weeks since he left the flat he shares with Mary to stay at the hospital. It’s been three long years since he left the flat he used to share with Sherlock to stay anywhere but there.
John takes a silent breath and steels his resolve, willing himself to keep to the facts and the facts only. Without any apology. Without any too-obvious avoidance.
“I understand, Sherlock. I understand the appeal of an unlimited mind. Did you not think I would? Everything you’ve ever dreamed about within your reach. All the people who’ve outsmarted you, you will be thinking circles around them. All those frustrated nights in the lab or on the sofa waiting for an important mental breakthrough in a case, all of that gone. You could have the answer before they had a chance to ask the question. Maybe you could have the answer before it even happened. The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other. How often have we not theorised that, if you could only attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable? As inevitable as mathematics. You would be able to do that. To grab hold of any one thread of that tangle and pull on it to reveal every secret, every hidden information. All of that within your reach now. Trust me, I understand that temptation. But if you can’t see how irrational, how illogical, how
No triumph. Merely bitterness.
Then he seems to gather momentum to speak, though once again, he takes his time to find the words.
He draws a slightly rasping breath, eyes fixed on a spot on the floor.
“Sherlock.”
If only he didn’t have to make all of these decisions like this, scrambling around in the dark with no rhyme or reason, struck dumb by the smallest conundrums that he used to lay bare with ease. The thought passes his mind, fleetingly, but it’s as though it’s the last small branch that has been keeping a dam at bay. Now it breaks down and so, it feels, does Sherlock.
Mary lingers for a moment, glancing towards John with a look that’s clearly asking him to speak up in her defence. But John doesn’t know what to say. He’s confused by Sherlock’s words and shocked by his suddenly blatant distaste for Mary, but he can’t deny the truth of his argument and that makes him hesitant to defend her. It’s true, he’d told Mary what he wanted and she had blankly refused to abide by that. He’d told her that he needed time and even been clear that he understood if she couldn’t give him that, but she’d gone ahead and completely changed the rules of the discussion, ignoring every word when he'd tried to tell her how
Besides besides, this wasn’t really what he was going to talk about, was it?
Sherlock is back. He’s actually here and alive and it really is him. Which means that all those things that were left unsaid, all those things that John couldn’t bring himself to say to neither his therapist nor Mary nor even Sherlock’s tombstone, all of those things are now relevant again.
“Sherlock!”
. It makes him look smaller somehow, younger, almost like a little child. A child who’s had to face something he never could have been able to imagine and never should have had to experience.
“So I gather.”
The front door closes downstairs and it goes very quiet all of a sudden. As though they’ve both been waiting for this.
! Even his physical body lying on the sofa in safe, familiar Baker Street opens his mouth in a silent scream and Sherlock vaguely feels himself digging his fingernails into his own forehead in an attempt to alleviate the pressure. The intolerable noise is evidently distracting him enough that he’s slipping out of his mind palace.
The staring contest between John and the door carries on for at least ten seconds, but unfortunately, there can only be one winner. John awkwardly bends over, easing the bag from his shoulder down onto the wet pavement and placing the milk and eggs on top. They better not slide down. John isn’t in the mood for any further obstacles.
John’s eyes are growing wet again and he hates it. Hates
There’s something strangely freeing about that notion, even if it doesn’t quite manage to block out the pain in John’s chest. He knows it’s about to burst open. It’s lurking beneath the surface, waiting for the right moment to rear up and engulf him completely. He can feel it coming. As soon as Sherlock falls asleep and he’s left to his own thoughts, he knows it’ll be there, more devastating than he’s currently equipped to realise. And he’ll want to call Mary. He’ll want to call her and say something, anything, to make good the damage that’s been done to their relationship.
Grateful, however, was definitely not the first adjective which could be applied to either Sherlock's or John's current state.
a case.”
Feel free to tell me to bugger off. But those are m'two cents – take 'em or leave 'em.”
They chatted idly, about everything and anything, and even Sherlock felt inclination to offer the odd baritone contribution on occasion. Though he knew that the detective would not admit as such, John was certain that Sherlock had taken a liking to Sarah. She was intelligent, wise beyond the years that her face gave away, yet youthful almost to the point of innocence. She wouldn't bother him, she never intruded upon his quiet brooding. She only spoke to him if he spoke first, which was rare but not wholly non-existent. Brief, simple comments, but laden with neither the sarcasm nor animosity which he so often directed at the majority of the population. John felt a silent pride seeing Sherlock so amenable, and though John wished their meeting could have been under different circumstances, he was glad that Benson had finally introduced them both to his wife.
”, he cried indignantly, “...it's
“You can't prove I'm wrong”, John shoots back.
“Because if we're having this discussion then we're having it face to face. It was not being open enough with each other that got us in this mess.”
“Hamish.”
“Your boss is a liar”, Hamish began coolly as he approached the stand. “There is no promotion, he just wanted you out of the office – you're an embarrassment to the franchise. I'd advise a career change.” Hamish offered an exaggerated sympathetic smile as the banker stood, simply gawping. He finally closed his mouth into a tight firm line and clenched his fist around the paper cup in his right hand, crushing it and spilling its contents.
Sherlock swallowed. “John...” He bit his lip. He didn't know what to follow that with. He'd hoped the gentle caress his voice gave John's name may serve to soothe him slightly, and that the rest would come flowing from him like an untapped oil well. But the truth of it was that Sherlock was so hopelessly lost and out of his depth. What was one supposed to say to their partner when between them in a hospital bed lay their only son in a medically induced coma?
However piqued his curiosity was at the revelation of the sender of that letter, it was apparent that this was heavily outweighed by the sheer level of John's exhaustion, as the next thing that John was aware of was waking several hours later with the letter clutched to his chest. It was getting dark outside and, in the gentle slithers of light that the moon was throwing through the window, John could make out the form of someone sat at the desk.
