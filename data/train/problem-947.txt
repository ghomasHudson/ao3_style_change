"I was just telling Mark," she said, grinning, her eyes bright and sharp, "I normally think weddings are complete bollocks, but this is shaping up to be the best one ever."
John expected a joke to follow, some terrible comment, to steer the conversation, to take it out of the dangerous emotional territory he'd put it in, but Sherlock remained silent. After a moment, he raised his head, and looked at John, watching him. Waiting for him to talk.
But Sherlock seemed barely there, John's name on his lips, a whisper, a stammer, as he allowed himself to be held, as he held very still, and shook, and let John put his hands on him.
He took a deep breath. Sherlock Holmes was in London, home again, where he always should have been, and there was nothing that could keep John Watson from Baker Street, except his own stupid hesitation. He breathed out slowly, took a little turn on the pavement, straightened his shoulders, and stepped toward the door.
He'd understood, from Anika's email, that Sherlock was involved with the planning, but he'd never imagined he would go this far. His world tilted as he read a series of post it notes with single questions on them:
John took another sip of his beer. There was so much more he wanted to say, but it could wait. It was good—it was very good—to be able to say this much.
"We're together," John said. His left hand chose that moment to clench furiously. He allowed it to ball into a fist, refusing to reach over with his other hand and straighten it out. His left shoulder throbbed. "We, ah, live together." He leaned on the desk with his right hand, suddenly unsteady on his feet, a bit dizzy. He wished, fervently, that he'd had the chance to sit down, before they started talking.
A cold disgust rose up in John. He was totally repelled by Mark, by the idea that he could ever shift in Mark's direction, but it was worth the proximity, the mingled breath, and giving Mark exactly what he wanted, to be able to ask the next question. "Who's that?"
He rebelled internally against Mark's idea of Sherlock's fragility. Sherlock was as strong as a lion. He'd survived two years of exile, imprisonment, and torture. He'd held John, when John couldn't keep himself together. Still, John certainly had no interest in living without Sherlock. The last two years had proven that to him. Perhaps Mark was right. Perhaps Sherlock was just the same.
Outside, the van's car alarm bellowed into furious life, jolting both of them. Mark's eyes were on the door, then looking back at John.
He willed his breathing to be slow, and steady. It was not fine, but he could handle, it, or thought he could, until Mark nuzzled the back of his neck, and planted a kiss there.
He couldn't say that he was ready to see Sherlock quite yet. He hadn't managed to see a way to forgive him for pretending to be dead for two years.
"I love you," John told him, combing his fingers through Sherlock's hair. "God, I love you so much." He leaned in, and kissed Sherlock's forehead, kissed his cheek. "I can't believe you're back. Sherlock, I'm so glad. I can't tell you."
Sherlock looked up at something in the corner of the room. Looked like he was fighting the smile that quirked the corner of his mouth. He lost that fight, and broke out into a huge, unabashed grin. Beautiful. He was beautiful. "Exactly. You would have hated it. Like I said. Bad food. People, horribly rude. Serbian postcards, besides, entirely ugly."
The trouble with a lie, with being lied to, was the fact that it was impossible to tell how deep it went. Sometimes, deception ended with someone lying dead on the pavement.
At home, Mark went directly to the kitchen and started fussing about with the food, setting out plates and cutlery, pouring tall glasses of water.
He stumbled, trying to fight, panic gripping him as his muscles grew loose and uncooperative. There were two strange men, then, holding him, guiding him down as he fell onto the pavement. His vision blurred.
Outside, George took out one of his paper sacks, but instead of pulling out the white cakes and distributing them, like he had with the other bee boxes, he placed it down on the open frame, without opening it. He replaced the lid, and laid his hand on it, looking away, across the distant field, bunched his hand into a fist, and knocked on it three times.
He made the bed, taking his time over it, starting with his side, tucking in the corners, thinking about how Mark always made fun of him for it, the way he smoothed the sheets and blankets until they were taut.
"I wasn't sure I would come back," Sherlock mumbled. He studied his hands. A pink scar ran across the back of one of them. John caught a glimpse of a band of red, raw, irritated skin just above the wrist. Sherlock tugged his sleeve down, covering it.
"So if you weren't aware of that Tuesday eleven o'clock pattern, this would help you establish that it's happening."
He worried, a bit, over the idea that Mark had lied to him. He resolved to ask him about it later, if it was still bothering him. Really though, he was probably just being silly. No need to start a fight over nothing.
John suppressed a shiver. He'd never guessed Mark had been involved from the beginning. He supposed it made sense, given his facility with a gun, and his apparent inside knowledge of Moriarty's plans. "You were one of the snipers."
A waiter loomed, as if summoned by magic. "Can I help you with anything, Sir?" French accent. Fantastic. Maybe he knew what he was doing.
Mark was smiling at him, looking like he was ready to push him to the floor and have him right here, in front of everyone.
John turned to the side, admiring himself in the mirror. He looked like a proper groom. A man who was about to get the happy ending he deserved. He thought, with bitterness, about how far away that was. He had miles to go. Months, perhaps. Years.
On the morning of the day John was to be discharged, Mrs. Hudson came to fetch them back to town. The click of the hospital door opening, and the surprised noise she made, woke John, his eyes sliding open to see her suppressing a giggle. Sherlock was asleep in the bed with him, crushed up against John's side, his arm thrown over John's chest, his face buried in the crook of John's neck. Sunlight slanted through the window across the two of them, creating a warm bubble of comfort and healing. Mrs. Hudson backed out of the room, whispering, "I'll just give you a moment." She blew him a kiss as she closed the door.
John had gone with Mark over to the other side of the church, to the small Sunday school classroom Anika had arranged for Mark to use as a dressing room. Mark had smiled rakishly and made a joke about making sure John didn't see his suit before the ceremony. He'd kissed John on the forehead, and winked at him, before sending him on his way. Cath, who'd sat herself down in a child-sized plastic chair in the corner of the room, her lilac gown bunched all around her knees, had raised a glass of champagne to John, and told Mark to strip down to his knickers, laughing uproariously.
"We've already established this," Sherlock said. "It's about taking John away, but he doesn't want to go. Game over. Thank you for playing. Mark had his chance, and, to put not too fine a point on it, blew it. Let's call it done." As he spoke, Sherlock sounded more and more agitated.
Sherlock's gaze lingered on John for a long moment before he spoke. "I'm surprised you're here. Thought you'd be busy. Wedding coming up and all." He was still holding his bow and violin. He placed them back in their case, which was balanced across the arms of his chair, and closed the lid.
As the light came up outside the flat, he scanned the ground in the back garden, eyeing the flagstone under which he'd reburied the tablet and power bank, looking for any sign that he'd failed to hide what he'd done.
Sherlock had said that, in the train carriage. And yet, everything he'd done made it look like he wanted distance. Everything he'd said. What he hadn't said.
It became a ritual between them. For each episode Sherlock related, each thwarted attempt on his life, each criminal cell dismantled, John told him something in return.
Sherlock said nothing, as if he couldn't speak. John remembered how he'd been, himself, in the days after the war, the first couple of weeks in hospital, after he'd been shot. Shut down. Virtually mute. Sherlock was doing much better, but that didn't mean he was okay.
Fortified by the tea, and by the clarity he could finally bring to the situation, he took a deep breath.
"Tell me you packed the pillowcases I made you," Violet said. "John?" she bent down and looked into his face. "He's starting to fade."
He sat on the sofa in the sitting room, wondering why Mark had suddenly grown so bold, going out in the middle of the night when he knew John was a light sleeper, when he knew John would probably wake in the night, and miss him. Then again, perhaps he hadn't had the chance to drug John. John had been careful, or had tried to be.
When Mark came in, all rosy cheeked from exercise and the cold, his racquet bag slung over his shoulder, John told him he didn't want to talk about Sherlock. He asked if they could have a quiet night in, just the two of them. Dinner cooked at home, a bit of telly, and early to bed.
Sherlock had said he was texting the press, back in Baker Street, and John had taken it on faith that he was telling the truth, but that wasn't all of it.
Once their plates were empty, and their feet up on the coffee table, they sipped beer and channel surfed. They landed on the news, which offered a sanitised version of the drama that had gone on beneath the London streets, mentioning Sherlock's role, but leaving John's name out of it altogether, for which John was grateful. The report on the bomb was followed by a story about a spate of murders in the west end. Gunshots to the heads of the victims. No suspects, no witnesses. Everyday stuff, for the police to sort out.
The bottom corner of the blanket on Mark's side was still neatly folded, just like it had been, when John went to bed the night before. The sheet was still tucked between the mattress and box spring, as though Mark had never been to bed at all. Pulling everything out of place was usually the first thing he did when he got in. He was a warm sleeper, warm generally. He liked to stick his feet out when he slept.
"All right, so, world events. An earthquake happens in South America, you take a murder case? Something like that?"
The incident with Bainbridge really had clarified for John how much he'd changed. He was able to see so much more than he had, in the old days. He resolved to trust himself going forward. Pay more attention to his instincts. Listen to himself.
Sherlock had been so strange, blundering into the scene in the restaurant, stumbling back into John's life, as if the last two years were a half-hearted joke that even Sherlock knew wasn't funny.
He never would have believed it was possible, but he could feel it: the world was starting to right itself again.
"Well, no. I just thought that if I knew where he was, I would be able to locate you more easily. Turned out to be true."
He wasn't sure he could forgive him for not quite being his old self, either. This new Sherlock, the one who spammed him with thoughtful texts that offered shy congratulations, and tentative hopes for John's wellbeing, was a bit of a stranger. John didn't know what to do with him.
"And then I found out about all the other women. I didn't have a clue! So, when he was actually arrested for blowing someone's head off, it was quite a relief, to be honest."
John waited until the doors swung closed before he slipped his hand into his pocket. The flash drive was there. He pulled it out, and had a look: there were the letters, AGRA, in black magic marker. Somehow, Mark was trusting him to hold it.
"Okay. Thanks." John watched as Mark walked away, his movements sure. His easy grace, the way he seemed to smooth everything over, was reassuring. Reliable.
"Christ," he said. "Stop it. Stop this. Get Sherlock." He reached his hand out toward the bar, blinking in the direction where he'd last seen Sherlock standing.
Feeling like he couldn't sort how he was supposed to behave any more, John went to the bar, scanning the rest of the room. Sherlock was nowhere to be seen. He'd been gone for fully ten minutes.
Sherlock stared at him like a drowning man. John practically vibrated with heat and need. If Sherlock needed him to play this game, he would, by God, he would make every move he could. He took a step forward, and licked his lips.
"Well, we met six months ago." He didn't share the fact that the trajectory from workmates to lovers had been embarrassingly short, or that Mark had practically moved in, from the first night they'd slept together. His mind offered up an image of the ring box, tucked away in his sock drawer, the proposal he'd never followed through on. He pushed it aside.
—on his right shoulder blade. He'd traced the entire surface of Mark's skin with his eyes, with fingertips and tongue. He couldn't forget that. He refused to forget it, even as a sense memory boiled to the surface, of touching the skin on Sherlock's back, of rough welts under his hands.
"Hello," John said aloud, his voice filled with gravel, as he caught a glimpse of movement on the far side of the field. Something seemed to be moving near the boxes—someone. He tugged the curtain open further. If there were someone there, maybe they would notice that the cabin was occupied. Maybe he could somehow signal for help.
On the dance floor, Mark slipped his arm around Sherlock's waist, watching John watch them. John rested his head in his hand. He was dropping off, dropping away. Wanting Sherlock, wanting desperately for Sherlock to come to him, end this, although he knew he couldn't, not yet. John was waiting for something, waiting for the dark to take him. He allowed himself to relax into it, as the next line in the song washed over him:
He looked toward the front of the church, toward the darkened doorway beside the altar, that led to the vicar's office. He was sure he'd seen a laptop among the vicar's many belongings, under a pile of notepaper and used teacups. It would be completely stupid to run back and check the flash drive now, but it could be done, somehow, at some point. He would wait until Mark was well occupied with the party, figure out a way to make it work.
The ellipsis appeared, and hovered, as Sherlock typed a response. The pause before it arrived seemed endless. John wondered if Sherlock were erasing his own words, retyping, rethinking. When the response came through, it was disappointingly brief.
It would be better not to try to explain. There was nothing to say, really. Nothing to justify. John's thoughts were his own.
"You're sure you don't want one of these other systems? Flashing lights? Sirens? A lot of people feel they work very well to stop potential break-ins."
John shivered. He hadn't wanted to know, he supposed, where Sherlock had been, or what he'd done. In his mind, that time was a blank, an empty space between blood on the pavement and the scene at the Landmark. He was afraid it would hurt to fill it.
They'd been such fools, playing at being friends, when they'd been so much more than that, when they'd been everything for each other.
He felt his temper flare, as Arthur Davies shuffled into a back room and left him alone to change into his street clothes. Sherlock had been here, in this very room, to drop off the watch, had spoken with Arthur Davies. He closed his eyes and inhaled sharply, as if he could catch some hint of Sherlock's scent in the air, some faint trace of  his soap. They were so close, and so necessarily separate.
He took his time, waiting for the shock to settle down, for the right words to come. "I suppose I did. I didn't recognise what those feelings were, though. I always—" he hesitated. The conversation was suddenly touching on everything he'd blurted out in the train carriage. He took a deep breath. "For as long as I can remember, I always liked spending time with men more than with women. I thought of those relationships as friendships. Very close friendships. I didn't think they could be anything more."
Putting on Mark's clothes was like climbing into a fresh point of view, some normal time and place, where life carried on just fine, of its own accord. His shirt smelled faintly of washing powder, a brand different from John's, and Mark's soap or cologne, something reminiscent of cloves.
He was grinning by the time she pulled back to study his expression. She looped her arm around his, and gave his hand a squeeze, as she tugged him along down the hallway. "Well, let's get you to the altar."
"Besides," Sherlock added, "thought you could do with the carbohydrates. You prefer them when you're nervous. Settles you down." His gaze barely met John's before he was studying his plate again.
It couldn't be a coincidence that he'd come into John's life. It wasn't. He must be involved in everything that had happened, in the criminal web that was closing around John and Sherlock, and had been, from the very beginning. Mark was one of them, part of the shadowy, multi-limbed organisation that had caused Sherlock to leave in the first place, that had been the source of so much of John's pain.
He'd said that John would understand the watch, would know what it meant. Perhaps Sherlock wanted to turn back time, as well. Go back to the days when the two of them had been inseparable.
"Hey!" John said. He tried to wander over to them, but there was a hand on his arm, surprisingly strong, holding him back.
It was John's turn to stop. He looked up at the band of sky that was visible above the glass-fronted buildings that lined either side of the south end of Baker Street. It was getting dark, the sky glowing the eerie, dirty orange of urban light pollution, reflected from low clouds. It looked like it was going to snow.
After that, the tablet returned to recording foot traffic in front of the flat. John flipped through the pictures, methodically, still following instinct, still wondering what, exactly, he was looking for. As the record advanced into the early morning hours of November 14, the timestamps between photos grew further apart.
Sherlock took a deep breath. He lifted his chin. "You shouldn't be here now. It isn't safe. If they think we're still—if they think—" He closed his mouth, and took a deep breath, and started over again. "Your association with me makes you a target. You should stay away from me, John."
A slow sense of shock rolled through him. There was something he was missing, some connection that would explain how he'd failed to notice Mark coming and going at all hours. More than once, if he was connected to all of the killings that Sherlock had identified.
John stared at him. "Oh. Oh, Sherlock." He didn't say the name, so much as let it slide out of him, a half formed word, accompanied by a sick sensation. "I see."
The thin veil of resistance guarding John's heart broke open, tore away, and dissolved. He sighed heavily, blinking away the tears that blurred his vision, the terrible dull loathing that had followed him through all the days of Sherlock's absence hitting him hard, having a last go at him. He sat that way, for a full ten minutes. No more texts came through.
"You think I'm nervous?" A bad question. Ridiculous, given that John was about to crawl out of his skin at the hint of talk about the wedding. His knee bounced under the table.
as he went off to help Mrs. Hudson, who hadn't needed helping at all. Later, he'd regretted those words. Blamed himself for Sherlock's death. He hadn't protected him at all. He was trying to now, but he was hurting him, too, doing damage he wasn't sure he could undo.
Meanwhile, the mood among the nurses had shifted, a current of excitement for the upcoming wedding in everything they did. In the afternoon, Jill stopped John in the hall outside his office, to ask if he was ready, and to offer her apologies that her vacation meant she wouldn't be able to attend. Cath handed him a small paper gift bag, with a wink and a nudge, telling him it was a little something he should pack in his suitcase for the honeymoon. Heading back to his office, he opened the bag to find two pillow cases, neatly rolled, the word
John stood alone in the small room that they'd given him to dress in, a sort of sitting area off the vicar's office. He watched himself in a large bevelled mirror, willing himself to be steady. He’d already dressed in his suit trousers, shirt and tie.
As they bundled into their coats, and John tied the blue scarf that was once Sherlock's around his neck, he imagined standing side by side with Sherlock at the wedding. Sherlock would probably love the cake, would most likely make some gruesome joke about the red colour staining the white frosting.
Sherlock's ellipsis appeared, and dropped away again. While John waited for his reply, he skimmed through the articles once more, looking for deeper connections. Three of the victims were in the country on visas: one from Georgia, and two from Serbia. The other two were British citizens, and had criminal records: one had been incarcerated briefly for fraud, and the other had been charged with illegal firearms possession.
The door to the greenhouse cracked open, and there Sherlock was, in a black bespoke suit, white shirt open at the collar, smiling at John shyly. John's breath huffed out of him, all in one go, filling the air between them with white vapour.
All at once, John broke open. All his dreams, his fantasies, came flooding through him, viscerally, despite the audience on the sofa, despite the fact that he was with someone else. None of that mattered, apparently, because all he wanted, all he could think of, in this moment, was running his fingers through Sherlock's hair, tugging his head back, and kissing that long throat; undoing the straining buttons on his shirt, and sliding his hand across his sighing chest.
John deflated a little. He'd been so caught up in trying to get to the vicar's office, that he hadn't stopped to wonder what would happen next. He'd only wanted to push on to this next step, try to bring things to a conclusion as quickly as possible.
. Too late to help your friend," she said to Sherlock. "Sorry about that. Really didn't think he would attack someone who wasn't part of his gang."
Mark smiled and shrugged. "Orphan's lot. No family. Just friends." He'd invited the women from work and their spouses, a couple of men he played racquetball with.
He thought about the way Bill always commented on the blog, the way he'd offered his friendship to John over and over, despite the fact that John was always caught up in his own world. Some hidden gear turned over in John's mind, some broken connection healed, and he realised that it was, perhaps, entirely possible, that these people would try to help him, if he gave them half a chance. He thought of Sherlock, who seemed to have a hundred different points of contact with people whose expertise and assistance he could draw on, when he needed to. For all that he talked about being alone, Sherlock wasn't. Maybe John didn't need to be, either.
John shrugged. "I've seen it. It has the letters A G R A on it. One letter for each one of his group's remaining members, or so he told me. I'm meant to read it when we've gone through with the wedding. After."
A loud rustling sound came from somewhere among the trees, as if someone were crashing through the underbrush. Sherlock was in those woods; John was sure of it. Coming for him. Trying to rescue him. Possibly in need of rescue himself, now. Christ. John could only hope that whatever he was doing, Sherlock wasn't risking everything.
He'd forgotten, in all the excitement, what the wedding would mean for him, and Sherlock, and the tiny, fragile potentials that he'd felt growing between them, all through the afternoon.
John stood, and took a couple of tentative steps forward. He nodded, accepting confirmation of his own suspicions. "Last night. That was them."
Violet nodded, and tapped the left side of his neck, just below the hairline. "Right here. Don't remove it. We need to be smart about this."
John's insides crawled. He tried on a smile. "I suppose it isn't, really—going to change, I mean. We already live together. We're basically going to attend church, have a party, and go on holiday. After that, we'll carry on living together."
A young man—sharp-faced, handsome—watched him from a nearby bench, illuminated by yellow lamplight. John wondered if he was looking to sell some drugs, or, perhaps, to pull. John raised his water bottle, and took a deep drink, then wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, staring openly, until the man looked away.
He went downstairs and ate dinner on autopilot, mushroom risotto chased with a glass of scotch and, at Mark's insistence, more water. Mark did the washing up while John sat and stared into the middle distance, numb, and then it was directly to bed, where he thought he would lie awake for hours, staring at the ceiling.
Violet nodded. "Extortion was part of it, but it wasn't everything. They took Baccarin away, just like they plan to do with you, John. They worked on him, hollowed him out. Baccarin wasn't his own man, by the time Mark and his friends finished with him. He had no idea why he did what he did. In the end, he tried to get out, tried to help us with the investigation, but he barely knew his own name any more. I interviewed him. He was a shell of human being. A set of impulses and drives that barely knew what was happening."
John blinked at the chipped paint on the edge of one of the stairs. "Has he said anything about Mark? About us getting married? It's just—I don't know what I'm walking into up there."
Back in the kitchen, he plugged them in, and shed his winter coat, suddenly too warm. He punched the tablet's power button, impatient to see whatever his security setup had captured, frustrated with himself. He could have been gathering data, all this time.
Harry, in the meantime, had made a long, elaborate show of dividing her time between the bar and the dance. Currently, she was occupying the centre of the floor, dancing furiously to a loud, aggressive track that John didn't recognise at all, but which the nurses seemed to be excited about.
John knew he had to be careful. He was one, small misstep away from running his fingers through Sherlock's curls, because one thing was abundantly clear: this was no stag night. It was most definitely a date, and it wasn't John alone who wanted it to be. There was no better explanation for how hard Sherlock had worked to get him alone, for the candles, the dinner.
John laughed, a little. "Oh my God. Well." John felt a thousand things at once, as the initial panic at being found out subsided. A sharp vulnerability washed over him, along with a sudden plunging sensation, as if his feet had just landed on solid ground, after falling forever. He wasn't sure he liked it. "Doesn't mean I'm ready to launch a career. Those circumstances were particular."
The dregs of their argument fell away, and a thin trickle of relief came in, and John felt the old, familiar sense, that he was caught up in Sherlock's rhythms again. Sherlock put his phone away in his jacket pocket.
John laughed, simple relief washing through him. Of course Mark wasn't really jealous. He was the real boyfriend, the real lover. The husband-to-be, once John got around to asking. John went up on tiptoes, grinning like a fool, and took a box of muesli down from the cupboard. "It wasn't working for me."
He wanted more from Sherlock than this quiet acquiescence. A sudden hope leapt into view, that Sherlock might be about to object, to say that he wanted more. Surely he knew John was still in love with him. That fact was ready to burst through John's every pore, spill out from his lips. He fought a powerful urge to jump up, to yell, to beg Sherlock to fight for him.
John lifted his free hand, and wiggled the finger that had the pulse oximeter clipped to it. "I'm good, I assume."
He remembered Harry's face, scrunched with delight, her fingers in her ears, as they watched the Guy explode, the dry leaves they'd stuffed him with catching fire, and sending tiny sparks up into the cold November night sky. Taking her hand, afterward, and walking her home, while she asked if they could do it all over again the next day.
"What I'm trying to ask is, do you think this Jonathan Small fellow is connected to bonfire night at all?"
He wondered how Sherlock had done it, had lied and deceived, when it came time to fake his death. He'd been crying, as he stood on the edge of the roof of Barts, and spoke to John on the phone. He wondered if Sherlock had felt the way John felt now, in the hours leading up to his performance. Isolated. Terrified. Determined. His tears had probably been well earned.
Arthur Davies nodded. "Oh yes. I fitted him for his first proper suit, when he was a lad. Ten years old. All arms and legs." He smiled at John through his thick glasses. "And look at him now. Grown, and with such good friends."
Mark spun Sherlock in his arms, and Sherlock seemed to smile a bit, and John knew there was a plan, that he had something to do, but he couldn't remember what it was any more. He wrestled with the impression that he was somehow sitting at the table and dancing with Sherlock at the same time. That couldn't be right. If he was over there and still sitting here, it meant that something was terribly wrong.
A potbellied woodstove sat in the corner. Unused, judging by the temperature. Under the table were the two suitcases Mark had packed for them.
Besides, Mark had been practically daring John to confront him for a while now, getting sloppier and sloppier, failing to hide his lies, and leaving his gun for John to find. If he had indeed killed John's double, he'd gone a step further, perhaps wanting to push John over the edge, to force his hand.
Sherlock had been in touch with the press, a fact that John still couldn't quite believe, but he hadn't called the police. He'd always left it up to John to be the responsible one, in the past. That much was still the same. John peeled off his glove, and took out his phone, looking at it for the first time since yesterday.
The two of them were gazing into each others' eyes. John could feel that he didn't have long, before the drug swept him away. He looked at Violet.
John waited, letting the silence spin out between them. He waited for the words to come, to filter up through the mess of feeling he'd been sunk in for the last three and a half days.
John felt a thousand tensions he'd held within him burst, and he softened, and allowed Sherlock to hold him. This was the proof that he hadn't been willing to admit that he needed, not just that Sherlock cared, but that he knew how to take care of his heart. A surprise, on this night, of all nights, in this moment when John could not allow himself to reciprocate. John knew, as if he hadn't before, that he would do anything, absolutely anything, for this man.
It was high time for him to dig up the tablet he'd hidden under the flagstone outside, and see if he could find anything on the week's worth of photos the system had probably recorded. It was unlikely it had caught anything relevant, but at the very least, he could confirm that the cameras were still working, and recharge the tablet and battery, to keep it going for the next little while. If people were being murdered in the neighbourhood, he supposed it couldn't hurt.
Sherlock shook his head. "They’ll get in the way. They always do. This is cleaner, more efficient, just the two of us."
Outside John's office door, someone laughed: a loud, sharp bark, a reminder that the office wasn't as private as it should have been.
Okay. John couldn't blame him. He'd broken Sherlock's heart. They'd both been broken, by time and circumstance, and the terrible things they'd had to do. It was time to try to fix it.
The sound of the ticking wall clock filled the space between them, each second that passed stretching John's determination thinner and thinner, threatening to tear it to shreds. If it broke, he knew he would be very much in danger of confessing everything, all over again.
He tested each placement of his foot for dry sticks and leaves, desperate not to lose the advantage of surprise, as he edged closer. A few more steps, and the voices clarified, and he could make out words, Sherlock's words, spoken in the tone of light disdain he reserved for people he had bested.
For a long moment, John was certain he was going to vomit. His belly was full of wine and an aching need to speak to the ghost standing behind Mark—the ghost Mark stared at now, his eyes running up and down, checking him out, sizing him up.
John slipped the coat out of the garment bag and put it on, doing up the buttons as he watched Sherlock's face, his seriousness, the way his hands shook as he handed John one of the boutonnières. Gently, he took the fabric of John's lapel between his fingers, and pinned the other boutonnière to it.
He watched the city lights go by outside the rain-streaked window of the cab, and felt a powerful impulse to tell the driver to turn around, to drive for Baker Street. Everything would be okay, if he could just see Sherlock one last time, if there was any chance that the watch meant what he thought it did, if there was any chance at all.
Mark walked across the room ahead of John, head held high, turning back to offer him a sly look, as he led them back into the nave, taking a few steps up the aisle, between the pews. The bar of light from the lobby narrowed, then disappeared altogether, as the doors swung shut behind them. In the quiet, darkened space, Mark watched John, head tilted. The muted sounds of the guests filtered in from outside. From the reception hall came the bump and squeak of the sound system being tested.
"Is my sister. She's never done much for me except need me to come peel her away from the pub on occasion. As for the rest of them, I never see the army crowd any more. There's nothing for me here. I think you know that very well." He'd been a target because of his isolation. That much was abundantly obvious. "You've got more friends in London than I do."
"No, no, not at all." Sherlock shuffled toward the woman, arms reaching for her, as if he intended to haul her to her feet. He looked at her, hard, then back at John, then down at his hands, brow furrowed.
John sat with his head bowed over the dinner table, running his thumbs along the edge of the linen napkin he'd put on his dessert plate. All around him, and Mark, and the gathered guests at the five tables they'd managed to fill, stood the fine trappings of the wedding: the white fairy lights draped around the windows of the reception hall; the green and white carnations, sitting in cut crystal vases on each table; the food, a bit bland, but thoroughly decent; the good wine; the dull, innocuous conversation.
John took Mark's hand, rubbing his thumb over his calluses again. He felt the full force of the decisions he'd made while Mark was gone. To sacrifice anything he had to, to make certain that Sherlock was safe. "I suppose the spotlight doesn't matter to me any more. That's what I'm saying." He paused, waiting until the right words came to him. "If it's all right, Mark, if you'll have me, I plan to stick with you."
He knew he could draw on those same resources now, especially now that he was certain that he was right about Mark, now that he'd seen the tangible proof. The gun was real. It was all real.
Back in the old days, John had always framed his ideas about Sherlock speculatively: in case Sherlock was gay, he didn't want to protest too much, didn't want to offend him. In the past six months, as he'd torn down the shoddy cardboard shack of his own identity, he'd come to accept that there was really no mystery to Sherlock's orientation. He might not be interested in a relationship. He might not have the same needs or interests John did, in being with someone on intimate terms. But of course he was gay. Of course he was.
Arthur Davies squinted at him, from behind his thick glasses. "Have a wonderful wedding, Doctor Watson."
When it was all over, John pulled the sheet back over them, and settled on his pillow, overheated, an arm thrown up over his head. Much better. He needed to remember this, remember how good things could be, before his old dreams got hold of him.
Mark left for work ten minutes before John did, mumbling something about a staff meeting he had to attend.
John smiled down at the phone, imagining Sherlock's voice, saying those words. He'd always been critical of the blog, before. Things really had changed.
. He'd seen, and, if he'd met John's double, probably taken it out on him. John schooled his features. He couldn't afford to look startled. He held Mark's gaze, even as he leaned into him, pressing him harder against the counter.
Water was his first priority. He stepped into the kitchen and pulled himself along the counter, turned on the faucet, and watched as the tap spat out a thick gout of wet orange rust, and then a stream of water. He waited until it ran clear, then cupped his hand under it and drank, and drank again. He needed to metabolise out the rest of the drug.
Sherlock was just being cautious, just getting used to being back home. He hadn't meant that John should stay away, not really. Here they were, shoulder to shoulder, like they had been in the old days.
John pulled himself up into a sitting position, unwilling to give Mark any advantage. Mark leaned in for another kiss, catching the corner of John's mouth as John turned his head away.
He smiled, as he moved to Mark's side. His hands moved over the blanket at the foot of the bed, going through the steps of folding it under the mattress.
"Your relationship was a bit of a surprise, to be honest," she told John. "It helped a lot, knowing he was working on developing a more permanent cover for his persona. It meant the situation was stable. On the down side, it also meant, for the first little while, that he was much less active. Harder to trace his associates."
"It was." Sherlock fixed him with a fond gaze. His smile faded, as he took a deep breath. He turned, and looked out the window, swinging the poker in his hand. "I shouldn't have come back, even now."
John hadn't been ready for Sherlock to come in like this, he realised, all long silences and long looks and small, significant gestures. He shook his head to clear it. He supposed he had to get used to Sherlock again, to the fact that he'd never been prepared for him, and probably never would be. And quickly, because he had things to say.
Sherlock sent another picture, a post-mortem photo, also of a bearded man. He'd been shot in the side of the head. His face was distorted by the injury, but he looked very much like the man from the bonfire picture.
"Yes, well. It's been two years." No point in explaining that he and Sherlock hadn't been a couple. They had been, in their way. Of course they had.
The living room and kitchen were quiet, lights off. He called out—just Mark's name, just in case he was still here, waiting in some corner of the kitchen. He checked both rooms again.
Suddenly, it was the worst of the past, all over again. John couldn't say what he needed to say, couldn't explain what he needed, and Sherlock was hurting him all over again, making his decisions for him.
Mark smiled at John, laughter playing across his lips. "You've been avoiding him. Avoiding popping the question."
John ran his fingers through his hair once more, tidying it. Smoothing his jacket down, he took another deep breath, and took out his phone.
There was no time. If it meant protecting Sherlock, he would do anything. He would sacrifice himself. He would fake his way through. He would die, if he had to.
He imagined Anika's response, imagined her shaking her head as she picked up the phone and did John's dirty work for him. His heart fluttered in his chest, as he imagined Sherlock's reaction, imagined going to Baker Street and helping him take every damn piece of paper down from his crime wall. And what might happen then.
He knew beyond a shadow of a doubt, with everything that he had, that it would be worth it, waiting. Sherlock was worth waiting for. John had already waited two years, waited beyond the bounds of life and death. A few more days would be okay. He would survive them, and sort things out, and move on. He took a deep breath, and typed a message.
"All right." Mark pulled his shirt down, rearranging himself, and ran his hand through his hair. "I'll have to go home and change first. Didn't plan for a night out on the town."
Sherlock looked like a man who'd been stricken, some unnameable horror stopping his speech. His mouth was open, a little, his brow, knitted. Then, slowly, he nodded.
"There may not be time for that now." Sherlock stared back at him over the open floorboard, eyes wide.
"I'll definitely take this one," John said. "And can you sell me a tablet, or something similar, that it can talk to? I'd like to get a separate device to go with it, for the monitoring."
"Oh, yeah. Will be. Jill got home at seven this morning, a right mess, but Christopher's going to be fine."
His heart squeezed painfully at the idea of letting go altogether. He couldn't cut Sherlock out of his life. It would be worth a sacrifice, to keep him in it.
, as he'd put it in his comment on the blog. He was still looking to uphold that story. If John did anything to call it into question, anything involving Sherlock, he would surely put a target on his own back.
By nine o'clock he had pulled his bicycle out of the shed. He leaned it up against the back fence so he could clean the chain, and he thought, for the first time in a long while, about the security kit he'd installed. Carefully, he parted the vines that covered the lattice. The camera was still there.
Time spun out between them, slowing down, and the bomb that would never go off stood all around them, an appropriate witness, John thought, to this moment, which had taken forever to arrive. He kissed Sherlock's mouth more firmly, taking Sherlock's lower lip between his. He would go as far as Sherlock allowed. As far as they could. All the way home.
Now, pacing the kitchen, looking at the carefully neutral beige paint he and Mark had chosen together, he folded Mark's note in half, pulling it between his finger and thumb to make a sharp crease. He'd been stuck for so long, in thinking that he owed Mark, because Mark had been there when he'd been at his lowest. He supposed he probably would always be grateful to him, for knowing what John had needed, and for seeing the shape of John's desire, when John couldn't see it for himself.
John swallowed hard against the raw emotion threatening to rise up and choke him. His heart burst into flames in his chest, and he was back, again, in fierce, painful love. It would tear him open, burn him to the ground. He looked up the stairs, and wondered how in the hell he could make himself climb them.
A sharp pang of regret rose to the surface, over what John couldn't have, along with a harsh clang of bitter sadness. He attempted to rearrange his face, into some shape that was appropriate for the present moment. "So? What do you say?"
Moments later, John was sitting at her kitchen table, as if no time had passed at all, as if Sherlock had never died, and John had found his way back to the time when he'd spent afternoons with her, watching crap telly, and doing odd jobs around her flat.
"I need to keep that," John protested, as Mark tugged a t-shirt down over his head, and helped him put his arms through the sleeves. "Arthur Davies made it."
He found himself smiling. He hadn't seen kids following the tradition in years, although he and Harry had done it, on more than one occasion. He remembered taking fistfuls of coins to the shop, and buying cheap fireworks. They'd packed the Guy's pockets with as many as they could, and set him on top of the bonfire.
John had no idea what he was doing. The whole conversation was off its moorings. "Oh, you meant literally."
He went back downstairs and left his pack by the kitchen door, poured coffee, and sipped it, burning his tongue, as he stared out into the back garden, and wondered if anything would ever be right again. A robin hopped across the flagstones in the yard, its red breast bright against the tired grey and green of the winter plants.
He went around to the front garden, and mucked about in the Euonymus shrub that formed a border between the tiny front yard and the pavement. The fact that Sherlock had involved Mark, had enlisted his help, was just ugly. John wasn't a child. Of course he had objected to the idea of separating from Sherlock. He'd taken it hard. But he didn't deserve to be wrangled, to be told what to do. He crouched down, and placed the second camera in the join of two branches, using the tablet to check it. The winter greenery of the shrub hid the camera well enough, but didn't obscure the view of the pavement and street in front of the flat.
The next two dozen or so comments continued along the same track. John let his eyes flutter shut, and he rubbed his forehead, trying to understand why he hadn't seen this coming. Of course people would read into what he'd written. Almost everyone had assumed he and Sherlock were a couple, in the old days.
Mark's name, spoken by Sherlock, broke some tension John had been holding in his gut, in his heart, some bubble of unreality. He didn't want it to be broken. "I'm fine, though. I'm really fine. A bit smoked, but otherwise—"
John stood by the desk, and watched as Sherlock shut the door and leaned on it heavily, as if his parents might decide to come bursting back in. Sherlock watched him, blinking hard, as they listened to the squeaks and groans of the stairs, like a pair of teenagers, waiting for parents to leave, before they really got up to no good. They stood like that, frozen, suspended, until they heard the slam of the street door.
With a sensation like he was falling, John realised that Sherlock hadn't reciprocated anything he had said, hadn't reacted to any of John's confessions. He'd held still while John kissed him. That was all.
"No idea," John said. He wrestled with a brief, and completely irrational, bout of jealousy, followed by an absolute conviction that he had to push through, and finish this insanity once and for all.
He closed the box. He should hide it, he decided, until he'd had the chance to pop the question. He covered it with his napkin. Stupid. He picked it up again, and tucked it into his jacket pocket. When he said the words, that was when he would bring it out. That was when he would make his intention clear.
"But there are ways you could have been in touch. No one had to know. Burner phones, carrier pigeon, I don't know."
John remembered the last time they'd stolen a moment together in the office, remembered kissing Mark for everything he was worth. How natural it had seemed, how caught up he'd been, in slotting their bodies together, and lifting Mark's shirt, and tracing the skin above his waistband.
John knew that Mark had every right to be hurt, that Sherlock had interrupted their big night. That seemed like nothing now, a little thing, easily mended with a joke and a smile, later. Later.
"Best man? Look, you and I both know it shouldn't be Harry. You can't count on her to be sober. If you don't ask him, Sherlock's going to think you don't want him."
Drinks after work became a weekly thing, and then a daily ritual. It wasn't long before drinks turned into dinner, and dinner turned into entire evenings spent lingering over food, until the restaurant closed, then walking slowly through late night streets, going nowhere in particular, while Mark talked about nothing at all: the people at work, where he'd gone to school, his decision to become a nurse.
, the day after the bonfire. John had been in hospital that night. Mark had stayed by his bed, until John had told him to go home, but there would have been plenty of time for him to go out on his own.
They passed along the east side of Portman Square, with its looming trees, branches bare against the late afternoon sky. The sun was going down.
He thought often about his security setup, and the tablet buried under the ground, and wondered what it had recorded, but there was never a time that he was alone in the flat, never a moment when he could unearth it, not without having to explain it all to Mark.
Sherlock frowned. "A flash drive? Really? So strange, that the criminal classes have really never caught on to the cloud."
The lion's share of John's tension left him all at once. The words he'd been choking back left him, and he settled, the raw emotion of everything that had happened sinking down through his feet, leaving him empty, and calmer. "Neither of us," he agreed.
"Is dead, yes. He was—well, he was a junkie. Lestrade was supposed to be watching him, but he said he was going to the loo, and slipped out instead." Sherlock blinked at the candle on the table, then shook his head, as if to clear it. "At least I have access to the scene of his death. A real chance at making some progress."
, the day that Mark had lied to him about where he'd been the night before. He remembered finding the evidence that Mark hadn't slept in their bed. Maybe he hadn't come home at all, until just before John had woken up.
Some movement across the street caught John's eye, as he grappled with himself, trying to find some way to answer Sherlock, because he had to. He must. He tried to speak, unsure of what he would say. "Well, I—"
John pretended to sleep, trying desperately to relax his muscles, as Mark climbed into bed. He remembered the many, many times, in the last six months, when Mark's presence had meant a sense of warmth and comfort. Now, he felt only alarm, and revulsion, as Mark slipped in behind him, and pressed himself up against John's back, slotting his legs in behind John's, and sliding his arm around John's waist.
The DJ, who had started to set up in the corner by the kitchen door, got on his microphone to announce that the staff wanted to clear the tables away for the dance, and that everyone was invited to go out into the lobby for drinks, and another round of dessert. Sherlock stood abruptly, and walked away from the table, not speaking to anyone as he moved to the back of the hall, in the direction of the loos.
And yet. There'd been their careful conversation, the day they caught Jonathan Small, and the veiled promise of the watch and chain. Time slowed, and stopped, and reversed.
Cath raised her eyebrows. "I suppose you could call visiting your husband's family in Iceland exotic."
"Mrs. H." Mark squeezed John's hip. "I texted her a Merry Christmas. Neither of them are in. She's gone to see her sister, and he's off at some family do in the countryside. Won't be back for a couple of days."
Everything they'd said yesterday afternoon, on their way to Baker Street, was tender, personal, and private. And now, here was this public travesty. He'd made an utter shambles of everything.
"Goodbye, John. So nice to meet you at last," she called out. She turned back to Sherlock. "I can't tell you how glad we are, Sherlock. All that time, people thinking the worst of you."
"Yes. He's smart." He was full of discordant emotion, every note playing at once—his grief, his anger, his love, his need. He coached himself to be steady.
Sherlock stopped on the street ahead of him, and looked over his shoulder. The expression on his face was neutral. Cautious, maybe. Maybe curious.
He felt himself break open, felt it all spill out onto the floor, and he couldn't stop himself. "You don't need humanising, Sherlock. You're good. You're a good man."
It seemed like a less than ideal solution, he decided, as he made his way back home, and pulled his bike up over the kerb in front of the flat. Having the gun might provoke some difficult conversations with Mark. John would rather not explain how he'd come to own an illegal firearm, or why he'd kept it. He was quite certain that Mark wasn't the type to be comfortable with a gun in his home.
John thought he'd shut his door. Apparently not. The new nurse leaned against the frame, dressed in a loose-fitting cotton uniform: dark trousers, and a white, almost see-through top. Blond hair, cut short like John's, and a ruddy complexion colouring round cheeks.
"I texted you, and I didn't hear back, and that was when I started to worry, a bit." His voice grew quieter, more strained. He shifted in his chair, and looked toward the doorway of the room, as if trying to figure out what he should say.
Sherlock frowned down into the mug, and made a smacking sound with his lips. John fidgeted through the silence that followed.
Toward the bottom of the article, there'd been a picture of John and Mark, standing together, Mark's arm around John's back. The caption read:
Whatever fear he was supposed to feel, for his life, for the explosion that threatened all around them, was completely secondary to the fear he felt for his heart, which was, even at this moment, throbbing with a certainty that was both terrifying and utterly liberating. It only wanted one thing.
The clerk was a younger man, tall and lanky, with thick waves of auburn hair brushed back from his forehead. The name on his tag was
"Thanks," John said, flatly, panic flaring to the surface. "I'll be in touch with the details. Or Mark will. The wedding planner. Someone. Thanks again." He had to get away, get out, before he broke down, before he broke everything he'd just done.  He was still holding Sherlock's hand, he realised. Too long. Too much.
Mark chewed the inside of his lip. "Because it's practical. He thinks it would make a good story. You and me, getting married. Him endorsing it, then maybe making a scene. Leaving the wedding early. To clarify, for the people who might still be watching, that you and he aren't—getting along."
The rest of the comments were predictably reactive. John felt the full force of the mess he'd made of his life, and Sherlock's, as he read on:
John knew he was gazing into Sherlock's eyes, and knew he would give in, if it went on for much longer. Sherlock, on the other hand, seemed to crumple under some internal weight, as he looked down, and sighed, and winced, as if something pained him.
Something stirred in John, a hint of a deep, uncomplicated emotion he'd thought he'd never touch again.
Dinner was leftover Chinese and a bottle of lager, consumed while standing at the kitchen counter, staring out at the tiny backyard, and wondering what would happen next.
John squinted at Mark, watching him for any sign of hesitation, any hint that he felt strange, or badly, about any of it. "I probably will."
Unable to stay inside a moment longer, John went out to the shed and fetched his bicycle. He rode it as fast as he could, away from the grim discoveries he'd made, and the terrible days that were still ahead of him.
"I'm not stupid, John. I know that this is all a bit new for you. You're bound to feel two ways about it. Leaving these people."
John had made so many assumptions, about how Sherlock would be, about how Sherlock's bluster and drama would translate into a romantic relationship, into sex.
His stomach churned, as he emerged onto the street outside of Baker Street Station, hope burning through his gut at the prospect of seeing Sherlock again.
John squeezed Mark's cock, briefly speeding the movement of his hand, then growing still again. "Who's that?" he whispered, his voice harsh against Mark's ear. "Last I heard you don't have a family."
Tonight was a point of highest risk. If John passed through this particular crucible, if he could sell Mark on the idea that he was on Mark's side, he would be that much closer to knowing the truth, that much closer to being with Sherlock.
John and Sherlock had stopped him. John felt a sense of new optimism, as they worked through the details of the case with the Met. The two of them were a team again. It wasn't just that, though, that had John feeling as if the clouds had lifted: it was everything they'd said that afternoon.
Mark frowned, and dug his phone out of his pocket. "Hang on," he said, as he thumbed it open. "Ah!" He grinned down at the screen. "This is where we part."
John had spent his days at the clinic with Mark avoiding making a show of what he felt, feeling shy about the fact that they were together. Now, he found his gaze following Mark wherever he went, trying to memorise each gesture, each show of charm and jocularity, for the purpose of writing it into his account of each one of Mark's lies, when everything was done.
Following blind instinct, and full of that helpless feeling that came between dropping a plate and watching it smash to pieces on the floor, John opened the conversation with Sherlock, and read through it until he found what he was looking for. The body discovered on November 5
He knew he was at a dangerous point of balance. This was the thing that had been bothering him since the restaurant, since Sherlock had seemed so affected by the scene of John's date with Mark, and the ring box. The question that had stirred in John's blood since that night was with him all at once, stepping to the forefront of his thoughts, like a villain out of some dark corner, ruining everything.
The proprietor, an old woman with white hair sticking out in all directions, called out to him from the back of the shop. A sleek brown tabby with white socks wound itself around her feet. "Looking for something particular?"
John nodded, his heart full, his mind steady, finally ready to tell Sherlock exactly what he meant to him. "Then I'll come back, just as soon as this is over. It's always been you, Sherlock. You keep me right. I could never be happy with anyone else, and I'm sorry for putting you through all this."
He watched as Jill left the break room. For a moment, he wondered if he should go after her, and ask her directly if Mark had been with them.
The intimacy of the moment, coupled with John's understanding of how much it was costing Sherlock emotionally, threatened to undo him. He sniffed, holding back tears.
"Yup. But you're going to have to keep it quiet. It's a bit sensitive. Involves the wedding. No one can know but you three, Harry here, and Sherlock. Okay?" George and Vince had crowded around, listening, curious about what John had to say.
"I know what you're doing," John murmured, keeping his voice low. "Trying to draw me in. Takes more than that, these days, Sherlock Holmes. You'll have to buy me dinner first."
That would be the text Mark had sent the night before, in response to the coded messages he'd received. The time stamp was 6:45 pm.
John felt the area she'd touched. A thin film, slippery like a fine layer of plastic, sat there. A patch, to deliver the drug transdermally. "Oh," John said. He remembered Mark rubbing that spot, when they were alone together, in the nave, after dinner.
John smiled down at his phone. He couldn't say everything he intended to say. He couldn't tell Sherlock everything that was in his heart, not yet.
Sherlock hitched in his steps, as though his body were momentarily frozen, then carried on walking. If he hadn't been paying such close attention, John might have missed it.
On the far side of the churchyard, a squirrel picked its way among the gravestones. John watched it, full of dread for the task that lay ahead of him.
John assured him that he was taking care of his side of things, even though he wasn't. He planned to. He would.
John pedaled through the streets, going anywhere, going nowhere, rushing past mums with strollers, and couples taking their early evening walks, pushing his speed until his legs were numb, his arse worn out from the bicycle seat, and his lungs, spent. The last of the sunset faded from the sky, and it was nearly full dark.
"But we do," John said, running his thumb over Sherlock's jaw, heady with the idea that he was allowed to do it. "Are you ready to see what we've got?"
The day was cold, the wind high, the sky, overcast. Everything was coated in a dull polish, a sense of finality, of closure. It felt like the last time, the final visit. It wasn't. Of course it wasn't. But he could see his way into a future now, if he squinted just right, and in that future, his graveyard visits might be less frequent, the ache in his chest a little less sharp.
Beneath them, he found the gun. He recognised it immediately: an M9 Beretta. Next to it was a silencer. Both were attached to the bottom of the bag with elastic loops to hold them in place. Underneath, the bag was heavily padded, to cushion the gun, and disguise its shape, so it wouldn't show through the fabric.
He set the folded note aside. When Mark returned, they would have a proper talk. There would be logistics, afterward. People to contact. A wedding to cancel.
Later that week, Mark sat back in his chair after dinner, after they'd gone over the most recent RSVPs from their guest list. "I think we're ready," he said. "Not much left to do now." He smiled at John. "At least, I'm ready."
Sherlock's eyes tracked Mark, until the restaurant door swung shut behind him. He flinched as if he'd been struck, and shrank down in his chair, as if words had run out for him, and, in leaving him, had made him smaller.
He'd isolated himself from his coworkers. He knew that. At first, it had happened because he was barely functioning at all, after Sherlock. Once he started seeing Mark, it was a byproduct of his old habit, of focusing on just one person, throwing everything he had into one relationship. He meant to fix that. Maybe he had the chance to, now that Sherlock was back. He could have Mark, and have—whatever he and Sherlock were to each other. Friends. Colleagues. He skirted around the idea of putting a label on it. Maybe they didn't need labels. Whatever they were, there was nothing wrong with having Sherlock in his life, and having a relationship with Mark.
"Oh." Sherlock shifted on the bench, as if he were suddenly uncomfortable. "Why?" He spoke the question quietly. Shyly.
He continued scanning through the captured images, which recorded more neighbourhood traffic, and him and Mark, coming and going from the house on Sunday. They'd gone out for breakfast, he remembered, and taken a walk after. Sunday nightfall saw a drop in activity, just a couple of neighbours he recognised out for a stroll, and then not much of anything until just before dawn, the next day.
John and Mark celebrated Christmas together, at home, just the two of them. At three in the afternoon, after their gifts to each other were opened, John stood at the kitchen counter, watching a thin, light snow dusting the back garden.
The clock on the wedding planner's wall ticked loudly. John wondered how long they would have to sit here and wait, for an appointment he didn't want to keep.
"It wasn't safe when I left, and it isn't safe now. I haven't even been back a fortnight, and it's already started."
The sound of the front door closing jolted him awake. Mark moved through the downstairs, into the kitchen, his footsteps light, like they always were. The sounds of the refrigerator opening and closing, and a pan being put on the burner, filtered up the stairs. John squinted at the clock. It was 11 am. Long past time for him to get out of bed.
It was easy, and a mercy, John decided, to let them both off the hook. He leaned back in his chair, and tried on a smile. "Couldn't risk me coming over there, then?"
Sherlock was with John in an instant, Mark's gun in his hand, as he knelt over John, holding him, looking down at him, pale and wild with concern.
"When I met you, I didn't know who I was, or what I wanted. All that's changed now, and I suppose you could say I've found a purpose I never imagined I would. You've made me more determined than I've ever been, to be true to myself, and who I am." He was speaking, he realised, with some of the intensity he'd used in the kitchen two nights before.
On Saturday morning, he rose early. Mark had already left the flat—out for his Saturday morning trip to the gym. John walked the neighbourhood, heading for the nearest park, with its quiet paths through tall trees. The autumn air was sharp and damp. The yellow leaves of ash, and the red and orange leaves of oak, covered the lawns. He kicked his way through them, as one thought repeated itself, over and over, one hope, answered by one incontrovertible truth: Sherlock Holmes was alive, and in the world.
The property Mark had taken John to was on the west coast of Cumbria, so the hospital was, likewise, far from London, and far from the London media circus that followed the story of John's kidnapping. John's care team turned out to be fiercely dedicated to protecting his privacy, so no one bothered him as he made his initial recovery.
Berk. He was going to make John play it out, force John's hand. John watched Sherlock for a long moment, then turned away, pacing in the small space at the back of the carriage, hiding a ridiculous grin. "This is it. Oh my God." He knew he didn't sound convincing at all.
When Sherlock was done, John reached for his lapel, and pinned Sherlock's boutonnière in place. He touched it lightly, smiling at the three spiky purple flowers at its centre. He leaned in. They carried a scent like oranges.
He plugged his phone into its charger, and made his way upstairs. He brushed his teeth and flossed, watching himself in the mirror.
John was on his feet, wanting to move toward Sherlock, and at the same time, feeling as though he only had a limited time before he would be forced to bolt from the flat. It was a beginning, he supposed, his heart turning inside out. The whole thing felt wrong, a harsh series of notes clashing with the way he wanted things to be. He battled with himself, schooling his features, reminding himself of how badly it had gone for him, the last time.
John followed it, wondering what elaborate plot Sherlock was working on now, without him. The wall was covered in scrawled notes and schematic drawings. "New case?"
. The hour before dawn on the first night, when John had lain awake, watching Sherlock sleep, and wondering what the hell he was going to do with himself. The long, lingering thoughts he'd had, nearly every day, before the end, that he should say something, do something, about everything he was feeling.
Sherlock had a lot to account for, a great deal to make up to him, but if he cared about John, if John could see more evidence that Sherlock really cared, well. John wasn't sure what he would do. Nothing desperate, he hoped. Nothing foolish.
Sherlock hadn't said anything yet, not really, but John had spent the entire trip home wondering how things would unfold between them, the next time they met, and the next, once he was free.
He raised his gun an inch, channelled all of his remaining strength into his hand and wrist, aimed at Mark's foot, and pulled the trigger.
John closed his eyes. It would be easy, to follow the drift of Mark's conversation, to think about anything besides what had happened earlier today. "You're saying I should be some kind of fixer?" He laughed at the idea. "A vigilante? Not really my style."
He took a step back, and looked up at the dozen or so other home security kit options the store carried, along with the individually packaged cameras to his right. He fought a momentary spell of dizziness, took a deep breath, and settled himself. He didn't feel right in his body. He didn't expect to.
He'd done what he had to do. Things had reached their final configuration. He could relax about it now. Sink into his new life, like he'd planned.
, a set of observations about the minister's personal habits that might interfere with his ability to deliver an effective service, and suggestions for ensuring he remained in good trim. There was a cryptic note, appended to the end, which made John's heart squeeze in his chest:
The morning of New Year's Eve dawned pale and gold. John stood at the kitchen counter, sipping coffee, and watching the sky slowly turn the washed out blue that reminded him of long childhood winter days spent playing outdoors. He remembered keeping Harry away from the house, even though it was cold out. Trying to keep her warm with one more run around the park, one more turn on the seesaw, one more game. They would play hide and seek, and when she found him, he would tickle her until she was gasping with laughter, pink-cheeked and grinning and begging him to hide again.
"Here," Sherlock said, stepping in close to John, and bringing his hands out from behind his back. He held two identical boutonnières, one for each of them. "Put on your suit coat."
Three days seemed like a long time to wait, now that John had made up his mind about leaving. He indulged in a fantasy, brief, and sweet, and wrong, of packing his things, going back to Baker Street immediately, and leaving a note of his own for Mark to find.
John watched Sherlock carefully, looking for any sign that he understood what was really going on, that he was covering up any discoveries he'd made, but Sherlock, for his part, seemed a bit lost, watching John with a pleading look.
He paused as he landed on a picture of Mark, returning home at 5:15, letting himself in through the front gate. The camera above the door captured a second photo, a view of Mark's shoulders as he hunched to put his key in the lock. Fifteen minutes later, John himself passed through to the side gate, walking his bike. The camera on the back fence showed a few images of him locking it away in the garden shed, and going in through the back door, into the kitchen. The same camera had taken a picture of the sudden yellow glow of the kitchen light, shining out through the window.
John held still. He was afraid to move, afraid that all he was capable of doing, in this moment, was starting a physical fight that would end when one of them was dead.
The fully formed sentence rose unbidden, a blooming, all in a rush, of all the things he'd never gotten to say. Hadn't said yet.
Mark's soft smile was barely visible in the light from the hallway. In this moment, in the bed they'd shared all these months, he looked just like an ordinary man. "You sure I can't persuade you to give me a bit of your time, before you drop off?" His hand dropped between them, and tugged at the waistband of John's pants.
"Amazing." Mark poured himself a cup of coffee, and settled in at the table. He crowed about the food, and chattered about some former workmate he'd run into at the gym.
Outside the cramped sanctuary of the vicar's office, the church and its attached hall was ready to host a beautiful, if small, wedding. Anika had outdone herself. She'd greeted John and Mark at the door of the church an hour earlier, and taken them on a quick tour of the place. The chapel and the reception hall were covered in fairy lights, and green and white carnations, the tables already laid out for the dinner that would follow the ceremony.
"So much for crack shot John Watson," Mark said, aiming his gun at John's head, as he moved toward John's gun hand, ready to step on it. "I suppose I'll have to kill you both."
He stood, and went downstairs, moving cautiously, wishing he had his gun, feeling utterly vulnerable in his pants and t-shirt.
The bed was made, but badly so, one of the pillows thrown on the floor. In accordance with old habit, he straightened the covers, and put the pillow back in its place.
"I might just do that." John smiled, despite the total invasion of his privacy. Because of it. He hadn't stopped thinking about Sherlock at any point in the last few weeks. It seemed that maybe Sherlock had been thinking about him as well.
Mark approached, and put his arms around John's waist, and nuzzled the side of his neck. "I know this is confusing as hell," he murmured. "Just—let's have dinner. Take some time. You can sort it out in the morning. Or next week. Whenever."
In the cab, on the way home, Mark was silent. John reached for his hand, interlacing their fingers, the warm comfort anchoring John to the present. The cabbie eyed them in the rear view mirror. John lifted Mark's hand to his lips, defiant, daring the cabbie to say anything, and kissed his knuckles.
The real point was dealing with the threat to his safety. The remainder of Moriarty's network were the type to gather information and plan, before they struck. He needed something that recorded all activity, so he could analyse it himself. He wanted to see the patterns. "I mainly wanted it so I could know what's going on outside the flat normally, if that makes sense. Sort of a neighbourhood watch idea."
"Why can't you?" Sherlock asked, his voice so quiet, John could practically hear his heart breaking.
The two of them walked on toward 221B, in silence, as hope bloomed savagely in John's chest, a new, brighter, more durable flame. The idea had never occurred to him, in the old days, that Sherlock might have been just as unsure as John was, about what he wanted, about what John wanted. Sherlock had always seemed so certain of everything.
"You're—welcome." Sherlock seemed to be trying polite discourse on for size. His tone suggested it was too small, heavy, and excessively scratchy.
He thought of the bloke in the park, and touched himself, his cock springing to life under his hand. His mind drifted through vague notions of eyes on him, hands on him. A deep rumble of a voice, speaking his name. He came moments later, hot streams of come joining the water from the shower as it beat down on his naked back, and flowed across his hips, over the curl of his fist.
He hadn't meant to fall asleep. He sat up with a gasp, nightmares still running over the surface of his skin: images of Sherlock, his coat dropping to the floor, over and over, in the sitting room at 221B, a hundred, a thousand, variations on the same theme. Sometimes, the coat had landed in soft folds on the sitting room rug, and Sherlock had stood there, naked and shivering, then turned to reveal the skin of his back, crawling with worms; sometimes, it had hit the ground with a dull clang, and Sherlock had disappeared altogether, leaving John alone in the sitting room, filled with the same regret and despair he'd felt in the days after Sherlock's death. In the background, a male voice had shouted accusations, calling John names.
A few minutes later, he let himself in through the front door at 221B. The sound of Sherlock's violin filtered down the stairs, a high, sweet tune in three quarter time, something John didn't recognise. He eased the door shut, hoping that Sherlock wouldn't stop playing, that he hadn't heard John come in.
Asking for confirmation, then. Reassurance, John supposed. He would give it. He would give anything, to have Sherlock trust him again. "Best friend. Of course you are."
"So you think it's a bomb, then? A tube carriage, hidden away somewhere, carrying a bomb," he asked, marvelling at the scope of what they were about to do, as he and Sherlock moved past a series of wall adverts.
"I think you know it isn't that simple, or we would have done it already. We've been waiting for him to finish here, because when he's done, we expect him to return to the fold. To go to a physical, central location, which we still haven't identified, where the key members of his group will gather, so he can start the next phase."
John stared at the flowers decorating Sherlock's grave. Maybe they were from some of Sherlock's fans. They'd been coming back around, now that Sherlock's name had been cleared. The blog had seen a lot more traffic lately.
He had an answer now, too, for the post-it note with the question about Sholto he'd seen on Sherlock's crime wall.
Sherlock leaned down, his gaze warmer than John had ever known it to be, the line of his mouth broken, his love for John shining out through his every feature, more luminous than the moon. "Please don't die, John. Never die."
And there it was. Of course they were going to talk about it. Of course they needed to. John swallowed hard, against the impulse to deny everything.
"And you think Sherlock won't find me here? Before you have the chance to mess with my head?" John didn't want to play the conversation game any longer, but he had to keep Mark occupied, while he combed through George's actions once more, and tried to decipher his hand signals. They had to be deliberate. The man had all but declared his alignment with John, when he'd said that bit about all wars being the same.
Toward the end of the day, a knock came at his office door, and Mark's face poked around the edge of it. "Hey, handsome."
John was half hard, his body responding to the touch, and the adrenaline, but that fact only made him feel colder inside. He took Mark by the wrist, squeezing the bones together until he saw the first hint of a wince in the corner of Mark's eyes. He put Mark's hand back on the edge of the counter, and pressed against it, to hold it there. "Had a talk, did you?"
He used a spoon to squeeze the tea bag, forcing it to steep, a thick jumble of emotions running through him. Sherlock really did care about him, really did love him. These complete strangers, these absolute villains, had seen it when John couldn't.
"Look, I don't want to be awful, but he's too polished for you," Bill said, looking at Mark. "Your favourite people tend to be a little bit on the rusty side."
notice had replaced the whole ugly mess. He wondered, in a high panic, if he shouldn't just delete the post as well, pretend that it had never happened.
Wednesday morning of that same week, that was when it had all started, between them. John had set out from his flat, riding his bicycle under thick, dark clouds, not caring that it was threatening an early spring rain, daring the storm to take him. Wishing it would wash him down the drain, if he was honest. Three quarters of the way to the clinic, the clouds had opened, and sheets of rain had soaked him through in a matter of moments.
Sherlock shrugged. "Oh, just occupying myself. Sometimes, it’s so hard not smoking." He tilted his head back as if to howl, exposing the long line of his neck.
"Okay." He took a step back, scanning the other kits on the shelf one last time. "Yeah, this one, I think."
"It's our best chance to get them," she said. "The other members of his group worked on Baccarin together. He'll want to do the same with you. If you're taken out of the picture now, John, the investigation is finished."
Tom wanted Mark to invest in was getting back together, but, as far as Mark had described the situation, the breakup had been messy, and Mark wanted nothing to do with him.
The ring box sat in the centre of the table like an accusation. John picked it up and tucked it back into his jacket pocket. Sherlock's eyes tracked his movements, and, although John would not have guessed it was possible, more colour drained from his cheeks.
"Hello," he said. He shut the street door carefully, breathing hard. The familiar hush settled on the hallway, the sounds from the outside world, muted.
"I think—" John started. This was important. He needed to get it right. He never knew when they would have the chance to talk again, or if Sherlock would shut things down. "I could say that I was embarrassed, that I wanted more than friendship, from a man. Or I could say that I was afraid of having to change the way I thought of myself." He took a deep breath. "But that's all rubbish, really. I think, when it comes down to it, I believed I didn't deserve it."
Sherlock was still ranting, talking rapidly about how hard he'd tried, how he'd traced the case back to someone in John's clinic, but he couldn't sort out who, and the trail had grown cold.
"I believe you," Violet said. "I really do. But you can see why Mark would try it anyway. John would be the jewel in the crown of his career: making a new nemesis for you, turning the one man you love most against you."
He wanted John on his heels, wanted to see what would happen, if there were no time left, if they were both in mortal danger. Well. John would certainly show him.
The voices of the crowd began to lift, to cheer. John's vision grew dim, then brightened again, and he blinked, and he could see well enough to tell that the shapes surrounding him were branches, and broken pieces of wooden pallets, scrap wood.
"Promise?" his mother asked, even as Sherlock tried to shut the door in her face. She stuck her shoe in, kept the gap open.
"It's all right." John's whole body burned with need. He covered Sherlock's hand, pressed against his heart, with his own.
John smiled, and he felt everything for Sherlock, love and care and understanding. "No. I know it would be torture for you, Sherlock. I'm not putting you through that."
Another set of hands was on his back, helping him sit up. John managed to turn his head, and caught sight of the pale gold of Mark's hair, and the red wool of his winter coat.
He rolled over to find the covers peeled back, and the bed empty. He sat up, listening, for a long while, in the dark, for footsteps, for the sound of the telly turned down low, for some sign that Mark was in the flat.
His gut clenched as he found the first images of Mark, taken first from the street, and then from the camera by the front door, as he came home from the gym, his hair tousled with sweat, his black racquet bag slung over his shoulder, ruddy-faced and smiling, even though he was all by himself, even though there was no one to see.
"You've got a few more minutes left in you," Mark said. "Time enough for one more dance." He smiled. He looked so pleasant. He always had looked nice, and smart, and like he meant well. Appearances. Couldn't count on them for anything.
He put the drive back into his pocket, and rushed to go back out to the lobby, wondering where in the hell Sherlock had gotten to.
They made their way back down to her flat, where she poured strong tea and gave him warm lemon squares on an ancient blue plate. She asked all the right questions: how he and Mark met, how they'd started seeing each other, when she could meet him. John managed to ask some advice about the proposal, and what she thought about a winter wedding, and if she knew of a place they could use for the reception. She sent him home with the names of three good caterers and a wedding planner, scrawled in her shaky handwriting, on a piece of floral notepaper.
"Shhh. Stop. Just stop." They were utterly alone, no phone signal, hundreds of feet of disused service tunnels between them and anyone else. Clever Sherlock, bringing them here. "I'm glad you're back. So glad. It's okay." John whispered the words. He stepped forward, leaving no space between them, his hand brushing against Sherlock's, where it hung uselessly by his side.
His smile turned into something decidedly feral. "You can talk to me anytime, John. Ask me anything. You know that."
Now that John had the chance to look more closely at the room, he saw that there were candles everywhere—on the bookshelves, on a low side table next to the chairs in the corner. They were supplemented by a couple of battery powered lamps. He looked up, trying to see the original structure of the place. The ceiling was made up of metal beams and tin roofing material. The whole thing felt like a secret cave, a hidden place, completely out of the way. Marvellous.
Mark squirmed against John a little, putting one hand around John's waist, the other on his shoulder. The two of them were locked together. Before John's eyes, the drunk act evaporated, high alert coming into Mark's features, his eyes sharpening. Good. They weren't playing on that level any more.
The sliver of hope that had been sitting with him, nestled in his chest since the night before, burst into full, bright, painful glory. He didn't believe, not for one moment, that Sherlock would bring them down into the dark, if it only meant their deaths.
, John thought, as he shut the door behind him, and hurried along the path, his feet crunching on the frostbitten ground, his breath sounding ragged in his ears, the naked trees bearing close, silent witness to his pain, to the small triumph of this moment.
Sherlock had put so much care into choosing John's clothes. John had always done his best to dress in a way that worked for him, but he looked better, by a long shot, than he ever had. The irony of it all, the bloody tragedy, rolled over him, as he realised that the thing he wanted most in this moment was for Sherlock to be here. John wanted, more than anything, to see the expression on Sherlock's face shift, as he saw John, dressed in the clothes he had picked for him.
He straightened his jacket. He'd chosen his clothes carefully. He was good for a run through the streets, if one should be necessary. He'd taken care with his appearance, too. Shaved again, to take care of five o'clock shadow. He'd studied himself, in the bathroom mirror at the clinic, asked himself if he was doing the right thing. Decided, for the hundredth time, that he could only care so much about what was right.
Mark laughed. "That probably wouldn't be necessary. Not that I know anything about it, but it seems to me like the people we're talking about, if they do have an eye on you, they probably get in touch with you, rather than the other way around."
"It's all right, John." Sherlock's voice was disturbingly calm and steady, as if he'd reached some point of internal resolve. "I could do with a little humanisation. You always said."
John laughed, and straightened out the tablecloth in front of him, more shaken than he should have been. He took a deep breath, and blew it out again. It was probably a leftover bit of trauma, but he hated the feeling of watching Mark leave, when everything hung in this sweet balance, the two of them ready to take their next step. The timing was frankly ridiculous. Still, he couldn't deny Mark anything, not when he knew he'd be kissing him soon enough, under circumstances that should make both of them happy.
Sherlock spoke, his voice as shaky as the rest of him. "Moriarty had arranged snipers. One for you, one for Lestrade, and one for Mrs. Hudson. If I didn't jump, he was going to have you all killed. He knew I cared about them, but I—I let it slip that you were the person I care about most, the one person whose loss would devastate me. I couldn't let him kill you. And now you're a target again. It's not over. Do you see? It will never be over."
His breath loud and ragged in his ears, John crouched, and ran for the bee boxes. He paused as he reached the one George had knocked on three times. Carefully, he lifted the lid, keeping an eye on the woods, and being careful not to disturb the bees. He lifted the top frame, and found the paper bag, just as George had left it. The clustered bees circulated slowly, exploring the edges of the paper.
"After the wedding," John told him, stepping in close, "you and I, we're going to read that, and have a real talk." He concealed nothing of the rage he felt, nothing of his disdain. It was Mark's native language, after all.
"Now: guest list." She flipped open her binder, and frowned at a printout of an email message John had sent her. "About twenty in total, if I understand this correctly."
John put the bag down, sat at his desk, and scrubbed his face with his hands. People were, essentially, nice. Remembering that would help him get through the next few days, he hoped.
John's stomach dropped. He couldn't expect Sherlock to come. They weren't even speaking to each other. They couldn't. For John's safety, or so Sherlock had told him.
This neglected place, with its weeds and overgrown trees, was a part of the London battlefield, the site of a major win for John's enemy. Thomas Baccarin had died in this churchyard. Mark had shot him here, while John slept in the hospital, after bonfire night.
Sherlock had been in the papers again, a couple of days ago, for solving a case of false identity. A young man had tricked a woman into believing that he was the son she'd given up for adoption, twenty years before. He'd moved in with her, and had been slowly draining her bank account, and selling her jewellery. As a final flourish, the papers had added that Sherlock had found the woman's actual son, and advised both of them never to meet.
"Yeah." Mark bit his lip, his brows raising, as a laugh sniffed out through his nose. He shook his head. "Got in front of this bloke and his girlfriend on a bike, and stopped them dead in the street. Flashed some sort of badge, police or something, and the next thing I knew, he was handing me a helmet, and the two of us were tearing off through the city, on our way to save you. He's a total nutter. Drove us down the Duke of York steps."
"You two," Cath told him, after watching them stare at each other over coffee in the break room. "You might as well be married already."
The vicar's ancient chair gave a loud squeak of protest as Sherlock turned to face Agent Violet Smith. "So the answer is simple. Since the CIA and MI6 are finally catching up, you should just do your job. Detain Mark now. Interrogate him. Protect us. Isn't that what you people are supposed to do?"
"Really?" John turned the box over in his hands. The blurb on the side of it hadn't looked any different from the other boxes on the shelves in front of him. "Why this one?"
Her eyes on his were pleading, full of frustration. She'd taken care of him, at first. She'd seen how bad it was. Well, almost. It had gotten worse, in the latter half of the first year, after he'd moved to his new flat, when he'd been certain he couldn't go on living, and he'd spent the better part of his time at the bottom of a bottle.
John's heart clenched in his chest. He was suddenly, violently nervous. "He has?" He took a step closer to her, and lowered his voice. "Has he said anything to you?"
"Must have been strange for you, killing someone who looked like me." John pulled back, and summoning every ounce of strength that he had, stared into Mark's eyes until he broke.
John clenched his teeth, and put his forehead against Mark's, trusting the proximity to hide his ugly grimace. "Here's what I know. I know you're going to cause me trouble. That's enough for me."
John lost his footing as he rounded the corner, and leaned his hand against the damp brick wall of the church, and paused to get his breath.
Sherlock sighed, and let his hand drop away from the computer. "For possibly the first time in my life, I can honestly say I wish I didn't have a case." He turned, and looked up at John, his expression soft, and open, and vulnerable.
"Oh." John looked at Mark more closely. They were about the same size, he noted, with more interest than he should have.
"Good luck with that. I won't be your instrument to hurt Sherlock. Let's be clear about that much. This plan of yours will never work."
John handed the phone back to him. "So you saw this, and you understood that it was some kind of warning?"
John parted the curtains a little more, and pressed his hand up against the glass, waiting for the figure to look up at him, wave, acknowledge that he was standing here. The beekeeper dropped something in the field, and bent down to pick it up, moving maddeningly slowly.
John closed his eyes against the way everything seemed to spin, as Gabriel turned a corner—still a bit drunk, then. He tried to will himself into sobriety. In less than an hour, he would be back at the flat, facing Mark, and the truth of whatever had really happened to his double in the alley behind
John thought, if he walked all the way, it would give him time to cool off. He was wrong. Thirty minutes later, he stood at the front door of 221B, still livid. The entire trip, he'd played what he wanted to say to Sherlock over and over, variations on the same theme flying through his mind.
White blinds were drawn down over all the windows, but a yellow glow lit them from within. John took a deep breath, and held it, suddenly as nervous as any man on a date with the love of his life.
He knew that Mark leaving the gun for him to find was part of the new pattern, that had started with Mark leaving the house in the middle of the night last night. He'd grown sloppy. It had to be deliberate. A tease. A breadcrumb trail for John to follow.
The sound of the gun going off was incredibly loud, replacing the hush of the woods—the murmur of the wind through the leaves, the ragged breathing of the three of them in the clearing—with a high ringing that would take some time, maybe minutes, to clear from John's ears.
Well, it was true. Why shouldn't he have been desperate? His heart had been broken. Sherlock had broken him.
By the time John was finished with his patient notes, and on his way to fetch his clothes from the coat room, the clinic was empty. Mark had stopped by one last time to say goodnight, and then he was whisked away by the other nurses in a flurry of excited chatter, the moment they'd finished their shifts at 5:30.
"Right, right." John pointed at the squash bag in Mark's cubby. "Did you get a game in this morning?"
Mark smiled. "That's one way to put it. Just a little group of us, well, used to be a bigger group, decided to go after Sherlock when he came back. Make a game of it. Ruin him for detective work. Seemed obvious enough, to target you. You were the only thing he cared about."
John thought about the churchyard he'd visited, recalled the whitethorn tree, the single sparrow that had watched him grind through the details of what had happened to Mark's previous partner. "Thomas Baccarin," he said. His voice came out low, and strained.
John's heart clenched. It seemed that Mark had a better relationship with everyone in John's life than he did. "Okay."
Then, the impossible. Mark offered Sherlock his hand, and the two of them moved toward the dance floor. Sherlock shot John a look as he moved past the table. John couldn't read it at all. He tried to reach for him, but he couldn't manage it.
He hit the publish button on the blog post, sat back in his chair, and wondered how Sherlock would feel when he read it. Perhaps he already had read it, via the keystroke monitoring software he'd installed. The idea of Sherlock, sitting at 221B and watching every mistake John made as he typed, every edit, made him smile.
"Well. Cheers to the wedding." He drained the rest of his glass, and looked at Sherlock, who was frowning at his plate, his face pale, and felt immediately guilty, as he remembered the text Sherlock had sent:
"Wonderful fellow. Met him this morning, on a bit of a walk on the outskirts of the estate. Violet Smith was against it, of course. I had to escape from her twice. She nearly put me in handcuffs. The moment I deduced what sort of man George was, I knew he would be up for a bit of adventure. I think we're friends now. He gave me two jars of honey."
Mark laughed. "Well. I see you had a good look at the flash drive. I'm surprised you even entertained the idea that it had any real information on it. Desperation's a hell of a thing, isn't it? Anyway, glad I could provide a bit of distraction. Gave the drugs a good chance to kick in."
John stared at William. He was young, and adorable. A wish bubbled to the surface of John's awareness, earnest and sweet, that he and Sherlock had met when the two of them were younger, before time and circumstance ruined them both. "I see."
John put the phone down, and rubbed his eyes. He stared at the ceiling, and laughed, for shame and pity and everything else he was feeling. Sherlock wasn't mad about the blog post. Hadn't said anything about the comments, although John was willing to bet he'd read them all. He realised, as his blood surged and a good, hopeful feeling moved through him, that the feeling he had in this moment was pride, and an answer, finally, to the longing he'd been feeling since Sherlock returned. He wasn't shutting John out any more. He was
John returned to the tablet, and selected the folder for November 13 from the archive. He didn't know what he was expecting to find, but he started with the earliest pictures from that day, flipping through them one at a time, examining each one closely. The simple, repetitive action reminded him of the times he and Sherlock had spent tedious nights going over bank statements, combing through email records, or waiting and watching, in the dark and the cold, for someone to make a move.
The latch in the door clicked, and John let himself inside, to find a staircase leading to the second floor. He climbed it, and let himself in through the door he found at the top, an old wood panelled affair, with an inset frosted glass pane, the words
John chose that moment to open Mark's trousers, and slip his hand inside. He would be much more inclined to talk, if he could barely think. "But I'm still here. So you changed the game, didn't you? Clever."
, it said, along with a street address and a phone number. No email address. Old fashioned, John supposed.
John saw it all laid out now, moves and counter moves behind the scenes, just like at bonfire night: agents working against each other, one plan clashing with the other. He supposed, after a fashion, that Mark had been working to keep him safe, killing the agents who simply wanted John dead. Meanwhile, Mark had been murdering John in an entirely novel fashion, drugging him so he couldn't think, couldn't act, and keeping him away from the one thing he wanted, the one person who could make him happy.
Sherlock stared at him like a wary animal. "I saw you, you know. In the Landmark. Before you knew I was there. You were happy. You'll be happy."
Sherlock raised his glass, and drained it. He was still watching John, his head tilted, his lips parted, eyes as sharp as ever.
His blood stirred at the last memory. The way the two of them had worked as a team, sharing the same purpose. The unbridgeable gap between them. Sherlock's stillness, as he waited, a closed book, with his blade-sharp focus on the task at hand. His beauty, which was blade-sharp, too.
"Well, the army's a strange place. The things you have to do, the way you have to work with people. It depends on forming very deep bonds, of a very specific kind, and leaving other stuff out." Friendship was fine. Camaraderie encouraged. Not more. Not love.
They ate quietly for the next few moments, exchanging talk about the food. Sherlock told John about the restaurant he'd gotten it from.
Mark returned moments later with a pair of jeans and a plaid shirt—clothes John might have chosen for himself.
A few months after his initial arrest, Baccarin had been investigated for the murder of his wife, Olivia, found shot through the head in the home they shared. He'd been cleared of those charges, too: investigators found clear evidence of a break-in. Later, a vagrant was found guilty.
The waiter drew closer still, his elbow brushing John's shoulder. "Well, these are all excellent vintages."
His promise to Sherlock, his offer to talk, after tomorrow, after Mark returned, haunted him, as he pedaled through the empty holiday streets. He would have to wait, have to put it off, somehow. Let Sherlock assume he'd changed his mind, or pretend he hadn't meant it to sound as important as it was.
He knew Mark's entire body, knew it better, in some ways, than he knew his own: the pattern of three small scars, the result of an accident on the farm where Mark grew up, across his ribcage. The tattoo—the Chinese trigram for "thunder," from the
Maybe they'd both been confused. Like John, maybe Sherlock thought he didn't deserve to be loved, to have whatever they could have, between them. The very idea made John long to pull Sherlock into his arms, to offer all the assurances he held in the space of his compact body. A great many. Too many to number.
From his hiding place, he could see Sherlock's face as he stared at Mark, his mouth open, a look of tender revelation coming over him, as he listened to everything Mark said, about John's attachment to Sherlock. His devotion.
John tried to focus on the music, but it sounded too slow to him, distorted through the sound of blood rushing in his ears. It shifted, even as he listened, changing from something current and upbeat, to an old pop song, a drumbeat, a piano.
Sherlock looked so very handsome, in his suit, his curls carefully cultivated, the scent of his cologne—sweet herbs, almonds, musk—wafting from him as he moved.
After about forty-five minutes, they drove over Kew Bridge. The driver turned in toward Kew Gardens, where a security guard stood outside an open service gate, waiting for them, apparently. He waved them through, even though the gardens had long since closed for the day.
He was staring at his phone, wondering if he should reply to Mark's text, when another message arrived from Sherlock.
John watched through the window as the car moved through city traffic, then out into the suburbs, passing row after row of houses.
John wrestled with two powerful urges: one, the hope that Sherlock would say Mark's name. John knew, because he had served often enough as Sherlock's sounding board, that he could prompt Sherlock into a full revelation. All he had to do was ask questions, nudge him a bit.
John felt a surge of nausea run through him. His eyes fluttered shut, as the edges of his vision grew black, and he was sure he was passing out, but the noise and thump of the music came back to him. Not yet, then. He wondered when this part would be over. He was getting tired of the noise, of the party.
He knew not to expect anything, really, not to hope, but he couldn't help himself. Anticipation ran in his blood, and the relief, selfish as it was, of knowing that Sherlock still cared enough to surprise him.
Mark was grinning broadly, looking as happy and boisterous as a groom should. He'd dressed in dark blue trousers, and a gray jacket with a lilac shirt that matched Cath's dress, accented with a plaid bow tie and pocket square, a bright contrast to John's traditional suit.
John had missed this. It hadn't been that long, not in the grand scheme of things, but it felt like an eternity. He and Mark were a couple. Sherlock was something else, the love of his life that he would never have, that he'd finally managed to let go. He would never make peace with the fact that he'd had to, but maybe, eventually, he could let it rest.
"No." Sherlock hadn't said anything about keeping communication open. He hadn't reached out. He hadn't tried. A slow, burning humiliation moved through John. He felt more alive, and more horrible, than he had at any point during the last three weeks. "What has he said?" He suspected the answer would be like drinking seawater—unhelpful, ultimately harmful—but he was dying of thirst, and he needed to know.
He could never be that petty, even though he could already feel himself straining at the confines of time and circumstance.
John laughed, and for the first time since he'd left his heart on the floor of the train carriage, a note of levity crept in. He smiled at William, then sobered. "But seriously, this will just—help me know what's going on, right?"
John walked past a small fountain in the centre of the park. It had been drained, in anticipation of winter, and stood dry and empty.
"No, honey," John said, finally finding what he was looking for, with a small cry of triumph. He wheeled his bike out from behind the collection of rakes and shovels he'd inherited from previous tenants, when he moved into the flat. The helmet was where he'd left it, slung over the handles. His backpack was upstairs, hanging in the back of the bedroom closet.
The lie sat there, between them, like a dare. Mark didn't lose a fraction of his grin as he watched John. If anything, his eyes grew a little brighter.
Sherlock made a face like he was considering what kind of biscuit he should have with his tea. "Sort of a romantic gesture, I suppose."
"It's old, actually, if you'll recall." John smiled at him. "Thought I would ride in today. Get a bit of exercise and air before work." It was another clear, bright day. Cool, but not too cold.
John's heart was pounding like a rabbit's, but he held out his hand. "Come here." His voice was steady. It held a note of command he hadn't used for a long while. Too long.
John smiled at the casual acknowledgement that Sherlock had been following what he'd been writing through the keystroke logging software.
"About being best man?" She wrinkled her nose, and shook her head. "No. He talks about you all the time, though."
John didn't look up at him, just enjoyed the way the man was clearly flirting, invading John's personal space. He was okay with that now. Being with Mark had helped him relax about other men, and about being found attractive.
In the meantime, he could offer a goodnight, a goodbye. "I'll—" He stopped, unsure of what he wanted to say, wary of making any promises.
"No, I haven't." Sherlock looked over at the desk, and John saw a yellow legal pad with notes scrawled on it, and several torn and crumpled pages beside it.
John took the ring box from his jacket, and flipped it over, placed it on the white tablecloth, turned it again, just so. He opened it, checking for the hundredth time that day that the ring was still inside it. It was: a white gold band with a small diamond embedded in it. He'd agonised over the choice, wanting something modern, to go with Mark's style. He hoped Mark would understand that for John, Mark was just like the ring: utterly new.
John smiled at him, and slid his arm around Sherlock's waist, and pulled him close, his own heart ready to burn through his chest, his entire body feeling better, and lighter, than it had in a long while. Sherlock looked down into his eyes, and the two of them held there. John found himself watching Sherlock's lips, watching as Sherlock's breath seemed to catch in his throat.
"Not bad, anyway." John was numb. No matter how long he lived, or what happened next, he would never say or do another authentic thing.
The next three images, taken at five a.m., showed a single, determined-looking marmalade cat, pausing, lingering, and then heading east, as if trailing in Mark's footsteps. At five thirty, a man walked a bull terrier dog past the house.
Sherlock, it seemed, could still completely surprise him. Not by sweeping in and taking him by storm, but through letting him go, giving him over to what he seemed to imagine would make John happy. John smiled fondly, as he rubbed his fingers through his hair, and thought about Sherlock's arms around him, Sherlock's cheek coming to rest on the top of his head, as they'd held each other on Baker Street. As if anything except Sherlock could ever make John happy.
All at once Sherlock was on the move. He picked up his coat, which he'd left slung over the desk chair, and put it on. Without another word, he turned, left the flat, and bolted down the stairs.
He put his hand on Sherlock's shoulder, rubbing his thumb over the bare skin just above his collar. No ambiguity. No games.
John floated, more than walked, as he made his way to the tube station, as he made his way back to the flat, to the home that wasn't home, to the place he hoped, someday soon, he would finally leave behind.
They'd taken his watch. He turned his head, looking for a wall clock, and saw the solitary figure sitting by the bed.
He hated the tone in his voice, the way he tried to sound affectionate, when he was really suppressing his own desperation to get away. He felt as though it was probably obvious that he was always on the verge of yelling.
Violet stepped toward the door. "Okay. Thank you. It's most likely that Mark has given you gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, or an analogue. Because it's a patch, the time for it to peak in your system is going to be a bit longer than if you'd consumed it orally, but it looks to me like you're most of the way there. The party is a good cover for this drug. It hits the system a lot like alcohol. No one's watching how much you're drinking, so they'll assume you've overdone it."
A pair of ancient yews stood at the far end of the yard, against the stone wall that separated the burial ground from the neighbouring houses. The place was isolated, private in the way that forgotten spaces were. At night, it would be completely quiet. One could speak, here, and not be overheard. And yet, the neighbours had reported hearing an argument, men shouting.
Arthur Davies gestured at a collection of clothes artfully laid out on a table by the windows. "And this is your suit. Most unusual, being told how to fit it without meeting you first, but Sherlock assures me that his measurements are completely accurate, and you know, I could hardly dare contradict him." He laughed warmly, and looked into John's eyes, as if expecting that John knew exactly what he meant.
His feet crunched on the gravel path as he picked up his pace, fueled by caffeine, and an uncomfortable sense that the past was catching up with him.
"You can," Mark told him, grinning, evoking a smattering of soft laughter from the people sitting in the pews.
Mark nodded. He stepped in, and brushed his lips up against John's ear. "Go ahead. Play the dutiful brother, one last time. I know you want to."
Mark paused by John's side to give his shoulder a squeeze, sat back down in his chair, and straightened his jacket. "You okay?"
This wasn't a case, John realised. It was something else, although he couldn't guess what. He closed the gap between himself and Sherlock, leaned in. "Everything all right?"
All this time, John had imagined that Sherlock was keeping himself separate from John because he was cold and unfeeling. Instead, he'd thrown himself into planning for the wedding. He'd tried to keep himself in John's life in the best way he could, given the circumstances, by being a supportive friend.
Sherlock shut his eyes, face tense, hands at his temples, and God. He was everything, this man was everything. The clock counted down, and John waited, and watched, seeing how far Sherlock would take it, wondering if he knew already, if he knew what John was going to do to him, moments from now.
"But you know, right?" Three weeks. Too long. Anything could happen in three weeks. They could go anywhere. Disappear. John could be made to disappear.
"Good." Mark grinned. "It's all bit strange, this. Pretending everything isn't going to change in a couple of days."
He steeled himself. He was still frightened, but he wouldn't let it paralyse him any more. Just for tonight, he would pretend to be what Mark wanted. Play along. Not just say that he loved Mark, or that he wanted him. To show Mark that he could be everything Mark imagined him to be. He was ready.
He laughed a little, and imagined the two of them bickering, and he wished, with everything he had, that he was there, instead of where he was.
Four days later, steeped in the aimlessness of the days between Christmas and New Year's, John left Mark asleep in their bed, and took himself out for an early morning bike ride.
His nightmares shifted. He traded his dreams about his old life with Sherlock for vague, disturbing encounters in which Sherlock transformed into a shaky ghost and hovered in the corner of the room, face pale and streaked with tears, watching John sadly. On two occasions he'd woken in a panic, after vivid night terrors, in which he was tied to a chair, while a light shone in his face, and a man whose voice he felt he should recognise interrogated him, asking question after question he couldn't answer. He'd jolted out of those dreams in a blind panic, covered in sweat, reaching for Mark, who held him while he sobbed and shook in their shared bed.
Mark's eyes found John, and he came down the stairs, all soft smiles. He looked dashing—that was the exact word, John was certain of it—all clean lines and compact muscle beneath his suit.
"I always—from the first," Sherlock said, his words halting, his voice hushed and raw. "I just didn't know how—that is to say, what to do."
He shivered. The rain had chilled him through. He didn't know what he'd been thinking, trying to ride through it. Still, he hated the idea of a stranger doing him such an intimate favour. "Thanks, I suppose."
"All right. Whatever you need." Mark let go of John's hand, and slipped his arm around John's shoulder.
With a sense that the world was tilting, John thought of the events of the last few weeks. How Mark had accepted his proposal, and worked with Sherlock, apparently, on the plan to keep John away from him. They'd both been played.
John had never imagined being taken to bed by another man. His fantasies had always involved quick fumblings in the dark: breathless, unthinking, rough. He'd never wondered if things between men could be romantic, but Mark had opened that door for him, undressed him, kissed him, slow and gorgeous and sweet, and taken care of him, had been gentle and tender, and just a little bit filthy. He'd eschewed terms of endearment, as if sensing, without needing to be told, that John couldn't bear being called anything nice, not after all his time alone, not after all the pain. Instead, Mark called him a
Carefully, John put the shoes and clothes back. He replaced the false bottom, making certain the velcro was firmly attached. He slid the racquets into place, and finally, packed the water bottle, court shoes, and gym clothes around them.
A small measure of softness crept into John's belly, a sense that he could allow himself to let go of the breath he'd been holding for the last few days, ever since he'd looked at the security footage.
John kept an eye on the racquet bag, as though it contained a live snake, as he pulled out the clothes he'd brought with him, and hung them up on the coat rack.
To John's surprise, Mark stood, and took the stairs that led up to the loos at a run, shooting John an exaggerated look as he reached the top, mock horror at having to take a phone call at all.
, as the papers were calling it, and that fact was already doing wonders for his reputation among the lads.
He watched the bar, watched Harry. Water. She was drinking water. She was talking to someone, who leaned in, tall, head bowed, nodding. Sherlock. Somehow, he was everywhere.
"Ah yes, of course. You were there. Tell me, were you John's sniper when I was on the roof? Or merely at the pool?"
He would have no difficult decisions to make. He should be grateful for that. There was nothing wrong with having Mark, being with Mark. He washed his face, and patted it dry with a towel, and frowned at his image in the mirror, feeling a slow, creeping shame. He'd humiliated himself, and he'd been so willing to cheat. It wasn't right, no matter how he looked at it. He'd been running on raw impulse and emotion. He could forgive Sherlock, but he wasn't sure he could forgive himself.
John forgot to be still, his entire body wanting, as he thrust himself into Sherlock's hand, and Sherlock's fingers slipped over him, and their mouths found each other again, and John was filled with reverence, and shaken to the core with disbelief, that this was finally happening, that it was all true and real and right, the two of them gasping out their desire at long last, through tender flesh and breath and blood, through the small rituals of lips and teeth and tongues, a consummation and a promise more sacred than any John could ever have made with words.
Still, he'd made so much progress. He'd been so shy at first, so hesitant to let go with Mark, and now, here he was, in the middle of the work day, moments away from having Mark over his desk.
For his part, the man was staring at the ring box in John's hand, and blinking hard, then shifting his gaze to take in Mark, brow furrowed, his expression so like Sherlock's, when he was frustrated by something, when he was trying to solve one of his intricate puzzles.
She wasn't his mother, John realised. She was much better than his mother had ever been. As he rode home on the tube, his heart was full. He wasn't sure he deserved her, but he was very, very glad she was in his life.
"Me," Sherlock said. "Selfish." He blinked, as if running a complex mental calculation. "We could," he said. "We could work this case together, just this once. Yes. I think that would do very nicely."
Now that he'd taken care of the post, he stood, and fetched his coat and shoes, and found a pair of winter gloves. He'd meant what he said, about being careful, about keeping an eye out. He knew just what he would do.
The French waiter was suddenly at the table, holding out the bottle of champagne, cutting John off with an excessively loud pronouncement. "Sir, I think you’ll find this vintage—" The sentence ended with a gasp.
John's reaction, taking only a fraction of a second, was born of burnt nerve endings, of the taut-wire hardness of a spirit that had always been at war. He was down. By any reasonable account, he should be done. But he still had fight in him.
Mark ran his hands down John's sides, held him by the hips, and tugged him closer. "But you're awake now, aren't you?"
Mark smiled at him, and looked at John tenderly. "Oh. I'm glad to hear it." His voice was low, and quiet, with a rough edge to it, like he was holding back some emotion that threatened to overwhelm him.
The only thing he could do was turn it so that the hands moved backwards. Turning back time, or at least, the illusion of turning it back.
"We're not." John searched for the right thing to say. "It's just—who would have believed this? This doesn't happen, Sherlock. It's too good to be true."
It was time, John decided, to shift the terms of the conversation. To show Sherlock what could happen, when they were alone together. "Stand up."
Sherlock clicked through the first few. They showed a domed white marble building, surrounded by minarets.
