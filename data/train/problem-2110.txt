John blinked, not expecting that, but answered anyway. “Yeah, I didn’t have anything planned.”
Sherlock reached out expectantly and John huffed fondly as he helped the man to his feet. Sherlock was a little unsteady so John kept an arm around him all the way to the front desk.
John subtly picked up a pen from the holder on the desk and made an alteration of his own.
when it came to John, no matter what
Mrs Hudson herself came in and out with more tea for the next few hours, eventually sitting down on the couch and demanding the whole story of how Sherlock had faked his death.
“Yeah, well, I came over to see if you think it’s got anything to do with the shooting of that cab driver. They were both killed within a few blocks of each other by an unknown shooter with pinpoint accuracy and-” Lestrade cut himself off when he got a good look at Sherlock. The man had sat down in his armchair and was currently hiding his face in his hands. His shoulders were shaking, and absently Lestrade noted that this was possibly the most emotion he’d seen the man display outside of a murder scene. He wasn’t actually sure what emotion it was, but still.
, inside and out, every little thing, good and bad.
again.”
“Do you know which factory it is?” she asked, having finally made sense of Sherlock’s earlier little speech.
John groaned slightly, his hand coming up to clumsily grip Sherlock’s wrist. “Sh’lock?”
Watson. Take care to remember that, in future.”
To Lestrade’s shock, Sherlock immediately replied. “Many, although only one of particular interest. The shop had two copies of the book ‘Anne of Green Gables’, but only one copy was in the Classics section where it belonged. The second copy was very worn and was in the Young Adult fiction section. The binding was peeling, just enough for another cover to be visible underneath. The second book obviously wasn’t actually ‘Anne of Green Gables’ – it was a conspiracy theory book, put there as a practical joke by a group of teens. The book was picked up a young politician, born in Yorkshire and just staring his career, who was extremely angered by the stereotypes and blatant mistruths the book contained. He burned down the entire shop later that night in retaliation, not knowing that there were people inside. The murder was completely unintentional, but the arson was pre-planned and he enjoyed it very thoroughly. All you have to do is look for a man in his early twenties who is just starting out in his political career, and stayed in a hotel in Soho in the last few days. He had an affair with one of the janitors there too, if that’ll help narrow it down.”
John cleared his throat and half-smiled at Sherlock. “You will have to give that shirt back though,” he said, making Sherlock smirk and Molly giggle. Both men seemed to startle at the reminder that she was there.
, I mean enemies of myself and John. It wasn’t just me who solved the crimes or stopped the criminals, no, John was instrumental and invaluable in every case we worked together. Any enemies we made, we made together.”
And Sherlock was there, alive and breathing, half curled up in his armchair with his face buried in the Union Jack pillow. He looked up when John entered, his lips forming the man’s name even though John couldn’t hear it over the ringing in his ears. He stumbled over to stand in front of Sherlock, taking him in and hoping that he wasn’t just dreaming and
It would have been surprising at how quickly they returned to normalcy, if they were anyone else. But for them, this was oddly like the aftermath of a dangerous case or an injury – some nightmares, some anxiety, but they were always there for one another. So they bickered and bantered, back and forth about topics that didn’t really matter while John got ready for his date.
Mary stared at him, knowing she hadn’t been
.’ And then, ‘
“Sleep then.” A fond tone to Sherlock’s voice as a hand rested comfortingly on his forehead.
“Glad to be awake,” John whispered back. “Any idea why we’re whispering?”
“Maybe,” Sherlock said, snapping his magnifier closed. “I’ve got everything I need. I’ll hail a cab and meet you back at the Yard-”
But even Mycroft himself hadn’t foreseen
“Oh, Christ, what has he done now?” John sighed, already pulling out his wallet to place down money for the meal. He sent Emily an apologetic look and mouthed ‘
“Yes!” said Sherlock and began babbling at speeds too fast for anyone but John to follow. “There was red dust in the footprints, unnatural red dust, and it was the only thing all of the crime scenes had in common – everything else, all of the other clues, were randomised. The only place unnatural red dust can be found underfoot is in the dye factories – the dyes dry into the area around the factories and change the colour of the soil. There was an incident just weeks ago down in a factor by the river where one of the dye vats exploded – a
Mary made Sherlock remove his hands so she could do the stitches and John managed not to react to the anchoring touch disappearing beyond the slight twitch to his fingers. But every time the needle punctured skin it felt like a hot poker being jabbed into his head. The longer it went on, the more he wanted Sherlock’s cool touch back.
“Yeah, hang on,” Lestrade cut in, waving a hand to get Sherlock to stop. “You’re saying that
The third time John got the call, he let it ring through to voicemail because he thought it was a nurse whom he’d just broken up with. The voice message told him otherwise, though.
Screw it all.
, after nearly two years of silent and not-so-silent wishes for his miraculous return.
“A few rather deep cuts, sir, as a result of an experiment in one of our labs. A fellow scientist is there with him now but he refuses to see anyone other than you.”
“Come in, everyone. Sit down, have some tea and we’ll explain.”
“Are you John Watson?” she asked, a slight bitter tone creeping into her voice.
“Your leg better then?”
John kind of couldn’t blame Cross Keys for trying to give them only one bed. This was far preferable to waking up at two in the morning with nightmares and being unable to fall back asleep. At least this way John
Sentiment. It was odd, but it was growing on him. He blamed John for that.
he loved Sherlock more, always.
“I didn’t
“Yep,” John said on a sigh. “What has Sherlock done now?”
“I’d have to disagree,” Mary said from behind Sherlock, and he very nearly jumped. He’d been too preoccupied with John to care about the witnesses crowding behind them, panicking at the fact that they’d nearly set a man on fire.
There was a brief hesitation, then the rustle of fabric. John murmured something as he struggled to stay awake. “Sherlock.”
John walked back in with the cup of tea Mrs Hudson had left out for him and settled comfortably into his armchair.
Okay, maybe she shouldn’t have been provoking him when he was just trying to solve this case like the rest of them. But she couldn’t help it.
John remembered the next waking, where the world felt oddly faded and his vision was disjointed, and it was disappointing, since he’d thought he was getting better. Sherlock was there, sitting next to him, cold hands hovering and ready to help, as they watched the rain hit the window. Mary was there but not there, in the flat but staying in the next room, watching television, because she didn’t think to check if John was awake and had just assumed he would sleep off the drugs.
John smirked and added yet another label to the list.
John blinked at Sherlock before setting his tea down. “No, it doesn’t. Haven’t you had a cold before?”
“It’s not like I’m a child in need of distracting,” he huffed, flipping through the papers but barely registering the printed words. It was still too early for this, but he was getting bored so he’d deal with it.
John didn’t make it to the front desk that time either. The man behind it – presumably Theo – took one look at him and called, “Room 83!” across the lobby. John nodded in thanks and turned towards the stairwell.
And that moment, falling asleep with the man
“What?!” John repeated with a slight sense of urgency as he dug his phone out of his pocket to see eight missed calls, all from Sarah. “Oh, God,” he groaned, debating on calling her back and then deciding against it. He’d see her at work tomorrow anyway, and this would give her time to cool down a bit.
“We’re not dating,” he managed to say, looking up just in time to see Theo flush red with embarrassment and Sherlock smirk at the scene.
Sherlock huffed under his breath as he buttoned his shirt, mumbling something about idiocy being a label used by idiots. Although by that logic Sherlock
John couldn’t help but echo the smile. “It’s good to be home.”
John sighed, nodding to the door. “He in there?”
“Goodnight, Sherlock.”
“Um, Sherlock?” Sherlock sighed again but nodded for her to continue. “Didn’t you say your landlord hated it when you left experiments at home?”
turn of events, not even when taunting ‘
Closer.
– just stared back at them with confused and worried expressions before John’s eyes widened in realisation and he cursed.
Sally was busy trying to decipher Sherlock’s super fast ramblings, but not too busy to hear John’s dazed laugh. “Sherlock, that’s brilliant, you madman!”
, or the way he’d taken his glove off and was absentmindedly tracing patterns against John’s palm. From what John had said about him, they’d been extremely close, and although they’d both denied it in the past the public seemed pretty sure that they had been romantically involved. Mary didn’t know or care before, only knowing that Sherlock was a topic of taboo with John, but now that the great detective was back she couldn’t deny there was a definite connection between them. Even when arguing and fighting in the middle of various restaurants there’d been a steady thrum of
John shrugged. “Sarah and some of the others went through a lot of effort to arrange a blind date with her and it felt mean to disregard their work. Plus, she wasn’t so bad on the first date.”
and begging at his gravestone for him to come back. And in the time Sherlock had been gone, John seemed to have moved on.
“Alright, but…” Molly stuttered out after a few minutes of silence. “Who’s John Watson?”
Until then, Mycroft just sat back, sipped his tea, and watched.
She realised in that moment that Sherlock would never look at her the same way he looked at John Watson. And oddly, the realisation didn’t sting as much as she expected it to. John and Sherlock were made for one another. Molly didn’t want to break that.
For the rest of that night, John slept better than he had in his entire life. And the night after, when he couldn’t stand being alone and tiptoed into Sherlock’s room, he was welcomed with open arms – literally – and slept just as well.
“It’s in a black box, wherever John keeps his clothes!” Sherlock called back without pause.
heartless machine.
stop now?”
– before deciding against it. It was probably just a slip of the tongue. Best not to mention it. Ever, ever again.
“Last night,” Sherlock said quietly and Molly nearly choked on her own saliva until he continued. “In the waiting room at the hospital. You were nearly asleep but I thought you heard.”
’. He answered with a sigh, stepping away from Mike with an apologetic look. John might just have to give up on the remainder his social life, since he’d already been pulled away from gatherings with friends twice that week for cases, and it was only Wednesday.
“They won’t listen,” Sherlock muttered stroppily, flopping down into his armchair. “Any interesting cases?”
“I’ll be right there,” he promised before hanging up.
What John had realised, in those three days of drugged stupor, was that Sherlock would always be there, and Mary wouldn’t. John had always known that Sherlock was there for him, of course, but for some reason he thought their relationship would change once Sherlock was back. It didn’t.
At least Sherlock had stopped stealing the sheets.
Another irritated sign. “They’re not dangerous, Molly. Potentially hazardous, yes, but not dangerous.”
John smirked slightly as he shut the door behind him. He had to violently suppress the urge to take out his phone and start filming – he knew Sherlock would get a hold of it later and delete it, so the memory would have to do.
“Hmm? Oh, I don’t, the shirt’s John’s,” he mumbled distractedly while tilting the Petri dish slightly to the side as if that would make a difference to its contents.
“Why do you talk back to him on your quiet days?” Mycroft asked Sherlock, ignoring John for the moment.
Sherlock was silent, and he still didn’t move.
As they all squished into a patrol car and went off to catch the kidnapper and save the little girl, one tiny detail kept resurfacing in Sally’s mind.
?’ considered Molly. ‘
Mrs Hudson would’ve been surprised if she’d had the chance to. But as it were, both John and Sherlock showing up on the doorstep of 221 clinging to one another with tear tracks on their faces was enough to snap her out of her surprise and into worried-mother-mode. She ushered them both inside, started a fire, made tea and steadfastly didn’t mention the way John and Sherlock both didn’t separate the entire time, sitting so close together on the couch that they were pressed together from shoulder to knee.
“John!” Sherlock declared happily from where he was sitting on a hospital gurney. “You’re here! They said they’d call you, but I didn’t believe them – shifty lot, doctors – no offence, of course, you’re one of the good doctors – so anyway I made you my emergency contact just in case they didn’t call you, but obviously they did.” Sherlock was babbling at a faster rate than usual, his eyes unfocused and a manic grin on his face. Whatever he’d inhaled had dosed him up good. They could only hope it wasn’t hazardous.
John Watson. Molly was actually looking forwards to meeting him, if he really had managed to thaw Sherlock’s icy exterior enough for the man to call him a sweetheart.
Sherlock hummed, taking another sip of his tea. His brow furrowed, and he almost looked like he was analysing the taste.
Sarah snorted, taking back the clipboard as John walked back over to Sherlock.
John turned back to the team of gobsmacked researchers. “Sorry, what was it you wanted to ask him about?”
“Course,” he replied, readying himself for another while of having to look after an injured Sherlock. He didn’t mind the looking after as much anymore. John did wish Sherlock wouldn’t get injured so often, though. He had to take care of the madman enough normally, and adding an injury to the mix just made it unnecessarily difficult.
Sherlock and John walked them all home after tea, upon the unanimous agreement that fresh air would do everyone good. As they walked, Molly began to ask Sherlock questions about how he’d gotten the other body out of Barts morgue – since he hadn’t asked her for help – and Lestrade joined in after realising the further potential for trouble Sherlock had if he really did know how to break and enter and then exit with a dead body.
“It is of international importance,” Mycroft told him, pulling himself up to full height. “And you, Sherlock Holmes, will
The explanation
The front desk did sent him off in Sherlock’s direction when he got there, but they sent him to an actual room instead of a waiting area and they did so with apologetic looks, so John was understandably worried about what he was going to find as he paced down the halls to reach Sherlock.
John jerked upright, arms flailing, barely registering the hands gripping his shoulders.
Lestrade scaled the stairs, nodding to the landlady in thanks for letting him in. Upstairs, the violin could be heard playing before it abruptly stopped when Lestrade reached the top of the stairs. He gave himself one breath of fortification, since dealing with Sherlock was never easy even on a good day, and then knocked on the door.
,” John whispered, taking another breath of him, knowing he was there and he was staying but needing to say it anyway. Just in case he didn’t know, somehow.
’, thankful when she just nodded understandingly and smiled at him as he left.
quota for you,” he explained, beginning to look through printouts of cases from the website. “They don’t want you taking any more of their corpses because they never get them back.”
“There was a bit of an incident, on a case,” John said, for once not making any more sense than Sherlock. “At a swimming pool.”
. The easy tone, the familiar cadence, the slight catch and break of his voice that happened when he was lying – which he obviously was. It was near midnight, he was visiting the grave of his dead-for-two-years flatmate and this woman seemed surprised he was here, meaning he hid these late-night visits from others.
And John and Sherlock –
“Of course,” Theo told him, then, “I like the blog, by the way.”
“Oh please, I hardly
“It’s about the flatmate that you seem to have gotten quite attached to. I wouldn’t call it trivial,” Mycroft replied coolly. Sherlock glared at him.
“Wasn’t a blow,” Sherlock mumbled, fingers hovering over various parts of John’s head. “Or, well, it was a blow that caused the cut, but it wasn’t the blow that caused the disorientation. He’s been drugged, don’t know how or what with. Judging by the fact that the kidnapper led us to him it won’t have been anything fatal or overly harmful. Just something that would keep him unconscious and disoriented for however long was needed, or possibly for longer since it seemed our kidnapper had every intention of leaving him there to die. It wouldn’t quite have mattered if the drug kept him confused for twenty hours instead of two, since they were planning on him being dead before long.”
“Right,” he finally said, mostly to himself as he nodded firmly and got up to go to the kitchen.
– as he sat back in his seat, flicking his violin bow. “Thank you, Lestrade, hopefully the visit has cleared up a lot. You’ll have to skip the tea, I’m afraid, you’ve just gotten a text telling you about another case. I’d say it’s a level 3 at best, but it should occupy you for a few hours at the least.”
The first time John Watson was called as Sherlock Holmes’s emergency contact was the first time he knew he had the job. He was in the middle of dinner with his latest girlfriend, Emily, when it happened, and he apologised profusely while accepting the call from the unknown number.
Sherlock’s face took on a slightly sheepish expression. “I was measuring the clotting of blood in different parts of the body after death. My tool tray sort of… slipped.”
Sherlock scowled at him but surprisingly responded. “I can’t help it. At the start, I just couldn’t not talk to him. At this point I’ve given up on trying not to.”
The man in question laughed, turning to look him dead in the eye. “John, we fight criminals and get shot at on an almost day-to-day basis. I wouldn’t call that lucky.”
“Nope,” Sherlock replied, popping the P. “Barts said I’d filled up my quota for the month. They don’t seem to realise that I haven’t assigned myself any quotas, the imbeciles.”
Mycroft Holmes prided himself on his composure. However, he still nearly spat out his tea when John murmured, “Thanks, love,” in response to Sherlock passing him a cup of tea.
A very familiar mop of dark curls. A very, very familiar mop of dark curls that almost looked like they belonged to someone who’d been dead for the last twenty-one months.
Sherlock’s slender fingers began to slip from between his own and John tightened his grip, a sudden jolt of panic shooting through him.
“…think you’d like her. Mary’s fairly understanding about everything that’s happened with… well, with you.” John let out a short, harsh laugh and his left hand started to twitch. “What am I talking about, of course you wouldn’t like her. If she was just a friend, then sure, but you never did like any of my girlfriends.” A wince at the memories. “I can’t really blame you. None of them seemed to like you either.” A deep breath, not realising that Sherlock had stalled and was now standing not two meters away. “I might be leaving 221B. I mean, Mary asked if I’d move in with her, and I said I’d consider it but… I don’t know. I’ve tried, before, but it was too hard. I don’t think I could leave it behind.” A harsh sigh, a hanging of the head, not seeing Sherlock standing shell-shocked behind him. “I can’t let go, Sh –
“Isn’t he that detective from the blog?” one of Anna’s colleagues asked. “Surely he’ll speak to Doctor Watson, if we call him.”
John stayed still, watching as Sherlock turned to face him.
“Good,” Sherlock soothed, thumb tracing along John’s cheek. “You’re safe now.”
“Oi,” John said sternly. “I had to cancel on Mike for the third time this week to come here and get you. Don’t be a git.”
Over at the car, completely unaware of Sherlock’s crisis not ten meters away, John smiled and kissed the blonde woman’s cheek.
“Making you tea,” John answered, grabbing out the jar of honey they had in their cupboard for some reason. It would help soothe Sherlock’s throat, at least, even if it was useless most of the rest of the time.
What he’d been imagining was Sherlock on death’s door due to some unknown, extremely dangerous chemical fumes. When he found instead was somehow so much worse and so much better.
“Ah, yeah, he’s fine, he’ll be fine.” John cleared his throat to try and cover it up, but Lestrade heard the amusement in his tone plain as day. He was quickly coming to realise how alike these two were, and how much trouble it would spell for him in the future if he was going to have both of them coming to his crime scenes from now on.
Once he completed his analysis, Sherlock smiled genuinely. “Welcome back, John.”
“You’ve mention.” Sherlock laughed at his surprised look. “Come on, John, after three days drugged up and alone with me you think you didn’t mention it at least once?”
John was bloody exhausted. This had honestly been one of their most messed-up and difficult cases yet, and he was dying to just head up the stairs in Cross Keys and collapse onto his bed in his and Sherlock’s shared room.
“He’s refusing to speak to anyone,” Anna immediately replied.
this ‘pet naming’ certainly hinted towards it happening in the future.
“Yeah, well.” He mentally shook himself back into the present. “Sorry about that. You’re lab partners though, so I’d bet you know how stubborn he can be.”
stupid that they didn’t notice what was going on right in front of them. But no, nearly everyone seemed surprised every single time they heard Sherlock and John use terms of endearment with one another, even though it had been happening nearly since the very beginning.
Quite honestly, John felt exactly the same. He turned his head slightly to press his nose into achingly familiar wild curls, inhaling the expensive and expressive scent that was somehow quintessentially
John had disappeared just four days ago after being dropped off by a cab at the cemetery near midnight. Aside from a steady stream of absence emails to the surgery, there had been no word from him since then. Mary had gone to Molly, Molly had gone to Lestrade and they’d all gotten in a cab and headed over to 221B, only to find that John had never left. Apparently he and a mysterious other person had been right here the entire time.
The Detective Inspector scoffed, stepping out of the room and shutting the door, looking towards to where Sally and Anderson were standing. “Nothing. He hasn’t said a single word. I’d bet he wouldn’t even talk to John, if he was here.”
John put a hand over Sherlock’s own on his knee, squeezing gently in reassurance. Sherlock took a shaky breath before continuing his tale.
“None yet,” John murmured, sifting through the papers.
.” A sympathetic wince. “You’ve got a cold, haven’t you.”
,” John told him, splitting the printouts into two sections and handing one to Sherlock. “There you go. Hopefully that will keep you quiet for a while.”
Sherlock sighed in the put-upon way that was his usual manner and said, “Question, Molly?”
Sherlock hissed in a breath and tugged John closer, letting him breath Sherlock in, confirm he was still here.
“Ridiculous!” Sherlock grumbled. “My genius doesn’t need restrictions, darling.”
There was a pause. A few moments passed before Sherlock spoke up. “I will admit,” he said haltingly, “I didn’t actually expect you to do this.”
John remembered waking up late at night, dizzy but better, better enough to acknowledge his hunger and thirst over the pounding in his head. Sherlock was there, easing him back against the headboard of the bed and bringing him water –
“Tyrant,” Sherlock mumbled, huffing and struggling to contain a smile as he straightened his suit jacket for no apparent reason.
“You can open your eyes now, John,” came the low murmur of Sherlock’s voice. “We’ve turned off the lights.”
“When did you find the time to look through television shows?”
John couldn’t stop himself repeating words over and over, barely even registering what those words were, only hoping that they’d express the danger. The fear.
“I’m sorry,” she told Anna from the upstairs Research department. “I did warn you that he doesn’t listen to anyone.”
John walked in with an armful of coffee cups, just catching the end of the conversation. “So is ‘tyrant’, apparently,” he commented as he passed two of the takeaway cups to Anders and Sally.
Lestrade finally spoke. “Alright then.” He cleared his throat, trying to get it working again. “Okay. We’ll get on that.”
After a few moments of awkward silence, Anna cleared her throat. “There was a skeleton we were looking for. Of a woman named…” She trailed off, looking to Molly for help.
“What?” Cerise asked, evidently confused as John began to ignore her in favour of checking Sherlock over. “What do you mean, ‘Doctor’?”
Molly had to clear her throat several times to get her voice working. “Martha Dunn. The skeleton of Martha Dunn.”
John managed not to panic as the cab dropped him in front of Barts and he strode through the doors. This was Sherlock. He’d been in far worse scrapes than this, and John would know – he had been present for most of them.
John shrugged. “Don’t ask me. And don’t ask Sherlock either, since he’s going to be quiet and mopey for the rest of the day.”
“You stayed with me,” Sherlock stated simply, before flopping dramatically back down onto the couch with his head in John’s lap again as it had been for most of the morning.
“Yes, he can be, can’t he?” Molly smiled, the bitterness vanishing as she seemed to come to a decision about him.
Molly was hovering near Sherlock as he peered through his microscope at different samples of blood and bone dust. It was ridiculous, that she couldn’t work up the nerve to ask this one simple question, but then again… well, it was Sherlock. She never had any clue as to how he would react to these types of things.
to be careful,” Sherlock protested. “I just wasn’t careful
“John’s,” Sherlock replied easily.
With a woman.
Sherlock didn’t answer. Sherlock hadn’t been answering for the last hour and a half. Lestrade wasn’t even sure if he was listening.
John didn’t want Mary, the woman he thought he could marry, to be a rebound. But the truth was, Mary
Hands settled on his shoulders and the touch had John taking a shaky, gasping breath because it proved Sherlock was
, the doctor in him said. John didn’t argue with it.
But when he walked into 221B one morning to find Sherlock perched in his armchair reading one of John’s medical diaries with John’s black jacket draped across his shoulders, it did admittedly startle him a little.
“There’s definitely such a thing,” Sherlock countered, preparing to go into a lecture on the harmful effects of rosin dust.
Word Count: 2022
, didn’t mean that the anxiety – of him being gone, away from John and unable to protect him, or for John his blood being splattered on the sidewalk at Barts – that feeling didn’t just instantaneously and miraculously disappear. Sherlock’s return had been their miracle, and they weren’t going to be granted two in such a short span of time.
Sherlock took in a shaky breath, whet his lips, and spoke.
Lora on the other end of the line hesitated at John’s bluntness. “He’s been involved in a bit of an incident that resulted in him inhaling chemical fumes. He’s unconscious currently, but he’s okay. We just need someone here to take him home when he wakes up. It says on file that you’re his flatmate.”
that Sally really didn’t know why they weren’t together yet.
“Well, if you’re flat-sharing then wouldn’t he mind if the kitchen table was covered in dangerous experiments?”
John rested his palm against Sherlock’s forehead in a practiced movement, his fingers absentmindedly brushing back curls as he checked Sherlock’s temperature. The man himself let out a quiet whine and turned into the touch, startling apparently both himself and John.
it, John. It was psychosomatic after all, there was nothing there to heal in the first place,” Sherlock called from in the living room, and John shook his head as he gestured Lestrade inside, shutting the door behind him.
“Yes, what about him?” Sherlock mumbled, clearly not paying full attention to her. That was fine. Sherlock didn’t pay full attention to anyone.
The detective and his blogger finally found a routine that fit them, and they never stopped using it for the rest of their lives.
Sherlock pointed at him with an all-to-pleased expression. “You had a lunch date, but you missed it and apparently forgot all about it. That was the detail that was bugging me earlier!”
Both men’s reaction to that was a beat of silence. Then John said slowly, “Bit too far, Mary,” and it set the woman off.
“Good day, Lestrade,” Sherlock said absently as he inspected his violin bow. “John, what do you know about deaths caused by rosin dust?”
“Sherlock,” John sighed, beyond tired and just wanting for things to be easy for once.
Sherlock just sniffed quietly in response and made to turn his face back into the cushions, but John stopped him with a gentle hand to the forehead. “Hang on, let me check something.”
As soon as John was close enough Sherlock leaned back in, pressing their foreheads together and shutting his eyes. Under normal circumstance he would never have done that, but evidently he was in too much pain to care. John allowed it, even tucked a few of Sherlock’s curls away from his forehead. If Sherlock was seeking this much physical contact and completely dropping his usual detached manner, then John wasn’t going to push him away. Never mind if a part of him enjoyed brushing back those dark, familiar curls.
Sherlock frowned, apparently having forgotten that Molly had been there for that. John just nodded slowly. “Yeah, something to do with that. You’ll have to ask Sherlock about it, he knows more than I do. He’s the one who went to the pool, on his own.”
Prompt: Nightmares. Set just after Dartmoor, literally their last night there in the shared hotel room. John has a nightmare, since we know he’s more prone to these things and Sherlock climbs into bed with him to keep him grounded and they just end up falling asleep like that.
So walking into the living room to find the madman silently lying on the couch, shivering in a bespoke shirt, dressing gown and track pants, was understandably concerning.
Theo grinned gratefully at him as they approached. “Heading home, Dr Watson, Mr Holmes?”
“Sherlock!” Molly finally lost her temper and snapped at him. “Will you stop being so unsociable and talk?!”
The anxiety would rear it’s head when Sherlock was near John but not touching him and John couldn’t feel him there anymore, he could be gone, he could be back on that pavement covered in blood or falling, falling, falling endlessly from the rooftop.
“Ah, John! You made it.”
The sudden silence could be because of the fiasco at the swimming pool a week ago – but no, if it was then wouldn’t Sherlock have reacted like this sooner?
Sherlock did a double-take, looking at her like she was completely thick before seeming to remember that she was the sort-of-fiancée to his best friend. “When I say
John nodded silently and Sherlock smiled gratefully in return before turning to leave and gesturing for John to follow.
John laughed from over by the car and the reality hit Sherlock like a lightning bolt. He had been gone for nearly two years. John had believed him dead for
Sherlock scoffed from over John’s shoulder, reading what he’d written.
“You pouted for the rest of the day,” John pointed out.
He had really missed this ridiculous git, with his brilliant deductions, usually arrogant manner and blatant showing off. But John had also missed the slow mornings, the press of a hand on his back when Sherlock leaned over his shoulder to read the latest blog entry, the late nights where he had to wrangle the man into bed. John had missed
A few moments of silence passed before Sherlock spoke up again. “Mind if I stay here now?”
“May I ask whose jacket that is?” he asked, forgoing for now the case of international importance that he needed Sherlock to solve.
John recounted the story of how he’d met Mary at the surgery and how they’d started dating, before immediately moving on to the number of reporters he’d had to beat up over the last few years for bothering him and Mrs Hudson with questions about Sherlock’s life, work and death.
Mary didn’t quite like the way he’d said
So he went with Sherlock to 221B so they could both clean up. John was surprised by how much of his stuff was still there - he’d just up and left, one day, when it became too hard, leaving all his possessions behind. Everything was still there aside from Sherlock’s most hazardous old experiments and whatever food there used to be in the cupboards. John even found his aftershave still on the bathroom counter.
Sherlock took only one sip before frowning. “John, does the common cold typically affect your tastebuds?”
John gave them all one last friendly smile before heading off after Sherlock, leaving an entire Research team and one shell-shocked Molly Hooper gaping in his wake.
“Piling yourself in blankets isn’t going to help, you’ll only overheat your system,” John told him, hoping that the factuality of the statement would make Sherlock cooperate for once. It did seem to work as the sniffling genius huffed and kicked off the last of the blankets. John retrieved the tea from the coffee table and passed it over to Sherlock before sitting next to the man in silence and sipping at his own cup.
“The hound,” John managed, his terror coming back at the memory of red eyes… “I was hurt, couldn’t move, it was there, Sherlock, you were right, it was there.”
“Best watch out, John. The thefts always start small…” she let the sentence trail off, smiling at both of them as they chuckled at her joke.
Word count: 1651
John couldn’t help but chuckle at his flatmate’s sudden unusually tired manner. “Yep, it’s me. It’s time to go home now, okay?”
, at that point.
He was John’s irritating git, though, and so he sighed fondly and turned over to face Sherlock. John knew exactly how to get Sherlock to stop tugging at the sheets, he’d just been trying to avoid it and avoid getting further attached to the ridiculous madman currently hogging the sheets.
“Uh, hi,” he said awkwardly. “Sherlock in?”
“Deaths caused by rosin dust?” John repeated incredulously. “There’s no such thing.”
, matted with blood; a blog counter stuck on a number that wasn’t a clue; a pale, cold wrist with no pulse. Sherlock was there, cool fingers brushing back John’s sweaty hair and murmuring soothingly, quietly, to calm him down. Mary was not there, having taken over John’s evening shift at the surgery.
Lestrade sighed, digging his phone out of his pocket, and of course Sherlock was right. A break-in all the way out in bloody Manchester that was apparently linked to a theft that had occurred in London just a few days ago.
“Don’ leave,” the man slurred, already halfway into unconsciousness. “Please.”
John perked up at that, walking over to perch himself on the arm of Sherlock’s armchair. “Is it an interesting one?”
Without missing a beat, Sherlock yelled back, “You’re one to talk about irritating!”
“No. Never again, John.
“Idiot is a term of endearment, if you must know,” Sherlock muttered, clearly distracted as he shifted different photographs and newspaper clippings around on the tabletop.
Sherlock snorted under his breath. “If by ‘not always’ you mean every single time, then yes, you’re spot on.”
, but since when had they been close enough to start swapping phones?
“Jesus, how did we forget?” John muttered, grinding the heels of his palms against his eyes in an effort to block out his rapidly forming headache.
It dissolved into a bit of a blur after that, but there were two moments that both men would remember for years after. The first one was the moment that John’s knuckles connected with Sherlock’s jaw, and the second one was the moment immediately after when he crashed into Sherlock and clung to him, one hand fisted in the lapel of the ever-present coat and the other tight around his waist. Sherlock clung back just as tightly, pressing them together until there was no space left keeping them apart.
Lestrade just sighed and left them to it. If John had stuck around as Sherlock’s flatmate for this long then he was sure he’d be able to manage the man alone by now. Although, their earlier bantering had been a little odd. They’d insulted one another
On a side note, he was really dizzy.
“Alright, so how did you get these?” he asked as he started on the cut across Sherlock’s collarbone.
“I am merely here with a case,” the government replied smoothly, tapping his umbrella against the floor.
“My tea is sweeter than usual,” Sherlock mumbled. “The sugar tastes unusual. I had assumed it related to my current, ah, predicament,”
Sherlock shrugged.
“Hmm? Oh, yes, you haven’t met him yet have you?” Sherlock phrased the question more like a statement as he muttered a few notes to himself while adjusting the microscope focus. When he was done he cleared his throat and continued, “Well, John’s my flatmate. Has been for about eight weeks now, I’m surprised you’ve never heard of him before.”
Red eyes, muscles coiled in a predatory stance. It prowled closer, snarling.
“What? When?” asked John, looking over at Sherlock even though the great detective was steadfastly not meeting his eyes.
And even odder, both of them seemed to know, and neither of them seemed to care. Doctor John Watson truly was becoming the making of Mycroft’s brother, and no one could state otherwise, especially not Sherlock, quiet day or otherwise.
“Hey,” John greeted as he walked in. “What’s happened?”
Sherlock immediately burrowed into the touch, even in sleep, wrapping himself around John like the human limpet he truly was. John merely smiled slightly and allowed the detective to tuck himself against John’s body.
’. They weren’t going to get a happy announcement, not yet, but while Sherlock and John may not be romantically involved
John seemed guilty as his gaze returned to Sherlock. “I’m still sorry about the bookshop case.”
John rolled his eyes. “You’re
Both John and Sherlock jumped as Cerise practically slammed the clipboard down next to John.
Note: apologies it took me so long to get this done, but I’m posting two chapters tonight to make up for it :) Thank you all who kudos and comment, the appreciation keeps me going!
– but not food in case his stomach couldn’t handle it yet. Mary was not there, having slept over at her friends house.
“Alright, but then what about John?” Molly pressed, once it was evident that Sherlock wasn’t going to continue talking.
John was already outside hailing a cab. “Alright, let him know I’ll be there soon please.”
“What?” Sherlock asked, resting his chin on top of John’s head in what Molly believed was far too relaxed a manner than the current situation called for.
“I was cold, the heater is broken and my coat is at the dry-cleaners, so he let me borrow it.”
The question caused Molly to break into mildly hysterical laughter because
Sherlock nodded coolly at Lestrade, as if only just noticing he was there. “Ah, Detective Inspector. I presume this is about the recent murder of General Shan?”
Very odd. Then again, what wasn’t with Sherlock Holmes? And apparently with John Watson too.
“Forget what?” Sherlock inquired, gently taking hold of John’s wrists to stop the movement, a note of concern drifting into his voice as Molly gulped in breaths, trying to make sense of any of this.
John set the kettle to boil and grabbed his phone while waiting. Two missed texts, both from Lestrade asking if they were holding up okay.
Watson,” Sherlock stressed, leaning into John’s hand as he rested it against Sherlock’s forehead. “His name is
bad enough to warrant stitches, but John wasn’t really
“Sherlock, we
“Yeah,” he told Mary. “I guess we are.”
“It’s not here!” she called from the bathroom.
John chuckled. “Yeah, at least there’s that. You sure we’re good to go?”
Sherlock slept like he was pretending to be a starfish, sprawled out dramatically and taking up all the space he could. John knew that from all the other times they’d shared a hotel room, and the rare occasions where they were so tired after a case that they fell asleep together on the couch.
John took a clear breath. Nodded slowly, registering the words. “No hound,” he repeated quietly, exhaling slowly. “There is no hound.”
It was childish, yes. And stubborn. But both men were nothing if not stubborn and shared quite a few bouts of childishness (mostly on Sherlock’s part, although John would partake occasionally). And neither of them cared in the slightest.
A slow breath, then another, then they both turned to face the door. A silent agreement seemed to already be forming between them that they would do this together, this and everything else. They’d only been separated for all of twenty minutes but it had been unbearable. If that was what separation would be like from then on, so be it. They’d just never separate.
A memory sparked in the back of Molly’s head and she brightened up. “Oh! Does it have to do with that case you were looking into the other day? With the shoes and the boy that drowned?”
In that singular moment they were whole for the first time in nearly two years, two broken beings who’d found their way back to their other halves. There were still things to talk about – Mary, the fall, the time apart, the faked death and the twenty-one months of separation and lies – but the only words the two shared were mumbled apologies and quiet repetitions of each other’s names.
“I’ve got to do those stitches,” Mary said to Sherlock, and John didn’t bother asking what she meant. He’d already clocked the warm and slightly sticky spot on his temple to be a head wound. It didn’t
“Sherlock?” John frowned when his flatmate didn’t acknowledge him. “Sherlock, are you alright?”
He was tired.
“Hey, is that John’s phone?” he called over, frowning as Sherlock turned to him with a somewhat sheepish expression.
Unfortunately, even with Lestrade there, they were still having to do an unfair amount of damage control, so it was around one thirty in the bloody morning when John finally trudged upstairs. Sherlock stayed behind to have final word with Mycroft over the phone about the security of his ‘secret’ facilities, so John was alone as he changed into nightclothes and somehow mustered the energy to brush his teeth. He wasn’t alone when he walked back into their room, though – Sherlock was lying sprawled out on John’s bed in his own sleepwear. The man glanced up blearily when John walked in before face-planting back into the mattress.
Sherlock cleared his throat. “Yes, well, I’ll concede to that I suppose.”
“Yep. We just need you to fill this out before you leave,” Theo said slyly, sliding over a form that was extremely familiar yet slightly different. “So that next time, they’ll call Mr Holmes if he isn’t there.”
Yep, screw it.
that Mary knew she had no chance of replicating between herself and John. And quite frankly, it didn’t matter if that dangerous
John went over to switch off the lamp and flinched slightly at the eerie shadows cast on the walls by the moonlight that filtered through the curtain. He turned and slipped between the sheets of his bed, steadfastly ignoring the way Sherlock’s head shot up beside him with a strangled noise.
Mary just watched with a half-morbid, half-fascinated gaze as Sherlock spouted deductions, and Sherlock just continued tapping his fingertips against various parts of John’s head. Once he was apparently satisfied with whatever he was doing, he moved to straighten but stopped when John’s hand shot out surprisingly quickly and latched onto his wrist.
Note: thank you everyone for the comments and kudos, they make this fic worth it (^u^)
expression. “I promise,” he said softly, and Molly swore she could hear her own heart shattering like glass in her chest.
Now the ‘thefts’ were commonplace, and anything of John’s could practically be considered Sherlock’s as well. Both of them had gotten used to calling the Barts t-shirt
The thing about Sherlock was that even though he was ridiculously spontaneous and absolutely hated doing things on schedule, he was always out of bed before John was finished his morning shower. So when John exited the shower on an unusually cold September morning he was concerned by the lack of sound in the apartment. Sherlock did different things every morning, of course, but all of those things were usually loud. Whether it was the sweet lull of the violin, the clinking of beakers that signalled the start of a new experiment, or even gunshots whenever he got really bored, Sherlock was always doing
Alright, since they kept leaving the hospital like that, John could kind of see why Theo thought they were together. But still. They did not act that much like a couple.
“Alright, what’s this case that’s so important you had to bother me with it?”
Once they made it to the reception Sherlock leaned against the desk to sign the discharge papers and John caught sight of his emergency contact paper lying in Sherlock’s file. He was surprised they still did files hard-copy, and he was less surprised by the fact that his contact papers had been changed.
He also knew that
John chuckled, finally signing his name on the dotted line and officiating himself as Sherlock’s first contact in emergency situations. “I’ll ask when he’s less… well.” John motioned to Sherlock’s generally ruffled self. “You know what I mean.”
John sighed again even as his heart kicked up a beat fearfully at the words ‘rather deep cuts’. “I’ll be there in five minutes. Thank you.”
, alive, relatively whole, and looking like the weight of the world was pressing onto his shoulders as he gazed back at John almost fearfully.
John half-smiled. “Ah, no, I can’t, not always.”
The woman just nodded and gestured for him to follow as she led the way down long, narrow hallways. “He’s been asking for you,” she said tightly as they walked.
Once they were done and ready to leave Sherlock made to reach out but hesitated. John huffed a fond sigh and held out his arms. Sherlock brightened immediately and carefully wrapped an arm around John, tugging him gently to his feet.
Molly scaled the staircase to 221B, Lestrade and John’s girlfriend – Mary? – following close behind. The landlady had let them in with a smile and an “I’m surprised you didn’t pop by to see them sooner,” before wandering into the back. Molly didn’t know who ‘them’ was supposed to refer to, but judging by the slightly sour look on Mary’s face and the worried look on Lestrade’s, it couldn’t be good.
What? What was that about? They were insulting each other almost… fondly.
“A public surgery isn’t an option. Neither is a private hospital. We don’t know who did this, and until they’ve been caught John won’t be safe, especially not in his condition.” Throughout his clipped speech, Sherlock shifted John so that the man was upright and leaning on him. John followed without any real protest, only making vague noises in the back of his throat whenever Sherlock would accidentally brush against his head.
“Yeah, it’s great. It’s really, really great.” John took another bite of his pasta, missing Sherlock more the more they talked about him. “It’s been a miracle to have him back.”
– by an achingly familiar voice. An answer at normal volume that sent daggers through John’s head. He thought he recognised the second voice but he couldn’t be sure.
“Why, where did you hear that name?” Sherlock borderline demanded.
Sherlock hummed as John helped him to his feet. “M’kay, love,” he managed, swaying slightly on his feet. John stepped in to wrap a steadying arm around his waist, nodding at a shell-shocked Sarah as they passed her on their way to the door. He knew why she was shocked, obviously, but both John and Sherlock slipped up on occasion and instead of saying ‘git’ or ‘idiot’ they’d say ‘love’ or ‘darling’. He wasn’t going to draw extra attention to it by mentioning it – he was just going to carefully review the moment before filing it away with his other precious memories.
“John?” Mary said quietly and the man in question looked up, the movement followed by the person plastered to his back.
John did. He stopped talking and looked at Sherlock, registering the concern and slight fear he saw in those cerulean eyes.
John did. He focused enough for some semblance of sense to return to him, focused enough that the rest of the world stared to seep back in. The concrete pavement was rough beneath his knees. Sherlock’s hands were cold over his own, but he was long used to the chill.
“Care very much?” Sally immediately shot back, leaning against the table. “And where did
Sherlock huffed, snapped the book shut and looked up. “What do you want, Mycroft?”
“You… how…” John managed, blinking hard as his entire body began to shake. “
John Watson, not
People had reacted oddly to the ‘thefts’ at first, muttering about it behind John and Sherlock’s backs. John didn’t quite understand why it was made such a big deal of, but maybe that was because he was so used to it he couldn’t see the strangeness anymore.
“I know, they said over the phone,” John told her, barely catching the sharp turn she made into a room on their right. He stepped in after her to see Sherlock sitting on a gurney again, his shirt unbuttoned to reveal a rather nasty gash going perpendicular just over his collarbone. He perked up when John walked in, although there was a noticeable pallor to his skin.
‘Okay, yeah, but we broke up just a few hours ago on the grounds that I spent to much time on cases with you, and then I immediately show up at hospital to get you. What exactly is she supposed to think of that?” John mumbled while flipping through to the last form. It was his emergency contact sheet again, and another alteration had been made.
John’s phone?”
John chuckled quietly at Sherlock’s petulant tone. “Let me look at it, yeah?” he asked, gently nudging Sherlock’s head away so he could crouch down to put himself at eye-level with the man.
that it was a good idea, and had promptly and accidentally filled the entire room with concentrated chlorine gas. They’d left the room barricaded and bolted closed, not quite knowing what to do about it, but deciding that they could ask Molly in the morning.
Mycroft might have to upgrade their surveillance status again, if these kinds of details weren’t being picked up. After all, what use were his governmental powers if he couldn’t use them to spy on his little brother?
“Doctor,” Sherlock said quietly, and both Cerise and John turned to look at him. Cerise with a frown, and John with a tired smile that Sherlock echoed back at him weakly.
Once the adrenaline and euphoria began to wear off, the exhaustion set in, both emotionally and physically. The two men were honestly tired enough to just fall asleep there on the armchair, except that the couch looked more comfortable and was in fact only about two steps away.
Through the dark and the slight mist of rain, Sherlock could see John standing in front of the black slate gravestone that he knew possessed his own name in bold gold letters. He was speaking in a low murmur, and Sherlock strained to make out the words as he came closer.
Sherlock’s heart did that odd, off-beat, jumping thing it tended to do when John used an actual term of endearment instead of just their usual ‘insults’. Although technically their usual ‘insults’ were also used as terms of endearment. Confusing, but only if you weren’t used to it.
“I won’t,” Sherlock promised him, and Mary watched, feeling like a third wheel to her own fiancée and his best friend (technically, though, they weren’t engaged yet. Said best friend had also interrupted that).
“Of course,” replied John easily, and
But it was hours later, long after Mrs Hudson had gone do bed, when John finally worked up the nerve to ask the question that had been plaguing him the moment he’d received that phone call twenty-one months ago from his best friend, right before he threw himself off the roof.
The little piece of heart he had left wanted to solve the case of this missing eight-year-old girl just as much as any of them, but Sally, Anderson, Lestrade, Sherlock and John had all been crowded around a table covered in clues for the last four hours, trying to piece things together.
Sherlock checked his watch again. A whole hour had come and gone since he’d arrived – if this was anyone else he’d deem it not worth the trouble or the boring wait, but this was
“Yes, Shan. The Black Lotus general.”
Lestrade didn’t know, but he did know that he didn’t want to know.
Both Sherlock and John managed a nod for Molly this time and John kept a supporting arm around Sherlock all the way to the front desk, ignoring the looks they got from various hospital staff as they passed.
“Yes, well, you haven’t been around Barts as much since…” Molly faltered, realising the timing. “Well, since those serial suicides eight weeks ago.”
There. That was more accurate anyway, or at least it felt like it since he was having to haul Sherlock’s injured self out of hospital again.
John didn’t know how he would be able to fall asleep like that – with a soaring heart, an armful of genius and a mop of soft curls tickling his nose – but for once he didn’t give a damn.
Sherlock leaned over and snatched it back just before Theo could put it into the file. The manic grabbed a pen and made yet another alteration before handing it back over to Theo with a smug grin. John glimpsed what he’d written as the paper was put away.
Most people didn’t seem to be used it, but Sherlock didn’t know why. He and John had fallen into the pattern fairly quickly, and it was actually quite disappointing that no one else had noticed it. They had been extremely obvious about it, and Sherlock knew most people were idiots but he’d hoped that they weren’t
And neither of them minded in the slightest.
“Yes, well, one does tend to make a fair number of enemies when you thwart the criminal classes for a hobby. As soon as the public realised I was back, one of our enemies must have put an old plot into motion. I say old, because this entire operation took less than twenty-four hours to assemble. Something like this requires a lot of careful planning, so I’d bet it’s an unused plan from an old enemy rather than a recently concocted one by a newer force.”
Sherlock’s only reply was to shuffle over slightly more and move to bury his face in the pillow.
“Morning, idiot,” John greeted fondly as he walked past Sherlock into the kitchen. “Any severed limbs waiting for me in the fridge today?”
, his fingertips absently tracing shapeless patterns on the insides of John’s wrists.
John remembered the next falling asleep and the next waking. Sherlock was there for both, tucked against John’s side and drifting off mid sentence in their debate about the merits of Italian cuisine, and waking up just moments after John did with a quiet yawn and a stretch before slumping back into John’s side, cold fingers curling against his shirt. Mary wasn’t there, until later when she actually was, stepping through the door to find John sitting half-up in bed and tapping out a beat on the top of the empty takeaway box as Sherlock sat opposite him, correcting the beat and explaining how it had ‘been a part of Moriarty’s elaborate game’ and that the beat was ‘eventually meaningless but nonetheless oddly catchy’.
And precisely one second after Molly finished speaking, John walked into the room.
Word Count: 5286
Sherlock kicked his legs happily like a schoolboy as John walked up and checked him over. Sherlock’s eyes were half-closed drowsily despite his apparent energy, his shoulders were slouched, his suit jacket was suspiciously missing, his bespoke shirt was rumpled and undone an extra button, and his usually carefully tamed curls were wild and messy. John gave in to the urge to smooth them back from Sherlock’s forehead, and the madman himself leaned heavily into the touch.
The last part was mumbled under his breath and was clearly bait to lure Sherlock into another one of their ‘arguments’. Sherlock knew exactly what John was doing, and he still wilfully fell for it.
“Not a clue,” Sherlock whispered, at it set them off giggling.
dye vat!”
“I expect whatever imbecile was at the front desk has already told you,” he muttered stroppily.
Prompt: Terms of Endearment. Basically just John and Sherlock insulting each other/accidentally using ‘real’ terms of endearment.
“When did you take that?” John asked, as if just noticing Sherlock’s change in attire.
“Thank you,” he managed to mumble after another few moments. Sherlock just nodded, hands moving to clasp John’s wrists between them. They were standing almost nose to nose, nearly but not quite breathing the same air.
“We will,” John promised, sitting down into his own armchair as Sherlock took out his violin again.
“General Shan?” Lestrade asked, confused.
John’s cheeks heated slightly as he shrugged. “I take your point. I don’t mind, though,” he couldn’t help but add, placing his hand, palm up, between them.
“No, thank you,” he replied, his eyes fixed on John as the blood was cleaned away. “I’ll stay with John until he wakes up. I don’t need sleep.”
On any other occasion, Molly would say Sherlock was lying – he never said sorry, not sincerely. But for John Watson, he just might, and the look on his face said that he was telling the truth.
It happened first in Barts lab – or at least that’s where Molly first saw it happen. Sherlock was peering at a Petri dish filled with some poor person’s blood and John was asking questions about whether or not people were legally allowed to take severed heads from the morgue.
subtle with her hints for him to go. Maybe what little John had told her about him was right, maybe he was just that oblivious.
There, that was more fitting. He passed the clipboard back to Cerise without looking away from Sherlock and moved to help the man stand, knowing by now that Sherlock would never be able to walk out of the hospital without John supporting him.
Mycroft started briefly as John turned back to him before managing to compose himself. “My apologies, but I didn’t know you could make Sherlock speak on his quiet days.”
The pain was rolling in waves from his shoulder, and John clumsily reached up to touch it but was stopped by Sherlock guiding his hand back down and entwining their fingers.
“Yes?” drawled Sherlock without looking up from the book. “What do you want now?”
“It hurts,” he rasped, fingers of his injured arm twitching. “And I hate the cast.”
porcelain skin, because Sherlock was always cold.
It was very quickly becoming an addictive feeling and John probably needed to start ignoring it while he still could. Except then Sherlock did it again, practically creating sparks down John’s palm, and John suddenly and quite forcibly realised that he was screwed.
