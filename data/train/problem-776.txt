He didn’t tell her it was going to be alright or any other stupid platitudes. When her tears started to sputter out, he told her, “It’s not OK, but it is what it is. And we’ll be here for you, Susan. No matter what happens to Mary and me, we’re going to look after you. OK?”
happens to me.” He handed Harry a serviette. “Come on now, pull yourself together. We’re in this together, you and I. Besides, I’m not shipping off tomorrow. Mum’s got a few good months left. We’ll tell her about you and Clara, plan your wedding. Who knows, she might make it to Christmas yet.”
“What?”
John wondered, a bit stunned himself …). Sherlock planted his feet solidly beneath him, waiting for the dog to make another attempt to attack. But the dog tucked his tail under and slunk off backwards, his black eyes never leaving Sherlock’s face as growl after growl rumbled from his throat. The rafters shook again as it thundered outside. Finally the dog darted off.
“I can’t do what they’re asking,” her teeth had chattered. She had never been so afraid in her entire life, up until that point yet. “I can’t sabotage a police investigation. I can’t…”
“No, you can’t… you don’t mean that,” Victor gibbered as Sherlock examined his bow.
Not everything, apparently.
10 August 2015
Violet’s constant complaints of feeling out-of-sorts…
“Mr. Rucastle asked us to keep you entertained,” Mary felt a cold finger running down from the nape of her neck all the way down her back as Gang He purred, “For just a little while longer.”
Sherlock shook his head, starting to disappear into himself.
2 June 2016
Meanwhile, across the street, in a nondescript van, a weary and jet-lagged Anthea listened in, huge headphones over her dainty ears.
Lestrade wrung Sherlock’s hand then pulled him into a hug. Awkwardly, Sherlock patted him on the back, shooting Violet a pleading look to save him.
to say, before it’s all too late. I should have said it a long time ago, but I was too afraid. It was too hard to let you know… but I didn’t want to wreck it all, what we had.”
Again, as if he read his mind, Sherlock sighed impatiently, “John, do not let the sins of the past interfere with solving the crimes of the present. What was done cannot be undone. Forward, John. We move forward.”
Tuesday morning
“Actually,” John hesitated. “Maybe we could discuss Victor when Violet gets back? Save you from repeating yourself?”
do the shopping?”
John also knew she wore a Glock in a hip-holster underneath that woolen skirt and there was a switchblade tucked into her right boot.
, she belatedly realized as Rucastle grabbed her arm as she passed him.
“Now,” Jim stepped over Violet’s unmoving body to stand closer to Sherlock. “Tell me what you’re wearing, sexy girl.”
Lestrade cottoned on immediately. “Are you kidding me?”
“Violet, you need to stay away right now…” he warned her as he tried to flee… to fly…
“That’s an order,” he told her wearily as he texted Sherlock to let him know their parents were safe. “Also, I need an update on the Lestrades.”
“Your mother is here.”
Sherlock opened the door to find John, sitting on the floor, his back against the foot of the bed. There was only one light turned on, the small lamp on the nightstand between the two beds.
“Well, I was thinking about the first case of extreme sibling rivalry, but OK.”
“Looked like what?” Heathcliff squared his shoulders. His voice had a defensive edge to it. “OK, so I bounced his head on the ground, so what? I admitted it got out of hand, I said I was sorry and I’ll make amends. What more do you want?”
Violet and Sherlock exchanged a look.
Althelney Jones is my top computer analyst. She thinks she can pinpoint a location where John may have been when that video was recorded.
Sherlock emailed back…. just… not as himself.
?” Trager yelled.
“So?”
“Three cheers for the military,” Mycroft hoped the sarcasm would unnerve her.
“Study?”  John accepted the drink from her.
So he had stormed out of the bar, made his calls.  Once finished with that business, he re-emerged back into the bar section of the clubhouse. He had made eye-contact with Vibart then jerked his head towards the back, indicating he should follow him.
But the Professor had lost this round; John, stubborn, wonderful man that he was, refused to die. Sherlock refused to leave his side. He rode with him in the ambulance, longing to shout instructions to the medics, but wise enough to keep his mouth shut. He prowled outside the surgery theater, scaring off anyone who tried to escort him to the waiting room with only a look. Once John was wheeled out of surgery, Sherlock followed. He grabbed a chair and parked himself next to him, watching John breathe and waiting for the inevitable arrival of his wife.
“List? What list?” Lestrade snapped, limping towards them. He wore hospital scrubs, booties and held a cup of coffee in one hand and an ice pack in the other. There was Elastoplast taped over the goose egg that had swelled up on the spot where he had been hit across the temple. “I didn’t make a list and he wouldn’t be on it if I had.”
“I should kill you now,” Sherlock grumbled, dipping his head into the crook of John’s neck and shoulder, “Waking me at this ungodly hour.”
“Yes, yes, yes,” Sherlock said absently as a cab slowed down for his raised hand.
“Why does your dog keep eating my pets? He ate my koi fish last summer,” Sherlock had sulked as Mrs. Hudson tried to soothe a simultaneously infuriated and terrified Violet.
Violet and Mary caught the other’s eye and had a silent conversation as Molly gave her flower girl a cuddle.
“I do try.”
He wondered how nice Lady Moira would think his manners were after he beat His Honourable Heathcliff Cullen-Culpepper to a pulp.
Then he remembered his next appointment was with Mycroft at the Diogenes Club.
“Of course. They wouldn’t call me if it hadn’t been human ears. Now, lunch?”
“And that means we need to get leverage on him,” Violet took her fake glasses off and rubbed her tired eyes.
“Had to refinance it, the last time your father got in trouble,” Anna whispered. “The mortgage is more than the house’s worth.”
He buried his face in Violet’s shoulder to hide his blush. “It’s really over?” he asked again.
Irene started humming
“And we still have one child together, don’t we? Especially now we have confirmation that she is really mine. Although,” he gripped the slab with his hands, preparing to get down. “I would have accepted the child as mine even if she wasn’t. Mary should have

Happy Monday!
“Aren’t you?” A smile quirked up on Irene’s ashen face.
“Move,
But the first door on the right was wide open, revealing the loo to be empty.
“How rich?” his ears perked up. Money was money, after all.
Sherlock relented with a grumbled, “No. It was always you who kept us all grounded.”
is this woman still alive?”
“I can’t, you’re dead. You’re a skull,” Mitton whimpered.
Like the other victims, dental records had been used to identify Toni. Her identity came back a bit more quickly  than the others however. When John had arrived, Molly handed him a penlight, the tiniest of torches.
All of those reasons factored into Sherlock’s disinclination towards dating. However, no one ever realized that the main reason the teenaged Sherlock never pursued girls was pretty much the same reason other gangly, socially-awkward but ridiculously brilliant young men didn’t date: girls baffled him.

“Dull, get to the point,” requested the detective but a soft, regretful smile undermined the order.
a moment!” Then she let loose a tirade in machine-gun-fast French that had the cop pale-faced and backpedaling. When the cop left them in peace, Anthea said, “Ready?”
, John hid a smile as he lagged a step behind the detectives.
“Um, we’re kind of busy right now. Case and all,” John looked up at Sherlock and mouthed to him
Then he smiled, wanting nothing more than to take him into his arms.
“I-” he pulled his hand away now.
“Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson stooped down to pet Gladstone. “Your friend is here, Victor Trevor.”
“Then you best make a lasting impression,” Mr. Holmes said. “My little bird told me something else. Something interesting.”
“Oh, you’re the genius, figure it out yourself,” she said sourly, looking out the window, watching the Belgravia opulence fade away as the cab took them back to the working class area where Baker Street was located.
“I will not leave John. That was the fatal mistake I made during The Fall. I should have brought him with me,” Sherlock admitted bitterly, then added, “Once you and I explain everything to him, he would see the good sense in leaving London. He has no love for Mycroft.”
Jepthro Rucastle turned around on his stool, pins in his mouth when Toller announced Miss Smith. He frowned then said, moving his mouth around the pins, “Oh yes, that’s right.” He took the pins out of his mouth and stabbed them into the pin cushion he wore around his wrist like a corsage. Then he hefted his bulk off the foot stool with a groan, his back audibly popping.
“Don’t tell me.”
“Anthea is still young with her entire life as well as her career ahead of her. While she is greatly influenced by Mycroft, she is not completely corrupted by him.”
Susan swallowed and nodded, still twisting the cheap rings on her fingers, costume jewelry only a teenager would like. “My mum’s not going to get better, is she?” she sniffled, finally saying it out loud, finally admitting it to herself.
“At this point in the game, I usually just stand back and watch,” John admitted.
John slid out of Sherlock’s grip but by some miracle, Sherlock managed to seize John’s wrist. Then his other hand clamped over John’s wrist as John’s feet desperately scraped against the floor, which now tilted horribly at a steep angle. John reached up with his other hand, his fingertips scraping the seat Sherlock sat belted into. John knew the seatbelt had to be painfully digging into Sherlock’s waist. John knew Sherlock wouldn’t be able to hold onto him forever.
“No offense, but I really don’t care,” Violet Smith circled away from the men, looking for an escape route.
“Harry, John’s wife is very nice. You’ll see once you get to know her,” Clara pleaded.
“Oh, Violet made us a fry-up,” Sherlock gave Rucastle his scary-smile, the one that got him compared to Dr. Seuss’ Grinch. “You did say help yourself. Oh! And Violet made a plate for you. All you need to do is pop it into the microwave.”
The press had hounded The Freak about the disappearance of Miss Smith but received no answers. Dr. Watson hadn’t even addressed her absence on his blog. But then, he really hadn’t posted much on his blog other than to thank the readers for their good wishes and hopes for his speedy recovery. And that had been last February. The media drew their own conclusions then moved on to more scandalous stories.
To be continued in
“Yes, good, good,” Sherlock said in that faint voice he used when he was absolutely ignoring everything anyone had to say. Slowly he reached around the wall and found the light switch. “I find it terribly interesting,” Sherlock said as he turned the lights on in the attic vacation flat, “That this flat is allegedly still an active crime scene, but no police tape and more importantly, no police.” He entered the flat and John followed.
Finally he replied, “You want something more than unlimited political power and an open agreement to continue covering up your… ah…

Seven months old… she might be sitting up on her own by now… or not. Since she had been a preemie and all… she might be a bit behind developmentally… but still…
If she hadn’t been so terrified, she would have thought the gesture quaint.
Lifting her head up more, her hood slipped off. Still, despite this exposure, she took a step closer, her legs trembling. Clutching the straps to her backpack now for dear life, her toes hung over the edge. Her throat tightened as the violin music reverberated beautifully off the tiled walls and concrete floors.
What the actual fuck Sherlock? - JW
Overloaded
Sherlock furrowed his unkempt black brows as he watched two seagulls squabble over a crab desperately scuttling away from them.
“Aw, you don’t trust me?” he repeated himself from lunch, leering at her.
a young Sinté lady who’d left her Traveller family in order to obtain an education, was in the driver’s seat. Upon seeing him approach the Volvo at a dead-run, she threw open the passenger side door and merged into traffic the minute he dived in. Her bracelets jangled as she did so.
Now, Mycroft stood in front of the hotel where John and Dupin were lodging. He had caught them in the act, caught them all in the act, trying to deceive him and yet…
Keeping her eyes on Edward while rubbing sun-block on her legs, she added, “I also knew it was only a matter of time before  Sherlock would deduce what we were doing and would tell you.”
After all, Mycroft probably wouldn’t think about searching Lestrade’s brother’s flat.
Finally, one of the original founders of the Devil’s Foot, a grumpy old man named Gordon but lovingly referred to as “The General” pulled rank. “Listen, just put the little bastards in the back of my old service van.” The General, when he hadn’t been running guns and causing chaos, had also been a plumber. He had retired from plumbing five years ago. He had retired from running guns when the Sons of Anarchy had demanded that the Devil’s Foot go legit in order to patch over. But he was still very good at causing chaos. He had happily helped block the street when the Red-Headed League’s delivery van had been carjacked by the Sons and the Devil’s Foot.
“Sherlock.”
.” Julia smirked and picked up the jumper again. “To him, you may be always be The Woman, but Miss Smith… well, she’s The Queen, isn’t she?” She risked a glance at the chess board “And the King’s job is to sacrifice himself to protect the Queen, right?” She threw the jumper at Irene. “And put that on. I’m tired of looking at your tits.”
She didn’t walk back to her leased car right away. Instead, she followed the stone path to the sea. She removed her trainers and socks and rolled up her trousers. Despite the biting cold of the sea, she waded in up over her ankles.
“Why is he eating my fish? He has dog food. Those fish were expensive!”
,” she added after Sherlock sneezed.
“No, just, listen, OK? Just… I know it can’t work, it won’t work,” he seemed to be trying to convince himself rather than Violet. “Not in this world. But,” he tilted his head, his dark eyes soft and guileless as a puppy dog.  “If things were different, if I was an ordinary bloke and you were a real British girl, and I had asked you to go out with me for a pint or to see a film… would yo-”
“You are being petty. Your gender has nothing to do with what we have and you know that.”

over and over.
Chapter Twenty-seven:
, Violet miserably realized but felt relief when the torch light was clicked off.
“How long can you stay?” Victor rasped, holding him close, running his hand down Sherlock’s back. “I don’t have a lot of time, but I do have a little time before I need to meet Patricia.”
“No, you’re not,” a familiar voice said behind him.
…) Sherlock poured John and himself a stiff drink and invited John to come sit in front of the fireplace and have a drink. John had dithered. Sherlock had insisted.
John glared at the backs of his three companions as he quickly put his coat and scarf back on. Then he hit redial, “Violet?”
Affectionately, Victor watched Sherlock toe off his trainers, divest himself of his leather jacket and red scarf. Half-listening to Sherlock natter on about some great discovery he had made today, Victor reflected how good Prague had been for him. Rehab had been ghastly, or at least that was what Sherlock had told Victor once they reunited after he had completed his treatment. But it was either rehab or prison. Mycroft had been less than amused when he had to bail his little brother out of gaol for possession charges… again.
“What’s going on?”
“You are exactly the same as when I had met you in university,” Sherlock cut across him coldly. “A spoilt child who grew up to become a selfish man who only cares about getting what he wants regardless of who he hurts in the process. And a weakling obsessed with appearances, always keeping up with the Joneses, always looking at the neighbors’ greener garden instead of tending to his own.”
Manchester, England
engagement ring?” Janine pointed at the ring on Violet’s finger.
What about Mycroft?
“Thinking.”
She was not going to ruin tonight by wasting any thoughts on Sherlock Holmes. Not tonight.
John felt sweat dripping off his face and down his back. “Sherlock… you go first.”
4:29 PM
John’s stomach twisted a bit, thinking about Rucastle’s possible benefactor. “What if he comes back from Thailand early? The Earl?”
A long think like this required copious amounts of tea.
Before Mary showed up, he had sat still and silent as a stone by John’s side. He so wanted to touch him, to reassure himself that John was safe, John was alive, John wasn’t going to leave him again…
“We know,” Mitton said. “And I understand why. I’m the one who got the intel about the double-hit, Mr. Holmes, if you recall.”
Violet, meanwhile, radiated fury. “Very well,” she said coolly enough, however, in the King’s English. Gladstone, sensing her tension, sat down right next to her and leaned his heavy, furry body next to hers. Violet looked down fondly at her dog and ran her hand over his head, finding comfort in his soft fur and big doggy-brown eyes.
“I knew my grandsons. I raised them when their worthless father ran off and their mother was too despondent to do her duty as a parent. I raised them. I know them like I know myself and if Richard said he created a… what did you call it? A master key, well, then he did.”
He took out his mobile again and sent a group text to Sherlock, Lestrade and Alex MacDonald:
“Oh, I’m a little under the weather, but nothing serious. Really, this wasn’t necessary.”
“He was a bit fussy, but Mrs. Hudson said she could handle it.”
It was worse, actually.
Holmes himself hadn’t been mentioned in the media since last January, after Dr. Watson had been found after his latest horrifying ordeal caused by his friendship with The Freak.
But he definitely felt John rising up onto his toes then pressing his lips onto his throat.
** EDITED to add: that I am a gigantic jerk. In my sleep deprivation, I completely forgot to thank LucanaelDelSayan for helping me with the French translations! So merci beaucoup Lucanael ... or something like that! :^)
“Violet,” Sherlock’s voice hardened. “Look at me.”
Violet arched an eyebrow. “John won’t notice?”
It was in fact, very peaceful and quite pretty, almost like a park. Although John didn’t fancy the idea of taking a picnic lunch and spending the day there, he found the knot of anxiety loosening in his chest as he took in all the unique grave markers and tiny little mausoleums crammed one right next to the other. From time to time, he found himself opening his mouth to ask Sherlock what he was observing, but then would snap it shut again, not trusting himself to speak.
friend in so much pain. “What did he do?” he demanded coldly. “What. Did. He. Say?”
Having lost his taste for his game, John had turned the app off and studied his good black shoes for the rest of the car ride to the Prime Minister’s office.
“He was a hacker,” Violet looked around the autopsy bay for a stool or a chair. Her legs felt rubbery and her head throbbed. Plus, the obnoxious pins-and-needles sensation was back, in both her arms and hands this time. Spying a stool, she plodded towards it. “I take it he joined the Homeless Network after he got out of rehab?”
Sherlock nodded but his face didn’t relax. “I need to think. I need to… deduce where Peters is hiding in London. He is not in Professor Moriarty’s good graces. You and Violet both survived, plus Violet shot him. Now Sally escaped with her life. Peters isn’t just hiding from us or the Met. He’s hiding from
“Still has a sensitive stomach,” the Early smiled thinly. “I suppose he still eats like a bird too.” Jovially, he told Georgina, “He was an awful pest when he was a little boy, William. Always following me and Mickey around, wanting us to play with him,” he chortled.
What the little sluts did on their own time was none of her concern, of course, unless they got caught. Then immediate termination, of course. Same with drug use; if a girl wanted to get lit while in the privacy of her own flat, fine. Getting high on the job, unacceptable. Loads of girls had been fired, actually. Loads more quit, especially when they realized that this was actually
“What’s her name?” Violet asked, “Your daughter.”
“No,” Chibs stood nose-to-nose with the Englishman, “But I’ve got a packet of Certs I can give ya, you toffee-nosed, howlin’ Jessie.”
The old lion stroked his beard. “Have you found John Mitton yet?”
counts
“As theories go, it’s quite unlikely she did the deed herself although not quite implausible. As I have told you before, Jo-”
“We’ll get on it,” the guard nodded again, as if that motion helped. “Let’s find out if Flight 1122 landed on time.”
The next morning, Sherlock made coffee the way she liked it and tried to apologize. “I was unspeakably rude yesterday aftern-”
“No, I mean I could break into the Tower, the Bank and the Palace. All at once.”
“Why… this is what I can’t wrap my head around, Holmes,” Sally waved her hand around her head. “Why didn’t she go to the police? Why didn’t she tell John what had happened?”
“Practice does make perfect,” Lestrade agreed with another yawn.
Dupin chuckled, tapped on the stone archway of the doorway then departed. Violet pointed the gun to the floor andleaned flush against the stone wall, her head turned towards the doorway. Sherlock switched off the torch then they were both plunged into darkness.
Wednesday morning
“What?” Mrs. Hudson squeaked.
He buried Harry next to their mother. He didn’t care about where his father’s final resting place would be. That funeral wasn’t going to be his problem.
“Yes,” Sherlock now sounded mildly perturbed.
“Not any longer, apparently.”
“You didn’t perish when Sherlock pushed you into the Thames.”
“No.” Then he sullenly added, “Thank you.”
she silently added. Out loud, she told Mycroft, “However, my final demand is one that I think you will enjoy.”
Tuesday
“Sherlock,” Mycroft dug the point of his umbrella into the ugly area rug.
“Sure you don’t want to drive along with us?” Vibart asked.
“Oh for God’s sake,” John grumbled then yelled, “Oi, don’t stay in there too long!”
“Then you dropped the tutoring to a part-time occupation because you were employed full-time at Carruthers Brokerage Firm… a personal assistant to one of the owners, a Robert Carruthers. Why did tutoring stop being a priority?”
“Fuck!” John burst out upon seeing a young man, lying on the pavement, throat slit, ears sliced clean away.
to work for MI-6?”
“I know, isn’t it beautiful?” Sherlock moaned like a besotted schoolgirl.
“Oh John, I’m so proud of you, you are finally learning how to observe. Well done.”
3:00 PM          Leisure Time
A situation in which a player is under threat of a back-rank mate and, having no time/option to create an escape for the king, must constantly watch and defend against that threat, for example by keeping a rook on the back rank.
This concerned her. Immensely.
Sherlock whipped his head around, “Oh John,” he sounded so relieved that John wanted to drop to the floor and weep right there.
“No,” Mary fumbled, expecting to do battle with rabid wolves and finding a petrified rabbit instead. “She is staying with me, though. May I come in?”
Sherlock crossed the room to John. He put his hands on John’s shoulders. Running his thumbs along John’s collarbones, he gave him the good news, “Violet found video surveillance video taken on January 12 of this year, at Salt Lake City International Airport of an unidentified woman handing off a female toddler to one Anthea Bellamy, time stamp at 8:15.”
Then there had been that one man with a toddler that Violet strongly suspected he had abducted from his estranged wife. He absolutely doted on the boy, took him out daily to the rusty old playground so he could push him on the squeaky swings or try making the merry-go-round spin for him. He always had treats and snacks for the kid while he looked like he could do with a good feeding up. While the chubby boy laughed and clapped his hands as he played outside, the man always looked around with a wary, hunted look on his thin bearded face.
“Fuck…” she whispered to herself, swinging her leg over the bike as she dismounted.
Sherlock returned his head to the Union Jack pillow that usually sat on John’s Chair, the smug smile again creasing his lips. No matter how old Mycroft was, either seven or forty-seven, Mycroft loved games. More importantly, he loved winning games.
“Oh, I’m fine,” Violet insisted as she felt the rain running down her neck and starting to soak through her balaclava and trousers.
“You caused quite a kerfluffle, young lady,” Professor Moriarty scolded her, looking at her over his spectacles. “All that money stolen from all of my business associates; weren’t you taught not to take things that aren’t yours?
“Why what? I require more data.”
Her throat tightened as she remembered arriving for the first time as an invited guest to 221B Baker Street. Sherlock had pushed her into the Thames so MI-6 couldn’t detain her then had jumped in after her. They had arrived, wet, dirty and hating each other. John Watson had fussed over them, had treated their hypothermia, insisting that they sit closely next to each other on the sofa for the body heat.
“Right, of course,” Mycroft took a gentlemanly step back and gestured towards the door.
30 December 2015
“No,” Harry answered for her mother.
. Oh Christ, you’re engaged, you’re supposed…” he looked around. “Do you think anyone saw us?”
“Oh, thank God,” John moaned, bowing his head.
“Yeah, well, speaking of rubbing off…”
It was never good when Mary vanished.
“That so?” Now Peters looked amused. “Well. What do you want?”
While the brawls and shrieking matches went on in the parking lot, she
stop him. So you wouldn’t have had to confront him alone at St. Bart’s. I want you to not have jumped off that bloody roof. Can you do that?”
“Sherlock,” Violet tried to smile at him. “What are
Realizing she was not going to get away without being poked and prodded, Violet frowned and heaved herself back up on the bed, feeling like a child trying to climb back up into an overlarge chair. “Very well,” she muttered as a blonde woman wearing traditional hospital scrubs entered, carrying some sort of tablet. Only after texting Mary again, she added, “Proceed.”
Shame that Jepthro Rucastle had been a clinically insane abuser of women; he really did have an eye for what colours complemented one’s complexion.
everything else.”
Molly rolled over and pushed her auburn fringe out of her eyes. “Yes?” her voice hesitant and nervous, sounding very much like the old Molly, the mousy Molly.
“Yes, yes, yes,” Sherlock wrapped his arm around John’s waist as John sighed and put his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders. “I know, I know, its poor manners to mock your wife for shooting me. Although I do think it was rather rude she shot me in the first place.”
Once everyone else was inside and the vehicle merged back into traffic, John asked, “Where’s Anthea?”
“Hello, John,” Sherlock said, still keeping his eyes closed.
“Washington DC.”
“Are you trying to make me cry?”
She flipped her chestnut curls over her shoulder and trudged out of the bathroom. She pulled on the dressing gown awkwardly, her sprained fingers protesting. She belted it around her narrow waist the best she could then shoveled her feet into the slippers.
, she grit her teeth.
. She wished she would have had time to put lipstick on in order to draw more attention to her lips, but it couldn’t be helped.
, the bleeding nerve of her! Wanting me to bail her out when she’s been on the sauce again, plus gambling to boot. Not to mention cruising secondary schools looking for dates. How old was that little tart of hers anyway? Did you say eighteen?”
Violet crossed her arms and jutted her chin up. “Your cute, condescending comments aren’t helping me understand what exactly I’m supposed to protect Sherlock from?”
“Fix it? You mean it’s actually broken?”
“Oh,” Mary lowered herself onto the other hideous pink armchair. She bowed her head. “Oh,” she said again, more softly  this time.
Mrs. Holmes shook her head. “Whatever you are planning,” she threatened as coldly as she could in her old-woman’s voice, “Don’t.”
A thump upstairs startled him. John all but leapt to his feet. “Mary?”
isn’t a proper verb,” Sherlock rumbled before pressing a kiss between that vulnerable bit of flesh between John’s neck and shoulder. “Or even a real word.”
John trained his eyes on Edwards, remembering running his finger over Maisie’s tiny tummy, her bird-like legs kicking out, as if she were  still safe in Mary’s womb.
Violet nodded, “Supposed to be.”
4:35 PM
“Fuckin’ patch-over?”
Finally Sherlock decided to sneak off like he had at John and Mary’s wedding dance. He had even pulled the Belstaff on when Molly appeared in front of him, holding a wiggling, drooling Henry. “A bit overwhelmed, aren’t you?” she asked in a low, gentle voice.
“I think Holmes was working with Moriarty, not trying to stop him,” Mason said in triumph, proud of his good detective work. “I think Holmes faked both their deaths and he probably faked Jim Moriarty’s death again. That fucker is still probably alive.”
Plus it would be terribly rude to cough all over her when she was attempting to comfort him.
“Oh. Right,” John mumbled.
Upon hearing Sherlock’s grunt of approval, John exited the bathroom and strode into the master bedroom. Out of habit, he picked up his mobile. He rolled his eyes mightily when he saw a missed call from Mary.
Violet rolled her eyes. As Toller stumbled towards her though, she started backing away, her eyes slits, her pretty mouth turned down in an ugly snarl. She winced as she walked barefoot over the pea gravel. But her throat had dried up with fear. Her hands and fingertips had gone absolutely numb. An ache radiated from deep within her bones. Her stomach ached, lingering effects, she assumed from Rucastle’s attempts to poison her.
Go to Mary’s. Now.
“Wretched hound,” Sherlock sighed as picked up his mug of tea and settled himself down at the other end of the sofa. He still wore the trousers and nice shirt he had put on this morning, but had shed the suit jacket and shoes after he had deposited Violet on the sofa. “Eat,” he told her brusquely before sipping his tea.
I don't think the late ACD minds if I play with his characters, but I'm afraid he might haunt me if I take credit for them! :^)
But soon, the familiar and drab rows of council housing appeared. Sooner than John liked, Mary parked her little car behind a very nice Audi R8 luxury car. Next to the car, a petite woman was wearing a posh fur coat with a fuchsia cashmere scarf wound around her neck. She stood alone, next to a street lamp, smoking a cigarette. She was a dark-haired beauty who looked very,
“Fine,” Peters grinned good-naturedly. He took his gun out, held it and the knife up for her to see, then placed them carefully on the altar as if they were the chalice and the ciborium.
She capitulated, crumbled in fact. Dissolved into tears, right in front the British Government.
“And they’re totes OK with it,” Susan tried to sound tough but Mary heard the unasked question:
If inconvenient, come anyway – SH
“Good. I’d hate to be boring,” Violet smiled then leaned in to give him a chaste peck on his lips.
Mycroft nodded. This matched the intelligence he had received previously on Magnussen. “But he changed his plan,” he informed Mary. “By Christmas of last year, he had decided to merely blackmail me instead of killing me. Do you know why?”
“Look for a Sigma SD14,” he dropped his hands. “That’s what she had when she ambushed Violet and me at Baker Street, but Violet smashed it. People are slaves to habit and loyal to brands, I  being no exception since I prefer iPhones.”

William sucked in a quavering breath. “I
He shook his head. He knew the logical response would be to shut this down before it progressed into something unsustainable. A thousand fabrications sprung up in his fertile, inventive mind then they all wilted and died when he looked into her eyes.
Everything went to hell
Hope tilted her head to the side and smiled back. “I love you too,” she stood on her tiptoes and gave him a peck on the lips. Then she gave him a proper kiss. “And I will think about it. I promise. I’m just… scared. I don’t want anything to happen to you or Lucy.”
“Dear, dear, Baby Brother, you don’t often make errors,” Mycroft continued speaking quite coolly. “But when you do, they are staggeringly enormous. Your blunder regarding a certain Miss Adler and the Bond Air fiasco comes to mind.”
“Just relieved I’ll be able to retire soon,” James sat back down in his chair after taking the handkerchief from Jim.  He dabbed his eyes then asked, “You ready to take over for me?”
“Why wait for upstairs?” Mary slid her hand up his chest. “The loo is around the corner.”
“… so Daddy and I were thinking about popping into New York to see a show. I heard that
6:35 AM
Now Rucastle glowed with pleasure and rubbed his hands together. “Really? I say, last night was… well other than that awkwardness with Old What’s-Her-Name, yes, last night was most delightful. Oh, I say, how did things turn out with your brother?”
She would have preferred to go to her appointment alone.
“Greg,” Mary’s voice wobbled.
He felt Sherlock take his hand. For a weird, wild moment, he thought Sherlock was trying to hold his hand, like they were an actual couple.
right now.”
Mary, meanwhile, chewed on a hangnail as she got lost in her own thoughts.
10:01 AM
He hated admitting that he was
“Yes,” Mycroft had tried to sound bored.

“After he was mauled by your dog.”
Lady Smallwood looked up from the computer screen, her ash-blonde hair perfectly coiffed as usual, pearls around her throat, navy jacket and matching pencil skirt impeccably tailored to her tiny frame.
“What’s your name, sweetheart?”
Sherlock immediately decided John wasn’t allowed to wear his god-awful “dad jeans” ever again.  He vowed to find a way to ensure he would only wear properly fitting denims and bespoke trousers, starting as birthday and Christmas presents, so he wouldn’t be offended. John could be tetchy sometimes when it came to his clothes.
“You’re reading it wrong,” Lisbeth huffed, dropping the laptop bag next to her rucksack. “You read Middle Eastern languages right to left, not left to right.”
John felt his throat start to tighten as he remembered something Sherlock had said after he had finally and permanently showed that twat Victor Trevor the door:
“Oh, I should have known,” he leaned back in his chair, running his thumb over the screen when Sherlock’s text appeared:
“Now perhaps isn’t the best tim-” he tried to assert himself.
“Enjoy herself a bit? Yes, I think that is a very good idea,” Mrs. Holmes gave her son a too-sweet-to-be-sweet smile. “Everyone else has had a turn now. It’s your turn to responsible for him now, for just a bit anyway.”
. MI-5, MI-6 and Her Royal Majesty’s Secret Service. The military, active and reserves. Last (and quite possibly the least,) The Met, from their special tactic forces to the desk jockeys like DI Dimmock and DI Mason. The latter two looked like little boys playing dress-up rather than proper police officers.
Now, groggy with exhaustion and early pregnancy, she longed for her yoga pants, one of John’s baggy old jumpers and her bed.
Meanwhile Mary clutched her belly, slumped to her knees then collapsed to her side, still pressing her hands over her belly.
Anthea couldn’t even find him.
“Is he alright?”
on top of the steeple promising protection from above for those down below. The abbey looked more like a castle, a home for the beautiful princess or a prison for the fearsome monster. Meanwhile the rain had transformed into snow, the fluffy kind almost always only seen on Christmas cards and in holiday films.
“The imbecile can and is,” Sherlock said, his teeth still clenched.
Sorry for missing last week's post... it's been a little crazy in my corner of the universe. This week's not looking to be much better... BUT I've got some vacation time coming to me so hopefully I can FINALLY have time to do some solid writing as I'm getting VERY close to finish writing this fic.
But Sherlock’s warning came too late and John returned to the World of Hurt.
As Sherlock pulled the gloves on, Mary shot him an irritated look. “Not the cool box, no. I know better than that. But there was an envelope addressed to me still at the bottom of the parcel. Peters must have put the letter in first, then the cool box, then boxed it all up nice and tidy.”
Using one of her many false identities, Lisbeth rented a reasonable sedan that could comfortably seat four.
24 April 2016
“Sleep-deprivation leads to mood swings,” Sherlock said sweetly. “I think you should practice what you preach my dear Violet and go to bed.”
“Rejection, mostly,” Dupin said blandly. “Obvious by the way you overcompensate. Your military history, your medical skills, your blog, your dating history…
“Shut up,” Sherlock snapped at John. Then to Violet, he snapped, “Not you. Go on.”
In the meantime, please comment! I will do better about replying! But I read every single one and if I could kudo comments, I totally would  :^)
,” she safetied the Sig and tossed it at Sherlock. When he caught it, she grinned, “Congratulations, you killed Jim Moriarty.”
“What gave that away? The accent or the bluntness?”
She only sighed and Sherlock felt a sick, heavy dread pooling in his belly. That particular battle wasn’t over yet.
Toller tried to grab at Violet. Desperately she snapped her leg back to execute a front-kick, a move she had done hundreds, thousands of times. Hours of practice in the gym at kickboxing classes and hours of practical use in the field and while she had been on the run.
“Maybe it would be better if I speak to Molly?” Violet Smith added while thinking,
“I can’t believe I actually missed you,” John scowled as he rose to refill the kettle.
“Someone doesn’t want us going to France,” Sherlock tented his fingers, mulling over the newest puzzle now that the immediate crisis was over.

“You think… Miss Smith is missing because of Sherly?”
box.”
“Let’s see what else is on,” John quickly changed the channel before anything really raunchy was said or shown.
A door in his Mind Palace opened. Sherlock peered in, seeing 221B… Violet sitting very poised on the sofa while John pointed a gun at her. In a calm voice, she described to John her transactions with Jim Moriarty…
“So you keep telling me.”

“What?” John jumped then said irritably, “We’re not… Of course I’m not comfortable discussing
“You know who this is,” he spat with no preamble at all. “And you know who my brother’s fiancée is,” he squeezed his eyes tightly shut and massaged his brow.
10:31 AM
Sucking in great, big whooping gulps of air, she ripped the fake glasses off her face and shoved them in her coat pocket. She then wiped her wet face on her coat sleeve like a child. Despite the throbbing ache in her fingers and arms and legs and abs (all repercussions from the explosion at her clinic) she pulled her Triumph out from behind its hiding place. She pressed her lips together as she swung a sore and aching leg over the saddle of the bike. She ripped the plastic brace off her fingers so they could be mobile. She sobbed again, this time from pain as she squeezed the throttle, her sprained fingers protesting. But the pain was bearable, so she switched the ignition on, revved the throttle, knocked the kickstand up with the heel of her boot and backed up the bike.
There was also Harry’s gambling debts. Both John and Mary had started receiving ominous phone calls, threatening death and dismemberment if someone didn’t pay what Harry owed. Sherlock had deduced and tracked down one loan shark, hauling him to New Scotland Yard by the scruff of his neck like a mother cat dragging a recalcitrant kitten away.
. You should have left my people alone. You should have been satisfied with chasing jewel thieves and philandering husbands. You should have
. See how he’s doing.
John wondered as he limped behind everyone else as Rucastle began his tour of The Copper Beaches.
He flipped his laptop open. His fingers hovered over the keyboard.
“Fair enough, but in this case, I need to know the truth.”
She had poked around her dad’s death here and there, more as a hobby than anything else.
“Hang on,” John had kept all his medication in the bath upstairs and as far as he was aware, Sherlock never went upstairs when he and Mrs. Hudson came over for roast beef and mashed potatoes. “How did you know I was taking anti-anxiety meds?”
“Exactly,” Violet produced a tight, sour little smile. “And you know he wouldn’t have to necessarily die from those injuries. Just be paralyzed from the nose down.”
“I’m quite sure I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Sherlock said airily.
The first time John saw a dirty street kid snoring away on the sofa, he had been aghast. Convinced that the kid was either going to slit their throats or rob them blind in their sleep, or both, John protested, firmly stating that they need to call the police. Sherlock shrugged him off, by saying, “He’s a thirteen-year-old boy that’s been passed from john to john. He’s not robbing nor murdering anyone. He’s just tired and needs a place to sleep without being bothered.”
me? Do you have any idea how much that fine was? Not to mention how humiliating it was to stand there in front of the magistrate while he lectured me how I was old enough to know better, that it was a disgrace that a military man such as myself would get involved in something as childish as tagging a building… you’re not even listening to me, are you?” John demanded as they got on the lift.
Sherlock made a big pretence
. Something that will convince Patricia and her family to let me walk away clean,” Victor stood up now, his eyes pleading. “You are the only one that is clever enough to find that kind of information.”
When the door clicked shut after Victor took his leave, Sherlock opened his eyes, fished his cigarettes and lighter out of his jacket pocket, snatched up Violet’s tea cup (still three-quarters full of tea) and made his way up to the rooftop. The only place he was allowed to smoke.
Molly wiped the chocolate off her lips and took a deep, shuddering breath.
“No, first thing tomorrow is OK,” Missy swallowed a yawn.  Her business forced her to be a night-owl. She usually did her bookkeeping and scheduling while waiting for her girls to notify her that their assignment was finished and they were safe. “But Saffy? Next time you need to call immediately when the job’s done. I nearly called the coppers to go looking for you.”
“I am just as much to blame for that decision,” Jim accepted the cup. “I thought it would be better if he remained in London, remained close so we could keep an eye on him. I never dreamt he would obsess over Holmes the way he did.”
John and Sherlock together again while Mary and Violet take off on their own adventure.
Swallowing hard, Mitton continued to survey the room, taking in the young man with a mop of brown hair and a goatee, stripped down to his boxers. Sweat beaded his pale, sunburnt flesh as he knelt at the register, trying to get the A/C going again.
He didn’t complain. He knew that because of his newly acquired heroin addiction he currently had a free pass to smoke. Everyone would rather have him risk cancer than to start using again. The least he could do was take his methadone with minimal complaint and smoke outside.
“Because Richard tricked the London RHL cell into thinking

And if she still doesn’t cut back after that, we may have to think about shipping her off to rehab.  I’m serious, it’s getting bad. I get high just walking past her front door.
“I always wondered why your Spanish had a
Mary had nodded in approval when she saw the gun in its holster strapped to Violet’s hip after she had shimmied out of her skirt.
“Hm. Neat. And no one noticed?”
An envelope, wrapped in a plastic sandwich bag, rested inside the book. Except for a layer of dust, it looked practically new.
“I like it,” Greg rested his forehead against Molly’s. “Do you like it, Little Man?” he rubbed Molly’s belly and smiled when he felt the butterfly kicks. “I think he does.”
“Tea is fine. Send Victor up.”
“You were in his way. Magnussen had millions of American dollars invested into a major medical health insurance company. This company wanted to expand into the European markets, specifically in English speaking countries. He wanted you to use your influence to get the ball rolling to do away with the NHS”
They also both had enormous iced coffees from Dunkin’ Donuts, which, for some reason, amused Sherlock.
“She does.”
31 May 2016
“I’d love to interrogate those sons-of-bitches,” Violet dumped the purse upside-down then knelt to sift through the contents.
Still smiling, Violet said, “He started flirting with me, asking me if it was a date. Turned out, it was. We had pizza and beer that night at this dive and… we clicked. He wasn’t just my boyfriend, he was my best friend. We disagreed on enough trivial things so we wouldn’t get bored with each other, but we agreed on the same things that were important to us…

Finally, they could all make out what caused the light and sound show.
As a doctor, he knew how men in same-sex relationships achieved carnal satisfaction, but he had absorbed that information with clinical detachment. He had also seen a variety of sexual mishaps during his time in a variety of surgeries, from both straight and gay couples. All of those mishaps appeared to be quite painful as well as mortifying.
“I’ll do my own hair and make-up, thanks,” Violet said quickly.
“Paracetamol and an ice-pack will help with the headache.” Dr. Sankaran assured her. But when she slid off the bed again and wobbled on her feet, he frowned. Then he gently ordered her, “Walk across the room if you could, please.”
He looked up at the vents.
She blinked then saw Sherlock sitting in a wooden chair next to an antique phonograph, trying to re-wrap his cut-up knuckles. His black brows were furrowed in fierce concentration.
3:57 PM
,” the girl suddenly wailed again and ran towards Victor, splashing water everywhere.
“Did the elder Mr. Holmes threaten you? Tell you leave in order to protect his younger brother from additional scandal and prosecution?”
He was knelt down by her bookshelf, thumbing through one of her medical tomes.
“Fine, fine,” Gagnon took off his eyeglasses. He fished a handkerchief out of his pocket. Cleaning his glasses, he muttered, “Yes, I agree that is more than adequate compensation for his troubles. Then warily he added, “And you? What do you require for compensation?”
“We both know she likes me best.”
“It can wait one fucking day.”
Julia was just coming to when Sherlock entered. She shook her blonde head then looked up at the detective. “Your bloody fiancée
Sherlock put his personal mobile down on the kitchen counter and took the glass of water into the lounge. Condensation was already building up on the glass. Beads of water slid down his hand as Sherlock walked to the piano, untouched since Violet had left.
Determined to only touch John with his lips and tongue, Sherlock hovered over John as he worked his way down his body.
“There is no one like Holmes,” Jim’s face twisted up in a cruel smile. “Oh, he is fun to toy with, Grandpa. I can understand Richie’s attraction.”
She followed the criminals and the consulting detective.
She had other safety measures to set up, but those could wait. She wasn’t tired.
“God,” Victor whistled. “You know, I never thought I’d feel sorry for Alice. Always a cold fish. A right bitch to me too, she was.”
“Yeah, well, your leg’s all torn up too, come on,” unselfconsciously, Victor wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s torso and helped him stand. “Taking you to see the nurse,” he informed Sherlock as he draped Sherlock’s arm over his own broad shoulders. “Think you can manage?”
Violet reacted viscerally to the picture, actually recoiling. She had reconciled to what she had witnessed in the foyer of Baker Street, made her peace with it, or so she thought. Seeing the photograph dredged up the wild, angry
“What? Why?” John pulled himself out of her grasp.
“Holy God,” John blinked as Lestrade’s mouth dropped open.
Once outside, Violet gasped as an unexpectedly chill wind hit her. Knowing the police had probably been alerted the minute she pulled the emergency cord, Violet assessed her situation as quickly as possible. She couldn’t just jump from the train to the tracks; she would be electrocuted the minute she touched the rails.
The minute John sank into the vinyl cab seat, all  his energy and adrenaline seeped away, as if his bones and muscles had been replaced by used rubber bands,  all stretched out of shape.
“It was a mistake to order you to drop Lady Smallwood’s case when she hired you to protect her from Magnussen. I should have known better, I should have realized that only would have fueled your curiosity.” He wetted his lips.
“Exactly so,” He kissed her temple. “Go to sleep.”
“Yeah, that was weird and awesome all the same time,” Violet admitted.
While Rucastle puffed up the hill, Mrs. Toller was busy screeching at Toller: “You idiot, what on earth are you doing? You were supposed to have her ready ages ago!”
Her intuition tingled again, ever so slightly.  Like one lone note played on a piano. Or one violin string plucked.
“Yes, of course. Well done,” Sherlock murmured as he fished out his iPhone. Quickly, he thumbed a text to Dupin to let him know where Moriarty planned to lay his trap.
“Sherlock…”
“Oh, sure, I get it,” Pink Hair nodded dubiously then brightened. “Can I hold him?”
Dupin shrugged again as he waited for John to walk around the car to his side, “As I said, just an observation. Now, the escargot…”
“That and the part where I get to put some real pieces of shit in prison. That’s fun too.”
As soon as Heathcliff danced out of Mycroft’s arm’s reach, he stopped looking frightened. In fact, he looked amused. “Answer to you?” he crowed. “That’s all? That’s all the punishment you’re going to dole out? Not going to tell Mummy or Daddy? You really do resent all the attention William receives, don’t you? I wouldn’t know, I don’t have to deal with sibling rivalry, being an only child and all. Unless…” something… dark… flickered across Heathcliff’s face. “You were hoping you would become an only child once more and that’s the real reason why you’re cross with me. That I didn’t finish the job once I had my fun.”
“He rang you on a mobile definitely connected to the disappearance of former Metropolitan Police Sergeant Sally Donovan. The mobile had your number in its list of contacts. I’d think very carefully about your next move,
“Oh,” Mary breathed, realizing John had entrusted her with a major secret about his best friend. “No,” she said, putting her fingers to his lips. “Don’t say anything more. That’s his story to tell. But thank you for trusting me to keep it a secret and helping me understand Sherlock a little better.” She kissed him almost reverently. “I love you, John Watson.”
The joy fizzling out of his victory, John plodded out of the office buildings. He was in the process of texting Mary the good news when a silky voice whispered, “Congratulations, doctor.”
Maybe they wouldn’t have become a couple, but they probably would have become friends. They could have reminded each other that they were young and beautiful and their entire future was still ahead of them and not yet etched in stone like names and dates on a gravestone.
“Follow me,” Vibart gestured with his beer bottle.
“Yes, I know you can, I’ve been trying to tell you for yea-”
Standing there in nothing but a dirty white camisole, soaking wet jeans and scuffed-up boots with a gun tucked into her waistband, Irene laughed. She tossed the jumper at Violet, “Here, you need it more than I do. Go on, take your wet shirt off and put mine on at once. It’s not as soggy as your things and people are coming towards us. I’m sure we can sweet-talk someone into surrendering a coat or a blanket.” Irene turned to point out the wave of people flooding the one road leading out to Saint-Mont-Michel, the road that could flood if the tides rose high enough. “Plus, I’m sure there’s at least one doctor or nurse in that crowd.”

“Out.”
“Are you alright?” Violet asked as she slid into the pew next to Mary. When she nodded, Violet hissed, “Pardon my language but where
Then she dropped the cool box and let loose an ear-piercing scream.
Camden Town
Sherlock’s eyes moved back down to the floor, seeing black scuff marks.
So, he started looking for Sherlock, looking for his curly black head above the crowd.
But the bullet that penetrated Sherlock didn’t perforate him. Luckily, he had fallen onto his back, the bullet within him acting like cork, keeping the blood inside.
“What’s going on?” Molly paled, the teapot lid starting to rattle as she clutched it.
“Mm,” Sherlock now put his hands behind his back.
She felt a pat on her shoulder, then another one, as if to say
“My… fears? What fears?” John snarled.
Sherlock, Trager, Chibs and Green had driven the delivery van inside the fire stations exactly ten minutes ago.
stop calling me that. It makes me think of your mother.”
Honestly, the girl never shut up.
“Oh of course they weren’t going to
“How is he?” Mary could barely get the words out as she reached up to clutch Molly’s hand.
“Oh please, can you possibly imagine John’s reaction if I tried to kiss him?”
Lisbeth had a few superficial cuts on her cheek and chin but her nose dribbled blood. “Oh damn,” she touched her nostril. “My nose ring!” she wailed.”It got ripped off in the crash.”
And a pity Sherlock got a hold of him first.
“Help me?” Harry cackled. “Why do I need help?”
“Not uncomfortable,” John muttered. “The whole ‘Today’s the Day You Say You’re Gay to Your Dad’ speech you gave to Victor,
“You better,” she snapped then walked quickly to catch up to his brother.
“Who is with her?”
“Hold it against you? My dear. That is an incredible asset. You know the pitfalls of fame and celebrity first hand. You,” he pointed his fat finger at her again. “Know how to keep a secret.”
Neither Greg nor Molly knew how to waltz, but it didn’t matter. They moved clumsily around the dance floor, laughing, eyes only for each other.
“Violet?” Sherlock’s voice was hushed, small and frightened. Like a child’s.
… maybe he’d just let Violet repeat the tale to him. Sherlock doubted he could repeat the story.
But oh, how it robbed you of logic, of reason. How the mind literally shut down as the body took over. How sex caused people to do the stupidest things.
Once he heard the shower running, Sherlock laced his fingers across his chest and studied the ceiling. Wondered why how he, a highly intelligent and mature (well,
“You didn’t fail in your research. You wouldn’t have found him. But I am getting ahead of myself. His Christian name was Matthew. I called him Ford.”
5:52 PM Central Standard Time
As soon as Moriarty disappeared down the stairwell, the clock on Violet’s check stopped counting down and started flashing
“Living room,” Violet said. “I’m letting him get used to the service dog vest.”
The officiant gestured towards John. He smiled at Molly, lifted her veil, kissed her cheek, took her hand then placed it into Lestrade’s. John then walked around the bride and groom to stand next to Lestrade’s brother.
Gladstone slept in the large, bottom cage. The cage’s door hung wide open, but Gladstone wasn’t going anywhere. Clearly sedated, the dog’s head rested limply on his massive paws. A huge, white bandage wrapped around his shoulders, forechest and withers. Part of his fur was shaved away on his right front leg where the IV catheter had been inserted before surgery to anesthetize him.
Violet suspected Rucastle and Mrs. Toller were the only ones with keys.
“Fine,” Violet gave in. “But you’re not doing shit until you see the doctor and get better.”
“I’m a nurse,” Mary pointed down again at Marion’s feet. “I recognize diabetic socks.”
Sherlock thought a moment. His meeting with Mycroft tomorrow should only eat up approximately an hour of his time so… “One-thirty. Text me where you’d like to meet.”
“What the blazing hell is The Moriarty Code!” John burst out. “Dear God, I thought Moriarty was dead and buried; the both of them. Are you telling me they are still haunting us?”
“But the DI and the ginger are your friends, aren’t they? And you’d never want them to suffer as you have; the loss of a child and all.”
“Understood,” Sherlock set his own cup down and leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers. “We are beset by enemies, Brother Dearest.”
They had both had their share of extremely close shaves during their brief time together, starting from the very first night they had met, from bombs to being pursued by Moriarty’s thugs to being pursued by Mycroft and MI-6 to near drowning in the Thames to suffering from hypothermia afterwards.
Where are we going with this?
Mary looked at Violet and nodded.
“There is a perfectly sound and logical reason why I made the decision to-”
“You… you fancy boys, err, men, then right?”
Eventually he heard Mary come upstairs. He listened to the tap running, the sound of bristles on teeth, water splashing onto Mary’s face, the toilet flushing, then the tap running again. The bathroom door opened then closed. He then heard the soft whisper of clothes being removed and pyjamas put on. He wished he felt like having sex. Normally a nice roll in the hay would be a welcome distraction. But he just wanted his mind to stop racing so he could get some rest.
“You’ve been dating for less than two months and you believed him? If you two were close enough to discuss marriage, did he disclose his raging cocaine habit? Really, you should be grateful that you dodged a bullet.”
“So, once Miss Smith was in my employment, Mr. Holmes entered my life. And all I needed to do was to distract the Great Detective so they could set up the hits on the women in his life. The
“You just
Just as she reached the lift doors, they slid open. “Hi!” Molly automatically rearranged her face into one of her brilliant, stretched-out smiles as she saw Violet, Mrs. Hudson and a white-haired lady she didn’t know. “I was on my way down to meet you.”
“Oh, that’s wonderful, Mrs. Fraser, good for you! Don’t worry about it. I’m sure Madison next door can keep an eye on Atticus and Clementine.”
Molly shook her head and pulled her rainbow-hued cardigan tightly around her, trying to hide a spit-up stain on her blouse. “It’s not a gas leak, but I don’t know what happened. I don’t,” she added emphatically when Mary’s cornflower blue eyes narrowed. “Greg can’t tell me everything that goes on with his job. He’s not allowed, not in an ongoing investigation.”
voice.
She was also irritated that while the prepaid mobile that she had tucked inside her boot had been returned to her, one of Mycroft’s minions had confiscated her emergency Visa pre-paid cash card and her switch-blade knife. The mobile had been returned to her because it was essentially useless. Someone had taken the battery out.
Sherlock grinned a little. “She may be clever but she’s not as clever as
“On the contrary,” Dupin had hooked his arm out, “It would be an honor and a pleasure to have you as my guest. I am actually a big fan. I used to follow you Twitter. “TheWhipHand” was your handle, was it not?”
“What about your education?” John asked as Honoré pressed a long rectangle of clean cotton wool over the cut. Recalling the rigors of his own medical training, he asked, “How on earth are you keeping up on your studies while babysitting him?”
“I thought,” he coughed miserably “You liked mentoring young children.”
Unlike the assassin sent to the Lestrades’, this hired gun knew who his target was and who her sons were. This was a high risk hit and it wouldn’t do to be caught. He had thoroughly done his research. He knew there would be high surveillance around this pretty red brick house, but he had also been told the agents assigned to this house would be called to a fake emergency. He also didn’t bank on that information. He had followed-up and been reassured that yes, those agents were no longer at the Holmes’ residence.  He had also followed-up with the MI-6 mole and confirmed that yes the video surveillance around the Holmes’ residence would be disabled.
She looked around her meager bedsit. Neat stacks of cardboard boxes lined the walls.
He’d rather stayed in with his books and his cold tea… especially since Victor hadn’t talked to him all evening.
But, the experiment had worked. Heathcliff never bothered Sherlock again.
Last night he had bitten Sherlock’s head off, telling him that he was tired and hurting so he was going to take another pain pill and
After Violet inadvertently revealed Sherlock’s childhood trauma, John realized another running theme with most of these broken kids and he immediately felt disgusted with himself how he had immediately assumed the very worst when he first had clapped eyes on them.
“Stick to the plan and everything will be fine,” Sherlock promised them all in a low voice. “We’ll be out of here by tomorrow evening at the very latest.”
“Thank you,” the Professor pocketed it inside his suit jacket. “Well, I’m off. Actions speak louder than words. If you two are sensible and wish for a long, easy life with both your daughters, do nothing. Stay home. Watch a DVD, cuddle on the sofa. If you want a short, difficult life while losing both little girls in the process, well… you have an hour to get to Gatwick.”
“No, thank you,” Sherlock murmured, studying John’s face and chest. Watching how his eyes moved underneath his eyelids and how his chest moved up and down. The worried crease in-between his eyebrows…
“Ernie’s not stupid, sis,” he snapped, his accent just as thick as hers. “Don’t need to be gourmet to be good. This shit’s fresh, not out of a can. The chicken was still clucking this morning.”
“I’m not sure, the one who advised me claimed to be a subject expert,” she leaned forward and kissed his brow. “Am I forgiven for being a grumpy, insecure bitch?”
The universe is rarely lazy.
he had silently pleaded with Sherlock.
He smirked. “Oh I don’t know. You seemed alright on your own in there.”
“Indeed, quite unfortunate for her… but fortuitous for

“Oh, of course you do.”
She made a mental note to make sure someone came for the animals as well, when this was over. She also hoped no one had hurt Gladstone. She took a cursory look through the crates’ gates but only saw pit bulls, no Alsatians. There wasn’t time to look further.
“Yes, of course.”
“I don’t and I haven’t and mind your head,” Violet sniped back. As Sherlock ducked his head while entering the claustrophobic stairwell, she added, “Mycroft, believe it or not, is not all powerful. He still has supervisors to report to, which determines how much time we may have to operate independently.”
She smiled sweetly, “Maybe if we were in London, you’d get away with it. Like I said though, after November 13
There was a tap on the door, the man who had taken Irene Adler to her prison, the man Moriarty had called “Peters” opened the door. “Sir, he’s here.”
“Mm,” Sherlock’s eyelids finally fell shut. “I remember. ‘We’re your family now. All of us.’”
“Apologies, I will reimburse you for the loss. Double what it was worth,” Sherlock panted. “However, since it was not your primary bike, as you would have never let me use it, I trust you’re not that terribly upset?”

“AHHH! I’M NOT TRYING TO HURT YOU, YOU STUPID MUTT!” Sherlock howled as the dog’s teeth ripped through the fabric. He tried to shake the dog off but the terrier got a solid hold onto his ankle. “
“You heard me just fine, Little Brother,” Then Mycroft’s thin lips crooked up into a thin, cold smile. “I didn’t know you had it in you, to be perfectly honest.
Sherlock gave her the second vial.
Or, better still, watching him play the violin, those long fingers plucking the strings…
“Burn it.”
“Well, that won’t do, since I’m indebted to you for saving my life. And I need you to abuse your position of power as a personal favor to me.”
The cane, of course, had been Part of the Act. John didn’t like how he couldn’t hold onto his gun while using the crutches. He could move so much faster on the crutches than he could gimping along with his old cane.
Lisbeth knew she looked like an idiot, with a wad of tissue still shoved up her nostril, running as if her knickers were on fire.
But Sherlock knew, had always known, Victor would come back to Camden Town.
The Great, Dark Outside.
Sherlock made no comment about the color of the sash, a bright electric blue.
,” John repeated by rote. “Then tomorrow afternoon, after the email queries about your marriage pile up, I post on the blog about Violet Smith Holmes’ triumphant return to London and about the
. He frowned as he reached for a pen.
“Yeah, and from what I can tell, they’re trying to connect the dots, but to what I don’t know. But one of the stolen files was from when you were shot in Magnussen’s penthouse.”
“Why?”
It takes you exactly an hour and ten minutes to properly straighten your hair.
“John…” but Sherlock’s protest was weak.
He never expected that mobile to ring again.
But eventually, his body relaxed and his arms encircled her into a proper hug. Violet felt the beat of his heart slow as she pressed her cheek against his chest. She felt him rest his head against hers. Felt his chest moved as he sighed.
“The princess used pink ink to write The Letter,” Sherlock informed him
Violet’s eyes widened then closed, “That will do it.” She pressed her tingling hand to her forehead. “Everything you gave her about me was probably stolen when she died.”
“And you, miss, I know. Milk and sugar, drat, I’m out of milk. Apologies,” he bowed and took the tea trolley with him.
“Same reason why I didn’t fight back with you when you started hitting and kicking me at the Copper Beaches,” he murmured. “You both needed an outlet for your anger.”

She hoped it would soothe everyone’s rattled nerves if everyone and not just Lisbeth could hear what was going on inside the fire house.
Violet scratched her dog’s head. “We’ve been engaged less than a day and he’s already trying to make me into a housewife,” she complained to Gladstone.
“It is a rather brilliant scheme,” there was a note of admiration in Sherlock’s voice. “But yes, Mary, to answer your original question, the intent tonight was to merely incapacitate Violet in order to set the stage to frame John for Violet’s murder. Rucastle believes he currently has the upper hand. If he thinks differently, he will murder Evie Payne-Ellis and be on the first private plane to South America.” Sherlock snorted and added “Moron,” in his usual derisive manner, “As if anyone could get the upper hand over
“I spent quite a bit of time in America during my Great Hiatus,” Sherlock put the car in gear. “We’ll be fine.”
Sherlock had even run a secret DNA test to confirm it.
John laughed once, silently through his nose. “Sure,” he twisted his wedding band around his ring finger. “I texted Mary on my way here, asking her if she had heard about Harry. She called me immediately, but I didn’t answer. So she texted and told me she had been working all night. Turns out there was some horrible crash, a lorry ran a red light and ran into a double-decker. Five people were killed, a dozen more injured, dreadful, gruesome injuries. Stuff right up your alley,” John made that disturbing silent laugh again. “She said Violet had just told her the news. Apparently, she had gone straight from the crime scene to St. Bart’s to tell her.”
Chibs turned around, his face twisted. “One of the conditions of the patch-over was to go legit. No more weapons, no more drugs. We went through bloody hell going legit.”
She still didn’t have many friends yet, but had recently joined a book club and most of the women were quite friendly. She also joined the Cottage Garden Society on a whim so she could learn what was best to plant in her vast gardens. She became active at St. Mary Star of the Sea church, but she always begged off whenever she was asked to teach a catechism class.
Greg instinctively reached out for his wife but only felt rumpled sheets and a cold pillow.
“Oh God,” John’s voice swelled with panic. “Oh God, Sherlock, we have to go. We have to go get them now.
“Only if that is put in writing; you’ll forgive me if I don’t trust your word.”
11 August 2015
Sherlock arched an eyebrow and put his hands behind his back. “If you insist,” he demurred.
“That’s what he told your mother, yes.”
“Her silly profiles, of course. You think she didn’t create one for you?”
“Didn’t the Met send  all the authorization paperwork to your office?” John asked, hoping Gagnon wouldn’t notice his little fib. After all, Sherlock, Mary and Violet always pointed out what a shockingly bad liar he was.
“Don’t be silly. We’re celebrating. Your engagement,” he winked. “And your new job.”
John didn’t care what Mycroft had told him… everyone knew what
Where he had disappeared to, no one could say, or would. John, Mary and Violet all heavily suspected Sherlock had assisted Mitton out of London.
“What?” Victor sprang to his feet, tears pricking his eyes. “No… he wouldn’t.”
“How are things?”
“I’ll punch you in the face.”
”, Gladstone’s kill command, sat heavily on the tip of her tongue. All she had to do was say the word and let go of the leash. Gladstone would take care of the rest.
“You positive?” John squinted at the image of the woman. She wore skin tight jeans, black knee boots, a short black jacket with the hood over her head, shielding her face, of course.
Violet opened her mouth to answer but Sherlock steamrolled over her, in full force now, “Being coerced into suicide, of course. An outbreak of serial suicides breaking out in London would do the trick, terrify the populace into submission, because what can be more frightening than to be talked into killing yourself? I should know,” his face darkened for a moment. Then he blinked and carried on in his usual detached manner. “But who could carry out such a task? Not Moriarty, he wouldn’t put his neck out there. So he goes and does his research and finds Jeff Hope, a desperate man, a dying man. A man who wants to ensure the financial security of his children before the aneurysm snuffs him out like a candle. That is a man willing do to
Text SH and John anyway, let them know what’s going on.
“Um,” John struggled to get the meeting back on track before the brothers ended up in another row. Going for his best ‘Dr. Watson’ tone, he asked “What information are we looking for then?”
“Nothing to worry about,” John spluttered as the pilot shut the cockpit door again. “OK, even I can tell he’s a fucking liar.” In a lower voice, John asked, “What did you see? You saw something out the window,” John pointed at the oval window with a shaking finger, “Before we started going down.”
“I didn’t think so,” she told Mary in a shaking voice. “Until The Letter went missing and I had no idea what that Letter contained until Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson came to my house today. When Mr. Holmes started calling me names and blaming me for creating an international incident, I was terrified he would blurt out one of his famous deductions, that he somehow figured out I was being blackmailed just by looking at me. So I became… quite cross with him.”
“You really didn’t know?”
Violet thrust the page back at Sherlock. He rolled all the pages up and tucked it inside his leather jacket. He snatched Lisbeth’s rucksack and hoisted onto his own thin back. Lisbeth scooped up the laptop bag and Violet grabbed two of the remaining laptops and followed Sherlock and Lisbeth out.
Sherlock shoved his mobile back into his coat pocket and rubbed his temple, feeling a headache come on. Then he looked up and saw a nondescript, tan sedan parked crisscross from the Watsons.
“They don’t hurt,” he reassured her as he rested on his forearms, hovering over her. Lying on her, but not putting his full weight on her.
.” His eyes softened, the blue becoming the dominant color. “Please tell me you understand John.”
Both Violet and Mary peeped through the drapes to watch Lady Hilda get into her Volvo and drive away, “The only problem,” Mary watched the taillights of the Volvo disappear down the street, “Is that if we saw her waiting for John here…”
Saturday morning
Mary took one revolted look at the gutted cat, then went to find to Violet.
“We didn’t land in
The chair itself was positioned very close to a drain.
“Start by staying safe for a few more weeks, Mitton,” Violet had turned around in the front seat, kneeling now so she could face him.
“She loves her children more,” Violet quoted Sherlock verbatim.
“Because I’ll deliver the two things he wants most right now. Tonight.”
“Dr. Watson, this is one of Sherlock’s old friends from university,” Violet introduced Victor to John tonelessly.
Only those crates didn’t hold gallons of milk.
“No… just working on my music then going to… to bed,” Sherlock flushed as he stumbled over his words.
“Come, you’re freezing to death,” Dupin gestured again towards his battered car. “Ratiocinate; to use ratiocination. It is reasoned train of thought. Reasoning that is precise, exact and logical. This investigative process, which I have created, is based upon obtaining hard, scientific data in order to create a logical conclusion while at the same time, not ignoring the infinite possibilities available despite the absence of data.”
a part of your life any longer.”
This time, John had better bearings and easily shook off the security guard. “I’m a doctor, let me go,” he gave the guard a hard shove for good measure. “Get me a first aid kit,” he yelled. When the security guard dithered, John bellowed, “NOW!”
En route to Musée du Louvre
Irene took it and let herself be helped up. “Thanks.” She tried to wipe the blood and bits of brain off of her face. “Where’s Jim? Are he and Sherl-”
