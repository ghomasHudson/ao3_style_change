A huge pike glided lazily towards him and Lucifer perked up. It was bigger than both of his brothers’.
and he would have to carry on as though nothing had happened, as though Castiel hadn’t just poured his heart out to him, fully expecting Dean to reject him.
Dean tore away from him with a wide-eyed look and he once again shifted his gaze to the distant horizon, as though… as though…
“I love you so much,” Castiel whispered, the words tumbling from his lips without him telling them to. An invisible weight lifted from his chest and suddenly, he could breathe. Everything felt
A curiously tiny smile tugged at Novak’s lips before it vanished and he graciously bowed his head. “You’re absolutely right, Mr. Winchester. My deepest apologies. You have every right to be offended by my earlier statements and I can only express my sincerest regrets and hope that you can forgive me. We both deserve a fair, clean race after how far we’ve already come.”
They eventually came to a meadow rife with long, sun-kissed grasses and vibrant wildflowers. The air smelled sweet like honeysuckle and buttercups, and a few bees were already hard at work, jumping from one flower to the next.
Benny tilted his head and sniffed the air curiously. “I don’t smell anything wrong. Other than those Novak alphas,” he huffed.
Lucifer snorted. “Doesn’t look like a joke. Is that why they let you join the pack? Do you lift your tail for every alpha that looks at you?” He glanced at Sam, unimpressed and returned his gaze to Gabriel. “You bottom for your omega too?”
Dean stared at the paper for a long time. There was to be an investigation into their relationship, which he had expected. There was a mention of the election being fixed, which he had also expected. What he had not expected, was for half the article to be about
Castiel crashed his wings into the sides of Bartholomew’s head again and they wrestled fiercely for a few moments before Castiel sunk his teeth into one of his ex’s wings.
Castiel pulled a face and tried not to think too hard about his two best friends going at it in one of the consultation rooms. He slid behind Dean and snaked his arms around his middle as he rested his head on his shoulder, watching as Dean prepared the waffle batter. Dean gave a warm smile and kissed his cheek before continuing beating the eggs.
“Honestly, I don’t care if you act like the perfect gentleman or do everything you can to ruin this party, but please, I’m
“If that’s the way you feel, you’re quite welcome to return home and leave Raphael and I to enjoy our break,” Michael commented; his white fur shining brilliantly under the sunlight.
“Never,” Castiel nearly growled and Dean found himself leaning a tad closer, needing to see every irritated twitch of Castiel’s jaw, every furious flare of his nostrils.
After a week had passed, Castiel’s patience had worn itself thin and he could no longer choke down the urge to see the man he had sacrificed everything for. He had planned on giving Dean time to come to terms with everything that had happened; everything that had been
In the corner of the room stood Lucifer; arms crossed and disapproving scowl etched onto his features.
“I was dead,” Castiel said slowly, thoughtfully, because that was a good question. “And now I’m not.”
Dean knew that he was sulking. Conveniently, he didn’t care. “I wasn’t trying to sleep with him! I was flirting with him because
“It’ll take some time for me to believe you,” Castiel said after a little while. “And if that bothers you, tell me and we can end this before either of us gets too involved.”
“I’m not sure,” Castiel sighed again. “Between the build-up to election day and the investigation into my relationship with Mr. Winchester
Dean slipped into the room again with a towel and froze upon seeing Castiel’s wide eyes and panicked expression.
Whilst what he had said technically wasn’t a lie, he was also profoundly aware of the fact that most of his pack was comprised of loveable idiots.
Lucifer hated the whole plan, but it became clear that he had no intention of straying from his brothers’ sides and although he had complained the entire journey out of the city, he had stuck by his brothers no matter where they dragged him. It was almost as though he couldn’t stand the thought of losing them.
Castiel shook his head. “Every human here had to be sent into a time loop because there was nowhere else to put them whilst we fixed heaven. Jack devised a program that would send them to their happiest moments and allow them to relive them over and over.” Castiel clenched his fists angrily. “Except the program was thrown together hastily by the two of us and apparently, it has a few glitches. If we had known that your program had a fault, I would have intervened a lot sooner." He gazed at Dean sorrowfully.
house. The house given to him by his grandfather – the only family member to have accepted his confession with a smile and an offer of a freshly-baked cookie.
He turned to the rebar slowly and stalked towards it. He smoothed his fingers over its tetanus-riddled surface before gripping it tightly and snapping it clean off the post. Then, he squeezed and it turned to dust beneath his palm.
Sam shrugged as he stood. “Hey, I get it. Must be tough with all the crosses and crucifixes hanging around. But… there might be some good food on? Could be fun?”
Finally, Sam sighed. “You have nothing to be sorry for, Gabe. It just bothers me that they can control you like this merely by being here. I don’t like you being so nervous of them.”
Dean made a soft noise of surprise at the foreign sensation and Castiel took the opportunity to steal his mouth as he wrapped an arm around the wolf’s back. Another growl made its way out of Dean’s chest and he kissed Castiel harder as the vampire claimed every inch of his mouth.
Adam swallowed thickly and bounded after the timber wolves. When they heard him, they turned sharply and snarled at him, ready to attack. He stood still; tail tucked between his legs to show that he wasn’t a threat.
Raphael didn’t know what Gabriel saw in that lumbering beast of an omega. There was nothing delicate about him; nothing pretty or inviting. Sam was all bulk and no finesse and he thought nothing of throwing Michael around like a rag doll. Omegas like that needed to be reminded who the boss was – they needed to be tamed and shaped into respectable mates.
Sam stared at his knees for a moment before shaking his head slowly. “There… was an incident at my brother’s garage a few years ago. I didn’t see it, but it nearly ended with a customer having her brain skewered by a hungry wraith.” He lifted his gaze to meet Castiel’s. “My brother fought him off, but the customer… uh… she saw his canine form and… well…”
“I loved you!” Castiel shouted desperately. “I loved you and you started a family with someone else and
Castiel refused to meet his gaze as he nodded, ashamed. “It took us far too long to figure out that something was amiss because we were so busy with heaven and the angels that Jack rescued from the Empty.”
Michael tossed the peas onto the floor and stood with a warning growl as he fixed his brother with a glower. “I’ve always been better than you. When was the last time you beat me at anything?”
we haven’t done this before?” he asked, puzzled, because the bunker, the rune, Billie slamming her fists against the door, Cas pouring his heart out… every bit was
Lucifer nodded solemnly. “In the hopes that he and his friend – Ben Braeden – will grant me the honour of becoming my new friends.”
Zachariah emphasises with a withering look and it takes every bit of Dean’s willpower to bow his head to the angel, as is expected of him.
Dean’s head fell against the wheel as he tried to forget the way Cas had smiled before The Empty took him. He had never seen Cas smile like that before – as though a great burden had been lifted from his shoulders; as though merely confessing those three words to Dean had brought him a sense of peace that he had never quite been able to achieve.
that felt. He tightened his grip instinctively and blew out a long, silent breath when Castiel practically melted against him. They came to their third pause of the evening and Dean wasn’t certain if they were playing a game or not anymore.
“Gabriel, enough,” snapped Castiel as Sam glanced between them, perplexed. “This isn’t appropriate work conversation.”
that occurred when Dean’s head fell into his hands. He stamped a frustrated foot and pressed his palms into his eyes, hoping that the dull ache would distract him from the throbbing in his chest, but when it didn’t, he slumped back against the couch and fought against the urge to call Benny or Sam.
The vampire shook his head and loaded more prawns onto his plate. “Wolfsbane. Mother grates the petals over the top of the cake to give colour. Vampires are immune to its toxins.”
“You knew the person Lucifer forced me to be,” Castiel hissed, stalking towards Balthazar. “I was quiet and reserved and subdued because Lucifer made me that way! Dean has freed me! I no longer have to be afraid of having cigarettes stubbed out on my skin if I so much as smile on camera! I no longer have to walk up the driveway and wonder if I’ll be greeted with a belt across my back! Dean is my salvation!”
“Oh, come on, Cas. We fought too,” sighed Gabriel. “I’ve lost count of the number of times we scrapped and shoved at each other. We argued plenty as kids and adults, sometimes with our fists.”
He pushed through the door and strode towards the pigeon holes that housed the file for his next appointment.
Castiel said nothing as he turned on his heel and made his way towards the living room. It hurt to turn his back on Dean when the werewolf was offering him what he wanted, but it was better for both of them if they remained friends.
From across the camp, Gabriel flashed Dean a devilish smirk and Dean groaned under his breath as the golden alpha trotted towards him, Sam biting back laughter by his side.
Predictably, Gabriel beamed with excitement. “Count us in!” he exclaimed, throwing an arm around Castiel once more. “Right, Cassie?”
Jack snarled as he snapped at the doe’s belly and when she kicked out at him, he wrapped his jaws around her hock and dragged her leg backwards. She grunted as she stumbled and she scrambled to her hooves frantically, but Jack rounded her other side and clamped his teeth around her neck.
He shook his head and managed to meet Sam’s gaze. “You know what? That pain’s not gonna go away. Right?”
Michael flitted his gaze around in a futile search for something that would help his brother, only for ice to settle in his veins when he realised that Lucifer was no longer clinging to the rock. He leaped off Raphael and looked around in terror, hoping to catch a glimpse of dirty blond fur. He spotted something floating at least forty metres downriver and he inhaled sharply as it rammed into another rock before sinking below the water with little resistance.
“No one has ever spoken of me like that,” Castiel interrupted. “You barely know me. I barely know you. How can you have formed that sort of opinion of me in only one month?”
Sam continued with a scowl. “I noticed his lip was busted. Looked pretty fresh. And I can see you’ve got a cut on your cheek and a bruise on your throat, which are both new. Now, I’m not sure if you’re telling the truth about the glass, but my guess is you and Dean got into some sort of fight.”
“I do want you,” Castiel protested. “I thought I made that quite clear at the ball. You’re the one who left me.”
Castiel and Dean had never ripped themselves away from each other so quickly. They cast their wide gazes to Jack as they fought to catch their breath and willed their rather prominent erections to wilt. They sat down in unison and made a poor effort of hiding their shame.
“This!” Castiel shouted, gesturing frantically between them both. “Us! Whatever’s happening here!” He ran a fevered hand through his hair. “I know I shouldn’t trust you, but I do. I shouldn’t find it so easy to just… talk to you. I shouldn’t
Castiel tilted his head. “You don’t need me to come for you to have a good time, Sam. If you want to go, go.”
Jack would die in tremendous pain and Chuck would return to his rightful place. It was a wonderful thought; Castiel and the Winchesters would be so
…So then, why had Lucifer just been attacked by a wolf in the middle of Walmart? Was the beta just savage or were people really so repulsed by him that they were willing to revert to baser instincts and claw him to death? Surely, he couldn’t be
“Then why did Balthazar and Hannah rescue a fox cub in their old pack? Why didn’t they just kill it and eat it?” Alex scowled.
Castiel would chuckle quietly and rock back against Dean until the Republican was buried inside him up to the hilt, and he would tell Dean that he was wrong and that the Democratic Party was clearly going to win. Dean would grin and hold him tighter, protectively, and brush a thumb over the head of his leaking erection. Castiel would moan and whine as Dean’s hips slapped against his ass and they would argue and debate their policies in between wet, open-mouthed kisses as they fought against their impending climaxes. Neither of them would want to come first; both attempting to prove their own superiority and right to the Presidency in their intense competition, yet they would cling to each other with obvious desperation and passion.
They bounded onto the drive, heading towards the small graveyard and faster than they could register, there were bright lights in their eyes and the rumble of an engine far too close to their ears. They turned to the right with wide eyes and came face-to-face with a large, black Ford that had been masked by the darkness surrounding it.
Mary smacked his arm playfully. “What about that time both of us pretended to be in an open relationship with Jocelyn McKinnon? Do you remember her grandmother’s face? That was such a great weekend!”
Dean’s breath momentarily hitched before evening out again and Castiel bit back another smirk when the other occupants of the table began to glower between pieces of conversation.
Michael and Lucifer slowed to a stop as they watched their younger brother lower himself to the ground and prowl towards the small creature. When he came within six metres of the doe, she pricked her ears up and stared right at him. With the grass being only a few inches high, it wasn’t hard to miss his black and coffee-coloured fur.
Adam bit back a laugh as the pups nodded in solemn understanding. “Jody’s like that,” agreed Alex. “She worries about
Dean chuckled sinfully and rumbled beside his mate’s ear as he held Cas a little tighter. “Only if his omega can prove he’s worthy of the honour. Only if he can beat his alpha in a scuffle. If not… he has to present his gorgeous ass to his alpha for punishment.”
His mind wandered to Castiel. The deal had been that if Dean lost, he would resign and take Castiel out to dinner, but there had been no plan for their budding relationship if Dean
Cas sunk to the ground with a hum of approval and Dean lay on top of him possessively as he began to mark the omega with his scent.
“Bet you’re fun at parties,” Dean said drily before plastering on a smile when the creature turned to glower at him. “Look, we can get out of your hair and then you can get back to sleeping, how does that sound? If you could just open a door for us…”
Suddenly, Lucifer’s lips curled in disgust and he sneered at his younger brother from the opposite side of the camp. “From respected Novak alpha to Winchester pack slut… how the mighty have fallen.”
Dean slid his arms around Castiel’s waist, blocking the angel’s view of the Empty. He ignored Billie’s attempts to break the door down and he smiled at Cas.
Balthazar watched them with a contented smile, carding his fingers through silky hair and over rolling expanses of skin. He teased at nipples and squeezed breasts and scraped his nails lightly over stomachs and chests until they began to rock against each other, desperate for more, and then he squeezed ass cheeks and sucked passionate bruises into shoulders, encouraging his lovers to claim one another.
“Screwing me,” Dean responded jovially. “Man, you should have seen it. He had me spread over this coffin, ass up, hand around my neck as he pistoned his gigantic-”
"No, I’m all right,” he said, even though he couldn’t feel his tail. Touching Dean like that would only lead to trouble.
. That was… That made something unusual happen in his chest. He swallowed down the fluttery feeling and raised an eyebrow. “You may.”
“Hey, you’re the one asking the pack leader to knot you,” Lucifer scoffed, rolling his eyes. “If you want me to respect you, maybe don’t act like an omega whore.”
“Well, you look like a shifter and smell like a shifter. You know what they say – if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck…” Balthazar hummed.
Two weeks into Sam’s residency, on Wednesday morning at seven a.m., Castiel found himself glaring at the office door. The room was empty this early, but it would appear that it would remain that way for some time since Castiel couldn’t enter it either. It seemed as though someone had been a little overzealous with the Christmas decorations last night.
Castiel’s eyebrows rose to his hairline but his feet moved towards the door and he found himself trotting down the stairs, unwilling to wait for the lift to trundle its way to the top floor.
Surprise filtered over Lucifer and Raphael’s faces and they edged towards their older brother as a quiet whine slipped out of Michael’s throat. He lay down, hoping to ease his thrashing stomach.
“Any one of us could have saved you if you had just told us!” Balthazar snarled, leaping to his feet and jabbing an accusing finger in Castiel’s direction. “This person you’ve become… it’s not the man I know!”
and Dean glanced through his mirror at Cas. “No!” he snapped. “No, wipe that smile off your face! It’s not…” From the corner of his eye, he caught sight of the black tendril. “I don’t love you!” he said desperately. “It’s not like that!”
Somewhere behind Dean, Sam released a threatening snarl, but Dean shook his head and huffed at his brother reassuringly. “’S alright. He doesn’t understand.”
“It is,” Dean said firmly. “You’re way out of my league and you deserve far more than anything your nest has ever given you. You deserve someone who’s there for you when you need them; someone who won’t toss you aside like garbage. You deserve someone who goes out of their way to take care of you; someone who tells you how much they want you, how much they want to be with you. You deserve someone who makes you smile and laugh; someone who protects you and holds you when you need it.”
Balthazar whined softly in approval as Gadreel licked a slow, erotic stipe up his throat. “We should definitely take this inside,” whispered Balthazar. “I’m three seconds away from deep-throating your knot.”
Gabriel’s ears fell and he appeared to struggle hearing some of the hardships that Castiel had faced. Eventually, he frowned.
“Metatron,” the man said, hand outstretched. “You’re Castiel Novak, right? Your parents have told me so much about you. It’s such a pity we didn’t get to meet last night.”
Dean nodded and Michael frowned at his paws thoughtfully. “And no one will chase them out of the pack? Or disown them? Or… abuse them for it?”
Lucifer looked at everything that wasn’t his brothers and after a few moments, Michael tilted his head. “Are you… embarrassed?”
“I guess I’d be sad about the loss, but I wouldn’t mind if it’s you who I’m losing to,” explained Dean. “After all, I’d have voted for you if I wasn’t running myself.”
“At ten o’clock, we shall start the hunt. This year’s hunt will pay respect to those we have lost in great tragedy. We shall pay homage to the ancestors who have passed in wars against these very beasts. We shall remember the family we have lost recently to such cowards. I am, of course, referring to our oldest and filthiest of enemies…” Chuck spared Dean a dark glance. “Werewolves.”
They came almost in unison and Dean immediately hid his face in Castiel’s neck, embarrassed by his sticky underwear and the way he had whined Cas’ name. Castiel stroked his hair tenderly.
Castiel rolled his eyes. “He kept breaking the program. We created a house for him instead – the only human currently in heaven.”
Michael and Raphael had both managed to catch a fish and the only thing he had managed to do was nearly drown. The icing on the cake was Michael had warned him that he would fall into the river and Lucifer had proceeded to do exactly that. Being the screwup that he was, he once again had to rely on his big brother to prove that he was the better alpha of the two of them by saving his life. His parents had always told him to be more like Michael and honestly, Lucifer understood why.
He didn’t budge from his spot on the carpet, so Dean attacked and claimed his mouth hard and merciless, and Castiel clutched his shirt and nipped at his lips possessively.
Sam’s eyes bulged and Castiel elbowed the dragon reproachfully before flicking a soothing gaze to Sam. “He won’t harm you. He’s just an ass.”
“Well done,” he smiled at the pup before nudging her shoulder. The old rabbit kicked out at his nose and he jerked backwards as the grumpy buck ambled towards a burrow entrance.
Samandriel shrugged. “Not really. A lot of prey animals seem to cope with us in human form. Some even quite like being with humans. They get fed and watered and exercised and they never have to worry about predators. Some are really happy being pets, like that old buck.” He smiled. “And pets can be a lot of fun. You can play with them and cuddle with them and they can be your best friend. Our neighbours had a cat and I used to play with her all the time. She was awesome.”
He was dead because of Dean – because he had seen no other way to save the human he was in love with.
John and Mary surged towards the few vampires about to sink their teeth into Dean and finally, Castiel gathered his wits enough to shift into his bipedal form. His teeth extended once more and he grabbed his father’s arm before it managed to claw Dean’s eye out and sunk his teeth into the soft flesh.
“Damn it, Cas!” Dean snapped. “I’m worried about you! You’ve been off with me since we began, you’ve accused me of things you know aren’t true, and now I find that after you begged me to help you escape, you went back to your abusive boyfriend! Don’t I deserve an explanation? Everyone in that audience thinks I’m a dick, but I don’t care because I’m more concerned about you! Don’t you understand that? I’m willing to lose every vote I have if it means making sure you’re okay!”
him, but the werewolf quickly reached out to him and Castiel crawled up the bed and fell heavily into his arms.
he break Castiel and have the audacity to try to worm his way back into his life so many years later! Cas deserved so much more. He deserved love and laughter and someone who would lavish him with affection, not a man who lied and cheated on him and left him to suffer.
“Um… Jack, is it?” At Jack’s nod, Adam continued, “My name’s Adam. I’ll uh… I’ll take you to the rest of the pack and you can talk to our leader.” Dean would know what to do.
Sam nodded with a half-hearted smile and Castiel leaned against the table with a frown. “Don’t let her get to you. Some clients get difficult about money. If I had a dollar for every client whom had told me I’m ‘in it for the money’ and I ‘don’t care about animals’, I’d be sipping mojitos on a yacht somewhere in the Mediterranean.”
Castiel looked uncertain, so Dean pushed back against him and bit back a grimace at the burning sensation. It felt as though he had taken a rectal dose of chilli peppers.
The trees and shrubs grew sparser as the sound of roaring water reached their ears and they came to a fast-flowing river that stretched into the horizon, blocking their path. Beyond the river lay a continuation of the dense forest.
Jack lowered his gaze, tail tucked between his legs and ears flat. Pleased that he had warned the omega enough of the consequences of betraying his pack, Dean lifted his chin.
Castiel blinked for a few moments before nodding slowly. “That’s a terrible idea,” he said solemnly. “My parents would absolutely hate that I was dating my own resident.”
my pup.” He missed Sam and Castiel’s shared grins and held his head a little higher as he poured purpose into his stride. He had to make this new wolf respect him, after all.
“Hey, that’s not so bad,” Dean says suddenly and Sam lifts his head from his phone as Dean grins at him. “I’m working in the kitchens. Cook, I think.”
“Wasn’t sure what my parents would make of it all,” mumbled Dean as he nosed into the vampire’s hair. “But I promise I’ve been moping around all week, thinking about you. I’ve just been… confused, I guess. Trying to figure it all out.”
Sam clasped his hands together, glancing around the empty office and its many garish Christmas decorations. “I’m not here to harm anyone,” he promised quietly. “I just want to help animals.” He paused for a brief moment. “And… y’know... It would be nice to be able to help my pack the next time one of them gets shot.”
Castiel stared at the side of his face for a few moments, puzzled, before slowly shifting his gaze to the TV.
“What’s wrong, Dean? Case of heartache? Has all this,” he gestured to the ruins around them, “only just settled into that thick skull?” Chuck smirked and advanced on Dean. “You will die, Dean. You and your brother and Jack and everyone else. Your
“I don’t,” Raphael interrupted quickly before bracing for the hit that was sure to follow for cutting off a lead alpha. Then he scowled at himself because things had changed since they had left the family – there was little need for violence between them anymore.
He made his way towards a tall, leafy tree and sat in the shadows of its branches as he watched Dean and Castiel whisper between themselves. He felt like a child on thin ice with his parents, which was ridiculous because he was older than Dean and his own parents had never nipped him on the ear and forced him to apologise to his brothers for
“Afraid so,” hummed Castiel airily. “I’m very much unavailable,” he stated as he squeezed Dean’s arm pointedly.
“Why? Because I’m starting to catch up to your impressive mass of votes?” Dean teased, but Castiel shook his head slowly and met his gaze.
Dean turned to Cas with wide eyes and watched as the angel crumpled to the floor in a heap, seemingly passed out. He made to round on the Shadow, only for the nothingness below his feet to suddenly become something.
Ben nodded enthusiastically. “Even though we’d just had a fight with Azazel’s pack and Dean was injured, he still beat John in their fight; who, it turned out, had led Azazel’s pack to us.”
“We’ll talk later,” Dean said, chest beginning to heave. They weren’t in the clear yet but he could tell by Castiel’s deer-in-headlights expression that the angel wanted to talk
Castiel leaned back in his chair and wondered if Dean was watching. He still hadn’t managed to contact the Republican since he only had his number written in the phone that the police had managed to break. He wondered if Dean missed him as much as he missed Dean. Perhaps he was too busy to think about Castiel; he was going to be president after all. The thought made his heart whine mournfully.
Taking the excuse, Castiel offered Dean some of his pizza as he stole a slice from the werewolf, and Dean made a happy sound that caused Castiel’s chest to grow light and airy.
He frowned and wondered how normal it was for a straight, male acquaintance to wrap an arm around another man whilst watching TV on a bed. He subtly glanced to Dean and raised his eyebrows when he found Dean watching him.
Jack did as he was told, but he seemed to hunch in on himself as though attempting to make himself appear smaller than he actually was. Adam elected to ignore the strange behaviour and decided to change topic.
A startled laugh erupted from Castiel’s throat and he pushed a hand through his already ruffled hair. “The press would have a field day.”
“You looked so beautiful down there with your pretty bow lips around my dick,” Castiel whispered, mouth brushing Dean’s. “I’ve dreamed of seeing you on your knees but, as always, you’ve exceeded my expectations. You’re the most stunning man I’ve ever laid eyes upon.”
Dean fist-pumped the air like a seven-year-old, enticing a begrudging smile out of his rival. When Castiel didn’t unfold his arms, Dean shook his head with a grin and tucked the Democrat into his side again, since they had both seemed to enjoy it earlier and the cold was beginning to seep into his skin. He guided them both along the river as he said, “I’m just fooling around. I know this can’t go anywhere. I just… I like you, man. I shouldn’t, but I do, and I guess I forgot I can’t have you for a moment.”
Dean raised his eyes to meet Castiel’s, daring to hope that the angel had one more trick up his sleeve; that he would save the day just as he had so many times before.
Dean’s eyes widened at the joke and he let out a startled laugh. Trust Cas to come up with a response like that. “Can’t think why.”
Castiel laughed bitterly. “Plus, there’s the house. Anything to get themselves one step closer to taking this place off me.”
Jack continued to scowl at him until eventually sliding off the beta and slumping into a moody heap beside the river. Adam tilted his head, guilt settling in the pit of his stomach. He approached the beta warily.
A moment later, Castiel shoved Dean away, breathless and sweaty and with a definite bulge in his trousers. He stared at Dean hungrily as his chest heaved and Dean nearly pounced on him again to finish the job, but Castiel’s head fell against the door as his eyes fluttered shut, and Dean knew that Castiel planned on leaving soon.
“No, come on. I know that face,” Dean grumbled moodily as he pushed his pie around the flimsy paper plate. “That’s, uh… that’s Sad Sam face.”
“What’s your post-operative care plan for Duke?” Castiel asked as he carefully drilled through the spine.
“I always wondered,” Castiel ploughed on, ignoring Dean once again, “ever since I took that burden, that
was better described as a bank of sorts; one that offered tremendous loans to wealthy people and businesses, whilst charging an impressive amount of interest. Due to the Novak pack’s size, it wasn’t uncommon for some of these loans to be offered in actual people (particularly useful for sprawling companies like Starbucks) and interest was repaid in the form of favours or company shares and profits.
Six months after Sam had died, six months after they’d laid his body on a burning pyre, six months after they had quit hunting for good, Dean found himself scowling at a car that should have been simple to fix but was proving too difficult for his scrambled mind to comprehend.
He allowed his father to climb to his feet and watched as the nest began to retreat. Chuck was the last to leave and before he turned, he grabbed Castiel by the collar and attempted to smash his knuckles into the side of his face, but Dean was quicker and Chuck staggered backwards as a set of giant wolf claws slashed through his cheek.
The four pups nodded before darting away, leaving Jack and Adam to linger alone by the edges of the burrow grounds. Adam lowered himself to the grass.
“Makes things easier if I’m at least physically attracted to the girl,” Dean shrugged. “So… she hot?”
Intrigued by the new thought process, Dean popped his head around the door to find Cas staring forlornly at the wall.
Castiel turned a vicious gaze upon Duma and he marched over to her and grabbed her by her sizzling neck.
It wasn’t when he watched Sam grieve for his dead brother for decades before finally drifting off into an eternal slumber, his son by his side.
Castiel could barely make him out in the dark, but he smiled anyway and rubbed the werewolf’s back as he settled down.
Sam swallowed drily and waited no longer than a minute before the door slammed open and a short man with golden eyes and hair to match bounced into the room with a feral grin.
“You sure you don’t want to do this again?” Dean teased, even though he had been somewhat affected by Castiel’s needy display.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel whispered into his hair. “For making me feel like I’m actually worth something.”
Dira backed off a little and growled at the omega as he approached. “You will not be coming home with us. This is your Alpha now, Jack.” She gestured to Adam before howling at her pack.
“To Andrew, from the corner of Mill’s lane, for providing us with such sweet wine,” Chuck grinned and the room cheered in agreement before tipping their glasses back greedily.
“Of course it makes sense!” Castiel finally snapped, startling everyone. He stalked towards Michael with a sharp glare. “Just because Mother and Father tell you something is wrong, it doesn’t mean that it actually is! In fact, most of what our parents told us is complete crap! They never loved each other – their whole marriage was a farce. They didn’t even love us! The only reason they’re together is so they could pass the Novak name down another generation.” He eyed Michael in distaste.
Castiel nodded and tugged at his sleeves unconsciously. Dean wondered if he was nervous because it was dark and they were alone.
Gabriel and Meg struggled to control one feisty doe and when Crowley jumped on her rump, she kicked him off with an enraged battle cry. He scrambled out of the way when she suddenly spun around and attempted to headbutt him, and Meg and Gabriel retreated when the doe turned her focus to them instead.
Castiel frowned for a moment before the implications set in and he had to smother his excitement. He had been hurt before by getting his hopes up and Dean’s current confused frown wasn’t a great sign. Cas nodded slowly.
Lucifer scrambled backwards, chest heaving and skin pale as he gaped at the snarling wolf determined to maul him. Less than a minute later, the guards had carted the wolf out of the aisle and out of sight and were most likely waiting for the police to arrive.
In the early hours of the fourth of November, it was clear that Dean had won the election by a landslide.
“Wait. Dean, stop. I don’t think…” A quiet groan fell from his lips but Dean slowed and looked at him in query.
Raphael shook his head frantically until both Michael and Lucifer frowned at him. “We can’t,” Raphael whispered. “I never realised how much we were despised. Now we haven’t got the family name to protect us, everyone is desperate to make us suffer, or worse.” He looked down at his own battered body, closing his eyes at the memory of the six alphas cornering him in that alley and beating him bloody. He should have gone to a hospital but honestly, after learning how much everyone hated him, he didn’t trust the hospital staff not to ‘accidentally’ inject him with something.
Sam fished in his pocket for his phone and brought up one of the more sensible pictures of his brother before showing it to Castiel.
“Not if you don’t,” said Dean quietly, brokenly. He looked away and felt like a fool. “Not if you can’t say it.”
Dean quickly adjusted to the new position and seated Castiel more comfortably on his lap. He curled his fingers around Cas’ thigh, stroking and caressing as Castiel gripped his tie and thoroughly wrecked his mouth. Dean broke away to pepper Castiel’s cheek with desperate kisses and when he nipped heatedly at the vampire’s jaw, a soft growl in his throat, Cas freed Dean of his suit jacket and wrapped his fingers around his shoulders. He smoothed his hands along Dean’s arms before sending them back to Dean’s hair and neck.
He pinned Castiel’s thighs against the slippery, tiled wall as water cascaded down their bodies and he teased his tongue over Castiel’s slit and down the thick vein that ran along his shaft. Castiel’s head tipped against the tiles as he panted and Dean rubbed his rival’s balls between his fingers and relished the resulting moan.
“I don’t think it’s becoming of a politician to ridicule someone for their sexuality, Mr. Winchester. I expected better of you. Can we please move onto the next question, Ms. Hoople?”
Jack might have been all-powerful, but The Empty was an entirely separate matter. Not even Jack could reach there, right? Chuck hadn’t been able to.
Castiel really appreciated this affectionate side of Dean. It was unexpected, but Castiel hoped it lasted since there weren’t that many affectionate people in his life.
He splayed a protective hand over the vampire’s stomach and recalled how he had once stated that he would
Uncertainty floods Sam’s being as he paces outside the cigar lounge door. He doesn’t believe that anyone in the royal family actually smokes, but the room has remained from decades past and it appears that it is being used as an area of relaxation now. Gabriel seemed to enjoy spending his evenings in there and he had informed Sam that he would text him when he wished to return to his bedroom.
“Our pack bonds are strong and we work together perfectly well without taking a bite out of our pack mates,” Adam huffed. “And we don’t have stupid rank systems.”
Swallowing thickly, Raphael shook his head and carefully settled against Michael’s shoulder once more, scenting at his brother as subtly as he could manage.
He recoiled a second later with a scrunched nose and he spat out a stream of water before staring into the river once more. He submerged his head again and returned with a frustrated huff, paws slipping a little on the rocks.
“Mom, dad… this is Cas,” Sam said and something in his tone made Castiel straighten, hoping he looked unthreatening.
. “When I experienced a moment of true happiness, the Empty would be summoned and it would take me, forever.”
“Lazy old mutt,” Adam muttered to himself as he clambered to his paws. A round of excited yips followed, accompanied by a half-hearted growl from Bobby.
The pack snickered as Dean grinned in embarrassment. “Okay, awesome. As for the rest of us, don’t engage if you don’t have to. We just want to chase them off; no point picking a fight if we don’t need to.”
Panic flashed across Castiel’s face as Bartholomew pressed closer and Dean lurched out of his hiding place with a ferocious snarl. He pounced on the confused Bartholomew and the vampire paled for a second as Dean towered over him, teeth bared and hackles raised, but then Dean morphed and rooted himself by Castiel’s side.
“Adam, just take them hunting so we can all get some sleep,” grunted Bobby a little distance away. Summer was perfect for sleeping under the stars but since everyone was outside, it wasn’t so perfect for hosting private conversations.
Gadreel blinked as he attempted to wrap his brain around Jack’s line of thought. He eventually gave up and shook his head exasperatedly. “No, I’m not planning to challenge Dean and he isn’t the only one who’s allowed to take a mate. We were out here because sex is… private. We didn’t want anyone spying on us.” He eyed Jack pointedly.
For a brief second, Michael contemplated leaning against his brother, in search of comfort. He decided against it and scowled at himself for being needy and un-alpha-like.
him. Fortunately for poor Mick, I managed to turn them off the idea. Told them there would be an investigation into a missing minor and, since there were people at school who knew that Mick and I were dating, I would be at the top of the suspect list.”
Then, Dean would wrap strong, calloused fingers around his erection and Castiel’s head would tip backwards so Dean could claim his mouth heatedly. Castiel would groan as Dean entered him, and the Republican would smirk against his lips and whisper about how he would win the election.
Lucifer narrowed his eyes angrily. “I must have lost them in the car, then. I knew you’d both be here, so I thought I’d stop by and ask to borrow yours instead.” Dirty black liquid dripped from Lucifer’s sleeves onto the marble tiles.
“He’s been dumped by the pack that raised him and has nowhere else to go. At least he’s not from a pack that has a history of being your most dangerous enemy,” Castiel countered.
Ben wriggled closer to the alpha. “I don’t want your uncles to take you away,” he confessed softly. “I don’t want them to hurt you.”
“I am your boyfriend,” Dean murmured, smoothing a thumb over Castiel’s lips. “I’m very serious about wanting you.”
“What matters,” began Dean, raising his chin to match Novak’s gaze, “is delivering on my policies and being truthful when it comes to my plans for this great country and its loyal citizens. Unless, of course, you’re suggesting that my sexual preferences affect my ability to run this country – which would be very ironic, wouldn’t you say?”
“Screw you,” growled Lucifer. “You’re not Dad.” He turned towards Raphael once more, but this time he didn’t get a chance to take a step before Dean grabbed his ear and shook him. Lucifer slashed a claw across his face, leaving a bloody wound in his cheek, so Dean latched onto the scruff of his neck and dragged him across the camp, despite Lucifer’s snarled protests.
understanding of government. It asks intricate questions on the more obscure branches of politics – questions that exist merely to confuse applicants and prevent them from making a home in this country,” Castiel said snappily, clearly determined to make an ass of Dean in front of their eager audience. “Perhaps you’re averse to immigrants? Are you against providing refugees with a safe space; a place to call home? Are they not American unless they were born on our soil?”
He was so messed up. No wonder no one wanted him; he had nothing to offer except crippling mental health issues and years’ worth of emotional baggage.
A sly smirk crawled over Dean’s muzzle as he stretched. “Hey, maybe a couple of hunting lessons would do you good too, city mutt.”
“I’ll change those bandages again in a couple of days,” said Jody as she glanced over her work. “Try your best not to roll around in the mud again.”
He lingered in the doorframe and glanced over his shoulder, surprised to find Castiel staring at his back with sorrow and shame written across his face.
Michael fell quiet. After a minute of silence, he finally piped up, “…What’s the point of a relationship if you don’t plan on having a child? Who will you pass your wisdom and knowledge onto? Do you let your family name die with you?”
his own hoard,” Castiel teased. “Plus, no way is your hoard the finest quality chocolate in the world. I swear I saw some Reese’s Pieces in there last time.”
“Thank you for doing this, Dean. I understand how uncomfortable you must be, about to walk into a nest of vampires and all… but I promise I’m not that bad. Nor do I think you uncivilised or aggressive. I had to get you to stay somehow; I’m afraid I’m just that desperate to have someone here to spare me the agony of speaking to my ex or whoever else has caught my parents’ fancy with their unnecessary bank figures.”
Michael barked out an almost hysterical laugh as he stared at his brother in disbelief. “They have forced our little brothers into mating them! What else should I call them?”
Which was weird now that Michael thought about it, because wild folk seemed to allow every member of their pack to interact with their pups. They didn’t appear to be perpetually afraid of alphas harming or killing their children like civilised folk were.
There was a horrendous wet noise behind Dean and he turned slowly, already guessing what he was about to see despite never having come into contact with the Empty before. Before he even got a chance to take in the sight of black goo oozing out of the wall, Billie kicked the door open with a furious glower.
“The people, Dean.” Castiel admitted. He unfolded his legs and pulled his knees up to his chest. “I could feel them. Every single one of them, it’s like my connection to the Force is broken and I can’t shield properly.”
Castiel hummed in agreement and tried to shift a little, entangling their legs but at the sound of a pained humph from Dean did he pull back. “What happened?”
“Please refrain from judgement. It gives me peace of mind,” Castiel droned. His brother had even thought it was excessive and Gabriel was more protective than anyone Castiel knew. “Anything that keeps someone from finding Jack’s location is worth the extra hassle.”
Dean raised his hands in defeat. He knew Charlie wouldn’t let go of this information, and he might as well just give in. He needs some advice, anyway, and she always pulls through. “His name is Castiel, and he is my new roommate.”
Using the furniture to lean against and a dining room chair as a crutch (which Jack seemed to think was a toy to be pushed around despite Dean needing it to stay upright), Dean managed to pull together some lunch meat, cheese sticks, and crackers for them to munch on. The two of them sat at the coffee table since Dean didn’t trust himself to put Jack in his high chair, but Jack seemed to love the unusual experience Dean’s babysitting entailed.
“My arm was useless for a while. I could barely hold my light saber. I didn’t know what had happened, but I knew I had to get off of Generis.” Castiel pulled down his sleeve. “I stumbled to the nearest hangar, stole the first ship I saw. The ship stalled over Garqi, and here I am.”
about this woman in front of them, and yet Dean had just stared at her like he wanted to drink her in. There was something about her that was strangely magnetic, but Gabriel’s presence was enough to pull him back out.
He didn’t like being around his coworkers. They weren’t very welcoming to him, no matter whom he ended up on shift with. They weren’t rude, but they weren’t nice either, and Castiel could ever be comfortable around them. Nora, his manager, was understanding, and thinking that he seemed fit and capable, allowed him to take the graveyard shift instead.
“Oh yeah,” Dean said with a grin. “He was the best dealer ever. No security official ever figured out how Ash snuck about to get his merch to us. Best hallucinogens on the planet.”
A bitter laugh escaped Cas’s mouth, and he covered it with another swig of liquor. He examined his booze; it was almost all gone. “I don’t know Dean, what did happen to me?” He finished the rest of the drink, and threw the bottle hard as he can into the water. “Don’t ask stupid questions.”
It seemed to pain Castiel to be so open about his fears, if the tension in his shoulders was anything to go by, but he carried on explaining himself.
“No.” Castiel said. He started muttering something under his breath. Dean stood up, and caught Castiel's wrists before he dug into another shelf. “Cas, what-?”
It was weird, Dean thought, seeing The Seraph with a kid. He didn’t know much about the other Super since they’d only ever worked together once or twice and Castiel didn’t make much of a lasting impression on Dean at the time. Yeah, the guy was real good in a fight and he often took on some of their worst foes with his impressive mind trick mumbo-jumbo, but when most Supers stuck around after a big fight to get to know each other just a bit better, Castiel always disappeared into the shadows.
Dean grew quiet, thoughtfully chewing on food. He swallowed, and thought that he should just take the plunge. “But what if… what if it feels like it could be, Charlie?”
Castiel watched as his friend plated a steaming pile of meat, potatoes, and vegetables, the scent of it all making Cas’s stomach growl.
The three of them played for a while, Dean play-chasing Jack around the room as Castiel carefully guided his son through the air. Only when Jack reached for Dean and asked for food did they make their way downstairs and into the kitchen for breakfast.
"KAZ has always been a huge fan of his namesake," Dean said with a smile. Charlie bit her lip, as if she was holding herself back from saying something, and Dean waved at her to start.
Dean hadn’t expected that question and took a moment to think about what he would even say. Would he rather have his brother be the one with the powers? “Honestly? No. I can’t imagine having to watch my brother do some of the things I’ve done. The fear of not knowing if he’d make it home in one piece or watching broadcasts of him being beaten and bloodied. I don’t think I could’ve done that. It would have torn me up. But what I have wished for is that both of us could’ve been Mundane.”
“You okay, Dean?” Charlie said, as Dean had been quiet for the past five minutes now, not commenting on anything Charlie had said about her trip.
Dean understood the irony of being annoyed on a day with no crime that needed Super intervention in order to keep the city free from crime. Dean got how irritating it was to be spoken about by the PD as if Castiel were a weapon to be wielded and not a living breathing human. Dean was unlike anyone Castiel had ever gotten to know before and he was sad that their friendship likely had an expiration date. He’d never known someone to want to maintain a friendship with him for very long, given that Castiel wasn’t one to often reach out first.
It was currently the middle of the night and Dean was exhausted. He had no desire to play despite how cute Jack was.
Castiel could picture it in his mind so clearly, Dean up on stage smiling to a crowd, using his charm to get young teens to want to listen to his message and someday grow into Supers of their own, with or without powers. “Of course they do.”
Castiel led him to a familiar dorm room, and entered quietly. The two girls were not there, so Dean sat on one of the beds to wait.
Castiel could see Dean’s point. None of his food had ever tasted like this, but at the same time, “Maybe he just likes you.”
Dean nodded in understanding. It was a risk to find someone in this life. Two Supers together could work but there were so few of them that finding their match in another Super wasn’t likely. And having a Mundane or a civilian partner presented its own risks and complications.
It was one thing to have a crush on Dean but it was another thing to allow these thoughts to run rampant when Dean was lying right beside him.
He had just gone to sleep when he received Castiel’s call. All he heard were the words ‘rob the store’, and that jolted him awake faster than a bucket of cold water could have done. Robberies meant guns, and Castiel didn’t know guns, never seen guns, hell, Dean wouldn’t be surprised if Castiel underestimated the damage guns do. Even if Dean was sure he heard Castiel tell him that he was just fine, he needed to see it for himself.
Charlie smiled at Dean. “Of course he isn't, Dean.” Dean looked up, surprised. “And he won't ever surface, if that is what you're waiting for. A lot of time has passed. And even excluding the shavit that was the Jedi Purge, things have changed. He grew up, too.”
“I’m not lying,” he said with a sigh. She was really, truly going to kill him. Especially with what he needed to say next. “There’s another thing.”
From Cas’s spot at the window he watched the kid and dog suddenly appear on the other side of the street, completely unharmed. The car that had almost hit the had swerved into an oncoming car, both drivers looking around in confusion.
Would it be rude to ask why Abaddon was coming after him? At the very least this sounded like information Castiel needed to know, especially if he was now at risk of being on her radar.
Castiel Nov-Vak had been on plenty of missions. A number of these involve guarding diplomats and their families from assassination attempts, or investigating brutally committed force-based crimes. It was hardly new, and this usually gave him and his master time to study the Force further and do some training exercises, aside from actively investigating the mission and gaining experience. It was never easy, but it was something that he knew how to do and how to get through, and this next one should be as rich and rewarding in terms of learning and experience like all his missions have been.
Dean’s body was still pretty exhausted so he allowed himself to sit back and doze in and out, waking up to grab some of the toys Jack would offer him before the baby would crawl back over to play with his father. So far Dean had accumulated a firetruck, a red triangle block, a piece of a wooden puzzle in the shape of a cow, and a black car. He wasn’t entirely certain what Jack wanted him to have them for but he sure as hell wasn’t going to deny the little gifts.
“Most likely a power of the mind,” the other Super explained. “My father is able to create illusions that alter one’s perception of reality and my mother is able to control and manipulate weather, and since I can manipulate gravity in the way I do, I feel he’ll most likely be able to do something along those lines as well.”
The airspeeder was black and was called Chevrolet. Castiel never understood why vehicles needed to be named, especially a speeder.
Castiel convinced him to wait until morning. It went against Dean's gut, but Castiel said that he wanted to inform the students from the university that he had to leave and could not cover for them anymore. It was a kind decision, and so Dean went along with it.
For the purposes of this fic, the bunker is located in Lawrence, Kansas, near-ish Dean's family home.
Sam entered the room, and paused in his tracks. “All right, so I hope you are all - what in the galaxy is on your face? Is that contagious?”
Castiel laughed and explained, “I called my brother when Jack went down for a nap. I didn’t know what to do about you being here and he said he would do what he could to draw her away from this area.”
Dean had already decided to stay the moment Castiel had asked. He wasn’t in any position to fight a powerful Super on something as menial as where he should stay while healing, but the look in the other man’s eyes pulled at something in Dean. He knew what it felt like to worry for his loved ones but he knew that his worry would likely never compare to that of a parent’s worry for their child. It was obvious that Castiel wasn’t fond of the idea of Dean staying either, but the Super had clearly weighed his options and found this one to be the safest for his family.
“I know it’s still so selfish of me to have him,” Castiel admitted, sadness deep in his eyes. “To bring him up with a parent who puts himself in danger constantly but so far I think I’ve done okay. I’ve been so careful to make sure no one ever follows me, to make sure that nothing
Dean scowled, but before he could respond, Castiel spoke. “Sam’s right - people could recognize me as a Jedi either way." Castiel frowned at Gabriel. He handed him a pair of glasses, and when Gabriel put them on, Castiel looked satisfied. "With what happened on Garqi as well, we should not risk it.”
“Let me help,” he blurted out as Castiel pulled some fresh fruit out of the refrigerator. The other Super looked at him through squinted eyes.
Dean was equal parts angry and thrilled. He didn’t expect Sam to come along which meant Dean was involuntarily revealing Cas’s identity to one more person but Dean was grateful to be able to see both his brother and Charlie after so long. He pulled Sam into a hug first before turning to wrap Charlie into a bear hug as well. He should’ve expected that when they pulled apart that she would attack him with a few hits to his chest.
“Look Dean, you’ve been so tense,” Charlie explained between bites of her burger. “During the last LARP, you picked a fight with the other kingdom’s messenger for no reason. My council was betting between an intense round of fucking or a duel to the death in the courtyard.”
Unsurprisingly, Dean’s meal was a hit with them all, including Jack who had never in his life eaten so much until Dean arrived. Castiel was still certain that Jack’s enthrallment with the other Super was the root of his newfound love for vegetables, but Castiel could admit that Dean was a far better chef than Castiel could ever hope to be. It was a shame that soon he and his son would have to go back to his flavorless slop he once called food.
Castiel hated that he had to ignore Jack crying out for him, the baby was obviously so confused and scared by the way Castiel and Dean were frantically calling their people but Castiel knew it was for Jack’s own good that he stayed focused. He tried to rock his son, and shush him as best as he could but with Gabriel screaming in one ear and Dean arguing with someone in the other, Jack couldn’t be soothed.
“If it’s not the ship it's the droid,”  Charlie murmured under her breath. “Anyway, even if I can't get the guard schedule, I at least was able to get the prisoner transfer log and it’s got your kids’ prison number. I'd sent everything you need already.”
He didn’t want to admit that Dean was right but Castiel wasn’t stupid. Abaddon had already discovered where Dean’s hideouts were, likely with the help of Crowley’s intelligence. Who’s to say they couldn’t find Castiel’s? He couldn’t allow such a thing to happen.
“He likes to refuse to eat what I cook most days. And then when I find something he does like it’s all he wants to eat for a few weeks straight until all of a sudden he doesn’t. I swear the past month he decided anything green was poison.”
It was entirely possible that the two students were messing with Dean, and they sent him on a wild bantha chase just so he would leave them alone. Heart hammering, Dean moved forward, but he could not ignore the deep sense of foreboding he felt that screamed at him to stay away.
The bond between father and son was strong and it stirred something inside of Dean. He hadn’t exactly written off the idea of having a family of his own someday but he knew it wouldn’t be easy. Finding a partner who would be comfortable with him being a Super and frequently in danger wasn’t easily done. But seeing Castiel, The Seraph, with a child and seeing how happy they were made the possibility of a future family seem more likely.
“Oh?” Dean raised an eyebrow. He noted that Gabriel stood by the door and almost faded into the background, which made him feel safer.
“Yeah,” Castiel said with a nod. There was a small smile in his eyes as he added, “both our parents were Supers and they weren’t around a lot. Always off saving the world so it was just us a lot. We have another older brother and sister but they already had families of their own when my powers manifested but Gabriel was still at home.
Once breakfast was cleaned up (Dean being given the task of wiping the berry tye-dye from Jack’s face) the three of them wound back up in the living room once more. The TV was on playing the news as usual and Castiel and Jack were playing with stacking blocks over in the corner.
ever enters this front door.” His gaze was indescribably tender, his voice soft as he said, “I just wanted to be a dad. More than I’ve ever wanted anything before. And I think I’m giving him a stable enough life. As best as I can.”
He hadn’t known who else to call. As a Super, especially one currently with a target on their back, calling someone for backup was too risky unless you wanted to put a target on their back as well. But Jody had told Dean to call her in situations like this and since she was the head of the Super activity department for the metropolitan PD and Dean didn’t have any other options, Jody was his only source of backup. And she was a friend.
Now he had Dean Winchester in his bed. Captain Speed. Captain Speed was wearing his clothes in his bed. Laying next to him. On his pillows. This was a stupid idea. The most terrible idea Castiel had ever had. What was he thinking? Gabriel had been absolutely right. Castiel was attracted to Dean. Of course he was. He had working eyes and Dean was gorgeous but it was more than that. Dean was funny and smart and was amazing with Jack and Castiel was pretty certain he’d never see anything sexier than Dean carrying a baby.
Castiel knew Dean was right, Dean could see it in his eyes. It was the only option, especially if Castiel didn’t want anyone knowing Dean was at his home. Dean could see the anxiety in Cas’s shoulders and for a moment worried the other Super wouldn’t leave but then he nodded stiffly.
mind reading abilities? How was it any question that he was clearly the better Super between the two of them.
The boy curled up on the floor, and cowered behind his hands. “Please don't hurt me I swear I know nothing more don't take me to the garrison please-”
With all of the strength in him he sent Abaddon flying into the side of a building, the cement cracking as her body made impact–she hadn’t had time to turn herself to smoke.
And then he talked about the kiss, and Charlie's amused-I'm-happy-for-you vibe slowly morphed into something sympathetic.
Taking his seat on the floor, Castiel accepted the policeman and fireman dolls that Jack handed to him, walking them around the floor pretending to save the day. The three of them played for another ten minutes before Castiel could tell his son was starting to get tired. It was already closing in on his bedtime so Cas excused the two of them to start Jack’s bedtime routine.
But their conversation ended there as Jack’s grabby hands started reaching up and out of the playpen.
Though he was one of the most notable Superheros of his time and was fully capable of taking care of himself, he was still the baby of the family. And even though his older brother held no extraordinary power of his own, he still managed to protect Castiel in every way possible, especially now that The Seraph was a public figure.
Dean paused, listening to what Castiel was mumbling. “Where did they put it, where could it be, where is it…”
As they walked down their street hand in hand, Dean took a moment to think about how it was the first time he’d been out in almost a month. No one was even paying him and Cas any attention. Anyone who walked past the two of them just saw two men holding hands, not Captain Speed and The Seraph. It made Dean realize that it was entirely possible that the two of them could explore their budding realization outside the walls of their home.
By the time it was dark out and Jack was asleep, Castiel and Dean were once more watching the news but Dean was distracted by his thoughts.
“You can’t seriously be thinking about going,” Castiel’s voice scolded from where he was sitting. Dean didn't appreciate the tone and glared at the other man.
Gabriel’s grin did not leave his face. Neither did his arm leave Castiel’s shoulder, and Castiel resigned himself to his fate. “Cheeky, padawan. You are becoming more like me. It’s about time.”
As powerful as Castiel knew Captain Speed was, it was clear in just the few minutes Castiel had been there that the fight was unbalanced. The Demon’s mental abilities against Dean’s speed and strength meant Dean was easily brought to his knees, screaming in pain, before he could even reach his enemy.
“When I decided to start fighting he said he wanted to find some way to keep me safe, to make sure the public wouldn’t idolize me too much and put a target on my back, but he still wanted to make sure they liked me enough to want to get rid of my enemies.”
