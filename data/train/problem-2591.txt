You: "Shit," John muttered. His cock was practically poking out of his red pants.
“Hold still for me, John.”
John snorted. “Not sure exactly
formed such an attachment to anyone, and the interest is compounded by the fact that Greg is human.”
John swallowed at the word. Sir. How could one little word have such an impact on him?
Stranger: "Terrified," Sherlock smiled into his skin, licking over his Adam's apple and down his chest. "Sensitive?" He asked, moving his fingers over John's nipples and playing with them. "They're cute. Like you."
Stranger: Sherlock smiled. "Doing what?"
It wasn’t, John thought morosely, the absolute worst thing that would happen
I am very sorry for the delay in posting this chapter. Real life got in the way, and then I had difficulties getting this chapter written for some reason.
Sherlock assessed him silently. “You will tell me if anything becomes unpleasant.”
After a couple of bites of food though, Greg muted the TV and turned to his lover. “Ok, spill. What was that about this afternoon?”
“What, like interracial dating?”
“Yes. Several times.”
“Stop what?” John asked, taking a step back and bumping into the wall.
“You’ve been asleep for five hours.”
You: [Mycroft smirked] I lips are sealed Officer Donavan. I will be there in several minutes. -MH
With a grin, Mycroft slicked up a butt plug. It was small really, but it was metal and heavy enough to be very distracting. He slowly pushed it inside Greg’s hole and left the bed. He typed a quick text to Anthea.
“Excellent point. Might I suggest that we make use of the offered guest room?”
“What, I let slip that I’ve gone out with men from time to time and you see an opening and take it?” John sputters somewhat indignantly.
Stranger: "Rather unobservant, don't you think?" Sherlock chuckled, leaning up to press his lips to John's and gently nipped at his bottom one.
“Well, I suppose it’s nice to have someone to cook for,” Mycroft said, smiling across to Greg , ignoring the jab. He padded barefoot across the kitchen to help Lestrade take out the plates.
“I think as long as I’m around for the cleaning and stuff, he’s fine.” John shrugged. “Half the time he’s so engrossed in his experiments, I’m not sure if he knows whether I’m even there.”
But it was the other bits that made John nervous. It wasn’t that he was afraid of Sherlock, he just didn’t know what they were
“What?” John asked, surprised.
You: Sherlock swallowed. He was, for once, at a loss of how to proceed. "I-I'm not sure. But it seems that we shouldn't remain standing?"
“So soft and hot, blood pulsing just under the surface of this pretty skin,” Sherlock murmured. “And all mine.”
"That is none of your business until it becomes office, if ever."
Greg went white and then nodded. “Right. Yeah.”
You're chatting with a random stranger. Say hi!
John nods and chews thoughtfully. “So is he going to make Greg his mate?”
Maribella Holmes was a strong supporter of tradition, and now that Myrcroft and his omega wife, Anthea, had produced their second child, she had turned her attention to her younger son. Sherlock had spent years wandering around Europe, drugged up, strung out, and generally not in any right mind to have a child. But now that he was clean, had been for a good number of years now, it was time for him to follow the proud tradition of ensuring the Holmes family line.
“No.” Sherlock held his head still and examined the cut. “It is already beginning to heal.”
“You had best open it then, hadn’t you, my boy?” he replied, without lifting his eyes from the laundry bill but with a tremor in his voice to which thumbscrews would not have induced him to admit.
John opens his mouth again and gapes for a moment. “What do you mean share me?!” he asks indignantly.
John sat back heavily against the pillows on the bed. He heard movement in the bathroom and wrapped the robe tightly around him, covering the incriminating evidence. He was still aroused, but that would have to wait. He owed it Sherlock to tell him of the….issue immediately.
Sherlock paused, long fingers poised over the strings of the bow. His eyes flicked to the hallway that lead to his bedroom. “I felt that John deserves protection of our House. Regardless of his…connection to myself.”
“Yes.” Sherlock pulled John to him and cupped his face. “I asked you to trust me. It will…it won’t be painful for long. I wouldn’t do this if it didn’t make you
“So beautiful like that, John,” he murmured, fingers dancing along the back of John’s neck and kissed the top of his head. “So brave, my John.”
“That you’ll stay home with me for the next two days. You need a break, and I’m determined to help you relax.” The feral grin that Mycroft gave Greg should have made him shiver in fear. Instead he shivered in aroused anticipation.
Mycroft made a face that his boyfriend had identified as the ‘I’m going to have to pull some manipulative stunt to get what I want’ look. “Gregory, you must know how hard it is to watch you enter dangerous situations.” He ran the back of his hand down the other man’s cheek.
Sherlock grasped his face and held him still so that he could kiss John deeply. “We have time. My John. We have plenty of time.”
“There is one more thing, Gregory, that you should know,” the vampire said, pushing him away.
Suddenly it didn’t matter that the roles they had prepared for had been reversed. If anyone had asked, they would have said that it was the first time in his life he’d felt whole, though Sherlock probably would never admit as such to Mycroft.
“I –“ Sherlock licked his dry lips, “I need your knot. I need – I need you to breed me!”
The vampire slicked up two fingers and pushed them into John’s anus. John’s breath hitched at the intrusion but after a moment, he pushed himself back, silently asking for more. Sherlock tried to practice patience. He was nearly 200 years old and had practiced restraint for years.
“So good, John. So…obedient.”
“Yes, I cannot have you wandering around London carrying my sigil wearing anything less than the best. My family’s enemies will sniff a weakness. It could cause problems. That and Mycroft would never let me hear the end of it.” He flashed John a smirk that showed just the tip of a long extended fang.
“Ah, yes, thank you, Gerald,” he stated, returning to the present, and sliding from the car. “I don’t think I’ll be too long. Stay close.”
did this?” the older man said picking up the pace and entering the house at a clip. The wall paper, old and from the 1970s, was faded and peeling from the walls. The floors were scarred, long scratches running the length, as if there were many dogs (
The man nodded. “We’ve discussed it. If there’s a serial killer who’s going after us, we want to take him on head-on, even if that means Shifting without the Moon and at work. We’re willing to do what it takes, even if we Shift with restrictions: collars, leashes, vests...muzzles.”
After much pushing and shoving, she found her way through the initial checkpoint and into the depths of the building. Imogen had to breathe a small sigh of relief. With her uncle’s credentials, she was able to quickly pass security and all of the subsequent checkpoints. She was led through plain halls to a white door, a single guard posted beside it. “That’s it?” she breathed, a bit let down after all the hype. Then she noticed the apparatus itself.
Then, with a small shiver and a soft yelp, Thomas shifted, his legs getting tangled within the blanket that he had been swaddled in. Pulling at the blanket with a hand, Sherrinford loosened the Pup’s constraints, letting the surprisingly small being tumble out to land again on his t-shirt clad chest.
“As far as I know: yes,” she breathed, trying to hide the subtle notes of fear in her voice. “Why do you ask?”
he mentally hissed, berating them.
His introduction was greeted by laughter, as he had hoped. The growing crowd was here to see him, after all. He had been all over the news, plastered on page and screen alike for the last two weeks or more.
“Sherlock!” Evelyn exclaimed, rushing up the last few steps to wrap her arms about his waist. He allowed his arms to return the gesture, pressing his nose into her hair and inhaling her enticing scent. Resting her chin on his sternum, the teen continued. “How was your day?”
“Yes,” the Wolf said, his chin raising slightly as he offered his hand. “It is a pleasure to meet you again, Lord Kensington, under much more pleasant circumstances.”
“I think that you are even stronger than I thought.”
“Don’t be absurd!” the man retorted, shooting him a dark glance while pouring a heaping cup of coffee for himself.
He wandered over to the settee and took an armchair across from it with a soft exhale. “Everything is great,” he said, “Thank you for asking. I appreciate your willingness to do this, Molly. Both you and Mycroft are too kind.”
Sherrinford found himself calming as the evening progressed. The bits of beef jerky that his elder brother kept slipping him were certainly helping and the group that followed his movements like a shadow was well-meaning despite their rather horrid stench. They had positive reactions to what they saw and they were willing to find the humanity in his kind. It helped to have Mycroft there to explain their process and their techniques, and outline their goals for the Wolves that presented themselves. It was especially wonderful to have his brother there when the older man stumbled over an exposed root and landed on his buttocks. His canine laughter rolled out of him, truly marking him as more than a dog, even as his brother’s cheeks flushed with humiliation at the laughter that came from the watchers.
"Those who talk of 'mere money' so often have least need of it," put in her patroness. "People like Kitty know its true worth. I feel myself rather to be in her debt, so you see we balance the books fair and square between us." It was hard to credit that these were the same creatures who the year before might have been tearing each other's own hair out.
“My Lord. My…word.” He was naked in an instant, gloriously naked. He’d been comfortably naked all evening under the dun woollen flannel, soft as lawn from years of wear. I started hastily on my own clothing but he stopped me at shirtless and barefoot.
I kissed him there instead, and he gasped as hard as if I had cut him indeed, as if the possibility had shouted to him too and he was waiting to see if I heeded it. I meant to cast the thing aside then, but he reached out behind his back, blind and trusting, to grab my wrist and stop me.
She wore trousers. Elegant, well-cut, feminine ones, in glowing cinnamon silk – but they could not be mistaken for skirts. I had never seen such a garment on a lady in England. However Holmes did not comment, and so neither did I. He sat, still in disguise – he often took pleasure in being someone else- lapsing from time to time into character, making the company laugh, and assured me that no-one else had been able to tell his real identity, not even the ladies until he chose to reveal himself
I wanted to make some joke about being a doctor - and an officer - not a batman, but as I tugged the stocking over the high arch of his left foot he hissed and bared his teeth. I rotated the ankle joint with care. Nothing amiss there. Likewise no bruising at the toes, no crushing. The sole, however, proved tender to the touch and unyielding of movement.  Rigging up a cold compress was the work of a moment and I found I had not altogether lost my dressing skills as I wound the linen bandage gently snug.
“Mr Holmes. Bohemian as ever. We have often thought that a relaxation in protocol must go along with your unique habits of thinking, and you have once more proved us correct.”
The knocking came again: unheeding, imperious. I climbed over him.
Dr Theophilus Simpson was a wiser man than that and called in the police. They proceeded to dim the lamps of wisdom and task him with wasting police time. Thus it was that next morning, on a baking hot Friday in June, he sought a second opinion in the sitting room at Baker Street.
"Gone downhill a touch since Gusty Manns left," remarked our host, gesturing at the group of players, who murmured at this in a good-natured sort of way, for there was no sting in it. "Gents, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes, emergency second chair fiddle many a time when Ernie Thompson, God rest him, was…indisposed." Some of the older men exchanged meaningful looks.  Henry Wood shrugged an apology. "But if you’ll both excuse me, duty calls," and he struck up again, leading them in a rousing two-step. Several of the orchestra not constantly required for the melody slunk curious and amused glances at us. Moving aside to let the flood of couples take the floor, I ventured that some at least must be readers of mine.
At the last word, he gripped the back of his chair with such strength he looked to break it and turned to me with a look of pure hatred - for he knew I was not his ally and that somehow I had guessed his secret. Those whom the world calls perverted must either bend under its shaming power or rage against it.
A telegram from an exclusive academy for young ladies in Lucerne in late April of 1891 went unanswered. Had she but known it, he was closer to her when she sent it than at any time since she was last in our Baker Street sitting room.
He hauled it out and then waited, pointedly, until I turned to the wall, listening as he relieved himself with a heaving sigh. Even the most intimate of friends may not share everything. Perhaps one day.  My memory obliged with a pleasant vision of him simply naked, just to be going on with.
She wrote to him from the school at Walsall, the year after. He cleared up the matter of the twin daughters of Lord Aumerle and the fraudulent cheque without so much as looking up the journey north in a Bradshaw’s.
He sighed and finally met my eye. “Ah, Watson. Why is it, do you suppose, that the Diogenes keeps silence?”
"You mean it might be
We stood at a sloping reading-stand, heads close together, sharing breathspace, scanning the pages of the Registry of Marriages for the previous quarter.
To the world, he yet remains one of the most famous (though, given his published habits, perhaps not the most eligible) of bachelors.
His hand reached round to unbutton my trousers with deft accuracy.
“I am sorry to hear it. That was, however, why you came home?”
“You can stay at the Placket Arms, between the house and the village.” She took us both in with a glance, for there was no doubt in any of our minds that ‘I’ would ever and ever mean ‘we’.
His long arm shot out and grabbed me by the shirt front.
Indeed.  Now I come to think of it, the “someone” who had kicked the pot under Sherlock Holmes’ bed in his haste to get into the aforesaid bed, had probably been wearing steel-capped shoes.
“I beg your pardon?”
"Holmes, people are staring at us. You will be recognised if you talk like that."
“Everything Sherlock. Everything.” I turned my head to the side where Sherlock was hovering behind me to the right, his eyes putting on the puppy dog eyes, from which I only knew it was because he didn’t want to get banned from doing his experiments again. I turned my head back forward, not allowing myself to be the bait to that trick once again.
Its photo was one of the man's right hand, his palm was facing away from the shot, leaving the outside visible. This was different from how the body was laid out on the table behind us, most likely due to the customary actions of the morgue. It was hard for me to make out as the bee stings swelled their way around the, what I could only assume, cut. All I could figure out was that there was a definite scar of something right above where the fingers meet the base of the hand. That something was the thing I couldn't quite figure out. But I knew who could. I lifted up my finger, watching as Sherlock followed the movement as I pointed towards the spot in question, tilting my head up to stare up at him.
“So, would you say you prefer your bees over other humans.” Sherlock leaned forward and rested his elbows on his knees and held his head in his hands. A pose that made me realize this was a question that would determine if he would still be a suspect or not.
It had been two hours since we left the morgue, and made it back home. And for the last hour and forty-five minutes. (If you took out the car ride home) Sherlock had been laying around soberly on the stretched out about the whole couch. I could practically feel my icy glare bouncing off of the lying man reflecting back to punch me in the face as I brought up the cup taking a sip out of my now cold tea.
The detective shot his Mate an equally hard look before softening his gaze to look at the young woman. “Evelyn,” the dark haired man said softly, “It is not that I do not want to be your second parent. I do consider it to be an honor that you asked. I am sure that your Uncle Mycroft could run up some papers, set up a legal guardianship. However, I think that you could just call me Sherlock. That way I am not called by some name a grandfather would be glad to be known by.”
“Which means that Mycroft, who had obviously tried to protect his long-lost younger brother through his Law, will be completely free to show them around.” Sherlock nodded, understanding. “I hope it works.”
“It’s Trevor Stevenson. He’s one of Sherrinford’s.”
The streets were bare, which was probably a good thing. After all, they didn’t want the general public sweeping the pair of them off the streets and into a pound or shelter. They wore tags: both on the collar and on their hidden chain. Normal humans, however, were rather dull in his expert opinion, and they would probably not check the tags. Or, worse, if they did, they could discover the Holmes family secret, which he did not want out in the open.
“Fine, Dad,” she replied nonchalantly.
Sherlock shook his head, his eyes still roving about the ground. “No, I mean Jack. He should be on his way.”
The doctor simply shook his head and knelt, his dextrous hands tracing over the body almost tenderly. Sherlock continued to run about the room, sniffing and grumbling to himself. “Anything else, gentlemen?” he asked quietly.
Elizabeth beamed. “He’s doing well. Shifting right now, or he’d tell you himself. He got a promotion at work this past week. He’s a guard now. Isn’t that wonderful?”
“Then you must be making all the other whales jealous,” he replied, placing a light kiss to her flushed cheek before inhaling lightly (
He turned to slide into the car when a single shot rang out. His youngest sibling yelped, collapsing into his thigh like a deadweight, half in the car, half out of it. “Sherrinford?” he breathed, dropping the stupid leash to pull the surprisingly heavy form of his brother into the car. Blood, thick with the silvery mucus came away in his hands. “
_ _ _ _ _
Thomas was Shifting nervously in his arms, as if the little one could sense the importance of what was to come. In a few hours, he would be Shifting for a prolonged (By his young standards) period of time. He himself couldn’t remember his First Shift - he had been so young, after all. A literal newborn in his mother’s arms.
Feeling a bit antsy and needing to expend some of his energy, he nuzzled Molly’s leg and rose, trotting to the door with a soft yip. “Sherrinford,” Mycroft breathed as if his youngest brother was an incompetent child, “You should have used the loo before moonrise.”
“Jack?” He was a bit lost. “Do you mean John? I think he’s at clinic today.”
Once the contraction passed, she released his fur with a soft apology and a whisper of gratitude. That one was was strong, worse than it should have been at this point in time. Everything was moving quickly. Sherrinford licked her fingers and gave her a gentle push toward the stairs. “
He watched their retreating backs with apprehension. This was dangerous. So very dangerous. And the last thing he wanted was to have his youngest brother killed to bring about change for his kind. Over a mistake that he had made years ago in the creation of “The Declaration of the Rights of Werewolf Kind”.
The Change was swift, as usual, and he exited with his tail proud and erect. He met Mycroft on the stairs but passed him, not wanting to be reprimanded for his inability to spend lengths of time with their parents in his more talkative form. The British Government simply did not understand how painful it was for him. There were times that he was sure that Sherlock didn’t quiet understand either.
The sunset was the perfect backdrop for their late game of fetch. She’d brought a whole bag of tennis balls, all of which would be demolished in less than an hour. Thomas, who spent more of his life as a Pup than as a human, came galavanting out of the building first, chasing circles around a tall auburn Wolf and a short but lithe ebony Wolf, their bodies so close together that she wasn’t entirely sure when one ended and the other began. Her father and Sherlock followed them, the dark brown Wolf pressed against her father’s side possessively.
The Lupus sapiens nodded, looking at his lap. “I understand but why bring in a ‘specialist’? -I just want to help, sir. I
. Several of the K13’s were surprisingly in their furry forms, bullet-proof vests strapped in place by their human partners, thick collars jangling with their tags and badges. Their nostrils were flared at all the new scents that surrounded them in the glen just off of the Kensington property.
“He’s gone,” the other man breathed. “And he left a message.”
His face pulled into it’s mask before he closed his eyes and fell back into his Mind Palace. He still had a case to solve.
The young man chuckled. “Let’s go to the sofas. I’ll tell you about them.”
He took a step back, a hand fiddling a bit with his exposed tags. His confidence dimmed slightly as the crowd shifted in their seats. Sean, Elizabeth beside him, rose and pulled his own tags from beneath his shirt. “Thank you, Sherrinford, for being candid. I, too, am done hiding who I am.”
She slid down the door, her kissed hand pressed to her pecked cheek. He told her about his childhood abroad - boarding school - where he had lived with a great uncle whom had died the year he moved home to England for good. It had been a lonely childhood, he said. He had few friends, most of them were in school with him, but he spent summers in the German countryside with his uncle. He had revealed to her that it was through the man’s acquaintances that he had been exposed to the Lupus sapiens and had developed the desire to study them.
The grey-haired man gave him a pointed look before lowering his voice and leaning in. “If it were anyone else, I’d keep him here, but I think being near
“That, Sherlock, was Imogen,” the younger man murmured, eyes twinkling while simultaneously glazed.
“Why, John?” he shot back, his teeth flashing, eyes blazing as he launched himself onto the sofa. “Why?!”
The new silence between them was much more comfortable than it had been. “Sherrinford,” she murmured, “If I wasn’t a Hunter, what would you be doing?”
“I haven’t told her,” he sighed sullenly, nostrils flaring in remembrance of her sweet scent. “No, we’re on a bit of a break of sorts. The Pack comes first. I’ll call her from time to time and meet when I’m free. On New Moons, probably, if that’s alright?”
“Why should I be proud?” he asked, confused, his brow furrowing. “They are not mine.”
. “That I can do,” he breathed, “And I might be able to get some bacon, eggs, and toast cooking, too.”
“No, but you were
He woofed quietly, dancing from paw to paw. He had forgotten his collar, so he ran to grab it from his dresser as his brother entered the flat. “What are you up to?” the younger man asked, bending to take the collar from his mouth. “You want this on, I assume.” His fingers scratched his ruff playfully as he closed the belt of leather around his neck and tucked the tags behind it. “Are we going out?”
In less than two steps, the tall man was extricating his furry body from the ragged remains of his clothing, his human veneer gone. His tail was tucked and his ears were down, his steps taking him further from her until his backside connected with the bookcase behind him, her family closing in.
The interaction continued, as the two men shifted subjects to the latest case that they were working, their voices going well into the night as she slept, dreaming of wolves. It was only after she woke in the morning that she realized that her father had not answered her question.
“Oh,” Lucy said nodding and grasping the concept. “Okay! It can be a game! Oh!” she gasped, “It can be like we finally have a dog!”
“I could use some coffee,” she stated, stretching against her silky sheets. “Are you cooking?”
The woman looked up from the book she was reading with a bit of a jolt. “Oh!” she breathed, hand fluttering to her stomach, “Hello Sherrinford. I’m about ready to pop, I think. And you? Everything to your liking?”
“To us. Don’t forget the other extinct supernatural beasts of the world.” He bit his lips, thinking. “I don’t think it’s them, though, Sherlock. If it is, then they’ve lost a lot of their technique and anything that they found noble.” He had his brother’s attention now, the detective’s sharp eyes focused on his. “My adoptive father was attacked by one when I was five. I hid under the bed and watched him tear into the man, yowling against wolfsbane laced knives.” He shivered. “Once the man was Bitten, however, he took something, probably cyanide, foamed at the mouth, and died. I had to stitch my father up afterwards…” He shuddered, loathing the memory. “The thing is, Sherlock, they didn’t discriminate their Hunting nights. They would have found this practice of killing with bullets and on the night where we are weakest as shameful and dishonorable.”
), had simply eliminated anything human about the afflicted men. They would not only wear tags, they were being placed in facilities on a permanent basis - to keep them safe from the new threat that faced them.
“Yes, yes, you can go.” The violinist’s hand waved him away like a pesky maid with a tea tray. He bit back a growl.
“When are they integrated into Packs? When can they bring non-Lupus sapiens to the facility?”
” he asked, his eyes darkening dangerously, the Wolf flashing within them. “Repeat that again for me.
Steps on the stairs of 221 Baker Street did not make the child stir, and, not wanting to wake her, he continued to lay still. Sherlock would know where they were. He’d probably deduce that he was in his furry form; he usually was when he ventured into 221C, he realized.
“John.” He thrust his hand out, needing to read the case. The other man withdrew further, pulling the laptop to his chest. He glared, his upper lip twitching to reveal his blunt teeth. The soldier glared defiantly back, long used to his wolf-like tendencies.
The red-headed man shook his head once, his eyes downcast. “Lord Kensington has introduced an addendum to the Law that will place every Lupus sapiens into quasi-concentration camps with armed guards and surveillance. Arranged visiting hours through glass or bars. K13s working only in Wolf form with muzzles and leashes, shackled into doghood and picked up or dropped off at the ‘kennel’ each day. No one else works or has a right to leave.”
The man shook his proffered hand and trudged from his office, the slip of prescription paper clasped in his hands like it was the only thing that was keeping him going. “I am
His eyes met those of his sister-in-law before he asked, “Are you all set? He should be pretty quiet for a couple of hours and he’ll sleep for a bit of the night. Hopefully, I’ll be back by the time he wakes enough to cause trouble.”
clothing.”
“Oh boys!” Mrs. Hudson said cheerfully from her doorway, “Shall I let you out?” He nodded vigorously, as did Sherrinford, the younger man even barking enthusiastically. The antics of his younger sibling made him roll his eyes but did not diminish their shared enthusiasm. “Okay, okay,” the landlady chuckled, pushing through their wriggling mass of fur and energy, “The back door will be open for when you get back. Don’t stay out too late!”
His fingers set to work, pulling the bow across the strings while others danced the tune out. He knew that Sherrinford had left, his perfume lingering a bit before fading.
He woke the following morning to the sound of breakfast being consumed, the scent of toast and jam reaching his nostrils. He rose slowly, a bit stiff from a night on the floor, and stretched.
There was a sharp rap on his door. “Moon’s up in five. The diversion is set in motion.”
When they were finally back in their shared flat, Sherlock retreated to his room to allow his bones to rearrange themselves. He could hear Sherrinford finish well ahead of him, the other man simply releasing a soft sigh through the process. The detective gritted his shifting teeth and, once everything was back in it’s proper place, he threw a robe about his body, not wanting to redress.
The woman’s rich laughter, rising like a bell through the hills of Germany, met his ears as he exited the bedroom with another inhale, taking the aroma of their mingled love-making with him. It was exquisite and he made a promise to himself that he would carry that perfume with him everywhere until the day he died.
“It’ll be fine,” Molly replied. “You Holmes’ have a way of things turning out just right in the end.”
“This way, Sir,” one of the officers (
“When?” he breathed, closing his eyes and hanging his head. His parents were still difficult to be around, trying to baby him to prove that they still cared for him. It was worse for Sherrinford.
With a sharp huff, the consulting detective was first into the tunnel, followed quickly by his younger sibling. The pair was quickly swallowed up by the darkness, only the sound of their trot through the runny waste punctuating their location. It was rather disgusting, slogging through muck and seeped into your shoes and soaked your trousers. At least he had that barrier - the Wolves were doing this in bare feet, the coats on their underbellies filling with it. St. Pierre was a real genius for choosing to run through here. No one in their right minds would follow him.
“I’ve always had a soft-spot for dogs,” the low baritone murmured, his mercurial eyes focused on the baby with a gentle affection. “Thomas has made me realize it again.”
He allowed the man to scroll and scan through his own webpage, his feet continuing to trace the well-worn carpet beneath his feet. They’d stopped having people come unannounced to the flat just in case he was Shifted at the time. Even if his secret would eventually come to light, he didn’t need it happening in his own home.
“I can’t do anything if it’s part of her curriculum,” the doctor sighed. “She won’t connect it.”
“HIPA VIOLATION!” he yelled, stepping between his injured sibling and the staff. “If I see a single posting on the internet or hear a word of this breathed on the street, you’ll be terminated. Are we clear?” He paused briefly, his eyes glaring about the crowd, daring them to misstep. “Now, get out!”
Sherrinford moved to the door, leaning out. “The Pups are back,” he said, stating the obvious. “They’ll be wanting to see their new siblings. They haven’t seen them yet.” He paused, looking down at them. “What do you want to do?”
Her uncle’s fiancée joined them, easy down beside them with an even bigger sigh than the one her uncle had released. His hands instantly found the small rounding of her stomach, his lips quirking in a gentle, loving smile. “And how are you, Darling?” he asked, his mouth hovering just over hers.
“Thank you, Mycroft,” he chuckled, slapping the Government agent on the shoulder. “On to the next?”
She smiled tightly. “Fine. The left one is going at it again. He only does this when he’s near family for some reason. Or at night. I don’t know why.”
He cocked an eyebrow, his lips quirking. “You think that the other K13s would be willing to Shift for the Yard?”
His younger brother, probably scenting his anticipation, gave him a small smile and a sharp nod. “Of course.”
He rolled his eyes. The drama between the pair of Wolves played out similarly every time they Turned together. Sherrinford, being Natural Born, was faster and more adept at every part of being a Wolf. However, though their common bloodline, and the fact that the younger man was his last addition to his rather unorthodox Pack, he usually triumphed. Secretly, he knew that Sherrinford was letting him win, which made the whole exercise tiresome and completely unnecessary to his human logic. His wolf instincts, however, were immediately drawn to the fore directly after a Shift and demanded the drama to play out continuously. “Must we?” he muttered, making the auburn-haired man chuckle.
Sherlock rolled his mercurial eyes but still took off running after the tiny green object. The thrill of the chase, so ingrained into his DNA, overwhelmed any bit of his human logic and, at times when his human emotions complicated things and his thoughts raced unceasingly, he loved the ability to escape to something simpler. After several passes, the doctor laughing as he romped through the grass of his parents’ yard, he abandoned the ball for something a bit more tempting: the brace of rabbits.
, the soldier mouthed as his Mate continued to blather on, his brain slowly dying of boredom as it tended to do whenever he solved a case.

“Tip your head like that. And smile with your lips pressed together?” He offered her one of those smiles and scratched the back of his neck sheepishly.
The rest of them slipped from the car, a sense of duty falling over them. “We’ll see you soon,” he stated, turning from the group to head to the flat, packages of mouthwatering food in hand. The Shift was just hours away and he could feel it in his bones.
The Wolf sniffed, knowing that he was alone with the body and the two men that knew his secret. Instantly, an eyebrow cocked. “John,” he said standing again and stepping back from the body, nostrils flared, head swinging back and forth, “Tell me what you think.”
“Alright,” Lestrade said, raising his hands and getting out of the van as quickly as he could. “I’m going to get the cigarette. Fingers crossed that we get a match, boys.”
“Positive thinking, Mycroft!” John cut in, knowing full-well that his Mate would Shift if he needed to defend himself.
He folded his hands beneath his chin, closing his eyes to focus his thoughts and run through everything in his Mind Palace again, in case he had missed something.

” she whispered. “
“Evelyn,” Sherrinford said, summoning more confidence in his voice than the detective felt at the moment, “Darling, I know that you would like to meet some of my patients, yes?”
“Can’t have ‘em catching the Wolf,” the bald man practically snarled. “Surprised that Scotland Yard’s even caring about Stevenson and send a detective out here to talk to the likes of us. I’m surprised that they haven’t just passed it off as good riddance. A dead dog is better than a living problem.”
“Oh,” she breathed, her heart beginning to race as she picked up the device and slid right. “Hello?”
, he reiterated to himself even as he wanted to tell the petite brunette everything and more. “I’m getting a new patient, yes. A type of patient that I’ve never dealt with before and he will need most of my time and attention for a while.”
Quickly covering what she realized was the truth, she blurted out, “NO! Never! I live for the family! No
), but he couldn’t shake the feeling. Either way, he could not make any connections between her and the deceased Trevor Stevenson, much to his elder brothers’ shared disappointments. He’d keep on it, of course, but he doubted that she knew anything about the murder. Which he was glad about because the last thing he wanted was to have a Hunter in his life, knowing his secret and toying with him mercilessly before dispatching him.
“An acknowledgment that the couple has shared something deeply personal and intimate with the witnesses, as well as the fact that the bonding was witnessed.. It is a show of gratitude and ends the ceremony.”
You: Sherlock blinked. He wasn't quite used to this. He hadn't flirted with someone in ages. "And apparently I've made you laugh." He relaxed his fingers, letting Greg do whatever it was that he wanted to do with their hands.
The vampire Alessandro snarled and turned, bringing John with him so that his back was pinned to the vampire’s front. He held him there with one arm around John’s chest; the other hand painfully held onto his hair, keeping John’s neck arched and open. “Oh, davvero? Non vedo alcuna pretesa su di lui. E odori divina. Sicuramente l'hai annusato?” He smirked and sniffed at John’s neck.
“I am not playing housewife,” Mycroft said icily. “Just because you can’t take it upon yourself to look after your needs or that of John’s doesn’t mean that –“
Anna smiled. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Gregory. Mycroft has been alone for too long.”
"Se il capo della famiglia Holmes ha finalmente scelto un compagno. E sembra che si ha. " He prowled towards Lestrade, but was stopped when Mycroft held up his umbrella as a barrier.
They kissed, becoming more fervent and heated. Mycroft spread his legs, cradling Greg between them. “Before we get too far,” Mycroft said, pulling away, “Promise me two things: one, that tomorrow we’ll talk about the bonding. I want to ensure that you know everything before we proceed and make it official.”
the blood pulsing in the ulnar artery just beneath the thin skin on the inside of Greg’s wrist.
Shit. Shitshitshitshit. How could this happen?!
In response, Sherlock hissed and arched up into his hand.
“Well,” John said, rubbing the back of his neck, “I guess I should go.”
“So you, what, bedded some female vampire and now you send child support?”
“That’s why it was put into that big Holmes family book, then?”
The silence was broken when John started to stand back up, reaching for Sherlock. The vampire slammed John back down and pinned his wrists against the sofa. “Didn’t say you could move,” Sherlock growled softly.
Greg glanced briefly at Mycroft with an affectionate smile. “Well thank you for coming all this way for us. I appreciate it. And I know that Mycroft does, too.”
“It is not something to be decided now,” Sherlock said lowly. He was leaning against the wall casually, sharp eyes on John.
Stranger: Sherlock saw this and continued to finger his lover open just to tease him and added a third finger, drawing out the preparation.
possible to remove should the connection become wholly undesired.” Melbourne frowned at him. “But such a procedure is…painful at best.”
“Honestly, how could that idiot believe that no one would notice that the nurse was left handed, not right handed? It was obvious.” John let Sherlock gloat, nattering away quickly at the idiocy of the general population. He smiled to himself. For all of his complaints, Sherlock clearly loved it.
“Enjoyable? Are you kidding me?” John asks. He reaches for his still-hard cock and is stopped by Mycroft.
“Now,” Sherlock says, voice deep and purring, “You get to choose what comes next. What do you want? Or maybe the better question is who do you want, hmm?”
“Thanks. I guess I needed that,” Greg said, noting that he’d drunk nearly half the bottle in one go.
Stranger: Sherlock couldn't help but smile a little, he could tell John was aroused. He let out a sigh that boarded when something was pleasurable. "No. The boredom may be setting in."
Mycroft handed it to him and picked up a glass of blood. He sipped it, watching the human doctor. “Your contract began, what, three weeks ago?”
“Ah, Sherlock! Mycroft insiste sul fatto che questo boccone saporito appartiene a voi.”
about it, Sherlock changed the subject, or rushed off. And a couple of times now, they had wanked together without Sherlock feeding from him. Did that make them lovers?
“I met his brother, Mycroft Holmes, today. The guy whisked me away in a limousine and asked questions.”
Sherlock stood up abruptly, towering over John. “And what is it that you
“He’s been trying new things in the kitchen when he has the time. And my hours are kind of crazy,” Greg said, “So I don’t get to cook as much. But I try when I’m able. Besides, we still order out plenty, too.”
You: John groaned softly and arched his neck. "That you're this gorgeous is criminal....Should I be scared?"
John cums with a grunt, fingers grasping the sheet on either side of Sherlock’s head. He spills out over Sherlock’s belly in three long spurts.
The plate of profiteroles (or cream filled things, as John calls them) is half empty, and as Sherlock picked up another one and brings it to his lips, he decided he would buy them more often.
“Why not?”
The vampire knelt on the tiled floor in front of Greg and proceeded to wash his legs. He ran his hands up, ever so temptingly close to the area between his legs.
“A fast one by the looks of it,” John said, peering at it.
“Then you’ll have to try hard to appear perfectly normal,” Mycroft replied calmly before smacking his hip.
Stranger: Sherlock watched the doctor curiously and snapped his hips forward, a harder thrust in experiment.
You: John hands slid on the wall tiles as warm water cascaded down their skin. "You feel so good in me!"
“Of course. It’s late. Besides, we did effectively buy your charity volunteer contract from Annabelle, thereby making you ours for the night.” He smiles at John.
Sherlock growled and slammed inside in a powerfully primal move to claim John as his own. John cried out, eyes closing as the vampire’s hard cock slammed into his body, fingers tightening in response around the headboard. “Do not let go, John,” Sherlock ordered.
At that moment, Mycroft approached them. “Glad to see you’re getting along.” He smiled, though Greg could detect the nervousness in his eyes.
“Yes. I had hoped it wouldn’t take him so long, but I suppose nothing has actually happened to John in the past four months.” He paused and sniffed Greg’s neck with a happy hum. “I took you, what, two months after our first date?”
He opened his eyes. “Gregory, I – I love you. Will you become my mate?”
John tilted his head to the side in blatant invitation. “Then take, Sherlock. Take what you need.” He swallowed nervously and his pulse raced. His eyes slowly rose and met the vampire’s.
“Playing? You above all people should know I don’t play,” Mycroft says calmly.
Melbourne’s eyes flickered to Sherlock and back to John. “Mr. Holmes will mark you with his personal sigil. It will be permanent, but not visible to the naked human eye.”
“Remember to stop me if necessary.”
“It’s not decent. You never did learn manners,” the older brother grumbled, glaring icily.
“Heavy use of the reses ability can be dangerous. As a precaution, I have been monitoring your breathing and heart rate while you were sleeping.”
John took a quick step back and looked into the leering eyes of Allessandro. John’s eyes narrowed and he stood up taller, widening his stance. “Do lines like that usually have people throwing themselves at you?”
“Ma lui non ha alcuna, cugino segno. Si dovrebbe prendere più cura delle tue cose. Potrebbe vengono per nuocere.”
“I suppose you’ve known them longer than me. Things going well between you then?”
“Ohhhhh,” John groans when Mycroft begins to rub his still-hard shaft.
When John withdraws his hand, he’s amused at the small whine that escapes Sherlock’s lips. Does he know how needy he looks now? “It’s alright. I just want to get these off you, ok?”
Stranger: Sherlock kissed him back, rutting against him as he stroked his cock more.
“Do you cook?”
“Fuck no,” John breathed.
The electric kettle clicked off and Sherlock approached it. He frowned. John always made the tea. It had been a rather long time since the vampire had made it.
for you.”
Stranger: Sherlock moaned a bit louder. He pressed against him more, moving his hips slowly.
“None of your business, Mycroft!”
Sherlock hovered over him, caressing John’s face and chest. “Look at you. So open. So…vulnerable. My brave John. You have no idea how weak you are next to me.” He ran the nail of his thumb slowly down the side of John’s neck. John hissed and arched his neck. “I could break you like a twig,” he hissed, “And you would be defenseless. Doesn’t that frighten you? To be naked next to a monster?”
Greg snorted. “Probably. But yeah, spanking sort of….changed things for us.”
Greg smiled and leaned up to kiss him. “I will” kiss “be home tonight. By 6. Promise.” Kiss. “And then you can explain to me what just happened.” He gave Mycroft a stern look.
“So deep,” Sherlock breathed. “I never imagined….”
Sherlock smirked. “Was there anything
Stranger: Sherlock pulled his trousers down, eyes lighting up. "Oh my." He grinned.
“This will be easier. I don’t wish to harm you, John. Please.”
“Simul sanguis,” Sherlock’s deep voice interrupted him.
John nodded in his arms and swallowed back a whimper of pain.
“Not just someone
“Eager little human,” Sherlock purred with a smirk.
John stood up and took a deep steadying breath, and tensed. Instincts honed on the battlefield told him that someone was standing behind him. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up. He covertly readied the gun in his right hand and turned around.
John resolutely refused to answer questions related to personal things between him and Sherlock. But the questions always seemed to lead, if obscurely, to the same place. It all felt like a game where he failed to understand the goal.
“Oh, davvero? Non vedo alcuna pretesa su di lui. E odori divina. Sicuramente l'hai annusato?”
A waiter refills Sherlock’s glass and he sits back, rhythmically tapping his finger on the table. If Mycroft notices, he doesn’t say. John. His John. Is standing two down the line. Sherlock has always been invited to the annual event, but has never shown up. But how could he ignore an unanticipated invitation from Mycroft?  And now he’s glaring up the stage where a line of various people associated with St. Barts who are volunteering their time – no, their humiliation – to raise money for the institution.
John howled.
Slowly, Mycroft ran his hands up the sides of Greg’s legs. He could feel the muscles, hard and strong, flex under his touch. He paused with his thumbs in the crook behind his knees. The femoral artery pulsed softly under the skin, tempting him.
“Ah. Makes it a bit difficult since you’ve got nothing to compare it to.”
The bathroom door closed and John ran his hands through his hair. He was going to be bred. By Sherlock Holmes. He frowned and shifted on his feet, toes digging into the plush carpet.
“No. But you will find that there are a number of advantages. Your aging will become almost nonexistent. You will find yourself to be healthier and more energetic.”
You: If you must stay late, I can have my car pick you up. -MH
“You don’t like my finger?”
A moment later, John heard the bedroom door close with a soft click. John let out a breath and leaned his forehead against the wall cabinet, feeling dizzy and willing his erection to go down.
Mycroft smiled. He brought the wounded hand up to his mouth and kissed the palm before claiming Greg’s lips in a passionate kiss.
John looked down Sherlock’s torso and saw that he was clearly still hard. He smirked and caught Greg’s eye.
“Keep them on,” Sherlock repeated. “Consider it an order that falls under your contract.” He dug a nail gently into John’s nipple and said in a low voice, “You may as well keep them on since I plan to add to the mess in them later.”
You: "Yesss. Please, Sherlock!" John pumped his hips forward, wanting more.
“Hmm, good point. Perhaps I’ll let you up the second day so that you can do it some more.”
Sherlock inhaled sharply at the sight. He ran his thumb over the skin and leaned in close, his lips barely touching John’s ear. “I will take more blood than before, and it will leave you weak and at my mercy, John.” John shivered and bit his lower lip. Slipping into predator mode, Sherlock smiled and led him to the sofa.
"Well, obviously it's the blonde highlighted brunette in the crowd over there that did it." His voice sharp with boredom, the words running off his tongue in an uncaring manner, like he wasn't sentencing someone to a lifetime in jail.
"Aren't you glad? This could clear your husband's name." I tried to hold back my slight anger and suspicion, I mean, who wouldn't want the chance to help clear your significant other's name? Despite how long it has been since the trial, but I knew it could just be from nerves as well, and I tried to keep that in mind.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock didn't speak as he moved up from the dead guy's shoulders to push around the individual hairs on the top of his skull. I saw him straighten up, his eyes calculating each possibility of what was possible. His eyes all of a sudden shined with knowledge as he figured out the answer speaking it out in a  dark rumble left his mouth in a sound that helped everyone understand the power of the words spoken.
“Holmes! Even for you, that is surely a leap too far, and a really outrageous suggestion to boot. Please tell me you did not so much as imply in her hearing that there was anything improper going on?”
Instant obedience was my reward. Not slavish, never that: not my Watson. As soldier and surgeon both, he knows command is three parts trust to one of authority. Why he trusts me, half-mad and wholly incorrigible as I am, is a blessed mystery into which I don’t enquire. I take it as gospel, just as I caught his hand by the wrist, then, and kissed a leisurely, feather trail from thumb pad to crook of elbow. Always the rough with the smooth, in love-making as in matrimony. Always mine, as I am his.
"It's a very personal matter that I do not care to share. No, not even with you."
To threaten her myself – with arrest, trial, imprisonment? I have been told it is not a very manly thing to do, not that I particularly covet that epithet above any other. Besides, her husband, with first hand evidence of her guilt, could not be compelled to testify against his own wife.
There is, I think, no need to grace the culprit with so much as a pseudonym. The case itself was, as Holmes put it, “worth a fee but not worth the printing ink.”
I hadn’t even to put a hand to myself before we convulsed, Holmes first and I, ever following, after. Words had left us a while back, but if anyone had passed the door, they would have needed none to hear quite well  enough what we were about.
“I know what I’m doing.”
For the first time in my life, I had put all the pieces together and all of them fitted. And Sherlock Holmes was applauding me, a small shower of ash sprinkling onto the rug as he clapped.
“You will tell me next that they publish those theories by their peculiar dances on the comb.”
“Going to bed early: perfectly unnatural. Then, if you’re willing, I propose some vigorous sodomy before day break.”
“Do my frames meet with your approval, Rector?”
"It never will, so long as humankind endures. I could chain myself to that wheel until they peel me off it dead or doddering, and still it would turn. Watson, I am not like you: so full of the milk of human kindness that they could make cheese out of you. If at times – in those powers you speak of - I am more than you, then I am less too. I have no vocation.  I have only choice. And this is mine: to set right what I can as it is brought to me, and to leave the rest to Providence."
Holmes cleared his throat and chanced his arm.
of Xenophon which no man – excuse me, I think no lady either – picks up purely for pleasure. You are using for a bookmark a postcard of the exterior of Girton College for women as it appeared before the newest buildings were complete; you were not there by then. In the bookshelves you use often, are well-thumbed works on natural science by the dozen. Incidentally, you want the translation of Strecker’s organic chemistry with annotations, not the original: I can recommend it.”
Regular readers of my work will be aware that his view of the law is a matter of honouring the spirit, whilst often disregarding the letter. Laws that stand to protect the innocent and weak, that hold to account the responsible and the strong – Holmes holds these self-evidently to be just and unbreakable, save by cads and curs. Laws that protect only ignorance and fear, or stand in the way of uncovering deeper truths and bringing about natural justice, he takes little note of and himself often breaks without a second thought.
? That’s preposterous! Everyone there knows I have to change details; mix different cases together; hide clients’ identities. It’s basic, civilised behaviour.”
“I told her that I could divert all attempts to acquire or to mine her estate – I shall have any future correspondence for ‘Mr Heacham’ dealt with by a solicitor who is in my debt – and that I could not see why that should not be the end of it. When she hesitated, I told her that she should not be ashamed of her nature. I could have meant her intelligence, her reticence, even her looks. But when she glanced, without a second thought, at the camellia garden, her fear came into focus. She loves another woman, body and soul, and has not yet altogether shaken off society’s incomprehension of nature’s true variety.”
He lifted his eyes to me and there was no mercy in them for the culprit. Poison, like deceit and betrayal, offended him especially. Human relations, which he understood as few men I have known, rarely shocked him with their failings. It made him seem cold in first light, but the more I knew him the more I glimpsed the banked fires of his spirit. He was not shocked, but he would not accept the ways of the world. He burned to see right done, to know of promises kept and family ties honoured, and to bring those who offended to justice.
“Bold?”
One must humour the eccentric - up to a point. The completely deluded is another matter altogether. A dozen cutting ripostes leapt to mind, but the only word that escaped my lips was a dry:
I have loved him so long now, and never truly knew what I was doing until that night.
“It was you. You made them drop me.”
I may say it here, in a story that shall never cross an editor’s desk nor see a letterpress. I may say that I loved him. That I love him still, that I live and will die loving him – as friend, as master, as more. As everything, body and soul.
“However,” Holmes continued, when he’d allowed Simpson’s face to drop just enough, “in your case, I must make an exception. You have done well by your patient. If you could not have cured her in life, with your help we may still cut a cancer out of the ranks of her nearest and dearest.”
So it was that when I brushed off the familiar name with a nod and a shrug, he did not press me, but only set again to grumbling complaint about the misuse of the English language, ranging far and wide from the article that had started it.
“Do tuck in, Mr Holmes.” Her smile would not, in point of fact, have been out of place on a successful turf accountant.
Like a bird of a rare and threatened species darting out of the canopy only in fits and starts, looking always for danger yet compelled to seek a mate even against my better judgment, I wheeled and soared, plunged and hovered -  but in the end alighted again and again only to a place of safety. To silence.  To waiting for the right moment, when our stock of all possible moments was steadily running out.  Middle age had surprised us from behind, then overtaken and raced ahead, taking with it Watson's waistline, dragging off my ability to stay awake for days on end, ruffling the hairs on our heads one by one as we slept and returning them grey in the morning - or not returning them at all.
"We have not yet exhausted the other end of the transaction, Watson. Consider motive, for one. I knew a man once so incensed by ornament that he banished it not only from his own house but from those of his tenants, his place of business and at last was caught attempting to remove a Sanderson Chinese wall-paper from the dining room of the East India Club. At which point he was smartly conveyed to a private asylum."
“Pot. Convenience. Porcelain friend. Mine’s gone missing.” I could see now exactly where his hand was grasping so tightly.
“Miss Heacham. I venture to suggest that the gentlemen in question may have had, at worst, mixed motives, and intended the opposite of insult. Word gets about; you are not a complete recluse. You cannot be unaware that there may be a…personal equation in these experiments?”
She folded her arms and sighed.
“As you wish.”
Holmes put a hand to the back of his neck and bent his head as under a yoke.
My friend made no answer, only lengthened his stride so that I was extremely hard put to keep up. Injecting himself like a dose of cocaine into the rushing bloodstream of London, he swept out of our front door and north along Baker Street.
From her point of view it was a
but it shows no real sign of having been read and holds pride of place in the bookcase containing those volumes meant for show, not use. Oh, do not protest, madam, every library in every country house has one. The book you

“Holmes? Have you nothing more to say?”
It was a grey morning in the Spring of '03. Let us say the 10th of April, about a quarter to eleven. Fifth cigarette of the day. Or it might have been an unseasonably dry October afternoon – the 15th, I fancy. Positively a Tuesday at any rate.  Make free with all these facts, gentlemen of the correspondence club. The newspapers that were spread all over the table were full of moral outrage: there had been a spate of vitriol throwing, in which the victims were all women of 'quality' – which is to say, money. So far there had been no serious physical injury but all had suffered spoiled clothing and the wreckage, in particular, of their hair. It was an affair into which I was bound to be drawn sooner or later: as he kept glancing at his watch, I suspected that Watson had a guinea or two at his club riding on the exact timing.
"Why did you go to an alienist?"
“All the more light to see your face when I breach you, to watch you handle yourself shamelessly, your luscious mouth hanging open and blue eyes screwed tight shut; to worship your glorious prick with my hands and my tongue; to ride you until I am spent, lathered and victorious; to sleep in your arms only to wake and want to begin again at once. To not be tired, to never be tired of having you as long as I live.”
“It’ll be fine,” the British government murmured, steering him away from the entrance. “Let’s go over these files.”
LUPUS SAPIEN
“I don’t think it’s an issue of Moon nights, Eddington,” he sighed, leaning back in his chair. “It’s the days that seem to be the issue. I’ll see what I can do, both in and out of this department. I want you to feel like you’re making a difference. You are, Eddington, you really are, but if you don’t feel that way, I’m sure I can make something happen.”
He nodded, guessing the the man would want to talk. “Please,” he said kindly but authoritatively, “Have a seat.”
“How old?” Molly asked, sounding scared for the first time during their conversation. Mycroft wrapped a comforting arm around her shoulders.
His padded feet took him down the hall, his tail swishing as his claws scraped against the well-worn wood. Once he reached the end of the hallway, he grinned at the sight before him. Stretching, his paws skidding a bit on the hardwood, he made his way back to the bassinet. His eldest brother was sitting beside it, his cool demeanor converted into a small, tender smile as his hand rose and fell with the motion of his sons’ chests. Smiling a bit to himself, he lay beside the basket, body curling about it protectively.
“Yeah, yeah,” he chuckled into the receiver. “I always knew you Holmes boys were special.”
_______________________________
The voice on the other end of the line was giving him a bit of both.
He shook his head slowly, trying to remember anything. He had been so young... “Argent, Empoisonner, Verseuchen, Silbermann, Silberkugel. Anything having to do with silver or poison usually has a root in the Hunters. They weren’t exactly subtle, many of their ancestors taking their names from their weapons of choice.”
Sherrinford trotted forward with a soft bark and a swift wag of his tail, his tongue lolling out of his impressive jaws and around the tennis balls he had in there. “I am glad to hear that, Sir,” the corporeal replied, a small smile playing at his lips. “All quiet here, though I’m sure Mr. Holmes the elder will be able to fill you in with more detail.”
He pulled the chair out for the stunning woman and gave her a small kiss on her rosy cheek, loving the warm texture. “And I, you.”
“Uncle Ford!” she said, rushing forward after kicking her shoes off in the entryway. “You look so much better!” She closed the distance as he stood, taking her into his free arm and pressing his nose into her wavy hair.
“It’s alright,” she said, gesturing to the mattress beside her with her head, her arms full of her new twins. “Come meet your nephews: Thomas and Benedict.”
Ears swiveling forward, eyes fixed on his commanding officer, the back end slowly sat and the teeth were hidden behind lupine lips. Unable to stop a small smirk, the natural born Wolf made another note. “Excellent, Eddington. Now, bark once as yes, remain silent for no as you answer these questions for me.”
-” He attempted to interrupt with little success. “
The detective rolled his eyes at the text.
“It’s a Wolf term,” the bald man explained, rolling his eyes at his supposed idiocy. “It goes to the joker of the group. He wouldn’t hurt a fly, Trev...It’s pretty unreal.”
“The same to you.” He hung the phone up before quickly tapping out an email. The more files he could get, the better. He simply hoped that they would be enough.
The wolf was nowhere in sight.
“Dr. Sherrinford Holmes,” he said, oozing charm, “Thank you for having me today.”
She laughed, throwing her head back in mirth. “You didn’t
Mycroft would plan accordingly, as would Sherrinford. He preferred his anonymous silence on the subject of Lupus sapiens. It gave him the opportunity to think.
There was a heavy inhale accompanied by widening eyes. “Imogen, how do you know about the Hunters?”
He froze, stomach sinking.
The morning light found her waking in the warm embrace of her lover. The previous evening had been one of discovery for the both of them. Sherrinford, though he never would have admitted it, had very few, if any, sexual encounters. And she quickly had discovered why.
He father, usually so unshakeable, looked a bit startled. “Whuh-what, Angel? No, no I’m not. That’s a rather silly thought, isn’t it? I’ve never really disappeared on the Full Moon, have I? I’m always here, with you.” He paused, cocking his head. “Why do you think I am?” He smiled at her, though he raised his chin slightly, like he did when he was trying to prove a point in an argument with Uncle Sherlock.
“Everyone is fine and yes, Molly is resting,” he replied, cocking his head. “Things did not go well, did they?”
“How many?” he asked softly.
She couldn’t help but release the breath that she had been holding for the last three days. The only thing that the media (or anyone else for that matter) seemed to care about was the Lupus sapiens and their leader, Sherrinford Holmes. The image of his Shift in Parliament played through every segment along with the eye witness accounts of those that had visited Baskerville and the other facilities. Everything was as she expected it to be: sterile yet adaptable, rigid yet comfortable, safe yet dangerous. The Wolves had made a good impression and with it, an increased fervor behind those that supported them as human beings. Sherrinford had had a good deal to do with that she realized. After all, he stayed with the visitors through every step of the process, according to reports, even Shifting in front of them again, upon their request.
He bit back a growl as the other man continued, “I’ve seen K9s turn against their handlers. I don’t need infectious K13s running the place.”
. If I can make a difference at a crime scene - a
The buzz of her mobile against the worn wood of her coffee table roused her from her spiraling thoughts.
“She’s been by to visit but you’ve always been asleep.”
“Inadequate? You? Imogen. You are amazing.” Sherrinford beamed at her, his smile radiating joy despite it’s lack of visible teeth. “And everything smells delicious.” His lips met hers before he drew back and pulled a chair out, gesturing her into it. “Thank you for seeing me. And for cooking.”
He shook the ridiculous idea away, Sherrinford, in all his wolf wisdom, had told him that he would suffer no ill-effects except potential limited mobility and some residual pain. He would not become a Wolf from St. Pierre’s Bite.
He bit back a growl, resenting being called a ‘her.’ But then again, his youngest niece and nephew did not know about the Wolves, much less that two (
, he mused, noting that several members of the assembly were perspiring rather profusely at the moment. He clapped his hands together. “Any questions before we get started?”
He shook his head, his mouth occupied by his breakfast. Swallowing, he added, “You should be there. You’re handling this evening, after all, and you should be aware of the faces that go with the names.”
- in his home and near his son (Or any of his children, for that matter).
Sherlock paused at the end of the hallway, making him stop as well. Ridiculous etiquette, he huffed. He was Alpha, just like his brother (And his other brother, if he was Turned). Playing second fiddle was not entirely his style, but it had to be, for tonight anyway.
“Because, Silly,” he twin said, crossing his arms over his chest protectively, “If Uncle Sherrinford is discovered, then people will be mean to him and to our new baby brother and we can’t have that! They’re nice!”
The wolf circled around her, brushing her legs and stomach before stopping on her right side, the thick nape of his neck offered to her hands. “Thanks, Sherrinford,” she murmured, wrapping her fingers in the thick, outer fur, before taking a few steps toward the stairs. “You’re being all too good about all of this.”
For a sweet second, he lost the sound of the assembly. It came rushing back to him in a roar. Shouts of shock, calls of indignation, gasps of terror. His unveiling of his true self, years in the making, must have looked like something from a monster film. To him, it was simply living - inhaling on two legs and exhaling on four.
