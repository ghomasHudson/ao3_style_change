“When we see you with guys, it’s not you we look at. It’s them. Sure, you know how to kick ass, but were only men. We get a little possessive when people we don’t like come close to our family. That includes you.”
Natasha looked over to Sam, the man shifting his weight between his feet, eyeing the FBI agents suspiciously.
Tony tried to placate.
Clint rolled his eyes but obliged, leaning the pair back towards his place, listening to the events of their road trip. He wasn’t surprised; he knew that any of them, least of all Steve, would not take well to elongated separation from the family. He yearned to be a part of it as well; to see Bucky wearing shorts, Sam putting together a homecooked country buffet, Natasha laughing with little ones as they danced across the room. But he knew why he couldn’t and hearing the stories secondhand was more than enough for now, filling him with joy and a slight pang of wistfulness, thinking of his family surviving the only way they could now.
Tony stopped his movements and looked at him with a raised eyebrow, not doubt amused by his awkwardness. He seemed to take pity on Steve, however, stepping closer as well. Steve was just about to put his hands around Tony’s hips when a shrill chirp sounded through the room. Tony sighed, letting his forehead fall onto Steve’s chest. Blindly, he reached behind him, his hand wandering aimlessly across the table for his phone. Steve snorted, pulling Tony closer as he reached his own arm out, pushing the phone into Tony’s questing hand.
“Ms. Potts, I’m very sorry for my friend- ” Steve started before colliding with Bucky. He made a small noise, trying to right himself as he peered around what caused his friend to stop.
Pietro scoffed, looking out his window. “You always tell me to do my best. I guess you don’t really mean it. Why can’t I do the best that I can do?”
Barnes hissed.
“Are you willing to take that risk?” When Steve didn’t answer, Loki continued. “You wanted my advice? Well, here it is. Give them Stark.”
Looking closely, Steve could see the heavy rings that hung under Tony’s eyes, contrasting with his tan skin. It surprised him how young Tony looked like this, the lines of age and stress smoothed away in his relaxed state.
Tony thought.
The biggest question was how the corn field was able to burn in such a way that only destroyed part of the crops, the burnt plants creating a picture on the ground.
The Monger had asked, showing Pierce a fake tooth.
“I do,” whispered Steve.
of people to get a picture with the World’s Largest Mailbox.”
From: Sam Wilson
Steve huffed fondly, smiling at the brunette sitting across from him. “Not what I was thinking, but I’ll keep that one of the back burner, okay?”
Tony looked down at the map. “It’s my birthday. Date and time.”
Bucky just shrugged. “What?”
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispered. “I shouldn’t have put you at risk like that.”
Clint pushed him back with enough force to send Tony flopping fully onto his bed. “You look like you would make it about ten feet. Just use this one; I don’t have any use for it.”
“We have to go into witness protection, but we have to go separately.” Tony watched Steve swallow a lump around his throat. “That means we won’t be together. We can’t.”
“Steve.” He could feel the heat of Tony’s gaze. He stole a peek at his copilot, catching the phone in Tony’s lap, open in the GPS app. “When you took over driving, we have about three hours to go. Wanna tell me why now after I’ve woken up, we’re now four hours away?”
Rhodey made a move to protest, but was cut off by a voice from above. “Are you ladies done fighting?”
“You’re just not thinking positively.”
“What you need is to get out of my way before I stop playing nice and expose you to everyone in this room.”
“Zola,” Steve breathed.
“Of course. Do you require anything, Sir?”
“I’ll be fine,” Tony said proudly, blatantly ignoring how his arm still felt like fire from when Barnes grabbed him.
“Look, I know it’s you!” the teacher yelled, stepping towards Pietro.
“Both of them? Together?”
Barton sighed, his shoulders slumping in defeat. “This is why Nat should have taken care of this. I’m saying I was wrong, dickhead. That we were wrong. About you.”
But Stark just nodded. “Okay.”
Steve pulled back a glove to look at his watch. “Yea, I’ve still got time.”
Steve said ever so softly.
of it hitting the body. Steve had been using it for years; it was basically just an extension of his arm now.
“Because I’m your favorite Commando?”
“Well, if you killed him like you were supposed to, you’d still have a face.”
he reminded himself, clapping Steve’s shoulder and squeezing it tightly. “Thanks, Cap,” he answered quietly.
Phil’s head flopped down on his pillows, groaning when his body protested the harsh movement. “I don’t know what you want from me, Sir.” His eyes lazily tracked the ceiling, trying to make out any semblance of where he was. It didn’t look like any time of hospital he had seen before, what with the room’s severe lacking of the color white. This place was dark, the only sort of light coming for strung up industrial lights, the beams showing specs of dust and God only knows what else dancing around in the dank room.
,” he choked out, voice cracking.
Pierce flopped back down behind his desk, idly flipping through the file. His man was right; Stark had left The Captain’s name right in the open. While he didn’t straight up go and tweet the name to the internet, anyone with two opposable thumbs could delve through the web and find his name easily. Tony Stark had really outdone himself. It wouldn’t be long before everyone knew the name of-
“Yeah, you’re right, Steve. That’s because Indiana’s state motto is ‘
“Rhodey,” Tony started. “It wasn’t your fault.”
- these names and files that are mentioned will play a HUGE part later in the story, especially with Pierce and our new villain
“Ah, yes, Captain Incognito. But maybe that’s what you’re missing: a flair for the dramatic. You need to strut.”
like slipping on a favorite worn-down sweatshirt after pulling it from the dryer. Like ice clinking against each other within a glass of sweet tea, or a callused finger running along the grip of a gun. But it wasn’t home.
(See the end of the chapter for
Everyone thought of Captain America and thought of purity; the figure head that always knew right from wrong. A national icon. A hero. How wrong they all were.
Clint’s head snapped up. “It’s true then. He is HYDRA?”
The man looked up as Steve approached. “Hey, man,” he answered sullenly.
Watching TV was out, as it would end with him either being reminded or recent events, or with him on the shopping channels buying yet another ‘miracle product’. He could try reading, as his mother had a library built in each of their properties for her. But it was never really Tony’s thing. It was more
“Then why isn’t Tony here?” Steve shouted.
“We can’t,” Bucky disagreed. “We show him these photos and he’s gonna know immediately who we got them from.”
Clint shuddered. Tony had survived Afghanistan, palladium poisoning. Hell, he even chucked a nuke into the great beyond. But all it took was a simple business man to take the great Iron Man down. Finnegan Thorpe had killed Tony Stark.
Steve blinked, not even realizing the beating had stopped. After a while, Steve had focused in on Tony's eyes, making sure that they were still open.
Pierce gave a sharp grin. “Glad we settled that.” He gestured to the chair across from his desk. “Please, sit. Let’s talk about our next move.”
“You’re slowing down, Stevie,” soothed Bucky. No matter how much Steve yelled as he fought back, Bucky kelp his voice calm, never yelling back.
he thought to himself. Getting out alive was a pipe dream now - at least he'd be bringing The Rings to hell with him.
There was a problem Steve did not account for. Where exactly does one park a quinjet in New York?
“But?”
Steve took to the streets with his shield. Vigilante justice took over his world. Safety wasn’t really a concern at this point.
Steve rolled his eyes. "Well, I'm sorry to say you'll be disappointed then. So, come on. Show me what you got. You'll be getting nothing from me."
“You don’t shut up. I’ve been going into your office every day. And every day you sit there, looking like you’re just waiting for me to kill you. I make you nervous. So you prattle on and on about God knows what. You not knowing how to swim slipped out. You said something about how Howard never bothered to have you learn, that he thought it was a waste of time. Said that it was just simple buoyancy and momentum; that if you couldn’t figure it out if you were stuck in water, then you deserved to drown.”
“It took me a while to get a handle on you. But you’re a spy. You’re always so calculating, so distant. But you aren’t untouchable. I know you.”
Pierce idly picked at one of his fingernails. “Oh, Stane’s already taking care of that.”
Steve wiped a hand down his face, relaxing as he felt Tony’s comforting touch pull him into a hug.
Tony shook his head. “Whatever. This is just another thing to deal with. The Ten Rings, HYDRA, and now the FBI. I’m sure we’ll figure something out, we always do. I’m sure somebody knows somebody whose neighbor’s brother in law works with someone who knows someone in the FBI,” he blubbered, pacing around the room. “We’ll find someone. It can’t be that hard.”
It’s different than a normal king size.”
“Now what,” Sam whispered.
Clint’s head snapped up to see Thor approaching him the hallway. The huge blonde swept Clint up in a crushing embrace. “Where the hell have you been? I was starting to fear the worst, my friend.”
Steve sighed softly, not wanting to get up from the cocoon of warmth he was surrounded in. However, he knew that there was work to be done, so he took one last look at Tony’s sleeping form before slipping out of the bed, making sure to tuck the corners of the blanket back around the sleeping brunette.
“Then what is the point, Tony!” Steve roared. “Or are you just gonna stand there and list off all the things I’m doing wrong?”
“It doesn’t have to be physical to be fucking assault, Sparky,” Clint hissed. “He had no right to say those things.”
“I was hoping you could tell me,” said Fury. “You were the head Librarian. What sort of things did the SSR have?”
“Hey, hey, hey,” Tony tried to soothe her. “The Captain isn’t a problem anymore. I sorted it out.”
-------------------------
“You know,” Barnes continued. “I may only have one arm but that doesn’t mean my eyes don’t work. You don’t rotate the men watching us, so I see the same faces on the street regardless of where we set up camp. Coulson called and he knows that someone in the force has been paid off, because no one is investigating the bomb further. And, last but not least,” he added, gesturing to Tony’s monitor, “those are Steve’s messages to Thor to set up a meeting with Loki. You didn’t minimize your screen,” Bucky finished with a smirk. “So you can tell yourself whatever will help you sleep at night, but you can’t lie to me.”
“Of course you did,” smiled Steve.
Nick smiled as a fireman walked over to him.
“Make something up.”
“I don’t plan on dying today.”
“Look- ” the crook started when a sharp blast from the back of the building had the man dropping his gun and flying into the westward wall. Steve lowered his shield immediately, the familiar sound of a repulsor putting him at ease as a shadow stepped into the light.
Who would have guessed that the blessing of being Steve Rogers was actually nothing more than a curse?
She saw Sam stiffen to her left, the man tilting his jaw upwards. “You’re not serious.”
An abhorred gasp sounded to their left, and both men turned to see a middle-aged mother scowling at them, her hand yanking at her snickering adolescent son. An apology started to form on Steve’s lips, but Bucky interjected. “Come on, lady. It’s not like he hasn’t seen that shit all over the internet already.”
Still looking at the two men, Tony could see the exact moment The Captain saw the treat he left for them. The Captain stared at the empty sugar bag and water bottles, and then back to the car. Tony could barely hear him shout, “He’s ruined the gas tank! Get another car!”
The faint rustling.
“It won’t,” Coulson stated. “There are no gaps, no loopholes, nothing. I wouldn’t put any of you at risk like that if I didn’t know for sure.”
Steve chastised, turning a deeper red.
“Steve,” Tony returned in exasperation. He reached up and grabbed Steve’s face between his hands. “Look at me. I’m still here.” He placed a lasting kiss on Steve’s lips. “I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you.”
Steve thought to himself. Fury obviously had to have known about the involvement of The Captain of The Commandos and Tony Stark to at least some degree. But, with Hill’s stint in the lobby proved that Fury must also know what he looks like. So while part of their bargaining chip was gone, they still had Steve’s name to offer.
The two sprinted off down the hallway, narrowly missing the flying gun shots.
“You meet with Fury?” Natasha cut it, stopping the pair’s argument in its tracks.
“My name is Raza.”
“Yeah?”
“Good weird, or bad weird?”
“Mr. Stark. I just need to ask you a few questions," Fury continued.
“No, JARVIS. Common floor. I need a drink. Or ten.”
“What the fuck is he even doing here?” Clint whispered to no one, throwing on a pair of shoes and stomping out the door, down his porch, and across the driveway to meet the newcomer.
Bucky grinned. “You like? Brand new, rides like a charm. That is, it would, if the fucking thing would start,” he finished, kicking the motorbike. He looked back up at Steve. “You going to the club?”
“Of course. Call if you need anything.”
Pierce anymore. You didn’t honestly think that he was our ally, did you?”
“I don’t mind waiting,” Steve replied as he smoothed out the blankets that covered Tony, tucking them tightly against his sides. Sides that were too small,
Tony took a deep breath and sat up again, slowly this time, trying to keep from jostling his arm. He eyes started to scan the room curiously, taking in his new surroundings. It was nothing much; at any other point in his life, Tony might call it fit for derelicts. But now, he could only seem to describe it as homey. Everything was so worn down and overused that it seemed to give off a certain warmth. It was like a glimpse behind the curtain, the idea of a simple domesticity hidden in the lives of hardened criminals. The desk, presumably The Captain's, was overflowing with files, notes, and scraps. Books of every genre were crammed into a crooked bookshelf, looking like it was one nudge away from falling over. Tony smiled, imagining members of the team curling into the armchair to read, the room silent except for the scratching of paper, the hulking Captain hunching over the desk, scribbling in a tight scrawl.
“Jesus!” he shouted, grabbing onto Clint before he could stumble over. “What the hell has gotten into you?”
“Tony, you’re in pain, and- ”
Tony shrugged. “Didn’t do a very good job.”
Horns blared and tires screeched, Tony thrown into the side of the car as Clint barely missed a head-on collision. “Phil’s, there?” he asked, face drawn and pale. The car jumped forward without Tony’s response, Clint drawn to the chance of seeing the other man.
“Only Stark knows,” mused Thor, leaning back in his chair. “He was at the warehouse with The Captain, and now he’s not. Steven won’t even talk about what happened. What if Stark was in on it? What if he was the one who- ”
Tony stared up at the dark ceiling in his room.
Sure Clint was annoying as could be, with a childlike manner that always made Steve want to strangle the man by lunchtime. But Clint was a star; he’s always a shining beacon of hope. He never pities Steve when he finds himself down, just distracts him bad jokes and rough sparring sessions to save Steve from his own head.
He heard Tony sigh. “Pietro, I’d like to think I didn’t raise an animal. Steve, help the carnivore cut his meat, will you?”
“Why the hell not?” snapped Bucky.
There was a short silence before, “
“Not a problem, dear. You two cuties enjoy yourself.”
Tony must have told him, if their previous conversation was any indication. Steve wasn’t upset that he did, Bucky needed to hear the news almost as must as Clint, but there was still a painful tug in his chest that he wasn’t the one to do it. Seeing as this was the first time that Bucky was confronting Steve – if he could even call it that – about Phil, even when the pair were alone together after Tony left for the gala, it didn’t bode well. Bucky had quite the reputation of going and licking his wounds in private. And if Tony was the one to spill the beans to him, even with their newfound olive branch, Bucky wouldn’t have allowed himself to be that vulnerable in front of the other man. Bucky would rarely do it in front of Steve.
Tony flared his nostrils before looking back at The Captain.
“Cap!”
Pierce listened as the hours ticked by as he sat staring at the door. Stane knew about Steve Rogers. Any advantage he thought he had was gone now.
“Steve, wait.”
And with that, he walked away. Tony stood shock still, the voices around him muffling, time slowly.
Yes, everyone in New York knows about Tony’s little scuffle with The Captain and his men. Then again, there was no way Tony could hide it when they basically had a battle royal in the middle of the streets just three days ago. Turns out, despite how hard he had tried, he still ended up trending on Twitter anyway.
Steve looked away with a small blush on his face. He looked even better like that.
Steve clenched his jaw. "How the hell did you get in here?" He asked, tightening his grip on his gun.
“We don’t have a minute, Steve!”
“Who knows what goes through their heads,” sighed Tony. “Alright,” he continued, patting Bucky on the back. “You’re all done. Don’t go too crazy; my baby needs time to adjust to your Neanderthal body.”
The man looked up at Steve with bleary eyes. “Well, th-then what- ”
He thought of Tony briefly, a bright smile and warm eyes flashing through his mind.
“Empty threats my ass. Do you even know who I am? Listen, there’s still time to save you from the oncoming and definitely fatal embarrassment. How about we just part ways now and I’ll let you walk out of this alive; I’ll even give you the added bonus of minimal maiming. See? I’m nice like that.”
Tony rolled his eyes fondly. “Fashionably.”
Tony refused to answer, bowing his head to play with his hands instead.
Steve took a deep breath as he started the car, messing with his bowtie that remained stubbornly crooked, regardless of him messing with it for what seemed like the millionth time. A slight breeze filtered in through his car windows, the fresh air calming the blonde. It was a perfect day, both clear and bright. A day that was saved for post cards. Steve smiled, eyes closing as he relished in the comforting warmth of the sun. He didn't think that he was superstitious, but he wouldn't refute the weather as a sign, no doubt symbolizing the future that lay before him.
Steve didn’t want to play her game today. He looked up at her, staring into her eyes. Like kaleidoscopes. Mesmerizing.
“Just, relax for a second, and let us explain.” When Bucky didn’t answer, Tony continued. “Steve isn’t scot free, he’s supposed to still be on lockdown, just like you. Why Fury decided he could stay with me is anyone’s guess. But this plan on coming to find you was already in the works before Steve showed up. He’s only here because I knew he would tie himself to my front bumper if I tried to leave him at home.”
She hadn’t pressed. She brought him into the bathroom and shaved him. Her hands shook and the shave was uneven, but neither of them said anything. He had just dragged her closer, wrapping his whole arm around her waist, covering the spots where both hands used to sit on her hips.
Tony groaned, flopping his head against their truck’s hood. “You
“Yes, you do. Because you know you did it.
Tony didn’t know what he was expecting, but it sure as hell wasn’t that. A surge of jealousy coursed through him. The bond that Barnes had with The Captain was almost one you hear in in story books. Tony would never have that; has
“Then I’ll say it. Was any of it real? Or was I just an added bonus for blondie over there?” Stark snapped.
“Delmar didn’t give us much. All I got from him is that the man who delivered the bombs to SI should be at this address.”
A jewelry store. They’d crashed into a fucking jewelry store. Steve immediately yanked back the hand that was resting on a display case that he’d used to stand up, but that just turned to bite him in the ass as blaring alarms sounded, bright spot lights snapping on.
He was beautiful.
Obadiah Stane waltzed out of the closed down restaurant, harsh wind billowing past him as he scanned the street before him. A black SUV caught his eye, the man ambling over to it quickly.
Steve scowled as he watched her walk back over to the van, an agent holding a bullet proof vest out for her. He assumed that the FBI wouldn’t allow them to arm themselves for this, lest they try anything funny, but from the looks of it, he and Bucky wouldn’t be getting anything that would count as added protection. Why would they? He had already cashed in the rest of his secrets to Fury; all they needed was for him to identity the SSR files, and honestly, they could probably figure that out on their own. He was a loose end now; it probably worked out better for Fury if he and Bucky didn’t survive. Less mouths to feed when they were sent into witness protection.
Steve nodded, gun back at the ready. He wanted nothing more than to call out for Tony, but he bit his tongue. He didn't know who else was down here. The last thing he needed was to give away their position and put them in danger. Or worse, put Tony in danger.
Steve knew it would be useless in the end. There would never be enough words to convey to Tony what he was feeling right now. What he had felt as Tony’s life slipped away in his arms.
Steve barely had time to react. He heard Tony shout an expletive before the man was jumping in front of Steve as the bomb exploded. A burst of heat had both him and Tony flying to the floor, and then there was nothing.
The two men stared at each other long and hard. Pierce sighed, looking down at his hands. “This needs to be dealt with. Hammer,” he nodded to the other man, “call The Monger. He needs to know about this.” Hammer nodded before rushing out of the office.
into his chest.
He could see Barton clench his jaw, but dutifully raise his gauntleted hand. Tony’s vision was blurred, but he trusted that Clint would be able to hit his mark.
“You can’t be serious,” whined Tony. He looked at Steve, only to get a blank face in response. “I don’t need the three of you hovering over me.
Iron Man. Tony, who puts up a good front, but in the end, is just a lonely, broken man. Tony, who had his life ripped away by his lover, left alone to die.
Tony groaned. “Well, that’s just great. You owe me a new pair of shoes,” Tony snapped, jabbing a finger at the smirking Captain.
Not that she would, her gaze caught between the two men that finally turned to face her.
He had been so cold; it was as if the ice was in his veins. It was all encompassing, like Death’s stony hand had been the one to catch his fall instead of the frigid waters. He didn’t remember screaming; the shock had been too much, his reaction time freezing like the rest of his extremities. But it had been anything but quick. The cold was misleading; nothing more than a spider trapping him instantly in its web, only to play with him before finishing the job. It seeped into him; first the skin, then the bones, finally to the soul. It taunted him, laughing as it took everything from him as he lay paralyzed. There was no white light, there was no fade to black. No virgins came to take him away, no man stood waiting for him at a pearly gate. There was just the cold. Nothing but the cold.
“FRIDAY?”
to be. He had survived a run in with the East River in the middle of winter, so of course he could survive a little bomb. Besides, if Tony’s math was right, which it always was, he took most of the blast by jumping in front of Steve. And while Tony would normally use that instance to get bragging rights for all eternity, he wasn’t feeling much like celebrating.
“Bow it is,” Clint nodded, already setting up the large recurve bow.
“No,” Tony lied with a moan, barely able to get it out before his lips were crashing with his. If he needed any final confirmation that his was really Steve, he got it. Kissing Steve always came with a rush that he could never explain, no matter how angry at him he was. He held Tony tightly, reassuring him with each kiss, each touch, but it wasn’t enough.
Tony drained the rest of the glass, shuddering at the thought of Steve out there in danger without him.
This idiot has no idea what he's gotten himself into. “You said you know who I am, yes? Then you should know that I’m a very powerful man with very powerful friends. This isn’t my first rodeo, kid. I know how this plays out. Spoiler alert, you end up at the bottom of the Hudson.”
“I, uh, had to tell him some stuff. About what’s happened,” he said ringing his hands.
Leaning down and grabbing at Barnes’s only arm, Tony pulled him up into a fireman’s carry. “Come on now, Barnes. You need to stay alive for me to blackmail you about this later.”
Bucky shrugged. “Did you see you out there? You were doing enough damage yourself. Now listen up, Cap. This isn’t then. This is
Steve huffed. “You couldn’t scare away that hobo last night, so sorry to burst your bubble, but it’s not doing much for me either.”
“I wasted an entire morning at the mall with Mr. Indecisive over there,” Bucky grumbled. “I made him buy me that as recompence. Now, there’s at least two cashiers out there who think Captain America is a weirdo who like to pee in golf clubs.”
Rogers scoffed. “No. Not the one you’re looking for.” Rogers raise his gun and pointed it at Tony.
Steve was nearly vibrating with energy as Sam pulled over a block from the fire, whose flames were reaching over the rest of the buildings. From the lack of red and blue, Steve sighed in relief, knowing that they’d beat the police there.
Running back down those steps would be a kamikaze mission; Steve needed to keep the shooting aimed at him. Which of course would be easy. If he had any bullets left. Steve stared down at the useless gun in his hands. He could hear Hammer’s men moving around the warehouse, most likely getting ready to flank him. Their heavy steps drew closer and Steve found himself out of time, out of options. Steve looked frantically around, looking for anything that could help, when something caught his eye.
Steve deflated, his hand dropping from the door handle. “You and me both, Buck,” he sighed. “But will not saying anything be any better? I mean, if we’d never told Tony we loved him, would we even be here? He didn’t say anything then, and he probably won’t say anything now. It might not be in our best interest, but if something’s wrong, that has to take precedence, right? No matter the consequences?”
Tony balled his hands into fists but refused to respond. The last thing he needed was a bullet to the head.
Steve leaned down and buried his nose in Tony’s mop of hair. He had used Bucky’s shampoo this morning. Steve wasn’t sure if it was the actual scent or knowing that it was one of theirs, but Tony using either of their products always ended up smelling better on him.
Yinsen tried to answer but stopped, a coughing fit racking through the smaller man’s body.
Fun fact: 'Go Ugly Early' was actually used at the speakeasy that I live by.
But now? Steve had broken him. He could see it in Bucky’s eyes.  No doubt the rest of the crew had that same haunted look about them.
“Sure thing,” Tony agreed. “I’ll call you later.”
Since then they had more than a few donations, a simple thank you from their loyal listeners, but it was never anything substantial. Not that Steve ever minded; he knew that their podcast was a small fish in a very large pond that was the world of broadcasting.
“Now scram, Моя голубка,” said Natasha, tapping the end of Emily’s nose. “I will see you next week.”
“What is it?” asked Hammer. “Did you catch them?”
Immediately, Tony tensed, head thrashing in the barrel as water slipped over the side. He was drowning. “I’ll kill him,” the voice of their captor hissed. “Tony Stark means nothing to me. I will kill him in front of you and you’ll take it to the grave knowing it was all your fault.”
“No,” Bucky argued. “You don’t talk about Vienna so HR doesn’t
Rhodey just smiled. “Did what?”
Steve sighed. “That’s all you know.”
“I don’t mean to bother you, but I’ve been up and down this neighborhood all day, checking all the houses.”
Steve trudged further along the bank, pulling his coat farther up against his neck. He scanned the shore line and out into the frozen waters, looking for any movement.
“Hearing aids, made by yours truly. It’s my first model, so don’t bash them too bad. If everything works correctly, and I know it will, you should have better hearing than Steve. They’re even linked directly to the comms, so you should have no problem being left out of the loop. Hope you don’t mind how small they are; I just figured you wouldn’t want everyone to know you have them.”
Stark shrugged. “You said it yourself, Captain. You’ve got Asgard on your side.”
Steve grabbed her hand, and pushed them away. “I’m gonna give you some money. I’ve been stashing my silver, I’ll give you half. You and your brother Clint can get out of here.”
it to him. And if one thing had remained the same in the last century, it was how quickly church ladies can spread rumors. A half hour hadn’t passed before the whole congregation knew, judging by the long stares and hurried whispers he got as he passed. That, and the few phone numbers that managed to slip into his pocket while he was there. “It wasn’t funny,” Steve grit out. “I can never go back there again!”
“You don’t think Pierce would leave behind a skeleton crew for security?” Bucky asked.
“Why?” she asked plainly.
“I don’t see anyone from the old days, Steve,” Sam sighed. “Excluding present company, of course, but we’re already pushing our luck.”
Bucky shot him a feral grin, his eyes turning cold as ice before ghosting out of the room.
“You will,” Clint answered firmly.
Steve nodded. “Thanks. I just don’t want to take any chances today.”
There was a still moment in the building, unspoken
“Kill him.”
“I need you to tell me that I’m wrong. I need you to make sure that HYDRA didn’t survive.”
“You’re staring again.”
None of this explained why he was here. “…Tony?” he asked, not sure if the man was a hallucination.
Riley had hated everything about that world. The very same world that eventually killed him.
with his assigned handler.
“You said it yourself. I just can’t get enough of you, Barton,” came the drawled response.
The poor kid didn’t stand a chance.
“I feel like this is supposed to make me feel better.”
While most would think of it as any ordinary name, in the mob world, it was anything but. If Hammer or The Monger caught wind of who The Captain really was, it would mean bad news for Pierce. It wouldn’t be long before one or both of them went to just snatch Rogers off the street before Pierce even had time to think about making a move. No, Steve Roger’s name was the only thing keeping Pierce in the game, the only thing keeping him in charge.
Sam snorted. “No kidding. Don’t worry; Fury will have him in cuffs in no time.”
“That’s not it,” Steve continued. “That’s not the whole reason.”
Hammer’s voice filtered through the phone.
Pepper stilled, looking down at the package. “Is there a return address?”
Loki, of course, thought he was a mad man for offering up himself, but Steve paid him no mind. A few idle threats and Loki was texting him the best possible location for where he could find the current head of HYDRA. It was disconcerting how much the man knew, but Steve knew Loki’s business was information. This would be the best chance he had to finally ending this. Steve sucked in another breath and continued through the sand.
Tony hummed in response, but didn’t offer any other instruction, intent on burying his head into Steve’s neck. Steve didn’t push while he started to trek around the house, idly poking through the lavishly decorated rooms to find one with a bed. He walked up the stairs, murmuring quietly to Tony as he did, but Tony never responded. All he could do was focus on the steady heartbeat echoing through the chest he was leaning on.
Street three weeks ago at 3:42 PM?”
“You boys ready?” Hills voice sounded, interrupting their banter.
“A fact I exploited to do my job,” responded Iron Man.
“Give me a gun,” snapped Tony. “Bet he wouldn’t see that coming.”
“Just go check.”
Steve brought a hand up and tapped lightly against Stark’s cheeks. “You still with me, Stark?”
“Something must have happened at the warehouse,” inserted Natasha.
It was gone. It was all gone.
“And that is?”
“And neither are you,” Barnes snapped. “This isn’t you messing around with scrap in the basement, this is serious! That thing is going in your chest and is supposed to keep your heart beating. Don’t you think that risking your life would require a little more planning?”
“Natasha can take better care of herself than any of us ever could, and you know it,” Tony huffed. “Besides, I know you’ve seen these.” He held up his phone to show the group message between the team. The last six messages came were from Wilson, only a single word each:
he had thought to himself. Steve had thought he passed with flying colors each time –
Phil’s stomach churned, glad he wouldn’t be one of them. He could still remember the way Clint had shaken in his arms, so distant and lost. Phil had never seen him like that.
“Buckle up, Stark. Get ready for a date of a lifetime.”
“If you didn’t want to cook, then you shouldn’t have offered,” Tony pestered.
Pepper took out her phone, scrolling through her emails. “This past Monday morning.”
Rhodes held up a hand to stop Steve. “I don’t want to hear another word.”
Hill raised her gun again, this time pointing at Steve. “I could just kill you now, wiping you and your loop from my problems. But we like to keep it interesting. You’re going to get in the car with me, and I’m going to take you to the doc. We’ll cut you up until you are just a stump of a man when you’re loop finally comes. Then we’ll kill your loop and make sure you end up as nothing but a fucking vegetable.”
So Steve visited his grave every Sunday.
He started to guide Tony to the door. “Wait,” Tony stopped him. He walked over to his lab table, stumbling slightly, and grabbed his gauntlets.
“Survivors?”
asked her.”
“Trade secret,” Bucky winked.
“Quit playing around.”
The man let out another quiet chuckle, rubbing his eyes with his fingers.
“I didn’t ask that,” Tony snapped. “I asked if they knew who you were. If they know what you did.”
“Did he tell you The Monger is?” Tony asked.
“-be dead, I swear to God. If you’re dead, I’m going to bring you back just so I can kill you myself,” he heard. “Tony, come on!”
“But you weren’t. You saved his life, Steve.”
Tony grinned, moving to change the subject. “So, you’ve got some pretty cramped quarters over in Brooklyn. Guys have a heist coming up?”
Tony beamed, leading him over to where the benches were, pushing Steve down, the blonde groaning with satisfaction as powered jets sent pressure against his back. He peered up at Tony, waiting for him to follow.
“Oh no, I already know what I want. I saw it when we were walking in.”
Phil just shrugged. “Not like I haven’t seen Clint look any better,” he said with a small smile. But Steve could see the small cracks in it, the slight tugging of the lips more a grim line than a smile at all, really.
Steve frowned down at the radio that was resting on the dash of the car. Steve had gotten it months ago, begging Sam to let him keep it in his car for fear of Tony finding it. Every Wednesday, they’d pile into Sam’s car and wait, listening for the city’s calls of distress.
Here was the next part of his day, where he wasted time by looking in each direction, pondering on how he would waste his time today. Each corner of the house offered him some semblance of solace, but Tony could never find himself able to get lost in anything.
He was Tony Stark. He could find anyone and their mother with a flick of his wrist. He could dismantle government agencies if he wanted, hell, even a small nation if he put his mind to it.
Tony sighed, shoulders deflating. “Well, then what do you suggest? Not gonna lie, I wouldn’t exactly object to your boys tossing him around in there like a chopped salad.”
“Loki.”
“Give him a break, Rhodey,” Tony chided, rolling his eyes. “The poor man hasn’t gotten any in three months.”
But they were different. Angry.
Pepper’s eyes softened, but she slowed their sways to a halt. “Rhodey and I are your family too, you know,” she said in response.
"A few empty shipping warehouses and abandoned factory used back in World War II to melt down scrap metal."
“I can’t remember my mom’s face. She died when I was young. I just know she used to run her hands through my hair. Like this.” Steve grabbed Natasha’s hair, and pushed them into his blonde locks.
Steve collapsed to the ground and sobbed.
Tony froze at the admission, fury raging beneath his skin, everything starting to click into place. That man had taken everything from his. His parents, his company.
Tony tilted his head, as if to ponder. “There was something else, wasn’t there,” he murmured, tapping his fingers against his chin. “Ah, yes. Just so happens that I’ve got family at each of these destinations. If we’re going to continue with this little tryst, you’re going to have to get my family’s approval, right?” Tony questioned. “That is, if you’re interested,” he added with another shrug of his shoulders.
Tony thought to himself.
“Umm, I-I guess I just lost track of time. I’m really sorry, Mr. Stark.”
Coulson’s plea had tormented him the whole way home and followed him into bed with Steve. It wasn’t hard for him to see that history was repeating itself – a huge secret that would make or break the two of them.
“Stay safe,” whispered Clint. After waiting for Phil to take off, he trekked slowly back to base.
Steve wanted to be sick. He felt his chest tighten and his vision turn sideways as he fell to his knees.
If Steve couldn’t swim, God only knows how long he could hold his breath. What if there was a current? What if hypothermia kicked in?
“What do you want?”
Clint finally let a sob loose, Bucky’s laughter still ringing in his ears.
“So this location that we have. It might be The Captain’s actual hideout?”
he whispered, knees wobbling. “No, no, no.”
“Which is why,” continued Steve, “they need to be informed. We might have people out looking for him, but the police have resources we don’t have. I want every available set of eyes out looking to bring Tony home.”
Tony huffed, buckling down for a familiar argument. “You couldn’t have known what was going to happen. If I remember correctly, you were already taking care of the mess at
Tony snorted. “You know, when you started telling me that fifteen years ago, I believed you. Now? Not so much.”
He knew it had to be something about Phil; they were all thinking about him.
“Split up,” he heard Steve say. “Yell if you find anything.” The pack spread out, fanning every corner of the speakeasy. Clint took the main floor, slipping his head into the kitchen and the closets, coming up with nothing. A shout from the basement, however, had him sprinting once again.
Steve deflated as he was met with more silence. This was all his fault. Sure he had been irritated that he had gone to bed alone, and Tony was no doubt on edge after a long engineering binge, but there was no excuse for what he had started. Steve’s mouth had gotten him into fights even when he was just a scrappy kid trying to survive the Great Depression. And while he’d taught himself never to back down, Steve wanted nothing more than to curl up in a ball and die after what he’d said today.
But he never could have seen this gift coming. She’d made the old reactor look almost beautiful, housing in simply in a way made it seem decadent, priceless even.
Tony almost lost it again when he heard the wounded sound that came from his left. Rogers bolted from his side and straight to the bedside, arms reached out for the fallen man. Right before he got to the bed, the blonde froze, his hands hovering slightly over the other form, as if he thought that even the slightest touch could hurt him. That if he got too close Barnes would just disappear again.
that. He’ll jeopardize this whole mission and get someone killed.”
“Shit,” Steve snapped.
When he woke again, it was too an empty bed. Any worry that was building up in his chest deflated when he heard the faint rumblings of Tony in the kitchen. He slipped out of the sheets and padded over to what he assumed to be the closet. Steve huffed when he opened the door; a closet it was, if the clothes lining the walls were any indication, but it looked like there was room to house another three people. Steve idly walked around the perimeter of the room, eyeing the open organized clothing, stopping in front of folded sweatpants. They were soft to the touch and
Steve still could not believe that he got to wake up next to Tony every morning; that he was the only one who got to. Steve looked forward to each morning when he got to watch Tony blink into consciousness, only for Tony to crinkle his nose and bury his face into Steve’s chest. It was adorable. Steve had been given a second chance; Tony’s life had been spared. Steve counted his blessings every day, and vowed to never let Tony slip away from him again.
Tony scoffed, cutting him off. “What more do you want from me?! You’re the one who made it blatantly clear that you wanted me gone!”
A soft moan pulled Steve from his memories. He turned slightly, watching a snoozing Tony twist around in the sheets. Steve shot a hand out, curling it around Tony’s back and tugged, urging the smaller man to rest against his chest. Tony hummed, nuzzling against his skin, doe eyes fluttering open.
Steve watched in horror as Bruce tore open Tony’s medical gown, the doctors readying the charges.
Tony’s hands wound around his neck, his rough fingers threading through the hairs on the nape of his neck. The scratch of his goatee was a welcome sting across his face, complementing the smooth glide of Tony’s tongue. One of them barely had time to take a breath before the other was on them again, taking more and more, never getting enough.
“It is,” Tony said. “You’re taking this a whole lot better than Barnes did.”
Why was Steve frowning at him?
It wasn’t long before the police arrived with the paramedics, both helping Steve get the civilians out of the train. Steve also managed to snag Jo Schmidt, the kid still hiding out in the shadows. Steve grabbed him by his cape and dragged him to the nearest officer. “Make sure he gets home to his mom,” Steve said, throwing one more glare over to the sullen teen.
Tony’s eyes widened. “Steve,” he said trying to reach out for him again. “Steve, calm down. I’ll explain everything.”
“We need to find out where the briefing room is,” Natasha responded. “No way it’s on this floor. We need to get there before Fury finishes his arrest and put Pierce down.”
This was wrong.
For the amount of times they’ve tried to kill each other over the past year, it was almost ironic how life kept putting them in the same boat.
Even with his short question, Thor seemed to understand. “I am not positive of everyone; we’ve all seemed to scatter after… what happened. Clint hasn’t come back yet. Natasha… she’s gone off grid. Dugan and a few more haven’t come back from where they took off in the woods. Wilson is still here, standing with whoever else is left to guard the survivors.”
“Go,” Steve had whispered against his lips, before placing another desperate kiss against them. “I’ll be right behind you.”
Steve huffed out a deep breath. “We haven’t had the pleasure of meeting yet. I’m- ”
he had paused.
“Sounds like Howard,” Tony mussed. “What about you?” he continued. “Dad never said anything about you.”
The smaller man stood tall, the suit perfectly tailored across his well-toned body. His dark brunette hair was styled perfectly, along with the flawless Van Dyke beard that adorned his tanned face. His eyes shown bright under the church’s candles, the warm chestnut orbs alight with amber flecks. He shot Steve a small, shy smile, causing Steve to curse at himself inwardly.
He ran back into the house, grabbing his gauntlet. “Who’s there?” Tony shouted into the night. He saw someone start to come out of the shadows. He readied his repulsor. “Stop right there, I will shoot you!”
As I add more chapters, I will be spending some time revisiting the old ones. This fic is in need of some major TLC. No major plots points will change - just some minor tweaks and edits to smooth out the story. I mean, come on, it's 2018. It's about time I use some proper grammar.
Phil's voice was steady, calming as it always was, but it didn't help Clint this time. He knew that Loki already had a head start on them; if he was able to get the entirety of The Commandos chasing a whisper to a condemned firehouse chained to a wall, who knows what he could do when he was walking free. “Go faster,” Clint hissed to Bucky.
Pepper smiled. “Thank you, Nick. See you later.” With a tip of his hat, Nick stepped wawy from the elevator, letting the doors close.
A hand brushed against his forehead.
Steve took that as his queue to step in. “Must you pick on him?” he asked with a raised eyebrow. Clint smirked at Natasha, as if daring her to land a retort against their leader. Seeing the exchange, Steve continued. “I mean, it looked like he was having a hard enough time out there today. Maybe you should cut him some slack.”
“We had to do it anyway,” Bucky shrugged. “Besides, I’ve already survived an explosion. Odds are in my favor for this one.”
Hammer stuck his hand out immediately to shake with Pierce’s. Sure, Tony Stark may be out of their reach due to his recent break with Grant, but The Commandos were still a force to be reckoned with. Passing up an opportunity to eradicate them would be foolish. And who knows, maybe Stark will come out of his hole with The Commandos out of the way, thinking himself safe. Nothing a simple sniper round couldn't handle, and that stain would be out of his life for good. Regardless of what happened, attacking this base will end up with Stane furious with Pierce. From then, it would only be a matter of time before one kills the other. And wouldn't that just solve the rest of his problems? Time to sit back and watch the show.
“Oh please, like you know anything about structural stability,” Tony snapped. “You just wanted to go out and play hero again!”
-------------------------
Tony huffed. “No,” he pouted, crossing his arms. “Are you?”
Tony shook his head. “Obi- Stane told me he did it.”
“You have eyes on the speakeasy at all times, correct?”
Tony didn’t reply, just smiled, happy that he got his way again, like the princess he is. Clint sees that face all the time when Tony’s with Steve.
Steve faced the other man, raising a single eyebrow. “Can
Steve nodded, yanking at the shelves that were bolted on a swivel, revealing a dated elevator. Wrinkling his nose against the faint waft of stale air, Steve pressed the button on the panel, unused parts squeaking in as the doors opened.
“You’re not going to like the answer.”
Her relationship with The Commandos was her weakness; she was more than aware of that fact. She was positive that if she had told her younger self where she would end up, her past self would reply that she would rather take a bullet to the brain. But now, thinking of the patchwork of people that had joined together and caught her from free fall, Natasha knew that she wouldn’t have it any other way.
“Your dad used this place as a quiet place to think all the time, so it wasn’t hard conclusion to come to. You’re a lot more like him than you care to admit.”
“I just,” Bucky broke off with a laugh. “I can’t even compute this. I honestly don’t think there’s any blood left in my brain.”
“Doesn’t matter what I think.”
Tony scoffed. “Fine. I know where I’m not appreciated.” He stuck a hand out that Sam immediately shook. “Catch you later, Wilson.”
Tony shook his head. “But Clint, I- ”
He slipped back down to the kitchen and eyed the refrigerator. He yanked open the door, and in a very similar fashion to his routine in the morning, shivered at the burst of cold air and stared unseeingly in front of him.
Hands grabbed at his face but Bucky couldn’t pull his face away.
A pile of bodies.
Grabbing the shield on the ground, he covered his head, as well as throwing his past self over his shoulder, running into the night.
He was his father.
So, Steve took out his paint and laid a fresh coat over his canvas. Start again.
If Steve could do one final thing for Tony and for the rest of his family, is give them a chance to continue to live their life. After everything that he’d put them through, it was the least he could do for them. Especially since they’d given him so much. Which is why he planned on slipping out of the speakeasy now, planning to meet Fury alone.
Bruce startled, dropping his groceries. “Uh, yes?” He turned around to find himself faced with an older man, with greying hair and cold blue eyes. “How can I help you?”
Tony froze when realization hit. There
“Load the cars,” he said to Clint, watching over the final preparations for leaving. The plan was fairly simple; it basically had Tony written all over it. But, for once, Steve found himself in complete compliance.
Tony shook his head, gesturing back to the other room. “Fix him first. I’ll be fine.”
. And you just came in and you took it all. My dad was supposed to pick me!
“No,” Steve said with a shake of his head. “Something’s not right. This is too easy.”
Steve Rogers had always been a weak man.
“But weaponry? It was always be there. Why? Because man will always have the desire for
By the time he returned to Steve’s room, Bruce and the others had cleared out, leaving only a scowling Barnes on the floor next to his friend. Of course, wrapped up in blankets like a burrito made Barnes look more like a sad, wet puppy than a pissed gangster. Since Barnes didn’t respond when he entered the room, Tony broke the silence.
“Maybe we should- ” Thor started.
“No, that’s alright, Carol. You guys should get out of there, take a few days. Thanks for the help.”
Thor gave a forceful nod, walking over to a table placed on the far wall. When Thor sidled on back over, Steve chuckled when he saw Thor wielding an industrial hammer. “It’s my favorite,” Thor answered with a laugh of his own.
“I’m sorry, you know.”
He remembered careening towards the ground at terminal velocity. A tough way to go. But it didn’t happen. He could here his CO yelling in his ear, yelling at Riley not surprisingly. At the time, Sam thought it was a poetic sense of justice that he would die listening to the sounds of Riley getting his ass reamed. He’d fallen past his release altitude,
It was all The Captain’s fault.
Steve froze, as if a kid caught stealing candy. “A man can’t be too careful,” Steve replied slowly.
Clint groaned. “We really do not have time for this self-loathing bullshit.”
“You dare,” Tony hissed, watching in horror as Barnes downed the whole cup in one go.
His voice was patronizing.
He shouldn't even be here. He should be puttering away in his lab, drinking the finest scotch in his penthouse, having empty sex in his suite. He dabbled in the crime world, sure, everyone needs a hobby. But the past three days had opened up a world that Tony wasn't sure he wanted to be a part of. There was a time that he thought it was all he wanted - but that was a lifetime ago. Back when his parents were still breathing and he gave a shit about what they thought about him. But now, he was different. The life he had was one that he painstakingly built himself. He was happy - and he sure as hell wasn't going to let HYDRA or The Captain take it away from him.
Barnes caught it easily, inspecting the weapon right away. While Tony didn’t get a smile from the man, the nod of approval was more than Tony ever thought he was ever going to get. It must be Christmas.
He was about half way through taking apart the carburetor when he heard footsteps approach him.
“And you always make the right call, don’t you?”
That’s why, sitting in the empty cafeteria, Clint tightened his grip on the knife he smuggled in. Tony Stark was bad news. Clint knew it, Steve knew it, everyone knew it. Why Steve was even bothering to put up with the man had Clint’s head reeling. Dealing with Tony Stark was basically asking for a one way ticket to hell.
Steve looked back over at Tony, and saw the man struggling to stand up. He was clutching at his side from where the bullet pierced him.
Yinsen manages to roll his eyes as he slowly crossed the room, his hands carefully holding the tongs. “Relax, I’ve got steady hands. I used to be a doctor.”
-------------------------
“I killed us all.”
The priest shot Steve a glare, but dutifully started the ceremony. “Do you, Steve Rogers, take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?”
Steve, stop, it’s Clint!”, the red seemed to bleed away from the man’s eyes, looking down at Clint with a shocked gaze. At least he had the decency to look bashful.
“What’s that?”
“Ass,” Tony snorted, cuffing the man’s head with a pillow.
“That’s a price I’m willing to pay.”
“That’s it!” was all the response Tony heard before chaos erupted. Magic spilled from Wanda’s hands, raising Pietro’s plate before smashing the meal into the boy’s face. Pietro didn’t have time to react before Wanda was leaping across the table, trying to land a decent punch.
Steve shook his head. “I don’t know what they’re doing. But whatever they’re up to, it can’t be good.”
Steve nodded, knowing there was no way he’d be able to stop Bucky anyhow. “Keep to the shadows and stay away from the cops.”
“Yes,” Steve hissed. “You’re not really here.”
Obie hadn't seem to care much as he ended up at their funeral anyway. He didn't really remember the service, who came, or even the caskets being lowered into the ground. What he did remember was a comment, as he was finally leaving. Usually, Tony filtered everything out; it was usually the same anyway:
“Together.”
Tony hummed. “I’ve got good taste,” he beamed.
“No kidding,” answered Tony, breathless with amazement. It was a feeling that he loved, he craved over and over again. The initial joy of a successful experiment. While it had been a while since he'd ever doubted his ingenuity, but the hand blasters were something so far from the grid he usually worked with, Tony couldn't help but constantly fret over whether or not they would work. Because, well, his life kind of depended on it. “Now, we should finish- ”
With shaking hands, Steve removed the canvas sack over the victim’s head. Looking down, he was face with an older version of himself. His hair had grayed, and there were age lines etched into his skin, but it was definitely Steve.
“It’s not like I haven’t thought the same thing,” Steve replied quietly.
“There it is,” Steve said, soundly way too smug.
“Tony, baby, what’s wrong?”
“Just a little past nine.”
Ignoring the sharp pains coursing around his body, Tony forced himself to stand. He tried to make his way over to Happy, only to have a sharp tug force him back. Tony barely had time to shout his disapproval before he was thrown over a broad shoulder like a rag doll.
Steve dropped his hands away from his face to look at Thor. He hadn’t even heard the other man come in. Who knows long he had sat there.
“You are lucky! God, Bucky, what the hell is wrong with you? You telling me you’d rather be dead?!”
A shot rang out.
“Uhh, I can be late in my own tower if I want to, Agent,” he replied with a wink. The man was dripping with wit, and no doubt charm.
Tony had been in a lot of awkward situations before. Most of them, of course, were along the lines of Pepper finding him in bed with his latest conquest, ranging from potential business partners to the waitress who served him his coffee. There was that one time when Tony was younger, that Howard had found his internet history before Tony was smart enough to cover his tracks completely. That’s not even getting started on the time Jarvis had walked in Tony trying to clean up a failed experiment that had cost the man most of his clothes and covered the lab with thick goo. Needless to say, when it came to awkward encounters, Tony Stark was your man.
“Since when does New York get earthquakes?”
Steve rolled his eyes. “Technically, I don’t think you managed to throw a punch.”
Bucky started to laugh, tucking his face into Tony’s neck. “It’s Steve’s.”
Steve rubbed the back of his neck, face flushing in embarrassment. "We had a breakthrough. We don't think it's HYDRA going after the warehouses. We think it's a bunch of smaller mobs doing the targeting."
Now that “no one was watching” Barton could get information out of him the other way.
Steve would have been lying if he hadn’t let out a sharp intake of breath. Warm light flooded the room, showing it to be much larger than expected. Dark wood floors covered the ground, peeking out between worn rugs. The walls, colored surprisingly light, were tastefully decorated with sparse and simple paintings and black and white photos. Off to the right, a huge bar sprawled, the large alcohol bottles sitting behind twinkling in the light. The left wing of the room housed plush armchairs and large couches, facing a darkened flatscreen that hung on the wall. But in the middle of the room, encompassed down on depressed flooring, sat a huge, ornate table with probably enough seating for an entire football team.
“It can’t wait. Not anymore,” Hill replied tersely.
“Tony- ”
to his friend. If anything, that caused Stark to grin wider. "That's right, Barnes; a whipped dog like you wouldn't want to upset the Master, would you?"
“Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.”
drank. Tony had asked him once, and watched as the man got quiet, hands slowly from where he was washing Howard's crystal tumblers.
“Tony, come on, I wasn’t going to leave.”
Obie rolled his eyes. “Tony. These are military contracts. They don’t take deals like this lightly. They want to see the man who designs their weapons, not the guy who does the paperwork. I already told them you were coming, so I suggest you make yourself presentable,” he finished, frowning down at Tony’s sopping wet suit.
Tony nodded. “Yes. Positive ID and more than enough evidence to put him away.”
“Any ideas?” Bucky shouted over the gunfire.
Tony had trusted him. Steve had trusted him. His team had trusted him. And Clint had let them all down. It was a cruel reminder that Clint should never have been considered a superhero. Why he ever thought he could have been was beyond Clint.
“All I’m saying is that we need to stay on the right side of the law for now; don’t go around attracting attention. Always check your six, and never find yourself alone. You don’t know who could be watching.”
“We’ve worked with less.”
“You don’t know me,” Tony snapped.
be nervous. Whatever’s happening cannot be good.
Natasha’s voice startled him right out of the bench. He wiped his eyes quickly, trying to compose himself. When he turned around, he found himself faced with not only Natasha, but with another unfamiliar woman.
“Anything.” Thor replied.
Tony paused. “Well, I- ”
“I’m not going to stop and ask questions,” Tony responded, rushing back past Yinsen, over to their desk. “That’s a signal if I’ve ever seen one. We’re getting out of here. Today.”
“Whatever pleases you, sir.”
Pierce smiled as he punched a number into his phone.
“So it’s decided then,” Thor responded. “We bring Hammer for another talk. He is weak; it will not take long to break him.”
“He didn’t pick up?” Sam tried to ask nonchalantly.
“I’m not leaving.”
When did Clint Barton turn into this broken shell of a man? He used to be so much more than this.
“STEVE!”
“I already told you, Tony, I can’t go with you.”
“And that’s what’s making you hot?”
“I brought you something to eat. Bruce made it, so you know it will be edible.”
She shook her head, sighing. “No, Mr. Stark decided that he would play superhero today. If you have more fan mail, don’t worry about it. His ego doesn’t need it.”
-------------------------
“Take care how you speak,” hissed Thor stepping closer to Tony.
Steve looked up, meeting the gaze of an equally disheveled James Rhodes. In fact, he looked worse, Steve noticed, just by looking at the state of his clothes. Of course, while the last three months had been pure hell, the last few days for the Colonel had been a nightmare. Apparently, the military didn’t take too kindly for taking such an extended leave. Rhodes had been on the phone constantly, begging his commanding officers for just a little more time.
“Jesus Christ!”
“Likewise, Captain.” She nodded to the grave. “I see you are here to see my grandfather as well.”
he moaned, his body already twisting around, as if trying to chase the phantom touch.
“And we’ll give it to you. For immunity,” Steve pressed. “Deal?”
"It's not him," Tony said quickly, on instinct.
Steve couldn’t tell if the man had seen him or not; the figure remained in one place as Steve walked carefully out to him. Each step was painstakingly slow; the ice made no protest, but Steve wasn’t taking any chances.
“You shouldn’t be.
“Not sure,” Steve answered. “You could just talk.”
“In Manhattan, Sir.”
The other man struggled against Steve’s hold. “Ah, long time no see,
,” the blonde whispered.
Barnes looked at Tony, eyes dropping to where he was still gripping the gun. “You going after them?”
But it was gone now, almost as if it was never there to begin with. But he knew it was still in there. Somewhere, hiding behind the current warm glow. The cold had claimed him. Who knows how much of himself he’d gotten back. Who knows how long it’ll be before the cold comes to take him back again. He couldn’t go back. He couldn’t. The frozen depths the hell he never knew existed; the calm, dark waters an endless pit of despair, as the silence drove him insane. He jolted, trying to latch on to the warmth, the comfort, praying,
He waited until Stark’s suit reentered the building. He tapped a code into his code, sitting back, ready for the finale.
Across the street, he caught wind of Mrs. Danowitz heading back their way, her friends trailing on either side of her. “Let’s go inside,” he said, pushing Steve towards the door. He wasn’t about to let them cause any more damage than they already had. He couldn’t help but punch at Tony’s shoulder when the man threw one last wave across the street and yelled, “Have a great day, ladies!”
With each stride towards his company, more destruction seemed to reveal itself. Cars were burning around them, smoke billowing and fires burning. He could hear people screaming, but it was muffled by the familiar whine of repulsor blasts.
Once the rough cloth was out of his mouth, the man gasped for air like he’d been drowning, his harsh breaths accompanied by pained groans. “Ple-ple-please! No more, I can’t, I-I’ll tell you anything!”
He felt the elevator move beneath him, before a tiny ding told him he had reached his destination. He stumbled out, heading for the mini bar on auto pilot. Tony had been gone for hours, but it looked like his new roommates had gone their separate ways.
“I don’t understand,” Steve breathed. “You’re
The man gaped at Tony. “Dude, let me help you, I just- ”
all the way out to Queens.
HYDRA.
Clint shook his head. “Thor, I need to see him. They’re not dead! Bucky and Stark! They’re alive!”
“Be down in five,” Steve replied, ignoring the barb in favor of tangling his fingers in Tony’s.
Tony huffed out a deep sigh, hand running through his already unruly hair. “Thanks a lot, Rogers. Now, I’m going to be thinking about that the entire meeting.”
Bright pain shot up his side as they landed one floor down, but it was ignored by the fire radiating from his leg. Zola had shot him. Bucky was up in a flash, yanking Steve to cover when he saw Zola lean over the bridge above them. Steve twisted, Bucky stumbling under him as another shot went off, this one burying deep into his side.
