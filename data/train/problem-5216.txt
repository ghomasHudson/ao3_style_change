“Yeah, no, got it.” Tony hastily says, retreating immediately. “Good. No knives. No more knives or sharp objects of any kind from now on.”
“Alright.” Rogers acquiesces, shifting so neatly into his leader persona that it’s almost like the confusing, too revealing conversation that had just transpired had never occurred at all. “We have no satellite images, so we gotta be careful. Locate all groups, don’t let them sneak in on you, and keep them calm.”
“People can survive that.” Tony reminds him, undeterred. “People live in places where they don’t see the sun for more than an hour and they survive, Bruce.”
"I saw the message on a store. All screens and radios were playing it. When I saw Cap I... I called. Nat convinced me to come."
It wasn’t anything dangerous – nobody knew where they were, and that was all that mattered right now -, but he still thinks about that sometimes. Even though they ran, and even if he knew the possibility of new Avengers surging to fill the gap they left was true, he still felt like an Avenger. He still felt like he was part of it.
“Jarvis loves you, he always did.” Tony complains, childishly, in reflex. “I was the one always getting a speech when it was you who was always getting into fights and getting us both bruised!”
Barton makes a motion as to step forward, and it’s so sudden and so charged that Agents Ross and Carter both jump to their feet and reach for their guns, ready to unholster them and aim, even if their free hands are raised into the air also in calming motions, their eyes cautious.
“Yeah. Fine.” Tony waves away the concern, lowering his head to hide his eyes and shrugging to attempt even the slightest hint of nonchalance.
Steve then decides to do what he does best: bond in battle. He’s not lined up to go to a mission anytime soon, seeing as Thor, Wasp, Jessica Jones, Hellcat, Daredevil, and Luke Cage are all still off-campus fighting AIM, so he’ll have to get to Tony in one of the training quarters. Problem is, Tony rarely goes to the Dojo, and he trains at the Gym at odd times.
“Can’t a woman pay attention to the cute boy once in a while?” She says, and her tone is so clearly laced with false innocence it almost sounds like a taunt, especially with the way she tilts her head to peer at Sam from under her eyelashes.
“I don’t know how you’re doing this.” Howard whispers to himself, furiously. “How are you doing this?!”
is good enough reason for me to ignore their wishes and bother Her Majesty?” Tony waves the comm device in the air, shrugging. “You guys know her best.”
thing. He doesn’t back down just because Steve is being defensive, if he thinks it’s important. He’s respectful, but he never allows that respect to become passiveness. Steve really admires him for it.
“Were we always so bad for each other?” Steve asks in a whisper, knowing that despite their slight distance, the roof is so silent she will be able to hear him perfectly clear.
Tony stares at the back of her head for a few seconds, not exactly suspicious; But still, instinctively wary, and only when she doesn’t turn back at all Tony feels comfortable enough to bring his hand around the casing of the compartment and pressing into the safety locks, popping the front open and exposing the inner workings of it so he can work on connecting all the cables correctly himself, trying not to damage it further on the process.
We're entering a really rough patch now. Lots of tears incoming. I'd say I'm sorry, but someone is gotta do it. If these characters won't open up by themselves, guess I'll just have to pry the emotions and trauma out of them by force.
It’s more messed up than just killing half the population. It’s worse. It’s doing it a way that the only thing that remains of them, the only tangible thing they left when they disappeared, the thing that is already too painful to think about – it’s taking that thing and have it be the cause of the death of whoever is left, in a long, slow, agonizing pace, to literally choke them in their grief.
Tony is not gonna lie and say this is not about the kid. It is. It is about the kid. Along the desperation and sorrow, there is an ember of rage that refuses to cool inside his core, there is a wound that will never stop bleeding for as long as he doesn’t bring that kid back to the arms of his aunt, to Tony’s own shaky embrace, Goddamnit; Because he will
He’s desperate for – for something, for anything Bruce might give him, but Bruce only stares and thinks, and stares some more, his face is unreadable and Tony’s nerves are fraying at the edges and rattled like they haven’t been in a really long time, the stress from reliving it and the lack of response – or approval or reprehension, or both, of
“Wow.” Pepper says, blinking slowly, halfway through a laugh. “That was very convincing, I am very impressed.”
Tony looks at Rocket, desperate for clarification, and the total lack of surprise or confusion in his expression is even more baffling to Tony.
He remembers the nights during the first months after the wormhole, the constant sizzling of anxiety in his veins, the flashing, turbulent images exploding behind his eyelids every time he dared to close his eyes – the night when Pepper finally

, too. Tony couldn’t. And he knows, in the secrecy of his own mind, in this silence that stretches between them when neither can find the strength or the words to speak, when the pause makes them so acutely aware of what they have just done and they both freeze and begin to shake in barely repressed sobs as the need to give voice to the anguish that is clawing inside them – he knows, even if she doesn’t, that he

“And what are you going to do if you do find him?” Pepper interrupts, angrily, so terribly distressed. “Fight him again? Risk your life in space for a thing you don't even know if exists anymore?”
He sees nothing past the blurry sheen of unshed tears staining his eyes, a hazy mist of agony and sorrow floating right before him, a veil of numbness blocking everything on the outside from his perception, even sensation, even the
The man is not shocked about his inquiry—he doesn’t find odd Jarvis does not believe it was an accident. In fact, it seems like he is expecting it.
But Natasha sighs, soft and sad, and just as she types one last line and pushes a button, and the ways to the cells are all clear, she mumbles to herself:
He considers going back to bed; but still hears the sound of vibranium crushing glass, loud, horrible,
admiration and complicity that it feels like Steve is witnessing something he shouldn’t, a Tony Stark that is so opposite to the persona Steve has heard about that it almost feels
“Hey, Smurfette.” Tony calls, and it only goes to show how truly focused on him she is, because her eyes snap back to his with no question, not even a slight wavering of her guarded posture even with the use of the nickname. A warm surge of something that is far too close to affection crashes in tidal waves in his chest, and it leaks into his voice, curling malleable around his words. “It’s okay. We’re safe. There’s no threat.”
“And why are we the ones to decide if we get a next time?” Natasha looks at him, and her eyes are sad, sad, so
that she is the one averting her gaze, the dark of her eyes somehow even deeper, even hollowed, like the universe it reflects somehow has grown too large and too empty, too barren for any emotion other than sadness to fill it.
“When he disappeared—” Rocket sniffs, and Tony doesn’t know if he’s crying or not, if his fur would conceal the tears so easily that he wouldn’t be able to tell. “We were in the woods, and he just… He started to turn into dust right in front of me, and he called me

He mumbles to himself, tiredly. He runs his hand over his face, pressing his fingers into his eyes as if that could chase away the sleepiness, and says, “Please tell me you got it.”
Tony is an idiot. God, he’s an idiot, and he dreads this, he dreads it every single step of the way, into the elevator and up the helipad, even with the comforting presence of Rhodey by his side. He dreads the weight of Natasha’s stare, the poignant silence from Nebula and Rocket, Thor’s inquiring gaze – he dreads it all, but he
There’s a shrill noise in his ears, sharp and loud and deafening, and Steve almost fears he won’t be able to hear a word, but even so he flips the phone open, he accepts the call; And as soon as the phone touches his ear, he realizes he
“None of those things are related to your position as a king, Your Highness.” Natasha jabs back, giving him a tense smirk with the corner of her lips, making her seem almost sheepish.
They start collecting their things and getting up almost automatically, both of them moving in quick, stiff motions, like the always do when they go on a mission. This is them entering a battle mindset as easily as breathing, going through motions as efficiently and precisely as possible, as a way to diminish risks and make the most of the available time. They learned how to work like this during their partnership at SHIELD, when they discovered Steve’s strength and Natasha’s skill for stealth created a deadly combination, and now this is just second nature for them.
Not that he knows it would have gone better with all of them together. Maybe it wouldn’t. But maybe it would’ve. And that maybe will keep him up at night forever, will eat him away from the inside slowly but surely, and maybe he’ll never be at peace with it – maybe, if for a second time, for a second grand failure, Tony can’t get past through his hold ups with this long enough to fix
“What consequences?” Tony asks, more on the defensive than he’d like, although he’s fully aware this insane plan of theirs is not gonna come without a price tag attached. They will be messing with the most powerful being in the universe – to steal the very things that hold the foundations of this universe from him, and to use them to their own gain. This is arrogance of the highest degree; And Tony, better than anyone else, knows what kind of price arrogance usually demands. But this is different – they have no choice. It’s not arrogance, it’s despair, and it’s not just their lives on the line. It’s everyone’s.
But this is me biting the bullet. Never let it be said that I have stellar self-preservation instincts.
That’s what he’s hoping for, when he calls Bucky. He doesn’t say it, and he doesn’t ask, but over and over again, its what has happened in the past.
“Where were you last?” Nebula asks, loud and harsh, like she is screaming. “Before Maw brought you to his ship. Where were you?”
And Tony can’t even check. He can’t fly to Tennessee. Not now. He has no cameras there, no AI, no nothing, he can’t even guess if Harley is still alive or not. He hasn’t seen the kid in a few years now, and it’s agonizing, because the dark voices in his brain keep insisting that now he never will again. Neither him nor Parker.

“It wasn’t.” Tony explains. Complains? Affirms. He tells her, “We had lunch at Grigorio’s, and then we decided to walk around. No big deal.”
“Of course, Mrs. Stark. My lips are sealed.” He says, in his usual calm and polite tone, eyes completely sincere.
Like clockwork, Steve’s expression turns more serious. “Can we not do this now? At least… when it’s just the two of us?”
himself forget, made himself pretend the threat wasn’t out there so he could live his blissful, peaceful life, making everyone around him believe he wasn’t paranoid about the imminent threat anymore. All the while, Thor had been gone – doing the work Tony should have done. Keeping watch. Getting ready. Tony should have kept trying, even after what happened to Ultron; but he didn’t, he
“Have you—” Steve starts, but the words get caught awkwardly in his throat. A pause, filled with uncertainty. “Seen Tony?”
and initiate the apologies. Is that something bad to think about, to wish for? Like he’s some kind of villain who is victimizing himself, or maybe he’s an arrogant jerk, demanding reparation without being willing to do any of his own? He doesn’t know. Like he said –
“Nidavellir is a forge powered by the heart of a dying star.” Rocket informs them, crossing his arms, as if the mere knowledge of this fact fills him with inexplicable pride.
how it eats him up from the inside, in the way he looks around frantically and chews his lip, like he’s struggling but not giving up on finding a solution.
Sam and Nat haven’t mentioned a word about how hard Steve has been pushing himself these days. Granted, Steve didn’t think they would have, whether because they are afraid he would shut himself off – which he would, and it pains him to admit it –, or because
“I don’t understand.” Thor cries, even if he does follow Tony quickly out of the shop and up the stairs, voice frantic with confusion. “What is happening?”
And so they stand here, alone, together, something in between – and they both worry if it’s not too late, or if it is. They worry, and they cannot stop.
trembling inside his chest when Howard Stark, in words that should have never made Tony feel the way it felt, told him that Tony was his greatest creation. Sometimes, Tony’s brain will tell him that’s a lie, a comforting lie, but a lie nonetheless, and if he chooses to believe that or not – it simply varies from day to day.

having too much time and too much silence in his head. When this kind of thing happens, he always thinks he is losing his mind.
“Well.” Steve hums, trying to imitate her and her brother, and by the flicker of amusement in her eyes, he fails miserably at it. “I do like the dark blue.”
“We trust you.” Natasha says, with no deception or hesitation, and her approval is all Barton needs, and his smile turns a little more sincere at the edges, just a tiny bit. Natasha’s approval also mellows Rogers easily, so when he nods, no one else thinks to raise any objections anymore. Because if she’ll approve it, who is going to contest it? No one. Not when it comes to Barton.
“Intense.” Pepper offers, with a pointed look in Tony’s direction, a look that means so much more than what she actually says. “Dangerous.”
“Quiet. Move over.” Tony taps his thigh, motioning to the side of the couch. “We’re watching Planet of the Apes.”
“So it worked almost the same. It released energy and that energy looked for a host. Instead of modifying space and time, it attached to people. Living things.” Bruce considers.
He sees no blood. Which is… something. This is always what he looks for first, it’s always the first evidence of an attack, but he sees no blood. He sees only chaos.

, but the urge is stronger than him. Something about the way the others circle them like they’re a spectacle in a circus, it puts Tony incredibly on edge.
This makes all kinds of alarms blare in Steve’s mind, his protectiveness building itself up like a fortress, the years-old bitterness making his voice harsh and stern.
Thor backs off, not without making a huffy noise – proof that, however wisdom and tragedy have changed him, it hasn’t changed him
Somewhere at the back of his head, Steve wonders how it could be so easy. He knows better than to underestimate Natasha and her incredible skills, but this is a facility built to keep even the most capable and strong locked up, and its systems shouldn’t be so quick to being brought down. He wonders, silently, if Natasha stole something that allowed easier access. Something of Tony’s. It sounds like something she would’ve done.
“Congratulations. You want a medal for that or what?” Sam quips, reeling back in a mocking gesture of surprise.
If not them, who else? Who else can stand the mess that is Steve Rogers, the man out of time, the stubborn son of a bitch who likes to pick fights with people twice his size? He needs this family.
is, but Tony supposes it’s another kind of alien. Gamora, however, is a name he’s been hearing a lot.
“Yes. I can imagine why you might think I would deny you entry in my country, Agent Romanov. But there is no need to worry. I had no part in your dispute. Whatever conflict remains between you and your friend in America, it is a matter that concerns only your team. The Black Panther is not an Avenger. I take no sides in this fight.”
to see, almost mocking, and Tony is half glad, half pissed off at the realization that not even the apocalypse can put out the burning pit of spite and rage that seems to forever live inside Steve Rogers, because it’s familiar, it’s almost comforting, and even if Tony can’t help but associate his stubbornness and righteousness with less than pleasant memories, he still feels, deep down, a little twinge of relief in knowing he’s not broken.
Outside, somewhere amongst the grey clouds and the cold, the cutting wind and the vast silence, a thunder roars.
There is no existential dread to the idea, or envy, or anything like that; It’s just… the way it must put things into perspective, to live that long, to have that much time to… be. Ever since Afghanistan, time has been a constant enemy in Tony’s life, robbing him of so much, so many lost chances – and Thor, who has more time in his hands that anyone could ever ask for, somewhere down the line, has learned a wisdom that humans like Tony can only hope to gain a sliver of, a capacity to…
“Is that your team?” Nebula asks, mutedly, and Tony whips around fast, completely ignoring his own warnings; And now, instead of hurting on his side, he hurts on his neck, when a muscle pulls too tight and stings all the way up to his brain.
And if someone likes that sort of thing, I do have the habit of listening to music while I write, and I have a selection of songs that kept me inspired while I worked on this, and you can find those songs in this little playlist I have organized

They scramble back, afraid of touching the bars, and, miraculously, they
With a whispered apology, Tony walks out dragging his feet, feeling like has just been hit by a goddamned train, head down and heart aching so terribly that it feels like he’s bleeding out again, gutted to the very core, when he bumps with Rhodey and Bruce at the corner of the corridor, both frozen still like deer caught on the headlights.
in living in hiding. He knows how this goes. Probably more than any of them, save maybe Natasha. So he’s not worried; And he tells Sam that.
Steve has no problem with Vision’s presence. Not at all. In fact, he is kind of glad he is here, because that means Wanda is happy, that means that they might not be as broken as Steve fears they are, and he takes this as a small comfort in his already too beaten up heart.

And that’s stupid, and unfair, and a little too childish, because at the same time – should this bother him? Should he be glad? He doesn’t know.
“We should always help as we can.” He says in a whisper. “Because we don’t know when we’ll be able to come back.”
, a damn near perfect replica from the real man, from what Tony could remember from childhood. That’s just the kind of person Jarvis had been. He could be impulsive, but even his impulsiveness was measured. Tony’s memories, even if sometimes unreliable though the haze of tears or idealization, were so clear when it came to Jarvis – his perfectly poised expressions and gestures, but at the same time, the

“I’ll have FRIDAY send a signal to all government lines still functional.” Tony says, thinking out loud. “We’ll see if we can get some help from any nation that might not have completely collapsed yet. But we still need to find a way to reach people who have already lost their communication lines. We need to remind them to stay calm and organize into groups, preferably in the same place. No one should be isolated because if something happens, they might get stuck or be hurt, and with everything destroyed, rescue won’t be able to find them – so they need to stay together.”
“They could definitely be.” Rogers agrees, with steely conviction. “The Tesseract was used to power HYDRA weapons remotely but as soon as the Red Skull tried to use it by his own hand it destroyed him. Maybe they really
Lang is an engineer. Tony would never refuse his help, despite the small differences they’ve had in the past.
And on the middle, a red splatter. Dark, dark red, almost black, staining the center where the star should be.

“No.” Natasha says. “He said American citizens. That would leave out me, Wanda, Thor and Vision himself.”
He doesn’t look up, but he can feel the others moving. He can feel their stares. The sensation is similar to a thousand needles poking his skin, sharp and shallow,
It’s like watching her implode. Steve almost takes a step forward, he’s not sure why – to put himself between Natasha and T’Challa? To grab her arm and… what? Ask her what this is all about? Ask her if she’s ok? Tell her to stop? -, but he doesn’t have the chance to act before Natasha moves.
that dies inside his chest, voiceless before it can even attempt to escape, dying suffocated inside his aching body. All sounds die out, just like the world around him, just like his heart, and he cries in silence, just as he always did. As he learned, a long, long time ago.
Tony unconsciously brings his hand to his chest, fingers grazing the surface of the glass of his nanite compartment, as if an absent-minded caress. He can almost feel the soft vibrations of the nanites moving inside it.

“I’m not big on suffering in general.” Tony replies. “And I already dedicate myself to a form of art.”
“They’re gonna break through!” Tony warns, face twisting in distress. “I’m gonna douse them with a fire extinguisher.”
But Tony doesn’t like that. He really doesn’t. It’s sad, to watch Cap – Steve – look around with a lost gaze, like he’s a puppy who is missing their owner. The guy must be… very lonely. Tony can’t even begin to imagine what it must feel like, to wake up in a world that is totally different than the one you knew. He heard Steve had been adapting well to technology – but he must miss some familiarity, right? The guy deserves some comfort.
the threat before it was completely destroyed. They had destroyed Ultron. The Chitauri fell. All other threats they had dealt with were baseline humans, for the most part. The ones who weren’t –
And Tony exhales far too harshly from his nostrils, eyes suddenly burning and a painful pressure building on his forehead and nose, a rush of emotion that threatens to spill unbidden down his cheeks, an old, bitter resentment and fear rearing its head from the depth of his chest, ready to strike. The anxiety that never fully abates, only sleeps, only waits; Until the next moment, the next beat.
to look at since the battle, the painful reminder too raw for them to even think about it, let alone touch – That’s when it had happened.
For the first time, they’re alright. They’re having fun together, and not even bruises can take away the joy they’re feeling.
Steve halts because he still doesn’t know, truly. He doesn’t what he should do when he steps out of the Quinjet doors. There are so many words that have been trapped inside his chest, so many things he wish he could say but he physically doesn’t feel able to – and he’s afraid, even if he won’t admit it, he’s afraid of seeing Tony again after so long and somehow realize they are now strangers.
He has been in darker places. In darker thoughts. It’s true. It’s true that in the past, the desire to atone and the need to self-destruct had walked hand in hand from him, when the suit had been a shell to protect him from the own villain within, but Tony—

“I had Time. I – I had the Time book.” Bruce shakes his head, reorienting himself. “Wong was right, it’s by far their most complete one, or at least it seems. Very precise, too. It does have spells – I guess it’s what they use when they create the rings and the… magic stuff. Probably what Strange worked with too, but it’s nothing we can replicate. Just
They are all scattered across the lounge, sitting on the chairs and sofas and leaning on counters and walls, a weird distance between them, like no one can handle too much proximity, especially in a room suddenly so full of people like this. Tony finds it weird, but at the same time, he’s thankful for it, because it does feel like too much right now, and the only people he feels like can handle close are Pepper, Rhodey and, surprisingly, Nebula. So he’s glad that all three of them stay close by, even if the raccoon, the one that clearly knows who Nebula is, stands far in the back, almost hidden behind the large sofa in which Thor and Bruce sit, and neither he nor Nebula make the effort of being close or offering comfort to one another.
“They wanted to, but no one dared.” Nebula darkly admits. “I wouldn’t leave you unprotected. I told them so, and they stood down.”
Steve is a leader, but most of his strength derives from a place that allows very little time for vulnerability, and
“Can’t we?” Tony miserably asks, even though the words don’t have any strength or actual confidence to them. “We have a wedding scheduled already. We could…”
In the morning, they separate. Not too much, but enough to be noticeable. Enough to disturb the weak, fragile balance they had kept during the previous months.
“We’ve been trying to find whoever we can.” Natasha informs him. “But we didn’t have any luck. We couldn’t find Scott and Clint—” her voice cracks a little, and they all pretend it didn’t happen as she goes on, “—, and we also couldn’t find Fury. We thought they could help, but we can’t find them.”
“Royal bodyguards, I assume? Like the one who came for T’Challa when he was arrested?” Tony raises an eyebrow, remembering a tall, regal woman in a black dress that was introduced as T’Challa’s

standing in front of one another, much like he and Rogers had, and Nebula’s head is hanging down sorrowfully as the raccoon stares up at her, it’s entire posture alerting aggression.
“I don’t know if the Stone itself is looking for something or if it just follows the orders of whoever holds it.” Natasha shrugs, forlorn. “There’s not enough information to prove either option. If they are defending themselves it would explain why they sometimes try to kill their hosts, but that doesn’t explain Vision.”
“Actually - you know what, I will not stand here and have all these lies about me - I am leaving you both here.”
” Thor roars, surprised and immediately on alert, body poised dangerously ready to attack, despite not having his weapon on him. It’s a testament to how out of touch they are with each other, that Thor has never been to the Compound before during a crisis, and so, has never heard the alarm ring like this.
, much older than his age, like sorrow has etched itself down to the marrow of his bones, and it pumps and leaks into his bloodstream at every second, now a part of him just like any other.
“And I can’t have you picking up a fight with me just because you have some… Some issues with me screwing up, not forever. Not for
A beat passes. The silence turns awkward. Startling thanks to the heavy discomfort, Tony blinks and turns his face from the door, towards Bruce and Rhodey, who are watching him with questioning, concerned eyes. “What’s that?”
“I was jealous of her.” Nebula confesses. “And I’m not proud of it. Every time we’d fight, every time I’d
“FRI, write that down.” Tony orders, though he can see, even though his frantic looks to the others, from the corner of his eye in a quick glance, the projection board on the wall across the room – and FRIDAY has
“Damage.” Tony says, shrugging. “In infrastructure, and political standing, and civilian casualties. We had an accident in 2016, where… Wanda accidentally pushed a bomb away from a crowd, but it went into a building, and it hit people. Twenty-three people died, including seven Wakandans who had been there in a peacekeeping mission.”
Nebula is looking at him flabbergasted, her eyes wide and confused, questions swirling inside the dark infinity of her gaze, as if Tony is a puzzle she cannot figure out. She looks at him, at his hand laid on top of Dum-E for a very, very long time, until she says:
, he wishes he could think about this clearly, he wishes he could say he’s glad for Vision’s presence for what it is and he expects nothing more of it, but that would be a

“I agree. But we all lose people we love, Ms. Carter. I cannot fault Mrs. Stark for wanting to keep what she had left.”
“First aid down the hall.” Tony directs her with a gesture of his neck, indicating the way with a tilt of his head. “The lounge next to the workshop. Right cabinet, next to the bar.”
“I’d like to ask you something, Captain.” T’Challa asks, perfectly calm, as if he can’t see that Steve is itching with the need of running for Natasha and making sure she won’t disappear on him again if he’s not too careful.
But that’s a very, very small part of his brain talking. The rest of him, his mind, his bones, his heart, his everything – it all makes him

of worldviews and language, and for all of humanity’s amazing discoveries, there are still bits of information that are largely beyond their reach, and it
And he had agonized over it, of course. Of course he would have. When they conducted tests and trials to analyze the extent of Wanda’s powers Tony read all the reports. He sent in a bunch of simulation protocols and suggestions and dutifully poured hours into the charts and results, the footage and the annotations, and made sure no equipment would ever go amiss for her training, just like the others. He helped to get her Visa request going, he put in a good word for the press when they frowned upon adopting “Ultron’s little witch” into the team, he smiled and nodded at her when they saw each other on the sporadic meetings he had with the team.
Barton’s mouth thins as he presses his lips together, eyes going misty, and he replies, in a rough voice:
“I will always worry. And you will always fight. And we can’t stand this for much longer.” Pepper whispers, voice cracking, even as she gives a small smile and holds his face between her hands two swipe away a tear that escapes Tony’s eyes unbidden. “You are not wrong. If you think your way is the best way to save the world, I believe you, and if you say you mean it, that it’s not you just looking for revenge, I
The thought infests his mind the same way a damn parasite would, creeping up on him and slowly taking roots in the deep corners of his mind, making him paranoid. He feels restless. Like he’s being watched, but he can’t be sure if he really is – but what if he is, what does that mean? He wonders if Tony would reach out for them first, but it doesn’t seem likely. Tony is a very proud man. And he must be hurt, Steve knows this, because they all are, and Tony would never willingly show weakness. Not to Steve, or any of them.
“Is everything okay?” Tony risks asking, because he really can’t decipher the troubled look on Steve’s face.
or whatever the hell this might be, because he really can’t afford to have this taken away from him again. “We can’t take the calls. You know why. And we
Still, it’s a loaded question. It’s such a loaded question. They all look at him and Tony has a terrible déjà vu of the previous day, of their stares and their expectations, of the weight of his words, of his choice.
“Where the hell are we going?” Tony whispers, looking at Natasha and Barton to see if any of them can give him any more information than Rogers, but they also don’t seem to know what’s happening.
, he wants to apologize for real and make sure something like this will never happen again. He will never,
From the moment he’d given her the first opening, she’s been doing it. Setting him up on dates, trying to figure out what kind of woman made him tick. After all, when she realized
We've been talking about some really serious stuff so far, but there is still something we have yet to address in any way, shape, or form, not only me - but many people in this fandom, I believe. Not because we don't see it, no. We see it, but it's so much easier to talk about it when it's in a happy tone. This is the kind of stuff that sparks a very particular kind of sadness, of pain, because like I said: Family is complicated. And in a universe such as this, where daddy issues are undoubtedly a very prevalent problem, we can't really be surprised at how extremely powerful the subject of children is.
“And if he does,” Tony proceeds. “We might be even a step closer to solving this. But for now, while he’s gone, we do what we can on our side.”
But he’s too terrified to figure out what else they can possibly break if they once again dare to move.
” Tony concludes, eager to shut down this conversation entirely.  “The only thing I had to do with Ultron is that I
“They evacuated.” Nebula says, and she sounds distant once more, as if she is miles and miles away. Tony can feel her beside him, a solid, physical presence, but her touch doesn’t register in his mind. It’s no comfort, it’s just
“I think he… Tony. You guys need to talk. Steve – he’s feeling really bad about it. He misses the team.”
says, “It’s not a stead, in the normal sense, but it’s not unusual in Asgard that warriors would gift steads to their brides.”
That’s all Tony needs to know. That is all he cares about. If Tony couldn’t stop him before, all he has to do is to make sure the next time they meet, Tony will be strong enough to
“It shouldn’t have been about Ross.” Tony helplessly says. “It shouldn’t. Ross didn’t matter. We could have gone over him,
Natasha turns her face away, mouth twitching like she’s biting the inside of her cheek, eyes trailed on the ceiling in something that looks too much like an effort not to cry.
“I think you’re reading too much into this, buddy. Could be a coincidence.” He hastily says. Because it has to be. Right. It has to be. Space alien, with an alien daughter – with a name of a phenomenon observed in
“Fighting. Together.” Steve slaps his hands on the armrests, just so he keeps his hands busy, trying to shake away some of the incredible sense of vulnerability he’s feeling. Not all of it, though. Just a little. He feels like he’ll need to get used to it. “We can help in smaller conflicts, gather intel, stay out of sight. Even if it’s not much. But it’s not right if we just stand still. I know we can help, and I think we should.”
he had so many reasons. In a life like theirs, the excuse of not having time to do something is almost too easy to use, almost like cheating, because their time never truly belongs to them. It belongs to the world, to the
Tony’s eyes widen, almost hurting with the strain he feels at his nerves.  “You went into surgery with me?” He asks, so shocked he can’t even begin to comprehend the words that are ringing on his ears, their meaning making
“Don’t.” Natasha stops typing, for a moment, to stare at him from behind her shoulder. “Not now, Cap.”
Thor nods slowly. “As soon as the sun rises, I will go to the forge and ask for his help. Stormbreaker can travel through the Realms as fast as the Bifrost could. If Eitri is still there, he should be able to aid us in building another Infinity Gauntlet.”
Tony breathes out an airy little laugh, raising his eyebrows in an amused expression. “Well, can’t have people thinking Captain America is the only one who can fight long range in this campus.”
Tony feels too awkward to step closer and offer her comfort, but he’s sort of glad to see her and Rocket press close to one another, to seek support. Tony had assumed Gamora had been Nebula’s only family, and that she had never been close to the other so-called Guardians of the Galaxy as she’d been to her sister, but seeing this – Tony might’ve been wrong. Or maybe not, but
“Yeah.” Bruce says, unconvinced. “And is the way he looked at you like you kicked his dog also just a coincidence?”
He lowers his head forcefully, almost chin to chest, and Tony can only watch as he sighs and laughs breathlessly to himself, a one-sided conversation Tony can only interpret by his reactions, his thoughts unknown but clearly unkind inside his brain. It’s sad, how the defeat in his posture is the thing that makes the others relax, as if they are all able to sense that Barton has completely given up any attempt of a fight, and only this allows them to believe they won’t try to kill each other if they aren’t ready to intervene.
Wind resistance changes from place to place, also altitude and climate, but in a worst-case scenario…”
“You too, Agent.” Tony says, with full honesty, even though he suspects there’s not a single thing that could have wiped Agent Carter from this Earth against her will, from her strong posture and unwavering will.
“Captain.” King T’Challa greets him amicably, with a nod, and then he does the same to Sam and Natasha. “Mr. Wilson. Agent Romanov.”
“Boss, incoming call.” FRIDAY suddenly says, and they don’t even have time to process the interruption before the audio shifts and a new voice comes in through the speakers, a little too frazzled for the quality of the Compound’s sound equipment.
So he’s not gonna change much. Unsurprisingly, the structure around his waist is gonna stay – it allows movement without losing protection, and let’s be honest, it makes Cap’s figure look
“We’re beyond dangerous now.” Tony laughs, wry. “Whatever we do, it’s not gonna be more dangerous than six Infinity Stones, no matter how hard we try – but we have the tech. And we can go even further: Ultron and Vision for the Mind Stone, the Reactor for the Tesseract, maybe Lang can bring us something to help with the Reality Stone too – if they somehow left a paper trail, we have to find it. Maybe we can use the Stones against themselves.”
the truth, the entire truth, no secrets, no half-excuses. Under her gaze, Steve can’t help but wonder, in a tiny place at the back of his head, the dark corner that keeps growing and growing every day, threatening to swallow him whole, what exactly has happened to Wanda during the time they’ve been apart. Why Steve looks at her and he can’t see that
, he needs to breathe, he needs to sleep, and he needs… he just needs to stop. Stop for a second. Just a second. He knows Wong is not just saying some nonsensical speech to string them on, he knows it – like every scientist looks at an experiments and sees a different way to explain what they see, the way Wong describes what he knows is influenced by his time in this Sanctum thing, by whoever taught him in a language that says physics and magic are the same thing, and that’s
Steve knows what’s the protocol for suspects of terrorism and he knows they wouldn’t allow Bucky to just roam around—
“Aren’t you wondering too? I mean, I had no problem with it, they seemed like they liked each other a lot – but I wasn’t expecting it, y’know? Caught me off guard. I guess this just sounds like it makes sense.”
– as Clint calls it, while he squeezes a barely-reciprocating Natasha in his arms – with a hand carefully placed of her shoulder, and his face composed in a very careful blank mask.
Steve begins to step out of the Quinjet, legs stiff and spine straight, palms sweating in a way he can’t remember them ever doing since he got the serum, his body never before this riddled with anxiety since it became what it is today; And every step is a struggle, every step, an audacity so great he almost wants to take it back as soon as he does it. He tries – He tries to keep himself composed,
Pepper opens her mouth to argue, her eyes lit with raging indignation, but before she can speak, Bruce softly interjects:
, of all people, for an answer – isn’t that just the cruelest of jokes? Him, who doesn’t know anything, apparently.
No disobedience – unless it was careful, calculated. Strong enough to impact, but not so harsh it would cause ripples in the water. The AI had been just the same. He had to be. Tony ached for the presence of Jarvis so much after his passing, why would he change one of the things he had admired so much in the man?
Tony knows better than to believe Pepper is breakable, but he also knows better than to believe she is invulnerable. Tony knows her far too well. Tony knows what she’d probably done in these past two days – he can see it in his mind’s eye; Pepper, panicking under a calm expression and reigning in her own anguish so well that her hands wouldn’t even tremble. Tony heard it in her voice over the call, the strength and leadership that never truly stops lacing her tone because it’s such a big part of her, the instinct of being a protector too great to be suffocated, even by her fear.
Tony strokes his hair. Steve sighs into his neck, oddly sleepy, and presses a fleeting kiss there. Tony lays his cheek on Steve’s temple, pressing his lips to skin, in a soft, shy retribution.
. Because it did. It did, every single second he observed their pictures and reminded himself they weren’t coming back.
” Tony croaks, his heart beating wildly in his bruised chest, the heart monitor attached to him beeping loudly. “I have people— I need to know if they’re ok.”
“She does.” Clint assures, completely unaware of the mental breakdown Steve is going through. He can’t hear it in his voice. Or maybe he can, but he doesn’t identify it as such, his own mind lost in too many conflicting thoughts to be able to catch on the way Steve’s voice cracks when he speaks. “It’s fine. But if you could come by tomorrow, it would be better. We kinda need to talk about some stuff.”
It's finally time. Bucky and Siberia, in full color and sound-surround. Or, you know, in grotesquely long description and purposefully painful language. Same thing.
There’s a beat of silence, tentative and fragile, and Tony waits for a protest or a snide remark that, surprisingly, never comes. It makes something funny unfurl inside his chest.
“We won’t.” Cap assures him. “Thor is going to take me to an advantage point. I wanna talk to them.”
After a long, shuddering breath, Tony blinks rapidly to regain his focus, realizing his heart has started to race and his chest has started tingling, and he needs to
“We need you to be focused, Nat.” he says, unwilling to let this drop so easily. He keeps his tone calm and low, but his voice is firm, because he can take this lightly and simply turn away. “When we go back on the field. I’m not trying to force you into anything, but I need to know if we should be worried about something you’re not telling us.”
“You know we’re not, and we haven’t been for a long time! We might have known how to fight together years ago, but things
And although Steve doesn’t exactly feel like he has the high ground to speak about rights and wrongs anymore, T’Challa’s words do bring a smile to his face, a sort of ironic humor, before he ignores the king’s easy dismissal and continues, “Thank you anyway. Clint really wanted to go back to his family.”
uncomfortable with the idea of not seeing this coming. He feels like it says something about his personality that is not all that flattering, but he’s not sure what that would be. He just— he’s not sure how to feel about this. It’s more than shock. He doesn’t know how to describe it, but it’s not pleasant, and it weights heavily on his stomach.
He pushes his hand firmly against his lips, unable to stop the whimper that escapes him, and no matter how hard he closes his eyes, even when white spots explode under his eyelids and pain flares from inside his sockets, he cannot erase the vision of Pete’s eyes welling with tears and the jerking of his throat, swallowing back a sob, as his eyes rolled back and he turned into dust—
“Yes, Sir. We’ve been introduced when Captain Rogers arrived.” JARVIS softly says when prompted. “It’s good to have you with us, Captain.”
Steve doesn’t want to feel like he’s losing the only people he has in his life anymore. This weird, ragtag group of people, who are hurt and kind of broken, whose normal routine includes far more danger than it should. He wants to keep them. Maybe they are not as close as he thought, not as well-adjusted as he thought, but he wants them to be; If there’s still time to do it.
, wide and unfocused, with huge purple bags underneath, and a pale complexion, and to lock gazes with him is scary, because…. Because that’s what it is.
It’s no more than a whisper, so Tony doubts any of the civilians could have heard, but it’s possible, because the man on the floor says, just at the right cue, “Just leave us here. We’ll be okay, you can leave.”
Bruce looks nervous. His grip on the spine of the book is tight, the tendons on his wrist jumping out as he flexes his fingers, anxiously.
A few hours ago, Steve was contacted by King T’Challa. Not through the phone, no, because Steve is still keeping that phone as an exclusive line to the USA; But through a special communicator princess Shuri had so kindly provided him. As a way to give him some assurance that Bucky would be fine, he presumes, but Steve never used it himself. He felt like it would be disrespectful to Bucky’s wishes, somehow. And it wouldn’t matter. Bucky was not around to answer the call. He knows princess Shuri would be the one to answer if he did try to call, but – Steve has been feeling way too wary, too hurt from
. “And I am sorry. I really am. And I don’t mean that I don’t care about you guys, we are a team, we are friends… and it’s my bad if I’ve been a shitty teammate and a shitty friend.” He shakes his head, pressing his lips together, the picture of uncertainty. “But – I keep coming
Tony has the horrible realization that she is right. No one down here knew what was going on. When people started to turn into dust, no one knew the cause or the pattern, or how it worked, so they had no way of knowing if it would
“I do not… fully know.” FRIDAY admits. “Colonel Rhodes was not present at the very moment Thanos unleashed his final attack, so the footage from the War Machine armor does not disclose fully what happened, but mere moments after the last attack Colonel Rhodes received himself, the
“The marks on it.” Thor asks, voice distant as his thumb sweeps through the ring in slow, careful motions, eyes zeroed on it with the most burning intensity – and that is surprising, because from this distance, Tony can’t see any marks at all. Maybe a small dot or two on the top, that he had imagined might’ve been defects, but nothing he’d think is relevant in any way. “Who created them?”
“I can only imagine he would go back for Gamora.” She frowns, the expression tight in her alien skin. “But if he got the Soul Stone, I doubt she’s still alive.”
Thor hands Wong his weirdly shaped ring back, and Wong gratefully smiles at him, small and contained, his eyes crinkling just the tiniest bit with amusement, and extends his hand to the stairs, to encourage them to walk out first, and they follow easily, even as Natasha and Bruce exchange books between them as they walk, Bruce’s eyes attentive and curious on the text, even if he can’t read it as it is.
“I’m sorry.” The words tumble out of Tony’s mouth, and he can’t take them back, he can’t, he’s already halfway through a speech he has no strength to handle, so he quickly turns it into something else, because he can’t even begin to express what he feels, he
Steve watches the world around him with a weird feeling of detachment weighting down on his stomach. He observes quietly, cataloguing somewhere deep in his mind the way a stout man by the counter gets powdered sugar all over his mustache when he bites into a pastry. He counts the rhythmic beat of the pointy shoes of the lady two tables to the right, as she fidgets in her chair while taking a sip of her hot tea. He loses himself in the low but constant stream of words coming from the news broadcast on the tiny television behind the cashier. It all sounds distant, like background noise, static flooding his ears and making his fingers feel numb around his cup of coffee.
The suit touches down on the landing pad, and, as soon as it does, it starts to disassemble, the parts shifting neatly and opening up, revealing Pepper, rattled, and dirty and ragged, still in a formal white shirt and a pencil skirt, barefooted, her hair stuck into a mess of a ponytail and dirt smeared on her cheek, eyes bright and wide with terror and as breathless as he feels.
honey. There’s no time. I can't fix anything of the planet will destroy itself before I get the chance to fix it.”
He doesn’t want to go back to that time, to that… to that cold night, to the memories of white and red, snow and blood, and
, and he brings his eyes back up in a snap, feeling his neck oddly hot, until he realizes they aren’t even looking at him.
There’s a scream from behind Tony, shrill and rough and laced in pain, and they all turn back to stare at Rocket, as he paces and fumbles at the blue woman’s feet, yelling pleas for answers about the location of his team, aggressiveness and sorrow bleeding together in one wet sob as he begs her to
What the hell are they talking about? Is this… Is this their way of making conversation? Is – Is this what their attempt to have a
“Well, then how do you suggest we manage both the rescue and trying to save the planet?” Rhodey asks, turning to Rogers, not contrary but a little annoyed.
“Take him with you. I would take him myself, but I’ll be away for the next months or so, catching up on some… personal business. Your home is not close to this area. As far as everyone knows, you lost contact with Howard Stark years ago. There is no connection that would allow anyone to reach you, not without being obvious. You will never be the first candidate on the list of people I might trust. He will be safe with you; and you can keep him company while I’m away.”
“I said you wouldn’t die.” A voice tells him, not smug, but close, and Tony’s eyes snap to the left and he’s caught totally off guard by the
“Each metal in Nidavellir is unique.” Thor explains. “Different properties, different spells carved into it. No two weapons forged are the same.”
“Well.” Tony starts, then stops. And when he does it, he realizes he doesn’t know what he had been about to say, not really, so he concludes with: “Something like that.”
“Nat.” he gasps, so softly is barely makes a sound, but the way his back straightens and his hand darts out to hold her forearm before she can get up is more than enough to gather her attention.
He’s the same, but he isn’t. His hair is still the same length, his stubble just as it was before – but his eyes seem less cloudy, less terrified, less hazy. He feels
He wonders if she picked this up from T’Challa, or if they both got it from Queen Ramonda herself. Seems like the most probable option.
He doesn’t need the king’s help. He can get into the Raft alone if he has to. It’s dangerous, he knows it, and T’Challa would suffer the consequences more than anyone else, if the mission failed.
he can hear in Rhodey’s voice. He doesn’t think Lang can tell, or anyone else, because no one else knows the nuances of Rhodey’s authoritarian posture and his slight shifts of strict tone, but
Nebula’s eyes gleam in recognition of the phrase, and with very deliberate movements, she removes herself from her tense stance and relaxes her shoulders.
“Standing right next to you?” Sharon laughs, and pays Steve no mind when he shoots her a very unimpressed glare. “C’mon, Steve, we all know between you and Barnes, you are definitely worse.”
, Steve wants to say, but he doesn’t. Because he can’t explain it. He doesn’t fully understand it. More than teamwork, he misses having them all here, he misses feeling at ease, he misses
Why was it so hard for them to connect? Are they just... too different to function as a unit? Are they really just a time bomb, one that has finally exploded and can never be assembled together again? All the time they spent together— had it been just borrowed time? Were they just… fated to failure?
“Yeah, me neither.” Bruce frowns, and steps forward in a way that Tony can’t ignore him unless he turns his back completely to Rhodey and him, to face the table where the Gauntlet is. “What
“Oh, thank God.” Tony exhales, but doesn’t allow his body any more time to deflate again. “Who else? The Compound is empty, where is everyone?”
Bruce raises his shoulders, looking lost. “I’ve got nothing. I tried asking, screaming – we were in the middle of the battle and he
“I don’t think she has Sanskrit in her database, but she can download some translators and go from there. Might not be the best.”
“I’m more concerned to what’s gonna happen to it after we add the Stones. If we get them.” Bruce crosses his arms, in a posture that’s half defensive, but half thoughtful. “They emit gamma radiation, that we know. Even if the metal is stable, exposure to the radiation from the Stones could imbalance it. Maybe that’s why the Gauntlet was destroyed in the first place.”
“We can’t stay.” The being insists, a little more aggressively, when Tony doesn’t respond. “This is a hostile planet. The atmosphere will kill us both if we stay here too long.”
the Mind Stone, in your own way. Not like my brother, and not like the enemies we faced in Sokovia, and not like Ultron. You found something
“What have we done to convince them she isn’t!?” Natasha asks. “We fought and we destroyed an entire airport, Steve. Wanda dropped twenty cars on Tony. Vision broke a control tower in half. Scott broke the wing of an airplane. Rhodes
“It would probably be the best thing.” Rogers says in a surprisingly gentle tone, not at all the forceful command that Tony has come to associate with him over time. “If you think he could stay.”
“Go on, sit.” Shuri instructs him, gesturing to the bench behind them, made in heavy, dark stone, surrounded by an arch of delicate yellow flowers, vines woven around the tall columns of this gigantic glasshouse. It’s beautiful. The colors are so vibrant they’re almost hypnotizing. “You can wait here. He won’t take long.”
“I am a little busy at the moment, Stark!” Thor bellows, slightly annoyed, not even taking a glance at Tony as he flies over to hover next to Thor as Thor hits a guy gently with his elbow, which means it’s strong enough for the guy to double over entirely.
Natasha takes her hand back, giving the tiniest huff of a laugh. “Just take it from his plate, he won’t even notice it’s gone.”
“I’m countin’ on it. They said you’re a genius.” Rocket muses, and Tony is almost glad to hear the small note of humor in his voice, as weak as it is, because it’s better than hurt, better than tears,
“When you get used to being silent in the barracks,” Steve replies, slowly. “It’s a hard habit to break.”
Before she can take another step, she pauses and looks back at him, an evil smirk on her face. “You better not be implying what I think you are, Cap. I’m not in the mood.”
A few days after they’ve moved to a hotel much closer to Wanda’s and Clint’s, the day of Scott’s trial is announced on TV.
“This size?” Steve gestures to himself, and Tony is a weak man, because he can’t refuse the excuse to
“Vision said she has been practicing.” He comments quietly, his tone losing all of its aggressive inflection, his gaze lowering in a pitiful attempt to show he’s feeling ridiculous for his brief loss of control.
He has to try, he tells himself as he tweaks with tools and wires, the only things that can make his mind calm down these days. He has to try, he tells himself as takes apart and builds back up the same object, over and over and over again, restless in his quest for improvement, for progress, for a solution. He has to try, he tells himself, as he tinkers with his metaphorical heart one more time, rearranging it and forcing it back together, to hold on for one more day, one more time, just for a little while longer.
Tony doesn’t know. He had already been going all out, after years and years of planning, of upgrading, of improving and
That is until Tony vanished into space, and FRIDAY caught Rogers and the others invading the Compound in his absence and running off with Rhodey and Bruce to battle. “But if you went all the way down to Wakanda, how could you fight Thanos in that?”
. Don’t worry, Daddy’s back.” Tony says, nonsensically, as if he was really talking to a child. He wants to sound arrogant and confident, like himself, but it’s impossible as his hands twist nervously and he rubs them together to soothe the ache, to quench the need to touch, to save himself from the nerve-wracking sight of his trembling fingers. “I’m alright, I promise.”
? When they’re being offered help? Jesus, shit, Tony knows they’re scared, he’s scared too, dammit – but they can’t stay here,
They go through Spain, Croatia, Poland, Ireland. They don’t go to Hungary, because Natasha refuses to take a single step into Budapest and she won’t tell them why, and Steve knows better than to press her on the matter. They also can’t go to Germany, because
The blinks owlishly, struggling to readjust himself into the present while also rushing through every motion – and when he finally does, it is astonishing the level of indignation he feels flooded with.
.” Bruce shrugs helplessly, and slaps his hands on his thighs in an awkward, frustrated gesture. “All we have is the math. We don’t actually have the Stones here to check if the Gauntlet is going to hold them correctly or not.”
“Bleecker Street.” Bruce informs helpfully, even though, when Tony looks up, Rogers is staring directly at
Steve doesn’t want to talk. Is bad enough that they can see him like this, they can see how the weight of his secrets are dragging him down slowly, day by day, in the shadow of his beard, in the restless exhaustion in his eyes. Steve has never wanted to be
tired. He truly would appreciate a little sympathy right now, just a little bit. He is not faking it when he wobbles on his way to the couch, just as he’s not faking the wince that escapes him when his movement pulls at the wound under the bandages and stings. Pepper’s hands on his shoulders are gentle and soothing, and Tony sighs and relaxes under their touch, but he can’t truly ignore the dull but constant ache in his legs and arms, the weight of his own head on his poor, stiff neck, and the bottomless pit of darkness and dread that swirls inside him, silent, but fatal, like a black hole, a star that has extinguished and now can never return.
“Four days until we miss the window of opportunity to take out as much ash as we can from the air.” Bruce clarifies. “It’s not immediate, but everything else after that is going to be much harder to undo than if we did it now.”
“He won’t call.” Natasha whispered, startling him a little bit, but not enough to make him jump. He knew she was there. He has heard her come in almost half an hour ago, but she hadn’t said anything, just stood there leaning against the door, and Steve let her, keeping his head down and frown hidden even though he’s sure Natasha can read him like a children’s book just by his posture.
“Then what about the dark energy? You wanna use portals to sneak in behind him?” Barton’s eyebrows shoot up, his expression disbelieving.
“I – I am.” Bruce stutters, like he’s choking on something. “I am. I’m not – I’m not gonna sit here while you guys risk your lives out there. This is my responsibility as much as it’s yours. We have to do this together.”
“I’m fine.” Tony assures her again. He taps at the compartment twice, two quick beats of his fingers, and the only sound it makes is the dull impact of his digits on the casing. It doesn’t click anymore. “See? All set and good.”
He doesn’t care what Tony says. Bucky deserved to be saved, nevermind he’s Steve’s best friend, nevermind Steve owed him that. Bucky was innocent. Nothing he did was his fault, he was being controlled, it was all HYDRA, it wasn’t his fault.
“No, I can’t imagine you would, Captain.” T’Challa laughs lightly, amused. “Maybe you should tell him that. I’m sure that Mr. Stark would appreciate it.”
After a long, painful beat, from where he still stands facing the corridor Barton and Romanov disappeared to, Rogers turns around and, for a brief, unexpected moment, he and Tony lock eyes.
Wanda stares at him with wide, expectant eyes, and something inside of him shudders, overwhelmed with the intensity of her gaze, with the strength of her determination. In a brief, quiet second, Steve has the distinct feeling that he is witnessing the turning point on Wanda’s life, right here, in this hallway, in a forgotten hotel in the beginning of the evening – a moment that could’ve been like any other, but now, it’s not anymore.
“They won’t leave.” Nebula says, with eerie confidence, not giving Tony any time to ponder what the hell Sakaaran trash is supposed to mean.
“Apparently.” Tony makes a gesture that’s not exactly a shrug, but it’s close. It’s too twitchy to be quite what it should be. “It’s where he lived. His people.”
“That night, at the Gala.” Steve says, as he steps impossibly close, hovering over Tony while he sits on the workbench. “I didn’t know you were listening.”
“I know that. Just—” Barton mutters to himself, defeated, before making a sound so guttural and wounded that calling it a frustrated groan is not enough. “God, we’re
“I guess that makes me sound like a complete asshole, doesn’t it?” Steve ruefully laughs, averting his gaze to the floor. “I don’t know how I feel about this, T’Challa.”
“It’s ok.” Tony says, even when he knows Nebula won’t believe him, but he has to silence her and let FRIDAY speak, or else he will lose the courage. “I can take it.”
he actually knows his team. He thought of them as his friends, he really did. He told himself they were a family. Hell, he said so in his letter to Tony, trying to give him – and himself – at least some semblance of comfort, some gentleness to ease the blow of the fight, a sweet reminder that
how Tony will receive the following news, and says, “It appears that James Buchanan Barnes has disappeared as well, Boss.”
When did – When did he become this man, the man who allows this kind of thing to happen and thinks it’s okay? Thinks that it’s justifiable punishment, that
He would, though. It’s true. Tony would come back to her, if she wanted him to, after… after this is all over.
, and now they are watching him as if he’s raising from the grave. Tony, who had once relished in the fact he was the personification of the phoenix, who believed rebirth was the sole purpose of his existence, that resurgence from the ashes was his mission, his destiny, now… Now it feels like disappointment, like he’s disappointed
Rhodey is approaching quick, Tony can see him in his HUD, the red marker blinking to indicate his position moving quickly from the east side towards the main garden – and even though Tony didn’t doubt for a second that Rhodey could handle himself in a high-pressure situation, both with his Air Force background but also by his expert work with the War Machine suit, it’s still…
“What?” Clint splutters, almost choking around the last gulp of water he was taking, laying his glass on top of the kitchen counter before heading to bed.
“I don’t want her to feel like the Accords exist because of her. They are in all of us, not on her.” He confesses, feeling so uncomfortable he takes a step back and turns his body a little to the side, as if that would make him feel less vulnerable. But it

“It’s steel.” Tony says, mostly to himself, his mouth running on its own while his brain gets busy with calculations and theories. “Not very conductive.”
“I am sorry for the abruptness of my visit, but I came here because I have some information that might be of your interest.” He informs, giving them all a look, to make sure they are all listening carefully. “I have been informed that Mr. Lang, the man codenamed Ant-Man, has successfully returned to the United States, as was his intention. His surrender peaceful and there were no disturbances, and all procedures following his arrest are according to protocol and he is now waiting for trial.  I was asked to pass along this message, as this information will not be divulged to public for at least a few weeks further.”
“Not sure if this is the best way to keep track of everything, that’s all.” Sam shrugs, picking up the conversation, and Steve realizes he kind of tuned out on him for a second. “It’s not fair to Nat, you know? I feel kind of bad for her, because she’s the one responsible for bringing us intel. I feel like a freeloader and I don’t like it.”
“It’s like a military system.” Bruce deduces, looking at Rhodey for confirmation. “Right? It’s like being sent on missions based on what your superiors deem necessary, and not just because you want to go.”
If they don’t do anything, Titan is their future. The same destruction, the same silence, the same vast, endless echoes of
I'd like to thank all of you for your patience and I'm very sorry for the delay in this chapter - but as you can all agree, these last few months have been hectic and crazy, and real life definitely took priority over my projects. But I am committed to this story until the end, so hopefully you all know that even if we have delays, I'm not abandoning this. You can all rest assured about that :) I also want to apologize for not replying to all the comments yet, but I will get to that very soon!
, Tony. You're going to risk your life to do something you don’t even know it'll work when you're the only one who can actually fix this is you
Bruce is looking at him like he wants to cry. Like he’s hurting, and Tony’s hurting, and they can’t help each other. They can’t. Bruce can’t help Tony, because Tony needed to be helped two years ago, hell, maybe even one year ago, and now it’s too late. Now the Accords don’t even matter anymore, he realizes with a ruefully, humorless laugh. It was all for nothing. And fuck Tony, right, fuck him and everything that he tried to do to keep people happy and safe, because nothing mattered when Thanos came, all the bullshit he took from Ross and the council and the Legal Team and the UN itself for the past two years, everything the took upon himself to fix because Rhodey was injured, Vision was mourning, and Rogers wasn’t
Rogers’ lips twist in what almost looks like pain, but doesn’t seem surprised or put off by the question. “It’s not a problem. It holds up fine.”
—” and it takes a lot of effort to say this as calmly as he says everything else. “—, they grab Rhodey and Bruce and head to Wakanda?”
doesn’t mean it’s the same thing! You clearly are having some nomenclature issues!” Tony complains, annoyed. “So how are you using it?”
Their relationship gets better too, Tony knows. It’s clear to see, as they stop going for each other’s throats all the time. They’re not best friends or anything, despite Tony’s constant insistence in rubbing the fact that he works with
Tony trusts him. Tony trusts him with this, with Gamma radiation, with all of it – even if Bruce won’t believe him right now.

, exactly, Tony?” Bruce shrugs, verging on despairing, voice rising with a worrisome speed and intensity. “We don’t know how long we have, or how the people out there are taking this! If we separate, we are surrendering ourselves to whatever other danger we might not see coming!”
How ironic is that, that a peaceful solution has left him feeling so bleak, after everything the Accords have caused?
What excuse does Tony have, for his… ridiculously clingy behavior, his apparent inability to cut off these feelings for people who clearly cannot give him the same loyalty back?
Nebula’s expression is conflicted. Her breathing comes out a little hard through her nostrils, mouth tight, and she looks at Pepper with distrust and caution, not daring to avert her gaze to check on Tony, but Tony can tell for her posture that’s what she wants to do.
“He can’t capture audio yet.” He quickly says instead, but it’s not really an excuse. It’s just a comment, something he had to say to replace the tactless words he just swallowed back. The silence would’ve tipped Maria off.
, a duo so powerful they constantly brought the world to its knees, a pair that should never be underestimated.
It has been closed for a very long time, technically speaking, since it now only serves as a storage room that he rarely frequents and the only people who ever entered since he officially moved out was the cleaning staff. He hasn’t been sleeping here since he and Pepper got back together and he moved into his new place with her, somewhere small – or small
Vision looks back at her, nodding slowly, his gaze boring on hers intensely, and Steve sees from the corner of his eye the way Sam shoots Clint a look.
Raw, the way they look up and stare with eyes glassy with tears, the sobs, the sinking nails on skin as they grab the nearest body as tight as they can, not even the sight of Iron Man or War Machine or SHIELD agents or even Captain America enough to persuade them that they are
Steve’s whole body jolts in surprise, and he chokes on a gulp of his drink, his ears suddenly going so red they look like they’re about to catch on fire. “
expected from Thor. They have never been the kind of people who shared these kinds of moments, never have been close enough to even have more than a fun, amusing conversation; Much less something as… As personal as this, something that Thor is so blatantly
“I once encountered one of the other Stones.” Thor says. “The Reality Stone, also known as the Aether. Jane found it, in a gap between worlds, where it was hidden. It was strange, it was… It was not solid.”
, what is wrong with your relationship when you’re already doubting it is the worst thing that can happen.
“I don’t know.” Tony admits. He’s never had to, before. From a remote location with barely any power? Yes. From outer space?
Maybe that’s why Thor, for all his fiery temperament, is so awful at keeping serious grudges. The guy has almost
“The vision the Norns gave me was a revelation.” Thor says quietly, much more quietly than Tony is used to hearing his voice, eyes blue and gold and filled with a knowledge Tony can even begin to unveil, clouded by sorrowful wisdom. “I went to London looking for answers on how to defeat Ultron, and they gave me more than I bargained for – the Maximoff girl showed me the Mind Stone, and the Norns showed me the rest. And I think that’s important.”
Tony had forgotten about them. They don’t deserve to be here. They don’t deserve to be hearing this.
Accountability means being held responsible for one’s mistakes. Steve is aware of the definition. But it also means doing whatever is possible, in the most honest way possible, to help those who had been hurt by that mistake.
“Not like I haven’t worn it before.” Pepper huffs out a laugh, a bit hollow, and the smile she gives him has an edge of old pain that stings on his chest.
Halfway into their completely unrelated conversation, Tony realizes they are sitting very close to each other. And that translates wrong on the way to his brain.
He finds Natasha in her room, siting by the desk, reading the newspaper. Steve spares no time to glance at it and check if it’s in Arabic or English, because his eyes can’t focus long enough to tell; He feels all over the place, his mind exploding but his body heavy, tense and ready to snap, ready for a battle that exists only inside himself.
to him, and they intentionally try to get Tony into situations where they can embarrass him in front of Steve.
I totally lost control of the word count for this one, I'll admit it. I thought it would be much shorter.

“You’d be surprised.” T’Challa cryptically says. “For two people that seem so different, you are very alike in some matters. Giving up is not something you two know precisely how to do.”
“But didn’t we just consider that they all might have the same components? Doesn’t that mean the others might have some sentience too?” Bruce counters, hunching his shoulders.
about it. He’ll be an idiot if he grants them forgiveness, because forgiveness, with them, comes in form of passiveness, of retreating and bending to their will and
He also needs to fix the ship, probably. The Benatar. That thing is not in a very good state. Nebula can probably help, maybe Rocket as well, if he knows the thing well enough. They’ll need it, so they can… go to space. Jesus, the very idea of it makes a shiver run down his spine.
“Okay. No use delaying this anymore, is there?” Tony mumbles, grinding his teeth together painfully for a second, swallowing around nothing and feeling the sticky, disgusting sensation of his blood-stained teeth still unbrushed for days, the bad taste on his tongue.
Natasha stares at him for a moment, and Steve knows realization dawns on her when he hears her take in a too careful breath, before whispering, “You broke it.”
The crowd doesn’t care. Some of them stop, maybe only now noticing there’s someone already on the other side of the fence, but they are the minority – the rest of them keep shouting, snarling at Rogers’ face, rabid dogs ready to attack.
“He can’t.” Tony confesses. “That much power destroyed at once – I don’t think he could do it with the Gauntlet intact, much less broken after already using it once.”
getting better. Despite it all, they do find themselves into a routine, into an almost unconscious acceptance and synchrony with each other’s habits, even when those habits are strange. They even find common ground in strangeness sometimes – Like Natasha and Bruce and their mutual love for super spicy food, Thor and Clint’s loud cheering for the NBA games playing on the big screen, and, yes, even Tony and Steve’s
Steve mutters an affirmative and shuts the phone off before Bruce can say anything else, standing up and heading directly to their belongings, ignoring everything else concerning their previous mission.
Impossibly rattled by his own ease, the instinct to raise his guard so deep-seated he cannot hold it back – he attempts a smirk, something that he’s so used to wear he slips it on just like he slips on his suits, and by the way Nebula’s expression shifts into something aggravated, he thinks he succeeds at stalling her from crossing the threshold where she would see too much.
“There’s room in the west wing, now?” Natasha asks, too casually, with only the appropriate hint of confusion for it to sound innocent, but with a heavy, blatant presence of curiosity under it.
“God, why are you like this?” Natasha shifts her weight, swaying left to right for a brief second, as if she’s having trouble staying still as she listen to this, crossing her arms as if she’s trying to keep herself from doing something stupid. Her voice sounds annoyed and tired at the same time. “You and him, you are
; Thor must be imagining things. They’re desperate, they’re reaching for answers where there aren’t any at this point – and Tony wants to tell Thor that, as kindly as he can, but both kindness and words fail him right now, locked away inside him beneath all the nerves and grief, negative triggers so close to snapping that the urge to block the even simplest consideration that this
“No, you won’t.” Tony sneers. “As soon as I leave this room, you’ll grab the jet and fly to the city, and leave me here.”
in slipping back into his role as the leader, as the one who says orders and expects to be obeyed without preamble, it makes something uneasy twist in Tony’s stomach, something that is not bitterness nor rage, but just as uncomfortable, wary and reluctant.
None of this is Tony’s usual playfield; after all, aircraft has always been much more up Rhodey’s alley than Tony’s – and
“I know.” Steve takes a breath, ignoring the way it sounds so shaky when it passes through his chest, and he forces out a small smile and a huff, trying to keep things light. Just for now. For now, this is enough. “Maybe I should let my beard grow out. Might help with the disguise.”
Sam sits down beside him. Of all people, maybe not counting Clint, Sam is the one who likes high places the most. Steve thinks there might be a joke about birds somewhere in there, but he is too tired to chase it down to fully grasp it between the confusing corridors of his mind. But can tell by the way Sam doesn’t hesitate in throwing his legs over the edge either, not once making a face at Steve, as if he’s weird by deciding to sit in such a dangerous place; Only taking in the sight of the distant city and the nebulous clouds that slowly inch closer from the east, this is a place Sam too can feel at peace, perhaps even more than Steve can, right now.
“Okay.” Pepper agrees, if a little shakily, but flies towards the opposite side with remarkable ease, heading towards the still-standing buildings with careful attention.
is that we’re arguing about things that don’t matter when we should be going over what we have already! We have a lot!”
like her love and devotion simply can’t be mild and gentle; they are ferocious and vengeful, bitingly loyal, and no one, not Thanos nor herself, will stop her from getting what she wants, getting her sister the justice she deserves; and with Rocket’s hand placed on her arm, Tony finds himself genuinely moved with how strongly it all comes together, the sight of them filling him with the most unexpected awe. “And I hated her and I loved her, and I will never forgive him for what he did.”
“Could they be looking for something?” Natasha asks, dubiously. “The Stones. Is it possible that they are searching for something specific across the universe? A host?”
“You guys are thinking about this in the wrong way.” Rhodey interrupts, shaking his head, and they all turn to look at him with confused stares. “The guy is carrying the strongest weapon in the universe with him at all times – you have to treat it like it’s a bomb. A bomb that everyone else is affected by, but
He has imagined it soft and kind. He has imagined it hard and angry and bitter. He has imagined it mute, and he has imagined it loud and roaring, and relieved, and resentful, and grateful and tired and desperate – and all possibilities in between, and none of them had ever felt right. He’s not sure what he had wanted to feel. He had wanted to feel different things at different times. Or maybe… Maybe, a small part of him, had wanted it to never happen at all.
Something in that sentence strikes Steve as odd. He can’t quite precisely say what it is – he only knows it makes him feel on
“We have teams of SHIELD agents out there right now trying to scout safehouses and calm survivors. There’s a lot of rubble, because of accidents. A guy like you, that can go big like a building, could help clear the debris and open passage wherever they may need.”
“The hospital isn’t far away.” Rhodey barks, angry, although Tony isn’t sure if he’s angry at Natasha, at himself, or at the smoke. “We can’t stop in the middle of the way.”
Would he bring Bucky back? Would he turn Bucky in to be evaluated and treated, even with the risk of him being accused of any of the Winter Soldier’s crimes? The very idea of it made Steve’s stomach churn. No,
Steve doesn’t say anything. Wanda exhales hesitantly, and after a moment of consideration, picks up the knife and resumes chopping.
The furious voice inside of Steve’s head growls, affronted and disturbed, and he has to squint his eyes shut and shake his head to keep it at bay, gripping the phone so tight in his hand that he hears the faint sound of the plastic casing cracking at the corners from the pressure.
kill someone?” Tony asks, hissing, teeth gritted tight and so very painful on his jaw. “Because that’s what happened. It happened, and no one held us accountable for it. How many people we wounded or killed in New York back in 2012? And Sokovia? And DC? And Nigeria?
He doesn’t know much about Lang, he’ll admit, besides their brief interactions in Leipzig and inside the Raft – which is… troublesome –, and the repo the general news reports from Lang’s appeal trial. Reports only of course, because even though the Stark Industries Legal team backed up both Lang’s and Barton’s trials from the sidelines, Tony never actually went down there and met them during their standings. What good would it do? Even if Tony knows Lang would have definitely reacted better than Barton – or less aggressively, truthfully speaking –, Tony kept his distance, just in case. So they never interacted much. He doubted his presence would’ve been appreciated anyway; The legal team had done what it needed to do, and Lang had gotten his reduction of sentence, placed in house arrest, and everything had been fine.
“How can that work and not just create a wormhole? When bringing two points of the universe so close together they can be crossed? Isn’t that the
, even if it hurts him right back. Maybe. Tony should be shocked at himself too, he thinks, but he’s not. He really isn’t feeling much at all beyond distress.
“There’s no threat.” The voice repeats, pointedly, from very, very close. Quiet. Low. Soft. “No threat.”
do they think he is that he will start a fight over this with Clint, just because he’s speaking his mind?
She is not asking his permission. She is not even asking his opinion. What she is asking for is his support, but Steve suspects she’ll go through with it even if she doesn’t have it, because this is the choice she has made. Whether or not she realizes how deep her feelings for Vision run, she has decided to act on them, and she is telling Steve this not as his subordinate, only as his
But Tony will never say a word. He will never say anything that will help Bucky go free. Much like the rest of the world, Tony has gone silent in face of what it is left of them, raising his walls so high that no word on the subject will even pass through his lips. All that Steve has heard of him is about the Accords, about the future for the Avengers, about Spiderman or War Machine or Vision or Iron Man. Never about the rest of them. As if Tony can’t bear the thought of speaking their names anymore.
“Are there even any people in there?” Tony inquires, throwing the accusation right at Nebula’s face, uncaring of how she will react for the very first time. He squints at her, suspicious, so damned suspicious and on edge that he can only register at the back of his head that he is accusing a being who has admitted having several knives on them and no fear of using them if necessary, and he doesn’t give a shit.
As you've surely noticed, I talk a lot. Not only that, I am an insufferable debater, and I love analyzing details that have seemingly no importance whatsoever, from every single angle I can think of. I'm also a firm believer that the devil is in the details - and details are a very... troubled aspect of the MCU, sometimes ignored, sometimes completely distorted, sometimes not even considered. So I'll go through it all, one by one, and we'll see how far I can go - and exactly how deep the MCU could've pushed our heroes if they wanted to.
Tony has… a very vague idea of how he should do this. Hopefully, he will be right. Or right enough that he won’t permanently injure anyone. Here goes nothing, he supposes.
She’d be in the hangar all day, and when bedtime came, she’d find herself a new room in the West Wing.
He wraps his arm around hers and pulls her closer, nearly squishing her to his side, and he hopes she understands.
“We need Vibranium, we need to run tests. My armor stood against him in the fight, so maybe some sort of alloy built from my armor and raw Vibranium might be what we need.”
coiling inside his chest, a heavy stone sitting right on top of his heart, and Tony averts his gaze immediately, scolding himself like a misbehaving child.
, his heart beating so fast it sounds like the wings of a hummingbird, anxious and desperate and afraid, trapped inside a cage. “I would never hate him.”
Thor is the one who gives him the chance to act. Enraged, Thor descends from the sky and tackles the man with the guy with all his force, something that would be worrying if Tony could find within himself a single shred of care, ripping the gun from his hands and pushing him to the floor with all his weight – and before Tony can think much of it, he pushes his helmet back from his face and turns around, even if leaves him exposed, and jumps over the car, already looking around like a maniac in search for Cap, fearing that something bad might have happened to him and he had completely missed it through the sparse words said on comms.
“Cap.” Natasha shifts in her seat, debating if she should stand up, support her hands at the arm rests in advance. She looks
“It’s not for me!” Clint says loudly behind him, but Tony is so determined to walk away not even the entire Avengers team could stop him.
” Barton sneers impatiently. “You think I spent all that time on the run without taking a single second to think about what I had done? I did my time, Tony, in or out of the Raft, and I don’t
“I realized, after our encounter with the Sorcerer last night, that there might be something I failed to mention that could be helpful, or some stories that might be old tales for me, that actually hide important truths. It’s not unheard of, to have secrets hidden where everyone can see them, in our history.”
is she here? -, the bottom line is that she broke them. T’Challa broke them too. As soon as he helped Steve and Bucky escape Siberia, he turned his back on the Accords, at least for a little while. He’s still advocating for them, he is still working with them, with
Government is destroyed. Society is destroyed. If someone, somewhere, with enough influence over the less secure people, decided to seize the opportunity to put themselves above others, they could cause enormous damage before they even hear about it. Almost all communication is down. This is –

The culmination of all of Steve’s ignorance, of his ego and his impulses, the proof that his judgment
“Tony.” Rogers calls, and Tony’s head snaps in his direction, surprised. They were all so quiet and so stiff that to hear his name is like getting shocked. Even more so, to hear Rogers’ voice. Rogers has taken off his seatbelt, and he’s sitting sideways in his chair, arm hooked over the back and eyes set on Tony, expression unreadable.
. His legs won’t respond, he can’t even fully support his own spine, but he lurches anyway, because his heart is ripping open and he
“Doesn’t matter, you’ll fix me up in no time.” Tony waves off, but then exhales heavily. “But yeah. I saw him.”

be better.” Bruce agrees, leaning back, even though his leg keeps bouncing anxiously. “And the debrief?”
Christ, he started this. Scott hadn’t even known what he was getting into when he agreed to fight beside them. Steve was the one calling the shots, he was the first to throw the Accords away, he was the one who decided the issue with Zemo had to take priority over the UN. The issue with Bucky, and the other Winter Soldiers. He made that call, and— fuck, it’s so confusing, because he doesn’t

left to give them. He can’t give them trust, he can’t give them even the slightest benefit of the doubt.
“And why exactly do you think you need to worry about me?” Pepper snaps back, indignant. “I am more than capable of operating the armor. Do you worry about Tony when he’s fighting in it?”
” Tony screams at her, his exclamation verging on frenzied, and his throat scratches and burns and tears apart like ribbons, and he wants… he wants… he just wants to know
“Thank you.” Pepper breathes, shakily, and indecisively looks between them both, as if not knowing who to look. “I didn’t know what happened, or where you were, and I was so worried. Thank you.”
“It wasn’t in his heart.” Natasha assures, but her tone is uncertain. She is afraid and she doesn’t know why, because she hasn’t guessed yet. And when she does, it will all be over. Steve will no longer be able to hide behind the ignorance of his teammates. He will never be able to forget this. “You didn’t hurt him if you disabled it. He’s alive, you’ve seen him.”
” Rocket says, cryptically, gesturing to all of himself with a vague hand motion, as if to indicate his very existence. “And even after, you’d never hear me call those morons family, at least not to their faces—"
“As long as you know that.” Sam takes in a deep breath and exhales, then nods, not completely at ease, but somewhat calmer. “It’s done. It happened. Nothing we can do about that now. Just… Just keep that mind, alright? Wait a while, get yourself together, and then go talk to Nat. Apologize. And then you pick that
The same old question, the same line Steve refuses to cross, the issue he doesn’t allow himself to think too much about, because he is so goddamned afraid of what he will find inside his mind if he does.
They all nod, hesitant, and Wanda seems to bite the inside of her cheek to stop herself from insisting he’d stay, her eyes incredibly sad. In the end, she softly says “I’ll walk you out.”, before gently placing her hand in his arm to guide him outside the rented apartment, walking slowly, as if trying to make the moment last as much as she could.
“Who else?” Tony shrugs exasperatedly in his direction. “C’mon. Help me stitching this out, would you?”
“I don’t want to be an a-hole for nothing, but she’s got a point.” Rocket, Tony’s having a little difficulty getting used to that, says. “Your ship is a little… outdated.”
He knows how to do this. It’s not the first time Tony has had to tunnel his vision to make sure he wouldn’t freeze, it’s not the first time his brain betrays him and he has to make do with only the shell of what’s left behind, with only the leftovers… the
, but how could he have known there was so much going on besides what he could see? He… He acted like he always did. He assessed the biggest threat, he made a quick call, he gritted his teeth and did what he had to do. That’s what the soldier inside him commands him to do.
And Steve’s heart stutters a beat so powerful it hurts, too much adrenaline and nostalgia and pain and relief, too much all at once, and he’s glad the comm is a tiny device he can hold with an open palm, because if he had been using his fingers to hold it, the spasm his body suddenly gives would have crushed it under his fingertips.
“I can still trace Miss Potts’ phone signal through my private server. I have detected twenty-four phone calls after the moment of the fall of the population, all made from the same phone. It is unlikely that someone else would have used the phone, considering that eight of those calls were made to

be the explanation for it. I don’t do magic. I do science. And if we’re going out there, and fighting that guy,
“I still am concerned about the Accords.” Steve says, and he sounds nonsensical. Like a child, stomping their foot on the ground when they are annoyed when their parent isn’t listening to them, as if T’Challa is somehow being purposefully difficult and ignoring Steve’s worries. “I still won’t agree with them.”
Dum-E also makes a noise, shriller and scratchier than U, and turns around ungracefully to follow Nebula’s request as she crouches in front of Tony, pushing his shoulders back so he can straighten his spine and she can open his ruined shirt.
And oh, if she found this situation absurd – now, she was positively shocked. Verging on offended, really.
She had thought Bucky had been beyond salvation then. She never had faith in it. She might have believed that Steve would find him, but never that Steve would save him; And Steve
, he has already lost so much because of it, it almost costed him everything, and he has to learn how to let
“Probably not.” Tony concedes, but the math in his head is having difficulties to make itself clear, since his thoughts and feelings are jumping about madly like monkeys in a barrel, the rush of adrenaline still not gone. “But having a base element is a good starting point. Also Vision was not pure Vibranium. Dr. Cho’s cells and the electricity of the cradle and Thor’s hammer – the entire thing is what put Vision together.”
Steve forces his own shoulders to drop, even though the released tension on his back doesn’t help easing the churning of his stomach.
She hums, half in agreement, half in thoughtfulness, and says nothing. The silence stretches lazily between them, like syrup dripping down sluggish and patient, and Tony loses himself in repetitive motions up and down her arm, as the pad of her middle finger strokes a particularly bumpy part of the scar, the ridge of the texture guiding her caress purposefully, and he sighs, not quite content, but something that almost could be.
“Hm.” Oh, no, the hum. “There is no need to be concerned, Captain. Stark will not allow Mr. Lang to be detained at the Raft.”
Tony has always been very good at suppressing things. It is a skill to have, for someone who was led a life like his.
“But that’s important information.” Tony admits, pointing to Rocket in affirmation, after a brief second of consideration.
Clint stops and they all look at him, they look at him and Steve can’t stand it, he knows what they’re waiting for – and he wonders what exactly do they think they’ll do, what are they expecting him to do,
“I don’t want you to leave.” Tony admits, like it’s being dragged out of him, like it’s not something he should say out loud, like it’s weak and scared but it’s the truth. “I know what I do is unfair. It’s unfair to you, it’s unfair how I always break my promise, but please – Pep –”
“I’m not judging.” Pepper kindly replies. “I just wanted to know. If we had to issue a statement or something…”
So, when he finds himself alone in almost two weeks, the first thing he does is open up the comm line and call T’Challa.
She doesn’t say anything. It’s not uncommon either – sometimes, when this discussion doesn’t flare into desperation and anger, it’s filled with long silences and awkward pauses, when words fail to connect into comprehensible meaning, hearts too raw and minds too full of white noise for them to be able to be honest without feeling like they’re pulling teeth at every sentence they utter at each other. That, and the odd feeling of being exposed by just laying here, having just woken up, still tired, still in each other’s arms – it’s hard, to keep the vulnerability out of the bed, the place where it always feels like all the masks and walls just dissolve away. Beds have been places for masks as disguises for Tony for many years before, to perform an act that wasn’t truly him – now, he has forgotten how to keep his shields up while in it, and it’s too late to bring them back now.
Rogers doesn’t say anything. He stares at Tony for a moment, eyes a little too wide and mouth a little too tight, shoulders tense and body locked in what almost looks like anticipation, like he’s holding back something and he’s only waiting for Tony to move to retaliate – but then suddenly, he goes lax, shoulders slumping and brows scrunching in a deep frown, jaw ticking with the force of his grinding teeth.
He gets up with an immeasurable amount of difficulty, every joint protesting, every muscle ardently aching, and he takes the pain as both a focal point and a punishment, not letting himself stray from being extremely conscious of it, because he needs something – anything – to think about that is not just the
I chose wrong, alright? Not because the Accords were good or bad, but just because I made a choice I had nothing to do with just because I got so used to go against some things I didn’t even stop to think
The entire thing is quick and blurry, like an acid trip, but Tony doesn’t feel it registering right in his brain. He feels detached from it, cold, his mind so distant from the present, trapped in the memories of the smell and the ache and the rush of the battle, like he’s shutting down slowly. He’s lost in it, uncertain if he should stay or leave, unsure if he’s able to do either of those things, and in his delay, it’s Nebula and Rocket who step forward, as if hypnotized by the footage, compelled by the sight of their teammates – their
I've made my problems with Wanda no secret, and though I will not call her a villain or anything of the sort, calling her a hero is... difficult for me. I don't think any of you would be surprised about that. But it is interesting, if you think about it, what her presence means in this story and in the other characters' lives, if you dig deep enough. For plot reasons, even. I'd like to show you a theory of mine, so you'll see what I mean. And considering her powers come from an Infinity Stone, it will fit right in with our plot.
“This is what he does.” She says, words heavy with grief. “He invades, planet to planet, and wipes out half of the population. And the rest…”, she stops, and shakes her head, “The rest never recovers or dies slowly until there’s nothing left.”
Howard steps aside, going around her to reach for the keyboard, and she watches carefully while the presses a few keys in a quick pace, faster than she could ever type. It’s a password of some sort. The system name disappears in a flicker, and in its place there’s suddenly a textbox, right at the bottom of the screen, and Howards beacons her closer with a gesture of his hand over his shoulder.
“You did… You did say some things that got me thinking.” Steve admits, and he’s surprised to find that the words don’t feel like a punch in the gut when he says them. It’s just… It’s just the truth. He has to tell her the truth. “So… just know that. I was listening. I have to think about it, but I was listening. I don’t know if I’ll ever agree with you. I don’t think I can. But that’s not the end of the world.”
enhanced individual, of any kind, until very recently. Ever since the Accords have been suggested, various cases of superhuman individuals being legally neglected have been brought to our attention. We hope Mr. Lang’s trial might establish a positive precedent, so we can implement an ethics board and other safeguards, specifically designed to ensure the safety of enhanced and superhuman individuals.”
“You know you can talk to me, right?” Steve asks gently, laying a hand on her bicep as softly as he can, making sure the gesture is so slow she could’ve easily swatted his hand away if she wished to. “If something’s bothering you.”
“That means you’re hiding something.” Sam accuses, and he can see the way Steve’s shoulders flinch at the words. He raises his hands in a gesture of surrender, but his posture shows no submission. “Look, I wouldn’t pry, ok? Not usually. But I walk in here and find you with your hands bleeding from punching the dummy. I didn’t even know you could do that. I thought that freaking thing was just a hologram. How the hell did you manage to hurt yourself like that?”
He wants to stop, and he doesn’t at the same time. He thought he was over this. He didn’t know he was capable of feeling this way, but apparently he is; and screaming it all out, yelling at Barton’s face – it made him feel better, but at the same time, it didn’t. So what else can he do?
And after a pat, his hand falls away, giving Steve one last look before turning on his heels and heading to his room, leaving Steve to his worst two enemies; the enemies that might, someday, be his downfall, even when the worst kind of villains couldn’t finish the job.
And he never finished his upload. It stopped midway through when we got the cradle back. We did try to remove all that was left of him from the body before we uploaded JARVIS, but that was the mechanic, not the biology. The
? People know she’s here, right? She’s literally right by his bed, even though the corridor is empty. People have certainly seen her. How did no one freak out by the sight of a blue android alien walking around with Tony wounded, after all the shit New York has been through? Did Nebula fight anyone so they’d let them in? It sounds like something she might’ve done. But nothing seems broken, not as far as Tony can see, and Tony definitely feels the heavy, sluggish feeling he always feels after a night or two at a hospital, the weight only a drug-induced slumber can cause, so he’s been here for a while.
That’s as far as Tony had been willing to go. That had been another thing where he knew better than to get too close.
How many will die while they scramble to find a long-term solution? How many plane crashes or accidents, fires and smoke, how many starving or freezing or alone or suffocated until they manage to
“Space.” Tony says, and it’s a shitty answer, but he doesn’t think the more accurate one would make any difference. “I was – I was trying to keep the aliens from grabbing what they wanted.”
“You don’t scare me.” Nebula quips back, because that’s how she is, and Tony really isn’t surprised.
“I’m glad you’re here, Tony.” Natasha whispers in his ear, barely there, but the meaning of the words is so raw and truthful that it flows into him like a living thing, and before he knows it, his hands are closing in, and he’s hugging her back, even if it’s shaky, even if it’s still not sure.

, Tony doesn’t have a plan – and that doesn’t solve anything, he knows, okay! He knows. They can’t bring these people back with them, but also they can’t leave them here, and they can’t also trust them to navigate through the night with no help and no resources. But what the fuck can they do? Can they just leave these people here to fend for themselves – when they shouldn’t, when they don’t
He doesn’t know how old princess Shuri is, but it doesn’t really matter in the end, because the fact is that she has just lost her brother, and who knows how many others. She is a princess, and many of her people have now also disappeared. Which also means that if Tony’s logic is correct, she is now, by all purposes, a
“There are six Infinity Stones, ever since the creation of the Universe.” Thor drawls, the same way Tony imagines prophets or storytellers of myths to speak, voice dragged by memories of things too vast and too ancient for others to comprehend.
“It’s an American past-time.” Tony nonsensically replies, and he feels a rush of relief and satisfaction when Steve laughs again at his stupid joke. “I’m
