“Dad, dad, it’s fine,” he quickly consoles. “This is Cas— Castiel— and Jack. They’re, uh...well, they’re good. Nothing to worry about.”
“There’s a lot of angel lore books in the library,” Dean interrupts. “But, y’know, It’s pretty unlikely we’re gonna come across any angels we’ve got to gank. They’re almost as rare as they were before I first came topside these days.“
To Sam’s credit, dad seems impressed. Dean’s not surprised, most of dad’s knowledge on the supernatural had come from library books and field work. He’d never had somewhere like this, permanently transient as he was, as he’d raised them to be.
“I love him,” Dean says quickly. “Is that what you want to hear? That despite everything, I love him? Because it’s true. Or do you want to hear that I resent him? That I’m afraid of him? That sometimes, I actually let myself hate him, if just for a moment? Because that’s all true too. But, at the end of the day, he’s family, and I love him.”
“It’s not a problem you need to worry about anymore,” Dean says carefully. “Yellow eyes dying took care of it. Sam’s a good man.”
Dean struggled to see how a ‘good kid’ could murder their friend’s mother, their own father, but he keeps quiet for now.
Dean thinks he gets it, then. He thinks all the little things locked away in boxes and the things he’s learned have all matched up, come to a harmony, made a full picture. It’s still complicated, and there’s a part of him that will always feel conflicted, but hey, he’s a Winchester, nothing is ever gonna be simple.
“Kid, what the hell are you doing?” Dean asks, except he’s drowned out by dad asking the same thing, much louder.
Dean, who is currently asleep in the motel bed next to the one where Castiel lies awake. He’d taken pity on Castiel, after they’d left Nora’s house, and paid for a motel room for the two of them for the night.
“Your son got in between my bullet and its target. Then he dragged us all here before I could finish the job. So, not only is he some...
Sam chokes a little on his blended vegetables before putting the glass down. “If she hasn’t been home since then, then how do you know she’s safe? I don’t want to worry you, but considering what just happened to your dad—”
Things only go to hell when they get back to the bunker, and suddenly dad is pointing a shotgun at the two figures sitting by the map table.
It starts out fine. Better than fine, actually. The four of them grab breakfast at the diner they’re quickly becoming regulars at. They swap hunting stories from times when they weren’t all around or in the know, and the conversation flows so easily that Dean relaxes into his chair, savouring the moment that feels like what he always dreamed of.
“You complaining?” A bitter voice slithers in the dark of his mind, telling him Sammy certainly hadn’t seemed to mind just half an hour ago.
Dean had never forgotten the things from his own adventures in time travel. For a long time, he thought they were the closest he’d ever get to seeing his mother again, after all. He remembers the first time he’d discovered feisty hunter Mary Campbell and had to add some question marks to the small box in his head marked ‘things I know about mom’. She was raised a hunter, just like they were. Even though, from the glimpses Dean had gotten, they were still more suburban than the Winchesters ever were, with a home of their own and family dinners. That Mary had told them she wanted out of the life, and she never wanted her sons in it.
He doesn’t pay them any attention until Sam comes back, and he gives them both a cheery wave goodbye, his heart not really in it.
His tone leaves little clue to how he’s feeling. Dean was good at this, telling what mood dad was in, but if the man wanted he could still be vague, hiding the warning signs of the oncoming storm.
Sam’s voice is careful, like any wrong word could set off a landmine inside Dean. He knows what Sam is really trying to say. He’s asking
Dad takes shotgun in the Impala on the drive back. He rifles through all the tapes in the glove compartment, reminiscing about the ones Dean’s kept and inquiring about all the different labelled mixtapes he’s put together.
The porridge was cold by the time Castiel had strength to get up. Naomi had tried to feed him manually but he couldn’t even open his mouth, so she left it aside for the time being. It was lightly flavoured, Castiel couldn’t taste much. Either that or his heat was affecting his taste buds. No matter. He forced a few spoonfuls down before lying on his bed again. He had no appetite at all.
Let it go; Dean continues being friends with Castiel, and he can stay by the Alpha’s side. Maybe if he’s lucky these feelings would be temporary and fade in time. Dean won’t have to know a thing and nothing will change between them. Of course, there’s the slight(?) chance that he’ll continue crushing on Dean forever, but if he doesn’t tell Dean, Dean won’t get awkward with him.
Was it because it was a familiar scent? Or because he was the only one who could smell Castiel’s scent? He had no answer.
So here are the two chapters that I've been holding on to for months! By the way I replaced chapter 8 (the update chapter) with the actual story so if you jumped here and missed it you should probably go back :D
Sorry for the late updates. This chapter is a little short, but I have a longer chapter coming up soon. It'll probably be up in a few hours to a day because I haven't proofread it yet, but yay me I wrote two chapters in one day.
“Hey Cas.” He smiled. Castiel returned the gesture, but both Charlie and Gabriel could tell that their smiles didn’t carry the warmth they used to show each other.
However, I did spend the past few days working up new story ideas, and also writing up a plot for this story, so I wouldn't confuse myself when I write, and would have a generic guideline to follow if I'm ever lost in my story. I do hope to continue writing the next chapter tomorrow, and if everything goes well I may be able to post in the next few days.
Gabriel stepped forward and gave his best smile, reaching out both hands in an X formation. Dean and Charlie looked at each other, then slowly took his hand, then were shaken vigorously as Gabriel moved his whole body for the handshake.
HE'S SO WHOLESOME AND GOOD AND CUTE AND HOT AND WAAH I LOVE MAISON AND WEST THEY'RE SO BIG NOW AND ADORABLE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MISHA AND HIS KIDS IS THE CUTEST??? AND HE'S ALWAYS DOING GOOD AND USING GISH TO RAISE MONEY FOR ECUADOR AND I LOVE HIM-
Hello! I took an impromptu break last week so I didn't upload a chapter, sorry! Also stay safe guys, covid swabbing is a horrible experience
Dean arrived panting with only twenty minutes left on the clock. Castiel had eaten with Jo beforehand as their break started earlier. He usually didn’t mind waiting to eat with them, but he’d feel bad if he was going to let Jo starve with him. Their lunch was a little awkward, but it lightened up a bit when they changed their common topic to Dean.
“Hey Gabe, do you really think you could, you know, extract a peson’s scent or smell?” Charlie suddenly asked.
The only thing she could do now was to lighten up Castiel’s mood, however slight it may be. She started prattling about anything and everything she could think of, forcefully jumping from one conversation to the other, sometimes engaging Castiel through questions and opinions. By the end of their journey, Castiel was hanging a small smile on his face. Charlie didn’t want to know if it was genuine or not, she’ll take it as a generous white lie.
“I should’ve been there to help you when Alastair was hurting you.” Dean felt a burning rage just from imagining Alastair hitting Castiel. He tried hard to suppress the urge to go find Alastair right now and teach him a lesson.
Castiel washed up faster than usual. He took quick glances at Jo who was packing her bag. He casually sat down at his seat, slowly packing his bag. Jo draped her bag over her shoulder and waved Castiel goodbye, walking behind his seat.
The lecture ended earlier than usual. As students packed their bags and left, Dean sat on his chair, unmoving. It was taking longer than usual for him to compose himself. He never had this problem with other Omega encounters. He pulled out his phone in the empty room, and privately messaged Charlie and Gabriel separately to inform them about Castiel.
Not a lot of plot this week, was a little down after seeing a discussion about AU fics being OOC and it's not that good compared to canon fics
One of the reasons why I haven't been writing TSB is because I keep getting new ideas on deancas fics thrown into my mind and then I have to draft them and then I get too carried away and now I'm like "I need to write this right NOW" but I can't because I can't concentrate on more than one thing at a time and I'll probably only start writing when I finish TSB which will take a while since I have so many things to cover and I love building up relationships so that'll take another 3 chapters each for something to happen-
I want this chapter to document the day Destiel went canon, not just once, but TWICE, and this time it'S REQUITED LOVE
Castiel chewed slowly on his chicken lettuce wrap as he watched Jo and Dean. They were talking about… something, Castiel wasn’t sure what. Jo said something that Castiel didn’t understand and Dean laughed. He watched Dean smile wider than he had to him in a week. Jo placed a hand on his arm as she laughed with him. They swiftly continued the conversation again.
It wasn’t the first time an Omega went in heat in public. Some Omegas don’t react well to the suppressants, others just don’t take them. A common occurrence. It wasn’t rare for Alphas to constantly be enticed by Omegas that suddenly get their heat in public places. Dean’s got experience, but in Castiel’s case, it was truly the first time for him.
But it's okay, we're all here for the process. Just hope the process doesn't disappoint you guys too much <3
Charlie turned her head back to Jo, who was now smiling sweetly at Dean. She patted Jo’s shoulder, wanting Jo’s attention to herself.
Gabriel, hiding behind a bush, gave the girl a secret thumbs up while the boy wasn’t looking. She nodded and took a large step back, bending down to escape the boy’s arm, and gave the boy a hard push in the back. The boy fell forward, but instead of landing on the ground, he fell even further down the hidden trap. He climbed out of the previously dug hole, pissed, and ready to teach the Omega a lesson, when Gabriel jumped out of the bush laughing.
Legends say that to this day Raphael is still being made fun of for his micropenis (he insists that it isn’t true)
Castiel shook his head. “It’s okay, Dean. You can’t be there for me all the time. The thought is enough. Besides, I’m fine! Gabriel came to my rescue.”
Jo returned to her seat with a tube of red, white, and black. She squeezed the amount she needed on her palette, then carefully handed the white and black tubes to Castiel. Castiel gratefully took the paints as Jo gave him a small smile.
Pursue; Dean would be mocked for having an Omega that reeks, that is, if he even succeeds in winning Dean’s heart. That, or he makes it so awkward between them that Dean can’t even continue being friends with Castiel. Now that would hurt.
His elation was utterly squashed like a truck running over it several times when he saw a blonde Omega sitting under the big tree.
He packed up and headed downstairs, deciding to stop by the toilet before embarking on his little walk alone. The second he pushed the door open, he froze.
I know a lot of people like to describe Cas’ eyes as baby blues, but to me his eyes are a deep beautiful blue because I watched a panel with solo Misha a long time ago and even from far away (the camera was quite a distance from the stage) you could see his eyes were literally sparkling deep sapphire blue, like literal gems in his eyes, under the light every time he moved his head and I was so mesmerized I sold my soul to him from that day on, and I wallow in despair everyday knowing that I will never see that beautiful man ever in real life
Dean looked up at Castiel, and tilted his head. He raised an eyebrow, and Castiel realised that he was confused.
Castiel spent his Tuesday alone. He’d left the classroom without waiting for anyone to go hide somewhere for lunch. When the group chat started buzzing with worry and concern on his whereabouts, he simply responded with a short message on his location and safety, then tuning out the group again. He’d found a place in the after-school activities building. Go up the lift to the third floor where it was just empty. There weren’t any rooms, just a confined space and a long hallway to what seemed like a janitor’s closet. He sat down and brought out his lunch box, and started eating.
Dean could proudly admit that he had a very strong willpower, stronger than most Alphas, and could still be in control of himself when near an Omega in heat.
He coincidentally passed the trickster while he was setting up for a prank. Gabriel saw the black-haired boy approaching and signalled for him to be silent. Castiel stopped in his tracks, and soon a skinny boy appeared. The boy was strolling along with one arm wrapped around an Omega girl. The girl was very obviously disgusted and reluctant, but didn’t fight off the Beta.
“He’s so cute! And his pretty eyes, and his nice drawings! Geez, I wonder why people can’t just look past his… condition.” Charlie frowned a little. It was obvious that she’s taken a liking to Castiel.
“No worries, you were scared, I understand. Also you gave me a proper enough thanks, so we’re cool.” Dean grinned brightly, giving him a thumbs up. Castiel could see why he and Charlie are friends. They are so similar. Castiel returned his attention back to preparing for the class as the teacher walked in, having no intentions to further interact with Dean. Well, not until a folded piece of paper landed on his table.
Cas' transformation has just begun! This wasn't in the original plot I drafted, but hell we're going so off the rails we're practically stumbling into new territory now (probably the reason why I keep getting stuck; thanks characters with a mind of their own), so let's see where this takes us! Woohoo! Even the writer doesn't know what's going on!
I might also rewrite the first 9 chapters because they were written a long time ago, and I think there are a few parts that I'd like to change. We shall see.
Imagine Dean teaching him how to do human things even though he really doesn't need to because he's an angel but he insists because he wanted to spend time with Cas and it turned out to be useful anyway when Cas became human
The two sat quietly in the car as Dean drove. Castiel slumped down in his seat and looked out the window, hugging his bag tightly. He should be happy Dean showed his face today, but he couldn’t. The short reunion scene from earlier was still fresh in his mind. Jo and Dean had known each other, apparently since a long time ago, but he couldn’t find out more details as Jo hastily left with Ruby after exchanging numbers with Dean. He peeked at Dean’s reflection from the window. He was smiling a little. Castiel could tell he was humming, even though the radio and the sounds outside were covering it. Castiel sunk lower into the seat, his bottom lip protruding out in protest. He really wanted to ask about their relationship, but he was too scared to speak. He shuffled in his seat and turned his body towards the window.
Castiel doesn’t usually talk to people. He watched as Castiel laughed and smiled as he talked with the unfamiliar boy, his arm slung over Castiel’s shoulder, and the strange emotion got a little stronger.
he’s not backing down. Alastair tidied his sweater and walked towards Castiel. He doesn’t budge. Alastair stepped closer, and closer, and… walked past him out the door. He was extra careful to not bump into Castiel in any way as he twisted his body to avoid the Omega standing at the doorway that gave little space for two people to fit. Castiel waited for a few more seconds before letting go of his held breath, his heart racing so fast that he felt a little dizzy. He unconsciously turned back to his nightmare before jerking his head back. He didn’t care, it was better for him that Alastair ignored him anyway!
He hurriedly typed a response to quell the trio’s concerns, and specified his location. He reassured them that he’ll be fine as the messages poured with all of them offering to go get him. His attention lingered longer on Dean’s offer, but as much as he wanted to see him, he wasn’t ready.
That video lives rent free in my mind and I cry at his beauty everyday. I wish I still remembered which video it was because I really want to see those twinkling blue eyes again
And Castiel added it to his ‘List of Reasons to Let Go of My Feelings towards Dean Winchester,’ which currently only had two items on it. Two very compelling items. He made a mental note to definitely change the name into something less long winded.
And right now, the bloodthirsty Alpha was showing his mind-controlling Master a picture of his little brother Sam.
11/12 April 2018: Hi! If you have read the previous chapter before this date, the chapter has been edited! I've changed some things here and there, so please go back and read it if you haven't already! Thank you!
The statement repeated endlessly as he entered the toilet, the persuasion falling flat as the image of a handprint-shaped bruise he saw on the Alpha’s arm in the reflection kept replaying in his mind.
Thank you all for reading! I always enjoy reading comments, it has given me so much motivation to write every week.
“Oh. That’s fine. Hope he’s doing okay.” Castiel forced out a smile. Gabriel placed his hand on Castiel’s shoulder and squeezed, pulling him closer.
He was interrupted by the familiar knocking pattern. Castiel shot up from his seat and grabbed his bag. With his usual vigour, he swung the door open to see… Gabriel. The older boy ruffled his hair and dragged Castiel out of the classroom when he saw that the Omega wasn’t moving.
himself today. He looked back at Dean, who was now reaching his arm out to tap the table next to him, an obvious message to Castiel. Castiel sighed. If Dean wants to suffer, so be it. He swiftly put his bag on the table and sat down, before realising that he’s against the wall. He has nowhere to run. His brain immediately thought back to the day before, and his heart started beating.
“Didn’t you see how upset Cas was? Don’t you think I need an explanation for your sudden change in attitude? He’s our friend!”
It seems that I am experiencing a writer's block! I spent the whole week planning the chapter I was stuck on. Still not too satisfactory, but I'll write it first and see how it goes. Hopefully everything will go smoothly after!
The lively mood didn’t die down even as Gabriel patted his two juniors to get them packing for class. The three left together, all carrying smiles on their walk. Castiel and Jo turned around at the same time and waved goodbye, then laughed at their accidental synchronization. Dean and Charlie waved back, and watched as they left. Charlie’s gaze landed back on Dean as she turned her head, and Dean knew what she wanted to ask.
In addition, I will be updating tags as I go, since I’m unsure about how the story will  proceed in the future too, but I will try to tag beforehand or put warnings (if any) at the beginning of a chapter. If you feel that I should tag something or put a warning for something in a future chapter, please do let me know!
Rhetorical. He scoffed at himself. Dean was his strength, and now he’d lost it. Out of his own carelessness at upkeeping his Omega nature. How could he forget? How could he step out of line to think that anyone would want him? A putrid Omega like him? What a joke.
Then I learnt more about the premise and my cold dead heart sprung to life, clawing its way out of its dusty coffin the same way Dean did all those years ago.
Castiel knew not to overstep his boundaries as an “acquaintance,” and gave Jo her space and decision to let him know what happened herself, if she ever wanted to.
“I was a little rude. I ran away and didn’t even properly thank you.” Castiel didn’t dare look into Dean’s eyes, so he looked down at his empty table.
Castiel turned his head to see Dean red as well, his head looking down. Castiel picked up the piece of paper and unfolded it.
, he thought, as he looked at Alastair who was frantically rolling his sleeve down to cover his arm in front of the mirror. Castiel could swear he saw a moment of fright in his eyes, but when he turned back again, his gaze was cold and glaring. But Castiel was unfazed. That moment of fear somewhat emboldened him, and he stood his ground, glaring back at Alastair. He even made sure to squeeze his eyebrows extra hard so Alastair
The feeling felt awfully familiar to his first day of school. He was also alone, without anyone, eating his lunch and feeling bleak about everything. Things seemed to return to the way it was supposed to be. He was the stinking Omega, whose smell repulsed everyone around him. He would have no one beside him, and everyone in school would either bully him or ignore him. That was how it had always been, and how it will always be. The past six months meant nothing, just a nice little dream he got to experience before he had to wake up and face the harsh reality that he was unwanted. And the worst part was he brought this upon himself. He forgot his suppressants, he forgot his
“If I could extract Cassie’s smell, I bet I could come up with a better way to deal with Alastair.” Gabriel smiled mischievously.
“Sorry, lecturer wouldn’t stop lecturing.” Dean explained through gasps of air. He observed the seating arrangement. Castiel was alone on the left, while Charlie and Gabriel were on the right, with Jo positioned right in the middle of them. Charlie held on to Jo’s arm as she looked at Dean, her head discreetly nodding towards Castiel. Dean awkwardly shuffled beside him and sat down. Even if Charlie didn’t ask him to, he would’ve done the same. It would’ve been weird—and too obvious—if he’d chosen to sit at the populated side.
What does he do with it? Does he pursue it? Does he leave it and hope it fades as time passes? The latter option seemed incredibly difficult considering that he literally sees Dean everyday. He’ll be reminded of how gentle and kind the Alpha is, as he uses those beautiful green eyes to look at him…
Castiel wasn’t sure if Dean was going to show. He was unsure about a lot of things lately. The boost of encouragement from the previous day was heartwarming, but after the initial feeling ebbed away, all that was left was uncertainty and fear again. He checked his phone again; no new messages. He didn’t want to seem clingy and text Dean first, so he just sat in the classroom like he always did. Waiting. Then came the knocking before he could go any further with his unease. He opened the door slowly, now losing the excitement that he always had before. He hugged his disappointment close as he looked up.
Castiel’s heart started beating faster, though he was unsure whether it was because he probably made all his friends panic at his disappearance, or because Dean actually
Castiel looked up towards the whiteboard, where the young Miss Milton was trying to teach. Castiel could catch her little nervous shaking whenever she stopped talking. Dean was whispering “hey” and unrelenting in his attempts to engage in a conversation. Miss Milton was flicking her eyes at Dean occasionally, not knowing whether she should call him out or not.
It's the time of school semester where assignment deadlines are starting to cluster together, so I'll probably have lesser time to write. Also I have been waiting for news on my internship and when that starts I'll have even lesser time, so I hope to at least update this story faster, but probably wouldn't happen.
I also apologize for any bad writing, it seems that I can only write stories at night to 3AM. (Of course that doesn't excuse bad writing)
I want to plan a fix-it fic but I really don’t know how I would write it in the way that other fic writers have already beautifully ended it, but either way 15x20 never happened and destiel went canon and they all lived happily ever after until they grew old and died and met in heaven again thank you for coming to my tedtalk
Dean tries to get something out in response to that. To tell Jack that yeah, maybe dad will think that, but it doesn’t mean it’s true. That Dean knows Jack isn’t evil, even with the things he’s said before, and Jack’s mistakes, and the whole soul situation going on right now. But the words won’t come.
“You’re John Winchester.” Cas cocks his head, and for the first time in a while Dean remembers just how intense, otherworldly, vaguely terrifying that gaze can be, even if it’s not directed at him this time.
Sam scrolls through it as he talks. “So, it turns out Henrietta is best friends with the sister Caleb mentioned, Amy.” At this, he clicks on an image of Henrietta and a blonde girl with purple tips, blue eyes and a shredded punk t-shirt— the two of them don’t look like they fit together at all, but clearly they’re close.
Dean shoots him a sharp glare. Sam should be taking advantage of this second chance. “That was then, this is now.”
Dean grew up on stories of Mary Winchester, a devoted wife and mother who makes meatloaf and pie from scratch and wouldn't know a glock from a shotgun.
those few things he’d had to and managed to keep locked away from dad, and this can be one of them too, it has to be. The nature of Jack...and, well, some things about Cas too.
“Huh.” John hums. “And here I always thought the bastard just ran out on us. Always wondered what kind of man does that to his kids...but, if he was a hunter, I guess it all makes sense now. The hunt...it has to come first.”
They don’t know who the witch may be targeting: if they stick with the one parent thing, then it’s either Miranda Kane or her husband Matthew Kane. They have three daughters: Melody, Maria and Mckenna. When Dean first heard that stupid matching naming scheme, he was half tempted to leave the witch to it, but that’s not the point.
Dean suddenly feels kinda bad about poking at the kid, especially when he thinks they’re just nosy cops [he knows how shitty it is to have cops poking into your family life], but it’s for the greater good, the best thing they can do is stop whatever is doing this, and for that they need to ask some uncomfortable questions.
Cas smiles then— a small but real thing. For the first time in a while, Dean lets himself look, lets himself really smile back.
Castiel squirms on the bed. He undoes his button, pulling down the zipper. He tells himself he’s still not going to touch, he’s only doing it for the relief the freedom will bring him.
Henrietta Williamson trails down the stairs after her father. She’s sixteen, if Dean remembers correctly. She looks it, at least—  kind of gangly in a way that suggests she hasn’t stopped growing yet, long brown hair falling straight down her back, dark circles under her brown eyes.
“Shouldn’t he?” she snaps back, finally turning to look at him. “It’s my life, Dean! Did you think I just didn’t deserve to know that I was...what? Some cosmic-baby making machine? That what I thought I felt for years didn’t even come from me?”
Him, Sam, and more recently, Cas, have done this a lot. They have a whole system— coffee and copious snacks from the Gas n’ Sip, Sam listening to his podcasts with one earphone in or talking with Cas about ancient languages, Dean flicking through his tapes and explaining to Cas the meanings of the songs and how they were made and what inspired them, Cas telling them both stories from long before Sam and Dean were born, Dean and Sam bickering over silly things and telling long-forgotten jokes. It’s...it’s a routine, Dean realises, and a damn good one.
(If there’s some things Dean leaves out, it’s only to condense the story. It’s definitely not because when he considers telling dad about all the times Sam died— how he’d failed his most important job time and time again— the words get stuck in his throat, choking him until he feels he can barely breathe.)
“I know you don’t like dad,” is what Dean ends up saying, and he realises it’s not the right thing to say even before it’s left his mouth.
“Okay, I think we have all we need for now,” Dean says, already shifting to get up. They hadn’t had a chance to interview the mom, or Amy, but they’ll do what research they can on them back at the motel and see if this interview qualifies for a sequel.
Caleb throws the kale and whatever the hell else goes into a kale smoothie in the blender, holding down the button, but the way he’s leaning on the counter means his focus is still on Sam and Dean.
Dean’s attention is drawn by a weight settling next to him on the bed and looks back to find mom sitting next to him now, watching dad and Sam reminisce.
He looks at them and there’s...a disconnect. Something about this entire situation is just...a little bit to the left, leaving a missing space at the side, pushing other things out of the picture.
“Not much time for fishing, when you grow up a hunter, is there?” She asks, sympathetic, but there’s an edge to it.
Maybe if he explained it now, it would be fine. After all, It’s a long time in the past, right? None of it was pretty, especially when Ruby got her hooks into him...but, looking back on it, Dean can admit he may have overreacted at points, if only to himself. Sam had made some mistakes, and he was
Dad looks up from behind his newspaper (they’d explained to him it’s easier to get news online now, but he’d insisted on a paper)
“Sure,” she says after a beat, taking the drink and holding onto it like a lifeline. “I suppose you better come in.”
“Miss.” It comes out deep, rumbling, almost a growl. “It is not an ultimatum, Dean. I am not doing this to force you into a position you don’t want to be in. It’s not my place to tell you what I think you should and shouldn’t do when it comes to your family. It is my place to look out for mine, and if I can’t do that for you, or Sam, or Mary, at least I can do it for Jack. C6.”
Dean grunts in response, beelining for the coffee machine. Thankfully, there’s already a fresh pot waiting. Either Sam is already up and out for one of his (disgusting) early morning runs, or Jack is finally getting a hang of not burning the kitchen down during simple tasks. He pours himself a mug and chugs half of it, topping it up before sitting across from Jack.
Jack goes to bed first, because he’s two years old. Dad goes next, though he throws another charged look at mom before he does. Mom doesn’t retreat to her room for another twenty minutes, but as soon as she’s gone Sam suddenly yawns, loud and very fake, and hustles to his own bedroom.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Dean is immediately on the defensive. He has a bad feeling about where this is going.
“Well, let’s hope you can pull it off fast,” Sam says suddenly, cocking his head towards the window. “Because I’m pretty sure that’s your sister.”
“Yeah, I’m good.” He says, making his distaste for smoothies clear in his tone. “So, what do you mean by Amy
“What’ve we got?” Dean asks, sliding into the seat next to his brother to peer at his laptop screen.”
The third day of dad being back, they work a salt and burn here in Kansas, a few towns over from Lebanon.
“Dean,” mom says, quiet, awkward and uncomfortable. “I want you to know...even if I don’t like this destiny thing, and even if I have no idea how I feel about your father...the one thing about all that I don’t regret is you and Sam.”
Dean starts, because half the people in this room wouldn’t know how to kick back and relax if it bit them on the ass.
He forgets all about it when she comes bundling back in, arms full of chinese food. Jack helps him set the table, because with everyone here it feels like an occasion that deserves more than eating straight out of the boxes.
“They had not. Well...except Hank Peterson, but the way he described I thought he’d just dropped some acid and watched a rerun of Creature from the Black Lagoon.”
“Hey, Caleb,” Sam says, placatingly. He tries to make himself small with his body language, in that way that always seems to work despite his towering status. “We’re not accusing you of anything, but can you explain to us what you’re doing here?”
The bed is unmade though, that’s the first thing he notices. The next is the brown leather bound book lying on top of the blankets.
Gabriel looked at her puzzled. “Well, I guess? Nothing is impossible. But I think it’d be more of recreating a smell than extracting one. Why, you wanna extract a smell?”
It's a long chapter, but I feel like nothing happened lol. I just couldn't get any creative juices working because of the disappointment and stress the whole week so I word vomited this one out, hopefully it's still not too bad. In other news, I signed up for DCBB! Really hope I can get out a fic for it. Fingers crossed!
It’s already the second day of the week, and the official timetable will be out next week. Which meant three more days to get acquainted with Castiel before he gets even lesser time. Dean doesn’t really know why he’s so fixated on the Omega, but he always trusted his instincts, and his instincts tell him that he
For once, Donna and Jody were doing their jobs. They briefed the class on a coursework project that they will submit individually for the first six months of the next school year, a different assignment from the paired project they will do in the second half of the school year. They explained that all art media were acceptable, and passed out a sheet of paper for the marking rubrics of the project.
Recently the Castiel sewing his trenchcoat video resurfaced again for me and I'm about to cry he's so cute
tree, and the rumours of its cooling shade peaked the interest of every student who knew about it. But, the rumours don’t end there. People say that the tree was being guarded by a bloodthirsty Alpha and his Master, a witch who could control Alphas. Students who returned safely from the big tree swore to never go there again, and urged other students to stay away if they valued their lives.
Jk I just want to give Cas a nice ending if he can't get his in the SPN universe. I'll be honest, I stopped watching after Season 13, but I never stopped thinking about this story.
A taste of friendship made Castiel addicted for more. He became greedy, even though he should be happy with what he had. He wouldn’t even
God: so did you let dean and cas finally  confess their undying love for each other and gave them a happy ending?
Castiel packed his barely eaten lunch and reached for his phone to set an alarm. Maybe a nap would help him escape these feelings for a while. He unlocked his phone with his fingerprint and the first thing he saw was the abundance of spam in the group chat. He pulled down the notification bar and saw three missed calls from Dean.
The discussion mentioned how in AUs it's not the same deancas we fell in love with, but then I once saw someone say how AUs are beautiful because even if deancas lived totally different lives they still manage to come together and fall in love all over again.
It was then that the boy looked down and realised that he was covered in glitter and glue. His entire body sparkled under the scorching sun, and when he moved, glittering dust detach from his colourful body. He screamed, but he knew that he was up against Gabriel, and there was nothing he could do. Gabriel took out a paper that wrote ‘Twilight Boy’ and slapped it on the boy’s chest as a final blow. As the boy walked off, humiliated for the rest of the day, Gabriel and the Omega girl shared a high-five, and the girl gave Gabriel some money before leaving.
I've been working on sleep deprivation the whole week and couldn't write at all. Hopefully I get back into the groove so I don't have to delay updates again! Have a great day everyone, and happy birthday Dean! I love you <3
“Dean, can you please pay attention to class?” Miss Milton tried her best to look stern, but her pretty facial features only served to make her look cute. Some boys in class gave the young Beta heart-eyes, and upon noticing this, she quickly blushed and turned back to the whiteboard.
He sat around for a little longer, until he felt too bored sitting in a quiet space that could make his mind run wild again. He had two options; run to his next lecture hall and hide or take a walk around the school. Option one was probably the best option, but he figured it wasn’t worth it to keep hiding forever because of one Alpha. In fact, he’s feeling a bit lucky today. Might be worth taking the risk.
“He’s busy, I know.” Castiel forced a smile that barely lifted at all, and walked out the door, the Beta quickly following behind.
Also, 10k hits? Thank you so much! I never thought this little fic would get so much attention when I first started (at one point I went "why did I choose ABO for my first ever writing") but I'm having so much fun developing and writing! Thank you all for reading!
I went back to reread what I wrote, and honestly (cringe) but eh, not so bad. Past me had written the first paragraph of chapter 10 and I really left zero hints on how I wanted it to go, so I decided to wing it, and it came out better than I expected. My original planned Gabriel entrance was actually really lame, so I guess sleeping on it for over a year worked out in the end?
“Aww he’s grown so much! I remember when he was just a tiny bean!” Charlie snatched Dean’s phone and repeatedly zoomed in and out of Sam’s face. Dean shook his head, smiling, and went back to his lunch.
Sometimes I go about my day and suddenly I remember that Cas is in love with Dean and it's such a huge news to me I have to take a few minutes to process the information in disbelief because Cas is in love with Dean (canon)?????
“I don’t wanna talk about it.” Dean weakly responded, turning his attention back to his barely eaten food.
Castiel’s vision was cloaked by tears again. He berated himself disingenuously, as he scrolled through the messages that have long stopped, possibly to allow him to catch up. He smiled at the confirmation that his friendship with them was real, that it wasn’t just a dream. His heart skipped a beat when he saw Dean’s messages;
To start them off, the pair of teachers gave the class a graded assignment for a week that will commence in the near future. Then, they let the class paint something monochromatic, using any colour they like.
Hey guys, sorry for no updates last week. I had an interview for my uni enrolment and i’m the type to stop everything i’m doing because of one thing. Anyways, pretty sure I flunked the interview so that’s a huge bummer. In other news, I for some reason decided to handwrite my draft for the plot (ouch my hand) but i think i have a clear direction on how to go now. It is long, i have a lot to cover, and it'll focus on some of the other characters as well.
Just this time. He’ll forget about his feelings for Dean after his heat. He just needed the Alpha to get him past, then he’ll be ready to let go.
Pardon for any mistakes, I don't tend to proofread in detail because then I won't be able to move on from the chapter. All this is just type-and-go
“Your little commotion last week didn’t just affect you.” Castiel tilted his head, his eyes darting between the stranger and a tense Jo.
Finally! I've reached my first plot point (lol). The story is taking a turn into a less happy tone but I'm fighting my brain to keep it a little fluffy. I do have to warn, there'll be a few more warnings in future chapters, but nothing too serious (hopefully, I haven't written the chapters yet). The romance won't be too straightforward, it'll be a companion alongside the focus of character development which I hope I won't butcher, so if slow romance isn't really your thing, sorry!
Castiel clamped his mouth shut as he came. The heat slowly faded into a small warmth in his chest, simmering and waiting for the next wave so it could spread again. Castiel laid panting on the bed, taking the dildo out and throwing it aside.
Gabriel?!” Charlie sat up, her eyes gleaming. Dean looked at her in confusion, but she had no time for him right now. She stood up and quickly pulled Gabriel to her side, and sat them both down. Castiel silently sat down beside Dean, a smile hanging on his face.
(I've been listening to Alice by Heart a lot recently [it's a musical] and I'm wondering if I should plan a short one shot around one of the songs...)
Was Dean really that happy to see Jo? He hardly smiled at him the past few days. If this was what jealousy felt like, it sucked.
Castiel’s chest was tight and he felt out of breath. Suddenly everything about Dean hurts. It hurt to realise that Dean deserved a better Omega, anyone but him. He’s such an amazing person, Castiel didn’t deserve to have him. Not that he could.
The two didn’t exchange even a simple “goodbye” as Castiel alighted and walked into the house, refusing to turn back for a glimpse of Dean, afraid of what he might see. He fumbled with the lock as he listened to Dean drive away. Once the sound of the old car’s engine faded, he let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding, and along with it came the tears that were being contained throughout the ride. He quickly wiped his eyes and entered the house, running straight to his room, knowing Naomi wouldn’t bother him anyway.
He wiped any intention to get up and pick a colour from the paint rack. Black felt right. He squeezed some white out to mix shades of grey, and applied the dull colours to his canvas purposefully, each stroke of his brush carrying his fears and worries.
, and a few gifs of a worried cartoon dog. Hovering his thumb over the screen as he paused at Dean’s message, he gripped his phone a little tighter as he hoped, so badly, that this was a sign. A sign that Dean wasn’t being obligated to stay by his side, that he didn’t really hate him. Disgusted, maybe, but not hate.
Dean went for his lecture after lunch break, trying to get past the day. He had already relieved himself earlier, but his clenched fists served as proof that he was still uptight about the whole incident.
They were not allowed to use pictures of the internet, they had to source their own references from real life, pictures taken by themselves. They were to choose from a list of themes that will be given to them at the beginning of the project, and they couldn’t bring their project home to continue. If they wanted extra time on their project, they’d have to stay back in school. Donna explained that these rules will apply to the paired project as well, and a larger scale of this project in the third year of school, amongst other classes. She warned them that the first year was going easy on them, and that they’ll need to get their shit together if they want to survive the rest of the two years drowning in deadlines.
But seriously thank you all for the comments and kudos it makes me think I'm doing something *right* and tells me it's okay to keep going and write as I wish!
Naomi came to pick up Castiel immediately after taking a day off work. Castiel had just survived the third wave of his heat. She opened the door to a half-naked boy, weak and panting on the bed, his eyes filled with tears as he silently stared at her. The sight broke the woman’s heart. She helped him put his clothes on, receiving a fresh set of pants from the Omega Wing’s supply room, and enlisted the help of a Beta nurse to carry Castiel onto the ride that Naomi had called.
Aaaand that was the end! I hope you all enjoyed the story, and please leave comments on what you thought about it and criticisms are always welcome! Thank you very much, and I will try to post the next chapter as soon as possible!
he thought. Forget them being similar, they are practically the same person. Castiel rolled his eyes, and picked up the paper. He unfolded it to reveal a nice little message written in black ink -
Also not me still being traumatized by the finale so much that I couldn't write this whole week and had to consume copious amounts of Destiel and Jenmish panels to survive
Castiel’s heart warmed a little. He tilted his head slightly to look at Dean, who stopped trying to talk to him. Castiel is appreciative of Dean’s concern for him. Maybe it was time to try and trust again.
The two goofballs’ laughter somehow managed to echo outdoors. In the near future, rumours of laughing ghosts lingering near the big tree in broad daylight started to spread.
Thanks for reading! Sorry for the long wait, and sorry if this chapter kinda sucked. School started and my writing skills aren't getting any better.
From here on a lot of my chapters have been hitting 3k which I don’t know if it’s good because it means *content* or just being long winded. Sometimes I wonder how I hit 18 chapters without getting to the main point yet??? Stop being so long winded???
Also, I have another story idea that I wanted to write, but have been debating about whether I should start because then I'd have to write two stories. I don't know, we'll see.
He shut his eyes to pretend to sleep as he felt tears welling up in his eyes. He didn’t want Dean to hate him even more.
“Haha, not really. It’s not like he can always be by my side, right?” Castiel let out an unconvincing chuckle. Gabriel caught a hint that something was wrong, but he didn’t know what.
Gabriel and Castiel had to leave first. Dean and Charlie waved them goodbye. Dean met Castiel’s eyes for a brief moment, and quickly turned away. Castiel’s hand fell weakly as he turned around and walked. Gabriel and Charlie shared a glance before Gabriel ran after Castiel.
As stated on top, I haven't been writing at all (guilty as charged for reading fics all day and not opening Google Docs). I'm not sure what will happen after I post the next chapter next week, but hopefully I'll find my motivation soon and not drag on another hiatus because I really want to write this fic too ;A;
It was a week before Castiel could return to school. He wasn’t able to meet any friends today, not that he wanted to. Now that his mind was cleared, he worried about how this would affect his relationship with everyone, especially Dean. He blushed at the thought of Dean helping him to the Omega Wing, and how embarrassing he was for using Dean as an outlet for his heat. No one was available during lunch break so Castiel ran out of school to get a bite in a crowded restaurant, since the classrooms were being used and it wasn’t safe for him to be in school. Naomi had made him more food than usual because he had just ended his heat and needed all the nutritions, but the store didn’t allow outside food, so he regrettably had to leave Naomi’s good intentions in his bag. He sat around for a while until it was about time to leave, then quickly ran back to the classroom he needed to go, leaving no opportunity for anyone to stop him. Come the end of the school day, he was expecting Dean to pick him up. He sat in the classroom, waiting to receive a text from the Alpha, but after twenty minutes of waiting, there was no news at all. Perhaps Dean was caught up in class? The tutors and lecturers usually preferred to end on time, or earlier if possible, but there were some extra enthusiastic ones that stuck around to answer students’ questions.
, the heat in his belly like fire. He hasn’t even made the conscious choice to give in before he’s palming himself from over his jeans, a desperate attempt to alleviate the pressure.
He starts with mom, because she’s the hardest to talk to, which makes her the easiest, because she’s hard to talk to in a way that Dean understands, in the way that he is.
[A memory from long ago surfaces, words Dean himself had said: their marriage wasn’t perfect until after she died.] [Maybe it can’t be perfect with both of them alive at all.]
When mom finally speaks, they both continue staring straight ahead instead of looking at each other.
, but it didn’t. It’s fine, we’ll find another way. We always do. It’s not dad’s fault the pearl brought him back instead.”
They don’t get a chance to say anything else before he blusters out of the front door to find the nearest bar. Then, Dean stands in the wreckage left behind and watches as the rest of his family walks away too, holing themselves up alone in their rooms.
Caleb sunk into something past his easygoing demeanor sometime during his speech. He seems almost tired now, reclining in his seat out of need instead of a carefree attitude.
Mom regards him, and Dean thinks it’s the softest she’s ever looked at him since he got back. “I won’t say it’s the easiest thing in the world sometimes. But, yeah, I’m happy, John.”
He has never seen his dad look unsure before— his emotions tend to only reach as far as bursts of anger, or bouts of grief, but never this kind of tentative. It puts Dean on edge, because he doesn’t know the procedure for this. At the same time, it’s a strange kind of interesting in its newness and Dean finds he wants to catalogue it and commit it to memory, the way he has studied so many of his fathers mannerisms and traits.
Cas corners Dean as soon as he gets the chance, hurrying him into a corner as everyone is distracted ironing out the details. “I don’t like this, Dean.”
There’s silence for a moment, and Dean uses it to remind himself of the people next to him. His little brother— the snot nosed kid who's grown so much since Dean picked him up at Stanford all those years ago, who's lost and endured so much but never let it turn him cruel. Soft-hearted but all the stronger for it. His mom, sat on Sam’s other side— a woman he thought he’d lost at the age of four, confident and independent even when thrown into a brand new world. Not the perfect mother he’d grown up grieving but a real one, navigating things the best she can, still caring even if it’s in a way different than he imagined. Jack, sitting on Cas’ other side— his kid, someone who considers him a father despite everything he’s done to fuck that up, born from evil but so, so good. Cas— his best friend, his angel, his...something, who rebelled for him, who fought against the way he’d been taught and everything that tried to come after him since for the chance to do good, for the chance at a family,
Mom’s room is completely impersonal, nothing to say she’s staying here except the already packed duffle in the corner, which is understandable, because it’s not really her room, it’s the guest room she stays in when she sticks around.
There’s a lot in her voice, at that last moment— bitterness, anger at dad, anger at herself, regret...heartbreak.
Once they’re outside with the door closed behind him, Dean sheds the FBI Agent skin he’s been walking around in and lets his shoulders drop and his jaw clench.
Cas keeps drying for a moment, formulating a response, and what exactly is he going to say, because honestly, Dean doesn’t get why he’s acting this way.
It’s familiar, in a way. Dean was never the lore guy, but he knows how this goes, so he leaves dad and Sam to read and goes to clean his gun.
“I don’t know him anymore, if I ever did. And he never knew me...the woman he talks about loving, I have no idea who she is.”
“Hey, kid,” Dean says, before he can overthink it. “We’ll take you fishing anytime you want, okay? I had a great time last time me and you went, and it will be even better this time, what with no one dying and all.”
Dean blinks. “Well, no. It was only the once, actually. I must've been...eleven? I think. We’d just worked a ghoul case, drove past this little fishing spot on the way back to the motel and dad suddenly stopped. Next think I know he’s handing over some of his pool winnings for two rods and a little pack of bait, and teaching me to throw a line.”
Dean isn’t sure how to respond to that. It’s something that came up a few times, during dad and Sam’s worst arguments— how a dad was supposed to
Caleb swings the door wide open, giving them the space to get through. They settle on a cream coloured sofa, Caleb opting to perch on the coffee table instead of taking the chair.
Dean takes the verbal hits. Inside, he lets out a mirthless chuckle that he’d tried so hard but he’d still been seen through. He’d even felt himself changing, forming back into the man dad raised, but hey, he was never good enough even then, was he?
Cas’s lips moved absently to the song that was playing, and Dean’s heart skipped. He knew the song because of Dean. Dean had forced him into a Pirates of the Caribbean marathon, and hadn’t been sure what Cas thought of it. He must’ve liked it if he remembered the song. His face erupted into a grin as he watched Cas and joined in, singing above the music.
“Whatever, man,” Dean said, ignoring curious and alarmed glances from passersby as he pulled out his gun and a knife and handed them to Cas. “Take care of these for me.” The sight of Cas tucking the weapons into his trenchcoat while wearing the Mickey ears again was too much. Dean gripped his shoulder in what he hoped was a casual gesture, chuckling. “Catch you in there.”
“Well, we actually don’t allow anyone to carry weapons, Sir,” Maggie said, her professionalism unswayed by Dean’s batting eyelashes.
Dean’s heart slammed in his chest when he felt Cas’s warm breath on his face. For a second that felt like a thousand, Dean stared into the oceans of Cas’s eyes. His eyes flitted down to Cas’s pink lips, but he brought them back up right away. That was dangerous.
is a little rundown. The sign outside is fading, the vinyl of the booth chairs is torn and the tables are sticky and scuffed— Dean finds it easier to breathe here than he did in the motel room. It’s familiar in a way that’s soft, that reminds him of bickering with Sam over salads and sharing a basket of fries with Cas even though Dean was the one eating 2/3rds of it and Jack’s first chocolate and peanut butter milkshake [that Dean had quickly learned to make at home, tweaking the recipe until Jack had proclaimed it even better than the one at the diner.]
Dean cuts his brother off before he even realises what he’s doing. “Drives us to a diner. Yeah, that’s it. We usually go out for breakfast.”
“This isn’t our first go around the time travel block, Cas.” Dean rolls his eyes, if only to break the eye contact Cas is currently holding him in.
“You can handle things here, huh?” Dad seethes. “Things sure aren’t looking handled to me.” The anger is still simmering under the surface, but Dean can feel the eventual blow-up on the horizon like an incoming punch. Reflexively, he moves closer to Sam.
He pours the contents of the blender into a glass and walks over, placing it in front of Sam with a flourish. Once he sits down, he levels Dean with a calculated expression.
“Oh.” Dad turns a page in the paper. It sounds too loud to Dean’s ears. “It’s just—” an uncomfortable laugh “I thought you said family.”
“I thought...maybe John was just being too hard on himself, with the way he talked about your upbringing. The man I knew...this wasn’t him, or at least not the man I thought he was. The things I read about in there, I didn’t know how to bring them up, and you and Sam never did, so I let myself believe I was right, John was just being too hard on himself.”
They pile into a booth at some diner they’ve been to once or twice, on the way back from a hunt when their stomachs were folding in on themselves and the extra half an hour or so to make it home felt like a suicide mission.
[Maybe because he grew up with dad, knew him, is still untangling the effects he had on him. Mom was almost always gone, and though her presence never really left, it wasn’t the same as losing the man whose presence shaped everything he did. Who freaking knows, he’s never been into that introspective bullshit.]
Mom looks like she’s just rolled out of bed and wishes she could roll back in, Sam’s fingers go tap, tap, tap on the table, dad peruses the menu, and Dean...just watches.
“So, you gonna tell us why your sister is killing her friends' parents?” Dean asks, having to twist his neck to see Caleb in the backseat, but in retrospect it’s probably better than out in the open evening light where anyone could see them.
They all gather around the table again, and Dean starts recounting everything they’ve learned in the past sixteen years. It’s easy to find his words now he’s talking shop— in fact, it’s comforting. This is familiar. It’s safe. It’s something he won’t mess up. Even the speech pattern he hasn’t used with anyone in years— all concise, formal, ‘yes, sir’’s and no wise-cracks— comes back as easy as riding a bike, even though it makes Sam frown and mom crinkle her eyebrows in confusion.
The words wash over him, strong but gentle, something he’d been ignoring how much he needed to hear.
Jack sits in the back, next to mom, unnervingly silent except for when asked a question. The kid is normally a complete chatterbox in the car— Dean had broken him out of the ‘are we there yet?’ habit after a while, but in exchange he now knows exactly what happened on Riverdale last week, how bubblegum is made, and the names and histories of an impressive number of both constellations and dinosaurs.
Dean is keeping tabs on Amy out the corner of his eye. She looks shaken, more so than her brother [Dad wasn’t aiming for Caleb, right? He must have found a clear shot at Amy?]. He’s still standing between her and dad, but Dean definitely has a clear shot right now, could take her down in a second. Under his father’s glare, his fingers itch for his gun.
“What?” Dad questions. “I don’t mean him specifically. But according to you boys, angels are ‘dicks’ and if they’re running around out there, I gotta know how to take them out.”
“Wh-what?” The anger is slowly leaking from dad’s tone, giving way to...Dean doesn’t know what to call it. He’d seen his father like this before, just a few times, mostly in the early days after mom’s death, before he’d learned to channel all the pain and heartbreak into his mission and his fury.
Y’know, not counting the one currently trapped inside Dean’s consciousness. That’s also something he hasn’t explicitly told dad. It seemed a lot to pile on him when he just got here, and there’s not much point when the only shot they had at maybe getting rid of Micheal for good had ended up bringing dad back instead, which is a
“Well, we’re alive and kicking, so that never hurts.” He shrugs. “Things have been...touch and go, at times. We lost you, we lost a lot of people, but we pulled ourselves back up. I’d say we’re probably as happy as guys like us ever can be.”
Well, anyway. Jack is hard to categorise too. Dean doesn’t categorise him as a friend— he doesn’t mean that in a
“Too much salt,” Sammy replies, which – makes no sense, but whatever. Deanna doesn’t want to fight with her, not this morning, not now.
In the motel room, something falls off a shelf. Things are shaking, but not in the cosmic way that they do around Castiel, just in the Sammy way that things have
Gabriel ignores the first question, but Deanna’s too busy hauling Cas up to notice. “That sigil is outdated,” Gabriel finally says. “It only works on angels who are – pure, for lack of a better word.”
Victoria’s eyes don’t change. It’s one of the things Deanna envies. Victoria’s good at keeping her face clean, clear of emotion; she’d been a fed for a reason. She responds, “Try me.”
Ada’s fingers clench white around the wheel. She’s got an odd green ring on her index finger, but Deanna avoids looking at it because for some reason it’s far too bright in her vision. “Cas told me,” Ada finally says shortly.
said this angel to the shepherds and the flock and the Virgin Mary. Deanna shouldn’t be phased by this, not anymore – angels who make the ground bleed, who make the sky quake, angels who are holy and golden, who have track marks in their arms.
“What a monstrous little girl,” Alistairs tells her. “I enjoyed torturing your father, but none more than you. He didn’t break, didn’t leave part of himself behind in the pit – you did. Boys grow up to be men, Deanna, and you girls just grow up to be scared.”
Deanna’s so, so weak. She keeps saying no, but it’s getting harder. She’d give up the world for Sammy or Ada. She just never wanted to have to. What was it, Zachariah had said?
Deanna and Sammy share a look which quickly and efficiently communicates their shared desire to fuck with him as much as possible – Deanna because she doesn’t like men who try to control her, and Sammy because she’s always been pretty feminist in her own vaguely off-putting way. Deanna makes eye contact with Samuel and smiles widely, which pulls at a scar at the corner of her mouth in a way that is, to be fair, kind of gross. Samuel doesn’t flinch, but he’s got a wary look in his eyes that Deanna recognizes and appreciates.
“I wonder if Bobby would know who that was,” Sammy says. She’s still talking kind of quickly, but not as manic as she used to get when she was drinking demon blood. Deanna does and does not want to know what she’s on instead. Hopefully it’s something less harmful, like the fumes of the nail polish she keeps peeling off her nails. “I can’t think of what deity that would be, not with how much we’ve been focusing on Christianity recently.”
Deanna doesn’t know what to say. When John died, she’d never even considered she could get out of hunting. She wonders if she would have even if she’d known it was an option.
“Go find Sam and Ada,” Deanna tells her. “Don’t come back.” She doesn’t know what it means about her that she doesn’t want Cas to watch. Doesn’t want Cas –
When she wakes up, the door’s open. Sammy’s gone and Bobby’s out cold. Deanna curses herself, and curses herself again, and that’s that. Both her sisters, gone after Lilith. Both of them, going to die. She feels bad, leaving Bobby on the couch unconscious, but she knows what her priorities are right now, knows what they’ve always been and always will be.
“Car,” Ruby says, and Deanna gets the keys as Ruby takes Sammy’s weight on her slender frame. She situates Sammy in shotgun and jumps in the back, and then Deanna’s slamming on the gas and pulling away, cackling like she’s losing it. Maybe she is.
“I did not say she was not,” the girlthing says calmly. “Good is not dependent on the mistakes that are made. You are living proof of that.”
The next day, in the Impala, Deanna’s phone rings. She doesn’t look at the caller ID before answering.
Ada swallows. Something is contorting her face into inhuman shapes. “The wings,” she says. “They’re…burned. They’re burned in.”
them – Heaven and Hell aren’t so different here, are they? I feel like I’m uniquely qualified to – ”
. The whole story is positively mad, and you – you’re the best part! Do you think there’s any more ways the angels could have fucked you over? Any more ways they could have
“Deanna Winchester,” somebody else says, and Deanna looks up just as five feet and three inches of angry angel slam her back and into the alleyway.
Things get pretty busy after that, what with the young kid who sold his soul to an angel for a piece of the Staff, what with how Victoria cocks a gun at Cas when she tries to root around through the kid’s brain, what with how Cas’s wings flare out in enormous shadows and how Victoria’s hand quakes but does not lower. What with the way Cas is cold and not at all unsure like she was the last time Deanna truly spoke to her, and the way Deanna can’t look away from her – she holds herself more like a soldier than she ever has. If what she says is true, she started a civil war in Heaven. If what she says is true, she’ll do anything to win it.
Sammy’s shivering, violently. She’s too thin, too cold, the absence of light and warmth, and Deanna had barely noticed. She’d been too caught up in her own head, in the way it had been breaking, that she hadn’t even noticed. She feels like she might puke.
She was, admittedly, a girl-crush of Deanna’s, with all her gleaming muscle and locked-up eyes and long braids. This was, however, slightly dampened by the fact that for the first two years of their acquaintance, she was trying her best to put Deanna and Samantha Winchester, known and infamous serial killers, behind bars. She almost succeeded, too. Probably would have succeeded, if the demons didn’t get to her first. If she didn’t tell Deanna,
Dad...dad’s still out there somewhere, he could be back any minute. He can’t see this, whatever it is, he can’t see Dean’s fucking...he won’t call it a breakdown. But whatever it is, he can’t see it, not on the job. He needs to finish the job— if he doesn’t, things will only get worse. If he does this, he can sort everything else out later, and they can all...they can be happy, they can make this work.
“I know that. I do. But dad, he hasn’t...had the same experiences with hunting that we have. He won’t understand. And, you could get...he could get mad. Especially if—”
“Well, not often we get new faces around here.” The waiter— Caleb, Dean reads from his nametag—  shoots them a smile.
It’s not that he couldn’t still be picking up phone numbers left and right if he tried— age hasn’t been
Dean, of course, notices how his brother talked around the word ‘kill’ there. They’re going to kill his sister, but they need him to talk first.
Dean looks anywhere but at Caleb for the first few long moments they’re left alone. He adjusts his suit, checks his phone, absently runs his hands over the sofa. Caleb, to his credit, doesn’t try to engage him in any way, just cleans up the living room, bussing glasses to the kitchen and straightening out throw pillows.
Dean told him again and again, like a mantra, that dad was just doing his best. Eventually Sam stopped fighting, even found good things to say about the man, but Dean’s still not sure if he ever listened.
“Are we gonna talk about what you really came out here to talk about, or are you just gonna keep mentally interior decorating?”
They make a plan to visit the widow and kids tomorrow, and everyone trickles to their own rooms. Soon enough, it’s just him and Sam.
He remembers how dad and Bobby left things off. The trepidation when they’d first approached Bobby again, thinking he wouldn’t want to see them after whatever mess was made of that relationship. Bobby had welcomed them in, of course, and eventually that history lay firmly in the past, and Bobby was...well, he was Bobby.
time— A box shoved up into his mind’s attic and left to gather dust. Maybe in a hundred years someone would go into the attic, blow the dust off and peer inside out of curiosity, only to find a bunch of junk they could do nothing with but look at and wonder who the hell left this box here and why their life was so messed up.
Dean laughs. “Knew you would. So...now you finally got what you wanted—” Dean pulls a knife out of his pocket and, with the help of the grip he still has on Cas' hair, holds it flush against his throat.
“Jack.” He takes a deep breath. “You know, all these times I’ve gotten mad...it’s not really at you, right?”
“Because I knew it would turn out like this.” He sighs. “I know...I know how you wanted it to go.  I know you wanted us to all...be a family. And I knew it wouldn’t work out, because we are
It’s the type of house they’ve visited a million times— Two story, pale blue paint, gabled roof, literal white picket fence enclosing a manicured lawn. They all start to blend together, only standing out by virtue of being a place they can visit but never stay.
But it’s best not to poke any holes in your cover when you can avoid it, and a sudden third FBI agent does tend to give pause, even if their made up in the moment explanation does tend to be accepted at face value, better not to risk it.
“Yeah.” She huffs a laugh. “Not the best source, I know, especially considering she was brainwashing me at the time. But...she did know a lot, and she called...she said what John did to you was child abuse.”
He thinks about fate, and destiny, and Micheal and Lucifer and his own insistence that fuck fate, they’ll rip up the ending. He thinks about Amara, and a bond he’d never wanted that made him feel sick every time he felt it, and a different bond that exists between himself and someone else, because they chose each other.
“Whatever you can tell us about that day, if not the event itself, will be very helpful,” Sam clarifies.
. “Even if that were true, you just made it about mine. I will and have endured a lot of things, but I will not stand here and let you insult my son.”
“Maria’s parents were hurting her, weren’t they?” Jack asks, in that voice that always painfully reminds Dean just how young and innocent the kid really is.
It’s such a weight off his chest that even the wounded, guilty expression that flashes across John’s face can’t make him feel bad for it.
Sam rips the floral drapes off the wall to save them having to go back to the impala for the ropes while mom ushers the Kane family out of their own home for the night. Dean can hear an argument, Maria demanding she wants to stay, but he doesn’t get involved. Jack is still uncomfortable, and Cas places a comforting hand on his shoulder and tells him he understands why he stopped the bullet, but to remember his soul is at risk if he uses his powers too much. Dean watches all of this to avoid looking at the one person whose face he’s sure is brimming with anger and disappointment right now.
“Just...wait!” Jack says desperately, clearly struggling to keep control. “Please, just...wait a moment.”
By the time Cas and Jack come back, there’s only a few dregs left in Dean’s bottle. He was already thinking about the next one, but he reluctantly admits he should probably listen to what Cas and Jack have to say first.
“We have talked about it,” Dean says, though he knows that’s not what she’s getting at. “We moved around. Lot of time on the road. Dad taught us to hunt once we were old enough, and we worked while we looked for—”
“I’m sure dad knew what he was doing,” Dean defends automatically, but that’s not really a fight he wants to get into right now, so he turns back to Jack. “So, wanna tell me more about what was going on in that head of yours?”
Mom looks like she wants to talk to him. He can see it in the way she holds herself, the way she opens her mouth just to close it again and shake her head. When she finally does speak, all she says is ‘goodnight Dean’ and heads off to bed.
So that’s how they end up outside the deceased Lydia Williamson’s house while Cas and Jack head to the morgue and mom and dad hit the books.
Cas does, rushing to kneel in the footwell in front of the seat. He frees Dean’s cock and takes it in his mouth, looking up for approval. There’s none there, only expectation. It’s fine, he can work harder, he can make Dean...not want him, never want him, but maybe willing to see he can at least be good for
Dean feels a guilty flash of satisfaction that she’s as uncomfortable with this as he is. Talking about emotions, about dad, about the years mom was dead and how that was the reason they grew up with just dad in the first place— they both know those are things often better left in the quiet, so why is she doing this?
Sam, annoyingly, does not respond to this. Can’t he just take mercy on Dean and be the one to start the conversation? This is like, his fourth conversation today, he’s reached his limit. Heck, he’s used up his heartfelt moments quota for the year in the past couple of hours.
Watching his parents on the drive over to the Kane house, Dean wonders if they can pull this off. The two of them are going over their covers, but It’s clipped and uncomfortable and entirely business. Why don’t they look like a couple? They
