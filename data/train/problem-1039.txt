"I’m not listening at all, you know," said Sherlock, amused. He was looking at Victor’s pretty mouth.
"It’s a rather more important point than you seem to realize. Did you think to ask how, exactly, you were to emulate father? Or what qualities of mine you were to eschew?"
"You've got to learn to trust me, John," he said silkily. "Obviously it was possible. It all came down to science."
And then Mr. Mycroft Holmes stepped out bravely into the weird, eerie circle of light that shone down blindingly from the otherwise dark night sky.
It was humanoid in form, Sherlock was relieved to see, although slightly larger than the human baseline. His theory on ideal evolutionary forms for creatures of higher intelligence had, at least, been correct. The files he'd obtained from Molly listed the creature's height (almost 7 feet), weight (an astonishing 57 stone; it must be very dense), measurements, temperature, and respiration rates: resting and stressed. Attempts to x-ray it had proved futile, as had all efforts to extract blood or other fluids. Its skin -- a smooth, flat expanse of garish red that was reportedly both as hard as marble and as flexible as rubber -- seemed impervious to penetration of any kind. Sherlock squinted, trying to ascertain the texture of it. It had no hair apparent anywhere on its body, and seemed to wear no clothing, although slumped beneath a single blanket as it was, it was difficult to be certain. All the expected major appendages were present. The organ of generation was not visible, however, and facial features were -- well. They were off, somehow, in a way that was difficult to pinpoint.  Sherlock's pen hesitated, hovering above the page of his notebook. How to describe the effect of eyes, nose, ears, mouth -- everything was there, and in vaguely the right places, but still everything was -- wrong? The mouth looked somehow ichthyic: gaping slightly with each lipless breath; nose devoid of structure; ears unnervingly mobile -- and those eyes! Black through and through, with no iris, no pupil. Impossible to tell where it was looking, what it was seeing.
But he day was calling; unhappiness must resume with the sunrise. John rose and dressed. When he reached the window Sherlock called, "John," and he turned as if pulled by a string.
“I daresay. But stay with you and how and where? Surely you see that it’s impossible! Where would we live?"
"Early to bed's the rule here, as you know, Mr Holmes," said young Mrs. Trevor. Then she wished the three servants good night and led the way upstairs. Sherlock lingered to choose a book.
They began to see a little of one another. Trevor asked him to lunch, and Sherlock asked him back, but not too soon. A caution alien to his nature was at work. He had always been one to rush in to any new enthusiasm, and this caution on so large a scale was new. He became alert, and all his actions that October term might be described in the language of battle. He would not venture on to difficult ground. He spied out Trevor's weaknesses as well as his strengths. And above all he exercised and cleaned his powers.
Having so conquered, Victor withdrew, more friendly than ever, and insistent Sherlock should return to Penge as soon as circumstances allowed. Sherlock thought he’d better not come again, not ever.
"Thanks so much," he said obsequiously, and grimaced as soon as he was alone. “Care of Trevor.” God help him, he must pull himself together. In the drawing-room he greeted Victor without a tremor. They shook hands warmly, Victor saying, "You look awfully fit. Do you know whom you are going to take in to dinner?" and introducing him to some girl or other. Victor had become quite the squire. All his grievances against society had passed since his marriage. They found they had nothing at all to talk about.
." That struck him as best. They were unlikely to be disturbed at the museum by anyone whom he knew. He smiled, and all unknowingly his face became mischievous and happy. He smiled also at the thought that Victor hadn't quite kept out of the mud after all, and though the face now hardened into lines less pleasing, it proved him an athlete, who had emerged from a year of suffering uninjured. A new vigour consumed him, and he passed the intervening days in intensive work and study.
He spoke with some arrogance, and Sherlock, never one to observe due honour to seniority, said, "You look more like a fresher than a third-year man, I must say."
“John, John, John,” Sherlock repeats his name like a prayer, like his brain has short-circuited and all that’s left is
John doesn’t know why Sherlock signs all of his notes when it’s obvious who sent them (who else would be inviting him over to the Ravenclaw common room?) but he finds it oddly endearing. Filled with giddy energy, John shoots out of bed. He and Sherlock hadn’t made any actual plans for Christmas day, but he’s glad it isn’t going to be an exception and that they’d probably end up spending most of their time together. Besides, he’s excited to give Sherlock his present. He isn’t sure how Sherlock will react to it: he’ll either hate it or love it and John hopes to God it’s the latter. Still in his pyjamas, he grabs his wand and the neatly wrapped present and rushes out of the dormitory, towards where he now knows to be the Ravenclaw common room.
John sniggers and gives him a mischievous smile. “The less I know the better, then,” John grins and Sherlock finds himself smiling back. He thinks of what it might be like to have John at his side the next time he sneaks around the castle after curfew and finds that, oddly, he isn’t at all opposed to the idea. He might even like it.
to do with his hands, he just knows he’d probably get them both arrested for public indecency if he let them do as they’d please.
“Well… you will have the whole castle to yourselves over Christmas break, so that’d be a great time to throw yourself at him.”
“Right, yes, you can have this one.” Sherlock isn’t used to having anyone sit beside him – most students either have seating partners already or are just keen to avoid him – and he moves his things over to make space for John.
“Shut it,” John feels his cheeks heating and Greg laughs, enjoying himself far too much for John’s liking.
His sight slowly begins to adjust, and suddenly John starts to take in his surroundings, the countless shirtless men circling through the bar, some of them wearing nothing but incredibly tight pants that reveal far too much to John’s liking. He looks to the right, past Sherlock and there appears to be a stage, on which half a dozen exceptionally muscled men are dancing and grinding suggestively.
“Hmm,” Sherlock hums, and ends up much closer than John had anticipated when he dragged them both over here, their bodies squeezed in by everyone dancing and swaying on the dance floor. Sherlock is definitely close enough to touch, and the way their thighs brush up against one another every few seconds is driving John positively mad.
“About damn time you admit it out loud, you’ve been pining over him ever since you first had to sit together in Potions,” Greg teased.
John struggles to keep up, apologizes around half a dozen times to the men he has to push past to keep Sherlock in his sights. When he finally makes it past the door, John looks around and finds Sherlock still walking away from the bar, apparently not waiting for him and John feels his temper rise, indignation and confusion getting the better of him. He picks up his pace, jogging until he catches up to Sherlock and reaches out to grab his arm, tugging him back by the material of his coat. “Where the bloody hell are you going?” he demands, breathing hard from chasing after Sherlock and the emotions welling up inside him.
to John. Maybe then things would begin to make sense. He just doesn’t have a clue how to go about that, at least not in a way that wouldn’t result in John most probably never speaking to him again.
“Yes, the trickier ingredients such as salamander blood and powdered Griffin claw might require some… scavenging.”
Well, obviously he’s managed to collect information on John he hadn’t known before, like the fact that he wants to be a Healer (it was a natural choice given John’s care-taking tendencies), he has far too many friends (whoever needs that many people around?), and though he doesn’t mind wizard robes, John seems to prefer soft, knitted sweaters.
Before he can think of anything of interest to say, Professor Snape begins his lecture at the front of the class. “Today you’ll be preparing Draught of Peace. This potion will be part of your O.W.Ls so I expect anyone who strives to earn at least an ‘E’ in this course to pay close attention.”
Attending classes is dull and pointless. Sherlock never learns anything he doesn’t already know, and he’s convinced his professors are well aware of that, too. He’s doing sixth year assignments in most of his classes because he’d be bored out of his mind if he stuck to the normal fifth year curriculum like the rest of his classmates. Not that he isn’t bored. He is. Almost constantly.
“Yes, it’s a fairly interesting establishment,” Sherlock answers and John nearly laughs, but he hides his smile against Sherlock’s neck. He expected the skin to feel rough against his lips, ragged and unfamiliar, but instead he finds himself enthralled by how soft and smooth it is, how his lips tingle from the contact, leaving him wanting more, wanting to let his lips wander and explore the newly found terrain. That would undoubtedly make Sherlock uncomfortable, though, and that is the last thing he wants, so he refrains.
“What’re ye so upset about, ye blimey beast?” Hagrid mutters to the dog rhetorically, opening up the front door for him and John throws himself to the ground behind an overgrown pumpkin to avoid being seen. The squirrel runs off in the opposite direction and Fang takes off after it. He hopes he’s given Sherlock enough time to get through the back door because frankly, John is out of ideas and his heart is racing, beating hard against his chest. He peaks over the top of the pumpkin in time to see Hagrid come through the door and turn to walk around the hut. John takes the opportunity to bolt for the trees where there’s far more cover. He makes it into the forest, plunged mostly in darkness now that the sun has set completely and plasters his back to the trunk of a tree three times his width, panting slightly as the adrenaline courses through him. Catching his breath, John peers over his shoulder to look for Sherlock but doesn’t see him, though he hears Hagrid come back from around the house. His heart starts hammering again at the thought of Sherlock getting caught inside and he’s considering blowing his cover to buy Sherlock more time inside to look for the Griffin claw. He takes a step forward to walk out of the shadows when he’s suddenly shoved back up against a tree.
But now… Well, now that he’s up close, John is starting to understand why he’s been so distracted in Potions this year. It’s not that he hadn’t noticed how good looking he was before. No, Sherlock is pretty impossible
“Mind if I take this seat?” John asks when he’s reached Sherlock’s station, his head tilting to the side towards the empty chair beside Sherlock. This is perfect really; it would give Sherlock the exact opportunity he’d been hoping for. So why are his vocal cords failing him, like every word he’s ever been taught is lodged in his throat? This never happens to him. “It’s just that Snape’s got all the ingredients for today’s potion set up at my usual spot…” John explains when Sherlock remains silent. He looks unsure now, like he thinks maybe he’s misread something and should go somewhere else instead and for some reason that breaks Sherlock out of the sort of trance he’s been in.
“I thought you wanted me to come over,” the man continues, now sounding a bit put off by Sherlock’s blatant dismissal. “The way you looked at me was kind of an obvious inv-”
John feels Sherlock stiffen for a second, but his eyes quickly fall shut and then he’s kissing John back, tentatively at first though John is having none of it. Fueled by the fire burning inside him, John nips at Sherlock’s bottom lip, pulling it into his mouth and sucking, and
“Oh god, oh fuck, Sherlock,” he moans, pleasure gripping him so tight his head spins and it’s a genuine effort not to come on the spot. John’s upper body falls forward, his palms landing next to Sherlock’s head on the mattress and they just breathe each other in, their faces mere inches apart. John dips his head and kisses him, messy and wet and uncoordinated but it’s everything,
. Okay so maybe his cheekbones don’t have anything to do with how put together he looks, but they are entirely too
Tonight is between he and Sherlock. He knows he can’t go back to Mary now, he couldn’t. Not when he’s felt what it’s like to have Sherlock’s body so close to his own, had the taste of Sherlock’s lips on his tongue. No. Now that he knows Sherlock wants him, there’s no going back for him. So, no matter what happens tonight, his future with Mary has already been upended: it’s over.
it, and John might not even believe it himself if it weren’t for the fact that Sherlock is currently curling his tongue around his, hitting a sensitive spot at the roof of his mouth and twisting just the right way. John can barely do anything but hang onto him for dear life and respond with equal amounts of passion.
Sherlock nods, hoping he doesn’t look like he’s already counting down the minutes and hours. He is, of course, but John certainly doesn’t need to know that. “Thursday.”
It was perfectly obvious why John was in the area at that particular time: he’d been on the fastest route to the Quidditch pitch from the Astronomy tower having just finished with Divination (Sherlock had noticed the books John had been carrying at the time, the deduction had been child’s play). It’s also obvious that John had overheard Donovan and Anderson, they had been less than subtle in their glee to have gotten the drop on Sherlock, a feat they’d been attempting to pull for months.
His eyes wander over to the tall man on the far right of the stage, the one with dark brown hair and John can’t help but picture another man wearing the same outfit, how the hat would fit over his dark, styled curls, how the bright overhead lights of the stage would play over his sharp cheekbones.
It’s fine. There’s absolutely nothing wrong or particularly suggestive about holding hands, he thinks, and apparently that’s the kind of flimsy logic that passes as sound when his blood alcohol level is this high. They walk up the street, John leading them both in the direction of the only pub they’ve yet to enter, Sherlock only slightly stumbling behind him but surprisingly keeping up with John’s pace quite easily. John wonders if it’s a side effect of the alcohol, but it seems Sherlock doesn’t mind the hand holding. In fact, he’s holding on to John’s fingers, an active participant, not shying away from the touch or the connection of their bodies in the least.
John steals a hand under Sherlock’s shirt, freeing the material from under his trousers and Sherlock moans loudly against his mouth. John chases the sound, desperate to hear every wanton noise he’ll be able to pull out of Sherlock Holmes, but he realizes, suddenly, that maybe they shouldn’t be doing this in the foyer. They’ll scar Mrs. Hudson.
He wants everything, his mind is spinning with it, with the innumerable amount of possibilities, all the things they could do, and he wants them all with Sherlock. But Sherlock is right, he needs to decide on one, just for tonight. What if they only had tonight? He knows – he’s hoping he didn’t read too much into Sherlock’s ‘next time’ – that they’ll have time for all the other things, but if this was it, if all he got was one night with Sherlock, he thinks he would want-
“He didn’t believe me,” Sherlock turns to John, practically pouting, and John fleetingly thinks about how attractive Sherlock’s lips are, full and soft and – god,
He grins at the note, shoving it in his pocket, grabbing his books and heads out of the common room towards the library without a second thought.
Sherlock’s eyes slide back to John, but John is puzzled now. What did that guy mean about Sherlock looking at him in an inviting way? Did Sherlock actually want to be approached by these men? Was John stepping way over the line by interfering, misreading Sherlock completely when he’d assumed he wasn’t interested?
John considers making Sherlock wait a few minutes more before putting him out of his misery, as Sherlock certainly doesn’t enjoy not knowing anything, but he gives in, too tempted by the idea of telling Sherlock something he can’t figure out himself.
But this, what he’s seeing now as the men on stage touch each other – this is about pleasure. It’s raw desire, attraction, and deliberate seduction. And John quickly finds himself entranced by it, can’t seem to pull his eyes away from the visual display of mutual want. The fact that there are no women involved doesn’t bother him at all.
“Seemed obvious given the classes you’re taking this year, other than Divination of course, but I’ve concluded the most probable explanation for that is that it fit with your Quidditch schedule. You like to help others, like you did me, which indicates strong care-taking and empathetic tendencies. Not to mention you’ve been around the infirmary at least three times in the past week though you exhibit no observable signs of injury nor are there regular patients you seemed to have been visiting: the natural deduction would be that you’re there to speak with Madame Pomfrey. So, a Healer.” His observations, connections, and deductions come tumbling out before he can think to filter himself and Sherlock braces himself for John to turn his back to him and tell him Anderson and Donovan were right to call him a freak. But when Sherlock looks up to assess John’s reaction, he looks… awed.
“That was fantastic.” Something warm pulses in Sherlock’s stomach at John’s praise and though he would usually be tempted to boast, he finds himself shrugging sheepishly.
John has never considered himself inexperienced when it comes to sex. But he’s starting to realize that maybe he’s not so practised when it comes to love.
, John hasn’t even touched him yet, but he feels his own erection dripping, aching so badly to be inside Sherlock he truly fears he might come without contact at this point.
Thank you to every one who left comments and kudos, you have no idea how happy you've made me! Thank you for joining me on this lovely potterlock ride, it was so much fun to write and to share with you. I'd love to know what you thought of this last chapter and the story over all.
It isn’t an official position at the Ministry of Magic, but that doesn’t bother him. He’d invented the job and he was the only wizard for it. Besides, there was absolutely no way he’d ever work for Mycroft at the Ministry. It was simple, really: they’d call Sherlock in when the regular Aurors were out of their depths, for the truly interesting and dangerous cases, and that was fine by him – Sherlock wants nothing to do with anything monotonous or mind-numbing anyway.
They should talk. They really, really should. But John can’t risk this, can’t stand the idea of ruining things and not even getting tonight. They can talk later.
He lets his body sink to the floor before Sherlock, his face coming flush with the very evident erection straining against Sherlock’s trousers and he thinks it should be strange, that it should feel foreign to him, that maybe he should be hesitant given his inexperience in this particular department, but his mouth floods with saliva and anticipation boils in his blood. He wants to taste Sherlock, wants to hear all the filthy sounds he can pull from him mouth, wants to have him weak from desire and out of control.
John always hoped he’d become a Healer, live a simple life and perhaps he’d find some form of happiness along the way. Thinking back to his days at Hogwarts, he’d never have predicted that alongside working as a Healer at St-Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, he’d also be writing a weekly column in
“You should be,” Sherlock confirms. “You occupy my mind incessantly and just when I think I’ve got you figured out, you surprise me. Right up until now, I still had no clue whether you wanted this.” John grins, thinking that might oddly be one of the sweetest things anyone’s ever said about him. He’s always thought of himself as quite ordinary, but if he can keep a mind like Sherlock’s entertained, then maybe he isn’t so boring after all.
“How did you even get the ingredients to make this on your own?” John questions and Sherlock grins at the memory because it was quite exhilarating.
“Your current state of being and eagerness seem to indicate that you, in fact, find me to be more than tolerable,” Sherlock deduces and John feels a zip of arousal spark down his spine at hearing Sherlock’s deep baritone voice making observations about him while his erection presses against Sherlock’s skin. Fuck, he’s going to have a kink for Sherlock talking in bed, isn’t he? He already wants to hear it again, wants Sherlock to whisper all the dirty things he wants to do to him in his ear until he comes.
, the sight of Sherlock like this – desperate, wanting, his head tilted back against the door, cheeks flushed with arousal – is enough to bring John to his knees.
Sherlock does notice the two pints once the bartender sets them on the counter in front of them and he turns to John. “We won’t be able to calculate our hourly alcohol intake in order to stay in the sweet spot, John.” He appears deeply concerned by this and John laughs.
? John clears his throat, averting his eyes, his own cheeks heating, and he brings a hand up to scratch the back of his head unconsciously.
look at Sherlock because he knows that if he so much as glances at him and sees an increment of what he feels on Sherlock’s face, John would positively lose it.
. He sometimes finds himself wishing he could touch his fingers to Sherlock’s cheeks, just to see if his skin feels as soft as it looks, like skilfully sculpted marble.
Looking over at Sherlock shyly, John notices his normally marble white cheeks are also tinged pink and John’s insides flip excitedly.
John feels his blood boiling in his veins, anger gripping his throat as his body vibrates with rage. Sherlock isn’t even his… he knows that, but he still feels the insult deep in his bones, like he wouldn’t deserve Sherlock if they were together, like he wouldn’t be good enough for him. And hell, maybe that’s true. Lord knows how gorgeous the man is. He looks like he could have been sculpted in marble by Michelangelo, his beauty statuesque, all smooth skin and sharp edges. Of course John could never hope to hold a candle to him. There was a time, during his army days, when he was arguably fit, his muscles toned, skin tanned from the blaring afghan sun, no extra weight around the middle. He’s under no impression that he can compare to Sherlock, certainly not now. But he sure as hell would defend what was his if Sherlock had chosen him.
Sherlock notices John is the one blushing now. His insides flutter at the sight. “Right, so when are you free then?” John asks as they make their way out of the dungeon, climbing the stairs side by side.
God, his heart is going a mile a minute, his legs feel like they might not support him when they finally do make it to their destination and his head seems to be spinning a little, which he knows has nothing to do with liquor. No, this is all Sherlock.
. John mentally shakes himself, willing himself to push his own desires to the back of his mind.  Potions. He should focus on that and making this Strengthening Solution correctly. Sherlock was just being nice, being his friend. Besides, it seems Sherlock doesn’t keep many friends around, so the least John can do is keep from royally messing things up by making everything more complicated with his feelings.
, he could quite possibly just rut against Sherlock like this and find his release fairly quickly – he really is that far gone – but he wants more, wants to take his time with Sherlock. He doesn’t want this to be over so fast, just in case Sherlock decides this was a bad idea once the rush of endorphins and the remaining alcohol in their systems wears off.
John collapses on top of Sherlock, his muscles failing to hold him up any longer, spent and languid, he nuzzles his face into Sherlock’s neck. He feels sated, completely blissed out, like the world could end right this second and he doesn’t think he’d care, so high on endorphins not even the apocalypse could make him come down. Sherlock is still holding onto him, legs and fingers twined together and in no hurry to let go.
Even in his wildest fantasies, John doesn’t think he’s ever let himself believe Sherlock would be so… enthusiastic.  He never imagined Sherlock would be so willing, so fervent. But there’s no mistaking his eagerness now and John is not about to complain. If anything, it makes him want Sherlock more, if that’s even possible.
Sherlock looks confused. “I was getting the impression you were enjoying it when I spoke,” Sherlock mumbles behind John’s hand and damn it, he already knows that too. Of course, he bloody knows, he’s Sherlock Holmes, master of all observations.
“It’s all been calculated, John. We’re to go to every pub on every street in which we’ve ever found a corpse,” Sherlock explains.
. Even if he could control it, he doesn’t think he’d make any kind of move to stop it. John’s hand moves up of its own accord, reaching out to drape at Sherlock’s right hip and Sherlock moves in too, long fingers spreading forward and up, until John can feel the ghost of a touch at his cheek. John thinks he sighs, though it’s likely no one hears in the middle of the club dance floor, and his eyes close of their own volition, head tilting into Sherlock’s touch-
“Help with what?” John asks, picking up his books form the table, and Sherlock reads his features as more curious – intrigued even – than repelled. He hasn’t bolted from the class at the first opportunity or raced to meet with Lestrade again once Snape had dismissed them, so he takes that as a positive sign.
“You are the most complex deduction I’ve ever encountered,” Sherlock says, and John breathes out a laugh because that is such a
Apologies for the longer wait, but this last one is a bit longer, so hopefully that makes up for it! Enjoy 😊
“That’s only because you took the edge off,” Sherlock clarifies, and he is so close to whispering in John’s ear, he thinks he might burst on the spot if Sherlock keeps talking. “Of course, I certainly wasn’t coherent at all when you had your mouth around my-”
Something dark and angry coils up in John’s belly and his grip tightens around his wand, heartrate growing faster as he considers which spell to use. He’s got a few hexes he’s been working on, ones he shouldn’t be learning until next year in Defense Against the Dark Arts, ones that might do more than sting a little, but he also doesn’t want to risk detention and getting kicked off the Gryffindor team.
“Me?” Sherlock sounds incredulous. “You’re the one who was touching me all evening. Why do you think I allowed you to get me so drunk?”
“It’s a gay bar, Sherlock,” John puts it plainly and watches Sherlock’s eyes widen in realization. John can’t help the smile and small laugh that makes it past his lips at the sight of Sherlock so obviously shocked. “Come on, let’s get us some drinks then.”
“Hey, what’s been going on with you?” He startles at the sound of Greg’s voice as he catches up with John who’d sprung for the door as soon as Miss Sprout had dismissed them. “You’ve been jumpy these last few days, even distracted during Quidditch.”
“Nope,” Sherlock counters, popping the ‘p’ at the end of the word. “There’s one last pub on this street.”
“John, why are approximately two thirds of the men here half naked?” He inquires, still looking far too puzzled and it takes everything John has not to burst out laughing at how astoundingly clueless Sherlock can be sometimes. God, he really is truly oblivious to the most obvious things. Or perhaps Sherlock just has a blind spot when it comes to anything concerning sex, having very few (if any?) experiences in that particular domain. Sherlock is a very hands-on learner, that much has always been obvious. He always makes full use of his senses when they inspect any crime scene, bending down to be eye level with the corpse, smelling any and all evidence, sometimes going so far as to taste it. And sex is… well there are very little experiences less hands on than sex, are there? And if Sherlock has never… Has he? John has always been curious.
No, the real query, what Sherlock still can’t wrap his mind around is why John Watson would intervene, why he’d taken Sherlock’s side and cursed Donovan, taking Anderson’s wand and freed Sherlock with a counter jinx.
John looks up from where his eyes had been rooted to the floor and he catches Sherlock’s gaze. What he sees there has his heart stuttering within his chest, his breath catching. He doesn’t recognize the feeling, doesn’t know if he should characterize it as something closer to panic or excitement. All he knows is that his heart feels like it could spontaneously combust at any moment, and by now, he’s sobered up enough he doesn’t even think he can blame any of this on the alcohol they drank over the course of the evening.
John realizes with startling clarity and a tad of alarm that he might just have a crush on Sherlock Holmes.
He did not just think that. Nope. He’s clearly losing his mind. John shakes himself, willing his brain to cooperate and stop bombarding him with images of Sherlock, beneath him and pinned to his mattress. This is so not okay. John has had very vivid dreams in the past involving he and his roommate in very compromising positions, but he’d always chalked those down to his own libido and inability to get laid to take the edge off. He spends so much time with Sherlock day in and day out, it seems only natural his brain would subconsciously involve Sherlock in his fantasies. It’s entirely normal and doesn’t have to mean anything. He just didn’t expect his subconscious lust for Sherlock to take over so aggressively the moment his mind was loosened by alcohol with Sherlock at such close proximity.
He can’t help his lips splitting into a wide smile, doesn’t remember a time he was every this happy. Hell, he didn’t know it was even
John’s been to war for Christ’s sake. He knows what it’s like to be beside himself with anxiety, to literally be fearing for his life and thinking that the next few moments may be his last.
“Then why would you signal those guys to come over?” He asks, genuinely at a loss now. He should let this go. Clearly this conversation is making Sherlock more uncomfortable than any encounter with strangers in that club, but he
“Alright, fine,” Greg says from behind him, half shouting as he gets swallowed up by a crowd of students exiting their classes and flooding the corridor, and John grins because he knows he’s won for now. “But don’t think you’re getting off so easily, I’ll get it out of you eventually, Watson.” Yeah, he probably will, but definitely not today. Today he’s meeting Sherlock.
“Ohhh no,” John mumbles, not to anyone in particular and he quickly wraps his arms around Sherlock’s middle as Sherlock is all too ready to fight back when the younger man gets back up from the table, and nope, that is
John looks at him, raising an eyebrow expectantly. “I think you should be on your way now, Anderson.”
John uses the counter-jinx and he winces as Sherlock hits the ground unceremoniously. “You okay?” He asks, holding out his hand to help Sherlock back up. Sherlock looks at John’s offered hand as though it’s something entirely foreign, like he has no idea why it’s there or what he’s intended to do with it. His eyes move up to meet John’s apprehensively despite the fact that John just came to his aid.
John’s fingers stretch down until he reaches Sherlock’s hole, never breaking eye contact with Sherlock as he pushes a single finger gently inside him, his abdomen contracting with heavy want, the remainder of his blood rushing south and sucking all the air from his lungs. John moves the single digit in and out, slowly, patiently, and he watches Sherlock’s every move, drinking in his every reaction. The way his jaw is clenched tight, his head rolling back against the pillow and when John adds a second finger, Sherlock’s hand shoots forward to grip John’s wrist, the arm holding onto Sherlock’s waist. His grip is tight, like he’s on the verge of losing control and
to feel this happy, like his body is filled with air and he could float away at any given moment. It’s Sherlock who keeps him grounded, and though he’s pulled away from John’s mouth, his hands are still gripping the back of John’s shirt, holding on and keeping him close.
“You want to dance?” Sherlock asks, a bit confused because he knows for a fact that John hates dancing.
“Ours,” John clarifies, but the other man doesn’t seem convinced. How is he supposed to get them out of this one?
Oh god, he is so drunk. He’d shaken his head in disbelief when Sherlock had shown up at the pub with two graduated cylinders from the lab, but it seems his nutter of a best friend has, in fact, managed to precisely calculate just how much John needed to drink in order to get positively plastered.
“How could you possibly know you’ll be interested in this client’s case before you’ve even seen or talked to them?” He challenges, just to make sure Sherlock isn’t having him on.
“Ohhh, I know that look,” Greg says, rounding on him with a smug smile on his face, walking backwards in the corridor as he faces John. “Who’s the girl, then?”
John can’t get over the fact that the Ravenclaws need to solve a puzzle every time they want to enter their own room.
“I want to see you,” Sherlock insists, no hesitation in his voice and John nods, lips curving up in a smile as he looks down at Sherlock, curls askew, a light sheen of sweat glistening over his chest. So beautiful. He’ll stay on his back so they can face one another.
“Not particularly,” he answers truthfully, he’s quite certain he’ll get an “O” for Outstanding in most of his classes, no matter how dreadfully boring they are. His answer makes John laugh and something warm spreads through Sherlock’s stomach at the sound. What is
“You should not be this eloquent after what just happened against the door,” John complains because really, how is this fair?
The words hit John just like a spell would, straight in the chest with a dull impact. He barely knows Sherlock, but John knows enough
been pining,” John counters, because that definitely makes him sound like an idiot. God, he really hopes Sherlock hasn’t noticed.
He heads towards the Gryffindor common room to drop off his books and pick up his Potions material when if first occurs to him that he and Sherlock hadn’t even set a time or place to meet up. They haven’t gotten the chance to talk since Tuesday. Could Sherlock have forgotten? It’s entirely possible that something way more interesting than meeting John came up and since they haven’t discussed meeting up again maybe he’d-
John blindly reaches back for the doorknob, twisting and shoving it open, and as soon as they make it past the threshold, John is pushing Sherlock back into the door slamming it shut with the weight of their combined bodies. Sherlock gasps when the inertia drives John’s hips directly into his, and John takes advantage of his open mouth to suck on his lower lip, pulling it between his teeth and
, it’s nearly too much.  John hooks his leg around Sherlock’s hips and flips them easily, Sherlock landing on his back and John pries the lube from his hands.
Sherlock is the one to save face. “Yes, John insisted on honoring this type of marriage tradition, and I agreed to come with him, though I would have preferred to skip this excuse to get drunk. Hence why we’ve grown used to calling it
“I’m ready,” Sherlock says before John can even finish his sentence, his hips meeting John’s thrusting hand. “Do it, John, please.”
“Shut up,” John slaps his hands over Sherlock’s mouth, his dirty, pretty, beautifully enticing mouth because fuck, he can’t hear those words sliding off Sherlock’s tongue right now, he knows for a fact he would come before his pants were even off and that just won’t do.
The cab ride feels endless. They truly should have walked. John’s sure they’d already be back on Baker Street by now if they’d gone on foot, not to mention the walk would probably have done wonders to calm the ever-growing storm of emotions raging inside him. He feels like he’s about to go mad.
He quickly spots Sherlock’s tall, lanky figure a few feet away and his protective instincts – no, his
“You’ve got to stir counter-clockwise as well,” Sherlock tells John just as he was about to put in the next ingredient, missing a crucial step. Why does he want to help John? Helping others is complete unlike him, he doesn’t bother with others, least of all if he thinks they needed his help.
“Oh no, not me. I wouldn’t miss my Mum’s Christmas pudding for anything in the world. But your new Potions partner should be here.”
“You don’t?” Sherlock asks, opening his eyes, looking at John in disbelief and John shakes his head. He should probably feel awful about it all, but he can’t, not when Sherlock is here and he
“Good. Hagrid’s would be the first place I’d look for the Griffin claw, he’s bound to have some lying around his hut, we can worry about powdering it after we’ve acquired it.”
“Not bad, Watson,” Snape admits, which is high praise coming from their annoyingly fastidious professor. “Perhaps you should make a habit of sitting next to Mr. Holmes given these… surprising results.”
were pouring extra shots into the graduated cylinders,” Sherlock accuses with a raised eyebrow, daring John to contradict him. It takes John by surprise, but the feeling only lasts a second because really, he’s never been able to hide much from Sherlock Holmes.
His hands shake as he fumbles to find the right key on the ring and he very nearly drops the whole set of keys to the ground when he feels the warmth of Sherlock’s body against his back, his hands coming up to frame John’s hips, pulling his body closer and Sherlock runs his nose across the exposed column of John’s neck.
“You’re getting married to someone else,” Sherlock breathes out the words like a confession, like it physically pains him to say them out loud and John suddenly feels the sting of tears behind his eyes. God, why do they have such shit timing? This is his stag night and he’s kissing Sherlock Holmes. He can’t – won’t – regret it though, not now that it’s happened and he finally knows that Sherlock wants him this way. The only thing he regrets is being responsible for the pain in Sherlock’s face.
They both walk to the front of the class to collect the ingredients specified in their textbooks, not that Sherlock needs to look, he’s already successfully brewed this potion before more than once. This would be fairly simple.
“I love it. I can see the most basic details of my fingerprint,” he exclaims, looking at his index finger under the lens, sounding excited and the sound makes John smile. When he looks back up at John, he wears a solemn expression. “No one’s ever given me such a thoughtful gift.” John feels his heart beating hard and wishes he could hug Sherlock, pull him in close. Before he can question whether that’s a good idea or not, Sherlock drops the box he’d kept under the tree in John’s lap. “Now yours.”
“Me too.” And then he’s reaching for Sherlock again, lips meeting his in a fiery kiss, and he lets his hands trail down Sherlock’s back until he reaches his arse, pulling him in until their lower bodies are grinding against each other and fuck,
They keep quiet for the rest of the class, John focusing on brewing his potion correctly and Sherlock finds himself watching from the corner of his eye to make sure he makes no other mistakes. Sherlock is pleased that there’s no need for him to interfere again, John is doing well enough on his own.
Sherlock notices John’s shoulders square up, his attention focusing. Ah, so John wishes to do well. So far, his performance in the class has been passable, but nothing extraordinary, making today’s potion important to him.
John hurries down the moving staircases, his Quidditch bag slung over his shoulder and he’s finally down on the grounds, a short jog away from the pitch when he hears shouts coming from around the corner of the castle on his right. He should let it be, whatever’s going on, it’s certainly none of his business.
away – from any thoughts of Sherlock’s cheekbones, or any part of Sherlock’s body, for that matter. That was proving to be a much harder task than he’d originally anticipated given his befuddled state of his mind, the alcohol making his brain feel fuzzy and apparently awfully confused about what he wants.
Mycroft had called her in to consult on this special case--the most exhilarating of her career--on the sole condition that she not involve his brother. And here he was, planted in the middle of her lab and looking unlikely to shift.
Victor scarcely knew what to do. At any rate, Sherlock must go—and quietly. Without another word, he left the darkness within for that without: a sleety rain fell as he went to the station, owls hooted, and mist enveloped him. It was so late that the lamps had been extinguished in the suburban roads, and total night without compromise weighed on him
"Stay?" he snarled. "Of all the bloody rubbish I ever heard. Stay on as a servant for the rest of my life?"
: Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade, have you, in your vast experience and with your highly honed observational skills, ever known Dr. John Watson to fuck men?
"It hasn't yet. I think they came close this time, though." He shuddered again. "The first time, they used simple scalpels. That was worse than useless--the scalpels just broke in their hands. I could barely even feel them. After that, the knives got bigger. They're experimenting with different materials. This time it was a diamond-bladed saw. I could--I could definitely feel it."
Sherlock's gaze moved rapidly between the two bodies, timing respirations. "Please hurry," he said aloud. "The physiological stresses of cross-species habitation are almost too much -- for both life forms. If they are to live, they must be switched back now."
"Watson missed his boat?" cried the squire with indignation. "These people are impossible." Then he stopped, faced by the future. "Sherlock, Sherlock," he said with some tenderness. "Sherlock,
Shocked, Sherlock walked a few steps in silence, then said, "Here, give me some of those things to carry." Stranger and stranger.
Then, one unusually sweltering day in June, Mycroft arrived from London. Sherlock was given no warning of his coming, and so was unable to avoid the audience that Mycroft immediately requested.
Molly snapped her fingers. "I was reading up on the latest from MI-6--they've got a new radar scanner built of dagal, which is good stuff, but it isn't as good as your purple metal, inoson, Sherlock. When you developed that, I was sure you'd sell it for millions! Inoson should theoretically detect any energy patterns out of sync with its surroundings--at least, any material possessing molecular structure."
“Because it is politic to do so, brother. Only that. It will save you a world of trouble in your life. Already, headmaster has spoken to me about you—spare yourself the aggravation of his ongoing concern, and feign a friendship or two. Join in!” He spoke the words with distaste. “Believe me when I tell you: I speak from experience. It is always expedient to appear to be as unremarkable and average as possible. You have the entire freedom of your mind to enjoy at your leisure when you simply allow the surface of your being to conform to the idiotic expectations of others.”
“I’m a stubborn man. Well – a stubborn something, anyway. I’m sorry about the silent treatment. It wasn’t ... it wasn’t good of me. But you have to understand – it’s all I have left. To speak or not, that’s the only power I hold, and I” – he took a shuddering breath – “I was very angry at what you said. My life has been destroyed, and you made it sound exciting.”
Swallowing his astonishment, Mycroft allowed himself a small sigh and his face softened, slightly. He must not permit an attachment to form. "Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock."
"That isn’t quite what I meant," he interrupted, seeing that Sherlock had finished. “You live in college with other boys.”
Sherlock nodded. “And I you. Truly, John, I am sorry. I meant no harm, no offense. I get carried away by scientific novelty, but I should not have forgotten that my study is your reality. It will not happen again.”
he's not going to fire the best xenobiologist in the country. You're far too valuable, especially now. But no matter! I've been tipped off by other sources, so your conscience is perfectly clear. You didn't tell me. You don't know who did. All you need to do is put your files on your desk for a few hours and leave me alone."
Sherlock reached out and took John's left hand in his own. He drew the hand up to his own face, and placed John's hand against his cheek.
"I am going to talk to you for a few moments as if I were father, Sherlock." Then, very plainly, he approached the mystery of sex. He spoke of male and female, evolved in nature in order that the earth might be populated, and of the period when the male and female receive their powers. "You are just becoming a man now, Sherlock; that is why I am telling you about this. It is not a thing that your masters can tell you, and you should not learn it from your fellows. If school boys mention it to you, just shut them up; tell them you know. Have you heard about sex before?"
John pushes all thoughts of Mary and his cancelled engagement to the far side of his mind, grounding himself in the present. Even with all the alcohol they’ve consumed tonight, John can still make out the exquisite smell of Sherlock’s cologne and he has to repress a shiver that threatens to make its way down his spine as his body responds to the familiar odor. It’s a heady mix of cinnamon and green apples, fresh and clean and so god damn enticing, John thinks at this rate he might even have to stop breathing through his nose if he wants to keep from spontaneously combusting from pure, next-to-unbearable want in the back of a taxi.
Anderson scowls, sneering at him but John stares him down defiantly. “What about her?” He looks down at Donovan, lying completely still on the ground, eyes wide open and limbs locked at her sides.
“You’re early,” Sherlock says when he opens the door at John’s knock (no way is he trying to solve a puzzle right now, his brain is running on over drive already) with a raised eyebrow.
He feels a crushing wave of heat wash over him when he finds Sherlock looking directly at him, unashamedly staring. He’s very obviously drinking in the sight of John, his eyes roaming over his body, his mind most probably firing off deductions like it’s on fire, analyzing every one of John’s micro expressions and observing all the ways John’s body is betraying him.
“I’d like to experiment with that, next time,” Sherlock declares, and John’s brain short circuits for a second and a half because – did Sherlock just say
And he realizes it’s a strange comparison to make, but somehow, he doesn’t think even that can compare to the buzzing he feels under his skin and down to his bones in this very instant. He and Sherlock are keeping a respectable distance, sitting on opposite sides of the backseat, no parts of their bodies even close to touching, and yet he thinks he’s never been more aware of a few inches of empty space. He doesn’t know what to do with his hands. Well, that’s entirely false, he knows exactly, and most precisely what he
“I’ll call it off,” he promises, his left hand moving up to cup Sherlock’s cheek. “Just…” There’s really only one thing he wants, one thing he thought he’d never get to ask. “Take me home?”
Sherlock’s head thumps against the wall as John’s lower body grinds into his and John takes advantage of their position to let his lips drift down to Sherlock’s jaw, nipping and biting his way down until he reaches the smooth column of Sherlock’s neck. He kisses the soft, freshly shaven skin, sucking and grazing his teeth just above the juncture of his collarbone a tad harder than is probably appropriate but he can’t bring himself to care. Sherlock doesn’t want ‘anyone’, but apparently, he wants John, and the thought of that is slightly intoxicating, clouding his brain: it makes him want to mark Sherlock as his.
The room seems to disappear between them, only John and Sherlock remain as the chaos of the club fades to nothingness. The music dies out in his ears, the heavy lights stop being so blinding as he focuses exclusively on Sherlock, holding his gaze, and John can feel the blood rushing in his veins, his pulse rapid and loud, thudding against his skin and he lets himself get lost in the vast ocean of Sherlock’s eyes. They gravitate towards one another, both like moths drawn to a flame, bodies tethered together by a magnetic pull. John almost feels like he has no choice in the matter, like this moment is beyond his control, like it’s bigger than him: it’s
“Thanks again,” John says, turning back to him once Snape is out of earshot. “For the tip about stirring counter-clockwise. I owe you one.”
“Hey,” John’s voice is softer now, he reaches up to cup Sherlock’s cheek in his hand, turning his head gently so he’ll meet his eyes again. “It doesn’t matter,” John assures him, and he finds that it’s true. He doesn’t care about Sherlock’s past, whether he’s had masses of lovers or none at all. “Nothing matters except this, right now.”
Only then do Sherlock’s eyes move from John to acknowledge the man intruding, looking at him directly. “Clearly, I’ve reconsidered. The answer is no.”
“Oh please, modesty is overrated. You’ve scored more points than any other player on every house team this year. Gryffindor wouldn’t stand a chance at the finals if it weren’t for you.” How does he even know that?
“It’s John’s stag night,” Sherlock answers quickly and John doesn’t even realize there’s something wrong with the answer until-
Only recently there’s one thing that’s managed to pique his interest consistently, one thing he doesn’t really understand, that keeps him up at night, a mystery he hasn’t been able to solve yet.
“I think we should head home,” John suggests once he can catch his breath again, intent on avoiding any more close calls involving strangers’ fists.
Oh God, Sherlock doesn’t beg for anything, not for a anyone, but he’s begging now, begging for him and John makes a sound close to a whimper in relief. He pulls his fingers out of Sherlock, takes himself in hand, slicking himself with more lube and positions himself at Sherlock’s entrance, now open and ready. They lock eyes again and when Sherlock nods, John angles his hips forward, entering him in a swift, yet gentle move.
"Damnation, isn't there anything interesting?" he muttered after fifteen minutes of fruitless search through insipid shelves.
The creature's movements, expressed by John Watson's body, looked obscene. Where a human might have shook his head or shrugged his shoulders, the creature cocked its head at a strange angle and peered up at him, a strange combination of human and alien.
Sherlock felt drunk with upheaval and joy. He watched the steamer move, and suddenly she reminded him of a Viking's funeral boat that he had read about as a boy. The parallel was false, yet she was heroic, she was carrying away death. She warped out from the quay, swung into the channel to the sound of cheers, and she was off at last, a sacrifice, a splendour, leaving smoke that thinned into the crisp air, and ripples that died against the wooded shores. For a long time he gazed after her, then turned to England. His journey was nearly over. He was bound for his new home. He had become his own man, truly, and now it was for John to bring out the hero in him. He knew what the call was, and what his answer must be. They must live as outsiders, without close relations; they must work and stick to each other till death. But England belonged to them. That, besides companionship, was their reward. Her air and sky were theirs, not the timorous millions' who own stuffy little boxes, but never their own souls. In his excitement he felt that John was close to him. He wasn't, couldn't be, he was elsewhere in the splendour and had to be found.
Meanwhile, in the innermost private office in the inner sanctum of the laboratory – often simply called "the Club" for its exclusivity and air of luxurious opulence – Mr. Mycroft Holmes and his security chief Gregory Lestrade stared at each other across a massive oak desk. Holmes's voice was cold, his mouth pressed into a thin line.
Sherlock felt himself to be a child again, defenceless and vulnerable. Never before had Mycroft spoken to him in this manner.
But John grew suddenly fierce. "It rained harder than this in the boathouse. It was colder, too. Why did you not come?"
Sherlock took a week's holiday in August and reached Penge according to invitation three days before the Park v. Village cricket match. He arrived in an odd and angry mood. He had been thinking over his past with Victor, and reliving each of his dearest memories with the bitter knowledge of their present relations, thinking to eradicate such memories entirely from his mind. It was more difficult than he expected, and that fact made him cross.
"Yes, assuming that. Thank you, Anderson. As usual, you've lowered the I.Q. of the entire room." Sherlock turned his back on the hapless technician and continued. "I have not been idle, these past hours. I’ve been deep in my mind palace, evaluating seven possible lines of inquiry that may be fruitful. As time is unfortunately pressing, we must choose our course of action well. Now, externally, the alien in Watson’s body will look like any other human on Earth--and he could be anywhere! We'd never stand a chance of locating him--even just within the city of London. And he could be anywhere on the planet by now! But that energy signature should be unique, and it should be incredibly concentrated and powerful.
know. Things I've deduced to be true. And then I will share some theories that I expect to be proved true in the fullness of time."
Sherlock groaned and buried his face in his hands. “I know. I know! I shouldn’t have done it, but I was—I was so very unhappy, Mycroft. I couldn’t bear it. And then, there he was. He was so kind, you see, and so willing.” Mycroft was astonished to see that his eyes were wet.
To Sherlock’s horror, tears stood in his friend’s eyes. He reached out, but Trevor was gone, gone without another word, flying across the court, the bang of his door heard through the sounds of spring.
Sherlock opened his hand. Luminous petals appeared in it. "You care for me a little bit, I do think," he admitted, "but I can't hang all my life on a little bit. You don't. You hang yours on Anne. You don't worry whether your relation with her is platonic or not, you only know it's big enough to hang a life on. I can't hang mine on to the five minutes you spare me from time to time. You'll do anything for me except see me. That's been it for this whole year of Hell. You'll make me free of the house, and take endless bother to marry me off, because that puts me off your hands. You do care a little for me, I know"— for Victor had protested—"but nothing to speak of, and you don't love me. I was yours once till death if you'd cared to keep me, but I'm someone else's now—and he's mine."
"Don't you want to look? Here. The mirror is right here." Sherlock held it up, but the creature didn't turn. Nor, for a long moment, did it speak.
"Brother, no!" Sherlock muttered under his breath. "You know that we cannot do this. We must above all ensure John's safety! And then, there must be reparations. We must seek justice for the wrongs done against Dr. Watson."
: What can there possibly be to think about? A simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ should be easy enough, even for a demonstrable cretin such as yourself.
"Sherlock! Sherlock! You've actually come.” Victor’s arms were around him once more. “You're here! This place'll never seem the same again, I shall love it at last."
The man seemed interested. "Well, I don’t know. I’ve always taken fancies to both. Haven’t you, really?”
The crash came on a Sunday in spring—exquisite weather. Mycroft had appeared unexpectedly at Montague Street and ordered in a large breakfast—one of his periodical attempts to entice his brother’s reluctant appetite. Sherlock sat in resentful silence, drinking strong coffee and smoking in his dressing gown. He would not touch the excellent kidneys, nor the fruit in syrup, nor even the exquisite French pastries that Mycroft had troubled himself to procure from Bardet’s.
"You’re getting idiotic, " Sherlock rejoined with deceptive calm. "You caused this: you brought harm onto yourself and onto an innocent Earth life. You
"I've read your articles," Molly said, cocking her head. "Your theoretical framing is sound, but your methodologies leave something to be desired."
Molly began to count backwards from ten. “Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one—”
Sherlock began before the first course had even arrived. "Since we last met, Mycroft, I went wrong with a—. Christ! With the gamekeeper at Penge. He’s not— he’s not the usual sort. The way he talks is… He’s…” Sherlock broke off, pale cheeks flushed, furious with his own incoherence. “I should never have gone up. I don’t know what to do!"
Sherlock Holmes plucked a printout from Dr. Molly Hooper's hand. "Ohhhh," he breathed as he quickly scanned the page. "This makes no sense at all." His pale eyes gleamed. "How absolutely brilliant," he murmured. The paper fell from his hand and he stared off into space, lost in thought.
The next twelve hours dragged with terrible slowness. Sleep was impossible and eating was difficult, even for Molly and Lestrade, though all knew that they would have need of the full measure of their strength. Sherlock Holmes took tea with a little sugar, but otherwise only paced furiously and without cease. He would not visit John, his mind shying away from the image of what he might find.
Sherlock said nothing. His jaw tightened, and Mycroft, despite himself, clenched his fist in anger. “London’s more your place, at any rate. Our parents—" He paused and lit a cigar to give his hands something to do. "Our parents don’t understand. For my own part I think these things right themselves, with time. You’ll come down to London and live with me. We’ll find something to keep you occupied. I’ll be entirely more comfortable having you about where I can see you every day. Mother and father are in complete agreement."
"I… I do." I fact, Sherlock hadn’t known. Based upon all available evidence, he’d rather thought Victor had thrown him over.
"Artifacts belonging to the nation." They paused in the corridor of Roman emperors. "Yes, it's bad weather. There've only been two fine days. And one fine night," he added mischievously, surprising himself.
Sherlock turned to look at him with sudden interest. “No? And yet, you know enough of the book to recommend it, and enough of me—at least, so you imagine—to think that it would suit my taste.” Watson was an importation—part of the larger life that had come into Penge with politics and Anne Woods. He was smarter than old Mr Ayres, the head keeper, and knew it: one of the new class of servants who didn’t care to ‘know his place.’
"Excellent!" he exulted, copying coordinates down into his notebook. "He's within half a mile of us, three-quarters on--perfect! I feared he'd be so far away that I'd have to take additional readings to locate him. He hasn't a single ray on us, either, from what I can tell. The game is afoot!"
Sherlock hesitated, mind warring with body, and then applied his lips to the starched cuff of a dress shirt.
"Nothing"; and Sherlock knew that he had lost touch. Last term he would have understood this silent entrance.
Then he followed Archie to the Russet Room, thinking "Victor might have ... for the sake of the past he might have been here to greet me. He ought to have known how wretched I should feel." He might not love Victor anymore, he thought, but he could still suffer from him. The rain poured out of a leaden sky on to the park, the woods were silent. As twilight fell, he entered a new circle of torment.
, as one might say "Ganymede," for such intimacy with a social inferior was unthinkable to him. As it was, he felt depressed, and offended, for he had assumed Sherlock was dedicated to striving for normalcy. "You don’t ‘owe’ me this, man! Stop it. You must not dally with morbid thoughts if you wish to improve yourself as I have. I'm so disappointed to hear you talk of yourself like that. You gave me to understand that the land through the looking-glass was behind you at last, when we thrashed out the subject that night in the Russet Room."
"No." This was technically true: Sherlock had heard nothing whatever from his fellows about sex, not being on close speaking terms with any of them—but he was unusually observant and had seen and inferred more than an averagely intelligent boy his age would have in the natural course of things.
The tips of the ladder quivered against the dawn as he descended, then were motionless. There was a tiny crackle from the gravel, a tiny clink from the fence that divided garden and park: then all was as if nothing had been, and silence absolute filled the Russet Room, broken after a time by the sounds of a new day.
Watson shrugged. “Just a notion I had. I saw you pick up the Swift, and, well. It’s a natural connection, isn’t it? I meant no offence, sir.” His words were both polite and deferential, but his keen eyes were not. He looked at Sherlock frankly, steadily, and Sherlock’s face heated under his gaze. With a tiny smirk, Watson turned and went out.
Sherlock flipped his switch. The stars flashed in the black void for an instant, then were again shut out.
It was absolutely quiet now, and absolutely dark. Sherlock walked to and fro on the hallowed grass, himself noiseless, mind in disarray. He walked all night, only going up to his rooms to escape the dawn. Unbeknownst to him, his heart had lit for the first time, and one thing in him at last was real.
"Damnation, what a night," Watson said. His breath puffed on Sherlock’s cheek, delicate and perfumed with the scent of fruit; it had further to be feared that the young man had stolen an apricot. Scents were everywhere that night, despite the cold, and Sherlock inhaled deeply.
"I don't know. I can't explain anything. Why did you saddle me with that Plato? I was all in a muddle. A lot of things hadn't joined up in me that since have."
He got down to the boat in a dream, and awoke there to a new sort of discomfort: John was nowhere in sight, the stewards were busy and insolent. "Watson’s not aboard yet, but his kit is," one said. "Interested to see it? It’ll cost."
“We'll take five visiplates and cover the sphere,” Sherlock directed. “Two for me, one each for Molly, George, and Anderson. If any of you get a reading, it will be him. Be sure to mark the exact spot and outline on the glass."
"To speak to me the way you did,” John continued, “to say the things you said to me, and all the time you were such
"That's because you're going about it all wr--. You're not considering the full range of methods open to you.
was unlikely to intervene in any matter short of the boy’s actual death, he had written to Mycroft in a fit of exasperated despair that was familiar to intimates of the Holmes family. The headmaster had had many such talks with Mycroft himself early on in their acquaintance, and never quite considered the matter to have been dealt with satisfactorily. "Thin ice," he had said many times, and Mycroft had eventually taken the warning to heart. While never changing his habits substantively, he became at least adept at pretense. He was unsurprised to discover that his brother displayed similar qualities, and wrote at once to invite him out for tea.
"Please don't reopen this. It's over. It's over." He went into the other room, still speaking from behind the half-closed door. "Forgive this discourtesy, but I simply can't—my nerves are all nohow after three weeks of this."
Meanwhile, in a cell far beneath Diogenes Laboratories, the alien body containing John Watson’s consciousness lay unmoving and unresponsive on a sterile gurney.
They left the enormous and overheated building, they passed the library, supposed catholic, seeking darkness and rain.
"Yes—come in. Here I keep: ground floor." Trevor turned on the light. The fire was nearly out. He told Sherlock to sit down and brought up a table with glasses.
: Your deductive prowess, while substantially inferior to my own, is better developed than most, and you have known John in a friendly capacity for several years. You are the logical person to ask.
"I don’t agree. Not anymore." Yes, that was the reason of his visit. It was the closing of a book that would never be read again, and better close such a book than leave it lying about to get dirtied. The volume of their past must be restored to its shelf, and here, here was the place, amid darkness and perishing flowers. He owed it to John also. He could suffer no mixing of the old in the new. All compromise was perilous, because furtive, and, having finished his confession, he must disappear from the world that had brought him up. "I must tell you too what he did," he went on, trying to keep down his joy. "He's sacrificed his career for my sake … without a guarantee I'll give up anything for him. I don't know whether that's ‘platonic’ of him or not, but it's what he did."
“Human,” a booming voice said. It was in his ears, but also inside his head. Still, he could feel no directional indications that would allow him to pinpoint its origin.
A small, timid woman hurried over, her expression apprehensive. "Oh, Sherlock!" she said breathlessly. "I wasn't expecting you in tonight."
Victor went crimson. "Sit up straight and let's change the subject," he said, all the folly out of him.
Groups of people stood about with the air of arranging something, and though Victor's mother no longer presided she had come up for the week and rather ran the show. She had expected Victor to be back by now, she said, and it was the more disappointing because tomorrow Victor would have to be really away. The agent, who knew the constituency, was showing him round. Mr Holmes must be forgiving, and he must help them in the cricket match.
Molly winced. "He hasn't told me outright. But the preparations are pretty clear, don't you think? I have my suspicions. You must, as well."
What was he doing? He felt himself to be dissolving, mind and flesh tearing themselves to pieces with feverish and fruitless energy. He pulled out his dressing case and removed the little bottle of laudanum that the had brought with him. He took a large draught, and lay back on the bed once more. The tension in his body slowly lessened and his breathing quieted. His desperation, too, began to abate. As the trance continued to work, Sherlock had the illusion that the large portrait that hung over the desk had changed, now at his will, now against it, from female to male, and come leaping down from the wall and knelt over him. ... He moaned, half asleep. There was something better in life than this rubbish, if only he could get to it—love—nobility—big spaces where men clasped peace, spaces no loneliness could reach, but they existed for ever, full of woods some of them, and arched with majestic sky and a friend. He really was asleep when he sprang up and flung wide the curtains with a cry of "Come!" The action awoke him; what had he done that for? A mist covered the grass of the park, and the tree trunks rose out of it like the channel marks in the estuary near his old school. It was very cold. He shivered and clenched his fists. The moon had risen. Below him was the drawing-room, and the men who were repaving the tiles on the roof of the bay had left their ladder resting against his window sill. What had they done that for? He shook the ladder and glanced into the woods, but the wish to go into them vanished as soon as he thought it. What use was it? He was too old for fun in the damp. But as he returned to his bed a little noise sounded, a noise so intimate that it might have arisen inside his own body. He seemed to crackle and burn and saw the ladder's top quivering against the moonlit air. The head and the shoulders of a man rose up, paused, a gun was leant against the window sill very carefully, and someone he scarcely knew moved towards him and knelt beside him and whispered, "Were you calling for me? Were you? I knew it. ... I knew when I first saw you, I knew," and then Watson was touching him, kissing him—urgently.
"I know my own mind," said Victor, getting warm and freeing himself from the chair. "I was never like you."
“Sherlock?” Molly asked timidly, picking up the cold, untouched tea she’d left in front of him several hours ago.
John suddenly scrubbed at his eyes with the sun-roughened back of a hand and said, "Don't talk to me about Penge! You've no idea what it’s been like. Treated like dirt by the man I thought you loved. I went flaming mad when you didn't turn up at the boathouse. I’ve never been so— It’s never been like this, for me."
“My father won’t even notice; that’s why it had to be this weekend. Do you see? There’s so much on, such a bustle, another guest won’t rouse the slightest suspicion. Go on unpacking. I arranged it on purpose. We're up this staircase by ourselves. It's as like college as I could manage."
"Oh, I don't know. Tea's more important than hall. It stands to reason—well what are you giggling at?—that if we follow a dyke long enough we must come to a pub."
"Come to the glass," he said, watching closely. He opened the compact and held it up for the creature to see. "I've got a mirror. See for yourself."
Still smoking his pipe, Mycroft got up, and choosing a smooth piece of earth nearby drew diagrams upon it with the tip of his umbrella. "Scientific diagrams will make this easier," he said to the boy, who watched in fascination: it bore no relation to his experiences. He was attentive, as was natural when he was the only one in the class, and he knew that the subject was serious and related to his own body. But he could not himself relate it; it fell to pieces as soon as Mycroft put it together, like an impossible sum. In vain he tried. His intelligence would not connect to his inner self. Manhood was stealing on him, as it always must, in a trance. Useless to break in upon that trance. Useless to describe it, however mechanically or sympathetically. The boy assents and is dragged back into sleep, not to be enticed there before his hour. Mycroft, whatever his science, was sympathetic. Indeed he was too sympathetic; he attributed a cultivated understanding to Sherlock, and did not realize that one might grasp every fact on an intellectual level, and still understand nothing whatever.
"Sherlock--please," she stammered. Even after years of acquaintanceship, he had a way of unnerving her. "I don't know how you've found out, but the project is full-alpha classified. I could lose my job; he made that very clear. Lose my job if I'm lucky! Gaol time, more like, blabbing about state secrets. He'd lock me up in a heartbeat, and throw away the key! I couldn't--"
"I guarantee you that the instrumentation is sound; you'll recall I adjusted it myself not two weeks ago when we received the Land's End meteorite shard. Ergo, the results are not impossible – merely improbable. Oh, Molly, it's Christmas!"
"The one with no fireplace," called Victor. "Show him up." He was seeing off some callers, and had barely glanced at Sherlock since they’d arrived. Sherlock’s heart sank.
But all that night his body yearned for John’s, despite his efforts. He called it lustful, a word easily uttered, and opposed to it his work, his responsibilities, his position in society—his own best interests! But his body would not be convinced. Chance had mated it too perfectly, and it ached in his absence. Neither argument nor threat could silence it, so in the morning, feeling exhausted and ashamed, he telephoned to Mycroft and asked him to employ the considerable resources of his office to look into Watson’s past.
Even in his nausea Victor turned to a generalization—it was part of the mental vagueness induced by his marriage. "But surely—we agreed! The sole excuse for any relationship between men is that it remain purely platonic."
Undersecretary Tretaske of the Secondary Council of the Galactic Consortium for Justice proclaims the Proven and Verified Guilt of Traveller Tryoquatt Erklits, of espionage, treason, murder, and subsequent crimes against a lesser species. Undersecretary Tretaske further orders him detained on penal planet 719 for a period of not less than 3.74 I-galactic temporal periods. During his period of detention, he shall be deprived of any and all contact with his nestlings, inclusive of psychic joinings, and shall subsist on planetary rations of 7 nutritional capsules per cycle. Rehabilitative programming to be provided as deemed appropriate. As decreed, so shall it be.
“I can’t believe we’ve never been here before, it’s quite something,” John says, loud enough for the blonde to hear and he’s aware the other man is watching him with narrowed eyes, like he’s just stolen his prize.
“Suit yourselves,” he shrugs, nonchalantly but then his eyes turn back to Sherlock and John finds his grip on Sherlock’s waist tightening. “Well, if ever the marriage thing doesn’t work out, I’d be happy to show you the virtues of… a more exciting lifestyle.” He winks at Sherlock, apparently not buying into their cover story or simply not giving two shits about hitting on an engaged man with his fiancé right there to hear.
“You could have used a more damaging curse,” Sherlock says, breaking the silence between them. He lets go of John’s hand and dusts off his robes, his face slowly returning to its natural color. John finds he misses the warmth of Sherlock’s fingers instantly in his, but he consciously pushes the thought to the back of his mind.
John is panting, still catching his breath when Sherlock tugs at his hair and he forces himself up from the floor, only noticing for the first time the twinge of discomfort in his knees, but he doesn’t mind it so much: not if it’s the cost of seeing Sherlock like this, so open and sated and somehow still hungry for him.
“Well, I don’t know about that,” John counters, but Sherlock cuts him off before he can say anything more.
John knows he shouldn’t, knows there was a reason he was staring out the window and keeping his eyes, far, far away from the one thing on his mind, but he can’t help it, he turns and sneaks a look at Sherlock.
Sherlock turns to meet his gaze, a bit puzzled. “I’d say we’re even,” he counters. If anything, Sherlock thinks he might still be in John’s debt, his helping John for one potion surely couldn’t compare to what John did to help him when Anderson and Donovan had jinxed him.
Stupid. He’d been an idiot not to realize they’d followed him from his Transfiguration class into the courtyard and frankly, he thought he might have been stuck there for hours had John not showed up when he did.
Sherlock finally stops walking, his eyes defiant when he turns back to look at John. “Home, I thought that was fairly obvious.” John knows he’s using that patronising tone with him to avoid talking about whatever happened inside and tries his best not to let it get to him.
. Sherlock is still just as crude and obnoxious, and John still laughs at his inappropriate comments.
, he’s becoming acutely aware of how his body is reacting to the sensory overload of Sherlock’s touch and smell as the beginning of an erection starts to grow in his pants. Thank god the bar stools are high enough for Sherlock not to notice his bodily reaction.
. A small giggle makes it past John’s lips and he’s not quite sure if it’s because of how put off Sherlock looks about some stranger in a bar not taking seriously his knowledge of tobacco ash, or the absolutely incredulous way his own mind is playing him tonight.
Snape makes a comment about John and Lestrade finding new seats for the day and John looks around the class then, his gaze landing on Sherlock and their eyes lock. Something in Sherlock’s chest feels odd, a pang of some sort, entirely foreign to him and it only seems to grow when John makes his way towards him.
“You didn’t have to,” John says instinctively and all but kicks himself when the words are out of his mouth. Sherlock doesn’t seem offended, though.
John had at least managed to pick up all the correct ingredients and materials from the front, which was unfortunately not the case for a few of their classmates (though he kept this to himself), he’s glad to see John isn’t a complete idiot.
Sherlock’s front pocket and, miraculously, he succeeds. Never breaking eye contact with Sherlock, his fingers wrap around a something long and smooth with a sharp edge, and he pulls it up between the two of them. The Griffin claw.
Sherlock is still looking around, his brow furrowed as he struggles to make sense of the events unfolding around him and it’s one of the most endearing things John has ever seen. It makes him want to brush his hand to the soft dark curls falling over Sherlock’s forehead in a soothing way. Not good. No, that would definitely not be good and would certainly give everyone here the wrong idea about the nature of their relationship.
Sherlock enters the dungeon and takes his usual seat at the back of the class, a perfect vantage point to observe the rest of the class, though he’s solely interested in John at the moment. Students start to pour in, and Sherlock notices the exact moment John walks into the room, chatting with Lestrade (Sherlock can’t be bothered to remember his first name), another Gryffindor and, as Sherlock had deduced over the last few weeks, one of John’s closest friends. They head towards their usual seat at the front of the dungeon, which Sherlock quickly notices is occupied by most of the ingredients the class would be using today.
Hi y'all, sorry for the wait on the update, this week was a bit crazy, but here is chapter two. One more to go after this one! I'd love to know what you think.
Sherlock’s hips thrust sharply against his in what John guesses was probably a reflex when he soothes his tongue over the small mark he just made at his neck and John moans this time, his pants now becoming uncomfortably tight as he grows impossibly harder. From what he can tell, Sherlock isn’t faring much better.
“No one even likes you,” Anderson spits, as they both look up at a helpless Sherlock Holmes. “Been here five years and you haven’t even managed to make a single friend.”
, and it seems Sherlock has absolutely no objections. He chases John’s mouth, eager and wanting and,
They take the quickest route down to Hagrid’s, walking down the path as the sun sets behind the castle and John feels his heart begin to pump faster as the curfew time approaches, knowing full well they won’t be back in their respective dormitories by then. Then again, maybe his elevated heartrate has more to do with the fact that his hand brushes the back of Sherlock’s a few times as they follow the narrow path side by side and Sherlock doesn’t seem to mind or pull his hand back.
“You’re probably the only fifth year who doesn’t need to be worried,” John admits, looking at Sherlock quickly and giving him a small smile. Had John just acknowledged that the rest of the students in their year were idiots? Surely not.
John turns his head to make sure Sherlock hasn’t noticed, and something twists in his stomach when he sees an attractive blonde man, standing a tad too close to Sherlock to be considered innocent and smiling brightly at the consulting detective, apparently chatting him up.
Sherlock is silent beside him, but he feels him lean back, allowing his weight to fall on John’s chest and his left hand comes up to cover John’s on his waist, a clear non-verbal sign of consent. John’s hand squeezes, hoping the gesture is reassuring somehow.
“I couldn’t,” John tells him without a hint of hesitation. “Not when I know what this feels like. I never thought you wanted this, Sherlock. Me, us,” he clarifies. “If I had… I never would have waited this long.”
Reassured that he must be doing something right, John ventures on, opening his mouth wider and taking in more of Sherlock’s length. He sucks and licks and one of his hands moves from Sherlock’s hips to hold the base of his shaft. He bobs his head up and down his length, establishing a rhythm and he hears Sherlock’s head thump against the door loudly as he curses, and John has never heard anything hotter.
On Christmas morning, John wakes up to the sound of repetitive tapping. He forces his eyes to open and looks around the room for the source of the sound until his eyes land on the window by his bed and he sees what looks like a note knocking on the glass over and over, spellbound and trying to get in. John grins despite having been woken up. This isn’t the first time Sherlock has sent him a message this way. He reaches over to open the window and the paper flies in, hitting him square in the chest. John breaks the wax seal and opens it, instantly recognizing Sherlock’s distinctively scribbly penmanship.
A hand covers his mouth and muffles his shout of surprise, and a tall, lean body pins John to the tree.
“You go first,” John insists. He’d expected Sherlock to be tentative, maybe even reluctant to receive a gift for some reason, but he surprises John once again, tearing at the giftwrap with childlike eagerness. It makes John grin and wonder if Sherlock got many gifts as a child. He’s a bit nervous, unsure as to how Sherlock will react to what he got him. He knows Sherlock comes from a pureblood family, it’s never been something John gave much thought to, but he suddenly wonders whether Sherlock would appreciate the nature of his gift.
“No,” Sherlock answer, and only then does John remember the guy who inconveniently tried to cut in. “Leave.” Sherlock hasn’t taken his eyes off John, but he and the stranger both know the words aren’t directed at John.
John drags Sherlock over to the bar, still holding onto his hand. No one would think anything of two blokes holding hands here, right? No big deal then. Sherlock follows, but it’s only when they make it to the counter that John realizes they left their graduated cylinders at the last pub in their rush to leave and avoid a fight. He orders two pints of beer from the bartender who gives Sherlock a once-over too obvious for John’s liking, and his gut tightens in an unpleasant way.
As for Sherlock, after this explosion he turned to his career with renewed—indeed with single-minded and almost frenzied zeal. At first he was proud of his self-control: did not he hold Victor's precious reputation in the hollow of his hand? Was he not magnanimous in the extreme? But he grew more bitter, he wished that he had shouted while he had the strength and smashed down this front of lies. What if he too were involved? His family, his position in society—they had been nothing to him for years. He was an outlaw in disguise. Perhaps among those men who left their families and cities and took to the greenwood in old time there had been two men like himself—two. At times he entertained the dream. Two men can defy the world. Yes: the heart of his agony was loneliness. He took time to realize this, being slow to understand his own emotions. The incandescent jealousy, the mortification, the rage at his past obtuseness—these might pass, and having done much harm they did pass. Memories of Victor might pass. But the loneliness remained. He would wake gasping, retching. Victor took to visiting him in dreams. He knew there was no one, but Victor, smiling in his sweet way, said "I'm genuine this time," to torture him. Once he had a dream about the dream of the face and the voice, a dream about it, no nearer. Also old dreams of the other sort, that tried to disintegrate him. Days followed nights. He drugged when his agony grew unbearable. He drugged often—too often—and although this lessened his immediate pain, he sickened with it.
John looked very soft. "Go back to sleep, Sherlock," he said kindly, and kissed him again, natural as breathing. Then he took up the gun that had guarded them through the night.
John grasped the mirror and drew it to his face. "I am. My God! I truly am! Sherlock, I didn't believe it was possible!" He dropped the mirror and pulled Sherlock into a fervent embrace. Sherlock almost overbalanced, but caught himself with his knee and hugged back for all he was worth.
: Listen, you don’t have to text me back, but I want to apologize for – well, for everything.  I’ve been a right dick and I don’t blame you for being angry with me.
"Thanks, I—. Perhaps I could. You had better write nearer the time." Sherlock cursed himself for a fool.
But daily life remained a poor business. Sherlock had returned to his family’s estate, a quiet, lonely manor in Somerset that felt less like a home than an exile. His parents barely spoke to him except to express their extreme disappointment in his disgraceful behaviour, about which they seemed unsurprised. Mycroft was by now firmly ensconced in London, and rarely left his Whitehall chambers. He’d not been to Somerset in several years. Sherlock’s days passed in a haze of misery, with books and moody walks his only activities.
"All this is rather a bother," he said. “In my experience sexual impulses are something to be mastered—a distraction to be understood, and then put aside. But understanding is the first, necessary step.”
Molly was entirely focused on her display panel, from which she was to monitor both instrument readings and Sherlock's verbal instructions for adjustments during the length of the search--however long it might take. Sherlock, meanwhile, was making final checks on his controls, ensuring perfect calibration.
"Sherlock, you are a man of science, as am I. What would you have me do? Let him out to roam the streets of London? Imagine the panic! This creature is entirely outside of the realm of what is known to us. We simply have no idea what it is or where it came from. Think of the scientific gains to be made! Think of what we can learn from careful study."
Sherlock managed to reply, "You mustn't call me sir," and the laugh sounded again, as if brushing aside all worries. There seemed to be charm and insight, yet Sherlock’s discomfort increased. Watson would soon leave him alone again soon, he knew. Above all, he must not allow himself to begin to care.
It was all so plain now. He had lied to himself. He phrased it "been fed upon lies," but lies are the natural food of boyhood, and he had eaten greedily. His first resolve was to be more careful in the future. He would live truthfully, not because it mattered to anyone now, but for his own sake. He would not deceive himself. He would not—and this was the test—pretend to be anything other than what he was. He loved men and always had loved them. He longed to embrace them and mingle his being with theirs.
Staggered, Sherlock realized that John was singing with light: music without sound, image without substance.
This last was the outstanding point, surely, yet Sherlock brooded over the letter as a whole. There was evidently some unsavoury gossip around about himself and Victor, but what did it matter now? What did it matter if they had been spied on or gossiped about in the past? He was concerned with the present. Why should Watson have mentioned such gossip? What was he up to? Why had he flung out these words, some kind, some angry, some ominous? When he laid down the letter and took up his pipe, it seemed the sort of letter he might have written himself. Muddle-headed? Well, yes. If so, it was in his own line! He didn't want such a letter, he didn't know what it signified—half a dozen things possibly—but he couldn't well be cold over it. Disregarding, almost, the entire content of the letter, he simply yearned to see John again.
After Watson disappeared out the window, Sherlock unlocked the door and dashed back into bed just barely ahead of the approaching valet.
Meanwhile Sherlock scribbled a wire. "Detective Lestrade, Scotland Yard, London," he wrote. "Away for research. Wire if needed. Holmes. Care of Trevor, Penge, Wiltshire."
Victor batted at him, but Sherlock grabbed and held his hand, and looked at him seriously. "Tell me now. Why did you make us both so unhappy?"
"This takes my eye, I must say," Molly exclaimed as she seated herself and swung a large, concave disk in front of her, experimenting with levers and dials. "When you look through this plate, it's better than looking out of a periscope--it subtends more than the angle of vision, so that you can't see anything but out-of-doors--I thought for a second I was going to fall out. What do you call it?"
: It’s just, I’m sat nice and comfy on the same stool at the same bar in the same pub, and wondering if you’d care for a pint.
The pair glared at each other across Mycroft's heavy desk, neither willing to be the first to break eye contact.
"Indeed," said Sherlock, also impressed by the bull. "I couldn't tell you. Here seems to be another one."
John leaned forward suddenly, banging his head sharply against the glass partition. Sherlock jumped.
"These private roads are perhaps a mistake," he was saying. "But as long as the human figure is painted they will be taken. Landscape is the only safe subject—or perhaps something geometric, rhythmical, inhuman absolutely. I wonder whether that is what the Mohammedans were up to and old Moses—I've just thought of this. If you introduce the human figure you at once arouse either disgust or desire. Very faintly sometimes, but it's there. 'Thou shalt not make for thyself any graven image—' because one couldn't possibly make it for all other people too. Sherlock, shall we rewrite history? 'The Aesthetic Philosophy of the Decalogue.' I've always thought it remarkable of God not to have damned you or me in it. I used to put it down to him for righteousness, though now I suspect he was merely ill-informed. Still I might make out a case. Shall I choose it for a Fellowship Dissertation?"
Sherlock understood then that it was no good. "I see,” he said, standing. He was shaking with anger. In truth, he quite liked the idea of living in London—but to be shuttled around by his family like a child! To live under his brother’s watchful eye! He shuddered.
Lestrade shook his head sharply. "You stand just as much chance of killing it with these 'examinations' as learning anyth--"
It was exhaustive. He spared neither his lover nor himself. When all was detailed and laid out before his brother, the perfection of the night appeared as a transient grossness, and Sherlock felt rather ill.
"I see. You've been holding out on me," Sherlock continued. "I wonder why? What on earth could be so confidential that you couldn't even talk to
"Sherlock, then. I saw you when you first drove up, Sherlock, wasn't it Tuesday? I remember wondering why you looked at me like that, angry and gentle both together."
John swallowed. Sherlock observed that his eyes were on his mouth, and then he stopped observing anything at all, because John Watson was kissing him. And Sherlock was kissing back.
"No, Mycroft, wait. You really cannot continue with this. John is a man--whatever he might look like. He's not an animal, he's not an experiment, and you cannot keep him locked up."
The other instruments were no less noteworthy. Sherlock had adopted the Perkins telephone system, but had improved it until it was scarcely recognizable and had made it capable of almost unlimited range. He had devised full automatic directional controls, and meters and recorders for detection, distance, and angle.
! My -- my body is a nightmare. I'm tortured, daily. I'm trapped in a bloody glass prison, Sherlock, and I've turned into a monster! How
Anderson groaned and returned to his bench, peppering his retreat with the rudest of gestures, but Sherlock and Molly were too engrossed in their work to even notice.
They ought not to have spent that night together in the hotel. It had now raised hopes that were too high. They should have parted with that handshake in the rain. A morbid fascination kept him among the porters and the dock hands, listening to their vulgarity. As he brooded a quiet voice said, "Good morning, Sherlock.”
"Had I best be going now, sir?" Unaccountably shy, Sherlock buried his face in Watson’s neck and did not answer.
"Any requests?" he asked, tucking the instrument into his chin and flexing his hand. It had been too long since he'd last played.
"Yes, anything. Anything. There. Listen, I—I mistook your ordinary friendliness, Vic. When you were so good to me, above all the night I came up to Magdalen—I thought it was something else. I am more sorry than I can ever say. I had no right to move out of my books and my laboratory, which was what I did when I met you. You won't want my apology any more than anything else I could give, but I do make it most sincerely. It is a lasting grief to have insulted you." His voice was feeble but clear, and his face like a sword.
Sherlock was surprised by all of this. He had somehow expected to find the man unintelligent. Certainly, Trevor had a forthright and inflexible manner. But he also considered counter-arguments, thought long upon them, shook out the falsities and approved the rest. He listened carefully when Sherlock occasionally offered an opinion, and even asked for elaboration upon several small points. What hope for Sherlock, so desperately solitary, so unused to interest? His heart pounded in his chest. A stab of unnameable, unbearable emotion went through him. Jumping up, he said good night, only to regret his haste as soon as he was outside the door. He settled to wait, not on the staircase itself, for this struck him as absurd, but somewhere between its foot and Trevor's own room. Going out into the court, he located the latter, even knocking at the door, though he knew the owner was absent, and looking in he studied furniture and pictures in the firelight. Then he took his stand on a sort of bridge in the courtyard.
Sherlock saw the main flight to the right, and wondered whether he was being slighted. His room was small, furnished cheaply. It had no outlook. As he knelt down to unpack, a feeling of bewilderment came over him, and he determined to depart as early as he could without causing offense. But he had scarcely reached this conclusion when Victor rushed in with the sunlight behind him. "Sherlock, I shall kiss you," he said, and did so.
“Come to see young Watson off, have you?” Mycroft asked. Water stretched, glistening around them, edged by the New Forest. To Sherlock the beauty of the morning seemed ominous of disaster.
"So's mine. A curious idea." Standing each by his monster, they looked at each other, and smiled. Each felt it an unutterable relief to be once again in the other’s presence.
? This is a matter of life and death! What kind of moronic, irresponsible, hare-brained foolery is this?"
"I need to get some air,” the creature gasped. “I haven't been outdoors in--I've no idea how long, actually. I can't tell if it's night or day, or how many days have passed. I can't breathe in here."
"Here they are," Mycroft said. His usual hauteur was visibly absent. "How shall we facilitate this process? What can we... how can we help?"
Mycroft’s eyes widened in surprise. “Of course I shall marry! Heavens! Think of my ambitions! I have no wish to end my career locked up in a Reading cell. We are having two different conversations at the same time, and you are becoming confused.”
But then suddenly the bells were ringing. Mycroft gasped his arm warmly, then turned and strode away. Sherlock faced the ship, and he could see with extraordinary distinctness the masses of men sorting themselves, and he knew that John was not among them. The afternoon had broken into glory. White clouds sailed over the golden waters and woods. How negligible everything had become, beside the beautiful weather and fresh air.
Victor shook his head, and smiling said, “This has been perfect, this whole night. We must not ask for more than our share of happiness.” They parted, having established perfection in their lives, at all events for a time.
, Sherlock thought to himself, with an unfamiliar pang of emotion that he identified as concern, but which more truly approached alarm.
Sherlock, riveted, carried on. He felt that he wanted -- something. He wanted something desperately, felt filled to the brim with objectless desire. He didn't know what to do about it. He wanted -- first of all, he wanted to hear more. Those sounds! A field of crickets, but -- more velvet. The beating wings of a flock of birds, but -- more focused. Insistent. A rumble like distant thunder, but gentle, promising needed rain.
Sherlock did not reply, but first put the note with the letters he had received during the vac and afterwards burnt them all. He supposed the climax of agony had come. But he was fresh to real suffering as to reality of any kind. They had yet to meet. On the second afternoon they found themselves working in the same laboratory and the pain grew excruciating. He could scarcely stand or see, let alone concentrate on his work. Then they were made to be bench-mates; once they jostled, Trevor winced, but managed to laugh in the old fashion. Moreover, it proved convenient that he should come back to college in Sherlock’s sidecar. He got in without demur. Sherlock, who had not slept or eaten for days, went light-headed, turned the machine into a by-lane, and travelled top speed. There was a wagon in front, full of women. He drove straight at them, but when they screamed stuck on his brakes, and just avoided disaster. Trevor made no comment. As he indicated in his note, he only spoke when others were present. All other intercourse was to end. That evening Sherlock went to bed, exhausted. But as he laid his head on the pillows a flood of tears oozed from it. He was horrified. Weeping!
The lights were blindingly bright in the lab, but it took Sherlock a moment to visually locate the creature, crouched in a defensive posture in the back corner of his room.
After a few moments, the creature stood and shuffled forwards. Its movements were slower than they had been previously, Sherlock noted, its posture more hunched.
"Is anyone injured?" Mycroft asked. His normally commanding voice sounded puny -- almost comically so -- in the wake of the powerful alien barrage.
Thank you so much for reading along with me this summer! This is likely to be my last entry in the Summer Serials collection, and it's been such a fun and valuable experience for me. Massive thanks to redscudery for organizing and administering and encouraging us all. xoxoxox
"The problem is, it's not purposeless, is it? There's a wealth of data at our fingertips. I've tried to talk him out of it," she sighed. "So has Lestrade. He won't hear it."
"I can't see a way to get you out of here," Sherlock admitted, tugging his hair in frustration. "I'm sorry. I don't think it's possible. Even if I could open your cell, we'd still have a dozen hallways on two very populated floors to make it through, and you're not exactly inconspicuous in your current form."
"Oh. Is that all. He told me so himself last week." Their father was an esteemed Old Boy of the College, and the brothers were well used to living in his shadow.
Sherlock had thought that the alien body was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen, but he knew now that he'd been wrong. He ran his hand over John's worried brow, over his softly stubbled cheek. "Open your eyes, John," he said.
Sherlock rocked back on his heels, beaming. "Obviously, you are upset and disoriented, John, but think of it! You're also the first human being in all of history to have had this experience! You're a pioneer. And oh -- the body! It's beautiful, John. It's
Sherlock nearly jumped out of his skin. He had known the specimen -- the creature, he supposed -- could speak, of course. He'd read the reports in Molly’s files. But somehow knowing that fact and actually hearing it speak – speak
No punishment was inflicted on Trevor. He had been let off all lectures in view of his examination, and even if he had been remiss the Dean would not have worried him; the best scholar of his year, he had won special treatment. A good thing he would no longer be distracted by Holmes. Mr Cornwallis always suspected such friendships. It was not natural that men of different characters and tastes should be intimate, and although undergraduates, unlike schoolboys, are generally adults, the dons exercised a certain amount of watchfulness. They felt it right to spoil a love affair when they could.
"What are you -- what are you feeling? John! Please concentrate. I need to understand what's happening. What are you feeling?"
The creature shuddered. "They're trying to make incisions in my--my midsection. I don't know why. Well, I can imagine, I suppose." He unfolded, and Sherlock saw that a series of discoloured lines now ran up and down the creature's torso and abdomen.
"Lestrade," Holmes sighed, and suddenly he looked almost sad. "I have no wish to do it harm. But there may come a time when we can't afford not to. You must prepare yourself."
"Excuse me, but I know no such thing. I've not done anything to you at all, except to introduce myself. I have never seen you before this moment. Anything that has hurt or harmed you previously has been the express purview of the cretins that my lazy pig of a brother keeps on his staff--and I'll thank you not to lump me into the same category as them."
Victor was in his study reading when Archie announced, "Mr Holmes is in the garden, sir." The hour was extremely late, and the night dark; all traces of a magnificent sunset had disappeared from the sky. Victor could see nothing from the porch though he heard abundant noises; his friend, who had refused to come in, was kicking up the gravel, and throwing pebbles against the shrubs and walls.
: I’m in no sort of shape to be starting anything, honestly. Did you not notice? I’m a fucking mess, Tom.
John started beside him, then bent nearly double in sudden laughter. "Don't you worry—I'd never harm you, you've too much pluck."
Trevor shook his head as one who refuses to listen. “You imagine I don’t know—” He was trembling, and looked so ill that Sherlock had a wild desire to catch hold of him.
The strange voice continued: "We apologize for the actions of the Traveller Tryoquatt Erklits, who is a criminal and should never have come to your planet. He does not represent us. He has harmed you, and he will be tried and punished for his actions."
During the meal they looked at each other. They sat at different tables, but Sherlock had contrived to move his seat so that he could glance at his friend. Trevor looked severe this evening and was not speaking to his neighbours. Sherlock was alarmed. What had he done? Had Trevor guessed what he was? Had he misjudged? He sighed. At the very least, he supposed, Trevor wasn't bored with him now.
in a class by yourself,” Molly sighed. “I couldn’t even copy them in less than a month, and I never could have invented them."
. Hold everything. Keep on holding it until I get back, no matter how long that may be." In an icy tone, he added, "Stop asking questions and just – do the job you were hired to do. I don't pay you for your opinion."
John did, and the first thing his eyes met were Sherlock's own, looking warmly down into his. Quickly, Sherlock reached into his pocket and drew out a compact mirror. He held it up to John.
“We will not waste our time, human. If you do not return this creature to us within one of your Earth hours, we shall be forced to take him.”
Since Sherlock did not speak, indeed could not, he added, "And now we shan't be parted. Never again. All that is finished."
Sherlock nodded uncertainly. Something about Mycroft’s advice stirred a pang of sorrow in him. Must he dissemble, then, to ever have a friend?
"It is my great honour to welcome you to our planet on behalf of the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, and indeed of the citizens of the world. We are delighted" – there was barely a hitch in his voice – "that you have found it possible to travel such a vast distance to introduce yourselves to us. On this truly historic occasion, we are concerned only with establishing friendly relations between us, and building cordial communication for future encounters. We trust that tonight's exchange will be beneficial to both of our constituencies."
He went in and found his lover asleep. John lay upon piled up cushions, just visible in the last dying of the day. When he woke, rumpled and warm, he did not seem at all surprised, and fondled Sherlock's arm between his hands before he spoke.
"All right." He looked up fiercely into Mycroft’s pale eyes, and suddenly for the first time, the boy despised him. "Liar," he thought. "Coward.” Then darkness rolled up again, the darkness that is primeval but not eternal, and yields to its own painful dawn.
"That's right," he said. "You need never be puzzled or bothered now, nor distracted from your studies." Of love and life he said nothing, except “when you are grown and married, you shall thank me for this information.”
, for their bodies to parse. Pain, their brains seemed to decide after a split second of hesitation: the sensation could only be interpreted as pain.
Mycroft turned his back and continued, "We wish to proceed in the spirit of friendship. My people are most interested in learning from you, for you are far advanced in many technologies that we have only just begun to develop. We can offer you much knowledge in return! We have--"
John’s apparent pleasure heightened Sherlock’s own. His breath caught in his throat, each note he played pulling new reactions out of John, and cascading back onto him, sounds running like fingers over his body.
John sighs, angry with himself. “I was an arse.” He knows he’s played a part in all of this: there’s a reason Sherlock never said anything about his feelings for John. “I think I’d convinced myself you didn’t want me so thoroughly, I had to try to convince myself I didn’t want any of it in the first place. I was wrong, Sherlock.” He knows he’s messed up, that he’ll have to put in the work for Sherlock to believe him when he’s spent the last few years telling people the contrary. “Do you remember that first night? At Angelo’s?”
care what John thinks of him, and he would rather John not hate him like everyone else. He’d considered putting on an act – he found he was quite good at pretending to be someone else entirely – but somehow that seemed wrong, too. Again, Sherlock doesn’t know
Sherlock doesn’t seem to notice though, and John is grateful that he’s as oblivious as ever to anyone coming onto him. He isn’t jealous, he assures himself. He just… wants Sherlock to himself on his stag night. They are out celebrating together, and he doesn’t want strangers intruding, it has nothing to do with jealousy.
But Victor only kissed him again and again, until they broke off, breathless, leaning against each other and smiling.
"Soda," said Sherlock. It was impossible to stop, for the man was clearly tired and had only invited him out of civility. He drank quickly and returned to his own room, where he provided himself with plenty of tobacco and went into the court again.
"It's better," Sherlock said warmly, though noting that Victor had ignored his first question entirely.
"Oh, for God's sake, Sherlock, hold your tongue. If I love anyone, it's Ada." Then seeing what he’d said, he added weakly, "I take her at random as an example."
She'd been working on the project around the clock for over a week -- since it had all begun, really--and she was no further ahead than she'd been at the beginning. She was exhausted and intensely frustrated. She had little use for the fraternal idiocy of the Holmes brothers at the best of times, and in this case, it seemed needlessly obstructive to thwart Sherlock any further. He was right. If Mycroft protested, she could legitimately claim innocence. She certainly hadn't called him in, at any rate. She wondered, for a moment, who had.
"You wanted to get it and you're going to," said Trevor, sporting the door. Sherlock went cold and then crimson. But Trevor's voice, when he next heard it, was ranting previously unsuspected opinions. "You can't expect me to bottle myself up indefinitely. I must let out sometimes."
Sherlock rolled his eyes, then grabbed for the 'phone that sat on her desk. He entered a complicated series of codes, and the speaker mounted near the ceiling of the lab crackled to life, as did all the speakers in the facility simultaneously.
Mycroft glanced at him in surprise, but forbore to say more. Unimaginable that Sherlock still harboured feelings for young Trevor. It had been a full year, after all, since they had even seen each other! But Sherlock sat as if turned to stone, staring out the window and allowing his cigarette to burn down to his fingers, forgotten. He scarcely noticed when Mycroft took his leave.
She shook her head. "You'll never get in. It's in Mycroft's private lab. He won't even let me near it unless he's there to personally supervise."
"My fear—and your trouble has been fear too. I’ve feared the consequences of what I—what I feel for you. And you’ve feared that I feel strongly for Victor, instead of for you.” Sherlock laughed mirthlessly. “Why did you go and say you love me?"
She ran for it, and released he flew back up to the Russet Room. It brought home to him the precise facts of the situation, and he was violently sick. He felt better at once, but realized that he must leave Penge. He changed into the serge, packed, and was soon downstairs again with a neat little story.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "What we need is a way to track the energy signature thrown off by the alien presence inside Watson's body."
"I’d give the edge to the picture, I must say," said Sherlock, having glanced at the Michelangelo. "Victor, you're very foolish. But since you've brought it up I think you're beautiful, the only beautiful person I've ever seen. I love your voice and everything to do with you, down to your clothes or the room you are sitting in. I… I adore you."
Victor did not reply. He was looking with growing dismay into the face he had once loved. He felt only horror, and he wondered what would happen if Sherlock tried to embrace him.
"With regard to Mr Trevor," said Sherlock, feeling inclined to speak on this point: "it's quite correct that I cared for him and he for me once, but he changed, and now he doesn't care any more for me nor I for him. It's the end."
"Work? No, no. Of course it won't work. You've neglected to consider the Castalor principle. However--" He raced to the large cabinet on the far side of the room and yanked it open, pulling out a dusty box.
"I almost socked him one. Early on. I don't think he realized I could move much. He was talking to me like I was stupid, the arrogant tosser, and I was--I was half out of my mind. I lunged for him, fists out. Missed, though. I can't always judge things right, with my eyes like this. They haven't let me near him since."
Sherlock wanted the same, what's pleasanter, but the oncoming future distracted him, the gathering light made cosiness unreal. Something had to be said and settled. O, for the night that was ending, for the sleep and the wakefulness, the toughness and tenderness mixed, the sweet temper, the safety in darkness. Would such a night ever return?
But having spoken, he began to contemplate suicide. There was nothing to deter him. He had no initial fear of death, and no sense of a world beyond it, nor did he mind disgracing his family. He knew that loneliness was poisoning him, so that he grew viler as well as more unhappy. Under these circumstances might he not cease? He began to compare ways and means, and would have shot himself but for an unexpected event. This event was the illness and death of his grandfather, which induced a new state of mind. Meanwhile, he had received letters from Victor, polite and distant, they always contained the sentence, "We had better not meet just yet." He grasped the situation now—his friend would do anything for him except be with him; and on these lines he was offered friendship on Victor’s own terms. Sherlock did not cease to love, but his heart had been broken; he never had wild thoughts of winning Victor back. He seemed incapable of feeling hope of any kind. He answered these letters, oddly sincere. He still wrote what was true, and confided that he was unbearably lonely and unhappy, but he wrote without emotion. It was more a tribute to their heroic past, and accepted by Trevor as such. His replies were unemotional also, and it was plain that, however much affection he professed, he no longer cared to penetrate into Sherlock's mind.
"Once you demonstrate any kind of competence in the running of your life, you can expect to have a say—not before. You can’t imagine I came up for a pleasant chat, surely? I’m far to busy a man for that. I’m here to fetch you back with me."
Sherlock pressed his own hand to the glass, then rose swiftly and left the lab without so much as a backwards glance.
"Of course I believe you, John. I was merely attempting a memory visualization technique. An experiment, if you will. Please calm yourself."
Sherlock ignored her evident irritation. "Silicon has many chemical properties similar to those of carbon," he mused. "It could -- theoretically, mind you -- create molecules that are sufficiently large to carry biological information." He'd proposed theories like this before to scientific colleagues, and had been met with nothing but ridicule. It was the reason he preferred to work alone.
Sherlock smiled and accepted some tea. The new Mrs. Trevor was acceptably pretty and conventionally charming. Dull, Sherlock thought. Dull, dull, dull. She could not begin to approach Victor’s radiance. The drawing-room had its old air; Sherlock felt his usual discomposure.
Molly bit her lip. She had no desire to break her promise of secrecy to Mycroft Holmes who, despite his exquisite manners, was quite the most terrifying man she'd met. On the other hand, Sherlock was a brilliant scientist--the most astonishing mind she'd encountered. And the truth was, she was stuck.
Sherlock straightened up suddenly. "Listen," he said. "I can't get you out, but perhaps I can make things slightly more pleasant for you." He sprinted from the room, ignoring John's protests.
The creature's shoulders rose in a strangely human gesture. Familiar, but made strange on the alien body.
Sherlock cleared his throat. “No,” he said honestly. “I’ll not speak to him again. I only wanted—only wanted to…” Again, he was struck dumb. How to explain? His actions made no sense, even to himself. “But why are
– sounded more tired than angry, Sherlock thought. "You all say you won't hurt me. You all promise to help me. You all –. Well. You know what you do to me."
John laughed and said, "Alright, damn the church. I’d rather stay here with you, that’s certain, but I've the cricket pitch to help roll for the match." He did not move, though, but nestled back into Sherlock’s arms. In the faint gray light he seemed to be smiling.
"That's a good word. I've never seen such a perfect mechanism. The set of lenses and prisms is absolutely exquisite."
Lest discipline should suffer, the outings invariably took place just before the end of term, when leniency does no harm. Mycroft usually arranged to take Sherlock out to a tea place, behaving in as hospitable and fatherly a manner as his years could manage. Mycroft, though barely an adult himself, was old-fashioned sort. He cared neither for emotions nor the games of youth, but only for the intellectual development of his rather exceptional brother. The rest he left to Sherlock himself, and did not speculate as to whether or not a boy could reasonably be left to see to his own emotional and moral development. Indeed, it was at public school that Sherlock received upon undefended flesh the first blows of social indifference and cruelty. Still, there is much to be said for apathy in education, and if Mycroft’s pedagogy left something to be desired, perhaps he did not do badly in the long run.
"Sherlock, Sherlock, I care a little bit for you, you know, or I wouldn't stand what you have told me."
"Oh! That was only Mill and her cousin having a bit of a lark. Then I believe you had great trouble to suit yourself over a book? Didn't read it, did you?" He shoved him playfully on the shoulder.
Victor sprang up with a whimper of disgust. He wanted to smite the monster, and flee, but he was civilized, and wanted it feebly. After all, they were Oxford men ... pillars of society both; he must not show violence. And he did not; he remained quiet and helpful to the very end. But his thin, sour disapproval, his dogmatism, the stupidity of his heart, revolted Sherlock, who could only have respected hatred.
"Dear Lord, what technology is this?" Sherlock murmured, but Mycroft shot him a warning look and he subsided.
He felt bewildered. What could he say? What should he say? To speak risked terrible consequences. But silence was equally untenable. Deeper sighs broke from him. They rattled in his throat, the sound of unspeakable words. His head fell back, and he forgot the pressure of Trevor against his knee, forgot that Trevor was watching his turbid agony. He stared at the ceiling with wrinkled mouth and eyes, understanding nothing except that man has been created to feel pain and loneliness without help from heaven.
It takes Sherlock off guard. First John called him brilliant, and now talented. Why was he being so… nice? Sherlock doesn’t quite know what to do with that. No one is ever nice to him, really.
Sherlock takes his hand off his mouth once he’s certain John won’t be making any noise to give them away and moves it to lay on the bark, beside John’s head. They’re incredibly close, Sherlock practically boxing him in against the tree as they wait for Hagrid and Fang to get back into the house before they can sneak back up to the castle. John feels his heart pounding against his sternum, but the stress of getting caught has mostly worn off by now and he thinks his elevated heartrate has more to do with Sherlock’s proximity, the way John can feel the long lines of Sherlock’s body against his, how every puff of Sherlock’s breath hits John’s cheek and how it’s the first time their close enough that John notices how good Sherlock smells.
