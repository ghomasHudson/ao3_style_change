Once they emerged from the bedroom they went to the bathroom to brush their teeth. The bathroom had a feminine touch but could still be called Dean's. He had hot rod magazines on the floor and men's body washes in the shower. But the blue toilet seat cover and matching shower curtains gave slight hints that this was Mary’s house, odly, Dean noticed, they were the same blue of Cas’ eyes.
He knew Castiel would have questions but that wasn't the problem at the moment. He knew almost everyone knew he was an omega, but he couldn't think clearly when it felt like every move he made was being monitored. Soaping himself down was the next step, especially in between his legs and his tight hole that hadn't been stretched in a few days. That thought alone made him sick, his own paranoia was effecting his and Cas' sex life. It had to change and soon before Castiel got the wrong idea.
"What's up, Cas?"
“You’re not in heat.” Castiel managed to get out as he sucked bruises into Dean’s leg.
"Wouldn't dream of it, little omega!" Castiel called back.
“I knew you liked grooming.” Castiel laughed and leaned in to place a kiss on the scars left on Dean’s shoulder. With every week and new event that they faced their relationship became more and more physical. It wasn’t just casual sex, it was comforting kisses and scent marking. It just seemed so normal for them even if they had broken half of the ruled in the contract so far. But Dean hadn’t brought it up so Cas left it alone.
Dean dresses himself in jeans and a band shirt and headed off towards the library to get a head start on everything. He can already tell this week is going to be hell.
“Are you ready?” Castiel asked quietly, his hand hovering over the gold knocker. Dean could only nod and pray this was the right choice. Never in a million years would he think he would be walking into the Novak house as a guest. Castiel gave three good knocks and pulled his hand back. Dean could hear voices from the inside and he clenched his teeth as the door opened.
at least we know I'm not dead
"I-um remember your part of the deal? The helping with my heat?" Castiel's cock twitches a little.
"Why would you thank me for that? It's such a simple command." Dean looked down.
“Yep, your mom wants me barefoot and pregnant as you and Meg dance in a field of fucking lilies!” Dean’s voice was rising with each word and he didn’t know who he wanted to attack more, Meg or Castiel’s mother. Castiel’s eyes went wide and the longer Meg smiled at him the tighter his throat felt, his heart beat was picking up and he started to sweat.
.” Cas growled, tearing up. “Jesus, this is WAY worse than being punched in the dick!” Dean looked apologetically over at Cas
“About what?”
So does anyone have any guesses on how this will play out?
“Let’s go.” They stood only inches from each other and Dean took the first strike to Castiel’s gut. He was easily stopped and flipped around with his arm bent behind him. “Oh don’t tell me I’ve beaten you already.” But before Castiel could give out a laugh Dean forcefully pulled forward and took the distracted alpha with him. Letting go of Dean’s arm he landed on the wrestling mat with a smack, all the air escaping his lungs. It only took a few fleeting seconds for him to jump back up.
“Yeah something.”
"No, I was just upset because not one of those men deserve you." Dean paused for a second.
again and fell into sputtering uneven thrusts that had them both yearning for release.
“You wanted me to be convincing.” Dean shrugged with a shit eating grin.
"Mm, Cas what time is it?" Dean croaked, his voice rough from sex and sleep.
"Welcome back, Dean." Castiel said with a smile and the woman got up from Cas' bed.
"Back off." He snarled and unlocked the door. Rushing in he slammed it behind him. He almost fell to his knees at the first breath, every ounce of Castiel's markings are gone and the sweet smell of omega slick was making his heart race.
That was one thing Dean checked first and regularly, eye color. That was what told you whether or not you should haul ass away from an alpha.  Centuries have separated them from their werewolf ancestors but the alphas still had the ability to change parts of them. Gold eyes was they key, if you see those and don’t want to fight you sure as hell better run. Thankfully his roommates’ were a perfect shade of blue and was no threat - as of now.
"I think we did." Crowley now gripped Dean's arm.
“We could move this to the bed.” Dean offered. He groaned immediately at what he said “I didn’t mean for that to sound so-” Castiel actually turned and smirked.
“Oh, yeah, I mean he just started crying out of nowhere I don’t-” Balth looked at him, a defined crease on his brow. Dean realized they weren’t talking about the same thing. “-You meant Gabe was in a state.” Balthazar nodded slowly.
"Is he the one in the picture?" Cas smiled and nodded.
"Nothing really," Dean paused, he couldn't tell him he and Alfie talked about him and his ex. "I heard you liked bees." A wide smile curled on Cas' lips and blush appears on his cheeks.
"Oh fuck, do you know how pissed he is going to be when he find out I blew it and now I'm a public omega." Dean started pacing, Castiel could smell the worry on Dean. “I mean do you know what he’ll do to me?” Dean’s face was burning up and his throat tightened. This, this is what hell was like.
"I have daddy and papa! And Auntie Anna and Uncle Cassie and Alfie! I have a big family." She extended her arms to show Dean how large it really was and gave him the biggest smile. She was happy with her family, completely isolated in a basement away from her real pack and she doesn't give a shit about them. Dean felt tears start to streak his cheek again. Beckett looked at them for a second util shit leaned in to kiss one.
“Well duh, that’s why you’re studying to be one.” Dean started and wobbled but Castiel steadied him.
It wasn’t working, Dean’s stomach was twisted and a knot had formed in his throat, he felt awful for what he was doing. Even now just thinking of it a wave of panic rolled over him. what if he was being watched right now? The soothing moment was killed as he felt phantom eyes creeping over his private moments with Cas, he wanted to shield them and growl at the ghost of a wolf that had been following him. The only thing more terrifying than being followed was the notion that he could be imagining it all.
"C-Cas you're such a damn tease. I know you want it. Fuck me Cas, fuck me like your body keeps telling you to." Castiel became more forceful. Shoving his tongue deeper and gripping Dean's hips harder. "I'm presenting so perfectly for you, come on. Knot me." Maybe it was the smell of rut, or the overwhelming urge to please his mate, or Dean just accepting he was an omega and Cas was an alpha. This wasn't all Dean was good for but he was the only one who could bring Cas to his knees. If anything, Dean was the one who had the power.
"We're going to the same place, how about I walk you? Your alpha normally walks you, right?" His tone was offputting.
Castiel let out a deep snarl and tried to restrain himself from pinning Dean down and fucking him into the mattress. Slick helped Dean ride Castiel, he growled down at the alpha as he set his own pace. Castiel’s back arched with every thrust until both of them were nearly snarling at each other between kisses. It only lasted a few minutes as they each slammed their bodies together. Until the last choked back growl and they both collapsed, knotted together in the most intimate way possible. It was exhausting as they tangled their legs together and fell back to sleep.
"God Cas please no," Dean begged for him not to gang up on him but suddenly Alistair’s cold hands weren't wrapped around his neck and blood chilling snarls were being exchanged behind him.
“Uh, cool.” he said backing out of the room to go brush his teeth. As he worked the toothbrush through his mouth, he listened to Dean dress. It was weird, this thing they were doing, really weird. Cas was making it weirder by suggesting they break a rule and go have dinner. Maybe Dean thinks it’s just casual, “let’s go get a burger,” but isn’t that what it was? It could never be anything more than that, could it? Cas shook his head, rinsing his mouth out, and returning to Dean.
"What part? The orgasm, because most people like that part." Jo laughed and bumped him with her elbow.
"Oh," the line was quiet for a while. Neither of them knew what to say. "I-I mean, I don't know he never talked about you taking a mate. And you know I wouldn’t tell him, right?"
"No, I think Castiel has grown very close to you Dean. But that is just how I see it as an outside spectator. I don't know what happens behind closed doors." Dean smiled, oh and you won't be finding out “But Castiel is extremely loyal and if you are friends and some kind of bond is forming he’s the kind of person who would go to hell for you.”  Alfie looked at his watch and started to stand reaching for his hat and apron.
“Maybe that’s why I like it.” Dean walked towards him to fix his collar.
"Ready?" Castiel asked and Dean nodded. They walked towards the door until they saw the knob turn and two men walk through, obviously their time was up.
"My perfect omega."
Castiel gasped and grabbed the wall for support. The water still splashed at his back and Dean make quick work of Castiel's cock. Taking him deep and humming his tongue sliding over the soft curve. The vibrations made Cas groan, he instinctively threaded his fingers through Deans wet hair and resisted the urge to buck forward.  Dean's head bobbed on Castiel's cock. Then he pressed his tongue to slide over the underside of Castiel’s head making him whine. Wrapping his fingers around the base, Dean licked over the smooth salty head. Looking up he caught Castiel's ice blue gaze as he pulled his cock down deeper into his mouth, pumping with his hand and lips. Occasionally swirling his tongue over his head to lick off Castiel’s precome.
"Shh, I haven't seen you in a long ass time and I want to meet this new mate of yours. Don't fight with me Castiel. I will win." Cas sighed and rested his head in his hands.
“You have to understand it is a reasonable investment.  Dean almost flinched at the word investment, like he was buying her to lower Dean’s supposed ranking. It’s responsible because who would let an omega run things, this woman was getting on Dean’s last nerve.
"You got any forks?" The man shrugged and walked over to a silver table rummaging through a large cardboard box. He pulled out a handful of individually wrapped plastic forks and handed them to Dean. Pulling his brow together he mentally counted them. He was holding at least seven.
"Yeah, and I'm still fucking tired." Dean groaned and flopped back down on his pillow.
"You don't have to explain it if you don't want to. But you are my perfect omega. I don't know why you would want to cover your scent. You are an omega with an alpha spirit and you keep me on my toes in the most amazing way. So don't hide that smell from me, please." Dean didn't speak, he didn't know what to say. Yeah Crowley was the reason behind it but all he did was nod, that's all Castiel needed. "I love you, Dean Winchester."
"The woods, Alistair." At that Castiel snarled, baring his teeth. Dean saw his eyes darken and he flinched slightly, Castiel took a breath to calm down. " forget about it for now, get me home and I'll tell you everything. Just come on my hand hurts like a mother fucker.
16 year old me had a lot more planned for this ending. With everything that has happened in the years since I started posting this story I really never imagined I would be posting the ending and although it isn't anything like what I pictured I have to say I am so proud of myself for doing it. I make a habit of starting things and never following through and this story has sat in the back of my mind for YEARS taunting me. I will forever be grateful for every comment I received on this wild story. Writing is something I love doing but have a very hard time with.
The past few weeks had been hell for Dean, he couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched and he couldn’t function under the extra stress. He knew that Castiel felt he was hiding something from him but he couldn’t bring himself to put the stress on him. So when Dean woke up just as he did every morning, he was startled by the sad, worry-filled blue eyes that were watching him. Blinking away his sleep fogged vision he took in the unsettling image in front of him. a nagging chant of bad mate, bad mate, bad mate trailed through his mind and he started the morning with guilt gnawing away at his stomach.
"I can give orders just fine, and I'm not just some omega. I am your son's mate and sadly that makes me part of your pack but if you can't accept that I can play the omega, beta, and
"My papa says that ‘rain makes the flowers grow’ whenever I cry." Dean only gave her a smile and pulled her in for a hug and kissed her temple.
“And how will I look if I can’t teach a grown man to skate, the kids will never take me seriously.” Even though Dean was annoyed, he grinned at the idea of a teacher-castiel wrangling a bunch of snot nosed brats, and force feeding them Shakespeare and the Great Gatsby.
“I’m sorry you had to come here.” he said “My family sucks.”
"Coming!"
“Dean Ethan Winchester...DEW. You are damp grass.” Dean looked at Cas dead in the eyes for a few seconds until they both burst into a laughing fit.
Making it back to the dorm they barely had time to put down their coffee before Dean’s phone was ringing. Castiel nearly jumped at Dean's side, moving slightly closer.
"Who were you calling alpha then?"
"Let me fucking finish." Every ounce of the Dean who was cuddling with him just minutes ago was gone.
The rain wasn't lightening up but they still held each other tight.
"He wants me to come? To your parents house?! Did you say yes?"
"And I'm in fucking heat, it’s a basic necessity  I can't believe I got through that conversation. Now come one alpha do your job." Another twitch of Castiel's quickly hardening cock. Dean would probably be pissed at him once his heat was over but now, he was just looking for a satisfying release from his terrible symptoms. “And don’t think is a forgiveness fuck, you are just convenient and such.” Castiel chuckled and nodded his head even though Dean couldn't see him.
"Wait, what!?" Castiel asked shooting up into a sitting position and taking Dean with him.
Thank you again to Emilie for being the most amazing editor and idea partner ever!
"No, my father is. But I spent a good majority of my childhood patching up Alfie and Gabriel."
"What have you been doing today, little man?"
"Shut up, bitch."
(See the end of the chapter for
"So what did you need?" Castiel asked his brother trying to act normal, he knew Dean was trying to make the phone call as awkward as possible.
Guess who's back!!!!
Cas pulled off but continued kneading the perfect swell of Dean's ass.
It only took three large steps and he was at the shower door. Sliding it open Dean stepped in and under the water pushing Castiel into the wall.
“Hey, they suck alright but let’s just relax until it’s time to go and see Beckett.” Dean walked over and gently rubbed Castiel’s shoulder. Castiel relaxed slightly under his grip and leaned back into him. This trip was hard on Dean but it was even worse on Cas, Dean had grown up learning you needed thick skin to be an omega. This was just the last straw to let Castiel know he didn’t fit in this pack.
“Dean,” The omega finished for her with a chuckle.
“Well look who dragged their ass out of bed to see us?” A very familiar face looked at him from the porch with a smile, straight blonde hair and bright eyes, Jo welcomed them and she made her way down the steps. Her normal t-shirt, jean, boot attire on and Dean welcomed her into a hug.
"Oh, hey guys." Dean nodded at the beta.
The drive home was comfortably quiet and the sun was almost completely gone from the pastel sky. They parked in their normal spot and piled out, it was a short walk to the dorm and the night was quickly cooling off.
"What's wrong with my button-ups?"
"Rock, paper scissors says shoot!" They both chose paper, Cas chuckles.
"It is, people who drink vanilla are vanilla in bed, it's proven." He shot back, stealing Cas' cherry.
Dean was finishing up his paper and went to add in the heading. Looking at the corner of the screen and noticing the date, suddenly Dean questioned where the time went and then he froze.
"Are you kidding me, mom? No! Get her out!" Anna was obviously upset and Dean didn't know if he wanted to walk into a war zone.
Squeezing out some gel Castiel gingerly rubbed it into the hot patches of rug burn. Dean winced a few times but took to deep breathing instead. Once he was finished putting on the ointment Castiel searched through his kit once more. Pulling out three medium sized gauze patched and some medical tape.
"Come on, little alpha. That all you got?" Dean gave him a smile but he was soon tiring.
"I fully agree one hundred percent that I want you to knot me until I cry." A whimper fell from Castiel's lips and a kiss from Dean sealed the deal.
Castiel was off and running with one mission in mind,
The house was only lit by the sunlight that managed to pass through the thick trees that surrounded the house and they each walked in silence, Dean slightly bumped into Cas and felt the alpha linger for a little but eventually pulled away and walked around to the passenger side. Dean wonders if the entire ride home will be like this and he prays that Castiel will break his silence.
Fuck fuck fuck! What was he supposed to do?
It was fast and heated, they practically ripped each others clothes off. Castiel gave Dean little preparation, stretching him out with two fingers before Dean demanded he fuck him. Once Castiel slid in they both felt a strike of lightning shoot through their bodies that struck their core, igniting it. With every thrust the energy grew, building up in their stomachs ready to explode and swallow the two. They couldn't talk, only moan, whine, and cry as Cas pounded into Dean.
Dean leaned up against the wall to catch his breath. The nearly glass building was quiet, all the modern like chairs were empty. Dean felt the invisible eyes watching him and his breathing picked up once more. Pressing the heel of his hand into his eyes until he saw spots behind his lids. With a shaky breath, Dean gathered himself and left towards his class trying desperately to ignore the heavy gaze that he knew was watching him.
“We should do that.” Dean sighed knowing he couldn’t keep pushing it off. “Now.”
This is the last chapter until our next hiatus, I'm sorry!
"You bit him like...bit him, bit him?"
“Wow.” he said stating his presence in the room. Dean looked up at him quickly and gave him a small sheepish smirk.
“So what, am I going to have another one soon?”
"Alpha mode, it's called alpha mode you over possessive bastard." Dean's words didn't contain any anger he was more amused than anything.
"Yeah but it's been years and I was thinking more Castiel for this one. Just start him off slow."
"What about last night?"
“Welcome back to reality.”
"Alright, Sam. Talk to ya soon." Dean hung up and let out a breath. He was still looking up at the ceiling, he was so damn relieved. Dean pulled himself up off the bed to make his way to the coffee shop but his books caught his eye.
“Oh little Winchester what have you gotten yourself into.” With that Dean shot off running in the direction of the dorm. A sudden instinct to chase hit Castiel and a growl rumbled in his chest at the thought of anyone even thinking of following Dean but himself.
"Oh fuck." He was upset.
"Things never change do they?"
"What, are we trying to out sex each other?" Dean looked up with bright green eyes that said ‘you don’t have a chance’. Castiel replied with a ‘bring it’ smile’.
"Your mom is a bitc- uh, crazy lady and you dad is just nasty." That was as far as he would go with such an impressionable little pup in his arms.
“Caught you.” Dean let out a small laugh and turned his neck out to Castiel slightly so the alpha had more to worship and kiss, a mix of purrs and possessive growls vibrated in Castiel’s chest and Dean was laughing slightly.
"It's like, roommates with benefits. We have sex, and get the perks of mates without being mates." Castiel moved under the spray to wash and cum off of himself.
"Sammy, I know I say no chick flick moments so this conversation is so off the record that you better forget the second it's over." Dean's nerves twisted in his stomach and he had a sudden urge to piss.
"Fuck." Going back into the bathroom to rinse out his mouth he returned with toilet paper to wipe up the mess.
"I'm happy to be here." Castiel beamed and they fell back into less personal conversations.
"You need to get to the room, you're like a fucking beacon to those knotheats." Cas shoved his way inside and pulled Dean in behind him. "Those sick fucks can't control a damn thing about themselves!"
"Yeah what about you? You expect me to believe you gave that mighty show for free? That you didn't drag me in here to knot me up you fucking Novak?" Dean spat, he had no idea how he was still standing and the smell of Cas nearly brought him to his knees.
Dean was already fed up with all this heat crap.
"I'll make a deal with you" Dean spoke up after a few minutes.
“Good!” She laughed, her eyes were practically gold and that seemed odd to Dean. Until he saw her father and if she wasn’t a spitting image of him. He wore an army green button-up and light washed jeans. A large smile curled on his face when he saw his brother. His eyes drifted to Dean briefly and moved back to his daughter.
"Yes! I'm a fucking omega, okay?" Deans words lost their sting, he bowed his head. How did this all fucking happen?
But that never does last.
Dean has researched betas since he presented. He knows more on them than himself. He tries to act like them and completely ignore every omega instinct he has. Most importantly his heat, something Dean has never experienced himself. John had him on all types of experimental and highly illegal drugs. So he's twenty two and has never gone into heat, and if his father has any say in it then it may stay like that forever.
“Can I not walk freely you middle aged knotheads.” This was a topic that had Dean fuming, like he was this small flower that couldn’t be left unattended or he would be trampled by the dogs.
“I just don’t understand her, I mean why does it even matter?” Castiel slumped down on the bed and pinched the bridge of his nose. Dean sat beside him and gently rubbed his shoulder.
“Work? Really? Because now, not only does half the campus know I’m an omega now those assholes are going to tell the goddamn world about us!”
“I’m sorry this happened to you.” He said, looking down at the pillow between them.
Castiel snakes out of his jeans and pulled the comforter over their bare skin. Nuzzling close to his mate he traced shapes on Dean's arm. Castiel definitely got the better end of the deal.
Nothing.
"Yes, Dean it would. Now lets get washed up and dressed." Castiel laughed and placed a soft kiss on Dean's left cheek. Pulling himself off Dean was a difficult task. Not physically, but mentally all he wanted to do was burrow into the warmth of the man. He was now starting to regret not knotting him.
Castiel looks taken aback by how straightforward Dean was.
"You fuckers, I'm going to kill you!" Dean roared and shot after his brother. They looked like deer in headlights as they bolted to Sam's room and tried to shut the door but Dean was fast, scary fast, and threw his weight into the door and busted it open. "You start off the prank war by going after Cas!" Dean lunged for Adam first and pinned him to the ground. He may be up against an alpha and beta but Dean had been wrestling them his whole life. He knows just how to handle them. Going straight for the ribs he is merciless as he tickles the ever-living shit out of his brother.
“Much better than anticipated, I was worried that the stress of travel and meeting your pack would hinder my healing process but it doesn't seem to make a difference.” Mary still placed a soft hand on his back and rubbed him, it was subtle but she was scenting him as a sign he was accepted. Castiel felt truly touched by her immediate love towards him.
"The fuck?" Dean's eyes were wide from the shock of falling.
“You’re un-fucking-bearable.” Castiel sighed rubbing his eyes.
"Like in bed?"
since it was day three of Dean's heat and yesterday was filled with sex, the second day was always the worst. Constant sex, Cas could barely get him to eat or drink and by night he was spent. Thankfully if Dean's heat was anything like his brother it was only uphill from here.
“So that's five months. Gabe gave me the same offer before but thankfully I could turn him down, they have almost enough to get far far away and I'm not taking a penny from that fund. Beckett needs a safer home to grow up in, she shouldn’t be an invisible child.” The conversation turned sour.
"I don't know I mean I wanted a big family too since I only have two other brothers. I've never been to an actual omega doctor, you know where they can check your fertility and that shit." Dean felt Castiel's fingers tense protectively on his stomach.
"You were brilliant tonight." Castiel whispered as he placed a chaste kiss on Dean's mouth, he could taste the whiskey on his lips. "Now sit back and relax Dean." Castiel crawled all the way down the bed until he was back on his knees by Dean's feet. He traced his fingertips over his shins and soft kisses on his ankles. Slowly working his way up, giving every inch of skin attention. Dean let out pleasant hums as Castiel inched up. Placing a kiss in the center of his kneecap and the bend of his leg. Around the inside of his thigh and around to the outside to suck light bruises just above his hipbones. Memorizing the peppering of freckles over Dean's lightly tanned skin. Hooking his finger around his waistband he tugged it down a few inches to place a row of soft kisses that connected his protruding hip bones. The skin was taut and lighter than his stomach. Dean's erection brushed his throat.  Following the trail up to his belly button after leaving a slick trail from his tongue. Castiel was worshiping every inch of Dean's perfect body. From the hair in his legs to the soft give of his stomach and the spatter of freckles on his shoulders. Moving up to slid Dean's nipple between his teeth and moving down his side to suck and nip his ribs.

Hope you all enjoy, really looking forward to feedback!
“We can’t take a knot, our bodies aren’t built that way.” Castiel was flashing back to the assortment of things she had bought for him, she was the alpha, a horrible sadistic woman. He remembered the horrible pain, she never stopped it was his fault he couldn’t get off. It was always Castiel’s fault.
Once Castiel was fully in he took no time to pick up the pace and create a quick and brutal rhythm. Dean felt like he was folded in half and the strength and power behind each thrust was smacking Dean's head into the door. Castiel gave him a glance as if asking for approval. Dean nodded, he wanted this, the closeness, contact, he wanted to help Cas through whatever was going on. So Castiel started and shivered from pleasure and pushing deep into the safety of Dean.
"No, I like my room and I don't think Dean would like to move." They walked up another flight and Castiel pointed to the door. "This is my floor." This time Rachel held the door open for Cas and they made their way down the hall to his room where a whiteboard hung and Dean seemed to change what it said.
"Just shut up and eat your chips."
"I want to be a teacher."
Dean started scribbling down rules that had to be followed, he chewed on the tip of the pen and scrunched his brow when he focused.
“No, no I was a huge family, it’s just, wait why am I telling you?” Castiel was slightly taken aback, and he looked away from Dean.
“I win.” Dean smiled and rolled off of Castiel who fell to his side.
“What happened to your no cuddling rule?” Dean only purred in response as he searched for comfort in his alpha.
"No sir, it's 10:41. I'm sorry we stop serving breakfast eleven minutes ago."
"Hey, you want to meet uncle Cassie's mate?" Beckett's eyes light up and she nodded excitedly.  Castiel walked over to Dean and without hesitation Beckett leaned towards Dean for him to hold her. Dean felt a split second of fear, yeah he had held kids before he was always helping out with his brothers when they were younger. But this was a strange pup who openly crawled into his unsteady arms. But once her scent of honeysuckle and grass filled his nose he melted into her.
"Non GMO, so it taste like styrofoam?" Castiel raised and eyebrow.
“So I’m going to have to ask why you thought it was okay to fool around in a public parking lot.”
"Yeah, I'm sure you've got a calendar of only religious dates from all around the world." Dean shot poking his head out of the bathroom. "It doesn't matter, today is very important so shave the roadkill of your face and get dressed."
“Dean!” He shouted storming up to his brother.
"Uh yeah, once he presented as an omega he was shoved into the dark and this has been where he's lived. It's a nice place but that doesn't excuse the fact his own family denied his existence." Dean couldn't help the sick feeling twist in his gut, he and Gabriel were in the same boat.
"I fucking knew it!" Sam yelled "Knew it since you called me weeks ago with that question about me and Jess! Why didn't you told me sooner?" Sam was way too excited, he was a fricken puppy for Christ's sake.
"Mark." Castiel grumbled as he pulled out his fingers. "Mate." Manhandling Dean he placed him in just right the spot. He unceremoniously shoved and with a growl. "Breed." Dean let out a hiccup of a moan and worked in time with Castiel to push back on his cock.
“Oh, sure he’s not some creepy stalker?” Castiel asked looking back at the beta.
"No Dean. You set your clock back in winter and up in summer." Dean's face was blank and not even the man over the speaker spoke.
“I like dick.”
Dean must of known what he was doing to Castiel because just as he slipped into the door to their building he flashed Cas a shit eating grin and sprinted to the stairs.
Castiel placed his hand on Dean's upper thigh.
"Dean, have you ever thought you just made a friend? That nothing more was going on? Maybe he just thinks you're cool." Friend...casual sex buddies...fake mates. It's all the same.
"And anything else to drink? Or do you want me to just being you more water?" The alpha girl asked.
"Oohh, the lies have begun. Sure he isn't shagging an alpha down the hall?" An unexpected snarl burst out of Castiel chest and they were both taken aback. Hadn't he just told Dean he wasn't tied to Cas? For some reason Castiel felt like taking those words back, maybe it was the events that unfolded in the car but Castiel suddenly felt anger towards anyone who would touch Dean in that manner. "Wow, sorry there buddy."
"I love you."
"Is this breaking the rules?" He chose his words carefully. The real question was "Is this a date?" But he didn't want to just come out and ask that. Dean thought for a second.
Dean held himself up on his knees and angled Castiel's cock with his entrance. Pressing Cas' head against his hole a mix of slick and cum leaked out making it easier for Castiel to slide in. Dean's jaw was dropped and eyes squinted shut as he pushed himself down in Castiel's cock.
They both turned their heads when the door opened and listened carefully to the footsteps; Castiel.
"I won't promise I'll behave." Dean swung his legs around and hopped off the bed and walked towards the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m gonna wait on outin’ myself, college isn’t a place I want to  be a lone omega.  Shit happens here.”
“God,” Cas panted “Backseat. Now.” Dean nodded, swinging his door out and bounding from the car, and then into the backseat. Cas met him and they started kissing again. Cas’ hands were everywhere, tearing away clothes left and right. Dean just went with it, screw the contract, he wanted this, they both did. Cas nipped at Dean’s chest sending shivers over his body. Dean moaned quietly.
“Well, I hope y’all are hungry because my special french toast is done and ready to fix all your problems. Get John’s ass in here, no one can be mad with a mouth full of these.” She smiled and placed a large plate piled high with the most delicious looking breakfast out there. Light fluffy toast with small sticky lines of syrup dripping down the pile and sprinkled with powdered sugar. She was right, no one could be mad when eating this.
. It had to be him, he was looking for him. With that, he managed to dig his finger into a loose loop on the rope and work his way out.
"He treated me like a lab rat! Always telling me not to tell anyone and it was normal for an omega to do this! He said it would help me in the future and god damn I looked up to the man so I believed him!" Dean's face was turning red and his eyes glazed over with unshed tears. Castiel had no idea what to say, so he sat back and listened. Dean's probably kept every word bottles up, it was about time he popped. "No it wasn't until high school when I decided to look a few things up, and boy was I surprised to find out there was nothing on the market for any of that stuff! So yeah, I sure as hell bet my dad did care about me...this is until I turned seven and crushed his damn dreams."
"Damn I'm scared." She didn't lift her head, she was fighting back tears and couldn't talk to Ellen face to face. "I can't do anything, my words only go so far!"
“I am so sorry.” Castiel gave Dean a quick kiss on the cheek. “I promise it will get better.”
“Shut up and scrub.” Dean leaned into Castiel’s chest and the alpha moved his hands down, rubbing over his tense muscles. Moving down he kneaded at Dean’s ass and lower back, eliciting moans from the omega. Castiel pushed Dean back under the spray to wash off the soap.
But it was always like this, his father never looked at him the same after that day. He was now a lesser person who needed to be prepared because to the public he was a toy, even a bag of cash. Just a breeder. So Dean felt he could still prove to his father he was as good as an alpha and pushed himself further.
"Dean, you don't sound well. What happened? Where are you?" Panic was rising in Castiel's voice and he could hear him get up from his bed and leave their room with a slam of a door.
"Yeah, sure. Well, I gotta go, Sammy. Need to let Cas know I wasn't kicked out of my pack because hell if we are going back to his. Man, they are nasty sons a bitches." Sam let out a laugh.
"You're alone, I offered my services when you were wet and needy. Now I need you to help me, it’s only fair." A growl was forming deep in Alistair's chest his nasally lisp gave Dean chills and he knew he was going to have to fight himself out of this one.
“She is here to be your bottom bitch, Cas.” Dean bit out as he glared daggers at Meg, she had this sadistic smile on her lips. Like she was enjoying this commotion she was causing.
Sam was taking his time with the newspaper and Dean had already settled in next to Cas.
Dean really didn't know if he was even welcome down here but he just needed to clear his mind of alpha, and Castiel's room wasn't the place.
"Very few complications, Mr.Winchester. Even with her past sickness through the pregnancy and she has delivered a healthy male pup." The smile that spread across John's face was almost painful
“Cas, I-I thought you said you’ve never had-”
It was dry, so unbearably dry and hot. For the love of God, his body was on fire as if the sun-kissed his skin every time he moved and his mouth felt like sand. Opening his eyes he saw his surroundings were not as he expected. He thought he would find himself on the beach, a desert, or maybe the surface of the sun. No, it was just a room, a horribly hot room. The bed was nearly scolding on his skin.
"Everyone needs to calm down, it's lunch, save the grudge match for later on. Get Gabriel later tonight it can be an omega vs alpha fight." Michael chuckled and bumped his elbow into Lucifer to encourage him to laugh also.
"I'm a big boy, no need to talk for me." Alfie looks between the two men in confusion and nods leading them over to an empty table.
“Shut up, it’s going in it.” Dean said not looking up.
"Shut up, Sammy it was not a drunken hookup!” Dean shouted over his brother.
"Oh shut up she could kick yours, too!"
"Just how do you think you can do that" Dean recollected himself, he had to make sure no emotions came through.
"I'm mated, you sick son of a bitch!" Dean snarled, trying to find a way out of the woods and away from Alistair.
Walking in the bathroom stark naked he followed after Castiel in the shower. Dean pushed Castiel out from under the shower head and took his spot. As he wet his hair Castiel squirted shampoo into his palm and stepped closer to Dean. The shower wasn’t that big but the two men had some space to themselves. Dean ducked out from under the spray and Castiel lathered up his hands to scrub them through Dean’s short sandy brown hair. He leaned his head back into Castiel’s massaging fingers and let out a purr.
“You think I remember any of that crap?”
"Thank you, so where have you been? I haven't seen you in so long, and you smell like omega. Taking a break on school and hooking up with some lonesome wolves?" She laughed as they walked down the aisle to their seat. Rachel knew Castiel wasn’t the type of person to do any of that.
“Um, well everyone this is Dean and he is my mate.” It was like ripping off a bandaid, do it fast. The room fell silent for a few seconds until Anna nudged her blonde haired brother.
"Hello." He said, he looked a little bored and based on how often he checked his watch, his shift was almost over.
It was almost three in the morning when they woke up tangled together in Dean’s bed. Dark red sheets caught in their legs.
“Sammy and I have this rule,” Dean said coming to a stop at a red light, leaning in very close “Driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cake hole.” He flicked the side of Cas’ head before returning his hands to the wheel.
Why was he upset? Hadn't he wanted Dean to be an alpha? That was what the doctor said, wasn't it?
The day went on and it was filled with pranks. Dean was greeted by glue in the mayo jar. Castiel put pickle juice in one of Sam's health drinks and Adam had the terrible luck of finding a brand new redshirt in the wash with his whites. It got so bad Mary kicked them out so that was how they ended up searching the town for entertainment.
“Okay okay, I’m sure I smell nice and claimed now let's get food because we don’t have anything here.” Cas nodded and walked over to the dresser to pull on a random button-up that was slightly wrinkled but the alpha didn’t seem to care one bit.
Senior year, buying a car, work, physical therapy, rescue work, and sleep. That is my weekly-daily-schedule so I am sorry for being SOOOO LATE! I have been so off from not sleeping and forgetting to eat and drink and all those basic things so it has really been a cluster of blurred actions and I didn't realize how much time had passed since the last update.
“Woah, hey, hey!” Dean jumped up and walked over to him “I was kidding, chill.” Dean chuckled running his fingers over Cas’ stubble. Cas blushed a little.
Alphas left him alone for the most part. His room reeked of mated omega and protective alpha claims. The most he received were catcalls and those never happened when Castiel was with him. It bothered Dean that he only gained respect when he was claimed, when he wasn't he was just a sex toy. Now he was someone's sex toy in their eyes so that should be respected.
"The 'Everyday Diner'" Dean read off the sign.
“Dean-” Cas sighed burying himself inside his omega, biting down on his side, right below his shoulder blade.
“No.” Cas kicked a rock on the side of the street “I mean if I didn’t-”
“So this uhh, shrink guy...when do you think we should contact him? I mean I’m sure he knows something about this crap.” Dean asked clicking through half-assed and non-credible websites. It was like everything and anything on this matter was taken off the damn internet. The only way to end it was depicted as this horribly painful and scarring process. There had to be some other way out.
Something cold brushed his cheek as the smell intensified.
Comments are always loved and cherished!
Dean quirked an eyebrow looking at Cas and mouthing 'Clarence?' Castiel quickly flinched from her too familiar touch and bumped shoulders with Dean, then quickly reeled away from him. Dean took notice of Castiel’s odd closed off reaction but pushed it to the back of his mind. Anna’s face was twisted into an annoyed glare at her mother and Naomi made eye contact with Castiel, like she was daring him to challenge her.
"Of course I have, the game is pure luck, though." He replied, then hastily added, "It's fun though."
“Why so glum?” Dean asked as he made his way over to Cas, running his hand through Cas’ already wind blown and messy hair. Pushing away all memories from before.
Dean went to grab a coffee before class, he needed a wake up, his mind was awfully cloudy. Pushing into the coffee shop he saw the regulars. No one he personally knew, only person here he could count as a friend would be Samandriel. Dean knows little about the alpha but he liked him. Seemed different than everyone else, maybe comes from some new aged alpha pack. Whatever it is Dean enjoys the mans company.
"Kinda, but your heat is longer than my rut so you're lucky. I mean do you know how hard it is to keep up with you sometimes? For at least a day at the peak, I have to force you to eat and drink." Dean blushed, sometimes he had a hard time remembering his heat. The first day was hard by the second was the worst. He squeezed every ounce of energy from Cas that day. Then it went back down to about two or three really needy times and the rest of the week is sex, grooming, and cuddling. That was the bonding part of heat when Dean's body temperature dropped for extremely high to very cold. He pretty much relied in Cas at that time. It's something in his body that changed in his makeup after being mated.
TRIGGER WARNING: Talk of past sexual and mental abuse, painful flashbacks -not detailed- past non-con, and angry but consensual sex
"I'm ah, great." He said glancing at Dean.
"No problem Dean, I mean we are family." They both laughed but Dean was cut off by his phone. Pulling it out he saw the ID, it was Cas.
"Cas, you literally only own button-ups, is there really that much of a choice?" Dean earned himself a fiery glare. "Okay, you want my help?"
"Well, yeah just...not my thing I guess." Cas mumbled. There are things Dean never had to know, he was leaving eventually anyway.
“Mother, Meg and I never hit it off and that was years ago. I have found Dean. I’m very happy.” Dean was surprised at how well Cas kept himself together. Dean watched Anna roll her eyes at he mother.
At six the alarm woke them up with its shrill beeps. Castiel fell off the edge of the small twin bed and crawled over to shut it off.
I am so sorry I am a day late! I was having technical and mental problems yesterday so please don't hunt me down and trap me in holy fire! -or a devils trap-
"Well thank god for Jo, I should write her a letter of gratitude." Dean slapped Cas' shoulder.
"Dean, I'm not justifying what he has-"
“How is he at taking orders.” A deep voice asked, finally making their way down the steps Dean finally saw who he assumed to be his buyer. He was much older than Crowley and very heavy set with a gray receding hairline and a widow's peak that seemed to be clinging onto his forehead by only a few strands. Dean was disgusted by the man, he had the scent of many other omegas on himself and guessed Dean was not his first purchase.
"I've been waiting for that," Mary spoke up from across the room. Every head in the room turned away from the door and back to her "Sometimes I think Dean is too good of a son for John." Mary ran a shaky hand through her golden hair and placed her bag down, the door not even shut behind her, Ellen held firm at her side.
"Two."
“You’re so perfect.” Castiel smiled up at Dean who wrapped his arms around Castiel’s neck, pulling him in for a kiss. Cas moved his hands down to Dean’s hips and started to rock him. Dean ducked his head into Castiel’s neck to nibble at the skin there as he pushed up on his thighs to slide off Cas. Sliding to the crown of his cock Dean dropped himself back down on Castiel’s hips.
Dean must have fallen asleep or dazed out because the next thing he realizes Castiel's warm hands are moving across his body.
Barely picking up speed Castiel's knot began to swell and Dean was nearing the edge. His broken moans still muffled in Castiel's lips and they both came with a shuddering cry.
"Yes, it's a long ass story on how he found out, but he did." Dean was so not going into details because he knew Jo would come storming over.
“Ca-” Dean was cut off by his own piercing moan as Castiel physically pulled Dean into his mouth. “Fu-,” It took a few seconds for Dean to say the other half as he was in shock over Castiel’s quick lips and skilled tongue. “ck!”
“That is my father, really it is.” Dean snickered and waved his hand as to brush it off. Castiel pushed the rolling chair back and went to walk over to Dean. He seemed to be getting better but he was still slightly skittish in public, especially new and open places. Castiel hadn’t sensed anyone watching them but that didn’t mean he wouldn’t do anything and everything to make his mate feel safer; and if that meant drawing the shades when they slept, then he would be damned if he didn’t do it. Castiel talked him out of the odder blockers and said he didn’t need them to intimidate anyone.
"So do you think Cas is only like this since he bit me?"
"I don't know if today is a good da-"
“Yeah, I think I’m going to have to. I mean I’m on suppressants but still. The only alpha I have lived with has been Sammy and then you for a little while.”
“Consensual.” Dean’s brow furrowed “I never had consensual sex before you.” Dean felt like there were boulders pushing down on his chest. His voice came out as a hoarse growl.
Emiliepond (Emilie) Thank you for being one boss ass editor and laughing at my 2am psycho babble!
“Dean, you don’t have to hide yourself anymore, you’re a twenty-two year old man and I know deep down you like being an omega, like deep down in the dark corners of your soul, so deep people stopped looking. Go find an alpha who doesn’t stop looking and have some pups because you may deny it but I know how you feel. Screw your dad and out yourself, I’m sure you will feel so much better.” Dean paused taking in everything she said.
“No, Dean.” Cas said weakly, grabbing his wrist. “Just, dont. Please, stay.” Dean kneeled down next to Cas. “I’ve had so much time to heal after it, so many things have happened that have helped me move passed it, I just- I just- seeing her,  it set me off.” Dean nodded, swallowing hard.
"I-I though from the text you wanted to end it, that you were going to make me leave. I never expected this." he paused, smiling “I ran out, and I heard you shouting from on the staircase, I just-” He exhaled loudly, running a hand through his hair. Soon Dean was tearing up again and Castiel took the contract from the omega’s hand and held it up between them. "I always hated this contract." They both laughed as Cas tore the paper in half. Castiel walked backwards pulling Dean with him their room. “Dean, god Dean I need you.” With watery eyes Dean pulled Castiel towards him once again and snaked his tongue in to claim him once again.
“What?”
“Cas, you are very vulnerable right now and I will not hesitate to punch you in the dick.” Water poured down onto them both and Castiel starts nipping and sucking at Dean’s neck.
That's how their senior year of college begins.
“I’m surprised you didn’t tell us, what ever happened to Meg? She was a lovely beta.” Castiel had to hold back a growl.
"Mm, fuck Cas!" Dean pushed back, persuading Cas to give him more. Cas obliged and took one hand back to slide two fingers into Deans wet heat. Sliding his tongue in next to them he pushed into Dean trying to pull out every ounce if slick his body had. He could taste himself mixed with slick spilling onto Castiel’s tongue. He was so receptive and egger.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I have to go, Cas," Dean whispered and placed a kiss on his mate's forehead.
"A-are you sure, everything’s okay?" Castiel asked lowering himself to his knees trying to look at Dean's face that was buried into the pillow.
“What is going on?” He asked but the smell of blood drew his eyes the house. “Are you okay?” He placed a soft hand on Dean to try and ground him. Dean probably looked crazy, his cut still trickling down his face and his hands covered in Castiel’s blood.
“I think they might have heard you Mr. Novak.” Castiel retaliated by letting go of Dean, and watched as he scrambled and fell again. Dean used the wall as support, hoisting himself up again. Castiel did a quick lap around the rink showing off a bit by skating backwards and adding in (an extremely manly) spin.
“Turn left.” he replied.
“Yeah, and it’s okay.” He gave his shoulder a reassuring squeeze “I’m sorry I’ve made things weird between us.”
"When did you change your ringtone?" Castiel paused, when did he change it? He remembered Dean listening to it one night and liked how Dean looked singing, how his eyes lit up. How his lips moved around every word making them sound like heaven and sin. He liked that memory and changed his ringtone so he would be reminded of it every day. But he wasn't about to tell Dean that.
"Oh yeah." Mary shook her head and made her way up the stairs. She walked down the long hallway until she reached the bedroom door, she couldn't hear anything from the outside and that usually meant he was sleeping.
. He tried to move his hands around and ignored the protest of his raw skin. He needed to feel what kind of knot he was working with, this was no time to blank out he has trained his whole life for this very situation.
Bye now.
"The hell is wrong with you, Cas?" Castiel took a moment to respond.
"God, Cas do you feel this spent after my heat?" Castiel chuckled and wound his arms around Dean to place a kiss on his lips.
“Dean, can I get you anything?” Walking over to Dean’s side once more. Castiel felt utterly useless, he would love to run into the woods and tear off that bastard’s head, but he can’t leave Dean.
“Fine, fine.” he conceded “Are you done?”
"My smell?"
"We all have our calling." Cas mused laying back into his pillow. They were both looking up at the ceiling. The one damn thing that hasn't changed since the school year started. Still flaking away.
"Well you should show me your room, and maybe tonight you can show me a few things you've been thinkin' about." Placing a kiss on Castiel's lips they both went back upstairs. Castiel lead the way down the hall and thankfully the family had moved out of the kitchen and onto their own things.
“Hey, um so how would this be called off? I’m not asking for me since my mind and body think you’re mine but.” Dean paused, he knew Dean wasn’t his mate but saying the words make his throat tighten, “What if you find a real mate?”
“A locket?” Dean asked putting down the bracelet he was looking at.
"I want to be a mechanic. I was kinda forced here I guess. I even know someone who will hire me but no I have to be here first." This sounded like a not so fun topic of Dean's.
"Yep, busy busy. Now come on." Cas' was practically shoving Rachel out of the door before he shut it.
He only got an annoyed groan in response so Dean left his mate to sleep, but not after placing a soft kiss on his temple.
Sorry it's so late! We have had finals and so yeahhh...hopefully you all like the chapter!
"D-Dean, are you sure?" Castiel asked dancing from knee to knee as the need to mate consumed him. Dean pushed his ass higher and swayed back and forth.
“Aw come on Cas! You gotta tell me somethin'.” Cas had been giving him vague directions for twenty minutes now, and he better believe he’s paying for the gas on this adventure.
“No problem, hey you're the alpha, keep your brother in line.”
"Thanks," Cas mumbled and gratefully accepted the hot mug that was going to get him through the day.
"Generally no, my brother would endlessly complain to me about it."
"I hope your apple pie was fricken worth it!" Sliding back in he took off out of the parking lot.
"I'm going to dislodge your jaw, Dean!" But he didn't listen and took Castiel's knot like a champ. It stretched his mouth to maximum capacity and he tried to keep up with the come sliding down his throat. Castiel’s nails dug into the tile and he leaned his head back, soaking in the pure bliss of his release. After a few moments Cas looked down with shock and amazement.
Dean wakes up to the smell of alpha musk. What the hell is that, honey, grass, and lemon? It's such a confusing mixture of smells and it almost gives Dean a headache. The smell is stuck to his clothes and his bed barely smells like him. Then again he takes suppressants for that very reason, even still it's time they crack a window. It is still warm out and fresh air could do everyone some good. Dean tried to fall back asleep, the warm sun's rays danced on his legs and it was a soothing feeling. He would miss the warmth, it was always hard when it got cold. Opening a window wasn’t always the answer then.
"Yes, Dean." Castiel had moved his hands down to Dean's lower back and rested his chin on Dean's shoulder.
“Well come on in, uh-” She paused realizing she didn’t know his name.
"Yeah, I mean I tried being nice and then your mom wanted my papers! Do omegas even have papers anymore?" Dean was getting worked up again and followed Gabriel to the sofa.
“Then what was it?”
The feeling in his gut started to level out like it was pointing him in one direction instead of all of them. He took that as him being close. Castiel couldn’t help but think of all the time he took for granted with Dean. How he would give anything to be in those moments again.
Jo lead the way to the door, Dean held Cas back a few steps and gave him a soothing squeeze of his hand to ground him. Dean knew how he felt, just a few weeks ago he was in the same position and that ended less that great. Opening the faded white door to reveal a warm living room filled with Dean’s pack.
Dean darts for the other side of the room putting as much distance between them as possible.
"Dean-"
"The closet omega?" Her voice was now a frantic whisper.
“Okay, what I got so far, tough little girl who loves her daddy.” Dean smiled, he thinks he’ll like her. “And her uncle, obviously.”
Dean was pacing around the room, nerves gnawing at his stomach. His phone was clutched in his hand, Sam's phone number was light up on his screen. He knew it was time to tell his family. Really every step of what they had done was unethical. The fact they had been mated for this long and haven't told his family, well, in short, it was pretty messed up.
"So now that you're done lying to me, and good thing because, hell Dean, no asshole in this school knows you like me and they don't deserve you." Dean's smile faltered a little as he thought about Cas' words.
"Are you sure you’re not just staking your claim because you're addicted to sex?" Dean laughed trying to play off Castiel's very intimate comment.
“C-Cas, there is a cop outside.” Castiel shot upright and sent Dean tumbling backwards almost hitting his head on the door. “Smooth move asshole.”
"Shut the fuck up, Watson." Dean looked wide eyed as if he had never heard that before. "As I was saying, I want to be a high school teacher so maybe I can instill some ethical thoughts like equality into their peanut brains."
“What’s so funny?” Dean asked eyeing Cas suspiciously.
"Yeah we actually talked about you." Castiel's eyes widened a little and he moved uncomfortably on the bed.
"Lower your damn voice!” Dean demanded scared others from his pack would be interested in Sam’s newfound excitement. “It is so much more complicated than that, Sammy." Dean ran a hand through his hair as he tried to think of words on how to phrase it all.
“Hey boys come on over here!” An overly excited blonde waved at them, “join our little sharing circle!” Dean tensed and cursed at himself for being seen. The fake mates exchanged awkward glances at each other and slowly made their way over.
"It's a gun, you should run." Dean only made a pleased sound and slithered down Castiel's body.
“Great, can’t wait to beat you because I have a great pair in mind.” Dean gave a sly smile and for some reason that turned Castiel on, he liked the powerful side of Dean.
*      *     *
But his body betrayed him and he felt the dampness creep across his entire abdomen the feeling in his fingers fleeted. The world drifted off around him.
“Alright let’s get ready and head out,” Sam added already dumping the rest of his coffee down the drain. They all walked up the steps and dispersed to their rooms.
"How in the world do you think I could hide being omega when every time I have sex I self lubricant?" Castiel couldn’t help but laugh and press his lips on Dean's. "but I had you going didn't I?" Castiel nodded.
"Yes, sir." With that John left and Dean struggled with his expertly tied ropes. The metal chair felt like ice on his rope burnt wrists.
Next update will be Tuesday April 29th!
"Yeah with the two of us going at it like bunnies I'm sure that's it." Dean snapped. It came out so much nastier than he meant it but with the amount of fear and panic consuming him, he wasn’t in total control.
"Okay, I'll get her a gift. I have to go now."
A feral growl ripped out of Castiel's chest as he latched onto the back of Dean's neck.
By the way Dean was breathing Castiel knew he was asleep and probably would be for a while. Castiel took that time to rub down every part of Dean he could touch, kissing him and scenting him. Bitting soft marks into his back as a claim. The sound and smell of alphas walking around the hallways set Castiel on edge. Dean was his, he was knotted in him and no alpha out there should look at him. Even though there was a locked door between them Castiel still felt the urge to frantically mark Dean, rubbing his wrist across his back as a warning. It was all he did until another wave of cum dumped out and caused Castiel to shiver. Multiple orgasms were a gift and a curse during rut.
“Good.”
“Dean why are you such a little bitch!” Sam whispered. The whole table erupted in laughter.
His jeans were replaced by gray slacks and a white button-up.
“No, mom everything's just peachy but I have to cut this short because GAH-” Dean shouted as Castiel nuzzled him off the bed and pinned him to the ground, licking strips up Dean’s neck he was defeated. With Castiel straddling his hips he placed a hand lightly on the alphas back and breathed in a deep breath before talking to him mom once more.
“Yeah.”
Shaking his head Dean started purring and scenting Cas. “Not as good as your knot.”
"Okay, lay back and give me a few ideas." Castiel smiled and pushed Dean back into his pillow. They tangled themselves together and diverged a plan.
"You're late." Dean's body felt heavy like weights were hanging from his arms and legs. It was a struggle turning his head and soon the pressure grew. Pressing on his chest and ribs he tried to identify the voice.
“Yeah, I understand ya.” Dean looked up from his pants  to the door as  Castiel walked in.
“I’m sure he is nothing.”
Castiel pressed his chest harder into Dean's shins bringing them close to his chin and raising his ass higher giving Castiel better leverage.
Standing up Dean moved himself in front of Castiel, pushing him back on the bed closer to the headboard. Once he felt he had enough room Dean crawled after Cas who still hasn’t spoken.
"Alright." Dean followed Castiel down the hall of bedrooms. Castiel's room was on the left and when Dean walked in he was shocked. Half his wall was glass like the rest of this side of the house. He had a twin bed and the same blue comforter he had back at college. The wall that wasn't glass was a floor to ceiling bookshelf. Filled to the brim with books from every genre imaginable.
Once last nip at his inner thigh and Castiel raised his head to meet Dean’s lips.
Comments are a huge motivator we absolutely LOVE feedback.
“Dean, I know you like those drinks, too. Get off your damn high horse and join the club.”
“Go deal with it,” He heard someone order with an English accent.  Snapping away from the conversation above him he heard the back door open and heavy footsteps smack against the concrete steps leading off the backdoor.
"Cas-” Dean stared at him “What?”
