Cas is pretty punctual, but Dean is sure
“Sit down, Dean.”
Dean puts a hand behind his head and then stares at the ceiling, smiling to himself which only succeeds in frustrating Cas all the more. “Yeah—your point?”
“I am Castiel.”
As long as he stays in this house with Bobby, things can make sense.
“I … uh …
And he’ll try not to let himself believe that any of that will change come Saturday afternoon.
” he grits, feeling his body turn to stone as the top of Castiel’s head sails down one of the rows and back out into the main walkway. Soon, he’s striding up to the desk with a single book in his hand. He smiles softly at Charlie, and then the smile tightens some when his eyes move over to Dean, proving that
. Dunno. I just …”
But there’s no answer, and even though he knew there wouldn’t be, Dean still expected one. He still expected that old man to come into this room, cussing at him to get off the floor and stop crying like a baby. And as long as he stays here, he’ll
“Oh … will you excuse me a moment?” he asks, but before Dean can answer, the shape he thought he saw in front of him, dissolves into a mist of color, flitting up through the air like cast off from a geyser.
“My uncle— he collapsed in the bathroom! He’s not breathing!”
“Oh, okay. Right—of course. Just
Bobby grumbles again but Dean can see the smile peeking out from behind that overgrown mustache. It makes
Dean smiles, loving how much is being said between their sentences. “Don’t worry. As long as that plane doesn’t crash, I’ll be fine.” His hands shake after he says it.
“Of course. Now … you should head on home. You need your rest.”
“Dean!” Cas’s voice sounds as if it’s echoing through a tin can, drowned out by a deafening
The girl rolls her eyes, but she steps in closer, eager to hear the rest.
If he were jealous, then that would imply that he and I were the ones in the relationship and he’d be worried about losing me to you.”
“I think you’re alright” Dean finally says, after scanning the other man, seeing if anything seemed out of place or injured. He’s watched Sammy take enough spills on these things to know the difference between

“Yeah, okay” Dean mumbles, still not looking away from his angel.
flowers, but I thought that these might do in a pinch.”
He grimaces but he doesn’t say anything else, he just opens up his desk drawer and pulls out the wad of cash that Castiel had given him only a few hours before, and then tosses it in Charlie's direction.

Dean can practically hear Bobby and Sam screaming “Go home!” but he feels even more determined now. He said he’d do this, and just like Castiel, he’s a man of his word.

. Reese McCanton was another model, always nipping at Sammy’s heels during every fashion show and photoshoot. If people actually do have arch nemesis in real life—Reeese would be Sam’s, at least ... he was in Dean’s opinion. Sam doesn’t really seem too bothered by the guy, but something about him rubs Dean the wrong way. He quickly looks over and sees Reese coming out from the crowd—apparently he had ducked past the barriers to go sign some autographs, judging by the sharpie in his hand.
Dean is shocked, but as soon as that wears off, he is doubling over laughing, wondering how the hell Casitel just managed to read the dynamic of the room so quickly. How did he know that childish humor is the best way to ease any tension in this family?
. “I don’t know, man …”
To his surprise, Castiel nods, eventually looking at him without another hint of anger. “I know you didn’t, Dean. But I can’t blame
He quickly tries to temper his rage, not wanting to accidently take it out on Melinda a second time. “Yes—yes, I’m fine. I just don’t understand
“Now—

Dean looks him over as he glides his hand up and down Cas’s side, and it’s obvious that he has felt the same way over the years.
—right.” Castiel clears his throat as he tries to recollect his seriousness. There was a lesson he was teaching here, right before his world got completely flipped over with the news that Dean Winchester, his old roommate, not to mention, the only man he has ever loved, still thinks about him enough to call his brother with updates. Not only
Melinda’s frown only deepens. “No, I’m sorry. I didn’t see who dropped it off, I just remember that it came in the day before yesterday.” She sighs. “I wish I could be more help.”
“You don’t need to take your pants off to be a whore” the old man spits, soon dumping the plate of sausage in front of Dean. He then heads back to the counter to grab a package of bagels, taking one out before splitting it and putting it into the toaster. “You still make me nervous every time you bolt away in that car. I never know what kinda mess  you’re gettin’ into.”
“I still don’t understand …

“I don’t want to fuck this up.”
Castiel nods. “Yes, metaphorically, you are.”
was the only
Tears instantly crested Lynn’s eyes, and before he knew it, the woman was around the other side of the counter and wrapping him in a hug.
Castiel laughs—a loud, booming laugh that shakes the earth and all the trees, causing him to cower and the birds to explode from the branches in a flurry of squawks and feathers.
The laughter tempers and a moment later, Dean watches as Castiel walks towards him—offering a hand up and such a genuine smile, it fills his belly more than food ever could. “I knew that this would help” Castiel says as he yanks Dean back to his feet; but once he’s there, the other man doesn’t let go of his hand. “I really
“Oh good! I’m really glad to hear that” and the warmth in his tone warms Dean to his toes, knowing that Castiel

“I have waited way
someone that! I think it violates some privacy law or something.”
“Why on earth would I want to quit?”
It took him by surprise at first, but the angel didn’t stop himself from matching every move that Dean made. Even though he’s a celestial being who’s supposed to be above all these carnal desires, the feeling of Dean’s warmth, his weight, his heart beating fast beneath his skin—it awakened that memory that Castiel pushed away long ago. He was human back then, back when April fooled him into her bed. He hated the reaper for toying with his vulnerability, but he loved the way her hands ran up the sides of his body. It was electric and toxic, and it felt dangerous and right all at once. He blames his humanity for loving it so much; but now, with his grace flowing safely within this vessel—
A slight tinge of pink graces Castiel’s cheeks, and he eventually shakes his head. “Well, actually—I think I’m talking more because … you make me a little nervous too.”
Dean’s face heats up, and guilt begins to roil in his stomach but he clears his throat to try and will it away. “
“How did you get out? I thought …”
to make him feel like himself again—
Castiel’s presence drifts closer, but Dean is too angry now too look up. “It is not within me to let things

someone would treat a book this way … especially a book that’s not theirs!”
Dean exhales, face frozen—eyes locked on Castiel, seeming as if he’s waiting for it to all fall apart. “I—I don’t know if I can do this again, Cas.”
Anyway, let's hope it won't be another year before the next chapter.  Heh ... sorry y'all. My life has been shit lately.
Eventually, she began asking what kind of books
“I don’t know, Sam!”
“Well, that seemed like an unfortunate encounter.”
Dean turns around and meets Castiel’s eyes, and they look even bluer now that they’re surrounded by yards and yards of blue matting. “Uh—I wrestled in high school, and I started boxing after that. Nothing
After another silent moment, Dean fell asleep and dreamed instead of their movie nights. He dreamed of the one time he taught Cas how to cook spaghetti. He dreamed of walking around Hot Topic as the guy looked for a birthday gift for Claire. He dreamed about the cases they worked together, and of the long nights they spent watching each other’s backs. He dreamed about how safe he always felt whenever Castiel was around. And—he dreamed of those eyes reflecting in the pristine silver of an angel blade; but then that blade was cutting into him—deep and treacherous, stabbing brutally through the bones in his hip. Dean jerks awake with a yelp.
The exchange of stories at the table was incredible. Castiel had never heard so much information about taking care of horses. As it happened, Uncle Bobby’s job is solely on breeding horses and Castiel learned that there are methods to it. He didn’t know about human-directed processes or the breeding of purebred horses until now. Dean’s uncle was talkative and shared almost everything about his business including how he thought Dean could work the same way while taking care of the family farm.
“It’s alright. I liked the smell.”
Driving the freeway of Texas as he followed a lead to the demon who’d been too clever to evade the angel for many months now, Castiel stopped in a gas station to ask for the nearest motel. He glanced around the nearly empty area, spotted an auto-repair shop that twisted something in his gut and burned something in his lips. Brushing the back of his right hand on his lips distractedly, he took his phone and called Sam again.
Come Saturday morning, Castiel and Dean meet up with Balthazar outside the livestock practicum room in their work uniform. The senior greeted them with an interesting look before leading them inside.
“Make sense. Dick Cartwright was working with a classified team from the CIA. We’re gonna have to dig deep on that. Contact anyone from the prison he’s kept in and have the perimeter check. This could just be another distraction and we don’t want a bunch of other criminals on the lose just because some big group wants their asset back!!”
“Stop it. I was so nervous my heart’s been thundering this whole time. I thought we got ourselves into trouble.”
Castiel steadied his hands. “Why would I do that?”
“I’m guessing it’s nothing to do with
“Look—this isn’t any of your business—" Dick started while trying to subdue the hostage the gun now hovering in her temple.
“Alright, fine.
“You look more interested in sleeping than sightseeing.” Castiel looked around then back at Dean becoming comfortable on the folding bed.
That Friday, all the teachers gathered the first-year students in front of the school with an announcement. Even the School Dean was there.
“But well, mom was there to remind him of things he shouldn’t be controlling in his sons’ lives. You know, mom always got a handle with the old man, and it’s lucky he’s got a soft spot for her. Anyway, you already know, as long as you can handle the family business, we’re good as married!”
“Besides, you’re in an agriculture school that gives life. What can go wrong?” Dean chuckled.
“So you’ll just… make me sleep?”
“What are you doing watching porn in the middle of the day?” Dean distracted himself even though he knew it wasn’t Castiel’s fault.
Castiel nodded. Knew silence had consumed too much time so it was a matter of time before Dean began his litany of blaming himself again. Castiel would help him through it so he stayed.
“What…!?”
“I did,” Dean gritted his teeth, “I slept for about ten minutes afterward and guess what? I fled the room like death was after me. Do you think she called after that? She was freaked out. Nobody wants to sleep with a guy who shrieks louder than a lady!”
“We were even rooting for you!”
Castiel shouted and boy was he so excited when they skipped waves after waves and Dean gripped the acceleration level because his angel was having fun.
Castiel turned off the shower and sighed. Moments ago, he was completely taken by Dean’s hand job, but that did not erase his guilt. Not only did he miss the work before the day was over, he also troubled Dean that ended with the two of them being unable to work on the farm. Though Dean did try to convince him it was nothing to worry about, Castiel’s responsible side was eating him up. He dried his hair with a towel and slipped on his loose shirt, wondering how he could make it up to Dean’s family. He opened the door of the bathroom to be greeted by the sweet aroma of grilled meat. The corner of his mouth easily watered. He found Dean by the kitchen stove, cooking their dinner wearing a plain white apron. Despite having those huge muscles and perfectly arched back, the apron suited him in Castiel’s eyes. Castiel watched him a moment before it hit him that this handsome guy was his boyfriend.
She pointed at the corner of the crumpled paper that was printed a barely visible part of the print could be seen. It was like a barcode the way it was appearing and disappearing on lines. Dean frowned and turned to Charlie, who clicked a few things on the screen.
“Dean’s not my boyfriend—and how could you—”
“Shut up.”
“Will this happen again?” he asked weakly.
“Yes, Lieutenant Novak Gabriel, sir,” Dean sucked his cheeks, earning him a glare from his blue-eyed boyfriend. Easy take it, he reminded himself still on duty.
“Shut up, do your job. That’s an order.” Dean slammed the car door shut after him and left the scene with all the sirens behind him. He checked his phone immediately and saw a text message from his roommate and replied fast. If he didn’t, he’d be bombarded with calls because that’s how they are. Adjusting himself on the chair, Dean Winchester drove out of the scene with a bad feeling of what’s to come up the following week.
Castiel didn’t ask, he pulled Dean in an embrace. It was what he wanted from the very beginning. The connection was set and Dean wrapped his arms under Cas’ elbow, trying to balance because he was still kneeling in front of the angel.
He glanced around and found Castiel standing with his back on the ocean, the glare of the sun flickering in his eyes and Dean cursed silently.
“That’s not my point!” Dean hissed, pulling really far this time and holding Castiel in an arms’ length, his grip still too tight. “I don’t know what I’d do if you get hurt! I—just thinking about it drives me crazy, I don’t know—
“Does it have a bunk bed?”
Dean shook his head now with both hands on his hips. Castiel waited for him to speak.
To keep hands on the chaos
“Hell, must be a subscription,” Dean palms his face, “We should check Jack’s programs too, put him in a crib. He’s not learning the pizzaman until he’s thirty.”
Last time we talk—two weeks ago—you still looked fine but now. “Are you still having problem sleeping?”
“I’m not popular at all,”
“No angel blade or you would’ve stabbed me. Unless that’s still not part of the plan?” His eyes flicker full black again. Castiel stared at him with every fiber in his body seething to attack, but no. It’s been months and months since he last saw Dean. He’s not going to screw this up like the number of times in the past.
“It’s not my fault, I wasn’t always present in middle school!”
Castiel held his shoulder.
"I forgot how a grumpy bastard you are."
Hearing the rumble of the man’s voice too close and not the one shouting in the background had him shifting on his feet.
"You're an idiot. Come here." Castiel pulled him for a morning kiss.
"Was it hard to be selfish for once, Cas?"
He just turned to another pig when Ham bit on his other leg.
Castiel returned Dean’s kiss with enthusiasm, wrapping strong arms around Dean’s neck. The hunter pressed their hips together and Castiel felt his raw bulge just growing and growing. Dean bit his earlobes next, making sure to rub hard against him, to make Castiel feel how he was so damn into him.
“Isn’t there? You guys have been flirting as far as I can recall on your first day of school.”
Castiel seemed pleased. The sun was out-shined.
“He’s taking care of the farm while mom and dad are away,” Dean pointed out, “But he’ll only be around for most days. Most of the time we will be left to fend off for ourselves.”
“You said you were in charge of him. Do you think rationally you still have to be in charge of his safety?”
“I’m right in front of you.” Castiel drilled holes in Dean’s face. He heard Dean’s sentiment, frankly he had the same thoughts especially after their steam vacation. He pressed his lips for if he didn’t, he might just drool at the memory. Was it really impossible to do it here? When his heart was fluttering.
“Move, Dean…” Castiel begged, it was the most debauched he’d seen the angel, dark hair all over the place of his head, body flushed with Dean’s mark all over him. That was right, these were the only marks allowed in the angel’s body. He fucked Castiel for a long time, basking inside the angel’s wet hole slipping in and out. He tore Castiel at the seventh round, never heard Castiel complain as he was in full control of his grace, reminding Dean once again why it was dangerous for them to change position because the angel was sure he’d destroy Dean and put him together again.
“H-Hey!”
“You kids…” Mr. Sergei didn’t seem angry anymore.
“He’s just nice, right?” Dean said. Castiel was too far away to hear them.
“The only suspicious thing here is why there are five doors when according to the floor plan there are supposedly only four rooms on the ground floor including the restrooms?”
“And smart as hell too,” Dean puffed out his chest, proud, “No one can beat him on memory exams and applications, just fair warning, you don’t make use of clowns as examples or you'll lose a very good man and make him cry."
“Okay. So, it’s settled. I’ll have you here again tomorrow, Dean.”
“Dean! Dean!” damn if Castiel’s deep rumbling voice didn’t make him hard, “
Unconsciously raising his left hand to shield his eyes, he tried to look at the blue sky but was blinded by the sun. Closing his eyes, he looked around the beach area to his left.
“Is that…?” Dean inhaled loudly, upon entrance on the door fifteen minutes after they arrived. Castiel let him in, enjoying how pleasing Dean looked in his black shirt and tight jeans.
“He never mentioned him having a twin at all?” Dean prodded on.
“W-wha-t?” Dean’s heating up face brought such warmth in Castiel that he smiled. Dean blinked at him and turned away.
“You’re a life savior,” he sighed as Dean chuckled. There was something mesmerizing about the way his hands secured his equipment back in the box.
After long arduous class hour, the usual team met up in front of the dorms to head to their last duties that day. Castiel found Dean by the corner and immediately went to his side. It was so natural, it didn’t feel like anything changed.
“So, Cas,” Dean gasped as he clutched Castiel’s shoulder for support, letting Castiel’s tongue to leave trails of kisses on his neck while his other hand tugged firmly on both their erections. “You— you gotta do me, okay?” his voice shook a little but it was enough for Castiel to stop.
Castiel was left hanging for his words when Dean moved to the sideline. So he has to do this jump first before Dean confesses? Was Dean confessing? Baby had stopped at the marker for those preparing for the jump and Castiel erased the thought in his mind. He needed to jump. He couldn't help glancing in Dean's directions, but doing so had Baby stomping on the ground. Castiel paused and inhaled. He needed to consider how sensitive horses could be, but thinking about it, he too was becoming more sensitive of Dean.
Bobby grumbles and starts to get red again, and Dean can practically feel Sam rolling his eyes beside him, but Susan’s bright smile and airy giggle makes it all worth it. “As lovely as that sounds, Dean—from what I hear, I’m not at all your type.”
“No—I’m just wondering why someone so
But the young woman seems even more hesitant now. “Oh, well … uh … he’s in suite three, sir. Magda should be just about finished with him. Is there a problem? Do you want me to go check for you?”
“I know.”
this cautious with his choices? It didn’t seem like it before, the way he just hopped from one hobby to the next. The way he can switch from one lover to the next … one sex to the next. Or maybe that’s all just Dean’s judgy perceptions rearing their ugly heads again. Maybe Castiel has

Castiel smiles too. Happy that this beautiful man still loves him—happy that he’s still here

Susan snorts. “Cathy sounds like a hussy.”
Dean can feel a presence lay down beside him—it’s singing with energy and weight; and as intimidating as it is to sense its closeness, there’s a warmth that is strangely inviting, so he stays still and keeps his eyes closed, just waiting for Castiel to explain what had happened, because there seems to be literally nothing else that Dean can do right now anyway.

Castiel doesn't seem too caught up on the specifics though because once Dean is finally finished muttering and turning cherry red, Castiel is already drifting off,  fading slightly around the edges while lost in thought. "I somehow knew that you were different than the others ... I could sense it. I just suppose I didn't know
Castiel tilts his head again. “Victoria’s Secret? Who is that and what is the secret?”
The woman beside him squeals loudly and clasps her hands together. “Oh ain’t my man a sight? Nothin’ like a good shave to make him prettier than a freshly picked petunia!”
, here’s three hundred. I am certain that will cover it, with some to spare. Now, if there’s nothing else …” He shoves the money at Dean’s chest and holds it there until Dean finally lifts his hand to take it.

, but it’s all about perspective.
Castiel feels his heart sink to his feet. He had finally worked up the courage to confront the man, but it seems like fate had another idea.
Dean is smiling again … even as Castiel walks out of the store and out of his sight completely, Dean is grinning ear to ear.
Charlie takes a step closer to him before resting her hand on his shoulder, and it makes Dean flinch because he thinks she’s going to smack him again; but instead, she just shakes her head. “Is that what’s actually got you so worked up? The fact that he’s bi?”
Dean blushes. “I think about you a lot, if I’m honest.”
Dean steps back to go pick up the book off the floor, happy that this is all so normal—almost as if the last two days never happened, and he’s so grateful for Charlie and her crazy perfect friendship that he can’t even be mad that the book now has dented corners. “I really am the luckiest guy in the world.”
Castiel’s eyes are wide. His heart is in his throat and he feels like he could both vomit and faint all at once. “I’m sorry” he rasps, still trying to whisper, but he barely has any breath left in his lungs. “I’m so, so sorry.” He quickly picks up one of the bottles and hands it to Magda before shuffling past her and bolting out the door.
“What?” Dean wonders, narrowing his gaze on the pale shock that’s now plaguing Castiel’s face.
… even though he has now clue what that even means right now.
is what he’s had in mind all along. He then lets go and sits back down, pulling Hank’s resume off the table to look it over. “So—you’re an army veteran?”
The response isn’t nearly as playful, and Cas sags a little with Dean’s tone, wondering if that was a dig at him
“Shuddup” Dean grunts, smiling despite his words. “That’s the guy’s name … the one who absolutely
Dean’s eyes are wide and his chest is heaving—lips parted as his tongue presses against the back of his teeth. He nods, but that isn’t enough for Castiel.
“No, no” Susan chuckles bashfully. “I lived in California for most of my life. I came from the bay area and worked in the San Francisco courthouse for a number of years.”
and it makes everything feel tenser.
Dean deflected the projectile and laughs. “I’m just being realistic!”
to save his life; but it’s too late now … Charlie is already looking in the bag.
“This is crazy, Dean. My agency has a company that they can hire from—I don’t know why you think
“Your quest will end in Vagina Town?” Dean grumbles—grimacing immediately after he said it because he’s obviously been hanging around this girl
Castiel looks at his phone. Claire’s text sets his insides on fire. It’s almost eight in the morning, and if Dean if any sort of creature of habit (which Cas recalls him being to some degree) then he should be getting ready to come in for some breakfast any minute now. Castiel types back
As he opens it—bracing himself on the adjoining wall, the scent of dust and Bobby’s soap float out in a gust to greet him. It smells like leather and hickory, but lighter somehow. Dean never knew where the man got it from, but his house carried the scent from corner to corner, because Bobby walked it corner to corner almost every single day. He was always moving, always

He wants to go back to the other night when they were both in this bed, holding onto to each other—naked skin pressed upon naked skin. Promises and compliments filling the sheets and fluffing the pillows. Dean should have never let Cas go that night.
I uh—I’m gonna be pretty busy tonight, remember?”
“You need to go to bed too, though. You aren’t gonna catch the guy who—”
But now Dean isn’t too flustered to respond—
. Her big, brown eyes were encased in dark lashes—that batted dramatically every time Castiel fell in her sights. Her voice instantly trilled when she asked him if he wanted a refill—and her voice slacked limp after Dean had told her that he would like one too.
“He’s
“I dated him, Sam. I knew he was off, but I dated him. I slept with him and called him, made plans and put myself in that position multiple times. I basically asked for—”
“Mmm” Castiel moans, deep in the back of his throat—and it’s the sexiest, dirtiest thing Dean has ever heard in his life. “And I like someone who’s willing to give themselves over to me.
No!” Castiel stammers, wondering how this conversation ever got this far. “No, he’s a guest. We are going to leave him alone, let him enjoy his stay and move on.”
—I have a lot of work to catch up on” which is true, considering he spent most of his night doing nothing of real worth at all.
With a nod, Dean pokes around at his plate—he’s not feeling very hungry anymore. His simple question, or,
, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to … uh … I just …
If he really wanted to get his mind off of things, he would’ve gone into work and tackled the long list of tasks that desperately needed to get done.
And even though he knows that this may not be the anniversary of the day he was created
Charlie carries on, “I know when the return bin gets really full at night, she’ll sometimes empty it out for us. She’ll stack the check-ins on my desk, and she sets the damaged ones on the stacks in the back for you. She probably didn’t know what else to do with a book like
Castiel watches, shocked as the man hammers the tip of the knife into the concrete, eventually chiseling out little sections—light but visible scratches in the form of letters, one after the other, until they begin to spell out Dean’s own name. "What are you—"
“What?” Castiel croaks, looking back at the girl now—giving her his full attention. “What are you talking about? Your dad and Dean never really spent time together, not without
The pickup truck came just in time. Ms. Barnes together with the other dairy farming group assigned to the pigpen all watched as the pigs marched towards it.
Dean finally met his eyes, surprised at all accounts but he didn’t pull his hand away. Castiel was glad he didn’t. Their time in heaven felt long and ample, yet too short at the same time. They never spoke about it aloud, but their souls understood better. Nevertheless, Castiel was still waiting to hear it. The angel still wanted to hear what Dean never said. Did it need saying?
Castiel inhaled. Dean’s eyes are on him, fixated and waiting but he’s learned never to trust demons, never.  Puffing his chest out in the process. He locked eyes with the demon and tried to see the same man he loved behind the green eyes. It was like staring at Dean’s soul with thick glass between them. A knot formed in his chest for Dean was too near, yet too far…
“Well, my underwear is white,” Cas said abruptly. Dean groaned.
The implication that they would still be together in the future plucked some strings in Castiel’s heart.
“Dean!” Castiel complained but seeing the twinkle in his green eyes had him thinking deeply. All his classmates were really from a farming family and yes, they’re all used to the idea of eating the livestock. But the way livestock sells depends on its quality and judging by Ham’s appearance— it really wouldn’t do good just as Dean said.
"Ow…" Dean muttered, and then looked up and then clutched on Castiel’s arm. “What happened to your cheek?”
“Dean, I have to explain that there is no reason to be uncomfortable. Acknowledging and sharing these personal experiences is part of the process of understanding what you are currently going through. Do you remember what you told me? That you will trust me, don’t you?” Dr. Novak tapped his pen on the clipboard, waiting. Dean chewed on his bottom lip at the duration of the silence and then finally heaved a sigh.
Castiel’s thoughts were immediately forgotten at the loud sound the pigs were making. Looking around, the pigs were all huddled by the railing looking restless.
“He’ll have a fit if I tell him that,” Dean laughed, shoulder shaking like the earth was rattling. But it certainly rattled Castiel the way how it too was a sight to see. He admitted to himself when he first saw Dean, he thought he was one of those people working in the economy class who hates everything in the world, including people. He noticed Dean staring so he looked away immediately.
“I don’t recommend getting out of this room.” Said the doctor but he didn’t stop Dean until the latter was standing by the door.
“What do you mean?”
Castiel didn’t look pleased at all and with sinking feeling, Dean felt he was not going to get anything tonight.
“Rush here?”
“I think it would suit you if it’s something you love,” he said softly, just watching. He felt more than feel when Dean’s body sagged and knew that Dean was sad. “Dean?”
Castiel quickly flashed a badge on his face. “Yes.”
"Because I said so," he squinted, "and because you're coming, right? Or we can't do this anymore."
“Like the finger snapping thing?”
“Do you mind if I buy one as well?” Balthazar asked, “I’ll pay.”
“You know I won’t give up on you.”
“No, I’m just worried you’d find this too boring.”
When was the last time he slept with someone? One look at the doctor though sent shivers on his body. He looked like someone who could break all the bones in his body. Dean swiped his tongue to wet his lips. This was ridiculous.
Dean rushed out of the room without any shoes. He was still wearing his pants and a clean buttoned shirt—a sign of zero productivity on last night’s romance. Events of last night flooded him. Dean wanted to choke himself to death. How could he do that? Remembering Castiel’s bare form sent him reeling and angry at himself that by the time he reached Castiel’s study, he was breathing hard and red as a rotten tomato. He bit his shaking lips when the doctor gazed around him and smiled, genuinely pleased at seeing Dean.
“What about the hole?”
Dean blinked. He zeroed on the angel and realized Cas is right. He was too tense and if he was going to be the angel’s role model, he might as well do it properly.
They stared at each other intently as if trying to decipher a code. But it was so nice to look at such a fine-looking guy that sitting with him up there could be an option.
“You noticed?”
“Not really. Dean and I thought it’s better to stick together. So maybe it only shows particular events that it could feel we needed to see?”
“I knew that.” Castiel said and embraced Dean tight with the blue wire snapped between them. Dean gathered his husband in his arms and fell back on his ass. The couple took a few moments before the other bomb squad appeared to clean up. Castiel gave them the remnants of the bomb to be sent to the disposal field and arm around each other, they left just as the helicopter flew away, bringing with it the turbulence in the air that covered both husband’s shaken hearts.
“You look like someone’s dad.”
“Make you wait for what?”
Castiel felt a stone drop inside his stomach. “What are you planning to do?”
“It’s better now. Suffice to say, I think I’ll just kiss you every time you knock me successfully. You are very pretty to look at and kissing you is a delight.” He leaned and captured Dean’s lips once again. It was a slow kiss and Dean didn’t wait for his brain. He kissed him back a little aggressively because he was sleep-deprived. Castiel didn’t seem to mind.
But when Castiel searched for his pockets, the key was nowhere to be found. He checked all his pockets, left and right before it occurred to him that it must’ve felt during the encounter with the Rit Zien.
Dean growled, claiming his lips for his own again. They resumed the dance, sliding and slicking each other tasting Castiel’s cum as their teeth clacked together in the sloppy kiss. Dean’s cock twitched inside Castiel as he began to move again. Cas wanted it deeper, doing so by rolling his hips to match Dean’s rhythm. He wanted more, he wanted it all, and clamped his waist around Dean to make escape impossible.
“Cas!” Dean stopped the horse right in front of the stall, he looked so happy and excited, “It’s my break time now—oh, I see you’ve sold all the pizzas. As expected.”
Castiel and April both said. They could both just see the relief on their teacher's face.
“Or we really don’t have time to fill around, not even by choice,” Dean shrugged. Castiel looked at everyone around him. These are all just college students, no—even when they were in high school, these people had been doing their best. Castiel thought students here are mostly concerned about their future because it's what they needed to do for their parents. Just like him. What made his situation different from anyone else?
“Bad idea. It’s going to become meat for sure.” Gavin said with a straight face. “We’re all used to it,”
“Are you going to tell me I have to talk about my father?”
Dean laughed out loud once they were back on the ground with adrenaline still rushing on his blood, his clothes are dripping wet like he just came out of the shower in full clothes. Hair dripping and sticking on his forehead like Castiel who looked so beautiful wet like that.
Dean spat out the coffee he just drank. He spent the next fifteen minutes pacing the room while on the phone with Sam. Castiel figured it could be ‘brother=brother’ that had Dean reeling in anger because no, no one was going to put his brother at risk for this shit! Worried, he spent time giving instructions to his brother to be careful, to be damn alert with anything he will receive as a package or letter while Sam spent the same time assuring Dean, he was fine. Castiel was the one who dressed Dean for their job, changing in his attire and enjoying suiting Dean up in his holster. Dean had the manners to wear his jacket, for it was snowing outside. Dean wasn’t a controlling type, but Sam was being stubborn and Cas was the one to pull him gently towards the doorway, check that nothing was wrong or attached to the vehicle before giving the signal that it was okay for them to drive their car to headquarters. The only thing that could distract Dean through the drive was Benny calling him for new information. He was part of Abaddon’s surveillance team.
“We have a problem, though,” Dean said, pointing at the mouth of the brick oven.
“Then we have to be a little early, right? Will you be here as well?”
“My hands?” Castiel looked down at his hands and indeed, noticed how calloused and hard they had become compared to when he just focused on studying.
“Geez, you forget even your commanding officer right here.”
"As long as they keep the screening on binoculars off limits of my bedroom," Dean added looking thoroughly serious. Castiel bit his lips in embarrassment while Gabriel took a while before he could remove his eyes from his brother.  “Alright. I’d call your brother in Washington if I were you, Dean.”
And no stranger could be stranger than the handyman, Dean Winchester. One thing was certain, tomorrow he’d put on his best clothes so as not to embarrass Dean anymore. The man did try his best to stop ogling down his body after all.
Castiel closed his eyes quietly, "Don't think too much about it. If I left someone like you in the middle of the street, someone who's about to die halfway, wouldn't be good for my peace of mind."
Castiel glanced at him, “What I do best. Talking. A little reverse psychology and I had them eating at my hands. But I was most worried about you. Especially when you had that attack…It must’ve been a trigger in the closed-space of the closet. I remember reading that on your file but I still forced you there. I am so sorry, Dean. Are you alright now, Dean?”
Castiel quietly tilted his head to focus his view of his groupmate.
"Im staying here.”
“How’s the driver?” it was Mr. Henricksen’s firm voice.
“To be precise, these groups collaborated together into fishing in victims through AdSense on many popular platforms. I believe they first spread false articles of people getting richer on the current market of cryptocurrency. That’s where the propaganda begins. Of false testimony from different people flashing on the screen of susceptible people. As what my sister informed me, she was watching videos on a popular site when this ad flashed and she clicked one link after another, unaware that she was feeding the scammers her profile and contact. They immediately got hold of her. The danger of a quick scam is they would make it appear urgent. My sister knew in her mind that once they asked for bank numbers, she would hang up. She did, but they called her back and believe it or not, hypnotism doesn’t only stop at the face-to-face contact. In the end she lost about 250 dollars before she snapped. She told me what happened and I took matters into my hands.”
“I wanted you to stop bringing me gifts not to offend you or—or show I’m not interested! It’s because I didn’t want to get used to it! You! The idea of somebody always caring about me! You know this is temporary, right? I’m already being a burden on you by asking for help. And I appreciate it, you being kind and I didn’t want to take advantage of that!”
His heart thumped fast. It does whenever Dean was around.
“Oh? But that rumor was about an improper sexual relationship that supposedly happened. It’s not allowed in the school policies so bear that in mind. Nothing’s happened yet in the case of you two, this is just a reminder. There was never anything in the manual that prohibits our students from being in a relationship. We just ask that you be proper in the school grounds, that’s all. You are college students; we don’t make decisions for you. You guys are legal adults who are here because of your priorities so if you break that then just face the consequences like adults.”
Cas demanded.
“It’s alright, I’m sure it’ll taste great.” Castiel headed to the cupboard to get the utensils and plate. He kept glancing at Dean, hoping to catch his eyes, but the man was too busy with his hands. There must be some guidelines on how these things happen between couples—then again do farm boys have the same pace as city boys? Because right now Castiel only wanted to stay close to Dean and maybe get a little naughty. The thought had him bowing his head. Maybe he was the only one thinking this fast?
“I spoke with them. Convinced them it would do them good to attack now and gave them an alternative to run away. They listened half way before my men got to them. It was easy after that. But I had to stall for time, especially with you. You were unconscious, I needed to make sure you were okay before dealing with anything else.”
There was silence in the other end. Then—
The world stopped revolving. Castiel hated that he loved Dean’s full attention and then another racket as his classmates spoke all at once.
“You certainly have a way with…mm—most people,” the handyman cleared his throat as he scratched the back of his head. Castiel noticed the man avoiding his gaze so he lowered his eyes, thinking. There was no reason to be hard on people who was only doing their job. Dean was actually really kind.
The snow had built up enough amount for shoveling on the hallway. In the middle of U-case house storages, following a lead on illegal chemical explosives kept by their detained suspect. The snow was heavy that time of the year and they were walking apart from each other. Castiel stopped just long enough to stare at the sky and then his husband.
Castiel could only be quiet.
Dean blinked at him then smirked.
“It’s okay. We’re gonna have a mock defense over land reform, but enough about that. Dean, you don’t look fine to me,” Sam didn’t look willing to let go of the topic yet. His younger brother shifted to his mother-hen tune and Dean had no choice but to palm his face. He couldn’t believe he was sweating so bad already by just setting up the laptop, “Is it still insomnia? Have you checked with your doctor yet?”
"Well, Sam and Eileen left an hour ago to check a case. They left a note on the library table for you so maybe..." his question hang in the air, biting his bottom lips, eyes fully interested in the angel's plush ones.
Dean shook his head quietly. There was a look of understanding deep in his green eyes. Castiel started.
“Yeah, you also realized we’ve done nothing here but clean the stalls since joining two days ago.” Kevin sighed while he dusted his gloved hands and raked his boots on the ground.
“Well, my dad will definitely throw a fit. You know, I have a younger brother who decided he wanted to live the city life for better education. My parents supported him; Sam is a smart boy.  And anyway, I was always meant to stay behind to take over the farm. Don’t get me wrong, I love our ranch, I love this life… it’s probably greediness to wish for more.”
"You don't get to complain. You're in my kitchen making me breakfast. Turn on will be every day for me." he replied drily, crossing to the other counter and staring up the cupboards dumbly. "I need coffee."
“Dean… Dean, you haven’t applied any suntan lotion…” he heard Castiel say. Dean sighed and mumbled something but he’s far too sleepy with his eyes heavy.
An unexpected call for help comes from who they already suspected.
“Dammit, Cas—”
“That’s why I said you are nice.”
“The subjects claim to have experienced discomforts at the idea of sleeping, the notion of being not in control of their surroundings. The genesis for others is something more traumatic in the past or any recent incident where your brain associates sleep
“Eat your potatoes, Inias. We personally harvested those this morning so it’s still fresh.”
They stopped at the pier near the jet ski rental station where a man with a white shirt tagged
“Why are you getting bigger still…?” he panted.
Castiel coughed. So, Dean was indeed thinking of marriage already. Dean was grinning the whole time he was caressing his back.
“Oh, I’ve always wanted to try this.” Dean rubbed his hands and nodded at the personnel. “We’re trying one. You want to, right? Unless you want to take the wheels?”
“You looked like you had a good sleep?” Sam asked, “There’s this firework display around seven in the evening, we should have our dinner before then.”
“Yeah, we get around a week’s break so we can also help in our family field. But some students stay too, like me, I’ll be staying to take care of the horses. In your case you can go home to your family so you don’t miss them.”
"Yeah? So how do you explain what's between us now? How do I look you in the eyes and tell myself I didn't abuse my friend?"
Dr. Novak stopped tapping his pen.
“The frustration has finally abated!” sighed most.
They bid Bobby goodbye and watched him drive out of the ranch, leaving the two of them standing by the yard. They looked at each other.
“Hello, Castiel… it seems like you two have been having fun.”
“Cats fit almost anywhere they can fit their head. They like to get into nooks and crannies and then gone like that before appearing where you least expect them to be.”
Ms. Barnes walked quietly towards them with arms crossed. She didn’t look as intimidating as before. She looked somber, as if carefully choosing her words. Yet Castiel didn’t feel like he was being judged.
“Do you really… do you really look at people like that, man?” Dean’s words came out a little high, it felt like he was nervous. Castiel was pulled from his stupor.
It took a few more considerable moments before Castiel was able to get near the locker and slowly open the locker. Something like wire popped beneath the metal door and Castiel slowly let go. Dean literally pulled him back again and wrapped arms around Castel’s waist.
"Yes," Dean's voice was serious, "Abaddon works for him as secretary. A bad love triangle for high-profile double agents who have access to military sources.”
“Is your requirement in the S.W.A.T being devastatingly handsome?” she wanted to know and judging by the glow on her face, Dean suspected his husband had scored another one. Who could blame the female folk when Cas looked like that?
Dr. Novak dismissed him, “It’s but a cut lip. It will heal. How are you feeling?”
Dr. Novak stared keenly at him behind indifferent blue eyes. “I wasn’t going to offer it.” He stated calmly.
"Oh it was me, I coaxed you into it."
“Thank you!”
But he did.
“You are allergic to cats; does that make you want to harm them?”
“I’m sorry about this morning.” Castiel said before he could stop himself. Dean who was on his way to the kitchen glanced in his direction, “I haven’t had coffee. I didn’t know it was that bad.”
“Huh?”
“I don’t see a problem with it, I mean you call me Cas.”
“I’ll be back really quickly,” he said and left the stable to look for the spot. To say he was good with direction was an anomaly. Castiel was just reminded of his first day of walking around the school when he found himself in the middle of nowhere. He looked around him but all he saw were trees. The road had completely disappeared from view and was now replaced with thick bushes. Crickets sang around. Sharp eyes seemed to observe him from behind trees. There’s a breeze in the wind that sent chills on his spine. Castiel paused. Shadow had completely crept in his surroundings before he noticed it with the darkened sky swallowing everything up the sky. And still, no farm tower. From his view, the shadow of the mountain looked ominous. Castiel swallowed hard.
“Cas?”
“It’s Castiel.” The accountant muttered under his breath to which Dean raised an eyebrow. Mrs. Butter’s eyes fell on him.
"Stop moving, Dean!" Castiel growled as he pulled Dean into safety. He set him down as the S.W.A.T team surrounded them, one got Abaddon and escorted her to the entrance. Gabriel asking for reports to which other officers up there willingly give but it wasn’t over. Dean was still wrapped in the bomb jacket.
“I’d take you with a tiger on your leash. I like you a lot. Love you.” Castiel turned redder than a tomato. It wasn’t good—Dean was getting bigger again so kissing Dean tenderly and biting his jaw, Castiel surrendered to his fate.
“You still think I can regain my grace…?” Castiel asked in disbelief. Dean gazed at him warmly and nodded.
“You’re mad. And stupid,” Dean injected as Jack beams.
“Modern barn house, it’s a thing.” Dean said proudly, “Four rooms with magic fingers, one living room and kitchen, it’s— expensive. Worth the vacation. Hawaiian shirts?”
Castiel’s eyes gleamed as he unbuckled his belt. Dean was left on the bed to watch, breathing heavily with his own pants getting tighter. Castiel shed his clothes and knelt on the bed, holding Dean’s knees and kissing his right kneecap.
Castiel frowned. “There isn’t anyone…”
“Bring the towels and wear the flip-flops, you don’t want to return here with sandy feet, walk back out the sand and back here again just to get little stuff so better carry a bag or something. Sam? Where are you it’s past lunch!” Dean groaned because Samantha was nowhere in the living room which means he’s either fixing his hair or talking to Eileen which left him giving instructions in the air knowing that their celestial companion would hear him.
“I’d make a full 380 and make a show just to see that look in your face. I’ve thought about it carefully. You can’t harm me, not with the mark on. So what else is left? You give yourself to me, you’re my demon cake and I want it.”
There was a roar and applause that had Castiel blinking. His classmates all looked relieved and excited at the same time. What atmosphere is this? From what he knows, people tend to be cruel and prying when it comes to this sort of calling out. Seeing everyone clap their hands and return thumbs up to Dean, all genuinely happy for them was…
Castiel gave her a tiny nod and smiled before heading out, finally ready to face Dean again. The sight of the impala tugged something in his heart, the sight of Dean waving and smiling at him pulled something in his soul and he wondered…
Dean squirmed on his lap. “It’s not that. But you know I’ve been really trying hard not to touch you deliberately, because you know being in heaven and being with a physical body is a little different… I mean, in heaven we’re all pure and love and all that stuff, but here on earth it’s all gotta be—y'know? When you touch another man and uh—it’s all physical and—”
“Aren’t we going with them?” Castiel knew he didn’t need to ask, but in case Dean wanted to go. The hunter grabbed the bottle of beer but didn’t drink.
He raised the demon higher who remained impassive except the malignant twinkle in his dark eyes.
“Well, your manfriend has refused to let it call that, we’re lovers and that’s our label. I was specific our relationship is not based on fucking, okay? It just comes as an additional bonus. Well, it’s a very special bonus, the cherry on top.” He sniggered while Castiel rolled his eyes. “We both know it’s working; you haven’t had the urgency to hurt and smite the life out of me, right?”
“Technically I am. I have Claire. And Jack.”
One particular night, Dean was sure the hypnotism wasn’t strong enough to contain whatever was clawing like spider from his chest. He knew he was in a bedroom. He knew he was going to die. He opened his eyes in a state of delirium like being stuck in a dream and reality, but it was with blazing fire and filled with screams. His heart would surely burst. He fought his way up over something he couldn’t see. His nerves were boiling, his skin was stretching. There was a lump stuck in his throat and a wall, pressing down his chest. He had to get out of there, his instincts told him.
“Now those words just sounded so wrong— I’m—I’m no gigolo!”
“It’s fine, let’s get to class.” He said but there’s an extra light step in his footstep. The afternoon class was pure hell but with Dean watching over his back, Castiel realized there might be something to really look forward to in his days in this school.
In which it was a choice...
“But you did.” Castiel followed Dean with his eyes, not wanting to get on his way but he had this urgency to help the handyman in picking up his toolbox too, “I won’t apologize for the job well done but it seemed to have hurt your ego somehow.”
“Really? Why is he calling you ‘Cassie’ in such a familiar fashion?”
“I’ll hold on for both of us.” Said a third voice.
“I am. With this.” Dean glanced in his direction and winked, “Feel safe already?”
Castiel didn't let go of his back, his nails digging deep on Dean's skin. Castiel gasped.
“Dean. I want to help you, but you gotta talk to me, man. I want to help.”
But what if he threw everything away, routine included?
Castiel didn’t answer.
“Is it her?”
“It’s because you guys were also incredible with what you do,” Castiel thanked the Food Science student.
“You have to be more specific.”
“Yes.” Castiel replied, a little defiant. He could see the thoughts clearly forming in the handsome guy’s face, it was obvious he thought it ridiculous. Castiel was ready to defend himself when the guy beamed so suddenly that caught him off-guard.
For all Dean’s posturing in the beginning, Sam was seriously beginning to feel for him.  Cas had been awestruck and mostly silent, only once asking quietly, “Why me?”, for which Sam had no answer.  Gabe, however…was in full Gabe mode.
*****
“I was first assigned to Castiel about 20 years ago.” He met Cas’ eyes with understanding.
“Who are you?” Cas asked breathily, one hand gripping the tome he hadn’t dropped and the other on Gabe’s wrist where his older brother’s hand was gripped tightly onto his pajama top.
Right on time, Gabriel came out from the kitchen, wiping his hands on a dishrag that he tossed over his shoulder.  He grabbed a bottled water from the beverage case, bringing it over to Cas with a smile.  Their brother was working the register and just waved as the youngest turned to leave.  The blonde patted him on the back with an anxious look, nearly flinching as Sam sighed at the thought of his charge being on the move with so many dangerous things between the bakery and the college campus.  Gabe looked around, still not seeing anything, but the room suddenly felt a little cooler once his brother was out on the sidewalk and headed towards the campus several blocks away.
He grimaced even before he stuck his foot into the young man’s path, causing him to trip, falling forward onto his hands and knees.  The book he’d been carrying skittered off the edge of the curb and when the dark-haired young man had sucked in a quick breath, it had been more for the book laying just on the road, than for his own skinned hands and knees.
“Rather than killed and somehow came back to life miraculously?”  Dean side-eyed him with a smile.
“You couldn’t handle all my angelic beauty flitting around you all day.  I prefer to wrap you in bubble wrap.”  The dark-haired man glared as he took the book from his hand, but the blonde brother merely smiled broadly.  “Either way, put the book away until we get to the bakery or Michael will fuss once he realizes it was the reading without caution of your surroundings and forbids you any books for a week.”  Cas sighed then, looking a bit sheepish.  He twisted to push the book into his backpack, before dusting off his hands and knees, wincing at the slight scrapes.  Gabe threw an arm over the taller brother’s shoulders and took over guard duty as they finished crossing the street.
So, he just stared.
“Dean,” the natural smile that reached his lips every time Dean was around was scary.
“I like that smell after a day’s work. Well, I’m here for work too so, let’s get straight to it.”
But Castiel had no come back for them. Ham had just been led to the truck too, and the way he wanted to reach for him, just to show any sign of fear or betrayal—it didn’t come. Ham strolled past him like any other pig and the cage was shut.
"S-shut up!"
“I figured. The coat was a dead give away. I hope it’s not linked to murders in the last town? It was brutal.”
Dean couldn’t pinpoint the exact time he became mellow with each other until they were called in an emergency bomb threat. He and Castiel were driving downtown when the radio came. A box was left in the middle of a children’s park by a suspicious looking fellow caught in the street camera.
The door opened and Dean cried in relief. Castiel entered the room, followed by Gabriel. Both brothers were looking very severe but Dean didn’t wait. He sat straight and swallowed hard, gritted his teeth and flashed them a livid look.
“Yes, you’re right. But the way it feels now, it’s like it’s a reminder that… I don’t know. You’ve lived in the Bunker longer. I’m not talking of ghosts, of course. But the memories here, they’re not just ghosts. They're us. The Bunker has kept it all to itself all these times. It really is our home.”
The brick oven was large enough to have six pizzas at the same time. The clock ticked by, and so, they waited.
“Wow…and you still think he’s not bad after calling him a demon?” the surprised brown eyes had Castiel squinting but before he could say anything else, someone jerked the hand away from his back. Castiel turned and there was the man he was looking for, clad in his favorite red shirt, green eyes glinting in secret spite, twisting the gasping man’s arm up the air.
The man gaped at him again.
Dean was contemplating when a beach ball rolled on his side.
“What?” Castiel turned to Dean so fast, it was a good thing he was holding on to the harness tight. Dean stared at him again as if he wanted to say something but backed down. It bothered Castiel again, "Dean, do you want to tell me something?"
Amara nodded, running her long slender finger on the Mark. Castiel felt the thrill of her touch, felt the Mark react until Amara tapped on to it and the burning stopped.
“You brute,” Castiel sighed. Then he did the best thing he could at that moment, he grabbed Dean’s wrist and pulled him gently. Dean followed without much of an objection.
“Well, aren’t you the same Mr. Winchester doing all the labor work for his husband? May I remind you I’m a part-time worker here? I need to do my side of the job.”
“Yes.” Dr. Novak said with a straight face. “And you will honor that bargain in the end.”
Dean’s eyes gleamed.
Castiel dropped his gaze on the ground. That was why Dean was good at his job as an agent and hunter. He always knows the right questions. Briefly, Castiel told him of the ‘thing that makes Castiel happy’ in vague details. Dean’s face screwed in confusion, even more as he asked follow-up questions about why it had to do with him until Castiel was practically confessing to him.
“Who’s that?”
Said a deep voice in thick accent. Dean licked his lips.
“Damn, Cas. You’re making me feel like a horny teenager.”
“Stop that,” he said through gritted teeth.
“Fear of dying? It’s normal. But getting seized by it to the point of exhaustion isn’t healthy. Where is your brother now?”
“I got you,” Castiel said, sliding on his side, mouths not leaving Dean’s lips, “I got you Dean.”
Confused but glad Dean wasn’t casting him out, Castiel followed their adviser to the Guidance Office. That’s where he found the sophomore, April, also there. They exchanged glances and then waited for the verdict.
“Of course, he is,” Dean responded at once with a slide of arm around Castiel’s neck, “Cas is already studying a storm for the success of this pizza picnic! He’s basically our pizza-man so don’t start doubting him now!”
“We already have a lot of that from your brother, thank you very much!”
He had just picked his fifth egg when he noticed Gavin moving swiftly on the other lane. Dean was assigned with egg cleaning so Cas couldn’t talk to him. But now that he looked at others, he stopped long enough to witness the boy do his task with what seemed like a rhythm, a flow in the tide without struggle. It struck him how cool it looked. “Wow, you sure are fast.”
“Thank you. But it is a fact, your sleep dread can be cured through coping therapy. Cognitive therapy will commence from this day, exposing you to mechanisms and practices that will gradually help you ease your way until your body can find its natural clock for sleep without hypnotism.”
“Mmm, technically yeah. Why?”
“Yes, that’s part of your part description, isn’t it? I can’t drill holes in my ceiling, I’ve been told it would be a disaster,” Castiel tried to be patient. He’s been on the phone trying to make appointments with handyman services while trying to audit taxation payments and prepare reports for his clients. It was just after break time after he was advised by a co-worker to call a handyman instead of a contractor to deal with a simple fixture without having his whole house collapse. Castiel pursed his lips. For the life of him, he couldn’t live in the house for another day. He was both thinking of hiring a contractor and spend time at his brother’s house if he couldn’t find anyone to do it this day.
Castiel raised his eyebrows to heaven. He left Dean to answer a call after that. It was one of his clients and had to be in front of his computer for a few minutes. When he returned in the living room, Dean was nowhere to be seen. The next thing he knew, someone was hammering lightly on his wall. Castiel checked him out from the window to find Dean touching the wall from the side garden.
Growling to himself as he carried his suitcase down the living room to find his trench coat, he was deeply considering contacting his realtor when the smell hit him again. This week bode to be a disaster, he told himself. Placating his nose as he pressed a handkerchief on it, he went to the kitchen to grab a glass of water. That’s where his eyes stung, it nearly made him cry. He spent a few more futile minutes searching for the foul source until it dawned on him that the smell was nowhere his blue eyes could see, or even his brain fathom. But it was there, lingering and haunting to remain.
“Yeah,” Dean said, pushing his own shirt up to his shoulder, revealing the luscious torso with its packed abs and pectorals that Castiel had always secretly admired. Castiel gulped as he sat up to meet Dean’s body and planted a swift kiss on Dean’s throat, right at the joint between the neck and shoulder. Dean gasped and Castiel wondered if he was that sensitive. He felt Dean’s body shivered at his touch with his fingertips tracing the lines of his chest. Castiel couldn’t help it. His mouth trailed lower, grazing over Dean’s right nipple and sucking on the bud avidly.
“Settle down with what, we’re all in the Bunker.”
Another silence. Even Dean’s hold on his hand was slightly tightened.
“Yeah, because I like it that way.”
Flashes of light. Explosions left and right. His ears were robbed off their senses, his body numb from all the blood loss. He couldn’t breathe. And just like that, he was back in the field and fighting to survive while everything around him exploded. He hated it there.
“I thought he’s a professional?” Castiel muttered more to himself. He heard the Bobby clicked his tongue.
“No, not ‘we’. I have to remove the ceiling one by one, but you’re welcome to watch me in action, I can tell you I’m a sight to look at.” Castiel couldn’t see his face, but he’s sure Dean was smiling. “Anyway, we just gotta get the sheet here if necessary, make use of your head—”
for a plumber, I had to see how it ended.”
“Before you cry wolf on harassment let me rectify. Let’s try not to have any ideas, Dean. This is an office concerned of employees. I run a very tight ship. Not that you came here with pure sunshine on your step but you were alive in the least. Right now, you could barely carry your feet. Not to pry, I’m judging the hollow of your eyes. Windows to the soul. So can you tell me why you seemed like you lack some good night's sleep? And I don’t mean in any sexual way unless you’re doing a succubus, I won’t judge.”
Dean saw the meaningful twinkle behind the doctor’s eyes. It took him a moment to realize what the dinner meant before he went red in the face. It was a celebration because he was cured, right? That he could now stay in bed…? On his own or perhaps with someone—
Castiel held him fast. "Of course, it only needed one joining of the body, but... you were persistent. Did you notice how you're more susceptible to follow my command?"
“Shut up, asshole.”
“What?”
“14 blown up storages, a hundred dollars property damage and no Cartwright on sight.” Gabriel shook his head. Dean paused for a second, then shook his head.
“Cas,” Dean shifted on the bed to get neat to the doctor, “Stop looking so guilty over me. It’s not like you were the reason I had this to begin with. What you did to me, all your help—that helped me through it, okay? Even now when I think about it, it doesn’t seem that daunting anymore…. Because I’m not alone there in the closet, right? You were there for me, I remember feeling the need to protect you last night too, I clung to you! Because I feel that you would disappear. I think that is my greatest fear… you… going away again. Don’t do that!”
“Could be. That’s your problem, yeah?”
And Dean?
“You’re just… going to sit here?”
Dean pressed against him, lips becoming more insistent and hungrier. When he half-opened his lids, Castiel saw Dean’s freckles a bit redder than its normal color. His thoughts snapped to the movement around his waist where Dean had planted both his hands on his hips as he eagerly angled their bodies for a better kiss. Dean’s tongue slipped in the lines of his teeth, the taste of salt and sauce pleasantly invading Castiel’s senses. He was losing his breath; Dean didn’t want to part too soon. It was Castiel who pressed a hand on Dean’s chest to break them apart, his face flushed, his body warm and eyes full of that green-eyed freckled boy who looked ready to pounce on him.
Up until they came into the room where the atmosphere quickly turned tense as all the eyes of their classmates fell on them. Dean smirked and headed to his chair without care while Castiel was stuck shooting daggers towards Gavin.
Dean was in a trance while sharing a story to the angel—the kind of which made his eyes twinkle like starlight, his cheeks glow like the rim of the full moon, and his words to come out like fountain of life, giggling animatedly at parts he found full of hilarity. And as always, Castiel was there admiring the view. It didn’t matter much the story, it mattered how Dean was so animated and happy telling it and Castiel can spend an eternity just listening to Dean.
Dr. Novak’s gaze could burn holes in his head. “Did you have a good childhood?”
The clock struck midnight. It was the same agony. His body resisted the bedroom, his brain rejected sleep. He was on the last hairline treading from being awake to completely dead. It didn’t do well that the nightmares were becoming more vivid. The only consoling thought he had to pass through the night was that the next morning he would do everything to find Dr. Novak. He would get him to help even if he had to threaten the guy. This seemed to comfort his brain because through the blurry images created by his hazy mind, he imagined the handsome doctor reaching out to him in the darkness.
“Alright, make sure you help out, Inias.” Gadreel crossed his arms, “Castiel’s already tutoring someone from class and now he’s helping out at other people’s expense. He’s sure a busy guy.”
“You certainly have a good guardian,”
“He’s still noisy even without his form. I can’t believe he’s still up to putting miseries to the last drop of his hat. He’s unbelievable. But you never answered my question, Castiel.  I told you I’m here because of Dean’s request—”
“Did you see those cats?”
Dean shut his lips. Sam said this guy was openly bisexual...like him.
“You call your horse ‘Baby’?” Castiel asked in awe.
“Dean, I gotta know what your doctor’s been saying. C’mon, Dean.”
“You’ve become really good at it,”
“You have a bad posture, Castiel, straighten your back,” Mr. Sergei said from the other side of the horse. Castiel held on to the bridle so tight it hurt his palms, “Straighter!”
Dean laughed, soft green of his eyes warm on Castiel’s. “Yeah, that’s a really loaded name. If we become friends, I’d call you Cassie. Or Cas.”
“If it’s left in the dumpsite, I guess no one wants it anymore, right?” Dean leaned closer to Castiel’s space, “Wanna look what it can do, Cas?”
“Any drinks?” asked the bartender above the clatter of bottles and glasses while Castiel swung his leg over a stool by the counter with active eyes in his surroundings. The crowded local bar stood up to its reputation, dim light flickering above heads, people brushing shoulders and the pungent scent of beer. He had to tug the hem of his coat to get out of people’s heels.
"I do."
“It’s not for a case, I suppose?” Cas said drily, “Your obsession for loincloth is beginning to alarm me, Dean.”
“Dean!” Sam’s voice was loud it hurt.
like I could die. My body—I can’t control it. I start to panic, it’s like my own body wants to jump out of my skin. My heartbeat gets faster, my breath gets short and fast, it’s like I’m being attacked from the inside. In the morning I’m disoriented, I’m tired but even if I try to sleep it’s short and interrupted by my heart beating out of my chest. I really can’t explain it, Sam. But that’s how it’s been like…”
“Oh uh… I was just distracted… it’s the beach… people are… distracting.” He stayed his eyes firmly on the angel’s shoulder. How firm they look running to his collarbones. Biting his lips because he’s been memorizing all the inches of the angel’s nakedness before it disappeared under the thick linens of his coat again.
Castiel stopped breathing. Dean had stopped moving. He met Dean's eyes, they were too clear of dismay.
“Really? So, students get a break every season? I read about that on the pamphlet. Students can also stay in the dormitory during the breaks.”
“Letting an angel fuck me over, this is grand sin.”
“Why don’t you try the Equestrian club?” Dean grinned, “Working with horses is gonna turn out more of a hobby than a duty for you, I bet?”
“Yes.”
“No, but usually when there is a cheese-making room like this it means cheese caves close by.”
Frying pan clinked and sizzled on the stove. The kitchen smelled good with Dean’s special scrambled eggs and bacon filling the air. He danced in front of the stove wearing his robes while Castiel sat by the counter, wearing a decent white shirt and boxers as the bomb squad officer examined the new evidence including the photos of the two notes that came from the threats. The husband had emphasized so many times to Dean that he didn’t like the given clues.
(See the end of the chapter for
The silence was terrifying, but then—
“Am I?” he growled, deep voice an octave lower with power held at bay. Dean smirked. His eyes swirls from dark to emerald, leaving Castiel breathless as it remained the latter.
Once again Dean was afraid and Castiel was afraid for him. The car’s atmosphere turned from tensed to dread. Once back in the comforting walls of the Bunker and the four sat at the round war table, Sam told them of the different endings that Chuck showed, all leading to the demise of the brothers. It was a tragedy from beginning to end, starting with Castiel receiving the Mark. Everything falls from there, he said. The Mark’s effect certainly did not exclude an angel, if not it made it more potent being a celestial being. It was like unleashing a mythical beast in the world that something the bible once foretold. No one could stop him, and when it came to goodbye; it broke Dean. Castiel, the angel that he was, felt all his grace left his vessel at the image of Dean burying him in the Ma’lak box and then barely living the remainders of his life before he too was taken. That shook Castiel more than he cared to admit—no, it devastated him. It was never the ending he pictured Dean’s life would be. He wanted to believe Dean could be happy living a peaceful life with a wife and child once this was all over. He imagined him happy, at least. He deserved it more than anyone, someone so selfless and pure—to find out the Mark also sealed away Dean’s happy ending, Castiel was weakened. He found himself asking the point of everything, why they needed to anger god, why it always ended with Dean suffering? Then Castiel realized something.
“Not my preference, but I can live with it.” He thought he could even marry it. When the pizzaman lingered on the door, Castiel blinked at him. “You can keep the change.”
“Y-yeah, but—really?” Dean’s breath was once again robbed when the doctor gave him a soft look. “T-then I’ll call you Cas!”
Castiel worked on the wires, trying to connect which of the three colors to choose from when Dean touched his hand. Gadreel and Aaron finally made it to them to report, but it was brief. Gabriel also made a call to make the cleanup of both buildings saying he’d leave things in Castiel’s hands. Five minutes to show time, Castiel asked the Alpha team to move back. They didn’t budge away and remained to wait. Castiel did not say anything. Clip at hand, he could just choose any of the wires. One could kill them all.
“Yes.” Castiel felt that twinge of nostalgia again, and that sweet ache in his heart. How could he long for someone who was just sitting behind him? This person who helped him have a new way to look at life? This important person was kind enough to look his way and found him. “Dean… what would you say if I return to home now?”
“I didn’t really anticipate that there’d be a second call—"
“Must be nerves killing him, it’s the first time he and Eileen will have a true date,” Dean smirked. “Anyway, were you looking for me?”
"You're one to talk," Castiel glanced down between them, but Dean pressed him down the bed
“I’m… yeah. I knew this was going to happen when I watched it, but it still got me. Those butchers know the anatomy of the pigs in and out so they were very precise with their methods. If I can’t get over this then I have no chance of becoming a vet.”
He stared at Dean for a long while, still demonic and full of lust. He can do something with that. He didn’t dare think why Dean’s body was calling for him, but he trusted it’s the profound bond. Dean whimpered and leaned to catch his lips. Castiel leaned down and gave him what he wanted, feeling the demon’s body vibrate beneath him.
"YOU IDIOT, CASTIEL! THAT WAS DANGEROUS! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!? WHAT IF THAT BULLET REALLY GOT YOU—WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN! YOU IDIOT, AND YOU'RE ALREADY THIS MESSED UP!"
“How did you find out you’re allergic to cats?”
“I’m not sure that is a compliment,” Castiel airily laughed, nudging Dean with his ankle, “you are comparing me to your other fuck?”
Dean could die. “C-Cas, better be careful of your wording, man…”
He certainly just did.
“You want
Dean blinked at him and breathed on his lips, "We might start a rumor,"
“No walking on the seafloor, Cas,” Dean shook his head.
“Nah, only one. He’s riding me.” Dean pressed his lips. The man arched an eyebrow at him, turned a full look at Castiel before smirking.
Castiel closed the trash bag he was holding, secured it on a clear spot near the road where the dump truck could take it before opening another one and picking up the small litters. By and by he was able to carry the heavy ones to the side of the road too and clear at least half of the area before he noticed something behind an empty cabinet. Pushing it aside, Castiel blinked at a stone like chimney built like a tombstone in the middle of nowhere. There was no way anyone could have carried it there. It had to be built on the same spot for a reason.
But there was no Sam or Eileen or Jack in the barn house as they entered. The sun was almost set behind them, their shadows tall on the floor as Castiel locked the door behind him.
“I’ll keep that in mind, thank you,” he settled behind the man’s back. The guy was broad. “I’m sorry, what’s your name again?”
Dean didn’t know it was this bad. The moment he heard from his doctor that it wasn’t just insomnia that was ailing him, he thought he could still breeze through it. Truthfully, he didn’t even manage after six months. He let go of his job in Bobby’s shop because his hands wouldn’t stop shaking enough to connect one wire to another. Bobby said he didn’t need to quit but Dean didn’t want to be a burden. He stopped the delivery job because he could no longer drive without his vision-impairing at the color of lights. The illness had taken over his life so fast before he could even have the time to process it.
Castiel remained silent. Dean wanted to punch him, his fist itched to connect but then-
“I figured it was something like that,” Dean said as they walked together in the hallway towards their classroom, “why were you thinking of expulsion already?”
“Well, there’s that too.”
“Wow! This is delicious! Like there are no additives in it!” Dean grabbed Castiel’s hand and indulged himself in eating the rest of the drumstick. Castiel silently let him. It was a heart-pounding moment of Dean being an inch closer. From the closed space, he could even start counting the freckles on Dean’s face. There were plenty like stardust in the night sky.
“Is it doing good?”
With his erection burning wet inside Dean’s ass, he pistoned his aching cock into Dean with electric shocks dancing in his vessel. It pulsed right to Dean who thrashed in his arms at the frightening pleasure until both thought they could not last much longer.
Castiel clutched on Dean’s shirt tightly and whispered, “Thank you.” It was the most comforting words he has heard in his life.
"Don't do anything funny or I’ll blow you up!" Roman said with eyes on him.
“I’ll smite you from that body.”
Dean entered him slowly, it was like being speared by the sun. Castiel bit his bottom lip as Dean pushed in slowly, both breathing heavily with eyes locking. Dean was big and he was getting bigger as he thrusted in. It was so pleasurable, so euphoric when Dean pulled and shoved inside him again. Castiel cried each thrust with Dean falling forward and wrapping him in his arms as he rolled his hips, backed out and hit that spot. It took one final push until Castiel, full from Dean’s cock, tightened the muscles and Dean swore before moving.
came to attend to them.
“It’s alright, you got me,” Dean grinned but the concern in his ocean green didn’t disappear, “Wait—did you infiltrate after us on your own? And you got shot—!?”
Fear gripped Castiel’s heart and for a moment he wanted to rush on Dean’s side. But with all eyes on him, things happen. It was Abaddon that made the first move and tackled Roman from behind. They wrestled until both were precariously standing at the edge of the building. Dean growled and moved, there were more shouts. Castiel was running to Dean who joined the fray. The number of times Castiel’s life flashed before him as he saw Dean tipping to the side of the building—he was completely terrified when Dean Abaddon back— Roman lost his balance and clutched on the bomb vest—
“You survive.” Breathed Dean with newly found interest that got Castiel to be wary.
Castiel wished anyone had warned him that tonight he would be meeting the most gorgeous man in the planet. To stand in front of the stunning handyman with nothing but his jogging pants and shoulder towel, Castiel was left speechless. Between the sweaty cheeks, a lump of pretty red lips and the greenest eyes that light ever had the opportunity to touch, he was breathless. He just had to admit to himself this was the most beautiful man he’d laid his eyes on.
Sam patted his shoulders. "You did everything right...but making a demon be under your command, the stakes are high. And dangerous. We can only trust that. I finished the ritual... my blood in his system too, and with your grace? We just have to wait..."
Dean’s hand slipped a little lower, cupping a feel to the bulge already twitching in interest. Castiel squirmed and pushed back a little to Dean’s own erection. He suppressed the urge to touch Dean too and instead let Dean rub on the cheek of his ass. The sound of fabric and his own shallow breathing filled Castiel, finally opened his eyes. “Dean.”
Castiel smiled at him.
Dean's jaw dropped. That was one thing he will never forget. "W-what are you saying? I'm not-"
Until the thunderous sound of screams and flashing lights startled him so much, he had to back away. The crowd moved like haze and he was the dust carried off his feet. The reporters jostled and bustled like armies in war. Dean realized the crowd was charging in and at the epicenter of it was a man in an aqua suit. Doctor Castiel Novak was tall and well built, he also looked displeased as his guards paved the way to his car amidst the crowd. Dean called for him like everyone else. He saw nothing but the flash of lights and the doctor’s head. The crowd pushed him forward until Dean felt himself sinking. His knees buckled at the strain and force that he collapsed straight to the ground.
“…what…?” Cas was taken aback.
Castiel single-mindedly headed for that one place where he knew Dean would be. There were more Alpha team members waiting on the stairs leading to the rooftop. He disregarded their sigh of relief and didn’t stay to chat.
“So? What was it you thought was impossible?” he could see Dean’s face flushing red. Dean was always this easy to read.
"Dean?"
Silence followed his words. But Dean’s presence on his back was an assurance of support.
“Oh, yeah, uhm—” Dean hastily removed his dusk mask in one swift movement and pushed his eye protector to his neck, revealing the entirety of his face.
“My wings have no corporeal form nor will I hit you on purpose even if it did.”
of this town!
“But—” the words barely left his lips when Dean hastily captured his lips. Castiel didn’t even hesitate to respond in earnest, opening his lips easily and wrapping his arms around Dean’s neck and beckoning him to follow him down the bed. Dean topped him with their tongues playfully shoving in each other’s throat, relishing on the taste and feel of their warm exchange. Dean grunted while heated shivers crawled all over Castiel’s body. He could feel Dean growing between his thighs, could feel his excitement as his breath turned rapidly fast. Somewhere at the back of Castiel’s mind, he thought of the handsome guy he met in the middle of nowhere, the same friendly person who guided him and was always there to support him in all his ventures in the school. The man he was now clinging on for his life, the guy now squeezing his thighs and urging him to spread his legs further.
“Stop it, you guys,” Castiel shifted in his chair, his heart racing. Not that he’s as naïve as they seem to think, but the idea of having Dean, the idea of Dean liking him to the point of making his wish become a reality was too surreal. It was something he didn’t want to grasp yet. He couldn’t be certain when he was clouded by his own feelings. How could he fall in love with someone he just met…?
“Fine. I’ll take care of Ham and by the end of the year, it will be on par with the other pigs and will sell at a good price in the market, mark my words, right Ham?”
“What?” Castiel had never seen her up close nor spoken to her before, but right there he was being insulted out of nowhere? April caressed one of the pigs under the neck but she didn’t look mean at all. “Would you care to explain what you just said?”
It also made him look up with blades in his eyes. The urgency of saving Dean became very dire just now but he had to keep the demon still. It took him weeks to realize who was being hunted this time too. He stared at Dean’s naked form, internally struggling at the disappearance his hand print upon the breaking of Dean’s soul from his bond but it didn’t severe anything for him and Dean yet. Castiel refused to let circumstances divide him and Dean.
“Cas? Cas!?” Dean’s voice was hollow, and Castiel couldn’t imagine what void he created in the man’s heart. Lips trembling, hands shaking, he swatted the air aiming for Dean but there was no way, this was a mere part of memory he was seeing. His brain was rationalizing it but he couldn’t bring himself to step away. This was Dean in pain. This was Dean feeling helpless. This was Dean losing it over and over.
It was really an ironic question and deep inside he was still conflicted. But he will cross the bridge when he gets there. Castiel pondered on the question as he left to help with the brick oven at the back of the school.
At first, they were just random commercials of product, but when the screen flicked green and blue, Dean, who had been trying to stay alert and not trip on his feet shaky feet, glanced up. There he saw Castiel Novak featured in an interview. He had to blink several times as his eyes still respond poorly to the light, but there was no doubt—those huge and intense blue eyes that made his stomach flutter every night was live on television.
“Dean,” Castiel didn’t need to breathe, but he was sure Dean could do with some gulp of air. The way Dean was moving against his hips was sending his head in cloud nine and Castiel realized that he was subconsciously following Dean’s mood for angels could choose to feel or not feel altogether. But this with Dean was like piercing one of his dams open and letting out all kinds of sensation. He couldn’t keep it even if he tried. He didn’t plan to, not with Dean already so into sexing with him. The thought burned in Castiel’s thoughts that he was vaguely aware of the fingers popping his shirt buttons open.
Castiel is so good at it, so good at making Dean feel things he’s never felt to any woman. Castiel stopped him like he knew what he was doing, sucking on his neck and leaving marks while they frotted, cock on cock, Dean’s legs up the air and pushing right back. He couldn’t get control—Castiel has it all. The angel grinds on him like that, so lost and in ecstasy as he kissed him again and again.
“Oh.”
“What?” Castiel turned at them, aghast. “But you can have it delivered anyti—"
“I’m happy you’re worried for me. You care about me, right Cas?”
“If he chooses to use improvised explosive device then we’ll have him in no time. After all, it’s one of his signatures too.”
“Adam!” Castiel sighed in relief as the taller guy came carrying a basket of vegetables like tomatoes, asparagus and bell peppers. “You had me worried,”
“She left you because you like all women,” Dean grunted, “Don’t lump me the same way, uncle.”
There was no escaping it. He covered his head with his arms, his sticky hands clasped tight. He let the beating sound echo in his ears and chanted in his head. It’s over, let it be over, let it be gone, let it pass… no, not the bed.
All Dean could manage was to grip both Cas’ shoulder, run his hand down and cup Castiel’s ass and squeeze them, pull them harder down and meet in the middle. It was so good, seeing stars was not enough to describe it. The kiss was hot, the frotting was immaculate—what more if Cas was inside—?
“The school uses modern ovens these days,” Gadreel said as the other students lounged in the area after their bath, “but I’m not surprised you found one like that. The school has been here since I was born.”
“There’s more meat than rice! This is a sin!” Anna was saying with palms on her cheeks.
“Cas… actually, my parents asked me to come back to the farm because they will be visiting my brother in the city so… there’s no one there but me. That’s why… why don’t you just stay at my place during the break? Come home with me.”
“Remember who taught me to drive and nearly drove the impala on a ditch, Dean.”
Dean nodded, impressed. “You think I’m like that?”
Castiel bowed his head. “I’m sorry if I said something wrong. I was just frustrated that things didn’t get my way again and… I ranted on you.”
“I fail to see the need for loincloths,” Castiel commented.
“Morning, Cas.”
“What’s the difference if I’m going to live without you! It’s the same cycle, Cas! I gave up—"
Dean’s heart raced. It was Cas. Dean embraced him tight, fear melting into the abyss. Cas was here. Things will be okay.
Sam told reassuringly leaving Castiel thinking of the implications. He didn’t think Dean had a clue about his feelings. Maybe he did now, but he’s been trying his best to ignore it so Castiel followed his lead. His experience with the kiss reminded him about not letting his guard down.
Jason whistled, looking from Dean to Cas. “Your jam is your friend?”
The music played in the background. Dean stared with a heartfelt look at his boyfriend, lips pressed his lips as Castiel sucked on the straw drinking straight from the coconut juice as they sat face to face at a couple’s table in a beach restaurant. He had to calm the angel down after they joined the count down to the fireworks and somebody began flirting with Dean.
“You’re committing some serious crime there, Cas. Pineapple, sheesh.”
“Came with accomplices, huh?” Dean was back on his feet the next second and was racing after the truck, “You’re not going anywhere!” And jumped at the back of the pickup truck together with the thief—
He gasped at a powerful stroke. The doctor sucked a mark on his neck just beneath his ear and whispered, “I apologize for my manners. You do not know how long I have waited to touch you.” Saying so he stroked Dean once. Dean broke all kinds of noises and arched his body. “Do you like where I’m touching you Dean?”
“If you called that ravishing,” Castiel was glad to see Dean’s nose flair. He was certain their meeting tonight would be more than just another love-making the way Dean growled in his ear. He called his superiors about being late that day and easily got off the hook because he was someone who never skipped work unless it was important. This was important. Castiel was going to date Dean. A little subtle on the moves as he got into baking preparations so when Dean’s car pulled up in the driveway.
“No, everything’s perfect, Steve. You’re really an angel—”
"You're not going to ask how I feel about you?" it scared him that he could be so bold, but Dean was giving him that courage.
“Well, that’s just how it is. The teachers are the ones doing the monitoring and if you’re not in the place you’re supposed to report you’ll automatically receive a red card. Three cards and you’re expelled.”
“Hey, sorry I didn't warn you but, you um, forgot this last night.” Castiel showed him pliers which were true, left last night. He watched as Dean sprinted to him with enthusiasm. “You said you couldn’t make it so, but I’ve asked for a day off, I just thought it’s time to return…”
“No,” Castiel growled. “You’re not-"
Castiel licked his lips and nodded vigorously.
“Jesus, Cas…” was all he could say and grabbed Castiel into another long kiss, tasting himself in Cas but it was something common already. And still never loses its magic.
“Lafayette, call immediate back up from the bomb disposal department. Possible EMS. Gadreel, tap the building’s phone router, ring her office now.”
“Alright, then I’ll let you fix yourselves first then tour our part-timer with all the work in the ranch before I leave.”
“I’m serious, Dean. It’s just like you to worry about us and forget yourself. This time you’re allowed to think about yourself.”
Dean turned and saw the frame of his husband disappear on the corner and frantically ran after him his heart beating hard on his thud. The snow made it difficult to outrun anyone but Cas was making light of it and before long was meters away from Dean.
“So, when it comes to food,” Gadreel was saying, “you can make bacon, sausage or even ham, right?”
“For what? This? This is nothing.”
“Men don’t do pineapple.”
“Are you okay, Sam?”
Castiel’s eyes welled up and he excused himself from the kitchen table right before dinner where Dean too looked lost in thought while Sam and Eileen fix their dinner. He caught Sam calling him back, but his emotions, after almost a week, was at their limits. It was not good that he could feel the Mark itching and spends most of his grace to keep it in control, but emotionally, he was gone.
One quick look at Castiel, and then Dean was eagerly pulling his shirt.
Dean felt goosebumps ran right through his spine. He looked up and caught the officer looking straight into his soul, burning his concern behind the numbing stare. He was worried. Dean was never one to get used to people caring about him but it was different with Cas. The moment he busted the door of Dean’s heart, he stayed there and made one thing clear: Dean Winchester was his world. He’d never fault Cas for being too protective, it was this guy’s MO when it comes to him that Dean had learnt to accept.
“Of course! We’re currently doing research on free additives in Food Science! You first years should join our club too! April will be delighted!” Balthazar eyed Castiel looking hopeful. Before Castiel could answer, Dean’s arm suddenly slid behind his shoulder and pulled him closer while eyeing Balthazar.
It’s rare for Dean to sleep so soundly like there was nothing to worry about in the world. For a hunter such as he… it was a big thing.
“Because you want to stop me from killing right? Let me fuck you tonight and I will. I’d even give you a head start to warn everyone in the vicinity. Just for the night, angel, let me have this. I want you.”
“But you won’t make me do other stuff, right?” he swallowed hard. It had been nagging at the back of his mind ever since he found himself in the dining table. If it was utmost trust that was needed here, he had to get all his fears on the table.
because at least in here, Dean can’t actually see him.
The rest, as they say, is history.
, man. I
“Never mind” Dean grumbles, turning back to the plane to glare at it warily. “So, this thing is safe?”
but he’s not going to tell the bartender that. Dean attempts a casual shrug as he mumbles something that even
“Thank you” Castiel returns, all smarmy just like Dean knew he’d be.
Dean chuckles and finally pulls the man back into bed—he may be anxious now with all this wedding date stuff, but it’s not like it’s happening
life was not going very well, and he stepped in. He took care of her and adopted Becky over there, and just became an outstanding family man. He’s a pillar in this community and I truly couldn’t be more proud to call him my brother …
Soon—he was jetting out the door of the restaurant, stupidly wishing – like some sort of teenage girl in a Hallmark movie, that Castiel would chase after him; but as he stomped up to the side of the impala, her shimmering black paint only showed the reflection of the airport behind him—a vast blue sky, a few clouds, and absolutely no sign of Castiel Novak.
Dean takes a moment, but then he shrugs again—knowing that,
“Too …” Dean breathes, still trying to figure out
“You’re a jerk”
hear all that.

anyone, unless she’s looking to punch them, so the fact that she wanted to lay a reassuring hand on Cas is more than surprising. Claire quickly pulls her hand away as the car straightens back out. “Woah, sorry—are you nervous or something?”
Dean nods again but he continues looking at the ground between his crossed legs, suddenly feeling as if he could cry—
“I … you would … she never … why didn’t she …?” Castiel’s mind is racing and he knows he has no chance in catching up with it.
“I am very glad that you’re alright. I honestly thought I was too late.”
…” he laughs, stepping in closer as he looks that adorable barber up and down, “yeah, I think I can manage that.”
the next time I come by.” From the corner of his eye, the odd man peers back at Dean and smiles slyly, before turning on is heel to walk away, casually slipping the money clip back into his pocket  as he struts.
excuse, so what’s yours?” He eyes Castiel, daring him to come up with anything close to a justifiable explanation, and Castiel knows that he’ll fail to find one. But he’ll be damned if he’ll fail in front of Claire.
“Mr. Novak, it’s good to see you too—but please, ya can call me Pete. After all, this is
“Take your best shot, Winchester.”
“Hi, I’m Pete. I’ll be your pilot.” The older man holds out his hand to Dean, but Dean is too busy staring at the plane—which looks more like a toy than something that people actually ride in.
Dean sighs and stops his attempts to fit fourteen pairs of underwear into the small shoulder bag.  “
Why would your adopted dad be in

“No!” Dean screeches “
“How so?” Charlie asks, still seeming very perplexed by Dean’s reasoning.

over this last year). Part of him always thought that he could someday find a way to see Castiel again, as well as all the others he’s loved and lost, but if everyone’s soul just merges into one now, that means the individual is truly gone,
Castiel eyes shine a brighter blue  as his grace lights him up from within. “You want me to give you release, Dean?”
He stands up slowly from his desk, looking down at the wood surface so he can maintain himself. He doesn’t want to blow up and scare the girl, but she needs to understand just how far over the line she went. “I told you to drop this. I told you that it was inappropriate and you had to leave it alone.”
…” Castiel mutters, but Dean doesn’t look up.
With some hesitation, Castiel lets their fingers intertwine, and Dean gives him a small tug to draw him over. In a moment, they’re chest to chest—Castiel lying on top of Dean like a blanket, and Dean underneath, seeming pleased to finally be surrounded by his warmth.
Castiel chuckles and then leans back to put the truck in gear, seeming rather pleased with himself for making Dean laugh.
“Is this what you want, Dean?” Castiel growls, holding himself back a moment, because he knows that he’s on the cusp of tearing this man apart by the atoms, but he needs to be sure they’re on the same page. However, judging by the ravenous look in Dean’s eyes, he has a good feeling they are.
” He pounds the arms of his chair for emphasis. “Now, you’ll still be here for a while, right?” he asks her hurriedly. They closed about twenty minutes ago, but Charlie usually sticks around for another hour, catching up on things that she wasn’t able to finish with people on the floor.

this very second.
And before Dean can think of something clever to say back, the girl hangs up on him—which is probably for the best, because if he kept going, he’d most likely end up really pissing her off. He does have a tendency to take a joke too far, especially if he’s already in a mood. With a long sigh, he turns his focus back to the book, wishing that there was something he could do help the poor thing. Some way to get back all the words that the nail impaled; but as good as he is, there

Peter swallows hard—his adam’s apple bobbing shakily in his long, thin neck. He reads the note, pulling back a bit when he gets to the bottom of it, obviously shocked by the words “DON’T FUCK IT UP!” written by Charlie's hand in furious, bold caps. After another moment, he manages to wriggle out from beneath Dean’s arm, voice coming out a pitch higher than it was a second ago. “I can get all this for you, sir. Um—stay here, and I’ll be right back.” And then Peter is gone, speed walking out and around the end of the aisle, leaving Dean there alone to smile after him.
Dean has to admit, it’s the easiest he’s ever gotten a guy’s number; but then again, it didn’t feel easy at all. It was nauseating and stressful, and thinking about being on a tiny plane with this sexy little dumbass is making him feel even
Dean immediately perks up with the praise, and then smiles smugly at both his brother and his uncle. “Hear that? I’m
Castiel glances towards his new husband to see that Dean is crying too, the full waterworks, more so than he and Claire combined, and it warms his heart to no end. Dean nods at her before scooting over to pull Castiel into his chest.
“I can see that” Cas says, regarding Sam a moment before twisting back to Dean. “I just … I don’t know

… it was nice, ya know? I was havin’ fun and didn’t want to think about unpacking or work or anything like that.”
He’s ashamed that he’s never thought about it— about what Dean had to do after they broke up. They were already heading into separate dorms for their Junior year, but Castiel did his best to avoid the man beyond that. They were in separate majors, so that helped, but if he saw Dean walking one way, he’d immediately walk the other. He never thought about what the aftermath truly looked like for Dean once he ended things—where the man went and who he confided in. Cas supposes he didn’t want to know, because hearing about it now, imagining Dean crying on his mother’s shoulder, venting to his little brother, showing all the raw pieces of himself to his family so they could try to help him mend, it all makes Castiel want to run simply to spare Dean even the slightest bit more pain.  Yet, he has grown too, and he has learned all too well that life is short, but even that brevity can spare a lot of time for loneliness if you let it; and Castiel is through just allowing life to have its way with him. “I’m so sorry, Dean. I’m sorry I was so selfish before, and too scared to acknowledge how I felt … how I

He straightens back out and groans as his head pounds and his stomach burns. He could probably call Sam to come get him, but then he’d have to endure a lecture … and he can’t handle any of his little brother’s near-sighted words of wisdom right now.
With another roll of her eyes, Charlie smiles. “Yeah. Aren’t you lucky that I do?”
“What? What is it?” Charlie yelps, running in from off the floor, probably thinking Dean caught himself on fire with all
Dean watches her a moment, noticing how her cheeks tinge with the attention. “Well, which do you prefer? Lynn, or Litty?”
“Uh—yes. The very same.”
Castiel pinches his brows together a moment but then smirks, as if he’s walking into a very familiar conversation. “
“No!” Dean spits as soon as he sees the color. The whiskey that’s taking up most of the space in his body does its damndest to drown out his consciousness, but he needs to see this through. He needs to make sure this is

“Yeah,

“What? Sorry, okay! I’m just saying, I’m happy for you is all.”
The girl pulls away and thwacks him on the arm. “Yeah, it is! So, prove you earned it by not giving up!”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Dean. I’m Castiel—as I’m sure you’ve figured out via our window” He nods towards the glass. “And you’ve already met Becky.”

That’s what he needs right now.

The power dynamic would always feel off, and that may make everyone miserable in the long run. “Well—we got one more guy to see, so who knows; but out of all of ‘em, Hank’s lookin’ like the one to beat. I’m sure he’d chill out once we got used to him and he got used to us.”

Charlie smiles more genuinely now before peeling herself from the seat. She then walks over to him and pats him on the shoulder. “Yeah, I know. In your messed up way—I know that you care.”

“Shut up.” His baby brother always did have a way of reading his mind.

“I’m not gonna have the hots for a book murderer.”
“Shit” Dean whispers, smiling immediately afterwards because he can see Castiel smiling at him through the windshield of his truck.
Dean isn’t really sure, nor does he care, because Castiel is squatting down now, inspecting the levers on the underside of the chair, gripping one and manipulating it slowly, making the chair move up and down.
betrayed by someone who he’s only spent a collective hour with; but still, the knife in his heart is there, defying all logic.
photo shoots for Calvin Klein and Abercrombie. It was almost unbelievable, and Dean laughed his ass off when Sam came home and told him that he’d been “discovered” but when those checks started rolling in, and that moose’s face began popping up on billboards and in between the pages of magazines, Dean wasn’t laughing anymore. That gangly kid is now America’s
Dean’s face reddens even more. “The guy! The uh—the book nailer.”
“Well … it’s uh … um” Dean chuckles. “Uh … never mind.” There’s no way he’s going to get into a
—glowing and grand as he powers towards Dean on the bed, covering him like a protective blanket.  The angel is beautiful, and Dean would be content watching him like that forever; but he’s also never been this turned on in all his life, so he’s relieved when Castiel begins undoing those new jeans of his … and thankfully, he’s much quicker with taking clothes off than he is, putting them on.
“But why? Why are you afraid to sleep?” Sam looked as if he was trying to really understand the situation. Dean appreciated him for that. He was a good brother.
“Cas?” Dean was peering on his face the next second. He didn’t know how long he had been standing there, but to know that it was Dean who could always find him was a comfort. Castiel stared at his lover gloomily. “Hey, what’s wrong? Did somebody pick on you? Who the hell made you sad—?”
“That’s a surprise,” Castiel took the brush from Dean and washed it by the hose, “I thought everyone here has some kind of dream and I’m the only one lost,”
Castiel glanced at the thick books on his desk. He had already finished reading them after he took the exam and memorized them word by word. He knew he was going to pass anyway. If anything else fails in life, at least he knows he’s got a very smart head on his shoulder.
“It’s alright, I just got in here too.” Castiel saw Dean avert his gaze so he let the topic go. The handyman obviously chose to drop it. Dean sniffed the air.
“C’mon, you’re not afraid of horses now, are you?”
“I’d work naked if you ask me.”
“What look?”
“You asked for this,”
“I’m sorry. I thought I didn’t have to disturb you since you said it’s close by. I guess, I was frustrated and was overthinking about my parents again. I’m sorry for making you worry.” He reached for Dean’s fist and slowly entwined their hands. “I’m sorry. So don’t look angry anymore.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean was there brimming with energy as he pulled a horse beside him. It was Baby.
“Uh… you guys are dating…?”
“It’s me.” Castiel answered. “Bomb disposal on the rear.”
Castiel’s eyes widened. Confession or not, Dean was ready to take him home, it seemed.
“Hey, Gavin, those two barely had time to be together without you adding to the mix. Of course Castiel would rather spend time with Winchester." Adam pointed out.
“I also understand you both need to rest after fighting for this world your entire lives and this is a good opportunity for Jack to socialize. But are you sure those swimming gears are enough? If Jack were to drown—?”
“I don’t think we’ve uh…” he shifted on his feet awkwardly, their gazes lock. “Hi.”
It was a week after their midterms that Castiel felt relieved. Gavin had successfully managed to get actual passing scores on their Math subject and no longer at the bottom. His muscle cramping from club activities had subsided too, and has now gotten the trick into mounting horses without hurting himself and the horse. Ham was getting good numbers on the weighing scale and Castiel was still the star student of all the first year. Though, he wasn’t focused on that any longer. He was making progress with things that were important at the moment, especially spending more time with Dean.
“What?”
Back in Dean’s room where Dean said he would wait, Castiel found peace. He never knew how blocking himself from Dean’s room had made him sadder than he cared to admit and now that it was out of the way, what remained was their talk.
“Alright, if you want you can move it to another spot.” Ms. Barnes said Castiel stepped to the pen, took the piglet by the middle and carried it to the front chest. The piglet took one sniff at the teat before it scurried back to the rear.
He was handsome as ever, lips more sinful than before. His eyes were as dark as the spaces between the stars. He was also very naked from head to foot with the bundle of his clothes resting at the head of the bed where he was leaning his freckled zoned back comfortably.
“Yes, but you saved me from…” he didn’t say hell. It would only bring up memories from the past both too painful for them to remember so Castiel chose to bury it deep inside him. Just like how Dean seemed to do it most of the time. He believed it to be unhealthy.
“Nothin bad. Was your doing.” He added with a slight smirk.
Dean’s lips were against his again as the man slid his hands out of Castiel’s pants to hoist him up and hook Castiel’s legs on his waist. Dean held him up securely, holding him against him and blindly walked towards the stairs. The lights were dim which made it difficult, not to mention the nonstop kissing. The trip to the bedroom was hazardous but Castiel never doubted Dean’s strength. He was carried off to the second floor, their lips never leaving each other. He laughed when Dean’s elbow bumped on the wall but he was very careful not to hit Castiel on anything. The walk was slow that by the time they reached the bedroom, Castiel was hard as a hammer. Dean dropped him down the queen-sized bed, Castiel’s arms still locked around Dean’s neck.
Dean and Castiel eyed each other.
Dean was being distant again. Castiel felt it. Dean didn’t talk to him, not an entire day, only exchanging formal greetings that had Sam raise both eyebrows in bemusement that said,
"You're worried for me?" Dean smirked, "I mean, yeah, you look like a brother-in-law material.”
Dean had his eyebrows creased due to the glaring sun but Castiel ignored it. Dean had his dark sleeves rolled up to his shoulder, his muscles tan and shiny. With booths thick, jeans tight, he really looked like a hot model and a main character on the porn plot. Castiel was glad he was still hidden inside the house.
“Good!” Dean puffed out and then grinned next, “So, can I call you Cas?”
“Still, ouch.” Dean winked as he threw the decoration on his hand to the box Jack was carrying and carried it himself. Jack stood up and carried what Sam was carrying and they began to march back to the hallway. Castiel kept his hands deep inside his while bumping on Dean’s shoulder who was walking with him. So, what if he kept his wings around Dean every time they’re walking? It was natural that he did.
“You were mad at me?” Castiel smiled.
Castiel didn’t answer. Something in Dean’s eyes ignited and before Castiel could ask, Dean is pulling him towards the impala.
Dean’s eyes flickered black. Humans backed away immediately with terror and confusion painting their faces. Around him, Castiel saw demons gather in a circle. Dean inclined his head on one side and shrugged his shoulder, stepped back the line and melted into the crowd.
Dean’s face was red as a tomato, Castiel didn’t doubt he was the same.
“No, I need it removed today when I get home. I’m asking if you can send someone who can meet me after work. No one is at home at this hour, no one else.”
Red in the face, Dean finally allowed Castiel to catch a glimpse of him. Castiel’s heart raced to see the way Dean wasn’t running away. Deep at the back of his mind, he always had this image of Dean running away from the notion of being loved by someone like him, in this vessel and all. But he supposes, people change for the better, that people are changed by circumstances and Dean had a lot of chances to do so while Castiel was loving him. Then again, Castiel will always love him no matter how he responded because that was how he gave his priceless love. It was all in Dean’s hand.
“Jesus Christ, Dean.” Castiel mumbled, sneaking closer to have a good view of Dean.
“Let’s take a shower, Dean.”
“Want to join me in the night patrol?” Dean asked.
It was thanks to Dean’s humor that the night didn’t have to be awkward. It was still silly how the man seemed concerned over the backdoor, Castiel had to assure him he’ll lock it.
“What?” Dean asked with a thick voice. He didn’t know what to do when Dean leaned to kiss his soft length, then without warning, the demon gripped the base of his cock and swallowed him whole again.
