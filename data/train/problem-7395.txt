“You’ll never get this flash drive!” The man growls and the Captain resists the urge to roll his eyes mid battle. This was ridiculous and the only reason he hadn’t already knocked the guy out was the fear of breaking the flash drive and giving his mission partner enough time to swipe the information that they needed.
"I know you're going to keep thinking about this, so I'm gonna say try not to. It's not worth it."
“And thank god for that.”
“Did you know that yellow chrysanthemums mean unrequited love?” Carol asked them after her coughing fit had subsided and she seemed okay to breathe on her own. The pinched look on Rhodey’s face gave away his frustration with his stubborn patient but one look from Tony had the doctor smoothing out his expression. Personal feelings had to be put aside, they were professionals after all, and Rhodey certainly had to remember that even if he was close with his patient.
“And how was your trip? Did you find anything?” Natasha asked from the couch as Bucky and Sam walked through the apartment door. They were dirty and clearly exhausted but still tensed up like they were ready to fight at the drop of a dime. The serum did that to all of them: gave them the super senses and fortitude to survive any mission but also the intense crashes of having more energy than they knew what to do with when a fight ended too early.
He wanted someone who would stand up for what was right and what mattered. He wanted someone who would be there for him when it mattered most and would back him up. He wanted someone who looked at him like there was no one else in the room even when there was. He wanted someone who made him feel alive and who made him feel like there was still so much to see and do. Of course Tony knew that but it was something that he sometimes found himself forgetting when he got caught up in his work. It was easy to get stagnant and not even really notice. So, he wanted someone who could remind him there was more to life than his work and the articles he worked so hard on.
Ah, that explained the excitement. It would have been too much to ask for Tony to be excited about something like classes or even that one club that kept wanting Tony to join them. Of course, Tony would be excited about getting weed delivered to their door. Two years of being roommates had taught Steve to know better.
"Gotta go. Watch your surroundings next time." The Captain said and coming from anyone else Tony would have been offended at the advice but for some reason Tony couldn't get offended. The Captain seemed like he was just genuinely asking Tony to pay more attention.
"I love you Steve."
i’m sure it looks amazing! ☺️☺️
nah i really meant my mans
A contentious subject given that ultimately vigilantes were people who would rather take the law into their own hands than let the system handle it the way it was supposed to be done. But Tony understood why the Captain felt he had to do it. Despite it not being Tony’s usual beat, he knew how corrupt New York had always been and how that corruption had only cemented itself more and more as the years went on. So someone feeling like they had no choice but step up to fight the corruption? Well that was the origin story of how many superheroes? Practically all of them if Tony was honest.
Eventually he gives in and shoots the Captain a text or who he figures has to be the Captain because there's only one phone number saved on the phone he was given. The phone rings two times before the call connects with a click and Tony hears the familiar voice.
Steve turned to look at the same painting and raised an eyebrow at his work. This piece was ridiculous. It had started out as a sketch of Bucky and Sam being stupid in their dorm room and had somehow become into some abstract collection of colors and shapes. His roommates called it his “clown painting”.
After all, there could be no denying that his job brought him more anguish than it rightfully should. Watching most of his patients choose to die had a way of breaking Tony slowly, little by little. Rarely did he admit to the weakness but now that he spent time with Steve he found himself opening up to the blond. He let him know the thoughts that plagued him after a particularly trying day via text message.
If anyone wants a cool coffee rec, go to
smart. You know better than to go along with my ridiculous plans. Or well, you
Keeping his own flowers a secret was becoming harder by the day because not only were they rare flowers, flowers that no current patient was suffering from, they were also seemingly triggered by Steve’s own. Getting away from Steve would mean admitting to his own flowers and giving up the precious time he had left with him. And regardless of how much it was physically paining Tony, he wouldn’t give Steve up for anything in the world.
“As much as it pains me to admit it, Bucky’s right, you need to lighten up Steve. We’re finally heading back stateside and it’s high time. I’m in desperate need of a shitty burger and fries. It’s not like the grease is going to go to my hips anytime soon.” Sam cut in from where he stood at the kitchen’s doorway, clearly coming back with snacks for him and Bucky, and Steve rolled his eyes briefly.
"I'll make an honest man out of you one of these days Steve Rogers. Mark my words."
“Most definitely.”
classes are the worst and im so tired. where can i get coffee that’ll bring me back to life?
“Don’t I know it?”
so the cute blond barista at the spoonful is not only the cutest guy ive ever had the pleasure of awkwardly ordering a drink from, but hes also a latte art god. look at this greatness!!
Tony sighs and thinks quickly about what he actually has to present for this meeting and quickly realizes that he really wasn’t ready for this meeting. But that’s also been Tony Stark’s brand ever since he started at The Avenger and he always just thinks on his feet till he lands somewhere and figures it out.
The petals burst from her mouth in a seemingly endless flurry of yellow. It was just her luck that the flowers that had chosen to grow in her lungs produced so many tiny petals. Tony imagined that made everything even more problematic. The small petals attached themselves far more easily to her windpipe and kept her from breathing in tiny increments. Carol Danvers was truly dying of an incredibly slow chokehold.
“Tony get out!” The Captain called and Tony shook his head before pulling the rest of his body out of the window. Tony jumped down into the grass below and rolled on the ground as he landed to try to minimize the bruises he would be waking up with tomorrow.
These people with their love, a love that they believed was worth dying for, and their pain that they’d rather suffer than give up to live. These people who believed that it was better to die loving someone even if they would never be loved back in return. People who most would call incredibly selfless but Tony would argue were incredibly naïve. There was nothing to be gained from loving so much you were willing to suffocate over your one-sided love. These people who didn’t end up thinking of all the other people they left behind as they chose to die in a flutter of bloody petals for someone who didn’t feel the same way. It made them naïve and selfish but who was Tony to judge them?
"Breakfast by Brucie Bear? Oh my god. Jarvis take notes of my coffee bot idea while I head down to the common floor. So I was thinking of including an espresso machine--"
“So you noticed that too! Every time I think about it, I remember that you remind me of Superman a lot. Costume aside though because yours isn’t as bright and loud as his.”
Their friends liked to make fun of them and liked to say that they were each other’s endgame. That if any couple could survive the messy quagmire that was college dating it would be them because they were made for each other. And it felt that way to Steve most of the time. He looked at Tony and saw so many possibilities.
but it didn’t sound
“Well, then we should go meet with Carol before the others. Our newest addition can wait because he’s definitely not as far gone as Carol. God, why she won’t listen is beyond me.” Rhodey said, the last bit likely not intended for Tony to hear. The words however did confirm some of Tony’s suspicions, those being that Rhodey did indeed care about Carol a little more than the average patient. Tony knew how that would end: Rhodey with teary eyes as Carol coughed up bloody petals and tried to gasp for breath and fail to do so. Making friends with these patients was an awful idea and Tony knew it first-hand. He hadn’t ever forgotten the deep sadness after Pepper had died on him. That was the first and last time he’d let himself get truly attached to a patient in any real way.

The white rose petals were covered in blood. It was a rather gruesome sight but one that Tony and Rhodey were entirely immune to at this point in their careers. Tony moved over to their patient, a charming young man named Charles, and patted his back as the petals of another rose rushed to escape from his throat. Once the coughing had subsided and it seemed like he could take a breath, Tony moved to clean the bloody petals off his bed sheet while Rhodey checked over Charles.
"Well, don't just stand there, just do it!" Steve exclaimed. "Wait—let me sedate him a little so he doesn't feel it as much."
Tony sighed and squeezed the kids shoulders. "Take the cat home, bud. I-I'm not sure if we can keep a cat in here—"
“Steve, you need to tell us the truth.”
"You don't have to watch out for me." Steve turned away this time, focusing on the chart in hand and wishing his eyes weren't watering. "I'm not your...you don't have to worry about me. It's fine."
"Rogers."
Katie stirred a little and reached out to Steve weakly. "Thanks for not killing me, Dr. Blondie."
Tony smirked. "There's no need to be so formal, honey bear. You've addressed me informally for years, you know. Unless all that time away from me on the West Coast gave you amnesia."
"You shouldn't be alone in that apartment," Natasha continued. "Before you say no, Bucky fixes things. Sharon bakes. And I'm good with the cleaning. Plus we can split up the rent."
Bucky nodded. "Tell all the interns. And maybe the nurses—" Steve nudged him and he groaned in response— "j-just the interns."
Steve sighed. "I am so sorry he said all of that to you. I didn't even think he would say anything. Things have been...okay between us lately."
Tony was surprised to go down to the kitchen and find his husband at the stove, donning the apron and everything. The blond was stirring something in a pot, and the aromas floating around the tower smelled like wonderful. The fireplace crackled, illuminating the tower. The sight was something of a dream, a movie. Walking up behind Steve, Tony slipped his arms the man's waist, relishing the warmth that radiated from his body.
"I fall
Joe nodded in response and mentioned it to the mysterious man across the way. Steve took another sip of water, waiting to see what pretty boy had to say about it. Joe returned with another drink in hand and smiled.
Eva looked up in surprise. "Aw, Stevie, for what?"
He was new to the city. It was like a miniature version of New York. Plenty of tourists, plenty of the same hustle and bustle as New York, but to a lesser degree. It was different. There were so many goddamn ingredients on a hot dog and pizza was served far too thick and with way too much sauce; New York was the superior city. There was no arguing about that.
Eva extended a tentative hand. “It’s very nice to meet you, Dr. Stark. Everyone speaks very highly of you around here.”
"I did." Steve could barely stop his voice from cracking.
Tony pouted. "You were gone longer than I expected. Pardon me for missing you and your ass."
"Do you love her?" Steve repeated.
“Busy night, huh?” The edge in Steve’s voice was unmistakable. There was a smile on the intern’s face despite the coldness in his voice—he knew exactly what he was doing.
"Maybe I could clear that up right now."
The women beside them started giggling and whispering. Immediately, Steve's face was hot. He cleared his throat and quickly changed into scrubs. The women couldn't help but notice the hickeys on his back and chest. The man beside him whistled, the women hushed him but couldn't stop their own laughter. Their teasing was interrupted by one of the residents reading names out loud. Several names were called before Steve heard his.
"Not hungry?"
The brunet ran and blocked the door. "You can't run away from everything, Steve. Quit running from me."
"Ma'am, maybe we can get you looked at too—" Steve moved to take her place at the woman's chest.
“None.”
Peter was welcome in their apartment anytime, the teenager took Tony up on that offer frequently. He came by to study, left whatever device he needed to be charged up, and he definitely crashed out on the roof every once in a while after a night of fighting crime.
Steve put a stethoscope to her chest and felt instant relief to hear a normal heartbeat. "Hey, you."
"Really?" Bucky blurted out.
“Okay. Try not to forget about me and fall for other pretty blonds.”
Whenever Tony’s in the fine arts building, he tries not to play too loud. There are other music students who are far more skilled than he is, and sometimes he’s a little embarrassed to play louder like the others.
"I know we've been—intimate—but I really do want to be in this with you, Steve." Tony took a step forward, and suddenly Steve couldn't think straight. The subtle scent of Tony's cologne sent his mind reeling. "I like you. I-I want to be with you."
"What did you hear?" Steve nudged his friends with his pen. "I'm not fragile. I'm a big boy, I can take it."
As the storm raged on outside the hospital, the interns were gathered around the nurses' station instead of their usual place in the tunnels. The cellphone reception was better than the tunnels, and it was all hands on deck to get a heart for Andy.
The intern paused for a moment before finally facing the neurosurgeon. His face looked oddly somber.  "Alright. Favorite color."
Tony could not take his eyes off the two of them. The way Steve had suddenly become speechless when she arrived made him sick to his stomach, and the way she fucking smiled in response was just infuriating.  Tony couldn’t take his eyes away from that table; every single glance, every hint of blush, and smile cut deeper and deeper into his heart. He was somehow angry and completely broken all at once—the chips and coffee sitting before him were completely unappetizing now.
"If you wanna kiss me, you'll have to let me take care of you." Steve crossed his arms as Tony whined. "I mean it. No kissing me, no touching me..."
"Please, listen to me." Tears fell from her eyes now. "That's why I came all the way out here. I wanted to make things right. A-and your father, he's worried about the hospital—"
"That's all I needed to hear." Steve set down the child in the cot. "I need you to leave, I have to check on the Peterson baby. He's a preemie and he's prone to infections."
"Tony." Her voice sounded soft. Small. "Can't we just talk?"
"I missed you, Tony." She forced a smile. "I know, I-I made a mistake, but—"
"'Nother round, Joey!"
Except that she was. Eva was more than just a good student getting good grades—she was an amazing tutor and mentor to everyone that ever asked her for help. She said that she always wanted to be a teacher; Steve thought that that was perfect for her. No matter how busy she was with her own studies, anyone who asked her for help was welcome.
"Oh. Alright then. Thank you Dr. Rhodes."
"Nothing," Steve sighed, "I need to check on my patients, Tony."
His last partner wanted to understand. She was in grad school, he was in the thick of his third year of medical school. They both knew how difficult graduate education could be, but even then, it didn't work out. Steve pretended not to care—he didn't need a boyfriend or girlfriend to survive—but still, it'd be nice if something like that worked out. That someone would understand what he's going through, and what he's going to be going through for the next few years. That someone could lay down in bed with him after hours of studying. If only.
“I really don’t think that I’m the problem--”

Tony often wondered how he would die. It was just one of those things that he couldn’t help but think about. In the way that after a decision was made one usually found themselves wondering what would’ve happened if the other path had been chosen. It was just one of those things. So it wasn’t the weirdest thing for Tony to think about. Or well at least he thought so.

It made Tony want to cough. Cough harder than he had in ages and when he hacked up a bunch of bloody petals, his eyes widened. Up until this moment he had been able to ignore the painful part of his feelings for the Captain. He’d been able to just bask in the man’s attentions and let the flowers think they were going to be accepted soon but now in this dark room he knew that he couldn’t do that anymore.
He coughed up his first bloody bud and knew his time was running out.
I hate my friends. You know who you are.😔
Get some sleep Tony. Please.
“I mean I guess. Why do you think that you don’t know Tony that well? Because honestly I’ve never seen two people more in love and so obnoxious. You know him well. Trust me.”

“Tony Stark?” The blonde kid asked as Steve looked down at him. No doubt this kid was a freshman because Steve didn’t recognize him. It wasn’t like Steve knew everyone who went to the university but being Tony’s roommate for two years had helped Steve meet a lot of people.
No one had reported on Tony’s disappearance either. The man had once told Steve that sometimes he’d go on writing binges for days and his coworkers knew not to worry. So it was on Steve to save him. Because no one else was going to notice something was wrong until it was far too late.
“You’re a magnet for danger.”
“I don’t know why this is so shocking to me but it is.”
“Because my stuff will be there Steve. It’s not like the things you do. Social justice marches and poetry readings and all the other stuff we do together. Those things don’t last forever. You have to experience them in the moment before they disappear into thin air. My robots will be there though so you can always look at them later. The fact you care enough to ask about it is more than I could ever ask for.”
"Tony? You alright? Did you attract trouble again?"
“It’s the air you’re breathing. A simple chemical that forces the body to think it’s running out of time. It’ll force the petals out by force. Wasn’t our intention when we made the chemical but it works wonders when we need our guests to talk. Unlucky for you, we don’t need anything from you and we don’t need you alive. Good luck catching your breath.”
Or so he thought before life intervened and made the choice for him.

“Jarvis, where is Tony?" Steve asked. He'd just finished spreading out a checkered red and white blanket over a fluffy old comforter of his.
“Start packing Rogers. We need to get going. Yelena has coordinated a flight for us and provided us with the identification to get into the country. I’ll take care of the rest when we get there.” Natasha ordered. She had moved to the computers they’d set up and was beginning the arduous process encrypting all their intel.

"You certainly do attract havoc. It all makes sense now."
Except deep down Tony knew that his own set of flowers was going to either kill him or leave him entirely emotionless when it came to thinking about Steve in the future. In the end Steve was never going to love him back because he loved someone else and hadn’t been willing and continued to not be willing to give them up. Tony didn’t stand a chance there and he knew it.
“What are you working on Stephen?” Loki asked while he put together his first cup of early grey.
“Twenty-five?” The way the blonde kid seemed to be asking Steve more than answering him made Steve feel bad for the freshman.
Carol gave them a bright smile as they entered the room and Tony could almost believe for a second that she wasn’t choking on her petals half the time. She could pretend that the petals neatly stacked by her bedside were just petals that had fallen from the artfully arranged yellow chrysanthemums sitting in the glass vase innocently. It was believable until she started looking strained, no doubt trying to hold in her cough.  It seemed she was attached to Rhodey and Tony themselves too considering she always tried to look like she wasn’t in pain in their presence, but Tony couldn’t pretend like Carol.

“Aww Stevie you soft hearted sucker.” Bucky mumbled as he pressed into Natasha for a second more before standing up slowly.
“Who do we have to see today?” Rhodey muttered as he slipped on his white coat upon entering the floor dedicated to Hana patients. Tony looked away from the computer where he was writing up an email to the in-house pharmacy to look at his usual partner.

Despite his moment of revelation Tony still continued to talk to Steve in the same manner. It was hard to break their routine and when he was with him, he hardly noticed how bad the situation really was. It seemed as if Steve never had to struggle with his roses when Tony was with him. Apart from the time they met Steve had never coughed or vomited up any petals in his presence but that by no means meant he was getting better.
“Did you know that your love languages seem to be quality time and words of affirmation? Oh and sometimes gifts but mainly the other two,” Tony muttered into his shoulder one night in bed.
Tony spends literal hours trying to break the encryption on the phone the Captain gave him because this is the first time he’s gotten a chance to handle any of the Quartet’s tech. It is undoubtedly theirs because not only is the encryption difficult to break even for Tony but when he finally gets through there’s nothing beneath the encryption. It makes no sense and Tony spends a few days debating using the phone just to ask the Captain why that is the case.

“Mmm. I’m currently focusing on a small series of articles on the rising Hanahaki fatalities. Fury insisted that I write something to address it. Something about despite my arrogant nature I have a pretty good ability to explain complicated medical issues simply.” Stephen responded and took a long slurp of his strong coffee.
This was the sixth time that he'd been rescued by New York's vigilante heartthrob because at this point everyone both knew about the Captain and adored him for the work he did to keep them safe.

“Sometimes but honestly most of the time I don’t. I rather think about the here and now. There’s so much to experience in the present that I rather not waste my time thinking about the future. Unless I really have to. Like what you and I can do together.”

It sometimes felt like Tony knew everything about Steve while Steve didn’t know nearly as much about Tony. It was something that Steve hadn’t noticed right away because he
“Mr. Rogers I wish I could say it’s a pleasure to meet you but these circumstances aren’t the best are they?” Rhodey said as he moved towards the foot of the bed where Steve’s most up to date chart was hanging. “I’m Doctor Rhodes and this is Nurse Stark. We’ll be your regular team so if there’s anything you need by all means come to us first. Everyone is here to help you but we’re personally assigned to you.”
“I’ll see you there. Come prepared with an explanation.”
Despite all the odds to Tony that someone was the Captain. The Captain had earned his affections. He wasn’t concerned with Tony’s lineage or his heritage, and if he was then he had done a fine job of making Tony feel like that wasn’t the case. Tony didn’t think that the Captain had done anything in an effort to win him over like that though. The Captain didn't seem like the sort who wanted to take advantage of Tony. No he seemed like he wanted to be there for Tony and he seemed like the sort of person who would do that for any of his friends.

The Captain slipped the shield onto his back and held out a hand to her. She took it and stood quickly. They both look down on the mercenary, who from the looks of it, now that they had more time to look, really did look more desperate and poor than evil.
“There’s still time for you to get the surgery. If we wait much longer the damage to your other organs will become irreparable. I highly recommend you take this choice into consideration Steve otherwise as ominous as this sounds the end is very near,” Rhodey said while checking the results of the tests they’d run on Steve earlier that morning.
“Keep it in your pants for now Barnes. How about we start on the weapons while they handle the tech?” Sam said after setting down the snacks on the table and turning away from their resident super spies to help Steve with packing.

what friend? bucky? lol mans cant even string together enough words for a coherent sentence.
"Hello Tony. What's--"
Steve was used to being overlooked. Growing up skinny and sickly quickly forced Steve to become accustomed to not being anyone’s first choice. It was just the sort of thing that was relegated to pretty people. People like Bucky who always attracted at least three different gazes when he stepped into a room. Steve knew he could never be one of those people so he just had to get used to the idea that he would be but background decoration. Over the years it became easier for him to do just that. The older he grew the less he cared about being overlooked. Who cared if more people paid attention to all the people around him? Steve had Bucky and Bucky was as loyal as they came. That was honestly all Steve needed most days.
Steve sighed and looked away from his own work.
The thing about New York streets was that they were always so incredibly crowded and that if someone was smart about it then they were the perfect place to kidnap someone in plain sight. Tony knew that both from growing up far too rich in such a big city and from his own line of work. One didn’t write all the kinds of articles that he did without attracting enough attention to warrant self awareness.
Tony had smiled up at the Captain at that while feeling his cheeks heat up with a small blush. The compliment was unexpected but incredibly welcome.
"If I let it bother me all the time then I would never get anything done. I have better things to do with my time. Like spending my free time with you and the rest of my time with my work. That's worth it. They're not."

“You do know Stevie, you should just move in together. He already has his own apartment that he doesn’t share with anyone.”
And that last message left him wondering just what exactly he was doing because his actions were not those of a man simply friends with another man. The message was like a bucket of cold water. It was clarity.
Coffee creamer acquired, he shook it before pouring a generous amount into his mug and swirling it around with a long spoon. He sipped it carefully before frowning and adding more creamer. Was today just not a good coffee day? The additional dollop of creamer did the trick and Tony hummed happily before sipping his drink while leaning against his kitchen counter to listen to Rhodey.
“Carol is different now. I want to say she’s happier but at the same time, I don’t know. Every time s
“And the two measly guards they had watching this part of the house have probably gotten around to calling in back up by now. So out the window before they get here.”
“Got it. I’ll just forward your number to all my friends and any enemy of yours that I can think of!” Tony teases and can’t help but grin broadly at the mildly annoyed expression on the Captain’s face that he can make out beneath the facemask covering the lower half of the man’s face.

Later on when he was more awake he would realize that he’d coughed up some blue flower petals that were now clinging messily to his pillowcase.
when’s the wedding
Tony looked up with a shudder to see the shadow of a man just on the edge of the cell’s line of vision. He could just make out a red mask on the man’s face and his heart dropped.
Tony looked at Steve like he had hung the stars and it was the best feeling in the world. Tony showed his affection so obviously to remind Steve that he was loved. He showed it in the smallest gestures and in the grand ones too. Steve found himself learning to be more like Tony. To show his affection in small sketches and whispered
Tony had grown up knowing that people were always expecting things out of him and always trying to get things out of him. To this day Steve was thankful that Tony, while initially cautious about their budding relationship, had never really seen Steve as being any sort of gold digger or manipulator who only wanted to get close to Tony for his wealth. Because honestly Steve had fallen in love with those pretty brown eyes and the mischief in Tony’s smile, not in the amount of zeros in Tony’s name or the legacy of the Stark family.
Then Tony woke up a few days later with the urge to cough. It was just strong enough to rouse him from sleep. He let up a series of coughs up and then fell back asleep.
“I just wanted to know if you came to the store often to get your fix for knitting! I didn’t actually think that was some sort of code for your top secret drug smuggling operation. Which by the way is incredibly messed up of you. We already have a major drug problem in the US. We don’t actually need to exacerbate the situation more with situations like these. I’m just saying, maybe consider that.”
“Go on and look for him. I’ll cover you. There’s no guards down here right Winter?” Natasha said while pulling out a handgun to keep watch.
Steve sniffles a bit, feeling his cheeks burning. He’s crying in a fucking airport terminal, God, it’s so
Another intern sat beside him, already donning the blue scrubs and the white coat. Her golden hair fell down in ringlets from her pony tail. A purple stethoscope hung around her neck.
Steve glanced up at Redhead—Natasha—for a moment before trying to focus on his charting. "What?"
Tony smiled as Steve entered the room. The intern had to steady himself for a moment, not quite expecting such a warm welcome from the man. He never knew where he stood with Tony these days, even moments like these, where there seemed to be a silent truce between them.
"Nothing," Steve lied, focusing on his penmanship. Natasha rolled her eyes in exasperation.
"I didn't like you running away," she admitted, "but I don't think I ever hated you."
Steve felt like a babysitter, only instead of children, he was sending drunken doctors and nurses back home. The future of medicine, sent home half asleep and guaranteed for a hangover. Before sending Jake into his cab, Steve threw the ice pack at him.
“They weren’t too keen on sitting out in the freezing snow with me.”
"Yes, the very proud son of Howard Stark," Tony said bitterly, "I worked for him, but I also worked at a private practice."
“Thanks.” Tony notices the sketchpad in his hands. “An aspiring artist, I see?”
The pianist fidgets with his hands for a moment, silently hoping that his cheeks are only warm, that he isn’t blushing while this ridiculously adorable stranger compliments him.
The gentle timbre of Sharon’s voice brought him back to reality. He faced his friend, feeling warmer when she smiled at him. Steve suddenly remembered that he was standing right in the middle of the surgical unit with Sharon. They were supposed to check the board and scrub into their respective surgeries. Sharon was observing Banner’s cholecystectomy, and Steve was just about to get ready for Danvers’ coronary artery bypass surgery.
"Easy there, buddy, save your strength for surgery, okay?" Dr. Danvers turned to the rest of the group. "Who's presenting?"
"I know, Buck." Steve should have known people would talk. He just didn't expect people would still be calling him names as if they were still in high school. "Don't worry about it. People talk. It's fine."
Natasha, Steve and Sharon all sat in the front row. Bucky glanced up at them, waving his fingers at them. The trio gave three sets of thumbs up, and while he knew they were trying to be supportive, he just felt a little nauseous. Behind them, the other interns had drinks and snacks in hand, swapping cash and snickering to each other.
"Steve. You can call me Steve since I'm babysitting for you," Steve said with a wink, "Andy is my number one patient tonight."
Steve nodded quickly. "Just...having a long day."
Danvers nodded. "Quick thinking today with a transplant. You interns aren't half bad."
"I think she likes you," Sharon said. "She hasn't let go of your finger."
Tony cracked some eggs into a pan. "Starve."
Pepper pursed her lips together and smiled. "I'll always remember that."
"We can keep a cat," Steve replied as a-matter-of-factly, "the landlord said we can."
"Sorry I'm late, folks," Tony said quickly, "One of the interns needed help after running a code."
"Sit down and drink water," Steve replied sharply, "Make sure Nat and Sharon get some water too. You guys can crash here tonight. I'm sending everyone else home."
. You guys need to grow up!"
An adult, going-steady date was supposed to happen, but then again, Tony's life wasn't
“I love you. So,
Alex jumped up and joined the interns, both crying and screaming with excitement. Soon, the three of them were a blur of tears and happiness, but there was no time to waste. Sharon and Alex went back up to the NICU, and Steve made his way to the elevator to meet the procurement team.
The mother reached her hand across the table, holding Steve's hand and squeezing. His heart stirred for a moment, seeing her eyes water with gratitude. He was just about to say something when Sharon came running over, eyes wide.
"It's not your fault," Steve cut him off. "Let's get you to bed."
Steve smirked. "Well, you're welcome. Or whatever."
Tony turned to the intern, ready to answer and tell him the truth. It was what he deserved after all, after everything that happened between them. There was no use in lying; Steve deserved more than all the hurt he received.
"We're just taking it slow," Steve replied, "going steady, or whatever he keeps telling me. But it's not like he's my boyfriend."
Once Sarah left the room, Steve noticed a familiar face standing behind the glass window. Tony looked on, as if he was trying to get a glimpse of the Peterson baby, but Steve knew why he was there.
"Th-thank you, Dr. Wilson. I really—"
"Don't be so surprised, Tony." The doctor put up the guard rails on the patient bed. "Pregnant women and their fetuses are my specialty, you know."
"Have a good morning," Tony said. Steve could only nod in response instead of kiss him on the cheek like he wanted to, since Wilson was watching.
Tony nodded. "My father is the founder of Maria Stark Memorial hospital in Manhattan. Still owns and runs the place. Mom died when I was in college."
Tony raised a brow. “So, what department do you work in?”
The couple sat in the waiting room, holding their kitten, who looked better than the night before. It occurred to them that they couldn't bring Cheeseburger looking like a mess to the vet, so they had to give a very scared kitten a bath, which was extremely difficult for a couple of superheroes who didn't know one thing about having a pet.
"Somebody page Dr. Wilson!" Steve shouted as he entered the room. His hands were still shaking, but he felt a little more confident this time. Still, seeing her body shake violently made his stomach twist.
Tony scoffed. "Not everyone."
Sharon gave him a questionable look. The kind of look that clearly meant,
"It’s time to get up.” Tony’s fingers find Steve’s hair now, but Steve only grumbles.
Jesus, his voice was heavenly. Steve wanted to listen to him all day. He couldn't get his focus off the skin that was exposed; the man's button down was undone ever so slightly to reveal tanned skin that made Steve drool.
. (Very good rom com material, though.)
Sharon leaned on Steve. "It's a party, Steve. What would a party be without a little booze and dancing?"
Tony sat up and sighed. The melancholy expression on Pepper's face only furthered the guilt he felt in his heart.
Steve massaged his arm where Sharon gripped him. “Holy
"Totally."
"Rogers. This is me asking you out. To have a real date.
Steve can’t help but smile as Tony curls up against him in the sheets. He’s not really a morning person, but it’s days like these, seeing the same brunet pressed against him and exchanging sleepy kisses that make it okay again. Tony always makes everything better again.
The interns grew silent; adults waited years on the transplant list. Andy didn't have years to wait for a new heart. Pepper instructed the interns to inject more medicine, and start the ventilator again, and connect the baby to an ECMO machine. The sight of the child connected to so many machines brought Alex to tears.
"I like when you miss me," Tony replied, "but maybe—maybe we can slow down—"
"It was one mistake!"
"Will you please just drop it?" Steve quickly shut his chart. "You guys are always up my ass about Stark. We've got a ton of shit to do for Wilson, and he wants us in the pit today. Please, just leave it alone."
The others fidgeted a little, hiding the snacks and money. Steve shook his head in disgust. They came all this way, fighting to get into this program, only to make it into some sort of game? Ridiculous.
"He's a good cat," Tony admitted. "I can see why you and Pete love that furball so much."
One of the nurses handed him a gown, allowing Steve to get closer to the patient's exposed brain. Steve peered into the microscope and marveled at the small clot that was in Katie's brain. Tony carefully moved his instruments to the site of the clot, and Steve held his breath as it was removed. It was the simplest action, yet Steve found himself holding his breath, waiting and making sure he didn't hear any monitors going off. The small clot was removed, and just like that, Katie was going to be okay. No more seizures. The girl was okay.
"You sure about this?" Steve breathed.
"I was getting bored. The redhead came earlier to bring me ice chips, the hot soldier brought me a sandwich so I wouldn't call the chief, and the other girl was actually really nice. She sat with me the longest before she got a page. But now I'm bored, and I liked you the best out of everyone." Katie examined her nails. "Can you just sit with me?"
Steve chuckled as he connected her back to the monitors. "I graduated from Harvard, and I went to University of Pennsylvania," Steve began, "and you're asking me to figure out your TV?"
Sharon sighed, still looking pale. "I know, I just...I really put a tube in a ten year old's chest."
The person who he thought he would spend the rest of his life with.
"Just you and me, baby." Steve put on gloves and reached a finger in. "You are so new. You've got so much ahead of you..."
"He was the only one wearing them," Natasha said quickly, "it was the first thing I noticed."
But he wasn't going home to Tony.
He didn't realize how attached he was to the damned cat until he needed to step out and get dinner for himself.
“Well, aren’t you just the sweetest thing?” Tony sneered. “So sweet to everyone—me, your fucking girlfriend, every damn person in this hospital—it’s nice to know I can count on you pitying me from now on, Rogers.”
hard for Steve to hate her.
Bucky took the coffee from Steve's hand. As he took a sip, he shuddered. "This is just milk and sugar, where's the coffee?!"
"We'll be fine, right?" Nat's voice was quiet.
Alex could only nod in response as Steve led her back to the waiting room. She needed a break from all the machines and the wires for a while.
“Shut up, Barnes,” Sharon hissed. “He’s gonna come back soon, just act natural.”
Steve never drank a lot in college. He'd have his beers along with his buddies, but he paced himself better than everyone else that was drinking. The only time he ever really got wasted was years ago on his twenty-first birthday. The beers didn't seem to be working that much; he decided to take some shots.
"Don't say anything, okay?" This time, Pepper's voice wavered. Those beautiful blue eyes of hers were watering now, but still, she forced a smile. "I know, Tones."
After the surgery was a different story. By then, Pepper was cleaned up and getting ready for the conference room meeting with Fury and the other attendings. Tony had gone to the attending locker room, where Pepper was adjusting her lab coat. The neurosurgeon turned on his heel when her voice stopped him.
"Sharon." He tried taking in a breath, but it was like the air couldn't quite get into his lungs. "Let me just...let me go. I can't talk about this."
"Still in love with the intern."
Jake flashed him a fake smile before getting into a cab with a couple of his roommates. Steve leaned into the cab doors and looked at the driver. "He said he'd pay for this one."
He turned on the TV, mindlessly flipping through channels in hopes to find a show or movie to numb his brain before going to bed. After flicking through several channels, there was a rerun of one of the crime shows he liked watching. He tried to settle into his couch until he realized he had no idea how to relax.
"Get lucky, pal?" A man his age clapped his shoulder. Army tags hung around his neck. "I saw you running out of that bar. I hope you had a good time."
Before they stepped out of the car, Steve looked back at them.
"Don't throw up on any patients." Steve handed them more cups of coffee. "Sober up or Wilson will kill us."
Cheeseburger hopped into the counter this time, sitting right in front of the engineer. He meowed a little more delicately now instead of angrily. Tony rolled his eyes and scratched behind the kitten's ears. The kitten purred, briefly, but it was there.
Before Tony could get in a word, Steve had slipped into the OR. He stood in the back at first, joining the residents and other staff simply observing the surgery. Katie caught sight of the familiar blond and smiled.
Steve frowned but drank the water, enjoying the cool liquid; he didn't realize how much his throat burned until he finally dropped taking shots. But the world was too fuzzy, too blurry, and he knew that he wasn't just buzzed. He almost forgot the what it was like to be drunk; everything just felt quieter, and he felt warm.
"Me too—"
His voice cracked slightly on the last word, and the slightest hint of desperation lingered in the air. Steve's expression immediately softened, his eyes shifting away from Tony. The neurosurgeon felt his cheeks flush slightly, and his eyes were burning. He grabbed his white coat, ready to storm out of the room until the softness of Steve's voice stopped him in his tracks.
"You paged me 911 so I could talk to
Sharon looked at him curiously. "You are
"I'll see you at the party?" Her lips turned up ever so slightly, and Bucky would never admit it, but he swooned.
Cheeseburger meowed triumphantly, rousing laughter throughout the clinic. Tony couldn't help but chuckle too, seeing the cat in Steve's arms.
"Don't say my name." The intern tried hiding his smile. "I-I need to focus. I'm picking up a heart for a NICU baby."
Tony finds himself playing the same melodies for the blond, learning new songs when he discovers the music that Steve likes. Steve’s sketchbook is slowly filled with images of Tony’s hands, his fingers stretched over the keys, the way the sunlight in the room hits his nose and cheeks.
Steve reached a hand out, placing it in the space between them. Tony sighed and placed his hand on Steve's, scooting closer and closing the gap that separated them. The blond couldn't help himself, and soon, he was leaning on Tony's shoulders. Another scalpel in his chest, but at least he could let himself feel close to Tony one last time.
He wasn't one for one night stands, either. At least, not anymore. His college days definitely had the occasional late night quickie—those days had passed. While he wasn't usually the type to try and meet someone at the bar, the way Steve had been ogling him that night drove him
The blurry figures of the interns became clearer as they made their way toward his group. Rhodey quickly glanced as his friend, noticing the drunken smile Tony wore. The trauma surgeon grabbed Tony’s arm as a silent warning and shot him a glare—
Steve’s vision is a little watery, but he smiles at Tony anyway. “You sound like a shitty teen romance novel.”
“Yes.
Her face hardened. "You're right. The problem was just between you and me. I made a mistake, but I am not the only reason our marriage is falling apart."
"I'm not proud of it!" Tony yelled. "Do you think I wanted to be a secretive asshole to the one person who made me feel like myself for a change? Do you think I came to the decision lightly, Steve? Believe me, lying to you was the worse mistake I have ever, ever made. You can be pissed if you want, but you aren't the only one with feelings, here."
And Tony’s smiling now, feeling Steve pressing his face on his back. He never gets tired the pretty blonde clinging to him and begging him to go back to bed.
Dr. Pepper Potts-Stark impressed many of the interns and residents on her first day. Despite the gossip that followed her, she was a great doctor. Both Laura Peterson and her baby sustained extreme injuries, but Pepper had fixed them up perfectly. Many babies and their mothers would not have been so lucky to survive an accident that severe with just any OB-GYN or neonatal surgeon; the staff at Chicago Medical were more than just impressed. They were starstruck.
“You’re always giving up,” Tony snapped, “You never give me one chance—“
"I thought we were going to the pit," Steve said, surprised.
Tony traced his finger tips on the back of Steve's hands. "
"I had to do the lovely walk of shame from your apartment to mine, so yes, I do know where you are, Steve."
"That was amazing."
They passed a nursing station yet again, and Katie groaned. Taking pity on the lost intern, one of the nurses called to Steve.
"And what was this little guy's name?" The young woman at the desk asked.
The view of the quad is breathtaking, and Steve can’t help but smile as he peers out the window. It looks like something out of a movie, with the bustle of students and the leaves fluttering past them as they get to class.
Steve smirked. "
"Steve, I'm sorry everything got out of hand—"
"After a good night's
No one seemed to want to breathe or move an inch. They were all captivated as Bucky made the first cut into the sterile skin, surprised by the small amounts of blood that flowed after the incision was made. Seeing the flesh was so different from what they'd seen in models and anatomy text books.
The intern fidgeted slightly, not daring to open his mouth.
"Let's go eat. You need to be strong for her." Steve pulled her up from the chair, letting her arms slide into his.
"Y-yes, sir?"
Bucky glared at him. "Dude, what the hell?"
Tony seemed to move effortlessly. The scrub nurses and the resident next to him seemed to know what he was going to ask for next; whatever he needed, it was already in his hand. Even when Katie's stats started fluctuating, Tony was perfectly calm. All the staff seemed to move fluidly around him, pushing medication when needed and backing off when the coast was clear. Once the clot was finally in sight, Steve was jolted out of his silent awe when Tony called his name.
"Excited to see your first surgery?"
"Buck, come on, she wasn't a baby—"
And of course, how is he ever going to say no when the love of his life, pouting and pleading with those pretty blue eyes?
"So, that was the big bad ex, huh?"
Steve slouched onto the couch next to the teenager and sighed. "Yeah, I thought so, too."
"You're going to be fine, you know." She poked him with her pencil when he didn't respond. "The chief will be in there, so will Dr. Wilson. You know how to do an appendectomy. We've been studying for hours."
“That was really good.”
Summer in Chicago quickly faded into autumn, and soon, the leaves fluttered down in wonderful hues of gold and maroon. Every time the chill returned to the Windy City, Steve adored the change; as much he loved summer, the coming months made the city beautiful.
Tony met Steve's eyes, silently urging, pleading.
"We're supposed to be giving a heart to a preemie today," Steve said, panicked. "I-I took the elevator to meet the procurement team. The baby needed the heart, like yesterday—"
It’s what Steve wanted to do on their first date. It was almost two years ago now; Steve thought it would be fun since he just got his license. They didn’t even watch the movie that night (
In hindsight, staying home would have been a better idea. Tony knew that his best friend had the best intentions, but now that he was finally at the party, he wanted to be anywhere else.
"Remind me to shut my mouth when Wilson's talking," Bucky muttered as he closed his eyes, "He hears everything."
"Tones. Don't be mad." Rhodey studied his best friend's face. "I didn't say anything about why you left. I only said it was leave of absence. After that, I got a call asking if you were hired by Nick Fury. I only responded yes, then they stopped calling me."
"Was it...? Was it him?" Natasha gasped as Steve's complexion gave the answer away. "It was
The bartender smiled and filled a cup with water. "Finish this first and we'll see."
The interns fell silent, and Steve shot them a look. They pretended to be interested in their charting or the computers that they sat at. Steve sighed.
"I'm trying to be a better man, I have to keep my word, right?" Tony nodded. "Anything you want."
Pretty blondes with blue eyes? He was a
Tony sat idly in one of the on-call rooms, one away from the surgical and trauma units. He wasn't usually like this, checking his pager every five minutes. For the first time in years, he felt nervous. The same nervous energy that he felt when he was young suddenly rushed through his body. Maybe this is what Steve has been feeling all day, too. He didn't think he could make someone so nervous, but then again, it had been years since he met someone new.
"Are you going to see Dr. Stark tonight?"
“Tony,” Rhodey warned, “I think it’s time for a glass of water.”
Tony didn't respond, keeping his lips busy so that he wouldn't have to answer. He lifted her gently, setting her down on the couch in the lounge before shutting the door. He kissed again, slower, softer. Pepper had wrapped her arms and legs around him now, pulling him closer and closer, but the waves of pain his chest didn't subside.
For a split second, there was a pause in conversation, and the excess of alcohol in Tony’s system decided it was the perfect time to introduce himself to Eva.
On the morning that Tony needed to sign Pepper's divorce papers, he was already running late to the hospital. As he scrambled around his apartment, there was a knock at the door. He was surprised to find that a young lawyer was handing him a rather thick manila envelope. She said something to him, something about returning the papers through the mail, but he wasn’t really paying attention at that point. The neurosurgeon knew exactly what he was holding in his hands.
The soldier left the table first, with Natasha following. Steve grinned as she left with Bucky and gave her a thumbs up. Sharon slapped Steve's hands, giggling as Natasha gave him the finger in response. Once they were gone, Sharon laid back in the chair.
“You knew?!”
"You're gonna be safe and sound here, little man," Steve cooed, "we'll feed you fancy fish, maybe we can get the kid to buy you some catnip! The good stuff, you know..."
"Oh, so you're staying here? For...a while?" Steve felt like kicking his own ass just hearing himself speak.
"A kid was saved today," Steve said gently, "It wasn't a complete loss."
Katie reached out for Steve's hand and squeezed. "Thank you for saving me."
"We have to save this mother so she can see her baby afterwards." Tony shook the excess water off his hands.
Tony was impressed by the intern. He knew that Steve was going to make a great doctor; today's events proved that. He was engrossed as Steve talked about himself, enjoying the inevitable rosy color that crept up on his cheeks every now and again.
The intern nodded and left before Tony could utter anything else. All of his dread and anger that kept him frozen and stiff all day seemed to melt away the moment Steve grinned. That heart-wrenching, slightly crooked, take-your-breath-away kind of smile that only Steve had. It was genuine, not the smug look from before. That goddamn smile, the one he hadn't seen in a while—at least not directed at  him these days—left him in a goddamn puddle.
Tony grinned at the blond. "You think so?"
Tony held his head in his hands. "It's not that. The date was great, and you're great, I'm just—"
Tony had no idea why he went to the damn holiday party that night.
"What brings you to Chicago? What happened to San Francisco?"
Tony ended up coming home with a cat car seat, extra toys and treats, and two cheeseburgers. The cat wouldn't sit still during the car ride, and Tony was horrified that Cheeseburger would go flying through the window if he hit the brakes too hard.
Steve smirked. "It's...cute, actually."
Pepper sighed. "Alright. I'll update the on-call surgeon. Don't be afraid to page or anything."
Honestly, everyone finding out about the relationship with Stark wouldn't have bothered Steve. It would have been annoying to deal with the initial gossip and the stares. There were so many people working at this hospital; the odds of people not hooking up or dating were unlikely. People would talk about him and Tony but eventually move on— there was always something going on in the hospital.
Steve began chasing after Sharon before he was cut off by Tony's arm blocking the way. Steve rolled his eyes as he was quickly directed to a stairwell around the corner. Tony kissed the blond's cheek and was surprised to be met with a bit of hesitation.
Steve mumbles something in response, pulling the covers of his head and moving closer to Tony. His golden strands are disheveled and perfect, and Tony swoons as the soldier’s grip around his waist tightens.
"You never sit and listen," Tony groaned, "it's always game over with you! Quit running for once and just listen for God's sake—"
Tony sighed just as dramatically as before, only this time laying on Steve's lap and feigning a somber expression on his face. "You love dogs more than me."
"But I—"
"Katie's case is pretty interesting." Steve inched away from the gorgeous surgeon. "She seems to like you."
“Listen to your girlfriend, she’s gotta get back soon, it’s a school night,” Tony snapped.
"Mom," Steve said through gritted teeth, "There was the mixer, and I-I went out with some friends, and Wilson was kicking my ass—"
"I just need to check on Katie, chart," Steve said quickly, "I, um, I hope you don't mind—"
me. Seriously."
"I wish I had that in my life," Steve admitted, "at least one more time."
"Why don't we take a break?" The counselor looked like she needed it more than anyone else. Their session had another half hour to go, but she looked as if she'd heard them fighting for hours. The couple agreed and the counselor excused herself. Tony left the room as well, heading immediately to the coffee cart in the lobby. Pepper followed him, hissing in his ear.
"Hmm...not enough."
Steve daydreamed about the strawberry blonde as he floated from patient to patient, taking orders from nurses and the resident on call. Sharon pulled him aside when the chaos died down a bit, as the last car accident victim was checked in and admitted. They wandered into one of the supply closets.
One day, Peter brought a damned cat to the tower.
Teenagers were fucking
What could go wrong?
"I know." Steve smirked a little. "You guys are a pain in the ass, though."
"Shut up, Rogers. I'll see you at the apartment."
Steve took a step back and forced a smile. "I know. It'll all be fine. I just get panicky, but I'm fine."
"Hey, Jackson. I'm Steve. And this is my friend, Sharon. We're going to help you."
The daydreaming quickly ended as a young woman approached the table. The interns hushed as the woman smiled and greeted them all. Her eyes were only on one intern in particular, and somehow, the sight made Tony’s blood boil. Steve immediately stood up to say hello, blushing and stumbling over his words. The woman pursed her lips, as if trying not to laugh at the adorably awkward intern in front of her. She held up a paper bag, offering what seemed to be a late dinner for all the interns. The group immediately welcomed Steve’s friend to the table, and together they enjoyed a fast food dinner. The blond’s friends tried to hide their grins, failing miserably. Steve paid them no mind, since his eyes were trained on the girl.
"Tommy keeps crashing," Nat explained. "Dr. Danvers said she didn't think it would get this bad so quickly. They need a heart today."
"And you're defending him?" She let go of his hand.
Bucky nodded quickly, following the chief's instructions as best as he could. After more suction and tying off what had been cut, the bleeding stopped. The abdomen was clear, and the stump of the appendix was pushed back into the intestine. It had suddenly occurred to Bucky that he had been sweating profusely, enough to dampen his scrub cap.
Before anyone else could refute, Wilson passed the locker room and glared at the interns. The gang was quick to follow their chief resident, silently following him to their first patient to round on. Steve was just thankful he didn’t have to offer any more explanation.
Tony smiled sadly. "Right."
"It's not!" Steve exclaimed. "No, listen, I-I like you, Tony. I just didn't think you'd like me too. I mean have you
Bucky came around the corner with two beers beer in hand and wrapped his arm around Natasha, who leaned against him. Steve raised his eyebrows at the soldier and smirked.
, Steve—we should be actually finishing the breakfast we made, staying on the phone for hours because neither of us have the heart to hang up first, then you ask me to go steady with you—ugh,
. You know, the steady dating type of date. All you gotta do is say yes."
"How about you be the guy from the bar and the guy in my apartment?"
Before Tony could answer, the elevator doors opened to the lobby of the hospital. Firefighters and maintenance staff cheered in triumph once the finally got the doors to function.
"Even if you loved me, you still picked
wanted to be friends," Steve retorted, "I was just so sick of feeling sad all the fucking time that I just agreed! If it were up to me, I wouldn't be friends, I wouldn't have met you that night, and I wouldn't be in this mess!"
"What if she—"
"It's great," Steve replied as he sat down. He could feel that Tony was nervous, and honestly, it made him feel a little better. He wasn't the only one shitting his pants out of sheer anxiety.
"Hey." She squeezed his arm. "Steve, um, do you want me to run and get you some coffee?"
(Hint: He did.)
"They aren't here," Tony insisted, "I know you understand me. They'll be home in a few days."
Her hands found his hair, and she sighed in content when she felt the familiar scratch of his stubble on her neck. She couldn't help the soft moans that escaped her lips, only encouraging Tony.
Steve rolls his eyes, but the fond smile on his face is enough to make Tony’s heart ache.
He didn't want to go to the bar at first. He needed a night of relaxing—or at least a night of sitting in front of the TV and doing nothing—to get over the fact that he was going to be a real doctor. Not just wearing a lab coat and following around doctors in a hospital; he was going to be the doctor this time. Sure, he was an intern, but he still had the degree—Steve Rogers, MD.
Tony was the best boyfriend Steve had ever had. Not that he’d had that many, just two before Tony, but he was the best one. He was thoughtful and considerate. The sort of person who wanted to put Steve’s happiness above all else and apart from Bucky and his Ma, Steve had never really had that. He wasn’t used to people thinking about ways to make him happy. But Tony thought about it all the time and did everything he could to make it happen.

“I’m not allowed on any new stories till I submit the ones I have already. Something about holding me accountable and keeping me on track or whatever. Blah blah blah. Like I’m not working twice as many stories as anyone else in the office. And as if I wasn’t gonna go on a writing binge soon to send a whole shit load of stories to be torn apart and vetted for publishing.” The brunet complains quietly, taking his phone back after Pepper has finished scrolling through the article.
Tony though, well he loved with his whole fucking heart and everything else that mattered. It was why he’d always been so afraid to really get attached to someone else after his romance with Pepper had fizzled out. They had managed to come out of that friends but only through actual hard work had they managed to salvage their relationship. To still maintain that affection that they had started out with before they’d gotten lost in their romance. Their relationship had burned to the ground with the same intensity and passion that had brought them together in the first place. They had been a fiery couple. A couple that didn’t compromise and gave themselves everything they wanted.
“Carol—” Rhodey began as he moved over to comfort his patient but Carol’s words halted him before he could finish.
“More importantly, the one who never ceases to get into trouble trying to chase down a story lead.”
“Alright let’s make this quick people, we don’t have all day! Let’s get started-- Entertainment, start pitching.” Fury said while leaning back in his chair, it was surprising to Tony that the other man still hadn’t managed to fall backwards.
He was going to die in a Hydra cell choking on his own breath.
“We all tell ourselves that but in that moment it’s probably different. I’m not entirely sure that I would tell them. I’d be reluctant to do so.”
9:51 PM · Oct 3, 2020
Tony huffed but pulled himself onto the window ledge before throwing a leg over it to get out the window. As Tony was pulling himself through the window, the door to the room bursts open and the Captain is soon trapped in a fight against five other men. Tony watches from his perch on the window with half his body out the window. It would be amusing if not for the fact that he was being rescued from being captured for too much curiosity.
Steve spent most of his time working on his art. He wanted to make something beautiful and useful. Something that could have more than artistic value. If anyone could find a way to make art about social justice without losing sight of the beauty of the art itself then it definitely had to be Steven Grant Rogers. Bucky and Sam loved to joke that Steve was the only serious art major in their entire school and if Steve was honest they probably weren’t wrong. He made art for classes, he made art for shows, he made art for nonprofits, and charity auctions. Whatever needed another submission to get it going and it helped a little that his art was pretty good. People liked it and kept liking it enough to want more of it. So Steve made more and more and that’s how he met Tony.
Then again all their patients were admirable for braving the Hanahaki disease and choosing the pain over the loss. Tony certainly wouldn’t do the same. This sort of pain was self-inflicted beyond the initial flower and while love was a beautiful thing that didn’t mean it was worth dying for in this way. That had always been Tony’s way of thinking and as the time went by and more patients of his chose to take death over their feelings it cemented his way of thinking.
Steve, like Charles, was in love with someone and suffering the consequences of that and Tony was interacting with him as if he was simply a guy he was getting to know. He was acting like Steve was a potential partner in some distant future. When he’d taken a wrong turn onto the wrong path he didn’t know but Steve had certainly just reminded him of how unavailable he was.
“You’re right Stark, it’s stupid to chase after them. But I do agree that you’ll definitely sell papers if you go after this story. Just try not to get killed. I still expect all your other stories to be ready for editing and publishing by the end of tomorrow before you can start. Otherwise you’re off the story. Clear?”
Tony couldn’t get in the way of that.
“Carol first then,” Tony said and followed after Rhodey to go see their patient.
Because it turns out that Tony's growing closeness with the Captain hadn't gone unnoticed. If the quiet footsteps trailing him near constantly was anything to go by. Every time that Tony would turn around to see who was following him though he would find nothing out of the ordinary. Just his fellow New Yorkers going about their days but he could feel the presence.
“Good. We’ll get the hostages out of here and take care of the rest. Winter, Falcon get the hostages out of here. Widow and I will take care of any remaining thugs.” The Captain responds.
," Katie scoffed, "I'm a flyer. They throw me around at practice."
Steve's day dreaming was interrupted by the same redhead from last night. She nudged him a little and smiled. "Hey. Rounds are soon. They're assigning residents."
He really mentioned
Steve scoffed. "C'mon Ma, it was not that obvious."
He could have left it alone. He could have said nothing, he could have just left the fucking room and gone back to charting somewhere else in the hospital. But, for some reason, the way that Steve was looking at him with such a smug look on his face, he snapped.
“I’m going to miss you.” Tony curls in against Steve, holding him close against his chest. The simple action usually made Steve swoon, but right now, it’s breaking his heart.
Steve tried to focus on the patients. Dr. Potts-Stark was double-board certified, so the interns got to deal with the pregnant mothers as well as the pre-mature babies in the NICU. The preemie babies always tugged on the heartstrings more than the babies that were carried to term; they were tinier, weaker. Surgeries that were performed on them often took a bit longer to recover due to their size.
“Steve,” Eva said gently, “it’s okay, let’s get back to our table.”
"You guys made fun of me for being so into Stark, but here you are drooling all over your locker."
"I'll have to do a physical," Steve said between kisses to his chest, "make sure everything is alright..."
"Just wanted a change of pace," Tony lied, "New York is boring. Chicago is my latest adventure."
"What?!"
The moment she walked away, all the interns stood slack-jawed. Steve pursed his lips together and quickly paid the annoyed cashier so they could finally get out of the store. As they exited the store, Nat slapped the blond's arm.
"Ready for your craniotomy?"
"I'm going to be fine." Steve sighed. "I just—I really liked him. I kinda thought, that maybe he'd be—I don't know. It's stupid."
? Did you want me, or was I just a good fuck, something to fool around with while you recovered from being fucked over? I-I want to know. I want to know why I'm enduring all this hell, every goddamn day, and you look at me like I still owe you something. Like I'm supposed to say sorry or something. Like I shouldn't be upset or hurt."
Sharon squeezed Alex's hand. "There's a heart for your baby. The cell towers must be going haywire with the storm. I'm sure Steve is protecting that tiny heart with his life."
. He couldn't remember ever being this annoying. Maybe he was too much of a band nerd who was stuck either in the library or in the band room to be annoying, but he surely was not as annoying as a bratty girl calling 911 for no reason. He was a doctor, not a babysitter.
The neurosurgeon sulked in one of the empty units that he had already cleaned himself and continued his pre-op notes for the surgeries he would be doing the following day. He had been so focused on his charting that he nearly fell off the bed in surprise as Steve entered the room.
“I agree.”
The interns looked curiously at Katie, who looked exasperated. Her arms were folded, clearly irritated with the two of them.
Avoiding the neurosurgeon didn't get any easier at work, either. Tony tried surprising him at first, with coffee just the way he liked it, or his favorite pastries from the bakery down the street. There was a bit more hope in Tony's eyes, like there was still something to salvage. Steve wanted to have the same hope, too.
Steve had spent the better part of a year trying to get over that girl. They had met during undergrad; they were both tutors for the science department. Steve had always teased that she should pursue medicine like he was—she always claimed that she wasn't as smart as him.
Ever since the night they kissed, Steve wanted to be angry. He wanted to hate Tony, he wanted to be disgusted any time he saw him across the hall. He didn't want to pine or miss him anymore. Nothing really went as planned anymore. Not these days, at least.
Tony originally planned to cook breakfast and have a cute first date, then leave. It was supposed to be mature but still have the thrill of being with someone new, and it was going to be perfect. The morning was supposed to be casual, but instead, Tony found himself naked next to the intern, who was passed out next to him. Steve was curled up beside him, golden strands beautifully mussed, lips pink and a tad bit swollen. He smirked to himself when he saw the bruising on Steve's chest, the redness baring great contrast the blond's fair complexion.
“I miss you, too.”
The residents and interns seemed to pick up on his sour mood, and almost everyone scurried away after consultations or showing lab results. Noticing his friend’s odd behavior during the morning staff meeting, Rhodey decided to bring coffee before their trauma in the ER. Instead of being met with the usual enthusiasm for caffeine, Tony was silent.
There was something unnerving about the envelope, sitting on his counter surrounded by empty coffee cups and clutter. Tony almost expected there to be a note inside the folder, a secret message from Pepper. Maybe an note, maybe a goodbye letter. He wasn’t exactly sure what he wanted or even expected when he finally looked at the papers, but he didn’t think it would be so cold. Concise. Years of marriage and memories, all split up and wrapped up nicely in a plain manila envelope.
“Just give me another minute, I don’t want to wait until tomorrow,” Tony insists, still facing the prototype design that stands before him. He shudders in surprise when he feels Steve’s lips pressed against the back of his neck, gently feathering them across his skin.
Steve frowned. "Nat—"
Sarah waved her hand. "Oh, honey, you cannot tell me you haven't been drooling over that man the moment you laid eyes on him."
"Maybe your party will make you feel better," Steve teased.
Fury continued his introduction to the rest of the doctors in the room, listing off the residents and other physicians that worked closely with the surgical unit. Tony seemed to charm nearly every one of the residents he shook hands with; the only ones who remained neutral were the attendings.
"Good to see you, Dr. Stark."
The interns were on trauma and neuro rotation for the first few months of their internship, and now their latest rotation was cardiothoracic surgery. This excited Natasha the most; she couldn't stop babbling that entire morning.
"Hey, bud," Steve said gently, "What's your name?"
"Free drinks at Joe's if I'm wrong."
She tossed a folder at him, laughing as the files scattered and Steve was left to pick them up. He didn't mind the mess—it felt nice to be making a friend in all this. He liked Natasha. She was intense and definitely could kick his ass, but he trusted her.
The stranger doesn’t come back for a while. He tries not to be discouraged about it, but still, he wishes he said something more to the stranger. It was nice to be admired, even in that small moment.
By the time Steve finished, he heard some rustling in the bedroom. Goddammit. He'd been hoping the model would just sneak out in the time he was gone, like any other late-night hookup was supposed to do (although, it wasn't like he knew what late-night hookups did). He took a deep breath, facing the still nameless man that stood before him.
He was barely thinking now, which wasn't exactly a good idea since he was driving in the rain and was about to pick up Pepper from her apartment. They didn't spend the night together—it definitely would not have been a good idea—but she suggested they get to work together. The counselor insisted that they started doing things as a couple, becoming the team that they used to be.
"Eva."
Finally he stood up, carefully sneaking out of the bedroom to get into the shower. The young doctor couldn't help but take another look at him, admiring the toned muscles that lay exposed. Just remembering how the man's skin felt under his fingertips was last night was enough to make him drool.
"I wish I hated you for that." Pepper sniffled and quickly wiped tears away. "I wish I could hate you, and then I would leave this damn city and go back home."
, Sharon have you been working out or something—“
"Hey Buck," Steve said as he took a beer, "Quite the party you put together."
"Shouldn't I swear off dating for a while?" Steve said in exasperation, "maybe I'll take up a new hobby or something."
There was one day where all the interns happened to have their day off at the same time; a rarity, since the interns were usually worked until they dropped.  The interns took it upon themselves to run errands, do groceries, and take care of themselves since it had been weeks or possibly months without a proper day off. Usually, days off were accompanied by their pagers going off incessantly. Attendings loved leaving early and making the interns do some of the dirty work.
"You said you loved me." Pepper was angry now. There were still tears, but her eyes burned this time. "It might feel like a lifetime ago, but once, you said you loved me. For better or for worse, Tony, please, this is the worst of it. There will be better after this if you'd just listen to me!"
Steve waved. "Don't give Dr. Stark a hard time, okay?"
Tony laughed before he was interrupted by Steve unbuckling his pants. He tilted his head back and relaxed.
He sat himself in his usual corner of the cafeteria, where there were enough plants to hide behind when needed. During the day, so many staff hunted him down for consults and recommendations, and if Tony had surgery, he had absolutely no time to engage in an hour long conversation. Luckily, there weren’t many people in the cafeteria anyway, so he had a bit of peace to himself that night.
Steve really liked detective drama shows. Whether they were extremely over the top or based on true crime, the shows were his guilty pleasure. Any chance that he got a break from his studies or work, he would be curled up on the couch and binging episodes that he missed.
Steve laughed, thankful that he felt just a bit of relief. "Thanks, Ma. I love you."
"Steve." Tony's voice cracked again. "I need you to believe me. I want to be with you. Hell, I wanted it from the first date we went on. Please, believe me." Tony looked so hopeful for a moment, Steve almost wanted to believe him.
Tony leaned back and sighed. The truth could wait a night.
The child kept a steady hand on Steve, as if she wasn't quite ready to let go. Steve needed to check on other patients in the NICU, but he couldn't let go either. Babies were a good distraction. A cute, heart-wrenching distraction.
The nurse smiled. "Radiology is on the fourth floor, honey. When you get off the elevator, turn left."
"It's okay," Eva reassured him. "My quick little McDonalds breakfast made up for it. Promise."
Even with Dr. Rhodes by their side, the interns found it impossible to find the right words to tell the Sanchez family that their little girl did not survive the car crash. She was the only one in the car who did not make it. Steve felt sick to his stomach watching the mother fall apart in Bucky's arms.
“You better get to sleep. Don’t know why you stay up so late all the time.”
Their first day at the hospital was definitely an interesting one.
"Pete, buddy, can't you take him to a shelter? There are lots of people who'd love to adopt him, and we-we can't have a cat." Tony sat down next to the kid on the couch, trying not to look at the cat, who seemingly had the same, heartbroken expression.
Tony groaned. "You said that you wanted to be friends! Why are you so damn bitter all the time? I am going out on a limb to try and make this easier for you—"
Tony smirked. "Why are you paying attention to me being sick?"
"I-I hope that's okay."
(See the end of the chapter for
"He doesn't like me," Tony said simply, "but you and Pete adore him, so that's fine by me."
"Actually," Tony chimed in, locking eyes with the intern, "if you'll excuse us, Dr. Wilson, but I do need to speak with Dr. Rogers—"
Tony could feel Steve's uneasiness whenever he stepped out of the room to take a call. Even when he'd assure the blond that he was just taking a private call about a consult, he knew Steve was curious. Although he was getting normal calls from his parents or friends, he felt the need to cover himself. After one little white lie, they just kept coming.
It might have been the alcohol, the nerves about his first day of work, nerves about never doing anything fun in his life, but he felt a surge of confidence.
Steve gave the brunet a stern look and crossed his arms.
"He eats right out of your hand but runs away when I feed him," Tony whined, "I'm telling you. The cat hates me."
He needed the distraction. The past few weeks included calls and text messages from Tony, begging, pleading just to talk to him. He hated declining them, but he felt justified for doing it. It wasn't like Steve was trying to be petty; how do you respond to someone having a wife and being lied to about it?
Nat reached for his arm tentatively, and Bucky relaxed a little bit. "Hey. I know it's hard, but it won't be a total loss if that little girl's heart goes to someone else. C'mon, let's go tell Danvers and Rhodes about the situation."
"You aren't alone, okay?" Steve faced her smiled. "You've got us. Your baby is strong, and you are, too. You aren't alone in this, I promise."
"You'll have plenty of opportunities to fool around with your attending in an on-call room, Rogers." Tony chuckled when Steve flushed rouge again. "Go on, then. Your shift isn't over."
Tony felt like there were cement blocks attached to his feet. He couldn't bring himself to move from his spot in the trauma room. All he could look at was Steve and the look of horror that spread across his face the minute Pepper said her name. All the dread that been consuming his thoughts in the last few weeks was no longer just a nightmare, it was a dream come true.
There was a delicious ache between his legs when he remembered that morning's events.
The blond was speechless. "Yeah. Totally."
As Steve scrubbed out, Tony joined him once more.
The neurosurgeon sunk back into the bed. “Where’s...everyone?”
." Steve took the chart and left the NICU before she could see that he was red in the face with anger.
Still, the change of pace was nice. It was a new adventure.
Steve barely spoke above a whisper this time. "Do you love me now?"
Tony immediately walked into the blond's open arms, breathing in the familiar smell that he adored so much. He grinned into his husband's lips once he felt the scratch of stubble. Tony sighed, letting his hands wander a little and eliciting a chuckle from the supersoldier.
, we see each other, we go on dates, he sleeps on my couch sometimes—"
“You felt bad for me?” For a split second, Tony looked like a lost puppy.
a lot?"
The next morning, all the interns were startled by the sound of their pagers going off. Steve heard the others groan upon hearing the incessant beeping. The blond forced himself off the couch and turned on the coffee maker.
Steve rolled his eyes and smirked a little. "Why do you do that?"
Steve only nodded in response, letting Pepper and Alex take a closer look at the child. Alex's eyes watered a little upon seeing all the tubes and wires that were connected to her baby. Pepper explained that they were all helpful to the baby's development, but no parent ever listened, not really. The medical jargon was already hard enough to understand, and parents were far too focused on their child to think about anything else.
Steve nodded and followed her into the scrub room. He tried not to focus on anything else other than the case, but all he could think about was the fact that as Pepper walked past the scrub room, even her lab coat read the same name on the OR board.
He said
"Oh, absolutely. You got me, Tony. I'm about to divorce you and adopt all the stray dogs in the city." Steve carded his fingers through Tony's hair, chuckling when the infamous pout grew on his face.
Alex nodded. "Okay, Dr. Rogers. Thank you."
It was strange, sitting around and calling around for baby hearts. Andy needed one so badly, but it was a bit disheartening to think about another baby having to die for one to be available.
The intern's eyes narrowed. "Anything?"
Several weeks had passed since the last time he had spoken to Steve.  Sure, they had to interact with each other at work, but their interactions were mostly the same awkward pleasantries and updates about mutual patients. There was a twinge in Tony’s chest every time he realized he couldn’t remember the last time they had a normal conversation.
"Steve—"
"I, well—"
"He bought you a drink, too." The bartender was hesitant at first. "Why don't you go on and talk to him before taking another beer?"
"You don't have to leave just yet," Steve mumbled, "you can stay here and let me do all the work."
"Fine, fine." The neurosurgeon chuckled. "Pepper... she's my family. We've been together for years. Years of birthdays, Thanksgivings, and Christmases with someone is hard to just...throw away."
“Not a soft spot like I’m still pining, or something. You know what I meant.”
Natasha and Bucky immediately went to the older sister, leaving Sharon and Steve with the much younger patient. He looked no older than ten years old, but his injuries suggested that he was sitting in the front when he wasn't supposed to. Steve tried to ignore his irritation after he noticed the fleeting frown on Sharon's face.
"This is Alex," Pepper said, "I know it's a bit early to see her baby, but I thought we could break the rules a little bit."
The look of horror on Steve's face must have been obvious because the neurosurgeon immediately frowned. Steve cleared his throat and put the notepad in his pocket.
Tony froze. "I want to, Steve, but that doesn't just happen right away. Plus she's still here, and I don't—"
The blond sat beside Bucky and Natasha, exhausted from racing up the stairs and into the gallery. Natasha looked at him curiously.
It’s him, fingers extended as he plays the exact piano that stands before him. The details are so intricate, so exact, Tony wonders for a moment of someone had taken a photograph of him; it’s so perfect, it’s surreal. The way his hair falls, the way his glasses slip on his nose as he looks down at the notes, the way his fingers curl against the black and ivory keys; it’s breathtaking.
"Which brings me to the reason why we're here," Natasha explained. "We want to be your roommates."
Now, it was six in the morning, with their shift ending in two hours. The four miserable interns were camped out in the basement, where they were blessed extra beds and gurneys to lounge around on. Sharon and Natasha were dutifully filling out charts, trying to suppress their yawns. The boys had just returned after a splendid early morning of rectal exams. Wilson was in a horrible mood after being called in to an emergency appendectomy, and Steve and Bucky were his victims that morning.
"Steve, will you go steady with me?" Tony squeezed Steve's hand.
He sighed and stood up. “I’m sorry for raising my voice I’m just...tired. I don’t know what to do, and I just want to forget about it right now.”
"Killing you," Tony repeated. He chuckled quietly. "At least you're honest."
It wasn't there.
"Damn, Dr. Blondie."
For once, Steve just wanted something to work out. Nothing that began with a horrible one night stand, nothing that involved beautiful wives and heartbreaking endings, none of that "right person wrong time" bullshit—
“No more studying?”
Steve sighed and grabbed more blankets. "Kid in bed five said he was cold. I gotta go."
The orange furball pawed at one of the doors in the apartment, hissing angrily when Tony shot him a glance.
Eventually, Steve met his friends at the checkout lanes. He was practically throwing the groceries down for the cashier. Sharon looked at the blond curiously.
Aside from her skill, she charmed everyone she met. No matter the rumors that floated around that first day, she managed to win the hearts of staff and patients alike. It only took a day, but word passed along that Dr. Potts-Stark was one of the nicest surgeons on the unit. It took one day.
And then, of course, medical school happened.
"I'd buy you another, but I think you're better off with water."
"No, I am," Tony replied. "Just...thankful for you. Or whatever."
"Did you see that they made chili today?" Natasha said. "I know you said it was your favorite."
"Rogers! Barnes! Answer Rhodes' page. And call Danvers again before you get down there!"
So, yeah. He was allowed to be not good and not boring with an extremely handsome neurosurgeon waiting for him in the on-call room.
Tony chuckled a little but didn't say anything more as the interns scurried back to the tunnels in the basement. Steve glanced over his shoulder, his heart aching to see that Tony was watching him as they left.
The things he did for this damn cat.
"Can she feel any of this?"
He opened his eyes, meeting the same brown eyes that he woke up to this morning. The same salt-and-pepper hair. The navy blue button down was replaced navy blue scrubs and a white lab coat. Since he was an attending, his lab coat had his name stitched into it: Anthony Stark, MD.
The teenager clicked her tongue and examined her nails. "You're lost. I'm going to die in this hospital because a cute but stupid doctor couldn't get me to get my scans. I'm supposed to be at a competition right now."
After clearing every cabinet and drawer, double, triple checking every goddamn inch of the kitchen, Tony returns to the bedroom, defeated. Steve shifts a little, moving the blankets to welcome the grumpy engineer back to bed.
petty.
And yes. Tony fell in love with that damn cat and that damn dog.
Tony understood the skepticism. He was yet another person in the running for chief of surgery.
probably wouldn't enjoy that, now would she?"
“Goodnight, Steve.”
"You got the surgery!" Natasha exclaimed.
Steve barely looked up from his chart. "What's up?"
“Right.” She studied his face, looking for the familiar rouge that used to creep up on Steve’s face when they would talk about the neurosurgeon. There wasn’t a trace of the blush, but she was certain to get to the bottom of what Steve was hiding.
"There's no heart, is there?" The anxious mother tried to take deep breaths. "It's been twenty minutes but no one's paged or called about the heart."
"Thank you for our almost date," Steve blurted out, "it was really nice."
(See the end of the chapter for
Rhodey bid Tony goodnight, and it was time for the neurosurgeon to prep for surgery. Tony met Steve in the scrub room. The intern no longer had a look of surprise like he did the first few times he saw Tony, but the inevitable pink rose again from his neck all the way to his cheeks.
Steve checked his pager, raising his eyebrows. "Our pagers aren't even going off—"
Tony steadied the intern's shoulders. "Breathe, Steve. It's going to be alright. I'm sure there are generators that help this thing power up. Everything will be fine."
"What about
Tony turned around and covered the pan of eggs he was cooking. "I like you, Steve. I'm not just trying to screw around or anything."
But it was kind of nice, being Tony's friend. Almost-friend. They had normal conversations, there were no more longing glances from the stations or awkward meet-ups in on-call rooms.
"You can't hug me either." Steve stepped back, forcing himself to smile. "I love and appreciate you, Sharon, but..."
Moment ruined.
Thankfully, the hospital was close enough for him to walk to. He had missed Chicago. His undergrad and medical school career had sent him out to the east coast. He liked it at first, liked the change of pace, the atmosphere. During his undergrad, the initial hype of New York City had eventually faded away. Sure, it was exciting, so many people to see and to meet, but it was the same tourists and the same bustle and sleepless city. Medical school had taken him to Philly, which was far too quiet. It was a city without all the noise of one; he was surprised to find that the city actually went to sleep. The nightlife could be fun if you knew where to go, but it was a calm city. Good for his medical school years, but far too boring. Chicago was where his heart was.
"Dr. Blondie."
"It's Dr. Rogers."
Bucky cleared his throat. “Yes, sir. I know the ICP is high—"
“I love you too, you big sap.”
They nodded wordlessly, sipping away at their coffee. All the surgical staff and interns were running toward the ER doors, and they followed suit. Several ambulances pulled up, and the interns quickly donned gowns and gloves.
Katie stuck out her tongue. "That's boring."
"Hey, Buck."
"I'm sorry."
Natasha sighed. “Are you fucking Tony again?”
"Nat, you should go out with Army Tags. He was checking you out the whole time I watched you guys at the station." She turned to Steve. "Quit being a loser and talk to Dr. Stark. You're a doctor, for God's sake. You've done scarier things than talking to a guy you like."
Tony paused. "Why the hell are you talking to Steve?"
"Don't think. Tell me what you know, Rogers." The tone in Dr. Rhodes' voice only confirmed Steve's initial diagnosis.
Tony is blushing like a fool behind the camera now, and he sighs. “I love you too, Steve. I’ll see you soon.”
The girl's chest rose again with the shock, only this time her heart rate steadied. Her body moved naturally with her breathing, and her eyes fluttered open. She smiled weakly upon seeing Steve.
God, he should not be feeling this way. He felt like a teenager watching his crush dance with someone else at the prom—he felt like a goddamn fool. But suddenly it felt like his lungs were filled with smoke and he couldn’t breathe—the jealousy he felt felt like a fucking fire in his chest. He couldn't breathe but his heart was somehow pounding too much blood without enough oxygen and he almost felt lightheaded. Tony’s eyes were glued to the sight, watching Steve touch her hand, watching her blush in response; he was infuriated.
"Did you hit your head a lot?"
Steve returned with his laptop and stolen goods from the nurses' station. It took some eyelash batting and some sweet talking, but they had plenty of ice chips, jello cups and pudding. It was lame, but the kid was smiling and enjoying herself. He sat and charted for Wilson while he kept her company.
Maybe.
The neurosurgeon nodded. "Got it. Okay."
"She likes when you talk to her.
"Holy shit, Rogers," Bucky sighed, "did she chew you out?"
“I can’t wait until Christmas break,” Steve says softly, “being away from you
The trauma surgeon entered the master bedroom, rummaging through its contents. There was an endless sea of navy blue scrubs, a few pants and dress shirts, but they all seemed to be work attire.
Steve threw his hands up in the air. “I give up. I’m not going to fight you anymore.”
"Boring ass."
Tony found Pepper in the one of the attending staff lounges, holding up two cups of coffee. Her face lit up the moment he entered the room, but the sight only made Tony feel guilty for his annoyance earlier.
Before he could go on, his pager went off. "911. PEDS ICU."
Alex laughed. "I'm glad they don't let you go home. You're always checking on Andy, even when I'm sleeping. Thank you for that, by the way."
The intern waved a hand. "Do you see what he looks like Joe? And then what I look like? Probably not gonna happen."
The other interns could barely move or walk without complaining, so it was up to babysitter Steve to make sure they didn't look too ridiculous when they answered the trauma today. The women looked like they were playing dress up in Steve's scrubs that were far too big for them; Bucky looked far sicker than the other two. They all felt a little better with coffee and the junk breakfast Steve picked up on the way.
Steve slid out from the intern's arm, trying his hardest to hold his tongue. "You've had enough, buddy."
“This is ridiculous.” Steve stood up from the bench. “We’re going to be late for rounds.”
Bucky studied his friend’s face. “You’re not back with him?”
Steve groans in frustration, standing up and wrapping his arms around the engineer. He sighs, breathing in the scent of Tony’s shirt. No matter how many times Steve does the laundry, all of Tony’s clothing smells like motor oil. Steve doesn’t really mind though; he never minds. It’s Tony.
Natasha immediately swooped in with a smile on her face. "Good morning, Dr. Stark. I'm gonna have to steal Steve away from you, we got called to the pit!"
Steve rolled his eyes. “I don’t talk to him as often as you think, you know. We know he’s in surgery because Bucky and Nat are there with him.”
He took a deep breath. Might as well tell her before he does something stupid like continue day-dreaming about Stark. Maybe just some of the details. He did have a good time but no one to talk about it.
Alright, so maybe Tony was his boyfriend. He acted like one; he pressed kisses to Steve's lips before heading out the door, as if it was a casual thing they did every morning. They'd steal kisses in the on-call rooms or stairwells, they held hands outside of work when they went on dates. Their relationship—or whatever it was at the moment—was picture perfect, something out of a romantic comedy special. Although Steve didn't like to admit it, it was fun to be dating again. It took the insane pressures of work off Steve's back for a few hours every day.
Alex shook her head. "What if Andy needs me? What if she—" She choked back a sob before she could continue.
Steve smiles. “You just looked so peaceful when I watched you play, so I just…I had to sketch it out.”
The trauma surgeon grabbed Tony's hand and squeezed. Tony couldn't help but feel a little bit overwhelmed yet relieved at the same time. He threw his arms around his best friend and sighed. Even when the world was falling apart, he had Rhodey.
Tony nods wordlessly, lips curling up into a small grin as the stranger bids him goodbye. Steve returns to his room to continue his sketch, a skip in his step as he hums the melody to himself.
. Completely, utterly fucked. He fucked his boss, and now he's
Pepper gave Tony a hopeful look, twisting the ring on her finger and silently praying that he would agree. She wanted this to work so so badly. It was Tony, after all. She wanted to fight for him.
Steve swallowed and looked away from Tony. He hadn’t ever expected their relationship to end like that. In some sort of ill-fated imitation of Pride and Prejudice. Except his Mr. Darcy wasn’t going to come running back later because Tony was a resolute sort of person. Once he made a decision he stuck to it no matter how much it hurt. It was a quality that Steve admired about Tony.

It was just another morning in the Tower.

. Tony was beautiful and lovable and so alluring. There was no one more perfect than Tony Stark in Steve’s eyes and there would never be anyone better than him. Steve was fully prepared to spend the rest of his life making that wonderful genius of a man as happy as he could possibly be because that was what Tony deserved.

Tony stopped his avoid-Steve's-coffee-stealing dance to stare up at the blond. It was no secret that Steve and Tony were a thing but Steve was never the one to say it around the others. That was always Tony with the innuendos or blatant sexual advances. It was never Steve.
“Mr.—right Steve we need to go through procedure. I’ll make it quick as I’m sure there are things you rather do than sit here and have to listen to this. You have contracted Hanahaki Disease which is an illness that arises as a result of one-sided love. You have been hospitalized which implies that your condition has gone on long enough that living a regular life is no longer entirely possible. Your options are now to share your feelings of love with the other person and in the hope that your love is not one-sided as you currently believe, remove the flowers and your feelings for that person through surgery, or wait it out. Waiting it out is always an option and one that we respect in this hospital so don’t feel as if we won’t support you if you choose to take that route. As it stands according to your charts currently your hospitalization is more precautionary than entirely necessary but your condition seems to be rapidly worsening. Have you already reached a decision in terms of which route you want to take or will you need time to think?” Tony finished and the handsome man sitting in the bed gave him a sad smile.
“I’m Sam. I got here first so I claimed the bunk with the desk underneath. Sorry not sorry.” Sam’s snarky tone immediately made Steve want to laugh.

“Tony I think you got ripped off!” Steve called as he walked back to their dorm room.
“You okay?” Comes from the Winter Soldier standing just to the right of the Captain and Tony breaks eye contact with the Captain to nod.
Tony needed him.

Still there were days when Steve felt like maybe his time with Tony waas running out. Days where it seemed like Tony was looking at Steve with an almost bittersweet finality when he thought that Steve wasn’t looking.

went to go lock down the cute barista but he wasn’t there??? There was a hot brunet and he was cool but the vibe was off,, he looked like he was going to eat me for breakfast, and not in the kinky way
“Hmm...well if they decide to let us bid on art then maybe I’ll get it. It has its own charm to it.”
So he was going to die in this fucking cell and never get a chance to tell the other man about the latest stupid thing he’d done. At least they’d save money on funeral flowers when the authorities eventually found his body, that is if Hydra let his body be found.
The thing about Tony’s job was that it had cemented certain preconceptions in his mind. Especially when it came to love. Gone were the days when Tony believed that love was pure and beautiful and worth any and all pain. These days Tony was well aware of how painful and cruel love could be, he saw it every day after all. He didn’t let himself fall for the illusion of happily-ever-afters, true love, and soul mates. There were far more people suffering from unrequited love than the general public liked to believe and Tony was unable to look past their suffering. If only for the selfish reason that he didn’t want to suffer from it too.
“Who knows? Knowing him, they probably never found out.”
Maybe being surrounded by all those sharp looking knitting needles had turned the ladies running the store into willing participants in the New York drug trafficking scene. Or maybe the ladies just liked a high as much as the next addict whether it be for cocaine or money. Tony wasn’t quite sure with them.
“Alright he’s secure. Is he all clear?”
“Yeah. All the better right? I know these petals are for
"Oh honey this is so nice. Thank you." Tony turned to look up at Steve with the sweetest smile on his lips. Steve couldn't help but lean down to give his boyfriend a quick kiss.

It wasn’t surprising, New York was especially volatile these days. People were just trying to do whatever it took to survive.
Never mind that he shouldn’t be texting his patients and sharing confidential information about other patients. It was just that Steve made it possible for Tony to vent about his frustrations without feeling bad about it after. Telling Rhodey had never felt this way.

"Before you start this one's for you." Steve murmured softly and placed his completed pretty yellow zinnia and red cosmos flower crown gently on Tony's head.
He’s here! He looks so cute. Wish me luck gays.
“It’s not my fault the suit was so interesting and while good could’ve been better. Plus that was one time. I’m always on time otherwise!”

“Steve please, you’re going to be taking care of me for the foreseeable future. There’s no reason for us to stand on ceremony when you’ll probably be watching me cough up countless flower petals.” The blonde interrupted Tony and he nodded before opening his mouth again to start the usual spiel again.
“You don’t actually think I’d cheat on you? With who? I’ve been in love with you for so long Steve. Don’t be stupid.”
It was just another morning in the Tower. Jarvis had woken him up with a report that all was well and
Steve shut the door before he opened the brown bag to peer inside. There was a dismal amount of weed in it. Tony had agreed to pay twenty-five for this?
"Okay now you can start." Steve said softly while Tony giggled and began expertly weaving flowers like he'd done this a million times.
“But I live here.”
“Like you can’t take a bunch of guards in a fight.”
That Tony frequented the street more often for no specific reason for the next few days was his business and no one else's.
“I’m sorry I asked.”
“I’d imagined going home at some point, but not this soon, and not for this.” Steve replied and locked the tablet as they arrived in the main room. The other two super soldiers were waiting for them there.
“Everyone wants to know what makes them tick but that doesn’t mean you should be the one to figure it out. We have government people trying to answer that question. People who make it possible for you to get the knowledge without putting yourself into an excessive amount of danger.”
Natasha Romanoff is a snake.
Tony hadn’t even known that the Captain knew his name.
yeah stevie what friend??😉🍆💦💦🍑
“If you know what’s good for you Mr. Stark then you’ll keep walking and follow us to our vehicle.” The voice muttered into his ear. It was pleasant and detached. Tony hated it.
whats the im?
“Speaking from experience, there’s nothing like looking at that other person and feeling absolutely nothing at all for them.” Loki murmured before raising his mug in farewell and leaving the breakroom to sip his tea in peace.
"I came to get you. I have a surprise for you." Steve said and Tony immediately looked up with curious delight.
“Yeah I guess I will.”
“You’d really let yourself die for them? Without even considering the possibility that they might return the feelings?”
“You’re needlessly putting yourself into danger! You realize who these people are constantly fighting right?”

He wouldn’t think about the fact that Carol reminded him an awful lot of Pepper. Never mind the fact that Tony hadn’t always felt comfortable around Carol because of the similarity in the situation. Rhodey was better suited for comforting that particular patient anyway. That’s what mattered and what would allow Tony to feel less guilty.
“I’d really stop now while you’re ahead.” Came an impassive female voice from above in the rafters (really how had no one noticed that the knitting shop had a whole warehouse behind it equipped with high ceilings and perchable rafters) and Tony looked up to see the Widow looking down at them. Her green eyes visible over the edges of her mask.
It’s like you want me to have a bad day Nat. I thought we were friends.

So Hanahaki had never crossed his mind. Not to mention the fact that it was such a rare thing to catch because most people didn’t fall in love deeply enough for it to actually mean something real. Because despite the dramatics that Hollywood would have people believe, Hanahaki wasn’t actually the kind of thing that was easy to catch. Which on a practical pragmatic level made a lot of sense. You had to be so in love with this other person that you would genuinely be willing to die for them. That wasn't the sort of love most people held for their significant others, even those in long term relationships, because it was asking for a lot. A lot more than most people were genuinely willing or able to give.
He rubbed his eyes and looked around the cell he’d been tossed in. Everything looked the same as the last time he had been awake. Grey walls, sturdy metal bars that he could see through and no other cells in sight. Tony knew he wasn’t the only prisoner Hydra was keeping but they wanted him to feel like he was. As if Tony wanted to play mind games on top of trying to breathe deeply and not losing his shit the longer he stayed imprisoned.
Rhodey knocked on the door before entering the room with Tony trailing after. Inside a handsome young man around their age sat in the bed. His eyes a sparkling blue that contrasted nicely with his golden hair and fit in with his symmetrical features and chiseled jaw. He was certainly the kind of man that would capture Tony’s attention. What Rhodey would easily classify as Tony’s type despite Tony’s insistence that he didn’t have a type.
Steve had never expected Tony to be the one to start the dreaded conversation about their relationship.
“You want the shepherd’s pie or not? Nat, Sam and I can finish it without you, Barnes.”
"Now now. No making fun of lab experiments. That's rude Cap. I'm sure you
Loki smirked from his seat before proceeding to pitch a whole series of articles based on the next set of big congressional projects that the new administration was going to be trying to put into law. It was going to be a long ongoing project and one that would keep Loki bouncing back and forth between the White House briefing room and the Congress members he wanted to focus on.
.” Bucky calls back dramatically before the door slams shut behind him.
And somehow years had gone by and Steve hadn’t noticed. He’d been so wrapped up in Tony and the way they seemed to compliment each other. The way they seemed to just fit together. Steve had started to plan his future with Tony in mind. He’d started thinking about Tony when he was making decisions because the other man’s opinion was important to him.
gets brought up Carol doesn’t have anything to say. It’s so sad,” Rhodey told Tony as they rode the elevator down after a shift of work. They were down to three patients since Carol had been discharged but that didn’t change how often Rhodey saw her. They’d become steady friends through the ordeal. Tony still believed it to be a ticking time bomb but it was Rhodey’s decision not his.
Facing that would mean having to face his feelings and what they meant. Admitting to any feelings would mean opening himself to a world of hurt that he’d done his very best to avoid. Up until now, he hadn’t coughed up a single petal in his life so he liked to think he was safe. Then again when the first flower began growing the petals didn’t immediately try to escape the lungs. It took some time and that was a terrifying prospect.
“You don’t have to do that,” Sharon explained, “but I guess it’s nice that you still feel the need to be kind to him. I certainly wouldn’t be.”
Steve frowned. "I know the mom and the baby already—"
Rhodey kept his mouth shut, though he didn't try to hide his jaw clenching. Pepper, surprisingly, followed suit. She was the first to finish scrubbing, and the second she left the room, Rhodey was talking a mile a minute.
"I think you're just using me for food," Tony said, "that and to make Steve believe you're a perfect cat. Except that you're not. You manipulate people to get what you want. I don't doubt that you're going to take over the world someday. You'd be good at it too..."
"No, stop," Natasha cut in, "Steve is right. They're about the same age. Is the family still here?"
And that was downright horrifying.
“Yes, Sharon?”
"I didn't mean a rebound," Bucky replied quietly. "Just want you to be happy, man."
“You.” The blonde leans in against, this time pressing his lips to Tony’s. “I wanna to go bed, and I need someone to keep the blankets warm.”
Steve was speechless.
Great.
Steve and Alex went to check on the child before the intern's shift ended. Soon he bid goodnight to the mother, giving her a hug and saying goodnight to Andy as well. The infant squeezed his finger before he left, and Steve was content.
His residency. Years of his life would be spent at the hospital, working tirelessly, spending hours and weeks and days and fucking years at the same hospital. That idea used to excite him; Chicago Medical was one of his favorite places to be when he was growing up. Going to the hospital with his mother always thrilled him, and even though he didn't get to see much outside the labor and delivery unit, he knew that he wanted to learn there. He wanted to learn, and he wanted to be the best.
"Thanks for the drink."
"I am," Steve replied. The smell of Tony's cologne was creeping up on him, and it took every ounce of strength to face forward instead
Still, he had faked a laugh with the rest of the interns, taking an extra long sip of the champagne to calm his nerves. It wasn't enough.
Steve nodded, handing his cup to Tony before bidding them goodbye. The intern ran off quickly, for which Pepper was admittedly happy about; at least she didn't have to witness any potential googly eyes between her husband and his ex.
"Maybe you should talk to him."
"It's not just a
Steve never wanted to push her to go to the same school as him. Grad school was supposed to be her own choice, and medical school to be his choice. The next two years of their relationship had sent them on opposite sides of the country. The long-distance struggles began to affect their studies, and they decided it was best to break up.
It was as if someone poured ice water down Tony's back. The strawberry blonde hair looked familiar, but he didn't think twice since the woman was looking down at the patient. When she finally looked up, she smiled.
The intern pressed his lips against her forehead, hoping to melt the ice between them. She was still stiff for a while, not quite letting him off the hook so fast. Steve leaned down this time, kissing her cheek and flashing another heartwrenching smile. Eva's lip twitched slightly, but she didn't dare smile back just yet.
Steve shook his head, trying to rid himself of any thoughts of Tony. He wished he hadn't leaned on him, because hints of cologne were on his lab coat. Another constant reminder of what he couldn't have.
Pepper nodded. "You can go see her. She was a champ during surgery. I'll just need the post-op updates tomorrow, Dr. Rogers. You can round on her with Alex if you like."
Tony beams at him, jokingly rolling his eyes and waving his hand. “Dammit, Steve. How am I supposed to deal with the ridiculous amount of pining over you while I’m away?”
“You got it. Text me if you think of anything else.”
"Yes, sir?"
That was the excuse Peter used when he knocked on the door one night, soaked to the bone in the suit, carrying a tiny, crying kitten in his arms. Tony quickly took the child inside, trying to hush both of them before Steve would hear the pathetic mewling and begging alongside Peter.
Marriage counseling wasn't as painful as it was before. No more shouting, no more tears. The poor counselor wasn't calling breaks anymore after screaming matches that he and Pepper got into far too often. Things were going okay until she suggested that they trying going on a date.
"If this apartment starts to smell like pee, Peter, I swear to God—"
"Hey, Dr. Blondie."
"Still taking me to dinner this weekend?"
is complicated!" Steve's outburst caused one of the babies to stir and cry. The intern huffed as he picked up the child. "I just...I said I was in this. When I said that, I meant it, but now...I don't know."
"You need some boring in your life. Your brain was bleeding, kid."
"Don't you talk about Samuel like that. He's a very good man." She was serious; Sarah Rogers knew everyone at the hospital and did not enjoy anyone talking about her favorite doctors. She knew the man since he was an intern, fresh out of medical school, and Wilson did very well on his rotation on labor and delivery.
"Humans sit on these chairs." Tony raised his eyebrows when the cat mewed back in response. "Are you a human? I know you think you are, but you aren't."
The night shift was a completely different world. It wasn’t often that Tony was at the hospital at night voluntarily; he always jumped at the chance to go home early. Late night surgeries happened every once in a while, and there were times he was called in to check on patients. Still, the night shift was a different atmosphere.
“Shut up. I’m only doing this ‘cause you’re whining.”
"Haven't made it in a while," Steve replied. "It was a recipe from Ma. It always made me feel better when I was sick, so I knew it would make you feel better."
Well. It wasn't just Natasha that knew now. Bucky's shit-eating grin confused Steve at first. The soldier had given Steve a round of applause before sitting down with everyone.
Just as they were preparing to take the woman upstairs, Dr. Stark and Dr. Rhodes finally entered the trauma room. The interns made way for the doctors, letting them quickly examine the patient. Dr. Stark looked at the scans up on the wall, confirming that she had a brain bleed.
Steve was beyond grateful for Eva's ongoing patience. They were supposed to have breakfast that morning, their own little version of Christmas before she left for Hartford later that morning, but once again—not even a holiday like Christmas Eve would get the interns out of getting called back into work. He held her extra tight before leaving the apartment that morning, trying to forget any other lingering feelings he was stupid enough to have in the first place.
"Thought I'd find you here."
The gang forced Steve onto one of the gurneys with the rest of the interns. They were surrounded by what seemed like mountains of charts, all the binders stacked up high on the gurneys and wheelchairs.
He closed his eyes for a split second before continuing the procedure. The OR had a steady noisiness to it; the beeping of the monitors, the pressurized air going into and out of the patient's lungs. He could feel Fury watching his every move, but there were no complaints. He might actually pull this off.
"That being said, please cancel all elective surgeries for the day," Dr. Rhodes added, "there are already reports of car accidents and injuries due to the weather. We need all ORs ready for today."
Tony laughed. "Seriously, that's what you're going to ask me?"
Steve can’t stop his smile now as Tony’s crawling back into bed, pulling the sheets back and curling up right up against his chest. Strong arms immediately engulf Tony, and he sighs, realizing that he’s still kind of tired, too.
"Well, the whole Ph.D. route took a turn," Eva explained. "I decided to teach here in the city instead."
Sharon studied her best friend's face. "You're hiding something."
The stranger shuddered. "R-right...I think that's for the best."
Once the intern finally gathered himself together and regained control of his breathing, he took the note and threw it straight in the trash. He stared at it for a while and decided it was time to clean out his locker in general.
"Clear!"
was pined over, not the other way around. But with Steve, he found himself thinking about the intern constantly.
"I don't know why I even agreed to this," Tony muttered, "It's the same thing, over and over. Pep, just let me go—"
?" Nat hissed.
Without another word, Steve scooped Tony into his arms and carried him back to bed. The action almost caught Tony by surprise at first, but soon he relaxed into the blonde's arms. Soon he was tucked into bed, and he drifted off to sleep. The nap helped a little with the aching. His head still felt like it was filled with cement after his nap, but nonetheless, a little improvement was better than none.
Katie sighed , trying to hide the fact that her eyes were watering. "I'm scared of seizing again. I don't want to be alone when it happens."
Bucky turned around only to see that the other three had rushed off to the library. Sharon held back a little, laughing when she saw him jogging to catch up.
Pepper fiddled with the ring on her finger. "I really thought maybe we were getting better. Steve said that—"
Steve sat up a little. "This might be shitty of me, but...there's a heart for Tommy now."
"You have to work or you'll break." Sharon nodded. "Okay, Rogers. I'm here when you need me. We all are."
In her hand, there was a small folded up piece of paper. Her hand shook slightly; clearly it was taking all her courage to stand before him like this. Steve felt dizzy.
calling Steve on Skype.
Four years of medical school had trained him in to a rigid routine of studying whenever he had down time. There were always practicals and exams to study for, and it never hurt to study ahead, either. Steve always had something to do, something to work for, something to make sure he was ready for.
Steve rubs the back of his neck, embarrassed. “I don’t mean to stare, but I was just down the hall when I heard you playing.”
“Oh, you haven’t seen yelling yet, Steven!”
"No, Steve—"
Talking to dead kids' families never got any easier. All the interns had done it at some point; they had to. Even after months of practice, having to tell the family there was nothing they could do, having them scream, wail, and sob—it never got any easier. Especially if it was a kid.
The blond chuckled. "Well, alright then."
"Page me if there are any changes in her EKG," Pepper said. "I'll be in labor and delivery in case you need me."
Tony laughed. "Now you're just buttering me up, Fury."
"Nat," Steve said, glancing at Katie. "There's a patient in here. She's a kid."

The neurosurgeon shook his head. "Fine. It's red. Next?"
Steve scoffed. "Your
Tony sat on the couch next to his best friend, scooting up close enough that their hips were touching. The neurosurgeon leaned on Rhodey's shoulder, wiggling slightly to wake him.
"Yeah, you will, Romanoff."
Once the neurosurgeon fell asleep, Steve took it upon himself to move him to a private room rather than letting him spend the night in the pit. After alerting the charge nurses of the move, he instructed them to page Rhodes once the patient woke up.
"I hope you still like seafood," Tony said quietly, "I, uh, heard about a nice place out on the pier."
"I knew you missed me," she said with a soft laugh.
"The little girl took me by surprise, so I didn't have a name yet," Alex admitted, "I wanted her to have a name that could have a nickname like me. Her name is Andrea, Andy for short."
Tony nodded quickly. “I’ll be fine, Rhodey.”
Ever since the unnamed listener came by, he’s proud to play again. Tony allows himself to strike the keys just a little more, accenting his talent and letting his beautiful tunes echo through the halls of the fine arts building. He’s partially hoping the stranger will come back, too. Maybe tell him his name. Maybe get coffee down the street.
Beats of silence felt like weeks or months.
A hearty laugh escapes the blond, and even though it’s the first time he’s heard it, Tony wants to hear it again and again. He’s heard countless melodies, beautiful symphonies and ballads, but somehow, all he wants to hear is that wonderful, beautiful laugh.
"You did a good—"
friends.
"Steve, that is amazing! I am so proud of you, really." Eva's phone began to ring and she gave him an apologetic look. "I have to go."
The first stop in the kitchen is always the coffee maker, but this morning, the regular box of coffee grounds seems to be missing. Not in the cabinets, not misplaced somehow in the fridge or under the sink-
"I miss you," she whispered. "and I think...you miss me, too."
"I'm Pepper. Pepper Potts-
Tony squeezed the intern's hand. "That one's easy. Yes."
As he pulls out his sketchbook and pencil, there’s a soft echo of piano music resonating through the halls. He pauses for a moment, hoping that he hadn’t imagined the quiet, peaceful twinkling of a familiar melody.
"I know that you gotta stop being an idiot if you're still into Romanoff," Steve said simply. He wasn't going to give it all away; Bucky had to figure it out for himself sometimes.
There wasn't much of a thrill now, standing frozen in the middle of the trauma room with Tony while shaking hands with his
Steve walked away before they could notice him staring.
Rhodey raised an eyebrow. "Tony."
"Listen, Blondie,
Steve could barely focus. He was supposed to be listening to Dr. Wilson so he wouldn't be a lost moron when he finally needed to bring someone for a CT scan, but he could only think of Tony. He should've asked for a name. Even a last name. Or a number. How was he living in the 21st century without asking someone for their damn phone number?
Peter sniffled. "I'd take him Mr. Stark, but Aunt May is allergic."
Steve nodded. "I saw the heart going in. I got stuck in the elevator during the black out."
When Steve arrives in the fine arts building, he decides to stray from his usual study area on the first floor to venture up to the higher levels. The fine arts building is right near the quad of the campus, and he decides to devote the day to sketching for another class.
"I'll keep that in mind." He ran his fingers through Steve's hair, pulling down to kiss him once more before the intern left the room.
"What?"
“Are you lying to me?”
The intern smiled. "Hey, Ma."
He wasn't sure if that was what he wanted to be with Steve.
He wished this day never happened. So he wouldn't be obsessing over his ex's adulterous wife while watching a life-changing surgery.
"Alex and Andy. I like that."
Steve shrugged. "Must have been too quiet for her. She probably liked hearing her mom's voice."
"I'm living in the city, yes. What about you? Why Chicago?"
Tony froze. He couldn't read Steve's face for a split second; the soldier was far too serious. Eventually, a smile broke through the stoic expression, and he slipped his arms around the brunet. He squeezed him a little, enjoying the smell of his husband's hair.
Nightlife sure was interesting in Chicago.
The moment of distraction and bliss was brief as Dr. Potts-Stark brought in a mother into the NICU to see her child. The young woman in the wheelchair had the same dark hair and honey golden skin as the baby that gripped his finger. She looked relieved to see that her daughter had made it through the night.
“I’m sorry.”
The intern chuckled as Tony leaned forward and kissed him, letting all the stress melt away from his body. It was suddenly the two of them again, just the two of them in a staircase, without bosses or residents or exes to worry about, and all he needed right now was Tony. Finally, the brunet pulled away and pressed his forehead to Steve's.
"Can we talk? Please?" She held up a coffee cup. "I know I probably shouldn't be bribing a doctor but..."
"Ugh. I'm so alone," she groaned, "You have Dr. Calvin Klein, Natasha clearly claimed Army Tags. I'm a loner."
“You know, it would be one thing if you were single, but there’s Eva—“
“Tony’s in surgery.” Steve grabbed the scans and placed them in an envelope. “We should probably page Nelson, he’s on call.”
Tony released a shaky breath. "Steve..."
The intern pulled away from Tony's grasp, not realizing how hard he had flinched away until Tony frowned.
"Dr Wilson, you ran the code? How was she?" Tony leaned down to put the stethoscope to her chest, much to the girl's amusement. "Quit giggling, missy. I need to hear your heart."
"Steve, Steve! It's okay."
"I'm not leaving. I love you," Tony repeated. "I love you, I love you,
"If you'd answered my phone calls these days, you'd know." She clicked her tongue. "Well, which one of you is Steve Rogers?"
He rushed over to her, pushing the code button as nurses followed him. Andy's heart had stopped, and Steve grew nauseous. Her heart was failing, but he had never done CPR on a preemie.
“Steve.”
And for a moment, Steve nearly forgot. He nearly forgot the weeks of pain and hell he'd been enduring. He wanted to melt into Tony's arms, fall into them the way he always did after a bad day. The look on Tony's face wasn't smug and teasing, he looked so sincere that it only made Steve's heart ache more.
And even with Steve smiling after the explanation, he was tired of feeling guilty. He was tired of having to avoid Steve's glances at the nurses' station, tired of kissing him and feeling his whole body grow heavy, tired of tiptoeing.
“What the hell is going on, Rogers?”
"I can't remember everything, but I know he was amazing in bed. He even offered to cook me breakfast this morning." He smiled to himself, remembering how kind Tony was even after a hookup with a stranger.
Battered and bloodied victims came in through the ambulances, and Steve's group of interns were assigned to a pregnant woman who was accompanied by a civilian. The civilian had her hands on the woman's chest, despite the paramedics listing off the details.
Now it felt like Steve's first day at the hospital, with the wondering and daydreaming about the handsome man in his bed the other night. He tried to focus while Wilson was updating them on the post-op patients they needed to check on while he was in surgery, but his eyes wandered to Tony, who was at the nurses' station. There was a stern, irritating look on his face as he held a phone to his ear. He wasn't exactly quiet in his argument with whoever was on the phone with him. Steve tried to catch the bits and pieces of the conversation in the midst of Wilson lecturing.
Tony chuckles, returning to the pouting blonde, but only getting close enough to kiss his nose. “It’s time for breakfast, honey.”
Except that it wasn't nothing, and it was clear to the rest of the interns that Steve was distracted. Steve was a good intern, but today, he seemed stuck in a day dream, mixing up labs and being caught off guard when other residents and attendings asked him questions. After checking on Wilson's patients, Sharon met Steve at the nurses' station.
The stranger finished off his beer and smirked. "I'll call a cab."
Bucky felt sick when looked down at the little girl. The laceration on her temple was deep, nearly cutting into the bone. He grabbed the paddles and shouted at Steve to keep clear. All hands were off.
"Atta boy."
, the way she said his name, he was in a goddamn puddle.
The smile on Steve’s face immediately disappears, much to Tony’s amusement. The super soldier flops back onto the bed, groaning loudly as Tony heads for the kitchen.
"You're still wearing a ring, so no, I won't be speaking to him, Dr.
The neurosurgeon was still in scrubs, laying in the bottom bunk and scrolling through his phone. He immediately sat up once he saw his favorite blonde coming in the doors. But, almost immediately, he felt the familiar pang of guilt he'd been feeling all week. Tony finally decided it was time to tell Steve, just to tell him the truth now instead of later—
"I thought you should have a memory of that," Tony explained. "You never forget your first patient, especially not one you diagnosed before the attending."
"The elevator's not working yet, is it?"
"Dr. Rogers?"
Steve groaned as he was met with three shocked expressions; he sat back down and recounted that overnight shift. Despite Steve explaining everything—well, almost everything—he was still met with skeptical looks from his best friends. He hoped that nothing in his expression would give away the fact that he still thought about how heartbroken Tony had looked that night. He especially hoped that whatever odd, melancholic aching he felt since that night would go away.
And just like that, Tony was kissing him. He guided Steve away from the entrance, then leaned back as Steve moved forward to shut the door. Sure, Steve was exhausted like no other, but all his fatigue seemed to melt away when Tony's lips were on his. Tony grinned when he felt Steve's hands in his hair, but he broke away before the blonde could get too carried away.
"Someone overheard them taking arguing about marriage counseling earlier last week," she explained, "that's what I heard from some of the other nurses talking."
“You should get some rest. Before you complain, it’s almost one in the morning there, and you have an 8 am lecture, remember?” Steve is so smiley and full of sunshine even in the middle of the night, Tony catches himself wondering how he ever got someone to love him like this.
Instead, Steve just fell into him and kissed him deeply. He shrugged off his backpack and his jacket then returned his hands to Tony's hair, one of his favorite parts about him. Tony hummed in surprise, meeting Steve's lips and trying to breathe as he was pushed into the bed.
Oh, how he regretted his decision.
The young doctor broke away from the kiss for a moment and winked. "You won't regret sleeping with the weirdo staring at you from the bar?"
"Please, drop it," Tony muttered, "what happened in New York is over. I'm here in Chicago now. With you. My very best friend. My honey bear."
The neurosurgeon looked much better now, his complexion looking far brighter than the night before. He no longer donned the hospital gown the nurses had forced him into after he passed out. He looked the most human than Steve had ever seen him. A plain maroon sweater and jeans—not the usual attending attire or scrubs. Dark hair, normally combed back, was now slightly unkempt, almost giving him a boyish look about him. He looked like someone's brother or a person at the coffee shop down the street, not like a world-renowned surgeon.
, he's Dr. Rogers now!"
Steve focused just on the man's lips now; the more he looked at him and now that he was sobering up after drinking some water, he quickly realized the man wasn't just pretty. He was gorgeous. Gorgeous in a way that made Steve's stomach twist. Gorgeous in a way that seemed impossible, especially for a guy like Steve. He was just Steve, but this guy? Holy fucking hell.
"You're a sweet girl, aren't you?" Steve's baby voice made Tony swoon, but he tried not to show it. Steve knelt down on the sidewalk, scratching the fluffy husky's ears. "You're a good girl for sitting like that. Yes, you are!"
A knot formed in Steve's throat. God, it took only two minutes of conversation about Tony, and it was enough to bring Steve to tears.
," Steve choked out, "it hurts to look at you, to hear your voice, to feel you. I-I can't, Tony. I'm sorry."
sure," the stranger replied. He pushed Steve through the apartment door, quickly shutting it behind them.
“Nothin’, just thinking about pretty blonds,” Tony replies with a smile. “How are your classes? How’s work?”
"Are you even cleared to be in the NICU?" Steve retorted. He held the stethoscope to Andy's chest. "You had a cold last week."
The other interns had already beat him to the hospital that morning, as some other attendings needed charting to be finished before any last-minute emergency surgeries occurred over the next two days. They finally had to join Steve in the pit, mostly stitching up patients who were too confident in the kitchen for holiday prep. It was never a dull moment at the hospital, not even during the holiday season.
Megan took the glass from Steve and let her fingertips linger on his skin. "Are you still seein' that neurosurgeon?"
"The kind of before where we were friends," Tony said quickly, as if reading his mind, "The one where we can catch up and have coffee and I don't go psycho on your girlfriend."
"Hey." Steve sat down beside her, taking her hand into his.
"Steve."
Tony's mind was reeling as he felt Steve's hands wandering over his body, and he nearly groaned in response Steve finally straddling his hips on the bed. The intern was just moving his lips to Tony's neck when one of the pagers went off. It was coming from Steve's lab coat, and he sighed.
He held out his hand. "Tony."
Steve had no idea how he should react. It was something out of a telenovela, some ridiculous plot twist on a soap opera that his mother would watch. It didn't feel real, it felt like some cruel prank, like someone would pull out a bunch of cameras and reveal that the whole ordeal was just a joke. A horrible joke, but at least it wouldn't be real.
The intern joined Rhodes at the nurses' station, suddenly incredibly nervous to be standing here with him. Dr. Rhodes was one of the best trauma surgeons in the country, and he was suddenly wondering now if he had done something wrong in the pit or had delinquent charts on any pit patients. The ER was his domain—it was not someplace to fuck around in.
One afternoon, Tony arrives back to the usual practice rooms of the fine arts building. Sitting on the shelf of the piano is a sketch that takes the air from Tony’s lungs.
"Shouldn't you be more worried about getting home?"
After some hesitation, the boy nodded. Steve hoisted him back up to the table, and Sharon restarted the monitors. The boy's heart rate had slowed slightly, but he grew weaker with the loss of blood.
. Beer bottles and cups scattered every inch of counter space and any table he had. The furniture had been moved around, there were some alcohol stains on the rug in the living room. Just thinking about cleaning the apartment exhausted him.
Suddenly, Tony found himself talking to the cat all day long. Cheeseburger was an excellent conversationalist, mewing at just the right moments when Tony paused. The kitten seemed pleased with himself every time Tony laughed in response.
Tony’s arms are around him, but Steve’s never felt lonelier. He tries to ignore it. He’ll play along, he’ll be happy—Tony is going to change the world someday. He needs to let him go.
"...and now Wilson's gonna kick my ass,
Steve banged on the elevator doors and pressed his ear to them to see if anyone would respond. He was met with silence yet again, and the knot in Steve's stomach only twisted to see that there was no signal at all on his phone.
"Are you going to leave her?"
"It doesn't get better, Pep!" Tony bellowed. "Here you are talking about vows when you broke them! Don't you dare come to me talking about promises of how I loved you. Don't."
"Sit at the counter, Tony."
"Are you nervous?"
Steve was an interesting addition to his adventure. Sure, he went to a bar late at night and downed a few shots of vodka, so it was probably inevitable that he'd go home with someone. He just wanted to see the nightlife and get to know the city a little bit.
The intern tried his best to focus and find joy in the changing weather; it was all he could do to keep himself from falling apart. Having roommates definitely helped in keeping his mind off Tony. Any moment that they weren't at the hospital, the gang tried their best in keeping Steve busy.
Pepper didn't have much time to dwell on what just happened with Tony as her pager started going off. She was being paged to the NICU, 911.
"She's brain dead, sir."
“Give me a minute, Rogers.”
They'd been together for years, but Steve still blushed and cleared his throat. "I missed you, too."
"What would I do without you?"
"He was looking for you," Dr. Rhodes continued. "I mentioned I would find you if I ran into you, so..."
"She seems nice," Steve agreed, not wanting to say anything more. Sharon was definitely someone who would have dated. She was soft, warm. She was genuine and kind; it was a shame Steve didn't go out with the interns last night. It would have been a safer bet, trying to date her. Not trying to date your fucking boss.
Tony could barely look at Steve or Peter at this point; he knew he'd immediately cave once he saw their pleading eyes. Instead, he glanced at the kitten, sickly and tiny and filthy. The orange fur was ridden with fleas, covered in dirt and God knows what else is in the alleyways of New York. There were some cuts around the belly, like he might have gotten into a fight with some other strays in the street. The kitten mewed once again, pleading with the engineer to give in and let him stay.
"I—I thought you had surgery."
Joe!"
“God, it’s not pity, you idiot!” Steve ran his hands through his hair, exasperated and exhausted. “Have you considered for once that maybe you’re not the only one who’s suffering here? I
"We've got a car accident with two minors, brother and sister, obvious facial lacerations, possible head and neck injuries," the paramedic began, "possible internal injuries to the brother."
She waved an arm. "I'm not like that. I thought Sharon was cute, but I thought you were into her. I thought it would be nice if we shared."
The next morning, Peter insisted that they had to take the kitten to the vet.
Just as Bucky tried to thank him, Natasha and Sharon returned to the cardiac unit, following Dr. Wilson into Tommy Evan's room. Steve and Bucky were quick to follow. Despite arguments and squabbles among the interns, they worked effortlessly together during a code.
And the look he gives Tony, the soft sweet half-smile with just a hint of melancholy, it feels like his heart is going to tear in half.
The stranger smirked. "Shut up and take your pants off."
seemed to fucking pass before Steve got enough oxygen to his brain and form a proper sentence.
"Steve!" She almost moved in to hug him, but she paused and only chuckled nervously. "I...hi."
Wilson cleared his throat. "The charts, Rogers."
Ever since Bucky's first solo surgery, it seemed to be an unspoken thing that Natasha was his person now. They studied together every chance they could, they were always found together in the tunnels, if Steve was looking for Nat, he could probably find Bucky close by, too. He was sure they were together at this point, but Bucky didn't seem to mention anything about the matter.
She shook her head and smiled. "It's okay. Are you here to check on Andrea?"
what if he tells Fury—"
"Surgical residency. At Chicago Medical." Steve gave a sheepish smile. "Somehow they accepted me, even after some questionable grades at U Penn."
Natasha's eyes narrowed. "Is this a trick? What are you doing?"
Bucky snapped his fingers. "You're right. I gotta go to Sharon."
"Say, the nurses are talking about getting wasted at some party," Tony panted, "talking about some party at a pretty blond's place."
Bucky narrowed his eyes. "You don't know it's going to be an appy. It could be anything."
"Because you're here," Tony said simply. As if it was the most obvious thing in the world, his presence improving the neurosurgeon's day. As if everything was still okay. As if Steve's heart wasn't shattered just a few weeks ago. As if they still had each other.
Relief washed over Steve. He thanked her profusely before quickly hopping onto an elevator. Katie giggled to herself.
Bucky frowned. "Quit it, Nat. I'm
stupid.
"Actually, your wife was looking for you," Wilson said abruptly. "I saw her on the way up here. She wanted to know where you disappeared to when the storm hit."
Tony and Rhodey went down to the locker room, exhausted from a long day. The two best friends had just left the ER after consults and running trauma together for the first time. It had been ages since they'd worked together on patients, and the feeling was the same every time. Even after a few years apart, they were a well-oiled machine. Saving lives with your best friend never lost its spark.
"You were the one that figured it out," Tony replied, "Without the extra scans, we would have missed it. You can pat yourself on the back too, you know."
“Tony…is this a bad time to call?”
"Oh, so meeting up with someone, getting drinks with them, then taking them home was
"I don't get why she's so pissed at me these days," Bucky sighed. He searched Steve's face for an answer. Steve felt an urge to say something, and Bucky lit up when the blond's lip twitched slightly. "You know something! You shithead, Rogers, you know something!"
He held his hands up in surrender and sat down on the stairs.  “Alright, I’m sorry.”
"I'm telling you—"
“I’m sorry,” Tony finally repeated.
For the first time in years, Steve had downtime and he wasn't sure what to do with himself.
She seemed slightly annoyed with the nurse that she was speaking to. Hearing her voice snapped the intern out of his trances, and he couldn't help but smile as he heard Eva's choice.
Steve stood up. "I-I can go check on him if you want."
A hush fell over the crowd as Steve stood up. "Seriously? You're gonna sit here, eating snacks and making bets, instead of
Cheeseburger looked a little better, but he was still very malnourished and in need of proper grooming. After the examination from the vet, some vaccinations (Steve couldn't bear to see the kitten being poked with needles) and a clean up from one of the technicians, Cheeseburger looked like a brand new cat. The vet sent them home with some medicine for any wounds and flea and heartworm prevention.
happy!...please, just let me have this. Goodbye."
The blond pouts. “You said that thirty minutes ago.”
Tony tilted his head in confusion. "Everything alright there, chef?"
Car crashes and accidents kept Tony’s mind busy those days. Although the idea was a bit morbid, the critical patients required attention and round-the-clock care until they were in recovery. The neurosurgeon gladly volunteered to stay late, sending interns home and spending the night at the hospital.
Kissing was difficult after several shots of tequila. Mystery man's lips seemed to be everywhere, but he wasn't sure if it was the alcohol or reality. Either way, there was a very pretty man's tongue in his mouth, so who was Steve to judge?
badly. The soldier never begged for one, but all the "hints" about wanting a pet were clear as day. Whenever they were out, seeing dogs out on the street or at the park, or maybe seeing a cat in the windows of apartment buildings, Steve always had something to say about it. People were always so shocked to see Captain America and Iron Man walking the streets of Manhattan that they were more than willing to let the heroes pet their animals.
"You have to call her," Bucky chimed in after the story, "This is your chance to get your mind off Tony, see this girl—"
It was easier said than done. The poor lovesick blond managed about a week and a half of his fool-proof plan before the other interns saw him accepting a cup of coffee from Tony.
"You could have invited her on a date, you dumbass!" Steve sighed. "Whatever. I'm not paying for any booze or food. That's on you. You better make a move on Nat tonight or I'll tell her that one guy in radiology is into her."
"I'm not worried about the craniotomy," Steve replied, "The surgery will be the easy part. Trying to make sure I don't act like a lovesick idiot in front of Stark is going to be the hard part."
Dr. Rhodes cleared his throat. "I just wanted to say thank you for taking care of To—Dr. Stark last night."
The brunet spins around immediately, startled to find blue eyes staring back at him. “Oh! Th-thanks.”
Tony and Cheeseburger nearly jumped ten feet in the air to find Steve entering the kitchen. There was a bit of stubble on Steve's face from days away from home and not being able to shave. Fatigue was all over the soldier's face, and Tony melted.
"But you're still daydreaming about last night." She smiled when Steve grew pink. "Oh, it's bad. It's making you pink and I didn't even say anything."
"Looks like he's in good hands," the lady said before bidding them goodbye, "he's got two superheroes looking after him."
Tony chuckled in response, low enough to send shivers down Steve's spine. The elevator was just a couple more floors down to the ground level. They were almost there until there was a distant rumble of thunder, and the lights in the elevator went pitch black and thudded to a halt.
"Only for you, baby." Tony really hoped the exaggerated grin was enough to get his husband off his back; just standing up was exhausting him.
Tommy glanced up at Dr. Danvers, instinctively reaching for her hand. She squeezed it and turned back to the interns. "We're waiting for a new heart for our little guy here. While we wait, I need you guys to monitor his labs, monitor his stats, and page me with anything. Seriously, anything. Mr. Evans is my top priority today."
Katie looked at him, puzzled. "Not always. But a couple weeks ago I landed on my back, hit my head. Nothing serious. I think I had a concussion."
Steve’s smiling now, knowing that he’s caught Tony staring. “Something on your mind?”
It would be nice to have roommates. Steve was so lonely in the apartment these days that he was sleeping in the on-call rooms just to avoid going home by himself.
"What made you change your mind?" Fury looked at the neurosurgeon curiously. "I know they pay big money in New York."
Sharon scowled. "How are we going to know his stats—"
Both of them were so engrossed in the other that they almost don't notice the lights flashing on and Wilson coming through the door.
"I didn't say anything," Bucky insisted. "I don't want you to not trust me, Stevie."
It felt so domestic, like something out of a movie at the happy ending, something that Steve hadn't felt in a while. Watching Tony at the stove in his apartment, humming to himself while adding tomatoes and spinach to an omelet, kissing him in between ingredients, it made Steve's heart ache. He ached for Tony to be more than a one night stand, he ached for him to be
The jealousy was irrational, but he couldn't help but feel slight annoyance seeing his friends together. Bucky and Nat had gotten along so quickly with very little obstacles—
It was Tony Stark's first day at Chicago Medical. The new head of neurosurgery. Nick Fury, chief of surgery and an old mentor from his days in New York, had offered him the position a few months ago. It was only until a couple weeks ago that he decided to take the job.
But Pepper looked happy. Happier than she looked in months, maybe even a couple years. Maybe it was worth a shot, if he could keep someone happy for once.
"Eva."
Steve sighed. "Okay, if you're fine, I don't wanna hear any whining that you're sick and miserable. Got it?"
"Whatever you say, Dr. Blondie."
"I'm here, Alex." Steve rubbed her back gently. "I'm sorry I was gone. I got stuck in an elevator today. This damn storm messed up everything, but I'm here now."
, somehow both sweet and so goddamn pretty that he could barely
“I knew something was going on.”
"And?"
He was alone with a cat that hated him.
“Spill.”
She gripped his hand. "I'm so scared all the time. I can't sleep or eat or breathe, Steve. We've been here for almost a month. I thought she was getting better, but now..."
Sharon took a step forward, moving to hug him. "We don't have to talk about it."
Tony took a spoonful of the soup, unable to suppress the groan that escaped his lips. "Why haven't you made this before? I want to marry this soup."
Before his mother could answer, a familiar neurosurgeon walked up to the nurses station. Steve couldn't believe his eyes when he saw his own mother with rosy cheeks with Dr. Stark's arrival. Sarah grabbed Steve's arm, squeezing it with excitement.
Though he was a bit embarrassed, Steve stood up and leaned into Tony. The neurosurgeon chuckled a little bit, abandoning the stove to reach into Steve's hair. He pushed Steve against the counter, growing a little breathless even though Steve showed no signs of stopping anytime soon. He shivered when Steve's fingers were at the buttons of his shirt, frantically trying to get the shirt open. Tony finally gasped when Steve succeeded and starting sucking a bruise into his neck.
"Steve—"
"Told you I'd get you out of here alive." He rested a hand on hers. Her skin was still warm. He kept her alive.
Steve shouldn’t care—he didn’t, by the way. He didn’t care that his ex’s divorce was final. Of course, he cared that night, but only because Tony was lonely and upset.
Steve moved to lead the drunken intern into the kitchen, but he was met with another shove. "I said don't fucking touch me, fag!"
The neurosurgeon was immediately dragged away by his best friend. His eyes were still focused on Steve—at least the blurry image of him—and the fire behind his gaze. And just like that, Tony had ruined the one other good thing he had in his life.
Steve was invited to the bar after the mixer, but he decided to stop at home and get out of the formal wear he was forced to wear that night. He felt so stiff; he needed to unwind.
"No need to freak out anymore." Tony leaned down and pressed his lips to Steve's forehead.
"It still
"The company asked me where you went, Tones!" Rhodey exclaimed. "I can only keep up the 'leave of absence' bullshit for so long. People talk, Tony. And when you work for Nick Fury, everyone knows."
"Did you need something, Dr. Stark?"
“He just looked...sad,” Steve sighed. “I just felt so sorry for him.”
Even though the darkness only lasted several seconds, an eternity seemed to pass before the lights in the elevator came back on. In the brief blackout, Tony had scooted just an inch closer to the intern, smirking to himself.
Bucky smirked a little bit. "I gotta find another book first. Let's go."
"You need to stop saying stupid shit around him," Steve retorted, "Especially when I'm around. Now we smell like literal
him—and smiled. "I'm fine."
The intern laughed to himself as Jake stared at him in disbelief. The cab drove away before Jake could protest, and Steve made a point to wave goodbye until they were no longer in sight. They were the last group to leave the apartment complex, so Steve went back up to his place.
