The reveal. First of many.
said!”
“ What about Zachariah? This is totally his type of sleazeball move.”
Those clever thumbs are tracing up the line of his hip bones, hands sliding around to frame Dean’s waist below his ribs, completely exposing his belly.  Cas finally looks down and Dean flushes hard at the deep throated moan that escapes Cas’ mouth before he bends down to kiss and nip around Dean’s navel. Oh god, Dean is trying to keep his balance, trying not to grip Cas’ shoulders too hard, trying not to make any embarrassing noises and wake up the kids, but oh god Cas is taking him apart like a boss and they’re not even naked yet!  He’s snapped out of his thoughts by an overwhelming pressure in one spot just above his belly button. Dean looks down just as Cas pulls away from his skin with a wet sucking sound and satisfied grin. Dean’s pretty sure he has a hickey on his belly now, but he doesn’t have time to look because Cas is moving on.
“ The children aren’t Cain’s responsibility.” Castiel reminds his brother. “ And besides, he’s entertaining his own guests tonight.”
Cas moves in again to begin placing firm, open mouthed kisses at the base of Dean’s throat. The kind that turn Dean to mush and leave small purple blossoms in their wake.
“ Okay, Claire. Your turn.” Cas watches Claire put the books back into the basket and head toward the bathroom. He follows behind her, tossing a quiet, “ Pick something to watch,” over his shoulder to Dean.
“ I try. She got totaled years ago, but I built her back up from scratch. “ Dean is trailing his fingers lovingly along a gleaming black fender. “ Better than new. “
and you’re
Dean’s head whips up, re-establishing eye contact. “ What?” He’d been so far in his head and worries the question takes him completely by surprise.
and Dean flips through the channels until he finds MTVClassic;
“ Good to see you again, Dr. Moore. I’ve been saving my last two jars of lavender honey just for you.” The vendor smiles brightly at the woman.
Blue eyes.
Since delivery is frowned upon (
A few retirees with their newspapers in the easy chairs, the usual characters checking their dating profiles and recipes blogs at the computer bank, a steady stream of storytime attendees streaming toward the exit.
Castiel chuckles. He stares blearily at the keyboard, attempting a reply, but a new text comes in before he can get anything typed.
It’s another mile and a half before they come upon the house sitting pretty among the trees. He spots a champagne gold monstrosity parked under the carport on the right and hopes that’s not his neighbor’s main source of transportation. He also notices a little face pressed against his neighbor’s front window, young and blonde and blatantly curious about the new arrivals. Dean pulls toward the left, toward his side, and pauses to let Jess and Sam out so they can help him back the trailer up to the garage.
“ Sure.” Charlie clicks on the thumbprint and the screen fills with various stills of the same woman. “ You know her?”
Then Jack breaks away from his father and beelines straight for Dean, his arms held up in an obvious gesture. Dean grins and scoops the boy up. “ Heya, Jack. Feeling better?”
“ I can’t live up to that, Meg! I don’t want him to feel… indebted to me, or whatever. The whole situation is awkward enough without a life debt thrown into the mix.”
“ Happy birthday, Dean!”
“ No.” Cain shakes his head over his spoon before putting it down, curling both hands around the warm bowl. He’s still smiling, strong nostalgia softening his voice further when he continues. “ Harvelle’s Roadhouse parking lot, on Baby’s hood, Black Friday, an hour after closing.” Cain pauses, letting his correction sink in. “ And you kissed me. Without asking first, as I recall.”
dealing with the press and the trial.”
“ Glad to hear it.” Cain moves along the table, removing foil and plastic and towels from the dishes. “ Although I suppose the lack of action is nearly as troubling as active harassment.”
Claire nods her head, fingers closing around the plastic llama in a protective fist. “ Got it.”
When they get home, Dean unloads the car and shoos Jess inside for air conditioning and to put her swollen feet up. Fresh produce is stashed in the fridge and on the countertops, canned goods in the highly organized pantry. Jess’s baby items are placed in a single tote and brought to her as she holds court on the couch in the living room, surrounded by pillows and what’s left of her double decker grilled cheese (her drink long since guzzled and most of Sam’s, as well).
“ Merry Christmas, little brother.”  Gabriel points at the digital clock on the Blue-ray player.
Claire is right at his elbow and Castiel jumps, constantly surprised by his child’s stealth. He’s quick to school his face into its normal tired smile. “ A little bit, but it will get better. Are you and Jack watching the episode about the oceans?”
“ Actually, I told them they could watch a movie.” Castiel laughs nervously, as he opens the Continental’s back door.  He raises his voice a bit to include the children. “ So, if they’re willing to get ready for bed first, then we can skip bathtime tonight and watch
The heat kicks on. Another spurt of fireworks far away. Dean’s steady even breaths. His own faint heartbeat.
Cas looks like he wants to say something else, but Claire’s small voice comes through the speaker again and he bolts out of the room.
“ Shut up.” Dean grouses, pushing at the older man’s shoulder.
Jack immediately picks up on it. “ Din loo funny! Din funny!” He cackles maniacally until Cas comes back into the den to see what the commotion is all about.
The images at the top catches Castiel’s attention because the first three are all photos of Nicholas Adler at various press conferences. His forehead wrinkles with his frown as he clicks on the close up image. It’s Nicholas from several years ago, promoting one of his company’s newest talents; a beautiful rockabilly redhead standing coldly at his side. Castiel stares at each face in turn, searching for Ruby. There’s a dark ponytail and black leather shoulder behind Nicholas and Castiel back arrows and finds a few more photos from the same event, from different angles. And there she is.
Cain laughs at that, fingers curling around his empty cup. “ She is eating for two. It may be indelicate of me to ask, but when is she due? I have a few things at the house that she may find useful once the baby is here.”
In the warm darkness, the peaceful quiet settling over the house, Castiel just barely catches the tiny whisper under his chin.
More shuffling and shifting until Castiel insinuates himself between Dean’s bowed thighs, face nuzzling contentedly over the satiny fabric. He mouths along the stiff ridge of flesh under the lace, moving slowly toward the tip that’s leaking profusely on Dean’s hip, the wet spot spreading with every twitch.   Once he reaches his destination, Castiel sucks gently, pulling the lace and spongy head between his covered teeth, teasing the slit through the thin material with his tongue.
“ You wanna see
“ Yeah, I’m getting a few more things.” Dean gives his sister-in-law his most charming smile and waves her on. Leaving him alone with his last long term relationship. Well, somewhat alone. There’s still a line of people behind him and they’re situated in a jam packed tent alley. He grabs something small from the top of a stack and adds it to his pile without looking at it, his eyes forced up to meet the other man’s. “ Hi.” Yep, smooth.
“ No, it’s fine.” Castiel orders his body to move, to sit up and struggle against the blankets until he can swing his legs over the edge and get his feet on the cold hardwood floor. He sits there for a moment, yawning wide, scrunching his face at his own morning breath. “ I believe we will all be having a nap this afternoon.” Castiel cracks his neck to one side and looks down at Dean, still kneeling on the floor at the side of the bed. The younger man is already dressed, lacking only his shoes and coat. Castiel can hardly believe he slept through Dean getting ready just an arm’s length away. He really is tired. But family and breakfast await and he’s about to push himself up when Dean’s hand lands on his knee, halting him.
Castiel grins and digs around in the hair basket for a moment. He finds a small soft tie- bright purple to match the whale on Jack’s hooded t-shirt- carefully gathers up the short golden locks on top of the boy’s head and secures them together in a tiny twig of a ponytail. “ How’s that?”
Cas is smiling, but quiet. And rather stiff in his seat.
Castiel smiles, despite his unease. “ They insisted we bring something back for you and Cain, though I doubt Cain would feel as though he was missing out if you wanted to eat both.”  At the end of the day, there had been few choices in the pastry case, but Claire had decided Cain would like an almond croissant and Jack had picked out a chocolate brownie for Dean.
Crazy times, friends. I hope everyone is doing as well as can be expected. I hope everyone is vehemently practicing their own forms of self-care. I hope everyone knows that there is still more good than bad in the world. Love you all <3
“ Well, I, mean…”
When he glances to the side, Dean is also looking out at the children, watching them climb back up the hill to repeat the rolling process. Dean’s expression is thoughtful (once Castiel stops staring at the perfection of his profile).  “ Hey, man. I get it. And you’re keeping your shit together a lot better than most.” He ducks his head, pulls nervously at his ear lobe. “  Uh, after Mom died, Dad kinda lost it, let fear take him over. Uncle Bobby used to say that Dad wanted us to be happy, but he
By the sudden sugary attack. And by the look of absolute horror on Dean’s face. “ Oh, crap! I am so sorry!”
“ I’ve got proof,” snickers Gabriel.
“ We, uh, we met Dean at the pediatric office when Jack was sick last week.” Cas gestures weakly at the little boy still holding his hand but watching the goings on with rapt attention.
It’s clumsy, but between them they manage to get their jeans below their crotches, tight around their thighs. Underwear remains untouched if only because Dean is now as entranced by his partner’s boxer briefs as Cas is of his panties. Though for an entirely different reason. Dean glances up questioningly. “ Not that I’m one to talk, but... reflector vest orange?”
Dean flashes him the brightest smile before disappearing around the corner and Castiel mentally catalogues what’s in his fridge, intent on making the best breakfast possible with his meager cooking skills.
That’s okay. His pajamas are clean so he pulls them back on but the zipper is too hard so he just does the sticky tab at the top under his chin. His belly is poking out but that’s okay. He has a cute belly. Daddy says so. Dean likes his belly, too. Claire might like his belly. Jack will have to ask her when she wakes up. He jumps up to turn off the bathroom light but it’s too dark so he jumps up again to turn it back on. Then he closes the door almost
“ Looking for stuff that’s stuck.” Dean explains simply. He reaches in and scrapes a black sock from the metal side and shows it to Jack. “ See? The spinning flattens them against the sides.”
Eventually Jess pokes him in the side with her elbow, gaining his attention. “ What?” There’s no telling what he’s missed in his daze.
Cas’ gaze can’t seem to decide where to look first, blue eyes flicking back and forth, up and down. “ Very much.”
Castiel hangs on, even more determined, and keeps Dean’s cock nestled snugly in the back of his throat as he hums low and deep. He pulls back only enough to grab a breath through his nose then is right back at it, gently dragging lovely moans and blissful expressions from the younger man. Castiel has taken only three measured breaths when Dean’s legs lock up around him. Fingertips dig painfully into his wrist, the other hand fists in the comforter near his elbow.
He’s sprinting down the hall, running the well memorized route to Jess’ chosen hospital in his head, and totally not thinking about how he basically just held hands with Cas.
Castiel ignores the joke, lifting his body enough to skim his hand down Dean’s front until he reaches that glorious juncture between his legs. He cups the cock under lace, fingers gently rubbing over the balls below.  “ These are beautiful on you.” Beautiful because Dean is wearing them, not the other way around. On their own, the panties would certainly be pretty to look at, but nothing more. But on Dean… Castiel would like to expound more on why Dean shouldn’t be ashamed, shouldn’t be nervous. And one day soon, he will. He will pin Dean to this bed and whisper loving compliments and dirty little sweet nothings into Dean’s skin until he utterly destroys that last bit of ingrained masculine shame.
dude, ur barefoot all the freakn time, makes my own feet cold just lookin at ya
It’s a video this time and he puts his earbuds in, not wanting to disturb Aaron at his desk across the way. It takes a moment to load, then Jess’ bright laughter is pouring through the speakers. The image comes to life, a naked Alex filling the frame, one of Dean’s hands resting on top of the little belly. The camera slowly pans up to show Sam through the open bathroom door, bent over the sink, sucking water directly from the faucet and spitting. Gagging loudly.
Well, you are lovely when you blush :)
Castiel wonders, very briefly,  what other information Alex is passing along to her younger adopted siblings, but instead turns his attention to saving Dean from Claire’s precociousness. “ I’m sure Dean is also aware of how contagious mononucleosis is. Just as I’m sure Nurse Alex also told Kai and Patience about the more common ways mono is transmitted, especially among children and teens. How else can you catch mono, Claire ?” He waits patiently for Claire to fill in the blanks, her sharp, if somewhat selective, memory always surprising him.
Before he met Amelia Kline, Castiel had done little more than casual flings and a few short term relationships meant mostly to explore his budding sexuality. He had fun, he made friends, but never felt the need to take any of it further. Though he was certainly curious about more.
immediately springs to mind, as it often does. “ Go brush your teeth and use the bathroom first, then we’ll see.” He cups his palm over the top of her head and gives a nudge toward the hallway. Claire heaves a sigh, but does as she’s instructed. Castiel waits until he hears the bathroom door close before turning back to his guest. “ I’m sorry. I completely forgot what time it was.” He leads the older man to the kitchen table and its thickly cushioned chairs and busies himself with drinks.
to step up to the plate.”
“ Och, it’s mad to start a relationship at any point in life, Tweetie Pie.” Rowena waves her hand in a dismissive gesture. “ Causes wrinkles.”
Castiel should tell Meg the whole truth. It’s not that he’s afraid of losing what he currently has with Dean, though it would hurt him immensely if that did happen. What really frightens Castiel is the thought that telling Dean would take away the possibility for more. Because Castiel wants more with Dean. He knows it’s reckless and messy and so very very complicated with the children and the legal battles. Castiel shouldn’t even be thinking about any kind of relationship- sexual or romantic- until Nick Adler is firmly locked away and Jack’s adoption is finalized. A couple of years, at the very least, even with Gabriel’s legal assistance.
“ Well, “ Claire holds up her hand and begins counting points off her fingers. “ He’s a pee-dee-uh-trih-shun.” Claire sounds the long word out phonetically. “ He’s really good with Alex and Jack. And he’s pretty cool with me. He has a lot of video games to play, and is really funny, so… Yeah. I think he’d be a good dad.”
Jack ends the heated debate by popping up, nearly banging Dean’s chin, squealing at the TV screen.” Bee ger! Loo da bee ger!”
“ Yes, ma’am,” Dean enthusiastically replies as he closes the file folder on his desk and shoves it under his keyboard to finish it later. He’ll happily take an infectious disease over his paperwork any day.
“ Gonna have manly food. Watch some skin fliks. Tap a keg. The works.” Dean is still making faces at his nephew from across the room, even though he knows the infant can’t see him clearly. But Alex is gleefully reacting to Dean’s overdramatic voice, spitting and grunting and vocalizing in his new baby ways. It gives Dean endless joy to watch the tiny infant squirming in his seat, so many memories of Sammy coming back to him.
“ Alas, sleeping and parenting are mutually exclusive activities.” Castiel jokes, tilting his face to get an awkward kiss onto the top of Dean’s head. He nearly gets a hard skull against his nose when Dean suddenly pops half up, looking equal parts angry and spooked.
By the end, there’s a hint of uncertainty in Dean’s voice, the shrug of his shoulders. Castiel wants to hug it out of the younger man which is all sorts of inappropriate and overly dramatic and just not like him at all. He takes a step back,  heel sliding on the gravel, just to remind himself that he needs to go. “ Oh, I don’t want to impose on--”
Cain toes around the inside of the bag on the ground, searching. Apparently finding nothing of note, he turns his keen gaze to the box. “ I don’t see any tags or names on it.” Cain takes the box from Dean, turning it slowly in his hands to examine each side.  Finding only the pre-printed company logo, he unfolds the cardboard flaps holding the top together and opens the box. Cain reaches in and pulls out a bright red dragon-ish plush toy.
Another careful roll.
The flames are thick on the undercarriage of the black car, licking high into the air. Over the roar, Castiel can make out someone yelling.
It was killing him, but Dean stilled, letting Castiel adjust.  “Tell me when to move Angel.”
Dean looked at him incredulously. "Acceptable? Fucking hell Cas, you are exceptional. How could you think you aren't?"
“It wasn’t, but I really like the sound of that right now,” said Castiel gasping.
Clapping his hands together, Gabriel jumped to his feet and slapped Dean on the arm.  “You are going to love this.”  He pushed Dean towards to the kitchen, “easier if I show you.”  Leading the way now, Gabriel showed Dean a door that led off the kitchen and ushered him through.  Dean was hit with a strong smell of lemon disinfectant and cleaning fluid before Gabriel flipped the light switch, the room sprang to life in a blast of light that seemed to be coming from all angles in the room.
"Sam, this is Cas.  He helped me out first day at school.  Cas, this is Sammy.  My genius younger brother," Dean said waving his hand to each as he spoke.
Dean unlocked his phone and passed it over to Gabriel without saying a word.  Dean didn’t want to see Gabriel’s expression, but heard him swear, as he made his way through the kitchen to the Playroom, Benny on his heels.
Castiel didn’t seem to notice, and quickly he opened the front door and led Dean back to the Impala.    “I presumed you would prefer to drive?”
The journey to the hospital didn’t take long, but Dean had a few more contractions along the way, during which he gripped the interior door handle of the car and gritted his teeth.
Dean watched for a moment, just to make sure Sammy reached the doors. Dean knew that Sam needed this. Sam was wicked smart, bordering on genius level, and this was Dean’s big chance to have Sam demonstrate that to his father and school system.    This year more than any other would make a difference.   If Sam did well in the end of year exams he could take those results, and it would boost him through High School.
Taking control of the situation, Dean pushed Castiel backwards gently, smiling slightly as Castiel pulled him down with him, preserving their closeness.
Castiel nodded.
Castiel relaxed back against Dean, sighing his response, “awesome.”
“A girl someone or a guy someone?”
Castiel squirmed embarrassed.  “Dean…”
When Dean arrived home that evening and Sammy was in the bathroom, he gave his Dad a quick hug.    They weren’t big physical contact in their family, and it surprised John.

The pair of them people watched a bit more, picking out little details of people and clothing that caught Castiel’s interest, before finishing their coffees and making their way to the shops.
“First, I want to watch you undress,” said Dean.  “Then I want you naked and lying on your back Angel.”
By nine o’clock Dean was getting very worried. A very uncomfortable feeling was building in his stomach.  He texted Gabriel.
Castiel blushed.  “I didn’t want to advertise the Novak name.   We should be OK here, but just in case.  I hope you don’t mind.”
“I want to.   For all your help.  For both of your help.”
“More than anything,” Dean panted. “I want this, I want you.”
**  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL **
Plot points:
“But why aren’t you sitting with them?”
Dean deals with Benny's death and funeral.  Castiel runs into a friend.
“Don’t talk like that,” said Sam, shocked. “You’re going to be fine. You both will.”
There was something about the Alpha that made Dean trust him, that made Dean’s Omega respond to him. Yes, the Alpha had looked after him, and not taken advantage when he had broken down the previous night. Was that it? Was it just the first bit of kindness he’d been given in such a long time confusing him?
Castiel tried unsuccessfully for several minutes to tune the radio, but unfortunately, there was nothing but the hiss of static.
Almost as soon as Gabriel and Sam had left the driveway, Dean had turned to Castiel, a predatory look in his eyes.   “Want you, Angel,” he said, his voice filled with desire.
ring, “Hey Dad.  Yeah, not at school at the moment.  No, Sammy’s fine.   Er, something else kinda came up…..”
“Thank you,” said Castiel taking several of the ones he liked.  “I think I’m just about ready for round two.”   He quickly slipped a single elasticated bracelet of alternating black and red beads around his wrist, thinking it would match the shirt he was now wearing, “What do you think?”
From Castiel, Monday 12.21pm.         Probably very wise.
… ~~~ ...
For the second time that day Dean explained the details his plan, and what happened at the cabin.   About halfway through he found himself gravitating toward Castiel, leaning against the table, allowing Castiel to reach out and gently place his hand on the small of Dean’s back.  He didn’t mention about the fake recording of him and Cas in the cabin, and wrapped up the story, telling Gabriel what Sheriff Mills had said about having to go to court.
Castiel returned to school, and this time Dean did everything he could to make sure he was escorted everywhere by Dean as much as possible.   Ostensibly Dean was there to carry Castiel’s rucksack.  Castiel’s arm was in a sling, and although they were hidden under his clothes, his leg was still bandaged and sore.  Dean fussed around Castiel like an old mother hen.   Insisting that Castiel took a seat, before getting Castiel’s lunch, helping him open the screw cap on his drinks bottle because he couldn’t manage it one handed, and generally worrying over making him comfortable.
Steadying himself against the desk and using his satchel like a shield across his body, the boy finally looked up at Dean.    “Castiel.”   Taking in Dean’s puzzled expression, “My name is Castiel,” said the boy more clearly.
“Well I gotta go...” said Dean, at the exact same moment Castiel said, “I need to head back.”
Dean’s back was mostly just scratched and dirty.  The paramedic gave him instructions on cleaning and treating the scratches, but again agreed that he could leave.
Puzzled, Dean went to the kitchen. No Cas either. A quick glance around the room showed that nothing was disturbed. Alternating between deep concern and the realisation that Cas was a capable individual that didn’t need looking after. Dean checked the various common areas of the bunker. It was only when he reached the garage area that he noticed that one of the motorbikes, an old Triumph 6/1 was missing.
“Yes, Angel,” said Dean laughing himself now, and kissing Castiel apologetically.
"CASTIEL!" cried out Dean, as his whole body stiffen and shuddered underneath Cas as his orgasm hit, at exactly the same moment as Cas threw his head back and shouted "DEAN!" as he too came against Dean's cock. There was a mutual loss of sanity between them, as they both rode out the spasms enjoying the pleasure and warmth their combined cum created between them.
From Dean, Monday 12.18pm.            Most boys and girls your age would be keen to listen in.
Castiel scoffed.  “You know that’s not true.”  He sighed, “It’s been good having you around this week.   In a way it makes it harder to say goodbye.  I got a taste of what living with you would be like.”
“Some things, some people are worth fighting for,” said Dean.  “I’ll defend myself when I have to.  But a few words don’t bother me personally.”
“I’m sorry, did I hurt you?” said Cas running his hand across Dean’s chest across his t-shirt.
“Yeah, that night I brought you home.   Well, I kinda disgraced myself by acknowledging I’d seen them,” said Dean grimacing.
Their kisses turned from passionate to dirty and needy.   Dean could feel Castiel’s hips rolling against him, creating a delicious friction.   Dean could feel the desire in him, he would need just a few more seconds to lose himself in Castiel.
Cas seemed to understand. Cas took the opportunity to pull off his t-shirt, and slowly lowered himself over Dean, for a kiss. As Cas moved, Dean raised his hips and managed to push his jeans down just enough to free himself and sighed deeply as Cas slotted between his legs, pressing on to him in just the right way.
“How’s Cas?” asked Sam.
The rest of Alistair’s little posse were already loaded into the back of the police cars.  Instead of a mob filled with moral indignation that they first appeared to be, they now all looked like scared children.
Dean lay there for a moment thinking back to that moment; the pleasure and ecstasy of Cas taking him, all of him in his mouth.
"Dean, what's wrong?"
Dean could feel Cas’s erection very obviously pressing against his own. Although Cas was wearing sweatpants, Dean’s jean’s felt too constricting. He moaned against Cas, wanting to feel friction, but just feeling uncomfortable.
“Anything else?”
“Don’t mention SPEW,” said Benny joining in the conversation.  “That was weak.  I am glad they got rid of that.”
“My people skills are rusty,” Castiel deadpanned.
There! Was that a glint of something? Dean struggled forward, holding the flashlight in front of him trying to gain a few precious inches of extended light capability. Yes! There was something ahead.
Thanks again to everyone who has read and left comments/kudos.   I would also encourage anyone who reads, and doesn't think it's worth a kudos to give me a comment why.   I can't work on improving, if I don't know what's wrong.
Dean walked to the Impala and placed his duffle bag in the trunk. Castiel walked close behind him.   Dean opened the car door but before he could climb in, Castiel pulled Dean into a final hug.    “I know I said I wouldn’t make a scene. But I can’t help it.”
Sucking in a long whistle of air between his teeth, Gabriel looked at Dean.  “Truthfully.  I don’t know what to think.”   Gabriel held up hand, “Let me finish.”   He took another breath.  “On the one hand Dean, you scare the crap out of me.  The way you handled those guns earlier.   I see you’re proficient and knowledgeable about things I am not sure you should be.    You’re a trained fighter – I can’t think of any way to describe it.  But then on the other hand, I see a young man in love.  You practically took on the whole school just for Cassie.  It wasn’t just Alistair and his gang of bullies; you made the students and teachers see Cassie differently from before.  You helped him become ‘more’.  You’ve now risked your life several times over for him, and today you fought and killed someone to save him.  Everything you did, I know you did for him.  For love.”   Gabriel shook his head, “I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving him today.  I know no one else could have done what you did.  But I am also scared for him.  He’s fallen for you so completely – I can see it.  He’s in love with you Dean.   Don’t blame me for caring about my little brother.  People in love make crazy, wild and sometimes bad decisions.   And I just don’t know.   Are you a bad decision?”
because Dean gets off on danger and Cas gets off on Dean. He slips a hand into his pants, grasps his dick through his boxers.
The shirt ends up on the floor, Cas kneels in front of Dean and in the shitty motel light he cleans the wound. He uses actual rubbing alcohol and not whiskey because Castiel, former angel of the lord, packs a first aid kit now, when they go on hunts. Dean’s glad for the sting of the alcohol and dull ache of the injury pulling him away from the tenderness with which Castiel bandages the wound.
Cas tosses his shirt in the direction of the laundry line and shucks off his pants too for good measure.
“If you had known what?” he asks, tilting his head to the side.
“Yeah, ok. At least let me take you to breakfast.”
Sam’s already got his phone out.
He sucks Cas through it, making sure to swallow. He holds Cas’s cock on his tongue for as long as he can get away with. When Cas pulls him off by the hair, Dean stares up at him. He must be a wreck, lips slick and swollen, shining with sweat, tears still not dry on his cheeks.
What could he possibly say to Mick, or Diran or Nora even. He feels tired all the time, in a way sleep cannot reach. He will probably still feel so tired when his circumstances are not so dire. He's just heavy and he has nowhere to set himself down.
“Steve, hey, you ok?” they ask.
Cas looks up from his book, tilts his head, squints a little and stares at him. Were it anyone else, Dean would squirm under the scrutiny.
“All day, I thought about you in here, fucking other people. When it should be me; you’re mine. Even when you fuck them, you’re mine,” Dean punctuates it with bite to Cas’s shoulder that makes him shudder.
So maybe he understands why Dean is so emphatic that Cas is his and no one else’s. Dean can fuck whoever he wants, he can fall in love with anyone--though Cas hopes he won’t--but he will always be Cas’s. Cas has been inside Dean in every way that could possibly matter. Dean cannot say the same.
“I don’t want to date you.”
Dean wonders where he learned that from. Cas probably hasn’t been watching a whole lot of porn but he’s probably seen more humans fucking than Dean’s known people in his whole life, what being a timeless angel and all that. But observation and practical experience are different things, which Dean understands intimately as he watches Cas head start to bob over his future self's dick.
Dr. Moore chimes in with,” My favorite is
Castiel is unable to respond verbally. What could he possibly say? He shakes his head, careful to avoid Meg’s compassionate gaze.
He sends the photo to Dean with, <<
They’re both quiet for long moments. Meg stares out the window into the dark, Castiel stares at the middle couch cushion.
Castiel goes further inside and sets the pan of brownies onto the cleared table, not wanting to take up precious counter space in the small kitchen. Inside, he can now hear the soft strains of classic rock floating from the living room speakers and smell the spicy sweet scent of something bubbling away on the stovetop. He chuckles at Dean’s observation. “ I believe so. He likes to scratch my stubble when he’s sleepy, but he’s not quite as fascinated with mine as he is yours.”
“ Whoa! Whoa, everyone chill! ” Dean really wants to laugh, but he understands that won’t help this situation, so instead he leans across the seat to get a clear view of Jack still flopping around in Cas’ arms like a bag of wet cats. “ Jack? Kiddo!”
Remind me, again. How early did you arrive just so you could have more time for “ baby smoochies”? ;D
It takes a moment for comprehension to sink in, but then Jack is fully onboard with the idea. “ Dat mama! Taire mama! Din see pwitty mama!”
“ Yes, you are! Come up here and help me add the secret ingredients.”  Dean pulls a stepladder from the pantry, snaps it open, and slides it up against the counter near the sink. Claire clambers up and waits patiently for Dean to return to the counter with a large package of ground hamburger and several bottles of dried seasonings. Castiel listens as they talk about school and baking as Dean shows Claire how to use the lids to measure out the spices into a small bowl, letting her sniff each one first. Dean makes a big show of hiding the identity of the seasonings, man and child whispering fervently together with bowed heads over the bowl.
They’d been just as cute waking up as they’d been asleep. Castiel had placed a pan of bacon and sausage links into the oven, started a pot of coffee, and peeked into the den to find Dean awake, eyes barely open, big hand smoothing over Jack’s back. Jack had wiggled his way up Dean’s chest, little arms around his neck, nose against his throat. Practically choking the man. And yet Dean was attempting to wake the boy gently, petting his back and whispering a soft chorus of,
“ Okay.” Dean shifts his weight from foot to foot. Castiel only notices because Dean chews on his lower lip in sync with the motion. Then Dean is reaching out like before, a firm grip on Castiel’s shoulder. It feels just as wonderful as it did earlier.“ How’re you doing?”
“ Kinda early for you.” Sam observes, raising a brow. “ Anything special?”
“ Uh…” Is it? Is everything okay? The question and immediate answer that pops into his head is enough to jolt Dean back to functional. Though still a bit panicked. “ Yeah, uh, I just… I gotta go.” He shoves his phone in back pocket and tries to shoulder past his brother.
Dean laughs as she shoves a straw into her mouth and turns to lead him further into the hospital room. “ Told ya. I’ve got all the looks, charm, and sweet goodies.”
Loudloudloudhothothot...
and a laughing emoticon. Castiel likes emojis, but he still feels more comfortable with the simple pictographs he first learned to make back in the day.
Then Claire ditches Dean and cuts in on her father and Jack. She grabs Jack’s hands, the boy going along willingly, and they begin their own little mosh pit for two.
The button is undone. And the next. And the next. Dean gasps quietly each time, Cas’ thick fingers grazing his sensitive belly.
Sam vents about his newest case. Jess laughs over the week’s patient antics. Missouri recalls her early days of residency. Alex and Stan discuss some sort of fan convention they’re both attending in a couple of months. Joshua, Missouri’s husband, compares gardening notes with Zeke. Pam curses the newest wave of anti-vaxxers.
“ But those people are all being jerks to her.” Claire frowns, watching the scene unfold. “ She’s sad now.”
all day. And do some prep for when everyone else gets here.” Dean shrugs. He doesn’t seem upset by the situation, but Castiel wonders if that stoicism will hold up under an entire day of holiday cheer with no one to share it with. Until Dean continues with, “ I’ll probably skype Bobby and Ellen that day, text the others.”
He feels oddly calm, walking through the staff door, hearing a snatch of Benjamina and Dorothy’s conversation, returning Max and Alicia’s quiet greetings.
Castiel does not answer right away. He tells himself he’s listening to Claire and Jack as Aaron quizzes them on their favorite Harry Potter creatures. But he knows he’s avoiding Rowena’s sharp attention because he doesn’t want to explain that little scene, as Rowena called it, with Dean. Castiel had simply wanted to ask Dean over for a movie. Nothing special, nothing new. He’s invited Dean over for dinner and movies several times since the younger man moved next door. And Dean has invited them over to his place a few times for the children to play on his gaming consoles ( Claire is an ace at Mario Kart) and share his amazing grilled hamburgers. So no, it’s nothing out of the ordinary to ask Dean over.
There are also quite a few text conversations with Cas, despite the late- or early- hour.  By two in the morning, it’s time for Jess to start pushing and Dean stations himself in a corner, out of the way. Yawning and texting and laughing and cringing at Cas’ anecdotes about his ineptitude during Claire’s birth. It passes the time and Dean loses track of everything until the doctor and team of nurses come in for the grand finale. In half an hour, a burst of cheering and an angry cry erupts from the room’s occupants.
Dean loses his breath for a split second at the sudden cool skin surrounding such a sensitive body part. Then he pushes up into the fist and Cas adjusts his grip and Dean stares down at the hands on cocks working between them, enjoying the color contrasts and shiny precum streaking their skin. Their rhythm quickly syncs up and Dean leans back in to kiss over Cas’ stubble rough cheeks as they both chase their respective orgasms.
“ Do you really think the police would consider it an actionable threat?”
For his part, Jack barely acknowledges Dean’s presence, blue eyes that Dean is certain would normally give his daddy’s a run for their money, currently dulled by illness. And Jack is bone dry, which explains the wet coat and adult; Castiel obviously used the coat to protect Jack from the rain instead of himself. Dean turns his attention back to the father for a moment, wanting to clear up any misunderstandings. “ Actually, I’m a nurse practitioner, so you can just call me Dean.” It matters to some people, the initials at the end of his name. Dean’s perfectly happy with his credentials, but he knows that some parents don’t want anything less than the highest level of alphabet soup diagnosing their child. Best to discover that particular prejudice in the beginning, especially if he’s going to have to reschedule poor Jack with Jess or Missouri.
Castiel sighs. He should have known better. If Jack decides to dig his heels in, as he’s been known to do, he will join forces with Claire and gang up on Castiel until they get the aforementioned puppy from some adult in their social circle. Think fast, think fast! “ Who wants to watch
“ Dink.” Jack declares and reaches for the man’s cup.
“ Fine, but remember you volunteered for this emotional torture.” Cas holds his hands up in surrender and gets to his feet. “ And wait until I have Jack in the bath.”
Dean? I am so sorry.
Dean flips his blinker to turn onto the private road and he snickers at Jess and Sam’s oohs and aahs. A high chain link fence, partially covered in honeysuckle and backed by trees, edges the property and a high, very unpretty, but very sturdy,  electric gate bars the path. Dean pulls up to the utility box set into a crumbling stone post on the driver’s side and punches in his code.  An equally decrepit stone lion stares down at them, its twin across the way,  matching mouths open wide in toothless roars.
“ Done,” Dean nods in agreement and shifts the baby in his hold, positioning the small body in the wide seam of his thighs, both hands supporting the back and head so Alex is blinking up at him head on. “ When are they going to release you?” Dean puffs his cheeks out. Alex appears mildly interested.
Cas bumps his hips up, deliberately grinding their swollen crotches together, the denim just another tantalizing layer of friction.  He grins wickedly up at Dean. “ We have to be quiet. They’re generally heavy sleepers, but I don’t want--”
hoodie (from a charity campaign headed by one of her favorite voice actors), galaxy print skirt, and polka dot leggings. Castiel lets Jack choose between a green dinosaur sweater and an orange dinosaur sweatshirt. Jack wants to wear them both and Castiel eventually gives in, slipping the sweatshirt over Jack’s head and tying the sleeves of the sweater around his little waist. He knows Jack simply wants to show them both to Dean and how can he deny his son when he feels the same way most days?
So Jack tears off another teeny tiny little piece of paper and drops it into the big potty.  It turns yellow, too. And sticks to the other piece of paper. This is fun!
Dean had happily explained when Castiel remarked upon its uniqueness. In fact, Castiel learned very quickly that the entire ensemble is from Sam and Jess’ wedding five years prior and Dean has simply had the good luck to have a classically styled suit that he hasn’t outgrown.
He nearly runs into Jess in the hallway outside the bathroom, the blonde still sleep rumpled and dazed. “ Dean?”
Claire immediately shakes her head. “ That one makes Dad cry.”
Cas murmurs a quiet, “ Hold hands,” to the kids before looking back up to Dean. The antennae sway back and forth above his rueful expression. “ It just seems like so much…
Eventually they get to photos that also contain Cas and both children perk up at the sight. Claire has endless stories of her father’s clumsy antics and Jack babbles on about Cas’ gummy grins. Dean can’t fight his own grin at the happiness on display in the images. Even Kelly, who must’ve been going through hell with Nicholas at the time of some of these photos, looks light and carefree with her sister and ex-brother-in-law, Claire and then tiny newborn Jack in her arms.
Dean’s never been good with words, just not his thing. He’s a man of action, as his brother likes to describe him. Sarcastically, but accurately.
It’s almost an accusation, Gabriel’s tone practically daring him to refute the claim of contentment. And Castiel almost,
Jack shifts against Dean’s side, but doesn’t try to clamber over him. The boy merely taps the simple dark green cover and repeats, “ Dat mama an Taire mama an-hells.”
Dean chuckles, pushing his other hand, keys and all, into its proper back pocket.  The move pulls his t-shirt tight across his chest. “ Honestly, I kinda like her. Attitude is sexy.”
Castiel can barely swallow down the strong emotions Dean’s short speech elicited in him. The fear comes, of course, and doubts. But also joy and anticipation and gratitude, enough to drown out the more negative feelings. How can he possibly respond appropriately to such a promise? Practically a vow. A thank you is on the tip of his tongue when he decides it is very much not enough and instead he pulls their hands up the remaining few inches, twists them slightly, and slowly presses a firm kiss to the back of Dean’s hand. He holds it there, lips lingering on the warm skin. Dean’s breathing has sped up and Castiel revels in the knowledge that he affects Dean just as strongly as Dean affects him.
Dean is staring, the cornbread momentarily forgotten. His attention flicks from Cain’s open expression to the candle near his hand and for some reason the smaller font on the label catches his attention like a ball bat against his temple.
“ I mean, I wouldn’t be mad about it, really. The kids come first and--”
Also the man is soaked through to his white undershirt, like he didn’t actually use the tan trench coat draped over the back of the chair, dripping onto the tile.
Castiel’s smile grows more genuine. “ It could be worse. Remember how you used to say firetruck when you were small?”
There’s a loaded beat and when they begin laughing, Castiel feels a huge weight lift from his mind. He decides they’re both making this harder than it has to be. They are adults, who happen to have some odd personal connections, and are now neighbors. There’s absolutely no reason they can’t be friends. In fact, a friend would be really good right about now. He clears his throat, an easy smile on his face and offers a wave with his free hand. “ Hello, Dean.”
Dean and Cain have a nice little chat over dinner.
Castiel has a very nice Thanksgiving.
“ Dean,” Castiel begins, determined to ignore his brother. “ You should go with your brother and Jess. Have a nice night out.”
, does despite his earlier mood. Because the harder Gabriel pushes- gentle, but persistent- the more he stirs up Castiel’s hopes that a relationship is a realistic and achievable goal. Not just some casual crush to fantasize about when he feels lonely, while convincing himself of its impossibility. But with those hopes is a current of doubt, deeply ingrained, that reminds him that happiness can be dangerous. That happiness lowers his carefully built protective walls, even blinds him at times, leaving him open for disappointment and heartbreak, at the very least. With his life now, it could very well lead to physical harm, to him and the children. And all because his heart flutters whenever Dean turns that soft smile his way.  “ ...I am. God help me, but I really am.”
It’s quickly followed by Jack’s customary, “ Din! Din loo mah sert! ”
“ Well, maybe Dean will agree to be your human shield.” Castiel doubts that highly, but the image is amusing.
But then Cas is breaking free of Dean’s embrace. A moment of pure panicked despair. Until Cas opens his arms, opens the afghan, and throws them around Dean’s neck, wrapping them both in the thick warmth and pulling Dean into an even deeper kiss.
Anything to take his mind off what might have been. And will now never be.
“ Whose human shield?’ Dean is suddenly right behind Castiel, a plate of oven fresh cookies in hand. There’s a yellow striped full apron tied over his royal blue striped waistcoat and trousers, the matching suit jacket immediately draped onto a chair as soon he’d offered to help bake. There’s a tiny smudge of white flour on the knot of his tie, obscuring one of the many tiny red stethoscopes printed on the blue fabric.
“ You speak from experience?” Castiel takes the offered hand and heaves himself up. Holy crap. These are quite possibly the most amazingly comfortable socks he’s ever had on his feet. He’ll have to ask Dean about them later.
“ I hoped perhaps you would get bored with my non-response and move on with your life.” Castiel manages a complete sentence lacking any growl or threat. He’s moderately proud of himself.
“ Uh huh.” Pamela makes a noise of agreement, sly smile still settled firmly on her face. She lifts her beer bottle and, thankfully, changes the subject. “ Think I’m gonna break out some Joan Jett tonight. How about you?”
Castiel lets himself laugh, just a little. “ Thank you, Meg. I’ll let you get back to work.”
“ You, too.”
And then he’d met Cain, two years after leaving Lisa. And Cain had been… Just passing through, grabbing a meal at Ellen’s Roadhouse. Nomadic, irregular visits. Dean never knew when he’d see the older man sitting at the corner of the bar with a Coke and basket of BBQ wings. But as the years progressed, Cain passed through more frequently and Dean found his way into the man’s motel bed on each visit. Days spent messing around in the garage, nights spent enthusiastically exerting themselves until they fell into a sweaty heap and drifted off. Weekend road trips and that one unforgettable drive to the Grand Canyon. Dean hadn’t been that happy in years. But always, Cain would eventually pack his bag, kiss Dean soft and gentle on the lips, and head back out to god only knew where. Dean never asked.
“ Done.”  Cain immediately picks up the awkwardly shaped bag and leaves the room.
Castiel gives a rueful smile. “ For now.”
“ Mahmamah! Pease, Daddy!” Jack joins in the refrain.
Once Dean reaches the middle of Castiel’s chest, licking over the sparse hair, his patience seems to run out. He pulls the sweatshirt over Castiel’s head and tugs his arms out of the sleeves. It’s barely left his fingers before Castiel snaps his hands forward and relieves Dean of his undershirt in a similarly efficient manner. The clothing is discarded on the floor and all four hands busy themselves stroking warm skin.
It’s agonizing to drive past, but Dean wants Baby safely in the garage
“ Dad, we’ll be late.” Claire is tapping her father’s side to gain his attention.
got stuck in Dean’s head yesterday and this might be the only way to exorcise it from his brain. And it’s always a crowd pleaser.
Dean can feel his cheeks heating up, all the way to his ears. He can’t really remember any of that, but he does sorta remember, “ You pushed me away.”
That should not make Castiel blush, but he can feel the light tingling of heat creeping across his cheeks. He hopes he can blame it on the lingering summer heat, despite the air conditioning being on full blast.
Why anyone in their right mind would want to keep a sensationalist trash magnet in their employ is simply beyond Castiel. It was not helpful in his job search a year ago when he realized he wouldn’t be able to go back to Pontiac, potential employers afraid of the negative press that’s followed Castiel since the incident. Castiel had been at his wits end when Gabriel had forced a surprise meeting with their cousin, Michael, who suggested putting in an application and resume to a more distant cousin, Zachariah Adler, who manages the one and only library in the small community of Hunters Hollow. In true small town fashion, the entire government runs on nepotism and for once, Castiel can’t find a foot stand on in protest. He has two children depending on him and he needs a steady income, benefits, and hours.
“ I know,” Dean gets out on a heavy sigh. He does know. And once he got his head outta his ass after those few months of throwing himself the world’s hugest pity party, he’d understood, too. Sitting here across from Cain’s intense gaze, reminiscing over the start of their relationship, Dean realizes they haven’t actually talked about the specifics of their break up, the circumstances leading up to that heartbreaking morning when Cain had packed his bags and told Dean that he was not coming back. God, it still hurts, remembering. And Dean can see in Cain’s eyes, right now, that those memories hurt the older man just as much. So, Dean pulls his arm free, twisting until their hands are folded together. “ It took me a while, but I finally figured it out.”
When he pulls back, Dean says “Hey.” Cas smiles.
“Give me that,” he eventually says, taking the tape from Cas’s hand.
They hold the door open for him. He heaves his bag up and walks in. It's dark inside but once he gets around the privacy wall he can see light on in a back room.
"C'mon, you should take a nap," Dean urges.
“That you love him!”
“Are you going to be this prickly about it when I do actually try to touch you?”
In the back, there’s a profusion of couches and a little kitchenette and a television and shelves and shelves of books, some of them half blocked by the couches.
“We’ll save the big celebration for you an Eileen,” Dean teases and Sam blushes.
“If you give me a few minutes I can help you with that,” Cas says, nodding down to where Dean’s holding the base of his silicone cock, rubbing it against his dick underneath.
Dean makes a noise of denial, future Dean.
& found the heart
Cas laughs, low and designed to be alluring and Dean mouths at Cas’s throat, biting and sucking at it. He keeps it up, rubbing Cas’s dick over his boxers and sucking at his throat, until Cas is putty against him.
Cas lays a gentle hand on his arm.
"You work at the gas-n-sip up the block right?" Sky asks.
“If you don’t start fucking me right now I will smite you myself,” Cas threatens and it’s so unexpected Dean bursts out laughing. Cas is smiling too but also bucking against Dean, urging him on, arching his back. Dean finally obliges, pulling another garbled sound from Cas as he starts fucking him in earnest.
There is a poem about a boy who hungers for the touch of other boys, through violence. Cas thinks of Dean. There is a poem on the endless human quest towards God and humanity's petty failures and endless toil nonetheless.
Crossroads has a pullout couch that Diran insists Cas take. It's clean and warm, though smells faintly of dust and many years of use. Cas doesn't mind. He doesn't mind the bar digging into his back or the way the mattress slopes down at the bottom. He's just grateful, always so grateful to humans for their many kindnesses.
So here he is, on his knees on the bed, in front of Cas, while he fucks himself on the relatively normal part of he dildo.
Mick’s voice goes quiet and intense, “You safe? You need me to come get you? I just got home but I can head back out and pick you up. Where are you?”
Dean rolls his eyes. The meeting goes on.
"Steve!" Mick says brightly.
Dean exhales noisily.
“Tell me if it’s not anymore. I want you to feel good.”
Cas watches Dean. He looks good, thigh holster on, pointing at the map like he knows what he’s talking about.
Dean gives Cas a hard look. He shrugs, “Oops.”
“Dean.” Cas’s voice is soft and Dean looks up at him. He’s golden in the lamplight.
“Look I don’t know how to explain it ok!” Dean bursts out.
"I'm sorry we're not open today," they say.
Dean sighs and lies down beside Cas, depositing the joint in the ashtray, and wraps his arms around Cas. For all Cas was lax and loose-limbed a few minutes ago, he feels like he’s carved from stone now, incapable of unknotting under Dean’s steady hands.
“That way lies madness, dude.”
“Were we?” Cas asks, because he has to be a dick, and because he wants the smack Dean lands on his ass for being snarky.
"It feels good," he tells Dean lazily.
"Absolutely not. What would you hold onto then?"
to the width
Dean huffs but once he's done cleaning himself up and tossing the damp towel at the chair he shuffles up to the head of the bed and into Cas’s arms.
“I’m too tired for this. Can we please – We have a six hour drive tomorrow to talk this over. Can we please sleep now?”
"We don't use this pavilion. Besides, they pollinate just as well as bees and I didn't let you kill them either.” There's water sliding down his nose as he speaks, making his eyes water. He scrubs it away.
Dean tries not to let it sting. They'd had long conversations when they first started fucking, about how pushy Dean could be sometimes, about how he wilted when Cas turned him down and wrongly assumed any tiny rejection meant he was unwanted entirely. Dean's not an idiot. He knows he throws his body at people because it's the only way he knew how to feel good and worthy for most of his life. He’s working on it.
“Do you want me to do it?” Dean asks, and his voice is so quiet, so gentle.
"Shirt on or off?" Dean asks, because Cas isn't always comfortable totally naked.
Cas carefully manoeuvred Dean’s boxers down and used the towel to gently clean up as much of the sticky mess from his groin as possible. He deliberately kept his contact confined to the towel, not actual touching Dean himself, before wiping himself down and throwing the towel back to onto a rock, before grabbing his t-shirt and putting it back on. He didn’t make eye contact with Dean, but watched from the corner of his eye, as Dean pulled his jean’s back up and fastened them.
Castiel had worn his arm in a sling during the week, to protect it whilst at school, but he had forgone it today.   Castiel felt like his shoulder was stiffening up, and he wanted to give it some gentle movement.  Although Castiel could drive, and Gabriel would always let him borrow his car, his leg wasn’t quite ready to handle braking and accelerating yet, so Gabriel had dropped Castiel off at Dean’s home.
“I was wondering about teaching him some basic self-defence moves,” said Dean.  “Hold breaks and maybe a few strikes.”
Thank you so much to everyone that left kudos and comments.
“No kidding?” said Dean.  “You can’t possibly be the only gay person at this school?”
“You sure, man?” said Dean trying to match pace as Castiel hurried down the corridor.   “I don’t mind getting my own, or buying it from you.”
Unfolding himself, Castiel looked up at Sam and Dean amazed faces.  He shrugged, “It’s just practice.  It helps stretch my hamstrings and prevents injuries when running.”
“I trust you,” said Castiel simply. “I’m good without, but only if you are.”
“Really?”, said Dean finally feeling brave enough to approach him. “It looked pretty awesome.”
Determined not to let his mind wander, he focused on the notes on the board in front, trying to make sense of what he read.   He listened to Henriksen talking and realised that he knew the book that was being discussed.  It was a classic, Rebecca.  A little chick flicky for his tastes, but he was happy it was something he knew. He cast a quick glance over the students.
Dean moaned and panted in response.   “Yes.   Anything.”
From Castiel, Monday 8.15am.            Sorry, I was asleep.  The medication seems to make me woozy.  Please tell Sam “hello” from me too.
Billy reaches a decision regarding custody of Jack.
“I know honey.” Missouri pulled Alexis to one site, out of earshot. Alexis glanced over at Dean, and went to the nurses station. Missouri returned to Dean. “I just asked Alexis to call your brother. Do you mind if I examine you?”
“Your Dork, if you’ll have me.”
Thank you to everyone who has left a Kudos or a comment. Seriously, I love hearing what you like and what you think might happen.
“You caught that?” said Dean impressed.   He shrugged, “Dad uses the car for his job, he transports his guns in the boot.  All of which are registered and licensed.  Dad’s an ex-Marine.  He teaches hunting and survival techniques, and K and R training.  No guns are in the car at the moment.”
“The last three months have certainly been the most stressful time of my life, but I am very glad I got to know both you and Sam through it,” said Gabriel.
“A black coffee, please.”
Dean looked at his phone.   His home screen was a picture of Cas and Dean together at the Roadhouse, eating burgers.   Cas was looking at Dean like he’d just hung the moon.
Dean quickly poured him a small cup of water and helped steady Castiel’s hand as he tried to take a drink.   “Here go you.”
“I like Led Zepp, and Metallica of course.   But I can also go for the occasional Rock Ballad, but don’t tell Sammy that,” said Dean with a smile.
Castiel turned surprised to look at Dean, “Shit, you really have watched Gabe’s films.”
“Self-defence,” said Dean.  “No law in Kansas says I can’t carry outside school.”
Castiel shook his head.  “Never, unless you ask me to.”
Blushing bright pink, Castiel stepped out and returned to the spot Dean had indicated in front of the mirrors.   Gone was the baggy sweatshirt and joggers.  Instead Castiel stood there dressed in black leather ankle boots, artfully faded and worn blue jeans, a short sleeved plain white Henley, just the right side of skin-tight and a blue and black plaid overshirt.
"Good morning Sam. Dean" said Cas from the doorway of the kitchen as he entered. He was already dressed in his usual attire, dark pants, white shirt, blue tie and trench coat. He glanced at Dean, and took a seat on the opposite side of the table away from Sam.
“What happened?  What did the Principal Talbot want?  Are you in trouble?  Where are you?”
For Dean everything seemed to be moving both too fast and too slow. He could feel every small movement that Cas made. Making every nerve ending in his body scream out for attention. He could feel his excitement building as each second past, each second feeling like a lifetime as Cas rubbed and stroked against him. He could feel the pressure building within him, he was so close to breaking. “Cas, please, so close.” Dean didn’t even realise he was gripping Cas’s hips.
Sam’s eyes went wide.  He glanced at Castiel, and then quickly signed something Dean.
Cas nodded.  He released Dean and started to walk towards the door.   He lowered his eyes and then looked at back at Dean from under his lashes bashfully.  “But I have tattoos, Jimmy doesn’t.”
“And you had to rescue Castiel from a burning building?” Lisa interrupted.
Castiel straighten up slightly, and glanced at Dean, holding himself warily, worried that Dean might react badly. “Yes,” he muttered, looking down at the floor.
“Good.  Walk up and down and get a feel for it,” said Dean.    He watched critically as Castiel tried to follow Dean’s instructions; shoulders rolled back, allowing his chest to fill with air, or at least as much as his still tender ribs would allow.  Dean had him walk the shop several times, until Castiel felt comfortable in the new clothes and posture.  Eventually Dean nodded and handed Castiel the second set of clothing.  “Same again,” he said and pushed Castiel towards the dressing room.
“So back to Cas.  What do you think?  As of Monday let’s crowd him, be his friends, and not let him give us no for an answer,” said Lee.  “Even if he doesn’t sit with us, we’ll just make sure we’re close by.”
“Remove his blindfold,” said Dean.   Training and experience had taught him how disorientating having a blindfold could be.  It was easy to be overwhelmed by the light as well when it was removed, and if he needed Castiel to be ready to move, he needed to be able to see clearly enough not to end up in the way, or fall over his own feet.
Sam nodded.
Uriel’s dark cold eyes flickered over to Dean and gave him the same look as someone might look at gum on their shoe.  “Who is this?”
Dean felt a little nervous about what Castiel was about to do, but also surer than he’d ever been, that this was something he wanted.  He tried to relax as Castiel moved down the bed.  Castiel kept a hand on Dean the whole time, it was like he was reassuring them both that this was real, that this was happening.
“Anytime you want some more, feel free,” called Dean, watching them go.  “I need the practice.”  He laughed and turned expecting to see Castiel behind him, but he wasn’t there.   Looking around he realised that Castiel had disappeared.   “Sonofabitch.”  Dean spent the rest of lunch trying to find Castiel, but it was like he was never there.
John grunted.  “Usual school stuff, or worse.”
“You should open that now,” said Dean firmly.  He wasn’t going to give Gabriel any grounds for thinking he didn’t fully support Castiel’s college plans.   “It might be important.”
**  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL **
John stared at Castiel, as though he had three heads, and six wings, before he looked down at Sam.  John stepped back, placed a finger under Sam’s chin, and lifted his face so he was looking directly at him.   “Something’s not right here boy,” said John.  “Dean ain’t no fisherman, and you’ve been left on your own for days at a time since you were nine.  Why did Dean want you to have a sitter now?”
Eventually they had agreed to watch the second Indiana Jones movie, but Sam seemed unable to sit still for more than five minutes.  Castiel wasn’t sure what was worrying Sam, but the younger Winchester had checked his phone at least a dozen times in the last hour, and when Castiel had asked a question about the movie they were watching, Sam had to ask him to repeat the question.
The waitress arrived with their drinks, and Dean indicated the street again.  “Pick someone else.  Tell me what you like.”
“I’m fine,” said Castiel adjusting his satchel, looking uncomfortable, as they walked across the car park.   “I like the walk.”
Dean wasn’t actually that worried about leaving Sam alone.  Both boys had been raised to be pretty independent.  But, unwilling to be completely open with his friends about his Dad and his home life, Dean found it easier to keep them slightly at arm’s length.  Sam was a good excuse, and Dean knew it.
“Good, good.”  John opened the door indicating the conversation was over.
This was a lot to take in, thought Dean, as he looked around the room.  “What does Cas think of this?”
Castiel stopped and looked at his brother.   “Do you really think he might….”
Dean didn’t know what to say.   “I’m sorry I didn’t get there sooner, maybe I….”
“Why do I feel like this is a ‘what are your intentions’ interrogation?” said Dean glancing at the door, hoping for Castiel to appear.
Dean smiled at her confidently, “Sure am darlin’.  First day.  I’m Dean.”
Feeling pleased with himself that his Omega was satisfied and blissed out and well looked after, Castiel pulled Dean closer, and nuzzled into his scent gland, enjoying Dean’s warm contented warm apple pie smell. “Love you too, Omega mine. Get some rest why you can. I’ll watch over you.”
“Morning. Um, yes,” said Dean flustered. Truthfully, he hadn’t even considered the weather. He realised that he had registered, from the lack of noise, that it had stopped raining but beyond that Dean hadn’t considered it.
Dean was grateful for any story that took the focus off either himself or Castiel, and he settled back to listen as Zar launched in a long and funny story about how his professor hated him, as he had caught him making out with another student under the professors desk.
"Cas has been helping me with my Latin and maths," said Sam sticking up for his brother and his friend.
Dean sighed and climbed out of bed carefully. He expected to find his usual thick head, and the furry taste of stale whisky in his mouth, but was pleasantly surprised to find neither. He glanced at the bottle of whisky still on the sideboard where he'd left it last night. He couldn't remember a night recently where he hadn't downed at least half a bottle to help combat the bad dreams and bring on the welcome oblivion of sleep. He also couldn't remember any morning in the last 6 months that hadn't involved collecting at least one empty bottle for recycling.
“Yeah, well maybe I should have tried harder to be a friend to him,” said Lee.  “I do believe in live and let live.  But I never really bothered before because I never really thought it affected me.  But shit like this gets out of hand quickly.  Today they pick on someone that’s gay, tomorrow it’s because they have red hair.”
(See the end of the chapter for
A nervous look flickered over Castiel’s face, and Dean kissed him quickly.  “Here, sit down,” Dean led Castiel to a bench made from an old tree trunk, and made him sit.  Dean knelt directly in front of him and took his hands.   “I love you,” said Dean trying to reassure him, “nothing is ever going to change that.”
“You want to convince Alistair and Gordon you’re seeing Castiel, without Castiel actually knowing?” clarified Benny.
“I really like it.”  Castiel undid the cuffs and rolled up the sleeves to try to be more casual.
Lisa looked at Dean, and her eyes went wide.  “Oh.”
It felt wrong to be standing in a film set taking a shower, but Dean couldn’t complain at the wonderful feeling of the water pressure surging over his head and shoulders.    His back stung, but Dean recognised that was a small price to pay for what happened.   He used a hand towel, pulling it back and forth across his back to clean the area.   Some help would have been useful, he thought.

Dean whined in frustration.  “Touch me Cas, please.”
Dean felt Castiel slowly pull back from him.   The warmth that had surrounded them seemed to chill and Dean sensed a sudden tenseness from Castiel that hadn’t been there before.
“Don’t make him change on our account,” said Benny gruffly.  “This ain’t no Grease movie, where he changes clothes and suddenly he’s the hot popular one.”
“Hey Sammy. I think Jack’s decided he wants to make an appearance,” said Dean a lot more calmly than he felt. “I’m fine at the moment, no contractions, but my water’s broken.”
“Good.  Can you give me and Gabe the room?”
In tandem the boys exited the car and shut the doors. Almost like a well-rehearsed routine, they both reached the trunk of the car at the same time, and punched each other in the shoulder. This was their first day of yet another school ritual; their way of saying I love you; I’ll protect you; I’ll be here for you.
“No contractions at all?”
“You’ll get them,” said Dean confidently.  “And we still have a week before I leave.  I don’t know where I’m gonna end up.  But it’s not like communication is impossible.  We can call and text each other.   And I will keep my promise.  I will return to you.”
“Yeah I know.” Benny climbed into the car.  “But you might need me to save your ass, again.”
