“Oh.”
“We’ve got a good group for you here, Cas,” he says, dropping the nickname with easy familiarity. “I think you’ll be happy with them.”
Castiel swallows, reaching up to grab the hem of Dean's jeans. He drags them down slowly, almost reverently, until Dean can step out of them, impatiently kicking them aside. Castiel pulls him back close, one hand coming to rest on the small of Dean's back, and he presses a tentative kiss his hipbone, nosing at the skin there.
Castiel inhales unsteadily, pressing an arm against the wall.
“You defending him?” Anna asks incredulously, glancing up.
“Okay,” he says slowly, leaning forward so Eileen can see his lips. “But tomorrow, then?”
Castiel abandons his water, and folds his hands under his chin, staring right back. Dean smiles at the challenge and widens his eyes, refusing to blink.
Dean’s eyes are as hard as iron. Castiel stares at him, speechless. Then something in him snaps, and he stalks forward, raging at him.
He spots the source of the sound—a beam that fell and crashed. Castiel stares at that broken metal, his heart pounding.
“No,” Castiel snaps. “I’m not leaving you."
He takes her hand.
Dean sits, shaking his head.
He suddenly flips him and drops him on the bed, grinning down at him. Castiel smiles, grabbing his collar and dragging him down.
“I just wanted to do the right thing,” he whispers.
Balthazar rolls his eyes in exasperation.
“’Cause you’re a dumbass angel without a bank account,” Dean shoots back.
“Somebody say Eileen?”
Castiel comforts him, choking out lies.
She steps slowly forward, and Castiel inches along the wall, his eyes fixed on hers.
“Jesus Christ,” he whispers.
They turn off the main road into a dilapidated industrial neighborhood, empty buildings like forgotten giants, everything old and practically falling apart. Castiel darts his eyes back and forth, looking for the side street where the warehouse is supposed to be.
They catch up soon enough, and before long they settle into the rhythm of traveling, the four of them following the worn trail through the desert.
“Unfortunately,” she says. Anna smiles.
“Yeah,” Dean chuckles. “So am I.”
Dean glares at him for a moment more, then leads Sam over to a chair. He sinks into it, or maybe it’s his legs finally giving out.
Sam looks up.
Sam bites his lip.
He forces himself to watch, to not rush forward to support Castiel when he makes his way back to the bed. Dean licks his lips.
Dean rolls his eyes.
“I know. Try to be nice this time.”
Cas exchanges a look with Dean.
“Dammit,” he spits. “God
“You’ve gone soft,” she seethes. “Where’s the Castiel I know?” She hisses, her eyes sliding white in fury. “The man who could twist a soul until it begged and screamed for mercy?”
Perhaps she’s remembering the time Gabriel tried to make breakfast for them and nearly singed off his eyebrows. Dean certainly does.
Castiel digs his nails into his palm.
Dean clenches his jaw. His brother had just the rash quality and streak of stubborn to do just that.
Alive.
and he practically runs inside, Castiel grumbling under his breath as he follows.
Sam and Charlie exchange a look. She sighs.
When Chevre canters into the woods, twilight is not far off. The sun shines lazily through the trees, dappling the forest floor. The earthy smell of green, wet rain on the leaves—it’s been almost a week since he was here last. Part of him is terrified, to return to the place of his attack—but those men cannot harm him now. They’ll never harm anyone again.
“I’m here.”
Gabriel’s voice drones on in the silence, and Castiel closes his eyes, trying to breathe. His heart is pounding.
“Someone’s gotta be the pain in my ass, right?”
Ah, good ol' Ketch. Can't have a Shakespeare AU without a classic Shakespearean villain. We haven't seen the last of him...
The nickname surprises Dean, but he immediately sobers, turning to look at Castiel, who dips his head slightly, avoiding his eyes.
“Get out of here,” she says, pointing at them. “And get yourselves home safe.”
“Hey, hey, no—it’s okay, alright?” Dean tries to pull him up, support him, even as Sam falls to his knees, slumping forward. “You’re fine—it’s fine, it’s not even that bad, it’s not—”
Anna had grudgingly forgiven him his freak out, but she's making no effort to hide her irritation. Castiel’s just gonna have to wait her temper out.
“And in His name, we shall see him absolved of all crime,” the man in the priest’s robes says, finishing with a righteous flourish, before he turns and winks at Dean.
Dean nods solemnly.
Mary slowly lets go of his hands.
“Doesn’t that make it better?” She whispers.
The train car is richly decorated, filled with lights, furniture even—but the most shocking thing is the dead man at the desk, slumped over, a pool of blood slowly growing around him. Anna is frozen beside him, her gun limp in her hand.
Castiel clutches his side, his head reeling.
“You’re not strong enough, girl,” he hisses. “Give it up.”
“Ready to go?”
“THIS IS A WORK EVENT,” Dean says loudly.
Cas starts at the question, squinting at its source. Oh. She’s talking to him.
Castiel takes a deep breath. In. Out.
Castiel hits the ground, gasping. He tries to push himself up, but a throb of pain stabs through his arm, and he falls again, cradling his wrist to his chest. It’s broken.
“C-cas.”
Sam claps him on the shoulder, a smile on his face.
“Go—“
The man fixes shrewd eyes on him, tipping yet more wine into his waiting mouth.
"She tricked me," Sam whispers. "I swear to you. I didn't know."
There's an angel in his bed, and Castiel doesn't know what to do. He rubs his forehead as he eyes the sigil on the wall, thinking.
And behind it, the tree.
“Don’t
Castiel stumbles back, glaring.
“You make me so happy,” he murmurs. “I don't know what I ever did to deserve you.”
“But you’re used to—” Castiel gestures around him. “All this.”
“No, Cat. I’m not taking the key.”
Dean curls his fingers into a fist, dropping it to his lap. His face must betray his surprise, because Emmanuel snorts, eyeing Dean's disappointed expression in the glass.
“Relax. Eileen, yes?”
“Dunno. Just about your car…” He shrugs. “I don’t think it’s fit to drive, man.”
They pull up, and Sam insists on running around the other side and opening the door for Dean, the little shit. They head up to the door together, and Dean takes a moment to catch his breath, shaking out his nerves.
Dean nods.
, Cas.”
“You can’t fight
“Cas, listen—“
Castiel takes a beer from the six-pack and cracks it open. The bottle cap hits the floor and clatters away from him, bouncing through the strips of moonlight, before finally settling somewhere in the darkness.
He was crying.
,” Castiel snarls. “We can argue about it in the car.”
“Shut up, Sam.”
He starts to speak, as Dean comes closer and sits on a nearby bench, watching as Cas explains, his hands moving in strong graceful movements.
She sighs loudly.
They swing around again, and Dean trips, sprawling.
Dean’s jaw drops.
“Demons have control over this world, this domain,” she says softly. “Humans and demons and below. Not anything above.”
The orders might not be coming from my Father after all.
“That’s why, Cas, that’s why.”
“I do,” she murmurs.
Castiel blinks.
Bobby pauses at that. He looks up slowly, shaking his head.
Castiel frowns.
“Only when I finally decide to retire.”
“His name’s Luke Morgan,” Abby says. “And there'll be hell to pay when he finds out what happens here.”
Emmanuel walks forward, wiping his nose with the back of one hand.
“And what time will we get there?”
Her eyes are closed, she won’t see.
“Thank you,” murmurs, one hand tracing down Dean’s side.
Charlie shrugs, suddenly hesitant.
“Well, you sure took your sweet time.”
He pulls again, struggling with the heavy wood, and finally manages to slip inside, entering the cool air of the church. It’s not quite the same these days—the hymnals are gone from their shelves, no pews in front of the altar, all shiny and without dust.
“Here.”
“I wa—I was paralyzed. Was in the hospital for six weeks. They said I would never move again.” He frowns. “And that’s when I heard his voice, in my head.”
He kisses him, he kisses him because he can’t do anything else, and he thinks that Dean understands. He loosens beneath him, easing his tears away as he slips their mouths together, holding Castiel close.
The day finally dawned, bright and cold, and Castiel hadn’t slept. Anna had thrown a pillow at him when she found him still up and pacing at three a.m., telling him he had to at least try to sleep. He waited until her door closed and stayed up anyway, disinterestedly flicking through lore, finally catching a few fitful hours right before sunrise.
Cas shakes his head.
“Brought you your car back."
"I thought all of Abaddon's followers were killed," Charlie says.
“I guarantee you, I will
Gabriel's hand tightens on the strap of the bag, the corner of his mouth twitching.
Castiel smiles and takes Dean’s hand, letting himself be led outside into the parking lot. He’s long since abandoned his jacket and tie, but the cool night air is refreshing, clearing his head. He squeezes Dean’s hand gently.
“So.” She raises an eyebrow. “Want to tell me why you’re here today?”
What is wrong with him? Why does he feel like he's mourning the loss of his captivity?
Dean's going to leave. Again.
His memories from last night are hazy. He remembers the shots, Gabriel plying him with more and more drinks, talking with Sam….and then the fight with Dean. There had been a moment where Cas thought they were on the same page for once, but then Dean had stormed off, looking angry and hurt. Cas winces. Maybe he had finally crossed a line last night, some sort of unspoken boundary. Maybe this was Dean’s new strategy. He’d had enough of the back and forth bullshit between them, and was now going for an odd sort of silent treatment.
Then Cas starts doing that
“Castiel,” he says, his voice a low rumble, and Dean can see his mother melt.
The outlaw holds still for a moment, then looks away.
The other angel produces his own blade, smiling prettily. Castiel tenses.
His room had been dark before, but now Castiel sees it—silver light, jumping blue streaks searing around the edges of his vision as they heat up, as they burn hotter. And Dean is panting in his ear—his words gone—there’s only feeling now. The tickle of his hair against Castiel’s neck, the sharp prick of Dean's fingernails digging into his skin, and that fire pooling low in his belly.
“No, Gabriel.”
But he needles him, and Castiel eventually relents, letting him order one more thing, and one more thing,
“Well?” Castiel glances at him. “Is that it?”
Cas hears the fridge door close, the snap of bottle tops being screwed off.
“I almost died for you, you ungrateful—“
“That prick, no.” He snorts. “Believe me, there are plenty of us who would love to see her fail. We like this earth too.” He glances at Dean. “Heavenly Paradise means no more us. And if Abaddon wins…well.”
“You know why,” he says softly.
“You were the stalker first,” Cas retorts.
“Let him. All that moping was starting to piss me off anyway.”
Feel free to visit me on tumblr and talk about s14, or dumbass couples, or anything! I'd love you to say hi :)
“How’d you meet?”
She holds it out to him.
“Got nowhere else to be,” she murmurs.
“Cas, listen—“
Castiel clamps his hands over his ears so he doesn’t have to hear anymore.
Castiel swallows, rubbing the taste of Dean from his lips.
“No,” Anna grits out.
“Can’t say I like your friend’s manners—”
He stares out at the canyon that surround this small outlaw’s paradise, wondering how far the border to Utah lies, how far the closest thing he ever had to a father rode off to. What has it been now, ten years? Half of it spent in Creede, whiling away the hours in between jailing drunks by getting drunk himself. And then Emmanuel had rode in, and completely turned Dean’s world upside down. Thinking about it now, Dean’s not sure there’s anyway he’s willing to go back.
He holds his breath, listening hard. But he hears nothing else.
“I just want it to be over. I want all of this to be over.”
“It’s okay, Sammy,” he says. “We’re going to fix this.”
This car.
Castiel turns slowly, looking into the mirror set above the sink.
“You are
“No—let me see.”
“Angel or not, I will stab you,” Anna growls.
He sticks his hands in his pockets, breath coming out in hot icy puffs that turn white and melt away into the sky. He glances up.
Dean was able to smite the demon, but something happened—there are flames all around them again, and Dean is convulsing, his eyes rolling into the back of his head.
“SAM!”
“Jesus,” he breathes.
“So, I suppose…I really should thank him, too.”
"Dean saved my life," Sam says quietly.
“I don’t think Dean’s exactly had a lot of practice.”
But this morning with Dean had turned out to be nothing like he expected, and Castiel realizes he’s enjoying himself.
They break apart a moment or an eternity later. Cas places a hand on Dean’s cheek.
Dean shoves him out of the way. A flash of light and Castiel falls—the air crackling with heat and flame. His head slams against the concrete and the world breaks, jagged white streaks obscuring his vision.
“Oh my
“Stop fidgeting.”
He places a hand on Castiel's cheek, pressing a trembling kiss to his lips.
Dean smirks.
“You’re a real hero,” the sheriff sneers.
Dean swallows, jerked back into reality. He realizes it’s been a good ten seconds since Castiel made his request, and Dean’s just been standing here, ogling him like an idiot.
The pain doesn’t hit him until he’s lying flat on his back, then it rushes over him in a wave, almost overwhelming him. Castiel gasps, his lip dripping blood.
He could try something Gabriel had told him about—an ancient Assyrian spell, a sort of cloaking device for any and all species.
“Did you go to school like Sam?” He asks first.
<i’ll be waiting by the door
Dean exhales, shaking his head.
Then, to Castiel’s surprise, he darts forward, practically lifting her off her feet—pulling her in for a tight hug. She laughs, returning the grip.
He grips Castiel’s arm and helps him up, quickly dancing back out of reach. Castiel shakes his head, struggling for breath.
“Could be,” Anna says as she finishes up the last sigil. She shakes her head nervously.
“Emmanuel.”
“Then enlighten me,” Castiel growls.
“Bobby tells me you were falling asleep in your morning lesson.”
It’s the same argument that left Castiel feeling like his lungs were ripped out, and he knows it does the same to Dean—because Dean’s staring at him, his chest heaving with sobs, his face utterly broken, but Castiel can’t stop.
There he was.
Dean starts to grin, a bubbling feeling that starts deep in his chest, forcing its way out as a laugh.
“Hi,” Dean says back. He looks around briefly, then holds out one of the pints. “Looks like this is for you.”
He runs a hand over his face, sighing.
They fall against the metal, cowering as another bolt crackles through the sky, stinging through their blood and whipping them back.
,” she hisses, like the very word itself is dirty.
“I don’t even believe in this crap in the first place. But Eileen sure as hell does, so you better let me know right now if you feel the same way.”
Dean slides behind the piano, running a hand over the wood. He plays an experimental scale, smiling at the pitch. The other piano is okay, but he has a stubborn attachment to this one. He glances over his shoulder.
“Is he now?”
“Sitting up on that high horse will do nothing but get you killed.”
Castiel’s voice cracks.
“It’s you, Castiel,” she murmurs, one hand drifting up to comb through his hair. “It’s always been you.”
“Yes!” Cas exclaims. Eileen shushes him, looking quickly up and down the table.
Dean has to trick him. Dean has to show up. To appear and laugh at Castiel for believing that he was dead. He has to.
“Shut up, Sam.”
Castiel knows.
“You’d just bring me back, though, right?”
She breathes heavily, a lock of hair slipping loose.
Ketch is standing before them, looking cool as anything.
Eileen leans forward, gently touching his cheek.
Dean ducks as a stray bullet rips through his makeshift barricade, whistling right past his ear. He answers with his own round of blind shots, scrambling to get clear of danger while still being able to see the fight continuing. He darts out into a twisting alley, running back to Ellen’s inn. One of Morgan’s men gives chase, but Dean drops him with two quick shots. He doesn’t dare stay to see whether his aim was any good, but instead continues to the back of Ellen’s inn, breaking one of the windows with his elbow and scrambling inside. Dean sends a silent prayer that Ellen’ll forgive him—or better, never find out—and as soon as he has a view of the outside street, he starts shooting. The new direction of the bullets sends Morgan’s men scattering. They must have dropped at least half of them already—and Dean’s heart leaps.
“What coach?”
Sam stops and asks a man sitting on the front porch of his shop where he might be able to clean up. The man leans back, puffing his pipe, and tells him there’s a barber and bath house down the street, underneath the Oswatomie Bank.
And if there’s anyone he would reject immediately, just based on fuckin’ principle, it would be Dean Michael Winchester. The man had been a thorn in his side ever since Cas moved to take the job out in San Francisco, the baggage he’d have to suddenly deal with if he ever wanted to spend time with Alicia or Charlie. He’d tolerated it for a while, for them. But there was only so much he could take. Of the constant insults, the posturing and the bravado. One day he’d just snapped, and he and Dean had been at each other’s throats ever since.
“I hate you, you fucking son of a bitch—you’ve done nothing but ruin my life—“
Castiel sits up shakily. He doesn’t try to wipe the blood from his face, from his side. He doesn’t care anymore.
Dean continues preparing his dinner, hyperaware of the cat’s presence. It sniffs around his table, then hops down, looking around the rest of his kitchen while still keeping his distance from Dean. At one point, it wanders away, disappearing into the rest of Dean’s house.
Dean had started to believe he’d make it, that somehow he’d been able to overcome what had threatened to send him to an institution. The routine had lulled him into a sense of security. It wasn’t that he had beaten his disability, or even believed it no longer held a grip on him. But he truly believed that as long as he fed his need to be of service he could continue his life, be productive, and maybe over time build a makeshift family.
“Change?  Not, we raised Dean better than that.”
Dena was too sore, too afraid to really pay attention to what was being said. He recognised the gruffness of the voice, and the layer of concern hidden under it.  It made him wonder how much time had passed for Rufus to have come check on him. He also felt a wash of guilt for causing the older man troubles.
Dean would mostly work on the car side of things.  While Rufus couldn’t give him the same opportunities for car restoration he had with Bobby, he assured Dean that there would be enough work to be challenging and engaging.
When he arrived in Jericho, the first afternoon, danger seemed everywhere.  He had broken laws by leaving without notifying his guardians, but refusing medical intervention.  Until Bobby had suggested it, he hadn’t believed such things were possible.  But regardless, he knew the penalty, if caught, would be high.
The next day Dean managed to wrangle a lift from his father into work.  He purposefully ignored the looks his parents passed between them as he filled his thermos with coffee.  Bobby’s coffee was as thick as tar, and tasted of it. So, he made sure to always have a stash of his own, to get him through the day.  Or at least until lunch.
So when Rufus finally knocked and let himself in, Dean was relieved to see the other man. Rufus had told him he’d be staying here for awhile, at least until he detoxed for the medication in his system. Dean would no longer have to stay hidden inside, but the place was private enough to offer him some security.
Dean’s eyes flashed open, flicking up to Garth.
“Hey kid, everything you need is on the front seat. Keys are in your mail slot” Was all Bobby said before hanging up.
++++++++++
Dean grimaces at the mental image of Garth bouncing off the walls. “So are you saying I just have to go around bringing people coffee or getting their mail and I’ll be fine?  That does not make any sense.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean has grown used to these snide comments, had learned to brush them aside and get on with his life. He had refused to let Gordon have that sort of power over him. But today, with his dream dying around him, he felt himself sag under the weight of it. Fortunately he made it to his office before the first tear fell, not letting anyone be witness to his misery.
He’d build a good comfortable life that he now saw starting to crack.
“At the moment we wait and observe.  Dean was lucky that he started treatment at a young age. However, this means we do not know how handicapped he will be if he fully rejects the treatment.”
John had also decided that the diagnosis would not impact Dean, or his raising of his son. Winchesters’ were not weak and fragile. He didn’t care what the doctors had said about Dean’s submissive results, his son was going to be normal.  Even if that meant pushing him even harder than he worked Sam.
Alongside work, Dean also began to create a social connection. It was small and fragile, but it felt like a beginning. Every Sunday, Dean would put on his good jeans and best, or at least cleanest shirt and walk along to the dinner.  At first he’d sit quietly in one of the booths, keeping to himself. But time moved, and so did he. Now when he turned up, he sat at the counter.  He’d come to know Jo, the young waitress.  She had been raised by her parents in a rough as nails roadhouse and was now in the city going to community college. He enjoyed flirting with her, arguing about music.
By the time Sam was 15, having a sub for a bother was an embarrassment.  He no longer wanted to go to the movies with Dean.  Only going when their mother insisted.  Sam would slouch deep in his seat, glowering at everyone. There was no longer excited whispers passed between them.
++++++++++
He desperately wanted someone to make the choice for him.  The ambivalence felt like it was tearing him apart.  He remembered back to one of the meetings they had had with the specialist.  He had sat there silently as the woman had told his parents that ambivalence and uncertainty were not something sub-aligned people could handle.  They were unable to process ambiguity or the grey areas.  The specialist had instructed his parents that they must always give him clear instructions or Dean would overcompensate and shut down.
“Not going to happen. You’re Dean.  We have you. We’ll work it out.  Trust me. We have this”
On the days when Dean’s body would shake and he wouldn’t have the strength to stand at the work counter, Garth would appear at his side. The other man would push him into a chair. Dean would find himself distracted and food in his hand without him realising it. Garth always seemed to know what Dean would need, and managed to get it through Dean’s shuttered defenses.  Rufus may have been the quiet steward running the progress of this new life, but it was Garth that seemed to always be at Dean’s side.
“You have special needs Dean.  You always will.  But we, but I believe that the drugs and the institutions only enhance these needs, feed them, make them uncontrollable. But a job, giving you that sense of service, someone holding you accountable, how own home to create, all of those can fill the urges in you.”
He’d found a corner diner, an original greasy spoon. Being a weekend afternoon, it had mostly been empty. Dean had pushed himself into the corner of a booth, planning on only ordering coffee. But then on the counter display he’d seen the pie rack. It had been such a simple thing, but getting up to walk to the counter had also felt like a major achievement.  The woman behind the counter had recommended the rhubarb.  And for a while, he sat there, with his pie and considering his new life.
When Monday came, the first day of his new job, Dean had pulled himself up off the floor and got dressed.  He felt the responsibility to Rufus who had done so much for him, had offered him a home, a job and a safe place. So, while curling up in bed tired and depressed pulled at him, Dean wanted to hold up his responsibility, his part of the bargain so he had headed down stairs to the workshop.
He wondered now if her prediction would finally come true.  He had been grateful to gain his independence and worked hard to maintain it.  There ha been times when he had wanted to reach out, to ask for help, but the knowledge of being seen as a weak sub always pushed him on.  Until now, when something beyond his control threatened to shut everything down.  It seemed so unfair.
After his diagnosis, most teachers gave up all together.  He would never have a career so why would anyone bother.  He did remember Mr Cho, the Korean teacher that taught home sciences.  He was a strange little man, with really sad eyes, but he would smile at Dean and give him his time and effort. Dean wasn’t oblivious to the nasty comments from his peers about subs being only good for fucking and cleaning, but regardless, for a while, he flourished in those classes.
Returning to work the next day, Dean could feel his nerves jangle. Had Bobby just been waiting?  Would he fire him?  Or was it something worse?  Instead the man lead him out back, to the work bay he had spend yesterday working in.  Nothing much had changed.  The frame Dean had been working on remained in place.  While Dean had tidied up before leaving, his tools did remain where he had left them.  However, to the side the large storage closet had been turned into a cramped office. With a gruff explanation, Dean had started his new career, car renovation.
His new home now consisted of one room, with a small bathroom attached. A single bed was placed against one wall, obviously meant to act as both bed and sofa, the room also contained a small kitchen and dining table set.  This would be his home now, or at least for the next seven days.  AT this point Dean had no idea where the rest of his life would lead.
More scarily, running would also mean leaving behind the numbing security of the medication.  Bobby had been blunt about that too.  The risks were high that he would not be able to cope without the chemicals that contained him.  It would be hard work, alone without them, he would have to ensure he gave himself what he needed to keep his biology and mental health in balance.
“Dean.” Mary beseeched.
“We didn’t just wake up yesterday, boy. You aren’t the first lost lamb sent my direction.”
Dean made a disgruntled noise, but gave in rather quickly to the command.
“Yeah, I remember that milestone.” Garth laughed into his coffee.  Dean raised an eyebrow.
As Dean’s health improved, he started to establish a routine.  As much as he continued to hate mornings with an absolute passion, he forced himself out of bed early every morning.  He took the time in the morning to make sure he was well groomed.  It had never been something he’d bothered with in his old life.  Partly because it just wasn’t an established routine.  He didn’t come from a family that was too focused on appearance.  Their mother had cut everyone’s hair until Sammy, at age 15 threw a fit to be allowed to go to a stylist.  And partly, he’d always been worried that people would see his grooming habits as him giving into the urges of his submissive diagnosis.
Dean wandered upstairs, stopping outside his brother’s room.  It remained unchanged since Sam went off to college.  Dean wondered now that Sam had been accepted into Law school if he’d ever return.  His life was moving him in his own directions, leading him away from is family.
He’d also developed a budding friendship with the dinner’s cook. Benny had taken a look at him on his second visit and decided the younger man was in need of a good feed.  He hadn’t been completely wrong.  While Dean was able to prepare the basics, cooking was a skill he had yet to learn.  So, his reliance on microwaved meals, and his body detoxing had left him underweight and pale. Apparently, that was enough to bring out the maternal side of Benny, along with plates of fried chicken and potato salad.  Now every weekend, Dean would head down for a full lunch, and a few hours spent in enjoyable conversation. Dean realised, although with Garth from work, he’d actually developed friendships for the first time in his life.
“You can’t give up hope son,” the doctor said. “This may just be a temporary incident.”
Bobby had been a friend of the family for as long as Dean could remember.  He was practically family now. He owned a scrap yard and mechanic’s shed.  When it became clear that Dean was not best suited for the academic path, it was Bobby who stepped up and offered to teach the boy all he knew about cars.
As the familiar door creak, one he had seen as a feature, sounded, and the engine roared into motion, Dean was able to finally let his first tear fall.
Dean discovered he loved to cook, but this just brought frowns from his parents, so he supressed that interest and only showed abilities that his father would favour. He became good at home repair, adequate at gardening, but where he started to shine was working with anything with an engine. It was through this that somehow he’d found himself being shown around Bobby’s shop.
Bobby had faith in him.  He said he would not be offering this chance if he didn’t think Dean had it within him to fight and win.  But it was all an unknown. The drugs had given him security.  He had been told it was the drugs that enabled him to pursue the life he had. Without the drugs, what would he be?  But again, as he flicked the card over and back, he kept returning to the knowledge that the drugs were failing, and soon they would not work at all.  Was giving them up such a big risk?
As Dean watched his father’s jaw tense, he knew these results meant he’d failed his father. He’d worked so hard to make his father happy.  He lived alone, gotten really good at his trade.  All those quiet whispers in his head, he’s managed to keep hidden.  Hell, Sam, with his shaggy hair and fancy clothes looked more like a disabled sub than Dean.
Finally, as his bedside alarm went off, he dialed the number on the card.  “Hi Bobby”
Dean glared at the obnoxious blaring of his alarm as he reached over to smack it.  It took a moment for the awareness to seep into his sleep numbed mind.  The clock flashed 6:00.  He had managed to sleep the night through for the first time in months.
“You think you need taking care of because you’ve always been told you will need taking care of.  Learned helplessness Dean.  No one told you you couldn’t do this job, couldn’t run half my business.  I just gave you an office and said have at it. And you showed me, and the world that you were able.”
“Not a mug of tea?”
Garth seemed so sure, so assured that Dean could only close his eyes and hope it wasn’t bullshit.
“John.”  Mary hissed, Dean could hear the frustration in her voice.
“So your Daddy phoned again.  This time he says you’ll be leaving,” Dean nodded, looking down at his hands. “Is that what you want, boy?”
Each day had the same routine. Some part of the night was spend curled up on the bathroom floor, holding on, waiting for the waves of nausea to fade. When the morning came, the hot tea became the warm emotional support that pushed him on with his day.  At first, he fumbled with the day.  But as the day passed, he was able to achieve more, small parts of machinery rebuilt, a dead engine coming back to life.  When on Friday, he scrubbed the grease off his hands, Dean was able to feel a small sense of achievement.
His work routine started early, arriving before everyone.  He set the coffee on, although admittedly that was just as much for his benefit as for Rufus and Garth.  By the time Garth arrived, Dean would have the mail collected and in piles on his desk. Over the weeks he’d also started to take control over his own work schedule.  Instead of waiting for Rufus to assign things, Dean had stepped up, relinquishing Rufus of the responsibility, freeing up the man’s time.  Dean was now contributing to the smoother running of the business.  When he returned home at the end of each day, he began to feel a sense of ease settle in, from the service he could see bringing to Rufus.
Dean nodded, making sense of what Rufus was saying.  “So how do you know all this?”
Dean had not done well at school.  As a younger child his attention span and an urge to be in motion in some way had caused a distraction. Teachers didn’t like the boy who was always rocking on his chair legs and constantly getting up from his desk.  And he didn’t really see the point in learning how the seasons worked, they would continue to work regardless if he got a D or an A in his work.
His father disappeared into the garage as soon as they arrived home.  Usually when he visited, Dean would join him there.  Their combined love of cars and engines had given them a place to meet when Dean was younger and still remained a shared love.  Leaning over an engine there was o lingering shame or fear at Dean’s diagnosis.  They could just be father and son.
“You gave us quite a scare, you know,” Garth continued. “Rufus phoned, said he needed help.  You had gone into some kind of shock, took a fit. We probably should have taken you into hospital, but well, you know, that would have ruined everything.”
Dean had found a laptop sitting on the table, with a wifi password card sitting on top of it. He realised in that moment that his use of the internet would no longer be monitored.  His parents, under advisement from the specialists believed the internet would be too overwhelming for their sub-aligned son, so had set strict guardian-controls on all his devices.  Now he had the whole digital world sitting at his fingertips.  At that moment, it had all seemed far too overwhelming.
“Garth said the same thing,” Dean laughed sardonically. “Did I really look that bad?”
He had no idea how long he’d laid there, riding out the pain and fear.  He latched onto those words on the bathroom wall, repeating them over in his head. Time passed in that haze until he felt a gentle hand on his shoulder, pulling him back. The hands and arms surrounded him, supporting him to his feet.  The movement made Dean whimper softly, but a gruff voice quietly shushed him.
Dean tensed.  He had known his mother would try to get him to come home, and that his life was going to change, but he’d manage to fool himself.  He hadn’t thought about losing his job, about losing his career.
Garth nodded, slowly unwrapping the long scarf from around his neck.  Even in the warmer West Coast, Garth seemed always to be wrapped up for the warmth. Dean had originally thought Garth was unwell, with his thin lanky frame and feeling every chill in the air.  But the man always seemed brimming with energy and effervescence.  If anything, he seemed the epitome of wellness.
He’d known this was coming.  Gabe had explained it to him, in detail.  But sitting comfortably in a doctor’s office was very different from experiencing it in real life. His body had felt like it was waging war against him.  Dean pulled the towel down over him, keeping him warm as he endured through that first night.
“It’s not what you do as much as doing something that your brain interpreting it as service and it will release needed chemicals to keep you in balance.  Having a dominant would cause you to release the right levels. Until now, those levels were created by your medication.”
“Or,” Bobby glanced to the door and back again. “You just don’t tell anyone.”
“No they don’t. There are some, some that have fought to fulfil their own needs.  But I know someone, he’s a little cantankerous, my sort of cantankerous, rather than… the other kind. He’s a grouchy bastard, even more than me, but he in his way, would be able to hold you to your task, as you might need.”
“I don’t have a choice” Dean mumbled.
He’d gotten a good life.  He loved his job.  Yes, he probably only got it originally because Bobby was a family friend.  And while some of the other staff saw him as incapable, Dean had been able to sow himself as skilled, with a rather amazing knack for coaxing back the run-down classic cares people had assumed were only worth scrapping.
“Why?  If the treatments aren’t working, why keep them going?”  Dean family spoke up.
Dean continued to sit in silence.  While his grief fuelled the silence, there was also surprise to hear his usual taciturn boss offer such open praise.
“Yes John, but Dean is a sub.  It hasn’t been obvious, but he’s a sub regardless of what you want to believe.  Now the treatment is failing, that’s going to change. It’s all going to be seen by everyone, and Dean… Dean’s going to change.”
Dean stood for a moment, staring at the building.  He remembered the first day he arrived here. The nerves that buzzed through him were only enhanced by his father’s warnings to not dishonour the family, or Bobby’s gift at offering to teach him a trade.
Dean glared at the reference to lost lambs. He had assumed that there had been other people in his position. Over the last few months Dean had spotted a few reminders around his apartment that pointed to other people living there.  One had especially caught his eye. Resting his head against the coolness of the porcelain he’d spotted words scribbled behind the toilet.
So now, even though Dean worked in a workshop that didn’t look like it had been cleaned in a decade, he took the time in the morning to shower and shave.  When Rufus had dropped him at a local department store to get clothes, he’d even picked up a cologne, dabbing it on in the morning. He’d gotten the expected raised eyebrow when he’d gone into work, but Dean could also sense a whiff of approval.
“Why would Bobby fire the boy?  He’s a good worker, and Bobby’s been a family friend for years.”
Dean should probably be grateful that his dynamic position would end up reducing him to a compliant imbecile, unable to care for himself.  but oddly he could find no gratitude in this situation.
“Yeah, but what about?”
But then, one morning just as he finished shaving, he doubled over in pain.  It had come so forcefully, so quickly he hadn’t time to move.  The remains of his breakfast mixing with the shaving suds in the sink. He ended up crawling to the toilet, unwilling to risk being caught be another wave.  His body seemed to shiver from the cold even as he burned up.
After a week of isolation, everything started to happen at once.  Rufus had taken him downstairs to the workshops.  It was the weekend so they were empty and locked up.  Dean was given a set of masterkeys and given a run down of how Rufus ran his business.  Dean learned that aside from himself, Rufus hired a part time office manager, who was responsible for the book keeping and ordering side of the business. While not aware of the full truth of the situation, Rufus had reassured Dean that Garth would not be a problem.
Then there was his comic collection.  Once hidden under his bed so as to avoid comments of the childish nature of his interest.  Now he had them out on shelves, organised in relation to distributor and order of publication.  Of course, living alone now made it less exposing, but he no longer had an urge to rush to hide them.
“No. I’m not sick, I’m…” Dean trailed off with that response, not sure how to answer it safely.
“So your Daddy called me last night.”
Gordon had looked at him, mocking disgust in his eyes and asked. “Don’t you think you should get my permission first, perve?”
“So, I should dream of finding someone with the dominant disorder and be happy with that stranger and some sort of community worker telling us how to live?”  Dean knew he was reacting with anger but didn’t know what else to do.  Grief and anger seemed to swirl around each other.  His life, the job he loved, the hopes he had burrowed away inside him, were all disappearing because of his biology, because of things beyond his control.  Sitting here, listening to Bobby speak as if he had a choice made him want to smash something.
So as dawn broke, he stood up.  Taking out two suitcases, he looked around the room.  His whole life was in this small apartment, and now he had to make it even smaller.  Clothing was more practical, the essentials he needed to live, along with the ratty t-shirt that had become almost a pacifier as he slept.  But he turned to look at his collections and had to decide.  He couldn’t take them all and some things he knew he would have to abandon. Books that he’d secretly clung to were the first packed, and then he looked to his music.  The bunch of cassette tapes rattling in a box seemed more practical than the album collection. He had an old temperamental cassette player, that was probably an antique by now. Sam had always said he’d get him the digital version to make things easier, but other things had always taken priority.
Dean had been young when he had been diagnosed.  Everyone said this was lucky, the interventions could be put into place before his dynamic could take hold.
++++++++++++
Dean took one last look before taking the keys.  Outside, parked in front of his apartment was the Impala.  This was the first car he ever renovated, rebuilt from a crushed broken chassis, and now it stood ready for him.  He had to wonder if Bobby had always known, had been long preparing for this day.
Dean snorts at the word disability. “How will I know?  I’ve never been without the drugs, I don’t even know anyone else that’s never been on the drugs. It’s all uncharted for me, and to be frank, I don’t have a clue what’s going on.”
“All puff I tell you” Garth grinned. “I slept at the desk for most of the first month.  Rufus made sure I would take my medication and go to my doctor’s appointments. Other than that I was left with a soft blanket.”
“You find another way.  I know it’s not simple Dean.  I know those who have tried, not all succeed. I know it is not about just choosing to behave like us, normal people. You will have a fight ahead of you, learning a new way of life, keeping such a big and dangerous secret.”
Dean has sat up all night, staring at the piece of cardboard in his hand. Seven digits that could ultimately change his life.  If he was just willing to take the risk.
“I don’t pay you both to sit around chattering like old ladies” he grumbled as he headed to his office.  Dean flashed Garth a conspiratory grin, before getting up to pour Rufus his own coffee.
Dean came to a halt at the top of the stairs.  He could hear his parents’ voices.  They were having an argument.  They weren’t yelling, but Dean recognised the cadence in the conversation.  Indeed, the fact it remained low and hushed rather than all out screaming meant it was probably about him.  Knowing Dean was in the house, Mary would be working hard not to upset him.
“Like hell!” Bobby’s gruff voice rose, anger showing briefly.  It made Dean pull into himself.  He heard Bobby sigh.  “There’s always a choice.  No before you interrupt, I know what your Father said Dean, I know your disability is said to be taken over and you need full time attention and caregiving.  Well I say bullshit.”
Dean eased his way into consciousness to the smell of fresh bed linen.  He realised some time while being put to bed he must have fallen asleep. Taking stock of his situation he seemed overwhelmingly cosy.  Someone, probably Rufus had stripped him out of his work clothes and into sleep wear.  He didn’t remember it happening but since he was wearing clean versions of the boxers and t-shirt he normally wore he assumed he’d been able to give some instructions. The fresh scent of the sheets indicated they too had been changed. And now he was restfully snuggling in against the pillow.
He always tripled checked the locks every night before going to bed, fearful of authorities raiding his home while he slept. Whenever he left his home, he would scan the streets constantly, looking for anyone out of place, anyone paying him too much attention.   He was wary and afraid of anyone who crossed his path.
But now, as treatments continued to hold back the disordered thoughts and aches, Dean knew he’d let his father down. When the standard half-yearly tests had shown dramatic increases in hormones and brain activity, Dean had really hoped he would be fixed by the next regime of tests. He was willing to put up with the pain, nausea and embarrassment if it meant he could be normal.  Well as normal as possible.
Dean heard Mary sigh.  “And how long do you think that’s going to last?  How long before Bobby fires him?”
When they parked in front of the garage, John rested his hand on Dean’s arm, awkwardly removing it when Dean turned to look at him.
He’d managed to fill most of his days, with reading through various sites online and rewatching the Clone Wars.  But as the week had drawn closer to an end, he had started to become restless.  While he loved learning things from online, and really enjoyed returning to the galaxy far far away, he once again wanted to use his hands, to pull things apart and rebuild them stronger, better.  It was the same issue he had when he had been at school. Too long sitting, too much reading and he found it hard to keep his attention, to remain engaged with what he was doing.
“I didn’t know, that’s not…”
“Bobby” incredulity showing in Dean’s voice “are you trying to get me to believe submissive illness isn’t real, that all those tests are lies?”
It was that sense of impending doom that had him in the car heading back to the family home.  He’d usually resist his mother’s care giving, convincing her usually with John’s help, that he would manage on his own.  But today, his father remained closed off to him, and Dean just didn’t have the energy to resist.
Not proof-read.  If I proof-read I'll think its crap and not publish it.
“So it’s that simple?” The derision and doubt sounded clear in Dean’s voice.
That first week had been one of nervous inactivity and solitude.  He had understood the week alone was not a punishment.  Bobby had made it clear it was for his own safety, to disconnect his arrival in Jericho from his disappearance in Lawrence. That has been something he had to constantly remind himself in the first few days, especially when fears of being locked away in a place worse than Fairfields had crept in his mind.
But it was such a big risk.  Bobby had explained it in his usual no punches pulled manner.  It would mean losing his family.  He knew this was probably going to happen anyway, but knowing it as a one day thing, and consciously choosing it were two different things.  As he sat in the dark though, he was able to acknowledge the hard truth. He loved his parents, his brother, but they could not love him in the same way.  His diagnosis had built a wall between them that they were unable to demolish.
His lip curled at the irony now.  He sat trying to decide his whole future, full of the unknown.  If he called his parents, his legal guardians who should make this choice for him, he knew what their response would be.  He’d be in the facility immediately, and quite possibly Bobby would be up on charges.  So why wasn’t he just blindly following that instruction now, why was he questioning and thinking of a life full of choice and confusion?  This was not how he should be.
Finally living alone had been such a blessing for Dean. He’d been lucky.  Using the argument for normality on his father had brought John to his side.  John wanted a son who could be independent, who could overcome any handicaps.  Part of that was to live alone.  Mary, on the other hand, had been horrified.  Her little boy wouldn’t be able to handle all the demands of an uncaring world.  He would be unprotected.
The surprise made Dean look up, confused.
Dean had noticed Gordon’s eyes tighten, and the smirk form on his lips.  But they had been friends, Dean reminded himself, surely all that would not end simply because Dean had an illness.  He hadn’t seen Gordon the rest of the day.  When he returned, the part he’d been waiting for had arrived, and that kept him busy until Bobby shooed him off home.  The next day, Dean took his morning break, sitting down at the shared table with his coffee.
But then, later that night, Dean was woken by his body shaking. When he stood up, heading to get a glass of water, a wave of nausea hit him hard. He made it to the bathroom just in time.  The coolness of the porcelain eased the shock of trembling heat, but he couldn’t find the energy to drag himself to his feet.
“What?  You waiting for permission or something?” Gordon sneered but didn’t wait for a response.
“No Mary.  Not our boy, he’s not going to become… he’s not like that.  Our boy will not become like them, like … those people.”
Dean knew they had had many arguments.  But, in the end, Dean’s persistence and John’s outright refusal to change his mind had worn her down.  She had never been happy about Dean moving out.  She saw nothing but tragedy coming from the move.  Even as he excitedly moved his belongings into his new apartment, she assured him home would still be there when he failed.
“Don’t be silly, Dean, of course I know. I might not have known at first. Rufus takes in the lost puppy. He hired me at a time when many people still didn’t want an HIV positive person working for them, let alone one that was still often sick. Hmm, yeah, that’s me, so you know.”
So that took a turn to the left and away from where I thought it was going to go. Characters became actual people in Dean's life and no sign of Castiel.  Oh well, I'll get them there.
The idea made him want to cry. But with his Dad in the room, already unable to look at him, tears would only make it worse.
Dean had grown nervous as the week drew to an end.  Too many questions remained unanswered.  There were too much he didn’t know and couldn’t control.  It left him twitchy and anxious.  He knew the sub-part of his brain sought the reassuring weight of another’s guidance, the certainty that came with following instructions. But every time he told himself his instruction was to wait, the other voice wondered, yeah but what next.
Rufus had also told Dean that he would be working at Rufus’ garage and repair shop.  Dean had laughed at that, asking if they were part of some underground mechanic’ rebellion.  Rufus had just rolled his eyes in response.  It had only been later than Dean realised he had never actually denied it.
Rufus looked up when Dean came in. “Better night?”
Bobby sat down at the desk, placing a bottle of whiskey and two glasses between them.  Dean glanced at the clock, it had barely past nine.  But he shrugged, it was one of those days and he no longer gave a damn. He accepted his glass, drinking it in silence.
“No boy, not what I meant. All those tests, all those special needs you’ve got.  That stuff’s real. You’ll always have to live with it, but that’s what I’m saying, that you can live with it. You just need to … recalibrate your thinking.”
A new beginning.  Hope and despair.  And surprising friendships.
Garth just shook his head. “No worries there Dean, you don’t need to explain, your thing is your thing.  Me.  I was too poor to avoid my meds.  Rufus stepped in.  That grumpy goal is all puff.”
In the end Bobby just nodded and told him to get home since it had gone dark. It had not been a good evening for Dean.  He knew he should be happy, should be glad nothing bad had come from his choice.  But at the same time there was an itch, a need he couldn’t name.  He’d read enough of the pamphlets about his illness, and the lessons driven into him by his parents to know his restlessness was his submission trying to take over.  But no matter how much he tried to ignore it, it didn’t want to go away.
A few weeks later, Gordon arrived. He’d been hired as a replacement for Dean’s previous job.  The two men hit it off. Their shared interest in engines and cars formed the base for Dean’s first friendship outside the family.  Dean looked forward to his breaks, listening to Gordon’s stories, sharing opinions of old and new cars.  He had started to imagine this ordinary safe life of work and comradery.
Seeing Bobby leaning at the door, looking bemused, Dean’s submissive instincts flared.  Would he be punished?  He had worked on this car without permission, should he submit to Bobby, accept the punishment he had obviously brought on himself.  But while that part of him screamed for resolution, for forgiveness, he knew he must never give into it.
The first day his hand shook too much to unscrew the bolt he wilfully chose to ignore it.  It had been a long day, he was tired, he stubbornly insisted to the worried internal view. As the symptoms grew, the shaking, the forgetfulness, the gnawing ache in his stomach, he found excuses, reasoning with himself so as to make it anything but his submission sending his body haywire.  He refused to lose everything once again.
Dean went to respond, but the lump in his throat felt like concrete, so he ended up nodding as he continued to force the tears to stop.
“You’re damn good at your job, boy” Bobby finally spoke. “I’m not one for pity.  I gave you the job here not because your father asked, but because I saw potential. Those old wrecks, they speak to you, and you have the uncanny knack of knowing what they need.”
“Dean…” John started and then looked lost for words.  Dean waited but eventually, John just shook his head.  “Have a good day.”
Dean had sat down in the small lunch room, looking through the worksheets when a mug of milky hot tea was placed in front of him without a word. Rufus didn’t say a word, just left Dean with the workshops and the sweet tea. Eventually, the tea finished, Dean headed into the workshop.  He knew Rufus wouldn’t push him further, and he also knew his body would only allow him so much, but Dean slowly started to work.
At first Bobby had scared Dean.  The older man was surly on his best days, and Dean soon learned there were days to give him a wide berth, leave him shut in his office.  But soon Dean started to find the surliness comforting.  Bobby was like that with everyone, it wasn’t simply a reaction to Dean. And once Dean stopped flinching away, and dropping his head as he shuffled off, Bobby started to teach him more about engines and cars.
“Ssh Dean, stay where you are.  You shouldn’t move.” Garth asserted.
“Why?  He’s got a good job, a home of his own?”
Dean laughed. “Don’t let him here you say that.”
It wasn’t that his parents had denied him things as he grew up. Dean was well cared for, and he believed, in their way, his parents still loved him.  It was just since the diagnosis they had stopped seeing the point in encouraging him to pursue hobbies.  Dean, they knew would never achieve the full life of ordinary people.  So they just forgot to give him the same opportunities to explore himself.
Also since Rowling said she made Lupin's werewolf an analogy for HIV, I thought I would make Garth's HIV an analogy for his werewolf.
The grooming he came to realise was his attempt to present himself for others’ pleasure.  It also had been a shock to admit. He wasn’t an idiot; he knew he’d be considered an attractive man.  But now there was an urge to be pretty, to physically appeal to a dominant.  It sat wrong with him. He was not meant to pose and seduce. The urge to give in to the submissive desires fought his learned behaviour to be strong and independent. But without his parents’ disapproval and the numbing of the medication, he found himself being drawn deeper into his newly unearthed self.
He’d left the doctor’s office with a bunch of prescriptions for vitamins and supplements, and a as required anti-anxiety medication.  He would have a monthly scheduled appointment with the doctor to make sure his body was handling the changes, and also, Gabe offered with a quiet empathy, a place to discuss the transition.  Dean had had a hard time getting a read off the doctor, he seemed both empathetic but also quite irreverent.
“You didn’t know?” Garth continued. “I figured Rufus just likes to hire sick people and wait for us to get better.”
So now as he stood in front of Singer’s Garage and Scrap Lot, wondering what would come of his job he loved so much, Gordon brushed past him.  While Dean was not blocking the entrance, considering it was wide enough to drive a car in, somehow, as always, Gordon managed to push into him, shoving him forcefully out of the road.
Dean had blushed and fumbled, humiliated by his lack of privacy. Dean had wanted to keep his illness private.  Of course, Bobby had known, but Dean had not wished for it to be public knowledge.  But his mother’s concerns and fears for her son had blocked her from seeing the impact it may have on Dean’s life.  She was just unable to see Dean as a person outside of the family, or indeed pursuing a normal life.
“Dean?” Dean shuts the door quickly, causing a loud “
“Thanks, Dean.”
“Dee! Guh-morneen!” He exclaims.
“I made it yester… yesterday!” He says. Dean feels a pang of regret. He should have been there to tuck him in last night.
“Right!” Jack leaps, without even hearing what Dean just said. He stands, staring at the microwave, waiting for the timer to end.
“Five more sleeps, Jack.” Cas answers. Jack shoves the rest of his sandwich into his mouth. Dean hates that. He knows Jack learned it from him, but it makes him nervous. He’s scared Jack may choke on something. It’s not completely irrational, toddlers choke on things all the time, that’s why toys come with that label that says “choking hazard”. When Jack finishes chewing and takes a sip of his juice, Dean smiles at him, trying not to let the relief show on his face.
“The things we have planned for Jack are still in the air Dean, it’s not over yet.” She hands him a piece of paper. “There’s something you must see. Meet me here in a week. Come alone.”
“Oh, look! You guys are twins.” Dean says, before turning Jack back around, and dropping him into Cas’s lap. Cas plays along, and wraps his blanket around Jack, as if to shield him from the cold outside temperature. Jack giggles louder, tapping Cas’s arms with his hands, chanting.
“What? No. Maybe- I, I don’t-” Dean hates stammering, but he can’t help it in situations like these. Cas sits, listening intently, waiting for Dean to explain.
“Nothing, we’re very busy right now, and this is lower on our list of priorities.” Billie explains, “But it’s still important, so you better show up.”
“No I don’t.” Sam says, getting defensive.
“Yeah… me too.” He says, glancing back at the bunker himself. This makes Cas feel a little better. He’s not alone in this. But he’s still worried.
“Team Free Will 3.0” Dean finishes his drink, setting it on the table.
Dean made his way back up the stairs, to find Jack on the couch next to Sam, who was browsing the cable programs. Dean looked at Jack, the last remnant of Castiel’s kind heart… second to the bloody handprint on Dean’s jacket, which he had refused to take off to this point. Dean took a seat on the coffee table across from Jack.
“Dean, I don’t understand.”
“A surprise?” He asks, eyeing Dean suspiciously. “What is it?” Dean grins.
“Awww.” Jack says, scooping up sand in his hands, running it through his fingers. “But I don’t want to go.” Cas rises from the bench.
“Mmhmmn.” Jack answers, peeking one eye open.
“And you did this all week?” Dean asks. Cas nods.
- lots of fluff
“What do you mean?” Sam asks.
And Dean wants to shoot it down. So he does.
“I’m just… worried.” He looks at the bunker behind him, toward the direction of Jack’s room. “I’m scared.” He corrects. Dean follows his line of sight.
“Not today, there isn't. No. Today, we’re getting to the root of it all. All of it, Dean. So we’re gonna talk about it.”
pretty adorable.”
“I was gonna say dicks, but yeah that too.” Dean says. Cas laughs. Jack runs up to them.
! And he never should have treated Dean like that. Never. No kid deserves to go through that. To think his own father hates him for everything he is. Even the parts of himself he won’t show. Dean feels tears stinging his eyes. And when he wipes them away, he notices the pipes are completely buried. He pats the dirt with the shovel before tossing it on the ground. And with it, he drops the facade. All of it. Everything he’s buried about himself comes to the surface. He wipes his brow, looking to the sky, a bright shade of orange, dotted with pink clouds. He hears a chair scrape behind him. Jack is at the patio table, scribbling something on a paper. Then he turns, seeing Dean watching him. He scrambles out of his chair to show Dean his creation.
He can’t be, because in order for that to be true, he would have to be gay. And he’s not gay. Not completely. Dean heaves a sigh, pulling his phone out of his pocket. Sometimes Dean will have a question he knows technology won’t be able to answer, but he’ll type it into the search engine on his browser anyway, usually to get it all out somehow, if nothing else.
Dean stands hastily.
“True, of all of us, you seem to have the most experience raising children.”
“And he still has his powers.” Dean added.
“Dean,”
“Haha! Hear that, Sammy? I am the king of coffee. Coffee-King, right here.” Dean declares, pointing at himself. Cas’s attention is called to a sleepy toddler, who has just entered the dining room, a blanket pulled over his head, just like Cas. Dean picks him up, grunting as if Jack is growing heavier, which he usually does to make Jack feel like he’s somehow growing up quickly.
“Oh trust me, listening isn’t the problem here. In fact, Cas is the one trying to get
“Yes.” Cas answers, frowning. Dean shrugs.
“Sometimes, people see something they don’t understand, because it’s not the same as them. And so they are scared of it.” Dean explains. This seems to click to Jack.
“Orcs.” Jack answers, staring at the tea with curiosity. “What’s that?” He asks, pointing to the pitcher.
“Yeah, nice one, Sammy. You know, I thought I would have some strawberry yogurt yesterday, but instead I grabbed vanilla, because I really just don’t want to be happy.” Sam rolls his eyes.
“Mmhm! I help!” He runs to the glass door, and Dean stands, whistling at Miracle. He takes one last look at the shovel on the ground. Maybe Dean’s not the perfect straight soldier John wanted him to be. Maybe he failed him. He pauses. And maybe that’s a good thing. He slides the door shut.
As Dean shuts the fridge, he notices that Cas has completely ignored his advice, and is instead sitting at the dining room table. He pulls out a chair for Dean next to him. Dean rolls his eyes, tossing his bottle cap onto the table, before joining him. For a few minutes, neither of them dare to break the silence. Finally, Cas asks the question.
what you want.” Dean looks at Sam, like a deer caught in headlights.
Dean thinks. He fights a smile, taking another sip of water. “Just try one bite. If you don’t like it after that, I won’t make you eat it.” Cas offers. Jack sniffs at it again, but still refuses. Cas looks to Dean for help.
“The bible is a book. I’ll explain it to you when you’re older.” Cas says. Jack nods.
“I’m making sun tea.” Dean answers. “Want to help?” Jack nods his head with excitement.
“No.” Sam laughs.
Dean ponders,
“Damn it, Dean. Your nightmares are getting worse, and my grace is fine. I can use it to help you. Why won’t you let me?”
“Then nope.” Dean reaches over, shutting off his lamp. Cas crawls in next to him, and Dean tries not to be overly conscious of how far apart they are.
“So you just… zapped me and then ‘boom’?” Dean asks.
” Cas says slowly, as he plants his hand firmly on Dean’s shoulder. Dean drops his head, staring at the floor once more.
Tuesday, 1:42 AM.
“Like hell it's not!” Dean says, standing. “Billie said it’s
“Jack is going to take both of our powers. That's why he’ll be life, death, darkness, and light.” Amara answered.
“That
“I need you to communicate with me. Just Tell me what you want from me, and I promise I’ll give it. If you just want to be friends, so be it. But you can’t be sending me these mixed signals and expect me to read your mind! I’m running circles in my head, wondering what half of what you say or do actually means! Did our hands brush by accident, or did you do that on purpose? Was there a reason you told me to curl up next to you at night, or were you just being nice? How do you know about June? Why do homophobic people bother you so much? Why did you compliment my eyes at the beach? I need answers, Dean! I need clear cut signs about how you feel! Because I feel like we’re doing this weird dance where you won’t pick a side. Tell me what you want. Tell me what you expect me to do, Dean, and I promise that I will. Do you really want me to stop bugging you about your nightmares? Or was that just a game? Because I’m fine either way, I just need to know what side you’re on!” Cas tries blinking away the tears collecting in his eyes, but Dean has already seen them. “Cuz I feel like you’re just… I’m tired. And… and frustrated, and confused. I don’t understand what’s going on, and I just need you to tell me, right now, what it is you actually want.” Cas searches Dean’s eyes for an answer. Five seconds go by. Ten seconds. Thirty. “Dean?” His eyes plead for clarity, for understanding. Dean takes a deep breath.
“Cas, listen to me,” Dean says, scooting closer to better explain his thoughts. “You’re not gonna be perfect, okay, no one is. You’re gonna make mistakes…” he lets out a small chuckle before continuing, “that’s what humans do. We make mistakes, it’s bound to happen.” This seems to discourage Cas. “But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t
“Then I’m staying.” Cas replies. Dean huffs.
“Dude, how do you even remember that? You were like, 4, I barely remember that.” Dean says, “I was scared those doors would fall on you, they were falling apart. Those hinges were barely hanging on.” Dean says.
His thoughts are interrupted, his attention ripped to a squealing toddler, who is one hundred perfect fine, though covered in dog slobber. Dean would be proud to himself Jack’s father.
Guys like me never settle down, never get married, never have kids. The apple pie life? With the white picket fences? I can never have that, Sam, never.”
“Ahhh yeah. I hear about how tricky that ‘stuff’ can be.” She smirks, taking a seat next to him. He lets out a small chuckle. “Anything I can help with?”
not sleeping. It's just a little ridiculous.”
“Nothing’s eating me, Sam!” Dean snaps, tossing down his cards, no longer interested in saving the game. “We don’t exactly have normal lives, you can expect a bad dream to appear here and there, Dr. Phil. Now do you care to help me clean this up, or are you gonna keep psychoanalyzing me?”
“Then tell me about it.” And Dean wants to, but he also feels like he can’t. He can’t bring himself to say the words. But he has to. God, he would have to be a dick to act weird about this in front of Charlie, like he’s got something against gay people, which he doesn’t. He might even
This voice scares him, but he entertains it a little longer, following this train of thought.
“Kind of.” Dean answered, not totally understanding the situation himself.
Dean clicks C. What the heck? It’s just a stupid quiz anyway. Next question.
“What did I even say?” Dean asks.
“You just are. You… you… damn, I can’t explain it.” Dean searches for a way to articulate his thoughts. “I just see it. Hell, I see it all the time. Like, uh… take Miracle, here, for example.”
. Anger seethed it’s way through Dean, as he chucked his phone across the room, shattering it on the wall. Sam, bewildered by the violent actions of his brother, shot Dean an exaggerated look.
“Dean, I’m sorry. I didn’t know. I thought this was okay, but if it makes you uncomfortable, then I’ll just… stop.” Cas’s eyes rest on the floor, his own cheeks growing crimson. Dean sighs.
“And that’s this month?” He asks. He didn’t read about that in the book. Charlie nods, taking her phone back from him. “Wow. That’s… cool.” He lets a small smirk crawl across his face.
“Yeah, uh… I guess so.” Cas smiled.
“Since Sunday.” It’s silent for a moment.
.” He grabs it by the spine, yanking it out of the shelf. His nerves have got the better of him, and now three more books tumble from their places on the shelf.
“What if I’m not… I’ve never been human before,” He explains, “Before, raising Jack... it was a little easier because he could speak full sentences, and feed himself, and rely on himself for a lot of things, but now?” There’s a small pause before Dean adds his thoughts.
“Yes, this is about Dad, Dean.” Dean drops back into his chair, throwing his head in his hands.
“I don’t know.” Dean answers. He’s telling the truth. He really doesn’t know what he wants. All Dean is certain of, is that he’ll do anything to protect what he already has. Cas does his confused head tilt, squinting at Dean, as if Dean hasn't fully answered his question.
“Dean, that’s impossible, we just killed him, remember?” Sam said. Just then, three loud bangs rang from the bunker door. The boys looked at each other with something akin to caution. Dean grabbed a knife, motioning for Sam to take Jack. Sam grabbed Jack, a few steps behind Dean, ready to bolt if necessary. Dean started up the stairs to the door. He held his hand over the handle, which he told himself was out of caution. But he knew he was lying to himself. Instead, he clung desperately onto the small bit of hope that a particular angel in a Trenchcoat would be waiting for him on the other side. He closed his eyes, no longer hoping, but
“Dude, stop staring, it's rude. And creepy.”
“I’m an angel.  I don't need to sleep.” Cas returns.
“No, no play the next one. I’ll stay awake.” Dean smirks to himself.
“I was… curing your nightmares.” Cas admits, sheepishly. He takes a seat at the foot of Dean’s bed. Dean sits up.
“Why not?” Dean asks, raising his brows.
“Yeah, yeah. Hydrate or diedrate, am I right?” Cas squints at him.
“So you think to other people it looks like you and Cas are not just friends?” Charlie says. “And that feels weird?”
“Would you have to use your grace?” Dean answers rhetorically.
“I don’t understand-” Cas said. “Where’s Jack?” He repeated. Dean pointed at the little tyke in Sam’s arms. Cas raised his brow.
“But I
“This is Noah. We’re gonna go play at the park designed for older kids.” She says. She seems to back down a little, though her eyes are still beady and unforgiving. “Come on, Noah.” Dean offers a small nod, and they retreat down the path. Cas rips his hand from Dean. This doesn’t shock Dean as much as it dismays him, for whatever reason.
“Yeah exactly, and then we’d try to predict whether it was getting closer or farther away.” Sam adds.
” Dean almost laughs. There’s four answer boxes again, each with a name and a picture of the respective celebrity in the same box.
------------------- End of fic -----------------
“Well, because it scares them.” Dean explains.
“Maybe we can do that next weekend, Jack.” Cas says.
make you feel?” What? Is he allowed to feel weird about it? Isn’t that homophobic? Dean doesn’t want Charlie to think that of him.
“Hmm.” Dean replies, “Yeah that kid has you wrapped around his chubby little finger.”
Dean startles awake, thrashing around, wrestling his blanket as if it were a monster. When his eyes focus, he sees Cas staring at him pitifully, the same yellow-tinted book in his hand. Dean can’t make out the title. Dean sighs, laying back down.
“Rainbow!” He says. And sure enough, there’s a rainbow flag sticking out of it.
“Okay, but I don’t
“Yeah, sure,” Dean starts, “Because I certainly have that in the works.”
“Just like Spider-Man.” Dean offers him a high five. Jack returns it, and walks back into the living room.
He plays it anyway, it’s only 8:00 after all.
“And bad guys don’t like it?”
“You’ll wake Jack.” He says. Dean pushes off of Cas, passing him to shut the door, before whipping back around to glare at him.
“Don’t find out.” And with that, Billie vanishes.
“I hate that stupid card.” Dean hisses.
Dean grabs the small waffle cone of strawberry, handing it to Jack. Jack takes it, grinning.
“Well, both Amara and Billie are gods.” Sam explained. Jack reached out, tugging at Sam’s hair curiously, as he stood next to Cas.
“Yep. His name’s Jack.” Dean returns, eyes boring into her. He hopes it conveys the message: “
His eyes focus, and he realizes he is in his room. His head rolls heavily as he rights himself back on his bed, throwing himself back onto the pillow. It all comes back to him in a wave of crashing revelation.
“You don’t understand Sammy, I just stood there and let it kill him. I just let it take him away after-” again, Dean finds himself unable to finish his thought.
have to suffer.”
“What about the balance?” Cas asked.
“No, Cas.” Dean says a little harshly, still avoiding Cas’s stare. “I- I don’t…” he closes his eyes, taking in a breath, trying to think of a way to explain it to Cas. “I can’t… right now.” Cas, though visibly concerned, backs off.
“I see.” She says. “And how does
. I have a feeling about this, Cas, I’m serious. I think that if you really wanted to, you could make it work, you really could.” Dean takes another swig from his bottle to avoid rambling on and on. He continues when Cas doesn’t reply. “You’ll be a fine, parent, Cas, okay? If anyone should know, it’s me.” Cas nods his head in agreement.
“What?”
“I don’t… I don’t know what this means, I don’t know what any of it means. What if I’m… what if I’m different?” Charlie pulls away, smiling.
“What?” Dean is taken aback by the question.
“Like Noah? Noah said he’s five years old!” Jack says.
“Until now.” This gets a small chuckle from Dean, who rubs his face, as if trying to wipe the sleep away. He runs his hand through his hair, which he sometimes does when he’s thinking.
“Mmhmmn.” Jack answers, now leaving toward the kitchen to get his cup from the bottom cabinet. Cas raises his brows at Dean.
“Yeah and since Amara’s ‘Life’ now or whatever, and Billie’s Death, I guess they kinda cancelled out.” Dean scratched his head. “Anyway, they said that when he grows up, he’ll be the new God. and he’ll ‘save humanity’, as Amara put it. But for now, he stays with us.”
“Her loss.” She rolls her eyes at him. He continues. “So usually you’d have to know pretty early on if you’re not straight.” Dean says. Charlie furrows her brows.
“Jack, Sam and Eileen worked really hard to make this yummy pizza for dinner. It might hurt their feelings if you don’t try it.” Jack reconsiders the plate in front of him, but still refuses to eat it. Now Cas tries to reason with him.
“No, silly!” He lets out a chuckle. “Let’s try again, remember, when I call you ‘Bub’ you can’t use your powers. It’s like a game, but in real life.” He tells Jack. He carries him, setting him back on the couch. Dean returns to the table, pretending to stub his toe again. “Ow!” Jack comes running again. “Just stay there, Bub.” Dean says. Jack freezes in his tracks, staring at Dean expectantly. He doesn’t move to help him. Dean grins at him. “Good job, Jack! You did it!” He bounces up, clapping his hands. Jack perks up, clapping his own hands.
“Hmm. Once, but I didn’t like it. It felt… weird.” Charlie says.
“Very weird.” Dean answers.
“And you know, if you ever need to talk again…” he nods.
, Cas?
“Sounds like you really crashed.” He says. “Want coffee?” He offers.
Cas awakes to a voice speaking to him- Dean’s voice. He sits up, looking around his room for Dean, but he’s nowhere to be found.
through the room.
“Don’t mention it, I’m kind of a genius.” Dean jokes, taking his hand back. When Cas doesn’t laugh at his joke, Dean grows concerned. “Something’s still wrong. What’s on your mind, Cas?” Cas looks Dean in the eye, sending an unidentifiable feeling through Dean that he was not prepared for.
“You know, dream about the future. Figure out what you want. Maybe it’s the apple pie life, maybe not. But wherever it is, figure it out. And then go for it.” Sam advises, “You deserve it.” And with that, Sam gets up and leaves Dean alone. Dean raps his knuckles against the table, thinking. Trying to make sense of it all.
“I don’t think all people who read the Bible think like that. Maybe a lot of them do, but I’m willing to bet a lot of them don’t.” Cas ponders for a moment before continuing. “I suppose when you hunt monsters for a living, or carry out heaven’s duties, you don’t really have to be nice. But I’m finding that kindness and compassion… human things, good things, are something I want to use a lot more often in what interactions I have with the human world.” He continues. “I find they make most interactions more… positive. More forgiving in areas of difference. I think respect and empathy can be our greatest weapons, and also our greatest aid to those around us.” Dean cocks his head at Cas.
“Lucky for you, I’m not here for them.”
“Because, Dean,” Billie started, “Jack’s not ready to take on that responsibility yet. And the world isn’t ready for it either. We have a lot of changes to make, and frankly, we don’t have time for you to get with the program.” She gave Amara a knowing look. Amara grabbed Jack’s hands.
“Dee, why we put it outside?” Jack asks.
“Then you’re like me. And I’m really not that bad.” She returns, nudging him. He laughs, but it’s quickly replaced with a weary expression.
“What are you doing here? It's- Cas, it’s 12:54!” Dean asks, bewildered. Cas sighs, it's probably best he comes clean.
“You keep sending me mixed signals! One second, you’re upset because someone mistook us for a couple, and the next you’re holding my hand in a park! One minute, we’re stargazing and splitting cotton candy, and the next you’re pushing me away. One moment, we’re watching a movie together, and the next you can barely look at me. One night, we’re… kissing on a bench, and the next, you pretend that I don’t exist!”
“That’s it?” Dean asks.
“You know about that?” Charlie asks. Dean furrows his brow. She continues, “Well, I mean, at the beach when you got stung by that jellyfish and passed out, the medic kind of thought you were a thing.” Dean holds his head in his hands, pressing his palms into his eyes. He leans back, falling onto the bed in exasperation. “But, to be fair, you did point out Cas’s blue eyes.” Charlie says.
“Well… yeah. Good! And you know what? The first thing I’m doing is fixing this damn yard for him. I'm talking ripping up this rotting patio porch and building a nice deck, maybe a playground back there, and a tire swing on that tree. I mean, every kid deserves a tire swing in their backyard, it’s like the suburban code-” Cas chuckles, patting Dean’s shoulder.
“There’s so much… changing.” He looks down at his hands, which are clasped in front of him, which he finds that he often does when he’s nervous. “Amara’s already changing things with the Angels, I can feel it. There’s so many voices on angel radio. Most of them are choosing to stay in heaven. Even with the human experience, they find the concept of free will… strange.” Dean nods his head lightly, following along.
“Hello Jack, whatchya drawing, there?” Jack picks up the picture, showing it off.
“Are things gonna be different now?” Dean inquired. Cas let out a booming chuckle.
“Seriously?” Sam exclaims. He lets out an exasperated laugh, “Ever think maybe you just won’t
”,  a red one reads “
And with that, he folds the paper, and sticks it in his jacket pocket, which is hanging on the side of his nightstand. He closes his eyes, hoping this is the last thing he’ll ever have to do for Billie. After what she did, he can barely stand to be in her presence. But none of that matters now. All that matters is protecting his family.
He continues reading
“What kind of things?” He asked.
“What, about Jack?” Dean asks, still not prepared when Cas meets his eyes again. Dean’s never been really good with this whole vulnerability thing.
“Right.” Sam returns to the game, throwing down a two. “Draw.” He says, smugly.
“No. I don’t hate Dad. I’m just saying he wasn’t a good father.” Sam explains. Dean tightens his hand into a fist, grabbing Sam’s shirt, ready to pummel the crap out of him for what he just said.
“You’re not?” This brings a little bit of relief to Dean.
“Me? What the hell do you want with
“Oh.” Jack replied, “Don’t cry!” He tried to wipe away Dean’s tears with his hands. “There. All better.” Dean nodded. “Good. No more cry.” Jack instructed him. Dean allowed a light laugh to escape him.
“Now what?” Dean asked Amara.
“Cas, are you okay?”
“I understand.” He turns his head, peering at Dean. “Dean, of course I’ll be here. I’ll always be here, no matter what happens. That’s what I promise.” Dean lets out a sob that he didn’t know he was holding. Cas pulls him into a hug. “Dean, I will never leave you. I’ll always be here to help you, always. You know that.” Dean lets out a shaky breath.
“Good.” Jack grabbed Cas’s face in his hands. He echoed Cas’s statement.
“About normal, I suppose.”  Dean scoffs at this answer, amused. He takes a sip from his own mug full of coffee. Sam sets Cas’s mug in front of him. “Thank you.” Cas smells something fruity… like pineapple. “I smell pineapple. Is that normal?” Sam laughs.
“What? No, I just mean I’ve seen all kinds of parents, the good and the bad. You’re not like them.”
“Oh yeah! That sounds like fun, what do you think, Jack? Should we go to the park tomorrow?” Jack claps his hands.
“Come on, Cas, it’s like 2 am. Go to sleep.”
“Thank you, Dean.” Cas says, taking the complement.
“I think I feel better about this than I did an hour ago.” He says. She beams.
“What?”
As Dean opened the door to the bunker, Jack skipped through, hopping over the threshold of the door. Dean dropped the car keys on the counter, and beelined it straight to the basement of the bunker. His speed walk turned into a run, which turned into a sprint. Finally, Dean found the room. He hesitated as grief washed over him. He hadn’t dared to go near this hall since it happened. But pure desperation overrode grief at this moment, as he threw open the door to the room, which to his horror, lacked a certain angelic being that he’d hoped had been revived. His eyes stung with tears. For the second time, he swung open a door thinking, hoping Cas would be there. And for the second time, he was disappointed, because he wasn’t.
“Dean.” Cas says, in a tone that suggests he is annoyed.
“Why?” Cas challenges, rising, and squinting at Dean.
Dean makes sure no one is around when he ducks into the “gender studies” aisle. Maybe he should have gone to some college library instead. People would just assume he’s taking notes for some exam for a class or something. But here? Here he’s a man in his late thirties, early forties, perusing the “sexuality and gender spectrum” encyclopedias like some weirdo. He quickly scans the shelves for something on bisexuality so he can shag ass out of there ASAP. He feels sweat pooling on his brow, and chalks it up to the lack of air circulation and bright, unforgiving lights. His eye catches a book titled “
“Yes.” Cas answers. “I was trying not to wake you up, I usually fly here, but today I forgot, and the door-” Dean cuts off Cas’s explanation.
“Dee! Look! Look how high!” Jack calls to him.
“No.” Dean yanked him back, hugging Cas even harder. “Not yet.” The two stood in each other’s embrace for a few moments longer, before finally releasing one another. Dean laughed, hastily wiping away the tears on his face.
“Oh, brother, you’re preaching to the choir, here.” Dean says. He pats Cas’s shoulder. “Cas, none of us know
“I know.” He says. She nods.
“Not what I meant,” She starts, “I mean, like, do you ever think maybe you
“Bullshit, Dean.” Sam says, knocking Dean’s arm off him. “I’ll take back what I said about Dad, when you can look me in the eye and truthfully say that you’d let Dad raise Jack the way he raised us.” Sam points at Dean.
“I’m fine. This is normal, is it not?” Cas replies. Dean nods, sitting back up in his chair.
“Dang, I would, but I have a job interview today at three.” She says. “Maybe later?” Dean nods.
“It’s just… I dunno. Stuff.” Dean answers, shutting the door, before sitting on the side of his bed. Charlie raises her brow.
“Ohhhh, Baby, can’t do this to me, Baby, just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!” He starts head banging along to the guitar. He starts drumming against the wheel, “Nothing really matters, anyone can see. Nothing really matters, nothing really matters…” he looks at Jack through the mirror, smiling at him, and the two finish it together.
“But, you want me to tell you what it is I want. And the truth is, I don’t know. I don’t know yet. These last few months, getting you back, helping with Jack, it’s been… confusing. And I lead you on because… I couldn't come to terms with my own… stuff. And it wasn’t right, it was awful of me, because I was using you to figure out my own crap, which makes me a terrible friend-”
Dean finally pulls his face back from Cas, trying to catch his breath. The gravity of the situation hits him like 800 lbs of bricks as he feels his face twist in fear and confusion.
It’s nearly 3:30 AM when Dean finally crawls into his bed. He didn’t realize how tired he actually was until his head hit the pillow. As he feels his eyes grow heavy, he hears something shuffle in his room. He grabs the knife he leaves under his pillow. Pure silver, just in case.
“Shhhhh” Jack says, eyes still shut. “I’m sleeping.” He whispers. Dean has to turn around to stifle his laughter.
“Damn it, Cas, it’s not worth it!”
He quickly unscrews it, turning off the spicket. He readjusts it, and screws it back on. This time the water doesn’t spray everywhere. His shoes squeak as he makes his way back to his tools. He spends the rest of the day cutting and hooking up the pvc pipes to make a sprinkler system that will reach across the whole garden. He begins cutting holes and attaching nozzles to the pipes, so he can screw on the sprinkler heads later. When it’s all done, he’ll bury it back up so the sprinkler heads are the only thing that pokes above the surface of the dirt. But for now, it’s all measuring, cutting, and trying not to let the fumes in the chemical adhesive burn his eyes in the Kansas heat.
“Well then would you like to let Miracle inside? We’re gonna take him with us to the park.” Dean asks. Jack leaps up from his chair, darting down the stairs without another word. Charlie lets out a light laugh.
“Gah! Son of a bitch!” He stands, headed toward the door. He slides it open, trying not to drip blood as he heads up the stairs. He hears Jack following behind him.
“Amara and Billie also said that while he grows up with us, they’ll be preparing heaven, actually everything, for him. Something about making all the changes now, so Jack won’t have to insert himself into the story like Chuck did.” Sam added. Cas nodded thoughtfully, following along.
“Dean?! What the hell?!!??!”
“C- Cas?” He whipped to face Jack, “you brought him back?” Jack furrowed his brow, as if concentrating.
“Oh.” He pauses. “Does she think-”
…” Dean trails off. “And he was gone, Sam. Just… just gone. I couldn’t do anything to get him back. Not a damn thing. And I just stood there and let it take him.”
Dean drives his shovel into the ditch. Well, he was wrong! John acted like the world would have ended had he not marched out there and dragged Dean from that field. But Dean’s witnessed near-apocalypses enough times to know that it wasn’t. It didn’t fucking matter if he had spent that night driving four wheelers with a boy or throwing rocks at the window of some girl next door! He still would have left that stover burning, regardless. Who he was with didn’t matter, and if John had any common sense, that would have been the issue. It didn’t matter then and it doesn’t matter now. If anything, Cas makes him stronger. The world would have ended without him. Because Cas was always there when Dean needed him to be. When he truly really needed it, Cas was always there, willing to sacrifice as much as needed. For humanity, for the world, and for Dean. But if John was still alive, he wouldn’t care. He would still scold Dean as if he were that little kid riding four wheelers. He would tell Dean to be careful making allies with the angels, to stay smart, remember who he can and cannot trust. Well. Maybe John could tell Dean who he could and couldn’t trust with a case, or with the details of his life. But John could never tell Dean who to trust with his heart. And whether that was a woman living in the suburbs with a son, or an ex-angel in a bunker with his own son, it wouldn’t matter. Because Dean would be happy, and if John was half the father he could have been, that would actually mean something to him. Well. John isn’t here anymore. And he was wrong. He was
“All better.” Jack says.
“That.” Sam says, pointing at Dean. “That right there. That’s Dad talking. Dad could never make it work. Dad was a coward. Dad was the one who messed things up, Dean. Not you. You aren’t him. You’re better. And you know what? Dad couldn’t handle it, either. He didn’t even try. These past three years, you’ve been helping Cas with Jack and hunting, and yeah, maybe you weren’t perfect, but Dean, who is? You are not Dad, Dean. You’re better than him. That’s why we’re not giving up on you. That’s why you have a chance.” There’s a small pause before Sam finishes, “So take it, Dean.” Dean tries wiping away the tears, but they’re coming faster and faster. He hates it when this happens. He can’t tell whether he’s crying from fear or from relief. Maybe both. He doesn’t care.
“Guess what, Jack?” He says.
“Charlie, when did you realize you were a lesbian?” Dean asks her, hoping it's not an offensive question. She smiles.
“How do you know?” Cas inquires.
“You- WHAT?!” Dean exclaimed. “Jack, that’s insane!! You’ll throw the world out of balance!”
“No? Dude, be serious. Cas knows you. Maybe he just thinks you deserve to be just as happy.” Dean chuckles.
“And… how did
“It’s a rainbow!” Dean looks at the single stripes of color that arch over in a horseshoe on the page. “Oh wow! Did you learn all the orders of the colors?” Jack nods, grabbing another blank sheet of paper. “Red…” he draws the horseshoe with the red crayon, then looks to his first work for reference. “Then or…ornge…” he looks back at the page. “And yellow!” He exclaims, probably because it’s one of his favorites. “Gr…reen… then blue… and purpa!” Dean chuckles.
. He returns to the yard, grabbing the shovel. He watches Jack, who’s long since finished coloring, and is now hopping playfully across the small ditch near the vegetable garden. He leaps from one side to the other, making it a game. Dean feels a smile crawl across his face. Cas was right. That kid really does have Dean wrapped around his tiny toddler finger. Dean shovels more dirt over the pipes. He hears Jack’s squeals and giggles, as Miracle raises from his nap on the patio to lick Jack’s face. Dean feels his heart swell. This isn’t fair for Jack. Dean and Cas fighting like this, when the answer is so simple. But it’s not. It’s not that simple. Still, it’s different now. Now that Dean knows that this whole time, Cas felt the same. It’s still so complicated, but Dean feels less alone. Or he did. Until he went and messed it all up like he knew he would. He continues scooping more dirt into the trenches.
“…but?”
“I’m sorry, Cas, but this… it’s not going to work. I never meant-” he stops himself. “I’m sorry. But I can’t.”
“When will they… they finish growing?” Jack asks.
“Uh oh!”
“Pride… month?” Dean asks. She nods.
“Will you let me use my grace to stop your nightmares?” He asks, resolute in his tone.
“There’s no owie.” Still he hold his hand over Dean. Dean stops him.
“Thank you.” Sam picked up the toddler, who squealed with joy.
“CAS?!” Dean shouts, “WHAT-” Cas shoves his finger in front of Dean’s lips, frantically.
“The game of lone wolves.” Dean answers, raising his eyebrows for extra effect.
“Why?”
” He whispers back, playing along. Cas nods.
“About that day in the basement.” He answers slowly, “when Billie- and… and Cas…” Dean lets out a sharp exhale. He doesn’t finish.
