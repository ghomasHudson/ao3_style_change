“They’re not illogical they’re...“ he paused for a moment trying to find the right word. “Pretty” the doctor said not being able to describe the warm feeling that settled in his chest when his home looked like a winter wonderland during the holiday season. “Just put them in their
The little rant made John stop and turn around. His eyes narrowed at the detective. “Well, even if you don’t like it, some of us enjoy a little Christmas cheer.”
They looked around the flat for a moment taking in their work; John proudly admiring his work, he looked over to the detective to find Sherlock wearing a sneer that could put the Grinch to shame. Turning on his heel the detective made his way to his room slamming the door behind him, and not for the first time in their friendship John wondered if his friend’s head wasn't screwed on just right.
John took the empty glass from his friend’s hands and set it gently on the coffee table, the detective had started to lean against the older man and found his jumper to be soft enough that he started to snuggle towards his companion
“Because it’s the holiday season”, John stated somewhat oblivious to Sherlock’s sneer and continued his decorating process. He pulled some mugs with Christmas prints on them out of a box, unwrapping the protective newspaper which had been crinkled around them.
“Shut up and come down” John turned around and looked up. Sure as hell Sherlock was standing at the window, bundled up in a thick blanket.
“And that warrants the disfiguration of the flat?” Sherlock asked incredulously and threw the tinsel back on the heap, “I don’t see the use in that.”
place” he admonished, telling himself for the millionth time since meeting Sherlock to have patience. Sherlock just narrowed his eyes at the doctor and snatched the remaining out of place decorations from his hands.
John looked away for a moment to roll his eyes “No, none of these decorations should ruin your experiments. At least not as long as you keep away from them while performing experiments.”
John sighed but guessed that was about as good a deal as he would get at the moment and continued the decorating. Their flat had so many odds and ends strewn about it that it was easy to decorate. You could always find a place to hang tinsel or some baubles from. Sure, it looked quite ridiculous, but then again Sherlock himself had put headphones on his wall mounted bison skull. John actually thought about garnishing the hands, currently residing in their fridge, with a bit of tinsel but ultimately kept away from it. He had just pulled out a colourful advent calendar when he heard the detective’s voice again.
Content that at least something had sparked his friend’s curiosity John hummed, “Not so sure about that.” He left Sherlock along in the flat to fetch more decorations from the storage. When he had started this morning, he wasn’t so sure if his plan would prove successful but evidently using Sherlock’s childlike curiosity against him still worked wonders. Whenever he was told he had to wait for something, John could be sure Sherlock would start moving heaven and earth and that usually ended up being hilarious.
“Thank you, John,” Sherlock called out softly as John began to pull their bedroom door shut behind him to block out the light from the kitchen.
John turned and gave his boyfriend a single nod of understanding. They held each other’s gaze for an intense moment, their eyes saying what words could not. They both knew how hard moments like this were on each other, and they appreciated the level of care and companionship that went into thinking of the other’s needs. With a dip of his head and a tired smile, John closed the door and stripped down to his pants. He could shower and change in the morning. Grabbing his mobile, he set a reminder to call the clinic and ask that he not be put on the backup schedule for the week, then he plugged in his phone and turned off the lights.
This project was originally started by me and the_elusive_plot. We wanted to make a Christmas Calendar in which we would post a chapter of an over-arching story every day until Christmas Day. Sadly, because of health reasons we didn’t manage it last year. Now, I wanted to revive this project but didn’t manage to contact the_elusive_plot anymore.
Sherlock pulled a face like the strip of tinsel had personally offended him, “Why?” He wandered further into their living room and took in the sight of the lights along the mirror, evergreen taped to their fireplace and worst of all a Christmas hat on his skull.
Smiling to himself John poured himself a glass of eggnog, before asking Sherlock “Do you want to try some?”
John shook his head slightly. “I will spill any and all secrets I know. I can make your life very uncomfortable.”
“We don’t have any children here.” Sherlock remarked but narrowed his eyes at his friend for a moment, as if to check that he was still correct in his assumption.
Sherlock arched an eyebrow, holding on loosely to his sheet. “Why should I enjoy a season which is the prime cause for murder and includes something as horrid as decorations which are not even topical to that aspect? In what way do fairy lights and fire hazardous plastic shreds help you celebrate the drastic increase of domestic abuse and murder?”
“It’s only because I’ve never seen one filled with candy before.” Sherlock quickly straightened up again. Obviously, he was looking for the graceful way out of his predicament, “Mycroft used to eat all of it before anyone could use it as a count down.”
Sherlock slept erratically at best. They had just finished a case which had him in bed until about midday and he didn’t even deign it appropriate to come out of his room dressed in anything more than the hastily pulled off bedsheet. John had made his opinions on walking about naked very clear, so Sherlock had to concede with a bit of grumbling. His arguments usually orbited around
“Ah come on, that should be enough. Whoever slips now is an idiot and deserves to spend Christmas in a cast” Sherlock whined from upstairs. Clearly, the draft had been chilling down the temperature in the flat considerably.
John wasn’t sure how to take the compliment. At least he assumed it was one. Sherlock was standing at the window, looking like a blanket burrito and called compliments onto the street underneath. All this while he himself was shovelling snow in the light of the street lamps. It felt like any cliché romantic comedy ever. Sadly though he wouldn’t be going upstairs to snog Sherlock afterwards. There was a thought he needed to work off.
“Yeah, tell me about that” John shook his head and got back inside. At the top of the stairs a bundle of blankets was waiting for him.
“I said” Sherlock called a bit louder “You look good working like that. Your body is incredibly efficient in its movements.”
John worked off the comment which seemed to have burned itself straight into his memory. Sherlock never stepped away from the window, looking carefully over the progress John made, offering his advice now and then. All John could think about though, was how warm and soft Sherlock would be under that big duvet he had wrapped around him. At least, he wasn’t cold anymore but he would have to be quick to disappear once upstairs again.
“Sherlock?” the doctor tried to wake his friend as head rested in his lap the response he received was a light snore. John gave his friend a fond smile and maybe it was the alcohol but he proceeded to start petting the detective’s hair until he too fell asleep.
Sherlock grumbled something from the couch looking very much like a child and then finally said “I’ll only try it as an experiment.”
“I’m helping a lot more from up here. I can tell you where you’ve missed spots. It’s a lot easier to spot from a higher vantage point” Sherlock answered smugly.
The doctor had to chuckle, so much for not being interested. “Wouldn’t you want to know that?”  It was definitely worth the annoyed glare which was sent into his direction. “It’s called and Advent calendar. You can open one door every day for the whole month of December, leading up to Christmas.”
“It’s to make the wait for Christmas easier.” John just shrugged and put the calendar on the table beside their flat door, leaning it against the wall.
John sucked on Sherlock’s neck and ground into him again. “I could do this all day. Listen to you beg for me,” He whispered into Sherlock’s ear. Sherlock moaned softly and bit his lip. “You’re so hungry for me. It’s so naughty of you,” He growled. Sherlock whimpered as John licked his collarbone and sucked. “You’re so hard for me,” He growled. “You’re so needy.”
John turned the page in his new book. “Probably because you don’t relax,” He said without looking up.
Sherlock eventually joined John- after he threw a sock at him. He opened the trash bins and threw the frog legs he’d bought into them. “Won’t be needing those,” He muttered. He grabbed a torn piece of paper and turned. Unfortunately, he crashed into John and they fell into the wall.
John rolled the top of Sherlock’s pants down. The newly exposed skin was vulnerable and John rolled his thumbs around Sherlock’s waist. He grabbed the top of Sherlock’s pants and yanked them down. Sherlock’s erection stood, hard as a rock.
Sherlock pulled away and set the riding crop on John’s chest. He drew it up to his neck. He slapped John’s cheek and then smacked the other.
Sherlock cried out as he was shoved down against the table. Sherlock could feel John pressing himself against his arse, and God was it a good feeling. He could feel every inch John’s thick, long cock. He wanted it so badly.
John pulled away and licked at his upper lip. He smirked as he watched Sherlock try to control his breathing. "What is it, the coat or the gloves?" he asked.
Sherlock stood and stared at John. His pupils were dilated and his eyes were hungry with lust. John stood and Sherlock pulled him close. John kissed him and shoved Sherlock backwards. He fell into the wall and John was immediately back on him. John roughly pinned him to the wall and kissed his neck.
Sherlock panted. He rocked back and forth on John’s lap. John thrusted, which made Sherlock’s rocks faster. John groaned and thrusted. As he thrusted, Sherlock’s nails dug into his skin. John moaned as he came.
John smirked and bit his lip. He adjusted himself behind Sherlock and grabbed the younger man’s hips. He slowly entered Sherlock and closed his eyes.
Sherlock and John sat beside the other couple. Their hands were laced together, and John’s thumb was slowly stroking Sherlock’s knuckles. Sherlock smiled and kissed John’s cheek.
Mike nearly jumped at the sudden opening of the door. He turned to see Sherlock in the doorway. "Mr. Holmes, am I free to go?" he asked.
John nodded. "So, while we're waiting, might as well catch up," he said. Sherlock looked at him. "Go on. What have you been up to?" he asked.
Sherlock’s hands trailed down his back and he bent down. Sherlock pulled John’s pants down and took his skin between his teeth. John yelped and then groaned as Sherlock stood back up and pushed his erection onto John’s arse. He went to turn but his leg tangled around Sherlock’s and they both plummeted to the ground.
Sherlock frowned and pouted as he felt the weight of John vanish. He looked back and saw John walking down the hall.
John moaned as Sherlock pressed his hands into John’s thighs. “I love you so much John,” Sherlock whispered into his ear. John moaned again as Sherlock kissed his neck. Sherlock nipped at his skin and used his tongue to draw circles into John’s neck. He pressed harder into John’s thighs and felt the man shift under his touch.
John nodded and shook Tim’s hand. “It’s nice to meet you too,” he said, trying to be as friendly as possible.
Sherlock smiled at his shaving cream covered face. “You needed a shave,” he teased. “The kisses were too scratchy.”
Sherlock frowned and broke his gaze from John’s. John stood up and took Sherlock’s chin in his hand, turning him to look at him. “It’s okay to be sensitive,” he said. “I like that you’re all sensitive.”
John thrusted, penetrating Sherlock’s prostate. “Wouldn’t dream of it, Soldier,” he said. He sucked on Sherlock’s neck while heightening himself into Sherlock. His erection grew heavy with his orgasm and he licked Sherlock’s cheekbone. “Nearly there,” he whispered. “Nearly there.”
Sherlock moaned and his back arched as John slid in. John was fully inside him, wet and ready. Sherlock moaned again and begged for John to hurry. “
John moaned as Sherlock shifted inside him. He thrusted once and John had to close his eyes in order to keep them bursting from their sockets in pleasure. Sherlock thrusted again and again, listening to John’s begs and moans. “
Finally, Rosie came down, hair curled in the front. The shine of lipgloss could be seen upon her lips.
Sherlock drew his hand up to John’s trousers button and unclipped it. He unzipped John’s trousers and saw the dark blue cloth of his pants. He pulled John’s pants down to his knees and used the riding crop to draw circles into his thighs. The bulge in John’s pants twitched and Sherlock drew circles around it with the riding crop.
John chuckled heartily. “Goodnight Sherlock,” He said. They kissed once more and John pulled the blankets over himself. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock, spooning him, and fell asleep to the soft sounds of his lover’s breathing.
Sherlock’s lips met John’s and he completely melted. John wrapped his around around Sherlock’s hips and pulled him closer. His left hand was still holding Sherlock’s wrist and he was now drawing figure eights into his skin. He rotated his hips and ground on Sherlock. He tasted so sweet and he couldn’t wait to taste the rest of him.
John pulled Sherlock back in and kissed him again. Sherlock wrapped his lanky arms around the other man and pulled him in close. John’s hips jostled against Sherlock’s and Sherlock groaned. “I thought- Shut up,” John interrupted, kissing him again.
Sherlock shuddered as John ran a finger down his neck. He slowly began unbuttoning the detective's shirt, slowly, as if he wanted to see how long he could go until Sherlock snapped.
John was now standing with his hands on the table, head hanging low. Sherlock shook his head and inhaled, expelling all the thoughts from his head. He stood behind John and wrapped his arms around him. John sighed in his arms and relaxed. Sherlock smiled. "Are you okay?" he asked.
Mycroft nodded stiffly, and Greg smiled. “Hi,” was all Tim said. He turned back to Rosie’s parents. “Mr. Holmes,” Tim began. “Rosie’s told me all about you,” he said to Sherlock. “And Mr. Holmes,” Tim said, looking over at John. “It’s a pleasure to meet a true hero.”
John, wanting to be inside Sherlock, decided to speed him up by tugging his own pants down. Sherlock moaned as he saw John’s large erection. It was above average and he knew exactly what to do with it. He pressed it against Sherlock’s pants and felt the other man’s moans cause his cock to twitch. John thrusted and Sherlock moaned. His cock tried to escape from his pants and John decided to help it.
Sherlock let his tongue roam around John’s mouth as John pulled on Sherlock’s curls. John’s back was up against the wall and Sherlock took the perfect opportunity to pin him to the wall. He grabbed John’s wrist and pinned him to the wall. John was unable to move under Sherlock’s tough grip but he didn’t try to wriggle away. He loved Sherlock being in control.
over the past few months but he still wore it. Therefore, he still had feelings for Lucy but was coming to terms about his divorce. "Five years," Mike said. "When we found out she was pregnant, well, that was kind of the push we needed," he said.
Sherlock picked up his violin. “Going to play for us, Love?” John said smiling. Sherlock only smiled back as he began to play “Jingle Bells”.
John obeyed and turned. Sherlock thrusted into him again and he bit his lip. His erection was bulging and nearly tearing through his red pants. Sherlock thrusted again and he moaned loudly.
“I can’t imagine that’s fun.” John laughed, slipping his phone into the pocket of his lab coat and giving her a sympathetic smile before returning to his meal.
Sherlock’s thighs tense, and he locked his knees as the pressure built until he couldn’t hold it anymore. Pressing the back of his head against the brick wall, he opened his mouth in a silent scream, his fingers scraping desperately against the rough wall.
“Mmm, get over here and kiss me,” John urged as he entered the room and placed a bottle of red on the corner of the table.
“Good, then this is coming off,” John tugged at the leather band around Sherlock’s wrist.“Let me see it, love. I want this just to be the two of us. No dom/sub relationship, just us with what God gave us.”
“Can’t wait to hear you call yourself ‘Princess,’ Sherlock,” John smirked, then burst out laughing when Sherlock crossed his arms over his chest and wrinkled his face in disgust.
Sherlock laughed at John’s words then shook his head. “Generally, no. The act of obeying an order is calming for me, so far with you, it's just simply too new. My body does react differently depending on the implication, which I’m sure doesn’t surprise you.”
“Want to go to Lotus tonight?” John asked, pulling himself out of Sherlock’s arms and sitting up to stretch. “I think I owe you a dance.”
“Great, so you replaced drugs with sex?” John asked, wondering what Sherlock’s sexual history looked like on paper.
Thankfully for Sherlock, that seemed to satisfy John’s scruples. With a single exhale John relaxed and leaned in close. His lips sought out Sherlock’s and while the touch was soft, there was no hesitation or doubt in the way he kissed. Every movement was deliberate and well thought out. A dance whose sole purpose was to leave Sherlock gasping for breath as he writhed beneath John’s attention. While John’s mouth worked earnestly to suck all the oxygen out of Sherlock’s lungs, John’s right hand ghosted along the inside of Sherlock’s thighs. Each touch, each soft bite on the lip drew gasps and shivers from Sherlock’s body. It was only then, under John’s affections, that Sherlock realized how upset he’d been the night before. Flashes of feelings and words said to him came back to the forefront of his memory. But instead of taking seed and spreading route in his mind, John chased every trace of fear and discomfort from Sherlock’s body, replacing every negative feeling with genuine love.
The detective was suddenly very sombre examining the drink in his hand, Downing the entire drink he then said “Because sentiment is a defect found on the losing side”
Sherlock shrugged while he was preparing some beakers on the kitchen table. “What do you think will be the problem with that?” It was a bit cumbersome because he could only work with one hand, having to hold on to his sheet toga. “It’s not like she hasn’t seen worse. I only got a scolding for the holes in the wall, too. I’ll take the risk.”
It is the end. Merry Christmas to everyone who read this story. I hope you all got what you wished for and had a nice time with family/friends/your loved ones.
“Christmas decorations”, John hummed, actively trying to keep his cheer up although his best friend had awoken and would probably start to brutally murder it.
Yes, the Christmas Party had opened his eyes to what he’d really like to do with his flatmate. Still, he felt the thoughts just came a bit too naturally already. Especially since Sherlock was married to his work and this whole situation would only make matters worse. Until John had learned to neatly push everything down again, he probably shouldn’t ponder on these thoughts for too long. Presumably, Sherlock hadn’t gotten the social implications of what he had said. He probably really just had spotted something anatomical he had to voice.
the_elusive_plot has managed to write the end to this chapter which I procrastinated for so long that with Uni comming in full force I wouldn't have been able to do anymore :)
“Honestly Sherlock, I will find something and you will regret It.”, every word was meticulously enunciated, John’s arms crossed in front of his chest. Any lesser man would have gotten the hint straight away but Sherlock just sent him a calculating gaze.
He scrunched up his nose in distaste. “I will do no such thing but since it’s your time and money you are wasting, I can consent to keep the scientific facts from you.”
Mrs. Hudson had informed them that the city was cutting back on spending and that now they were responsible to keep the small piece of pavement in front of the house snow free. They had already struck a bargain with Speedy’s but obviously it had to snow the week they were on duty.
“You’ll get us out of any court case, should there come one” John called up but really he had enough, too. The majority of the pavement was snow free and he wanted to get back inside.
With the number of decorations that John had chosen it took three hours to finish decorating the flat. In the end it looked like Father Christmas could live here if he owned a flat in London. The flat shone with fairy lights across the window and there was fake snow dabbed along the windowsill. Wherever there had been an empty space, now held a Christmas decoration: on top of the fire place there was a nativity scene and John had even managed to keep the Santa hat on the skull, much to Sherlock’s annoyance. In silence the detective had already plotted the removal of that particular item when the doctor was in bed. All in all it was just a bit too much for him. Even Mrs. Hudson’s flat would have nothing on their sitting room. Sherlock’s head was already trying to figure out how to subtly dispose of some of the more tacky things over the course of the month.
John carefully lit the second candle on the advent wreath while in the background Sherlock mumbled something about John being a hypocrite about fire hazards in the flat popping another chocolate in his mouth. The doctor made his way to the kitchen opening the fridge to check if his homemade eggnog had cooled enough to drink and wasn't contaminated by any of Sherlock’s experiments.
That made the other turn back around into John’s direction. His eyebrows were drawn together as he tried to work out what made his friends so touchy about the situation. “Why is it so important to you that I take part in your celebrations? Wouldn’t it be easier if I left you to it?”
The decorations had been stored away neatly in their boxes until John had brought them upstairs. The first thing he had turned to was getting out his array of festive jumpers and the multi-coloured fairy lights. He liked to start with the fairy lights because they bathed the flat in a warm glow that made everything else feel a lot more comfortable. Knowing that Christmas music would alarm his flatmate of the proceedings too early, he had left it out for now, trying to gain as much of an advantage as possible. He was using the principle of
Sherlock ignored the other’s change in demeanour and waddled back into the kitchen, just calling over his shoulder, “I can’t guarantee for the safety of your
Sherlock wore a lopsided grin giggling as they finished discussion one of their earlier cases. There was a pause before John asked the younger man “Sherlock… Why don’t you like Christmas?”
and an unintelligible sound of annoyance. Still, he wasn’t sleepy enough to oversee the drastic change their flat had gone through since he had fallen asleep.
, had better not get near any of my experiments.” Sherlock stated, glaring down at the smaller man. He likes to make use of the difference in height because it was the only time he actually could win the upper hand over his friend.
"We still don't know with certainty that Lilianne is missing," Sherlock interjected softly. Though he and Greg shared a brief look of understanding. It was unlikely to simply cut off ties with friends, especially friends with which you shared a particular interest.
“Toad in the hole?” John gaped, eyes glinting with a mixture of mirth and delight. “I haven’t had that since I was a kid.”
“With this bracelet, I thee lock.” a delighted smile lit up John’s face as maneuvered the clasp closed, and with the key provided, locked it securely in place. “We’ll get a chain for this key, and I’ll keep it on me at all times. For tonight, I’ll leave it home, so it doesn’t get lost.”
“You are insufferably bossy, John Watson,” Sherlock grumped, though the smile on his face assured John that he was not at all bothered.
“John,” Sherlock tore his eyes from the ghastly faces and addressed his partner. “Take me upstairs. My mind is going around in circles. I can’t make out heads or tales anymore.”
Sherlock occupied his time waiting for Mycroft to leave by regarding his room with a critical eye. Items from his and John’s kit lay scattered across his room, his bed was a mess, and the musky scent of sex permeated the air. The day was surprisingly sunny, which allowed him to open his window a crack. Their heavy breakfast had made him feel sluggish, and the fresh breeze blew from outside invigorated Sherlock.
“Yeah, but how much does he know? Can he get us to Moriarty?” John asked as he settled in one of the wooden chairs at the table beside Sherlock.
“But I came with you last week, and I’m busy.” He harrumphed, crossing his arms, smearing pig saliva across his shirt front. He glared at John as if it were his fault he would now have to throw this shirt out, but John simply laughed.
“If I could, I’d have you on this table right now.” John leaned forward and gripped Sherlock’s chin between his thumb and index finger. “I’m so hard right now,” he growled just loud enough that only Sherlock would be able to hear, “Is that what you want? The whole room to see how wild my Sub makes me?”
“I understand that can’t always happen, especially if we’re out on a case. But feel free to summarize it as
John’s mouth fell open again as a steady stream of half coherent words sang through the air. He was moaning a mixture of Sherlock’s name and every word he could think of for amazing. It was a symphony to Sherlock’s ears, urging him on through the ache in his limbs. Time passed without any real meaning. It could have been hours or mere seconds since Sherlock had first pushed inside. He had no way of knowing, nor did he care.
"Mycroft was a bit miffed we didn't go with one of the family estates for our holiday," Sherlock laughed as they pulled up to their home for the next week. "Remind me to send him pictures; he’s going to hate it."
As they left the cozy internet cafe where they'd met the friends of Lilianne and Moon Young, John let out an excited exhalation of breath. Watching Sherlock out of the corner of his eyes, while trying to flag down a taxi during peak rush hour he said “They’d seen him, our Kraken tattoo guy! He was there the weekend before both Lilianne and Moon Young went missing.”
“I know he does.” John retorted confidently, making a show out of petting Sherlock’s hair. A low murmur came over the crowd when Sherlock went completely limp in his chair. “He’ll do anything to be pet, won't you?”
"Well you know how I feel about sampling the product so close to home," The Snake said, instilling a hint of a growl into his voice, "Now give me your money and scram. Your face is too well known to let you hang about."
The air crackled with a new sort of intimate tension that was both new and exciting. Sherlock licked his lips, eyes roaming over John’s body as if he couldn’t decide on where he wanted to start. This wasn’t his first time undressing his Dom, but it was the first time undressing
biscuits and mince pies,” John corrected with a grin as he crossed the short space between the fridge and where Sherlock sat. Wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders, he was careful not to disturb the equipment on the table while stealing a quick cuddle.
The sound of the device powering on filled the room as Sherlock tried to figure out how to kneel in his position. I wanted to voice his need, but he remembered the order to stay quiet. Figuring out the answer to a problem wasn’t considered an emergency. After a moment of trying to picture where his chair was, and if he could brace his elbow on the armrest for balance, John sniffed.
“Robert Sisk, fifty-five years old, Slovic of birth. Immigrated to England in the early ’80s. He’s been in and out of the British judicial system for a string of crimes, ranging from petty theft to kidnapping. Most recently, however, he’s been on the most wanted list in five countries.”
“It’s fine, dear. I know you were trying to be helpful. It’s your nature, after all. Breaching the gap between two strangers, very thoughtful of you.” Paige sighed, then tugged her skirt down, smoothing out the wrinkles with her palms. “I’m just on edge and feel as if I’m overreacting. I’ll admit my case is unique, and it has me a bit worried.”
“I kind of got the sense that he was sizing me up.” John mused, leaning his back on the counter and pursing his lips. “Used to get that feeling when meeting a new CO. Like they want to see what you’re made of. I
Sherlock furrowed his brows at John at the mention of a contract. A jolt of something shot through his body, pooling in his stomach. Nervousness, excitement, fear? He couldn’t tell. Sensing the tension in his friend, John waved a hand in the air between him, staving off any comment Sherlock was about to make.
“Oh god,” Sherlock breathed, slotting his feet between John’s, he pressed his hips firmly against John’s lower belly.
“What would you like, hmm? Would you like me to suck you off? Or do you want to feel my cock against yours, equally as exposed as yours?”
It was the first of December. Not an altogether remarkable date, except that it was the day John Watson always gave in to the festive season. The shops were carrying Christmas sweets and gingerbread since September but before the calendar didn’t show the last month of the year, the doctor wouldn’t start decorating. Now though, since the flat was fair game in his head, he wouldn’t be stopped.
Sherlock opened his mouth to protest but a practiced Captain Watson look silenced him and left him hurrying off to decorate. Without care and in an attempt to empty the box as quickly as possible, he just threw the decorations around. It left baubles hanging askew from the edges of books and little wooden stars littering the floor.
In one lightning quick move, John had Sherlock bent over his knee. Sherlock’s cock rubbed against the denim of John’s jeans, making him moan. He was sure he was slippery with precum. On any normal day, that would’ve been tremendously embarrassing but, that day, there seemed to be no barriers.
Sherlock gasped into John’s mouth. “Doctor, oh God, Doctor, please,” Sherlock moaned out as John’s cock pushed inside. He felt himself spreading to accommodate his boyfriend.
John glanced over at Sherlock. He was standing over his microscope replacing one of the slides. He looked up and caught John’s eye. Sherlock smirked and placed the slide on the table. He advanced towards John. John made no attempt to move; Sherlock guided him. Sherlock backed John up into the table. He bit his lip and pouted. “I don’t feel good, Doctor,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock followed his husband back into the bathroom and rested his head on John’s shoulder from behind. “Hamish?” John asked. Sherlock nodded. John mock pouted. “Sorry, Love. He’s a little kid. He’s excited,” he explained.
Lestrade was looking down at his notes as Sherlock and John shared their moment. John took this opportunity to do the thing that his head had been nagging him to do since he and Sherlock had sit down. His hand slipped from Sherlock’s and traveled over his thigh to his zipper.
Yes, Sherlock knew, it was unusual for divorce lawyers to travel somewhere other than their own cities. But this wasn't lawyer work.
“Lily’s here! Lily’s here!” Hamish exclaimed, running from window to window to more easily see his cousin.
“So much. So much. Just keep going,” He said. “Just please, keep going. Doing that,” He said as Sherlock pounded into him. “
John rolled his eyes lovingly and kissed Sherlock’s chin. He stood, carefully so as not to fall, and pulled his trousers up. He grabbed his bag and helped Sherlock up. He linked his fingers with Sherlock’s and locked the door behind him. He was ready to collapse into bed, either his or Sherlock’s.
Sherlock shot up and grabbed John’s wrist. “John, you can’t tell her he can’t come over now,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock leaned down and kissed John. He rolled his hips on John’s, feeling the man’s erection twitch underneath him.
Sherlock bit John’s lower lip. He loved the taste of John’s lips. They tasted so delicious. Sherlock could kiss and nibble them all day.
John sucked and tasted Sherlock’s precum. He glanced up at Sherlock, sucking again. Their eyes locked and John winked. Sherlock inhaled sharply. John sucked again, still staring at Sherlock. Their eye contact never broke as John licked at the bulbous head of Sherlock’s erection.
Sherlock screamed as he came. His orgasm splattered across his legs and covered the floor. He was oblivious to the fact that John came at the same time, filling his arse with a wet stickiness.
Sherlock gulped as John grabbed the lube. He heard it being squirted out and then the delicious squeak of John’s gloves as he rubbed the lube in his hands.
Sherlock took a heaving breath before looking down at John. He was kissing Sherlock’s chest and slowly making his way down to Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock urged him on by moving his body closer to John’s face. His erection stood in front of John’s face. John took the bait.
Sherlock moaned and his answer caught in his throat. “So fucking much, John. Oh, oh, yes, please John, yes, oh,
“Oh, yes. John, John. Oh, mmm,” Sherlock’s moans rang in John’s ears and he bent his head down. He sucked on Sherlock’s nipple and listened to his cries. “Ooh, YES! Yes, John. Oh!”
John didn’t squeeze or shift his hand. He just let Sherlock twitch in his grip. “Say my name,” John said.
John let his hand release Sherlock's sore testicle. "What? Don't make you cum here? In your pants? Right in front of Greg?" he asked, eyebrow arching as he spoke.
When Lestrade arrived, Sherlock was in his seat, waiting. "Good morning," he said, standing. Lestrade had to do a double-take, making sure that the man he was seeing was the same heart-broken detective he'd seen only days ago. "Well?" Sherlock said. "Are you going to just stand there or tell me what it is that happened?"
Sherlock smirked. He leaned down and kissed John’s ear. “I’m going to fuck you until the only thoughts you have are of me and my delicious cock,” He growled, thrusting again.
John smiled. "And don't think I'll never love you," he said. Sherlock nodded again. John's smile widened. "Goodnight, Sherlock," he said.
Sherlock hesitated to answer, which only made John angrier. He pinched Sherlock’s skin, right where his thigh met his arse. “Answer me!” he demanded.
he wrote. He glanced over at his boyfriend, whose cheeks had gone a strawberry pink from his yelp. He slowed down his strokes, not wanting to overstimulate Sherlock too quickly. He watched Sherlock bite back a moan. This gave John an idea.
Ah yes. The baby. The glue between John and Mary. The baby that Sherlock wished could've been with anyone other than John. His John.
John yanked Sherlock’s trousers down to his knees. He remembered Sherlock’s boots and pulled them off. Now, without any obstacles, John grabbed Sherlock’s trousers and pulled them off. He threw them behind him and slapped Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock yelped and John moaned. “God, I love you so much,” He said.
John crawled over to Sherlock’s drawers and rummaged around until he found a condom. He slipped it over his cock and adjusted it so that it felt comfortable. When he was sure it was on safely, he crawled back over to Sherlock and felt the tight ring of muscle. It was red and very compacted. John lubed up his fingers before slowly sticking one in.
When John’s chest was bare, Sherlock bent down. He started at John’s stomach. He licked up to his neck and bit his skin. He kissed John and nibbled on his lower lip.
John heard a click from outside his door. He looked over and saw his doorknob slowly twisting open. He sat up and prepared for whatever was approaching.
John looked down at his watch and nodded. “Indeed,” he said. He stood, as did the other men. They paraded into the kitchen.
John nodded. He looked over at Sherlock. Sherlock cleared his throat. “How long ago was that?” he asked.
John chuckled and kissed Sherlock’s neck. “Good boy. Now,” John said as he unzipped his trousers. “Dr. Watson is going to treat you until he sees that you are better.”
Sherlock kicked the football into the wall again. “This night is passing by impossibly slow,” He complained. “God, why must snow days be so boring?!”
Sherlock moaned as John spoke. He loved how John talked. He was so good at making Sherlock need him. And Sherlock knew that John wanted him as much as he wanted John.
The battle to undress each other continued as Sherlock unbuttoned John’s shirt and tossed it away and as John pulled Sherlock’s shirt over his head, buttons bursting.
John wrapped his hands around Sherlock’s neck as he continued kissing him. Sherlock pulled John right out of his seat and he had to stand on his toes in order to reach Sherlock’s lips. He rolled his hips into John’s and he moaned. The detective’s large erection made John’s own cock harden until he was bulging through his trousers. “Sherl...” His breath caught in his throat when Sherlock pushed him backwards into his desk.
The feel of John ramming into him made Sherlock’s head swirl. His cock ached and precut leaked from it. He moaned and searched for something to cling to. He ran a hand through John’s hair. He grabbed the back of John’s head and kept his grip as John pounded into him.
Sherlock gazed down at John. He yearned for John’s cock, for his lips, for his love. He stuck a single finger down John’s pants and felt his throbbing erection. He yanked John’s pants down and dropped them onto the blankets beside them. They were forgotten about as John’s erection stood and grazed Sherlock’s.
"You'll have to come see," Lestrade said with a grin. He used to grin at Sherlock like that. Sherlock quickly shook that thought away and grabbed his coat.
John smiled, finally taking dominance, when Sherlock grabbed his shoulders and flipped them around. His hands pinned John’s shoulders to the ground and a quiet moan escaped his lips as Sherlock ground his hips. Sherlock grinned and kissed John’s cheek. He ground against John again until the man thrusted up.
John nodded. Tim obviously had a good plan for his future. “What do your parents say about that?” he asked.
Sherlock, satisfied with his deductions, turned. John locked the door. The sound of the tumbling lock made a shiver run down Sherlock’s spine. John’s confident smirk didn’t help. As he turned, his dark eyes pierced Sherlock. He inhaled sharply as John set his hand on Sherlock’s chest. He shoved Sherlock backwards, not caring if his sudden weight messed up his neat sheets.
John licked the head of Sherlock’s erection. The detective shuddered. He moaned, making John’s erection twitch in pleasure.
John laid on his bed. Sherlock said he was going to conduct an experiment and said it was best if John just stayed in his room.
Sherlock blushed deeper. He was certain his face was a scarlet red. He smiled up at John, trying his best not to look foolish. John smiled back and took Sherlock in his arms. Sherlock nuzzled closer to him. He buried his face in John’s chest. “Are you going to sleep, Captain?” he asked.
nodded. “Oh yes. I will. You’ll be hurting for weeks,” He threatened, thrusting again. His thrusts were powerful and hard.
John listened to Sherlock’s moans and pleads but didn’t speed up at all. He slowly rolled his hips and Sherlock moaned. His hands clawed at the wall and his hips shuddered. John shifted inside him and sucked on Sherlock’s neck. “How much do you want me? Tell me, my dirty boy,” John growled.
He sat back in his chair and handed the papers to the two men. He gave each of them pens. "Sign your name at the top," he told them, and they followed.
,” He moaned. John ran his thumb over the head and trailed his finger back up Sherkock’s shaft. He ran his thumb over the head again and Sherlock groaned. “
Sherlock smirked and stepped away from John. He quickly unbuttoned his shirt and dropped it on the ground. He pulled his belt from his trousers and slipped out of them. He went to pull his trousers down when he looked up at John. He wasn’t sure if he was supposed to take his pants off as well.
She’d gotten Greg a silver ring with the bisexual flag on the underside, so he could wear it to work but still show his pride. The man had no pride wear whatsoever and Rosie had been determined to change that.
“No. John Watson,” scents of vanilla and a spice that reminded him of India tickled his nose. It was against the rules to proposition the staff, but flirting in moderation was tolerated.
John entered the bathroom a moment later with a towel wrapped around his hips. The terrycloth did very little to hide the soft bulge between his legs, and Sherlock found himself staring.
nicely." Sherlock purred, relishing the mixed look of curiosity and disgust on Lestrade’s face as he imagined what asking nicely entailed.
“Notice I said respect. I don’t expect you to be nice, but if we show her some respect, she might make your job a little easier.”
"Right, can we talk about something other than my cock now? Please?" John said around a sigh, causing Sherlock to smirk.
“Oh, hello, dear. Just bringing up the paper.”  Smiling, she held up a copy of The Guardian and placed it on the table. Her smile quickly turned into a cheeky grin as she took in John and the eggs for two in the pan. “That’s Sherlock’s dressing gown.” She said simply, tapping her finger thoughtfully against her lips.
“Full time, I see,” Zed said, eyeing the collar around Sherlock’s neck then looking over at John with a knowing smile. “Past training as well, judging by his collar.”
“That will be her,” Sherlock announced. “The sofa, then, Zed.” Gesturing towards the sofa, Sherlock stood and straightened his jacket. In a matter of seconds, he has the coffee table pulled aside, the space replaced with the two wooden chairs from the table. Moving as if running through a well-practiced dance, John and Sherlock work around each other, never once breaking pace until the frame of a small lady in her middle years graces their door.
I'm excited to share it in its entirety with you all, but sad to see my end of the journey come to a close. I have a feeling I'll return for more of these two, but if and when I do it'll because they have more story to tell. Currently, they just want to be alone to enjoy their sex holiday and would like me to butt out of their lives.
fast,” John admitted, thinking about how in a single week, he had moved out of his bedroom. Then there was the mind-boggling fact that he’d not only allowed but hadn’t cared that Sherlock had repurposed his old room into London’s most well-equipped sex dungeon. Certainly, Ella would have something to say about that. Something along the lines of moving too quickly without allowing himself space to heal. But he was happy, and Sherlock was happier than he’d ever seen him. “Things are good, and life with Sherlock is a bit more black and white. Like Yoda said, there is no try, only do.”
The taxi door creaked as John pushed it open. Warm evening air caressed his face, and nostalgia overwhelmed his senses. Echoes of mates laughing as they entered the club or the timid flirtation of a new acquaintance leaving with him made him smile.
“Right, you can leave the dirty talk to me,” John laughed as he motioned towards the side table, “condoms then. But, you’re still wearing clothes, hurry up and strip.”
Tearing his eyes from Sherlock, John looked over to his friend and gave him a brief smile of thanks, then reached for his wallet to pay for the drinks. Zed waved him off and clapped him on the shoulder, his good one John noticed with a sigh of relief, with enough force that the air escaped John’s lungs in a forceful “oomf.” With one last smile, he was off, bellowing for his lady to join him again.
“Watson, John… Here we are. Oh! It’s been a while.” Delight sang through her voice as she read over the computer screen. Not for the first time, John wondered what tidbits of information regarding his time in the club had been squirreled away inside his profile. Through speaking with the owner, he knew that they collected data on their guests. Home address, desired role, and their behaviour within the club.
“That’s hardly fair,” Sherlock countered while tilting his head at the woman. He followed her gaze to John and saw the look of sheer panic on his partner’s face. Turning to Lydia he said a bit more softly, “Females have an advantage when it comes to orgasms.”
"I owe John a round of drinks," Lestrade said with an amused shake of his head. "This is a far cry from fresh out of rehab Sherlock breaking onto my crime scenes."
“Never put one of these on, but I’ve watched a video,” he admitted, “the goal isn't to hurt you, so if I do please say something.”
Greg leads them out of the building the back way, into the car park. For the first time since Greg had found him half-dead, Sherlock climbed into the police car without a complaint. Greg could get to Chinatown faster than any cab, and arriving with an officer of the law would speed things up if they met resistance while attempting to access her flat.
Sherlock answered with a smoldering smile that set John’s inside abuzz with desire and delight. It quieted the final hints of doubt that this was all just an act. As if to prove his point further, Sherlock arched an eyebrow then looked down to his trousers where the leather was doing
“That’s what I said.” John teased back only to have Sherlock slip another finger inside. The stretch was exquisite. John moaned and rolled into the movement. All thoughts of continuing their playful banter flew out the window when not one but two fingers stroked his prostate.
“Yes,” Sherlock gasped, rocking forward on his knees. The pace quickened their joint efforts causing the bed to rock back and forth on its frame. The headboard bounced against the wall with a tell-tale thud with every movement. Mrs. Hudson and the neighbors would have no difficulty piecing together what was going on, should they hear the commotion. But he couldn’t find it in him to be bothered or embarrassed.
Shaking the memory from his thoughts, he inspected John’s face for any signs of disgust or reproach. Instead, all he found were the soft lines around his eyes and forehead as he listened. Eyes the color of the ocean at midnight grew soft as understanding set in. Then John smiled; it was small but carried more warmth in it than Sherlock knew what to do with. Not only had John heard him, but he understood and accepted Sherlock’s need for what it was.
“Starving. Let me just go change,” John requested apologetically as he let go of Sherlock and took a step back. As quick as his tired body allowed him, he headed up the second flight of stairs. While he’d slept in Sherlock’s room the last four nights, his clothing and personal effects were still upstairs. He dressed quickly, throwing on a pair of jeans and a casual t-shirt, then headed back to the kitchen, where Sherlock was in the process of placing a casserole dish on the table.
"Zero. My brother doesn't need to know how magnificent your prick is. That's one thing I'd rather like to keep to myself."
“Oh god, yeah. Yeah, I want to. Want to feel you throb against my tongue.” With a few more shallow thrusts, John’s grip tightened on Sherlock’s hips and he let out a strangled cry. Sherlock nearly came from the sound alone but managed to squeeze the base of his cock and hold off his orgasm. John barely gave himself time to recover, just a few half uttered swears and a broken laugh, before he was lifting Sherlock’s hips up and guiding him onto his back again.
“Oh please, continue to fight. Only gets me even harder,” the man said with a laugh as his grip tightened painfully.
“Put some damned socks on!” John hissed while reaching down and taking one of Sherlock’s cold feet into his warm hands.
“Oh, good boy. You didn’t get the handle covered in slobber.” He praised, giving Sherlock’s cheek a quick caress. Turning to the row of onlookers, John slid a hand from the nape of Sherlock’s neck down to his balls, then said, “Would anyone else like to touch? Thirty seconds each, get him good and hard for me.”
“Easy love, I promise we’ll get there,” John said between pressing soft kisses to the tip of Sherlock’s cock. “I promise.”
Sherlock nodded briskly and worked to match John’s breathing as his Dom secured his other wrist to the chair, then his biceps.
“You mean I’ve put on weight.” Sherlock scoffed, instinctively sucking in his stomach, reminiscent of Mycroft in his teenage years when he’d first started dieting.
He released Sherlock’s hair for a split second, delving his fingers deeper into luscious locks, then grabbed a more substantial handful. With a sharp twist of his wrist, he guided Sherlock’s face up, so their gaze met. Sherlock’s eyes were wide, his pupils dilated, and his mouth hung open in surprise, but it was the blush tinting his cheeks pink that set John’s heart racing. “To cover any basic loopholes you might come up with, this includes but is not limited to touching yourself in any way, shape, or form, on any part of your body, that could make you orgasm. Layman's terms, erogenous zones are off-limits unless I say otherwise. Is that understood?”
“You know, John? I think you might be right.” Sherlock lifted their hands up and brushed his lips against John’s knuckles. “Come on, let’s go home.”
“Tea?” John asked, nodding his head towards the kettle. “Should be warm still, and for God’s sake, stop scratching your arse. You don’t have fleas. There are enough germs littered about this flat. I don’t need to know
“Oh? So, if I were to kiss you right now, you wouldn’t become putty in my hands?” Wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s waist John looked up into Sherlock’s eyes then grimaced. “Yeah, can’t do it with them staring at me.” Wrinkling his nose at the pictures on the wall, John released Sherlock and jerked his head toward the stairs. They both bound for the stairs, Sherlock took them two at a time, as if sex were the only thing that would keep him from floating away.
"Hello, John." Mycroft waved to the driver to drive on, then got straight to business. "Has Sherlock told you what transpired while you were
“You heard him. If we want to put an end to this, I need to go. Alone.” Sherlock sighed as he nuzzled his face into the crook of John’s neck.
“Some bastard said something about you I didn’t like. I put him in his place. He insinuated you were a sissy, just because you’re fucking gorgeous.” John plopped down hard on the booth across from Sherlock and handed over Sherlock’s drink.
“Good,” John stepped forward and gave Sherlock’s jaw a brief caress. “Close your eyes, keep them closed until I tell you to open them.”
“I’ll have Mycroft collaborate with him,” Sherlock said, pulling his phone up to his ear. “With any luck, we’ll be able to cut off the head of this snake before too long.”
“Spoilsport.” Sherlock grumped, but under John’s steady gaze, he washed his hands before fixing himself a cup of tea.
Ripples of wet laughter bubbled out over the crowd. Most here today were familiar with her claim that she was in no way, shape or form the housekeeper for 221b. And most knew just how false that claim had been.
later. For now, strip.” John repeated as he rolled his hips, pressing his erection against Sherlock’s stomach.
“Oh, why haven’t I seen this before?” he asked, selecting a hanger and pulling it out. Holding it in front of his chest, with a soft cat-call, he wiggled a mesh shirt in the air.
targets alive, tonight’s mission is to retrieve Sherlock Holmes, as well as any of the other missing victims. At the very least we have Robert Sisk in custody, with time I’m sure we can pressure him into talking. Please take a moment to memorize these faces, but be aware that there may be others we don’t know about.”
“Such a good boy,” John praised around a moan when Sherlock’s mouth made contact with the tip of his cock. “If anyone else would like to come help him move his head…” John called to the crowd, “Same rules as before, thirty seconds or so. Keep your cocks to yourself please.”
"Yes, we all owe John a great debt of gratitude." Sherlock agreed softly, "He's out with a friend now, checking in with other club owners to see if they've noticed anything similar."
“When’s Otto coming back?” A voice shouted from the crowd, but Elvio gave him a scathing look, preventing anyone else from mentioning the man. No one who knew what had happened to Otto expected the man to return.
“Come on, John,” He added quietly, only half-listening to Lestrade, who was ordering them both to wait by the car while he checked out the flat. “I know what you’re thinking. Don’t beat yourself up.”
Sherlock clambered onto the bed and rolled onto his stomach. He watched John as he rounded the bed, heading for the bathroom door. He was pleased that they were staying indoors today. He wasn’t ready to face the world just yet, and it had nothing to do with the scarlet rope around his neck. His mind had been blessedly quiet since spotting John at Lotus the previous evening, and he wasn’t quite ready to welcome the chaos that greeted him every time he stepped outside.
John looked up just as someone knocked on the hall door. Cursing under his breath, he tossed the notepad onto the coffee table and asked, “How long has he been standing there?” wondering how much Sherlock’s brother had overheard.
“Though… this whole lifestyle is interesting. I might have questions, when all this is over. You all are at such ease with your sexuality. I can’t help but wonder if I’ve been too sheltered my whole life.”
John managed to get a cup of tea into Sherlock, which they both drank in bed. The room was quiet, save for the soft slurping noises as they drank the still too hot liquid. After a few moments of silence, during which John forced himself
“Mm, like the wind,” John said, rolling his eyes when Sherlock didn’t catch on to the apparent reference to the 1939 romance movie.
Placing the condom wrapper back in his pocket John pulled out a small satchel of lube and tore it open with his teeth. Coating himself liberally, he reached out with his slicked up fingers and pressed his index finger inside Sherlock.
“Of course, Sir.” She murmured then slid to her knees when John released her wrists. She got as far as reaching for one of the zippers on John’s trousers when Sherlock let out a broken whine.
“Out cold,” John announced as he bent down and withdrew a pair of handcuffs. Once he had the man’s hands secured behind his back, and he’s certain they're safe, John glanced over at Sherlock. “Be with you in a moment, love.” He promised, then began searching the man’s pockets.
“No, that’s normal,” John nodded in agreement. Giving orders and watching them being followed out had never been erotic in his past. But then, he hadn’t been watching Sherlock Holmes displaying the different submissive positions while wearing only his birthday suit.
“John,” Sherlock began his face suddenly unreadable as the smile that had been flickering over his face faded. Brushing the crumbs from his chin, he looked over at John, “I have a question.”
“Let’s order out, and while we wait, I’ll show you what’s in here.” John ruffled Sherlock’s hair as he walked past him, graciously not laughing when the laptop’s lid snapped shut and pushed aside as Sherlock practically leaped out of his chair.
She handed over two white flowers made of silk and two safety pins. They stepped out of the way, allowing her to help the people in line behind them. John’s nose twitch as he held up the pin, eyeing Sherlock’s shirt doubtfully,
“Right,” he said a few minutes later, carrying their food on a tray, “hope you’ll eat this. I made eg- oh. Oh…” John nearly lost his grip on the tray. Dressed only in a pair of purple boxers, Sherlock knelt on the floor beside the bed. His hands were held out, palms up. He was holding out the red collar and the lock. When John entered, he bowed his head, staring at a spot just beyond his knees. He was, at that moment, the perfect image of a submissive.
“Unsurprising,” Sherlock sighed, “The average mind needs to hear a name six times before it can remember it with ease. Plus, serving hundreds of people in a single night, remembering one name would be impressive. Can her ID be seen on CCTV footage?”
When the cuffs were in place, John tested the tightness by sticking his pinky finger under the cuff. Satisfied that they were not tight enough to cut off circulation, nor lose enough that Sherlock could wiggle free of them, he let go of Sherlock’s hands. “Palms up,” he commanded, not bothering to wait and see if his order would be obeyed.
“No, Captain, that would be rude. One should never roll their eyes at their Captain, especially when he’s expressing concern for his submissive’s well-being.” Lydia said while pushing into John’s hips. “I could help you with that, Sir.” She said while casting a wink over to Sherlock Just as John’s cock slotted itself between her cheeks.
“Lift your head,” he said gently. When Sherlock did as he was asked, John sat where his head had been, then delicately guided Sherlock to rest his head on his lap. Once Sherlock was comfortable, John began stroking his finger down the bridge of Sherlock’s nose, while his other hand gently worked through messy curls. Sherlock instantly relaxed under his care. No longer coiled, as if ready for a fight, Sherlock melted into the cushions and uttered a slow sigh.
I have a fandom twitter now, that I'm sort of obsessed with. Come hang out with me (and watch me fret about future chapters)
Sherlock looked down at the slick wet patches that were causing the mesh to stick to his stomach and grinned. “Let’s hope Mrs. Hudson is asleep, or this will be fun to explain.”
“Why not enjoy it while you have the chance to indulge, Sir.” Sherlock watched John as his captain struggled to find a good reason not to give in to his carnal desire. His hands itched to stroke himself. To soothe the ache pulsing through his groin. He stilled the twitch with a will of denial, looking up at John through his lashes, he had one more trick up his sleeve that was almost certain to give him the upper hand. “I swallow.”
Free of his collar and his pyjamas Sherlock stretched out on the bed and looked up expectantly at John. He was just about to pull his knees up, to give John access when his partner surprised him by settling on his side next to him on the bed.
Feel free to follow me on twitter for more information on future stuff. Or if you have discord you can use that as well.
“He just warned me that Moriarty might try something, that you might try to push yourself away from me.” John chose his words carefully, knowing that Sherlock would be able to see through a straight lie. Plus, it wasn’t often he got to play
“Yes, I would have, though admittedly not as thoroughly as I plan on with you.” Running his fingers along the neck of his bottle, John chewed on his lip for a moment before adding, “It makes for a more enjoyable experience if you’re open about things beforehand. Sex is… intimate, bondage more so. One person might like light choking, while for another, it could cause a panic attack. One wrong move and the fun is over, and everyone goes their separate ways, embarrassed. You and I,” he waggled a finger between them, “we live together. We don’t have the luxury of going home embarrassed and never seeing each other again. Also, nineteen? Christ!”
Elvio was a short man with tawny skin and dark hair. He reminded John of Antonio Banderas in his earlier years, though Elvio sported a thick, though neatly trimmed, beard. His accent was thick, indicating he hadn’t been in England long. Meanwhile, his husband, Matt, was as Scottish as the Scottish came. With flaming red hair and flashing eyes that hinted at a hidden temper.
“Mm… Human trafficking fits the highest probability. But I encourage you not to let that cloud your judgment.”
“You may ask for help as well. I hadn’t considered that.” John said, amending the no speaking rule. “If your knees need a break, you may sit or lay face-up on the floor.”
“Fine, another finger.” Sherlock panted while trying to control his desire to bear down harder on John’s fist.
"Freeing," Sherlock said instantly. "My whole life I've struggled to quiet my mind… hence the overdosed state you first found me in. When I give control over to John, it allows me to shut down my mind without worrying about my safety. I know, whatever happens, he has my back."
“Not at all. I can get in and out faster if I don’t have to stop you from causing an argument every ten seconds.” Smiling fondly at his partner John stroked his index finger down the length of Sherlock’s nose then stole a final kiss. “Right,” he muttered, resigning himself to his errand before Sherlock’s soft sigh broke his resolve.
Pocketing his phone, he turned back to the kitchen to put the finishing touches on supper. He’d stolen a pinny from Mrs. Hudson earlier that day, and it now lay draped over one of the chairs coated in flour and egg.
“She was the best Nana our little girl could have ever had. She was a spitfire who didn’t let Frank’s
“Like I want another hit,” Sherlock admitted as he rested his chin on his knees and cradled his mug of tea. “That’s the problem with cocaine. Its effects are short-lived. I never meant to become addicted to it, I just wanted the freedom it gave me.”
The memory of John’s hand wrapped around him sent a wave of goose pimples over his arms. In one night, John had made him feel more than any partner had. Clever fingers had worked out where he was the most sensitive and had exploited those nerve endings, milking out every last drop of pleasure.
“Point taken.” Sherlock grumbled, nodding his head in understanding, “help me search for the charger?”
Use your imagination, or google, for their upstairs room now (Which also needs a name, if anyone has a fancy name for it) Some of the stuff I made up (like the weird sex arbor) but you can find a ton of images of whipping benches on google.
“Christ,” John muttered, his face turning bright red. After they saw Mycroft out, John shut the living room door and turned to Sherlock. “Well, what now then? Pack for our trip?”
“What happened, what did he say, and more importantly, how did you get rid of him,” Sherlock asked, his eyes darting over John’s face, searching for any clues.
“White, please,” John flashed her his teeth, then stroked a hand down Sherlock’s back, letting his fingers dip just below his waistline.
"John," Sherlock said in a whisper while coaxing John's chin up with two of his fingers, "I will only appear vulnerable. I'll have you watching me like a hawk every second."
“John can catch up; please begin,” Sherlock demanded, which earned him looks of astonishment from the two doms seated in front of him. Rolling his eyes Sherlock grips the chain in front of his collar and sighs.“John and I have an agreement. This does not rule over The Work. He might be my dom at home and in bed, but this is my area. I am allowed full authority as long as I remain respectful to my clients or those I’m working with.”
When Zed did one of his demonstrations, he preferred being close to his guests, so he did his performances on the floor rather than the stage. He’d once claimed it gave everything a more personal touch, rather than putting on a show for pure sport. He’d designed the club not to be a sleazy sex club, but to be an educational hotspot where people could come and learn. Sex wasn’t allowed on-premise, nor was exposing one’s body tolerated. Clothing had to cover the bits at least, and anything beyond showing off your skills was expected to be taken elsewhere. John had used the motel just down the street on more than one occasion after an evening here turned fruitful.
than an actual bodysuit. Straps attached the upper portion to the matching stockings, leaving Sherlock’s arse and groin bare save for the short skirt Sherlock had on. On his feet he wore knee-high leather boots with a small heel. The boots, John noticed, came up just high enough to hide the large cut on Sherlock’s leg.
"Too deep, felt like I was being split open. I liked it hard and fast. It just hurt when he went too far in."
Excitement coursed through Sherlock’s body, though he didn’t let it show. He lifted his head lazily and regarded John as if he hadn’t heard a single word. He saw the moment John decided what his punishment would be. John’s eyes hardened, and a dangerous smile toyed at the edges of his mouth.
“My arse is quite edible, thank you very much.” Sherlock retorted as he headed for the door, dragging John with him by the chain.
a person,” John whispered, pulling Sherlock tight against his chest by wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s back. “My person, to care for and love. And I swear I’ll take care of you for the rest of our lives. You’re not alone anymore.”
“Right,” John nodded, reaching out and releasing the buckle on Sherlock’s cuff. “Why don’t we take a break, drinks, loo, rest, etcetera,” he suggested while he finished removing the restraints from Sherlock’s body.
“You just want to see me get so fat I can’t run off and leave you behind,” Sherlock complained, even as he tore the package open and shoved a biscuit into his mouth.
“Oh fuck,” John said around a shudder, making Sherlock chuckle. John tried to pull away, but Sherlock held tight, lowering his mouth he sucked John’s thumb into his mouth.
“Already posted, Sherlock.” John laughed, pleased that they’d been able to slip back into their usual banter. “Make the tea; I need the loo.”
“Right.” Greg intoned as he followed after John. Together they kick in their first door. Scared brown eyes look up at them as they step inside and a young girl with dark hair scurries into the corner of her room, dragging a blanket up over her chest to hide her near nakedness.
