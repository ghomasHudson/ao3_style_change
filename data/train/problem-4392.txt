Settling onto his bed, he paused for a moment before hitting the play button. This wasn’t the first time he had found porn actors who looked like Cas, but it always caused a little bubble of unease to form in his throat regardless. Watching strangers going at it was one thing, but watching strangers that looked like people he cared about? That was a whole other kettle of fish.
“You need some painkillers,” he decided aloud, and watched as Castiel tried to hide the flicker of relief that washed across his face. “Hold tight.”
powerful magic, but he didn’t know enough about how any of it worked to be able to piece the clues together.
The cashier had her hand on Cas’s bicep. Dean couldn’t make out what they were talking about – could only see that whatever Cas had just said had made the girl throw her head back in laughter. He watched, a little dumbfounded, as Cas’s eyes drifted to the long line of her neck – not unlike how Dean himself might have checked a hot girl out – and when he smiled back at her it was with a heat Dean was still completely unused to seeing on his face.
. Stuffy, in an endlessly endearing way, and a little preachy when he really got on a roll, but not…
Dean couldn’t help the bitter huff of laughter that left his throat, and had to look away for a moment. “Nobody wants that job, pal – trust me.”
into Shirley’s mouth. She made a noise of surprise, followed by a choking cough, and then swallowed a couple of times.
“Thank God no-one was out here when it fell,” Paxton sighed, coming up behind him. “Would have been more than four bodies to contend with if there had been. Lucky enough that nothing has set on fire yet.”
Castiel nodded, body wracked with fine trembles, and Dean couldn’t decide if they were from cold or shock. He didn’t ask, instead went back to his task of gently, methodically cleaning his friend up.
Plastering a grin on his face, he reached over and wound the passenger window down as Cas approached. “Carpool for Miss Daisy?”
, I know that – but it’s all striking in the same area. Grass is scorched, trees are coming down… it’s almost like the storms are homing in on something.”
“You’re okay,” Dean cut him off, cupping Cas’s head to his chest with a gentle hand. “We’ll figure it out, okay? But we have to get out of here, Cas, before –“
Dean nodded again, already moving in the direction Paxton was pointing. Just as she had said, a little further up the path he found more trees with similar scorch marks to the one that had fallen, and a little further still he came across an outcrop of huge rocks half-buried amongst the trees. He could hear Paxton shuffling around behind him, but paid her no mind as he approached the rocks. Here, too, there were obvious signs that lightning had struck, and he ran his hand over the surface of the nearest stone, turned black from damage.
Dean had loved him so much, in that moment, for offering him an out without making it a big deal. He’d loved him so much that it gave him the strength to shake his head, to plaster a smile on his face as he’d scooped his backpack up out of the footwell.
an errant spring. Something hot that he refused to name had rumbled low in his gut at that realisation, but he hadn’t said anything as Cas had quickly excused himself to the bathroom to “freshen up”. He’d been twenty minutes – Dean wasn’t quite stupid enough not to recognise what he was probably doing in there. The poor bathroom had seen more action in less than twelve hours than Dean had in six months.
before it was all gone. Victims usually looked anaemic, sure, and usually more than a little torn apart, but not
“But we don’t know how some of the magical ingredients will react to fire,” Cas finished for him, and Dean nodded.
“I know, I know,” Dean nodded, very ready to be done with this conversation. “Just gotta learn to share my toys, huh?”
“No, it’s…” Dean found himself saying rather quickly. “I’m as open-minded as the next guy, sweetheart. Whatever gets you going.”
The creature’s face soured, but even burning with a vicious fury, he was still impossibly, unfairly beautiful.
Cas was his friend – his absolute best friend in the entire world – and he was struggling with his own shit. Dean knew he could be a selfish bastard, but even
“Not to worry,” Dean replied, and pulled his phone out of his pocket. “This is exactly why the FBI is dispatched – we can get a fresh perspective. My colleague is at the mortuary right now; I’ll give him a call, see if we can’t run any tests that would determine whether or not the bodies were ever fully submerged.”
It wasn’t any lewder than the other videos he’d scrolled past. If anything, the angle – blown wide and to the side – made it less so. Peering closer, Dean squinted to take in every aspect of the photo. The Bottom was tanned, as they usually were, with sun-kissed hair and dark eyes. His hands gripped the bed sheets tightly, head thrown back in obvious pleasure while the Top’s face was obscured, buried between ample cheeks. From the side, it kind of looked like – but no, that wasn’t possible.
“I can’t say it’s something that has ever crossed my mind,” Cas replied with just the hint of a smile. “But good to know.”
and realised he was chuckling hysterically as he pulled his soiled shirt over his head and got up to find a clean one.
“Cas, down!” he found himself yelling, pausing only until he heard him roll off the bed and onto the floor before lunging for his lighter once again.
She’d had a lot of natural ingredients, he remembered – plants and animal parts. Maybe the eggs he’d found were an extension of that? It had to be connected somehow, but he just couldn’t see it. Why were the eggs in a separate location, along with the bodies? How did the lightning storms fit in, if at all? None of the witnesses had mentioned cold spots, or ghost sightings, so were they even dealing with a spirit? There were still entirely too many loose ends, and Dean didn’t like it one bit.
He told himself he wasn’t showing off when he tucked the cue behind his back and knocked the white ball into another striped one without looking. He didn’t pot anything else, but if Cas looked impressed regardless, that was really on him. It certainly didn’t make Dean’s gut curl, hot and tight.
He would hate doing it – and he could see from his expression that Cas wasn’t thrilled by the idea, either – but while he didn’t exactly trust Rowena, she sure had her uses, and recognising magical shit was definitely up there at the top. If they could figure out how powerful Gloria Brown had been, or what sort of shit she had been getting herself into, maybe they could link some more of the clues together and finally start figuring this whole mess out.
Dean was searching for more injuries before he could even finish his sentence. The rest of Castiel’s front seemed fine, mostly, if for a couple of bruises under his left pectoral that had to ache; it was when Dean reached out and carefully tugged until Castiel fell into his arms that he realised there were deep puncture holes in his back.
He’d have to talk to Cas about it, see if he had any insight. And while he was thinking about it, there was still the matter of Cas to deal with, too. He wasn’t sure that a single conversation had changed whatever was going on in the guy’s head, but it was a start. At least Dean understood the drive a little more, if not the reason. Though, he supposed, it was pretty easy to confuse one feeling for another, especially when sex was involved – especially when you were new to feeling anything
His torso was a mess. Something long and sharp had sliced deep into his side, the wound at least eight inches long and a couple inches deep – deeper towards the middle. Blood oozed sluggishly from it, staining his pale skin a sickly red.
Within the week, they both had new backpacks, books, and a pencil case that Bobby had let them pick out themselves, filled to the brim with all kinds of stationary – some of which Dean was sure he’d never even
The first thing he noticed was the bloody handprint, perfectly formed against the aged wooden surface. Dean knew that handprint, he realised with a sickening jolt, because the same one had been seared onto his arm as he’d been pulled from hell. He’d know Cas’s handprint anywhere, and seeing it in blood made his chest constrict painfully. Had he been pressing his hand to a wound? It appeared, from the scuff marks on the floor, like the table had been disturbed; had Cas been pushed against the surface? Had he had to throw his hands out to catch himself?
. He had been sure he’d used the last of it on Sam a few years back after a particularly nasty spirit had thrown him through a window, but apparently not.
But Lilah, who he would come to realise was smarter than anyone gave her credit for, had just nodded her head thoughtfully and hummed. “You better come to the bleachers at lunch so I can introduce you to everyone, then.”
thinking about the fact that Cas was making hook-up house calls now. Dean hadn’t exactly kept track of Cas’s comings and goings, just sped through their security footage in search of unfamiliar faces. Had he completely missed the fact that Cas had been leaving the bunker and not arriving back until morning? Had he been doing that while he’d also been bringing people back home, or was it a new thing?
Only, that also turned out to be a mistake, because watching the way Cas’s ass appeared from under his trench coat as he bent over the table, pants pulled tight against his thick thighs, did absolutely nothing to help the quickly growing situation in Dean’s pants. Sure, he was still coming to terms with his feelings, but he wasn’t
,” Dean choked, and had to cover his face with his hands lest his eyes bug right out of his head. Just the
Small town sheriffs were never prepared for stuff like this, Dean thought to himself. The most exciting thing any of them ever dealt with was road collisions, or kids shoplifting – it wasn’t particularly surprising that none of them seemed to know what the hell they were dealing with. Hell,
He was inches from it, scrabbling against the wooden floor, when the next wave of energy hit him and he went sprawling backwards, crying out in pain as he landed heavily on top of the flamethrower. He couldn’t stop, though – couldn’t pause for breath – because he could see the creature begin to beat its wings, begin to move forwards towards where Cas was trying desperately to drag himself under the bed to safety. Terror, tight and hot, gripped Dean’s throat.
“Fine,” Dean snapped, and then rubbed a hand over his eyes when the kid physically jumped. “Sorry. I guess we’ll take a king.”
Cas, thankfully, followed, but he was still frowning by the time they were back on the road. He had the extraordinary ability of being able to turn a frown into a living, breathing thing, and within ten minutes of setting off it felt like something dark and heavy was crawling down Dean’s throat.
him. Just being near him was enough to balm whatever ailed Dean, and he felt stupid, sick, that it had taken him so long to understand why. Why the thought of Cas falling into the arms of another made Dean want to kill something. Why Cas forming friendships,
Time for another finger. Dean didn’t know when his body had decided one wasn’t enough, but there was barely any resistance when he added another. The fact he was now furiously pumping his dick in time with his thrusting appendage might had eased the way; he found he didn’t really care, because when he went back with the second finger in tow, he grazed something inside that shot surprising, electric heat from his head right down to the tips of his toes.
“Well,” Sam started, having apparently found the page he was rifling for. “Get this: after we last spoke, I started going through some of the catalogues in the basement – you know, the really old stuff. I thought, with the weather manipulation, maybe you were dealing with an old god, or something like that.”
“One of the farmers had a scythe,” Castiel admitted, and with each word more blood oozed from his body. “And when the deity threw me, I think I landed on a rake.”
“That’s bad, is what it is,” Dean finished for him. His heart was pounding in his chest, and it had nothing to do with Cas anymore.
– as he’d stared into the furious eyes of his father, and he still believed that was true; he was attracted to women, and he always would be. But when he really thought about it – when he allowed himself to think back to just how much his heart had fluttered when Drew’s mouth had been on his, and now, how Cas’s smile made him weak in the knees – he realised he couldn’t really deny it any longer.
, the phone informs Dean, and he opens the alert on auto-pilot before he remembers just what, exactly, he had set a timer for.
Castiel inclines his head, regal as any king, and then stands up. He closes his eyes briefly, and Dean catches the faintest glow of power before Castiel reopens them and is suddenly fully dressed again, suit and tie and trench coat. His wings spread wide and arc high, as if in preparation for flight, and Dean grins because, hey, looks like it only takes an angel one day to learn what Dean likes best in the morning.
Castiel’s wings shiver, a little movement that starts at the center of Castiel’s back and ripples outward towards the ends, sending a cascade of purple and green lights flashing across the room. It’s only when the movement reaches the end and the wingtips flick that Dean realizes Castiel is actually slightly amused, like he wanted to laugh but didn’t know how to manipulate shoulders and so used his wings to approximate how a human would.
“Oh, apparently there was some demon posse following you. Cas flew off to, uh, interrogate one. He killed the rest. He might also request someone from his garrison to shadow you and Jess. For a couple days, anyways, til we figure this all out.”
Luckily, Castiel doesn’t seem to notice. He walks over to the briefcase on the desk, presses a few buttons, and it snaps open. He immediately starts rifling through, so completely focused it’s like he’s forgotten Dean’s in the room.
It stings a little, that Castiel would get bored of him within only like two hours, but Dean takes a deep breath and pushes away the hurt. He isn’t surprised, after all. Castiel really should have left the second Dean came back to the hotel. Or hell, even the second he got a good look at Dean’s soul. At least he did the courtesy of saving Dean a long trek back to the hotel.
Castiel frowns and smooths a hand down his trench coat. He seems genuinely hurt by the question, which is bizarre. “I like my coat. And the Bureau has a dress code.”
They stop for the night at a motel. Dean orders a double room by habit and regret swims up in his chest, regret that is half Sam and half John, but then Castiel brushes his elbow and the regret fades away, because hey, at least Castiel can get some sleep.
“If anything, my wings are the strongest part of me,” Castiel tells him. “This vessel you see, it is a human form that I have placed myself in, but my wings are part of my true form. The only part I can let loose upon this plane in their actual shape, in fact. Unless you have angelic or demonic strength that I do not know about or have strengthened yourself with very powerful magic, you cannot hurt me.”
. The pipe warps and the demon barely flinches, but it’s certainly enough to make the demon turn on Dean, frothing at the mouth with rage.
He finds his brother and his soulmate in the next motel room, the interconnecting door swung open to allow passage; Sam must’ve switched their room reservations to get one that connects with Castiel’s. Sam is sprawled on the bed, grinning with a half-eaten salad in front of him, and Castiel is perched neatly at the desk, a mostly devoured burger still in the foil clutched in his hands. The atmosphere is relaxed and cozy, and Dean soaks it in, feeling lighter than air, buoyed at the idea of the two parts of his family getting along.
“Are you worried about Sam? We would recruit him as well, and offer him tuition assistance if he wishes to complete his degree.”
“It was a successful endeavor,” Castiel replies. His formal wording is completely at odds with his soft affectionate tone, but Dean is responsible for most of Castiel’s softening, so he usually just grins and enjoys it. “There were three demons watching the apartment and five more around the town. I exorcised some, killed the ones whose vessels were too far gone. I also captured one to interrogate; she’s bound in a devil’s trap.”
“The white ball,” he continued, rounding the table to place said ball in position, “starts here. You only ever hit this ball with the cue, got it?”
He quickly ran through what he and Cas had found since they’d last talked, from the victim connections to the house itself. Sam hummed through it all, and Dean could hear him flicking through some kind of book on the other end of the line.
Dean hadn’t really known what to do with that, could think of nothing but the fact that Drew radiated a heat that made him feel warmer than any of the alcohol had. He’d shifted, just slightly, so their bodies were better aligned, and decidedly
Dean didn’t need to be told twice. He quickly snapped a few pictures on his phone as evidence, and then followed Cas back up the stairs. He found he could breathe easier as he ducked back out into the hall, and took a moment while Cas replaced the door and used his grace to repair the seals to let his mind race.
When Dean thought about Cas, his chest ached. He missed him like a limb, like he was an extension of himself, of Sam, of their little family, and when they were together the grand vastness that was life never felt quite as daunting. Cas was like the sun in that respect, drawing Dean into his orbit and anchoring him within reality. Of course, he was also the single most infuriating being Dean had ever encountered in his life, but even that seemed to somehow fade into the background under the warming beams of Castiel’s light.
“I’m not going to apologise for wanting you to go back to being friends again,” Sam cut him off firmly, and Dean sighed.
“Kinda?” Sam replied, the distaste in his voice clear. “They have the ability to shapeshift into, and I quote,
,” he choked, breath leaving him in a desperately relieved huff as he immediately spotted an all too familiar lump amongst the covers of the bed. “Cas!”
“Well,” Paxton hummed. “Maybe? There aren’t tonnes of bears around here, but we’ve had a few sightings. Judging by the size, it’s more likely you’re gonna find a pissed off mama raccoon and a bunch of hungry babies attempting to hibernate.”
But, of course, Sam couldn’t hear him, either. With a frustrated sigh, Dean tried the door handle – locked, naturally. Not really sure what else to do, he pulled his phone out of his pocket and speed-dialled Cas. It rang for just a little too long, but eventually connected.
The table was electronic, and only released the balls once Dean had fished around in his pocket and stuffed a couple of quarters into a slot on the side. Cas watched him quietly, cue held by his side, with an indulgent smile on his face.
needs locking?” Dean muttered, reaching out to examine the symbol further. His hand came away red, and a quick sniff confirmed the bubble of unease that had settled in his chest – it was blood.
While the Bottom fiddled with the zoom lens, blocking where the Top lay on the bed behind him, Dean looked away and shifted his hands to his fly. It was easy enough to tug his pants down to his thighs, briefs following suit after catching momentarily on his erection. He allowed himself a couple of slow strokes as he shifted on the bed, propping himself up so his laptop could sit comfortably on his knees. The drag of his hand was a little much, sending gritty sparks up his spine, so he spat into his palm before returning it to his throbbing cock.
“Sure, I just missed you,” Sam snarked, and then paused. “And the, um… Garth didn’t need my help, after all.”
, obviously,” he stuttered with a nervous laugh. “And you’re not a toy! You’re your own person and you can do what you want – I get it –“
He couldn’t help but think, as concrete fell away and he dropped into the brush beyond, that he was walking directly into a trap. It was actually the only thing stopping him from breaking into an immediate sprint; instead, he forced himself to take even strides, forced his breath to match them, and set his gaze on the slowly approaching house.
But his feelings didn’t matter, because Cas deserved someone better – someone beautiful, like him. It hurt – God, it hurt like hell – but Dean could let him go if it meant he was happy. Cas deserved to be happy.
“Well,” Bobby shrugged, calm as a cucumber. “We can always try again tomorrow. Not like I couldn’t use the help in the ‘shop.”
Once they were on more stable ground, Paxton strode ahead and pulled back a particularly dense thicket with careful hands. “The worst of it is just through here.”
Dean’s hole twitched, and he had to stifle a surprised gasp in the crook of his elbow, lest he alert Castiel to what he was doing. His hand quickened, wondering what it would feel like to have a tongue –
“Yes!” he grinned, and dared a glance at Cas. He, too, was smiling. “See, I potted a striped ball first, which means I have to pot all the striped ones now. That means you’re spots. If I accidentally hit a spotted ball, or you hit a striped one, your opponent gets an extra shot.”
They fell back into an easy rhythm, Dean forcing their almost-kiss and not-quite-moment to the back of his mind with all the other traitorous thoughts, and he found himself relaxing again. He liked spending time with Cas – there had to be a reason why his feelings had developed, after all. Cas had a quiet solidity that was grounding like little else in Dean’s life was. He was funny, despite what the other angels often said about him, and intelligent in a completely different way to Sam. He was easy to get along with, rolling with the punches of their crazy lives almost as easy as breathing –
He threw the blade, as hard and as fast as his shaking hand would allow him, and held his breath as, with a slick, sickening sound, it buried itself deep in the creature’s side. Everything slowed for a moment, as though all the energy in the room had coalesced on that single point of contact between flesh and blade, before the creature slowly turned its head to look.
Dean’s brain was still only working with backup power, it seemed, because all he could focus on was how
Only as he said it did Dean glance away from his face and begin to realise just how much trouble they were in. He had seen the blood, of course, but he hadn’t really
It looked like the poor woman had melted right into the riverbank. Her skin sagged around bowing bones, completely void of colour, and she seemed impossibly old, though her stylish, dirtied clothes said otherwise. There were, oddly, no immediate signs of distress – no bite marks, or even bruises – but, as Dean took a tentative step closer, it became more and more apparent that the woman had died of unnatural causes. He could practically
A startled snort of laughter left Dean’s mouth, followed by another, and he had to take a second to cackle hysterically into his hand. God, he was so,
was obviously a local favourite; there was no way such a dive could have survived without being. Dean left Cas at the bar to place their order, grimacing at how his shoes stuck to the floor when he moved, and quickly found them a booth by the window. He’d always judged the quality of a bar by the seating – probably stupidly, he was aware – and as he sat down, he couldn’t help but frown.
Cas drew the laptop towards him, and clumsily snapped four separate articles into place side by side. The copies varied widely in condition, but even Dean could make out that they were at least different issues of the same local newspaper.
It was great, actually; now he had a whole new catalogue of jerk-off material, and as long as he didn’t come, it didn’t mean anything had even changed. It wasn’t like he was watching the guys, after all – just things going in holes. Sometimes he didn’t watch it at all, just closed his eyes and listened to the wet, lewd noises echoing around his room. It was sex he was attracted to, he decided, not guys.
“Sam’s found a case?” Cas prompted, once it became apparent Dean no longer had the capacity to speak. “Do you need my assistance?”
Cas hummed, bobbing his head in a nod of understanding, while his eyes flicked back to his phone as it pinged with another message. Dean, sensing what was about to happen, leaned over and covered the phone with his hand before Cas could reach for it.
“Don’t touch anything,” he warned when it looked like Cas was going to reach out for an open book. “We don’t know what kind of bad juju is hanging around in here.”
“Dean?” a small whimper rose from Cas’s mouth, and then too-blue eyes were gazing up at him. They seemed hazy for a moment, as though Cas wasn’t quite there, before clearing into their usual, gorgeous shade.
“Huh?” the kid replied, and then spotted the leaflet. “Oh, yeah. I got a friend whose mom works at the morgue – apparently there wasn’t much left of the bodies.”
“Like it’s giving you constant static shocks,” Dean added. “It’s… it’s not normal, that’s for sure.”
Dean bobbed his head again, eyes drifting back to the body. He didn’t know why, but something didn’t seem right – less right than the glaringly obvious. “No signs of struggle?”
For a moment he couldn’t speak, could barely breathe, as his throat closed up and his hands started to shake. God fucking dammit, he hadn’t meant to say that out loud. Not like this – not to Sam first. He glanced around the parking lot, mortified by the mere idea that anyone else might have heard him, and swallowed heavily once he was sure nobody was looking at him.
Too late, Dean realizes that he’s said too much. Castiel still sucks at sarcasm and pop culture references, but math and logic? Castiel knows the very fabric of the universe; he can solve a problem like nobody’s business. It’s what made him the kind of tactician that Heaven would send down to Hell to rescue the righteous man.
Well, Dean can’t argue with that. Rock salt and iron can only make ghosts retreat for so long. With a groan, Dean bites back the pain and whacks at the coffin below him. It’s cheap and brittle, the wood having buckled under years of mold and rot and water damage and, after putting his back into it, he manages to break a sizeable hole in the top. He drops his shovel and grabs the can of gasoline and pours a liberal amount everywhere, wincing as it splatters on his shoes and the dirt. That finished, he goes to hop out of the grave, fiddling with his lighter.
All at once, his skin felt too tight around his bones, and the car was entirely too small, and he had to get out, get away, find somewhere he could
He was rambling. He knew it; Cas knew it, too, if his expression was anything to go by. With a deep breath, Dean forced himself to stop talking, gripping the steering wheel in his hands to ground himself instead. It only marginally helped, but it was better than nothing, and he sat there for a moment in complete silence, not daring to look at Cas in case he accidentally let slip what was swirling around in his head.
Dean rolls his eyes. It takes a lot more effort than he expects, given the demon’s psychic hold on him. “Well, how about you just happen to take a nosedive on Castiel’s blade and we’ll call it even?” he says.
“I can tell when humans are lying to me,” Castiel replies in an absent tone of voice, and oh good, he isn’t ignoring Dean completely. “You only told me the truth. It seemed very strange, since you seemed like the type to lie. And then I found myself telling you about Lucifer and then I knew.”
“Hey, I saved your life,” Dean retorts, kicking at the air until Castiel lowers him an inch or two and he can feel solid ground again. “And it worked, so don’t yell at me.”
Dean raises his hand and grips his shoulder again. He’s aware that it’s about as reassuring as hugging himself, but he can’t stop. He needs something.
Castiel goes still as stone. His feathers stop their casual brushing along Dean’s skin, his hand freezes, and every inch of his face ceases to move. It’s a little like he’s frozen in time and it would be off-putting if Dean didn’t know that whenever Castiel regresses to his alien angelic nature, it’s because he’s been well and truly shocked.
Castiel turns his head back to the demon. Even without his blade, he still looks dangerous, eyes set and wings churning at his back. “What do you want?”
He starts with, perhaps, the easiest. “I’m sorry.” They’re words he’s said so many times – to John, to Sam – and usually it gets brushed off.
Dean scowls and tucks the extra flashlight into his pocket. “Then why’d you let me add all this stuff if you weren’t gonna use it?”
Dean swings his shovel – well, actually, Castiel’s shovel, which apparently has iron inlaid in it, because the ghost shrieks and flickers out of existence. The downside of this is, of course, that the ghostly hand that had been wrapped around his throat vanishes too, and Dean plummets back into the six foot hole he had been digging.
Dean swallows hard and pinches himself, just to be sure. Then he reaches out one trembling hand and touches Castiel’s wing, and god. There are no words. The feathers are unbelievably silky, like the best, highest count thread sheets Dean has ever laid down on. They’re also incredibly strong when he runs his hand down one, because they don’t even bend a little bit under his pressure. And, best of all, they are
“You seem to have dedicated your life to hunting long term. Your fingerprints have been found at cases as far back as – ”
of ways to tell Castiel the feeling that’s been growing inside of him. He’s imagined a blurted out confession after Castiel saves his life from a monster for the hundredth time, or a half-asleep muttering when Castiel brings him breakfast, or even a slip of the tongue when he’s got his hands in Castiel’s wings and Castiel is a gooey mess underneath him. He’s had plenty of those moments, but every time it never seemed quite right, so Dean would always use his actions instead of words, letting Castiel crowd into his space and heal him or cuddle him.
The kiss he gives Dean is gentle, though, and it speaks volumes. So Dean leans up, wraps his arms around his soulmate, and kisses Castiel back, knowing Castiel will understand the truth he wants to say.
“Uh. . . should I not call you that? It’s a nickname.” When Castiel continues to stare at him, Dean explains hastily, “Humans give nicknames as like. A sign of affection. It’s not an insult, I promise.”
Castiel leans forward and clamps a hand on his shoulder, tight and unbreakable, and the world goes very dark for a moment, colors spinning into nothingness at his feet, the very air growing still against his body, like he’s been hurtled through space and time.
Castiel’s casual, off-hand tone catches on that roiling feeling in Dean’s stomach like sticks in a bicycle chain, jamming everything into a great big mess. Dean says lowly, “Are you planning to report to your superiors that you were gonna serve those demons up an angelic vessel on a silver platter?”
“Sure thing,” Dean says, because he has no desire to wake up anything or anyone else. “Anything else?”
, Dean. I am not letting you go now.” He looks away and shuffles in place, as if surprised by the vehemence in his own voice. With a gentler tone, he says, “And besides, the warrant for your arrest was merely a cover. My division wants to recruit you, Dean. You’ve done great work and solved many cases before we even realized there was a case. You are insightful, resourceful, and charismatic. You would be a great asset to my division.”
The first thing Dean sees when he lands on earth is the ceiling of the bunker, because he lands hard on his back.
“I, uh, saw an advertisement for a pie festival. Assuming that we get out of this place and ten thousand years haven’t passed, I think we need to go. I’ve bet Sam that I can eat at least ten slices. And hey, even if I lose, that just means more pie to bring home. Plus, you haven’t had some of these varieties yet, Cas, and that’s totally something we need to fix one you are, uh, you know. In possession of a body again. Hey, you did have a vessel again when the Shadow spat you out last time, right? Like you didn’t make your vessel? You popped up fully formed?”
A shadow falls upon the earth, huge and terrible, a shape Dean’s brain fails to recognize or categorize, and it is moving and –
Dean’s throat locks up. He opens his mouth and gasps for air, but even though he’s pulling it into his nose and mouth, nothing goes past the vice around his throat. He kicks his feet against the wall, but all that earns him is the demon’s mocking laughter.
The Shadow presses still-black fingers to its temples and rubs like it has a migraine. It mutters something under its breath, still in a language Dean doesn’t know, and heaves a deep sigh. “Fine,” it says, “fine, fine,
“Ah ah,” the demon croons. “There’ll be no running. We put so much effort into the welcome mat, after all.”
Castiel makes a rumbling noise of displeasure. His face wrinkles against the bed and his wings lift high into the air, rotating and flexing, like he’s testing his range of motion. Then he sighs wearily and says, “No. It’s much harder to kill an angel, I assure you. And much messier; my wings would be seared into the ground, and the explosion of grace would likely have leveled the barn.”
Castiel’s wings brush against Dean’s skin, sliding up and then down like he just shrugged his shoulders. Or maybe sighed, because Dean can feel the air from Castiel’s exhale. Either way, Castiel takes his hand off of Dean’s waist and does something.
A hand on his knee cuts him off. Castiel’s hand is as warm and grounding as his wings, fingers closed firmly on his knee. He has no idea how it’s comfortable for Castiel, but he shuffles forward to close the distance anyways, until his chest brushes against Castiel’s back when he breathes.
“What’s with the wing show? I thought you put them away yesterday cuz you didn’t want people to see.”
Castiel makes the noise again. He’s never seen that expression on Castiel’s face before – eyes wide and startled – but he’s uncomfortably aware that the noise Castiel is making is most certainly not one of disgust. Not even close.
Somehow, they’ve drifted together, knees bumping, breath mingling, close enough for Dean to reach out and
“You are my soulmate, and I am yours,” Castiel tells him, eyes locked onto Dean’s. “I will never hurt you. Ever.”
“You owe me, Cas!” he shouts, because he’s on a roll now. “You can’t say drop that kind of bomb on a guy and just – just
. The other twin bed has actually been shoved a few inches over, so that it bumps right up against the nightstand.
“Yes.” Castiel strokes his thumb against Dean’s shoulder, like he’s reassuring himself. “Every second we were apart, I counted. I had to know.”
“I’ll get burgers on the way back?” Sam offers, because sometimes he remembers to be a considerate brother.
“Kinky,” Dean says. “But I’m not really into – ” And the words die in his mouth because, oh right, he can’t lie to his soulmate.
Castiel also, apparently, used his mojo to clean up Dean’s clothes, because he doesn’t have a speck of dirt on him. He really hopes it was Castiel’s mojo, anyways, because the alternative is something that Dean’s brain shies away from thinking about.
“I don’t know, I figured you would have flapped back to Heaven by now! Don’t you have important angel things to do?”
It doesn’t look like anything special, just old and falling apart. Inside there’s graffiti all over the walls and floor, like some local kids went to town on them. There’s no footprints or dead bodies or blood. Dean’s just about thinking it’s a dead end when Castiel comes to an abrupt halt at his side.
And most unfortunate of all, Castiel says, “Is it customary to greet your soulmate by shooting them?”
“And after you sleep and are sufficiently rested,” Castiel continues, blithely ignoring him, “I think I would like to have sex.”
The Empty rumbles around him, like the sounds of something huge lumbering forward, but just as Dean flinches, certain he’s about to be eaten, a new sound enters the area. It’s a single high note, like a bell being rung, and as it echoes, it rises in pitch to an ear-splitting whine instead of falling like a normal bell.
and know that he’s referring to his own. It’s even more of a thrill to see the way Castiel clearly lights up – and not the scary way with his powers, the normal people way where he sits up straighter and his smile widens. It ignites a swarm of warm and hopelessly soft butterflies in his stomach.
“Wait, so what you’re saying…” Dean had to take a second to process everything. “Gloria Brown dies of natural causes and leaves no heir, so her pet vampire bird goes crazy with grief and starts killing anyone who ever wronged her while she was alive?”
“That Cas is safe, no, I know,” Sam finished for him, voice gentler than before. “But it’s a start, right? You just – shit, Dean, you can’t let it get in your head, okay? Before anything else – before
“Okay,” he sighed, and flicked through a few of the papers in front of them. “What else? Anything interesting?”
Cas squinted at him, head tilted to the side curiously, and it looked like he was about to say something else, so Dean quickly cut him off.
“Alright, alright, laugh it up all you want,” Emmie tutted, but she had been smiling shyly all the while. “You’re all just jealous.”
Drew was taller than him by at least three inches, and not nearly as stocky. He’d opted, that day, to wear a thick green sweater that brought out the flecks of hazel in his brown eyes, and he hadn’t bothered to style his hair; it hung in loose, golden curls across his forehead, and had reminded Dean, for just a moment, of a halo. He had a way about him, a quiet confidence that Dean wasn’t used to seeing in kids his own age, as if he didn’t have a care in the world. Dean had supposed he didn’t – at least, not in comparison with himself – but it was still strange to witness first-hand.
probably wouldn’t be the word I’d use to describe it,” Cas replied, folding his arms across his chest in a way that Dean recognised as defensive. “But don’t feel like you need to inquire, Dean. I know my taking male lovers makes you uncomfortable –“
“It’s the truth, Dean,” Cas shook his head, knocking a couple of tears loose in the process. “And you still refuse to see it.”
“You’re a lucky guy,” he murmured, glancing up at Cas with a tight smile. “You’re getting the five-star treatment, here, buddy.”
trying to find the words to describe what Cas meant to him. It sometimes terrified him, the things he would do for Cas – the things he
Because suddenly he’d had people to sit with in class, and houses to go to after school that didn’t belong to Bobby, and of course he’d still walked Sammy home and made sure he’d had dinner first, but he’d also had something that, for the first time in his life, was just his. He’d had a study buddy in Emmie, and a partner in crime in Lilah, and Drew – who he had immediately found a kindred spirit in after realising he was just as big a Star Wars nerd as Dean was – had immediately taken him under his wing. Within a few weeks, they had been inseparable, and Dean felt as though he had known them all his life.
There weren’t any more witnesses at the campsite. Even the boys who had found the body had nothing else to add, and Dean got the distinct impression that their mother was about to rip his head off if he didn’t back off, so he didn’t push for more information.
fun,” Sam laughed a moment later, and slapped Dean on the shoulder as he got to his feet. “You want a beer? I need a beer.”
Cas smelled. How had he never noticed before? Earthy, and warm, and masculine, with just a hint of something otherworldly that Dean couldn’t quite place; the scent made his gut clench with want. How had he managed to hide what Cas really meant to him from himself for so long? He
He hadn’t slept well. The storm had continued long into the night, and while it had been suspiciously dry when they’d left the motel that morning, the thunder had been more than enough to produce an uneasy sleep. Add to that the truly terrible mattress, and a snoring angel that, despite his insistence that he wasn’t tired, had almost immediately fallen asleep, and Dean felt like his head was about to explode.
A huge gust of wind blows into the clearing when the creature alights on the grass. The wings, which had already been terrifying by the size of their shadows alone, are truly awe-inspiring, stretching to the edges of the clearing, flexing and shifting, and Dean would almost think that they’re real feathers of a real bird. But they’re not, he knows they’re not, because the colors – deep greens and purples that darken into black as deep as midnight – are out of this world and utterly unnatural.
“Of course I want you,” Castiel tells him. “Of course I want this. Why do you think I searched for you for so long?”
He works through Castiel’s left wing, combing through healthy feathers and gently tugging out loose ones, and midway he looks over and sees that Castiel has let his head loll to the right, appearing for all intents and purposes like he’s fallen asleep again. He looks strangely young like that, not the millennia-old warrior of God or the intense, unyielding celestial being who’d flown down and claimed Dean as his. He just looks like
What Dean means to say is a fairly well-rehearsed script: “Hi, my name is Agent Young, I have a few questions related to the incident that happened about two, three nights ago.”
And, well, Dean has to kiss him for that. He pulls on Castiel’s arms and Castiel comes, like he always done, answering Dean with an open heart and matching him beat for beat, like they are two puzzle pieces fitting perfectly together, two birds in perfect flight, two notes in perfect harmony. They kiss until Dean is dizzy and breathless, as much from the lack of air as from the sheer wonder that is having Castiel.
“RUN!” Castiel bellows, and there’s genuine fear in his voice that shakes Dean to his very core, because what could scare
“Forgive me if I don’t trust your word,” Castiel replies dryly, ignoring Sam losing it in the corner again. But his eyes soften and he stands up, walking right into Dean’s personal space as he comes over to the bed, and Dean has nowhere to go, so he has to just lay there, squished against the mattress like a bug waiting to be stomped on, as Castiel leans over the handcuffs. Warm fingers touch his hand and Castiel flicks his wrist, murmuring a word under his breath. The handcuffs click open and Dean breathes a sigh of relief.
He walks in silence for a little bit, after all. Silence with Castiel is never really silence, after all. Castiel can be still as stone, but he’s been around humans long enough to pick up their ticks; he blinks, sometimes, he shuffles his hands and feet, he leans forward or moves back. And he can pack a whole insult in a single glare.
After two hours, Dean starts praying. Castiel normally appears almost instantly when Dean prays or if they’re together, his head turns to Dean immediately. It’s strange now, to see Castiel just lie there and not even twitch. Even his wings aren’t moving at all, and they’re so dull Dean can barely make out the purples and greens that are usually so vibrant.
, and he’s definitely recovered because only through angelic strength could he have yanked Dean fully onto the bed without moving any other body part or showing any strain of effort at pulling a full-grown man up off the floor.
“I must admit that I don’t quite grasp how human transactions work, but that sounds like an expensive endeavor.”
“You can’t hurt my wings. You’d need demonic strength for that. Or angelic.” With a grunt, Castiel lifts his right wing up, curving it above the empty space like an umbrella. “Get on the bed, Dean.”
Like he can read Dean’s mind, Castiel reminds him, “You can’t hurt my wings, Dean. Just run your hands through and straighten the feathers.”
Castiel, as always, remains the unique outlier. “I’m sorry too,” he says, voice gentle and soft. “I didn’t mean to brush off your concerns. I just. You are very important to me, Dean. I would give anything for you not to feel pain again.”
“The blade is inscribed with special sigils. There are not many left in the world. I had thought that they’d all been destroyed long ago.”
He clears his throat and says, “I invoke, conjure, and command you, appear unto me before this circle.”
“No, this was a, uh. Surprise.” Castiel inclines his head at the gift in Dean’s hands. “We wanted to congratulate him on a successful first semester.”
And then he frowns, because the sky is actually changing. The overcast clouds that lingered ever since he trekked out to this clearing are parting like the red sea, opening around a hole right above the clearing. He could say it was the wind, which is now starting to pick up, but that would be wishful thinking, because he can see the lightning flashing in the clouds and hear the rumble of thunder. Even the ground is vibrating and shaking, and Dean dives for his gun because like hell is he going to be caught off guard and with his pants down now that some kind of supernatural entity has taken an interest in his dead end, useless soulmate summoning ritual.
Then they actually high five, and Dean stares at them trying to make sense of the chaos that is now his life. They are both wearing puppyish grins of excitement, sleeves rolled up and vibrating with the thrill of a case solved, and it’s sickeningly adorable and frighteningly chaotic at the same moment.
Surprisingly, though, the Shadow does not fly into a rage, like the archangels did, or reel back in shock, like the princes of hell did. A smile curves the lips of the one Dean is looking at, revealing perfect black teeth, and it says, “My, my, you really are a brave one. Castiel’s memories did not do you justice.”
Dean would totally give up his memory foam for Castiel, but Castiel doesn’t need to know it. Instead he just grins and says, “Second nightstand is all yours, then.”
He doesn’t wait for Castiel’s reaction, however small it might be. He doesn’t let himself even blink, because he knows if he stops and pauses and blinks he’ll look back, he’ll turn around and open his eyes and do everything the Shadow warned himself not to do.
“I just did,” Castiel says, a tinge of pride in his voice. He frowns slightly when he sees Dean’s eyes tracking his wings in the reflection on the Impala and rolls his shoulders back, almost like he’s trying to make himself smaller – and then his wings are just
Dean crosses his arms and glares at the doppelgänger. It’s a little disconcerting, to say the least; Dean had just gotten used to the featureless darkness that stretched in every direction around him when parts of the darkness had started moving, tentacles writhing and flowing together to coalesce into a humanoid figure. He’d been duly impressed – until colors had rippled across the blackness and resolved themselves into Castiel, blue eyes and tan trench coat and dark hair.
Such dangerous truths. Dean shuts his eyes and takes a deep breath. If he owes anyone the truth, it’s his soulmate.
Dean grabs his hand and drags him off before they get arrested. Castiel, after a brief pause where he’s as immovable as a pillar of stone, follows his lead, although he keeps sniffing the air like a damn bloodhound and attracting strange looks from every person they pass. Dean grits his teeth and pulls harder and blesses his lucky stars that he grabbed everything from the sheriff before they went into the morgue.
When Dean emerges, Castiel is sitting awkwardly on the sofa, too straight and too unmoving to ever pass as human. Jess is bustling around, trying to clean up the stacks of papers and utensils littered about the room, so she doesn’t notice, but Dean still rolls his eyes and nudges Castiel hard when he sits down next to him.
After three hours, the adrenaline crash really hits Dean hard. He finds himself starting to nod off in his chair, and the fifth time he nearly hits the floor he gives up and relocates. He has no desire to accidentally hurt Castiel by jostling his wings, so Dean bunches up his jacket into a nice pillow and sits on the floor next to the bed. It’s an awkward angle, but he’s definitely slept in worse positions, and this gives him the optimum position to immediately see if Castiel’s eyes open.
It turns out that Castiel did not fly back to Heaven or whatever. No, he apparently wandered off when Dean was gaming the vending machine because he disapproved of the food quality and inquired about actual breakfast food. And then, instead of telling Dean what he was doing, he just flew off and got said food and then, upon seeing Dean was no longer at the motel, he looked for Dean’s soul and winged his way into Dean’s car.
Somehow, Dean gets Castiel back to the hotel. He’s not really sure how, because he spends most of the trip frantically worrying about Castiel, who is passed out in the backseat, and then worrying about how to get Castiel into the hotel room without people seeing his enormous wings, and then worrying about how to arrange Castiel comfortably on the bed. However, Castiel is also very heavy, since he’s basically dead weight, so Dean is eventually forced to just lower Castiel onto his stomach on the bed before his arms give out.
Dean has approximately two seconds to think about what might happen if he pisses off the Shadow and wakes something else up before he decides he doesn’t care. He came for Castiel, and he isn’t leaving without him.
Yet every time he looks up at Sam’s apartment block – thank God Sam still uses the same stupid dumb usernames for his burner phone and leaves the GPS tracking on – Dean can hardly breathe, much less walk.
Dean grabs the pipe, jumps to his feet, and swings as hard as he can at the chanting demon. He connects with a very satisfying
He sounds a bit drunk and when Dean leans forward, he can see that Castiel’s eyes are closed shut and his face is lax like a contend cat. Dean hasn’t even touched his left wing, but it’s fully splayed out and relaxed on the bed, no longer arched up and shielding them both like Castiel normally has it. Dean is sure that at any sign of danger, it would flick up immediately, but for now, Castiel is basically putty in Dean’s hands.
There’s the booming blast of a gunshot, and Dean kind of regrets insisting that Castiel go help Sam, because it would’ve been nice if Castiel had shot Dean’s ghost for him.
Castiel frowns at him. “He’s your brother. Of course you want him protected. And so do I. Besides, we need more information, and it is possible that the demons will try again after we leave.”
Dean is too busy being horrified at the idea of Castiel’s beautiful wings burnt into ash on the ground to reply, so Castiel just continues, “I was merely . . . recharging, I suppose you would call it.”
The woman’s eyes, which were already wide when she heard Castiel’s name, go saucer-sized when she hears
The ghost rematerializes next to her grave, sneering at them. Castiel snarls at her, deep in his throat, and glows even brighter, if that were possible. His wings flare up, spreading like a peacock’s tail to make his outline even bigger.
) but he can’t look away, because Castiel won’t let him. He pushes at Castiel, shoving against the tree and his chest, but both are immovable as stone. Even Castiel’s wings hold steady when Dean tries to go sideways instead of forward. Castiel doesn’t even seem to notice that Dean is trying to get free; either Dean needs to exercise more, or angels are just really goddamn strong.
Castiel doesn’t even blink at the change in his demeanor. He tilts his head and replies, “I’ve been looking for you for a long time now. It would be nice to know that my method of following suspicious deaths paid off. Although I suppose that luck intervening on our side would be nice as well,” he muses.
“You don’t think you deserve a soulmate,” Castiel says, voice too loud in their little cocoon. He sounds at once like he’s discovered the secret to the universe and his favorite pet dog just died, triumphant and terribly sad.
“No, that’s what you are. Come on, man, I’ve been hunting since I was a kid. I know what I’m doing. We’ll cover more ground if we split up.”
Castiel’s angel mojo gets them into the apartment building, and fortunately, most of the college students are too harried to give them a second glance. That or Castiel is redirecting them. Either way, Dean is very happy that they don’t get stopped or questioned, because he really is sweating too hard to throw on his fake smile and turn up the charm, and relying on Castiel to lie convincingly is like asking a vampire not to drink blood.
Sam looks up, a sweet smile on his face for Jess, and then stops dead in his tracks like he’s been whacked over the head. Dean would know; he’s seen it in person.
And is promptly body slammed by a pissed off Castiel. Dean wriggles and kicks, but Castiel takes his blows without flinching and wrestles him to the ground, belly down and arms firmly pinned at his back, a knee digging painfully into his waist. Trying to push against him is like trying to move a mountain, and Dean lets loose a string of curses and debates trying to bite him.
“Dean, it all tastes like molecules,” he protests. “I don’t think there is anything on this menu that can – ”
“Oh,” says the woman who is not Sam but is standing in Sam’s apartment, wearing shorts and a Smurfs T-shirt. “I thought the pizza place had for once managed to get to us on time. Are you lost?”
! You owe me and god damn it, I will say it right here and now and let every sleeping monster in this place hear me if you don’t get back here right now.”
Castiel pivots on his heel and faces the three remaining demons. His wings snap out and spread wide, sliding between Dean and the demons as if to shield him.
“Because you are my soulmate, and you asked me to come,” Castiel answers simply, and his wing brushes down Dean’s face, a caress softer than any hand. “So I came.”
“Oh, nothing much. Just tore into his mind and laid open every little juicy wound,” Shadow says casually. “Every single morsel of regret, every single bite of fear, every little drop of sadness – ah, they were delicious. I do think Castiel has been my favorite, to be honest. I could feed off of him, well, forever.”
And of course Dean knows that Castiel can’t lie to him, but it’s different, somehow, hearing Castiel say words that clearly pain him, seeing Castiel fidget and look down, watching how his shoulders shrink and he hunches in on himself. He obviously thinks that Dean is going to do a runner, pack his things and vanish into the night like he did all those years ago.
“Don’t. You. Dare. You know better than I do what a demon could do with your meatsuit. I’m not worth that many deaths.”
“Unless your angelic nostrils say something different, that’s still my top choice. Maybe this werewolf was just a little overzealous.”
“I’m not done yet.” Dean takes a deep breath. You can’t lie to your soulmate, but that only applies to what comes out of your mouth. He could never say anything else, and Castiel would never know but – but Dean ran from Castiel once, and it’s only sheer dumb luck that brought them together again. He can’t count on that luck again. If anything, usually Dean has worse luck than the average person.
They’ve kissed before of course, many times. Dean likes to kiss Castiel’s neck or the arch of his back, and sometimes he is daring and kisses Castiel’s feathers for the shivers it earns him. Castiel likes whatever part of Dean he can get; he seems to be equally as enamored with Dean’s back as his face.
And this, this is exactly why Dean argued that it should be him – not Sam, not Jack, not anyone else. Because Dean knows that when he raises his chin and stares in defiance and says “Yep” it really pisses people off.
For that, he’s treated to another patented Castiel eye roll. “My true form is, yes, but if you saw that your eyes would burn out of your skull.”
Dean falters, because that isn’t really where he was expecting Castiel to go. But then he remembers that Sam is probably going to come back because he expects to compare notes, which means he needs to get out and preferably far, far away before Castiel figures out that he can get the Winchester fugitives in a two-for-one package deal. So he says, “And I bet you don’t want a dropout fugitive attached to your squeaky-clean name, so how about you just let me – ”
For one thing, he has no idea how to fix a passed out angel. If it were Sam, Dean would make sure his injuries were fixed up and then leave him a water bottle. But Castiel doesn’t even breathe, much less drink.
Castiel smiles lazily at him, indulgent and smug like a cat that’s got the cream. “Those of the Heavenly Host can blend in with humans to walk among them, Dean. Do you really think you are the first human to behold us as we are?”
At that point, Dean is itching to get away, so he just nods and stomps in the grass, grateful that Castiel does not follow him. Out of the corner of his eye, he thinks he sees the telltale shimmer of Castiel’s wings sliding into this plane of existence, but then he turns past a tree and loses sight of Castiel altogether. It leaves Dean alone for the first time in two days, and he revels in it.
And Dean isn’t stupid, he knows the rules, he knows soulmates cannot lie to each other no matter what and it sure makes for some awkward-as-hell first dates but – but Dean had met Castiel once and within five seconds had spilled the story about Sam, he had told Castiel about being bisexual when he still hasn’t even told Sam or Bobby, and when he had walked away it had physically hurt with each step, like a part of him was being left behind.
Which is when Dean remembers that, oh yeah, Castiel flashed an FBI badge at him. “And you, uh, work for the FBI? Do they know?” he asks, angling for as casual as he can while he goes back to working on escaping the handcuffs. “Or is that fake?”
“You’re not a hammer, Cas. You tried to fix Heaven, and yeah, you messed up, but hey, I started the apocalypse, I’m not one to talk. And you – you changed me too. You had
Castiel hums in the affirmative. “I can give Sam and Jess anti-possession sigils like the one I gave you. If they want.”
“I’ll watch over you,” Castiel says and perches on the desk chair like some kind of night sentry, unblinking as always. Dean’s learned the hard way that Castiel takes almost everything very, very literally now, and he can just imagine Castiel staring at him all night, and just. No.
Castiel backs away, a smug little smile on his face, and Dean realizes that the wrist Castiel flicked now has the other cuff on it. If he squints, he can just make out the faintest, glittering thread that connects them, like a magical rope or chain.
That being said, Dean finds no salt barrier, no iron, no silver, and when he toes back the rug, he sees no devil’s trap.
The words catch in Dean’s throat. He digs his fingers into his shoulder, until it’s painful, and tries again.
“We all have our faults,” Castiel tells him. “You are not the only person who lashes out when they feel impatient, or angry, or scared. Or who fails to communicate when it would be wise.”
And, Christ, what the hell is Dean supposed to do with that? What is he supposed to do when an angel, a celestial being, a warrior of God looks at him and says
Just because he can, Dean raises a hand and waves obnoxiously, because he’s sure the Shadow is still watching. Then he turns around and starts walking before the Shadow decides to go back on its word and flay him alive anyways.
Looking at them, Dean has to wonder if he would have assumed Castiel was a monster if he wasn’t raised a hunter, because Castiel’s wings are so beautiful that Dean is sure people would worship at Castiel’s feet if they only saw one glimpse of them.
Every night Dean goes to bed knowing that Castiel is watching and keeping the nightmares at bay, and every morning he wakes up to Castiel sunning himself or poking tentatively at Dean’s laptop or watching the television with his patented squint of confusion. Castiel never complains about the long drives or the loud music, and Dean doesn’t complain about Castiel’s habit of standing way too close or rummaging all through Dean’s stuff whenever he pleases. Castiel never quite comes around to pie and he can’t get drunk, but at least they can both enjoy the same greasy as hell burgers.
Brady screams in agony when Castiel’s palm touches his face. Sam yells in shock, Jess shrieks – and then it’s over.
The Shadow easily evades his grip. Dean’s not sure whether it moves or it moves him, but he blinks and it’s exactly the same distance away as it was before he jumped. The many doppelgängers stick their hands in their pockets, lax and slouched in a way Castiel never was, and the Shadow’s voice echoes from a new doppelgänger at Dean’s back.
Castiel’s eyes fade slowly back to their normal blue. He looks down and away, throat working around words he doesn’t say. His wings drift slowly down, folding up and close to Castiel’s back, even though they don’t go away fully. Castiel looks utterly torn, and it’s the strangest look Dean’s ever seen on his face, because Castiel has always known what is right and what to do. He’s never wavered on his path. He found Dean and called him his soulmate and followed him until Dean gave up and accepted him.
“Don’t be silly,” it chides, suddenly back to cheerful condescension, not a hint of the rage from earlier. “If I was going to kill you, I’d have to wake Castiel up so he could watch as I slowly flayed your body and soul and mind apart! And with my luck he’d never fall asleep again.”
Castiel tilts his head and his wings draw back. He looks like a bird when he does it. “Why would I eat you?” he asks, sounding absolutely mystified. “I do not require sustenance. And I do not imagine you would taste very good.”
because this isn’t like a blanket corner or a stray dust ball; this movement is purposeful and alive, and Dean’s eyes are shooting open because his brain is finally kicking in and –
No matter what Dean does – stomping his feet, yelling at the top of his lungs, clapping his hands – the Shadow does not re-emerge. Even worse, the feeling of being watched ratchets up. It was already bad when the Shadow was prowling around him; now the hairs on the back of his head are really standing up, and it’s even worse when Dean remembers just how many powerful, ancient, dead celestial beings are probably all around, trapped in eternal slumber, probably just out of Dean’s eyesight.
, as abruptly as if she’d been shot with salt or hit with iron even though Dean didn’t hear anyone approaching, and new hands catch Dean when he lists sideways, gulping for air like a fish flopping on the shore. The hands are warm, almost too warm actually, and Dean looks up –
It’s a pretty basic sigil, all things considered. Five points, a star in the center, and various symbols of protection and invocation scattered around the edges. Most people don’t bother learning it because psychics insist only they can properly use it, but the truth is that anyone can use this summoning sigil as long as they know how to draw it correctly, and the first thing Dean learned to draw after his name was a devil’s trap.
The right wing dips down, feathers splaying across the floor, and Castiel turns very slightly to look at Dean over his shoulder. “Good morning, Dean,” he says.
That ancient malice intensifies. “Speaking of walking . . . How the hell did you even get in here?” it demands, prowling around him. Each step is military precise, the exact same distance, the exact same movement, perfect and inhuman, like it watched a documentary and copied it. Even Castiel didn’t walk like that, not even when he was brand new to his vessel.
“Personal space,” Dean repeats. “Like. My space bubble. That other people don’t come into. Because it’s mine.”
And then Dean smells it: that undefinable, indescribable, undeniable scent of fresh air. Sun and wind and grass. Pies and burgers and fries. Life.
It’s the best time Dean’s ever had. There are no cases they can’t solve, no places they can’t reach, no monsters they can’t kill.
He’s just craning his head to make the turn where he hears the strangest sort of flapping, rustling noise, like a nature documentary has interrupted the radio. Dean turns his head and is nearly slapped in the face by a huge wing.
Sometime in the middle of the night, Castiel must have finally given up in his quest to stare at Dean. The curtains, which Dean definitely closed after he brushed his teeth, are now flung wide open and are letting in the morning sun. The two chairs that were in front of the window have been neatly piled by the desk Castiel was sitting on during their argument over whether or not to leave the light on because
He had thought, just for once, maybe, he’d get a lucky break. Sam had gotten his – Jack had just snapped his fingers, and Eileen had barreled out of the bunker and slammed full tilt into Sam and there had been kissing and crying and a lot of yelling. But then Jack had turned sorrowful eyes on Dean, and Dean had known there would be no such easy fix for Castiel.
“You really have no idea what it takes to resurrect someone, do you?” the Shadow drawls. It lifts a hand and starts examining it, turning it to and fro, picking at its nail, poking at its skin. “It’s not just a body, Dean. Don’t you remember when Castiel resurrected you? I mean, sure, he gave you a shiny new virgin body, but he also had to reassemble your soul and reconstruct your mind. And Castiel is – how did he say it – a ‘multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent’. He’s a far more complicated puzzle piece than, well, you.”
“I am not immune to the laws of soulmates just because I am a supernatural being,” Castiel says sharply. “I cannot lie to you, as you cannot lie to me.”
Castiel squeezes his shoulder tight, so tight it almost burns. Dean welcomes that pain, the reminder of Castiel’s angelic strength, his unyielding nature, his single-minded determination.
Before the syllable even leaves his mouth, the Shadow is off its throne. The doppelgängers and the throne melt away, blurring back together into the one Shadow form that marches up to him and punches him straight in the gut. It’s like being hit by a truck.
Castiel’s face contorts with rage. His eyes go bright with power, his fingers go hot where they’re wrapped into Dean’s collar, and Dean sees the sweeping shadow of great arcing wings in his back. He looks like he’s about two seconds from incinerating Dean himself.
The Shadow shrieks in rage. Its outline goes blurry again, dark tendrils and black ooze, and this time when it reassembles, it pounces onto Dean’s chest and locks its hands around his throat.
The lightshow ends as abruptly as it began. The monster’s screams cut off as abruptly as though it had been muted, and Castiel lets it fall to a heap in the ground, his expression shifting into quiet disinterest. He looks more like he just stepped on an ant than he murdered a monster via angelic power, not the least bit out of breath or scared.
, hearing him prioritize Sam as family and important, knowing that Castiel does it because of Dean, for Dean –
“Well, it’s not much, but I’ll take it,” Dean says. “Now I just need to make sure I have silver bullets."
But instead, Castiel’s right wing slowly curves backwards, all of those gorgeous purple and green feathers brushing up against Dean’s arm, tentative like a kicked puppy who is hopeful for pets instead of blows but can’t be sure. This close, Dean can see the numerous patches where feathers were ruffled out of alignment by the fight and the demons, and he’s almost too afraid to touch them and make it worse, even though he’s the one that offered.
Dean swallows, but the guilty feeling doesn’t dissipate. He clears his throat instead. “With your wings. They look a little ragged.”
“Angel. You know. Wings. Halo. Warrior of God. The whole shebang,” Dean says casually. “He probably has a harp too but he refuses to admit it.”
Castiel inclines his head at the door. “Well, is there anyone else who you are hunting with who is now attempting to pick the lock on my door?”
It’s not lost on him, the fact that he is mirroring Castiel’s behavior. Castiel watches him all the time and normally Dean hates it, but now he’d give anything for Castiel to sit up and stare at him with those all-seeing blue eyes again.
Fortunately, now that Castiel is actually out of his way – although he still keeps moving, orbiting Dean at a careful three steps away like he’s the moon and Dean is the earth and it’s terribly distracting – Dean is able to get everything else packed in short order. It’s not much, since Dean learned a long time ago not to get attached, but Dean still double checks the table, bed, and drawer before he zips up his bag and heads out. Castiel follows like a silent puppy as Dean locks the room, checks out at the front desk, and raids the vending machine, and yet, somehow, when Dean goes to head out into the parking lot, there is no stalker shadow at his back when he reaches the Impala.
With the land, the sky, and the water all accounted for, the soulmate summoning ritual is basically primed for ignition. All that remains is the personal touch, the bit that makes the magic go and seek out the face of his soulmate, his other half, his beloved and relays the image into the flames that appear before the one who is doing the seeking. So Dean grabs the knife, cuts his palm, and lets his blood flow into the bowl, watching as the sigil painted in the grass goes from white to gold and not even wincing as the air begins to crackle with energy.
Castiel stares at him like he doesn’t understand English. Dean gestures wildly between them and almost whacks Castiel on the arm, because Castiel is seriously way too damn close.
Castiel turns out not to have been joking about the handcuff being spelled. Although Dean holds it up to the light and pries at it, he can find no seam, and although it’s thinner than a pencil, he can’t bend it at all. When he tries to jam it open using a knife, sigils light up in the metal, like a warning, and Dean gives up and stomps out of the bathroom.
Castiel rolls his eyes just as Sam runs up, dirt smeared across his hands and blood dripping down the side of his face. It’s a job well done, Dean thinks, except of course when he goes to stand up, his ankle and his throbbing head make themselves known again.
Dean thinks at him. Castiel had once explained to him that he can find Dean by prayer, but while Dean had thought of rosaries and chants, Castiel had shrugged and said that angels were multidimensional beings and therefore capable of picking up on less formalized versions.
“Oh, you talk? Great. I’m gonna let this do the talking for me, though,” Dean tells it, and fires right at its ugly head.
“Done it a million times before,” Dean says through a mouthful of burger. “Dude, this is awesome! Where’d you even get this?”
Suddenly, the creature yelps and goes backwards. Bright light surrounds its head, too bright, and the monster screeches and screams as it’s hauled off of Dean by something.
Dean turns, just to make sure that the Shadow is stalking him from behind, but he doesn’t see any ooze or tendrils. The feeling of being watched doesn’t go away, either.
Castiel looks down at the empty plate, a mournful expression in his eyes. “Ah. I seem to have finished it.”
smile and holds up his badge as the door swings open. He even gets started on his spiel as the door is opening because he’s learned the hard way that some people wrongly assume he’s housekeeping and slam the door shut in his face. Or, worse, assume he’s soliciting for . . . other things.
Yep, the deep voice wasn’t a hallucination either. “Morning,” Dean replies. “You, uh, felt the need to redecorate last night?”
He’s just about to start drying stuff when his feather bracelet grows warm on his arm. Dean knows exactly what that means, so he smiles and leans back, just in time for Castiel to appear in a rustling of feathers. Castiel slips his wings and arms around Dean, grumbling quietly to himself, and presses close until they’re touching from chest to toes.
Dean swallows hard. Castiel’s damn wing still keeps his head from moving, but he lets his gaze go out of focus. He stares at Castiel’s ear rather than his eye, anything but his all-too-knowing eyes. It’s one thing to know something about yourself; it’s another for an angel of the goddamn Lord to call you out on it. And if Castiel can look deep enough into his soul to figure it out, well, then he can probably see exactly why Dean doesn’t deserve a soulmate.
“I am the Shadow,” comes the cacophony of voices. “I am the Empty. I came before God, and before the Darkness, and before Creation. I am older than life and I am older than death. Every celestial being you have ever fought, I have forced into eternal slumber, and you think I should bow to
“We salt and burn the – oh, okay, good to know angels can just, uh, set fire to bodies,” Dean says belatedly, after Castiel has snapped his fingers and gotten a healthy little blaze going. He’s a little sad, because it’s cathartic as hell to burn the monster and know it’ll never hurt anyone else, but then he brightens, because there’s another post hunt ritual he can drag Castiel into instead.
“My name is not ‘squeaky clean’,” Castiel objects, and he honest-to-God makes air quotes. “The Novak bloodline has been responsible for some truly horrendous things in our past – ”
Dean swallows hard and is suddenly very, very grateful that Castiel is his soulmate and didn’t smite him the second he came down from Heaven.
. The whole world fades away, sounds and lights falling to the edges of his perception, until there’s nothing and no one but Castiel, glowing and happy like he’s the only thing that matters, because he is.
After one hour, he stops getting up every five minutes to check if Castiel is breathing (he’s not, angels don’t need to breathe, and the heart attack Dean gets every time he forgets really gets old after a while).
Castiel flicks his blade up, fury in every line of his face. His wings crackle like thunderstorms behind him and Dean is sure that if he could get out of the angel trap, he’d burn the entire place to the ground instantly. “You dare to attack one of Heaven’s Host?”
“I will return,” Castiel replies, completing their little ritual, and the soft look on his face – that’s all for Dean.
And then it’s over – the high-pitched ringing cuts off abruptly, the light dies away, and the only sounds are Dean and Castiel breathing heavily. Dean looks up, tentatively, and finds no sign of the demons. All that’s left are piles of faintly-smoking ash scattered around the barn.
He walks until he finds a small little clearing, where there’s enough room to sketch out a good sized summoning sigil. After he sets down his bag and walks the area, making sure nothing jumps out at him, he takes out the can of spray paint and begins marking up the clearing, white lines sharp against the green grass.
“Deal,” Sam echoes, except when Dean holds out his hand to shake, his brother reels him in and squashes him in a hug instead.
“I hate you,” Dean declares and stomps towards Sam’s apartment building before he can lose his nerve again.
So he looks at Castiel with his messy bedhead and backwards tie and weird trench coat, and he says, “Prove it.”
kind of response from Castiel. He’s relied on Castiel’s body language for so long that without it, he feels like he’s flailing in the darkness, both literally and figuratively. Even when he reaches up to his shoulder, he feels nothing, not even a twinge from the place where Castiel once seared his claim into Dean’s body.
“Heaven’s resources should always be utilized to thwart Hell’s plans,” Castiel answers. “And Sam is important to me. He is family now, as you are. I would defend him myself, but I will not leave you.”
It wasn’t like he disliked being at Bobby’s – in fact, just the opposite. At Bobby’s, he didn’t have to worry about where their next meal was going to come from, or whether Sammy would be safe. At Bobby’s, he could relax a little, safe in the knowledge that he had backup when it came to Sammy’s care.
One appeared near his head a few moments later, and he took it with a quiet thanks. Paxton leaned over the boulders, trying to catch a glance at whatever it was he’d found.
“Our time together was very pleasurable,” Cas shrugged a single shoulder, as though he were talking about root vegetables or baseball scores rather than his
“Dude, party foul,” she tutted, completely oblivious to what had just happened. “Warn a girl, why don’t you?”
“You just told me,” Castiel reminds him impatiently. “At the door. I assume you’re investigating the suspicious deaths?”
“We have them,” Castiel announces, sounding delighted. “Excellent work, Sam. I’ll call my superiors and let them know that this is a standard salt and burn.”
The demon sighs. “You have my word I’ll let the human go. Honestly, he’s tainted goods anyways. He smells horrible. Too much angel stink, if you ask me.”
Castiel does not like pancakes, waffles, or hash browns. He makes a curious face at the eggs, but ultimately declines those too.
She screeches in his face, fury written in every line of her transparent form, and slams him against the tombstone again. It’s not enough to make him lose consciousness, but it is enough for him to know that he’s going to have a fun headache in the morning.
Castiel scowls and grabs his shoulder, holding him as effortlessly still as he had held the monster. “Human hands can heal as well as harm,” he says shortly. “So can mine. Now please, hold still, Dean.”
So tonight, like most nights, Dean slides under the sheets and Castiel slips a wing over him, sheltering him from head to toe, radiating warmth like a heater.
“I gotta check out of the hotel. Make sure Baby is okay. And, uh, probably try and find someplace to eat.”
“Hey, don’t pull those puppy dog eyes on me,” Dean says. “Heaven was a wreck long before we happened to it, buddy, and you know it. And Jack said he could fix it. Plus he can probably give you your wings back. Although that is
“I don’t understand that reference,” Castiel replies grumpily. “Also, you still have not explained why
“Well, this ain’t my credit card,” Dean informs him smugly, and flags down the waitress to order more food. Fortunately, this is a 24/7 diner, and serves breakfast all day, so Dean grabs Castiel’s fries and sets about ordering some breakfast.
. “Oh my god, Sam’s mentioned you!” she says. “Does he know you’re coming? He didn’t say a thing to me!”
Castiel nips at him for that, teeth angel sharp, before he sighs and draws back. “I need to report this to my superiors. At the very least, the fact that so many demons were watching Sam is very concerning. I may request another to help with the interrogation.”
“Oh,” Castiel says, brightening. His wings fluff up and spread wide, as if he’s preparing to fly. “A human method of transport. Yes. That will be useful.”
“Not as hot as you,” Dean teases, tracing a finger over the feather bracelet on his arm. Castiel bent it into a circle for him, in order to make it easier for Dean to keep on his person. Usually he keeps it hidden under his clothes, but he never takes it off. It’s not like he can damage it, after all, and he prefers to keep it close by, visible proof of Castiel for whenever he has doubts.
“And I’ve missed you too,” Dean says, lamely. “It’s not the same. Without you. I’ve had to drive that ugly car of yours, for starters. We are so getting you a better car. We’ve got like seven dozen in the garage, one of them must – ”
And it’s also really freaking pretty. Dean has lost countless hours tracing the shimmering purples and greens.
Dean tips his head forward and rests it against Castiel’s neck. Castiel takes his weight easily, and Dean knows that even if Castiel lost his powers and couldn’t actually pick Dean up with one hand without breaking a sweat, he’d still let Dean do this, and that knowledge is heady.
And, well, Dean does the reasonable thing after that: he gets up, he readjusts his clothes, and he charges straight at the Shadow.
“I’m sure you know what happens when a human looks at an angel’s true form,” the Shadow interrupts casually. “If you look at your boyfriend before he’s on earth in a vessel, you’ll be a melted puddle of atoms on the ground. And, you know, Castiel will be stuck here, awake forever, with only your sad little pile of atoms for company. So, no pressure.”
Castiel gives him a look over his shoulder that says he doesn’t quite believe Dean. His wings don’t vanish, but they do fold up, pressing close to Castiel’s back and making him look suddenly smaller again. Vulnerable.
“Cas,” Dean says, because he still has one last thing to say. “I don’t want you to go. Back to Heaven.”
He swats at her, even though he knows it won’t help anything because the shovel is still in the grave and he doesn’t have any iron, and she laughs in his face. Cold hands wrap around his throat and go tight, and Dean gasps and struggles and kicks futilely at thin air.
“There’s our ticket out,” Dean announces, pointing like Castiel doesn’t have eyes because, hey, maybe he doesn’t yet. “You and me, we’re almost home.”
Dean tries his best to sound convincing, but he must fail. That, or angels can read minds or something. Because a soft feather brushes under Dean’s chin, pushing with surprising strength, and Dean finds himself being forced to lift his head until he’s pinned again by Castiel’s vivid eyes. They’re glowing now, a little bit, shining white-blue hot like the innards of a star and swirling with immense, ancient power, and it’s this, more than anything, that convinces Dean that he’s staring at an honest to God angel.
Castiel tilts his head, the movement rippling along his wings. He probably has that adorable squint of confusion on his face.
“Dean?” Castiel-the-one-time-roll-in-the-sack-Dean-accidentally-came-out-to says, blinking rapidly. “Is that . . . Is that you?”
“Oh, Dean,” the Shadow says, “I know bravado is your style, but that won’t work on me. Do you even know what I am?”
And the third thing Dean sees is a flash of light, angel-bright and too-painful, and when it fades, Castiel is standing there, trench coat and tie and all, gloriously and beautifully whole and alive.
Still, the column stabilizes after a moment, so Dean dutifully scoots closer and squints, trying to make out a face or some kind of landmark in the flames. Usually, if people are lucky and everything goes perfectly, they get a glimpse of their soulmate’s face. If they’re not so lucky, they might get an image of a place their soulmate’s been, or an impression of their voice, or something far less helpful.
Castiel purses his lips. He looks at Dean, eyes narrowed and focused, the same look Dean remembers from their one night stand, like he’s peering into Dean’s very soul, and he says, flatly, “No, thank you.”
“So, Jess,” Dean drawls, leaning back, “tell me how my gigantor brother worked up the nerve to ask you out. I know for a fact you’re way out of his league.
Sam’s grin grows to epic proportions. He slings a comfortable arm around Jess and says, “So, hey, I guess it means it’s your turn then. How’d you two meet?”
Castiel relaxes his hand and the blade vanishes. The demon opens his fist, and Dean wheezes as air streams into his lungs again.
They’re all too spooked to order pizza, but they do have ground beef in the freezer so Dean digs it out and whips up some burgers. Sam makes a prissy face, the health nut, but Jess gobbles it down with a steadiness that Dean admires, given that her entire world just expanded.
The Shadow’s entire body ripples. It points its hands at the floor – or whatever the eternal darkness below their feet is – and more shadowy tendrils bubble up from the floor. The ooze spreads and spreads, until the floor around Dean is shifting and undulating like the sea at night. More figures climb out of the ooze, one by one, until Dean is utterly surrounded on all sides by Castiel doppelgängers, each bearing malicious grins and blank eyes.
“With what?” Castiel asks. He sounds utterly exhausted, like he needs ten more hours of sleep, and even his hand movements are lethargic, not the precise elegance he usually displays.
The hunt starts off innocuously enough. There’s a town where people are going missing in droves and their families are reporting that they all went nuts beforehand: lashed out, showed inhuman strength, got weirdly obsessed over strange things like salt-free diets. One or two crazies going off their rocker is weird; seventeen and counting means something supernatural is afoot.
But it’s too late; with his concentration on Dean again and with the other demons having trampled all over the angel trap, the psychic hold on Castiel is broken and Castiel takes full advantage. Castiel yanks his arms free and sends both demons flying head over heels; he snaps his wings together and the demon at his back hits the ground. And then, just as the first demon is realizing his mistake, Castiel turns burning eyes on him and starts marching forward, every inch the avenging angel coming to cleanse the earth.
,” Castiel repeats, and he’s not just glowing, he’s vibrating with energy that crackles all up and down his wings and torso. An awful, high pitched ringing sound splits the air and Dean cringes, curling in on himself, tucking his face into his knees and covering his ears with his hand as Castiel goes nuclear on the demons.
That’s when Dean realizes that the monster isn’t glowing; Castiel is, and he’s basically burning the monster alive.
“Or,” Jess says loudly, slapping them both upside the head, “we could sit and talk like civilized adults.”
, Dean’s angel who burns monsters and ghosts at the snap of his fingers, Dean’s partner who stares down belligerent sheriffs without breaking a sweat, Dean’s soulmate whose fighting is poetry with blade and fists?
“And now,” Castiel says when Dean stares at him with accusing eyes, “you cannot run. You can, however, get off the bed. Is this acceptable?”
The feeling of being watched shifts, a little bit. It’s like a tiny tug in his gut. It feels a bit like sadness.
Castiel presses his hand to the wound and Dean squeezes his eyes shut – but nothing happens. At least, no pain. Definitely no smiting. Instead, that same warmth that’s a shade too hot fills Dean, as if he’s being covered in Castiel’s wings, seeping into his chest from the wound where Castiel is touching him.
Dean musters up all his strength – the strength that carried him against Azazel and against Lucifer and against God himself – and says, “Watch me.”
Castiel rears back, confusion written all over his face. “This vessel cannot contain an angel and a demon,” he says. “My grace would destroy you in an instant.”
Castiel actually honest-to-God rolls his eyes. And not a normal people roll your eyes either, no, he literally tilts his whole head upwards like he’s receiving revelation from angels or something. “Fingerprints, Dean,” he repeats, sounding exasperated. “You are excellent at destroying monsters’ remains and destroying evidence of supernatural beings at crime scenes. You are not so excellent at destroying evidence that ties you to said crime scenes.”
“Dude, you just burned a monster’s eyes out with that same bright light, how was I supposed to know?”
For some reason, Dean’s mind snags on the “kill any monster” part. He narrows his eyes, because angels sure as hell haven’t been killing monsters in the past or else Dean and everybody else would have seen them. So if Castiel is going to kill them now. . . “You’re planning to follow me around everywhere, aren’t you?”
Dean edges away, eyeing the window. They’re on the second floor, but it’s not that big of a gap. Dean can probably make it. “I, uh, you know it was a one night kind of thing right?” he laughs nervously. “I don’t really – I don’t do long term stuff. You know.”
Castiel rolls his eyes and rolls his shoulders like he’s working a kink out of them, and then the entire room spins dizzily around them. Dean finds himself suddenly not in his chair anymore, but flat on his back on the bed, out of breath, with Castiel perched on top of him, warm and beautiful and smug as a cat that got the canary.
“I am an angel of the Lord,” Castiel reminds him. “I can fly faster than you can see, I can speak any human language, and I can kill almost any monster you will ever encounter. Healing you is but a small feat of the power at my disposal.”
. Dean curses and fires a second and third time, but the creature dodges the second bullet and is basically on top of him by the third.
Somehow, this question offends Castiel more than the two before it. His wings flare wide and high, like a predator trying to scare off a competitor, and now that the sun is fully shining down upon the clearing, Dean can truly make out the finer details of his wings: the feathers, some as long as his arm and some as long as his leg; the colors, shimmering and shifting in a way that escapes description; and the way they so effortlessly hold still or move on a dime, without any effort on Castiel’s part.
“Yeah, yeah, I think we get the picture,” Dean interrupts hastily, because Jess and Sam are staring deeply into each other’s eyes at this point, and he draws the line at seeing a reenactment right now. “Save it for the wedding, lovebirds.”
Unfortunately, that leaves Dean with the very fun task of knocking on the doors of everyone who was staying at the motel where the third dead body turned up. He’s really not looking forward to it.
One downside of Castiel sharing a bed with him: he sometimes starts super deep conversations when Dean is half asleep. Probably because he knows Dean is more likely to blurt out the truth. Because he knows Dean like that.
