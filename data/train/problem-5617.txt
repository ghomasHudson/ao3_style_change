“Steve harder, please harder.” He knows it is futile to beg but he can’t help it.
He knew he wasn't too far away from a time where he would call Steve just to hear his voice.
“I’ll do whatever you want Tony. Just don’t stop loving me.”
They have shared laughter and dances. They have spent hours under the stars, just talking. Tony has seen Steve at his weakest, sobbing due to the nightmares that have plagued him since the war. Steve has comforted Tony when the man felt burdened by the weight of his name and position. Tony has been inside him, so deep Steve wished he’d stay. If all this wasn’t enough for Tony to love him then the alpha never will. It hurts, this knowledge, the fact that Tony likes him but doesn’t care for him.
Circular. And Tony really saw no way out of this maze.
The very thought made Steve’s heart ache in a way that hadn’t happened in years. Not since that fateful day.
Steve nodded at that so Tony continued.
“Shut up Steve.” He turns to go in, hoping that the alpha would leave but then Steve says something that just sucker punches him.
Tony stops this rambling apology and gets right to the heart of the matter, “if I matter so much to you why didn’t you call or text. Why did you just leave? Why didn’t you fight for me?”
“Well, you wouldn’t happen to know anything about that strange blue light, would you? The stranger said sardonically. “Because it flashed right where you were standing and it was strange. I thought I saw some people and bright lights, but it was contained in only a sphere. So trust me when I say I would believe anything you say right now.” The man’s eyes twinkled and that decided it for Tony.
Oh boy, was Tony in big trouble.
Captain Steve Rogers had a problem. Okay, it was not actually a problem just something that baffles him. Tony, for some strange reason, had taken to sleeping almost naked. He had not told Steve what prompted this but Steve could guess. He knew it was a move designed to entice him. To tempt him into giving in to his urges.
He goes back out and sees a small crowd at the foot of the stairs. He moves closer to see the reason for the commotion and sees Bucky, cutting a handsome figure in his clothes, obviously buff and built under all that finery.
“I’m sorry, Steve I didn’t mean that, you know I didn’t mean that.” Steve was regaining colour but he still looked miffed.
So Steve feels like a fool.
Later when he was laid up in bed, he wondered what he would do now. It seemed like there was nothing he could do, no way to move forward. It was circular in a way. Tony loved Steve, it seemed like Steve loved Tony. But Tony could not forgive Steve.
Turning towards him, he said, “Steve, I love spending time with you. You are so sweet and earnest. I would love it if you would accept the offer I am about to make. I would like for you to be my companion. I would provide you with a lavish townhouse, clothes, a carriage and servants to do your bidding. I loved what we just did now and I know you did too. So I hope you will say yes.”
And really, that was his biggest mistake.
Tony got up abruptly and went to the windows, from where he could see all of Manhattan. Steve got up and came to stand behind him but understood Tony's unsaid need for space and kept his distance.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve smiles too, remembering his misbegotten youth.
“Baby I’m pregnant.” At first Steve didn’t understand what his omega just said. But once it sank in pleasure shot up and down his body and then the low pooling heat became a crescendo and he came inside Tony. Filling him to the brim.
They met regularly. Tony could tell Steve hated not being in Stark tower. He hated not having his alpha around him too but they had to work hard to regain their footing with each other.
Steve, on the other hand, had nothing to offer Tony. It wouldn’t be a fight at all. Even now, he could feel the man pull away from him a little.
This time though, this time, the science didn’t come. What came was tears and snot. What came was punching a mirror. What came was the desire to go crawling back to his alpha.
So he said it, “I’m glad you’re not off, getting killed in a stupid war.”
And when he finally enters Steve, they both pant and shudder at the feeling.
He is a fool.
Concrit is most definitely welcome.
Tony looks like he is ready to murder someone. As Steve stops next to Tony his hand is snatched up and he announces that they are leaving. Steve barely has time to say his goodbyes to his friend and Lord Rhodes before he is dragged away.
“You don’t. It’s a leap of faith Tony. Whatever you choose to do will require courage which you have.”
It was funny, if he thought about it real hard, how life could change in a second. He had such dreams when he was a kid or when he was a teen. He’d thought he would marry some handsome and kind alpha, take care of his cottage, and raise their children.
Steve gives him such a flat look that Tony actually giggles.
“And I told you I had to do it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh my love, you deserve to be spoiled.” His heart should stop stuttering at endearments like that, Tony used them liberally and with everyone. “But I am not doing this for your benefit; I am doing this for mine. The prettier you look the faster I want to tear off those clothes off of you.” Tony said with a salacious grin.
Basically abject misery.
“Stevie, look at me. You have to look and smile and pretend that you are enjoying this. How else will you win this battle, my friend?”
To sum up, the alpha was stunning and arrogant to boot.  And yet, Steve felt his heartbeat just a little faster and his palms started sweating.
Usually, his method of mending a broken heart meant an engineering binge that culminated in a truly inspiring piece of technology. He could still recall, with pride if he might add, the epic binge after Sunset Bain left with some of his plans for future products; he came up with a new line of Stark Prosthetics
“Oh baby doll you are so wet? Is this all for me?” he croons. Steve licks his lips and Tony follows the movement. Then he removes his fingers and before Tony has a chance to complain he picks up a pillow and makes the omega lie stomach down on it.
That was one of the bright stars in this dark night. His friends would come back and he would host them in his house. They had fought for years together before Tony had forbidden him from fighting. He missed those days, just him, the Howling Commandos and Bucky.
That's the truth and it warmed his heart.
Life chugged along. Tony found work to do. Turns out his brain for business worked the same no matter the era. Steve was astonished to hear that Tony owned and ran his own business, “an omega running his own enterprise? Is that allowed in the future?” Rolling his eyes at the comment, Tony pointed out the problem areas in Steve's account books. That mollified Steve and after that, they went over his work every week.
“What are you doing?” How is Steve angry at him? He is the reason Tony is writhing on the bed with no help and no alpha.
Foolish of him really.
Resigned to his fate, he got off the bed and straightened himself; it wouldn’t do good to look frazzled.
He knew the only way to get an answer; talk to Steve.
Time travel is funny sometimes.
But Tony didn’t know how to explain that to Pepper. He also didn't know how to verbalise that without Steve he couldn’t breathe properly. He couldn’t sleep. He couldn’t live. He didn’t want Steve. He needed him.
Tony feels like tearing his hair out but he keeps clutching the pillow. Soon he is suffused with a warm feeling and is near delirious with want. It's building up and it won't be long now.
Then late one night Tony had come to meet him, looking bedraggled and sleep-deprived. He had told Steve that he was afraid for him and wouldn’t be able to live with himself if he let the omega go to war. Steve had relented and stayed. The alpha had arranged for him to test weapons out in the Stark factory. It wasn’t a perfect solution but at least he had something to do.
He stares the alpha for a long time, too long, and wonders if he can trust all this.
Steve looked shell-shocked at this admission but then his expression changed.
Grateful for this chance to escape, he acquiesces and is lead to the dance floor.
His first heat without Steve was brutal. It has been two months since Steve left and Tony was miserable as ever. He had hoped that the alpha would have called him by now but there was radio silence. By this time he was sure that Steve was happy about the break-up. The ‘no you move’ man not being stubborn about it was a pretty big clue.
“I would tell you sir, but you wouldn’t believe me.” Tony decided that being polite was his best option right now.
If you guys have any suggestions for anything in this fic do tell me because I love to hear different ideas.
So he dialed Steve’s number and he picked up in two rings.
Mind made up he and Bucky continue dancing, talking about the Howling Commandos. Soon Bucky is making him laugh by telling him a story of how they spent an entire day fooling Morita into thinking his bag had a hole by stealing his things.
Steve snapped his head back to Bucky, unsure what he was talking about.
He had always dreamed of meeting someone like Tony. Someone who would choose to be with Steve every day, choose to commit to him in every way.
“I have never beaten up alphas.”
“Steve, you know you can’t really inherit until you marry Victoria. So please throw out your whore and do the right thing.”
Shout at me to write faster or ask me questions, like I would die if you do that.
Hours later he got home somehow and just face planted in their... his bed and went to sleep.
”And then... then he just launches at Dum Dum and they both fall to the ground and are wrestling while the rest of us are cheering them on.”
“The team is currently in Central Park, still fighting the doombots. Would you like me to relay a message to Captain Rogers, informing him of your heat?” Intoned the cool British voice.
And that the real reason why Tony is so sad, Steve always promised that he would fight for their love but obviously not.
He knew he was stuck in the past. That was his reality now and there was no way to change that fact. What was he supposed to do now? It was night time. He had no money and nothing to barter. The next window would open in half a year. At least he had his tech with him. If he were completely free of it, then he would have felt really powerless.
Steve is so overjoyed at this that he asks where Bucky had served in the war. Soon he, Bucky, and Lord Rhodes are comparing stories about the war. And Tony's face is getting darker with anger with each passing second. But he doesn’t leave. He keeps standing there and then suddenly an arm sneaks in to hold Steve by the waist, and quite tightly at that.
“I am not leaving, never again. I can’t live without you, Tony. I don’t know why I was stupid enough to stay away. And I don’t know how I didn’t spend every waking minute making you feel as loved as you deserve. I love you.”
Steve gets up dejectedly, "call me, please. I am yours forever, please believe me when I say that."
The past two years had been idyllic, if he chose to forget the obvious, with the pair meeting almost every day. Tony had given him a townhouse where Sam and Natasha lived with him. He had servants to do his every bidding, fine clothes, and jewels that befitted the station of Tony's lover and his friends so he’d be less lonely. He was still in the army but Tony’s influence meant he wasn’t sent to war. This edict had caused their biggest fight to date. Steve had wanted to fight, His feelings for tony be damned, and it was what he was trained for, what he wanted to do in his life. Tony, however, wasn’t ready to relent and they hadn’t talked to each other for a week after that.
While Tony could tell that Steve wanted to go all in, he ensured that he followed whatever schedule the omega set for them. They started small, weekly coffee dates. It was extremely awkward at first. Not because they didn’t know each other or didn’t know the appropriate behaviour. It was awkward because when two people love each other deeply and completely, it is hard for them to suppress it. it is hard for them to pretend. Hard for them to not exhibit their feelings.
But saying all that would make Pepper think they were co-dependent. And that wasn't true. He didn't need Steve in his life because he couldn't live without the man. He probably could. But he didn't want to live without how Steve made him feel. He felt safe, loved and cherished with the alpha. He was a better person with Steve. He knew that he made Steve feel the same way.
After packing off his aunt when she insulted Tony, Steve had decided that they would go to London to see its wonders. For Tony who has been cooped up in the English countryside for too long, it is a treat.
Then why did it feel like someone had gripped his heart tight and crushed it where it beat. He felt like he was bleeding out. If he was honest with himself, and he tried to be, he had always expected Tony to fall in love with him like he loved the alpha. He was waiting for Tony to catch up and then they would live together. They would share his heat and then Steve would swell up with their first child and they would live happily.
Their plan hit a snag as they rarely got any chances to try for their future baby. And what little time they spent together was not nearly enough for anything to happen, what with the Avengers, Stark Industries, SHEILD, and a million other reasons.
All alone, unable to handle the touch of any other alpha but Steve.

"Right,"Tony hisses through his teeth momentarily, turning his head to the right to look out of the grand window that stretches from ceiling to floor, wall to wall and overlooks the Hudson River. JARVIS is right, of course, the weather is miserable and Tony frowns at the sight of angry clouds and a greyed river so early in the morning."Do I have anything else planned for the day?"
Peggy hadn't came. Tony didn't expect it either, or maybe, he had, clinging to a hope and a dream that she hadn't forgotten about her old life and too busy with her new one to even spare the likes of Jarvis a second thought. He had thought more of her, but only because she was held on a much higher ground than any other role model in his life, and maybe that's Tony's fault for being so naive. Or Howard's fault for being so abusive. Or Maria's fault for being so neglectful. Or Peggy's fault being so absent. Or Jarvis' fault for being so fucking
Tony arrives 47 minutes later, 17 minutes later than he had told Strange and 13 before he had expected himself to actually arrive at the door of an office that only ever hosts the occupants of Doctor Stephen Strange and Doctor Tony Stark. Which, by the way, is not some type of alias that Tony had magicked up for himself in order to fit in with the professionalism that he often surrounded himself in, but was one that he earned through one of his countless degrees on the way of becoming the best of the best of the best.
"I swear I saw him sniff at her lab coat in chemistry today and tear up a bit."
"I don't like him."
"Barely."Her scoff is watery.
"Yeah, I normally spend it with my friend and his family. My mum will be working, but it's all good fun and she normally gets off in time for desert."Steve smiles sadly. He would love for his Christmas to be family filled, for him to spend the entire day with his mum but she has to work and Steve doesn't blame her for doing so."What about you? Will your parents come up and spend the day with you?"
"Rhodey."Tony gives a tight smile of relief, his hands reaching out for Rhodey whenever the older man is in distance, grabbing at his hands. There's a look of concern washed over Rhodey's face, a look in his eyes that tells Tony they'll talk more later.
"Look, I'll do your work and I'll fly you over. Free food? And free drink?"Tony tries to bargain, swiping his free hand across the screen of the prototype tablet to bring it to life.
him and even worse the type of people that do only want to get to know him so they can have access to SI secrets and maybe a piece of Tony's little body while they're at it.
Or worse still; that his friends like him.
and study. You're barely passing at least 5 of your subjects."
look. The type of look that can make even the biggest of men crumble under such an intense stare - and as much as Natasha is his best friend, Clint is fucking frightened of her.
"I've been looking everywhere for you. You'd dashed so quickly from the dinning room that I didn't know where you went."Rhodey explains, giving Tony's hands a squeeze, looking between Tony and Obi."And who are you?"
. Flutter the eyelashes a bit, get the waterworks going, that usually works, right?"
He had noticed it in the way she walked, her foot steps were off, the click of her heels were not equal, the way her knees were buckled and not straight, a bit slouched. Things only Tony would notice. He saw it in the way she hadn't a clipboard, or notes, or pages spilling out of heavy books as she usually balanced a cup of coffee on top. He saw it in the way a hair was out of place in her bun, how a ginger hair was swept over her forehead, stuck to clamming skin. Worried, concerned,
Steve has been over since early this morning, not too early for the Barnes family to open their presents - since that's one thing Steve doesn't want to be apart of. It's a family tradition and no matter how long he has known the Barnes or how many times Mrs Barnes tells him he's family, he doesn't want to intrude - but early enough that he was there on time for breakfast. French Toast with Maple Syrup and cream.
"Only half? That's lame. Did you feel that okay? Scale from 1 to 10."Tony ask after poking at an area of flesh that remains as part of Bucky's shoulder with a pen.
' but the more rational, levelheaded part of Tony stands his ground and motions his hand in the vague direction of the waiting room, watching as Steve nods his head at Dr Strange in acknowledgment and turns to follow orders.
Because then it becomes real, much how it became real to see him int he flesh, standing and talking and moving his hands as he spoke, for his chest to rise with every breathe, for that Arc Reactor to glow that continuous blue that reminded everyone that he was still alive. That was real, that was something that actually happened, and Steve is still in awe of it so. And goddamnit, does he feel 17 again and flustered and angered.
. I know everything about you,
- because in retrospect, he actually
"If my mom doesn't know who you are, don't be offended. She can barely remember that I'm her son half of the time."Tony warns, elbows hooked with Rhodey's as they walk down the staircase together, dressed in their matching crisp suits and styled to perfection by a hired stylist. He can hear the clink of champagne flutes and the chatter from the main rooms, causing his palms to sweat.
The kitchen is quiet as Steve enters after his nap, ready to grab himself a bottle of water from the fridge before waiting out on the front porch for Bucky to pick him up in Natasha's car to sign up. His mom is already there, sitting at the kitchen table about to go to work but willing to wait for her son to make an appearance, a last minute intervention.
."Bucky snarks, something childish about his tone of voice as he stalks behind Steve. The blond doesn't even resist the urge to roll his eyes as he crouches to open the washing machine to put on the load.
"You're early."Steve notes but he doesn't seem annoyed by the fact, instead the smile only seems to get bigger and Tony curses the fact that he can feel his face beaten with a blush to know that he's the possible reason behind that smile.
It's no later and no less than 10 minutes when his phone is lighting up with a text so brief that Steve is glad that Clint taught him how to read 'text' codes or else he would've had no clue on what it was that Tony had texted him. It's a couple of miles out but Steve doesn't mind, he can run it, he's ran longer and he'll run it for Tony.
And fuck, isn't he a beautiful sight? With his soft naturally blonde hair and beautiful crystal blue eyes that Tony could get lost in if he stared for to much. There's not a cut or mark on Steve's face, bruising and stitches haven't healed from his last fight and not even a blemish on his smooth porcelain skin.
"And you've ate..."
"Would coffee help?"
"I don't care, but Stevie does."James is bringing the burning cigarette up to his lips, inhaling and exhaling the smoke into the crisp cold air as he side eyes Tony. The smaller teenager looks so fragile beside him, a shivering shoulders compared to Bucky's broad ones, overly large jumper in compassion to his tight shirt.
"Explain that to my test subjects and their full stomachs!"Tony is snatching the screwdriver out of Dumm-E's claw, shooing the 'bot to his charging station and dumping the screwdriver into a passing tool kit.
, whether he realises that or not. This isn’t his first uncomfortable gathering.”With that, Natasha is getting up from beside Steve and is flicking on the television from the mains, leaving Steve frowning behind the TV, eyes watching the way that Tony’s eyes crinkle as he cackles at something that Thor has just muttered into his ear.
"It is so fucking beautiful."Clint whispers in awe, wide eyed at Tony who shrugs his shoulders, going to dig around in the pockets of his jeans for the car keys, throwing them at the blonde with a shrug and a smile.
Steve's neighbour is straight out of day time television show. The houses are almost so similar if it wasn't for the difference in cars, the colour of doors or what's in their front lawn, and the hosted are fairly small from the outside but Tony expects them to be larger on the inside. But they're nice, the homes actually look like
"I didn't, but I'm working on improving the element. Research shows that paladium in the long run give off more bad news than good news which isn't helpful in my age."
"It's like talking to a fucking brick wall."Rhodey whispers to himself, throwing his pencil across the room as he pushes himself out of his chair. It's not as if he doesn't want to see Tony - because by god he does, as much as that boy does his head in sometimes, he brings entertainment to his life and gives him a reason of protectiveness - he doesn't want to deal with brining his news to his mom about getting up and leaving before University even starts back up.
"I may have nearly died but that does
because Steve could be 40, married with children and working his dream job but Sarah Rogers has every right to have an opinion and say on his life. Steve is her only child, her son, her baby, her pride and joy because everyone knows that the reason Sarah has worked so hard in her life is to give Steve the best life as possible and that she sees none of her wages for herself.
From the moment he was walking and talking, Steve always felt as if he
"No we're not."James seems to flare up in offence, his shoulders squared and jaw set at the accusation that Tony has just made.
It had taken Bruce a criminal amount of time to finish his course in comparison to his intellectual counterpart, whose money and natural charm had been a gift to allow Tony to finish earlier, despite the fact that their intellectual abilities were on par to one another. Tony knew this, of course, Bruce had simply just assumed that Tony had been smarter.
Tony is ducking around the curtain just as quickly as those words tumble out of this mouth, almost stumbling away from the curtained cubical and into the hallway that he had came, wanting to escape the suffocating atmosphere that was the inclosed cubical and it's occupants. Steve's eyes had bored into his skull as he spoke, Tony could feel the stare of those blue eyes, of how his eyebrows had scrunched together, how his lips had pursed, how his expression was one of wanting to speak his mind and apologise in that moment. And that's without even looking at him.
"It's supposed to make that sound, Y'know."Steve can't help but to laugh, the concern still relevant in his voice but laced with a sort of fondness that seems to wipe right over Tony's head. The teenager blindly reaches out for this glasses that rest on the hospital side table. Steve rushes to grab them to aid Tony, handing them to the teenager who thanks him silently with a nod."The beeping is to tell people that your heart is still beating and that you're
The room spins for a moment or two, but eventually settles enough to allow Tony to make the distance from the living area to the stairs, eyes scanning over empty bottles, plastic Cubs, confetti, articles of clothing and garage that litters the floors, furniture, draped over chairs and banisters. Jarvis would go nuts if he saw the state of Stark House and his mother would have been dragged by the ear.
And so, Steve would shake himself off, preserver because then he would be reminded that there were a lot bigger problems in this world than Steve's desert dry love life, or the fact that he's still pinning after a man no Steve hadn't heard from in years. He has had heard so much about him, however, especially upon the announcement of the gracious Stark Insurance that newly entrusted Tony Stark had established for the men and women fighting for America's front, a gesture to wave over the gossip of where or who exactly Stark Weapons was being manufactured for had begun to appear.
."Steve glares at everyone but especially at Tony for dragging along the conversation. Tony just shrugs his shoulders and snickers into his can of soda because when Steve tries and acts all father like it's actually kind of amusing."And the reason why nobody remembered Hitler as an artist is because he couldn't even draw a stickman."
"Thanks but no thanks."Tony declines blankly, pushing Ty's wondering hands off of his body as he turns sharply on his heel, heading back in the direction that he came in with his head held high and his legs moving fast.
Usually sleeping in Steves house is Bucky's place of escape, it's always a lot quieter than living in a household filled with younger little sisters and a mom that won't get off his back about this and that. Steves house has always been his place of escape, a place where he can sleep without being woken up by fingers jabbing at his sides for him to help with his little sisters maths problems and a place where he can freely eat whatever is in the fridge without being swatted or f the kitchen by his mom or judged on his eating habits.
Whatever happened on this weekend, it has left Stark House in an awful state, the house far away from its immaculate portrayal and now left behind as if struck by a hurricane. There are bottles of all sorts of alcohol littering the wooden floors, broken glass on marble counter tops, rips in expensive leather couches and what smells like Tony's usual scent of weed, alcohol and sex.
It happens too quickly, because before Tony can speak again, demand where he is, who was this person peeling at his eyelids and talking way too sweetly is, Tony is falling into another bout of dreamless slumber almost instantly.
were the one that came into my hospital room,
you to stay."Steve stresses, a little annoyed with the way that Tony's face falls into set, lips pursed and eyes narrowed at the much bigger teenager.
"I'm not-"
"I get out a lot, actually."Tony dryly chuckles, hands scrunching into fists inside of the pockets of his hoodie. Tony stood like some sort of bandit on the run, dressed in joggers, a hoodie and a pair of Amber tinted sunglasses rested on the bridge of his nose. It was for comfort, and maybe also because he didn't want to deal with people today or have people question why Tony Stark was hanging with Steve Rogers outside of the tower.
He had to go and see the man.
He had no future except whatever Tony chose to provide him with.
He took a deep breath and plunged in. He looked up at Steve and those eyes he loved were intensely staring at him. He sat there rigid and unmoving, as though waiting for a terrible blow.
And with that outpouring, he knows that it is becoming too much for him. He needs room to breathe and think.
(See the end of the chapter for
Two weeks ago the love of his life walked out on him. No biggie. He had dealt with worse in the past and came out stronger. But he was unwilling to sit in that fucking house, haunted by memories of better times. He just had to avoid staying there during nights.
“Steve you made me feel like you didn’t love me. That you were just waiting for a chance to leave. I was about to propose bonding and then you do this. Why was I not enough for you?” Saying this all to Steve felt good. Cleansing in a way.
“Tony, I didn’t want to burden you, I didn’t want to put those horrors on you.”
“That isn’t enough Steve, I had months to think about this and I came to the conclusion that you don’t love me like I love you.”
To put it simply, Steve was worth it. The alpha was proving that to him every day.
And tempted he was.
Here comes the other point that caused all this mess. “Do you really think I am needy and clingy?” Tony had obsessed over this so much. He couldn’t get it out of his head that the reason for Steve’s departure was that Tony was too much. Demanded too much of his time and energy.
Possibly too ruined for Steve too.
Steve.
“Good evening, Mr. Rogers. I hope the company of soft lords and ladies instead of the soldiers is acceptable to you.” Lord Stark said, bowing to him and showing him the respect a soldier deserved. Instead of treating him like an omega.
“Nothing is too expensive for you, my love, you are the most beautiful thing of mine and I would have bathed you in jewels if I could.” There was a strange intensity in Tony’s eyes and his voice sounded hoarse. Shaking his head he said, “And anyway your clothes are too drab, you look like you’re going to a funeral, not a ball. So you will wear these clothes when we go out and your beauty will make all the young debutantes seethe with jealousy.
"You do know you don't have to sleep here, Y'know. You have a perfectly good house across the fucking road."Steve mutters, fingers moving on the keyboard of his flip phone to type out a message to Tony, adding to the string of unanswered messages that he has already sent. The phone is so small inbetween Steves hands, and Bucky would laugh at the situation if he wasn't so damn pissed off.
But if he phoned you up right this minute and asked for you to come to him, or for him to come to you, you'd fucking do it, and you know you would, because you're naive and gullible and this guy could be anyone, for fuck sake!"
for the remaining occupants of the house.  Maybe it was different when Tony was little, where there was a Nanny that tended to his every boo-boo and numerous tutors that taught Little Tony Stark the Ins and Outs of mathematics. Now, the house barely consisted off Howard and Maria.
"I made you pancakes."
"A free evening, huh. I haven't had one of those in a long while."Tony muses, taking another sip of his coffee. He hasn't had a free evening since...since... Tony isn't exactly sure. It was probably the last time Rhodey was off duty and that had to be over a year ago. He smiles faintly, it had been great to spend time with Rhodey, he doesn't get to see him a lot but when he does, it's like they were never apart.
Being at the the hospital, the only time he does sleep is when that damn blonde nurse comes in to give him his pain relief medication - and Tony swears that she gives him Roofies in his night time water - which makes him loose consciousness not even 5 minutes later.
"She left a week ago, he can't be that upset."Bucky looks at her in disbelief.
"You look terrible,"
"Oh stop fighting, we all know that you'd die for Clint."Natasha is suddenly in the kitchen, perched on a chair and Tony has to fight away the reaction to flinch at the new, unexpected voice. Her talk may be towards Phil but she's looking directly at Tony and the stare suddenly makes Tony feel very small.
He was introduced to Thor first who seems like a decent guy, even if he does talk like there's a megaphone stuck in his throat and seems to have no personal space boundaries. But it was good, Tony didn't want to meet anyone would be dancing around him, unsure what to say and Thor didn't seem like the guy that would anyway.
"I haven't seen you in an awful long time, Tony. Quite frankly, I heard you were sent to that Rehab clinic in Connecticut, y'know the one, where you have your own room?"
"Bucky hates parties."
"Well, we sure weren't boyfriends. So what was I, hmm? A whore, a slut, a slag, a tramp?"Tony lists off the words that he has heard to be recited back at him over the years, name tags that have stuck, wrapped around a cord around his neck.
speech, but it's basically the same."A weird sort of smile seems to ghost Tony's lips when he talks about Rhodey, even just thinking about all of the death threat talks that he's gave to so many people in the short time that he and Tony have became best friends.
and I'm not allowing you to waltz after me, trying to start an argument when moments ago you were trying to fucking apologise. Make up your mind. Do you want to argue, or do you want to apologise?"
"Would you?"Tony gasps, sitting up urgently which tugs at the wires of his heart monitor and the IV drip in his hand. The screw driver - and the extra screws that Tony had taken out of the monitor and then had no idea where to put it - laying on the blanket beside Tony.
"I get it wasn't even fur,"
Because then it becomes real, much how it became real to see him int he flesh, standing and talking and moving his hands as he spoke, for his chest to rise with every breathe, for that Arc Reactor to glow that continuous blue that reminded everyone that he was still alive. That was real, that was something that actually happened, and Steve is still in awe of it so. And goddamnit, does he feel 17 again and flustered and angered.
Steve on the other hand lived in the Great Depression, He was a Brooklyn kid and it didn't take no genius to guess that at times he didn't have two Dee to rub together never mind actually spend it on luxuries. Steve had spent half of his childhood being knocked down by even the slightest if the common cold and the other half tending to his mother, He had those neutering instincts knitted into his DNA with or without the Serum.
to look after every person he met, despite the fact that he started off in life as a sickly babe who could be blown over by the slightest of colds. He developed, just like anybody else, and with that so did his need to look after his friends, his mother and anyone he thought needed his help.
"Have I ever been on your side? Last time I checked, I'm a neutral."Because last time Clint almost ended up in jail, but that isn't anything new.
"What do you want."His voice is a murmur, barely a whisper and lips still touching, but the growing smirk that rises on Obie's lips is clear enough that he heard Tony. They brush over Tony's payment in exchange for Obie's clean up and then he's leaving, rubbing his thumb I've Tony's high cheekbones and brushing off the knees of his suit before leaving Tony in the rubble that is his own mess.
. His voice still rings in Steve's head even know, as he finds himself back at home, away from the constant voices of fellow peers and worried glances from friends who don't know the meaning of personal space and boundaries, cloaked in the darkness of his bedroom where curtains are drawn shut and his bed is freshly made. Tony's name still floats behind his eyes when he closes them, his voice ringing in his ears, his touch on his skin, his scent lingered on places he touched months ago.
"Yes."He sucks in a sharp breath, hands now found napkins to fiddle with, twisting the tissue fabric, tearing it into little pieces of chunks until it's a confetti on his lap and until the tissue is gone and he's reaching for another, out of nerves, out of anxiety because he doesn't know what else to say and he doesn't really want to speak but he doesn't want to leave because he needs to be around
"You're...a lot."James Barnes says cautiously as if he was taking the time to find the right word to use about Tony who has seemed to burst into the room as if it was his dramatic stage entrance of opening night of a play.
"Clint, sit down and leave Steve the fuck alone."Natasha orders.
to call his son. If it wasn't for the brain in his head, Howard would've thrown Tony out onto the streets the moment that he could. Tony swallows thickly, meeting those familiar shade of brown eyes, a face of his own looking back at him because he can deny it all he wants but he looks like Howard and it's unmistakable.
James 'Rhodey' Rhodes was the closest being that Tony has ever had as a brother, a best friend and God did Tony love the guy a lot. He was on Tony Starks very very very short list of people that he adored - also on the list being Jarvis, Anna, his Mom and Aunt Peggy - and believe me, not a lot of people made that list.
"You were invited, and I'm
"I know. Purple is so
"Why not?"Steve pushes for an answer, but he keeps his tone of voice mellow and his volume down, watching Tony's fidgeting hands that keep moving and fingers that keel twirling around the string of the dirty hoodie.
"You do it for the heavy pay check, don't try and act like you have my best interests at heart."Because if Obie has his way, and Tony knows this to a tee, he would have thrown Tony under the bus a long time ago, grasped at his opportunity to have his surname beside the word Industries instead of
Clint is flapping his free hand around as he talks, scrunching up his face and puts on a mocking voice. "Sure I'm
Which is odd. Because it's not like Tony doesn't like the extra affection and friendship, because he does, it just doesn't settle with Tony in a sorta guilty way. Tony knows why, he knows it's because Tony feels guilty that Steve doesn't know the real him, that he doesn't know of the money that he had stashed in his savings accounts or the empire company that he'll inherit whenever Howard dies - and Obi as well.
"O' course I can 'ear you,"Tony's words come out muttered, slurred and almost sounding as if he as confused because he is, in some sort of way because he has no idea what has happened or where he is or why his mouth feels like a bunch of cotton balls have been stuffed in his mouth, making him seem unable to speak correctly without him sounding like he has just had a stroke."You won' shut up."
."Bruce smirks, pushing Clint further into the house before Phil, Bucky and Steve all freeze to death outside. Clint lets out a whine, stumbling further into the house and towards the family room where a tray of hot chocolate and a bag of marshmallows are placed on the coffee table.
"You really have to stop with the snappiness, Rogers."Tony lets out a laugh, stretching his limbs and letting out a groan whenever he feels a couple of his bones crack and his muscles stretch."But if I have to have another friend, I'm glad that you are them."He smiles, once that was small but genuine and made Steve smile Back.
"There will be
It must've been bad because Steve can still remember the way in which Bucky had looked at him, talked to him as if he was a child who had just witnessed something tremendously awful like pulling on the cats tail or drawing a crude picture on the wall. He can still remember how, as he left, everyone who remained in his barracks had refused to make eye contact with him, shied away at his wondering eye, questioning look, nod of a head.
"Look after yourself."Rhodeys reflection appears in the window, standing behind Tony in a way that the male lead of a romantic comedy would then embrace the female lead during their tragic downfall. Tony scoffs, rolling his eyes and turning away from the rain stained window to look at Rhodey.
You could say that this, Tony getting into trouble, started when he was young and it just seemed to get worse as he got older. It started with the simplest of things, stealing a cookie when Jarvis wasn't looking or maybe hiding Anna's purse whenever she left it in the kitchen, and okay, you could say that was Tony being Tony, a boy just being a boy. It was when he got older, started school, graduated high school and got into MIT that his trouble really started to alert everyone.
Because Tony never really grew out of that habit of falling asleep in the workshop, finding his head rested on big yellow files marked
And Steve knows, he knows of all of the consequences that come with going to war, he knows that it's a lot bigger than just looking out for the little guy, because he's not just doing that now, he's looking out for himself, for a team, for a country, for his mom and friends back home. The more he thinks of it, the more frightened he becomes, but he's so much more than fear, because he wants to fight for his country, he wants to be loyal and respectful, he wants to give back and he's not going to do that if he's just sitting at home.
But when he turns he sees Steve is crying too. And then Tony looks deeper and sees the bags under his eyes and the dishevelled appearance, and knows that the alpha has been going through a tough time.
Tony and Steve didn’t know how not to be a couple. It was like they fell in together, as a couple, naturally. Steve didn’t know how to stop himself from kissing his omega. Tony didn’t understand how he was supposed to stop himself from taking his alpha’s hand in his.
“We’ll go to couples counseling. That’s non-negotiable.”
Steve turned and ranback to his room.
Steve was aware of the looks he got from the members of the Ton. Envy from the young and unmated omegas, anger from their old mothers, and disgust from their stately fathers. His only friends were Duke Rhodes and Earl Banner. Everyone else generally ignored him, until Tony was standing next to him. Tony's position as one of the most powerful dukes in the kingdom made sure that no one was ever rude to Steve to his face. They needed Tony's business too much to care about his mistress.
Forgetting all about the life they had planned together.
Tony is now in the middle of the bed, with his ass in the air and if he isn’t filled with alpha cock in the next few seconds, he is sure he will start crying. His body feel s overheated and he just wants something inside him.
Lady Virginia Potts.
Everything was alright.
“If I love you and you love me then why can’t we just move forward. Be angry, be mad, be disappointed. Do anything baby, I don’t care but please don’t ask me to leave. I won’t survive it another time.” Steve wiped the tears from his cheeks and he looked like he would truly jump from a tall building if it made Tony happy.
After some time he started feeling hot and so he removed all his clothes. His body was becoming loose and pliant, getting ready for a thorough pounding. But now Tony was genuinely concerned. What if Steve really refused to touch him.
He was in the arms of the Ton’s most eligible bachelor and he wished to be anywhere else in the world.
Maybe it was because he knew what it felt like to be loved completely, whatever he thought completely was, by Steve. And that has ruined him for everyone else.
“So you don’t think I would be a pushover for letting him get away with this?”
And Tony's world stopped.
Tony kneels too. He doesn’t know what to think. Lack of sleep and his heat have left him slow and sluggish. He looks into Steve’s face and sees only love. But he knows that’s not enough.
Steve, however, looks stunned at this, like he’s never heard all of this before.
He stands up quickly and his heart hurts from being separated from the man he loves. But this is what he needs to do. He looks into the face he loves and sees love but he doesn’t know if will ever be able to trust the man. Mind made up he again utters the three words he had regretted for the past few months, “Get out Steve.”
Two days before the window opened his watch started to beep madly. That was the signal. He stared at it for a second and then took off at a mad dash.
He entered the wordlessly and Tony just walked over to the couch, with Steve closely behind.
He should have known that he was only good enough to bed, and not good enough to wed.
Outwardly he is the same. His emotions in check, he is laughing with the alphas and ignoring the usual slew of dirty looks directed at him. Natasha would be proud.
“Give me one reason why I should forgive you.”
“But look at it from my side Steve,” Tony began gently, “logically, I know you don’t want anyone else but it is hard to feel secure about that right now.
The nerve on that man.
But then he had found out that this ‘friend’ was Steve’s ex-omega, James ‘Bucky’ Barnes. He had flipped the lid at that.
When he first started this Steve used a washcloth to clean Tony up. But after a little while, he started enjoying his come flowing out of Tony's abused and puffy hole. He didn’t want to clean it up. His seed belonged inside Tony. He decided to taste his omega first. The clear proof that he was ready to take Steve's cock, even in his sleep, made the alpha go weak in the knees with desire. He licked a broad stripe and moaning at the taste. He kneaded Tony's plump behind and spread him so that he could dive deeper. Tony's nectar was divine and Steve wanted every drop. He kept on licking inside. Tony wouldn’t wake up and anyway this act was not for his pleasure, it is for Steve’s.
He should be terrified but he wasn’t. To be used by his alpha, by his Steve, was an amazing thought. To know that the man took his pleasure from Tony and Tony alone was exhilarating. It made him feel like he was irresistible. Like even in his sleep he was able to attract America's most desireable alpha.
The servants had been told that Tony was a friend’s brother, living with Steve until said friend returned from his tour across Europe. Exactly zero people believed this lie, instead, assuming that Tony was Steve’s mistress. But since it was only servants Tony didn’t care. He wouldn’t have anyway but Steve seemed like a person who would care about this a lot.
How do you start a conversation like this?
A new threat emerges.
“Well you found out and I blew up on you. I still don’t understand how I could say something like that to you. Except I think it was because I was angry at myself. I think I was so ashamed that I lashed out.”
He supposes Victoria would be the perfect omega for Steve to marry.
The plot thickens.
“JARVIS, what's the battle status?”
How do you live without something vital to your survival?
“Tony, baby, I came here today because I was so afraid that you would bond with someone. That you would forget about me. I came because I am sorrier that you could imagine. I will do anything it takes for you to forgive me.”
Tony was pliant and lost to the pleasures of his body. Orgasms left omegas in a state of utter bliss, as a biological quirk to make sure that their alphas do not abandon them during such a time and as a way to make breeding easier. He softly kissed his mate, rubbing his hands on Tony's belly. A child. Their child.
He had been planning to propose a bond. The idea of being one with the love of his life had been circling his mind and with a heat coming up he and Tony would have been one. He was sure Tony would have said yes. He knew he was loved.
Calling the alpha Tony had been his second mistake.
He hadn’t really thought about his heat. He knew that with his cracked ribs Steve would refuse to touch him. And his alpha was still mad at him for his actions on the battlefield. You wouldn’t know it from the way he went about but he still had that little frown whenever he looked over at Tony.
Walking back to his own suite, which adjoined Tony's, he rang for his maid. After getting ready and eating breakfast, Steve set out for the stables. Getting the groomsman to ready his horse, he decided to take a round of Tony’s estate. Stratfield Saye House was a stately building with a large lake, multiple gardens, and a huge forest attached to it. Riding through it always left Steve in awe of the wonder and beauty of it.
"I may be deaf, but I'm not dumb. Who are you texting?"He asks, resting his chin on Steves shoulder and peering at the phone that Steve is so desperately trying to hide away from prying eyes."Is it the guy you're gonna meet today?"
"Tony, what you are doing is
to be put into his place."Obie's voice is a sneer in his face, lip curled up, his large meaty hand curled around Tony's hair and jostling his head back and forth painfully."But Tony, I'm too late to save you this time."
"Ah yes, I'll make sure to tell my kidnappers not to kidnap me next time, Pepper, don't worry. Maybe they'll listen if I add on a please or a
"Darling, you're never too busy for me. I'm too important to you."Tony smirks to himself, hopping up onto the workshop bench and swinging his legs off of the lift.
This morning, however, the extra body that's in his bed isn't one that Steve is overly familiar with. It's simple things, the way that there isn't any limbs thrown over his body or uneven breathing on the back of his neck, but the way that the body is curled into him, not away like Natasha, but into his body, tiny and small in comparison to anyone that comes to Steve's mind this early in the morning.
Steve is left looking at his phone, the light still harsh upon his eyes no matter how dim that the light is. His own fear is strong within Steve, and it's not even an odd feeling, it's not even weird, because it's a feeling of fear that has been nestled inside of Steve since the moment he met Tony and he
"Some teens were beating up a homeless man, I stepped in and sorted it out."He shrugs his shoulders, slumping into the dusty leather material of his seat. He ends up listing off all of injures in monotone, knowing that he will have to repeat everything he has said to everybody else that asks.
for me. I bought you that cheeseburger because I felt like shit for running out on you after...Y'know that."Steve waves his hand at Tony's chest, making the dark haired teenager look down at his chest and frown a little."You don't need to buy me anything."
, it had been the middle of the night that Steve was awakened from his restless, dreamless slumber by the piercing sound of his ringtone and the dull thud of vibrations against that wood of his old bedside table. Steve is still groggy with sleep, half of his body turned in his bed to reach for his buzzing phone and half ready to tell Clint to fuck off and get a taxi home when a voice beats him to it.
"Always time for changes."
To Tony's surprise, only two of those scents are coming off of him, still fully clothes in jeans and a shirt that is way too tight and way too flimsy, the soft blue light of his Arc Reactor shining through the flimsy material and brightening the dark material of Obies suit. His jeans are stained and so is his shirt, with liquids and dirt but he doesn't care.
Sarah Rogers would proudly say with confidence that she's proud of how her son turned out, because Steve might not be the smartest cookie or the best child to walk the earth, but he was confident, loyal and had a golden heart. Sarah Rogers sees Steve as the best thing to come out of her rocky marriage, and yes okay, Steve might not be the best and he was no goodie two shoes, but he was
"By three weeks I had the key to your house."Bucky deadpans, a smirk on his lips. It had actually belonged to his Mom after Sarah had gave it to her incase of emergency. Bucky had quickly stolen the key not even 3 weeks after his friendship with Steve had blossomed and still remains with it around his neck to his day, along with housekeys to everyone else's homes as well.
Despite it all, Tony had still floated in and out of Steve's thoughts in the oddest of moments after he had enlisted and served. He still longed for his touch as he was camped out on dusty wastelands, awaiting for a war criminal or an enemy to strike. Steve would still find himself wanting to rush to his mobile phone and type out a message to Tony about a new type of coffee he has come across, or how Tony's 'bots would put the Army's to shame. Or that Steve's nose was still haunted by the smell of Tony; of freshly ground coffee, of motor oil and grease, of sweet, expensive cigarettes imported from Turkey.
"I can get you some if you want? From the canteen, or one of the machines?"
And so Tony deflates a little, puts down his guard just a smidge to let his shoulders relax and to stand in a natural stance, feeling eyes watching him from behind and in front because Steve isn't a threat, he's a worried, concerned and upset friend. And he needs reassurance and help.
"A solid 9."
"No! Not a date!"Steve laughs it off, something that causes Tony to immediately frown at the reaction. He turns quickly to focus on packing his suitcase before Steve can see the sadness that Tony knows is washed over his face."Just to hang out."
"And this is Jarvis, Anna, Aunt Peggy and I."Tony smiles a sad smile, his thumb rubbing over the glass that covers the old photograph. Tony couldn't have been more than 4 when the photo was taken, sitting on the kitchen counter with his Aunt Peggy Holding his hips behind him and Jarvis and Anna to the left of her. It was his only photograph of all of his favourite people with him."I'm pretty young but you know it's me, and Jarvis looks the same."
"Oh I know, I remembered. I brought you tea, English Breakfast. 2 sugars, strong."Tony recites on autopilot, something he does a lot because he has a weird habit of just having to know everyone's preferred beverages. Mostly because he attends a lot of meetings with important people who get rather very mad when they get coffee instead of tea, or you only got them 1 sugar sachet and not the 3 they asked for. Tony also has a weird memory for things like this, the small details they nobody else cares about. Strange says it's sweet, Tony had told him he only remembers Strange' order because it's the same as his own.
Steve doesn't say anything further, trying his best not to look down at Tony's chest but finding that he's unable too. He's too drawn to the glow, out of curiosity of why it is there and what it does to keep Tony healthy and alive. Although, he doesn't want to be a bother to ask Incase he causes Tony to panic about it.
When Steve returns from his hour run around the block half a dozen times, Bucky is still there, settled on the sofa with a bowl of chips and some corny romantic comedy on the television that he would normally scramble to find the remote for to change the channel to make it look like he's not watching something romantically corny.
"Oh, he is. He thinks that he's the most chill guy in the world, but he isn't. And he's like super overprotective as well, in that type of endearing friendship type of way that does my head in but I wouldn't change it for the world? And I guess, if it wasn't for Rhodey pulling my ass outta situations I'd be dead by now."Tony shrugs, stuffing a handful of crisps into his mouth.
"Do you think I'm stupid? Is that it? Am I your new pet project to poke at when you're bored, a challenge for your own entertainment, a bet for your overinflated ego? Are you trying to study what it's like to date someone poor, naive and stupid from Brooklyn for extra credit? You might have made a fool out of me but I am not stupid."
"Um, Thank you."Tony manages a smile, ducking his head to hide the blush that coats his cheeks and instead taps his fingers on the heart monitor."That's the first anyone has ever said that to me...and meant it. I mean apart from Rhodey, but he rarely sees anything I work on so that's a rare occasion. So thank you, really."
"Um, okay-"
"I don't know yet."Tony mumbles, scrunching up his eyebrows as he focuses on all of the bits and bobs in front of him. Sarah will have a heart attack if she sees that Tony has dismantled the one thing that is telling them Tony's heart beat is regular and not missing any beats, but Tony is making sure that he does this as quick as possible so that Sarah doesn't find out, well she will eventually but not right now.
Steve hides the fatty food In his backpack, hoping that the insulation with hopefully stop the food from getting cold as he starts to walk towards the hospital after exiting Burger King. He places the milkshakes carefully in his bag, hoping not to jostle too much. He has his hands shoved deep into the pockets of his old jacket, a ridiculous - but made with love - knitted beanie on his head with a matching scarf around his neck, both bright with a rainbow of colours.
So Tony looks him directly in the eye and says, “Steve I needs you in me. Please, I feel so empty like this.” He isn’t even lying. He misses the slide of skin on skin, the taste of Steve on his tongue, and the way the alpha's eyes twinkled as he said the filthiest things Tony had ever heard.
He walks over to where Tony is holding his own court.
It has not started yet but it won’t be long before he is on the bed and begging Steve because no one else would be able to calm the fires that rage within him.
Steve immediately had doubts. Natasha turned to him with her supernatural ability and said, “I know you have doubts. Please wait until I am done.” So Steve smartly shut his mouth.
They went to couple’s counselling. Tony found the best and most discreet one in the city. They dealt with their issues. Tony and his feeling of inadequacy. Steve and his propensity to hide away parts of himself and his life.
And then the day when his heat was supposed to start dawns and he knew he was fucked. But not in the way he was so wishing for.
Comments and kudos feed my soul. No beta all me.
Then his worst nightmare comes true, Steve pulls out. His hole is unable to fully close and he feels so open. For Steve. He whines at the loss of Steve's cock. He is then carefully turned and he looks in Steve's sweet face, darkened by lust though it is. Steve’s eyes are nearly black, traces of the baby blue all but gone.
The machine worked exactly like he and Bruce had thought it would. The plan had been to send a sensor that would burrow deep underground and send an encrypted signal that could only be decrypted by them. This would help them prove the theory of time travel. Easy peasy. Something the Science Bros. did before lunch.
Bucky got off his chair and knelt in front of him, “why do you always sell yourself so short. He would be insane to not love you.”
Steve flinches at that and in a small voice asks, “are you?”
And Tony wishes he had the strength to laugh because this could only be a joke. But his eyes start to water again because that’s how Steve would sound before they broke up and this encounter is just confusing him now.
“I would never think that but if you don’t want to forgive him then that is valid too. My point is that you shouldn’t do anything that you don’t want to.”
Once more into the fray.
“It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mr. Rogers,” he says, practically purring. And if Steve hadn’t seen and laughed at this behaviour all his life, he truly would have believed Bucky and his over intimate tone.
“You’re wrong Bucky. I am nothing but a disgraced soldier. He is a Lord of the Realm, he makes weapons that the army uses in the war against Napoleon, and he is the richest man in the country. Even the Prince Regent wants to be his friend. I am nothing in front of him."
He didn’t know why, but tonight Tony felt tighter and warmer. The way he smelt and tasted was so intoxicating that Steve felt drunk. He hoped that tonight would be the night they conceive their child. These last few weeks have been crazy. Something had taken over him and breeding Tony seemed to be the only thing on his mind.
He wanted to just sink in, no foreplay, and take him like an animal. But no, he was not going do that. He'll prepare Tony first, widen the wet passage. And then he will be able to fuck Tony's hole, all night long.
Steve and Bucky haven’t ever danced together but they have fought together and so they know how to move in sync.
He had exactly five minutes before the window closed on this time period forever.
“Love isn’t enough sometimes. Please, Steve, I need time to think about this. I promise I will call you when I have decided.” He knew he was breaking his own heart but he also knew he wanted someone to love him and only him.
“Well then, you must call me Anthony.”
Tony let himself melt into the hug, desperate for contact with his alpha after these long and lonely months.
He starts small. Licking of a spoon seductively here, bending to retrieve a dropped screwdriver there. He schools his expressions, so that his master strategist doesn’t figure out his plan. When he gets no results, except lust blown eyes and soft touches, he ramps it up. He starts to cuddle with Bruce, which isn’t normally a problem for Steve. Except he is two days away from his heat. He knows that Steve is bothered by smelling Bruce on him. It is very obvious from the growling he directs at the man, and the scenting that follows after.
“I’m going to fuck you until I put a baby in your belly.”
Turns out, the stranger's name was Steve and the field was his, so was the manor that the field was attached too. After showing the alpha some of his tech Tony was finally able to convince the man of the truth.
“Fine, I’ll eat, but it’s not because I am afraid of you.” Tony huffed adorably.
“Come on Steve, I’m in heat. What did you expect me to do?”
The alpha turns white at this. Tony knows he is taunting Steve but then he has been tormented by Bucky for a long time. The spectre becoming a horrifying reality with the other omega getting what was Tony's.
After those pleasantries are done he turns to Steve and kisses his hand as is customary behaviour towards an omega.
Even now Steve is in the room with him, but he is keeping away as much as he can stand to. Tony knows it is difficult for him, but Steve is the one who came up with this stupid reason. So why should Tony suffer?
For as long as they were bonded Steve had grappled with the fact that he might have to give orders that could harm his omega. He only had to remember what it felt to order the portal closed after Tony, a stranger at that point, to know that he would never be able to give an order like that again.
“Yes, other omegas will be jealous and will probably plot how to separate you from me so that they can use their wily charms on you. I have half a mind to let them get to you Tony. Then you’ll realise what a model omega I am.” Steve joked, but he hated when other omegas and their mamas plotted against him. He was also amused because they never seemed to realise that he used to be a soldier and a very good at that. So he could spot their clumsy plans from a mile away. Tony may not be his but damned if he would let anyone else steal him away.
“NO.”
Steve feels affronted at this depiction of his past self.
Tony had obviously moved on. Scores of newspapers were covering Tony's escapades with other alphas. If he had to see another picture of some third rate alpha grinding his omega... No, not his omega anymore. It was like an itch under his skin, the knowledge that others had been with Tony, that they had taken what was only theirs and dirtied it.
Tony shook his head and looked into Steve's eyes.
He had to be the most handsome alpha Steve had ever seen. He cut a dashing figure in his evening jacket which accentuated his strong arms and broad chest. Lean but muscled; he had bright brown eyes and a radiant smile. He was the epitome of English Nobility but there was something about his manner or his way of speaking that made it obvious that he didn't enjoy these gatherings any more than Steve did.
On dits- gossip
“I’m from the future.” Damn eyes making him say the truth.
Preparations for the season were taking place and the entire manor was in grips of ecstasy. London, their destination, inspired that in people. And this year the excitement was doubled, soldiers returning meant long-gone relatives and lovers were coming back. Some of Steve's friends would be coming back to him too.
Although what if Tony wasn't jealous? What if he didn't care?
Could he go and beg? Would that even work?
“No, I don’t know, I kept thinking about you with some other alpha and the next thing I knew I was standing outside your building.”
You are everything. Everything”
Steve looks horrified.
What would happen to him? He had been Tony's mistress for two years now. And in those two years, Steve had fallen completely in love with the alpha. He wanted a home, a mate and children. But whenever Steve even hinted at something like that Tony would shut down and then try to distract him. It was clear that Tony didn’t care about Steve that way he cared about Tony. But the question was, what would happen to Steve? His reputation was ruined the second he decided to sleep with Tony on that fateful day. The army was wary about him joining the ranks before all this so there was no way they’d let him stay. His reputation would also stop a respectable alpha from marrying him.
When he was just outside the door he heard Lord Rhodes voice, loud and booming, “Tony, you have to marry and Virginia is the best choice. Her family has lands, money, and a title. And she is the sole heiress of the entire estate. You won’t find a better match than her. It doesn't matter where your heart truly lies or who you wish to spend your life with.
If he was drunk then maybe he won’t miss Steve so much.
“Now what would a pretty omega like you be here at this time of the night?” Great, five minutes of being stuck in the past and he was getting the delicate omega stereotype. Just great.
“You can stay with me. It’s not every day you have a traveller from the future.” Steve smiled up at him.
Steve looks deep into those eyes and keeps fucking him.
Without hoping that it takes root.
Maybe, maybe meeting Steve and getting some answers was enough. Maybe this would be enough to move on. But did he want to move on? Could he really imagine a life without Steve? Weeks, months, years and decades without seeing that face, without feeling those arms wrap around him. Without his kisses. Without Steve deep inside him.
Tony realised that he couldn’t put the whole blame on Steve. Yes, a large portion of the issue was due to Steve, but Tony played a part too. He never felt the need to sit down and talk about how he felt when the alpha pushed him aside. That staying quiet to keep the peace between them had strained the relationship.
“And I can’t abandon the mission because you can’t separate your personal life from the mission”
Bucky was the son of a minor lord and Steve’s mother had worked for them. The boys had practically grown up together, both ignoring their parent’s attempts to separate them. They were inseparable and when Steve signed up to fight Napoleon’s forces, Bucky had joined too much, to his father’s chagrin. They had exchanged letters when Steve was forced to leave the battle and now he couldn’t wait for the day when his greatest friend would come back. Maybe he would have a solution to his problems.
"You're only sayin' that because you aren't gay."Steve rolls his eyes, glancing at the photograph of Tony that he has saved to his phone. It's a cute photograph of Tony and it makes him blush every time that he thinks that.
"I'm going! I'm going!"Tony is frantic with trying to get himself out of the apartment before he starts to make things worse, of only he could find his goddamn...
Steve is reaching his phone, shocked to see the 6 text messages left.
is looking access onto your property."JARVIS has ever gratefully lowered the sound, the lights dimmed to a perfection that Tony would admire if he was to open his eyes or move his head from where it's smushed against the pillow of his living room sofa. He hadn't made it to the bedroom and to be honest, Tony is surprised he even made it to The Warehouse, nevermind to his living room sofa.
"You shouldn't be working on Christmas Day."Tony brushes off her comment. It comes to a surprise that Sarah has yet to recognise him as the Poster Child for Future Stark Tech, which may or may not be in progress depending if Howard can get his hands on his Sons technology. But even at that, the media follows his ass even when he goes to take a leak, you'd think Sarah would see him as he is, and not as the teenager that everyone seems to miss.
"Like what way?"
"Maybe a little while later, Rach. I've got the case of a food baby."Steve laughs to soothe the little girls mind. As for effect, he pats his stomach earring  giggle from Rachel and a roll of his eyes from Bucky who looks unimpressed with everything going on. If it was up to Bucky, Christmas would consist of eating Thai takeaway and watching mass amounts of YouTube.
"At least I would be of better use to you, Sir."Tony seems to laugh through his nose at the comment, catching sight of his smirk of amusement through the bathroom mirror that has been illuminated with light upon his entrance. The smirk seems to fall, only slightly, off of his face as he catches sight of his appearance, of his full nakedness in the illuminated bright mirror that seems to etch out every little detail of his body, of his muscles, of his skin, of his scars, of the florescent blue orb of light that remains situated in the middle of his chest.
But that was what he had deserved, for being too much and not enough.
There were good days and there were bad days. Some days Tony felt like he and Steve would fall back in love in no time. Some days... well some days Tony felt he was a fool for ever letting Steve back in. That feeling had nothing to do with Steve’s actions after they got back together and everything to do with his doubting mind.
“What do you think you are doing?” Steve looks at him like he is the mad one here.
He turns to leave but nothing could have prepared him for what Steve says next.
Tony draws Steve down to kiss him, while running his hands all over his sweaty back. And then using his considerable strength, he picks Tony up and in one fluid motion enters him again. They both groan at the sensation.
Tony knew there was something about them that he should stop. But he didn’t want to. His days went better when he smelled that orange cinnamon smell on himself. He felt better when his eyes met Steve’s.
“What are your conditions, Tony,” Steve asked, still smiling and clutching his hands like he’d never release them.
“But that made you go to Bucky, didn’t it? Admit it Steve, I wasn’t as important as you wanted me to believe.”
But Tony didn’t follow. Much as he would like to fight, he knew he was pushing it. Sighing he went to the bedroom he shared with Steve and flung himself on the bed. Thankfully there were no witnesses to this thoroughly teen girl behaviour.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony wanted a child more than he had ever wanted anything. Maybe not as much as he had wanted Steve but it was close. So he didn’t want just any child, but Steve's child. He could just imagine the future and the happiness it held. Telling his alpha he was pregnant and being kissed stupid because they couldn’t handle their excitement. Steve rubbing and caressing his stomach, talking to it. Tony and Steve holding their little miracle.
Tony didn’t want Steve to die. Steve was too good and kid to die off in a war.
Maybe he is banking on the fact that Steve will get irritated and leave himself. And then there will be no need for awkward conversations or sad goodbyes.
He should have said no. But he didn’t.
Tony loves every second of it and wants that feeling now. He would stop if he thought Steve didn't want sex but that's not what is happening. If the lingering glances, scenting, and the copious amounts of pheromones he is releasing in the air are any indication, Steve wants to fuck him seven ways to Sunday.
“So I have to be your pretty doll so that you can destroy these clothes. Aren’t you paying too high a price for something that you would do anyway?” Steve knew that Tony just had to see him in the newly fashionable suits to drag him to a dark corner.
Life chugged along after that earth-shattering revelation. Steve, foolishly perhaps, remained with Tony. He didn’t know what prompted him to ignore the truth and pretend that his heart wasn’t being crushed finer every day. It would seem that nothing changed outwardly, but that wasn’t true. Tony was acting differently and so was Steve. It was imperceptible perhaps, to everyone but them. There was a distance between them that had never existed before. Kisses that missed their mark, embraces that lasted longer than they needed to, and a new franticness to their lovemaking, like they would never get to do this again. It was Steve’s new reality and he wished he could accept it.
Rhodey sighed, “dude you love him, and if you wanna work through this then you should try it. I don’t want you to make a decision that you will regret.”
Steve didn’t think like this. He was taught differently. He believed in equal omega rights. He isn't like this but these days there is something in the air that makes him want to be like that.
Suddenly strong arms enclose him and he lets them for a second, starved for the alpha's touch. But he soon shakes those arms off and turns to tell Steve to fuck off.
Damn that smile too.
And his scent got stronger.
He had locked himself in their room and had shouted at Steve to leave and the stupid alpha listened to him and had left. Now, three weeks later he knew he was spiralling. Pepper looked at him with worry and Rhodey called him every chance he got. But he didn’t know how to fix anything. He knew he loved Steve but he honestly didn’t know if Steve loved him back.
After that, Steve wasn’t even sure why Tony forgave him. He couldn’t believe that he had hurt his omega like that.
After that Steve gathered him in his arms they both silently sobbed. Steve picked Tony up and walked over to the couch and put him in his lap, where he spent hours just scenting him stroking him.
Without pumping his seed deep in him.
Steve feels so full and he wishes he could feel like this forever. Tony sets a slow pace and refuses to speed up like he is hell-bent on driving Steve mad. And then just before Tony climaxes, Steve hears a whispered word.
That was when he encountered the second side-effect. He had been getting vivid dreams and they always left him hard and slicked. As Tony Stark refused to do behave like a teen by having wet dreams followed by ruined sheets he had started wearing boxers and sleeping on his stomach to save the sheets from the worst of his slick.
The next morning Steve is a mess. He is half crying and apologizing for taking advantage of Tony, “I am nothing but a drunk and a brute. I don’t deserve your forgiveness.”
He apologizes to Steve and is forgiven but the physical distance remains. Steve is always near but never touches Tony. He has known Steve for three years and they have been bonded for two. He knows Steve as well he knows his own back hand. He had never expected to find a person like this. To find a soul that was so in tune with his. So the fact that his bonded is not touching him, especially so near his heat is frustrating. He is an engineer; he should be able to fix this.
But soon it changed, their conversations became less polite. As the whispers grew around them, he began to realize that Lord Anthony stood closer than was appropriate, even for a couple in the midst of courtship, their fingers lingered on each other and then he was asked to call Lord Anthony as Tony, which was a distinction only awarded to close friends.
Steve was going out of his mind, though nothing new there. Tony's smell was especially potent tonight. And when he lowered the omega’s boxers, he was pleased to find that Tony was already loose and wet. Knowing from prior experiences that his tired omega won’t wake up no matter what, he got to work.
By the time the air carrier has landed back on American soil, he's never more glad to be home. And isn't that so strange? For Tony to call a place a home when he's spent so many years living in houses but not in a home? It's not just the thought of being in his own bed, in his own clothes, under his own bed sheets that has Tony's toes curling, it's the thought that he'll be out of sight of the constant concerned stares that everyone seems to give him. It's almost as if nobody has seen Tony Stark in a wheelchair before, jeez.
"Oh, fuck sorry."Tony is moving his thumb away from the front camera in awareness with a bush on his cheeks at the stupidity of it all."I was covering my identity."
"No! No, don't- don't come here, don't come to me."The robotic voice is gone, filled back with frantic and worry and fear that's so unlike the cocky, happy go lucky attitude that Tony's voice is usually filled with. It worries Steve, it makes his chest ache and his head hurt."I'll come to you, I'll meet you...somewhere, I'll be 10 minutes."
Steve can feel the colour drain from his face and he feels nauseous. He didn’t know he would have to see this interloper so soon. He turns to see Tony's face and his face is blank. There are no expressions there. Then he moves to Lord Rhodes and he looks uncomfortable with the entire situation.
So he came out to drink and have fun. Not that he was having fun. But the drinking part was good.
But he knew there was no use. Steve was with Bucky now. He was sure of this in his heart. Bucky wasn't just any ex, he was the one that got away. He broke up with Steve when the alpha was in the army and fighting the war. Steve spent weeks trying to get back together with the omega. But Bucky soon transferred to another unit and Steve took the hint. But he obviously never got over it.
Bucky, having amassed a fortune trading, assured him that he had been invited to plenty of balls and soirees now that he was rich. Minor lord though he was the desire for money still prevailed in the people who wished to associate with him. And that is where they would start. Nobody in the Ton really knew that Steve and Bucky were childhood friends so they should be safe. Steve had been unable to calm his nerves when Natasha had outlined her plan but he had acquiesced and now there was no turning back. There was a ball at Lord Ashworth's and Tony had sent a message to be ready by 8 pm. Hopefully, they would be able to execute the first part of the plan without any problem.
Tony stared at him. He was sure that his best friend would tell him to dump Steve and never look back. And he said as much.
He didn’t know where he had forgotten it. When he decided that their love could be insulted like that.
Tony's eyes light up at that.
Steve took a deep breath.
And slowly Tony understood that forgiveness didn’t need to be bitter. It could also be freedom. Tony slowly forgiving Steve over months was freedom for Tony. Freedom from that oppressive feeling that followed him everywhere. Freedom from that chokehold that was insecurity and hate.
How could a mere soldier with no money, no reputation and no title win against Lady Virginia Potts, daughter of one of the richest Earls in Christendom?
They both are giggling so much they don’t notice a pair of tawny eyes stare daggers into their backs.
No, he couldn’t.
But he also knew that if they entered a relationship again, he would spend their entire lives worried about something like this. Worried that Steve would leave him. That he would shut Tony outside again.
“Steve I need to know why you did this.” Tony had already braced himself to hear all of it but he knew it wouldn’t be easy. ”Tell me everything and spare no detail. I don’t care if it hurts me but I need to know everything.”
“Tony, please don’t cry. You know I can’t bear it when you cry.” He looks so sad when he says this, fists clenched by his sides.
Keeping his face straight despite the way his heart was pounding he said, “I have realized that you only do something I wish you would when I pick you up and force you to do it.”
He also knows that Steve wants him like he has never wanted anyone else. Sex, or making love as Steve calls it, is one of their favourite activities. And they frequently enjoy all kinds from the need-you-right-now, the slow exploration of bodies, to the fun and kinky kind. So he knows that Steve hates staying away as much as Tony does. Their sex life attests to this fact. Hasn’t Tony spent hours spread out under his alpha who uses his fingers, tongue, and cock to drive him mad with want.
Tony wants to cry, he can’t believe that Steve is like all the other alphas he’s fucked over the years and the ones he wanted to fuck but couldn’t over the past few weeks. That Steve just wants to sleep with him.
“Steve, Stark enjoys your company. You are the longest mistress he has ever had. He loves spending time with you. Don’t sell yourself so short. There must be something about you that he likes. We just have to turn it into love.”
No sex in this chapter but I did want to add. Would you guys be interested in actual sex scenes? Please do tell me.
“Because you love me. I made a mistake and I know there is no life for me if I don’t have you.”
“What omega Tony? You’re the only one in my life.”
It took them some time to fall back together. Steve moved back in. They shared Tony heats again. They even bonded 2 years later. Slowly but surely, Tony regained his trust in Steve. It hadn’t been easy but Steve proved at every turn that he was trustworthy.
Immediately Steve begins to protest it. “Tony baby no, please. I don’t like living without you. Waking up in the morning and not seeing you there feels like torture. Please. I’ll sleep in a different room but please let me come home.”
And then his lips are captured in a brutal kiss, Tony snakes his hand into his hair and yanks Steve’s head back. He kisses a languorous path down to his neck and sucks a bruise there, high where it would be visible no matter how much Steve tries to hide it.
After about half an hour of war talk, Tony pipes up and asks Steve to dance with him and he gladly accepts. Tony leads them to the dance floor and soon they are swaying to the tune and Tony is making Steve laugh by telling him the latest on dits. But that soon devolves into filthy whisperings of what he will do to Steve once they get home. Steve is sure that he is bright red and that everyone knows what they are talking about.
“There Steve, right there.” He tries to move his hips, hoping to follow the sensation but Steve holds firm, not letting Tony move an inch.
Also also this is not the end of jealous Tony. It is just the beginning. Next chapter will have more.
“Tony, baby please never think that. I can’t even imagine it. I am yours, only yours. The idea of being with someone else is abhorrent to me. I am yours, till my dying breath.”
“Bucky, the omega you were sneaking around with. The one you have loved all these years.” And isn’t that the kicker. If Steve had spent time with Bucky without telling Tony, sharing his life then did he ever really love Tony? Or was he just a stop-gap, a way to pass the time until he got the one he really wanted.
Steve knew that he couldn’t live a life without Tony. His heart was tainted with their love; it would never accept anyone else. He knew that he would have to put up a fight. But how?
“Oh my lord, Stevie, you haven’t changed at all.”
He absolutely didn’t enjoy the ball and he hated how everyone gawked at him. He also hated how everyone stared at him or treated him differently for being an omega. An omega soldier. A poor omega soldier. They wished to know about his life, how he fooled the army into letting him fight. Some alphas stood too close and said things, where the meaning was plain. To them, he was an object to be admired and then discarded when the sheen wore off.
“What is something that is common for all alphas?” She asked the group.
Soon he will descend fully into the heat and nothing but a knot will calm him. It is nowhere even close to the real thing but it will have to do.
Tony was still not fully awake but was getting there. He looked at Steve and his pupils were blown so much that there was barely any of that warm brown left. Overwhelmed with lust and love Steve leaned in, bending the omega in half, and kissed Tony within an inch of his life.
Tony is drowning in sensations. He can’t move or touch Steve. They can’t even kiss. All he is able to do is clench his hole in a futile bid to keep Steve in and make him turn this slow and steady pace into one that satisfies his wanton need.
He very carefully doesn’t think that he would be better for Steve any day.
Adorable.
Later in the day, when his hand hurt but his body wanted more, he heard the doorbell. He hadn't ordered any food so it was probably Pepper with some because he would not let any others around him during his heat.
Shortish chapter, sorry for that.
Tony mating with another omega.
“You could always say that you need me in your bed. I will come running after that proclamation.”
So, of course, Steve lost the ability to converse in English. Very peculiar considering he had managed to speak the language all his life.
Now Steve was crying in earnestness. “No baby, never. I don’t know why I said that but you are not needy. I love it when you come to me. I love it when you seek me out after a long day or when you are tired. Taking care of you is not a chore, it’s an honor.
“No J, I don’t want him injured because he is too horny to think straight.”
Steve cherished those moments the most. He kept replaying them in his head when he was away from Tony. That is when he truly realised that he wanted no other life but this.
walked into the room and walked straight up to Lord Rhodes who was standing next to him and said, quite loudly, “Buttercup, where have you been. I missed you terribly.”
His new clothes fit him really well, and Steve blushed deeper when he saw Tony in them.
Tony was sacred, so scared that Steve was out there cheating on him. He was scared shitless. If Tony didn’t get a reply from Steve immediately or if Steve didn’t answer his calls, Tony's mind went straight to cheating. He would torture himself with the images of Steve fucking Bucky.
“What does it matter Steve”
And with that he left. Again.
Steve finally realised that protecting Tony from the world and its realities wasn’t his duty. All Steve could do was be there through thick and thin.
“You can’t fix it, Steve. I love you but I don’t know if I can trust you.” Tony couldn’t believe he was saying something like this. He had thought that he would beg the alpha to take him back, but presented with the chance he was throwing it away.
Before Steve was able to understand what Natasha meant Bucky strode to him and picked him up in a bear hug. And for a second all of Steve’s worries melt away. He was with his best friend, his brother even and he felt safe. He nuzzled closer.
So surprised in fact that he blurted out, “What the fuck are you doing here?”
But it was not just that. It was the deep possessiveness that he felt when he entered his omega. Like Tony was his plaything. Just a good little cock sleeve, there to be fucked and used, and then put away, till next time.
The alpha he was grinding with lowered his hands to Tony's butt, dragging him on his clothed erection. The music was loud, the bass vibrating through his frame. He was in the middle of a throng of people, dancing his heart out.
Bucky looks at him like he is crazy, “I’m talking about how you are pining over some man when you used to beat up alphas for calling you names.”
He turned and looked at Steve. He didn’t know what to do. In some part of his brain, what Steve did made some sense. But his heart was so sore and he didn’t want to feel like this ever again. Once burnt twice shy or whatever.
“Will you do me the honour of dancing with me?” He is looking at Steve with big eyes and its clear that he is offering that as a way to escape this situation, and not just to make Tony jealous.
“I followed you because I love you, Tony. I love you and I would follow you to hell and back.” Steve looked at him with those eyes and it was pretty obvious that he believed what he said.
“Thank you, thank you, thank you. You will not regret this.”
“It matters because I love you, it matters because I am sorry, it matter because I wanna come home.” Steve is crying now, what a pair they make.
The thing was that Steve could never resist Tony. It never once crossed his mind that he would be denied. He didn’t understand how he was supposed to see his omega, smell him, and touch him, without sinking into that slick warmth.
What he can’t figure out is why. Steve got exactly what he wanted, his old omega Bucky, so why was he sad?
Yeah right.
Steve stared at him for a long time, “Tony I love you. I can promise you that I will never ever be this stupid again. I have already cut all contact with Bucky. I don’t care about him at all. He was my past. You are my present and hopefully my future. You’re all I want in life. This one mistake should not destroy both of our happiness.”
“What do you mean?” he is confused, has he lost some part of himself.
“Come on Tones, tell me what you are thinking.” Rhodey was extremely worried about him. That worry felt like a soothing balm on his aching soul.
Steve is used to it. Dare he say he enjoys it? He knows the reason for the hate. In the mind of the Ton Tony is his and so they hate Steve.  Feels no need to be loved or liked by people who have no respect for him and yet right now he longs for some company, some friendship, some understanding of what it’s like to want Tony but never being able to attain him.
Once they were both sitting, no one started talking. But honestly Tony didn’t know how to start.
The idea of his omega, swollen with his child, sitting on the bed, wet and wanting, begging for his cock; it was the only thing that he could think of. Suddenly Tony started to stir beneath him. Smiling, Steve pulled out and turned him over onto his back. The omega was still groggy from sleep and was blinking adorably at the scene. Steve wrenched Tony's legs apart, supporting them on his arms, before entering him again.
“I knew what you were doing the whole week,” Steve says nonchalantly as if they are in a park and not fucking. “I knew you were acting out to get me to break. This is punishment for that. So now you will come on my cock alone and I get to set the pace.”
He took the dildo out of Tony's hand and slowly withdrew it, and Tony knows his hole is loose and gaping with nothing to close around. Steve then throws it away. Hmm someone is angry at the toy.
They dance together for three songs and then walk back to where Lord Rhodes and Bucky are still standing. Tony has a smug smile on his face and that gives Steve some hope. Maybe, just maybe he feels as Steve does.
After clutching Tony like he is in the armour and is giving Steve a lift, a hug and fly, his alpha sets a brutal pace. But here too he is unable to move so he just holds on tight with his arms around Steve’s shoulders. Enjoying the feeling of his alpha in him, around him. He is surrounded and overcome by Steve and it is the best feeling in the world. He can hear the obscene squelching and slap of skin on skin with every stroke. The feeling is slowly building up. Steve's knot is fully flared now and is catching at his rim. Both of them are close. Suddenly Steve shouts and pushes in as deep as he can go, and then he is coming in long spurts. His orgasm triggers Tony's and his insides clench to milk Steve’s cock for every drop. This is why nothing can beat the real thing. The dildo is nothing when compared to Steve.
When Tony mentioned this to him, a teary-eyed Steve vehemently denied it.
“Tony you are on bed rest, you have cracked ribs, and you are in heat. You are sitting this one out.” He sounded firm, like he expected Tony would bow down and follow his order.
Steve knew he had fucked up. This whole thing was his fault. This one secret and his attempts to justify them had wrecked the best thing in his life.
What plan? What is it that we could do that could change Tony's desire to marry an omega with a spotless record? Right then the footman entered the foyer and announced the arrival of someone.
“NO.” Steve roared and came to kneel in front of Tony, “you are. You are the love of my life. Yes, I loved him once upon a time; I will not insult both of us by pretending otherwise. But you, Tony, are the love of my life. There will be no one after you. I will never recover from our love. I don’t want to.” He looked so sincere that Tony wanted to believe him. “It’s funny how you could be making the worst mistake of your life and not notice it. Not recognize the impact of that single decision.”
Usually, Steve just nodded and kept silent around others. But not today. Today he gives Bucky a brilliant smile and says with all the warmth he has in his heart for his dear friend, “me too Lord Barnes.”
He snorted but it didn’t seem like he was finding this any funnier than Tony was. The story had just started and Tony was already feeling the vice of sadness tighten around him.
Steve’s entire countenance stiffens and he swallows, “At first it was because you told me to get out and I was so ashamed. But then I heard that you were meeting alphas in clubs and I thought you had moved on.”
“I told you not to do it.”
Maybe he had shacked up with his former omega. Happy that his obligation to Tony was over. Maybe they were in bed right now celebrating. Tony gagged at the thought.
“Mine.”
Love was strange that way.
That also meant that no one could ever complain about any other rules of etiquette they broke; namely dancing more than two dances with the same partner despite the gossip of them committing public indecency. If they thought that was indecent, then the Ton en masse would clutch their pearls and faint at their behaviour in the bedroom. Steve loved dancing, and they danced as long as he wished. He loved it when Tony whispered in his ears, making him giggle and blush in turns.
Steve bred Tony until he was pregnant.
Now that Tony has realized that he won’t be able to live without Steve the moment of his final departure draws ever closer. Suddenly there are only 15 days left and he realizes that he has a choice to make. Leave or stay.
And right then he made his first mistake.
Tony looked into that beloved face and couldn’t find a trace of deceit.
He’s out on the field when he hears footsteps behind him. But he doesn’t care about that. He sees his lab and Bruce waving to him madly. He hastens his steps and he’s through. He hears the portal close and his heart feels heavy for it.
He was unsure what his actions should be now. Should he leave Tony or should he stay and share him with someone else.
Tony thinks Steve belongs to him. His heart is bursting with joy and as they remain locked together Steve thinks that he might actually win this war.
As soon as Steve left, Tony collapsed into a heap on the floor but the expected tears did not come. He must have run out. Whatever the reason Tony didn’t cry. He sat there on the floor for a long time and wondered at his own stupidity.
What if Tony bonded with another alpha?
“Sometime this year babe.” He can’t help but whine.
I still love you but I don’t know if you really love me.”
Immediately, Tony's head snaps to them, and his eyes zero in where their hands are touching.
“I didn’t sleep with anyone. I tried, a lot. But nobody was you.” Steve whipped his head up and stared at Tony with so much hope.
Right now he would do anything for that dream to be a reality.
That won’t do. Tony needed his alpha and he needed him now.
Suddenly Steve is on him and they are kissing fiercely. The alpha picks him up and Tony wraps his legs around Steve’s waist, he is able to feel that thick bulge. He whimpers and that makes Steve deepens the kiss. He’s grinding his cock on Steve’s and he feels him loosen up, getting ready to take an alpha’s knot.
He didn’t know how he didn’t go mad before.
Oh boy!
He doesn’t know at what time Bucky will arrive, just that he will. He will then mingle a little before heading over to talk to Tony. And since people always come to talk to Tony or Lord Rhodes, it won’t be considered odd.
“But Steve, I am working, I don’t have time to eat.” Tony looked up from his work, pouting at having to stop. Like a child, not wanting to sit down for his lessons, ready to throw a tantrum.
Tony feels spread open but in the best way. And after the week he has spent he needed this more than he thought. Both of them needed this.
and the stock price for Stark Industries shot up so much the Board of Directors forgot to be assholes for a second.
God, how did the alpha always have the words that touched Tony’s innermost core? Those words were waking up a hope that he had worked hard to squash.
He was feeling like someone was eating him inside out. His heart hurt and he knew he was at the edge of insanity. He couldn’t lose Tony. He just couldn’t. One mistake should not be enough to ruin the best thing in his life.
He soon learned that Tony was incapable of truly loving anything. Because as soon as the knot went down, Tony withdrew from Steve and sat on the edge of the bed.
Steve looked broken like he had swallowed knives and they were cutting his insides up. But he said yes.
“Steve, be ready for supper by eight as Rhodey is arriving this morning to stay for a few days.” Tony bent low to whisper in his ears, rubbing his hands over the naked skin of Steve’s back.
Bucky and Steve make their way back to Tony and Lord Rhodes and right away he knows something is wrong.
Steve scoots forward and cups his face, and Tony can’t help but nuzzle into those warm hands, they had always kept him safe.
Mistress. Tony wanted him to become his mistress. Someone who he would not have to court and marry. He should say no. It was beneath him. He was a decorated war hero. He shouldn’t debase himself for a few scrapes from the man he loved.
But they were together now so it was all okay. Everyone was happy.
“Of course not, why would a big strong alpha be afraid of a meek omega like me.” Steve said, amusement clear in his voice.
His hole was getting looser, the muscles inside relaxing, and filling with slick. Ready to receive an alpha’s knot. And still no sign of Steve.
But that dream is soon shattered when Steve sees a small commotion happening at the bottom of the grand staircase. It seems like alphas are jostling with their mothers to gain an introduction to some omega chit. And when people move Steve is able to see a young girl with fiery red hair.
If he saw Steve talking to some other omega, Tony's stomach would start roiling.
The farmer was not a farmer. Well dressed and very obviously an alpha, he had broad shoulders and a strong chest. He smelled of oranges and cinnamon if he had to guess. Handsome and well built he might be but his eyes were what interested Tony the most. The alpha had such kind eyes.
Steve was a very generous host. He said he’d let Tony stay at his house till the next window for travel opened up. He said he’d order some appropriate clothes for Tony. Apparently, his Black Sabbath T-shirt and jeans were not something respectable omegas would wear in public. Steve blushed when he said this, his ears turning a lovely shade of red.
Steve looked uneasy at that, “it’s not pretty Tony.”
Tony swallowed the lump that seemed to have formed in his throat.
After a week, and a lot of alcohol, Tony was ready to face the world again. He knew what he had to do. His confused feelings didn’t let him relax for a second and he wanted answers. The suspense was killing him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m designing a new helicarrier.”
Steve knows he fucked up. What he doesn’t know is how he could have done such a thing. Tony is the love of his life. Some days the idea of seeing the omega laugh was the only reason he had the energy to wake up.
He goes to suit up and Steve, the bastard, stops him.
Steve finally understood that the pain he had inflicted on Tony was a part of their lives but didn’t need to be the defining feature. That his love was enough and that he didn’t need to beg for forgiveness.
Tony's smile turned into a leer, “I wouldn’t oppose you picking me up right now but you will have to have your way with me.”
Steve feels like a fool; a fool for agreeing to this asinine plan and a fool for thinking that Tony will care. A fool for thinking that he could get the best alpha in the kingdom to fall for him. If it hasn’t happened yet then why should it happen now?
Steve ponders over this and realises that what his friend is saying is true. He has lost his fighting spirit. He hasn’t been called stubborn by every single soul that he knows for nothing. One look at his rival should not be enough to scare him away.
“Steven, no, I am going on that field and you can’t stop me. I am healthy enough to fight and I know you can keep it in your pants for the duration.” Why Steve was being like this he didn’t know.
At those words Steve paled, and Tony knew he had crossed a line. This was a real issue for him and to throw it in his face during a fight was a low blow. Even Tony with his limited understanding of emotions knew that.
He couldn’t breathe. He needed air. He had asthma as a child and that is exactly what he was feeling right now. Tony was in heat. He knew that, the omega went into it like clockwork.
But then he started noticing something odd about it all. He soon started to wake up with a sore hole which always felt full. Full of Steve’s come.
He needed this to succeed, he didn't know how he would live if he didn't have Tony.
The thing is that while most of the Ton hates him, there is a small group that doesn’t.  Young alphas have been trying to get at him for years. In their minds, anybody who is able to keep Lord Stark’s focus on them must be an amazing person to take to bed. Steve is disgusted by these soft little lords, who he could defeat in two punches. But Tony hates them with a passion. So it is a good thing that Bucky reminds him of one of those lords, just less soft.
“I know that Tony. Don’t you know that I know that? But what if something had happened to you? Something worse than cracked ribs and a concussion. I can’t lose you. I refuse to. So I need you to listen to me if I give you an order. It’s for your own good. I can’t abandon the mission because I am too worried about you.”

Steve's heart started pounding. That couldn’t be true. Tony wouldn’t agree to marry someone just for their money. Yet an insidious voice in his mind reminded him that all alphas wanted an heir and so did all lords, and Steve refused to share his heat with Tony. Breathless he waited for Tony's answer. Hoping that he would reject the offer, hoping that he would choose Steve.
No beta, all me. Please if you see any mistakes then do tell me and I will try to fix them.
When he was finally released from the hospital two days later Steve drove him to the tower. They chatted about everyday things. Normally after a stunt like this Steve would stay away from Tony for a day or so, to calm down. But with his heat mere days away Steve was powerless to leave him alone for very long. Normally they would spend this time together, working on reaffirming their bond and preparing for the three days of heat but not this time. Steve barely looks at him. He even refused to touch Tony, citing his injuries as a reason to pull away.
“You taste so amazing. I want to keep doing this for hours.” Steve husked out. Tony turns to look at him and feels a swoop in his gut as he is flooded with even more lust. Steve’s mouth is covered in slick and his lips are red. He looks debauched.
“No. I told you. We were meeting as friends, not ex-lovers. The thought of anyone else touching me or me touching them is abhorrent to me Tony. You’re it for me.”
Also, do tell me if this fic needs an epilogue because I am not sure.
They are talking to Lord Rhodes, who is acting the same as well.
He couldn’t wait to meet them. He wondered if they'll be like him or Tony.
“Steeeeve please,” Tony moaned, twisting the bed sheets in his hands to ground himself.
He wonders if he has dreamt the whole thing up.
“As you wish sir.”
And then he is struck by a plan so diabolical he knows it will work.
Then he started feeling a little ill, not much but noticeable.
When he felt he had taken in his fill, he took out his cock, and dragged it over Tony's leaking hole, getting it wet and sloppy. Then in one swift move, he sank down to his balls, moaning at the warm tight feeling. Even in his sleep, his omega was clenching around him, sucking him in deep and trying to keep him there. He started to pump in and out, his pants and the wet squelching the only sounds in the room.
“You have to eat,” he stated firmly, “or I’ll pick you up and carry you out.” He would too, it wasn't like there was anyone there to see and judge them. For that reason alone, Steve loved coming to the country, where there was no one and they didn’t have to stay in separate houses and no one gossiped about him. That was an aspect that he hated about The Society. They knew what he was, knew his purpose and treated him accordingly.
For Tony who loved every second of it last night, this comes as a bit of a shock. He spends a considerable amount of time making Steve understand that he is fine and that he loved it. And also that he would love it if they did it more.
And suddenly a body crashes into him.
“You are so impatient.”
Steve knows that he is purposefully ignoring Tony, which is something he never does. It would not be wrong to say that his waking moments are generally occupied with thoughts of the alpha. So he can see how this would bother the man.
He turns around and it is Steve, gasping for breath.
“Baby, I love you. I promise I will never again hurt you this way.” Steve is begging. But Tony knows that if he gives in now he will get sucked into this black hole. He will never be able to get out.
He wished he was back at war. Right now, defeating Napoleon’s army seemed easier than dealing with this turmoil within him. It was obvious that Tony didn’t love him. Hadn't ever loved him. Why would he? Steve didn’t have a title or money; he was just the son of a farmer who decided that war was his calling.
He didn’t know if saying it was the right decision or not but that didn’t stop him from whispering, “Never.”
“No Tony you can always trust me. I made a mistake, it was just a mistake. I should have told you about Bucky. I shouldn’t have left.” The alpha’s eyes were streaming with tears and his voice was choked.
“We have a plan; we’re going to get your alpha back,” Natasha said serenely, as though the task was easy.
He put on a robe and stumbled his way to the door, sure that the doorman will not let just anyone enter.
(See the end of the chapter for
He writhes in agony, he wanted his alpha, the connection they shared with each other but he had to make do with a dildo. There were times when the tears overpowered the lust and he would just sit in his shower, music blaring at a high volume an accompaniment to his sobbing.
“Steve you have to see how difficult it is for me to believe. It’s Bucky. He was the love of your life.”
He was on the way to love. He knew that. He felt it every day. Tony looked at him and Steve would get a warm feeling in his stomach. He would offer up his arm while Steve got down from carriages and Steve would imagine their life together. He would imagine them spending his heats together, making babies. Maybe they would look like Tony. That idea pleased him more than it should. He was ready for Tony to propose marriage. He was ready to settle down with his alpha and live a blissful life.
Not sex, he believes Steve when he says he hasn’t slept with anyone else. He is good at reading Steve when he’s not being all soldierly. What he means are time and emotions. Parts of Steve's life that he has always kept away from Tony.
Steve’s stance changes the second he hears this, he becomes The Solider, and Tony could never understand him. “How can you say that? I have never loved anyone more than I have loved you.”
Tony will always be an afterthought to people, he knows that. But his relationship with Steve had fooled him into a false sense of security, that's why he had been unable to see the reality.
That night Tony worships him. Pushing him higher and higher but never letting him reach that peak.  Steve is incoherent with need but Tony uses his fingers and his tongue to wrack his body and mind with pleasure. Steve can feel how slick he is, how wet for his alpha.
‘Ah there you are Steve, I was wondering where you were.’
The alpha had a tonne of questions about the future, most of which Tony couldn’t answer. Butterfly Effect or not, knowing about future events could cause nothing but harm. But they did talk about the general stuff. The liberation of omegas, how the world worked and other things that wouldn’t change if one single man from 200 years ago knew about.
It should be a haven for the omegas but Steve is the odd one out here too. There is no love lost between other omegas and him. They dislike him on principle as he is too tall, too well built, and entirely too different. And he is the only mistress of the man they all wish to snatch.
Steve remains silent.
But Tony realised how important that was when he realised he waited for Steve to message or call him regularly.
Suddenly the Avengers alarm rings and JARVIS warns then of an imminent attack from Doombots. Fuck Dr. Doom.
Two hours later, Steve got down in front of his house and entered it. As soon as he did his friends came running. Well, Sam came running, Natasha walked down the main staircase in her sedate fashion.
He was regrettably informed that she was pretty, with a fiery temper to match her fiery hair. She was smart and extremely educated, her father sceptical about the notion that omegas were good for nothing except running a household and needlepoint. She rode horses and was rumoured to be an excellent shot with the pistol. She would take none of the alpha’s nonsense.
Steve was still smiling at the man when Natasha sidled up to him and whispered, “Meet the plan.”
Feeling his stomach churning at the thought he wondered if there was even a way out of this mess? He remembered a poem he had read once and it had talked about how love is like a string, once you break it you can never fix it. And if you try there will always be a knot present. Wasn’t that what was happening here?
But as alluring this image is and as much as Tony loves to be eaten out, he feels hollow. And he says as much.
His orgasm triggered Tony's and he too came with a shout. His omega's body was milking his cock for each drop. Clenching his member like he was afraid Steve would leave at the last second.
All I can say is that I am sorry. I now know what life is like without you. I can’t do it.” Steve tried to take his hands in his but Tony withdrew and Steve withdrew his hands, a broken expression on his face.
It was there that Steve finally realised how much he had hurt his omega by his insistence on keeping the various parts of his life secret and separate. He finally understood that for Tony, meeting Bucky was simply the straw that broke the camel’s back. That years of being kept on the sidelines had hurt their relationship.
“Tony, if nothing else you have to believe me when I say that I love you. And you are always enough for me. You are more than what I expected in this life. I thought I loved Bucky and that nothing would be worse than him leaving me. But that didn’t even begin to match the pain I felt when you left.”
Steve spent some time just existing with his omega. But soon after Steve was ready for another round. He hadn't even softened up and the news that his mate is pregnant made his blood burn. So he wrenched his omega's legs apart and enters in one swift move while staring deep into Tony's eyes.
With these thoughts swirling in his head, he sees Bucky saunter his way over to them, with a small smile playing on his lips. He looks like a rowdy and overconfident young alpha, someone who believes he can do anything. Steve knows Tony hates alphas like that, having to hear multiple rants about cocky little things.
The sensations he is feeling right now are becoming too much for him but Steve is relentless, licking into him, and the sensation of that strong powerful tongue on his soft insides.
“I don’t care.” Steve acquiesced again and so Tony prepared himself for the worst condition.
“Can I? You can’t even tell me about your life in the army?”
Courage, Tony thought to himself, courage.
“Steve please go. I need time to think. You broke my heart, at least give me time to think.” He is crying again, he doesn’t know how to deal with all of this.
It had all started innocuously. Steve had mentioned going out for coffee with an old friend, reconnecting about their shared past in the military. And Tony had been happy for him, glad that his alpha, in all but name, had someone with whom he could talk about the horrors of war.
Soon he was spending all his free time with Lord Anthony; they would go to balls and call on Lord Rhodes together. Anthony was fun and witty, continuously teasing him and making him flush a deep red. He was sure that Tony was courting him. As Steve had no elders in his family that could approve of a proposal of courting, Steve naturally assumed that Anthony was doing as he wished, without caring a whit about decorum or the Society.
“What do you care Steve, go back to your omega. I don’t want you here.” Tony could scream at the pain he feels when he says this but he will never beg Steve to stay. No matter how much he wants to.
Of course, he doesn’t care that Steve is dancing with someone else. Why would he?
"You’re right buttercup, I do need to marry, I understand that. I’ll write a letter to her father offering a marriage proposal and send it by tomorrow." Tony sounded resigned and strangely subdued.
As soon as they reach Tony's townhouse Tony grabs him and marches him to his chambers. There he makes a swift work of their clothes and soon they are naked.
“Bucky was my friend Tony, and yes I loved him, I did. But that love is nothing compared to what I feel for you. It isn’t.
Steve is laid out on the bed with Tony looming over him.
You don’t share anything with me, you never tell me anything. Do you know how that feels? All through our relationship, I felt like I was a second thought. I love you but you don’t love me.”
Now Tony knows how old-timey families work. An alpha needs an heir and married whatever omega he thinks fit for the task. Rich alphas marry richer omegas in order to gain power or money or both.
“Please Lord Stark, call me Steven.” He manages to stammer out.
They got along beautifully, giving Steve hope for the future. They could talk for hours and hours, about nothing and everything. They would go to balls and Anthony would always force him to dance more than the two permissible ones. Steve didn't mind, he loved being in the arms of the alpha. He could even bear the incessant teasing.
After a few minutes where no words were spoken Steve put him down.
Doesn’t love him.
Lord Rhodes is teasing Tony about the time he tried to build a raft which disintegrated the second it touched the water. Steve is laughing outwardly at the face Tony is making but his insides are squirming with nervousness.
So fully and completely.
“Give me one reason to trust you. One.” He wonders if he is bending but every part of him aches with the need to be with Steve.
“We met and it was like old times. After it was over, Bucky suggested we meet again and soon we were meeting regularly. And I still didn’t want to tell you. I thought it was because I was protecting you from worry. Turns out I was doing it because I was a coward and didn’t want to lose the best thing in my life.” He sounded so dejected that Tony almost comforted him. Almost.
“Well, my dear where would the fun be in that.”
“I love you Tony Stark, and I haven’t touched another omega since I first saw you.”
He hears a soft whimper and assumes that it is him but then it gets louder and he realises its not him that is making the noise, it is Steve. He looks over to where he is standing and he can see an erection straining in the confines of the uniform, and his eyes blown with lust.
He met Tony Stark at a ball thrown by Lady Kenilworth. He was invited because being the ‘hero’ who saved Lord Rhodes in a battle against the French despite being ‘only’ an omega made him something of a curiosity.
Meaning of some Regency era slang
It just came out in the heat of the moment. He had never meant it. He loved how much Tony loved him. It was unlike anything he had ever experienced. He knew he was loved completely and it was such a warm feeling. It was like seeing the sun after a long winter.
“They think they own everything and that omegas are not equal to them.” Steve hated when he was treated like he was delicate, or worse a delicate
He knew that Tony was an insecure man. With a history like his, it was understandable. And now Steve, who had promised to always cherish and protect the man, was just another in a long line of betrayals.
“Of course Tony, anything.”
“It wasn’t because you were not important enough or that I didn’t love you enough. It was because I didn’t want to burden you.”
Forgiveness, no matter how hard-won, tasted sweet.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve’s face crumpled when he heard this and his voice sounded choked when he said, “Tony, baby I am so sorry I came, I just missed you.”
He’s fought worse monsters in his life.
That love finally became his downfall. He had forgotten how alphas were, he had forgotten the rules of life. He had forgotten the very things that his mother and Bucky had drummed into him since he was a child. 'An alpha will never be able to fully love you, remember that punk', that is what Bucky used to say before ruffling his hair and picking him up to go off on their next adventure.
Days where he felt like he should just cut his losses and move to California, start anew. But the searing pain that gripped his heart at the very thought of never seeing Steve again was enough to quell those thoughts.
Steve wipes his mouth and there is a twinkle in his eyes and Tony recognizes that look. Steve shifts Tony's hips up, careful to keep the weight off of his chest. Tony is ready, vibrating with need, and after being ignored for a week, he is starving for the feeling of fullness.
He opens his mouth, to beg or rave, he doesn’t know when suddenly Bucky is standing in front of him, with his hand extended.
Soon the day of their shift to London came. Their luggage was loaded in different carriages. They couldn’t live together in London. The gossip would be too much, even for someone with Tony's reputation. They embraced one last time and climbed into their respective carriages.
But anything to get the alpha out of his mind. Anything. Even though he never wanted to forget a second. So he continued to dry hump the alpha in front of him, tall, wiry, and brunet, as different from Steve as he could find.
“Didn’t faze you before, you got used to it pretty soon.” Tony is tired of this fight, he just wants to lie down and go to sleep for a thousand years.
Sorry for the cliffhanger.
His heat didn’t really come back. He was hornier than usual and still slightly slick but it wasn’t even close to the desperation he had felt before. So he stayed home and tinkered in his workshop, grateful for his Pepper sanctioned heat-leave.
“I know I should have told you about Bucky, I know that. But I knew you would take it badly. I am sorry. And I know I shouldn’t have called you clingy. You aren’t clingy. What you are is the best man I have ever me..”
Steve’s heart is soaring.
Tony was nervous, jittery. He couldn’t sit still and he felt he was too keyed up for this conversation.
Tony frowned at him, taking a bite, and said, “Oh my dear, you don’t have a meek bone in your body. No meek omega would pick up their alpha and throw them on the bed to have their way with them.”
“Steve the end result was the same. You kept me out while I have never done that. I gave you all of me. Always.
“Then I will just have to prove to you that I am a sure thing.” His voice determined.
And Tony doesn’t know why he isn’t ready to believe this. Why he asks what he asks. “And what about Bucky?”
“Baby please try to understand, I will be in no condition to fight if you keep doing this. I am on the knife’s edge and I am barely in control of myself right now. If something happens to you, I will lose the semblance of it and go into full rage. I cannot let that happen.” He said, beseechingly. “So while I know you will hate me for this as team leader I am saying stand down.” And with that he left the room.
Yes, it was very funny. He could cry from laughing it was so funny.
His watch was online. It was receiving signals from the first few small sensors that he and Bruce had sent through. They knew that whatever they were sending ended up in 1815 but they couldn’t pinpoint where.
Their love was rare and he knew that it was better to work through their issues than go out in the world alone. He would never find an alpha like that again. And he didn’t want to.
Pepper once asked him, if all this hard work was worth it. If it was smart to let Steve back into his life. His friends weren't sure he should get back together with Steve, hating him with a ferocity they usually reserved for Howard Stark.
He dozes off while he is planning how he’ll get Steve to pound into him during the next round.
And now he was pregnant with their child. He didn’t really know when it happened. Not that it mattered.
Talking to Bucky was a mistake.
You are the heir to one of the biggest estates in England, you need to think about this in a logical manner.”
He would do anything to get the man back in his life. He just wanted a chance. One chance. But he didn’t know how to look into the face he loved after calling the man clingy.
Steve knows he is right but he just feels like sobbing. He sneaks a glance at Tony and he is talking to a large man while two red-haired women stand next to him. Tony is laughing.
Tony feels tears well up in his eyes. He finally has his decision, he will leave, he won’t stand in the way of his love living his real life. What has he got to offer Steve anyway?
Only as soon as they get to Steve’s townhouse, Tony goes into heat. Apparently prolonged exposure to an alpha can hasten it.
That love let Tony seduce him so easily. His disarming smiles and sweet words working on Steve and in two months they ended up making love in Tony’s townhouse. It was a feeling he had never experienced. The heat and the friction of that day still managing to make him blush. He would never forget the way Tony had kissed him, removed his clothes and used his long beautiful fingers to spread Steve’s aching hole before slowly entering him. The hypnotic hip rolls elicited mewls and groans from Steve, he just wanted Tony to go deeper or harder. But Tony would not relent. They both came this way, with Tony knotting him and emptying his seed inside. Steve didn’t care. He was floating in a pool of happiness and the drowsiness all omegas experienced after mating. Tony was mouthing at his throat and Steve wished he would bite and bind them together, forever.
“Tony I don’t need this much, you are spoiling me.” He laughed, Tony loved to buy him beautiful clothes, pretty jewels, and whatever baubles he thought Steve would enjoy. He wished Tony wouldn’t do all this, he already had Steve’s loyalty and love, and he didn’t need to spend money to gain it.
“Oh really, then why did you come running today? I could have been getting fucked by someone.” Steve was always the possessive kind. Let him think that Tony had moved on and was fucking every alpha in sight. Even though Tony knows he hasn’t touched anyone, unable to stomach the idea of others.
Everything is going great when suddenly Steve’s Aunt Mary arrives to meet Steve with his sweet and extremely conniving omega daughter Victoria.
And that is enough to trigger Steve too. He comes with a hoarse shout. Tony lies down on him, still inside and pumping his seed deep within. Steve cards his fingers through those curls and feels complete.
During all this, the conversation between Lord Stark and Lord Rhodes had shifted and he was introduced to Him. The alpha raised his eyes to meet Steve’s and at that point, he was sure that this man was it. He was everything. He could be the fated mate he had been waiting for all his life.
It’s so precious but you never noticed that until you couldn't get enough of it. Until you were drowning.
Nothing.
“You will tell me about your life, no excluding me or protecting me from anything. That includes the army days. I’m not saying tell me every gory detail. But tell me how you feel and why.”
Why was he surprised? He knew this day would come, hadn’t he? Rich lords married young heiresses and had children with them. They didn’t marry lowly soldiers who slept with them before marriage. They certainly didn’t marry omegas like Steve. Hadn’t he known that Tony would marry someday?
And to top it all off Aunt Mary is back with her horrid daughter.
Because sure as hell he wasn’t gonna share them with Tony. It had stopped hurting him as much as it did during the early part of their relationship. Steve and his friend started meeting up every week and Tony was still ok with that.
Steve was so elated, for weeks he had dreamed of calling him by the name Lord Rhodes used and now he was allowed to. His smile wouldn’t dim for hours, prompting Natasha to interrogate him for the reason.
“When did you become this person Steve?”
By the time Steve comes in the room, it smells like sex. Tony has come four times in the last two hours and he knows it’s only going to get worse. When Steve sees him, he freezes, like a deer in a headlight.
Steve was only a man. And he did whatever any sane man was wont to do in this situation; he fucked Tony, every night, even if the other man was asleep. And he was amazed to realize that Tony was made to be fucked. It was incredible how easily his omega opened up for him like he was created just to take Steve's cock, deep within. Tony barely twitched and never woke up. It was something that Steve was unable to fully comprehend. Tony looked so vulnerable in his sleep. So easily breakable.
To them, he was a whore.
“I will forgive you but there will be new rules in place. You have to follo....” he couldn’t finish before he was enveloped in a bone-crushing hug. Steve had buried his face in Tony's neck and had his arms around his waist in a vice.
He had to talk to Tony again, convince the man of his love. They had to get back together. It might take time but he was willing to do anything. They had to go back to being one again. Anything else was unacceptable.
Sorry, this is not long. Finals are upon me.
“Tony hi.” The man sounded so hopeful that Tony's insides clenched.
“Yes.” Tony’s face lit up and he tackled Steve to the bed and kissed him deeply.
So it was easy to understand why he didn’t notice any changes at first. He simply woke up and went about his day, and if his thighs twinged then he just puts it down to training or fighting the latest villain.
The slow roll of hips and Steve's refusal to completely fill Tony is slowly wearing on his nerves. He groans and begs, but Steve is adamant. There will be no pounding, no rough movements and no vigorous bouts of animal sex.
But Steve hadn’t seemed that type. Or Tony hadn’t wanted to see it. He has been blocking the fact that in two months he has to leave Steve behind.
His heart hurts, it was so funny.
“Hello, Steve. I think we should talk. Would you come to my apartment?” He knew he sounded formal but falling back to his practiced nonchalance was the only way he could control his feelings right now.
Still panting he let go of Tony's legs and held his omega close. He looked at Tony and was filled with a love he couldn’t describe. The future was confusing but being with the man made it all seem so easy.
“If I go you’ll leave me. You won’t come back. I left the last time and I was so alone and you slept with other people.” Steve had his head clutched in his hands and was crying. And Tony wanted to comfort him, a primal need to soothe his pains and aches. But right now he needed to think about himself.
But what was he supposed to do? Who would help him?
Tell me why I shouldn’t just go out and get another alpha. Someone who’ll love me better. Someone who will treat me like I deserve. I could be someone’s first choice.” Tony hugs himself tighter, wishing to protect himself, and moving away from Steve.
“Okay, then Natasha; tell me more about this plan of yours.”
It seemed too final to Steve but he still didn’t have a plan to get Tony back.
Steve still looks gutted, “Tell me how to fix this. I will do anything. Please.”
He turns around and looks at the alpha and wonders why he couldn’t have said this then.
Which is why it was such a huge shock to learn that Steve had been off meeting some other omega in secret. And then the words he used against Tony when he brought it up like he was the one who was in the wrong. Like he didn’t have the right to ask about things. He couldn’t help but question the depth of Steve’s love. Oh, he knew Steve liked him well enough. But if he ran to his old omega then maybe Tony was just a stop gap. Not perfect but would work right now.
This feeling is not because Tony isn’t paying attention to him or is talking about getting married; it is because nothing is different. Everything is the same. Two hours ago when Tony called on him to escort him to the ball, Steve had hoped against hope for a reaction.
After what seemed like hours, he catches a glimpse of his friend. Now Steve knows that Bucky is in the ballroom with him and he’s nervous. What if Natasha’s plan doesn’t work? What if Tony doesn’t care? What if he is happy that Steve is taken care off so that he can marry that woman in peace?
Steve slowly enters him, but before he can sink completely he moves back out. Tony tries to clench, to keep him in but Steve keeps withdrawing until only his tip is resting at Tony's rim. And then he slowly enters again. He hitches Tony up and HOLY FUCK!
And then his belly was a little plumper.
Dancing with Tony was his absolute favourite thing to do. Okay, the second most favourite thing to do. Tony was a patient and kind teacher. And more often than not their waltzes just turned into a side to side sway while they held each other close, exchanging soft kisses and sweet words.
Oh god.
“As my lord commands.” Steve was unable to resist Tony and his demands.
